GENERAL REMARKS.
� The Land Transfer Act, 1870,? gave to New Zealand a system of
registration of title similar to that which was first introduced into
South Australia by Mr. Torrens, and was subsequently adopted by
the other Australian Colonies and Tasmania. This Act repealed
? The Land Registry Act, 1860,? which provided for the registration
of title on a somewhat different plan. The latter Act though con-
structed with great ability, and capable, with slight amendments, of
being made perhaps more complete than the one which superseded it
?never became popular, and was practically a dead-letter. The
success of the Torrens system -in Australia, its simple mechanism,
and the importance of maintaining uniformity with the other colonies
in so large a branch of law as that of immovable property, fully
justify the action taken by our Legislature in its adoption.
The Torrens system substitutes title by registration for title by
deed. Under the old law the deeds constitute the title; and on
every dealing the deeds have to be investigated, however many there
may be, until the ownership is traced back from the person proposing
to deal'to the person named in the Crown grant. Each deed is a link
in the chain, and must be carefully perused and tested by trained
lawyers. Nor is this all. The deeds themselves may show a good
title, but some one or more of the numerous owners, between the
Crown grantee and the intending seller or mortgagor may, through
fraud or mistake, have sold, mortgaged, or leased the property, or
part of it, twice over. To ascertain this the Deeds Registry has to be
searched?an operation always requiring great care, and frequently
entailing considerable labour. In these processes there is no finality;
they have to be repeated upon every fresh transaction, and, as each
transaction entails a fresh deed, the chain is lengthened, and every
new dealing becomes more complicated than the preceding one. The
lawyer, of course, expects to be paid for his labour in investigating
titles, and for his responsibility in damages to his client in case a


title proves defective. Hence tlie expense of transactions under the*
old system, and, with the expense, no corresponding advantage, for a
man has no guarantee for the goodness of his title beyond the skill
of his lawyer. The necessity of these laborious investigations of
course involves delay, and thus prevents land from being so merchant-
able a commodity as it might otherwise become.
If a man having a piece of land rashly concludes that he can deal
with it as he can with a horse or a cow, agrees to sell it, and signs an
ordinary sale-note for it, he has laid himself open to a possibility of
endless annoyance. His title may be absolutely perfect, but even in
that case he can be called upon not only to produce his title deeds,
but also to provide, at his own expense, an abstract of his title.
Frequently, however, his title is one of that numerous class known as
good holding titles : that is to say, titles which, although not techni-
cally perfect, are practically secure against disturbance. If so, the
seller can be compelled by the purchaser to make good, at his own
expense, every technical defect; and, if the purchaser?s solicitor should
insist on the title being made absolutely perfect, the seller will have
to spare no expense to make it so. If he attempts to shirk he is
brought up with the threat of a suit for specific performance. The
seller will have lost time, money, and temper in the affair, and will
have acquired, in return, some knowledge of the law of real property,
which will not prevent him from including the law and its ministers
in a general condemnation.
From these considerations it will appear that the old system of
conveyancing is defective in the following respects :
1. It tends to constantly-increasing complexity ;
2. It is expensive; and, as complexity of title increases, ex-
pense will increase also;
3. It causes delay;
4. It is uncertain. No man has any sure guarantee of the
goodness of his title.
These defects present great and increasing obstacles. to dealings
with land, and are a heavy burden upon all proprietors of land, but
especially upon small holders, who form the great body of landowners
in the colony. It is these defects that the Land Transfer Act is
intended to remove.
Land bought from the Crown since the Land Transfer Act came
into operation is under the Act ipso facto. The Crown grant is
registered under the Act without the grantee taking any steps in the
matter, and full provision is made for dealing with such land in terms
�f the Act in the interval between the purchase of the land and the


issue of the Crown grant. The old system of conveyancing, therefore,
cannot he applied to land bought from the Crown since the Land
Transfer Act came into operation, but all dealing with such land must
be conducted on the system of registration of title.
Any other land may be brought under the Land Transfer Act on
the application of the persons interested* The application, with the
deeds, is left at the District Land Registry Office, and the title is
there investigated by officers appointed for that purpose. If it be
found that the title, although perhaps not technically perfect, is yet
secure against ejectment and against the claims of any other person,
the land will be brought under the Act, and the proprietor or his
nominee will receive a certificate of title. It is, of course, possible
that the* certificate of title may, through error, issue to the wrong
person, and that injustice may be done. In such case the person
injured has a remedy in damages against the Government, and, in
order to form a fund to meet claims of this nature, a fee is charged
of id. in the pound on the value of all land brought under the Act.
On the issue of the certificate the old deeds, if they relate exclusively
to the land applied for, are cancelled and retained in the Land
Registry Office. If they relate to other property they are returned,
each deed being marked as cancelled, so far as relates to the land
brought under the Act. In any case they are of no use to the land
brought under the Act, since from thenceforth the certificate of title
is conclusive evidence that the person named in it is entitled to the
land it describes. The certificate of title operates as a Government
guarantee that the title is perfect.
Certificates of title are issued to every person entitled to any
estate of freehold in possession in land under the Act. Every certificate
is in duplicate. One duplicate is given to the proprietor, the other
is retained in the Land Registry Office. The certificates in the office
constitute the Register-book, which is the pivot on which the whole
mechanism turns. Every certificate is marked with the number of
the volume and folium of the Register-book. Certificates of title are
now issued- in lieu of Crown grants for land bought since the Act
came into operation. '
Printed forms of transfer, mortgage, lease, and other dealings in
outline are to be procured at the Lands Registry Office, and must be
used in all cases, except under such special circumstances as may in
the opinion of the Registrar justify him in dispensing with the same

tlie land included in it he fills up and executes a printed form of
memoi andum of transfer to the purchaser. The transfer is presented
to the Registry Office, and a memorial of the transfer is recorded by
the Registrar on both duplicates of the certificate of title. The
purchaser, by the recording of this memorial, stands in precisely the
same position as the original owner. If only a part of the land in a
certificate is to he transferred, such part is described in the memo-
randum of transfer, the transfer is noted on both duplicates of the
original certificate, a fresh certificate is issued to the purchaser for
the part transferred, and the original certificate is noted as cancelled
with respect to such part. This process is repeated on every sale of
the freehold, and it will thus be seen that every person entitled to
a fieehold estate in land under the Act has hut one document to
show his title, through however many hands the property may have
passed, and such document vests in him an absolutely indefeasible
title to the land it describes.
If the proprietor wishes to mortgage or lease his land, or to charge
it with the payment of a sum of money, he executes, in duplicate,
memoranda of mortgage, lease, or incumbrance, in the form provided
by the Act, altered so as to meet the peculiar circumstances of the
case. These are presented at the Registry Office, with the certificate
of title; a memorial of the transaction is entered by the Registrar on
the certificate of title and on the duplicate certificate forming the
Register-book. The entry of this memorial constitutes registration of
the instrument, and a note, under the hand and seal of the District
Land Registrar, of the fact of such registration is made on both
duplicates of the instrument. Such note is conclusive evidence that
the instrument has been duly registered. One of the duplicates is
then filed in the office and the other is handed to the mortgagee or
lessee. The certificate of title will thus show that the original
proprietor is entitled to the land it describes, subject to the mortgage,
lease, or incumbrance ; while the duplicate instrument held by the
mortgagee, lessee, or incumbrancee will show precisely the nature of
his interest. Each person has, and can have, but one document of
title, and this shows conclusively the nature of the interest he
holds, and to that interest his title is indefeasible. If a mortgage is
paid off, a simple receipt is indorsed on the duplicate mortgage held
by the mortgagee. This is brought to the Registry Office, and the
fact that the mortgage has been paid off is noted on the certificate of
title. Here a striking inconvenience of the old system is done away
with. Few things are more perplexing to simple minds than the
necessity which that system imposes of a deed of reconveyance when


a mortgage has been paid off. A mortgage under the Act does not
involve a transfer of the ?legal estate? although the mortgagee is
made as secure as if such transfer had taken place. The necessity,
therefore, for a deed of reconveyance, when the mortgage is paid off,
at once vanishes. If a lease is to be surrendered it has merely to he
brought to the Registry Office, with the word ? Surrendered ? indorsed
upon it, signed by the lessor and lessee, and attested, and the
Registrar will note the fact that it has been surrendered on the
certificate of title. Mortgages or leases are transferred by indorse-
ment, by a simple form. The Act provides implied powers of sale
and foreclosure in mortgages, and in leases implied covenants to
pay rent and taxes, and to keep in repair, together with power for
the lessor to enter and view the state of repair, and to re-entey in
case of non-payment of rent or breach of covenant. All these may
he omitted or modified if desired. In order to save verbiage short
forms are provided, which may be used for covenants in leases or
mortgages, the longer forms which they imply being set out in the
Act. Thus, in a lease, the words ? will not without leave assign or
sublet ? imply a covenant ?that the said lessee shall not, nor will,
during the term of such lease, assign, transfer, demise, sublet, or set
over, or otherwise, by any act or deed, procure the lands or premises
therein mentioned, or any part thereof, to be assigned, transferred,
demised, sublet, or set over, to any person whomsoever, without the
consent in writing of the said lessor first had and obtained.
Every person, therefore, entitled to a freehold estate in possession
has a certificate of title, on which are recorded memorials of all
mortgages, leases, or incumbrances, and of their discharge or
surrender. If he transfers his entire interest a memorial of the
transfer is recorded on the certificate, and the transferee takes it,
subject to recorded interests. The transferee can, if he chooses,
have a fresh certificate issued in his own name, and in that case the
old certificate is cancelled, and the memorials of the leases or
mortgages to which the land is subject are canied foiuaid to t e
new one. If a proprietor transfers only a part of his land his
certificate is cancelled as to the land transferred, for which a fresh
certificate is issued, and memorials of outstanding interests are
similarly carried forward. Memorials of dealings uith leases or
mortgages are noted on tlie duplicate lease or mortgage lield by tle
lessee or mortgagee, and on the folium of the Register-book. The
Registrar, therefore, and persons searching, can see at a glance the
whole of the recorded dealings with every property j while each person
interested can see, by the one document he holds, the precise extent
of his interest.


The books kept in the Registry Office, other than the Register-
book, are?
1. An application-book, in which particulars of applications to
bring land under the Act are noted ;
2. A journal, in which are entered, shortly, particulars of land
brought under the Act, and of instruments registered;
3. An index of the names of persons entitled to any interest
in land under the Act. This is posted from the journal.
Rach person has a page allotted to him, and every time
any instrument is registered vesting any interest in him
an entry is made stating shortly the nature of the instru-
ment, the date of registration, and the property affected,
and referring to the folium of the Register where a
memorial of it has been entered.
Thus, whenever it is desired to know what interests any person
has, it is only necessary to turn to the folium of the index under his
name, and all the interests he has ever had will be' seen at a glance.
A reference from thence to the several foliums of the Register where
they are recorded will show whether he is still entitled to them, or in
what manner they have been disposed of. ?
These books, with the Register-book, and the various instruments
presented for registration which are retained in the office, and of
which each class is kept separate and numbered consecutively, form
the whole machinery. When land is first brought under the Act an
entry of the fact, referring to the volume and folium of the Register-
book, is entered against the property in the Deeds Registry Office. A
person, therefore, by searching there, and subsequently referring to
the volume and folium of the Register-book to which he is directed,
will find out every particular. With respect to land purchased since
the Act came into operation a reference to the name of the original
grantee in the index will give the volume and folium of the Register-
book where the grant is to be found, and from thence a person search-
ing can discover in whom the land or any part of it has become vested.
Ihe * foregoing remarks form a slight and necessarily imperfect
sketch of the objects and machinery of the Land Tranfer Act.
They are intended merely as a short introduction to its principles,
suited to the comprehension of ordinary readers, and they illustrate its
operations with respect to the simple transactions of every-dav life.
It must not, however, be supposed that the Land Transfer Act
prevents dealings of a complex nature. A person seised in fee-simple
can settle his land on his children in strict settlements if he chooses,
with as great facility as under the old law.


A dissertation on this and kindred subjects would stretch to an
inordinate length, and he interesting to few; moreover, the informa-
tion it would afford would he obtained more satisfactorily by a study
of the Acts. Those who desire to avail themselves of the provisions
of the Act should peruse carefully the detailed instructions in this
pamphlet; while to legal practitioners and brokers an accurate know-
ledge of the Acts themselves is, of course, indispensable.
Except in the case of mortgages to building societies, and of
Crown grants of public reserves, no notice of trusts can he entered
on the Register, nor can any instrument declaring trusts he registered.
Instruments declaring trusts may, however, he deposited with the
Registrar for safe custody; but these deeds, although of course
binding between the parties to them, in no way affect persons dealing
with trustees who are registered proprietors; and every person who is
registered as the proprietor of any estate or interest is permitted to
deal with such estate or interest as he pleases, and to give an abso-
lutely indefeasible title to the persons with whom he deals, notwith-
standing he may be in fact a mere trustee.
The risk of fraud is, however, narrowed to the utmost by sections
123 to 125 of the Act, which provides that, in any case where two or
more persons who are trustees are registered as joint proprietors, the
words ? No survivorship ? may be written on their instrument of title,
and that thereafter the interest in respect of which they are registered
cannot he dealt with by any less number of persons than the number
originally registered without the sanction of the Supreme Court. If,
for instance, three persons were appointed trustees, and the words
(f yo survivorship ? were indorsed on their certificate, the three must
unite to commit a breach of trust. Moreover, any person who is
interested in trust property may, so long as it remains on the Register
in the names of the trustees, lodge a caveat, and thus effectually
prevent any dealing with the property by them contrary to the intent
of the instrument creating the trust; and the Registrar is empowered
to lodge caveats in cases where he deems it necessary for the protec-
tion of persons beneficially interested. The principle of non�-recogni-
tion of trusts obtains with respect to the entire funded debt of Great
Britain, amounting to nearly eight hundred millions of money; to
the shares of every private company in the British dominions, amount-
ing to at least as much more; and to the whole shipping interest of
the Empire. In each of these cases a system of registration of title
prevails ; in none are trusts recognized;, and the modes of preventing
breaches of trust are by no means so simple or effective as those pro-
vided by the Land Transfer Act. The justice of the principle has


been practically admitted by the legal profession of the colony, for in
nearly every case where land is vested in trustees under the old law a
discretionary power of sale is given to them; and, if they are fraudu-
lently inclined, they can sell, and appropriate the money, as their
receipts discharge the purchaser.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR GUIDANCE IN BRINGING LAND
UNDER THE ACT.
1. Applications should be clearly and grammatically expressed,
and written in a plain legible hand. No application on which an
erasure is detected will be received; but mistakes may be corrected
by scoring the pen through the words written in error, and writing
the correct words over them. The words scored out or interlined
must be initialed by the applicant and the person before the
declaration is taken.
2. By, the 168 th section of ? The Land Transfer Act, 1885,? the
District Land Registrar is prohibited from receiving any application
to bring land under the provisions of that Act unless it be indorsed
with a certificate that the same is correct for the purposes of that
Act, signed by the applicant proprietor, or by his solicitor, or by a
licensed broker employed by him.
3. The same section subjects to a penalty not exceeding �5O any
person who shall falsely or negligently certify to the correctness of any
application; and persons transacting business are cautioned that this
penalty will be strictly enforced in case of misdescription of land or
boundaries, or in case of the omission to disclose the existence in any
other person of an estate or interest in the property.
4. Any person may apply to bring under the provisions of the
Land Transfer Act land of which he is the proprietor either at law
or in equity : Provided that, if no Crown grant has been issued the
application must be assented to by the Governor.
5. If the land be vested in the applicant as the trustee only, and
the trhst deed does not contain powers of sale and absolute disposal,
all persons beneficially entitled must concur in the application; but,
if the trust deed vests in the trustees power .of .sale and absolute
disposal, such consent is not necessary. The trustees, or the party
transferring the property to be held in trust, may, at the time of
making the application, or subsequently, require the words ?No
survivorship ?to be entered on the certificate of title; the effect of
which will be, that, in the event of the death, resignation, or incapacity
of any trustee, the remaining trustees cannot, without the express-


sanction of the Supreme Court, dispose of or deal with the property
until the original number of trustees is made up. Caveat may also be
lodged by any trustee or beneficiary, restraining dealings by the
trustees, except such as are authorized by the trust.
6. When application is made by or on behalf of a person entitled
to a life estate, all persons entitled in reversion or remainder must
concur in the application; and such concurring parties may, upon
their applying, each for himself, he registered as reversioner, or
remainderman, as the will, settlement, or other deeds and evidence
jjjay prove him to be entitled. An extra fee .of 10s. has to he paid in
the cases last referred to,
7. If the applicant he a married woman her husband must con-
sent in the application, except as to land held hy her for her separate use.
8. The father or guardian of a minor, or the committee of a
lunatic, may apply to bring land under the Act in the name of
such minor or lunatic. An agent holding a power of attorney
authorizing the sale of a freehold estate may also apply, in the name
of his principal, to bring under the Act any land in respect of which
such authorization is given, unless his power expressly prohibits him
from so doing.
9. If the land be mortgaged the mortgagee must consent in the
application. The amount of the mortgage, the debt when payable,
the rate of interest, the dates on which the same is payable, must
also be stated, together with the name, residence, and trade or calling
of the mortgagee, and the date of the mortgage.
10. If the land be under lease, the term for which it is leased, the
amount of rent, the dates when payable, and the name, residence, and
description of the lessee must he stated; and if there he a covenant
to purchase, or right of purchase be covenanted, the fact must be
stated, with the amount of purchase-money and the period within
which the covenant is to he fulfilled or the privilege exercised.
11 Should there be any incumbrance, or settlement, or outstand-
ing estate, or interest affecting the land, the same must he stated
with full particulars, as in the case of mortgaged land.
13. When the land mentioned in the application consists of an
entire section or allotment, as delineated in an original Crown grant,
and when such grant is not handed in with the application, a diagram
must he furnished from the Land Office at the cost of the applicant;
and, in cases where diagrams are refused by the Land Office, a map
of the section must be furnished and declared to by a licensed
surveyor before the Registrar or a Justice of the Peace.
13. When the application is in respect to part only of an original


Government section, a plan must be furnished by a licensed surveyor,
and declared to in like manner. This rule may be relaxed when it
is shown that the deed surrendered, or a deposited map, contains an
accurate description of the land, and if there is no doubt as to the
actual occupation.
14. Every map or plan of part of an original Government
section must show precisely the position of the particular part with
reference to the boundaries of the original section, except where a
Crown grant has been issued for such part of an original section.
15. The application must state?First, the name and address of
the proprietor. Second, the nature of the estate held by him in the
land. Third, where the land is situated. Fourth, the area in acres,
roods, and perches. Fifth, the rights-of-way, easements, or privileges
attaching to the land, or enjoyed over it by parties other than the
applicant. Sixth, the boundaries. Seventh, the value, including
buildings and permanent improvements. Eighth, the date of the
original grant. Ninth, the number of the original section upon the
public maps. Tenth, the particulars of all leases, mortgages, in-
cumbrances, liens, or other interests affecting the estate of the appli-
cant. Eleventh, the name and postal address of the person in
occupation, if any; and whether such occupation is adverse to the
applicant or otherwise. Twelfth, the names and postal addresses of
owners or occupiers of the contiguous land, so far as known to the
applicant. Thirteenth, that the deeds or instruments in the list at
foot of the application are all that are in the custody or under the
control of the applicant affecting the land. Forms of application can
be obtained at every District Land Registry Office, price Is. each.
16. When the land is mortgaged, and it is desired to discharge
the mortgage at the time of bringing the land under the Act, a deed
of reconveyance will not be required, as a discharge indorsed on the
mortgage in the following words will suffice: ?
? Received from the within-named A.B. the sum of � ,
in full discharge of all principal moneys and interest secured by the
within mortgage.
?Witness ?G.H.? ?Mortgagee.
Or the following words may be written at the foot of the applica-
tion, and signed by the mortgagee and attested: ? I consent to the
above , having received � in full discharge of a
mortgage on the above property, dated the day of ,
18 , and made between , of the one part, and ,
of the other part, to secure � and interest. Dated at
, the day of ,18 ?


17. The consent of parties, when required, may be signified by
the words ? I consent hereto,? signed and attested.
18. The applicant may, at the time of making application, or at
any time prior to the date appointed by the District Land Registrar
for the land to be brought under the Act, by writing under his hand,
attested by a witness, direct the Registrar to issue the certificate of
title in the name of a purchaser or other person to whom he may
desire to transfer the land. In such case, however, the certificate is
liable to a stamp duty of the same amount as a deed conveying the
property from the applicant to his nominee would have been liable to
if the transaction had been affected by deed. The stamp duty is
assessed and collected by the District Land Registrar, and to enable
him to do this the exact nature of the transaction, with the price or
consideration, should be set out in the application, or embodied in a
statutory declaration by the applicant or the person in whose name
the certificate is to issue. The District Land Registrar is further
empowered to examine both parties on oath for the purposes of assess-
ment, and is forbidden to issue the certificate until the same has been
duly stamped. Stamp duty is likewise payable where the application
is made by a person entitled in equity only, as, for instance, where a
person has purchased a property but has not got a conveyance, and
applies to vest it in himself under the Act.
19. All grants, conveyances, or other instruments affecting the
property in the possession of the applicant or under his control
must be deposited with the District Land Registrar, together with
the application.
20. The fees on bringing land under the Act are set out at length
in the Schedule.
Credit is given, if desired, for all fees, except the application fee
of 55., until such time as the applicant wishes to deal with the
land.
Where several properties derived from separate Crown grants, or
having separate and distinct titles, are included in one form of appli-
cation, an application and registration fee is charged in respect of
each property, and a fee to cover the probable cost of advertising.
21. The assurance fee charged on the first bringing of land under
the Act guarantees all subsequent dealings with the same land by sale,
lease, mortgage, or incumbrance, and is not again charged until the
land becomes transmitted by will, settlement, or intestacy.
22. Any number of properties in land wherever situated within
the district, if belonging to the same proprietor, may be included in
'<me application; but separate certificates of title must as a general


rule be taken out for section or allotments situated so far apart that
they cannot conveniently be included in the same diagram.
23. Land included in one original grant, or treated as one pro-
perty, in any deeds of title surrendered may, at the desire of the
applicant proprietor, be divided into two or more properties, each
under a separate certificate of title.
24. Lands represented under several surrendered grants or deeds
of title as separate properties may, at the desire of the proprietor, be
included together in one certificate of title whenever the lands are so
situated as to admit of being included in the same diagram.
25. Where joint tenants or tenants in common apply to bring
land under the Act, and desire to make partition, a memorandum as
follows, signed dated, and attested, can be indorsed on or annexed to
the application : ? We, the undersigned, apply that the certificate of
title of acres roods perches, part of the
within land, as coloured green on plan, be issued to A.8., and that cer-
tificate of title of acres roods perches,,
the remainder thereof, as coloured red on plan, be issued to C.D.?
26. The above instructions apply only to land purchased from the
Crown in any district before the Ist February, 1871.
All land bought from the Crown since the above date is already
under the Land Transfer Act, and can only be dealt with in the man-
ner prescribed by the Act.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONDUCTING TRANSFERS AND
OTHER DEALINGS WITH LAND, APPLICABLE TO IN-
STRUMENTS GENERALLY.
1. The prescribed forms of memorandum of transfer, lease, mort-
gage, &c., may be procured at any District Land Registry Office.
These instruments, when filled up, executed, and attested in manner
hereinafter described, and (except transfers of an estate *of freehold
in possession) in duplicate, may be presented at the District Land
Registry Office by the party claiming thereunder, or by any person
acting on his behalf. In every case the words ? Correct for the
purposes of the Land Transfer Act,? signed by the party claiming
under the instrument, or by his broker or solicitor, must be indorsed
thereon. No instrument can be registered unless in accordance with
the provisions of the Land Transfer Act, but the prescribed forms
may be used with such alterations as the character of the parties or
circumstances of the case may render necessary, and no variation from


them, except in. matter of substance, will affect their validity. Care
should he taken, than none of the parties to any instrument (except in
mortgages or building societies) are described as trustees, and no
mention, direct or indirect, should be made of any trust. All instru-
ments must be properly stamped previously to being presented. The
stamp duties are shown in the Schedule. The duplicates of each
instrument are not liable to stamp duty.
2. The 16.8 th section of ?The Land Transfer Act, 1885,? subjects
to a penalty of �SO any person who shall falsely or negligently certify
to the correctness of any instrument. Persons transacting business
are cautioned that this penalty will be strictly enforced.
3. The prescribed fees must be paid at the time of presenting the
instrument.
4. No instrument on which an erasure is detected will be received
for registration. Mistakes may be corrected by scoring the pen
through the words written in error, and writing the correct words
over them. In every, such case the words scored out. and interlined
must be initialed by the party executing the same and by the attest-
ing witness.
5. Every instrument affecting any estate or interest in land
under the Land Transfer Act must be signed by the registered pro-
prietor who contracts to deal with that estate or interest. The
signature must be attested by one witness.
6. The contracting proprietor may attend personally at the
Registry Office and execute the instrument in presence of the
Registrar or some other officer of the department; otherwise the
execution may be attested by any known and credible witness; but
in such case the District Land Registrar may require that such
execution be proved before a Registrar or Justice of the Peace, who
will notify such proof by a certificate to that effect, under his hand,
indorsed upon the instrument in Form in sth Schedule to Land
Transfer Act.
7. Before granting such certificate the Registrar or Justice will
require the contracting proprietor, if he attend and is personally
known to him, to acknowledge that ?he did freely and voluntarily
sign such instrumentbut if the contracting proprietor does not
attend, or is not known to such Registrar or Justice, the witness who
attested the signature will be required to answer the following ques-
tions on oath or under statutory declaration : ? Are you the witness
who attested the signing of this instrument; and is the name Pr
mark purporting to be your name or mark as such attesting witness
your own handwriting?? ?Do you personally know A.8., the


person signing this instrument, and whose signature you attested??
? Is the name purporting to he his signature his own handwriting;
is he of sound mind; and did he freely and voluntarily sign the
same ??
8. The acknowledgment or proof of execution of instruments may
he dispensed with when the signature of the party executing or of
the attesting witness is known to the Registrar. Information or
advice may be obtained at the District Land Registry as to mode
of verification of instruments proposed to he executed out of the
colony.
9. When the property to he dealt with comprises the entire of the
lands included under any existing grant or certificate, lease, mortgage,
or incumbrance, or comprises the entire of any allotment or allot-
ments in any township, the plan of which has been deposited in terms
of the Land Transfer Act, a reference to such instrument or plan for
the description of the property will suffice, and a diagram will not be
required. When the property to be dealt with comprises part only
of the lands included in any such instrument, or allotment, the
portion to be dealt with must be minutely described and delineated
in a diagram, accurately drawn to scale on the margin of the instru-
ment intended to be registered, or annexed thereto, certified by
declaration of a licensed surveyor, which declaration must be made
before the District Land Registrar or a Justice of the Peace.
11. The diagram is occasionally dispensed with if the description
given be sufficient to enable the draughtsman of the department to
delineate the subdivision, with the aid of a deposited plan, or of the
diagram on the existing grant or certificate of title, or other instru-
ment. In cases, however, where the land has not been Crown-
granted, and part only of any section is dealt with, the diagram is
never dispensed with, and evidence from the Government Survey
Office will also be required as to the identity of the land and the
correctness of the plan and description.
12. Whenever the concurrence of any person interested is required
to give validity to any transaction, such concurrence may be signified
by the words, ? I consent hereto,? written on the instrument and
signed by such person. The signature must be witnessed and the
execution acknowledged or proved in manner hereinbefore described.
13. The counterpart of every instrument registered, bearing a
certificate under the hand and seal of the District Land Registrar
that the particulars thereof have been entered in the Register-book,
will be returned to the party who has acquired estate or interest
thereby.


14. Entry in the Register-hook is the essential which gives validity
to transactions; and the certificate and seal of the District Land.
Registrar render the instrument evidence to prove title in any Court
of justice.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR TRANSFER OF ESTATE OR
INTEREST.
15. When land is intended to he transferred in fee the proprietor
fills up a memorandum of transfer, Form D, stating the amount of
purchase-money, and describing rights-of-way or other easements or
privileges, if any, reserved by such proprietor ; also rights-of-way or
other easements, if any, over other lands, under the provisions of the
Act, intended to be attached to and exercised in conjunction with the
proprietorship of the land intended to be transferred.
16. If the land be under lease the name, residence, and descrip-
tion of the tenant, the term of the lease, the amount of rent, and any
material covenants, such as right of purchase, should be stated.
17. If the land be mortgaged or incumbered the amount secured,
the date when payable, the rate of interest, and other particulars,
with the name, residence, and description of the mortgagee or
incumbrancee should be stated ; but if the land be settled, and the
vendor acts in the capacity of trustee only, that circumstance must
not be stated, as the purchaser has no occasion to look to the
appropriation of the purchase-money.
18. When the intention is to vest the land in trustees the words
?No survivorship ? may be introduced into the memorandum of
transfer, the effect of which will be that, in the event of death,
incapacity, or resignation of any trustee, the remaining trustees will
be debarred from dealing with the property until the original number
of trustees is made up, or unless the consent of the Supreme Court
be obtained specially for the proposed dealing,
19. LTpon the registration of any memorandum of transfer vesting
land in trustees a duplicate or attested copy of the deed of settlement,
or other instrument declaratory of the trusts executed by the trustees,
may be deposited in the Registry Office for safe custody and refer-
ence, and caveat may be lodged by the settlor or by the trustees, or by
any person beneficially entitled under the settlement, prohibiting any
dealing with the land either absolutely or until fourteen days? notice
of the intended dealing has been given to the caveator, his solicitor or
agent, as may be directed in the caveat.


20. The registered proprietor may also settle his estate without
the instrumentality of trustees, by executing a transfer of the reversion
reducing his own interest to that of tenant for life; or he may, in
like manner, transfer the life estate to one person with remainder to
others in succession, as he may appoint. A registered proprietor may
also execute a transfer to his wife ; or, if the registered proprietor he
a married woman, she may execute a transfer to her husband. A
transfer may he executed by a registered proprietor vesting his estate
in himself jointly with any other persons.
31. The existing grant, certificate of title, or, where the land has
not been Crown-granted, the receipt for the purchase-money, must he
deposited in the Registry Office, together with the memorandum of
transfer.
22. When the fee-simple of the whole of the land included in an
existing certificate of title is transferred no fresh certificate need he
issued; hut when a part only is transferred a certificate of title will
he made out and delivered to the transferee in exchange for the
memorandum of transfer, and a certificate for the balance of such
land will, on payment of �l, he issued to the proprietor, and the
previous certificate will be cancelled, or, at the desire of the pro-
prietor, the existing grant or certificate will be cancelled so far only
as regards the portion of land transferred, and the issue of certificate
for the balance postponed in anticipation of future sales. The de-
posited grant or certificate will, in such case, be retained in the
District Land Registry Office. If land is transferred to two or
more persons without specifying that they hold it as tenants in
common it will vest in them as joint tenants, and one certificate of
title only will be issued. If it is vested in them as tenants in
common a separate certificate may be issued to each person if re-
quired.
23. Properties represented by several grants or certificates of title
may be dealt with under one memorandum of transfer to the same
purchaser, who may exercise his discretion as to whether the lands
shall be included in one certificate or divided into separate properties,
each represented by a separate certificate; subject, however, to the
existing regulations in respect to plans and diagrams.
24. When land is subdivided for the purpose of sale in allotments
the proprietor is required to deposit in the District Land Registry
Office a plan of such subdivision, certified by a declaration of a
licensed surveyor in manner hereinbefore described, upon which the
allotments, streets, squares, and other reserves for public purposes
must be distinctly delineated, and the allotments numbered.


25. If the allotments be of an area not exceeding one statute acre,
then the plan must be on a scale of not less than one inch to two
chains. If the allotments be of an area exceeding one acre, but not
exceeding five acres, then the plan must be on a scale of not less than
one inch to five chains. If the allotments be of a greater area than
five acres, then the plan must be on a scale of not less than one inch
to ten chains. The above is the minimum scale for plans deposited;
but a larger scale, as affording facility for marking off future sub-
divisions, is recommended for adoption whenever the township is of
such moderate extent as may admit of it without inconvenience.
26. The proprietor, before proceeding to sale, should deposit with
the District Land Registrar the grant or certificate of title to the
lands comprised in the township ; he should also provide himself with
forms of memorandum of transfer to be filled in and executed in
favour of each purchaser as sales are effected.
27. Whenever it is intended to confer a right-of-way or other
easement or privilege over land the memorandum of transfer may be
modified so as to express clearly the nature of the easement or privilege
intended to be conferred. A memorial of the easement granted will
be entered on the folium of the Register-book constituted by the grant
or certificate of title of the land to which it attaches, and on the
duplicate thereof in the hands of the proprietor; and the duplicate
memorandum of transfer will be returned to the transferee with
certificate of registration indorsed thereon.
28. Mortgages, incumbrances, and leases may be transferred by a
simple indorsement of the words following : ?I, the within men-
tioned , in consideration of the sum of � this day
paid to me by , the receipt of which I hereby acknowledge, do
hereby transfer to him the estate or interest in respect to which I
am registered as proprietor, as set forth and described in the within
written security, together with all my rights, powers, estate, and
interest therein. In witness whereof I have hereunto subscribed my
name, this day of , 18 The transferee should sign
as accepting, and the signatures should be attested by one witness.
29. The surrender of a lease is effected by indorsing the single
word ? Surrendered,? 'signed by the lessor and lessee, and attested by
one witness and duly'stamped.
30. The instrument when executed and attested should be pre-
sented with as little delay as possible at the District Land Registry
Office, that the particulars of the indorsement may be entered in the
register-book, and the certificate and seal of registration affixed, which
give validity to the transaction.


31. Before paying the purchase-money the purchasers should have
the existing grant, certificate, or other instrument representing the
title to the estate or interest which they purchase delivered up, or
should satisfy themselves that it has been already deposited in the
District Land Registry Office.
32. Prudent persons will also take the precaution of making search,
lest any caveat should he lodged forbidding the District Land Regis-
trar to give effect to the transfer.
33. The Register-book may be searched by the party interested or
by any person on his behalf. The fee is 2s. for each title searched,
if the volume and folium of the Register-book where the' history of
the title is recorded to be given. The requisite information, however,
may readily be obtained from the vendor, as every instrument issued
from the District Land Registry Office bears upon it a memorandum
referring to the volume and folio of the Register-book. If the refer-
ence be not given the fee is as for the general search, ss.
34. The fees are ?Eor memorandum of transfer, 10s.; for certifi-
cate of title, ,�1 ; for certificate of title where the consideration for
the transfer does not exceed �lOO and is not nominal, 10s.; -for
registering; transfer or discharge of mortgage or of incumbrance, or
transfer or surrender of lease by indorsement, ss. When the land
dealt with is comprised in separate folios of the Register there is a
charge of 2s. for each entry after the first. All fees are payable
beforehand.
LEASES.
35. Leases of land under the Act for a life or lives, or for any
term not less than three years, must be made in the form prescribed
by the Act.
36. The name, residence, and trade or calling of the lessor, the
nature of the estate or interest held by him in the land intended to
be leased, and a description of the land in manner directed in para-
graphs 10 and 25, must be set forth in the form of lease; also the
name, residence, and trade or calling of the lessee, the term of years,
the amount .of rent, and dates on which it is to be paid. If right to
be purchase be granted, or agreement to purchase be covenanted, the
amount of the agreed purchase-money, and the period within which
the right may be exercised, should be stated.
37. Covenants for quiet enjoyment, for further assurance, for right
of entry by the lessor to view the state of repair, for re-entry, and
resumption of possession by the lessor in case of rent being in arrear


for six calendar months, or in case of default in the fulfilment of any
covenant by the lessee, continued for six calendar months, or in case
of necessary repairs not being completed within reasonable time after
requirement in writing to that effect served on the lessee; as also
covenants on the part of the lessee for punctual payment of rent, for
payment of rates and taxes during the continuance of the lease, and
for keeping and yielding up the demised premises in good and tenant-
able repair, are declared to be implied in leases under the Land
Transfer Act, unless barred or modified by express words introduced
into the-form of lease. There is therefore no occasion for incumber-
ing the instrument with these details.
38. As regards other covenants prolixity and verbiage may be
avoided by the use of certain brief forms of words, to which specific
signification is given in the Act. Thus a covenant for insurance
against loss bv fire may be introduced by using the four words,
?That he will insure;? 7 the law declaring that whenever these words
are introduced the lessee w T ill be bound ?to insure, and, so long as
the term expressed in the said lease shall not have expired, to keep
insured, in some public insurance office, to be approved by such lessor,
against loss or damage by fire to the full amount specified, or if no
amount be specified then to their full value, all buildings, tenements,
or premises erected on such land, which shall be of a nature or kind
capable of being insured against loss or damage by fire; and that he
will, at the request of the lessor, hand over to and deposit with him
the policy of every such insurance, and produce to him the receipt or
receipts for the annual or other premiums payable on account
thereof ; Provided always that all moneys to be received under or
by virtue of any such insurance shall, in the event of loss or damage
by fire, be laid out and expended in making good such loss or
damage : Provided also that, if default shall be made in the observance
or performance of the covenant last above mentioned, it shall be
lawful for the lessor, without prejudice, nevertheless, to and con-
currently with the powers granted him by the lease, in manner in
and by the Act provided, to insure such building; and the cost and
charges of such insurance shall, until such lease shall have expired,,
be a charge upon the said land.?
Again, by the introduction of the words ? and shall paint outside
every alternate year,? the tenant may be placed under obligation ? to
paint all the outside woodwork and ironwork belonging to the
hereditaments and premises mentioned in such lease, with two coats
of proper oil-colours, in a workmanlike manner.?


By the introduction of the words ? and paint and paper inside
every third yean, the tenant may be placed under the obligation ?to
paint the inside wood, iron, and other works now or usually painted,
with two coats of proper oil-Qolour, in a workmanlike manner; and
also repaper, with paper of a quality as at present, all such parts of
the said premises as are now papered ; and also wash, stop, whiten, or
colour such parts of the said premises as are now whitened or coloured
respectively.?
By using the three words ? and will fence,? the tenant may be
placed under obligation ? to erect and put up on the boundaries of the
land therein mentioned, or upon such boundaries upon which no
substantial fence now exists, a good and substantial fence.?
The words ? and cultivate ? shall imply as follows, viz. : ? and will
at all times during the said lease cultivate, use, and manage all such
parts of the land therein mentioned as are or shall be broken up or
reconverted into tillage, in a proper and husbandlike manner, and will
not impoverish or waste the same.?
The words ? and will not cut timber,? introduced into the lease,
will operate to restrict the tenant from ? cutting down, felling,
injuring, or destroying any growing or living timber, or timber-
like trees, standing and being upon the said hereditaments and
premises above mentioned, without the consent in writing of the said
lessor.?
The words ? and will not, without leave, assign or sublet,? intro-
duced into the lease, will deprive the tenant of the power of ? assign-
transferring, demising, subletting, cu? setting over, or otherwise
by any act or deed procuring the lands or premises therein mentioned,
or any of them, or any part thereof, to be assigned, transferred,
demised, sublet, or set over unto any person whomsoever, without the
consent in writing of the said lessor first had and obtained.?
The words ? will not use as a shop ? shall imply as follows, viz. :
?And also that the said lessee shall not convert, use, or occupy the
said hereditaments and premises mentioned in such lease, or any part
thereof, into or as a shop, warehouse, or other place of carrving on
any trade or business whatsoever, or permit or suffer the said here-
ditaments and premises, or any part thereof, to be used for any such
purpose, or otherwise than as a private dwellinghouse, without the
consent in writing of the said lessor.?
The words ? and will not carry on offensive trades ? shall imply as
follows : ?And also that no noxious, noisome, or offensive act, trade,
business, occupation, or calling shall at any time during the said
term be used, exercised, carried on, permitted, or suffered in or upon


the said hereditaments and premises above mentioned ; and that no
act, matter, or thing whatsoever shall at any time during the said
term he done in or upon the said hereditaments and premises, or any
part thereof, which shall or may he or grow to the annoyance,
nuisance, grievance, damage, or disturbance of the occupiers or
owners of the adjoining lands and hereditaments/ 5
39. The use of these abbreviated forms of words is not compul-
sory ; and the covenants above referred to, or any other covenants,
may ?be introduced into the lease in any form of words that may be
deemed best adapted for giving effect to the intention.
40. Several sections or allotments belonging to the same pio-
prietor, though included in two or more grants or certificates, may
be included under one lease. The original of every lease will be
deposited in the District Land Registry. The duplicate will be given
to the lessee; and a certified copy will, be given to the lessor, if re-
quired by him, at the cost of a few shillings. Copies certified under
the hand and seal of the District Land Registrar are, by ? The Land
Transfer Act, 1885/? section 39, made evidence in all Courts of justice
of all matters contained in the original instruments.
MORTGAGES.
41. After entering on the form of mortgage the name, residence,
and trade or calling of the intending mortgagor, describe the land as
directed in paragraphs 9 and 24, and state the nature of the estate
intended to be charged, whether fee-simple or leasehold, also the par-
ticulars of leases, prior mortgages, or other incumbrances, if any,
affecting the property.
42. Next must be stated the name, residence, and trade or calling
of the person in whose favour the mortgage is to be created, the
amount of the sum of money or annuity to secure which the land is
to be pledged, the date, if any, fixed for the payment of the sum so
secured, or the occurrences or conditions upon which it may be in-
tended that such payment shall be contingent, together with the rate
of interest and the dates on which it is to be paid.
43. Covenants for punctual payment, for keeping in repair, and
for right of entry upon the premises to inspect the state of repairs,
need not be inserted, as these are declared by law to be implied in
every mortgage under the Land Transfer Act, unless expicssly bailed
or modified by words to that effect.
44. Covenants to insure and other covenants may be introduced
hy using the form of words specified for leases (see paragi aph 39),


t)ut tlie use of those abbreviated forms is not compulsory. Any other
covenants agreed on between the parties may be introduced into the
mortgage.
40. Repayment by instalments or periodical payments may be
provided for by a special clause, and forms of mortgage adapted to
the use of building or benefit societies are supplied at the District
Land Registry Offices, and are set out in the Schedule. Mortgages
to these societies must be made to the trustees, without mentioning
their names. (Appendix Cto ? The Land Transfer Act, 1885?)
46. The memorandum of mortgage, when filled in and executed
as directed in the instructions for preparing instruments given in
paragraphs 4 to 13, together with the grant, certificate of title, or
lease under which the land intended to be pledged is held, must be
forwarded to or presented at the District Land Registry Office, in
order that the particulars may be entered in the Register-book.
47. One counterpart of the memorandum of mortgage will be
delivered to the mortgagee, bearing certificate under the hand and
seal of the District Land Registrar that the particulars have been
entered in the Register-book.
48. Entry in the Register-book is the essential which gives validity
to the transaction, and the certificate of the District Land Registrar
makes the instrument evidence in all Courts of justice that such
entry has been made.
49. The mortgagee is entitled during the continuance of the secu-
rity to hold the counterpart, grant, or certificate of title, or lease,
representing the property pledged, or by agreement it may be de-
posited with the Registrar.
50. It should be borne in mind that no lease granted subsequent
to a mortgage, can have any validity as against the mortgagee unless
his concurrence shall be certified thereon in manner directed in para-
graph 13.
51. Although the grant, certificate, or lease will itself for the
most part exhibit the state of the mortgagor?s title, the mortgagee is
advised, as a precautionary measure, before paying the mortgage-
money, to cause search to be made lest caveat should be entered
forbidding the registration of dealings with the property. He
may also, if necessary, protect himself by lodging a caveat for-
bidding any further dealing 'pending the registration of his mort-
gage.
52. Any number of sections or allotments belonging to the
same proprietor may be included in one form of mortgage or in-
cumbrance.


53. A mortgage may be discharged by the simple indorsement
thereon of a receipt for the money secured, signed by the party
entitled, attested by a witness, and duly registered; and in case the
mortgagee is absent from the colony, or if there be no person autho-
rized or capable of giving a receipt for the mortgage-money at the
date appointed for the redemption, the mortgagor may pay the amount
of principal and interest due to the Colonial Treasurer; and the
District Land Registrar, upon production of the Treasurer?s receipt
for the same, will release the land from mortgage by entering in the
Register-book and on the grant the memorial of discharge. In such
cases the amount so paid will be held by the Treasurer in trust for
the mortgagee.
54. In case of default made by mortgagor in payment of interest
or principal, or in the observance of any covenant, the Act gives a
remedy to the mortgagee, by empowering him to sell the property,
after one month?s notice, in writing, served on the mortgagor, or left
at his last known place of abode in the colony, or on the mortgaged
premises.
55. The notice should state the circumstances of the default,
and the intention of the mortgagee to sell unless the same be re-
medied.
56. The procedure to be followed in such sales is the same as that
prescribed in the instructions under the head of ? Transfers.
57. The District Land Registrar is bound to give effect to sales
by mortgagees where the transfer purports to be in exercise of the
power of sale contained or implied in the mortgage, the mortgagee
signing the memorandum of transfer; and the Act declares such
sales, when completed by registration, to be valid and effectual.
58. The sale may be by private contract or by auction, but should
be properly advertised. The property may be sold either in one
block or several, and the balance of the proceeds, after paying the
amount secured and all expenses, must be paid to the mortgagor or
incumbrancer.
59. A mortgagee is empowered to distrain for arrears due twenty-
one days or upwards, to the extent of any rent then due by the
tenant or occupier, and has the like remedies for obtaining possession
of the mortgaged land as are by law given to a landlord against a
lessee or tenant whose term is expired or rent in arrear.


POWERS OF ATTORNEY AND REGISTRATION ABSTRACTS,
60. Any number of sections or allotments may be included in one
power of attorney ; though held under separate grants or other in-
struments of title. The use of the form given in the Act (Schedule
I.) is not compulsory. A general form including all a proprietor?s
land, without particularizing them, may be used. The original or
a duplicate or attested copy must be deposited with the District Land
Registrar.
61, To enable proprietors to take advantage of markets for their
land at places without the limits of the colony, giving immediately
indefeasible title to the purchasers, registration abstracts are provided
which afford proprietors the same facilities for dealing with lands
under the Act, when absent in Great Britain or elsewhere, which
they enjoy wdien in the colony. No frauds, by double sale, such as
above referred to, can occur under this system, because no dealing
can be registered in the colony in respect to land when a registration
abstract is outstanding.
62. Judges, notaries public, and chief officers of Corporations in
Great Britain and Ireland, Judges of Supreme Courts, Governors,
Government Residents, and Chief Secretaries in the British Colonies,
and British Consular Officers in foreign places, are authorized to enter
upon the registration abstract the memorials of dealings with the
property which the District Land Registrar is required to enter in the
Register-book in the case of dealings within the limits of this colony.
63. A memorandum of transfer or other instrument appropriate
to the intended dealing, executed in accordance with the preceding in-
structions, should be presented to the functionary called upon to act
on the occasion, together with the grant, certificate of title, or other
instrument representing the estate intended to be dealt with; and
every memorial entered on the registration abstract must likewise be
entered on such grant, certificate of title, or other instrument, and
authenticated in the same manner under the hand and seal of the
functionary employed. A certificate of registration should also be in-
dorsed on the memorandum of transfer or other instrument, stating
the date and hour on which memorial of the particulars thereof was
entered on the registration abstract, which certificate should be
authenticated in the same manner.
64. The registration abstract should be returned to the District
Land Registrar at the place where it was issued, in order that he
may enter on the appropriate folium of the Register-book the par-
ticulars of any dealings that may have been recorded beyond the


limits o� the colony; and, if an estate of freehold has been trans-
ferred, a certificate of title will he issued to the transferee upon his
surrendering the existing certificate and memorandum of transfer,
65. The fee for a power of attorney is 10s., and for a registration
abstract �l.
CAVEATS.
66. Caveats are of two sorts : First, caveats forbidding the bring-
ing of land under the Act. These may he lodged within the time
for that purpose limited in the advertisement notifying the claim to
have the land brought under the Land Transfer Act, and will lapse
unless some proceeding at law he commenced by the caveator to
establish his claim within three months from the date of lodging the
caveat, and notice thereof be given to the District Land Registrar; or
unless the caveator shall have obtained from the Supreme Court an
order or injunction restraining the District Land Hegistrar from
bringing the land under the provisions of the Act.
67. Secondly, caveats forbidding registration of dealings with land
under the Act. Such caveats. may be lodged for the protection of
parties pending the completion of contracts for sale, mortgage, or
incumbrance; also to restrain dealings with land by trustees with-
out the knowledge or consent of the persons interested, or contrary
to the terms of the trust; and generally for prevention of improper
or fraudulent dealings by registered proprietors..
TRANSMISSIONS.
Marriage.
68. After the marriage of a female registered proprietor of any
estate or interest in land under the Act, and before the District
Land Registrar can give effect to any dealings with the same by such
proprietor, it is necessary for the purpose of identification that the
marriage should be authenticated to him by the production of the
register thereof, accompanied by an application to have the particulars
noted in the Register-book and on the grant or other instrument
evidencing the title of such female proprietor.
Bankruptcy.
69. Upon the bankruptcy of the registered proprietor of an estate
or interest in land under the Act, and before the District Land
Registrar can give effect to any dealings with such estate or inteiest
by the trustees, it is necessary that such bankruptcy be authenticated.


to Mm by production of evidence thereof and of the appointment of a
trustee for .the estate of such bankrupt proprietor, and that application
be made to have the particulars of such appointment entered in the
Register-book and on the grant or other instrument evidencing the title
of such bankrupt proprietor, upon which being done the trustees will
hold the estate subject to the equities upon or subject to which the
bankrupt held the same.
Will or Intestacy.
70. Before effect can be given by the District Land Registrar to
any dealing by an executor or administrator under the will, or upon
the intestacy of the registered proprietor, the particulars of the death
and of the transmission of the property must be authenticated to the
District Land Registrar by probate or office copy of the will, or, in
case of intestacy, by the letters of administration; and application in
writing must be made to the Registrar to register such transmission.
71. Any person claiming as devisee, heir-at-law, or tenant by
curtesy must apply to be registered in the form and manner
? described at page 16 for the first bringing of land under the Act, and
must deposit with the District Land Registrar the grant or certificate
of title with the will or an office copy or probate of the will, or the
settlement under which he claims; or, in the case of intestacy, such
evidence of heirship as he may be able to produce.
72. Under the head of ? transmission ? a provision is also made
for registration of appointment of new trustees under will or settle-
ment.
LOSS OR DESTRUCTION OF GRANT OR OTHER INSTRU-
MENT; ISSUE OF FRESH CERTIFICATE OF TITLE OR
CERTIFIED COPY.
73. The duplicates of all grants and certificates of title are bound
up in the Register-book, each constituting a folium or page, upon
which the memorials of leases, mortgages, transfers, discharges from
mortgage, surrenders of leases; and all other dealings affecting that
particular piece of land are recorded. Whenever, therefore, a grant
or certificate of title is lost or destroyed a fresh certificate of title-can
be obtained, with all particulars affecting the title recorded as upon
the original; and such fresh certificate will be available for all
purposes for which the lost or destroyed grant or certificate was
available.
74. Before issuing such fresh certificate the District Land
Registrar will require the fact of the loss or destruction, with atten-


dant circumstances, to be authenticated to him by a declaration
subscribed before a Justice of the Peace, and such other evidence as
the proprietor may be able to produce. The District Land Registrar
will also give notice of his intention to issue such fresh certificate by
advertisement in the Gazette and in the local papers.
