To All Contractors Constructing Ships for United States Navy-
United States Maritime Commission:
As a result of the national conference on safety and health in ship-
yards holding contracts with the United States Navy and Maritime
Commission, conducted under the auspices of these agencies in Chicago
December 7 and 8,1942, a unanimous agreement was reached upon the
minimum standards which have now been approved by the Navy De-
partment and United States Maritime Commission and which should
be put into effect in shipyards holding contracts with the two agencies.
These standards represent a specialized study based upon a fact-find-
ing survey on all coasts by experts in that field. They have received
the unanimous concurrence of the representatives of the medical and
safety departments and of labor-management committees from ship-
yards on all coasts.
The necessity for conserving manpower and promoting the physical
welfare, health, and safety of what shortly will amount to one million
workers in shipyards requires that careful observance of standards for
the prevention of accidents and protection of health be accorded.
Aside from the weight which must be given humanitarian considera-
tions, it is simply good common sense that as much care and attention
be given to protecting the human factors in the war production pro-
gram as is given machines.
Under the administrative direction of the Maritime Commission,
safety and industrial health consultants will be made available in all
regions wherein shipyards holding contracts with the Navy and the
Commission are located.
Each contractor is hereby given notice that the Navy Department
and the Maritime Commission will expect full and complete compli-
ance with the minimum standards which bear the approval of the
Navy Department and the Maritime Commission, and each is requested
to give full cooperation to the consultants on health and safety who
will be charged with the coordination and supervision of the safety
and health programs of the two agencies.
The cumulative restriction of manpower makes speedy attention
and comprehensive action in respect to the subject matter hereof of
vital importance.

UNITED STATES NAVY—MARITIME COMMISSION
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
FOR
SAFETY AND INDUSTRIAL HEALTH IN
CONTRACT SHIPYARDS
S and H-l. Introduction.
1.1 The standards for industrial health and safety as presented in.
this manual cover only minimum requirements. It is not to be
assumed that compliance with these minimum standards is insurance
of the development of good health and safety records.
1.2 It is recognized that in many shipyards, standards for health
and safety are already in effect which go beyond the requirements
of those listed here. The Maritime Commission and Navy urge that
any standards of higher level be continued and that where substandard
conditions of health and safety exist, they immediately be brought to
the required standard or better.
1.3 In all cases the use of the words shall or must indicates that
compliance with that section of the minimum requirements is manda-
tory. Where the words should or may are used the section may be
considered desirable but not necessarily mandatory under certain
circumstances which the contractor in his discretion may determine.
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR INDUSTRIAL HEALTH
H-2. Medical Facilities.
2.1 Personnel. —Yards employing up to 5.000 men should have tw T o
full-time physicians, and one additional physician for each additional

3.2 First-aid treatment rooms, manned by nurses, should be pro-
vided wherever there is overcrowding at the main dispensary and
loss of time due to distance from shipways and shops. These sub-
stations may be located under building ways or near locations where
the number of men working is large so that the distance a man need
travel to a sub-station will not exceed approximately 400 yards.
H-4. Equipment.
4.1 The following equipment should be provided:
a. One ambulance for each 15,000 employees, or reasonable frac-
tion thereof, with an ordinary passenger car always in reserve.
b. In some yards a station wagon is used satisfactorily inside the
yard and an ambulance used only for trips outside.
c. An X-ray unit for yards employing about 5,000 men and above.
d. Medical and surgical stores required for minor surgery, eye
injuries and physiotherapy.
H-5. Records and Forms.
5.1 The following records and forms are recommended:
Note. — In an emergency no form, need he filled out.
a , A form authorizing the workman to report to the medical de-
partment for examination or treatment issued by a foreman or lead-
ing man or other supervisor. This shall show time of issue, arrival
at dispensary, discharge from dispensary and return to work.
h. Appointment form for revisits and retreatments issued by the
physicians and nurses.
c. A disposition form issued by physicians and nurses indicating
return to work, hospitalization, to home, or other disposition.
d. A complete and accurate permanent filing system recording per-
sonal data, nature and cause of injury, diagnosis, treatment, disposition,
and results.


e. The necessary state and insurance company forms.
/. Daily report to the safety department showing all new cases for
the day, together with the nature and cause of injury, and the diagnosis.
g. The adoption of the standard nomenclature when made available
by the Council on Industrial Health of the American Medical Associa-
tion, Chicago, Illinois.
H-6. Examinations.
6.1 Physical examinations to insure proper placement of employees
shall be given.
6.2 Periodic check examinations shall be given men working in
occupations potentially hazardous to themselves or others, as for ex-
ample to crane operators, locomotive and hoisting and portable engi-
neers. Periodic check examinations should be given men in jobs in
which there may be health hazard, as for example to sand blasters,
radium and X-ray workers, and paint sprayers.
6.3 Special examinations such as X-ray, seriologic and urinalyses
shall be given in the individual case as indicated and in accordance
with local needs.
H-7. Air Raid Precautions.
7.1 The medical department shall locate, equip, and maintain such
emergency first aid dressing stations as may he deemed necessary to
handle air raid casualties.
7.2 A certain number of yard employees shall be trained in first
aid procedures to render assistance to the medical department in
handling air raid victims.
7.8 Close cooperation should be maintained with the local civilian
defense officials in order that evacuation and care of air raid victims
may be carried out to the best advantage.
7.4 In keeping with local army and navy regulations, steps should
be taken to provide protection of dispensaries by sandbags, or other-
wise, from fragments and concussion of bombs.
H-8. Responsibilities of the Medical Services.
8.1 Frequent inspection of the yard by the medical staff shall be
required in order that physicians may become familiar with shipyard
jobs and thus help intelligently in preventing accidents and occupa-
tional disease.
8.2 Close collaboration shall be maintained with the safety depart-
ment especially in regard to records of accidents and absenteeism.
8.3 It shall be the joint responsibility of the medical and safety
departments through the supplies department to know the composition
of paints, thinners, paint removers, and other chemicals used in the
yard, and to see that the workers exposed are protected by the best
safety practices.


8.4 As in the general practice of medicine the confidential rela-
tions of doctor and patient shall be maintained.
8.5 It is certain that in the near future women in large numbers
are to be employed in the mechanical trades. It is necessary in ship-
yards to make special provisions for this class of patients. This will
necessitate the establishment of separate waiting, treatment, and
examining rooms. In yards where the number of employees is large,
it may be logical to establish a separate dispensary for the handling
of women patients.
H-9. Sanitary Inspections.
9.1 Cafeterias and canteens. —lt shall be the duty of the medical de-
partment to adapt from Army and Navy standards, in reasonable con-
formity with the local health department rules, and inspection scheme
to include preemployment examination of food handlers, quality and
quantity of food, general cleanliness and comfort, screening, dishwash-
ing, garbage and waste disposal. These inspections shall be made at
unscheduled times and never less than once each week.
9.2 Water supply, sewerage , and waste disposal. —ln cooperation
with Maritime and Navy engineers the medical department shall inspect
and report upon the above as often as seems advisable, but not less than
twice yearly.
9.3 Salt tablets. —Salt tablets shall be made available to all em-
ployees and shall be kept in covered dispensers appropriately located.
H-10. Respiratory Protective Equipment for Shipyards.
The U. S. Bureau of Mines, 4800 Forbes Street, Pittsburgh, Penna.,
maintains a laboratory which tests and approves for use in industry
respiratory protective equipment of all kinds. The Maritime Com-
mission and Navy will require the use of approved equipment through-
out all yards. The safety department shall be responsible for instruct-
ing men in the proper use of such equipment and for the maintenance
of ample supplies.
10.1 Details of Bureau of Mines respirators with names of manu-
facturers, prices, and descriptions can be obtained from the Bureau or
from the Maritime Commission.
10.2 The safety department shall be responsible to the management
for cleaning and sterilizing all such equipment as often as may be agreed
upon with the medical department. (A method for such sterilization
is included in these standards; see section H-12.0)
10.3 General requirements for respirators. —
a. Adequate protection as defined by American Standard Safety
Code for the Protection of Heads, Eyes, and Respiratory Organs.
Handbook H-24, Nov. 1,1938. Superintendent of Documents, Wash-
ington, D. C.; price 150.

ment and shall meet the suggestions of the American Standard
Safety Code for air-supplied respirators (sec. 10.3 a).
H-12. Sterilization of Respirators.
12.1 Each worker who needs a respirator should be assigned his
own respirator. Where this is not done, it is important that the
respirator be sterilized in addition to being cleaned. Adequate ster-
ilization may be accomplished by—
-511314—43 2


a. Washing the rubber and metal parts with soap, a brush and
warm water, after which the respirator is sterilized by immersion
for 10 minutes in a solution of formalin made by placing one part of
40 percent formaldehyde solution into nine parts of water.
b. Washing the rubber and metal parts with soap and warm water,
after which the respirator is sterilized by dipping in a 3 percent
solution of carbolic acid, a 2 percent solution of lysol, or a 70 percent
solution of denatured alcohol.
c. Subjecting the respirator to sterilization by a moist atmosphere
of antiseptic gas, preferably formaldehyde, for a period of ten min-
utes at room temperature.
d. After following any one of the outlined procedures, the respira-
tor should be rinsed with water and hung up to dry. The respirator
should not be used until it has been dried thoroughly.
e. The filters, felt screens, and elastic headbands should be removed,
if detachable, before washing or sterilization of the respirator, unless
it is evident that washing and sterilization will not harm these
parts.
12.2 The National Safety Council has issued an Industrial Data
Sheet No. D-Gen. 16, “Cleaning and Sterilizing Goggles and Res-
piratory Equipment.”
H-13. A Guide for Prevention of Industrial Disease in Shipyards.
13.1 Eight common types of disease and methods for their pre-
vention are given in the following sections. Help in applying these
methods will be given by the local Safety Department and by safety
and medical consultants of the Navy Department and the Maritime
Commission.
13.2 Flashbums and foreign bodies in the eye. —
a. Effects on workers: “Flash” is a surface eye burn resulting from
even momentary unprotected exposure to the welding arc. In this
condition the eye is painful and sensitive, especially to light. An
eye flash shall be treated only by the doctor or by methods he has
prescribed.
b. Foreign bodies in the eye shall be removed only under the doc-
tor’s orders or by methods he has prescribed. Like flashbums,
they are preventable.
c. For safe practice:
All workers:
1. Whenever near welding areas wear antiflash goggles which
have been approved by the Safety Department.
2. Wear safety goggles when grinding, chipping, buffing,
scratch-brushing, or forging.


Welders;
3. Wear approved antiflash goggles even when helmet is being
worn.
4. Use portable screens to protect the eyes of fellow workers.
13.3 Lead poisoning. —
a. Sources: In general, any job in which dust, fume, or smoke
from any substance containing lead is breathed daily.
h. For example:
JOB : WHEN MATERIAL IS :
Welding Metal, coated with paint
Cutting containing lead.
Burning Lead.
Shrinking Lead pigments.
Grinding
Bulling
Spray painting
Mixing paint pigments
c. Job can be done safely with:
1. (a) Special ventilation: Use a local exhaust hood approx-
imately 8 inches from the job and drawing at least 200
c. f. m. into the hood with filtration of the discharge, or
discharge, to a place where the contaminated air will not be
breathed, or
(b) Wearing of fume respirators, or
(c) Wearing of supplied air respirator.
2. Periodic medical examination which includes blood and
urinalyses.
13.4 Solvent vapors. —
a. Sources: In general, any job in which solvent vapors are
breathed. For example:
Spray painting.
Painting.
Using paint remover.
Applying cements.
Paint brush and spray gun cleaning.
h. Job can be safely done with:
1. Segregation of such work, and
2. (a) Special ventilation as may be required.
(b) Provision of spray booths with exhaust system.


(c) Wearing of special respirators:
(1) For spray painting: Supplied air respirators or air
line hoods.
(2) For other jobs: Chemical cartridge respirators.
(See H-10 on respiratory protective equipment.)
13.5 Zinc fume fever (zinc chills or shahes). —
a. Sources: In general, any job in which the fumes from heated
zinc are breathed. For example:
JOB : WHEN MATERIAL IS :
Welding Galvanized metal
Cutting Zinc
Shrinking Zinc alloy
Pouring zinc alloys Brass
b. Job can be safely done with :
1. Special ventilation: Local exhaust hoses or hoods located
close enough to operation at all times to remove smoke
completely.
2. Wearing of special respirators.
Note.— There are no known cumulative effects from zinc chills.
13.6 Fiberglas. —
a. Effects on workers: Men working with Fiberglas may develop
a dermatitis or conjunctivitis which are skin and eye conditions.
It is best to transfer to another job those who continue to be sensitive.
1. Both experimental and practical evidence show conclusively
that the inhalation of Fiberglas causes no lung damage.
2. The cement used with Fiberglas may contain a toxic solvent
such as carbon tetrachloride (CCI 4 ) which can cause severe
illness or, even death if the cement is used indoors with
inadequate ventilation.
b. For safe practice :
1. Clothing: Supply loose coveralls with collars and sleeves but-
toned over cheesecloth.
2. Goggles: Should be worn.
3. Shower: Should be taken rather than bath, at end of shift.
Respirators are usually not necessary, but if a cement containing
a toxic solvent is used, proper protection either by ventilation
or by a respirator must be supplied and used.


13.7 Ashestosis. —
a. Sources: In general, any job in ■which asbestos dust is breathed.
For example:
JOB: WHEN MATERIAL IS :
Handling. Asbestos
Sawing. Asbestos mixtures.
Cutting.
Molding.
Welding rod salvage.
h. Job can be done safely with:
1. Segregation of dusty work and,
2. (a) Special ventilation: Hoods enclosing the working proc-
ess and having linear air velocities at all openings of
100 feet per minute, or
(b) Wearing of special respirators.
3. Periodic medical examination.
13.8 Silicosis. —
a. Sources: In general, any job in which the dust of free silica
(sand) is breathed daily. For example:
JOB
Sand-blasting
Sand packing of pipes
Shot blasting of castings
h. Job can be done safely with:
1. Isolation of dusty process and, in addition,
2. Special ventilation: In the case of sand-blasting, the work
should be done in the standard type of sand blast room,
cabinet, or machine.
3. Special respirator for dust-containing free silica.
4. Periodic examination by doctor.
13.9 Dermatitis.—
a. Sources: Excessive or improper use of cleaning agents such as
gasoline. It is not at all uncommon to find dermititis caused by
excessive use of common soaps such as those used in laundering.
Cutting oils, certain greases, certain insulating materials used on
electric cables and conduits can cause dermatitis.
}). Job can be done safely with:
1. Precautions against excessive use of the causative agent.
2. Advice of the medical department in the use of protective
salves and creams.


H-14. Ventilation Standards.
14.1 Ventilation is required to control temperature and to remove
air impurities, as from welding and paint spraying.
14.2 The maintenance of proper working conditions shall be the
responsibility of the safety department, whose staff shall work in
close cooperation with the welding, paint, and electrical departments.
Air analyses and tests shall be made by the safety and medical
consultants of the Navy Department and the Maritime Commission
as may be needed.
14.3 Personnel of Department.—
a. Number:
1. The size of the ventilation crew will vary with the type of
ship, equipment available, etc. The head of the safety
department will be responsible for the organization of the
safety department or division.
2. There shall be a ventilation supervisor on each shift respon-
sible to the head of the safety department. Under the su-
pervisor there shall be a sufficient crew to inspect and
maintain good working conditions.
3. An EC-2 ship shall have at least one ventilation man aboard.
Larger ships, or ships like carriers with considerable gal-
vanized welding, shall have at least two ventilation men.
4. The number of ventilation men on the night shifts shall be
in proportion to the construction crews.
5. The ventilation crew must have available a maintenance and
repair crew of sufficient size to keep equipment on the
job and operating efficiently. Long waits during which
equipment is idle must be avoided.
b. Training:
1. The ventilation supervisor (that is, the safety engineer) shall
be trained to handle the entire ventilation program in the
yard. Local educational institutions, State Industrial Hy-
giene Units, Maritime Commission engineers, and other
sources are available to give this training.
2. The ventilation supervisor shall organize classes, demonstra-
tions, and short talks on standard procedures for ventilating
specific spaces on the ships.
14.4 Type of equipment needed. —ln ship construction, two types
of ventilation are used —local exhaust as for removal of welding
fumes at the point of origin, and general ventilation to supply fresh
air to confined working spaces.


a. Local exhaust:
1. A common length for a local exhaust hose is forty feet. In
ordering exhaust fans for use with local exhaust hoses, the
following specifications should be met; Capable of drawing a
minimum of 200 c. f. m. through each of 3-inch (or 4-inch)
diameter flexible hose. Fans should have provisions for at-
taching three or more local exhaust hoses per unit.
2. In the interests of power economy, it is undesirable to move
much more than 200 c. f. m. through each local exhaust hose.
h. General ventilation:
1. It is frequently desirable to introduce air into large working
spaces such as deep tanks, fore- or after-peaks. This is done
in many yards by using a flexible fabric duct, with metal
elbows, and a fan of about 5,000 c. f. m. capacity.
2. It is desirable sometimes to supply a quantity of fresh air
into the double bottom. Here a 2,000 c. f. m. unit may be
used.
3. These two examples represent the two extremes of this type
of work, and therefore are the two extremes in fan sizes.
Fan static pressures in each case should exceed four inches
of water.
4. For general ventilation of a ship engineroom during construc-
tion, a 10,000 c. f. m. blower is recommended. On the other
hand, operations in confined quarters where heat is gen-
erated (plate shrinking, for example) may use a small
portable fan to circulate the air. For this purpose, small
blowers of from 800 to 1,600 c. f. m. shall be provided.
c. Ventilating procedures:
1. Local exhaust shall be used whenever a welding operation is
being conducted in a confined space, or whenever galvanized
metal is being welded. Local exhaust is always a suction
process. Never blow a stream of air upon a welding arc.
2. Many welders think that it is enough to hold the end of the
suction hose in the same compartment with the welding
operation. This is not so. In order to capture the welding
fumes, the end of the hose must be within six or eight inches
of the arc, assuming a 200 c. f. m. volume per hose. Beyond
this distance, the suction hose is ineffective.
3. The air supply to a general ventilation fan must be fresh
outside air. Recirculation of air already contaminated shall
not be permitted. A minimum of 400 c. f. m. per welder
shall be supplied to a given working space such as a deep tank
when general ventilation is used alone.


4. In warm weather, air movements or drafts are helpful, while
in cold weather a minimum of air movement is desired and
local exhaust will serve best. In temperate weather, it is
most satisfactory to use a combination of local exhaust and
general ventilation.
14.5 Coordination of department with construction program. —
a. The ventilation supervisor shall keep abreast of construction,
and thus anticipate the ventilation needs.
b. The construction foremen shall inform the ventilation depart-
ment of ventilation needs before the needs occur.
c. Blackboards, boxes, signal lights, or similar devices shall be
installed on board and used to inform the ventilation department of
immediate needs.
14.6 Supplementary ventilating procedures. —
a. Ventilating confined spaces, such as the fore- or after-peaks and
deep tanks, is greatly simplified by the temporary removal or cutting
through of certain plates.
b. For example, the fore-peak of a Liberty ship can best be ventilated
by cutting a combination access and ventilation hole through the
watertight bulkhead near the ship’s bottom.
o. The tank top can be left off of the midship deep tanks until all
welding has been completed in this space.
d. A side plate can be left or cut out of the engineroom at the bottom
deck level.
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR SAFETY
S-2. Managements Part.
2.1 It is absolutely essential, if a successful accident-prevention
program is to be installed and operated, that top plant management
take an active and interested part in the work. The same supervision
given any other important activity in the shipyard shall be given the
safety program.
2.2 The responsibility of management insofar as industrial safety
is concerned shall be considered to include—
-2.21 The provision of a safe working environment.
2.22 Training of employees for safety.
2.23 Establishment of an accident record and reporting system

(or a safety director) and staff to install, maintain, and
properly supervise an accident-prevention program.


2.25 The issuance of instructions to all division or department
heads, foremen, leaders, leadingmen and to any persons
in supervisory capacity, that they are considered respon-
sible for preventing accidents which involve employees
working under their direction and requiring them to
comply with all of the provisions of the accident preven-
tion program in effect in the shipyard.
2.26 An active and interested participation in safety through—
(a) Review of, and executive action on, safety
records.
(b) Regular attendance at safety meetings.
(c) Action upon good or bad departmental safety
records through personal interviews with de-
partment heads.
(d) General letters, for bulletin board posting, ad-
dressed to employees and discussions of good or
bad yard accident record.

3.23 The staff of engineers shall be distributed over the three
shifts in proportion to the number of employees on each
shift.
3.24 One clerk and/or stenographer for the first 5,000 employees
and one clerk for each additional 7,500 employees. (It
is not to be assumed that the time of safety inspectors
or the safety director can be spent on clerical detail. All
office functions, while adequately supervised by the safety
511314—43 3


director, should be carried on by clerks so the greatest
possible amount of time of the safety director and his
staff may be spent in the shipyard.)
3.25 The duties and responsibilities of the safety director shall
include:
(a) Complete responsibility for,formulating, adminis-
tering and making necessary changes in the ship-
yard accident prevention programs within the
limits of authority granted by the shipyard man-
agement. The safety director shall also be re-
quired to correlate the shipyard accident pro-
gram with the minimum safety and health

certain of the safety committees. Permission
for such delegation of authority is expressly
given in the interest of efficiency and for training
the safety staff.
(n) Submission of the required reports on the status
of safety in the shipyard to the interested gov-
ernment agencies at the time and intervals here-

ACCIDENT CAUSE ANALYSIS FOR THE MONTH


representatives of the United States Navy-Maritime
Commission upon request.
S-5. Safety Committees.
5.1 The safety director, in cooperation with the shipyard general
manager, shall cause to be formed and put into effective operation at
least the following safety committees.
5.11 Central safety committee. —
(a) Membership: management representative (chair-
man), safety director (secretary), all superin-
tendents, foremen, medical department repre-
sentative, quartermen or leadermen, and one
employee.
(b) Membership of all but management representa-
tive, medical department representative and
safety director may be rotated—terms of 2
months each but rotation to be arranged so only
y 2 of committee changes each month.
(c) Meetings: Shall be monthly or more often as
necessary.
(d) Duties: This is the policy forming committee for
safety work. They review the monthly report
as submitted to the United States Navy-Mari-
time Commission and other records to deter-
mine the course of safety work for coming
period. They decide such matters as type of
safety equipment to be used and how it shall be
made available to men, types of safety training
to be used, whether accident prevention plan is
being adherred to, interplant contest awards,
etc. Such committees shall review the investi-
gation on fatal or serious accidents and make
recommendations. All Committee members
are expected to make practical suggestions to
improve shipyard safety. They also review re-
ports of other committees to make certain sug-
gestions and recommendations are properly
followed through.
(e) Secretary: The safety director shall act as secre-
tary, prepare an agenda, take minutes, prepare
a report of committee meeting, and distribute
copies of reports to members. He shall follow
through with other committees, the suggestions
and recommendations of the central safety
committee.


5.12 Supervisors' safety committee. —
(a) Membership: Management representative, safety
director, medical department representative,
superintendents, foremen, quartermen, and
leadermen. This is a rotating committee; ro-
tation should be arranged so all of the super-
visory staff serve in their respective periods,
i. e., superintendents change each four months,
foremen each two months, quartermen and lead-
ermen each month. In no case should an entire
group change at one time. Where a depart-
ment or unit of a department has an unusually
poor record then the responsible supervisory
staff—superintendent, foremen, quartermen or
leadermen should be retained on the committee
until their record is at least equal to the ship-
yard average.
(b) Meetings: Shall be monthly or semimonthly or
more frequently, as necessary.
(c) Duties: The primary purpose of this committee
is the stimulation and maintenance of interest
and the education of its members in accident
prevention. The shipyard accident record
shall be reviewed, the predominant types of ac-
cidents and the predominant causes of these
accidents shall be discussed. Suggestions and
recommendations to improve the records are
solicited from each member. At least one
timely subject must be discussed at each meet-
ing; i. e., such as eye injuries and their preven-
tion, electric shocks, hand tool accidents, etc.
Methods of avoiding accidents due to these
operations should be presented by the commit-
tee members.
(d) The committee shall review reports of all fatal
and serious accidents and suggest preventive
action. It shall review reports of inspection
committees and check on the quality of the sug-
gested corrective action for unsafe conditions
or practices reported.
(e) The committee shall carry out the suggestions
and recommendations of the central committee.
(f) Outside speakers such as safety engineers, insur-
ance men, State Department of Labor men or
men from other shipyards, may be used from


time to time to stimulate interest of committee
members in accident-prevention work. Sound
film strips, motion pictures or other similar
media on safety subjects can and should be used
if available and practicable.
(g) Secretary; Same as for central safety committee.
5.13 Regular inspection committees. —
(a) Number: One committee for each department
and each hull.
(b) Inspection: Weekly or more often as necessary.
(c) Membership: At least two employees and a super-
visory employee of each job being inspected.
The safety director or staff safety engineer
should accompany the committee.
(d) Duties: To inspect their department or hull for
the purpose of discovering and having cor-
rected unsafe acts and unsafe conditions likely
to cause accidents. On each section of a job
they should be accompanied by a responsible
supervisory employee. They are observers
only—the foremen, quartermen or leadermen
shall do all corrective work. Where a condi-
tion is discovered on which there is disagree-
ment the superintendent shall make the neces-
sary decision. Hazards immediately danger-
ous to health , life or limb shall be corrected by
the accompanying supervisor at once.
(e) The committee shall submit written reports to the
safety director and indicate whether accident-
producing conditions or practices have been
corrected. These reports shall be referred to
the supervisory safety committee by the safety
director. If necessary because of dangerous
conditions, he may refer them at once to the
general manager.
6.14 Special inspection committees. —
(a) Staging inspectors, electrical inspectors, crane
inspectors, boiler inspectors, and others.
(b) Membership: Specially qualified individuals or
teams permanently assigned to work. (See
paragraph 5.16 c.)
(c) Duties:
1. Staging inspectors: Daily or continuous in-
spections of all stages shall be made on each


hull—or other locations where stages are
used. Report shall be made of all defects to
the responsible supervisor for immediate
correction. Copy of the daily report shall
be submitted to the safety director.
2. Crane inspectors: Weekly inspections shall be
made of all cranes and rigging. Reports
shall be submitted to proper department
heads for correction of unsafe conditions or
practices. Copies of reports on defects shall
be made to the safety director.
3. Other inspectors: As above and at indicated
frequency.
5.15 Safety committees — General. —
(a) Committees in addition to those specified in these
standards, may be formed and operated if
desired.
(b) Representatives on all committees, when of a su-
pervisory status, should be appointed by the
shipyard general manager and held responsible
by him for active and interested participation
in the work of the committee. Employee rep-
resentation may be secured in the same manner,
or by appointment of employee committees,
union shop stewards or by election of union
members or by any other feasible means.
(c) The services of production employees having re-
lated duties may be taken advantage of on
inspection committees. Stage erectors or re-
pair men may serve as permanent and continu-
ous staging inspectors, a man or men from the
ventilation crew may be utilized for checking
on ventilation practices. The reports of state
or insurance inspectors will be considered ade-
quate on boilers, air compressors and receivers
or on other pressure vessels.
S-6. Employee Safety Training.
6.1 The time for the safety training of an employee to start is at
the inception of his employment. After a physical examination,
which should be made to make certain that the employee is physi-
cally capable of performing safely the work he is requesting, the man
shall have explained to him the safety policy of the company by a
representative of the safety department. This may be done indi-
vidually, in general groups or in craft groups and the instruction may


be supplemented by printed instructions in the form of rule books or
instruction cards.
6.2 Employees shall have in their possession, and be instructed in
the proper use of, all necessary personal protective equipment before
being started on any job.
6.3 General safety rule books, craft safety rule books or safety
instruction cards should be supplied employees. Such books should
be concise but complete enough to furnish written record of all im-
portant safety rules. No rule shall he included which will not he
strictly enforced. The assistance of United States Navy-Maritime
Commission safety engineers will be given in the preparation of such
rule books if desired.
6.4 All employees shall be instructed in their specific duties by
their immediate supervisor and they shall be made familiar with the
hazards of the job and instructed carefully in how to avoid them. It
shall further be the duty of the supervisor to constantly check all
employees so unsafe working practices may be corrected before
accidents occur.
6.5 Safety instruction shall be correlated with all apprentice and
craft training schools. Safety instruction in such schools or train-
ing courses shall include an explanation and demonstration of the
need for the safety equipment or safe practices specified and the strict
enforcement of all safety requirements in the classes. The instruc-
tors shall, by their own example, impress upon the learners the
importance of the safety requirements.
6.6 Safety bulletin boards shall be located at each hull and shop,
and at such other locations where they may be desirable, on which
safety posters, letters or bulletins from the shipyard management or
safety department and other safety material may be posted.
6.61 The bulletin boards shall be located where the majority of
the employees at a particular location will see them.
6.62 The bulletin boards shall be well constructed, have a locked
glass cover and shall be lighted at night.
6.63 Safety posters and other material on bulletin boards shall
be changed at least semimonthly or more often. (Post-
ers will be made available by the United States Navy-
Maritime Commission for the use of shipyards. How-
ever, posters may be selected by the shipyard safety de-
partment from any source.)
6.7 Where shipyard house organs (magazines or newspapers) are
established, the safety director shall arrange to have a reasonable pro-
portion of the space devoted to safety (articles, items and cartoon cuts
relating to safety will be made available by United States Navy-Mari-
time Commission safety consultants.)


6.8 Sound-film strips and motion pictures on safety subjects should
be used where practicable. Public address systems, where installed,,
may be used for safety messages to shipyard employees especially
during lunch hours or at shift changes.
S-7. Safety Supply Store.
7.1 A safety supply store shall be established in each shipyard
where safety shoes, safety hats, protective impact goggles and filter-
lens welding goggles shall be made available to shipyard workers.
Shoes may be sold at or near cost to employees, but safety hats and
impact and filter-lens goggles shall be issued to each employee but
shall remain the property of the company to be returned when the em-
ployee ends his employment. Equipment such as work clothes, gloves,
welders helmets, may also be stocked and sold to employees if desired.
7.11 Goggles may be stocked in the central tool room or first-aid
department but should be fitted as described in para-
graph 7.2 following.
7.2 The attendant of the safety store should be skilled in fitting
safety shoes, and if goggles are also issued, he should be trained in
proper fitting and servicing of goggles.
S-8. Goggles.
8.1 Impact-resisting goggles of a type suitable for the particular
job and also of a type meeting the requirements of the United States
Bureau of Standards, shall be worn by every employee exposed to the
hazard of eye injuries. Practically every employee in the shipyard,
with the exception of those working inside offices at all times are either
directly exposed to eye injury from the work they do, or indirectly
through working near operations which are likely to produce flying
objects. (See paragraph H-10.3a, page 4.)
8.2 Except where temporary lack of goggles make it impossible,
each employee shall have his own pair of goggles. If it is necessary
to reissue goggles to different employees, the goggles must he sterilized
after each use.
8.3 Goggles supplied employees should be carefully fitted to their
face to prevent irritation and to prevent the entrance of foreign
objects around the edges. (See paragraph 7.2.)
8.4 All employees working in proximity to arc-welding operations
shall be required to wear anti “flash” goggles, of at least No. 2-5
shade (or equivalent), of a type meeting the requirements of the
United States Bureau of Standards. (See section 9.1 on welding for
additional eye protection for welders.)
8.5 Welding screens constructed of wood, metal or other suitable
material shall be used to protect the eyes of workers in proximity
to electrical welding operations, whenever their use is practicable.


S-9. Welding—Arc.
9.1 All welders shall be made familiar with the hazards of their
work and instructed in safe methods of performing the various types
of jobs to which they are assigned.
9.2 Personal protection equipment used by welders shall include:
9.21 Welders’ protective hood provided with the proper shade
of filter type lens for protection against the harmful
rays of the arc and a clear cover glass to protect the
filter lens.
(a) The shades or their equivalent recommended are:
Up to 30 amperes—No. 6-7 Shade.
30 to 75 amperes—No. 8 Shade.
75 to 200 amperes—No. 10 Shade.
200 to 400 amperes—No. 12 Shade.
Over 400 amperes—No. 14 Shade.
(b) Shades may also be selected from the following
table:

(c) The welder’s hood should be inspected at least
weekly to detect possible light leaks, cracked
protective glass, or badly fouled or missing
cover glasses. Any defects discovered shall be
corrected at once.
9.22 Protective leather welders’ jacket, long-sleeved wool shirt
with buttoned collar and leather welders’ glooves and
safety hat.
(a) It has been found satisfactory in the hot summer
months to substitute flameproofed cotton shirts.
If this is done, the flameproofing, which must
must be reapplied after each washing, should
be done under the direction of the shipyard.
This entails that laundering also be done by the
company. Commercial laundries are rapidly
undertaking this type of work.
9.23 Hardened and filter lens protective goggles with sideshields
to be worn under the hood for protection against harm


ful rays where the hood is raised and for protection
against flying scale and chips. The goggles should be
of a type meeting the requirements of the United States
Bureau of Standards and of at least No. 2-4 shade or
equivalent.
9.24 Safety shoes or pull-on boots with cord or leather soles
and heels.
9.3 Welding screens (constructed of flameproofed fabric on wood
or metal frames, metal on metal frames, or plywood sheets joined by
rings) of a size sufficient to protect men working nearby from the
harmful effects of the electric arc rays shall be used on all electric
welding operations when practicable.
9.31 A type found very successful by one large company can be
economically constructed of y±' to %" plywood. Two
pieces about 18" x 30" are joined at two points along
one edge with 2" x %" rings. The large size of the
rings allows the two pieces to lap sufficiently to make a
lightproof joint, while the light weight of the assembled
screen makes men more prone to use them.
9.4 Welding leads shall be inspected at least once each shift, and
those found defective shall be repaired or replaced.
9.5 All welding leads should be coiled back to centrally located
stations after the completion of each shift or job.
9.6 Welding rod tips should not be thrown on decks or stages but
should be retained by the welder and turned in at the end of the day
for salvage.
9.7 Each electric welder shall make an inspection of the area be-
low him, and of the opposite sides of bulkheads on which he is work-
ing, to make certain that there is no danger of falling or penetrating
sparks causing a fire. He and his helper must know the location of
fire extinguishing equipment and how to use it. It is recommended
that a fire extinguisher be available in the immediate area.
9.8 The safety of women welders presents several special problems
which should be carefully considered while women are being trained
and during their first several weeks on the job.
9.81 Women will at first be subject to excessive fatigue because
they are unaccustomed to shipyard work. In their en-
thusiasm they are likely to overdo and will, under such
conditions, be more prone to accidents and at the least,
absences may follow. They should, until they become
accustomed to the work, be carefully watched by super-
visors and if signs of fatigue are evident they should
temporarily be given lighter work.


9.82 Work clothing for women is still in the development stage.
In general, however, the following should be observed:
(a) Safety shoes or pull-on boots with cord or leather
soles and heels.
(b) Long underwear, union suit type (wool for win-
ter) khaki trousers and shirt, or coverall type
of overall with a drop seat and welders’ leather
uniform.
(c) It is desirable that the outer clothing, unless of
wool, be flameproofed.
(d) Leather gloves.
9.83 Whenever possible, mechanical means of handling mate-
rial should be utilized in preference to manual handling.
S-10. Burners.
10.1 Equipment for burners shall be the same as that for welders
except that the leather clothing and welders’ helmets need not be worn.
Filter type lens protective glasses with side shields. No. 3-8 shades or
their equivalent should be worn. Flameproofed clothing is desirable.
10.2 All individual oxygen and acetylene and other gas lines shall
be turned off at the manifold at lunch hour and at quitting time or if
the burner must leave the immediate vicinity of his work during the
regular shift.
10.3 All hose should be coiled up to the manifold when shifts are
changed or when jobs are completed.
10.4 The practice of dusting the clothes by blowing oxygen on them
or using oxygen for ventilating or cooling purposes has resulted in
several fatalities and shall he absolutely forbidden. Oxygen shall be
used only in connection with burning or welding operations.
10.5 Each burner shall make an inspection of the area below him,
and of the opposite sides of bulkheads on which he is working, to make
certain that there is no danger of falling sparks causing a fire. He
and his helper should know the location of fire-extinguishing equip-
ment and how to use it. It is recommended that a fire extinguisher be
available in the immediate area.
10.6 Burners’ uniforms (overalls) shall be laundered at least weekly
except that if oil or grease is spilled on the clothing, it shall be changed
at once. It is desirable that arrangements be made by the company
to have uniforms (overalls) laundered and flameproofed.
10.7 Defective burning equipment such as torch, hose or cylinder
pressure regulators (where cylinders are used), shall be repaired
immediately.
10.8 All oxygen and acetylene (gas) lines shall be inspected at least
once each shift and those found defective shall be repaired or replaced.
10.9 Standard color coding for oxygen and acetylene pipe lines
shall be observed for oxygen and acetylene. (Since it may be impos


sible to secure colored hose during the war, identification may be made
by any practicable means so long as every burner and burner’s helper
or any other person who has occasion to use oxygen-acetylene (gas)
equipment is thoroughly familiar with it.)
S-11. Cranes (Whitleys, Hammerheads, Bridge, etc.)
11.1 The safe loads as specified for cranes on single lift shall not
be exceeded.
a. For the guidance of crane operators, weights of all sections over
5 tons shall be plainly marked on the section in figures at least 12 inches
high.
11.2 On double lifts, cranes shall not be loaded to more than 75%
of their combined rated capacities.
11.3 All crane operators shall be given a thorough physical exam-
ination upon employment and at at least yearly intervals thereafter.
Particular attention should be given to the eye examination.
11.4. Crane inspectors. (See section S. 5.14.)
11.5 All whirley and hammerhead cranes shall be provided with
bumper guards of %" wire rope or equivalent set from 32 to 36 inches
from the ground, and fastened in the form of a half loop to all four
wheel covers at the leading and trailing ends of the crane.
11.6 All traveling cranes regardless of the type shall be equipped
with a clearly audible automatically operated signal which will indi-
cate that the crane is in motion. A siren or electric horn pitched to a
tone above or below the general noise level of operations is preferable
to a gong or bell.
11.7 The crane operator shall take signals only from the designated
hook tenders or riggers and no others. Hook tenders shall be iden-
tified by special hats or arm bands.
11.8 All loads shall be lifted or lowered under power.
11.9 Employees shall not be permitted to pass between the leading
and trailing trucks of whirley cranes at ant time.
a. Wheel covers shall be provided which will protect all wheels of
whirley, gantry, hammerhead and bridge cranes to a distance of % inch
from the crane tracks.
11.10 Employees shall not remain under, or pass under crane
loads.
11.11 Trolley lines for cranes shall be protected against accidental
contact by men or material, by wood or other suitable sheathing, or
if the trolley lines are elevated they shall have a vertical clearance of
at least 12 feet above the ground.
a. Bumper guards for trolley ends of bridge cranes should be pro-
vided to prevent the hoisting cables from swinging into the trolley
wires.


11.12 The crane operator shall be required to immediately notify
a designated department head of any defects he notices in the crane
or its equipment.
11.13 No person other than the crane operator, a trainee, the
supervisor in charge of cranes, the crane inspector, repairmen on crane
repair jobs or safety department men shall be permitted in crane cabs.
No more than three persons shall be in the cab at any time.
a. Whenever possible, crane operators should be relieved on the
ground and not in the crane cab.
11.14 Except under emergency conditions and then only with the
approval of the safety department, men shall not ride loads. Men
shall never be permitted to ride empty hooks or slings.
11.15 A clearance of at least 2 feet and preferably more shall be
maintained between the crane and any stationary object or materials.
Where existing structures make this clearance impossible, an exception
to this rule may be granted by the United States Navy-Maritime
Commission Safety Consultant after an inspection.
11.16 Strong-backs or spreaders should be used on all lifts where
there is danger of the load buckling or where the spread is so wide
slings or clamps may slip. Steel strong-backs are preferable to wood.
11.17 The hook tenders shall familiarize themselves with the
weights of the various plates, shapes and sections handled, so chain
or cable slings of the proper size will be used on lifts.
11.18 All chain and cable slings and strongbacks should be clearly
marked, by color coding, to indicate the maximum safe load for which
they are to be used.
11.19 All electric cranes should be equipped with limit switches to
prevent double blocking.
11.20 Storage racks shall be provided for all chain and cable slings
at points convenient to the operations so they may be safely stored
when not in use. All chain and cable slings shall be inspected before
each use by the hook tender and if found defective, shall be sent to
the proper department for repair. Such inspections shall be in addi-
tion to, not substitutes for, the regular inspections by the safety
department.
S-12. Plant Housekeeping.
12.1 Housekeeping shall be maintained at a high standard in all
parts of the shipyard at all times. The following rules shall (or
should, as indicated) be put into effect:
a. Wide, well-defined roads, aisles, and passages shall be laid out in
the yard and shops and they shall be kept clear of obstructions and
shall be kept clean and free from debris. The width of aisles and
passages in some of the older yards may be limited because of exist


ing structures, but an effort should be made to maintain a width of
twice that of the widest hand or power truck, plus two feet.
12.12 Aisles and passages should be defined by white or yellow
lines painted on the floors. Materials or machines
should not be permitted to encroach on these lines into
the aisle.
12.13 All staging platforms, ramps, stairways, walkways, or
other walkway surfaces on shipways shall be kept clean
of all debris such as welding rod tips, bolts, nuts, and
similar material. Welding leads, burner hose and air
hose should be elevated over or placed under the walk-
way surfaces or protected by cross-over planks. They
should be neatly arranged and not left in coils or loops
where they may cause men to trip and fall.
12.14 All deck areas on hulls shall be kept free of debris and
construction material shall be neatly piled so as not to
present a hazard to employees. (See par. S. 12.13 on
hose, etc.)
12.15 All deck openings shall, as soon as practicable, be pro-
tected with guardrails at least 42 inches in height set 12"
back from the edge of the opening. Manholes may be
guarded by tacking three uprights to the deck and then
tacking a ring of the proper diameter to the top of the
uprights. Hatches, without coamings, may be guarded
by tacking uprights to the deck at intervals of not more
than 10 feet and fastening 2" x 6" or 2" x 8" timber
rails in place at 42" from the deck. Midrails set 21"
from the deck may be used also, and are especially rec-
ommended where women are employed.
(a) Where they are projecting stud bolts around the
manholes or tank tops, they should be protected
with either metal strips or wood covering to
prevent slips and falls or snagging of clothing
of workers.
12.16 All snow and ice shall be cleaned from stagings and plat-
forms (by turning the planks), and from decks, before
men on regular production are permitted to work on
them.
12.17 Free access shall be maintained at all times to all exists
and to all fire-alarm boxes or fire-extinguishing equip-
ment.
12.18 All oils, paints, thinners, solvents, waste, rags, or other
flammable substances shall be stored and used strictly


in accordance with the requirements of the National Fire
Protection Association standards.
12.19 All staging lumber, or other lumber, when dismantled
shall have all nails or spikes removed or bent over.
12.20 Plates and shapes shall be stored either in substantial
metal or heavy timber racks or stored flat on a substan-
tial timber or concrete foundation that will prevent
shifting.
(a) Plates and shapes shall be stored so there is at
least an 8-foot clearance from the center line
of railroad tracks.
12.21 Angle brackets and similar small pieces shall be stored in
racks.
S-13. Lighting.
13.1 A level of illumination should be maintained for the various
type of jobs in all shops, at least as high as that recommended by
the standards of the Illuminating Engineering Society.

13.2 All lights should be provided with reflectors suitable for the
type of work being done and meeting the requirements of wartime
dim-out regulations. A regular schedule of cleaning and mainte-
nance should be instituted that will keep the lighting units at their
original efficiency.
S-14. Hand Tools.
14.1 All tool rooms issuing hand tools such as hammers, sledges,
chisels, spud wrenches, center punches, portable air-driven tools, port-
able electric tools and other tools should be inspected daily by a safety
engineer to make certain that only tools in good condition are being
issued. Tools in poor condition shall not be issued.
14.2 Workers’ personal tool kits should be inspected at monthly
intervals so defective tools may be discovered and repaired.
S-15. Handling Material (Manual).
15.1 All employees should be instructed in the proper method of
lifting. No limit can be set as to the maximum weight to be lifted
by one man, but it should be made clear to all employees that they
should secure help if the load is too heavy or too bulky for one man to
handle easily. Mechanical equipment should always be used when it
is available and its use is practicable. .
15.11 Posters illustrating the proper method of lifting should
be displayed frequently and men observed lifting incor-
rectly should be reinstructed by their supervisor.
S-16. Machine Guarding.
16.1 All belts, pulleys, gears, chains, sprockets or other dangerous
moving parts of machines shall be completely enclosed with guards


constructed of angle-iron brackets covered with heavy sheet metal or
%-inch wire mesh. Vertical or inclined belts shall be guarded to a
height of 6 feet above the floor. Horizontal belts over 8 feet above
the floor may be guarded only on the under side. Gears, chains and
sprockets should be guarded no matter where located.
16.11 Since metal may not be available for guards at present,
substantially constructed wood guards will be acceptable.
16.12 In all cases where state requirements are more stringent
than those given above, the state rulings must be fol-
lowed.
16.2 All machines shall be guarded at the point of operation so
employees will not be injured while operating the machine.
16.21 The standards of guarding for the various machines as
recommended by the Insurance Eating Bureau should
be followed except where state requirements are more
stringent when the latter will take precedence.
S-17. Staging and Ladders.
17.1 United States Navy—Maritime Standards of Construction for
shipyard staging is in the process of development and will replace the
present recommended practice when published.
17.2 All staging, scaffolding, platforms and walkways shall be
constructed in accordance with the requirements of the California
State Industrial Commission except where existing state codes are
more stringent in which case the latter shall take precedence.
17.3 All ladders should conform to the American Standard Safety
Code on ladders.
