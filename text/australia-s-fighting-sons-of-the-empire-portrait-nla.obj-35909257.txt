PREFACE.
ORE than 300,000 brave men, between the beginning" of the Great
i i War and the time at which this volume is issued, have volun-
I— J teered to fight for Australia, for the British Empire, and for
civilisation against a most barbarous foe. Countless thousands
of these gallant Australians may find no other memorial than
one brief mention in a casualty list, and perhaps a lonely cross on the rocky
peninsula of Gallipoli, amid the shifting sand of the desert, or in some field of
I lance. I hey have made their country s name immortal, and they are mourned
by those near and dear to them ; but no further record is left.
An effort is made in this volume to gather the names and the stories of at
least some thousands of the men who put the word “Anzac’’ into all the
languages of the world, and earned for Australia an imperishable record in the
history of the human race. Great deeds are told in little space ; the mere
lepetition of a list of battles in which the soldier took part is a tale of bravery
and endurance for which time held no parallel.
Those who have lost some dear relative or friend in the great combat of
all nations, or those who with happiness and pride have welcomed home the
fiiend, husband, son, 01 brother who played his part in the tremendous struggle,
may alike greet with kindness the appearance of this volume, which aims at
making a record permanent, though slight, of the names of men to whom
Australia owes its everlasting debt.
Incomplete though the work must be, the publication of this volume mav
still afford an opportunity to the friends and relatives of every soldier to hold,
and to hand down to children and grand-children, a memorial of the great
deeds which the Anzacs performed, with the enduring printed record of the
names which each household cherishes.

grave is marked by a wooden cross erected by members of his
Battalion, who had found him to possess all the sterling quali-

and worked both holdings in conjunction under the name of
Menary Brothers, graziers. The land is situated 27 miles from

serious need of men, both brothers wished to go to the front,
but they also recognised that it was necessary for one to re-
main and look after the property. In order to decide which
should go to the front, a coin was tossed, and he won. His
Lieut.-Colonel, writing to Mr. Menary, said: “He was a very
same lad, and he died as he lived, a man.’’ Another of his
brother officers says; “Always cheery, he was a great help in
keeping up spirits during the weary winter months, when every-
one was very liable to get down in the dumps. Mr. and Mrs.
Menarv also received the following message from their Majes-
ties the King and Queen: “The King and Queen greatly regret
the loss you and the Army have sustained by the death of
your son in the service of his country. Their Majesties truly
sympathise with you in your sorrow.”
