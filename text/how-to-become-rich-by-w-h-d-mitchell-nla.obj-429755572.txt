W. H. M. begs to inform his friends and the public generally,
that he has arranged for the supply of a class of Medicines of
peculiar purity and excellence, and he trusts, by strict personal
attention to his business, to secure that patronage which he will
use his utmost endeavors to merit.
N.B.—As some prescriptions require considerable time in

cases of emergency will receive the most prompt attention.
Remember that MITCHELL’S is the Cheapest Drug
Store in New South Wales.
Has pleasure in inviting attention to the peculiar advantages
guaranteed by the system adopted in his establishment for the
dispensing of Prescriptions and Family Recipes :
1. The purity of all Drugs and Chemicals with which
medicines are prepared.
2. The careful and accurate preparation of Prescriptions and
Family Recipes under the immediate superintendence of the
principal.
3. The efficiency and trustworthiness of assistants who have
been attached to the business for years, who are provided with
every facility for the faithful discharge of their duties, and are
free from interruptions, the being entirely separated
from the other branches of the bu£^»&
4. The registering of an every prescription, by
which a reference, however remote” the date, is always obtainable.
5. The prompt delivery of Medicine within the city and

I have the pleasure of presenting to my friends and
the general public my Catalogue of articles and
prices, and, while thanking my customers for the
confidence reposed in this house for a period of more
than twenty years, I trust that my system of business
will not only merit a continuance but a substantial
increase of the favours already bestowed upon me.
I have arranged the prices in my Catalogue, so
that it must be clearly understood that there is no
margin for interest of money and that a bad debt
must be beyond possibility. My prices, having due
regard to quality, are, and will continue to be so
arranged as to meet the requirements of the man
who is prepared to come to market with his cash in
his hand and to receive his order efficiently executed
ivithin a few hours of giving it,
Again thanking my friends for their confidence,
and soliciting not only a continuance of it but their
kind recommendations.
I subscribe myself,
W. H D. MITCHELL.

pw m BECOME ipp!
IN the first place make up your mind to become rich, and
be resolved to succeed in what you undertake. Take the
plain beaten path of industry. A fortune is not to be made
at once ; it is made by the daily increase of small sums. Small
sums must, therefore, become objects of importance, and a
great value must be put upon them. Persevere either in your
present occupation, or the one you adopt. No one ever stuck
to any kind of* business no matter how unpromising, that did
not succeed in the long run. Every obstacle can be overcome
by diligence and assiduity. You may carry water in a seive
if you have patience to wait till it freezes.
Attend to your business and never trust it to another. Be
frugal, carefully avoid every extravagance. Remember, the
shilling is the father of the pound. Whatever be your income,
never spend it all, but put by as much as you can. Rise
early, the sleeping fox catches no poultry. Be abstemious—
be civil, never expect wealth from any other source than
exertion; never expect to inherit riches. “He who waits for
dead men’s shoes, will have to go a long time barefoot.”
Avail yourself of every lawful means of acquiring money, and
then turn it over to advantage. Take the first step —if ever
you are rich, you must make a beginning, and make it your-
self. Look forward with hope, and fight your own way with
prudence in one hand, and perseverance in the other. Above
all things never despair—God is where he was, and he helps
those who help themselves. Never say, “ I cannot do it.”
Try often till you succeed.
By following these directions, you connot fail to become
rich.

CELEBRATED
INSECT DESTROYING POWDER,
(SAME AS USED IX All MUSEUMS.)
This Powder is -unrivalled in destroying Fleas, Bugs, Ants,
Flies, Cockroaches, Beetles, Gnats, MOSQUITOS, Moths in furs,
and every other species of Insects in all stages of metamorphosis,
whilst it has no qualities deleterious to human beings, and is quite
harmless in its application to Dogs, Cats, Poultry, Babbits, &c.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
For Dogs, Cats or other animals, the powder must be well rubbed in.
when Fleas and all other Vermin will immediately fall dead. A small
quantity of it placed in the crevices of a bedstead, will destroy Bugs, and as
long as it remains they will not appear again. Dropped into the haunts of
Beetles, it stupifies them, so that they may be easily swept away in the
morning ; placed in drawers, chests, or wardrobe, where woollen cloths are
kept it will destroy Moth.
For the destruction of Mosquitos, Gnats, or Flies, the room should
be fumigated by igniting some of the powder on an old spoon or a
penny-piece- Where Insects abound in Green-houses, the same should be
performed. Farmers and Breeders of Poultry will find this Powder destroy the
Fleas and Insects which torment the birds while sitting, by sprinkling a little in
the nest and plumage of the birds. Sportsmen will find this an invaluable
remedy for destroying Fleas in their Bogs, as also. Ladies for their Pet Bogs.
Since it has been introduced into this colony, Mitchell’s
Insect Powder has obtained the highest celebrity, and by a large
supply now and in future constantly on hand, Mr. M. will be
enabled to meet the great demand by hotel and boarding-house
keepers, private families, persons going to sea, &c.

IMPORTANT TESTIMONIAL.
From the Sydney Mail of February, 28, 1880.
u COCKROACHES.—Having been a terrible sufferer a
year or two ago from these pests, I quite sympathise with your
correspondent “ Suburban.” The remedy, which is very simple,
is to obtain a few boxes of Mitchell’s Insect Powder, sold by Mr.
Mitchell, druggist, King-street, East. Place the powder in an
ordinary dredging box, or, what is better, a small sulphur-dis-
tributing bellows. Apply the powder at night time to all the
cockroach haunts, and, in the morning, sweep them up and burn
them. I would guarantee to clear a house, no matter how large
or how infested it may be, in a week or two. It may be well to
state that the powder also affects flies in a similar manner; and
anyone troubled with mosquitos may enjoy comfortable evenings
within doors by placing a small portion of the powder on a few
live cinders. The fumes, which are perfectly innocuous to
humanity, completely silence these summer pests.—J.G.”

MICE EAT IT READILY, AND DIE ON THE SPOT.
Directions for Using Mitchell’s Vermin Killer.
Sprinkle a little of the Killer on a piece of bread, well buttered, pass a
knife over the surface so as to mix the Killer well with the butter on the
bread, particularly round the edges. Lay the pieces of bread and butter in
the places most frequented by the Mice at night, and in the morning they will
be usually found attracted to the Killer as by magic, and be found dead
near it.
To Destroy Mice in Stacks. —Mix a shilling packet of the Killer
(which will be usually sufficient for a fair-sized stack for one dressing) with
about two ounces of nice sweet lard carefully mixed on the back of a nice
clean plate with a knife, then put bits of the size of a small bean into pieces
of clean white paper, about the size of the one on which the direction is
printed ; twist the four corners together to avoid wasting the Killer. Get
these pieces of paper thrust into the runs—which are usually under the eaves
of the stack—say one to two hundred hits to a stack, according to its size.
RATS are more cautious than Mice what they eat, and must he tempted
two or three nights with what is intended to mix with the Killer. If oat-
meal is used, place near their runs—for two or three nights—a little fine
Scotch oatmeal, tied in white papers ; if they take this, then mix a shilling
packet of the Killer with two ounces of oatmeal. If they do not eat this,
try Fish, Liver, or Raw Meat as bait, cut very small (nearly minced) ; as
soon as they are found to eat the baits, mix a little of the Killer with what
they are found to eat best. Rats usually die in their holes.

RECENT A AID EXTRAORDINARY CURE.
Icely Copper Mines,
June 2nd, 1873.
Dear Sir,
Having had a most distressing Cough, I bought
a bottle of your most invaluable Balsam of Virginian Prunes, and
I can assure you, with the first dose, I found immediate relief;
and the first small bottle completely cured me. Therefore, I have
the greatest confidence in fully recommending it.
Most respectfully yours,
THOMAS P. BIRCH.
To Mr, Mitchell, Chemist.
Macquarie Street, Sydney.
Sir,
I was suffering from a violent cold and pain in
the chest, brought on by excessive coughing, and having been
advised to try a bottle of your Balsam of Virginian Prunes, I did
so, and, on taking two or three doses, experienced instant relief,
and was quite cured before I had finished the bottle. I cannot
refrain from expressing my conviction that it is the most speedy
and efficacious remedy for affections of the lungs that has ever
been discovered; it only requires to be known in order to be
appreciated. You are at liberty to make use of this in whatever
way you may think proper.
I remain, Sir,
Yours truly,
G. MANNING.

IMPORTANT TESTIMONIAL.
Sydney, June 16, 1870.
Dear Sir,
I feel great pleasure in bearing testimony to
the good effects your Worm Powders have had on our little
boy. I can assure you they have acted like magic, having
brought away some hundreds of Thread Worms without in any
way weakening the system, and one from our eldest little
girl of unusual length. They are also invaluable as they
possess the additional property of preventing the worms being
generated.
We have also recommended them to our friends in the
country, who have found them equally beneficial.
I am, Sir, yours respectfully,

AUSTRALIAN
The need of a safe and perfectly reliable Cathartic or Purgative Medicine
has long been felt by the people and the faculty, and it is a source of great
satisfaction to me to be able to say that I can with confidence recommend
my Pills as a Purgative Medicine that combines all the essentials of a Safe,
Thorough, and Agreeable Family Cathartic.
They are not made from the common drugs that compose other pills,
but are prepared 'from the very best quality of Medicinal Roots, Herbs,
and Plants, the active principles, or parts that contain the medicinal value,
being chemically separated from the inert and useless woody fibrous portions
that contain no virtue whatever.
Among those active medicinal agents I may name Podophyllin, which
has been proved to possess a most wonderful power over the liver and all
the bilious secretions. This, in combination with other highly valuable
vegetable extracts and drugs, constitutes a Purgative Pill that is greatly
superior to any medicine of the kind ever offered to the public.
Mitchell’s Vegetable Pills will be found a safe and speedy remedy in
all such complaints as Asthma, Bilious Complaints, Blotches on the Skin,
Bowel Complaints, Constipation of the Bowels, Debility, Diptheria, Dropsy,
Erysipelas, Epilepsy, Fits, Gout, Headache, Indigestion, Inflammation,
Influenza, Jaundice, Liver Complaints, Lumbago, Piles, Rheumatism,
Sore Throat, Scrofula or King’s Evil, Stone and Gravel, Tic Doloreux,
Tumors, Ulcers, Worms of all kinds, &c., &c., attended by more or less
of the following symptoms '.—Frequent sickness, acidity or heartburn,
giddiness, headache, drowsiness and dimness of sight, spasms and flatulent
distensions, an uncomfortable sensation experienced at the pit of the
stomach soon after eating, with feeling of weight or oppression, tender-
ness of pain in the region of the liver, sometimes extending to the right
shoulder, with a short dry cough and interrupted sleep; a yellow tinge
of the skin and eyes is often perceptible ; the heart’s action is at times
disturbed, and pulsation felt in various parts of the body, with a s\ nging
noise in the ears and a sense of fullness over the eyes and back of the head;
the tongue appears covered with a white or yellowish fur; the taste be-
comes vitiated, the appetite impaired, and the breathing oppressed ; the
bowels are for the most part inactive, and there is much langour and
depression of spirits.
These Pills speedily remove the irritation and feeverish state of the
stomach, allay spasms, correct the morbid condition of the liver and organs
subservient to digestion, promote a due and healthy secretion of bile, and
relieve the constitution of all gouty matter and other impurities, which, by
circulating in the blood, must injuriously affect the action of the kidneys ;
thus, by removing the causes productive of so much discomfort, they
restore the energies both of body and mind. They are recommended
as a preventative against the fatal disorders peculiar to tropical
climates Their occassional use, if combined with the strictest attention
to diet, will be frequently found to remove at once, by their influence
over the secretions, that congestive and unhealthy condition oj the


liver which is so often the earliest antecedent of severe febrile and
constitutional disturbance. They may be taken at all times, and in most
diseases—lnflammatory, Intermittent, Remittent, Bilious, and every other
form of Fever, Jaundice, and Liver Complaint. For Dyspepsia they are
really an invaluable article, gradually changing the vitiated secretions of
stomach and liver, and producing healthy action in those important organs.
They are also invaluable for diseases of the skin, and for what is called
“impurity of the blood,” costiveness, &c., and, in fact, in every disease
where an aperient, alterative, or purgative medicine may be required.
In NO INSTANCE has this VALUABLE MEDICINE FAILED. If
any, for want of confidence or fickleness, discontinue their use too early,
and thus leave unaccomplished what they desired, are they to attribute the
fault to the medicine ? Certainly not ; but to their own love of change
and want of patience. Moderate exercise and abstinence from spirituous
liquors are recommended to hasten the recovery of the patient. It is of
consequence that the patient should have, in this changeable climate, plenty
of warm and clean clothing.
DIEECTIOUS
Indigestion, Impaired Appetite, —One Pill to be taken an hour before dinner.

with moderate exercise, cannot fail to produce the happiest results.
The best time for taking them is at night, but they may also be used
at any time of the day, in urgent cases, and where the Head and Stomach
are disordered.
