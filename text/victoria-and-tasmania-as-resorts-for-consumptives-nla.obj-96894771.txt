VICTORIA AND TASMANIA
RESORTS FOR CONSUMPTIVES AND
PERSONS AFFLICTED WITH
LUNG DISEASE.
By J. W. B A~R.~R.ETT, M.B. (Melbourne University.)
Demonstrator of Physiology in King’s College, London.
The number of persons suffering from lung disease
(chiefly phthisis) who are sent to the colonies for the
benefit of their health is and has been for some time
past on the increase.
The results ensuing are exceedingly distressing in the
main, not so much from any fault of the climate, or
rather climates (for there are many in Australia), as
from an absence of information on the part of the
invalids and their advisers as to the place to go to, and
the occupation to be followed when they reach it.
Seeing so many lives, as I believe, sacrificed in this
way, I have endeavoured in this paper to give briefly
and accurately the necessary information, for the benefit
of patients ordered to that country.
Taking, then, as the climate required for persons
suffering from lung disease one not liable to sudden
changes; equable to a high degree; not necessarily hot
or cold, but preferably temperate , it remains to be seen
to what extent these considerations are satisfied by any
of the numerous Australian climates.


For this purpose a brief allusion to geographical and
meteorological conditions is necessary.
Of those Colonies which are to the north of the Vic-
torian part of the river Murray, which lies between
latitude 36° S. and 34° S., little need be said ; for
although the inland climates are equable, they are
altogether too hot during the long summer to be desir-
able residences for delicate people. The heat, however,
though intense, is throughout almost the whole of
Australia very dry, and free evaporation is allowed,
otherwise it would be unbearable.
It will then be necessary only to consider the
climates of Victoria, Tasmania, and New Zealand,
which are all south of the 34th parallel of latitude.
Of the last named colony, the information I possess is
not based on personal experience, but accounts tend
to show that the climate is rather similar to that of
Great Britain, and if that be so, it as certainly not a
desirable residence for this class of invalids.
Victoria , situated as it is between the 34th and 39th
parallels of latitude, possesses unique geographical and
meteorological character’s. It is the most southern
part of the Australian continent, and is irregularly
oval in shape, the long dimension running from east to
west. It is bounded on the north by a large river, the
Murray, and on the south by the Southern Ocean, and
is completely divided by a chain of mountains into a
northern and a southern area. The northern area,
that situated between this great dividing range and
the Murray, is practically a wooded plain, traversed
by great rivers which run to the Murray. The south-
ern area, that between the dividing range and the
ocean, is an irregular slope to the sea.
Now there is a constant heating of the interior of
Australia by the sun, and as the ocean stretches from
the southern coast to the South Pole in almost un-
broken extent, it is easily understood why southerly
winds prevail almost constantly along this coast.
These winds are laden with water, which is deposited
on the southern area, and on the dividing range, whilst
but little reaches the northern area, which is compara-
tively diy. From time to time, however, either from
compensatory or cyclonic causes, fierce northerly winds
prevail, blowing therefore from the land to sea. These


hot winds are of excessive temperature, and correspond
probably to the sirocco. During their continuance,
from one to five days, the evaporation is enormous, but
sooner or later the cool southerly wind rushes in, and
a fall of temperature of as much as 50° Fahr. occurs in
a few hours, whilst along the line of neutralisation,
rain is often deposited in a tropical manner.
But this line of neutralisation is neither mathemati-
cal nor fixed, and is a broad area which travels from
the sea to the range with some velocity, hut it rarely or
never crosses the range.
Thus in Victoria are two distinct climates. The
southern , variable in the extreme, especially in summer
and often damp. The northern , equable and dry; in
fact, to agriculturists unpleasantly so.
It will then be seen that the one climate is the exact
antithesis of the other. In the southern I have known
the temperature in the sun fall from 140° Fahr. to 90°
Fahr. in two hours. It need hardly be added that
such changes usually occur in the summer, when people
are wearing light summer clothes, so that the results
to them are intensified. Melbourne, which is in the
southern climate, corresponds In mean temperature to
Nice and Mentone, but in no other climatic conditions
is there much correspondence.
In this southern area, and on the range, live the
greater part of the population of Victoria in the
cities of Melbourne (population 300,000), Ballarat
(population 40,000), Geelong (population 12,000), and
other smaller towns with districts. The only
city in the northern area is Sandhurst (population
36,000). But there is a large population on the plain,
particularly along the Goulburn Eiver, in the so-called
Goulburn Valley ; Shepparton, Mooroopna, Murchi-
son, Numurkah, and Echuca being towns so situated.
But of all the cities in the southern area, none
experience such sudden changes as Melbourne, and it
will therefore be of use to contrast the relative mor-
tality from phthisis in Melbourne and in the rest of
the colony, of which the total population is 800,000.
The Government statist, Mr. Hay ter, has been kind
enough to furnish me with the following returns,
which give the necessary information.

Deaths from Phthisis per 10,000 Persons Living
In and Outside Melbourne 1861-82.
That is, the mean mortality from phthisis in Mel-
bourne is 22‘15, in the rest of Victoria 8-88.
It has been urged that importations from abroad
have swelled the list. But the results are too uniform
to be affected by such a comparatively small and
variable element. So that evidence from this source
is strong as to the influence of the climate of Melbourne
in producing phthisis, and in assisting its progress when
present, probably by promoting pneumonic attacks.
It may be of interest to notice also that phthisis in
Victoria is actually increasing amongst males from
20 to 55 years of age, although their numbers have
decreased thus—
Deaths.


.. • • • •
In England and Wales the death-rate from phthisis
from 1866 to 1880 was 22*81 per 10,000 persons living,
and is therefore nearly the same as that in Melbourne,
but very much greater than that of the rest of Victoria,
and, judging from my own experience, infinitely
greater than that in the northern area of Victoria.
Further, the death-rate from phthisis in Melbourne
is much higher than that in any of the other Australian
colonies. But the death-rate from phthisis in the
other parts of Victoria is less than the total results of
any other colony, save New Zealand, thus—

22-15
Rest of Victoria.

Tasmania
10-21
New South Wales

12-48
All these figures then prove more or less conclusively
that the climate of Melbourne has a powerful influence
in producing phthisis, and conversely that the climate
of the extra-metropolitan districts have a less powerful
influence.
The death-rate from phthisis in the northern area
has never yet been obtained, but, as has been shown,
even when combined with part of that of the southern
area (extra-metropolitan) it is only 8"88. If alone it
would be in all probability very much smaller, and it
seems to me to be in every respect a suitable and de-
sirable climate for consumptives, in fact to all appear-
ance the most perfect existing.
Climate of Tasmania— Tasmania is an island situated
about 250 miles south of Melbourne. It is smaller
than Ireland and almost uniformly mountainous.
Whilst the climate is warm during parts of the year,
still, owing to its situation, the hot winds and the
sudden changes which are characteristic of the climate
of Melbourne never occur. But, on the other hand, in


winter the climate is decidedly cold, and snow, which is
quite unknown in Melbourne, falls frequently. Whilst
the summer is equable and in every way adapted for
consumptives, the winter is decidedly unsuited.
Tasmania, in fact, possesses a bracing climate, better
adapted for Indian invalids than any other class, and a
sanatorium for soldiers of the Indian army has been
established there. The mildness and beauty of the
summer induce the Melbourne people to flock over
in thousands during the height of the Melbourne
summer.
From this sketch it will be seen that all evidence
tends to show that the climate of Melbourne is favour-
able, not only to the production, but to the, fatal
termination of phthisis cases, and that the most suitable
climate for persons affected with lung complaint is
that of the northern area of Victoria for the whole year
or of Tasmania for the summer.
The low rate of mortality from phthisis in the other
colonies simply shows that their climates do not tend to
produce phthisis to the same extent that the Melbourne
climate does, but it does not follow that they are
equally suitable for such sufferers as that of the
northern area of Victoria. And, as a matter of fact,
they are not ; north of about the 35th parallel the tem-
perature is very great and the climate is very trying.
The first part of the question may be regarded as
answered, viz., a determination of the most suitable
place of resort.
The second, as to the occupation to be followed, can
be very shortly and definitely stated.
It is a very great mistake (where possible to avoid
it) to exchange sedentary life in England for a similar
one in Victoria. The object should be to seek manual
or outdoor employment in one of their very varied
forms on the sheep or cattle stations.
Such employment is easily forthcoming to the
willing, and is both beneficial and agreeable.
The influence on phthisical patients of some mild but
purposive occupation is too well known to require
comment, and this found is doubly beneficial.
If the summer should prove too severe for an
invalid, he can in 36 hours reach Tasmania and stay
there till the heat of midsummer has passed.


It cannot be too strongly insisted that no patients
should be sent out who are suffering from advanced
phthisis ; they should remain near home. It is for
patients in the early stages that the climate of the
northern area holds out such advantages.
To recapitulate. The following advice should be
given to patients in the early stage of phthisis who
wish to try the climate of the colonies of Australia.
(1) That they should, if possible, go out by the
fastest and best equipped steamers.
(2) That they should go to Melbourne and at once
travel north of the Dividing Range to such places as
Sandhurst or anywhere in the Valleys of the Goulburn
or Murray.
(3) That they should obtain outdoor employment on
a sheep or cattle station, or some similar place.
(4) That, should the summer try them, and the
practice of midday rest fail to relieve, they should
go to Tasmania for January and February.
That, however , in all cases they must remember that
their place of safety lies north of the Great Dividing
Range.
