MACKENZIE?S
AUSTRALIAN EMIGRANT?S GUIDE
INTRODUCTION.
Thousands of our fellow-countrymen are, at the present time, heedlessly
rushing on board any ship that announces its destination to be Australia,
and in doing so, in many instances, are making what might be a voyage of
ease, economy, and health?one of cost, danger, disease, and death.
It is not our intention to argue on the motives that induce people to
leave the shores of Britain, and seek a new home in Australia; we have
no class interest to serve, all we desire is, that those going may be able to
judge if the arrangements made for their voyage be such as they have a
right to receive in return for their passage-money, and with a proper
regard to health, for without that one blessing, the realization of the wildest
wealth would be useless. If a man contemplates going to the
diggings, and by muscular exertion wresting from the stubborn earth the
precious metal, what must be his disappointment on landing to find that
his months of privations at sea have left his body in a state of prostration ?
If he go to seek in the salubrity of the climate a restoration of constitution
and lengthened lifetime, how depressed must he feel in mind when he
discovers that the dishonesty of the shippers have shortened his path to the
grave ! If he go in the spirit of independence, that he may receive more
money for his work and more goods for his money, and on landing, from
want of good food and ventilation on shipboard, he finds himself the inmate
of an hospital, how distressing must be his mental agony! The root of
the evil is, at the outset of the voyage; and our intention is, therefore, to
give a few plain practical remarks on the subject, that the voyager across
sixteen thousand miles of the ocean may enjoy health, decency, and com-
fort, and land with his physical energies in full vigour.
We have taken a deep interest for some time past in the arrangement
of emigrant vessels, and are convinced that the greatest perfection they have
attained are those fitted out and given laws to by that great philanthropist,
Mrs. Chisholm, who was the first person to send to Australia independent
self-paid citizen emigrants, not mere labourers. This noble lady has had
no private interest to gratify ; in her arduous self-imposed duties, her first
consideration was provision for the health, safety, and morality of the emi-
grant ; her second, that these should be had at a fair cost, reciprocal to
interests of the shipowner and the passenger. We, therefore, have based
our advice on the system which great experience has led that lady to
adopt, and our little publication will be found a faithful and seasonable
guide to those who intend making the healthy and wealthy regionsof
Australia their future home.
CAUTION.
The recent revelations at a police court ought to put all inlending
emigrants on their guard against Emigration Companies. When we see
announced the expensive arrangements as to offices and officers of these
companies, and observe the flood of grand prospectuses, backed by long


and costly advertisements, and knowing that private gain is the object in
view, we cannot but ask ourselves where the money is to come from to
pay the outlay ; and arrive at the common sense conclusion ?the emigrant?s
pocket. A still more serious affair than the loss of money is the loss of
character and position ; therefore, let no young female answer any ad-
vertisement offering situations in families going to Australia. If they
think there is some reality in the tempting announcement, let them send
a male friend, who will strictly scrutinize the parties and the particulars
before they themselves appear; for on this subject we could make some
harrowing revelations.
CHOICE OF A SHIP.
The first- class ships are those that have been inspected during the
building, and are certified to be in a state of complete repair and
efficiency, by an inspector of Lloyd?s, and assented to by the Committee;
they are designated AI. Ships that are built of the same materials, and
are under the same supervision as A 1, but from partial deficiencies appear
not to be entitled to the same rank, are marked 11 A; that is, if kept in
perfect repair, they will be a first description of a first-class ship, eleven
years. When there is some little difference in the mode of building or
workmanship, they are called 10 A, which is still a first description of a
first-class ship. The second description of first-class ships are those be-
yond a certain age, and have not undergone such repairs as to keep them
in the first description, but are still in a condition for the safe conveyance
of dry and perishable cargoes; they are marked JE 1. In Lloyd?s list
those in this class considered fit for such cargoes ?to and from all
parts of the world,? are distinguished by the letters M 1, being printed
with red ink, and a star before them. Second-class ships are not thought
fit for dry cargoes, they are marked E. Third-class ships are considered
only proper for short voyages, and the conveyance of cargoes not subject
to sea damage, they have the letter I.
Now, the first-class ships of the first description, and those of the
second description with the star and red ink, are the ships that emigrants
ought to select. The size of the ships is of no great importance. We
know those who have often made the voyage, prefer one of about 500 tons
to a larger vessel, stating they had more comfort, and that the vessel sooner
recovered from the shocks given by heavy waves, whereas in the large ves-
sels they hardly recovered their tremor before another wave came, and thus
continued the unpleasant motion; from the same cause it is the opinion
of some, that small vessels are safer. As regards the latter part, however,
we need only state that during the last twenty years there has not been a
single Australian emigrant vessel lost at sea, which speaks highly of the
condition of our ships, and their skilful management.
Having ascertained the class of vessel, the next inquiry should be the
name of the owner, that it may be judged if he ranks as a man who values
a good character in preference to a heavy purse, as then he will not
permit any imposition on the part of his officers, for the sake of paltry gain.
One chief point, however, is the respectability of the shippers, for they
have to fit up and victual the vessel; if, therefore, they are greedy avari-
cious men, unknown in character and station, it is necessary to be wary,
for your health and life are actually in their hands. The question should
be asked, and, if possible, the truth ascertained, What can be had for money
on board when at sea ? and, if it is discovered that a store is laid in for


sale, depend upon it the rations will be short and bad, for the purpose of
treating customers. The fittings of the vessel must be learnt, o the
proper mode of which we shall advise hereafter, and also the ru.es to be
observed on board ship. Always choose a ship where there is an equality
of passengers, as then you will have the entire range of the vessel, an
not be confined to a wet small portion ~ , ? _ sll t _ ka
Another very momentous affair is the kind of cargo the ship will take
out ? this would be deeply impressed on the mind if a tithe of the suffer-
i?g ?recently experience!! by 1. emigrants, could be felt by those who
intend going on shipboard. Where the decks were too hot to be
trodden water, for six weeks, had to be poured upon them, to prevent their
bursting into flames; the emigrants, in the mean time, in painful suspense;
therefore, it behoves all to see to the kind of cargo put on board ; Govern-
ment provides positively against some kinds, but not all.
We feel certain that, if intending emigrants of a town or district were
to meet and sign their names as such, then announce they were ready
to negotiate for a ship, they would cause a competition that would pro\e
beneficial to themselves.
OUTFIT.
The following is that recommended by Mrs. Chisholm s society:
Knife and fork, table and tea spoons, metal plate.?Hook pot, inking
mug, meat dish, water can, washing basin, two cabbage-nets, one scrub-
bing brush, half a gallon of sand, flour-bag, half a Bath brick, two sheets
of sandpaper, two coarse canvas aprons, hammer,?tacks. Leathern
straps, with buckle, to secure the beds neatly on deck when required to
be aired. Three pounds of marine soap.
There is no necessity for these articles being new and made on purpose
for sale to emigrants, those that have been in use at home will be found
to answer all requirements. The knife and fork, spoons, or whatever else
will allow of having the passenger?s initials cut upon them, ought to be so
marked. Cleanliness being necessary to health, and order to ecmM, not
one of the above articles should be neglected. 1 assengers by placing
their shoes in a cabbage-net, and tying the net to the rigging, dry them
without the risk of their going overboard, which frequently happens when
suspended by the shoestrings. See Government outfit, pp. 29, 30.
Clothing. ?During the voyage the heat of the tropics has to be en-
dured when attention to the cleanliness of the person will be found the
greatest source of comfort. White clothing must at such a time be the
best; but as it would be wrong to expend money purposely f or a few weeks
wear, a little contrivance will suffice for the time, . Draughts must
carefully avoided. On the subject of clothing Mrs. Chisholm remarks .
? In reference to stockings, she observes that two pairs of good ones
were better than six pairs of bad ones. A supply of needles and worsted
was also essential. She would recommend every young man to take
such materials ; for both on board ship and in the colonies they would
have to mend their own stockings. A great deal of money was gene-
rally wasted in the slop shops, and great stress was laid on the necessity
of clothing for both hot and cold weather. She was anxious to expose
this fallacy. All that was necessary in cold weather was to protect t
joints, not to load the body with a great amount of extra clothing. An
old blanket cut up and sewed inside the waistcoat or trousers would be
found very useful. It was a delusion to talk of things being very dear in


4 Mackenzie?s
the colony. Women would not find it net
two gowns for the voyage. Thin slippers si
very ant to cove rold. In thplist r�f
the colony. Women would not find it necessary to take out more than
two gowns for the voyage. Thin slippers should be avoided, as they are
very apt to give cold. In the list of articles recommended by the society
to be purchased were cabbage-nets, which were the most useful things
that could be taken to sea, as well for cooking as for other purposes. One
might be used for putting children?s shoes in at night, and hanging them
up, by which means they would be dry in the morning. Coarse aprons,
Bath brick, and sandpaper were recommended to be taken, and numer-
ous were the inquiries what they were to be used for. Many who were
about to face the diggings, contemplated with horror the idea of cleaning
their own knives. Her object was that females, in particular, should
have with them every thing necessary for health, comfort, and cleanli-
ness, in order that there might be no pretext for interfering with them by
the officers of the vessel.? See pp. 29, 30.
Persons are laughed at in the colony if they take a number of pack-
ages, as they are believed to' be the dupes of those whose interest it is to
represent every thing there enormously high in price. It is sheer waste
of money to have boxes lined with tin or zinc, in vessels pronounced
sufficient for the safe conveyance of the most valuable silks. A distinc-
tion should be made in the luggage taken on board; articles that are not
required until the completion of the voyage being marked ? Not wanted
on the Voyageand other packages not taken into the cabin but occa-
sionally needed, marked ? Wanted on the Voyage.? The best method
is to cut or paint the directions on the lids of all boxes, as papers or cards
get rubbed off or effaced. For sewing upon bags or baskets parchment
is the best material. A carpet-bag in the passengers? cabin is better
than a box for clothes that may be constantly required.
Bedding.?! This is provided by the emigrant, and must be a mattress the
size of the bedplace, the Government size for which is 6 feet by 18 inches.
Mrs. Chisholm?s regulation of size for single births was 2 feet by 6 feet.
Testimonials. ?lt is found of great service as to the position of emi-
grants in the colony, to take out with them not only their registers of
birth and marriage certificates, but testimonials of character from their
spiritual pastors, magistrates, corporation officers, physicians, gentry, or
known respectable persons in business.
Tents. ?The enormous influx of persons to the towns in Australia
causes houses to be difficult to be procured on first landing, and there-
fore the emigrant ought to be provided with a tent. No inconvenience
is felt in the beautiful climate of Australia from such a slight dwelling-
plclCG.
Extras. ?Those who have money to spare may take with them a little
of the very best quality of lime juice, two bottles of wine, a bottle of
brandy, a ham, a few pounds of patent flour, a pound of arrow root, some
rice, tea and sugar, and a jar of home made pickles.
HEALTH ON THE VOYAGE.
The chief sources of this are personal cleanliness, cleanliness of
berths, wholesome food, means of ventilation, supply of water, and con-
venience for washings.
. Personal Cleanliness. ?For this purpose passengers ought always to
inquire if shower baths are erected for their use; and if not, get a written
guarantee there shall be accommodation for two, one for the men, the
other for the women; and if the shippers are too shabby to provide such


requisites, a small subscription will purchase them, or a good-sized co-
lander and a sheet or counterpane may be substituted.
Cleanliness of Berths. ?The bedding ought to be taken on deck, and
the berths thoroughly washed out not less than once a week.
Wholesome Pood.?The names of the contracting parties for supplying
this important department should be ascertained, that it may be seen
whether they are honourable and respectable men. The emigrants ought
also to have the privilege of taking down the marks on the casks, that
it may be proved they are receiving that which has been stated to be
provided for their use. Have part of the biscuits packed in casks.
Ventilation. ?Although insisted on by act of parliament, yet too much
discretion is left in the hands of others; and it is awful to contem-
plate the scene between decks in rough weather, with of pas-
sengers and the hatches fastened down. r lhe best mode is that invented
by Dr. Bowie, and adopted in Mrs. Chisholm?s ships. It consists of a
perforated zinc tube, placed along the top of the whole range of cabins
each side of the ship, and jutting on the deck at the ends; this carries oft
the impure air. A wooden square case, like an inverted spout, is carried
along the floor of the cabins, from stem to stern of the ship, the under
part of this is perforated zinc, and being at the ends above the deck, fresh
air is conveyed into every berth. At the tropics it was found, by experi-
ment, that between decks, with all the passengers, was two degrees cooler
than under the poop. A gentleman asked one of a ship?s whose
vessel was thus fitted up, how it acted : ? I cannot tell you how, sir, an-
swered the man ; ? but this I know, there are three hundred people here
who have just dined, and you don?t find any smell or much heat. \ou
woul d have found the place not bearable without it.?
Water .?The value of a drop of water is discovered by the emigrant,
when it comes to be carefully meted out to him; he should take care that
the quality is good and the measure legal. A very simple apparatus was
used on board of some of Mrs. Chisholm?s ships, for distilling water at
sea, by which sufficient was obtained for washing purposes, without in-
terfering with the quantity regularly allowed for dietary and other appli-
cations. Any arrangement of this kind enhances the value of a passage
in a ship so provided.
Washing. ?Passengers should insist on there being two days set aside
for washing clothes, and proper provision for their doing so; the wash
houses ought to be on deck. By having this regulation as to two wash-
ings in a week carried out, the expense in the purchase of clothing at the
outset is greatly reduced, and comfort and health promoted.
Dietary. ?The best scale was drawn out by Mrs. Chisholm, and
every emigrant should compare it with that furnished by the shippers of
vessels they think of proceeding with, as it is careful in respect to the
quantity being sufficient and fair in exchange for the money paid, borne
think the allowance too liberal, and engendering waste; but being found
just in that case, it may be applied to others. r l he quality was the very best.

pickles, ditto, 1 gill; mustard, ditto, half an oz.; salt, ditto, 2 oz.; pep-

infant, 1 gallon 3 quarts.
Where three children are taken as one adult, it is customary only to
allow provisions and space for one person ; therefore parents should make
a specific bargain to have for their children that quantity of food and
space requisite for health.
No female should carry the prepared food to the cook-house, as she
must then come in contact with the sailors and others lounging about
there; and, therefore, those passengers who respect female delicacy,
ought at once to prefer such a simple service.
THE VOYAGE.
This is a very serious undertaking for any young female who goes un-
guarded by watchful relatives. ? Who has not been shocked,? writes
Mrs. Chisholm, ?by the frightful details we have read in the public
papers, how orphan after orphan has been victimised on board emigrant
ships, by men calling themselves Christians; how modest maidens have
been brutalized over and insulted by those whose peculiar duty it was to
protect them.? It is painful to think how much truth there is in these
lines. The fact is, there must be strict regulations and some employment?
? For Satan finds some mischief still.
For idle hands to do.?
Plans for amusements should be entered upon. Schools for moral
and educational instruction formed, books be read aloud, or any method
adopted that will keep the mind engaged. In Mrs. Chisholm?s vessels,
the passengers were divided into parties, or groups of twelve ; young
men and young women were therein joined to married families, and thus
decency of conduct and language were preserved. A pledge was also
taken to exercise a parental control and guardianship over all orphans
and friendless children, and to allow them to share their cabins with their
own children. Also, to discourage gambling, and encourage some well-
devised scheme of self improvement; to organize and establish a system
of protection, that would enable their female relatives to enter an emi-
grant ship, with the same confidence of meeting with protection as re-
spectable females enter steamers, trains, and mail coaches. A maternal
superintendence was established, whose duty was to see that all young
females were in their sleeping berths at a proper hour, and not to retire
to rest while any girl was on the poop or the deck. They also had to re-
monstrate with any young female indulging in boisterous amusements.
The married people had always to be present at any meeting for enter-
tainment. Persons were selected to keep order on the lower deck, and
see to its being kept clean, to attend to the issue of provisions, keep a
register of the viands in the casks opened. No smoking was allowed on
the poop, lower deck, or abaft the main-mast on the upper deck. Single
men were not allowed to go abaft the main hatchway on the lower deck,
except during meals, No lines for drying clothes were permitted in the
cabins, or between decks. Knives and other articles were cleaned only
on deck. No ? shaving ? or dangerous and foolish demonstration was
permitted on crossing the line. These regulations we name as exemplary
to other emigrant vessels?conducive to morality, comfort, and health.

Australia is justly termed the land of contrarieties; the first impression
of change of circumstances that the emigrant feels, is as he proceeds east-
ward from the meridian of Greenwich, finding every three or four days
that his watch is an hour behind the sun, and that when he arrives at
Melbourne, it is ten hours slow by time there. The next thing is the
reverses found in nature; Midsummer being in January, and the depth
of winter in July; thus the spring months are September, October,
and November; the summer months, December, January, and February
the autumn months, March, April, and May; and the winter months!
June, July, and August. We see the sun at midday in the south, there
it is seen in the north. A north wind brings to us cold, there it brings
heat; a south wind with us hot, there cold. Our night is their
day. �
Climate. This is most delightful; and the emigrant on breathing it,
feels as if a load had been taken off his shoulders and mind; his spirits
become buoyant, and cheerfulness urges him onward in his duties. The
range of the thermometer is great, but heat has not that enervating or
debilitating effect that it has in Lurope. The change from heat to cold
is not productive of those annoyances felt in England, and the hot wind
blowingfrom the interior, and carrying with it small sand, is the only incon-
venience. This causes the blue pure atmosphere to have a hazy appear-
ance : but there is no particular danger from it, and few think it worth
while to return m-doors to avoid its effects during the two days it lasts.
Many a one travels, and, when tired, takes his night?s slumber under a tree
without injury. Ihe prevailing diseases of this country are there rare ;
slight inflammation of the eyes from the brilliancyof thesun may attack new
settlers, and injudicious feeding bring on dysentery. Old and middle
aged persons seem to take out a new lease of life, and many find a young
family around when they thought the period had passed by; while they
see the children they have taken from England spring up surprisingly in
manly stature and womanly beauty.
Emigrants from not finding everything exactly as they had been accus-
tomed to at home, feel at first some little dissatisfaction, and, John Bull like,
grumble; but always having, when industrious, plenty of choice food, this
soon wears off, which is greatly aided by finding themselves surrounded
by their own language, religion, laws, and monarchy.
Minerals. ?These are coal, gold, copper, iron, tin, and lead, Newcas-
tle coal, from the district of Northumberland, supplies Sydney, it is of a
good burning quality, but small and dirty in appearance. Copper is
found about sixty miles north of Adelaide; the Kampunda mines are in
Light county; the Burra Burra mines, in the district of the Razor Back
Mountains, forty miles north of Kampunda, they were discovered in 1845
and are the richest in the world.
Vegetation. ?The trees present a singular appearance; they may be
called evergreens, as they do not shed their leaves annually. The foliage
is thin; and from the leaves being of a pale tint, without gloss, and vertical
instead of horizontal, they afford hardly any shade, and grass and plants
grow underneath. The gum-trees are the most common and are gene-
rally of a large size, from these are procured Australian mahogany. The
cranberry and some other berry plants are indigenous; but the vine, peach,
orange, melon, and some other luscious fruits flourish. The apple, goose-
berry and currant bushes are also planted. Wheat, barley, Indian corn.


and vegetables afford abundant crops. There are a few forests ? Amid
the apparent sameness of the forest,? says M. de Strzelecki, may be
often found spots teeming with a gigantic and luxuriant vegetation, some-
times laid out in stately groves, free from thicket or underwood, some-
times opening on glades and slopes, intersected with rivulets, carpeted with
the softest turf, and which lack only the thatched and gabled cottage,
with its blue smoke curling amid the trees, to realize a purely European
nirtare ?
During a portion of the year the trees, rising to a height of 150 feet
are harkless half way up their trunks. There is a kind of cherry that
grows with its stones outside. Some trees have apparently rich-looking
pears, which it would take a hatchet to cut; and some have stalks that
perform the functions of leaves. Nettles, grasses, and ferns attain the
height of a tree, being fifteen or twenty feet in altitude, with proportionate
substance and expansion. Parasitical plants grow on the ground, and
native flowers have no scent, but are prized in England from their beauty
and distinctive characters, dhere are millions of acres of rich pasture
land sufficiently fertile to grow grain without manure; and sandy and
stony plains on which a brushwood grows termed shrub. When ? a run?
is found to have innutritious overgrown grasses, it is set fire to, and the
young grass that succeeds in its place, is decidedly excellent pasturage.
Animals. Opossums are of different sizes, from that of the kangaroo
as large as a man, to the smallness of a rat; they leap on their hind legs,
outstripping a horse, and have pouches in their bellies to preserve their
young from danger or the weather: one species springs from tree to tree.
an animal that the learned term Ornithorynchus paradoxus, found
in the mud of swamps and rivers, that has the bill and feet of the duck,
the body, habits, and fur of the mole; and the internal structure of a
reptile. The eagles are white, and the swans black ; the owls screech in
the day, the cookoo at night; the birds are beautiful, but songless, and
some have brooms in their mouths instead of tongues. The emu is
common, and the gigantic crane feeds on flesh and grain at the borders of
rivers and lakes. Parrots crowd the woods. Bees are without stings.
The wild dogs, called dingoes, are the great annoyance of the shepherds,
they are the size of a fox, but in habits resemble the wolf; they do not
bark, but make a very disagreeable loud noise ; they are hunted, and their
brushes ornament the cottage walls. The bat, jerboa, and snake are dis-
covered ; the last flies from man, but if pursued or injured, turns on
* its enemy, whom, when it bites, it poisons. Flies are amazing from their
quantity, and mosquitoes are very particular in their attention to strangers.
Where they sting ought never to be rubbed, as it only creates a swelling
and increased pain; but a little oil applied soothes the irritation. Sheep,
cattle, swine, and fowls thrive well. There are immense flocks of wild
cattle in retired districts, the progeny of those that have strayed away
from their owners and never been recovered.
Mountains. ?Those are at the south-eastern part, and are named the
Warragong Mountains or Australian Alps, rising from Mount Kosciusko
6500 feet high, oh the boundary line of New South Wales and Victoria,
and running along the east coast at from thirty to fifty miles from the sea ;
those in the parallel of Sydney are called the Blue Mountains, and those
further north, the Liverpool Range. Australia seems in great part sur-
rounded by mountains, from which there is a gradual slope of fine rich
land, and tracts of sand bearing coarse useless grass. The mountains


are very difficult of ascent from having on their sides steep valleys
ravines, and gullies, like great winding rents in the sandstone rocks.
Plains. ?The Bathurst are 1970 feet above the level of the sea; the
vale of Clvvyd, 2500 feet, and King?s Table Land, 2700 feet above the
level of the sea.
Rivers. ?These are but little known yet, and are thought either to flow
into a great inland lake, be lost in the sands, or evaporated by the heat.
The most important river is the Murray, into which runs the Darling,
Lachlin, and Murmumbridgee. It flows from New South Wales, and
Victoria to Encounter Bay, in South Australia. Few of them flow con-
tinuously; at particular seasons they swell, and spread over a great sur-
face, but afterwards dry up leaving some pools, and their bed forms a
highway for carts. The Murray, that is said to be 3000 miles in length,
has not even a navigable depth throughout the year, seasonally it over-
flows its banks to a breadth of thirty miles, fifty miles from the sea,
forming lakes Alexandria and Albert, and leaves a vast number of pools,
yet its current is extraordinarily sluggish, and it is only a few feet
deep.
The Natives are Papuans, negroes with crisp woolly hair. They roam
about living on the productions of nature, the chase, and fishing; some-
times they reside in villages. A few mingle among the settlers and aid
them in their labours ; others have settled down as bullock drivers. The
females are called ?gins,?and at times are tent keepers to the out-stationed
solitary white man.
Food and Clothing. ?Food is generally cheaper than in England, in
consequence of lesser taxation, and the abundance of flesh and corn.
In one house in Sydney, one thousand sheep a day will be boiled down
for the tallow, and the flesh burnt as useless. Government, certainly,
after testing it, found the quality so good as to pass an order in coun-
cil for its admission, duty free. Wood, water, and rent are the dearest
articles. Tea is from B \d. in quantities, to Is. 4 d. per pound ; mutton 2d.
One writer says he has seen more good mutton given away by the
butchers of Melbourne to customers for their dogs, in three months, than
the population of his town, Banff, in Scoland,would consume in six months.
In strange times, such as a desertion of towns for the diggings, and sus-
pension of the ordinary course of labour, there may be a great rise in
clothing, but generally it is nearly of the same price as in England. In
fact, the colonists find it cheaper to buy new than spend time in patching
their old ones. �
Agriculture is not such a science and system as in old countries.
Wheat, Indian corn, and potatoes engage the farmer?s attention. Wheat is
sown in March, April, May, and June, and reaped in November, December,
and January. As to crops, such as onions, peas, potatoes, turnips, and other
vegetables, seed is sown at whatever time is convenient, and thus are all
the year through to be had fresh. For miles the country will resemble a
nobleman?s park, trees only occurring in little clumps; but when any have
to be removed they are either dug round or felled, and afterwards burnt,
being generally much shaken and of a greater specific gravity than water.
They produce gums but jnot reisins. Oxen are chiefly used in plough-
ing ; and a wood plough, made of the hard native wood, is found cheapest,
and best for the particular circumstances of the soil. The ears of the
corn are only cut off, as fodder is not necessary for cattle, and therefore
would but increase the farmers trouble to cut it. Corn is not grown for


exportation, and therefore there is often a great waste. The vine for
wine and dried fruit requires litle attention ; tobacco for home use and
sale is raised on any spare plot of ground ; the mulberry-tree, both for its
luscious fruit and for feeding silkworms, is grown; the olive for its deli-
cious oil has been so successfully cultivated, that an export trade has set
in; cotton will rise into an article of care with the owners of the soil.
Coffee can be grown as well as in any other part of the globe; and we
have little doubt but the sugar cane will engage many hands. Oran-
geries dot the country; the fig-tree grows luxuriantly. Thus Australia
contains in the womb of jjie future a variety of employments in the
production of the necessaries and luxuries of life, that must lead to its
commercial greatness and wealth.
Squatters. ?These are persons who take a grant of land from Govern-
ment, called a run, for the purpose of rearing and breeding sheep and
cattle, principally the former, and who only attend to as much farming
as will be necessary for the wants of their establishment; but this they
do not in all cases trouble themselves to do. The rent is calculated on
the quantity of sheep or cattle it will support; if 4000 sheep, it will be
estimated at 10 1., and every increase of a 1000, 2 1. 10s. additional. Every
half year the stock is assessed at a halfpenny for every sheep, three
halfpence for each of the cattle, and threepence for every horse. The
lessee holds his right unmolested, and can from time to time purchase
the whole or any part at the rate of 1 1, per acre. When his lease is out,
he may demand preference over all others in re-occupation ; and if he de-
cides on leaving it, can claim for evident improvements. In this class are
found every grade of society, including the learned professions and scions
of the English aristocracy, many are ?emancipists,? that is, those
who were originally convicts. They are found to be in the majority of
cases well-behaved, moral, and hospitable; their anxiety appears centred
in having their families brought up virtuously and religiously. Mrs.
Chisholm, at a public meeting, instanced this circumstance by stating
that, in passing through the country, she stopped to look at an interesting
child, who had put its hand through a hedge to pluck a flower, but be-
fore doing so, looked up to its parent and said, ? Dad, is it a sin ?? The
father was a chained convict working on the public roads, and the sole
instructor of his child.
These runs in several cases are of such extent as to be a day?s journey
in traversing them; as near to the middle of them as possible, in the
vicinity of wood and water, the squatter pitches his habitation. The
houses are rough affairs, built of wood slabs, some of which the progress
of luxurious habits has caused to be papered out wdth newspapers to
prevent draughts; around it are railed in a plot for vegetables and grain,
a paddock, a shed for sheep-shearing, a store, barn, and stables, for here
the mere labourer purchases, and is as proud of his horse as any English
gentleman of his hunter or his hounds. The busy time at these runs is
during the lambing and shearing seasons. A set of the most restless
careless fellows, who like new scenes and society, who will not settle on
any particular part, but love a roving life unshackled by responsibilities
and monotonous employment, ride from farm to farm as shearers ; they
earn money rapidly and spend it more quickly. People who live in
towns and desire to increase their gains also proceed into the country
and aid during November and December, which is the season for this
branch of agricultural employment. The wool being packed is placed


on a bullock dray and taken to the best port, where being sold, the squat-
ter buys necessaries that his farm does not produce and returns home.
Outstationed Shepherds. ?Some of these live a solitary dull kind of
life, a rough bark-house is their nightly shelter, their companion a dog,
or perhaps two. They have charge of a flock of sheep, and their rations
are sent to them about once a month. The payment is their food and about
25 1, per year. Can it be wondered at that these men on receiving their
wages, and requiring but little clothing, rush headlong into dissipation,
and in one day find themselves minus the fruit of a year?s toil ? But on
reflection, which their position naturally forces upon them, they see the
vast treasure a wife would be to them ; they would then have a compa-
nion, a friend, a guardian of their purse, and receive more wages, as the
wife?s attention would be estimated at a certain sum by the employer.
These men are sometimes visited by the natives, who are harmless, by
times a ? gin? will take charge of the hut, and a call may be made upon
them by a bushranger, an escaped desperado of a convict, but this is of
very rare occurrence.
There are other out stations mostly consisting of flocks of two or three
thousand sheep ; in those there are two shepherds and a hut keeper. The
men saunter out in a morning with their flocks and dogs, drive the sheep
leisurely along to where there is pasturage, and make noontide the limit
of their journey, their resting-place for a couple of hours, and their dining
hall, canopied by the blue vault of heaven, and adorned by a tree or high
bush. They then return by another path, water their flocks, and pen
them for the night. The hut keeper cooks for the shepherds, keeps the
hut clean, moves the hurdles, and sleeps near the flocks to guard them
from the wild dogs. These shepherds require no training. Any consci-
entious man will do. One person writes that, in his district, there are
thus employed, ? an apothecary, a lawyer?s clerk, three sailors, a counting-
house clerk, a tailor, a Jew, a Portuguese sailor, a Cingalese, a barman,
a gentleman?s son, a broken-down merchant, a former lieutenant in the
East India Company?s service, a gipsy, a black fiddler, and a dancing
master.? Colonial employers, as well as soma in other places, are not
always noted for their honour in transactions with the employed. Mrs.
Chisholm, having met with several unprincipled cases, established a
registry office, where printed forms of agreement were signed by both
of the contracting parties. Wages were made to commence from the
time of setting out on the journey for the station, a specified time of notice
to quit service from either party, the passage money, conveyance of lug-
gage, the supply of flour and corn, and the quantities of fresh and salt
meat, distinctly stated. The rations were for a single man, weekly, 9 lb.
flour, 10 lb. meat, 2 oz. tea and l| lb. sugar. For a man and his wife,
with one child, 5 1, extra wages, 20 lb. flour, 18 lb. meat, 4 oz. tea, and
3 lb. sugar. The flour is made for use as bread, into what are called
? dampers;? they are large thick flat round cakes, baked on the hearth.
We can testify to their delightful sweetness; and they are said to be, when
hot and well buttered, most delicious, more especially when seasoned by
labour or hunger.
Stockmen. ?This is an exciting life ; and many a person brought up for
some grave and sedate profession, after once experiencing it, continues it
with all the ardour of our most noted fox-hunters. Every stockman
prides himself on being well mounted; he is seen on the wild heaths,
booted, capped, and spurred, without the incumbrance of a coat and waist-


coat, with a terrible whip in his hand, that he takes as much pride in
cracking as any French Jehu, and loves the music of its distant echo
among the rocks or against the mountain side. His employment is to
herd a thousand or more cattle; and he has a wife as his hut keeper, if
able to procure that scarce treasure. The cattle not being accustomed to
the early discipline of more densely populated countries, are prone to run
wild, and being afraid of man they fly his presence ; thus the stockman
has ever to be on the alert, galloping after his half-tamed charge, who are
apt to make a tremendous rush for freedom. To tame the cows, they are
milked as far as possible, which, if not convenient to use for dairy pur-
poses, is thrown away. The busy time of the stockmen is when the
cattle are driven into the farmyard, for the fat ones to be selected, and
the calves branded, that the owner of them may recognise his property;
then neighbours meet, and in this work aid each other. The danger to
the stockman is, that when in full chase of some of his herd, he may come
suddenly on some tremendous chasm in the mountain side, some deep
precipice, or projecting branch of a tree. O?er the hearth of the hut how
many hair-breadth ?scapes are told, and wonderful feats of horsemanship
recited ! while his wife loves him the more for the danger he has passed,
but often vies with him in skill, while the ambition of the child is to
emulate the daring of the parent.
THE ARRIVAL.
Employment is generally immediately offered, according to the capa-
bilities of the emigrant. This is often done on board the ship, before
the foot of the passenger touches the soil of his newly adopted country.
Many persons choose not to take situations until they have ? looked
about ? them, as they term it; this is a waste of time, a loss of money,
and often leads to spending the capital they may have brought with
them. We would advise that they at once accepted of a situation,
but only for one month, which would allow time to see what kind of
business best suits them, is most remunerative, and a knowledge of the
customs of the country might be gained. A house may not be to be had :
if the emigrant has a tent, he can pitch it on some neighbouring spot,
waiting until he be settled in his future pursuits, and has an oppor-
tunity to procure a dwelling. If the intention be to go to the gold
mines, the less time spent in the town the greater will be the saving.
Should any emigrant feel at a loss how to act, and he be at Melbourne,
Port Phillip, we are assured that in his dilemma, if he applies to Cap-
tain Chisholm, he will meet with a courteous reception and the sound-
est advice for the advancement of his interests. At Sydney, the agent
of the Family Colonization Loan Society will also render his services.
We would earnestly advise every man of capital who intends becoming
a grazier or farmer, to place himself, for at least one year, under some
experienced person, in fact, rather to engage himself as an assistant,
as by so doing he will learn how to avoid many errors and home-learnt
prejudices, and will not afterwards have to reflect that his experience has
been purchased at the price of his ruin.


EMIGRATION SOCIETIES.
The offices of the Government Emigration Commission are at No. 8, Park
Street, Westminster; S. Wallcott, Esq., Secretary. The terms, for
what is called a free passage, and class of emigrants forwarded, will be
seen in the document issued there and inserted at the end of this work.
The Family Colonization Loan Society was originated by Mrs. Chis-
holm ; and as conducted by that lady, is of a high moral tone, carrying
into practice Christian duties. Its aim is to send out persons of good
character, in comfort, safety, and with economy; not to permit the sepa-
ration of families, but to endeavour to have settlers in Australia joined by
their friends. In the colony it is called the" Re-union.? Young females
are most assiduously protected. Advice is most courteously given.
Money being sent from the colony to enable relations to emigrate, they
are sought out in every part of the kingdom. We have heard of a labourer
in Australia, remitting to this society 130 Z. for the passage of his mother,
60 years of age, and family. The Society granted small loans to aid in-
tending emigrants; but the unsettled state of the colony since the dis-
covery of gold, has caused these to cease. Every improvement that could
be discovered, to make the passage one of health and morality, was adopt-
ed. The passengers were all on an equality, having the range of the entire
ship. Some shipowners and shippers, we understand, promised to carry
out the same plans, the Society has for the present suspended the forward-
ing of vessels ; in the mean time watching over the system of emigration.
The endeavour was to elevate the moral feelings of the colony by de-
spatching independent emigrants of the citizen class, Mrs. Chisholm?s
address is, 3, Charlton-crescent, Islington; and 29, Bucklersbury. The
colonial agencies are at Melbourne, Adelaide, Sydney, and Van Die-
men?s Land.
The Committee of Australian Colonists, Poultry, London.?These gentle-
men give advice gratuitously from 2 to 4 o?clock daily. Their desire is
to promote the emigration of tillers of the soil, shepherds, and labourers,
being themselves generally landowners.
THE GOLD DIGGINGS.
The great philosopher Humboldt some years ago stated that gold, pla-
tinum, and diamonds were almost to a certainty to be found in the back-
bone mountains of a country where they ran in a meridional direction.
In 1844, our scientific countryman, Murchison, stated his belief to the
Government, from geological deductions, that gold existed in Australia.
The Dutch many years ago visited the shores of that continent, in search
of the precious metal; but not finding it among the natives, concluded
there was none. For some time past shepherds have brought in small
quantities, and sold it in the towns to goldsmiths, who imagined it was
the produce of some theft, purchased of convicts and melted down, little
dreaming that the parent soil in which it lay was within a few hours?
journey of their homes, and that less than a year of unskilled indiscri-
minate labour would send across the ocean to the mother country, the
value of nearly two millions sterling. The occupation of a digger is a
great lottery, one of hard labour and privation. Nevertheless, if non-
success attends the toils of the diggers, it is satisfactory to know there
is a wide splendid field of enterprise open to them in the bright land of
Australia, where by legitimate industry they may realize not only a com-


fortable living, but a happy and reasonable competency; gather around
them their tottering parents, their beloved brothers and sisters; and have
the joyful earthly happiness of seeing their offspring well fed, well clothed,
well educated, and well settled for life. While the mind becomes so
serenely attuned as to feel Christian love for man, and unruffled, un-
checked adoration for a beneficent Creator.
The discovery of gold has caused an immense change in the colony, by
a population rushing to a country craving for inhabitants. The morally
trained class now vastly preponderate; and many settlers who had ven-
tured on business on credit, and feeling the slavery of their position,
had retired for a short period to the gold-fields, have returned to their ori-
ginal occupations, released themselves of their responsibilities, and been
capable of entering the wholesale markets with cash in hand.
Geologists concur in opinion that the diggers cast away from them
many precious stones and diamonds, by fixing their attention solely on
the yellow metal. For the purpose of being more skilled in gold finding,
and to detect those precious stones if they exist as is supposed, we would
recommend a few simple lessons from some thoroughly practical scientific
man, which might even be given in writing; and as many may be too
much occupied to inquire whom to select for this purpose, if at such a
loss we can confidently name Mr. Holmes, 26, Alfred-street, Bedford-
square. Excellent lectures are also given on the subject at the Royal
Polytechnic Institution, London.
What is beyond the Blue Mountains ? was a question long asked in
Sydney, and a problem that exploring parties could not solve, as the bar-
rier was so impassable. In 1813, a drought took place, the cattle perished
from want of grass, and ruin stared in the face of the colonists, when
three young men named Wentworth, Lawson, and Blaxland, resolved
once more to attempt a solution of the secret stubbornly held by the
mountains. Travelling by the valley of the Grose river, and following its
eastward course, they penetrated the maze, and ultimately beheld a fine
pastoral district. Convicts were set to work, and a road named the Vic-
toria Pass was opened in 1832, farmers settled there; the town of
Bathurst arose, followed by Goulbourn, the land was mapped into coun-
ties, and the discoverers rewarded by a grant. This road has been the
high road to the first discovered diggings, in New South Wales. We
have heard of an old woman, who could never be induced to go beyond a
mile or two from home, being taken to the top of a high mountain, and
after looking about her exclaiming, ? Dear me ! what a large world this
is!? So did the child of the stockman, on the banks of the Turon, ex-
claim on seeing the living masses going to the diggings, ?Dear me! I
never thought there were so many people in the world !?
One hundred and forty-four miles from Sidney, and thirty from Ba-
thurst, is Summerhill, on a creek, that is, a brook, of the river Mac-
quarie. In February, 1851, Edward Hargreaves who had returned from
California, struck with the resemblance of the place to that where he had
been on a gold expedition, made a trial, and in April he announced his
success, on which he received a Government appointment. In May a
proclamation was issued, claiming the right of the Crown to the gold,
and offering to grant licences at the price of 30s. a month. Nine miles
further, in Frederick?s Valley, the property of Mr. Wentworth, gold was
discovered in the clay. The next great field was where Ophir is rising
on the banks of the Turon: the entire of these districts is found to be


auriferous. Mr. Clarke, the geologist, says it exists in granites in
the counties of St. Vincent, Argyle, Murray, Dampier, Wallace, Wellesley,
also in the basins of the Shoalhaven, the Murrumbridgee, the Hume and
the Snowy Mountains.
The road to the Diggings, in New South Wales. If the party about to
proceed there be at Sidney, he will have to go by steamer to Parramatta,
at the head of the Estuary of Port Jackson, here he takes the Great West-
ern Road leading to Penrith ; a little beyond which, at an inn near the
ferry over the Nepean, it is usual to halt having passed over thirty-five
miles. Arriving at the Emu plains, the ascent of the Blue mountains is
commenced through sandstone rocks. Twenty four miles. Hollow is
reached; then the Inn called the Weather-board Hut, where the mountain
cold is felt with some keenness. Blackheath, 3400 feet above the level of
the sea, leads to Victoria Pass, after which is the embankment over the
vale of Clwyd; after passing the last stream running easterly into the
Hawkesbury, water in the westerly direction is met with, and having passed
over 100 miles Bathurst plains are seen; and 50 miles further is the
town ; 30 miles from Bathurst, and 144 from Sidney is the noted Ophir
diggings. The channels and banks of water courses are the places where
gold is found deposited. The road is craggy and mountainous, difficult
for vehicles, and occasionally shepherds huts are fallen in with.
A gold digger writes : ??I have had plenty of hardship and hard work,
without making a fortune ; however, I made what would be called in Eng-
land good wages, ? 21. a week, clear of rations and all expenses, ?hut, oh,
what labour and discomfort to make that! I will endeavour to give
you a slight sketch of my expedition. I started from Mr. S ?s house
on a Thursday morning,?l forget the exact date, ?with a chart of the
road, made for me by a friend who had travelled it before. Fifty miles
from Sydney I crossed ? Razor Back,? a particularly high and steep
mountain. After I got over, I had, for the rest of the road, a distance of
one hundred and thirty miles to travel, over mountains and through the
bush, with few houses in the way, and some of them fifty miles apart, and
going without seeing a human being for a couple of days together.
Plenty of kangaroos, opossums, bandicoots, parrots of all species and
colours, and cockatoos, both black and white. They were new to me, and
their novelty lightened the tedium of a long and wearisome journey. I
arrived in Braidwood, a small village, fourteen miles from the scene of my
future labours on the night of the eighth day from the time I left Sydney,
and next morning wended my way to the diggings, situated in a gully or
creek between the mountains, and with mountains all round. There I
joined a party of three rough kind of characters, but honest, hardworking
men. The first week or ten days was a hard trial to me, handling the
heavy tools. I assure you, that for the first fortnight I never lay down
in the tent at night without every bone in my body aching as if it were
broken; but I persevered, and soon became hardy and strong. The
Government regulation and system of working at the ? diggings? is this,
?you pay to the Commissioner appointed by Government, thirty shillings
for a month?s licence, and get twenty feet of ground measured out to you.
Thus, a party of four, by paying six pounds, gets eighty feet of ground in
length, and the breadth of the gully or creek, to work, and no man is
allowed to put spade into the ground without paying his thirty shillings
a-raonth licence money. The gold is found at various depths from the
surface down to thirty or forty feet below it We did not get any until


we had gone down from fifteen to twenty feet, to large rocks called boul-
ders. When we were down about ten feet, the water came in upon us,
and two out of the four had to keep constantly baling. From daylight in
the morning till dusk in the evening have I frequently worked up to my
middle in water, and that water fairly poisonous, so impregnated with
mineral matter, that if it touch any place where the skin has been knocked
off in the slightest degree, you are very safe to have a festered wound
there, and one that you will not get well in a hurry either; it also affects
the eyes, no one escapes sore eyes ; mine are very much weakened, but
much better than I expected they would be at one time, from the state
they were in ; but I must go on with the digging. We open a hole
about twelve feet by seven or eight broad, and go down through the top
soil, red sandstone, blue and white clay, and some stuff like rotten
granite, till we come upon these boulders, ?we move them with crowbars,
and underneath lies the vein, a bluish kind of gravel, containing the gold
in greater or smaller quantities. Through our claims the vein runs very
thin?in some places not three inches deep ; and very poor?only a few
pennyweights of gold in 30 or 40 bucketfuls of stuff; but as yet we
have only worked the bank, and expect the bed of the creek will yield a
rich harvest. We shall not be able to work it till the winter sets in;
there is too much water now, caused by the snow melting on the moun-
tains. I think, however, when the water goes down, I shall have a chance
of making a odd hundred or two. A party, about 200 yards higher up
the creek, have, by the aid of pumps, succeeded in working the bed, and
with great success, making from thirty to forty ounces a man per week;
and they say the vein runs right down the creek into our claims, so I sup-
pose when the water goes down, we shall have our turn at making a trifle.
I will tell you how we procure the gold. When we get down to what
we suppose workable stuff, one takes a large round tin dish, called a
? prospecting pan,? puts a shovelful of the stuff into it, and washes it in
the stream running through the creek ; the gold, if any, falls to the bot-
tom, and you wash the rest of the stuff away ?100 specks in a dish is a
very fair ? prospect.? The stuff is then passed up in buckets and washed
in the cradle=-their construction is exceedingly simple.
? Your fare is coarse, and you eat your meat cooked almost any way.
You sleep at night on the ground, rolled in a blanket, with a calico sheet
to keep the dew off. As long as a man is willing to work, he can always
earn a living there, and has the same chance as others of making a fortune,
and there have been very many nice little fortunes made since the diggings
commenced.
? I saw many parties who came out from Sydney bent on making their
fortunes ; they came down to the creek, looked down in the holes, saw
men working up to their middle in water, then, thoroughly disgusted,
turned away, and returned to Sydney, without ever putting a spade in
the ground.?
The road to the Diggings in Victoria. Melbourne 587 miles west of
Sidney, is the town where the intending digger will most likely be when
he starts, he here enters on board a steamer to Geelong, 54 miles distant,
in the estuary of Port Phillip. As all go where the richest fields of gold
exist, the adventurer will make for Mount Alexander. Setting out on his
road, the first stage will be 24 miles distant, at the bridge crossing the
Werribee river. Twelve miles further he can rest at Pyke?s station, or
Collier?s, other threejmiles distant; and make a second stage of the Bush


Inn, Mount Macedon, twenty-three miles from the bridge. The next
day?s journey, the traveller will if he desires to reach the diggings have
to travel over 30 miles of not the best of roads, though much depends on
the season. Clunes diggings near Burnbank, are 75 miles north west of
Geelong. Ballarat in Buninyong is 25 miles nearer Geelong; here is
the rich part called Golden Point. Mount Alexander lies about 50 miles
north of Ballarat. The latest letter from these diggings on which reliance
can be placed, contains the following information :
? Melbourne , April, 14, 1852.
?In my last letter I intimated my intention of visiting the gold-fields
in company with Mr. ?, which we have accomplished, making the
detour by Mount Alexander, and coming down by Ballarat on Geelong.
The distance from Melbourne to the Commissioner?s tents at Forest
Creek, which is at present the centre of the diggings, is 75 miles ; but
Bendigo Creek, some 16 or 20 miles further on, which is a more recent
discovery, promises to be even still more productive and extensive. The
total population at the diggings is estimated by the Chief Commissioner
at about 35,000; but a considerable portion is migratory, and not half that
number of licences are issued,
?The gold is found both in deposit and in the matrix, a quartz vein
having been struck at about 20 or 30 feet below the surface, and traced
for some distance, which is worked successfully with no other tools or
machinery than pickaxe, hammer, and tin dish. It has also been found
in deposit in various strata of alluvial earth, clay, and gravel, and even
below the trap rock, leaving little room to doubt that the supply is not
likely to be soon exhausted, while the Mitta-Mitta fields, near the boundary
of the colony, on the Murray, are still all but untried. Neither skill nor
capital has yet been employed, and the result hitherto attained has been
by the rudest and simplest means.?
NEW EMIGRATION ACT.
In this act there is evidence of the Government having profited by the
experience and practical proof exhibited in Mrs. Chisholm?s ships of
decency, comfort, and good food costing no more than a negligent, cold-
hearted, immodest system. In fact, it was impossible for the Government
inspector to see and know what he did in relation to this noble lady?s
ship, and address the emigrants with such kindness and good feeling on
the subject, without making suggestions for their adoption at head
quarters.
The principal defects in this act are :
1, Space. ?Clause 11. Fifteen superficial feet for each adult is too
small an allowance of room. According to the nicest calculations, it
ought never to be less than seventeen superficial feet. Remember this is
all the room for the large common tables, the forms, and other necessary
fittings, all the space for sleeping berths, for moving about in, and which
has to contain the air for breathing. The Athenaeum, freighted by the
Family Colonization Society, allowed fully 20 superficial feet. This point,
of space, is of vast importance, and every person who pays money for a
passage ought to demand that not less than 17 superficial feet be allotted;
make rigid inquiries on the subject, and see that the agreement be not
infringed.
2. Cabins. Clauses 17.18. and 19- In those clauses the young men
have to be partitioned off from the other passengers; but where have the


married couples to sleep ? surely not among the young females ; and yet it
would seem so, for no legal provision is made for their berths. Think
of a body of young men unrestrained, left to themselves, and of the lan-
guage and scenes that maybe expected. It would seem too, that separate
cabins need not be formed, a regulation demanded by decency. Those
who are not government emigrants should be very particular on this point.
Hospitals. ?Clauses 20. The government insist upon the erection
of hospitals, but give no orders as to their position. On no account
enter a vessel where they are placed between decks. Only imagine a
person with a contagious disease in bed close to hundreds of others,
spreading the infected air, and one after another becoming its victims.
Then, again, the indelicacy of women who maybe becoming mothers,
near a crowd of thoughtless young men. When the body requires every
moment of rest the din of voices prevents the approach of slumber; the
fumes of steaming dishes makes the poor invalid worse ; and should death
pay a visit, how awful and alarming to the surrounding closely packed
living mass. The hospital ought to be under the poop, near the doctor?s
cabin, and removed from the other passengers.

NOTICE TO PASSENGERS.
1. If the ship do not proceed to sea on the day specified above, passen-
gers, if ready to go on board, are entitled to subsistence money at the
rate of Is. a day per statute adult (each person of fourteen, or two children
between one and fourteen years of age, being reckoned as a statute adult)
for each day of delay until the final departure of the ship; but if the pas-
sengers are lodged and maintained in any establishment under the super-
intendence of the Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners, the
Is a day is payable to the emigration officer at the port of embarkation.
In either case the money may be recovered by summary process before
magistrates. If, however, the ship is unavoidably detained by wind or
weather, and if the passengers be maintained on board in the same man-
ner as if the voyage had recommenced, no subsistence money is payable.

NOTICE TO PERSONS DESIROUS OF PURCHASING LAND
IN VAN DIEMEN?S LAND.
Her Majesty?s Government being anxious to encourage the settlement
in Van Diemen?s Land of small capitalists and persons capable of em-
ploying labour, the Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners have
been directed to make known the following arrangements which her Ma-
jesty?s Government have sanctioned for that purpose :
1. The Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners will be ready to
receive deposits from persons desirous of emigrating to, and settling in
Van Diemen?s Land, in sums of not less than 200/., to be paid to the credit
of the Commissioners at the Bank of England, or any of its branches;
and the Commissioners will grant in exchange for such deposit, a ?re-
mission certificate,? for a sum equal to double the amount of the deposit,
which certificate will be available as so much cash in the purchase of
Government land in the colony, if presented at the proper office in the
colony within 18 months of its date.
2. Parties making such deposit will further be entitled to free passages
(intermediate or steerage) to Hobart Town, for themselves, their families,
and servants; provided that the whole cost of such passages shall not
exceed two-thirds of the amount of the deposit. Depositors desirous of
being furnished with cabin, instead of intermediate passages, 'may take
advantage of this condition by paying the difference of expense out of
their own funds.
3. Depositors must at the time of making the deposit obtain from the
Bank of England, or the branch in which the deposit is made, a receipt
o be produced to the Commissioners as the voucher of the payment.
4. Depositors when applying for their ? remission certificates,? must
at the same time submit to the Commissioners the name and de-
scription of the persons nominated for free passages, otherwise the pri-
vilege will be forfeited, and persons so nominated will nevertheless be
subject to the approval of the Commissioners. Any loss which they
may experience by the neglect or default of the depositor, or his nomi-
nees, either to come forward at the proper time for embarkation, or in
any other respect, must be borne by the depositor, and any expense so
incurred will be defrayed out of the sum which he may be entitled to
have spent in emigration.
5. The object of the above regulations being to encourage the per-
manent settlement in Van Diemen?s Land of a class of small capitalists,
and it being necessary to prevent persons who have no intention of
settling there from taking advantage of them, depositors who shall pro-
ceed to Van Diemen?s Land under these regulations, will not, for the
space of two years from making use of their ? remission certifiates,?
receive a Crown grant for any land purchased by such certificates; but
will, in the mean time, receive a ? location ticket.? At the expiration of
two years, the depositor on showing to the satisfaction of the Governor
that he is bond fide a resident settler in the colony, and has so resided
continuously since obtaining his ?location ticket,? will be entitled to
a Crown grant in exchange for it. If, however, application should not be
made for the exchange of the ?location ticket? within 12 months from
the expiration of the two years for which it is granted, it will be considered
to have lapsed, and the land will be open to sale or grant.
6. In the event, however, of the purchase of land which would pro-
bably be included in a single grant, partly by means of a ?remission


certificate,? and partly in cash, the Lieutenant-Governor will be autho-
rized, provided the amount paid in cash be not less than half of the
nominal value of the ? remission certificate,? and provided also he be
satisfied of the good faith of the transaction, to issue a grant for the
whole at the expiration of one year from the date of purchase.
7. It will be seen, that the above regulations are intended to apply
only to persons having capital enough to enter on the cultivation of a
tolerably large property. To such parties Van Diemen?s Land, from its
healthy climate, productive soil, and cheap labour, offers every prospect
of success. But persons not possessed of capital, nor accustomed to
agricultural or pastoral pursuits, should, for their own sakes, abstain
from taking advantage of arrangements which are not designed for them,
and for which they are not suited. Otherwise, they can scarcely fail to
meet with disappointment and pecuniary loss. By order of the board,
S. WALCOTT, Secretary.

Circular,? calling for the contribution required by Article 8, and point-
ing out how the money is to be paid. After it is paid, they will, as soon

14. The Commissioners supply provisions, medical attendance and
cooking utensils at their depot and on board the ship. Also, new* mat-

15. The emigrants must bring their own clothing, which will be in-
spected at the port by an officer of the Commissioners ; and they will not
be allowed to embark unless they have a sufficient stock for the voyage,
nor less for each person than,?for Males, six shirts, six pairs stockings,
two ditto shoes, two complete suits of exterior clothing; for Females, six
shifts, two flannel petticoats, six pairs stockings, two ditto shoes, two
gowns,?with sheets, towels, and soap. But the larger the stock of
clothing, the better for health and comfort during the voyage, which
usually lasts about four months ; and as the emigrants have always to pass
through very hot and very cold weather, they should be prepared for
both; two or three serge shirts for men, and flannel for women and chil-
dren, are strongly recommended.
16 The emigrants should take out with them the necessary tools ot
their?trades that are not bulky. But the whole quantity of baggage
for each adult must not measure more than 20 cubic or solid feet, nor
exceed half a ton in weight. It must be closely packed in one or more
boxes ; but no box must exceed in size 10 cubic feet. Large packages
and extra baggage, if it can be taken at ail, must be paid for. Mat-
tresses and feather beds will in no case be taken.
17. On arrival in the colony the emigrants will be at perfect liberty to
engage themselves to any one willing to employ them, and to make their
own "bargain for wages; but if they quit the colony within four years
after landing, they must repay to the Colonial Government a propor-
tionate part of their passage money, at the rate of 3 1, per adult, for each
year wanting to complete four years'residence.
18. All applications should be addressed, post paid, to S. Walcott,
Esq.. No. 9. Paik Street, Westminster. By Order of the board,

1. No fee or gratuity whatever is to be given to any officer or agent of
the Commissioners on any pretence whatsoever. The agents are not em-
ployed by the Commissioners to receive money. If, therefore, applicants
make their payments through agents, instead of in the manner pointed out
in the ? Approval Circular,? it must be at their own risk, and the Com-
missioners will in no way be responsible.
2. The filling up of the forms confers no claim whatever to a passage, and
the Commissioners do not pledge themselves to accept applicants, al-
though they may come within the regulations. Applicants are warned,
therefore, not to consider that a passage can be granted to them, unless
they are called upon by notice from the secretary to make the payments
mentioned in the Bth article of the regulations on page 29. Before
they receive such notice, they are on no account to quit their employment,
or make any preparation for departure, as it may be some time before
their cases can be considered. Those persons who disregard this warning,
will do so at their own risk, and will have no claim whatever on the Com-
missioners.?N.B. The agents of the board have no authority to promise
passages. .
3. If this paper contains any false statements, or false signatures, the
party will not only forfeit his deposit, and all claim to a passage, but also
render himself liable, under ?The Passengers Act, 1849,? to a penalty
not exceeding fifty pounds. .

be permitted to embark. (See 12th regulation.)

up exactly according to the directions given above. No erasures or muti-
lations must be made. By order of the board,
