SUMS
When mother makes me do my sums
I sit for hours and hours,
And try my hardest not to see
The garden and the flowers,
And not to watch the kittens play,
And not to hear the noise
The locust makes that’s just been caught
By naughty little boys,
And not to wonder when at last
The picnic day will come .
And then I find I haven’t done
A quarter of my sum.
I lick my pencil very hard
And start again—but oo !
I sometimes wish I was a bird
That hasn’t sums to do.


THE BIRTHDAY CAKE
Once I had a birthday and a lovely birthday cake,
Icing on it, candles on it, and my name in pink ;
Then I went to bed and dreamt that I was wide awake.
Looking at my birthday cake, and oh! what do you think ?
From the hole the knife had made with cutting slices out
Crawled a kind of dragon-thing with horns upon his head,
When he saw me watching him he gave a norful shout,
“ Who are you that dare to break my house to bits ?”
he said.
Then he plucked the candles out and waved them in the
air;
Little wicked sparks flew from them ; then he seized the
knife.
Sharpened it upon his claws and caught me by the hair.
Crying in that norful voice, “ Your money or your life !”
So I took a teacup and I bashed him good and hard,
(They were Mummy’s party cups, but what was I to do ?)
And he said, “ You never thanked me for the birthday
card.”
And I woke, and I was glad to find it wasn’t true.


PUSSY’S CHRISTMAS TREE
Pussy had a Christmas Tree,
It was a pussy-willow;
We tied upon the strongest bough
A lovely little pillow.
Soft and grey, like Pussy’s fur,
To he on in the house;
And a jar of cream for her,
And a choc’late mouse.
Pussy loved her Christmas Tree
And all the cream she fed off;
She didn’t like the mouse so much
And nearly broke its head off;
She only ate a tiny bit.
So I said to Brother,
“You can eat one half of it
And I’ll eat the other.”

FAIRY WAYS
When fairies sleep
Their pretty eyelids close
To crickets’ music, and a fallen rose
Gives her sweet petals as a coverlet
For green-leaf beds in flowery borders set,
When fairies sleep.
When fairies dream
Oh, light their dreams and gay !
They float through sunset clouds, through fountain spray ;
Drift in a nutshell boat with poppy sails.
And chase on butterflies and ride on snails.
When fairies dream,
When fairies wake
A mushroom table waits,
Butter from buttercups and petal-plates
Of pollen-bread, and acorn-bowls of dew;
Then hey for games no mortal ever knew,
When fairies wake !


WHAT DO YOU THINK?
Right upon the chimney-top
What do you think I saw ?
Not a minah, not a wren,
Nor a scarlet-tailed macaw,
But a little fluttering fairy girl
With wings of gold and blue.
She twirled her toes, she smiled at me,
Then far away she flew.
Down among the orange trees
What do you think I heard ?
Not a magpie, not a thrush,
Nor any kind of bird,
But a laugh so sweet it must have been
A tiny fairy boy
Sliding on the oranges
And laughing loud for joy.


THE HARBOUR BRIDGE
The Harbour bridge is high—so high !
It’s like a rainbow in the sky,
Not coloured like those rainy bows,
Red, gold and blue.
But much more useful, I suppose,
And lovely too.
When I was little —years ago—
I thought across that gleaming bow
The fairies danced from side to side.
Like twinkling stars ;
But trains across our bow will ride
And motor cars.
I’ve made a joke about it all—
What’s the best name for us to call
Our bridge ? —No rainbow where they flit.
The fairy folk,
But it’s a train-bow, isn’t it ?
And that’s my joke.


BUSH FLOWERS
Now is the bush all foaming full
Of flowers we love and long to pull,
The sweet boronia, pink and white.
And scarlet bottle-brushes bright,
And all the hundred flowers, so small,
A child can scarcely find them all,
While the tall blossoms overhead
Their wild delicious perfume shed.
Scarlet and yellow, pink and grey.
How many have we found to-day ?
How many have we welcomed back
Along the gully, up the track ?
But in the bush all brown and green
Most gay and lovely are they seen,
For when we bring them home we find
That half their beauty’s left behind.


READING
O children, when you learn to read
You’ll like it very much indeed;
For now of course you only look
At pictures in a picture-book;
But think how glorious for you
When you can read the stories through
And learn what all the pictures mean
In all the books you’ve ever seen.
You’ll take a book from off the shelf
And read the stories to yourself,
Or read aloud, as grown-ups do,
To someone not as big as you.

THE HALL CLOCK
The clock in the hall
Is so ’normously tall
That it makes me and Charles feel quite funny and small.
I’m older than he is—l’ll soon be in stockings—
And yet I don’t much like its tickings and tockings ;
They never sound friendly and busy and quick
Like the dear little clock-in-the-nursery’s tick.
We play there’s an ogre locked up in the case;
We can’t see his legs but the clock has his face,
And whenever it strikes,
Just before it says ONE,
Or ELEVEN, it likes—
(And I don’t think it’s fun)
To make horrible snarls
Which are fright’ning to Charles,
So I hold his hand tight, ’cos I’m bigger than he is ;
I’m glad that most people don’t know where the key is ;
It’s Daddy who keeps it where nobody sees,
And not even Mother


THE WINDMILL
O giant windmill, always turning, turning,
What do you say ?
The wind comes up, and you go churning, churning,
The livelong day.
Churning out words you go, like churning butter.
Round, round, and round ;
O windmill, what are those strange words you utter
With creaky sound ?
“ O child ! ” perhaps you say, “ the storm is coming
At last —at last!
I see the clouds, I hear the raindrops drumming
So hard, so fast.
“ Down by the creek a team of oxen passes;
The heavy dray
Beats down a pathway through the silver grasses ”
Perhaps you say.
Or else you tell me, you so high and airy.
How you can see
A witch ride by, a goblin or a fairy,
With gifts for me.
How can I understand, so much below you ?
You gaze so far;
You cannot see the daisies I would show you-
You see a star.
I shout to you in vain, for all my crying
Gets small and thinned ;
You cannot hear my little questions flying—
You hear the wind.
O giant windmill, when shall I be learning
The words you say ?
Or must I only hear you turning, turning,
The livelong day ?


BEDS
The cradle where our baby sleeps
Is called a bassinette,
It’s such a soft and snuggly place,
All trimmed with frills and edged with
And just above his round pink face
A round pink silk rosette.
It’s like a nest, but mother’s bed
That’s standing next to his.
Is like a meadow or a plain.
With flowers on the counterpane,
I stroke it up and down again,
So silky-soft it is.
The four big pillows seem to me
Like mounds and drifts of snow,
All pillowy and billowy
And white as snow there used to be
When mother was a child like me
In England, long ago.
My little bed is straight and small
Whth blankets blue and white,
And carved and painted at the head
A lovely angel gold and red
Is there to guard my little bed,
And bless me through the night.


A CHRISTMAS LETTER
Dear Santa Claus,
Please, when you come.
Bring Claire a doll and me a drum,
With eyes that shut and curly hair
And shoes and socks on —(that’s for Claire).
An engine and a railway-line
With trucks and little signals—(mine);
A hammock made of coloured string
(For both of us), and would you bring
A knife (for me), a workbox, please,
For Claire ; and could you get us these ?
Some pretty soap and ody klone
(That’s scent) —the nicest kind that’s known,
And they’re for Mother, ’cos she said
She was too old to write.
From Ted.
P.S. Claire sends her love to you
And Merry Christmas. I do too.


SPRING FASHIONS
The plane-tree this Spring is the gladdest of trees,
Her dress is all perfectly new,
It’s trimmed with brown bobbles that dance in the breeze
And she’s awfully proud of them too.
And then the acacia below on the slope,
(She won’t mind a bit if one stares).
Has chosen light green, and you’ve noticed, I hope,
The long creamy plumes that she wears.
The pittosporum out on the edge of the rock
To make herself grand as a queen,
Sewed thousands of little white stars on her frock,
All over its flounces of green.
But the coral-trees ordered no dresses at all,
And they laugh, and they say they don’t care,
But they’ll go for a picnic, a walk or a ball
In just their bright red waving hair.

CHRISTMAS CAROL
Ring, O ring the Christmas bells!
Sing, O sing for joy!
Think of all the legend tells
Of a Baby Boy ;
Nestling like a sleepy bird,
Rosy as a flower—
Who could guess those little hands
Were to bless the world’s wide lands,
Were to hold such power ?
Long ago and very far
O’er little Bethlehem
Kings and shepherds saw a star,
Voices spoke to them;
But the Christmas bells they heard
Were in their hearts a-stir,
Ringing through the dark and cold,
When they brought their gifts of gold,
Frankincense and myrrh.
How shall we keep Christmas here
In this land of ours ?
Sun so gold and sky so clear,
Christmas bells of flowers !
Yet their chimes may tell of joy
Human and divine ;
We may see the Day-star rise,
And in children’s happy eyes
The Christmas spirit shine.


ON THE FERRY
Across the harbour as we go.
So close above the sea,
We wonder what can lie below
The thick green water where we know
Such splendid things may be.
Great fishes may go gleaming by,
As big as lions or bears.
And coral-trees that grow so high
They almost touch their watery sky
While we pass unawares.
And, hidden deep beneath our sight,
The lovely mermaids pass.
Who sing enchanting songs at night
And hold a pearl-shell, polished bright,
To make a looking-glass.
Those soapy bubbles on the sea
Show where a giant stands,
And as they rush beside us, we
Who watch them foaming, know that he
Is washing his great hands.


NEWS FOR THE BEES
Bees ! Bees !
I want to tell you, please !
I’ve got a baby sister—she’s too little yet to squeeze;
She only came this morning and I think her eyes are blue.
She wouldn’t let me really look, and so I can’t tell you.
She has such teeny-weeny hands; she hasn’t any hair ;
We didn’t have her yesterday but now—she’s there !


' ■ -
Bees ! Bees !
Underneath the trees
They’re going to put her
mustn’t tease,
pram out, and they said I
They said I musn’t wake
asleep,
her when she’s lying there
So, bees, you mustn’t buzz too loud, but you may come
and peep ;
I’m certain sure you’ll like her ’cos she’s rather like the
flowers —
Soft and pink and sweet to smell —and, bees, she’s ours !


ANNE
I met a little girl to-day.
She jumped and skipped and ran,
A pretty child she was, so gay —
But not as sweet as Anne.
I said, “ O come and talk to me ! ”
And straightway she began;
She was as nice as she could be—
But not as nice as Anne.
She laughed at me with eyes of blue,
As only blue eyes can,
I love her dearly, oh I do !
But not as much as Anne.


THE NINTH BIRTHDAY
Nine years have come and gone
Since we first had Alison,
Nine years of sun and rain,
And November’s here again,
And your happy birthday’s here —
What shall I give my dear ?
Nine presents should be right.
Wrapped up well and tied up tight;
Nine kisses are your due,
Nine joyful wishes too,
Now the sun wakes, to begin
Another year to love you in.


PINK AND GOLD
Fairy Pinkie used to live
In a big pink rose.
Just the home that fairies love.
As you may suppose;
Every little wind that passed
Used to set her swinging,
Then she’d clap her tiny hands
And break out into singing.
Just across the garden bed
Where the flowers unfold,
Fairy Goldie had her home
In a rose of gold;
Lightly on her teeny toes
Dancing on the petals,
Lightly as a butterfly
Hovers ere it settles.
Then at dusk how drowsy-eyed
Fairy Pinkie grows;
Fairy Goldie gives a yawn
In her yellow rose ;
Nestling to the rose’s heart
Safely they lie sleeping,
Till the first soft light of day
Up the sky comes creeping.
But alas ! for roses fade,
Growing pale and old ;
Fairies have to leave their homes
All of pink and gold ;
Each one mounts a dragon-fly,
Skimming hither, thither, —
Off they fly to Fairyland
Where no roses wither.


The moon
THE BALLOON
Was a yellow balloon
Sailing ever so high !
And we thought if we watched, pretty soon
She might fall from the sky.
That she might,
Looking down from the height,
See a girl and a boy,
Who would love such a shining and bright
Huge balloon for a toy.
Floating near,
Very golden and clear.
With a string we might seize—
Just above us —then sinking—then here —
Tangled up in the trees !
With one spring
We’d catch hold of her string,
And we’d pull her down
And we’d keep her, the beautiful
And not ever let go.
thing,
Did our eyes stare and strain,
And our arms stretched too soon ;
Far above us she chose to remain,
That great yellow balloon.


PLAYING ALONE
The end of our garden is a good place to be.
There’s a red wall with creepers and a mulberry tree,
And an old broken wheelbarrow lying in the shade,
Where I play the nicest games of all I’ve ever played.
Somehow other children very often spoil one’s game,
They don’t play the right way—it doesn’t seem the same ;
The boys go off to climb and the girls laugh at me ;
I’d rather play alone beneath the mulberry tree.
Sometimes in its spreading leaves when there’s no one
Lots of fairies, lots of fancies hide and peep and peer ;
Sometimes it’s a house I’ve bought to live in by myself.
Rocking-chairs it has and sofas, many a peg and shelf.


The wheelbarrow is a ship, or different motor cars,
Or a great aeroplane that sails all among the stars,
Or it’s just a wheelbarrow where I can lie and see
The sky blue and shining through the leaves of the tree.
For “ I Spy ” and “ French and English,” “ Rounders ”
and the rest
You have to have a lot of children; I like it best
When there’s no one to bother in a place of my own,
And the best games of all are the games I play alone.


TIDDLELYWINK AND
HOBBLEDEHOY
Tiddlelywink and Hobbledehoy
Were a good little girl and a bad little boy.
Hobbledehoy would chase the cat,
He lost his shoes and he hid his hat,
He teased the baby and made it yell.
He threw the skipping-rope down the well,
He said “ I won’t ” when they said “ You must,”
He wouldn’t eat porridge or beans or crust,
While Tiddlelywink was ever so good
And did all the things that a small girl should.


JwjM
(I- c
Now it happened one day, as you well may think,
To Hobbledehoy and Tiddlelywink,
That a fairy came with a heap of toys
For good little girls and good little boys ;
A china teaset, a parasol,
A musical box and a great big doll
She gave to Tiddlelywink, but oh!
Did Hobbledehoy get anything ? —No !
But the fairy frowned and the fairy said,
“ You, young sir, get nothing but bed,
Until you learn like a sensible lad
How dreadfully silly it is to be bad.”


THE BEST GOODS
If we had to choose the things we like the best of all.
We would take the little ones, very neat and small;
You should have a pebble that is very smooth and round,
I would keep the smallest shell of all I ever found.
I would choose an acorn in its carved wooden cup.
You should have a mushroom that so suddenly comes up,
White on top and beautifully fluted pink below.
And each should have a strawberry because we love them so.
In the sunny meadows there are treasures dear and small,
Yours the lizard glancing from the crack along the wall.
Mine the little fieldmouse with its bright and gentle eyes,
And each should own a baby wren that isn’t any size.
Then we’d scan the garden-beds but wouldn’t pick a lot,
You should have a heartsease or a wee forget-me-not,
I would choose a daisy, and we wouldn’t want the rest,
Because we love the little things, the tiny ones, the best.


CHRISTMAS SHOPPING
I have half-a-crown to spend
And Joan has two-and-three ;
We go to town on Christmas Eve,
And oh ! you’d simply not believe
How hard it’s going to be.
For Daddy wants a nice new pipe,
And Mother wants a book,
And she’ll give me and I’ll give Joan
Some records for the gramophone ;
And then there’s Gran and Cook.
I don’t know how we’ll manage it,
But anyway we’ll see,
In all the cheapest shops in town,
What can be got for half-a-crown
And also two-and-three.

THE ’POSSUM
The ’possum ! The ’possum !
They told me he was there ;
I looked, but all that I could see
Was white gum-blossoms on the tree
All waving in the air.
But as I watched the waving blossom
Out peeped the little grey opossum.
THE WALLABY
Wallaby, wallaby, run. run, run !
Out in the paddocks and under the sun,
Over the fences and down to the creek —
Don’t you stop running till Saturday week !
Wallaby, wallaby, stop, stop, stop!
I want to watch you and see how you hop ;
Stay with me, play with me under the gums
And don’t run away until Christmas comes !


TWO LITTLE BEARS
Cuffy and Cully were two little bears,
They sat on high branches instead of on chairs,
They hadn’t a house and they hadn’t a bed,
They slept in the bush in the gum-trees instead.
Cuffy and Cully went looking for food,
They thought young green gum-leaves exceedingly good
Cully found plenty and when he’d enough he
Gave all the rest he had gathered to Cuffy.


Cuffy and Cully last Saturday week
Went for a walk to their favourite creek,
A dear little creek away down in a gully;
“ It’s very good water ! ” said Cuffy to Cully.
Cuffy and Cully can clamber and climb
Out of sight, out of reach, and right out of this rhyme ;
So busy, so keen on their own small affairs —
Did you ever hear tell of such nice little bears ?


PLEASANT PLACES
“ A sunny wall ” said Pussy,
“ Is where I love to be;
I sit and watch the little birds
I hope to catch for tea;
Away from teasing, barking dogs
That do annoy me so,
I doze and dream, and all is well.
And when I hear the dinner-bell
I haven’t far to go.”
“ A bough ” said Yellow Robin,
“ Is what I love the best —
A bough that’s not too far away
From where we built our nest;
Where there are leaves to shield me
From sun that’s over-strong,
A swaying bough that gently swings.
The sort of bough whereon one sings
A happy sort of song.”
“ A muddy pool ” said Froggy,
“ Is where I choose to sit,
A pond with reeds and water-weeds
All growing over it;
Where on a flat damp stone I squat.
And croak for half the night;
Oh, there is nothing like a pool.
All slimy, grimy, wet and cool
To fill me with delight ! ”


THE KOOKABURRA
“ Oh, Kookaburra ! ” Mary said, and wrinkled up her
forehead,
“ What shall I do, ’cos everything is absolutely horrid ?
There isn’t anything to play, there wasn’t jam for tea — ”
Then “Ha ha ! ” said the Kookaburra, “Ha ha ! He,
he, he ! ”
“ You’re most unkind,” said Mary, “and to laugh at me’s
a shame ;
W 7 hat can Ido but cry ? ” she asked; “Hehe ! ” the
answer came.
And Mary when she’d thought awhile agreed with his
reply.
It’s always best when things go wrong to laugh, and not
to cry.
FLANNEL FLOWERS
Flannel flowers were only made
For fairy-babies’ sake;
They got so cold on Winter nights
They used to he awake;
So then the kindly starry flower —
How mother-fairies thank it!—
Grew woolly petals, just to make
The baby-fairy’s blanket.


THE PLATYPUS
“ Good morning ! ” said the Platypus,
“ Good morning, Mr. Emu !
I’m very glad to meet you thus,
You know how I esteem you.”
But Mr. Emu turned away
And never said a word.
Because he is a very grand
And haughty kind of bird.
“ Good morning ! ” said the Platypus,
“ Good morning, Mr. Wombat!
Oh, have you heard the frightful news ?
There’s been an awful combat
Between the turtle and the teal —”
But off the Wombat hurried,
And left the friendly Platypus
A little sore and flurried.
“ Good morning ! ” said the Platypus,
“ Good morning. Miss Rosella !
Oh, please accept this lily-leaf,
‘Twill make a nice umbrella.”
And Miss Rosella smiled and bowed
And preened her every feather,
And she and Mr. Platypus
Went walking off together.


O KOZAKURA SAN
They call Japan the Land of Tea,
And here in front of you you see
A little maiden of Japan—
Her name is Kozakura San.
Her pretty cups are white and blue,
Her lacquer tray is red,
And darling, if it could be true
That you were in the picture too
I know what she would say to you,
So let’s pretend she said ;
“ Please come and have a cup of tea,
There’s one for you and one for me.”


When O Kozakura San
Was a baby small and fat.
Long before she walked or ran
She was carried just like that —
Slung across her nurse’s back,
Like a swagman’s precious pack.
What a funny way to go !
How she must have swung and bumped !
As the nurse went to and fro
Let us hope she never jumped,
Never ran or skipped or hopped,
Or the baby might have dropped.


When Kozakura grew a bit
She had to learn to read,
And then she had to sit and sit—
She found it hard indeed.
The children in Japan, you know,
Must sit upon the floors,
And then O Kozakura San
Had no nice books like yours,
But such a long and curly scroll—
I know she’ll never read the whole.
In far Japan they drive about
In rickshaws, as you’ve heard, no doubt.
And here’s our little friend, you see,
She’s going out I think to tea.
The rickshaw man has such a flat
And funny sort of yellow hat;
It shades him when the sun is hot,
And when it rains, why then he’s got
A sort of small umbrella spread,
Quite big enough to shield his head.


Here’s a paper lantern,
Pink and green and white ;
If O Kozakura San
Should go out at night
She would carry such a lantern
With its little light.
Little Japanese girls
At the close of day.
When the dark steals down upon them
Coming home from play,
Carry little paper lanterns
Just to light the way.
Birds and flowers upon them
Look extremely fine ;
When the candle’s safely lighted
How they glow and shine !
I should have a lotus blossom
Painted pink on mine.


JUGGLERS
Come and let us look
At a picture book
Where some Japanese are juggling,
Tumbling, climbing, wrestling, struggling,
Doing funny tricks
With their strings and sticks,
Casks and plates and cups of tea —
Oh, how clever they must be !
It is wonderful to see.
Would you like to try
On your back to lie,
Dressed in curious apparel.
Holding up a yellow barrel
Which must never slip,
Though you only grip
W'ith your toes, as monkeys do ;
I have seen them at the Zoo.
This man does it well —can you ?
Just suppose it crashed
Down on you and smashed
All your nose and teeth and forehead
Wouldn’t you look rather horrid ?
We should cry “ Alas !
Bring a looking-glass ;
What a terrible disgrace —
Only see —you’ve spoilt your face ! ”


We rush across the tree-tops;
The sleepy birds half-wake,
Because we laugh to see them
And give the boughs a shake.
But higher yet and higher
We keep on flying still,
Beyond the tallest gum-tree.
Beyond the biggest hill.
The sky is all about us,
The stars come near at last—
The great moon’s shiny babies —
And still we’re flying fast!
What lovely things we see then,
As on and on we go,
But when it’s nearly morning
We must come home, we know.
WINGS AT NIGHT
When all the house is sleeping
And Mother never stirs,
I creep out of my bed
And Phyllis out of hers.
And from between our shoulders,
Just underneath the skin.
Our wings shoot out so quickly—
And then our games begin.
We never wake the others,
We stretch our wings and fly
Through the open window
And up towards the sky.


\ I J
Jv
/
We brought a candle with us
And light it at a star,
Because it’s dark below us
And we have come so far.
And back in bed we’re dreaming
Of all those lovely things . . . .
But no one ever guesses
That really we have wings!
