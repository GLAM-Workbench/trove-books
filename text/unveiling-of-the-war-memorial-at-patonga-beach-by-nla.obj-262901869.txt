Flies are germ carriers, spreading
sickness and disease. Sani-lid,
the modern, hygienic lavatory,
overcomes this menace. A scien-
tific chemical solvent keeps the
pan completely ODOURLESS and
FLY-REPELLANT. Sani-lid is an
hygienic necessity in unsewered
areas and needs no water.

SANI-LID No. 1 is a portable outfit which is simply placed
on the floor in the ordinary closet house, covering the pan. It
is fitted with solid cedar seat, to which is attached the “SANI-
LID” Automatic Chemical Container which feeds a small
quantity of “SANI-LID” fluid into the pan each time the lid is
opened and closed. This chemical, in conjunction with
“SANI-LID” Powder, which is placed in the empty pan, assists
to dissolve the sewerage matter, kills germs, and absolutely
destroys all foul odours, and flies will not go near it.
