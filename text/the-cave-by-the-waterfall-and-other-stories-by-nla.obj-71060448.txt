THE GAVE BY THE
WATEKEALL.
CHAPTER I.
ONE JULY MORNING.
B Down from the mountain descends the brooklet rejoicing in freedom ;
Little it dreams of the mill hid in the valley below;
Glad with the joy of existence the child goes singing and laughing.
Little dreaming what toils lie in the future concealed.? ?Longfellow.
f OW old were you, mother dear,
_ ' j when you were married ? ? asked
Jessie Nicholson, looking up from
the great pan of dough she was
kneading, with a glimmer of
mischief in her large black eves.
o V
Her mother, a stout, comely-
looking woman, who was making
pastry at a snow-white table
near an open window in the
large farm-house kitchen, sighed a little as she an-
swered, ? I was only a child, Jessie, as you are your-


self, and mine was no case to be imitated by you.
Why, dearie, I was an orphan, and had no home of
my own, while you are the pet and darling of the
whole house.?
?Evading the question, mother mine,? laughed
Jessie; ?you know very well that you were just
exactly my age?sweet seventeen.?
?Ah, but things were different, my Jessie,? said the
mother very gravely. ? I was a woman, then; for
two years at least I had left my childhood behind me.
For two years I had been fighting and struggling
with all sorts of difficulties, and had been weighed
down with such anxieties as I hope you will never
know.?
? Poor mother,? said Jessie softly, thinking how
that must have been when her grandfather died and
his one little motherless daughter found herself cast
adrift in the world, with few friends and in an almost
penniless condition.
?Yes,? continued her mother, gently covering some
huge gooseberry tarts with the lightest of light pastry,
? I was very lonely and forlorn when your father
made my acquaintance.?
? Tell me, mother, what did you think of him when
you first saw him ? ? asked Jessie, in a pretty im-
perious way which seemed to demand an answer.
?I thought, childie,? and a beautiful, tender light


shone in her mother?s soft brown eyes and still fair
countenance, ?that he was a strong and noble man,
that his was a kind, good face, which I should love to
have always near me, and that his very presence
seemed to breathe strength and helpfulness, and was
sufficient in itself to nerve one to meet and conquer
all sorts of trials and difficulties. I felt so safe, my
Jessie, and so happy when he was by my side.?
?I should think you did, mother dear,? cried her
daughter, shaking the flour from her dimpled arms
and stretching them out towards her parent in the
prettiest way imaginable, ? and how I love you for it,
and what a darling you must have been ! ?
? I think I suited your father?s taste,? said the older
woman, softly, ? and one or two thought I was rather
pretty; but I don?t know about that.?
? Was father handsome ? ?
? I thought him so ?I always think him so,? said
Jessie?s mother, with the proud, tender light shining-
in her face once more; ? I thought, and I still
think, that there is no one in the world like your
father.?
? Hear, hear ! ? said a pleasant, manly voice, and a
tall, well-made man of about forty years of age, enter-
ing the kitchen, went up to Mrs. Nicholson, laid his
great brown hands caressingly upon her shoulder, and
looked down inquiringly into her eyes.


?Jessie,? said her mother hastily, ?go and fetch me
some fresh water from the spring.?
?Yes, mother,? and Jessie, having finished her task,
pushed the pan of dough into its accustomed place,
there to stand and rise while the great brick oven
was prepared for its reception, and understanding well
that her parents wished to be alone, she took up a
light can and went out into the sunshine of the bright
July morning.
? What is it, mother ? ? asked her father when she
had gone.
?It is my Jessie, Richard, who has excited me by
reminding me of old times. Little puss ! I believe
she did it on purpose. I was talking to her?really
she is growing into such a beautiful young woman.
Have you noticed it ? ?
? Of course, and I am very proud of her, wife ; she?s
just such another as you used to be,? replied the
farmer heartily.
? More beautiful than ever I was, Richard; you
were always partial. But?what was I saying ? Oh,
the child is growing up, and ?and I wanted her to
see that she must not play and laugh and that
with Josy and Dick?s friends quite so much as she
does ?
?Nonsense. She?s all right. Leave her alone and
she will be natural. Whatever you do, wife, don?t let


her become stiff and conceited, like some of the girls
about here who have been to boarding schools, and
think no one is good enough for them to speak to ?
you never were yourself. And if she?s as good as her
mother she will do.?
?Ah, but you are so partial, Richard; and the child
must be more grave and steady, modest and maidenly,
now she is grown up.?
?Well, well, have it your own way,? said the far-
mer, going out again and leaving Mrs. Nicholson
' ~ o o o
alone.
Meanwhile, leaving the long, low farmhouse, with
its quaintly - gabled roof and diamond - patterned
window panes, round which carefully-trained roses
and honeysuckles, peach and pear trees twined and
twisted, Jessie passed through the garden, between
rows of standard rose-trees covered with numerous
buds and not a few full-blown roses, and, further on
between well-pruned gooseberry and currant bushes.
Then she crossed an orchard, where young fruit was
forming on apple trees, with gnarled and crooked
boughs, and younger ones standing straight and up-
right, with rows of well-trained pear and plum-trees
interspersed, and a background of shadowy nut-trees.
And then, passing on swiftly, her gentle footsteps
making no sound over the soft, dark-green grass, she
went through a little hunting-gate and entered a
o o o


pretty ravine, which looked dark, cool, and refreshing
after the bright sunshine to which her eyes had grown
accustomed.
Here a streamlet, descending from the hills and
mountains beyond, fell over steep, gaunt-looking
rocks, through a network of luxuriant ferns and moss,
under a canopy of larch-trees in their first summer
green, into a basin of natural stone-work.
O 1
Jessie stooped to fill her can at one particular
branch of the dashing, tumbling, foaming water.
O 7 O 7 O
She was indeed a beautiful young girl, with a dark
oval face, black eyes, long sweeping black lashes, a
straight nose, short upper lip, and a handsomely
curved chin expressive of great decision of character,
which the soft dimples in her rosy cheeks and the
childlike innocence of her gaze not a little contra-
dicted. Moreover, she was about the medium height,
with a slim, not undeveloped figure, and an upright,
dauntless bearing.
As she filled her can, she was thinking of how she
7 O
had thwarted a long-cherished intention of her mother?s
to give her a little lecture on the proprieties of life
and the inexpediency of her being quite so intimate
with her brother?s friends, as she thought she could
scarcely help being, seeing that she had lived among
them all her life, by protesting it was time she began
to think about having a home of her own?such


nonsense! She had only said it to tease her dear
lovino - mother; for where in the world could she have
O 7
such a delightful home as was hers ? and then, when
her mother called her a child, by cross-questioning her
about her own long-past love affairs.
The water dashed by, sprinkling Jessie with its
foamy jets, and leaping up again, when it fell into
the basin, as if it were trying to reach one dry moss-
covered rock, which yet it could only touch with a
drop every now and then. She felt as if she quite
sympathized with the frantic plunges and vain essays
of the streamlet, and lifting her full can she playfully
upset it over the stone, laughing merrily as she did so
at the supposed surprise of the dry moss upon being
thus suddenly submerged.
At that moment, a young and handsome stranger,
walking languidly through the large glen, in which
Jessie?s home was the principal farmhouse, passed by
the ravine, and, carelessly glancing in at the sound of
the splashing water and the joyous peal of girlish
laughter, was astonished at the sight which met his
view.
Jessie, in her cotton dress, the dark-blue ground of
which was overrun with a straggling flower} 7 pattern,
and which was made according to the custom of that
day, with an extremely short waist and short sleeves,
that displayed to advantage her beautifully-moulded


arms, ho] ding the empty water-can triumphantly aloft,
was standing with her small well-shaped head, sur-
rounded by its wealth of naturally-curling hair,
thrown back to look at the result of what she had
just done. Behind her was the silvery water gleam-
ing amidst dark green pollypodies, hart?s-tongue, and
the more common varieties of male and lady ferns,
bracken, etc., overshadowed by pretty larch trees.
The stranger stood. It seemed as if some sudden
fascination chained him to the spot.
He was apparently about twenty-five years of age,
and was tall and well built. His eyes were blue, his
features good, and he was fair, with light hair and a
fine silken moustache. His dress was faultless, but
more adapted to town-life than that of the wild
country through which he was travelling. For all
about Jessie?s home for miles and miles the district
was only partly cultivated, by reason of the steep
hills and crags and still steeper and more formidable
mountains, surrounding the beautiful and well-shel-
tered dales and valleys, in one of which Mr. Nicholson,
who was a large sheep-farmer, resided. Jessie?s two
brothers, who lived at home and helped their father,
were hardy, venturesome youths, dressing and looking
very differently to this stranger, who was more gentle-
manly in appearance than any one she had ever seen.
?How beautiful!? he exclaimed. ?How truly


beautiful! And, lifting his hat, he came forward
with an air of indecision, and yet as if irresistibly
impelled to make Jessie?s acquaintance.
The girl coloured. A ready response rose to her
lips, but the recollection of her mother?s late words
about maidenly reserve helped to remind her that the
young man was a stranger, so she merely replied with
a pretty, old-fashioned curtsey.
? May I assist you ? ? he said, gently raising the
can, which was now overflowing, and placing it by
her side.
? Thank you,? replied Jessie, turning to go away.
? Stop, oh, stop one little minute,? said the young-
man entreatingly ; ? this is such a lovely spot. Will
you not tell me its name ? ?
Jessie looked at him in surprise. ?Do you not
know Fir-dale ? she said. ? I thought every one
knew Fir-dale?the sweetest and most beautiful place
in all this neighbourhood ! ?
But I know it now,? he said very earnestly, a
sudden tide of colour overspreading his face; ? and I
shall remember it all my life.?
?And this little ravine, this tiny part of Fir-dale
which I call my glen, ?Jessie?s Glen??? asked the
girl wistfully, raising her beautiful eyes to his.
"I shall remember it all my life,? he repeated;
? and Jessie. Are you Jessie ? ?


? Yes,? she said simply, being very much flattered
by his evident admiration for herself, and quite foi -
getting that she ought not to linger there talking
to a perfect stranger. But she was so childish, so
ignorant of the world, and so much in need of the
motherly counsels she had laughingly disregarded
that very morning.
? It is exceedingly beautiful here,? said the young
man, again looking down upon her with what she
thought singular kindness.
? Is it not the most beautiful place in all the world ?
said Jessie, enthusiastically; ?and is not the water
happy, rushing along as though it had nothing to do
but play all day ? It is like me, it loves to play ; but
it cannot do so all along.?
? Why not ? ?
? Oh, because there?s a jealous old mill down below,
that catches it and makes it useful to grind flour for
all the neighbourhood. I often think the mill is just
like mother, for she will have me work when I want
to play.?
? What a shame ! ?
?Not at all,? said Jessie, looking at him in surprise.
?It is quite right. Work must be done; wheat
must be ground to make bread for us all, and I
must knead and bake it; but it is nice to play some-
times.?


?Do you mean to say
the stranger indignantly.
you have to work?? said
? es. And I must go
now, or the bread will be
ready to bake before the brick-oven is prepared for
it,? said Jessie, with a pretty, thoughtful air.
?And shall I never see you again?? asked the
3?oung man dejectedly.
? 1 don>t know - 1 suppose you will, if you wish
to do so. Good-bye,? replied Jessie, taking up her
can and going towards the little gate.
The stranger followed and held it open.
Good-bye, Miss Jessie,? he said cordially, lifting
his hat and bowing low over the gate.
?Thank you,? and, with another pretty, old-
fashioned curtsey, the girl turned and walked slowly
through the orchard and up the garden-path, little
knowing that she, in her childish ignorance and
wilful disregard of her mother?s most wise counsel,
had just set such a stone rolling as was fated to well-
nigh crush her some day with its disastrous results.


CHAPTER 11.
THE WATERFALL
? I heard the distant ocean call,
Imploring and entreating;
Prawn onward, o?er this rocky wall
I plunged, and the loud waterfall
Made answer to the greeting.
? A brooklet, nameless and unknown,
Was I at first, resembling
A little child, that all alone
Comes venturing down the stairs of stone
Irresolute and trembling.?
Longfellow.
ESSIE did not even know the name
of the handsome young stranger
who had come to her in the pretty
ravine she called her glen Jessie s
Glen. And yet she, poor foolish
child, was constantly thinking and
dreaming about him.
In her own mind she had very
speedily endowed him with all sorts of
imaginary virtues. She thought it was impossible


that any one who looked so kind, spoke in such a
gentle, courteous manner, and was besides so very
beautiful (as she thought him, and indeed, he was
handsome), in appearance, could be anything else
but good and true and altogether excellent. After
him, that is in comparison with him, how rough,
blunt, and boyish were her brothers ! Dick, who
was a year older than herself, and Josy two years
younger. They, poor boys, could not understand
why Jessie should, all at once, begin to chide them
for being rough and ill-mannered. Thinking she was
cross, and being vexed, they grew rougher still, and
were ostentatiously what before they had been in-
advertently. Neither could Mrs. Nicholson under-
stand what had come to her blithe, cheerful daughter,
' O'
and why she took her turn with such unusual reluc-
tance in the simple household duties. As for Jessie?s
father, he asked more than once how it was his little
singing-bird sang no longer as she milked the cows,
fed the poultry, churned, and baked.
? I can?t think what?s got to our bit lassie, wife,?
he said mournfully. ? She looks dull and mopish,
and as if she was always thinking about something
right away to herself, something we can none of us
share.?
?Yes,? Mrs. Nicholson acquiesced, ?Jessie seemed
very dreamy and self-absorbed.?


?That she is,? repeated her husband. ?I noticed
it particularly last night when young Tom White
came in to supper. And I saw he looked quite down-
hearted because she had not a single pleasant word
for him?and he and Dick and she have been like
brothers and sisters all their lives.?
? I would not think much of that,? said Mrs.
Nicholson, smiling, with an air of relief; ?it may
be that the child has only taken to heart my little
lecture the other day, and is trying to be more re-
served and maidenly now she is growing up.?
? And I asked you not to make her stiff and con-
ceited,? said the farmer, in some vexation. ?Don?t
try it on again with her, wife. Let her be as free
and untrammelled as the mountain wind.?
? There is a freeness which yet is not altogether
free,? replied his wife in some perplexity. ?I only
want Jessie to have proper pride,?
?Pride is hateful,? said the farmer. ?I don?t care
where you find it,? and he went out, without waiting
to hear what Mrs. Nicholson was vainly trying to
express.
The good woman was anxious to explain what in
her opinion constituted ? proper pride,? but, as her
command of language was not great, she grew rather
mystified herself over the matter. She knew what
she meant well enough; she had a clear conception


of what constitutes a Christian woman, who should
possess the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, who
should look well to the ways of her household and
be altogether such that the heart of her husband, or
other relatives, might safely trust in her. Such a
woman she was herself: no polished lady in one
sense, but one of nature?s own true gentlewomen,
with instincts kindly and courteous, and manners
gentle and loving, beloved by all with whom she
had to do; as well she might be, living as she did, a
thoroughly unselfish, useful life.
It was the great wish of Farmer Nicholson?s heart
that Jessie might become such another as her mother,
but he had lately begun to suspect that the latter was
not exactly the person to mould a similar character
to her own. Mrs. Nicholson?s sweet, well-disciplined
nature had been nurtured in the school of want and
suffering. Jessie?s whole existence had, in comparison
to that of her mother?s, been joy and gladness; she
had known no care, no trouble, all had been pleasant
hitherto. Alas! was it likely that in this world
everything would always be so pleasant ?
The little incident of meeting the stranger by the
streamlet in the ravine seemed to the girl to be the
turning-point, the most important era, in her whole
short and hitherto uneventful life. It was the occa-
sion, too, of the first secret she had ever had from her


mother. For Jessie felt a sudden shyness of mention-
ing this beautiful ? knight-errant ? of hers, as if he
would lose something of his fascination if he were
to be discussed in the homely farmhouse kitchen.
Perhaps on the Sunday, when the fire was lighted in
the best sitting-room, and they all sat there a few
hours in the afternoon in state, trying not to believe
it was less comfortable and pleasant than the kitchen,
to which they were more accustomed, if, as so often
happened, the farmer would slip away, to look after
his sheep, or to have a pipe on the bench outside, and
her brothers would go out, under some less intelligible
pretext, and she found herself alone with her mother,
she thought she might broach the subject then. But,
whenever she fancied herself doing so, the idea of her
mother sitting very erect, to prevent the lace of her
best cap being crushed, or her Sunday gown from
being tumbled, and looking then if ever, though so
kind and tender, a little inclined to lecture upon
the need of perfection in everything, entirely dis-
comforted her and discouraged that half-formed
resolution.
In the course of the week, Jessie learned that the
strange gentleman had been inquiring for lodgings,
and had, at last, engaged a couple of rooms in a farm-
house about a mile distant.
People say he is a very nice, pleasant-spoken


gentleman,? said Tom W liite, who told the news one
evening, as he came in with Dick to supper?a very
usual custom of his. ? But I don?t know why he
should come and settle in such an out-of-the-way
part of the world. What can he want here ? He is
evidently unused to a country life.? And Tom looked
strangely dissatisfied, and as if he felt a sudden pre-
sentiment that the stranger?s presence foreboded no
good to himself.
Tom was a tine young fellow, well-made and nearly
six feet in height, and he was anything but bad-
looking: his brown, curly hair fell back from a broad
brow expressive of unusual intelligence, and his clear
grey eyes were large and well-formed. Jessie and he
had always been good friends. The girl looked upon
him almost as a brother.
That, however, was not the way in which Tom
White had lately hoped that she would learn to
regard him. His father was on the point of taking
a farm for him in the neighbourhood, and he was
beginning to think much of the desirability of finding
a suitable mistress for his new home. He had not far
to look; Jessie?s mother had been like a mother to
him, Jessie herself was dearer than any sister could
be. He knew the Nicholsons would be in no hurry
to part with their only daughter; but he could have
a sister with him for a time, and he hoped they would


gradually become accustomed to the idea of his being
engaged to Jessie. As regards herself, he was full of
hopes and fears. Her extreme friendliness with every
one, about which her prudent mother had remon-
strated with her, had long made him feel doubtful
and unsettled as to the state of her feelings. And
now her sudden coldness, want of interest in the
topics which they usually discussed together, and
the evident pre-occupation of her thoughts filled him
with a vague alarm. Without being aware that she
had ever seen the stranger, who had sought for
lodgings in their neighbourhood, he instinctively dis-
trusted him, and wished that he was not going to
live so near Jessie?s home.
He would have been distressed, indeed, if he had
known that the girl had already seen the new-comer,
and that he, and no one else, was the subject of her
thoughts almost continually just then.
One evening, when Jessie had gone to the ravine
for water ?the water there being considered particu-
larly good for drinking and for making tea ?she
found the stranger seated upon a light camp-stool,
with his sketch-book open on his knee. He was not
drawing, that is, as he hastened to explain to Jessie,
he had not begun his picture, for the scene was too
tame without any life in it. Would she, was it
asking too much to inquire if she would mind


standing where he had first seen her, that he might
have a figure in his little sketch ? With many
blushes, and without thinking that the request was
a forward one for a stranger to make, Jessie weakly
complied with it, and stood as long as he wished,
which certainly seemed long enough to her, and then
she came across timidly to see what he had drawn.
?It is very beautiful,? she cried enthusiastically,
though, indeed, it was a very poor work of art. ? I
don?t know how you can do it.?
? Drawing is very easy,? he replied; ? one of the
simplest things in the world.?
? I wish I could draw,? she said shyly. ? I
would give anything if I could make such beautiful
pictures.?
? I will teach you,? he said, quite eagerly.
?Oh no, thank you. It?it would cost a good
deal; and though father has a large farm, he has never
much ready money, and he always tells us to be
careful.?
? But I will teach you for nothing,? he said, even
more eagerly.
?Oh no, thank you; I could not allow that,? she
said, recollecting herself and colouring very much.
? And I must go. The boys want to have coffee for
supper, because Tom White is coming, and it is his
birthday, and I have come to fetch the water.?


? Who is Tom White ? ? asked the stranger, rather
O 3
curtly.
? Oh, he is ray brother?s chief friend,? replied Jessie,
lingering.
O O
?And is he very nice and all that sort of thing ? ?
?Yes, very.? And, now, if Tom had been listening
he would have heard enthusiastic words of such
praise as he had never had before from Jessie?s artless
lips.
The stranger did not seem to like it much. He bit
his moustache once or twice, and sprang to his feet so
abruptly as to overturn his camp stool.
? Jessie, Jessie,? called Dick impatiently from the
garden. ? Mother says you are to make haste.?
? I must go. Good-bye,? she said hurriedly.
?You don?t know how hard it is for me to leave you
like this,? said the stranger, holding the hand she
placed in his. ? You will go in and be happy with
your brothers and this Tom, and I, who have no one
in the world to care for me, will go back to my strange
and solitary lodgings.? ?
His voice sounded very sad, and Jessie?s eyes filled
with sudden tears. She was so ignorant of the world,
she did not know how artfully the man was trying to
work upon her feelings. He saw his advantage and
went on. ?Yes, you little know what it is to be
alone in the world. No one to care what becomes of


you. No one to be sorry if you are ill or unhappy.
And I am very unhappy just now.?
? Are you ? ? sobbed Jessie, believing every word,
and breaking down entirely at the thought of such
wretchedness.
? Yes; but it is not worth while making you
miserable about it. Go back, Miss Jessie, to your
happy home and loving friends, and forget the orphan
and stranger. Will Gibson is nothing to you.?
?Jessie, Jessie,? called her brother?s voice. Ah!
why did she not obey it ?
? Will Gibson ! is that your name ? ? she asked hesi-
tatingly.
? Yes; and Will Gibson?s a poor wretch no one cares
for, and who cares for no one, at least, no, lately he
has beo-un to think he might have one friend in the
ï¿½ ï¿½
world. But now he sees even that consolation must
be denied him,? he said bitterly.
? Is it I you mean ? ? asked Jessie,
? Who else should it be ? ?
? Oh, but you must not think so, it is not true ; I
should like to be your friend, I care for you very
much ; I?l am thinking about you all along,? said
the weak and foolish maiden; and then, hurrying
across the orchard, she left him, and almost ran into
the arms of her brother, who had come in search
of her.


m kl D o of* me always, is she ? The darling ! ?
muttered William Gibson, as she disappeared. Then,
turning on his heel, he added half-aloud, ? I must do
what father wished afterwards. I cannot leave her,
and and they say my grandparents are such
wretchedly poor and vulgar people. It would ruin
me to have to own them just now. I will wait till I
am married. Father was in no hurry, why should
I be ? I mean to win that beautiful Jessie. Fortune
favours the bold.?
And yet, as he turned away, his face wore a
querulous, dissatisfied expression, as if his conscience
were troubling him not a little.


CHAPTER 111.
A TIME OF TRIAL.
? It must not be, there is a stronger love
Than feeds those tendrils which our hearts entwine,
Whereby my will is dedicate above.
And is not mine or thine.?
S. S. Stone.
FTER that evening Jessie and the
young stranger often met, and
soon there was very little re-
serve indeed between them.
Jessie was informed that the
young man had been a clerk in
a London counting-house, that
his mother had died when he
was very young and his father
about a year ago. ? But I was
very unhappy in the office,? he
said; ?it was such weary task-
work, writing, writing, writing^
all day long. Why, Jessie, you know how tiring it is
to write a letter,?


?Yes,? Jessie knew how tiring it was to write a
letter, and she could easily imagine it must be much
more so to have to write all day long.
? And then it was such snobbish work,? he went on.
? Everybody looks down on one, and?-and we have to
sit at a high desk in a stuffy place, writing till we
scarcely know where we are.?
Jessie?s sympathy was always ready when he
descanted on this. She did not know?how should
she ??that much of what he said was very foolish
and despicable. She only knew that he was confiding
his troubles to her, and that they were all very real
to him. When he told her that his chief trouble now
was that he was afraid he should never be able to win
her father?s friendship, Jessie always hastened to
reassure him. ? Only let father and mother get to
know you,? she said, ? and they will be certain
to like you.?
However, Will shrank from the ordeal of seeking to
make their acquaintance, and, on one pretext after
another, put off doing so. Jessie grew accustomed to
keeping things from the knowledge of her parents.
And Mrs. Nicholson, acting on her husband?s advice,
forbore to press her to say where she was going, where
she had been, and many other things.
Only Tom followed her about with his wistful eyes,
and his voice gradually became low and sad when


he addressed her. Evidently Jessie was not for him,
and he took little interest in preparing his new
abode.
One day?it was a fine morning in September?
Jessie left the house, feeling unusually restless and
dissatisfied with her clandestine friendship for the
stranger. She had had many misgivings that she was
unwise and imprudent in seeing him so often; but yet
she could not bring her mind to the determination to
tell her mother everything. So she strolled along by
the side of the streamlet which ran through her oden
CD CD >
ever so far up country, striving to disentangle her
perplexed thoughts.
It was a lovely morning for a walk, and Jessie?s
heart grew lighter as she stepped briskly along
beside the foaming water. She wore a large cotton
hood and little shawl pinned across her shoulders,
for she had merely run down to her glen, as she
tnought, for a few minutes, when the impulse to
i amble along beside the streamlet had caused her
to come so far, and certainly she had had no idea oi
coming to meet Will. But, after going up stream
half a mile or so, she thought she might as well go
to a large waterfall at a little distance, and so she
crossed the stream on stepping-stones, and went
through a wild-looking, rocky defile, round rocks
and along narrow ledges, with chasms on one side


and wild crags on the other, until she could hear
the sound of a large waterfall, at the foot of which
she presently stood, while before her was Will
himself.
He sat on a rock at a little distance, sketching
busily, and he rose with an exclamation of delight
when he saw Jessie.
? You here ! Who would have thought it! How
delightful! ?
? I did not know ?that is, who could tell you
would be here ?? stammered Jessie, blushing.
? Does not the water sound grand ? ? he remai'ked,
after each had explained how they came to be there.
? I can scarcely believe it is the same stream which
chatters to me in my glen, and to which 1 tell all
my little secrets,? said Jessie, smiling.
? Here it is a mighty power,? he replied very
gravely. ? And yet it had a small beginning.?
?I suppose it is broken up again lower down and
divided into different streams,? she continued dreamily,
glancing up at the waterfall with some awe.
The water fell down in all over ninety feet. But
it was broken into two falls, though, at a little
distance, these seemed like one. Altogether it was
very beautiful, with high fern-begirt rocks surround-
ing it, and the great mountains beyond.
? How well you have done it! ? said Jessie, looking


down at Will?s water-colour sketch, which was almost
completed.
? I cannot do any more at it now,? he said
meaningly.
?Why not??
? Because you are here, and when you are here,
Jessie, it is impossible for me to think of anything
but you.?
?Do you see that narrow ledge of rocks on the
right side of the break between the two falls ? ? asked
Jessie hastily, trying to turn the conversation from
herself, and not stopping to reflect before she spoke.
?Yes,? replied Will, looking up at the spot.
? There is a cave there,? she continued. ? I have
been in it once, and I should like to go again, if you
will help me.?
? Come, then,? he said eagerly, giving her his hand.
After a toilsome ascent, they stood at the dark
entrance to a snug little cave, hollowed out of the
rocks, and completely hidden from view, either from
above or from below.
? Any one might live here quite contentedly,? said
Jessie, looking round the cave, which was certainly
a snug little room, with a stone floor, and wonderfully
dry, considering the near neighbourhood of the water-
fall.
Will Gibson shrugged his shoulders. ?Nay, Jessie,?


he said; ?it would even be worse than that old office
in which I used to wield the pen.?
? I am sure I could be very happy here,? persisted
Jessie wilfully. ? See, I would have my tire in this
corner, because there is a hole, or something like a
hole above there, out of which the smoke could go.?
And she pointed to where a faint glimmer of day-
light struggled through some interlacing tree roots
at the further end of the cave.
Her companion laughed. ? What a fancy you
have,? he said, ?to convert a gloomy little hole like
this into a home ! ?
? One might have a worse,? Jessie was beginning
merrily. ? A square of carpet and a chair and
table ?
Will interrupted her impatiently. ? Before you
proceed with your furnishing,? he said, in a low
voice, ? answer me one question, Jessie. Would you
like to live here all alone ? ?
?Why not?? laughed Jessie. And then she added,
? I am not quite sure, but I think that it is very
possible I might keep a cat.?
?Ah 1 now, you are laughing at me,? said young
Gibson angrily, ?you know very well what I mean,
Jessie.?
?What??
? Shall I say it ? ?


?If you like.? But Jessie looked a little frightened,
for there was an expression in the other?s lace which
she had never seen there before.
He came towards her and caught both her hands
in his. ?Jessie,? he said, ?I could never endure my
life anywhere unless you were with me. Jessie, a
dungeon would be a palace to me if you were there,
and the richest mansion in the world a wretched
dwelling-place unless you shared it. Jessie, my own
darling, can you not love me a little ? will you not
promise some da} 7 to be mine ? ?
? Oh! I wish you wouldn?t talk in that way,?
replied Jessie, turning away from him. ?I cannot
hear you talk in that way. Why, you do not even
know any of my family. How dare you speak so
to me ! ? But her eyes filled with tears. She had
allowed herself to think so much about him that it
was hard to say what she felt she should.
? How dare I! ? said Will indignantly. ? Have you
not been encouraging me this ever so long ? ?
? Encouraging you ? How ? ? faltered Jessie.
? Talking with me and meeting me?do you sup-
pose I think it was always accidental on your part,
any more than on mine ? Any way, you have been
so friendly that you must see you have encouraged me.?
? Oh,? she said quickly, interrupting him, ? now, I
see that my dear mother was right?l never thought


of it in that way. How stupid of me ! What shall I
say ? Will, Willie,? and her voice grew very plaintive,
? I am but a child, and I did not understand.?
Then Gibson relented. ? I am not blaming you ?
that is, I do not wish to blame you, dear,? he said.
And then he told her that he loved her very dearly,
and pleaded his cause with all the eloquence he could
command.
They were standing at the entrance of the cave, in
a scene of rare beauty. The sun shone on the hills
and mountains around, on the foaming water, and the
dark ferns that draped the crags and hung low over
their heads. The air was cool and pleasant, and
almost seemed to tremble with the roar of the great
waterfall. They were far from any habitation, far
from any haunts of men; it was a lonely place, with
only the birds and insects and one or two sheep in
the distance to hear or see anything that passed?
except for the One who is ever present, and who,
careless though she has been, still spoke to the girl?s
agitated heart.
o
? Do not say any more, I beg,? she implored.
? I must, Jessie, I love you so much. I want you
to consent to come with me at once, dear Jessie; we
have not far to go to Chinchester, where we can be
married. I will soon arrange everything,? ?he cried
impulsively,


? Married?your wife ! Willie, what do you mean ? ?
? What I say, Jessie; is it so very strange ? ?
? And you do not even know my parents, and they
have not yet made your acquaintance ! ?
?Never mind them. It is you I am thinking
about,? he cried impatiently. ? They need not know
anything about it.?
?What do you mean?? repeated Jessie, stepping
away from him, with a look of grieved surprise upon
her face, and unwittingly going near the edge of the
narrow ledge outside the cave.
O
Will threw his arm round her to protect her from
the danger. But, turning from him, she went back
into the cave.
?Jessie! ?and I love you so,? he pleaded, ?more
than any one in the world.?
?Oh !? she said, very pitifully. For she felt weak
with agitation, and intensely grieved to see now for
the first time what sort of a man he was. ? I know
you thought I was a foolish little thing, and that you
had only to state your wishes to have them granted.
And I am foolish and have behaved wrong ?mother
was quite right; but I think you might have thought
I was at least moderately good?that is, I mean, how
could you think I could do anything so wrong as to
grieve my dear parents so terribly and deal them such
a blow ? Ah ! Will, you have no parents, but, if you


had, would you not care to please them and carry out
their wishes more than anything ? ?
The young man winced. ? Don?t,? he muttered
hoarsely, as if stung by a sudden recollection.
?I know you would, dear Will,? continued the girl,
? and that you did not really mean what you said,?
And she looked imploring at him.
? Oh,? he replied, ? I am afraid I meant every
word. You see I love you so vastly, Jessie, that
everything else sinks into insignificance in my
mind.?
? Everything ? ? she said. ? Oh, Will! ?
?Everything,? he repeated. ?Do you not like to
be absolutely first in my estimation ? ?
?But,? said Jessie, looking up at the blue sky, with
her mother?s own sweet, tender light shining in her
' o o
childish face, ? have you forgotten, Will ? ?there is
God?and we, we are His creatures, and must do as
He would have us. I forgot it sadly myself, though,
when I did not obey my mother about being more
prudent?but I am sorry.?
? You are good, darling, and it is like you to think
of these things,? he replied hastily; and then added
boldly, ? But I?l care not for such things.?
Jessie began to cry; she could not imagine any-
thing more appalling.
Will tried to soothe her, but in vain, ?You would


not have me be a hypocrite, Jessie, and pretend what
I do not feel,? he urged.
But Jessie was inconsolable. ? I must go home,?
she added ; ? you, you are not what I thought you.?
? Certainly you can go home,? he replied bitterly"
? And I have no doubt you will be very happy among
your friends; and I?but no matter what becomes of
me. You once said you cared, but I think you said
more than you meant, and ?? and he hid his face
in his hands.
? I do care, Will, for you, so much that I would do
anything I could for j?ou that is right,? repeated Jessie
ao-ain and again, little knowing that a time would
O O' o
come in which she would verify her words at the risk
of her own life.


CHAPTER IV.
TOM WHITE.
? And more than once in days
Of doubt and cloud and storm, when drowning hope
Sank all but out of sight, I heard His voice,
? Be not cast down, I lead thee by the hand.
Fear not.? And I shall hear His voice again?
I know 7 that He has led me all my life.?? Texxyson.
E was a very worthy young
man, this Tom White, whose
love Jessie did not even per-
ceive, because, it seemed to
her afterwards, she had been
accustomed to it all her life.
Brave, honourable, true, and
upright, he was such a
Christian as the world does
not often see. For, as a
great writer has pointed out
more ably than can any
words of mine, there are so
many dwarfed Christians
? here below.? So many, that is, who, with eloquent


words, descant upon the mighty themes of religion,
who talk of righteousness and faith and love as ol
things very near and dear to them; who yet, in their
daily walk and conversation, display such faults of
word and deed, as bring reproach upon the name
they bear. And, again, many who, living blameless,
honest, upright lives, yet forbear to add to them the
crown and seal of all, by confessing the Lord Jesus
with their lips; and so, while the others bring dis-
credit on Christianity, they do not bring to it the
credit that they might. These are they who often
keep away from the Holy Communion ?that last
pledge of a crucified Redeemer?s love ?because they
see others going who are not so conscientious, so
honest, so charitable as themselves. But they are
dwarfs, too, better and in all probability far nearer
the kino-dom than those others, and still, would not
the Master say, ? He that is the least in the kingdom
of heaven is greater than these ? ?
Tom White, however, was no dwarf-Christian ; he
preached what he practised, and practised what he
preached. And he did not always find the world
perfectly smooth and easy to get on with. But
then, he did not expect it to be that. He knew trials
and temptations must and would come ; but he knew
that those who were looking for a home in a better
land than this ouq;ht never to succumb and sink


beneath them, but rise above them, looking ever
beyond to something higher and more satisfactory?
to the Hope that is set before us.
? There is a crook in every lot,
And an earnest need for prayer;
But the lowly heart, that leans on Thee,
Is happy anywhere.?
Something of all this Tom was thinking, as he
strode over the heather, on the mountain-side, that
tine morning on which Jessie and Will Gibson visited
the waterfall and cave, and were first so happy and
then so extremely unhappy together.
The young farmer had been up the great mountain
Pen Aramond, to see the shepherd who lived there
about his father?s and his own sheep being brought
home for the winter in the following month.
hen he started, in the early morning, he had
been low-spirited and sad, thinking of the trouble
which was looming over him, for he felt more and
more convinced that Jessies heart was estranged
from him. But since then he had been thinking
over everything quietly and calmly, and had come
to the conclusion that He who had led, guided, and
sustained him all his life would refuse from him no
good thing, and that in His hands he could leave
the whole matter, being confident that all would be
for the best, because He willed it who was Love itself.


Now his fine countenance was serene and even
cheerful, as he walked rapidly towards his home in
a direction which led him almost close by the large
waterfall.
Little knowing Jessie was so near, he scaled the
crags and dropped down into the valley almost at the
foot of the great fall. How it roared ! He stood
looking up at it a few moments until his attention
was arrested by some falling stones. Then he saw
Jessie and Will descending from the cave. They
were hand-in-hand, for Will was steadying Jessie?s
faltering footsteps down the rugged rocks, and seemed
to be the best of friends.
Thinking he was unperceived, and in much amaze-
ment and vexation, Tom turned to go away.
Scarcely, however, had he proceeded two or three
yards, when he heard Will exclaim, in very scornful
accents, just as he and Jessie stood once more on
terra firma, ? There is your swain?go to him, and
forget me as speedily as possible ! ? After which
remark he turned and hurried away.
Jessie stood looking after him as if she were
stunned. Then she gave a very bitter cry. She did
not see Tom. She scarcely understood what Will said,
but she realized that he was leaving her in anger.
In an instant Tom was at her side. ? Shall I brin^
O
him back, Jessie?? he demanded quite fiercely.


? W hat has he done ? Speak ! I can easily overtake
him.?
?Oh, Tom,? sobbed Jessie, seizing his hand and
instantly dropping it again as Will shot a parting-
glance at them over his shoulder, ? Oh, Tom, I am so
miserable, I should like to die ! ?
That was enough for Tom. He started in pursuit
of his rival, but returned immediately when Jessie
besought him with tears to do so.
It is all right,? she said; ? we?ve only quarrelled
about?about something.?
Tom made her sit down on a large boulder, and
O 7
begged her to explain what had happened.
But Jessie would say nothing except that they
had been very good friends till now, and they had
quarrelled. ? I don?t suppose I shall ever see him
again,? she said.
That would be all the better, thought Tom, but he
refrained from saying so. He was very gentle with
her. After he had brought her some water to drink
in a little tin drinking-cup he had with him for he
had had his dinner on the mountain, where he had
carried it in the early morning?he proposed to take
her home.
? But if you have been up Pen Ammond you will
be tired enough, and the way is very rough and steep
to our house from here,? she said.


? All the more need that I should accompany
you,? he said kindly. ? Come; ? and he held out
his hand.
?Oh, thank you,? said Jessie, taking his hand like
a little child. Such a firm, good hand it was. Round
two great rocks it supported her, and then the girl
stopped short.
?Well ? ? said Tom, inquiringly.
? Oh, I had forgotten ! What shall I do ? ? said
Jessie, helplessly.
? What about ? ?
? I don?t think I ought to let you take me home,
Tom.?
? Why not ? ? in surprise.
? Tell me, would it ?would it be encouraging vou ? ?
O O ?/
asked Jessie confusedly, blushing very much. ? Mother
and Will,? she faltered, as Tom did not immediately
reply, ? both told me that?that I should not en-
courage everybody.?
Tom?s face lighted up with a very pleasant smile.
? Come on,? he said simply, taking her hand again to
guide her round another rock.
?I suppose it?s all right,? said Jessie, following.
?Quite right, Jessie; don?t you seel am not a bit
encouraged ? ?
Yet he looked very much encouraged by something
or other. In his own heart he was thinking what


a child Jessie still was. Soon, however, he became
graver.
? Who is this Will, Jessie ? ? he asked.
Jessie told him that he was the gentleman who had
taken lodgings in the neighbouring farm, and that
she and he had often met.
? Do your father and mother know about it, Jessie ? ?
he asked.
?No, no; they do not know him at all,? she fal
tered.
Whereupon Tom gave her much good counsel. He
said that, caring for her as he evidently did, if the
stranger was worth anything at all, he would seek
to make her family?s acquaintance. ?It is very
wrong of him to want you to keep the matter secret,
Jessie,? he said. ?That alone is quite sufficient to
show me he is anything but a desirable friend for you
to have.? And he entreated her to tell her mother
everything. But this the girl shrank from doing.
? Then I will tell her for you,? said Tom.
? Oh, no, no, dear Tom,? implored Jessie. ?He has
gone away now, and I don?t think I shall ever see
him again. See, I will promise to tell you if he ever
returns to me. I will tell you everything that passes.
But they must not know at home.?
And, in spite of all Tom could say, Jessie would
make no other concession.


He was not half satisfied, for he thought he ought
to protect her from herself, as it were, by telling her
good mother about the stranger, lest he should return
and try to persuade her to be reconciled to him again,
let how could he tell of him when Jessie so
Oo
pitifully that every one might not know her sad little
secret ? He felt that he could not do it, and, yielding
to her wishes against his better judgment, he re-
luctantly left her in her ? Glen,? and went sorrowfully
home.
Not, however, without a silent prayer for help and
guidance for the girl who was so wilful, yet so win-
some.


CHAPTER Y.
OX THE MOUNTAIN
THOUGHT we should have
snow this morning, Mollie,?
muttered an old man, dressed
in a shepherd?s smock, which
hung loosely round his spare
and wiry frame; ? I telled
you so last night ?it was
such a cloudy sunset.?
?Yes, it was very cloudy,
Ben ; I thought, too, we
should have a storm, but I hoped not.
It?s a?most too much for you, now, to
have to go out in such weather as
this,? replied Ben?s old wife, looking at him rather
anxiously. ? It?s the rheumatics you?ll be having
again, if you don?t mind.?


I hope not, Mollie, and maybe it won?t be a
heavy storm.?
The two were breakfasting off a frugal repast of
oatmeal-porridge, at a small table, in a tiny apart-
ment in a little shepherd?s cottage on Pen Ammond.
It was about eight o?clock in the morning, but it was
still anything but light out of doors, for the air was
charged with myriads of large snowflakes, and a
dense yellowish white cloud hung over the great
mountain.
? Why couldn?t my lord?s bailiff send for his sheep
home before this ? ? muttered the old woman, after
a pause. ?Every one else has sent for their sheep
by now.?
?The fine mild weather we?ve had lately must
have tempted Mr. Woodford to allow them to remain
from week to week. Food will be dear enough this
winter for cattle and sheep.?
Fear enough! And they can afford it at any
price,? said Mollie bitterly. ?I hate such mean
ways.?
?Mollie, Mollie! ?
?Don?t Mollie me,? went on the old woman
indignantly. ?What?s a bit of money to them to
what your poor old life is to us? October is the
month for sheep to be taken down off the mountain,
and nobody ought to leave ?em till November.?


? But I must go and loot atter them. Foi Mi.
Woodford?s a hard man, a very hard man. and he?ll
visit it on me if any of his master s sheep be lost.
?Likely enough,? sighed Mollie wearily.
? How?s the lad now ? ?
?Right bad,? was the sorrowful reply; ?he was
cough ?cough ?coughing all the night. He s just
o-oino- after the others !
o o
? Av, ay; but I wish he could have a doctor.
? Doctors can do no good to such as he, muttei ed
his wife, stirring a mysterious decoction in a little
saucepan on the hre on the health, as she spoke.
? I think this?ll ease him a bit. But there?s no cure
for consumption.?
? How are you off for provisions ?
? There?s nothing but oatmeal, a little flour, a pound
or two of potatoes, a pinch of tea, and about a pound
of sugar in the house, and what 11 that be if vere
snowed up for weeks and weeks, as we have been
before to-da}? ? ?
The prospect was not lively, certainly.
? N ever mind; Mr. Moodfords bound to come up
to see after t|e sheep, and we?ll get some more food
one way or another. But I must be going,? said the
brave old man.
ï¿½ Stop a little. I shan?t let you go yet; it isn?t Mght
enough,? said his wife imploringly.


? Well, well, I?ll wait five minutes. It?s a wonder
that we never hear from our son Bill. I?m often
thinking that he can?t be living yet.?
?Very likely not; all the others have died but
m 33
iom.
? What a sprightly lad Bill was when he went to
London ! ? continued Ben musingly.
? I mind how he came runnin? back after he?d
started, to tell me that he was going to work hard
and win a right-down good home for me, and then
he was a-comin? back to fetch me and thee ?and I
was to wear silk and satin and live like a queen.?
And in the midst of her grief the old woman smiled
?a wintry smile?at the recollection.
? Ay, he was always a grand lad with his tongue.
Some are so, but when it comes to workin? they seem
to fail like. Not that I am say in? a word against
Bill. He was right enough till he got married. It
were that that changed him , before that he sent us
money and wrote regularly.?
?It was his wife?s doin?, sure enough. He said she
were a fine lady.?
?He must have got on to have had anything to
do with such. How long is it since he went to
London to try his fortune ? ?
? Thirty years come next Christmas. He was our
eldest, and he was fifteen.?


?And Tom?s twenty-eight now, and he was the
youngest.?
? And all died between, and Tom dying too ? ?very
dismally.
?Well, well, Mollie, the will of the Lord be done.
I believe all the bairns are in heaven.?
? And soon it?ll be all over with us too.?
? All over, Mollie ? Nay, that?s not like you. It'll
be just begun?the crown will and the glory.?
?Now, you must wrap up well, Ben,? said his wife,
as he took down a somewhat tattered overcoat from
its nail on the wall and proceeded to put it on. With
trembling hands, she warmed a thick knitted com-
forter and folded it round his neck, then she fetched
his shepherd?s crook, while Ben whistled for his dog.
It came bounding out of a tiny inner room, from
which a feeble voice proceeded, saying, ? Good-bye.?
? Good-bye, Tom lad,? said the old man, looking
in, ere he opened the outer door. ?Are you a bit
easier this morning ? ?
The sick man could not answer for a fit of couo-h-
-ing, which shook his worn frame violently. He was
lying on a low bed in the little chamber.
?Go to him, Mollie; give him something,? cried
Ben nervously. ?Oh, ray boy, my boy, I?m agoin? out
into the storm to look after my sheep, and the Good
Shepherd will look after you. Surely He takes


special care of the weakest and most sufferin? of all
His flock.?
Passing out into the now rapidly driving snow,
which darkened the early morning light, the old
man hurried away, with his faithful dog at his heels,
in quest of Lord Blackmore?s flock of sheep. He
knew where he should probably find them. But by
the time he came up to the timid sheep, huddled
together, their tails to the storm, in a very exposed
situation on the mountain-side, it was a difficult
matter for him, born mountaineer as he was, to keep
his footing. The wind blew in wild gusts, whirling
the snow in great dense masses against him and his
flock. It was piercingly cold. His hair and beard
were soon stiff as icicles; to linger there would have
been death.
But Ben Gibson never thought of lingering. As
rapidly as possible he collected the frightened sheep,
and, with the able assistance of his dog, brought
them down the steep slopes to a wide down, where,
though it was still exposed to the keen east wind,
there was not so much danger of their being buried
in snow-drifts.
Very worn and feeble was the poor old shepherd
ere he reached his humble home again through the
blinding snow, and very toilsome and hard was his
daily life; but he, too, shared the same sweet peace


which sustained Tom White in his very different
troubles,?the peace which, sooner or later, comes to
every one who trusts in God and does the work He
gives him?the ? duty in that state of life unto which
it has pleased God to call him.?

Singing alone in the morning of life,
In the happy morning of life.?

Perish all that fears the light;
" hether losing, whether winning.
Trust in God and do the right ?
Norm ax Macleop
i FTER Will Gibson left
Jessie so abruptly, he re-
turned to his lodgings in a
? o
state of great perturbation
and vexation.
? I never thought,? he said to him-
self, as he strode passionately up and
down his little front parlour, ? that
Jessie would turn out to have such
strength of will, and would be so seriously determined


to do only what is right and straightforward. I
thought she was a child, to be as easily influenced as
she has been hitherto by me. I little suspected that,
pliable as she was in anything which seemed innocent
to herself, she would take such a firm, uncompro-
mising stand against what she thinks wrong.? So he
chafed and fumed, and yet in his heart he admired
Jessie very much more for her present conduct. He
felt a greater respect for the goodness and uprightness
she had shown than he had ever felt for any one
before. His father had been unreliable, selfish, and
unscrupulous, and he had never been thrown in the
way of any good woman. His mother had been vain,
selfish, and ambitious, and her influence had been
paramount in his early childish years before she died.
Since then, circumstances of his father?s or his own
creating had helped to keep him ignorant of the
softening yet strengthening and x?efining influence of
high-class minds, whether feminine or masculine.
And Will Gibson was now for the first time realizing:
that there was a power ?the power to will and do the
right at any cost of mere feeling?of which hitherto
he had been only dimly conscious.
By-and-by, however, he became calmer, and re-
solved that he would try and make the acquaintance
of Jessie?s family. A low set, he told himself they
would be, meaning by that something quite different


from the idea we should connect with the term. He
thought they would be ignorant, unpolished, rough,
and unused to the ways of society, and so they were ;
but of that moral highness in which they were im-
measurably above himself he had not the slightest
comprehension.
Accordingly, he called upon Farmer Nicholson the
following afternoon, which happened to be Sunday.
The day made so little difference to himself that he
never thought others might scruple to receive visits
upon it. And when, on arriving at the farm, he
found the Nicholsons?all but Jessie, who had timidly
fled at his approach, she having seen him from the
window ?assembled in the parlour in their best
clothes, he did not know that the severe coldness of
his reception was due to the fact that they disap-
proved of his selection of a day upon which to visit
them. He did not get on at all well with them in
conversation either; they knew nothing of the world
in which he had hitherto lived, he nothing of theirs ;
mutual interests they had none. The visitor sat
down, tried to converse about farm subjects, of which
he knew nothing at all, and all the time he was long-
ing yet dreading for Jessie to appear, and getting
deeper and deeper into disgrace with the worthy
farmer and his wife.
?We have not seen you at church, sir, since you


came into this neighbourhood,? said Mr. Nicholson at
length.
? Well, no,? said Will coolly, ? I can?t say I?ve been
there yet.?
? A pity when a young man says that! ?
?You think so? Ah, well, opinions differ about
that. Perhaps, Mr. Nicholson, if you had not been
brought up to it you would not go either.?
?Sir, I hope I should always do what is right,?
said the farmer stoutly.
? Right, right ? ? thought Will in amazement; ? how
this family dwells upon that word! ? He could not
understand it at all.
? Well, I hope Mr. Richard will go out fishing with
me sometimes,? he said, rising to take his leave, and
turning with a pleasant smile to Jessie?s elder brother.
Dick coloured very much, and gently shook his
head.
His mother spoke for him. ? Thank you, sir,? she
said ; ? hut my Dick would scarcely like to go with
those who have been brought up ?they are your
words, sir, so I hope you won?t be offended?so
different from what he has. He looks for a blessing,
sir, upon his life; and he knows that God Almighty
will not give it to those who stand in the way of
sinners, and go about with the ungodly.?
?Softly, softly, wife,? said Mr. Nicholson gently.


?You see, sir,what she means is this : you are not out-
sort at all, and we think ? the like ? had better always
keep to ?the like.? You?re too much the gentleman
for us.?
? Nay, Richard, let us always say what we mean. It
is not the gentleman I object to in you, sir, said Mrs.
Nicholson, as severely as one so kind and gentle
could speak, ? but it?s because by your own showing
you don?t respect the Lord?s day, nor care for His
holy house; and ?and we should not like a child of
ours to learn such ways and notions from you.?
? Oh, of course, of course, it?s all right,? faltered
Will, feeling very much taken aback at the estimate
which Jessie?s family had evidently formed of him
upon a mere half-hour?s acquaintance. ? Perhaps,
he added, rather proudly, ? Mr. Dick would prefer not
shaking hands with me ? ?
?Nay, nay, sir,? said the farmer.
? Dick, make your best bow to the gentleman,? said
his wife.
Will slunk away, exceedingly out of love with him-
self for the first time in his life. He could not under-
stand how it was. He only knew that he had meant
to condescend to Jessie?s people, and they ?they
would have none of him. He was not good enough
for them; and in his heart he felt constrained to
admit that they were his superiors in high principle,


and some other points which were as yet all vague
and unfamiliar to his mind.
After that day he grew veiy moody, reckless, and
extravagant. He was often to be found playing cards
and gambling at the taverns in the neighbouring
O O
town; and there were rumours that he was sometimes
seen the worse for liquor.
The Nicholsons?all but Jessie?congratulated them-
selves upon having denied themselves the honour of
his further acquaintance.
As for Jessie, who can tell how often her gentle
heart was wrung at this time with ill-tidings of the
man for whom she cared not a little, though she had
checked his hasty love-making ?
W hen at last she had timidly returned to the parlour
that Sunday afternoon and had found he had gone,
leaving behind him such an unhappy impression upon
everybody s mind, she was exceedingly distressed?all
the more so that she dare not show it. For, if they
felt so warmly the undesirability of his acquaintance
for Dick, what, she asked herself, would be their
feelings it they knew that he aspired to her hand ?
Poor Jessie ' She had thought his fastidious taste
would be offended at her kinsfolks? roughness of
manner; not that they would be revolted by what they
saw and heard of him. She was glad no one but Tom
A hite knew of his and her attachment to each other.


For now she could sorrow in silence, and that, she
thought, was better than that every one should be
thinking and speaking of her trouble. So when the
bad reports to which we have alluded reached her ears
every now and then, she only grieved all alone, but
very bitterly, about them.
Jessie became very pale and wistful-eyed in those
days, and her father and mother held many an anxious
consultation together about her. Several simple
remedies for her health were tried, but in vain.
Nothing seemed to do her good, for nothing could
relieve her secret trouble.
Two months passed slowly by without Will anrl she
meeting again. It seemed as if they naturally avoided
each other. But Will did not leave the neighbourhood,
and Jessie knew?some innate consciousness told her
that she was not forgotten. She avoided the glen?
her glen, where she had so often seen him. Knowing
that she could say nothing different to what she had
already told him, she dreaded having to say it all over
again. So she sorrowed quietly and alone, except for
Him who is not far from any of His children in whose
hearts He has put good desires and the strength to
carry them into good effect.
But even under a thick cloud of gloomy sorrow
God?s sunshine has power to penetrate.
The weather had been unusually mild and pleasant


in October, but in the beginning of November it
changed suddenly, as we have said, and there was an
early fall of snow. Then there came another bright,
clear morning when the sun shone on the snow,
making it sparkle and glitter beautifully, while the
snow-covered mountains around added an air of
Alpine grandeur to the scene.
Jessie felt unusually light-hearted and comforted
about Will. Tom White had told her the evening
c*
before that, for her sake, he was going to try to
cultivate his acquaintance; and the honest fellow had
been, in return, so overwhelmed by Jessie?s intense
gratitude that he had wondered at himself for not
having thought of doing so before.
?Jessie, will you fetch me some water from the
ravine ? ? her mother had asked.
And Jessie had gone cheerfully, instead of making
some excuse, as she frequently did in those days.
After Tom?s promise the evening before, she felt that
she even dare encounter Will and reason with him
herself.
So, as she tripped across the snow, she felt so light-
hearted that she began to sing a quaint little song ;
? Where are you going, my pretty maid ?
I?m going a-milking, sir, she said, sir, she said,
I?m going a-milking, sir, she said.?
Certainly she did not look a very forlorn and heart-


broken maiden as she entered her glen, with the words
ringing out sweetly and clearly in the frosty air?
? My face is my fortune, sir, she said,
Sir, she said, sir, she said,?
and her cheeks were tinged once more with pretty,
healthful colour. She was so young and childish,
and had shed so many tears of late, who could take it
ill that she should forget all care, anxiety, and even
more serious thoughts for a little time, and warble as
unconsciously as the robins to whom she had thrown
crumbs that morning ?
O
Yet Will Gibson?s face darkened as he heard her.
He was waiting in the glen, hoping the bright morning
would tempt her to come there.
Jessie stopped singing when she saw him, and the
merry, childish face changed in a moment to a more
womanly expression of grave concern.
?Ah ? you can be very happy,? said Will, giving her
his hand; ?it is just as I said?you have your good
friends, and don?t care about me at all.?
? Don?t I care ? ? asked Jessie, very much hurt in-
deed at such a reproach. ? Why, this is the first
morning I?ve felt really happy for a long, long time.?
Will was some time, however, before he got off his
high horse, and it was not until Jessie?s tears were
falling fast that he condescended to say that he be-
lieved hex?, and tried to comfort her in his turn. He


liked to see Jessie cry about him ?it flattered his self-
love. Tom would have been terribly troubled if he
had caused her to shed a singde tear; but then Tom
was unselfish, and loved Jessie more than himself.
However, at last even Will was satisfied with the
sincerity of her concern for him, and he told her to
cheer up, for he was going to turn over a new leaf.
? And will you try to be good, Willie, and do nothing
but what is right ? ? pleaded Jessie.
? Certainly, if you will let me see you sometimes,?
he replied.
? But then, I must not meet you, Willie,? she said;
? that would be wrong;.?
? Then it will be no use my trying to be good, if I
shall never see you.?
?Oh yes, it will, for then everything will come
right; it always does when we do right and trust in
God,? she said simpl}?. And then she told Will that
Tom White was wishful to be his friend, and she
begged him earnestly to meet his advances for her
sake. ? Then you will become gradually acquainted
with father,? she went on earnestly. ?All Tom?s
friends are welcome at our house.?
? Very well, since you wish it,? said Will at last;
?though I am afraid I and he will not get on very
well together.?
That matter settled, he and Jessie had a long


talk. ? For the last time for ever so Ion?,? she told
o 7
him.
? All right; but you must hear my confession,? he
said. And then he told her that he ought never to
have lingered, tempted by the sight of her pretty
face, in that neighbourhood, for his father?s dvino-
??s J O
wish had been that, as soon as he could get free from
his office work, he should seek up his grandparents,
give them a letter from their penitent son, imploring
their forgiveness for years of estrangement and forget-
fulness, and endeavour to be himself the comfort and
support of their declining years. ?It seemed very
hard that I should be set such a task, Jessie,? he con-
cluded; ?and when I came here and found you, all
that you are, and dared to dream you might be mine,
I shuddered to think of claiming relationship to old
Gibson and his wife, who live in the shepherd?s hut
up at Pen Ammond, and I loitered about here, wasting
time and money, until now I have very little of the
latter left. And I think it is scarcely worth while to
seek them out now my funds are so low.?
? Oh, you foolish, foolish Will,? cried Jessie. ?If
my father had only known you were the grandson of
the honest old shepherd and his worthy wife, he
would have been ever so glad to have seen you, and
he and mother would have overlooked some of vour
strange town notions.?


?But would they ever have given you to me
darling ? ?
o
? They would have been a thousand times more
likely to give their daughter to the grandson of good
old Ben and Mollie Gibson than to any strange
adventurer from London town, were he ever such a
fine gentleman,? she replied, with dignity.
It was very strange, Will thought; he could not
understand such ways at all.
?Go, go, ad once,? said Jessie earnestly, with the
tears in her beautiful eyes, ? and perform this pressing
duty; then you will have Heaven?s blessing, whether
you ever win me or not.?
Will stooped and kissed her hand. ? I will, darling,?
he said. ? I will soon make up for everything, and
then I shall come and make your family like me.?
Incited by her faith and zeal, he set off that very
day for the mountain, with the intention of rapidly
repairing his former neglect and disobedience. He
thought of Jessie, of her beauty and goodness, con-
tinually as he went, and imagined that his own
strong arm and determined will would soon enable
O
him to carry out his purpose.


CHAPTER VII.
SHEEP-STEALING.
?The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together.?
Shakespeare.
in the
J i ; a.
morning of the
O
day on which Will
Gibson set off
to the moun-
tain, to repair
as much as
possible his
grievous disobedience to his father?s last wishes, a
stout but singularly stern-featured man rode a strong
cob up the other side of Pen Ammond, and reached,
with some difficulty, the little cottage where the
young man?s grandfather and grandmother resided.
The old couple were positively snowed in, for the
great drifts had been piled by the remorseless wind


against their door and windows until it was impos-
sible to open them from within. They might have
got out, certainly, if they had cared to pull down a
portion of the rudely-constructed roof; hut, knowing
well how difficult it was to repair a breach thus made
so effectually as to be proof against the furious blasts
of wind which were so frequent in that high region,
they preferred to wait a while and see if a thaw would
set in, or some one from the valley below might come
up to their assistance.
Mr. Woodford had sent for my lord?s sheep a day
or two before, and there was no pressing reason why
the old man should venture abroad. Their provisions
were scanty enough, though, and they ruefully con-
templated what remained of them, and tried not to
be too anxious on that account. In the mean time,
their son Tom was growing rapidly weaker, and they
felt that it might not be very long before the angel
of death visited their lonely tenement. It was a
very solemn time for the old people, on that lonely
mountain, surrounded by a glorious white world, and
raised far above all .sights and sounds of their fellow-
creatures.
? Hullo, Gibson, where are you ? ? shouted the stem-
featured equestrian, when at last he had come up to
the cottage, or what was to be seen of it from the
midst of an immense snow-drift. Mollie, who prided
herself upon having always been considered something


of a scholar, was slowly reading out of the Bible to
her husband and son, and none of them heard the
bailiff?for he it was ?until he had given a great
blow with the handle of his riding-whip at the top of
their door. ? Are you alive ? ? he shouted.
? Thank God,? said old Ben reverently, while his
wife screamed through the crack at the top of the
door that they were snowed in.
? I should think you are snowed in! ? cried Mr.
Woodford, springing from his horse and setting to
work at once to clear the snow away from the door.
It was a matter of some difficulty, however, unpro-
vided as he was with necessary tools, and the bailiff
was extremely hot, tired, and, alas! not in the best
of tempers, by the time the door opened sufficiently
to allow the old man?s spare figure to creep through
to his assistance. After that the work was soon over,
and Mollie had made up a good fire of peat inside,
opposite which she had placed the best arm-chair, by
the time their visitor was able to enter.
He did not like the peat, however, and, being
heated with his exertions, preferred to sit by the
door, as he told the shepherd that he was very much
displeased with him, for some sheep were missing
from Lord Blackmore?s flock, and he himself was not
satisfied with the explanation his servant had brought
him concerning them.
O


Old Ben was very indignant at this, but he dare
not say anything, except that he was ready to go,
there and then, with his patron to look for the
missing sheep.
More because he was desirous of leaving the objec-
tionable peat and the close little dwelling, and,
perhaps, because he wanted to talk to Ben without
being subjected to Mollie?s wrathful gaze, than from
any expectation of finding the sheep, Mr. Woodford
bade the shepherd follow him, whereupon they went
some distance over the frozen snow together. The
bailiff was riding, the shepherd following on foot.
? I don?t mean to say,? said the former, looking
back, ? that I suspect you at all of having robbed me,
only I think you should have taken more care of
them.?
?Indeed, it?s a heavy enough loss to me,? sighed
the old man, ? to lose for those missing ones what you
pay me a head for the sheep?s run on the mountain all
summer, and I?m poor enough. But sure, Mr. Wood-
ford, sir, no one could ever suspect me of doing any-
thing but what is honest and straightforward.?
?It must be rather tempting, though,? said the
bailitf, fixing his keen eyes on old Ben?s face, ? when
you and your family are all alone there and have
no meat, and the sheep all round about and no one
to see*?


?Sir ?Mr. Woodford!? cried Ben indignantly.
? Why, I?ve known when we haven?t tasted meat
for months, and have been all but starved, yet we?ve
never thought of taking one. Steal a sheep ! Oh,
how could we ? The blessing of the Lord maketh
rich, and we would not lose that blessing for all the
sheep in Lord Blackmore?s flock.?
The bailiff rode on in silence, with a sneer, or some-
thing like one, on his hard features. He was not
going to be taken in with that sort of talk, he
thought; he believed as much as he saw, and no more.
?If there are any sheep left hereabout,? said Ben,
? they?ll be on this side, sir.?
? What?s that ? ? cried the bailiff sharply, about ten
minutes afterwards.
It was a sheep, as the shepherd saw at a glance,
a poor creature that had its leg trapped in a hole
between two stones.
? It was such a fearful day when your man and me
collected them,? said Ben; ? and there was no coming
here for the keen wind, which was like to cut us in
two. We thought never one of them would have
stopped here, but this poor thing has been caught.?
? Leave it there,? said the bailiff; ?we can return
for it.?
They went on again, after Ben had released the
poor sheep, which was too lame to crawl far


After Ben and Hr. Woodford had gone, the sick
man, seeing his
mother look trou-
bled when she re-
turned to his bed-
side, begged her to
read to him out of
the blessed Book.
So she read of
the Good Shep-
herd?s loving: care
for His Hock. How
He went after the
lost until He found
it. How He called
His own sheep by
name, and how
they should never
perish ; neither
should any man
pluck them out of
His hand.
? Wouldn?t it be
beautiful, mother,?
said poor Tom, ? if
He were to come
into the house now ! ?


? Aye, wouldn?t it! ? she replied; ? and how He?d
look round for His poor ailin? lamb ?that?s you, Tom.?
Tom?s ej'es shone. ? How soon He?d make me well,?
he said.
?And how I should love Him for it,? said the
mother enthusiastically. ?Why, I?d kneel at His feet
and ?
?What?s that?? interrupted Tom.
There was a loud knocking at the outer door. The
o
old woman hastened to open it, marvelling that there
should be such an extraordinary influx of visitors on
that particularly cold day.
She dropped a curtsey when she saw apparently a
very well-dressed young gentleman standing there.
? Grandmother,? said Will Gibson, for he it was.
? And who be you ? ? said Mollie, in her shrill treble.
?Your grandson, Will Gibson.?
?Aye, sure,? she said quickly, ?you?re your father?s
ain child. Come in, come in.?
Mollie Gibson was a very happy old woman for the
next half-hour ; the news of her son?s death scarcely
sobered the delight with which she welcomed this
O
tine voung grandson, because, as we have seen, both
J C 5 o
Ben and she had long given him up for dead.
Will Gibson, for his part, was very much touched
by the genuine outburst of affection with which he
was greeted, especially as he had brought nothing but


himself to the poverty-stricken abode, with the excep-
tion of his father?s letter, which was put aside until
Ben?s return. The young man was really distressed
to find how grievously ill-off his poor relatives were,
and the emaciated condition of the sick man, his
uucle, considerably discomfited him. While he had
been wasting the money his father had left him, over
all sorts of selfish indulgences, these poor relatives of
his had been destitute of actual necessaries. And yet,
he speedily found out that Mollie was insisting upon
his drinking the very last tea she had in the cottage.
? I can?t stand this,? he cried, springing up. ? I
have a little money, here it is,? flinging a very poorly
supplied purse on the little table. ? Make uncle some
broth, some beef-tea, an} T thing, grannie, only do not
let him starve in this wav.?
? Alas, my boy ! ? was the sorrowful reply, ? where
can I buy meat up here ? And I doubt I can never
reach the town in this weather.?
? What a simpleton I am; I forgot there were no
shops here! Never mind, grannie; I?ll fetch you-
some.? And, seizing his hat, Will rushed out of doors
? Stay, stay, and rest thee a bit first,? called his
grandmother after him. But, never heeding her, he
ran off.
His thoughts were in a whirl of remorse, penitence,
kindly feeling, gratitude, newly aroused dutifulness,


and a number of as curiously mingled feelings, which
all culminated in one intense desire to give those
poor haggard creatures some of the nourishing food
of which they were both in such urgent need.
Was it strange then, that when, just as he was
beginning to be out of breath and conscious of the
difficulty of keeping up such a pace in the snow, he
came up to a lame sheep, stumbling along painfully,
he should stop and look at it wistfully ?
? What good broth it would make for uncle ! What
splendid mutton chops for the poor old grannie ? ?
he thought, glancing quickly around to see that he
was not observed.
It is a case of necessity,? he murmured again,
?here, where there are no shops,? and he set about
trying to catch the sheep. He had no thought of
stealing, this young man who was accustomed to
take everything he wanted from life, without weigh-
ing each circumstance to know whether it was right
or not. He would have had no objection to pay for
the sheep if he had seen any one thereabouts to
whom he could have done so, though he could ill
afford the money; but since the sheep?s owner was
not there, he simply took what he could get, and,
easily capturing it, killed the frightened animal with
his pocket-knife. Then for the first time he felt a
doubt as to the wisdom of his rash proceeding. What


should he do next ? To carry the sheep to the shep-
herd?s cottage seemed too barefaced. He was spared
the trouble of further deliberation, however, by the
appearance of old Ben and the bailiff above him on
the mountain-side, they having returned for the
identical sheep he had just appropriated.
?Help! help! Stop thief! Stop sheep-stealer!?
cried the two men, hastening towards him.
In a moment it flashed across Will?s mind that he
had committed a crime, the punishment for which
was in those days transportation for life.
For one minute he stood almost glaring at his
excited grandfather and the exceedingly hard stern-
looking bailiff. For one minute he considered whether
he should confess everything- to these two men, offer
to pay for the sheep, state who he was, and that
he had done it for the sake of his dying uncle and
poor old grandmother, and throw himself upon their
mercy. Then, craven-hearted as he was, he turned
and fled, down, down from that bleak upland, slip-
ping, stumbling, yet running rapidly over the steep
slopes, pursued, at first, very feebly by the old shep-
herd, and for a much further distance by my lord?s
bailiff on his horse.
Almost in despair, at length, Will dashed down an
almost perpendicular place. Mr. Woodford being
bv that time much excited, urged his horse to


follow. The poor animal fell, he was thrown from its
back.
Will escaped, but, to his extreme misery, heard the
bailiff s parting cry, ? Sheep-stealer, I have seen your
face. I know you.?
Alas, he did ! Will, who had often seen him, knew
him, and knew, too, that he was a most determined
man, who was likely to insist upon no mercy being
shown to one who had committed such a crime and
led him such a chasa


CHAPTER VIII.
SORROW AND LAMENTATION.
? Our sorrows are no phantoms of the night,
No idle dream,
No cloud that floats along a sky of light,
On summer sheen;
They are the stem realities of earth,
Friends and companions even from our birth.?
Bonar.
gHERE was great distress in the shep-
herd?s cottage on Pen Ammond, there
was much consternation, mingled with
curiosity and horror in the town and
among the farmers in the valley, much
excitement among the police, bitter
? all the more bitter because it had to
lietly suppressed, in a girl?s heart at Mr.
sou?s farmstead, and dark despair in the
herd?s cottage on Pen Ammond, there
was much consternation, mingled with
curiosity and horror in the town and
among the farmers in the valley, much
heart of the fugitive criminal before that day
was over.
It would he difficult to describe poor old Mollie


Gibson?s consternation when, upon the return of her
husband and the bailiff, she learnt what had occurred.
She listened, as if in a dream, to the invectives Mr.
Woodford showered upon the wretched thief, and to
her husband s honest indignation.
To think he should have attempted to take the
sheep off before our very faces ! ? cried the old man.
?Such a thing hasn?t happened all the time I?ve
been shepherd? nigh upon fifty years.?
? Benjamin, tell me what he looked like,? cried his
wife in great agitation.
? Why. ï¿½ld woman, what does it matter to you ? ?
he asked in surprise.
? Tell me,? she repeated in trembling accents.
Mr. Woodford quickly described the uncommon
appearance of the sheep-stealer, eyeing Mollie keenly
as he did so.
Benjamin, its our grandson,? she cried.
Our what ? ? the wondering shepherd asked.
?Our grandson, our own Wills boy.? And his
wife hastened to relate what had passed since he and
the bailiff had left the cottage.
It was some time before the shepherd understood
and would give credence to such a tale, and it was
only upon opening his son?s letter?a very penitent
one, enclosing a cheque for two hundred pounds?
that he believed the unhappy man whom he and the


bailiff had just been pursuing for such a fearful theft
was his own grandson.
Mr. Woodford could scarcely conceal a glance ot
triumph at his early suspicions about the temptations
to sheep-stealing up there being thus satisfied. Tet
even he, upon witnessing the genuine griei of the
unhappy grandparents, told them that, in this case,
he did not believe they were to blame.
He informed the old people that ill had been
residing for some months in the valley below, and
that he had seen him in the town once or twice when
he was the worse for liquor, and more than once
when gambling. ?So he will not have a good
character to plead,? he said, in conclusion, ? and I am
afraid things will go hardly with him.?
ï¿½Will any of this compensate ? ? faltered the worthy
shepherd, touching the cheque, which he valued tax-
less than the honour of his family.
"Would you bribe me to prevent the law having
its course ?? replied the bailiff. ? Though lam soiry
for the disgrace which will be attached to your name
?the similarity of which with young Gibson?s did
not occur to me before,? he added more kindly, as
even he was somewhat touched by the sight ol so
much grief.
? Aye, he?d seem a different sort to us,? sighed old
Mollie. ? Wasn?t he grand and beautiful just ? To


think that he could stoop so low as to steal! ? And
she wrung her hands and wept.
I can scarce believe it,? murmured old Ben.
But, father, you don t know how he rushed away,
just before, eager to bring us meat and all that sort
of thing,? said the sick man. ?We had told him it
was weeks since we had tasted meat or broth?
The bailiff was listening eagerly. ?You will have
to be a witness about that,? he said, rising to go.
A hard man, a very hard man, was Lord Black-
more?s agent.
I shall ne\ er be that, do not fret, mother and
father,? said Tom. ? The lad meant it kindly towards
us. Though he did such a wrong deed, he did not
know what he was doing. And, Mr. Woodford, sir,
I shall never be a witness against my poor deluded
nephew.?
Tom was right. Before his deposition could be
formally taken down, his weary frame was at rest,
and his chastened spirit had left the mysteries of pain
and sorrow here for the bright light beyond, where
the secrets of many hearts shall be revealed.
Through the snow, followed by a little band of
mourners, the last son of old Ben and Mollie Gibson
was borne, and deep was the sympathy felt by the
dwellers in the valley for the disgrace and trouble
which had befallen the poor old mountaineers.


For overy one knew by that time about tbe sbeep
stealing, though the sheep-stealer could not be found,
all the vigilance of the police having failed to discover
his whereabouts; he was sought for in all directions,
but in vain.
Only Tom White suspected, only Tom White con-
nected his disappearance and concealment with the
growing pallor of Jessie Nicholsons face, and the
brave, determined light in her bright eyes.


CHAPTER IX.
IN THE DARKNESS OF NIGHT.
? Though the crag be stern and steep,
On, on my course must sweep,
I may not stay.?
Sip. E. Grant.
a wild, dark night: the snow
has disappeared, and dismal
November rain beats pitilessly
upon every object, animate or in-
animate, out of doors. The wind
is very busy, and blows in wile
gusts over the mountains and
through the hills, or rather between
them, with more concentrated fury.
It is extremely cold ; the wind is
east, the rain only seems to be one or two degrees
re moved from snow in its extreme chilliness, and the
hour is late?one o?clock a.m.
What, then, means that solitary girlish figure.


stealing through Farmer Nicholson?s orchard and
O O
down into the ravine and then up stream with swift
unfaltering steps ? Can it be Jessie, the laughing,
childish Jessie, who so recently overturned the
contents of her water-can upon the dry moss-covered
stone out of the innocent mirthfulness of her merry
heart ?
It is, it is. But why is she out so late, and why
is she so defenceless, and so exposed to all inclemency
of weather or other evils which may be abroad ?
Let us watch her. In her left hand she carries
a small dark lantern, which sheds a faint light before
her rapid footsteps. Upon her right arm she bears
a covered basket, an old shawl has been hastily
thrown over her head ?she has had no time to study
costume. On she goes, with unfaltering, eager tread;
above her a few stars twinkle silently at intervals,
as the intervening clouds disperse and the rain ceases.
The moon has not yet risen: how the girl longs for
its friendly beams! Sometimes, as she is hurrying
on, she slips and falls, and once she is so unfortunate
as to overturn her lantern, putting out its candle.
With a little cry, she searches for her tinder and flint
(that is not the time of matches; at any rate, they
are not in common use in that out-of-the-world
district); but she cannot strike a light there, in the
howlmv wind that is blowing. On she stumbles as
O ï¿½


best she can in the dark, and now she has to cross
the stream, creep round rocks and crawl along narrow
ledges, with chasms on one side and wild slippery
crags on the other.
And we find she is going alone and in the dark
along the same way which she went to the waterfall
where she met with Will that fine September morning
when we first made its acquaintance. Does she think
now of the handsome young fellow ? Does she re-
member how painfully full her thoughts were of her
secret friendship with him as she came along there
that day, and how she found him at the waterfall ?
Think of him ? She thinks of little else. The thought
of him sustains and nerves her for all the dangers and
difficulties of the way.
We will tell our readers a secret. She is going to
him. Yes, while all the neighbourhood is searching
for his hiding-place, or is, at any rate, intensely
curious respecting it, Jessie has hidden him in the
cave by the great waterfall.
This was how she did it. One day, when she was
sitting weeping bitterly in her glen on his account,
she felt a light hand on her shoulder, and, looking up,
perceived him stooping over her. He was very much
changed: his eyes were wild-looking and bloodshot,
his hair was matted, his clothes torn, and he was thin
and apparently half starved. Jessie had had no


f R7
word of reproach for
him then, nothing but
tender pity.
? Go to the cave by
the waterfall,? she had
said. ? I will come to
you there as soon as I
can, and I will bring
you food; it may be
night before I come,
but I will not fail you.?
Ever since, night after
night, when J essie?s
family were asleep, or,
at any rate, had retired
to their own rooms for
the night, the girl had
stolen down from her
little chamber,and,with
the food that she had
managed to secrete dur-
ing the day, had gone,
as now, to her lover?s
hiding-place. The food
was not missed in the
house: how should it
be when it was so


plentiful and so homely, that a little more used, one
way or the other, did not much matter ? Besides,
the boys often went into the larder to get their
own provisions, if they went out to plough or for
any other purpose unusually early in the morning,
while it was the family custom to give liberally of
brown bread, etc., to any passing beggar. Then,
when Jessie took eggs, bacon, or anything even better,
she always calculated how she would repay it by
giving up something of her own for the general good.
And the food meant life or death to the man who
loved her so. For Will?s love for her is real enough,
and, now that he is in such trouble, she owns she
loves him too.
W hen she has reached the foot of the waterfall,
to-night, Y ill is waiting for her, and receives her with
a muttered blessing.
How is it you have no light ? ? he inquires hoarsely.
Jessie explains her accident.
? Give me the lantern,? he says, ? and I will light it
in the cave, then I will return for you. You might
slip, my darling.? And he hurries up to his tem-
porary abode. When he returns in a few minutes, he
finds Jessie has sunk down, pale and trembling, on
the damp earth.
In a short time, however, feeling better, she is able
to ascend with him to the cave.


A fire is burning there, and a little kettle sings
cheerily on the stone beside it. There is a rug, some
logs of wood, a cup, and the little basket Jessie has
brought. She takes her provisions out of it, very
sadly, with many regrets that she has not been able
to carry more.
? Now, I will make you some tea, Will, she says.
? See, I have brought a little jug this time.
But Will does not answer. He has covered his face
with his hands.
? Willie, Willie, what is the matter ? ? she asks very
anxiously.
? How long is this to go on ? he says. ?It is too
dreadful. Hiding here day after day, thinking such
wretched thoughts all along. With no hope, no help
anywhere.?
? Oh, Willie ! there is God,? she says tearfully.
? But I have sinned against Him all my life.?
?Jesus came to save sinners.?
? It?s all very fine for you to talk, Jessie, but I have
believed such things were not true too long to turn to
them with any comfort now when Ive none else-
where,? he whispered moodily.
? None, Willie ? ?
?Except you, darling; you?re the sweetest comfort
in the world. But, you see, my anxiety about you is
so terrible. Every night I think you may break your
neck on the way, or be found out.?


? Oh, but, Willie, I am so careful.?
There was silence for a few moments in the cave.
The unhappy man was crouching down, with his face
hidden in his hands, and his whole frame shaken with
convulsive sobs. Jessie was endeavouring to make a
O
little tea in the jug she had brought, while the tears
were silently flowing down her pale cheeks.
? I must go,? said Will, at length. ?I must run for
it. If I had only sufficient money to pay my passage
to America, I could do well there. No one would ever
find me.?
But how to get the money, that was the difficulty.
?Let me tell Tom White all about it,? said Jessie,
after several plans had been discussed. ? I am sure
he would give the money; and he is so kind and good,
he would never tell.?
But Will shook his head. ? I dare say he would
gladly pay the money to be rid of me, Jessie,? he
said; ? but I imagine he might think it would be
wrong to help a criminal to get off to another land for
the purpose of escaping justice here. And I dare not
risk the danger of telling him.?
o o
? Well, at all events,? said Jessie, rising to go back,
?you must stay a few days or weeks longer where you
are, until your searchers become weary of their fruitless
quest.?
? 0nl J a few days, then,? said Will disconsolately.


as he assisted the girl down the steep rocks from the
cave.
? And, meantime, we don?t know what may happen,?
she whispered hopefully, taking a tearful leave of
him.
The next night was a fine, clear, starlight one, and
Jessie sped on her way to the cave very cheerfully,
and without any of the dismal fears that beset her
sometimes, making every black rock look like a hidden
spy-
The girl was very happy, for in her bosom she
carried a little packet, containing a considerable sum
of money.
That very morning, her mother had shown her
where she kept some gold concealed for her three
children. ? There is no trusting in banks in these
days, Jessie,? she said; ? and when you were all little,
your father and I put by what we could spare for you,
resolving to keep it separate from the house-money.
This is your share, it is thirty guineas,? she added,
taking up a little packet. Jessie had asked to hold it
in her hand, and, somehow, when they quitted the
room half an hour afterwards, the packet was con-
cealed in her dress. The girl had stolen the money
from herself for her poor lover. And, therefore, she
was very glad as she hurried along towards the cave
under the bright starlight.


Now it chanced that that night Tom White had felt
unable to sleep. Again and again, as he tossed on his
uneasy pillow, the thoughts of Jessie?s pale and worn
often anxious-looking, face came unbidden to his mind,
until he determined to rise and go to her father?s
house, at least, that he might see the roof which
sheltered her whom he loved so very dearly.
Thus it was that, as he had stood gazing blankly
up at Jessie?s window, he had been startled by an
intervening something which crossed the garden, and
disappeared from sight in the farmer?s orchard.
ith quickly aroused suspicions, Tom hastened after
the dark figure, and all the way to the cave that
evening he followed Jessie at a little distance, himself
unseen. Not from curiosity, not even for the purpose
of frustrating her intention did he follow her, but
from the sole desire of being near to help and protect
her should she require it. As soon as he had dis-
tinguished her figure?her face was concealed by the
shawl over her head?he had been sure she was going
to Will; and when, upon reaching the waterfall, the
latter came down and assisted her to climb up to the
cave, he was not at all surprised.
But he was surprised, when, upon their disap-
peai ing inside, he saw that other figures were creeping
stealthily round the high crags.
One, two?six, what did it mean ? Surely, surely


Jessie had been watched that night by others beside
himself!
How Tom wished he had intercepted the girl?s
journey! If he had only prevented her going! But
there was no time for such thoughts. Already the
foremost figure had reached the ledge outside the
entrance of the cave. His companions quickly followed.
Soon they were hovering about the place, their daik
forms looking terrible to the horrified spectator, who
now hurried after them.
Before, however, he had reached the foot of the water-
fall, he heard cries of terror and despair from the cave.
The police had seized their prisoner.
All hope of escape was lost now; there was nothing
to be done for him.
But Jessie ?
Even the rude men, who had followed her to seize
her lover, pitied the hapless young woman, as she
clung to the wretched, abject-looking prisoner.
When Tom entered, therefore, they turned with
relief to him, crying, ? Take her away; this is no
scene for such as she.?
Come, Jessie,? he said, laying a kind, constraining
hand upon her shoulder.
? Oh, no, no; I will not leave him ! I cannot go 1
He meant no harm. He was just beginning to try
to do what was right,? she sobbed.


? Fity he did not begin a bit earlier,? said a gruff
voice.
? Ah, but he could not. He was not taught when he
was a little boy, as we were,? she went on pleadingly.
? Go, Jessie, go,? said the prisoner hoarsely.
?You must go ?words can do no good,? said the
men in rough but not unkindly accents.
?Come,? repeated Tom, ?you can do no good.?
? Go,? said Will again; adding, with sudden admira-
tion of her brave, courageous conduct penetrating
through all his selfish fears and despair, ?you have
done what you could for me, my darling. You can do
no more.?
And, at last, Tom was able to support Jessie,
half-fainting, from the place, and take her home to her
parents, to whom he told the whole unhappy story
before leaving her to their loving care.
O O
In that, too, he thought to spare the unhappy
maiden the painful necessity of an exceedingly painful
speech.


CHAPTER X.
IN THE SPRING-TIME.
? Many waters go softly dreaming
On to the sea;
But the River of Death floweth softest
By tower and tree;
? And down to the silent River
By night and day,
Men and maidens wander ever,
And pass away.?
B. M.
NE fine morning in the following
spring, when the whole sky
was one triumphal arch of
blue, and the larch - trees in
Jessie?s glen were bursting into
beautiful bright green foliage,
Mrs. Nicholson appeared at the
farmhouse door with her arms
full of shawls and cushions. These she arranged


cai efully on the bench outside, while Josy brought a
footstool, which he placed before it. Then both dis-
appeared inside the house and returned with a pale,
wan-looking invalid, whom they seated as comfortably
as possible on the bench in the warm sunshine, cover-
ing her up jealously with the shawls, and speaking
in low, hushed voices, as if a sound might be too much
for the delicate life which had so long been shaken to
its foundations.
It vas Jessie; but there was slight resemblance
in her dull, listless countenance to the merry, light-
hearted, and, it must be owned, sadly foolish Jessie of
former days, or the brave, resolute maiden?the heroine
of the nightly expeditions of which we have been
reading.
Thank you, Josy; thank you, mother,? was her
quiet response to all their loving care and anxious
solicitude.
Jessie, you can watch my white pigeons here,
and you can even see the lambs on the opposite hill,?
said her young brother fondly. Then fidgeting, as
} ouths of that age will, at the restraint of being in
attendance on an invalid, however dear such an one
aiay be to them, he volunteered to chop sticks for
his mother.
Aye, do, my boy,? she replied, pleased to let him
go. And when the strokes of his axe came ringing


out clearly and regularly from the yard, she was still
telling Jessie what a good young fellow he was, and
how devotedly attached to his sister.
?When we thought we should lose you, my child,
she said, with a little break in her voice at the
recollection, ? I never saw anything like the trouble
those lads were in; and Tom White, too, he was just
as bad as any of them-nay, I think he was almost
worse, if there could be a worse than worst. But I
must go and see to my work. Call me if you want
anything. But I shall be watching you from the
window.?
Jessie was not sorry when she, too, went away,
though she felt half penitent at being so. She loved
her mother dearly, and knew that nothing could
exceed the sympathising tenderness of her care over
her ever since that terrible night when Tom White
brought her home from the cave by the great water-
fall. She had been very ill since then, and had
lingered long at death?s door. Now she was recover-
ing, but so slowly that she was still a great tax upon
the energies of her devoted nurse.
She did not feel to care very much about anything
in those days. But this morning she was very con-
scious of one pressing idea, namely, that it was the
second day of the great assizes at Chinchester, and
tha* Will Gibson?s fate was probably already settled


one way or another. Therefore she wanted to be
alone, that she might think and wait ?think and
wait until Tom White returned from Chinchester,
as he had promised he would, to put her out of her
suspense as soon as possible.
So she leaned back against her soft cushions, listen-
ing wearily and hopelessly?she expected no good
news?for the sound of horse?s hoofs and Tom
White?s manly voice.
The doves cooed softly about her, the little lambs
called to their dams, the murmur of rippling water
ascended from the streamlet flowing over the rocks
in the ravine, but she turned wearily from the sweet
rural sounds with hungry longing towards the long,
stony Chinchester road.
At last, after what seemed to her long waiting?it
o o
was only an hour by the eight-day clock inside the
kitchen?the sound of horse?s hoofs could be dis-
tinguished. Nearer and nearer they came. And,
with her hands clasped and her pale face flushed
once more with sudden eagerness, Jessie watched
Tom White draw near.
He checked his horse at the garden gate, dis-
mounted, threw the bridle over the gate-post, and
came towards her.
His face was very solemn.
The colour died out of Jessie?s when she saw it.


?It is all over, Jessie dear,? lie said gravely. ?But
it is better than you think.??
? How ? Has he been let off ? ?
?How could he he?? answered Tom sadly. ?It
was a great crime, Jessie.?
? But his motives,? she murmured, ? they were so
good : would not they plead for him in court ? ?
?In our poor courts of law,? answered Tom, ?they
don?t weigh motives much. But Will Gibson has
gone to a higher tribunal, Jessie, where motives are
all-important. Thereat is well-known that the poor,
badly-trained fellow was in such terrible remorse and
penitence that he rushed to do the first thing that
occurred to him, instead of waiting to find out how
he could best repair his wrong-doing.?
? What do you mean ? ? faltered Jessie, trying to
comprehend words which seemed to bear no meaning
to her bewildered mind.
?Will was found dead in his cell this morning;
he was worn out with grief and?and all that he had
been through. But the chaplain spoke well of his
attention and interest in what he read to him yester-
day. Jessie, it was about the dying thief,? said Tom
gently, with averted face. He could not bear to see
her pain.
But she was not listening: she had fainted.
Tenderly they carried her indoors out-of the bright


sunshine charged with sweet sights and sounds of
spring; lovingly they tended her.
Will was dead?why should she live ?
?Live to repair a little of what he did amiss,
Jessie,? said Tom, one day when he was sitting with
her.
? How can I ? ? she asked.
? There are his two poor old grandparents to look
after.?
Jessie shuddered. ?He did it for them,? she
said.
?Yes; but his doing it was nothing but a grievous
wrong, and a fearful trouble to them.?
? Have they not some money now ? Was there
not a cheque for a large sum in that note he took
them from his father ? ?
?Yes; and they have come down to live in the
town upon it. But they are very lonely and strange
to the life there. It is all so different to the life they
have lived so long upon Pen Ammond. They have
no child left. People will impose upon them. They
need a daughter?s care.?
That roused Jessie. And, recovering steadily from
that day, she found the best balm for a bruised and
broken heart was in the exercise of kindly thoughts
and deeds for others; and in attending to the old
people, Will?s aged grandparents, she forgot much


of the bitterness of her own grief, and grew more
content?yes, more glad and full of peace at last.
Sorrow may endure for a night, but even the
longest, darkest night comes to an end some time,
and no healthy nature keeps the blinds lowered that
it may moan over the night when another day?s
bright beams are shed abroad over the world.
-Amd Jessie found the best of all solaces in religion
?her religion, which, though she had acted so weakly
and foolishly at first, had made her cleave to duty
when it vas hard to do so, and which made her ever
full of love, the love which gives up everything, life
and all that makes life dear, for others.
By-and-by, when the grass had long been green
above Wills grave, and his old grandparents had
both followed him to that ? bourne whence no traveller
returns, Jessie consented to become Tom?s wife.
? Only you must give me time,? she said, ? because
it is all so new, so strange; you must wait a little
for me.?
And Tom waited gladly. Had he not waited
sorrowfully many a long month and 3-ear ? So he
waited until, at length, he had his wish.

A HEROINE OF HOME
CHAPTER I.
WORKING AND TALKING.
? Wit can spin from work a golden robe
To queen it in.?
Jean Ingelow.
T was not that Sarah Morri-
son disliked work so much as
that she had a feeling that
she was a little ill-used which
caused her to look gloomy
and dissatisfied, as she went
about her household duties
one dull, grey, cheerless day
in March.
She was the eldest dauq-hter
o
of a large farmer in one of
?Mr eastern counties, and, though only twenty years


of age, was already a person of considerable import-
ance in that most truly womans sphere ?her home.
Sarah was very glad to be useful. She liked work;
and when, owing to the hard times for agriculturists
just then, one of the two maid-servants had to be
dismissed, she had very willingly stepped into the
breach, and, with the labour of her hands, materially
assisted to make the domestic wheels continue to run
as smoothly as they had ever done before. That
morning she had been up by five o?clock, and had
made many pounds of beautiful fresh butter before
she took her place at the breakfast-table, where she
always sat at her mother?s right hand, to assist her
to pour out and look after the little ones. Mrs. Morri-
son was not very strong, and, therefore, was unable
to exert herself much; but she was the centre of light
and cheerfulness in the home, and the beautiful
beloved mother of nine boj-s and girls.
Sarah was the eldest, and the youngest, Tottie, was
not much more than two years old. After Sarah,
came Mary and Anna, who had both left school the last
Christmas, and come home ? for good, as they called
it in their merry schoolgirl fashion. Sarah was glad
to have them at home, for it was very dull for her
when the boys were at school, and only the little
ones of all remained in the house. And she and her
mother had agreed that ? the two dear girls ? must be


encouraged to keep up what accomplishments they
had acquired, and to study a certain time every day.
? For I know how easy it is to forget what we learn,?
the wise mother had remarked; ? and their education
having been some expense to their father and me, I
should not like them to lose the advantages they have
had.? At first Mary and Anna had eagerly agreed to
everything that was suggested, and, besides practising
diligently on the old piano and drawing, reading
French, history, and travels methodically, had given
? a helping hand ? many times to the daily house-
work, and so, with a touch here and there, con-
siderably lessened their sister?s many duties.
But they were very young, and by-and-by these
new brooms began to sweep rather less promptly and
carefully, and, under the delicate mother?s gentle
regime and the comparative freedom of their present
life, they became a little lazy and lax in the perform-
ance of their daily duties.
Therefore it was that Sarah?s face was clouded that
busy day, and she was tempted to think it was not
fair that they should do just as they pleased, while she
had to work so hard.
?I did not mind so long as they were getting on
with their studies,? she thought, as she made some
great meat-pies for the farmhouse dinner; ? but when
they come down as late in the morning as they did


to-day, and loiter over their breakfast, and and all
that sort of thing, it is too bad.?
And then there was another thing that vexed her.
Being so useful at home, and the eldest daughter, hex-
own school-time had been limited, and she felt that
her younger sisters thought a little slightingly of hex-
inferior attainments in the way of music and draw-
ing. They could not think she was ill-read, for every
moment she could spare was usually devoted to
books, but they had dates and names of places more
ready to hand, when the conversation txxrned on his-
torical or geographical questions, and they had begun
to answer for her, as a matter of course, befox-e she
could think what to say when she was appealed to on
such subjects.
? Sarah, mother says you?re a King?s daughter,?
said the six-year-old Bobbie, entering the kitchen
just then, and stax-ing at the great pie his sister was
placing in the oven.
The girl looked round with a very red face. ? What
nonsense, Bobbie ! ? she said. ? Don?t make fun of me
when I?m so busy. Run away.?
Bobbie set off obediently towards the door, but
when he had reached it he turned his chubby face
round to say, ? I not make fun of you, Sarah; mother
says so really?yes, really.?
?Run away, Bobbie dear; I?m busy,? said Sarah,


turning back to her work. But as her light hands
handled the rolling-pin, again and again her thoughts
recurred to that strange thing Bobbie had said. And
when the little urchin put in his curly head at the door
again in a few minutes she called him to her.
?Bobbie wants something good,? said the child,
looking wistfully at some hot pastry which had just
been taken from the oven.
? That is not good for you, dear,? said Sarah.
However, she went across to the store-room, and
brought her little brother a roll of gingerbread. Then
she sat down before the fire and took him on her
knee.
? hat made mother say that ? ? she asked.
? \\ hat ? ? asked Bobbie in return, with his mouth
full of the sweet cake.
? About me ? ?
? What about you ? ? The little boy had forgotten
that which ten minutes before he had been so eager
to disclose.
Sarah reminded him.
Oh, I know. Cause she was telling us what our
names meant, and Anna said, why did she call you
such an ugly name ? I don?t like it neither,? said
Bobbie candidly. ? And she said it was a beautiful
Bible name, and it meant a princess; and a princess
is just a king?s daughter.?


?So it does.?
Sarah was very thoughtful And all that busy
morning, and all the afternoon, as she taught Bobbie
and two little sisters to read and write in the large
dining-room, she was thinking over and over again
about that word princess.
? Mother,? she said, when the children had gone to
bed, and most of the work of the busy day was over,
? let us have a quiet little talk here by the dining-
room fire, while Mary and Anna play their duets in
the drawing-room.?
Accordingly the mother and daughter were left
alone; for the busy farmer had gone to look after
something out of doors, and the schoolboys were
learning: their lessons in their own room.
But there was silence in the dining-room at first.
Sarah wanted to begin a subject which still she
shrunk from mentioning.
?A princess,? said her mother at last, laying her
hand fondly on the pretty bent head. For Sarah was
very good-looking \ the early hours she kept and the
healthful active work, too, caused her to possess quite
a brilliant complexion, and her figure was well-
developed, light and active.
? Oh, mother,? she said, ? don?t. If you only knew
what an ignorant common drudge I feel myself
sinking into 1 ?


? Sarah, how is that ? ?
Well, I have to slave so
Stop, said her mother hastily. ? Never, never say
that, my dear. ? Slave ! ? Why, the work, the house-
work which you do so well, is your badge of servitude
to the Master, who came not to be ministered unto,
but to minister. He said the servant should be as
his Master, He, the King of kings, has given you.
His daughter, these things to do for Him.?
? Oh, I know, I know; but I keep forgetting.?
? Let your name always remind you of it, dear ; for
I chose that you should be called Sarah because it
means a princess.?
A princess ; said Sarah wonderingly; ? a princess !
Why, mother, I think you could not have chosen a
more inappropriate name.?
? I think not,? said the mother softly. ? I chose it
very carefully; for I have always noticed how the
Bible teaches the importance attached to names.?
?Yes, I know. Angels brought messages from on
high to say what Ishmael, John the Baptist, and our
Lord were to be named.?
? He Himself changed Simon?s name to Peter.?
And how often the names of other good men were
changed, from the time of Abraham to that of St.
Paul But, mother, why did you choose Sarah, a
princess, for me ? ?


? The King?s daughter is all glorious within,? said
the mother gently. ?I wished to remember always
that you, too, should remember as you grew up
you are.
There was silence in the room, except for the steady
flickerincr and crackling of the bright fire, into hich
the mother and daughter were gazing, and the distant
sound of ? Zampa,? which duet was being played with
much ability in the other room.
? And you know,? continued the mother, that
your Father?s kingdom is in the hearts ol all His
people; and you, too, may be a ruler under Him in
that kingdom, if you seek the right means ot reigning
by love and wisdom.?
?Yes ; and I must not think people are against me,?
said Sarah thoughtfully.
?You must, with God?s help, win their hearts by
love, and keep them by wisdom ?both gifts ot His
Holy Spirit; and I think lam not wrong in saying
the tools your Father has given you to work with tor
that end are just the daily, humdrum tasks which lie
ready to your hand.?
? Ah, the common round, the daily task. But you
do not know, mother, how I long to do some great
thing for Him, who has done so much for me. And
the girl?s voice trembled with eagerness; for she
was one who loved her Lord and believed that all her


sins were forgiven, for the sake of the Lamb who was
slain that she might live.
O
*Do the little things first. The great things will
come as soon as you are ready for them.?
Thank you for my name, ? whispered Sarah, when
she said ? good-night ?to that dear mother; and she
went upstairs with her mind full of great and noble
resolves to live henceforth as became a Kind?s
O
daughter.


CHAPTER II
DUTY AND JOY.
? Not once or twice in our rough island-story,
The path of duty is the way to glory:
He that walks it, only thirsting
For the right, and learns to deaden,
Love of self, before his journey closes,
He shall find the stubborn thistle bursting
Into glossy purples.?
Tekntson
DIE passed, and, realizing as
she now did, the beauty and
significance of the name by
which she had been baptized,
Sarah went on cheerfully work-
ing and waiting, working and
waiting-; every day almost the
same, and yet every day prov-
ing her ? royalty ? more clearly
by additional nobleness and
grace, which caused her to win
all hearts, from the rough but kindly maid-of-all-


work, to the stern though excellent father, who was
so proud of his eldest daughter.
Mary and Anna, being good, teachable girls, soon
began to vie with each other in their endeavours to
please their kind sister, and also to copy her example.
It was surprising what cheerfulness and high-minded
resolve on her part were able to accomplish. Love
lightens labour. And happy people?and by that I
mean those who take things in the happiest way?
always get through the world the best.
Certain it is that children love those most who are
ever ready to laugh and play with them, and Sarah?s
little sisters and brothers thought no one was equal
to their Sarah.
One day?it was Shrove Tuesday?she had taken
them all into one of their father?s large fields to play
with oranges, as was their wont upon that day, if
the weather were fine and the oranges come-at-able.
It was a lovely afternoon in spring. The sky was
of an almost Italian blue, the budding foliage of a
clear bright green, and the grass of a darker, fresher
shade than it had been for several days. The birds
chirped and warbled merrily about the trees and
hedges on every side, and all Nature seemed to be in
its happiest, gladdest mood. Sarah sat down upon a
hillock studded with daisies, and threw the orano-es, one
o ?
by one, into a little hollow for the children to run after.


It was unusually warm for the time of the year.
But Sarah was not afraid of the sunshine spoiling her
complexion, and, when the little ones were happily at
play among themselves, she drew a small volume from
her pocket and began to read. The words she read
were these: ? When we speak of joy, we do not speak
of something we are after, hut of something that will
come to us when we are after God and duty. It is
a prize unbought, and is freest, purest, in its flow,
when it comes unsought. Wo getting into heaven as
a place will compass it. You must have it in you,
as the music of a well-ordered soul, the fire of a holy
purpose, the welling up, out of the central depths, of
eteimcd springs that hide their waters there. It is the
rest of confidence, the blessedness of internal light and
outflowing benevolence ?the highest form of life and
spiritual majesty
Half closing the book, Sarah mused a little on those
words. She knew what the joy there spoken of was,
for that prize, ? unbought, unsought,? had encompassed
her round about while she had been taking thought
for others. In her heart she felt that she possessed
? the music of a well-ordered soul, the fire ot a holy
purpose, the welling up, out of the central depths, of
eternal springs that hide their waters there. ?
? Good morning, Sarah,? said a cheerful voice just
then, and a tall, broad-shouldered young man, in a


GEOIiOK BLAKELEY'S VISIT,




sailor?s dress of dark navy blue, with gilt buttons, stood
by her side, raising his hat and holding out his hand.
?How you startled me, George,? she said, rising
and offering her own quite frankly.
The two had known each other all their lives.
George Blakeney was the second son of a neighbour-
ing farmer, and he was three or four years older than
Sarah, who had always been like a sister to him. He
was not handsome, but there was a fine, earnest
expression about his tanned, weather-beaten face, and
every line of his well-knit figure showed manly and
not ungraceful strength. His eyes were very blue, and
his glance singularly straightforward and penetrating.
? May I look at what you are reading ? ? he asked,
after he had seated himself beside her.
? See,? said Sarah, showing him the passage. ?Is
not this true and beautiful ? ?
?It is very nice,? he said simply, as he returned
the book. But the way in which he uttered the word
nice spoke volumes.
?Oh, George! oh, George!? cried the children, rush-
ing up to him ; ? come and play with us.?
Young Blakeney amused them for ten minutes or
so, then he shook them off and returned to Sarah.
? I should think yours is a very happy life, Sarah,?
he said rather wistfully.
?Why??


? Because you are so plainly in the path of duty,?
he replied earnestly, adding, ? It is always so very
evident that the path of duty is the path of safety.
? I suppose every one is in the path of duty,? said
Sarah.
?Not necessarily. Some are apt to rush wilfully
or blindly into any path that pleases them at the
time. But, to return to you, I can imagine nothing
more delightful than the busy, happy, useful, and
emphatically good life you are leading.?
?I am very thankful for it,? said Sarah; ?still, at
times, it is not all sunshine, you know, and grassy
meadows, blue skies, and happy children.?
?No; I suppose everything is not always couleur
de rose ,? said George more thoughtfully.
? I can assure you it is not. Sometimes it is very
hard to rise at half-past five and work all day at little
simple tasks and trivial duties, which any kitchen-
maid might do as well, and especially when one wants
to read a new book or some good article in the
newspaper.
?And especially when one?s sisters are perhaps
gloating over the article in question instead of helping
you ! Poor old Sarah, it is too bad! ? exclaimed Anna,
who had come up unperceived.
? Oh, I was not complaining, dear,? said Sarah;
? only George would have it my life was so enchant-


ing, that I was obliged to put in a little shading
as a sort of background'.?
? But, I say,? said George, ? I think you and Mary
should make it a little easier for Sarah.?
?Yes, I think so, too,? said Anna; ?and in token
thereof, I will return to the house to undertake my-
self the work to which I was going to summon this
one; ? and she playfully tapped her sister?s shoulder,
and, making a comical face, retired towards the house.
7 O 7
? Anna is very good-natured,? said George, delighted
that Sarah had not been obliged to go in, ? and you
should get her to help you more.?
?And take away some of my pleasure.? And then
Sarah told George how discontented she had been
growing, and what her mother had said about her
o o*
name.
?It just suits you, Sarah,? he said, when she had
ended; ?.and it reminds me of two lines which have
been running in my head ever since I read them.?
? What are they ??
? ? Only be humble ; ministry is might,
And loving servitude is sceptral rule.?
They are Mr. Bickersteth?s words,? he said,
? They are exactly like mother?s : that in His king-
dom we rule, or rather influence others, by serving
faithfully ourselves.?
There was a slight pause, and then George began


again to say that it was such a good thing for Sarah
to feel that she was in the path of duty.
? Any one would think you believed you were not,?
she said, ? to hear you talk,?
?Sometimes I wonder if I am,? he replied. ?You
know it was very wrong of me to run away to sea
when I was a boy; and father was quite right to
wash his hands of me in a measure, and make me
stick to what I had chosen. But it has been a hard
life; and having to obey all sorts of low-minded men
is anything but agreeable at times. You have no
idea, Sarah, what it is like.?
? There must be many hardships and difficulties,
I am sure,? she said softly.
? I should not mind any hardships and difficulties,
though, if I only were not so bothered and hampered
with doubts about not being in the right place, and
how far one ought to obey man when it does not
seem right to do so. As I read somewhere, not the
conflict between right and wrong, but the conflict
between duty and duty is the most severe.? And he
sighed heavily.
? Poor George ! ? said Sarah ; then she added, ? But
will not your position be better now you are going to
be first mate on board the Britannia ? ?
?Yes; I shall be directly under the captain, and
hall have more authority myself.?


? That will be better.?
George did not immediately reply; he was looking
gloomily around. The sun had hidden itself behind
a cloud, others were beginning to gather overhead.
The children were out of sight.
? An emigrant ship going to Australia, vid the Cape,
is not exactly the desideratum of one?s dreams,? he
said in a low voice.
? When do you sail ? ? asked Sarah, with just a
trace of anxiety perceptible in her sisterly voice.
?Very soon indeed now. I expect a letter daily.
Oh, Sarah,? and the young fellow?s voice grew
strangely husky, ? it is very hard to go this time.?
? I shall miss you very much, George; but the time
will pass quickly when we are busy. You see,? she
added, half-apologetically for her evident concern,
?my brothers are so young, and you have been like
an elder brother to me always.?
?Is that all, Sarah ? Is it only a brother ?? he asked
hurriedly, for the children were coming up to them.
? How ? What do you mean ? ? she faltered.
But it was too late for any confidential reply.
? Rain! rain! ? shouted the children, running up.
And, indeed, some large drops were alreadj'- falling.
George Blakeney mounted Tottie on his shoulder,
and Sarah took a hand of each of the next youngest
Then they had a run for it, and no mistake, for


down poured the rain in torrents; and iosy cheeks,
tumbled hair, and wet clothes were some of the
consequences of wkat had caused that particularly
interesting tete-a-tete to be thus suddenly interrupted.
But before he went away that evening George
found an opportunity to ask Sarah if she would try
to think of him as something nearer than a brother.
And the girl, having been much attached to him all
her life, thought she, perhaps, might succeed in doing
so when he was away on his next voyage.
?And you will give me a decisive answer on my
return ? ? pleaded George.
That, too, Sarah thought might not be impossible.
And George, having great hopes of being in a much
better position as regards this world?s goods, on his
return from this next voyage, deferred trying to gam
any more definite answer till then, that he might have
a better case to lay before Mr. Morrison, when he
asked for the hand of his eldest daughter.
The Britannia sailed in the beginning of June,
with George Blakeney on board in the capacity of
first mate.
And Sarah remained to ? qneen it in her home by
the sheer force of ? loving servitude.?


CHAPTER 111
SUSPENSE AND FEARS.
? Complain not that the way is long?what road is weary that leads
there ?
But let the Angel take thy hand, and lead thee up the misty stair,
And then with beating heait await the opening of the Golden Gate.?
Adelaide Anne Procter.
ELL us a story, Sarah; tell
us a real nice story,? begged
the children, one hot after-
noon about two months
after George Blakeney had
gone.
Sarah smiled rather a
melancholy smile, and said
she could not think of one
at present
But the little ones were
not to be so easily silenced. They crowded round


their sister, so that she found it impossible to continue
darning the little blue sock, through which her needle
had been gliding so swiftly just before.
Come on, Sarah; begin, begin/? they cried.
? It?s so hot,? said Bobbie.
? And we?ve nothing to do,? said his next brother,
Walter.
? And ?and you must tell us a story,? they all con-
tinued in a chorus; ? please, you must, you must, dear
Sarah ; you must! ?
? But I want to get on with my work.?
?You shan?t, you shan?t! ? and little hands jogged
Sarah?s elbows, while tiny fingers unthread her needle,
saucy faces laughed defiance, and finally their lively
young owners ran away with the great work-basket,
leading their sister such a chase after it, upstairs and
down, as hindered her fully a quarter of an hour.
? Had ever any one such rebellious little subjects ? ?
asked Sarah, when they returned to the dining-room,
of her delicate mother, who was resting on a couch by
the window.
Mrs. Morrison smiled. ? Suppose you give in this
time,? she said, ? and so conquer by submission ? ?
? How ? ?
? Conquer their hearts for another time, when it
may be more necessary for jou to have your own
way, by complying with their request now.?


?You dear, artful mother!? said Sarah. ?But I
will take them all out of your way?that will be the
best thing I can do for you, for I know your head
aches. Come with me, children,? she added; ?we
will go and sit under one of the trees by the streamlet
in the home-field.?
? Hurrah! hurrah! come on, come on,? cried the
little ones, dancing with glee; and soon they were all
grouped round their eldest sister, under a large elm,
with a merrily dancing brooklet flowing a few yards
from them. They looked down upon the brightly
gleaming water, and above their heads the dark
leaves, swaying gently in the slight breeze, screened
them effectually from the hot July sunshine.
?Begin! begin!? said Sarah?s impatient little
brothers and sisters.
The girl?s head was resting for a moment on her
hand, and, as she tried to think of a suitable story,
her face looked very pale and anxious.
?Don?t hurry Sarah,? said little Bobbie; ?she?s
trying to think which is nicest.?
Sarah smiled. ? Shall it be a new one, or some of
the old favourites ? ? she asked.
?Oh, a new one.?
? Very well. This is a German story which I came
across one day, and I thought it was such a pretty
one. You will see it cannot be quite true, and yet it


has a true and beautiful meaning; and it is about the
dower called in Germany ? Heaven?s key,? which is, as
far as I can make out, our pretty primrose.?
? Oh; but begin the story ! ? said one or two plain-
tive little voices, to whom all this was mere detail,
and totally uninteresting.
? Once upon a time,? began Sarah, in a low, clear
voice, ? there was a little boy whose mother had died
and gone to heaven; and he was so lonely and
unhappy then, that he was always longing to go to
heaven too, that he might be with her. So he asked
every one he saw to tell him which was the w
there; and every one said he must wait until he was
sent for. But the little boy did not like waiting?he
wanted to go at once; so he kept asking and asking
the way there of every one he met, until a man said,
no doubt to quiet him ?
ï¿½ Well, you must run to where the sky touches the
earth, and there you will find the door to heaven.
? So the little boy set oft' running. He ran and ran
and ran, but the further he went the further oft
appeared the place where the sky seemed to touch the
earth; and at last he was so tired he could not run
any longer; so, finding himself in a meadow among
pretty flowers and long soft grass, he lay down and
went to sleep.
??He had not slept long, however, before he heard a


rustling and stirring among the grass and flowers
around him, and, opening his eyes and leaning forward
on his little elbow, he saw a number of beautiful little
children, dressed in white, with gold crowns on their
heads, dancing and playing on the soft grass.
? As the little boy watched them eagerly, one of the
children, perceiving him, asked if he would come and
play with them.
That I will, said the boy; and, springing up, he
danced and played as merrily as any of them, until
the sun began to sink in the sky. Then the children
all fell into a line, two and two together, and began
walking down the meadow.
Where are you going ? * said the child.
? ? Back to heaven,? said the little children; for the}'
were little angels.
? ? Oh, ma y I come with you ? ? asked the little boy,
entreatingly.
?The children looked doubtful. ?We don?t think
you?d be let in,? they said.
? ? Let me try.?
? ? Very well.?
? So they all went down the meadow and up a steep
blue hill, until they stood before a great golden door.
The children knocked, and the door opened imme-
diately, revealing to the little boy just a glimpse of
beautiful golden streets, people dressed in white, and


many other lovely things. The next moment, an old
man, in a long white robe, with a crown of gold upon
his head, stood in the doorway, smiling down upon the
children as they passed him and went in. But when
it came to the little hoy s turn, he did not smile on him.
? ? What are you doing here ? ? he asked instead.
? ? I want to come in, too,? replied the child, oh, so
earnestly.
??You cannot come in,? said the old man, very
gravely.
? ? Why not ? ?
? ? Because you have no crown.
? Then the little boy begged hard to be allowed to
enter heaven. But the old man shook his head, and
sobbing bitterly, the child went down the steep blue
hill until he reached the meadow.?
? Oh, Sarah, and what did he do then ? ? asked
Bobbie and his brothers and sisters with one voice.
? What little boys often do when they can?t have
what they want,? replied Sarah. ?He cried, and
cried, and cried, until he had no tears left to shed
and then, which was more sensible, he sat up and
tried to think what he should do. A minute after,
jumping up, he began to gather as many primroses as
he could find, and, when he had got his little pinafore
full, he sat down, made a wreath as quickly as he
could, and put it on his head.


?Then he climbed up the steep hill again and
knocked at the golden door. It dew open, and once
more the old man stood there looking down upon
the child; but when he spoke, his voice sounded very
stern.
? ? What! you here again ?? he said.
??Yes,? said the little boy, pointing to his wreath of
primroses; ? I have a crown nou\
??And you may come in,? said the old man;?for
now you have the crown of simple faith.? Touching
the wreath of flowers lightly with his hand, it changed
instantly into a crown of gold such as the little angels
had worn.
? And then the boy entered the beautiful city, and
his late companions came forward and showed him all
the beauties of heaven.?
? Oh, what a beautiful story! ? cried the children.
? It?s the most lovely, lovely story in all the world.?
? But can you tell me what it means ? ?
No; you tell.?
Sarah paused. The children waited, with rosy
upturned faces, almost breathlessly for her to speak.
A thrush in a hawthorn-tree close by poured forth a
burst of joyous melody.
? Listen ! ? said Sarah, ? That thrush does the will
of God as far as it knows how when it makes such
sweet music. The little child of whom I have been


telling you was told that he could not enter heaven,
without a crown, so he went at once and got the best
one he could obtain, and he believed that that would
cause him to be admitted. And so the old man at
the door said he had ? the crown of faith,? and he was
allowed to enter heaven.?
? If I made a wreath of flowers and climbed up that
big hill,? said Bobbie, pointing to a slight elevation at
the other end of the field, ? should I be any nearer the
beautiful heaven ? ?
The other children laughed, and the little boy
coloured and hung his head. But Sarah commended
him.
? That?s right, Bobbie,? she said; ? it?s always well
to try and follow a good example. Children,? she
added earnestly, ?let us try all our lives to win the
crown of faith, by which alone we can enter the
2'lorious heaven.?
Then, not to weary them, she told the little ones to
play at a new game she had thought of. This was
that she should place something light, such as a piece
of bark or a flat stick or broad leaf in the stream, and
that each boy and girl should look after his or her
boat, as they might call these articles, and follow
them, as they floated on the water, to the end of the
field, to see which would get there first.
The children were delighted with the idea, and


away they went after the merry streamlet through
the pleasant pasture-land.
Their sister remained under the tree, and soon her
face was hidden in her hands, while not a few tears
fell quietly there where she was unobserved by any
human eye.
That was a trial-time for Sarah such as she had
little dreamt of having to pass through, and it was
not easy for her always to possess that faith of which
she had been talking to the children. She thought
o o
that no girl bad ever had such a trouble to bear as
was hers, little knowing that nothing is more common
than such a feeling when one is undergoing trial, just
as when one is in physical pain it always seems as if
it would be easier to bear in any other place than the
precise locality where it is seated. Very soon after
young Blakeney?s departure, Sarah had discovered
that there was no doubt at all as to what he was to
her. The brightness of the sunshine seemed to have
gone out of her life for many a day after the Britannia
sailed for Australia. She had had two bright cheery
letters from him, speaking hopefully of the future, and
hinting that his talks with her had done him good,
making him more determined than ever ?to trust in
God and do the right,? no matter how difficult it
would be. And then, she had been so glad and
thankful, and so stirred up herself to act up to the


same high aims. Again her step was as light, her
voice as cheery, her face as bright as it had ever been,
for she ?carried music in her heart.? But, one day ?
how long; ago it seemed?the following letter had
O O '
arrived for her. Sarah drew it out now and read it
with tear-dimmed eyes, though, indeed, she knew its
contents by heart.
? My dear Sarah,? it said?and the most common
style of commencement was charged with meaning to
the girl George loved, ??We are rapidly approaching
the Cape, where I hope to post this letter to you, and
I am almost distracted with the old terrible contest
between conflicting duties. Our ship is crowded with
poor emigrants, amongst whom disease and fever are
making sad havoc; one after another the poor things
are dying, while their sufferings are aggravated and
the mortality increased by the very insufficient and
most improper food which that scoundrel ?I can call
him nothing less ?our captain, orders to be given them.
I will not give you details; for why should 1 harrow
your mind in dear old England with the daily horrors
I witness on board this fever-haunted vessel ? \\ hole
families swept off at once, children wailing for their
parents, parents for their children; and as I write
there is a young fellow sitting opposite me, with a
look upon his face of such despair as I hope you will
never? witness, for the girl he is to marry is ? down


with the fever,? and he has been to beg and pray of
the captain for a little beef-tea or broth or something
that they may hope will give her a little strength.
But in vain; the fellow?s invariable reply to all such
appeals is that the invalids must have the sort of food
for which they have paid. ?lf he begins to make an
exception,? he says. But why should I distress you
with what that mean wretch utters ? The whole crew
are in a state of indignation and only want a leader to
cause them to mutiny. Sarah, my own, only love,
shall I tell you what thought came to me last night
%J O o
as I witnessed the frequent sight of a hasty burial at
sea?that of a young husband, whose pretty wife will
find herself, by-and-by, alone and unprotected in a
foreign land ? It was something about one being sacri-
ficed for the many. It was, dear Sarah, that, after
we have left the Cape, if this sickness and distress
continues, I should take upon myself the command of
the Britannia, imprison the captain in his cabin,
devote the whole available space in the ship to the
poor over-crowded emigrants, supply them with proper
care and nourishment, save as many lives as possible,
and, when we reach Australia, flee into the bush
before the captain can hand me over to the authori-
ties.
? There, it is soon written, but it means a good
deal. It puts an end to past and future promotion


for me in my calling ; it means being imprisoned if I
am caught; and, meantime, if I fail in securing the
captain?s person, he might kill me in self-defence.
? But then, again, is it not plainly my duty to do
the right as far as I can see it, to save these poor lives,
regardless of the consequences to myself? No one else
but I can do it. lam first mate. Around me are the
Everlasting Arms, above me the beautiful blue sky, and
on all sides is the ocean, to which our ship, with its
cargo of sin and suffering, oppressor and victims, is
but a speck, an atom. And at home is Sarah ; and I
know whatever happens, she will act as becomes her
name, as one of the noblest and best of women.'?
The letter terminated here somewhat abruptly; it
had been posted from the Cape of Good Hope.
Poor Sarah, what dreams of hers it had destroyed 1
Visions of George?s return in a few months, and of the
?decisive answer? she would then give him, and of
his delight in hearing it; hopes of a happy future
with the man she loved so dearly; expectations that
by-and-by he would be promoted to the rank of cap-
tain. Many, many charming fancies lay shattered on
every side. George, if he had carried out his inten-
tion, was subject to an indictment for mutiny, when-
ever the law could get hold of him ; the future was all
vague and dark. Perhaps George was already dead,
if his attempt had failed, and the captain, ruffian as


he was, had dealt him his death-blow. He, the cap-
tain, might say it was in self-defence. George had
taken up the cause of the poor and suffering, who
would plead for him against the strong and powerful ?
Poor Sarah?s faith was at a low ebb just then, and she
did not realize that, since his motives were so pure, he
would be under the protection of the One who had
first of all trodden that steep and toilsome way to
save the sick and dying?souls sick with sin as well
as with bodily infirmities, and those dying slowly yet
surely by the varied ways in which the angel of death
carries every one away from this terrestrial sphere.
So she sat and sobbed under the elm-tree, and
thought drearily that hers would always be a sort of
widowed life in future. At any rate, she told herself,
whatever had happened, it would be so for years, if
not all along. And it seemed to her a little hard that
this thing should have occurred. Why had it hap-
pened to her, when other girls had such happy, pros-
perous love affairs ? Why should she and George be
chosen by some freak of fate ? No, those were wrong
and wicked words which Sarah mentally erased from
the tablet of her heart; but why, ah, why did God
Almighty allow this grievous thing to happen, that
these two, who loved each other, and wished above all
things to please Him and do His will, should find life
so very difficult and unkind ?


Yet never for one moment did Sarah allow herself
to disapprove of her hero?s contemplated behaviour.
Ignorant of the discipline on board ship, she never
thought for a moment that there could be any doubt
about the correctness of taking the law into his own
hands. She looked at it simply as a giving up of him-
self for others, a laying down of his life, as it were, for
the brethren, a martyrdom for what he saw to be right.
And, by-and-by, she remembered his words about
herself, that she must bear this trial in the best and
noblest way, as became her name, that of a King s
daughter.
But if only she were sure, she said to herself; it was
the suspense that was so hard to bear, the not know-
ing whether he were dead, or in prison at Sydney, or
a fuoitive in the bush: or whether this thing had not
O y
happened, and he was even now on his way home.
It was just possible the sickness might have abated,
or the captain might have yielded, or any one of the
scores of possibilities which her excited imagination
conjured up might have occurred.
Just possible ? but in her heart Sarah knew the
reverse was the more probable, and she could not
hear just then, across the troubled waves of her dreary
fears, the sweet, hope-inspiring words of the One who
says ever to His fainting disciples, ? Why are ye so
fearful, oh ye of little faith ? ?


CHAPTER IV
UNCERTAINTY AND SORROW.
? When sorrow all our heart would ask,
We need not shun our daily task,
And hide ourselves for calm;
The herbs we seek to heal our woe
Familiar by our pathway grow,
Our common air is balm.?
The Christian Year.
F religion is the source of the
purest and most unalloyed
joy in daily life, what is
it in the time of sorrow ?
When the heart is oppressed
with grief as unexpected as
it is overwhelming; when
the aching, tear-stained eyes
look around restlessly, yet
almost hopelessly, in search
of comfort; when memory is
all a pain, and the Psalmist?s injunction to us to ?put


not our trust in princes, nor in any child of man
rises unbidden to our minds; and when the cisterns of
earthly water have been tasted and found powerless
to quench the thirst of those immortal beings who
can never, never be satisfied with anything less than
the Water of Life ; ?then it is that the soothing ? halm
of Gilead ? reveals its healing, glorious efficacy, and the
bruised and wearied lamb is carried by the Good
Shepherd to those higher levels, where no evil can
come near it, neither can any plague come nigh its
dwelling-place.
At Mr. Morrison?s farm the hay-harvest was well
over, and the stacks already thatched with clean firm
bats of straw, while the hay-chambers were full to
overflowing with tlieir still warm and odorous contents.
Fruit of the berry kind in the large garden had been
gathered, bottled, and preserved by the diligent hands
of Sarah, aided by her younger sisters; and apricots,
plums, and apples were already ripening in the
orchard and against the garden walls, giving promise
of more work and more plenty for the inmates of the
busy household. The midsummer holidays had come
to an end ?for it was in the time of the old-fashioned
half-yearly terms ?and Sarah?s brothers had recom-
menced their busy school-life. And, now, the fields
were ripening to the harvest, and a sea of golden-headed
corn, on every side of the large farmstead, was gleam-




.


ing in the sunshine or swaying and bending as the
wind swept over it.
Everything looked bright and hopeful, and seemed
literally to beam cheerful prosperity. Only in Sarah?s
heart there was gnawing anxiety and the sickness
long-continued of hope deferred. Her face grew daily
thinner and paler, her step less buoyant, her eyes
more dim and lustreless. Day after day she prayed
that she might know the will of her Heavenly Father
in this matter. Certainty, whatever it might be, was
what she longed for, and it was just certainty that was
denied to her. Her better self told her she must wait
and trust, her lower nature craved for some assur-
ance, some sign of the Fatherly will Meanwhile
she was very sad and dejected, and though she did
her work bravely and well, ?the heart nigh failed
her many a time when she thought of Georo-e
o o
Blakeney
It was good for her that she had much work to do ;
it was good for her that there was not any time to
spare for brooding and moping over what she could
not help ; it was good for her that sheer bodily fatigue
made her sleep well at nights, and necessity caused
her to rise early and begin the labour of the day
before most girls were out of bed.
Sometimes she thought it was hard that she should
have so many duties pressing upon her, when her


heart was so very heavy; but then, like a sick person
who rebels when the physician prescribes bitter medi-
cine, she did not know what was best for her; the
matter rested in higher hands. And well it was for her,
and well it is for all of us that we do not shape the
circumstances of our lot ourselves. We, as free agents,
have a mighty influence upon them, but the power
that disposes our lives, whether through us or from
without, is from above. The Lamb who was slain was
alone found worthy to hold the book of providence in
His pierced hands.
One evening, after a long, busy, brilliantly beautiful
day, Sarah sat sewing in the porch at the door of her
home until the twilight had come on and she could
scarcely see to work any longer. It was very quiet
there; the children had gone to bed, the boys were
at their lessons, and only the hum of her sisters and
mother?s voices reached the girl?s ears now and then
from the open dining-room window, and mingled
curiously with the sleepy twitter of the sparrows
and house-martins, supposed to be retiring to rest in
the thick ivy which covered the front of the house
and hung over the old-fashioned porch.
? A penny for your thoughts, Sarah,?? said her father,
pausing as he passed just then, on his way to the
back of the house.
Sarah started. ? Oh, they were far away,? she


said, ?and of no particular interest except to then-
especial owner.?
I would not get into a dreamy way, my child,
if I were you, said her parent gravely; ?it is bad
for the mind. Run in and light the lamp, then you
can read or do your crochet-work.?
Crochet-work,? laughed Sarah. ?But it is very
little time I have for myself, father dear,? she said;
" and I could not afford to waste it over the merely
ornamental; my labour is all very practical.?
?All very well,? he said; ?but you must have some
amusement. I don?t like those pale cheeks of yours;
so run in and play at something.?
He went on, and Sarah smiled at the idea of any
one so busy and ? so old,? as it seemed to herself she
was, ever playing at anything; and then she sighed
as she thought how very sad and melancholy her life
was fast becoming.
Rising, in obedience to her father?s commands, she
was gathering her work together and preparing
to go in, when she heard the sound of horse?s hoofs
rapidly approaching the house. She knew the rider,
and instinctively, because she felt somehow the
approach of no ordinary news, and hospitably, as
was her wont, she went to the garden-gate to hold
it open.
? Good evenin g, S arah,? said a tall young man, very


like and yet very unlike George Blakeney, as he dis-
mounted from his horse.
ï¿½ Good evening,? she answered, awed by his grave
tones, and fearful of she knew not what.
?It is warm to-night,? he said, as if seeking to put
off telling the news which he came to give.
?What is it, Will ? ? she asked in an almost voice-
less whisper.
?We?ve had rather bad news up at home.?
? About George ? ?
? About George.?
? What is it ? ?
? It?s about the worst news we could have, Sarah.?
? Is he dead ? ? she asked, with a low, bitter cry.
? The Britannia has gone down, and all on board
are lost.?
Sarah wrung her hands.
?We received the news this morning,? W ill con-
tinued; ?but I had not the heart to come and tell
you before. It seems the ship had left Sydney, after
landing the emigrants, and when a few miles from
the shore, she was met by a whirlwind, which is
supposed to have struck her, causing considerable
damage. Anyway, the usual signals of distress
apprised those on land of her danger, and, before
any help could be obtained, she went down with all
her crew.?


? Sarah, come in and see about supper; your father
wants it,? called the unconscious mother from within
the dining-room.
? Mary, Anna, will you go ? ? Sarah replied, in what
seemed to herself an unnaturally harsh voice.
? There is just a chance that he was not in the ship,
Sarah, said Will Blakeney, who had read his brother?s
letter, at least most of it, to Sarah. She could not
keep news of him from his own people, so most of
her letter had been seen by those at home.
?Yes; he might have fled into the bush, if he had
carried out his scheme.?
? Or he might be in prison for mutiny.?
?Uncertain still? said Sarah to herself, pressing
her hands together. ? May God grant me patience.?
? 1 knew you two were great friends,? said Will;
? but had I not better tell some of the others ? ?
? Will you come in ? ?
?No, thank you. Will you kindly ask Mary to
come to me.?
Sarah went in with a blanched face.
?Come and tell me if this ham is fried enouo-h ?
& >
called Anna from the kitchen.
? Where is Mary ? ?
? Why, Sarah, what in the world is the matter ? ?
cried her sister, looking up
I am not very well; lam going to my own room.


Send Mary to Will; he is at the gate? Sarah faltered,
and, turning, went upstairs with heavy, uncertain
tread.
Throwing herself on her knees by the open window,
she waited, tearless and wretched, for that consola-
tion which yet she could not pray tor.
The stars came out one by one and twinkled down
upon her, and the hum of voices and clatter of plates
and knives and forks from the dining-room reached
her from outside ; while from below she could hear
that Will and Mary were talking in the porch. She
knew well what Will meant by sending for Mary
to console him; she had seen it coming for some
weeks, and she chided herselt now, because it seemed
to give her extra pain that these two should be
drawing closer to each other on the occasion v hich
was so full of unmixed trouble to herself. It was
with a sense of relief that, by-and-by, she heaid M ill
ride away and Mary enter the house.
Soon after that she was conscious that anxious
voices were imploring her to unlock her dooi, and
very kind and sympathizing were her friends that
evening, for one and all suspected what a blow this
news was to their useful, bonny Sai ah.
A day or two passed drearily, and then, ? she v as so
vouno - ,? she could not doubt of hope when life and
J O?
life that was so busy, therefore healthy, and so sunny.


therefore beautiful?lay all before her. Besides,
George had expected her, whatever happened, to act
as became her name?that of a King?s daughter.
So she dusted rooms and prepared meals, baked,
taught the little ones, and mended their clothes, took
kindly thought for the poorest of her father?s day-
labourers? families, and was a good neighbour to her
neighbours. And when she felt the most troubled
and distressed by the uncertainty of George?s fate, she
tried to take courage in the thought that he and she
would meet together some day, if not on earth, yet in
a better world, for the sake of ? the crown of faith,?
in the wearing of which for them both so much pain
and so many bitter tears had been mingled and were
mingling still.


CHAPTER V.
IN THE BUSH
An honest tale speeds hest, being
plainly told.?
Shakspere
ANY months after the news of
the loss of the Britannia
had reached George Blake-
ney?s friends in England,
a solitary horseman rode
rapidly through a plea-
sant district in New South
Wales. E T p gentle elevations,
through small winding valleys,
mostly covered by large evergreen trees and a variety
of flowering shrubs bearing blossoms of great beauty
and exquisite fragrance, by rocks and rivulets he
passed, with only a careless glance around, for his eye


had grown accustomed to the country, and his honest
soul was intent upon his business. Many beautiful
birds stood or flitted about here and there, amono-
-7 O
which were the black swan of Australia, with its wings
edged with white and its bill tinged with red, and the
emu, or cassowary, often as much as seven feet or more
in height. Sometimes a serpent gleamed against the
green leaves, or glided through the brilliant blossoms
in some particularly picturesque thicket, with its
bowers of varied creepers, its olive-green trees, and its
tufted herbage. There were opossums, too, chiefly of
the kangaroo kind, and dingoes, or wild dogs, which
are so fierce that they can never be domesticated, and
so savage that they have been known to devour each
other when hungry and unable to procure other food.
On and on the equestrian pressed, with now and
then an expression of delight upon his brown, weather-
beaten face, as his English ears caught the sound of
the sweet singing of a thrush or blackbird, whose pro-
genitors had been imported some twenty years or so
before, and who now, with their bird-relatives, were
thriving in the Australian forest, and singing of home
to many a home-sick wanderer.
George Blakeney?for he it was?had altered much
since last we saw him in the old country. The months
which had been so long and tedious for Sarah, with
their continuous ?hope deferred? and ever-recurring


lessons of patience and submission, had been full of
stirring events for him. Perils by sea and land had
impressed their mark upon our hero. He looked
harder, stronger, and, if it must be added, wilder and
less civilized than before. But perhaps that was partly
owing to his shaggy, undressed beard and whiskers
and long hair, covered by a broad-brimmed hat; while
his clothes added no grace to his figure, being of the
coarsest and strongest description, with small regard
to shape or fashion.
Of George?s purpose and plan when aboard the
Britannia, amongst its fever-stricken passengers, we
have read in his letter to Sarah; but he did not
there how hard he was striving to do all he could for
the hapless sufferers; how he nursed the dying chil-
dren on his knee as gently as any mother ; how he sat
by the older patients, listening to their groans and
regrets, their confessions of past sins, and promises of
amendment should it please the Almighty to spare
them; and how he whispered to one and all that they
were to trust Jesus, ?just to trust Him now.? And
he did not say to Sarah how he pinched himself of
food that he might have some to give to those who
needed it still more, and how he himself pleaded with
the captain, as earnestly as it was possible to plead,
for help for the suffering emigrants. Then he had not
said a word to harass her gentle mind of the other


hardships which had to be endured, though almost
unendurable. How, for instance, the drinking-water
had gradually become black and loathsome towards
the end of the long voyage, and still it had to be
drunk; how rats overran the vessel, and spoiled both
food and water; and how the captain?s temper was
almost unbearable.
Pausing a few moments for his horse to recover its
breath after a stiff gallop, and looking around from
under the shade of a beautiful fern-tree, which, after
attaining to the height of fifteen or twenty feet, threw
out its huge leaves on every side, each to the extent
of four or five feet, George remembered the narrow,
crowded space, so full of sin and suffering, on board
ship; and, as he touched his horse with his stout
whip and hurried forward, he could not regret that
his strong arm and resolute will had done all in his
power to free and rescue the oppressed.
For the wicked captain had been successfully im-
prisoned in his cabin, and every one on board ship had
submitted to the wiser and more merciful rule of the
bold first mate. The fever, under judicious treatment,
had abated, many lives had been saved, and at
Sydney George Blakeney had fled into the bush.
And, because it is always possible to good men to
make mistakes, and because in life, as in the dear Old
Testament stories of the patriarchs of old, no one is


faultless, we may perhaps hint that, according to our
judgment, it would have been better for George if he
had submitted to be imprisoned a while at Sydney
until the special circumstances of his case became
known. But George Blakeney was impulsive. The
same boy who had run away to sea, and there done
his work so well that he had been rapidly promoted,
had now acted bravely and kindly, but had fled from
the consequences of so doing. And just as in the Old
Testament stories we find those Scriptural characters
which have been written for our ensample met with
trouble and punishment in this life, corresponding to
the errors into which they had fallen, so in this life,
too, we find there is a certain Nemesis which merci-
fully visits those who err; I say mercifully, for better
is any amount of suffering here than the gradual
deterioration of character which ends in worse hereafter.
After all sorts of adventures, George Blakeney, being
a useful fellow, able and willing to put his hand to
many kinds of work, found himself surrounded by
new friends, and with plenty of well-paid occupation.
Just now, he was acting as assistant to a sheep-
farmer on a large station, and was going to see after
some sheep under the care of a shepherd some miles
away, which their owner was thinking of selling.
The ride was a long one, and he was anxious to reach
the end of his journey before night.






It was very hot, more so than George had ever
known it in Australia, and presently his horse snorted
and whinnied as if in fear, while to his ears came the
sound of a great roaring, hissing, and crackling. As
he paused and looked back wonderingly, he perceived
a cloud of dense black smoke creeping towards him
from the north. And now the unmistakable smell of
fire, together with more than one rapid forked tongue
of flame darting through the smoke, acquainted him
with the fact that a fierce bush fire was raging, and
that he must hasten to effect his escape as soon as
possible; for on every side were trees ?he was in the
midst of dry, inflammable combustibles.
Did he think of Sarah as he dashed away from the
consuming fire ? Was she praying for him then ?
Ah, we never know in what dire plight may be the
dear ones for whom we are offering up petitions at
the throne of grace. He only who intercedes for us
can know and perceive the right view of the case
which we are spreading, like King Hezekiah?s letter,
before the Lord.
Amidst flying birds, yelping dingoes, fear-stricken
kangaroos, George fled, regardless of his previous desti-
nation, and only anxious to escape from the fire
raging to the north and east. By-and-by he came up
to some men with a large bullock-team drawing a
heavy load of timber.


? Have we time, master, to save this timber ? ? said
one of them anxiously.
? No, no,? George replied. ? I have fled for my life.
The flames are rapidly approaching us on two sides. ?
? Ah, we had better release our team, then,? said the
man sadly. ? Look sharp, boys; unyoke the bullocks,
and drive them to the lelt of us.
George sprang from his horse, and helped to loose
the animals; then he assisted to drive them on for
about a mile, which was no easy task, owing to then-
being stupid with fear. The smoke was suffocating,
and the heat so great that once or twice it seemed as
if the men could not bear it, and would have to leave
the poor beasts. At last, however, they were success-
fully driven into a gully, and George, having no mind
to be imprisoned there for no one knew how long,
dashed on once more alone.
But whether it was that he was confused by his
attention having been drawn to the terrified team, or
that the fire had changed its course, he soon found, to
his consternation, that the fire was before him as well
as behind. His danger was extreme. He could not
return; he was obliged to dash forward through the
burning timber.
Urging on his horse, he made it tear through a
fiery, smoking, furnace-like hollow, and up a high hill
bevond. Up above the flames, half choked with


smoke, lie urged his horse, until, scarcely able to see,
he felt himself dashing along the side of the hill and
round an angle of it to where the air was free from
smoke, and clear and cool.
With delight he felt rather than saw the change ;
and then he became conscious that his horse was
sapping, and, scarcely knowing how he did it, he
threw himself from its back. Down, down fell the
poor creature, until it lay, with broken neck and
broken back, some four hundred feet below. George
himself was clinging to a rock, and now, in trying
to get a footing, he fell upon a ledge some six feet or
so below, and, being much shaken, to say nothing of
his skin being painfully scorched, he lay still for
almost half an hour. Then he tried to creep down
the crags over which his poor horse had fallen. It
was too steep, however, for him to proceed far, and
presently he found it was possible to climb sideways
towards what he hoped might be a more gradual
descent.
Alas for his hopes! The next thing of which he
was conscious was that he had stumbled down a
precipice of thirty feet or so, and was helpless? his
left leg being broken.
The pain being very great, he was obliged for some
time to he still; and bitter, most bitter must have
been his thoughts, as he lay thus grievously maimed


at the foot of a precipice in the lonely bush. Ah I
George had need of all his fortitude and trust in God;
for dark did indeed seem his prospects as he lay
there, where it was far from probable that any one
would find him.
And now the sky above became overclouded, and
heavy, unceasing rain fell on the hapless sufferer.
?It is impossible to stay here hidden in this hole,
he groaned, creeping painfully up and down the rocks,
dragging and pushing his injured limb on with the
aid of his hands and some sticks.
Night ensued, cold and wet, and another day
dawned with new miseries ; for he had the mis-
fortune, in his desperate progress, to roll half across
a nest of large soldier-ants, and, as he could not free
himself from them, they swarmed about him, stinging^
him severely.
The day passed on, and still fell the unceasing ram;
another cold wet night, and still neither help nor
death visited our hapless hero. He was glad to
quench his thirst by sucking a little grass he found,
and, by-and-by, even to eat some of it to appease
his hunger. The next day, almost more dead than
alive, he perceived with horror that numbers of birds
were already hovering over him, eager to feast upon
his remains. With a last, almost dying effort, he
made his painful way to the foot of an overhanging


rock, where he was trying to make himself a grave in
the sand, as some protection for his body from the
birds, when, oh, joyful sound, he was hailed by an
unmistakable British ? Hullo ! ?
Looking up, he perceived a shepherd peering down
upon him from the brow of a great rock, with the
utmost wonder and horror depicted in his rugged
countenance.

CHAPTER VI.
WEDDING BELLS.
? Begins the clash and clang that tells
The joy to every wandering breeze;
The blind wall rocks, and on the trees
The dead leaf trembles to the bells.?
Texnysos.
NE bright October day.
about two years and a
half after George Blake-
ney had sailed in the
Britannia, little knowing it
O
was the last voyage that ill-fated
vessel was destined to make, and
that his own career as a seaman,
promoted to the rank of first mate,
was also near its termination, there
gay doings at Mr. Morrison?s
farm.
Nothing less than a wedding, and, what is more, a


double wedding, had taken place at the old church in
the village of Skipton, half a mile away. The brides
were Sarah?s two sisters, Mary and Anna. The former
had been married to Will Blakeney, the latter to
another young farmer in the neighbourhood, named
Herbert Spencer. It had been a very pretty wedding.
Both the fair young brides looked beautiful in their
white dresses and neat white bonnets, the bridegrooms
were both handsome, and the little bridesmaids, sisters
of the brides, were altogether charming. Sarah had
not been able to be present at the ceremony, for the
delicate mother required constant care, and she would
entrust to no one else the honour and pleasure of
waiting upon her. But Mr. Morrison gave his
daughters away in his stately, almost stern manner;
and the old church was crowded with loving, sym-
pathizing friends. And Sarah presided at the wed-
ding breakfast, in a pearl-grey dress of some soft,
gracefully flowing material, and though her face was
pale, it was very sweet and serene-looking. Yet her
position was a little trying, for more than one warm-
hearted neighbour kept chaffing her, in a kindly way,
about having let her younger sisters lead the way in
matters matrimonial, and expressing all sorts of hopes
and wishes about her own destiny.
They did not know ?how should they ??that the
older sister?s heart belonged to one who seemed to have


disappeared altogether from this world. For Sarah had
never heard from George since the report of the loss
of the Britannia, and she was still ignorant whether
he was dead or alive. She had reason to think he had
left the ship before it was wrecked, for word had been
sent from the shipping office in L that a written
statement had reached there, which had been posted
at Sydney, and signed by the adult emigrants and the
whole of the crew, with the exception of the captain,
stating how it was George Blakeney, first mate, had
felt obliged to take upon himself the command of the
vessel, and how his doing so had saved many lives,
A gold watch and a purse from the same source had
also been presented, or rather were waiting to be
presented to him when he showed himself once more.
So the authorities had sent word to his relations that
a free pardon, the little items above mentioned, and
no blame and punishment at all were in store for him.
Yet still no word from George, and gradually his
friends were growing accustomed to the idea that he
was dead. All but Sarah, that is, for she could not
think but that he still lived, only she strove bravely
and resolutely to fill her life with other work, aims,
and thoughts, she strove to please her Heavenly
Father; and in pleasing Him she knew she would
be acting as would most please the single-hearted
man, to whom, though no bond of words had


been made between them, she felt that she was
pledged.
Therefore, though she was not without admirers
who would fain be something more, Sarah declared her
determination of remaining always with her mother
while she lived. And she tried to believe that just
because she had had this heavy trial laid upon her
young shoulders, it was a token of the Father s love,
for ? wdiom He loveth He chasteneth,? and a sign that
she was ?set apart for Jesus.? Any way, m Miss
Havergal?s words ?
? Jesus came
And laid His own liand on the quivering heart,
And made it very still, that He might write
Invisible words of power?? Free to serve !
Then through the darkness and the chill He sent
A heart-ray of His love, developing
The mystic writing, till it glowed and shone.
And lit up all her life with radiance new?
The happy service of a yielded heart.?
And then again?
? With comfort that He never ceased to give,
Because her need could never cease, she filled
The empty chalices of other lives,
And time and thought were thenceforth spent for Him
Who loved her with His everlasting love.?
So she lived, full of peace, higher, sweeter, and more
serene than any that this world can give.
But yet, because she was human, or, perhaps, as
a sweet singer has said, because her angel let her lace


ï¿½ might rise the higher, she could only
with difficulty maintain her sweet serenity on that
gay day of her sisters? double wedding. And after
they had gone, and had taken leave of her and of
their parents, with mingled smiles and tears, she had
stolen away from the guests and from her mother?s
side and had sought her own room, that she mio-ht
in solitude wrestle with unworthy thoughts which
would suggest a contrast between their happier lot
and her own sad fate.
Looking at it from one point of view, and that the
lowest, it seemed so hard, so very hard, that her life
should be darkened just at its commencement by such
an unusual trial as this total disappearance of her
lover. The uncertainty, the suspense, and now her
entire ignorance as to his fate, were very hard to bear.
If he had died, if she might have thought of him
as an angel in heaven awaiting her on the other side
of the river of death, she thought it would have been
so very much less of a trouble. And perhaps her
thoughts were all the more bitter just now, because
they had been long suppressed. But she was not going
to give way to them; ah no, that well-disciplined
nature was not likely to forget so soon ? the happy
service of a yielded heart.?
For, as she stood by her bedroom window, with icy
hands tight-clasped, and a set pale face gazing with


weary eyes at the gold and bronze-leaved trees, a
great clashing and clanging of bells came tumultu-
ously through the quiet evening air. The ringers had
recommenced their well-paid task, and, sinking on
her knees by the open window, which was overlooked
by no one, and which overlooked the home-field, Sarah
prayed for forgiveness, for patience, and for blessings
on those dear young sisters who had gone out into
the world to a new and untried life.
And praying for them was she not blessed herself?
It has been said that the benefit of intercessory prayer
is twofold, for it brings a blessing down on the one
who prays as well as on those for whom the prayer
is offered. Sarah grew calm and peaceful as she
knelt there; and, presently, soothed and comforted
by the consciousness that she was not alone, and
lulled by the sweet music of the bells, the weary
girl fell asleep, with her head upon her outspread
arms lying on the broad old-fashioned window-seat.
And she not only slept, but dreamt; and what she
dreamt was this.
She thought she was the little boy of whom she
had once told the children in that same home-field
upon which she had been gazing, and that she stood,
like him, at the shining door of heaven, pleading that
she might be admitted. And she thought as she
looked up at the old man who kept the door he


changed, grew younger-looking, and altered until she
knew it was George Blakeney who stood by her side,
and that he likewise wished to be admitted. And
she felt a strange content to be with him, because, too,
they were both aiming for the same place.
? They will not let us in,? he said, at last to her,
?because we have not got the crown of simple,
obedient faith.?
? But I can?t do what they want,? she sobbed in
her dream. ? I have to weave my wreath of flowers,
my crown, in doubt, darkness, and terrible distress.
But George Blakeney smiled upon her, as if he
would smile at the bare idea of her not doing what
Heaven bid her, however difficult it was. And then
she awoke.
Bobbie was clutching her shoulder with his little
fat hand. ? Mother wants you,? he said. ? Sarah,
wake up ; mother wants you.?
To the girl the call seemed to come as a voice from
heaven; her work was clearly to nurse that dear,
failing parent, even though it was in darkness and
doubt.
So Sarah went and tended her mother like the
King?s daughter that she was.
O o


CHAPTER YII
A LAST TALK.
? Hidden in the hollow
Of His blessbd hand,
Never foe can follow.
Never traitor stand
Not a surge of worry.
Not a shade of care,
Not a blast of hurry
Touch the spirit there.
Stayed upon Jehovah,
Hearts are fully blest.
Finding, as He promised,
Perfect peace and rest.?
F. E. H.
NCE again, but in a different way, the
surface of Sarah Morrison?s tranquillity
was ruffled, and almost more than that, by
a very different trial.
This time it was no uncertain, hard-to-
be-understood matter, but the plain, direct stroke of
death which almost shook the girl?s tender soul from
its moorings for a little time. Is or for long. The


Good Shepherd never leaves His sorely tried sheep
in the hour of danger. Grace there is for every time
of need.
? And if Marah must be Marah
He will stand beside the brink.?
And then in ? the Marah? of this trouble Sarah could
trace the ? mystic tree ?
? Whereby the bitter-tasting streams were healed.?
The sting of death had been removed. The shadow
of the Cross lay athwart the troubled waters, and
they were still.
Mrs. Morrison?s health failed more and more durino-
the long winter which followed Mary and Anna?s
wedding. And when the sweet, pleasant days of
spring came they only found her a shadow of her
former self. She lay all day in her large comfortably
furnished bedroom, and there Sarah sat witli her as
much as possible, leaving the room when obliged to
see about the household arrangements with dread, and
returning timidly and with fear, lest the frail tene-
ment of clay should have parted with that loving-
gentle spirit that seemed to be only lingering a little
before it took its final flight to the realms of lio-ht
and gladness.
One bright May morning, when the scents of wall-
flowers came through Mrs. Morrison?s open window


from the garden below, and the sunshine fell on
Sarah?s head as she sat reading to her mother, till
the invalid could almost fancy it was crowning her
with gold, the girl broke down, and could not go on
with the psalm she was reading.
? God is our refuge and strength, a very present
help in trouble.? So far she had read and then she
began to cry. The dear, familiar words brought no
comfort to her just then.
? Sarah, my child,? said the mother gently. And
then she could say no more, for she, too, felt over-
whelmed for a moment at the thought of the ap-
proaching separation.
Her daughter came and knelt beside the bed, while
great sobs shook her young frame.
O ï¿½/ C 7
? I know, my darling,? said her mother tenderly,
? that life seems very hard to you just now, and death
a bitter, bitter enemy. I felt just like you do now
once; it was when I was young, too, Sarah. I seemed
to have more troubles than any one else; anxieties,
doubts, struggles, strifes, perplexities, were on every
side. I scarcely knew which way to turn. And yet
I knew, as you too know, Sarah, that I ought to cast
my care on Him who cared for me even unto death.
Sometimes I did for a time, and then the trouble
seemed wonderfully lessened, the rough way made
plain, the darkness light about me. But then again


I would slip back into the old habitual way of looking
at the trouble, as if I were alone and had no mighty,
ever-present Helper. The glimpses I had had of His
presence were very sweet, but they were only glimpses
after all, and the troubles and difficulties were very
real and ever-present.?
?It is just so with me,? murmured Sarah, without
looking up. ? Sometimes I have such sweet gleams of
spiiitual help I can call it nothing else?such a sweet
sense ot an earthly joy and satisfaction which seems
to make everything easier. But it always goes away,
that feeling, and again I feel forsaken and alone.?
? l as L said the mother musingly, as if half to
herself, ?it remained with me?that confidence that
I was hidden in the Divine refuge. Hidden in God.
? Lord, Thou are our dwelling-place.? ? God is our
lefuge and strength.? Months and months have
passed since I have felt anything but peace?perfect,
untroubled peace. And I know it is just because I
am leaning on Him. Sarah, you cannot trust Him
enough. You cannot rest in Him too completely.
Like Peter, when he attempted to walk upon the
water, you can get on all right so long as you keep
your eyes fixed upon Him, who has hidden you come ?
but if you remove them, and look around to consider
the storm-tossed waves, the dangers and the difficulties
which surround you, then you will sink. It will not


be He who lets you fall, but you who will not walk
in His appointed way.?
? I know, I know, dear mother, it is all true, but
I cannot feel as I ought. When I think of losing
you Oh, mother, what shall I do ? ?
? But you would not keep me here, Sarah, in pain,
weariness, and weakness? Instead, you will be con-
tent, I know, for me to go home a little time before
? Mother, you don?t want to go ?to leave us ?
questioned Sarah, a little bitterly. It is so painful
to feel the fluttering of our dear one?s wings. The
desire to depart is recognized with such grief by those
who have to remain behind.
? I do not wish to leave my dear ones, my children
and my husband; but Jesus is there, and my Father
is there, and when they call I must go. But,
Sarah,? and the sick woman raised her head and
turned a beseeching look upon her eldest daughter,
?you will be to them all that I might have been.
Promise me you will try and fill my place.?
? I will, I will, mother.?
The invalid lay quite still for a few minutes, then
she said, ? I think, dear, that George Blakeney is not
dead. I have often felt lately that he will return.
I should like you and he to marry; that is if his long
silence can be satisfactorily explained.?


That was the last conversation of any length Sarah
had with her beloved parent. The disease which was
hastening Mrs. Morrison?s death now advanced with
rapid strides, soon she was too weak to talk, and soon
after that she was at rest.


CHAPTER YIIL
AT LAST.
? The beauty of the perfect day
Excels the promise of its spring ;
And still each hour along the way
Fresh angels meet me on tire wing.
? The water changes into wine.
At noonday in the cup I hold:
And sorrow, witli her touch divine,
Has turned my silver into gold.?
we go and get some goose
berries, Sarah ? ? asked Lottie, as
Mr. Morrison?s youngest daughter
Charlotte was still called, though
she was a robust, rosy-cheeked
girl of twelve years of age, about
ten years after our story opened
and three years after her mother?s death.
?Yes, do let us, Sarah,? said Lottie?s
eidei sistei, Geitiude. I know you want some for


bottling, and the boys are nicely out of the way, so
we shall not be disturbed.?
Sarah smiled. ? Very well; I shall be pleased if
you will get me a great basketful. But you need
not throw a stone at the boys when they are not here
to defend themselves.?
? Ah, but you don?t know how they tease.?
They never tease me.?
No; but, then, they wouldn?t be expected to tease
a saint or a Madonna like you, Sarah,? said Gertrude,
throwing her arms round her sister?s neck and looking
earnestly into her sweet, serene face.
?Go away, childie, and don?t flatter one so
tremendously,? said Sarah, kissing the girl and push-
ing her gently away.
? Oh, I don?t flatter?l never flatter,? said Gertrude
gravely; ?but I only wish you could just once see
yourself as we see you.?
? I think it?s better not,? said Lottie thoughtfully ;
?it might just a little spoil our Sarah if she knew
how beautiful she was.?
Sarah laughed. ? It?s your own dear loving hearts,?
she said, ? which make you think of me like this.
Now, I, for my part, think no one had ever such
darling sisters as my happy self.?
?You are very happy, Sarah?? questioned Ger-
trude wistfully.


Yes, surely, surely. Why do you ask ? ?
? Oh, because I dream sometimes that you are dead.
Sarah, I love you so, I can?t help it. I know it would
break my heart if you did die.?
Why, child, I am in quite?quite rude health.?
And you don?t want to die ? ?
? Oh, dear no. I want to live as long as it is my
Father?s will.?
? That?s right. Now we?ll get you some goose-
berries.? And away the two girls went, leaving Sarah
alone in the dining-room.
O
She was sitting in her mother?s favourite arm-chair
near the window, with a large basket of work beside
her, and as her busy fingers plied their task, and her
needle flew in and out of the linen she was stitchinc
with a little click, she looked the picture of a contented,
nay, more than contented, joyous-hearted Christian
woman. She was one of those of whom the wise man
" rote when he said ? her price is far above rubies.?
She looked well to the ways of her household.
She worked willingly with hands.
She stretched out her hands to the poor and needy?
such helpful hands they were and strong.
She saw that her household was well clothed, and
she herself dressed well, and even beautifully. (By
that I mean, not expensively, but prettily, and with
her good taste.)


Strength and honour were her clothing, and the
promise that ? she shall rejoice in time to come? was
even now proving itself true.
Finally, she opened her mouth with wisdom, and in
her lips was the law of kindness.
And as King Solomon ended with saying a woman
who fears God shall be praised, so we hesitate not to
praise our Sarah, and with her all heroines of home,
all noble-hearted, single-minded women.
Time had laid its hand very gently, almost caress-
ingly upon Sarah Morrison. It is true she had had
great troubles, but her well-regulated mind and truly
Christian heart had enabled her to find much quiet
joy and satisfaction in her daily life. Thinking little
of herself and much for others, she had escaped the
brunt of her own burden. In her busy, active, loving-
life there had been little space for repining and brood-
ing over the past, even if she had been inclined for it;
but she was not so inclined; she would have thought
such conduct rebellious and altogether wrong.
She was a beautiful woman, far more beautiful than
she had been as a girl. She wore her soft brown hair
a little bowed over her beautifully formed but rather
high forehead. Her large dark eyes were lit up with
intelligence, and they were always softened by in-
tense sympathy with those at whom they were look-
ing. Her regular features had little curves expressive


of tenderness and sweet, loving thought for others,
and her rare smile was altogether fascinating.
o o
Such was Sarah. Yet she was still Miss Morrison,
for though she had not lacked admiration, and more
than admiration, no one had ever appeared who could
occupy for her the place George Blakeney had won in
her estimation.
Nothing more had been heard of George, and every-
one but Sarah had concluded long ago that he was
o o
dead. She hoped still that he was alive, but it must
be confessed it was only a faint, well-nigh worn-out
hope. And she often feared ? the wish was father to
the thought.? For time had wrought no change in
on o
her feeling towards him, only she had put it on one
side, together with the few letters she had had from
him and one or two other things sacred to his
memory, that her life might not be crippled by undue
melancholy and regret.
So she sat sewing in the window, sometimes paus-
ing to glance at the beautiful roses in the garden or
up at the blue sky above, and then working busily
on, with her mind refreshed by some pleasant thought
that her beautiful surroundings had suggested.
o oo
The parlour was cool and well-shaded, but outside,
in the sunshine, it was very hot, almost oppressively
so. It was fair-day in the neighbouring town of
Bodlington, and all the servants, men and maidens,


and Sarah?s brothers, had gone there. Hence, she was
alone in the house, now that her two young sisters
were gathering fruit in the large garden.
? How good God is; how glad and peaceful is my
life,? she thought, as she sat there. ? Mother was
right; there is nothing like c leaning on Him,? Hosting
all to Jesus, leaving every care with Him. And I can
trust Him with my dear one, too; whether in life or
death, George is safe in His hand.?
She was very calm and full of a glad and sweet
content, and the parlour was cool and pleasant.
Truly it seemed a haven of rest to an elderly man,
who came in by-and-by, looking very hot, weary, and
careworn.
Sarah rose at one. ? Dear father, let me take your
hat,? she said sympathizingly, ? and you shall have
a cup of tea. You are tired, lam sure.?
?Yes; tired out, Sarah, in more senses than one,?
he said, sinking into a chair. ?I have not sold my
cattle well, the prices are ruinously low. Things
always are cheap now when I want to sell.?
? Why should you sell your cattle now, father ? It
is early in the season yet; two or three more months
of grass and cake will be worth ever so much to
them.?
? I know that, Sarah, well enough; but I was
obliged.?


? Why ? ?
? If you must know, I could not pay my rent unless
I sold them. And I could not afford to buy more
cake for them either.?
Sarah looked startled, almost shocked. ? I did not
think you were in any difficulties,? she said.
?No ; why should I bother you with them ? ? said
her father, who was always very reserved. ? You were
as careful as you could be in the house. But I have
had such bad harvests lately, and I have never re-
covered losing all my cattle two or three years ago
when the cattle-plague was raging about here. And
now things have got worse and worse, till I scarcely
know which way to turn. I get very hopeless some-
times.?
? Oh, don?t lose hope, dear father. Think of our
mother; she always said we were to trust in God,
and all would be right. But, father dear,? and
Sarah went to her father and laid her hand caress-
ingly on his shoulder ?? how can you talk like that
when there is my money still untouched ? ?
?Your money. Do you think I would touch the
thousand pounds your mother left for your marriage
portion ? ?
? But you see, dear father, I don?t require a
marriage-portion,? said Sarah cheerfully; ? I am a
sober, steady old maid, with a heart rich in home-love.


And if you like you can repay me when better times
come. Xot that I want repaying; for have I not a
home always with you ? ?
Mi. Morrison was some time before he would he
com inced, hut at last he consented to borrow a little
from his daughter?s dowry. Then, as he would take
no tea, and really was feeling far from well, Sarah
persuaded him to go upstairs and lie down a little.
After that she resumed her work in the dinino--
O
room window. She was glad of what she had just
done; glad, as any right-minded daughter would be,
that she was able to assist in any way one to whom
she owed so much for years of loving care and devo-
tion. And she knew even if George Blakeney came
back again he would approve of what she had done.
So she sat there sewing contentedly, and only
troubled that her lather seemed indisposed, and that
he appeared to be aging rapidly.
Meanwhile, a cab was being driven rapidly along
the glaring limestone road from Bodlington. The
dost rose in great white clouds as it passed along,
and the driver looked very red and hot when he
paused, at the entrance to Shipton, to ask for further
instruction from the well-dressed, brown-bearded man,
who sat inside, leaning forward, as if to anxiously
scan the face of a once-familiar country.
Drive on quickly through the village, take the


first turn to the right, and do not stop till jmu reach
a large ivy-covered farmhouse,? said the gentleman,
in tones he in vain endeavoured to render calm.
By-and-by the cab swept up the lane to the gate
of Mr. Morrison?s garden. And at the sound two
startled heads looked up from the kitchen garden to
the left.
?Can it be Mary or Anna ?? queried the gooseberry-
gatherers.
But now a gentleman was getting out, who paid
the cabman and dismissed him, and who then went
across and entered the kitchen garden. He had
evidently seen the two young girls, and was coming
towards them, with a little limp, for he was rather
lame.
? How like Sarah,? he said aloud to himself, as he
advanced, and Gertrude, who felt sure he meant her-
self, flushed vividly with pleasure. It was the height
of her ambition to be thought like Sarah. ?But it
is not she,? went on the stranger, still aloud. For,
though Gertrude was tall and stately, considering her
age, at fourteen, she was unmistakably juvenile as
yet.
?My dear young ladies,? said the stranger, lifting
his hat, ? may I ask you if your name is Morrison ?
Pooh ! I know it is ; but tell me who is at home ? ?
The girls stared. Then Gertrude answered in her


clear young voice, ?It is fair-day at Bodlington, so
no one is at home but Sarah; that is, I mean, our
eldest sister.? She had not seen her father return.
? Tell me your sister?s name again ? ? asked the
newcomer quickly.
? Sarah?Miss Morrison.?
? Then she is not married. She is not Mrs. William
Blakeney ? ? he cried eagerly.
?Oh no; that is Mary.?
? I hoped so; I began to hope so. How foolish
I have been. And Sarah?Miss Morrison, never
married ? ?
?I should think not,? said Tottie sturdily. ?I
wonder where in the world you would find any one
good enough for our Sarah ! ?
O O
Tottie,? said Gertrude reprovingly.
Well, Gertrude, you know what father says.?
? What does father say ? ? asked the stranger.
? He says we cannot be too thankful to have Sarah
left with us, and that no one could be found any-
where worthy of her, and ?
? Tottie,? said Gertrude still more reprovingly.
? Please allow your sister to continue,? said the
stranger.
O
? It seems such a shame to talk of our Sarah to any
one like that; she?s not to be talked about to strangers.
She?s more like an angel than anything else,? cried


Gertrude, half vexed with herself for saying so much
and yet unable to resist the impulse.
? Exactly as I knew she would be. Well, my dears,
I am an old. friend of hers, so you need not mind
telling me. And now, will you take me to her,
rather will you tell me where I may find her ? ?
? She?s at work in the dining-room window; it?s the
room ?
But the stranger had gone without waiting for
Gertrude to finish her instructions. The two srirls
watched him walk up to the right window and stand
looking in, at which felt very properly indignant.
Sarah was sitting with her face turned the other
way, so she could not see him, and after a moment or
two, he turned away and entered the house.
? Without knocking ! ? exclaimed Gertrude.
? Without knocking ! ? echoed Tottie.
The sisters looked at each other blankly. ?She?s
all alone, and we don?t know who he is. Let us so to
her,? they said.
So they went towards the house.
? Sarah ! ? said George, entering the dining-room
' o o
? George ! ? replied Sarah simply, with scarcely a
start. ? I knew you would come back.?
It was a very simple meeting; but oh ! the joy of
it. When Tottie and Gertrude entered, in some
excitement, they saw, to their dismay, that the


stranger and their sister were sitting hand in hand,
and apparently on the most intimate terms.
Unseen themselves, they drew back into the hall
and looked at each other in consternation.
? Our Sarah ! ? said Tottie.
?Oh ! ? said Gertrude, ? isn?t it horrid ? What
shall we do ? ?
Sarah heard their voices, and came to them. ? Come
in, dears, and be introduced to my great friend, George
Blakeney,? she said, in a voice which was far from
steady now.
Then the girls, knowing that the long-missing hero
of their sister?s one love-story had returned, went
shyly towards him and allowed themselves to be
introduced.
?This one is more like you, Sarah,? said George,
looking earnestly at Gertrude, who coloured with
delight; ? she is very much like what you used to be.?
?Why did you not write to me?? asked Sarah,
when they were again alone.
?At first,? he replied, ?I was anxious to be lost to
every one for a while, because I am afraid I was
cowardly enough to dread being imprisoned. But I
knew my last letter to you would tell you how I was
concealed in the bush, and I thought when you heard
I had left the ship, you would know the rest.?
?But it was so uncertain whether you had left the


Britannia ; for you are doubtless aware that the ship
went down with all on board soon after it left
Sydney.?
?You don?t say so!? George was very much
shocked. Thoughts of the guilty captain?s life being
thus cut off in the midst of his selfish, ungodly career,
and memories of his old friends among the crew came
surging through his bewildered mind. In a few
minutes, however, he realized what the uncertainty
must have been for Sarah. ?And you did not know
whether I was alive or dead all these years ? ? he said.
? And is it?can it be that you have kept faithful to
me in all this terrible uncertainty ??
? How could I act otherwise ? ? said Sarah simply.
? Why, you must have had?there must have been
so many who would like to have married you,
who ?
Sarah interrupted him. ? Was it likely that I
could have thought of any one else when I had given
you all I had to give ? ? she asked.
? Oh, Sarah, I might have known what you were,?
he said, in a tone of mingled regret and admiration.
? Why,? she said wonderingly, ? did you not expect
me to act as became my name?that of a Kino-?s
O
daughter ? ?
? It was when I was at the gold diggings,? he said
apologetically. ? I had gone through ail sorts of hard-


ships, had had my leg broken in New South Wales ?
it has left me a little lame, because of the delay in
having it set properly?and narrowly escaped with
my life; and then I went to the diggings, be i
smitten, I suppose, with the gold fever, and there I
got to know a fellow from England who came from
somewhere near here, and he told me my brother was
married, and married to you. He said he was sure it
was the eldest sister who had married Will, and that
the next sister had married some one else. So after
that, I am afraid I got rather reckless, and did not
care to write even to my home. I thought ?forgive
me, Sarah?but I thought if my friends were so easily
consoled for my loss, they could not care much to hear
about me.?
?My poor George, how sorry I am,? said Sarah, her
eyes filling with tears.
?Nay, it was m3 7 fault; I might have known you
better,? said George penitently. ?But in time I was
successful,? he continued. ? I found some valuable
nuggets, and thought I would return to share my
riches with my friends.?
? Generous as ever,? thought Sarah.
? So I came back to England, and first of all went
straight to our old shipping authorities to report
nn?self, and find out what was in store for me. And
did you ever know anything so strange ? There was


a free pardon awaiting me, and a testimonial from the
emigrants and crew, who had written a complete
statement of the case to exempt me from all blame.?
?I knew,? said Sarah. ?I have known it for
years.?
? Oh, if I had only had more faith in God and in
you, my Sarah, how much I might have been spared.?
Sarah suggested that life was still before them, that
the weary waiting-time was at an end at last.
es ; and, Sarah, I can say this, that, if my faith
has been weak, my love for both you and my heavenly
Father could not well have been stronger than it was.?
? And the greatest of these is charity;? said Sarah
very softly.
George Blakeney did not go any more to sea.
Instead, he went into partnership with Sarah?s father,
to v horn his capital?a by no means inconsiderable
one Inch he was glad enough to invest in farming,
buying new stock, etc., was, it is needless to saj?, very
welcome. And, being a little lame, and having been
brought up on a farm, George thought he could not do
better than occupy his time by riding about superin-
tending the farm-labourers and looking after cattle,
horses, sheep, etc.
Sarah was very glad of this arrangement, for it
enabled her, after she was married, still to live on at


her old home until Gertrude was old enough to take
her place; and so she was happy in fulfilling her
mother?s dying injunction to take care ot her dear
children and husband for her.
The years, rolling by, only found Sarah, now Mrs.
Blakeney, ?queening it? more and more, in the
? golden robe ? spun from her daily work in the
home of which she was ever the beloved and highly
esteemed heroine.

FLO WEES OF PAEADISE
CHAPTER I.
THE GATE AJAR.
?0 Paradise! 0 Paradise!
Who doth not crave for rest?
Who would not seek the happy land
here they that loved are blest;
Where loyal hearts and true
Stand ever in the light,
All rapture through and through
In God?s most holy sight.?
no, children, I don?t think I can walk with
you to-day, I am so very tired,? said a pale
young schoolmistress, looking down regret-
fully at a group of rosy-cheeked, bright-eyed village
children.
? Please come, Miss Mortimer. Please come with
us. It is not half nice without you,? cried the
children.


? I should think you are tired of me now that school
is over,? said their teacher, rather wistfully.
? No, no,? cried a chorus of eager voices, and the
little girls crowded round their beloved teacher; while
some boys, too, drew a little nearer, saying encouragingly,
? Come on ! Now do come on.?
It was a bright warm afternoon in the beginning of
April. Not a breath of wind stirred the branches of
the sycamore, oak, and elm trees standing here and
there in different nooks and corners of the pretty
village of Hickleborough. Not a cloud broke the
O o
monotony of the pale blue sky above. Not a shadow
of care or sorrow rested on the faces of the happy
children down below. Only the young governess?s
heart was heavy, and her mind and body were alike
weary and in need of rest.
Mary Mortimer had not had a long life, she was
only twenty-four; but she had known trouble, all her
nearest relations having died one after another, leaving
her alone among strangers in a strange place. But she
had known also where to find help and comfort, so she
had never been confounded, for with the trial there
had always been the consolation which those have who
put their trust in God. So the troubles of her young
life had only drawn her nearer to the One who alone
was found worthy to hold the book of God?s providence
in His pierced hands. And Mary?s grey eyes had


grown deeper and more serious in their expression,
while they had learned to beam with a holy love at
times which had a strange power of attracting hearts
to her, for she had learnt by suffering, borne with
sweet, pious resignation, something of His Spirit whose
glance when He turned and looked upon Peter was
quite sufficient to cause him to go out and weep
bitterly.
However, ? the flesh is weak,? and Mary was feeling
fagged and weary.
The Sunday school was just over for the day. The
clergyman and the Sunday-school teachers had with-
drawn, and the children, the little village children,
who were now Mary?s especial charge, wanted her to
walk out with them, as she sometimes did on Sunday
afternoons; for she believed rightly that to take the
little ones out into the green fields and shady lanes
among the birds and flowers after their Sunday lessons,
and, with a word here and there or a pretty story, try
to keep their minds in harmony with the sweet spirit
of the day, was almost the best thing she could do for
them. But to-day, as we have said, she was tired and
depressed, and she longed to steal away quite by herself
to hold communion with nature and nature?s God.
? Please come, please,? cried the children.
? Very well.?
It was ever Mary?s plan, when two paths lay before


her and she hesitated which to take, to choose that one
which was least agreeable to herself.
? Which way shall we go ? ?
? Oh, to Paradise; to Paradise,? cried the children.
? Paradise ; where is that ? ?
? Oh, don?t you know where Paradise is, Miss
Mortimer ? ?
? No; I have not been here more than six or seven
weeks, and I did not know Hickleborough had a
Paradise of its own.?
? But it has; we have such a nice place called
Paradise,? cried the children.
? What sort of a place is it ? ?
?It has hills and holes. It is covered with lons
grass. It has beautiful nut-trees in autumn, and just
now the daffodils will be out all over it, like stars in
the sky,? said a very thoughtful child, who was less
demonstrative than the others.
Mary looked lovingly at her.
? Pear little Carrie,? she said, ? will you show me the
way to Paradise ? ?
?We all will; we all will,? cried the other children.
? I will help,? said Carrie, slipping her hand into her
teacher?s.
She was an old-fashioned child of eleven years of
age, with great dark eyes and cheeks unnaturally
flushed, and she was always very much in earnest.


? We must come along this narrow lane if we want
to go to Paradise,? said the children.
?A narrow way that leads to Paradise,? wondered
Mary. ?Is this the best way ? ? she added aloud.
? Oh yes, there is a broader lane, but it is such a
long way round; this is narrow, but it leads straight
there.?
The words set Mary thinking.
Some of the little ones ran on before her, while
others loitered behind looking for violets, only Carrie
walked by her side holding her hand, while often the
child?s thoughtful eyes sought her face as if she would
fain read there the thoughts which were passing in her
mind.
Suddenly there was a commotion among the children
who were running on first. A boy had met them who
had said something which caused no little consterna-
tion. The children came running lack to their
teacher. ?He says last time he was there the gate of
Paradise was locked,? they cried.
? What shall we do if it is locked ? ? said Carrie.
The young teacher smiled, and, still busy with her
own thoughts, she answered dreamily, ? I cannot
believe the gate of Paradise is locked. We will go and
see.?
? Yes, we will go and see,? cried the children.
The words caused Mary to think of one in olden


times who was full of doubts, but to whom a wise
friend said, ?Come and see.? ?Ah,? she thought,
?if people would always ?come and see? there
would not be so many doubts and fears in the
world.?
When, at last, the one-mile walk was over, and the
place called Paradise was reached, they found the gate
was not locked, as had been predicted, but it was even
a few inches open, and within there was a glorious
spread of daffodils studding the grass with their rich
yellow, and making it look indeed a star-besprinkled
floor.
The children w r ere eager to enter, but, stepping
hastily forward, their teacher stood between them and
the gate.
It was a very lonely place, there was no house for
at least half a mile in any direction.
Mary took courage to speak to her little flock.
? All this, children,? she said earnestly, ? the
narrow way we have come, the broad way we have
left behind us, and now the beautiful Paradise we
have reached, with its pretty flowers and its gate
standing ajar, reminds me of that other Paradise above
to which we have to go along another narrow way, but
where there are never-dying flowers,? her voice broke
a little, but she went on bravely, ? and joys that never
cease. The gate of that Paradise is never shut by day


or night, but it always stands ajar for all?for you and
me. Children, will you all sing ? There is a gate that
stands ajar,? before you enter this earthly Paradise,
and as you sing think of that Paradise above.?
The words and what followed left their memory
upon many a young heart there. Standing by the
3-ate, looking into that little earthly Paradise, children
O J o o *
and teacher sang;
? There is a gate that stands ajar,
And through its portals gleaming
A radiance from the cross afar
The Saviour?s love revealing.?
And the chorus rang through the quiet fields on every
side, startling the shy birds and the timid sheep and
lambs with its refrain, ? Por me, for me.?
? Oh, depth of mercy, can it be
That gate was left ajar for me ?
For me . . . for me?
Was left ajar for me.?
And then they sang ?
? That gate ajar stands free for all
Who seek through it salvation,
The rich and poor, the great and small
Of every tribe and nation.
Pi ess onward then, though foes may frown,
While mercy?s gate is open ;
Accept the cross and win the crown,
Love?s everlasting token.?


And then?
? Beyond the river?s brink we?ll lay
The cross that here is given,
And bear the crown of life away,
And love Him more in Heaven.?
And then again that refrain, ? For me, for me.?
? Now, you may enter,? said Mary, opening wide
the gate.
The children ran gladly into the pretty hilly en
closure and began to gather the gay flowers.
Mary was left alone. Even Carrie had gone after
the flowers; and the young teacher sought a sunny
yet half-shaded bank where she could rest and delight
in the green grass, the budding trees, and the sight of
happy children.
She was very tired, almost too much so to enjoy
the beautiful scene with its canopy of blue above,
which reminded her so plainly that only one step
higher still was the Paradise of which her thoughts
were full.
? 0 Paradise ! 0 Paradise !
Who doth not crave for rest?
she whispered, looking up, and then, as her eyes fell
slowly upon the flowers down below, she felt reproved;
they were fulfilling their mission to please and gladden
the children of men, and speak to them of God?s love;
she must fulfil hers?but what was it ?


?Feed My lambs,? were the words borne to her,
through the bleating of a lost lamb in the held close
by. Mary hardly knew how it was, but they had
come, and she doubted not who had sent them. ? But
I?m so tired, Lord,? she prayed mentally; ? I long so
for rest; could not I, too, go to be with Thee ? ?
And the answer seemed to come again, ? Feed My
Lambs!' It is not for me to say how the Good
Shepherd speaks to those who follow Him, but there
was a very loud bleating gt the lambs in the adjoining
held just then; it was as if several had joined the one
truant in lamenting and mourning for the dam it had
lost?and we know His children can hear His voice
in everything that occurs.
But now the little ones came running up with their
howers. ?You may have all mine!? and ?I?ve got
them all for you ? ; and ? Please take them, dear Miss
Mortimer,? they said.
? Thank you, thank you,??Mary knew the heart of
children too well to refuse the generous gifts.
?We are so tired,? they said, ? tell us a story.?
? What about ? ?
? Anything you like.?
? Shall it be about Paradise ? ?
? This Paradise ? ?
? No, that above.?
? Yes, oh yes ! ?


?There was once a man,? began Mary, leaning
forward and speaking very earnestly, ? who had been
a very bad, naughty man; he had been a thief and a
robber; he had taken other people?s things, until at
last they caught him, and took him before a judge,
and the judge said he must die. He had to be
put to death. So they hung him on a cross ?they
stretched his limbs upon a great wooden cross, and
then they set the cross upon one end, and they left
him there to die, in the hot sunshine in terrible pain?
to die. He could not get down from the cross, and he
was very miserable as he hung there. M hen he
looked back upon Ins past life, he saw what a great
many things he had done wrong, and he thought he
deserved all this pain and misery he was enduring.
? But this poor man was not quite alone, there were
two other crosses near him, upon which two other
forms were stretched, and there was something about
One of these which made the dying thief look at Him
a train and again. For He was not like other men;
He had done nothing wrong. He had gone about
doing good, healing the sick, making blind people see
again, and deaf people hear. He had spoken words
of sweetest comfort to those who were sad, the little
children had been brought to Him to be blessed, poor
women had loved Him and had followed Him as long
as they dare, and had then stood afar off to see what


happen to Him they cared so much about. But
He had also reproved those who had done wrong, and
some of them were rich and powerful, and they did
not love Him for it?oh no! they hated Him, and
they had Him beaten very cruelly, and then nailed to
the cross upon which He was hung. And He was
meek and patient and gentle, He had uttered no
complaint : but when He was obliged to bear the
bitter agony of the cross, instead of crying out with
the pain as did the others who were crucified, He had
said, oh, so pityingly! ? Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do.?
? The thief had never heard anything like it before.
He wondered at the patient Being hanging there.
Men had said that it was He who was to be the King
and Deliverer of all that people?yet He was dying?
what did it mean ?
? And, down below, people were mocking this meek,
suffering Man, and they were saying, ?He saveth
others, Himself He cannot save.?
? And then the thief heard the other man who hung
upon the other cross, who had also been a thief and a
robber, begin to mock and revile Him too, saying, ? If
Thou be the Christ, save Thyself and us.?
? Aud the thief Coldd not bear to hear that, so he
reproved him, and then he looked again at the patient
Sufferer, who never answered back when cruel words


were said to Him, and who never reviled anyone, and
who never complained or resented what was done to
Him and surely God taught him that this Man, who
was so unlike all other men, was a King, and that His
kingdom would be different, would be grandci and
greater than any kingdom in the world, so he said to
Him, ?Lord, remember me when Thou comest into
Thy kingdom.?
?And Jesus ?yes, dears, you know it was Jesus-
Jesus said, 4 To-day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise.
? And would he ? would he be with Jesus that day
in Paradise ? ? asked Carrie.
? What do you think ? ?
? Oh, he would, I know, ?cause Jesus said so.?
?What is Paradise like, teacher?? asked the
children.
? What do you think ? What does your hymn about
Paradise say ? ?
? I don?t know.?
? Sing it.?
So the children sang the beautiful hymn, ? 0 Para-
dise ! 0 Paradise ! ? all through, and then their teacher
repeated her question.
? It says there will be rest there.?
? And no sin,? said an older boy.
? And plenty of love,? said Carrie.
? And no pain,? said another


? And there will be ? loyal hearts and true/ said a
boy. ? What does that mean ?? he added.
? That there will be those there who have followed
Jesus closely in this life, and have done what is right,?
replied their teacher; adding, ? And now, children,
what will be the best of all in Paradise ? ?
?Oh, I know!??said Carrie quickly, ? Jesus will be
there.?
?Yes, Jesus will be there,? said Mary Mortimer, her
pale face lighting up with joy.
Ah ! she felt then it would be sweet to be with the
Master in the ? green pastures ? prepared for His true
flock, in never-ending peace and joy. She had been
weary and dispirited that day, but the very effort she
had made to teach the children had done her good
It had been hard work to tell even that short story of
the dying thief, and she had thought for a moment
perhaps it would be little or no use doing so, but she
was glad now that she had taken the trouble; and
she was more glad still when, one day, the echoes of
that half-hour?s teaching wafted back to her in a
very different time and place, when she was well-nmh
sinking from a fierce struggle with this world?s sin and
misery.


CHAPTER 11.
FOLLOWING JESUS.
?0 Paradise! 0 Paradise!
The -world is growing old ;
Who would not be at rest and free
Where love is never cold ? ?
ARY MORTIMER?S work was not done, how-
ever, when they left the pretty wooded
I spot, with its gay daffodils and soft green
grass ; for, as they walked homewards along the narrow
lane, the children crowded about her talking eagerly.
? Tell us another story, please, Miss Mortimer,? they
cried.
? Oh, I cannot tell you more to-day,? she said; ? you
have had one that means so much; you ought to think
of it for a long time.?
Then the boys and girls began to make remarks
about that story.
?Why didn?t the Lord Jesus save Himself ?? asked


? Oh, I know,? said another; ? ?cause if He had we
should not have been saved Jesus died to save
sinners.?
? Will He save us, too ? ? said another.
? Yes,? said Mary, ?if yon ask Him; He died to save
all sinners.?
?But, teacher, I haven?t been right bad like the
thief?everybody says I am a good girl.?'
It was Carrie who spoke, and she spoke very earnestly
in an injured tone.
Mary looked at her flushed face and then at the
narrow way along which they were walking, and
smiled.
Hid you see that large waggon-load of furniture
pass through the village this morning ? ? she asked.
? es, yes,? said half a dozen voices; ?it was some-
one who was flitting ! ?
? Well, it could pass very easily along that high-
road, but how could it have come through this narrow
lane, supposing it had been going to Paradise ? ?
?It could not have got on at all; it would have
stuck fast,? they cried.
? But supposing the man who was driving the waggon
wanted to get to Paradise very much ? ?
He would have had to have left his furniture, and
gone on without it or the waggon either.?
? Just so, then things which could pass well enough


through the village could not pass through this narrow
way to Paradise. Do you understand, Carrie ? ?
?Not quite.?
? I will try to explain ; the way to the Paradise above
is a narrow way, so narrow that things which pass easily
enough through this world cannot pass along it to that
Paradise. No sin can enter there. And our own good-
ness will not take us there?what is thought good in
this world, where the light in which things are seen is
so dim and faulty, is not good enough for that world
which is lighted by the Sun of Eighteousness the
Lord God Himself.?
? What must we do then, Miss Mortimer, if we can
never be good enough ? asked Carrie, rather ti emu-
lously.
? We must ask God to wash away all our sins for
His dear Son Jesus Christ?s sake, and we must not
trust to any goodness of our own, but must ask Him
to clothe us with His righteousness, if we would enter
there.?
? But the dying thief did not say all that,? said the
child.
?No, perhaps there was not time, and perhaps he
knew that the Lord Jesus understood. We know he
did not think he was good, for he owned his bitter
punishment was just; but he looked to Jesus believ-
ingly, and that was quite sufficient.


? Will it do if we look to Jesus ? ?
? Yes, if you look in the right way, and if you pray
to Him, as the dying thief prayed.?
? I?ll remember,? said Carrie, ? for I want to go to
Paradise.?
Soon after that the village was reached and the
little band dispersed.
When Carrie reached her own home she found
the old grandmother who had adopted her was
very ill. Several neighbours were in the cottage,
talking with hushed voices and awe - struck
faces.
? What is the matter ? ? asked the child.
?Matter enough,? said one roughly but not un-
kindly ; ? your grandmother has had a stroke.?
Carrie began to cry.
? Let me go to her,? she sobbed ; ? she?s my grannie,?
she added, as one or two of them wanted to prevent
her going upstairs.
? You?ll disturb her.?
?No, I won?t. I won?t cry.?
So they allowed her to go upstairs.
The old woman could speak with difficulty, but she
had lost the use of one side.
? Carrie,? she murmured, ? my little girl.?
?Yes, grannie,? said the child bravely trying to
control herself.


? I doubt I?ll never get up again; you?ll have to go
to your own parents.?
Carrie was startled; she crept nearer to the old
woman. It was as if she had been told she would have
to go among strangers, for she had only seen her father
and stepmother ?her own mother was dead?once or
twice since she had been adopted by her grandmother
when quite an infant.
? I don?t want to go; I want to stay with you,
grannie,? she said.
O 7
The old woman sighed heavily.
? Eead to me a bit. I need some comfort out of the
Book,? she said, for she loved the child she had brought
up in her old age, and her heart was sore at the thought
of leaving her.
But Carrie thought she sighed because she feared to
die, so she got her large Bible and read about the
dying thief. It seemed as if she was to read that, for
the Bible opened at that place. But the little girl
coloured as she read, and she felt distressed, for not-
withstanding what Miss Mortimer had said, she
thought it was unkind to read about that poor thief to
her grandmother, as if she had been so very wicked.
So the child said apologetically when she had ended ?
?It isn?t as if you were so bad as that though,
grannie. You?re a very good woman, everybody says


? God forbid,? said the old woman; ? for He came
not to.call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
All my trust, and what I cling to now, is just this, that
Jesus came to save sinners, and I am a poor sinner, so
He will save me. Why, child, if I thought I was good
I should have nothing to cling to. He did not come to
save the good, He said, but the lost?the sinners?so
He will save me.?
?That?s like what Miss Mortimer said,? rejoined
Carrie. ? She said the way to Paradise was a narrow
way, and that though our own goodness might do for
this world, it would not be good enough for that.?
? Ah! those were true words,? said the sick woman.
? Lassie, mind what your teacher says.?
Then the women called Carrie away. But in the
middle of the night, as she was lying awake on her
little bed in the attic, they came for her, saying her
grandmother was dying and had asked for her.
Wrapped in an old shawl the child stood by the
bedside, gazing with awe at the old woman?s white face.
? Child, remember, the way is narrow. Lassie, it
will be rough for you. You must fight your way to
Paradise ?looking unto Jesus."
That was all the grandmother could say, but the
child never forgot those words.
After the funeral, Carrie was sent to Cromford, a
large manufacturing town, where her father, step-


mother, and sLx brothers and sisters lived. It was
very strange to the little country girl to havs to live
in a small house in a crowded back street, with walls,
houses, and chimneys on every side. Instead of the
trees, flowers, cattle and sheep, horses and pigs, which
she had been used to see on every side, there were
people, people everywhere. And such a noise of
human beings, both within and without the crowded
home in which she lived.
W hen she went out with an older sister in the town,
she listened tremblingly to the tramp of many feet, the
buzz of many voices, the rattle of heavy and light
vehicles over the stone boulders, the cries of different
street-vendors, and, over all, the whirl of machinery in
the great mills, and now and again, above the tumult,
the sweeter sound of the chimes from the great town
clock. She thought wistfully of the quiet country life
with her old grandmother, and the pretty flowery lane
along which she had gone so recently with the other
village children to their favourite Paradise.
Carrie had had one highly-valued letter from her
teacher, one part of which she often read over and over
again; it was?
? Remember you have the same God, the same loving,
pitying Father in Cromford as we have here in Hickle-
borough. And, though your new life must be very


different, remember you can walk along that narrow
way to the Paradise above just as well there as here, if
only you look to Jesus and pray to Him for help. He
is as ready to save you and take yon to Paradise as He
was to take the dying thief on the cross. Dear little
Carrie, try to meet your grandmother and Jesus in
Paradise.?
Although Carrie?s newly-found brothers and sisters
were kind to her in their way, the little girl felt shv
and strange among them all. And as her wistful
longing for the old life in the country grew more and
more hopeless, she thought less of it and more of the
Paradise above, where was the grandmother whom she
had loved so dearly, and the pitying, loving Saviour of
whom Miss Mortimer had talked so much.
And the country child drooped in the close town
atmosphere and could not take her food. And her
eyes seemed to grow larger and brighter as her face
became more pale and pinched. And she would some-
times fold her hands and whisper, ? 0 Paradise! 0
Paradise! ? in tones full of deep meaning.


CHAPTER 111.
IN THE INFIRMARY.
? O Paradise ! O Paradise !
I?m weary waitirg here ;
I long to be where Jesus is,
To feel, to see Him near.?
first Carrie?s friends thought she was only
pining for the fresh country air and the
old familiar village life. But by and by it
became evident that the little girl was far from well,
and the doctor who was called in looked very grave
about her case, and soon found that she was suffering
from a very terrible disease. Every remedy was tried
in vain; the child soon grew too weak to be able to go
out, and she would sit all day in the chimney-corner,
thinking often of the Paradise she had known below,
where, among the starry daffodils, a sweet earnest face
had told her of the Paradise above, where were never-
dying flowers and joys that never cease; and oftener
still she would think of that Paradise above, and of a


dear old woman who once bade her fight her way
to it. Ah, how that last remembrance startled the
oirl! What did it mean ? What had she to fight
against ?
She said to her mother wistfully, ? Mother, have I
anything to fight against ? ?
And the good woman answered gently, ? My little
girl speaks crossly and pettishly sometimes to the boys
and the little children; she must fight against the
inclination to do so. It seems a small matter, but it
is really a great one; when you are feeling weak and
ill, try to be very patient.?
Carrie cried a little; it was not easy to bear even
that mild reproof.
? They always called me good at home,? she said in
a low tone.
? There is no one quite good,? said the mother; ?we
must all try to grow more and more like the meek
and holy Jesus, who, when He was reviled, reviled not
again, and who prayed for His murderers.?
The little girl thought more and more about Him,
and it became gradually easier to restrain the hard,
cross feelings, and to speak only gentle words. And
then she found herself longing to do something more
for Him than only that.
? Mother,? she said one day, ?is there nothing more
a little girl can do ? ?


? Wait and see,? was the reply; ? the work will be
sure to come when you are ready for it.?
But it seemed as if the child?s work was to be only
suffering, and her fight only that quiet, unassuming
conquest over her own spirit, which is the greatest
victory of all.
But that was only for a time. By and by Carrie
found other work to do for her dear Lord Jesus.
It was in the Infirmary, where she was admitted
when the colder days of autumn were succeeding the
hot and, in that crowded back-street, close days of a
long dry summer. The child was very weak then,
and at first she used to lie all day on her little bed,
wearying for she knew not what, and often suffering
very much. But the good nourishment that was
given her, and the good nursing and medical attend-
ance, seemed to revive her failing strength, and she
began to take much interest in the other children
lying on the other beds beside her.
? What are you doing ? ? asked one of these one
evening, as Carrie, with closed eyes and clasped hands,
was saying her usual evening prayers.
Carrie did not reply until she had ended, then
opening her eyes and raising her head to look at the
inquirer, she said gravely, ? I was saying my prayers.?
? Prayers ? ? said the other child wouderingly,
? what?s prayers ? ?


? Why,? replied Carrie, in surprise that such
ignorance could exist, ? I have been asking God to
forgive me for all that I have done wrong to-day.
And,? she added tremulously, ? I have been asking
Him if I die before morning to take me to Paradise.?
? Paradise ? what is Paradise ? ?
? Oh, don?t you know ? It is a beautiful place on
high where we shall rest, and there will be no more
o '
pain. Don?t you know the hymn?
? 0 Paradise ! 0 Paradise !
I?m weary waiting.here
I long to be where Jesus is,
To feel, to see Him near.?
Jesus will be there ; and Miss Mortimer, that was my
teacher, said that would be the best of all.?
?Who is Jesus??
? Don?t you know really ? ? in a tone of great
surprise.
?Of course I don?t know, else I should not ask,?
said the child pettishly.
? Well, I?ll tell you. He was the Son of God. He
was the King of kings, only the people did not know
it. But I will begin at the beginning. He was up in
the glory of heaven; He was with His Father, God
Almighty, in joy and happiness. And God made a
man and woman, and put them in a beautiful garden
full of fruit and flowers, and He said they might have


all that was there, only they were not to eat the fruit
of the tree that was in the middle of the garden; if
they ate of that they were to die.?
? And did they ? ?
?Yes; before long they disobeyed God, and ate the
fruit of that tree, and they would have had to die, and
their children would have had to die, if it had not
been for God and for His Son our Lord Jesus Christ,
because He, the Lord Jesus Christ, said He would
come and die instead of the man and woman and all
their children and everybody; and we?re among the
everybody, Lizzie.?
? And did He ? Did He come down and die ? ?
?Yes; He came down, and He became a little child
?a little baby?and then a poor boy, and then a poor
man, and then He died upon the cross?l?ll tell you
all about it some day that we might be forgiven,
and might go to heaven to Paradise.?
? But I don?t understand clear, Carrie. What made
Him do it ? I can?t understand that. It must have
been so very hard to have left His happy home and
come down to be poor and die. What made Him do
it ? When my father has a hard piece of work to do
he always says, ï¿½ I must be well paid for it, or I won?t
do it.? What was Jesus paid??
Carrie did not answer at once; she was fairly
puzzled. Why did He do it ? What made Him do it ?


Now it happened that one of the nurses, a thin,
careworn-looking woman with a grave face, which bore
lines that told of much past trouble, was standing
listening to the children?s talk, a little way behind
their bed-heads. And little Lizzie O?Eeilly?s question
startled her, too, considerably.
What made Him do it ? What was He paid ?
Carrie?s thoughts went back to the past. She
remembered how her grandmother had loved her and
worked for her. ?But then I belonged to her,? she
thought. And then she remembered how Miss
Mortimer used to talk to them about Jesus, and used
to love them and care for them.
? People don?t always do things for money, Lizzie,?
she said. ? Didn?t your mother do lots of work for
you for nothing ? ?
? Yes, but then I was her little girl.?
o
?And I was grandmother?s. But then I used to
know a teacher who used to do much more than ever
she was paid to do. She used to work hard with us
out of school hours to get us to be good.? And Carrie
thought of that afternoon in Paradise, when Miss
Mortimer had looked so tired and yet had exerted
herself so much to talk to them and tell them about
Jesus.
? What did she do it for ? ?
? She used to say she loved us. And oh ! I know


now, that was why Jesus died for us. How stupid I
was not to know; but your questions put me out.
Jesus loved us, so He died that we might live.?
But Lizzie was not quite satisfied.
? We did not belong to Him then when He promised,?
she said. ? And you did not belong to your teacher;
how was it ? ?
?I think it was because Jesus was right full of
love? said Carrie, her little sad face brightening; ?so
He loved everyone, and Miss Mortimer was trying to
be like Him, so she loved us children. And I?m going
to try to be like them both, so I?ll love you, Lizzie
O?Eeilly.?
? Thank you,? said Lizzie, ? and I?ll try and love the
little girl in the next bed ; but she is such a cross little
thing.?
? Perhaps she hasn?t learnt how to fight,? suggested
Carrie.
? How to fight ? What do you mean ? ?
Carrie explained as well as she could by telling
Lizzie what her mother had said about fighting with
O O
the cross, irritable feelings.
?It gets easier in time, Lizzie,? she said; ? and
grandmother said I was to fight my way to Paradise.?
Lizzie?s thoughts had returned to the One who
died for them.
? Tell me all about it, Carrie,? she said.


So the child told the sweet story of the Cross in her
own graphic way, and the other children in the beds
close by listened intently.
And so they all heard how the tender, loving, pitying
Jesus was mocked and scourged, and how He bore the
bitter agony of Gethsemane and the Cross, and yet
how He prayed for His murderers, and took the dying
thief with Him to Paradise.
? But what was He paid for it ? Why did He do
it ? What did He get by it ? ? persisted Lizzie.
? Perhaps He got some love. But I don?t think He
got very much either; most people don?t care about
Him.?
? Ho, they don?t; that?s true enough,? said the nurse
to herself as she went softly away. And she thought
sadly that all her life she had never loved Him as she
ought.
When she came near to the children again Carrie
was teaching Lizzie to say her prayers, and the child
in the other bed at the other side of Carrie?s was
learning them too, for she said they were nicer prayers
than her own. They were very simple. Just ?Our
Father,? and
?Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me,
Bless Thy little lamb to-night;
Through the darkness be Thou near me,
Keep me safe till morning light.


Let my sins be all forgiven,
Bless the friends I love so well;
Take me when I die to heaven,
Happy there with Thee to dwell. '
And day after day little Carrie taught the children
in the next beds to her own about the dear Lord Jesus
and the Paradise above; while often and often the
nurse would hover near, listening and learning deep
lessons from that little child. For she began to under-
stand the love of Him who died that she might live,
and when she understood it well, then she could not
help loving Him and trying to please Him. So for
His sake she lavished love and kindness on the poor
sick children under her charge.
And they thought Nurse Bennet had grown very
kind; but they did not know that one among them
had helped to bring about the change in her.
And Carrie had no idea of all she was doing; but
she longed more and more for the land of rest, and
that she might see Jesus and be with Him for ever.


CHAPTEE IV.
GOING TO PAEADISE.
?0 Paradise! 0 Paradise!
I want to sin no more,
I want to be as pure on earth
As those on thy bright shore.?
OT long after that, Carrie was dismissed as
incurable from the Infirmary, and was
taken home to live her last months of
suffering and weariness in the crowded house where
her illness had begun.
Again she sat all day in the chimney corner, for her
strength had so far rallied that she was able to sit
up, and again she had to fight with the irritability
attendant upon her illness that she might not speak
crossly to those about her.
The fight was often hard, but it only made the child
long the more for the land where there is no sin, but
where all are good, because they see Jesus the All-pure
and the All-good, and are like Him when they see Him
as He is.


One day little Carrie had a great happiness, for a
clergyman came who sang to her of 1 aradise, and
talked to her about Jesus, and about being with Him.
And again and again He came, with a bright, glad face,
to tell that little one of Jesus. And one day her
mother told him how Carrie had taught those othei
children in the Infirmary, and he said she was like the
little Hebrew maid who gave God?s message in a
distant land.
And the clergyman would pray with Carrie ?and
the child loved to have him come?there was no one
like him, she thought.
And he sent a lady to visit her, who used to read
to her and tell her stories; and the child liked one
story better than most of the others, and that was
one which told how we may all get to the Bettex
Land. It was called ? The Gold Thread, and it was
written by a man who knew the heart of children.
After that, one day the clergyman was talking
about the Holy Communion, and he found the child
understood all about it ?she had not long to lb e, and
she was one of the Saviour?s little ones?so he allowed
her to partake of that blessed sacrament. And the
visitor and Carrie and one other who was very aged
took it together, and it was a holy and a blessed time,
for the Master Himself was present.
On the day after Christmas Day. hearing that the


Infirmary was open to the public, Carrie would have
her mother go to see if the children who had been in
the beds near hers were still alive.
One had died, the mother told Carrie upon her
return.
? Ah! ? she remarked, ? she said if she got first to
Paradise she would be there to meet me.?
And that reminds us of the old legend, that when
the souls of those who have departed this life enter
Paradise, the first to meet them there are always those
to whom, down here, they have done good.
Soon after Christmas, Carrie died. And on the
funeral-day, at a little service in the house of mourn-
ing, he who had so often sung of the Land of Pest to
the little sufferer, spoke to her friends of the One who
loved the little ones, and gathered them in His arms,
and laid His hands upon them and blessed them, and
who went far among the mountains to seek and to save
the one sheep that was lost. And he prayed that they
might all remember the lessons they had learnt from
that suffering child, and that they might all follow her
pitying, loving Saviour on the narrow way which leads
to Paradise.


CHAPTER Y
AFTER TEN YEARS.
? 0 Paradise ! 0 Paradise !
I greatly long to see
The special place my dearest Lord
In love prepares for me.?
MAS it any use ? Have I spent my strength
in vain ? Is God ? unrighteous that He
J should forget my labour of love ? ? Of all
the children whom I have taught, is there none to
whom my words, my feeble words, have done good ?
and is there none, no, not one who thinks of me now
with a little affection, and who would pity me if he or
she knew of my miserable condition ? Forsaken, left
alone?alas ! alas that I should come to this ! ?
And Carrie?s old teacher, for she it was, though her
name was no longer Mary Mortimer, but Mary
Sanderson, tossed restlessly about on her hard straw
mattress.
It was a cold day in January, almost too cold, people


said, for snow, and yet, every now and then, a sprink-
ling of fine crystallised snowflakes was whirled about
the street by the keen east wind. It was such a day
as one would least choose to be out in, and such
weather as would make district-visiting more hard than
almost anything. For to stand at door after door, as
ladies do stand day by day when they are trying to
follow Christ by going about doing good, in that bitter
cold, was almost certain to result in injury to health.
? I ought to see that poor woman our clergyman
told me about this afternoon,? said one of the Cromford
church-workers, ? but oh! I should so like to stop at
home by the warm fireside, and I have plenty of useful
occupation here,? and she looked wistfully at some
papers on the table.
They were old papers which had needed sorting for
a long time, for two or three, which were of some
importance to others beside herself, had got lost
among them.
The room was comfortably furnished, the fire burnt
brightly, the atmosphere was warm and pleasant.
Outside was wind and snow ?why should Amy
Murchison go outside ?
It is a wonderful thing this constraining love of
Christ, it would not let her rest. She thought, how
He, her Lord and Master, spared Himself no trouble,
no weariness, no discomfort in going about to seek and


to save that which was lost. And she thought of
Gethsemane and Golgotha, the agony and the cross, and
she did not feel comfortable about that poor woman.
But she tried to turn from those thoughts, and
busied herself with the papers. Ah ! here was a little
pile of letters. And this, what was this ? A funeral-
card. Whose was it ?
Opening it carelessly, she read, ?Carrie,? and the
date Jan. ten years before, and the verse:
?Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To-
day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise.?
Amy Murchison remembered the child who had
longed so for the Paradise above, and she remembered
how she had worked, in pain and weariness, in the
Infirmary to help the other children to reach that
happy land, and she remembered the solemn funeral
sendee in the house, when the child was gone, and
how the one who had ministered to her so well, told
how the Good Shepherd cared for His little ones,
and went far and wide to seek those that were lost.
And she remembered, too, what a blessing those had
received who had visited that little one of His, and
she knew His children may be of all ages.
?Perhaps this poor woman this deserted wife?
may be one of His little ones too,? she said, throwing
the papers into the desk and locking it. ? Anyway, I
will go and see/?


That was how Amy Murchison found Mary Sander-
son, lying ill in poverty and neglect, in a poor little
cottage about half a mile from her home.
? Will no one ever come ? ? the sick woman was
groaning, as a light step came up the stair.
Then Amy Murchison came in and ministered to her.
? What made you come ? ? said the sick woman about
half an hour after, when she was feeling much more
comfortable and greatly comforted.
? I could scarcely help it, it seemed to be so plainly
my duty to do so. Our clergyman told me yesterday
to try to come; he has not much time to visit himself,
he works so hard and is exceedingly busy.?
? And I don?t suppose you have nothing to do,? said
Mary, smiling feebly. ?It was very good of you to
come; I should like to tell you my story.?
? Please do.?
? When I was about twenty-four years old, I was
left quite alone in the world; my parents, sister, and
brother had all died, and I was obliged to earn my
own living; so I became a teacher, and, as soon as I
was qualified, I accepted the situation of schoolmistress
to the boys and girls of a pretty village called Hickle-
borough. Ah! notwithstanding the troubles I had
had, those were happy days, for I served One whom it
was a joy to serve, and I tried to teach the little ones to
love Him. In my poor way I tried very hard, and.


though I have never seen much result from my labours,
still I hope that, some day, the bread I cast upon the
waters will be found.?
?I am sure it will. Teaching is such noble work
when it is imdertaken in that spirit. And our Master
gives very good wages.?
?So I used to think. But lately I have doubted
even that. What reward have I, now, for all the hours
and the strength I spent then ? Until you came I
felt sadly forsaken.?
?It was only for a time. You know He felt forsaken
and left alone once. But He sent me to you.?
? Yes, and you are some of His reward, I am
sure ?; and the sick woman looked gratefully at her
visitor.
? But you were saying you were a teacher,? said Miss
Murchison gently, for the time was passing, and she
had work to do at home.
?Yes; for three or four years I worked hard among
the little village children; then there was one who
seemed to be very good and very earnest, and he won
my heart. He was a schoolmaster, he said, in Crom-
ford, and he persuaded me to be married to him. Ah!
I little knew what a trouble that would bring upon
me.?
The sick woman paused, and buried her face in her
pillow.


? Do not tell me any more if it grieves you to do so,?
said Amy tenderly.
But the other uncovered her face and went on
sadly?
ï¿½/
?At first I thought my husband was everything he
had seemed to be. He made great professions, but
then he seemed to really try to carry them out. But
oh, my dear young lady, forgive me, but I cannot tell
you all, and how gradually he began to slip back. He
was naturally selfish and lazy, and, after a while, he
seemed to cease struggling with these faults. Then
he took to drinking, and that soon ruined us. Oh, how
I prayed for him, and struggled to do all I could to
keep our little home together ! But by degrees every-
thing went. First I lost my child, my little Carrie?
I called her so after a favourite pupil I once had?and
then my husband lost situation after situation; and
when I gained one for myself, he nearly always caused
me to be dismissed. Oh, dear ! ? and the poor woman
broke down again.
It seemed very hard certainly when she had been all
the time trying to do right, and after she had served
Christ so many years.
? How much He must have loved you to let you be
so greatly tried ?? for whom He loveth He chasteneth,? ?
whispered Amy.
? He did help me; the thought of His love alone kept


my heart from breaking,? said the other quickly;
? When all else seemed dark, and the very foundations
of my life seemed to be giving way, the thought of
Him gave me peace and rest. ?He was my Refuge and
strength, a, very present help in time of trouble .? ? Her
pale face was lighted up with a smile of great sweet-
ness as she said this. ? But,? she added, ? sometimes,
as, for instance, this afternoon, I have felt almost over-
whelmed, and it has been harder than usual to rest on
Him. For my husband has taken everything of value
in the house, and he has left me altogether I think
this time. At anyrate, he left a note to say that he
was not coming back any more, and that his love for
me had died out, and he could not be burdened with
a sick wife. And lam glad he has gone.? She said
the words in a tone of such bitterness as, her listener
felt, spoke volumes about the man whom she had
once loved with the devotion of a true Christian
woman.
? I will try to get you into the Infirmary,? said Amy,
after a few words of heartfelt sympathy; ? I have a
recommendation, and I think there will be no diffi-
cidty.?
? Oh, thank you, thank you! ? said Mary, weeping: ? I
can never thank you enough for your kindness this
afternoon. I had been so hopeless, so despairing.
Looking back on my past life, I saw no result for all


my labour. It and I seemed to have been alike a
failure.?
? But you cannot tell. It may please God to raise
von up again to do some very special work for Him,
and how do you know but that your work has been
most successful with some others of the children you
have taught. We are not always allowed to see re-
sults in this life.?
?What made you come what made you be so
kind ? ?
? I will tell you. In the first place, it was the love
of Christ constraining me ; in the second, it was mostly
one little child, who died about ten years ago, but
whom someone had taught carefully about the Better
Land and the way there.? And then Amy told Mary
how at one time she was wrapped up in a different
kind of work?it, too, was work for the Master, but
that she might get on more continuously with it she
was closing her eyes and ears to all the sorrow and
suffering around. But one, a young clergyman?and a
very holy and earnest one?had begged her, if she
could do nothing else, to visit four sick persons, one of
whom was a little child. And on visiting her she was
greatly blessed, for the little girl had done work for the
Master. And then Amy told how the child had taught
the children in the Infirmary; and how, in visiting her,
she herself had learnt to have a wider charity, more


love in her heart, and more longing to help others to
walk along that narrow way that led to Paradise.
? The child?s whole heart was full of thoughts of that
Better Land,? she said. ? Her favourite hymn was
always ?0 Paradise! 0 Paradise!? and her favourite
Bible-story the one about the dying thief.?
Mrs. Sanderson stretched out a thin, eager hand,
? Tell me her name,? she cried; ? the name of that
little girl.?
? Carrie,
?It was, it was ! ? said the other excitedly. ? With
whom did she live ? ?
? Her father and stepmother when I knew her, but
before that she used to live with a grandmother in the
country, somewhere where there was a place called
Paradise?which place, when a dear teacher took her
there with some other children and taught her of the
Paradise above, first gave her a great longing to be there.?
?Dear little Carrie!? said the other with emotion,
? I was that teacher. Thank God, one of my lessons, at
all events, was not a failure ! ?
?It w r as not, indeed. The influence of that little
child has not ceased yet.?
? So she is dead,? said the other after a pause, ? and
when I came to Cromford and searched for her in every
direction I might well have done so in vain.?
? She has gone to be one of the never-dying flowers


in the Paradise above,? said Amy Murchison gently.
? But I must go. Do not be anxious, you shall be well
looked after, and I do not doubt you will be admitted
into the Infirmary.?
? I would rather go to Paradise now, if it be His
will,? said Mary faintly; for the poor soul had been
greatly tossed about and troubled in this world?
??0 Paradise! 0 Paradise!
I greatly long to see
The special place my dearest Lord
In love prepares for me,??
she whispered, looking up.
? But it may be the dear Lord Jesus has some
special work for you to do yet before you go,? said
Amy cheerfully. ? Think, is there no one you would
like to take there with you, or to help to get there
before you die ? ?
? Of course, 1 should like most of all for my husband?s
heart to be turned, and for him to gain that Better
Land. But it is almost impossible.?
? Nothing is impossible with Him,? said Amy, rising ;
?if we had only faith it would remove mountains.
Think of the hymn you made the children sing?
?There is a gate that stands ajar,?
and remember?
?That gate ajar stands free for all
Who seek through it salvation ? ?


T
and don?t cease to pray for your husband. God alone
can dispose his heart to turn and seek after Hini even
yet.?
? May God bless you! ?
?He has blessed me,? thought Amy Murchison,
going homewards through the driving snow, which yet
she scarcely heeded, for her heart was so glad and
thankful that she, in her turn, had been permitted to
minister to one who had once done work which had
been so greatly blessed.
And Mrs. Sanderson thanked God that the bread
which had been cast upon the waters that bright
Sunday afternoon, when she was a teacher at Hickle-
borough, had been found after many days.


CHAPTER VI.
THE NARROW WAY.
?Lord Jesus, King of Paradise,
0 keep me in Thy love,
And guide me to that happy land
Of perfect rest above.?
EFOEE long, Mary Sanderson was removed
to the Infirmary, where the bright days of
spring found her still hovering between
life and death. It was a long and trying time, but she
was very patient. The doctors thought it would be
well if something would rouse her to take more interest
in life; if she wished to get well, they said, it would
materially aid her recovery. But the poor creature
had had such a hard time of it in this world that, now
she had found a quiet resting-place, she lay down
resignedly, and seemed to have no wish or care to
become well ao;ain.
o
Everyone was kind to her, but especially one of the
nurses. Many times Mary Sanderson wondered at her


exceeding kindness, many times she felt inclined to
ask her who she was, and many times she longed
to inquire what made her so very good to her; for
the nurse would do many things which were not
included in her duties. For instance, she would
bring her a sweet flower, or would come and sing
in a low voice to her of Paradise when it was her
own resting-time, and once, when Mary mentioned
this to another patient, she replied, ?Oh yes, she
does like that to all of us; she is full of love,
that is it.?
One day there was great gladness in the sick ward,
for Miss Murchison brought in a most beautiful, large
basket of daffodils. The great bunches of gay flowers
were surrounded by clusters of dark green ivy hanging
down from the basket on every side. The visitor held
it up so that all might see, and then she came and
stood by Mary?s bed.
?Yes, I went to your and little Carrie?s Paradise,?
she said, in answer to a quick inquiry, ?and I found
the daffodils growing there, as you had said. It was a
beautiful sight.? Then she added aloud, ? Dear friends,
I have brought you all some flowers from Paradise. I
O V
have been to a beautiful place covered with these
daffodils, which looked among the grass like stars in
the sky; it was called Paradise, and it reminded me of
the Paradise above, where there will be never-dying


flowers and joys that never cease. I should like to tell
you a short story about it.?
Many a suffering face was turned to Amy?s as she
went on in her clear, sweet voice.
?More than ten years ago, a young village school-
mistress went there one Sunday afternoon with a
number of her scholars.
? ? Come on,? said the children, ? we will show you the
way to Paradise.?
? It seemed inviting, but the young teacher was tired
and dispirited, and it cost her an effort to consent to go.
However, she was richly repaid for the sacrifice of her
own inclination. She found that they had to walk
along a narrow way to Paradise, then there was a
rumour that the gate of Paradise was closed, but when
they arrived, they found it was ajar, and so the teacher
told the children to sing before they entered?
?There is a gate that stands ajar.?
For it all reminded her of the Paradise above. And so
the little ones sung of how ?
?That gate ajar stands free for all
Who seek through it salvation ?;
and afterwards, when they were tired of gathering
flowers, the teacher told them a story. She was tired,
and felt tempted to rest, hut the thought of the
Paradise above had made her long that all should enter


it. So she told the little ones the story of the thief
upon the cross, and how he who had been so sinful
that he owned even the bitter punishment he was
enduring was what he justly merited, saw in the meek
Sufferer by his side one whose kingdom would be
greater than any mere kingdom of this world, and said
to Him, ? Lord, remember me when Thou comest into
Thy kingdom.?
? ? And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee,
To-day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise.?
? And then children and teacher talked about that
Paradise, and sung the beautiful hymn, ? 0 Paradise 1
0 Paradise! ?
? And the teacher did not know whether that story
and that hymn impressed the children much.
? But one went far from there into this large town,
where she drooped, fell ill, was taken to this Infirmary
and placed in the children?s ward. And there all her
thoughts were towards Paradise, and her heart was so
full of it that she could not help telling the children
in the nearest beds to hers about it and teaching them.
And her words taught others besides children, for one
who used to visit her felt greatly stirred to go and do
so likewise, and that one is myself. Yes, that little
child taught me, and long years after she had gone to
the Paradise above, I tried to help others to try to get
there. But it is not always easy to do that. One


afternoon, when the Master?s work needed me, I felt
tired and disinclined to go out. But just then I came
across the child?s funeral card, and I remembered her
example, and I thought if she, in pain and weariness,
had taught others, how much more should I, who was
well and strong, do so. And on the card was written
the verse she had loved so well?
??Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee,
To-day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise.?
? And I thought of that sad but sweet story of the
dying thief, and how his heart must have been full of
love to the One who said those words so readily. And
I thought how gladly then he would have done
anything for Jesus; and if the Lord had said to him,
instead of those blessed words ?To-day you shall be
with Me in Paradise,? ?You shall be released from the
cross, and for a few years you must follow Me along the
narrow way which leads to Paradise, and then you shall
enter there,? I felt sure he would have been glad to do
it, even if the way was a little difficult sometimes.
And then I knew that was what the dear Lord Jesus
had given me to do; I was just to follow Him along
the narrow way to Paradise for a time?as long as it
is His will. And so I could not choose the broader
way of self-pleasing. It was but meet and right that
I should follow Him along that narrow wav.
? And so, stirred by the thoughts which Carrie?s


memorial card had suggested, I went to do the Master?s
work. And I found it was very pleasant, for He had
chosen even me to minister to Carrie?s old teacher, the
one who had taught her about Paradise, the one who
in self-denial and weariness had sown the seed which
upon good ground had sprung up and borne fruit a
hundred-fold. She is amongst you now, but she is not
strong, and I know she would not like me to point her
out. Only I must tell you, when I found her in great
trouble, she was feeling tempted to think that when
she had taught those children, and when she had tried
to work for God, she had been labouring in vain.
? I ask you, had the one who taught that little girl
laboured in vain ? ?
Amy Murchison paused, and there was a murmur of
? No, no,? from more than one sick bed.
And then a nurse spoke from the other end of the room.
? She taught me,? she said, ? that child taught me to
love the meek and holy Jesus, and I too am trying to
do His work.?
? You do it well. Nurse Bennet does it well,? said
several voices.
? I try to do what I can for Him, because the child
taught me how full of love He was, and how, if we
love Him, we must follow Him along the narrow way
to Paradise,? said the nurse. ? I don?t think, bless her,
she meant to teach me,? she went on, ? hut she used to


tell the children about it, and I used to listen many
and many a time; and one day, one of them, who was
a sharp child, said, ?But why did He do it? What
did He do it for ? ? and those words, I could not get
them out of my head. But, excuse me, miss, lam
interrupting you.?
? Oh no, please go on?what did the child say ?
? She was a little puzzled at first, and then she said
it was because He loved us. He was full of love.
But the other said still, ? What did He get paid for it ? ?
And she said, ? I suppose He got some love; but not
much though, for most people do not care about Him.
And I knew that that was very true, and I thought I
had never loved Him as I ought; and then I thought
how He had loved me, and I could not help loving
Him then, and then I could not help loving others for
His sake. So the child taught me.?
? And so the one who taught that child did not
labour in vain,? went on Amy. ? Ah, no. No faithful
work is ever done in vain. So let us all try to influence
others for good, remembering always that bread which
is cast upon the waters shall be found after many days.
?To some of you, dear friends, I doubt not the
Master says, ?To-day shalt thou be with Me in
Paradise/ But perhaps He says to others, ?Follow
Me first for a few years along the narrow way which
leads there.? And shall we murmur, shall we want to


go at once if it be His will that we should show our
gratitude to Him by working for Him here first?
Eather shall we not say cheerfully, ?Hot as I will, but
as Thou wilt. Thy will be done.?
And if the way be narrow, and if the cross we have
to carry be heavy, let us think of Him who first trod
that way, carrying His cross, and let us follow Him
cheerfully, thinking of the end of our journey?of the
joy which is set before us.?
There was silence in the large ward when Amy
ceased, except for the sound of sobs from one or two
who had heard, through her, the Master?s voice speak-
ing to them-we know His sheep hear His voice when
to others there seems to be no hint of His presence.
? Mlss Murchison.? It was Mary?s weak voice which
called her to her bedside. ? I wanted Him to say,
? To - da V shalt thou be with Me in Paradise,? but I see
now it would be better for me to follow Him, as long
as He wills, first along the narrow way which leads
there. For I believe He has work for me yet before,
through His mercy, I enter there.?
?And I believe so, too,? said Amy softly; ?the
other day I visited your old home here in Cromford,
and I found your husband had returned. He is there
now, but he is in a sad way.?
? How, what do you mean ? ? asked Mary anxiously.
? I tried to get him to sign the pledge, but he would


not hear of it. And one evening, when he had been
drinking, he fell downstairs and nearly broke his
back; he is so injured that I do not know when he
will be able to rise again.
O
? How does he live ? ? asked the wife sadly.
? The clergyman?the same who used to visit little
Carrie, and who said the child had taught him too?
gives him a little help. But I think he will have to
go to the workhouse unless something can be done.?
?Please God,? said Mary softly, ?that shall never
be. I will do my best. I will try to get well. And I
will nurse him and try to get him to walk once more
with me along that narrow way that leads to Paradise.
That is the special work my Saviour gives me to do.
It may be hard, but I shall trust that He who first
trod that way will guide me through it.?
? I am sure He will,? said Amy Murchison, never
doubting that now the patient would recover; for the
doctors had said in her case, the will was almost every-
thing. If she really wished to get better, she would
have a very good chance of recovery.
After she had gone, Mary lay quietly a long time
looking at the flowers, which, coming from the earthly
Paiadise, pointed so plainly to the Paradise above, and
leminded hex of all that she had taught the childx?en
so long ago. And she said to herself, clasping her
poor thin hands, ? Paradise is as real now as it was


then. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, to-day, and
for ever. He gave us the flowers; He lent us little
Carrie an undying flower of Paradise ?and He will
give me strength and help and guidance to follow Him
along that narrow way until I reach the happy land
where ? they that loved are blest.? ?
It was not easy to take up such a cross as the care
of that helpless, bedridden man, with all his selfish
cravings after that which would only do him harm.
But if the cross was heavy, Mary found that she
was not hearing it alone, for One was helping her who
made the burden light. And if the way was narrow,
she was not treading it alone, for One was there whom
Per soul loved. And I don t know whether her
husband will ever really become a different man, but
it will be no fault of hers if he does not. And I
think his heart must soften as he watches his noble
wife toiling for him and following so closely in the
footsteps of her Lord and Master; and I think, some
day, he will surely hear His voice in the hymn she
so often sings about the Paradise above.
Yes, some day, I believe he will turn and seek the
happy land where ? they that loved are blest , for his
wife prays for him.
