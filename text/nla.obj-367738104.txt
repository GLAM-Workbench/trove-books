THE FOLLOWING IS THE
History of the O'Reilly Family
By DR. O’DONOVAN
From the year 435 until the present time
“The ancestors of the family of O’Reilly had been celebrated
in Irish history long before the establishment of surnames in
Ireland. In the year 435 their ancestor, Duach Galach, king
of Connaught, was baptized by St. Patrick on the banks of
Loch Scola, and they had remained Christians of the old Irish
Church, which appears to have been peculiar in its mode of
tonsure, and of keeping Easter (and, since the twelfth century,
firm adherents to the religion of the Pope, till Dowell O’Reilly,
Esq., the father of the present head of the name, quarrelling
with Father Dowling, of Stradbally, turned Protestant, about
the year 1800).
“The ancestor after whom they took the family name was
Reillagh, who was chief of his sept, and flourished about the
year 981.
“From this period they are traced in the Irish Annals
through a long line of powerful chieftains of East Breifny
(Co. Cavan), who succeeded each other, according to the law of
Tanistry, till the year 1585, when two rival chieftains of the
name, Sir John O’Reilly and Edmund O’Reilly, appeared in
Dublin, at the Parliament summoned by Perrot. Previously to
this, John O’Reilly, finding his party weak, had repaired to
England, in 1583, to solicit Queen Elizabeth’s interest, and had
been kindly received at Court, and invested with the order of
Knighthood, and promised to be made Earl, whereupon he
returned home with letters from the Queen to the Lord Deputy
and Council of Ireland, instructing them to support him in his
claims. His uncle, Edmund, of Kilnacrott, would have suc-
ceeded Hugh Connallagh O’Reilly, the father of Sir John, ac-
cording to the Irish law of Tanistry, but he was set aside by
Elizabeth’s Government, and Sir John set up as O’Reilly in
his place. Sir John being settled in the chieftainship of East
Breifny, entered into certain articles of agreement with Sir
John Perrot, the Lord Deputy, and the Council of Ireland,
whereby he agreed to surrender the principality of East
Breifny to the Queen, on condition of obtaining it again from
the Crown in capite by English tenure, and the same to be
ratified to him and the heirs male of his body. In consequence
of this agreement, and with the intent of abolishing the tanistic
succession, he, on the last day of August, 1590, perfected a
deed of feofment, entailing thereby the seignory of Breifny
(O’Reilly) on his eldest son, Malmore (Myles) surnamed Alainn
(the comely), afterwards known as the Queen’s O’Reilly ,
“Notwithstanding these transactions. Sir John O’Reilly soon
after joined in the rebellion of Hugh, Earl of Tyrone, and died
9


on the first of June, 1596. After his death the Earl of Tyrone
set up his second brother, Philip, as the O’Reilly, and the
Government of Elizabeth supported the claim of Sir John’s son,
Malmore, the comely, in opposition to Philip, and Edmund of
Kilnacrott. But Malmore, the Queen’s O’Reilly, was slain by
Tyrone in the great battle of the Yellow Ford, near Benburb,
on the 14th of August, 1598, and the Irish of Ulster agreed
to establish Edmund, of Kilnacrott, as the O’Reilly.
“The lineal descendants of Sir John passed into the French
service, and are now totally unknown, and probably extinct.
The descendants of Edmund, of Kilnacrott, have been far more
prolific and more fortunate. His senior representative is my
worthy old friend, Myles John O’Reilly, Esq., Heath House,
Brno, Queen’s Co., and from him are also descended the
O’Reillys, of Thomastown Castle, in the County of Louth, the
Counts O’Reilly of Spain, the O’Reillys of Beltrasna, in West-
meath, and the Reillys of Scarva House, in the Co. of Down.
“Edmund, of Kilnacrott, had a son John, who had a son
Brian, by Mary, daughter of the Baron of Dunsany, who had
a famous son Malmore, commonly called Myles the Slasher.
This Myles was an able military leader during the civil wars
of 1641, and showed prodigies of valour during the years 1641,
1642 and 1648; but in 1644, being encamped at Granard, in
the County of Longford, with Lord Castlehaven, who ordered
him to proceed with a chosen detachment of horse to defend
the bridge of Finea against the Scots, then bearing down on
the main army with a very superior force, Myles was slain
at the head of his troops, fighting bravely on the middle of
the bridge. Tradition adds, that during this action he en-
countered the colonel of the Scots in single combat, who laid
open his cheek with a blow of his sword; but Myles, whose
jaws were stronger than a smith’s vice, held fast the Scotch-
man’s sword between his teeth till he cut him down, but, the
main body of the Scots pressing upon him, he was left dead
on the bridge.
“This Myles the Slasher was the father of Colonel John
O’Reilly, of Ballymacadd, in the Co. Meath, who was elected
Knight of the Shire of the Co. of Cavan, in the Parliament
held at Dublin on the 7th of May, 1689. He raised a regiment
of dragoons, at his own expense, for the service of James 11,,
and assisted at the siege of Londonderry in 1689. He had two
engagements with Col. Wolsley, the commander of the garrison
of Belturbet, whom he signally defeated. He fought at the
battles of the Boyne and Aughrim, and was included in the
articles of capitulation of Limerick, whereby he preserved his
property, and was allowed to carry arms.
“Of the eldest son of this Col. John O’Reilly, who left issue,
my friend, Myles J. O’Reilly, Esq., is now the senior repre-
sentative.
“From Col. John O’Reilly’s youngest son, Thomas O’Reilly,
of Beltrasna, was descended Count Alexander O’Reilly, of
Spain, who took Algiers! immortalised by Byron. This Alexan-
der was born near Oldcastle, in the Co. Meath, in the year


1722. He was Generalissimo of his Catholic Majesty’s forces,
and Inspector-General of the Infantry, etc., etc. In the year
1786 he employed the Chevalier Thomas O’Gorman to compile
for him a history of the House of O’Reilly, for which he paid
O’Gorman the sum of £1137/10/-, the original receipt for which
I have in my possession.
‘'From this branch of the O’Reilly family was also descended
the illustrious Andrew Count O’Reilly, who died at Vienna in
1832, at the age of 92. He was General of Cavalry in the
Austrian service. This distinguished man filled in succession
all the military grades in the Austrian service, with the
exception of that of Field Marshal, and was called by Napoleon
‘le respectable General O’Reilly.’
“The eldest son of Myles J. O’Reilly, Esq., is a young gentle-
man of great promise and considerable fortune. His rencontre
with Lord Clements (now Earl of Leitrim) has been not long
since prominently before the public, and in a manner which
does justice to our old party quarrels! Both are, however,
worthy of their high descent; and it is to be hoped that they
will soon become good friends, as they are both young, and
remarkable for benevolence and love of fatherland.”
BALLAD
“Oh! rise up, Willy Reilly, and come alongst with me,
I mean for to go with you and leave this counterie,
To leave my father’s dwelling, his houses and free lands —”
And away goes Willy Reilly and his dear Cooleen Baton.
They go by hills and mountains, and by yon lonesome plain,
Through shady groves and valleys all dangers to refrain;
But her father followed after with a well-arm’d chosen band,
And taken was poor Reilly and his dear Cooleen Bawn.
It’s home then she was taken, and in her closet bound,
Poor Reilly all in Sligo jail lay on the stony ground,
Till at the bar of justice before the Judge he’d stand,
For nothing but the stealing of his dear Cooleen Baton.
“Now in the cold, cold iron, my hands and feet are bound,
I’m handcuffed like a murderer, and tied unto the ground;
But all this toil and slavery I’m willing for to stand,
Still hoping to be succoured by my dear Cooleen Bawn.”
The jailor’s son to Reilly goes, and thus to him did say,
“Oh! get up, Willie Reilly, you must appear this day,
For great Squire Folliard’s anger you never can withstand;
I’m afear’d you’ll suffer sorely for your dear Cooleen Bawn.”


“This is the news, young Reilly, last night that I did hear,
The lady’s oath will hang you, or else will set you clear.”
“If that be so,” says Reilly, “her pleasure I will stand,
Still hoping to be succoured by rny dear Cooleen Bavm.”
Now Willy’s drest from top to toe all in a suit of green,
His hair hangs o’er his shoulders most glorious to be seen;
He’s tall and straight and comely as any could be found,
He’s fit for Folliard’s daughter, was she heiress to a crown.
The Judge he said, “This lady being in her tender youth,
If Reilly has deluded her, she will declare the truth.”
Then, like a moving beauty bright, before him she did stand,
“You’re welcome there my heart’s delight and dear Cooleen
Bawn /”
Oh, gentlemen,” Squire Folliard said, “with pity look on me,
This villain came amongst us to disgrace our family,
And by his base contrivances this villany was planned;
If I don’t get satisfaction I will quit this Irish land.”
The lady with a tear began, and thus replied she,
“The faul is none of Reilly’s, the blame lies all on me:
I forced him for to leave his place and come along with me;
I loved him out of measure which has wrought our destiny.”
Then out bespoke the noble Fox, at the table he stood by,
“Oh! gentlemen, consider on this extremity,
To hang a man for love is a murder you may see,
So spare the life of Reilly, let him leave this counterie.”
“Good my Lord, he stole from her her diamonds and her rings,
Gold watch and silver buckles, and many precious things,
Which cost me in bright guineas, more than five hundred
pounds,
I will have the life of Reilly should I lose ten thousand
pounds.”
“Good my Lord, I gave them him as tokens of true love;
And when we are a-parting, I will them all remove;
If you have got them, Reilly, pray send them home to me;
They’re poor compared to that true heart which I have given
to thee.
“There is a ring among them I allow yourself to wear,
With thirty locket diamonds well set in silver fair;
And as a true-love token wear it on your right hand,
That you may think on my broken heart when you’re in a
foreign land.”
Then out spoke noble Fox, “You may let the prisoner go,
The lady’s oath has cleared him, as the Jury all may know:
Slig has released her own true love ? she has renewed his naine.
May her honour bright gain high estate, and her offspring
rise to fame.”
