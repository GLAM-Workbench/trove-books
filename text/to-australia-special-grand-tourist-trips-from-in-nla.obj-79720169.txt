ANY a globe-trotter has remarked: ?1
have never yet seen Australia. I?ve
made up my mind several times to see
this country, about which I have heard
so many interesting things, but although
I have been close to it, I have never
yet visited it, but I really must go.?
Foreword.
T
Australia, the great Island Continent,
has much to show a visitor. It has many
features distinctly and peculiarly its own. Its progress
and development have been marvellous, and many
have been astounded at its wonderful richness and
potentialities, and its magnificent scenery, so peculiarly
Australian, yet so beautiful. It lies a little out of the
beaten track of tourists, who would have planned a
trip to it if the facilities had been greater. But no
Round-the-World Traveller, especially one who finds
himself at present in the Orient, should omit Australia
from his list of countries.
Recognising this fact, and that residents of India,
the Straits Settlements, Java, and other parts of the
Orient, periodically desire a change from the hotter
months in the tropics, the New South Wales Government
Tourist Bureau has arranged a series of special tours
which affords them a golden opportunity.
These Excursions have been fixed to leave Singapore,
at regular monthly intervals commencing from 28th
July, 1910, for the eastern States of the Commonwealth
of Australia, calling at Port Darwin and Thursday

FOREWORD.
Island, Brisbane, the capital af Queensland, Sydney
and Melbourne, the capitals of the neighbouring States
of New South Wales and Victoria. 1 ourists may at
their option journey overland from Brisbane to Sydney
and Melbourne. These comprehensive holiday trips,
outlined in this booklet, extend over a period of several
weeks, and an expenditure of from 15s. to 255. per day,
according to the personal taste of the traveller, will
cover the whole of his expenses, first class, until the
fulfilment of the programme. Tourists may extend
their stay for several months, as the return portion
of the steamer coupon ticket will cover the homeward
passage, up to a period of twelve months. Transport
in Australia is comfortable, speedy, and surprisingly
cheap.
Tourists froru flnrierica,
having done the round of the Orient, should embrace
this chance of extending their tour, by booking for
this trip, which must appeal very strongly to them as
providing a new field of interest and pleasure in one
of the world?s youngest, richest, and most promising
countries. In Australia there is much to be seen and
studied. It is a rich territory of beautiful country, and
is just getting into its stride in working out its national
destiny. Australia has boundless potentialities, and
its productive wealth is greater per head of its popula-
tion than any other land. Additionally it has a wealth
of scenic resorts, many of which have a world-wide
fame. Opportunities are presented to visitors on these
tours of seeing, besides the most renowned of its mag-
nificent resorts, something of its industrial life ?its
canefields, wheat lands, its sheep-walks and cattle
ranches, and its mineral wealth.

FOREWORD.
The Clinnate of Australia
is one of the most temperate and equable in the world,
but during spring, from August to October, and autumn,
from March to May ?it is ideal. In Sydney the climate
resembles that of Naples, which is, however, warmer in
summer and colder in winter than Sydney. Along the
coast of New South Wales, washed by the blue Pacific,
the climate is strikingly similar to that of the Mediter-
ranean seaboard, and generally, the climate of the State
resembles that of southern France and Italy. Sydney
has been well called ? The City of July Sunshine.? It
is beautifully situated on the shores of the peerless
harbour oi Port Jackson, and owing to its central
position and the magnificent railway system radiating
from it, is within easy access of a series of scenic
splendours unsurpassed in the world. The renowned
Pine Mountains, the marvellous limestone Caverns of
jenolan, and the Hawkesbury River, which for sustained
beauty is said to eclipse the Rhine or the Mississippi,
are reached in a few hours. The snowfields of Mount
Kosciusko, the highest peak in the continent, and the
oldest land surface on the globe, where the alpine sports
ot ski-running, tobogganing, and ice-skating are indulged
in, are within a sixteen hours? journey of the Metropolis.
Excursions may be made to any of these localities under
comfortable conditions, and at small expense.
In Queensland and Victoria, too, similar excursions,
around the capitals and into the country districts may
be taken, and if they consult the Government Tourist
Bureau tourists will be enabled to see what is most
worth seeing in the quickest time, in the most complete
manner, and at the minimum of expenditure.

WING to the demand for passenger accom-
modation on these trips it is urged that
berths be secured early, as priority of
application will ensure preference.
All baggage of passengers should be
plainly labelled to an hotel in Sydney.
Heavy baggage may be left on the
steamer at Brisbane for conveyance to
Sydney, where it will be collected and
delivered at the hotel, ready for the
travellers on their arrival. A small
quantity only will be required on
landing at Brisbane, which should also be carefully
labelled to Brisbane, and will accompany passengers
when landing.
Similarly on passenger?s departure from Sydney for
Melbourne sufficient baggage for their stay need be
taken, and the balance may be left in the Sydney hotel
until return from the Victorian capital.
On the Jenolan Caves trip visitors will be away
from Sydney for three nights, and will require sufficient
baggage for that time. It is advisable that luggage
should be confined to handbags and grips only, to
facilitate handling and reduce inconvenience to a
minimum. The caves being well lighted and improved,
nothing in the way of protecting clothing beyond
ordinary wear is required.

Tt]e Sea Route.
The ? Mataram ? ?one of the largest vessels running
between the Eastern Ports and Australia?and the
? Guthrie ? have been chosen for these tours. Each is
a fine stamp of mail steamer, quite up to date, with
airy, roomy cabins, and everything possible will be done
by their officers to make the trip a most pleasant one.
SINGAPORE.
The s.s. ? Mataram ? will leave Singapore on the 28th July,
28th September, and 28th November; and the s.s. ?Guthrie?
on 27th August, 28th October, and 28th December, 1910.
BA TA VIA.
The ocean distance between Singapore and Tandjong Priok, the
Port of Batavia, is 532 miles, and the latter place will be reached
after a passage of two days. A stay of one day is usually made
at Batavia so that tourists will have ample time to visit the
old town of Batavia to take a short railway journey inland,
and make a tour of the scenic beauties in the neighbourhood of
Welteyreden.
SAMARANG.
Leaving Batavia, the vessel proceeds along the coast of Java
to Samarang, the Capital of the province of that name, a town
of 80,000 inhabitants, 4,000 of whom are Europeans, situated
about 236 miles from Batavia.
The steamer usually arrives in the morning, and leaves the
same evening for Sourabaya. The journey from Batavia occupies
about a day.
SOURABAYA.
The distance from Samarang to Sourabaya is 184 miles, the
journey occupying about eighteen hours. This is the port of
final departure from Java en route to Australia. It is the
principal mercantile town of Java, the headquarters of the
military authorities, and has the dockyards and artillery work-
shops.

THE SEA ROUTE.
PORT DARWIN.
The steamer leaves Sourabaya in the afternoon and arrives at
Port Darwin, 1,180 miles distant, live days later, in the evening,
leaving again two days later. Port Darwin is one of the finest
harbours in Australia, and as the development of the Northern
Territory progresses, is destined to become an important shipping
port and commercial centre. The numerous tropical products in
the Botanic Gardens indicate the wonderful fertility of the
soil of the Northern Territory, which is rich in its deposits of
various minerals.
THURSDAY ISLAND.
Thursday Island lies in Torres Strait, opposite Cape York,
the north-eastern extremity of Australia, from which it is
separated by Endeavour Strait, and is about three days? steam
from Port Darwin. The pearling industry, which is conducted
on an extensive scale, is its interesting feature. For the most
part the pearl shells arc collected off the shallow reefs; but
deep-sea diving?a depth of 25 fathoms has been reached ?is
now practised, though not without serious risks. The work is
chiefly performed by Kanakas and Japanese.
TOWNSVILLE QUEENSLAND
Resuming the voyage from Thursday Island, the steamer passes
along the quiet waters between the Great Barrier Reef and the
mainland, and if inducement oilers will call at Townsville (660
miles) after two and a half days? trip. Townsville ?the largest
city in North Queensland ?in addition to its outer anchorage,
has a well-sheltered inner harbour, protected by a stone break-
water for a mile on cither side; it has a railway system of its
own, of which it is the centre, being unconnected with the other
systems of the state, although it is under the control of the
Queensland State Railway Commissioner. The town has be-
hind it three great sources of revenue?sheep and cattle raising
on the pastoral area of Cloncurry, the gold-mines of Charters
lowers, and the sugar plantations of the Burdekin. A trip to
Ayr, by rail, will bring the visitor to the heart of the sugar-
growing country. The steamer leaves Townsville in the after-
noon of the day of arrival, and will reach Brisbane?the capital
of Queensland ?(610 miles south) two and a half days later.
Note. ?Prior to arrival at Brisbane passengers desiring to travel overland will
require to obtain from the purser an ocean steamship certificate which will be ex-
changed prior to leaving Brisbane by the railway authorities for a first-class return
ticket from Brisbane to Sydney or Melbourne. All tourists should see that this
is obtained before leaving the steamer. Full particulars are given on page 13.

BRISBANE.
On arrival tourists will be conveyed by rail from Pinkenba,
the seaport to Brisbane, the Capital.
The following day, trips by electric tram may be, made round
Brisbane to Hamilton, Claytield, Highgate Hill, Paddington, and
Toowong, the most picturesque of the suburbs, at the cost
of a few pence.
Brisbane, the capital of the State of Queensland, is pictures-
quely situated on the banks of the Brisbane River, about 20
miles from where it flows into the ocean. Across an amphi-
theatre of dark blue hills the river winds like a silver ribbon;
the city clusters along its banks, and spreads over valley, un-
dulation, and ridge. The climate of Brisbane resembles that
of Southern California, which means that it enjoys one of the
mildest in the world. The population, within a 10-mile radius
of the city?s centre, numbers 137,670, which is more than one-
fifth of the total population of the State. Brisbane, though

smaller, is as up-to-date as any of the great modern cities. It
has some magnificent buildings, and its public and private
institutions would do credit to a metropolis far exceeding it in
size. Its comprehensive electric tramway system radiates
through the suburbs, and many of the routes are most picturesque,
commanding beautiful panoramic outlooks. Brisbane is amply
supplied with public parks and gardens, well laid out and splen-
didly kept, and the many beautiful homes of its citizens along
the river banks has earned for it the sobriquet of ? The Villa
City.?
Brisbane is destined to be one of Australia?s largest and most
important capitals. The State of Queensland is one of the
largest and richest in the Australian Commonwealth, and will
be the, greatest meat-producing country in Australia. The
State is rapidly developing and her progress in the future will
receive a great impetus when it feels the full effect of the Govern-
ment?s policy of assisted immigration, which is now being
rigorously prosecuted. In addition to the main products which
the several States have in common, Queensland is favoured by
her geographical position for the sub tropical products of sugar-
cane, bananas, arrowroot, anil cotton, which she alone of all the
Australian States produces in any considerable quantity.

large pineapple gardens, a bacon-curing factory, and extensive
brick and tile works.
At Nambour (65 miles) the party will detrain and be shown
the canefields and sugar-mill, and probably the crushing. Ihe
tableland of the Blackall Range, one of Queensland?s finest
orange-growing centres, as well as a favourite health resort, is
reached from here, and the opportunity will be taken to show the
visitors portions of this attractive country.
Queensland is the great sugar-producing State of Australia,
because her rich agricultural lands are in tropical and semi-
tropical latitudes. Of late years the industry has undergone a
rapid change. Under the old regime, the ? plantation ? system,
under which the same man was planter, mill-owner, and manu-
facturer, had vogue, and the largest percentage of the labour
he employed was ? black ? chiefly the Kanaka. This system
still obtains in most of the world?s sugar-growing countries, and
the large cultivated areas lie contiguous to the mills, the
growing and the manufacturing being one concern. To-day
quite a different state of things obtains in regard to Queensland?s
sugar industry. The Commonwealth?s ? White Australia ?
policy, under which the Kanaka was deported to his islands,
has left the industry almost exclusively to the white man. Side
by side with this great reform the Queensland Government
established what is known as the ? Central Mill System,? and
loaned the money for the purpose. The large estates now have
been cut up into small farms which have been sold or rented
to white cane-growers, who supply the central mill. Thus
the supersession of the ? plantation ? system has changed the
cane-growing industry from being the monopoly of a few rich
planters and companies to a most essentially democratic in-
dustry.
Queensland produced last year (1908) from 92,219 acres,
1,433,315 tons of cane, which yielded 151,098 tons of sugar.

On this journey the Sydney Mail Train will be taken as far as
Toowoomba (ioi miles), one of the most progressive and im-
portant of Queensland?s cities, standing in the centre of a fertile
plateau, at an altitude of 2,000 feet above the sea. At 24 miles,
Ipswich is passed. Ipswich, though not as large as Toowoomba,
is an important inland town, and the centre of great industrial
activities, including coal mining, woollen and cotton manufac-
tories, and it has extensive and well-equipped railway workshops.
Toowoomba, apart from its commercial and industrial im-
portance, is a famous health resort. The town is well laid out,
the streets being wide and improved by tree-planting; it has
some line buildings, and its surroundings are picturesque. Its
elevation and cool atmosphere make a stay at Toowoomba a
most benefiting change.
Toowoomba is a fast-growing City, and is destined to become
one of the most important inland towns on the Continent. The
enormous stretch of country immediately surrounding it is
capable of supporting millions of people, and it is the central
depot of railway lines tapping the north-eastern, south-western,
and western districts for over 5500 miles. Ihe wool, hides, and
fat stock from thousands of square miles of the far west, the
agricultural produce of hundreds of closely-populated farming
settlements, maize, chaff, wheat, lucerne, cream, butter, eggs,
poultry, wine, fruit, and millions of feet of timber pass through
here to the metropolis. Toowoomba is Chicago in Miniature.
The Darling Downs, which surround Toowoomba on the north,
south, and west, consist of an area of volcanic country, 4,000,000
acres, equal in extent to the American States of Illinois and
Missouri. The soil is rich ; black, red, and chocolate in colour,
and varying in depth from 4 feet to 60 feet, and the whole area
is well watered by numerous mountain streams. Some of the
? pockets ? in the valleys contain soil as rich and productive as
any in the world. The mild temperatures with these rich soils
enable all crops, vegetables and fruits of semi-tropical and
temperate climes to be grown. The crops chiefly grown are
maize, wheat, barley, anil lucerne.
Cost of trip, exclusive of rail fares, about 225. 6d. per head,
including drives and accommodation en route, and at Toowoomba.

Fares, Is.
The morning may be spent at points of interest in and
round Toowoomba, until the train for Sydney is joined at
noon. The journey to Wallangarra on the New South Wales
border lies, via Warwick and Stanthorpe, through the southern
portion of the Darling Downs. Wallangarra will be reached
at dinner time, when trains will be changed. Sleeping cars
are provided for the remainder of the journey, and berths may
be had at a cost of ios. The break of gauge on the railway
systems of Queensland and New South Wales necessitates the
changing of trains. All the Australian railways are State-owned,
and each Government adopted what gauge it saw fit when laying
their railway tracks. The gauge in New South Wales is the
standard one of 4 ft. 8� in., Queensland?s is several inches
narrower, and Victoria?s about 6J inches wider.
From Wallangarra to Sydney the journey lies for the most
part over the northern tableland, through a rich tract of country
given over to the growing of wool and wheat, and to dairying.
Newcastle, the great coal port, in the centre of one of the
largest coalfields in the world, will be reached at breakfast
time. From here on to Sydney the scenery is beautiful,
especially round Gosford, Woy Woy, and the Flawkesbury
River, which for continuous beauty of scenery has been placed
before the Rhine and the Mississippi near St. Paul.
During their stay in Sydney, tourists will find their time will be
pleasantly and profitably occupied. Sydney has few rivals for
beauty of situation, and visitors will see something of the extent

and beauty of the world-famed harbour of Port Jackson; of the
magnificent natural beauties in close proximity to the metropolis;
and of some of the scenic resorts, which a splendid railway
system brings within easy distance of it.
The electric cars convey visitors to La Perouse, via Darling-
hurst, Zoological Gardens, Royal Agricultural Society?s Ground,
Kensington, Randwick, Maroubra, and Long Ray, or to Bondi
or Coogee Beaches. The journey is an interesting one the
road crossing the country lying between Sydney Harbour
and Botany Bay. La Perouse is situated on the shores of the
historical Botany Bay, where the Navigator?s Monument and
other places of local interest may be inspected. Kurnell, the
landing-place of Captain Cook, the Columbus of Australia, lies
opposite. After seeing everything at this spot of such historical
nterest to Australians a return may be made to Sydney via
Botany, a busy manufacturing centre, or over the same route if
preferred.
I he magnificent ocean beaches at Bondi and Coogee lie within
half an hour of the capital, over a route leading through some
of the fashionable suburbs. In summer these spots are gay
with life, for thousands of Sydney?s inhabitants disport them-
selves in the foam-crested breakers of the blue Pacific. Besides
the delights of surf-bathing at Bondi and Coogee, there are
numerous outlooks over the panorama of ocean and coastline?an
imposing chain of bold rocky headlands and sweeping beaches
of golden sands.

On the first day tourists leave by the morning train for the
Blue Mountains.
The fame of the Blue Mountains has spread all over the world.
Of their wild beauty, their innumerable rugged peaks, their
wide, expansive valleys and deep, rocky gorges, or of their
beautiful cascades and fairylands of ferny dells it is unnecessary
to speak. Close to Medlow Bath are some of the grandest and
most fascinating sights on the Mountains. The Hydro Majestic,
Medlow Bath, is a palatial Hotel, which combines the splen-
dour of the Casino at Monte Carlo with the comfort and
homeliness of a first-class English hotel.
The afternoon will be spent exploring the beautiful grounds
attached to the Hydro, and in a drive through Blackheath to
Evans? Lookout and Govett?s Leap. Govett?s Leap, overlook-
nig the magnificent Valley of the Grose, is one of the finest
sights of the mountains. Here are to be seen some of the
deepest perpendicular cliffs known, and the majestic grandeur
of the canyon scenery has its only rival in the Yosemite Valley.
Good walkers may also visit the Grand. Canyon.

The following clay the tourist leaves Medlow by motor for
the Jenolan Caves, over a route traversing some of the finest
mountain scenery in Australia. The Jenolan Caves are, perhaps,
the most widely-known object of interest to visitors to New
South Wales. The fantastic formations of the Caves, their
fascinating grottos and recesses, filled with crystals of dazzling
brightness, with sparkling stalactites and glistening pendants,
are unsurpassed in beauty and attractiveness.
The Caves are in a limestone belt, which varies in thickness
from 200 to 400 yards, and through this formation the creeks
have worn subterranean channels, and have through countless
ages carved huge chambers and weird tunnels. Within the
Caves are beautiful stalactites and stalagmites in endless variety
?marble pillars, icicles, miniature cities, statues, frozen cascades,
shawls, caskets of jewels, and curtains of delicate lace. Some of
the formations are snowy white; others are grey, deep red,
yellow, or the colour of an apricot. These Caves must be seen
before the mind can receive an adequate impression of their
beauty and grandeur. The Jenolan Caves Hotel, a first-class
Government Accommodation House, provides the highest degree
of comfort. On the third day, after a further inspection of the
Caves, a return may be made to Medlow, and the succeeding day
after exploring more of the Blue Mountain sights, Sydney will
be reached in the afternoon.
Cost of trip about �5 10s., including all expenses while absent
from Sydney.

SAILING SCENES, SYDNEY HARBOUR.


Tourists will proceed on one of the palatial ferry steamers of
the Port Jackson and Manly Company to Manly, a popular
maritime suburb, beautifully situated at the base of North Head,
one of the noble promontories guarding the entrance to the
Harbour. From Manly special drags will be taken to Newport,
along 12 miles of line hard road which skirts the coast the whole
way, and commands the most glorious views of the magnificent
chain of golden ocean beaches and bold coastal promontories.
Alter lunch at Newport, steamer is taken for Broken Bay, via
Pittwater ?a long, picturesque estuary. Broken Bay, whose
beauty rivals Sydney Harbour, is traversed, and then the
steamer glides over the placid waters of the famous Hawkesbury
River, one of the scenic splendours of the State; and varied
natural pictures unfold themselves as the steamer enters each
reach or glides round the foot of each spur. The railway station
at Hawkesbury, which is quite close to the huge steel bridge
which spans the river, will be reached in time to catch the
train for Sydney, arriving about dinner-time.
Cost of trip, 11s., including all expenses.

A special Tourist Observation steamer, the ? Kookaburra,?
runs once a week to enable visitors to see the glories of the
world-renowned Harbour under the best and most favourable
conditions. They will see more during the day than any
visitor could hope to see in a week by the ordinary means
of transit. Sydney Harbour, for extent and sustained beauty,
is the finest in the world. The Harbour proper will be visited,
and inspections made of the extensive wharfage systems and
the ocean liners lying alongside or at anchor; of Government
House, the picturesque Botanic Gardens, Lady Macquarie?s
Chair, as well as the maritime suburbs along the northern shores,
and many other sights equally interesting or attractive. The

Sydney is the terminal point of the steamers, but advantage
may be taken of the Ocean s.s. rail fares concessions for an
extension of the tour to Melbourne.
Sleeping berths at 10s. each may be booked in Sydney before
commencing the railway journey. Seats may be had in the
Parlour car on the Victorian side at a cost of qs. each.
SYDNEY to MELBOURNE.
On arrival at Albury, the border station, the \ ictorian car will
be in waiting, as was the case at the Queensland border.
This is rendered necessary on account of the variation in the
gauge of the railway tracks. Shortly after leaving Albury the
Murray River, which forms the boundary between the States,
is crossed. An interesting journey of iqo miles over typical
Australian scenery, brings the visitor to Melbourne, the capital
of Victoria. The country between Albury and Melbourne is
mostly flat and well grassed, and is devoted principally to
grazing purposes.
Melbourne is the best laid-out city in Australia; its streets are
wide and rectangular, and are planted with trees and gardens.
The city proper occupies an area of one mile square, and its
picturesque environs stretch for miles in all directions.
The afternoon of arrival may be devoted to tram or in motor
rides round Melbourne and some of its fashionable suburbs,
which will afford an opportunity of seeing the city, its buildings,
boulevards, and gardens.
Tram fares amount to but a few pence, and motors for small
parties cost about ios. for each passenger.

Ballarat, the City Beautiful, is world-famed for its gold-
mining. It is the centre of one of the world?s richest goldfields.
It is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and is called
? The Athens of Australia.? Like Melbourne it has very wide
thoroughfares, and it is thoroughly up-to-date. Right against
the city is Lake Wendonree, a charming sheet of water, circled
by the electric tram system, and the scene of aquatic pastimes.
Ballarat is rich in public parks and gardens, and has the finest
collection of statuary in the Southern Hemisphere.

Ballarat is celebrated as the scene of the Eureka Stockade,
when, in 1854, the miners resisted the imposition of unfair
license fees, and, sheltering themselves behind a stockade of
carts, logs, and slabs, hoisted a revolutionary flag. Taken by
surprise in the early morning one Sunday, ill armed to resist
the soldiers, they were soon defeated, but steps were imme-
diately taken to redress their grievances. A monument now
marks the spot of this historic episode. The leader of the
insurrection was afterwards Speaker of the Victorian Legislative
Assembly.
Tourists may drive to all the most interesting places near
the City and to Mount Buninyong, from whose summit stretches
a fine .panorama of the city and district.
Cost, inclusive of meals, rail and coach, about 30s.
