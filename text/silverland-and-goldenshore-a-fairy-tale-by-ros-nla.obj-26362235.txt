N a land which has ever
been, but which no one
has ever seen, little Sil-
, verwing floated from
flower to flower, resting
| from time to time on
cobweb threads, and
passing on to moonlight rays he paused,
and reflected how wonderful it would be
to descend that ladder of light and ex-
plore the dark round ball revolving
below!
On little silver feet he sped, and then,
spreading his shining wings, he alighted
on this strange old Earth. At first Silver-
wing was quite alarmed by the terrible
sounds he heard, for he had come from
Silverland —the land of Music —and the
noise of a city not far away, made him


SILVLRLAND AND GOLDLNSHORL
quite dizzy. On looking round, he found
himself standing by a cottage, creeper-
covered, amid green fields, and, by the
light of the moon, Silverwing saw an
open casement window.
In he flew, and the tinkle of the silver
bells on his wings and feet awoke little
Freda, as she lay asleep on her white
bed. Though astonished, she could feel
no fear of her fairy visitor—for he was
so sweet to look at—and he offered in
such a silvery voice to take her to Silver-
land, that she rose eagerly—and how, she
never knew—they soon left Earth, where
poor Silverwing had been quite scared by
the discords of this world, which we
mortals never notice.
Arrived in Silverland, how can I tell
you what met Freda’s eyes and ears ?
The King and Queen were resting
under graceful silver beeches and birch
trees; the silver poplars, and indeed all
the trees, made exquisite music as they
waved gracefully to and fro. In a silver
lake swam silver fish, and the silver ferns


SILVLRLAND AND GOLDENSHORE
and flowers bent and whispered to each
other
"This is the land of Silver sound,
Sought for for ever, but never found.
For speech is silver, silence gold crown’d,
Where light, and laughter, and music
abound.”
Ju& by their Majesties—the King and
Queen—a moonlit fire blazed under a
singing silver kettle, and on a tray of the
same precious metal, placed near, were
two dainty shining silver cups—for the
King and Queen loved their tea as we do!
Silverwing led Freda on, and presently
they flopped to hear the song of a jaunty
bird—all the birds were silver-winged
and also silver-tongued—who carolled
gaily
”1 am the merry, gay Kookaburra,
In the art of mirth am become mo&
thorough,
I live to tease, and laugh, and joke,
And make the sides split of all good
folk!”
Further on they met some tiny funny
beings, who sang


SILVLRLAND AND GOLDLNSHORL
"We are the men of toaSt, speech and
pun,
At dinners and parties we make half
the fun!”
Again they came in sight of some strange,
tall figures, in long silver robes, who
glided slowly and gracefully to and fro,
singing
"We are the long conversations,
Ledtures, debates, and dissertations,
To freedom of speech we make no re-
servations,
And to bid us cease would be the curse
of nations!”
Next, Freda and her guide came upon
some pretty silver-winged chickens, they
said
"We are soft answers, that turn wrath
away,
Follow us closely, use us each day.”
These are only a few of the many strange
and interesting creatures that Freda saw
and heard. At length they Stood upon a
shore of gleaming moon-Stones, on the
edge of a moonlit sea, where a beautiful
white swan invited Freda to seat herself


SILVLRLAND AND GOLDE.NSHORL
in the folds of his great wings, and then
gently floated out on the phosphorescent
waters. "Good-bye, dear Freda,” said
Silverwing in the loveliest voice, "you
are now going to visit Goldenshore; there
I may not go, but I wonder if you will
prefer it to Silverland ? Farewell!” And
with tinkle of bells, he disappeared in
the silver moonlight mi&s.
Gradually the sound of the lapping
waves ceased, as Silverland faded from
sight, the white swan and silver sea be-
came tinged with a yellow glow, which
deepened in tint, till a shore of golden
sand, bathed in a flood of sunlight was
reached.
Freda stepped ashore, and the swan
sailed away in silence. Though all was
so quiet Freda found she was not alone,
for playing on the shore were three little
golden elves. They bowed low to Freda,
and one, whose wings were marked
"Golden Wing,” beckoned her to follow
him. How she knew she never could
tell, but she understood all perfectly,


SILVE.RLAND AND GOLDENSHORE.
though none of the Fairies spoke or sang.
Over the nugget-strewn strand they
passed, into a golden com field, where
the golden ears bent and swayed, and
whispered: —
"This is the Land of Goldenshore,
No one has ever seen it before;
Even the golden com says ’hush,'
Thus whispered the com in the golden
flush.”
I cannot tell you what Freda saw. They
came to a glorious golden Castle, where
on pure golden thrones sat their Majes-
ties the King and Queen of Goldenshore
—as befitted their royal state, which
was far more magnificent than that of
Silverland. Written in large letters of
sovereigns above the thrones Freda
read: —
"If speech be silver, Silence is Golden,
This is the motto from times very olden!”
The faces of the King and Queen were
so beautiful that Freda did not feel afraid,
and though neither Fairy King nor Queen
spoke, they waved their sceptres over


SILVE.RLAND AND GOLDLNSHORL
her head, and brushed her hair with
their wings, that she felt no need of
words. On a table near, was placed a
tray on which was golden wine from
yellow grapes, and a gleaming bowl,
filled with golden apples and apricots,
also dishes of honey, and cream coloured
butter, with cheese and a golden-brown
loaf. Tea was not sufficient for the King
and Queen of this country; perhaps as
they did not talk they were not so thirty
as in Silverland. Anyhow, Goldenwing
escorted Freda through vast halls, where
fires burned in enormous grates, and
golden roses in huge masses filled large
bowls everywhere; while golden harps
and horns stood in comers, untouched.
Out in the Courtyard a gilded fountain
played, and gold fish swam round in the
basin, but one heard no plash of water
or fish on the yellow iris below. Outside
the Cattle gate rose a clear mountain
peak, glowing full in the rays of the sun
—from the sparkle of gold dust of which
it was composed. Here lay the graves of
unspoken wishes; and looking in one

cave, were iridescent icicles, where were
buried all cross and angry words which
had been checked ’ere they were uttered.
The very summit of the mountain was
the Crown of all noble Silences. Golden-
wing showed all with such a look of
pride and happiness on his face, that
Freda caught something of its glow, and
thought how she would try when she got
home again to sacrifice more cross words
to the graves in the cave.
Of the strange, silent figures, in long
golden garments, it would take long to
tell, and weary you to hear —But when
at length Goldenwing assisted Freda
down the long rays of sunlight to earth,
and vanished in the golden mists, she
was glad to find herself once more in her
little white bed, and she smiled at the
bunch of yellow roses on the table near.
But which she liked the better, Freda
could never tell—
SILVERLAND OR GOLDENSHORE
