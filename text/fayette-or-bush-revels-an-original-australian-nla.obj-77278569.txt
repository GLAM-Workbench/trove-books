Note. ?The time is in the early period of the Australian gold diggings,
when extraordinary instances of extravagance on the part of lucky
diggers were of every day occurrence. One of these, Tom Trueman, after
having exhausted the delights of Melbourne, has conceived the idea of
astonishing his mates at the diggings by hiring and taking back with him
a whole Variety Troupe. He has bargained with the members of the
Troupe that, at intervals during their journey through the Bush, they are
to give performances for his sole entertainment.


FAYETTE ;
BUSH REVELS.
ACT I.
Scene ?A picturesque hush scene in Australia. Tree ferns and
other characteristic vegetation. The curtain rises on a
picnic scene. The ladies of the Variety Troupe attired as
fairies. Plentiful set-out of eatables, champagne bottles, Sfc.
Appurtenances of the banquet rough. The banqueters are
reclining ?some on the ground, some on fallen trees, some
against saddles.
Dame Davies attired as a witch?tall red hat, Sfc. Of
the male characters, Tom Trueman alone is present at the
opening of the scene. During the first song, he is seen to be
irritated?tapping the ground with his foot, Sfc.
Before the entrance of Unlucky Joe, the stage is
gradually darkened. Toward the end of the Act, the moon
rises.
OPENING CHOEUS OP WOMEN.
Yes, if we were fairies other than in looks,
The fairies that yon read of in the story-hooks,
We would form into a circle on the dewy, dewy ground,
And would foot it, foot it, foot it in a merry, merry round,
SOLO.? Ean.
Yes, if we were built of such stuff as are the fairies,
Who dew their orbits nightly on happy English ground,
Filmy little creatures, lighter than the air is,
We would foot it, foot it in a merry, merry round.
But we Australian fairies, Antipodean fairies,
Deplete with ham and tongue and lobster salad, do not feel
Like those filmy little creatures, lighter than the air is,
Whom a tiny dew-drop serves for a meal.
(Yawn and stretch.)


CIIOEUS OF WOMEN.
No, Sir, we are not fairies other than in looks,
We?re not the sort of fairies that you read about in books,
But like ordinary mortals who have gloriously dined,
We are each {yawn) and all {yawn) for a bange inclined.
(All yawn and stretch themselves.)
Tom. Then you won?t dance!
All. No-o-oh. Not just after dinner.
Tom. But I say you shall !
All. Sha-a-n?t.
Fan. Not on top of a meal.
Tom. But it?s precisely after dinner that 1 want to be amused!
Wasn?t it partly to amuse me in camp on my way back to the
diggings that I bought the lot of you ?
All. {Starting up into sitting posture. Indignantly.)
?Bought??
Dame Davies. Come, now, girls ; Mr. Tom means no harm.
His expression ? bought ? is simply equivalent to ? purchased our
services ? ?and as these services were partly to consist in
enlivening his return journey after his ?1 think the word is?
ah?spree, Mr. Tom??in the metropolis, by interspersing those
(pointing around) wild Australian bush effects with ?was it not
so, Mr. Tom? ?with, let us say, picturesque reminiscences of our
profession
All. Oh, do be quiet, Mother Davies!
Fax. Do drop the boarding-school, Dame Davies. We all
know you kept one ?and didn?t succeed. Oh, bother those
wings! (Making as if the wings were in the way of her
reclining.)
Dame Davies. Bother the wings indeed! And, pray, why
did you humour Mr. Tom?s fancy so far as to dine in your pro-
perty dresses, if you didn?t mean to give him his bargained for
?post-prandial ?terpsichorean ?divertissement ? Why did you
put them on ?
All. Ah, but that was before dinner.
Tom. Look here, girls. It seems to me you don?t understand
the situation. I?m getting tired of explaining it every night ?
Dame Davies. And no wonder, Mr. Tom. The marvel is
that your patience with these naughty girls has not been
exhausted long ago. Permit me to take the task off your
shoulders for this evening. Let me explain the situation.


SOLO. ? Dame Davies.
Three jolly diggers tired of luck
Repaired to town their gold to waste ;
Soon two of them got Cupid-struck,
And matrimonial bonds embraced.
So Bob was to his Susan tied,
And Tim was wedded to his Sally;
But Tom, whose heart was far too wide
With one love to be satisfied,
His vast affection did divide
Amongst a total corps de ballet.
Chorus. Oh shame, oh shame, you naughty man,
With twenty girls at once to dally.
None but a wicked Mormon can
Espouse a total corps de ballet.
But need arising to return
To whence his hoards of gold he drew,
He felt his high ambition burn
To show his old mates something new.
And being of the favored few
Whose fortunes with their wishes tally,
He offered an abnormal screw
To all who?d go with him unio
The diggings at Toolooraloo ??
In snort, he hired the corps de ballet.
Chorus. But don?t forget this naughty man
With each in turn did shilly-shally,
With Moll and Bet and Nan and Ean ?
In short, with all the corps de ballet.
And furthermore did each engage,
While journeying to the field of gold,
To cheer his heart at ev?ry stage
With fairy frolics manifold.
But never by the slightest chance,
Though nearing now the golden valley,
Has one of you, when asked to dance,
Displayed a ready complaisance ;
That comes of payment in advance,
You most ungrateful corps de ballet.
Chorus. But don?t forget, this naughty man
Has woo?d us individual,
The while his brisk affections ran
Around the total corps de ballet.
Ean. But why call us ungrateful, Dame Davies ? It is Tom
who is ungrateful to us.
Tom. Ah ! How so ?


Pan. Why, what was your principal object in life when you
first fell in with us in Melbourne ? Wasn?t it to get rid of your
money ?
Tom. It was.
Pan. And didn?t we try our best to help you to do so ?
lom. You did. By Jove, you did. You fill me with remorse!
I am an ungrateful hound !
Pan. Besides, you are forgetting one clause in our agreement.
It said, ? except in case of sickness ? ?and oh, we all feel so ill.
All. Oh? so ? ill!
Tom. Beast that lam ! Poor, poor girls ! Hood Lord, was
there ever such a delicate lot! 11l every evening ! Brute that I
am !
Dame Davies (aside). Poor dear simple wretch. To see him
now, who would think that this little piece of comedy had been
rehearsed every evening since we started? Now for the usual
medicine.
Tom. Dear girls, would a little more champagne do any
good, do you think ?
(They all nudge each other.)
Pan. Well? l have heard champagne recommended for?for
it. Perhaps we might dare to run the risk.
Tom. All right, my children. There?s lots more in the dray.
[Exit.
(When he is gone, they rise gradually , tcatcli him disappear , and ,
?when he is supposed to he out of sight, fall to dancing ?
singing the ichile in chorus.)
Por though we are not fairies other than in looks,
No fairies that you read of in the story-books
Can lightlier foot it on the dewy, dewy ground.
When there?s champagne around?when there?s champagne
[around.
Dame Davies. Hush, girls. A stranger approaches. \They
make as if to run away). No ; don?t run off, dears! This may
be another lucky digger. Pray, be demure. Whatever you do
afterwards, begin by being demure.
[They slip off gradually to the side wings.
Enter Dr. Jack, staggering with fatigue , carrying a saddle and
hridle which he deposits on the stage.
Dr. Jack ?( Recitative).
A horse ! A mare ! My kingdom for a moke !
Nag dead?-grub done?ilask void?throat dry as coke?
Lost in the Bush?in point of fact, dead broke?
Bereft of ev?n the wherewithal to smoke ?


Under such circumstances I should just like to know what
advantage a university degree gives a man over other folk.
(Sits down on the saddle.)
SOLO. ? Du. Jack.
I was happy on the day
When they made me M.A.,
M.A. of Trin Coll. Dub.;
Now, those letters I would swop
For the smallest mutton-chop,
Or aught in the shape of grub.
For now I plainly see
That the scholarly degree
Which once made me
As proud as any king,
Is a quite uneatable,
Totally undrinkable,
Utterly useless thing.
(The chorus girls sing softly the last three hues after him
pauses for a moment as ijpuzzled, and then resumes.)
I was proud of my degree
When they made me M.D.,
M.D. of Trin. Coll. Dub.;
Now, I?d trade it like a shot
For the very smallest ? tot?
That was' ever dispensed in a pub.
For now when bush?d I see
That the scholarly degree
Which once made me
As proud as any king,
Is a quite uneatable
Totally undrinkable,
Utterly useless thing.
(Chorus and action as before.)
Oh the devil run away
With that hungry M.A.,
And my doctor?s degree to boot;
On my continental oath
I would sacrifice them both
For the stump of a bad cheroot
For it?s now when bush?d I see
That the trumpery degree
Which once made me
As proud as any king,
Is a quite uneatable
Totally undrinkable
Utterly unsmokeable thing.
(Chorus and action as before.)


Here chorus girls enter and form in line at hack of stage.
Dr. Jack. Still, medical knowledge is good tor a little even
now. If I didn?t know something about medical science, I would
say I heard voices. As it is, I simply say?? cerebral exhaustion
caused by want of food, and especially by the stoppage for two
days of?this,? ( holding up the flask). It is something, at least,
to know that a delusion is a delusion. I shouldn?t wonder now
if I began to see things as well as hear them. {Turns round and
catches a view of the troupe of girls , who have suddenly assumed
statuesque attitudes. Re is astounded. Turns again towards
audience). By Jove, I?ve got ?em bad this time, and no mistake!
? ? ? {ln a hoarse whisper?and puzzled). But they used to
be snaky, ratty, beetly, alligatory! . . . This {looking at
them with the tail of his eye) is simply goluptious ! Now, if I
could only ensure a constant repetition of these same symptoms,
I d contrive to be always two days without a drop. {Catches
sight of the eatables). Ha ! Here is the very latest thing out
in the way of a mirage ! ( Sits down and shuts his eyes). Go
way! You don?t fool me! You don?t fool me! (The ladies
hurst out laughing. Dr. Jack raises his head and looks round.)
I don?t believe it ; but, in the interests of science, I?ll just see
how far this delusion can go.
(Goes up to Pan and kisses her.)
Fan (putting her arms affectionately round his neck). How
dare you, Sir! You just try that on again !
Dr. Jack (starting hack a few paces). By heaven' This
is no delusion ! That?s?a? true? woman ! {Re rushes at the
crowd with open arms. They run of the stage. Dr. Jack is
arrested in his pursuit of them by the sight of the eatables.)
then by jabers, the victuals may be real, too.' (Seizes the leg
of a fowl, and begins to devour if, with a sound of a dog ivorruina
and growling). J
Enter Tom with the champagne.
Tom. Dr. Jack ! by all that?s lucky.
Dr. Jack. Tom Trueman! And champagne! . . . Don?t
squeeze my hand so hard, old friend, or you mav perhaps wake
me from this heavenly dream.
Tom {helping him to champagne). Why, what?s the matter
with you ?
Dr. Jack {eating and drinking). Bound for Toolooraloo?
lost?bush?d?run dry?two days
Tom. Then, you couldn t have dropped on a healthier spot.
W i? are bound for the same diggings, my boy; and, what?s more,
you?re the very man we want.


Dr. .Tack. But, Tom, tell me (in a tone of awe), know you
aught of certain glorious beings, half angel, half woman, that
haunt these premises ? I have been so bewitched that I shouldn?t
he surprised (feeling his head and face ) to find myself wearing
the head of an ass.
Tom. Why, man, that?s my troupe ! Fortune, you know, has
thrown her golden arms around me, and is holding me with such
a grip that, do as I like, I can?t shake her off. Now, I?ve been
throwing away money among the townsfolk?and, oh, hadn?t we
a time of it, doctor! ?till I?ve lost the taste for astonishing them.
I wan?t a new sensation. I want to astonish my old mates.
Lord, won?t they stare when they see Tom Trueman come back
with a whole circus at his heels! I think I just see Spotty, and
Scotty, and Tinker Tim, and the Badger, and Streaky Jim, and
Yankee Bill, and Dusty Bob, and the whole blessed lot of poor
devils who have never had a stroke of luck ; I think I just see
them when we sail in, in full fig, and pass the word round for free
seats for a fortnight!
Doctor. D?ye mean to say you?ve hired a circus ?
Tom. Well ?circus ?-variety company ?opera troupe ?corps
de hallet ?whatever you like to call it.
Doctor. But have you no men?
Tom. Oh, lots of men. But its my will they keep apart as
much as possible. Men are very good things as far as they?re
needful, but it interferes with my sense of possession to have
them sneaking about ray girls. But, enough of explanation.
Have you done ?
Doctor. For the present.
Tom. Well, to business. I told you, you are the very man I
want. My girls are very delicate Travel with us. Five
guineas a day, and all your ex?s. Is it a bargain ?
Doctor. It is?( aside ) if it?s not a dream.
Choral singing of men's and women's voices heard otitside.
? Here's a health to all good lasses, <Sfc."
Tom. Now, just look there! I?m blest if the whole crew
haven?t been and broached the cargo ! Here they come, both
male and female.
Enter chorus of mem and women. The women attired as before,
the men in all sorts of picturesque dresses. They carry
champagne bottles and glasses and continue singing ?? Here's
a health, Sfcf
Tom. Stay! This is rank mutiny. But never mind. It?s
only a guinea a bottle, and if it makes you feel better, it makes
me happy ? so happy that I feel as if I could make a song for
you myself, only I?d be sure to come to grief over the rhymes.


Various Voices. Oh, do sing Tom. You haven?t given us a
song since we started.
Fast. And I?ll come to the rescue with the rhymes
Tom. You will, duck ? Then, here goes.
SOLO. ? Tom.
{At the third line of each stanza, Tom makes a gesture of appeal
to Pan to supply a rhyme .)
Champagne?s the divinest of liquor,
It flies to your heart like a bird.
Through your veins it goes shooting like
Pan {sung) . Ichor P
Tom. Yes, ichor?s exactly the word.
Por ichor, although I don?t know what it is,
Precisely expresses the nature of Pizz.
Chorus. Por ichor, although we don?t know, Ac.
{Sung dancing.)
Tom. Champagne makes you valiant as Hector,
As Hercules sturdy and firm ;
Besides, it?s as pleasant as- -
Pan. Nectar ?
Tom. Yes, nectar?s exactly the term.
Por nectar, although I don?t know what it is,
Precisely expresses the sweetness of Pizz.
Chorus. Por nectar, although we don?t know, Ac.
(Sung dancing.)
Tom. On champagne you will never get sick, Sir,
Bed Bouzy or white sill-er-ee.
Champagne is the real
Pan. Elixir ?
Tom. Elixir?s the word to aT.
Por elixir, although I don?t know what it is,
Precisely expresses the virtue of Fizz.
Chorus. For elixir, although we don?t know, Ac.
{Sung dancing.)
Tom. But, ladies, I forgot to tell you. This is Doctor Jack.
I have engaged Doctor Jack as our physician : repairs executed
with neatness and despatch; so be sure and give him plenty of
custom.
Various Ladies ( simultaneously ). Oh, is he to be our
doctor!


(The ladies crowding him , and speaking all at once.)
Oh, Doctor, I?ve got such a dreadful, terrible, frightful, awful ?
Oh, Doctor, I?ve got such a terrible, frightful, awful, dreadful?
Oh, Doctor, I?ve got such a frightful, awful, dreadful, terrible ?
Oh, Doctor, I?ve got such an awful, dreadful, terrible, frightful?
Dr. Jack {gesticulating as if overpowered with the noise),
Hold hard! Belay! Ease her! Stop her ! One at a time,
ladies! One at a time ! . . . Now, for instance, what?s the
matter with you ?
Fax. Oh, please, when I sleep with my head to the North I
get nightmare.
Dr. Jack. Well, then, sleep with your head to the South.
Fax. I?ve tried it, but the effect is just the same.
Dr. Jack. East?
Fax. Same result.
Dr. Jack. West?
Fax. Same, same.
Dr. Jack. East an? by South half South ?
Faist. Not a hit of difference. Nightmare all round the
compass.
Dr. Jack. What do you take for supper ?
Fax. Whatever I can get.
Dr. Jack. And how much ?
Fax. Just as much as ever I can get.
Dr. Jack. After this, take only a dry biscuit and glass of
water.
Fax. A dry bisc? ! {Aside) Oh, I rather have the night-
mare ! (to Doctor.) But you haven?t told me about my head ?
Dr Jack. Ah ?well ? {aside) Bother the girl! {to Fax.)
Always sleep with your head to the wind.
Fax. Oh, thank you! What a privilege to meet a real man
of science!
Dr. Jack. Now then ; what?s your complaint?
Loo. Oh, Doctor, when Ido this (making a ivild and grotesque
contortion with her arms and limbs ) ?and then that {making
another ) ?and then this {making another ), I get?oh such pins
and needles just here! {Taking her foot in her hand and
pointing to the sole of it)
Dr. Jack. Then don?t do it.
Loo. Is that all? No operation?
{The Doctor shakes his head)


Loo. Oh, thank you. I was ? so afraid.
Dr. Jack. And what?s your case, Miss ?
Another Lada. I?ve ?I've lost my appetite.
Dr. Jack. Oh Lord, that?s bad . . . ( to Tom ) Look
here, Tom. Live guineas a day won?t pay me for such a draw
upon my skill as all this !
Tom. Well, say ten guineas. It?s worth it, if only to get rid
of a share of the responsibility. Fancy wdiat a ten days of it I?ve
had, working my way thi?ough the Bush with twenty girls, and
all of them delicate. I told you they were delicate, didn?t I ?
Dr. Jack. Well, I must say, for fairies ?
CHORUS OF LADIES.
But, Sir, we are not fairies other than in looks.
We?re not the sort of fairies that you read about in books,
Who recked not of powder or potion or pill ??
For they never were ill ?they never were ill.
Tutti. They reck?d not of powder, &c.
Tom. And now, having treated you to champagne and pre-
sented you with a doctor, I think I am entitled to ask for my
post-prandial ?what was it you called it, Dame Davies ?
Dame Davies. Terpsichorean ?and, let us say ?Euterpian,
divertissement.
Fan. But we can do nothing without Lil, and Tessy. These
two mooneys went off fern-hunting in the middle of dinner,
leaving their wings behind them.
Tom. Then, run off, all of you, and find them. But don?t go
far, and if any of you get out of your reckoning ?what was it I
taught you ?
All. Coo-00-00-ey.
(Catch consisting of coo-eys and answering coo-eys. Chorus go
off singing the end of it.)
Tom. Here, doctor. You and I may as well clear the decks
for action.
(They pass off the dinner apparatus to side wings , assisted hy
some of the men , who then retire. As the last of the Chorus
disappear , Lil?s and Tessa?s voices are heard singing as
they approach.)
Tom. Ah! The girls have just missed them. But never
mind ; their voices will soon bring the pursuers back.
Enter Lil and Tessa, their arms filled with ferns and flowers.
Attired like the other ladies of the troupe.
Lil. ( recitative ). Australia! Beautiful Australia !


Is this the land
Which men reviled
As desert wild,
Fit but for those whom law hath bann?d ?
Oh lovely land,
With beauties throng?d
Eeport hath wronged
Thee, fairest work of Nature?s hand.
(Spoken.)
A land of beauty!? By a rustic bridge,
Formed by a fallen trunk, we reached a shrine,
Whose pillars were of brown-stemm?d fern, whose roof
Was delicate tracery of fronds, whose spires
Were soaring eucalypts clad from slenderest branch
To lowest bole in garb of silvery white.
Here pink-veined orchids bloomed ; in every nook
Sweet violets nestled; through the shafts of fern
A runlet crimsoned in the sunset glow,
Edged with luxuriant growth of maiden hair,
By willow-leaved acacias overhung ;
While through the feathery green that fringed the bank
The wild lobelia pushed her purple flowers,
Sister?d by many a yellow starry bloom,
And graceful things with spike or panicle
Chalice or bell, to us all rare and strange.
There sat we down, and found it facile task
To make believe we were in fairy-land,
Our fairy garb subservient to our mood ;
And through a heavenly hour we dreamed and dreamed,
Until
Tessy. Until we could stand the mosquitos no longer.
Lil. Oh, you! In Fairy-land, you would be sister to
Mustard-seed.
Tom {aside to the Doctor and nudging him). Now, you
wouldn?t believe, to hear her spouting about flowers and things,
that she?s the wildest devil of the lot; always up to some trick
or other. And she has got no heart. 1 ought to know, for I?ve
tried hard to get hold of it. But there was nothing to get hold
of, Doctor! Ladies, let me introduce you to our private physician,
Dr. Jack Nugent.
{They how , and for the first time Tessy and the Doctor look
each other full in the face. Each starts hack.)
Tessy {aside). My deserted husband ! {Pulls down her hair.)
But he will never recognise me in this array.


Du. Jack ( aside ). JVTy deserted wife ! But she will never
recognise me with this manly beard. . . . Besides that is
not my real name.
Lil. A doctor? Well, I am never ill. But, let me see;
doctors are supposed to be botanists. Tell me, what tree bears
this dark-hued leaf? ( Handing him a leafy twiy.)
De. Jack. This? Oh, this is Kurrajong.
Lil. ( pronouncing it as harshly as possible ). Kurrajong.
Kurrajong. What a sweet name !' . . . And this ??a palm
evidently ?
Dh. Jack. Buddawong.
Lil. Buddawong. Kurrajong. Does everything end in ony
in this country ?
Dr. Jack. Well, the range over there is the Dandenoug;
and, over there, the Buninyong; and I was once nearly drowned
in the Currawong.
Lil. Tom Trueman, how beautifully these names lend them-
selves to song.
Tom. As how ?
Lil. As thus
In this fair land where beauties throng,
The names adapt themselves to song,
Kor the simple reason that they end in -ony.
And that is how,
As I said just now,
They lend themselves to song.
Buddawong, Kurrajong,
Buninyong, Dandeiiong,
Currawong, you can?t go wrong
In adapting them to song.
Quartette.
Buddawong, Kurrajong,
Buninyong, Dandenong,
Currawong, you can?t go wrong
In adapting them to song.
Lil {solo) :
In this fair land the minstrel throng
Can?t help but swimmingly get along,
For you just call everything something-owy,
And, right as a trivet,
The name you give it
Adapts itself to song.
Buddawong, Kurrajong, Ac.
Quartette. Buddawong, Kurrajong, Ac.

Tesst. )
Enter full Chorus.
Tan. Whither, whither, Fairy Queen,
Have you been a-roaming ?
Heav?ns, you might have murdered been ?
Murdered in the gloaming.
Lil. In a fairy dell serene
We have been a-roaming.
How should we have murdered been ?
Murdered in the gloaming ?
Loo. What! Have you not heard, oh Queen,
Of the many dangers
That within this dread demesne
Lie in wait for strangers ?
Tesst. Nothing have we heard or seen
In the way of dangers.
In the forest we have been
Unmolested rangers.
Tan. These our friends have told us ( pointing to the men.)
The perils that enfold us ;
Harken to a little list
Of the dangers you have missed.
(At the recital of each new danger in the folloiving song, the men
of the Chorus nudge each other and exhibit signs of suppressed
laughter , as if gratified at their success in ? stuffing the
girls.)
Fan. In the bracken the brigalow spreads his lair,
And the stealthy corrobboree crouches there.
Loo. And the venomous jumbuck crawls along
In the wake of the loathly billabong.
Fan. The boomerang hides in each hollow tree,
With his ponderous jaws agape !
Lil. and Tesst (with gestures of alarm) :
Oh, girls! how thankful we should be
For such a narrow escape !
Choeus. Oh yes, how thankful they should be
For such a narrow escape ?
For such a narrow, such a narrow, such a narrow escape!


Loo. The heelaman roams at eventide
With the dreadful yarraman by his side.
Pan. The cooliman waits at the bunya roots
To plunge his fangs in the stranger?s boots
Loo. The warrigal in the she-oak tree
Uproars his fearful shape !
Lil. and Tessy (as before) :
Enough ! How thankful we should be
Por such a narrow escape !
Chorus. Oh yes, how thankful they should be
For such a narrow escape?
Por such a narrow, such a narrow, such a narrow escape!
Tom. So you fellows have been stuffing these poor girls again,
eh ? But, enough I should like to know when this?this?
terpsivertissement is going to begin. Say, what is it to be ?
Dame Davies. Shall we say, ? Payette, or the Fairy Bride ??
With Lil as Bride and Fairy Queen. Excellent. But,
stay. The poor fellow who did the Bridegroom?we left him sick
in Melbourne.
Liu-. a we dding the part of the Bridegroom is quite
insignificant, and should need no preparation. But see ! What
is that tottering object on yonder ridge ? It?s a man, I declare !
(They all 100k ?Tom through a field-glass which he hands to the
Doctor.)
Doctor. Why, that?s my mate, Unlucky Joe! We both got
lost two days ago, and somehow managed to separate.
Tom. Unlucky Joe! I?ve heard of him. Why, that?s the
poor brokendown swell that used to carry a looking-glass in his
swag. He has worked at every diggings in the colony, and never
had a stroke of luck?never even found the colour. Well, poor
devil, we?ll give him a rattling night for once. Give him a coo-ey,
boys.
Lil. Stay. I have a plan.
Tom. Some more of your tricks, eh P
Lil. Just so. Now, mark. We?ll be real fairies to him.
We 11 have the ? Fairy Wedding,? and he?ll be the Bridegroom.
I?m going to marry Unlucky Joe.
Tom. But he doesn?t know his part!
Lil. If he?s a man at all, he can be a bridegroom at a
moment s notice. Come all away. Leave the details to me.
Doctor, we shall want a chaplain. I?ll change you so that your
own mate won?t know you. Tessy, bring two bottles of cham-
pagne, and leave them where my Joe will be sure to see them.
[Exit Tessy.


Doctor {aside). Lucky Joe !
Lil. We must let him prime himself up to delusion pitch.
Away ! [ Exeunt all except the Doctor.
Doctor {{ivho has repeatedly during the previous colloquy
been eyeing Tessy with admiration). Hood Lord, Ido believe
I?ve fallen in love again with that wife of mine ! Why, she?s
lovelier than ever! And in that dress absolutely irresistible.
Let me see. I?ve ten guineas a day. I don?t know how long it
is to continue, but while it lasts, hang it, it?s enough for two.
Perhaps her temper has improved, and we might manage to get
along for a week or two.
Enter Tessy with the champagne , which she deposits on a fallen
trunk. Starts on seeing the Doctor, and makes as if to
retire.
Doctor. Tessy! Don?t go. Your penitent husband im-
plores your pardon. Tessy, dear, it was poverty did it. Now I
have ample means of support.
Tessy. Oh, for the matter of that, so have I.
Doctor. Where ?
Tessy {exhibiting her legs). Here. Ain?t they ample enough
Doctor. And how have these supported you ?
Tessy {exhibiting some wild dancing , ending with a can-can
step) . That way.
Doctor {aside). She?s positively enthralling!? {approaching
her). Tessy, Tessy ! my own deserted wife
Tessy. I?m not your deserted wife!
Doctor. How that ?
Tessy. It was I deserted you.
Doctor {hotly). It wasn?t.
{Getting more and more vehement as they proceed.)
Tessy. It was ! Exactly this day three years ago I left a
note for you on the front parlour table, and went out at the back
door ?so it was I deserted you !
Doctor. Exactly this day three years ago I left a note for
you on the back parlour table, and went out at the front door ?
so it was I deserted you !
Tessy. But I did it quite early in the day. It was only seven
by the front parlour clock when I left the letter. So there!
Doctor. And it was five minutes to seven by the back
parlour clock when I left my letter. So there!
Tessy. But the back parlour clock was always kept a quarter
slow. So there!


Doctor. I tell you
Tessy. No, you don?t!
Doctor. Ido !
Tessy. You don?t!
Doctor. Why, hang it, you?re as peppery as ever!
DUO.
Tessy. ?Twas ever thus. ?Twould be always so.
If I say yes , then you say No.
You're always right, and /?m always wrong ?
And so we go over the same old song.
Both. Same old song, same old song,
And so we go over the same old song.
Doctor. The case is exactly the oppose,
I'm always wrong, and you're always right.
If I say white, then you say black?
And so we go over the same old track.
Both. Same old track, same old track,
And so we go over the same old track.
Tessy. Those words of yours yourself convict,
Bor, to prove that you never contradict,
What I say is, you say is not ?
And so we come back to the same old spot.
Both. Same old spot, same old spot.
And so we come back to the same old spot.
Tessy. And the sooner the better we leave the spot!
\JExeunt , snapping fingers at each, other
Enter Uklucky Joe.
RECITATIVE.
Here lies, unhonoured with a tomb,
One whom Fortune never smiled on, ?
Here lies a luckless digger, whom
Waggon-loads of woes were piled on.
Sing it soft and low ?
Poor unlucky Joe.
That?s my epitaph. I shall want it in a few hours more, I
expect. I can manage to do without a coffin. I can cheerfully
dispense with a hearse. I positively prefer camping outside to
being cabin?d in a stuffy grave. But, an epitaph?hang it, I
cannot reconcile myself to being done out of an epitaph. So I?ve
scratched mine on the bottom of my pannikin, and I?ll just fix
it up here, for I don?t see the use of going a step farther. As far
as I can see, this looks a tidy sort of place to die in. (Unfastens


the sxcaq and feels about in it.) Where the devil did I put that
pannikin ! But perhaps I had better not take that gentleman?s
name in vain under the present circumstances. (Still searching
in the swag.) And yet I don?t feel so moribund as I might
have expected. It?s astonishing how the faculty of rhyming
keeps a man alive in the Bush. 1 suppose I?m the first man that
ever kept up his strength and his spirits in the Australian Bush
by composing his own epitaph as he jogged along, and scratching
it on a tin pannikin. Now, there?s that disreputable broken-
down Bush Doctor. By this time, he?s either dead or delirious,
and all because he kept constantly thinking of his stomach,
instead of, like me, keeping his spiritual faculties in exercise.
(Doctor appears at side, and puts his thumb to his nose)
Here?s my tooth-brush. Well, I won?t need that any longer, but
I think I must manage to expire with it in my mouth, to let them
see that to the last I kept up the habits of a gentleman
And here?s my hand-glass. Good. I should like to have a last
look at myself, just to see if in this final extremity, I can trace
any resemblance to Joe Stanmore of Pembroke. Ah those good
old ?delightfully bad old ?days of Cambridge 1 Heigho ! (Strikes
a match , and looks in the glass. As he does so, Lil comes quickly
behind him, looks over his shoulder, and then glides rapidly away.
He sees her face in the glass, drops the glass, and starts to his
feet). Angels and ministers of grace! (He looks allround).
I saw ?or did?nt see ?or thought 1 saw ?am I so near my end
that my spiritual vision can already see angels? faces ? Or is this
enchanted ground? Why not? This is a new land, and there
may be more in it than is dreamt of in our philosophy. ( Sitting ?
down.) Now, suppose this were indeed Dairy Land, and one of
the good people, after their custom elsewhere, offered me Three
Wishes. Let me see, what would I ask ? Not a yard of black
pudding, certainly. lam past hunger, and though I have a
thirst on me that under other circumstances would be worth
fifty dollars, I have already drunk more water than is good for
a dying man. (Thinks a moment o> two.) Aes; that?s it. I
would say ?wish the first?a couple of bottles of champagne!
(As he pronounces the word , his foot strikes against one of the
bottles of champagne. He hears the click, exhibits signs of
amazement, stoops down, seizes a bottle, snatches his pannikin from
the swag, knocks the neck off the bottle and drinks from the
pannikin. Similar action with second bottle).
SOLO.? Joe.
If this it is to dream,
How sweeter far
Are things that only seem
Than things that are!
No earthly vintage e?er infused such bliss
As this ! ?as this!


What thrills of joy supreme
These draughts convey!
If this it is to dream,
I?d dream for aye!
For ever care and sorrow I?d dismiss
With this !- ?with this !
Well, I?m ready to believe anything now. What shall I wish
for next? Shall Ibe like the sailor? ?More ?baccy?? No.
My head swims already. I see all things through a quivering,
glamorous haze. Another drop would knock me over. Besides,
other desires inspire me. I wish ?I wish to see that face again !
(Looks in the glass. Li L. shows herself again, as before , in the
glass for an instant. Joe wheels round, hut she is gone. Joe
goes through manifestations of amazed bewilderment .)
SOLO. ? Joe.
Dream yet, my heart! Dream on !
Sweet vision, stay!
Alas, the dream is gone !
In vain I pray.
Mine only now to leave one cold, sad kiss
[Kissing the mirror) On this ?on this! ( Kissing it again.)
At each kiss looks at the mirror as if trying by the kiss to conjure
hack her face. Shakes his head sadly when he finds it
ineffectual.
But what a muddy-pated fool lam ! Why kiss this cold and
unresponsive surface? Have I not a third wish left! Yes!
(i vehemently ) and if it is the last chance of satisfied desire ever to
be granted me, here or hereafter, 1 wish ?I wish ?to kiss her!
[ln an instant Lil is in front of him , with inviting gesture.
With a cry of mingled joy and surprise, he clasps her in his
arms and rapturously kisses her. At this moment the whole
Company of players, men and women , some carrying lights ,
rush on to the stage. Joe is seized. Lil/Ucs off screaming.)
FINALE.
Fairies, &c., singing ensemble.
Seize him, Fairies ! Goblins, tackle him !
Hold him ! Bind him ! Fetter him ! Shackle him!
Our law still is, as it ever hath been, [ They bind him with
Death to the mortal who kisses our Queen! chains of
To the mortal who kisses our Fairy Queen ! flowers).


Dame Dayies. .Ah yes, ?tis death,
So our law saith.
Yet be not rash. Was it a re'll kiss ?
I?ve known men make a shot at it ?and miss ! (contemptuous!!/ .)
Dan. ?Twas a perfect kiss.
?Twas just like this ! (Embraces and kisses
Unlucky Joe.)
Tessy. Oh, no ! ?Twas more like this
(Make way for the witness, please)
(To Fan, and pushing her away from Unlucky Joe)
It wasn?t a single kiss,
But a rapid se-ri-os, ?
Like this ! (Kissing Joe over and over
again, rapidly and loudly.)
Chorus. ?Twas a rapid se-ri-es
Like this {kiss, kiss ) ?like this (kiss, kiss)
In rapid se-ri-<?s.
Dame Dayies. They have proved their story true.
They have proved it with demonstration.
There?s no longer a doubt of the fact
- That the act
Was a genuine osculation.
Chorus. A r es, they?ve proved their story true, &c., &c.
Dame Dayies. Prepare thou, then, to meet thy doom.
Poor Joe ! ? Unhonoured with a tomb,?
(Joe starts at hearing his name mentioned, and his own ivords
quoted.)
Thy flesh the dingoes shall consume.
Who?ll catch his blood ? (Poising a llack-
fellow's spear.)
p AN> I, madam, I!
I?ll catch his blood and ?see ?him?die.
Chorus. She?ll- ?see ?him die.
Dame Dayies. Who?ll dig his grave ?
Tessy. That job I crave.
I?ll ?dig?his ?grave.
Chorus. She?ll?dig?his grave.
Dame Dayies. Who?ll sing his dirge ?
Joe. M y claim 1 ur S e -
I?ll ?sing?my?dirge.
Chorus. He?ll?sing?his?dirge.


Fan.
She can?t refuse you !
Tesst.
She?s bound to choose you !
Fan.
It?s according to the rule ?
Tessy.
And, besides, she?d be a fool
Such a handsome man to refuse.
Chorus.
She?d be a little fool
Such a handsome man to refuse.
Dame Davies. But there?s a vow
You first must take.
Swear, swear it now,
For her sweet sake, ?
Never again, while life cloth hold,
To speak to woman of mortal mould !
Chorus.
Do you swear it?
Joe. And I?ll
(Sung to the same ? Sing it soft and low,
air as before ) Poor unlucky Joe ! ?
Choeus. ? Sing it soft and low,
Poor unlucky Joe !?
Dame Davis. Yet, stay; there?s an
Al-ter-na-tive,
On which this man
May list to live.
Por if he choose
Our Queen to wed
The first offence
Is con-do-ned!
Choeus.
Then, mortal, choose!
Oh, don?t refuse,
In the name of common sense,
To condone the first offence !
Say, which, oh which, do you choose ?
Joe ( aside ). Oh, how should I
Aspire so high !
(To fairy audience i) I?ll be only too delighted
To your sov?reign to be plighted,
If she's as willing as I.
Joe. Never again, while life doth hold,
Shall I speak to woman of mortal mould !
I swear it!


Just as he is about to repeat ? I swear it 'Tesst AoZA up her foot
in front of him. Fan takes hold o/Tess\ s fool, produces a
match , and lights it hg drawing it across the sole of Tesst 8
boot. She holds the lighted match up before Job s face. Joe
looks, or acts , an interrogation as to what he is to do. Fan
blows with her mouth to show him. Joe then blows out the
lighted match , repeating
I swear it!
Chorus. He swears it!
Mrs. Davies. But, see ! Here comes the Bride!

Fairies.)
Chorus. Comes the Bride! Comes the Bride! Comes the
Bride!
Soon will the happy knot be tied
See the Bride! See the Bride! See the Bride!
May ev?ry joy our Queen betide !
Happy Bride! Happy Bride! Happy Bride.
Place the Bridegroom by her side !

(Enter Dr. Jack at the end of the attendant tram in a costume
made up partly of wizard's robes and part of clerical canoni-
cals Large book in his hand. Takes up proper position.)
Dr. Jack. You take this Fay to he your lady true ?

END OE ACT I.


ACT 11.
Scene. ? The Lazarus Claim on the Midas Diggings. Open
tents in the background. Chorus of Diggers. A windlass
over a shaft is being turned as theg sing.
First Digger. Lazarus lay at the rich man?s gate ?
Chorus of Diggers. Poor old Lazarus !
Poor old Lazarus !
First Digger. Sick and sore and desolate.
Chorus. Poor old Lazan
Poor old Lazarus!
First Digger. He lived on the crumbs that Dives dropped,
Chorus. Poor old Lazurus !
First Digger. But now these two have places swopped.
Chorus. Good for Lazarus !
Good for Lazarus !
First Digger. Lazarus fed on Dives? crumbs.
Chorus. Poor old Lazarus
Poor old Lazarus!
First Digger. Now Dives? wealth from Lazarus comes!
Chorus. Gold-en Lazarus!
Gold-en Lazarus !
Second Digger. Of finest linen was Dives? shirt, ?
Chorus. Poor old Lazarus !
Poor old Lazarus !
Second Digger. While Lazarus lay in rags and dirt.
Chorus. Poor old Lazarus !
Poor old Lazarus !
Second Digger. On Lazarus Dives looked with scorn, ?
Chorus. Poor old Lazarus !
Poor old Lazarus!
Second Digger. And wondered why such a wretch was born.
Chorus. Poor old Lazarus!
Second Digger. But he doesn?t despise him any more, ?
Chorus. Good old Lazarus !
Good old Lazarus!
Second Digger. For the dirt turns out to be precious ore.
Chorus. Gold-en Lazarus!
As the loop of the rope reaches the level of the stage, a digger
steps out, who is seen to be the rich Tom Trueman of the First
Act , now reduced to the condition of a working miner.
Tom. Ay, boys ; Lazarus is running an ounce to the bucket.


First Digger. Ah, Tom, when you named this claim ? Lazarus,?
you little knew what a fortune was in it! Don?t you repent now
of having sold your chance ?
Tom. Not a bit of it, man. Not a bit of it. If we diggers
are down to-day, we?re up to-morrow. Look at old Ned, there !
Are you sorry now, Ned, that you lined every inch of your bed-
room at Melbourne with plate-glass mirrors, and then made
targets of them ? eh ?
Second Digger. No, mate. There?s more pleasure now in
thinkin? as it was I as done it, than there was in jinglin? the coins
an? cussin? myself for not knowin? what to do with them. I gave
twenty pound to the man as put me on t > that mirror lay.
Tom. Ha! That?s the right sort of spirit, hoys !
SOLO.?Tom.
We are spendthrift prodigals every one, ?
But, mates, when all is said and done,
Change is the very essence of fun
To him who life enjoys.
Though now we are only wages-men,
We have been rich, we?ll be rich again,
So we?ll work, and work with a will till then?
(Vehemently) Wire in at the cross-cut, boys!
Chorus. Though now we are only, &c., &c.
(At the end of the chorus the diggers go through the pantomime of
using their picks to pick down earth jrom overhead, as if
from the roof of a cross-cut drive.)
Tom. Hurrah for tucker and weekly pay !
It?s our happy-go-lucky digger way
That him who was Master yesterday
To-day a Boss employs.-
To-day our gullets the washdirt coats,
To-morrow with hock we?ll drench our throats,
And light our cigars with five-pound notes ?
(A pause , as if of ecstatic anticipation. Then, abruptly)
Wire in at the cross-cut, boys !
Chorus. To-day our gullets, &c., &c.
(After the word ? notes ,? same business as Tom?s )
Tom (as if suddenly struck with an additional line that he had
forgotten. Sung slowly and with sly expression)
And sail?alongside?of the?pet-ti-coats !
Chorus. , A-a-ah!
(Vigorously.) Wire in at the cross-cut, boys !


First Digger. Well, if anyone wants to learn that riches
ain?t happiness, he has only to look at the Boss Owner of this
claim ?Lucky Joe. A. year ago, when he was C/nlucky Joe, he
was the merriest hoy out. Now he?s the richest man in Australia,
and the most miserable beggar in it all. And such a good sort
he is, too !
Second Digger. I come across ?im to-day again?moonin? by
hisself ?as usual. Was talkin? to hisself about his lost Bride.
Said she wur a Fairy. Ha ! ha! ha !
First Digger. Poor devil! Could buy up the whole female
sex it he liked, and yet I?m told he won?t even speak to a woman.
Wish I had the chance. Barrin? old Mother Patchett up at the
groggery there, I haven?t seen a woman for six months.
Second Digger. I say, what the devil is the truth about the
Boss and his girl?
First Digger. Oh, ask Tom. He knows something about it -
Tom (troubled). He?s ?he?s mad. Ask the Doctor, there.
(Doctor enter <jes from a tent , dressed as n cook. A saucepan in
his hand.)
Doctor (angrily). Who wants me! Ain?t it enough that an
M. D., of Trinity College, Dublin, is reduced to cooking for a lot
of sons of b-Belial like you, but you must make use of me as an
Inquire Within on every blessed occasion! . . . Mow, look here!
How can an M.A., or any other man, fry a steak in a thing like
that? (Holding up an old saucepan with a hole in it.) Giet me
a new saucepan, d?ye hear, you profligate crew, or I?ll never more
be officer of yours !
Tom (taking him to the front of the stage). Doc., its been
long on my mind about that stuff you gave Stanmore to drink.
On honour, was it all square, now ?
Doctor. So help me, man, it was the most innocent thing in
the Pharmacopoeia! It wasn?t even strong enough. It should
have given him eight hours sleep, but when I went back at sun-
rise next morning to the place where we left him, he was gone.
Next time I met him, months after, he was as mad as a hatter?
on the one point.
Tom. Do you think he?ll ever get better, Doc. ?
Doctor. I doubt it. Fixed idea, you know. Like yourself,
I have tried often to explain the hoax to him, but either, as in
your case, he won?t listen, or else, when he hears me out, he forks
out a couple of sovereigns, and thanks me with an air of touching
gratitude that?s enough to make a fellow squat down and blubber.
Tom. What does he mean by that ?
Doctor. Why, he thinks I?m concocting a story, in my
medical capacity, out of pity for him, so as to cheat him out of


a real bereavement Now. I wouldn?t mind living on him by
borrowing and not [laying. I'hat s all fair and square. But, sir,
I?m a professional man, and hang me, sir, if I can take a fee on
false pretences !
Tom. Why don't you borrow from him then, instead of cook-
ing for us ?
Doctor. Borrow! He doesn?t give me the time! As soon
as I show signs now of speaking to him, he outs with the fee at
once, before I get the chance to open my mouth. Now, sir,
since I can?t take the money as a fee, and as it ain?t square
borrowing to take without asking?why, sir, between these two
principles I?ve got to do without! And that s why Xv e got to
cook, sir, for a demoralized mob of ?But, by the holy saucepan,
here comes the very man himself ! . . . Poor beggar! . . .
Poor beggar! . .? . Dreaming ?dreaming. Damn that little
circus girl!
(Enter Joe, handsomely dressed in riding costume. Walks slowly
and dr earn Hi) across the stage , and hack to middle front. JLs
he approaches , the others retire into the background.)
Joe (soliloquizing) And yet they tell me she is not?that it
was an illusion .' . . Ah, if they only knew! When her
unseen presence walks beside me, it is they who are the shadows
An illusion! She is with me morn, noon and night!
The dawning speaks of her. The noon is full of her. The
midnight ip fraught with her.
SOLO. ? Joe.
Whv doth the dawning speak of herP
What kindred hath she with the morn ?
Why should my wak?hing thoughts transfer
To her the glow in Orient born P
1 only know that wheresoe?er
Awaketh Beauty, she is there.
Why is the noontide full of her P
What kindred hath she with the sun P
Why should the whole world?s minister
Be eloquent alone of one ?
I only know that wheresoe?er
Exulteth Beauty, she is there.
Why is the midnight fraught with her P
What kindred hath she with the night ?
Oh, dreams that are of things that were,
Ye change my darkness into light!
I know, I know that wheresoe?er
Eeposeth Beauty, she is there.


Joe (? ?producing Jus little handglass from his breast , and gazing
wistfully into it). Ah, yet, however sweet the abiding sense of
her presence, what would I not give for one moment of sight, of
touch, of hearing! Oh, if intensity of longing had power to
conjure her across the boundary of sense, surely she would be
incarnate before me now . . . Payette! Payette! Payette!
No. Nothing . . . Yet these eyes beheld her.
These arms embraced her. Into my ear she whispered her name.
Payette . . . (. Abruptly , suddenly ?perceiving the men , ivho
have been gradually closing up to him.) Ha! boys! How?s
Lazarus ?
Dr. Jack. Oh, Lazarus be ?bosom?d. ( Stretching out his
hands appealingly to Joe, sings)
Once more, ?twas all a plant?
Chorus. A plant, a plant!
Dr. Jack. A most extravagant
Chorus. -v
-vagant, -vagant
Dr. Jack. Praud, flim-flam, flummery.
Once more, ?twas just a skin,
Chorus. A skin, a skin.
Dr. Jack. A regular take-in,
Chorus. Take-in, take-in.
Dr. Jack. Stage-rant and mummery.
Payette was only Lil?
Chorus. Was only Lil?
Dr. Jack. And she?s a bitter pill?
Chorus. A bitte
A bitter pill?
Dr. Jack. I do assure you, sir.
Here?s one that knew her well,
(Putting his hand on Tom?s shoulder)
Chorus. That knew her well,
Dr. Jack. Who, if he chose, could tell,
Chorus. Could tell, could tell
Dr. Jack. What soon would cure you, sir.
Joe (aside). What good fellows these are! To beguile me
of my sense of bereavement, they will even stoop to falsehood
... {Turning to the men). Tom, at the end of the week,
give a double wage to your working mates, not forgetting
yourself.
Diggers. Hurrah for the Boss !


Joe. And give the Doctor
Dr. Jack {aside). Oh, hang it all, I can?t take anything from
him in my medical capacity. Why the devil can?t he remember
I?m a cook!
Joe {aside). Now I come to think of it, there was an insinu-
ation in the Doctor?s last remonstrance that was not altogether
seemly . . . Tom, give the Doctor ?no, I mean the cook ?
the cook
Dr. Jack {aside). Ah, by tripe, the cook's open to a tip !
Joe. (rive the cook ... a new saucepan.
[Exit Joe.
Enter Fan with a rush, in riding costume , pursued by two actors
of the Variety Company , also in riding costume.
Fan. Save me ! Save me !
The Diggers rush forward , seize the men , and begin to handle
them roughly.
Fan. Oh, don?t ?don?t hurt them ! I didn?t mean them?
not to catch me, you know !
[.Exeunt the two actors.
Tom and Doctor. Why, it?s Fan! ?Wherever have you
dropped from ??Where?s Lil ? ?Where?s Tessy ?
Fan. Oh, we?re all here ?just arrived. We?re on a playing
tour ?turned in here on our way to Tickarooka. Lil? Oh,
Lil?s gone melancholy mad. Can take her parts all right, hut
away from business is quite off her head. Does nothing but
mourn for her Unlucky Joe. I wish to goodness we could find
that Joe of hers, but as we never heard his name, we couldn?t
even inquire. . . . But what ever is the matter with the
men ?
During her remarks the Diggers have been draiving nearer and
nearer to her , with manifest signs of adoring delight. Some
of them have been smartening themselves and each other up ,
wiping their faces, dusting boots, Sfc.
Tom. Oh. yoti see, they haven?t seen a woman for'nearly
twelve months.
Fan. Poor fellows! Poor fellows! I?ve seen the sort of
thing before. {Unships her fan from her waist, and hands it to
a Digger. Hands her handkerchief to another, her glove to
another, her whip to another , saying the while :) Now, fair play ;
no man to nurse any one article for more than one minute.
Pass round, and return to owner. {To one Digger, who is
admiring her foot, she says, lifting it up a few inches:) All
right, my good man ; perfectly real, and no deception.


While the ? Diggers are nursing and adoring the articles, enter
Lil, slowly , woe-begone, leaning on Tessy. Just as she
reaches the middle of the stage , Fan perceives that the men
are stealing off with her fan , whip, Sfc.
Fan. Hi! My things! My things! Stop them! Tom!
Doctor! Tessy! Stop them !
All rush off the stage , leaving Lil sola.
SOLO.? LiI.
Vainly still I wander ?
Oh, my heart so lonely !
Still I vainly ponder ?
Oh, my heart so lonely !
On that one enraptured meeting.
First, and last, and, ah, so fleeting!
Farewell mingling with our greeting?
Oh, my heart so lonely I
Waiting, longing, sighing?
Oh, my heart so lonely !
Hope within me dying ?
Oh, my heart so lonely!
How shall I, the burden bearing
Of a love forlorn, despairing,
Pass the days of my wayfaring?
Oh, my heart so lonely.
Lil retires to hack of stage. Enter Tessy, Fan {who has
recovered her property'), Doctor, and Tom. Fan takes her
place with Lil ,puis her arms round her , and supports her.
Tessy. Terence, you used to be clever. Can you do nothing
here ? {lndicating Lil.)
Doctor. Difficult case, my dear; difficult case. . . . {As
if thinking deeply I) If we could only get . . MaAo/wet . .
to come to the mountain.
Tessy. Who?s Mahomet? To what mountain?
Doctor {still as if thinking'). Funny business. The moun-
tain wants to go to Mahomet; and Mahomet wants to go to the
mountain ?but {to Tessy) how the devil am I to get them
together?
Tessy {shaking him). In heaven?s name, speak in the lan-
guage of common sense!
Doctor. Tessy, Lucky Joe flees at the sight of a woman.
If he sees a petticoat half a mile off . . . {Abruptly?) Hist!
Hist! Back, girls, back! Mahomet?s coming straight to the
mountain! {Wildly.) Now shall the winter of our discontent


be hanged to you (dragging Tom aside) ; keep out of his
sight. I know hy his face he's in one of his trances. (They
hide at the side.)
Enter Joe, soliloquising.
Joe. A whole year. Twelve months. It seems but yester-
day. And yet it seems ages ago. There must he realities that
are outside of time altogether
Doctor (seen at the side). No, there ain?t.
Joe. And this was one of them.
Doctor (as before). No, it wasn?t.
Joe. Fayette exists ?she is ?hut not in time.
Doctor (as before). She?s in excellent time.
Joe. Fayette??
Lie, who has been graduallg raising her head , attracted bg the
voice , now screams , rushes forward, throws herself on her
knees, and catches hold of his hand. Joe, ivho has only had
a glimpse of her, averts his head at the sight of a woman , and
keeps it averted. At her scream, the whole strength of the
Variety Company hurry in at back of stage, headed by Dame
Davies, all in riding costume. Joe makes as if striving
to get away, but the voice and her grasp of his hand hold him
back.
Lie. At last! my love! at last!
The weary time is past!
(Perceiving his coldness.)
But, sir, am I too bold ?
Or is your love grown cold ?
Joe. That voice! How like Fayette?s it seems!
How like the voice that filis my dreams!
Fain would I speak to her, (half turning) but now
There comes the memory of my vow?
Never again while life doth Lie. Oh, tell me sir, am I too
hold bold ?
To speak to woman of mortal Or has your love for me
mould. grown cold ?
He flings away her hand, and makes as if to rush off the stage.
The girls of the troupe block his path, singing the following,
but gradually give way as he divides a path through them
with a wave of his arms.
Oh, speak to her! ?Tis she, ?tis she
Whom once you chose your bride to be!
Look! look on her! Tour love behold!
This is Fayette, in mortal mould.


Look! look on her! Your love Joe. IS ever again while life
behold! doth hold
This is Layette in mortal mould. To speak to woman of
mortal mould.
[Exit Joe.
Lil ( recit.) Alas, he?s mad ! made mad through me !
Falls semi-fainting into the arms of Fan , and is horne off the
stage.
Doctor comes to front of stage.
SOLO. ?Doctor.
Maiowet to the mountain came
Chorus. Ma-who ? Ma-who ?
Doctor (testily and in mimicking tone ), to Chorus ?
I wasn?t speaking to you ?to you !
Resumes his song.
The result, alas, was very lame
Of such a great ado.
Chorus. Ado ! Ado !
Doctor (spoken to Chorus). I wish you ivould say Adoo ?
(testily).
Doctor. Lor out of all this mighty fuss
Chorus. -ty fuss, -ty fuss
Doctor (as before). Why will you put your oar in thus?
Resumes his song.
There only came a ridiculus mus
Chorus. A mus, a mus,
A ridiculus mus ?
And so say all of us !
Doctor (walking off in dudgeon). Oh, well, you can sing it
yourselves, then.
Tessy. Stay (Taking him aside.) Listen to me, Terence. I
have made money. It will be all yours (he jumps forward
eagerly) ie nay, more, I will promise to return to you, and
be your Tessy as of old (same by-play) if if you will only
contrive to rouse him from his melancholy stupor, and get him
to recognise Lil as the love for whom he mourns.
Doctor. Is it a promise ?
Tessy. It is.
Doctor. Say, as sure?s death.
Tessy. As sure?s death.
Doctor. Then, show me your tongue.
Tessy. There.


Doctor. As clean as a cat?s. Now, let me feel your pulse -
Tessy. There. But what?s all this for ?
Doctor. As steady as an eight-day clock. Now, your heart.
Tessy. Oh, bother! What?s it all about?
Doctor. Can?t you see ? I?m trying to shake off the cook.
I?m trying to get back into my medical vein. You can?t expect
a man to jump at one bound from the frying-pan to the gallipot.
To make a jump of that kind a fellow wants to get his hand in.
Oh, if heaven would only send me now a ticklish case or two to
whet my blunted skill on ! ( A hubbub heard without. The noise
approaches. A cry is heard of ? Doctor ! Doctor , dear!") Oh,
yes, it?s ?? Doctor! Doctor, dear! ? when there?s anything wrong
with them ; but it?s ? Cooky, ye sweep ! ? when they?re burstin?
with health and impudence. ( Enter Diapers, half carrying a
blackfellow, who is apparently in a state of stupor.) Hullo!
What?s this ?
First Digger. Snakebite, Doctor. Calf of the leg.
Doctor. Hooroo! The sweet spirit hath heard my prayer.
Where?s the leg of him ? . . . Hi! what ever have you been
doing to the man p
Second Digger. Oh, we just blasted the bitten place with
gunpowder, and made him swallow two bottles of brandy.
Doctor. Two bott ! Hey! Walk him up and down!
Walk him up and down ! Walk him till you walk the life into
him?or out of him !
The ladies have been crowding around the case with awe-stricken
interest. As the Doctor utters the words (the first time),
? Walk him up and down!" a Digger catches the patient
by the one arm, und a lady catches him (the patient) by the
other, and they march him round the stage between them.
After two or three steps, they let him fall back into the arms
of the next pair , rvho then march him bn, and so on from
pair to pair , the singing going on the ivhile.
First Digger. What a wonderful thing is a doctor?s lore!
Tutti. Walk him up an? down! Walk him up an? down!
Second Digger. Not a soul of us thought of this before.
Tutti. Walk him up an? down ! Walk him up an? down !
First Digger. When we failed with powder and eau de vie,
We believed the case past rem-e-dee,
But the Doctor he just says, says he ?
Tutti. Walk him up an? down ! Walk him up an? down !


At this point one in the crowd raises the cry of ? Snake!" when
all give a jump to one side?the ladies to right, the men to
left (or vice A r ersa). Screams, cries, and double-shuffling as
if a snake were at their feet ?the ladies catching up their
skirts. In a moment they re-form, and resume their march,
repeating ?
Walk him up an? down ! Walk him up an? down !
First Digger. What a wonderful thing is a doctor?s lore!
Turn. Walk him up an? down ! Walk him up an? down !
Second Digger. We will never fear snakebites any more
Here again the cry of ? Snake I" ivith same business as before.
Walk him up an? down ! Walk him up an? down!
Ftrst Digger. Next time, we?ll see our mate dee-dee
Ere we waste such a lot of eau de vie,
Eor the Doctor he just says, says he?
Here again the cry of u Snake!? but this time no one jumps.
They all stand stock still, shake their heads knoivingly fas
much as to say , ? We won't be caught again"), and say ?
No. Oh, no.
(.Resuming their march, and singing .) Walk him up an?
down ! Walk him up an? down !
They march off the stage, singing. The Doctor, Tom and Dame
Davies are left standing in the middle of the stage. Just as
the last of the crowd are disappearing, a number of diggers
rush back, shouting ?
Diggers. Doctor! Doctor! A man fallen down a shaft!
(They take hold of him, as if to drag him to the spot. Another
lot of diggers rush in, shouting ?)
Diggers. Doctor! Doctor! A man in D.T. runnin? amuck
with a axe ! (They also seize and drag him.) A scream is heard.
A number of the ladies rush in, who also seize and drag him in
another direction, crying out?
Ladies. Doctor! Doctor! Polly?s having one of her fits !
Doctor. Now, now, now! There, there. Always the way.
A feast or a famine. Never rains but it pours .. . Well boys ;
ladies first, you know. ( Goes off with the girls. The others run
off in the opposite direction. Tom and Dame Davies are left in
the middle of the stage.)
Dame D. {severely.) This is a sad change, Tom.
Tom. How so, Dame Davies ?
Dame D. Last time I saw you, you were Fortune?s favourite
?Prince Fortunatus ?rich beyond the dreams of avarice. Now,


if I understand aright, you are working for a weekly wage. I?m
disappointed in you, Tom.?Good day. ( Retiring , hut still on
stage.)
Tom. Oh, good day, good day ?( soliloquizing). ISo I was.
So I am. Tip, down ; up, down. I?m down now. So next step
is up. According to my reckoning, up is now about due. I feel
it in my very bones that my luck is just on the turn.
Dame D. (who has been listening.) ? (aside.) Ah ?that may
alter the case Mr. Tom, I trust you do not for a moment
suppose that your change of circumstances has in any way
altered my ?my ?my regard for you.
Tom (aside). What does the old dame mean ? (To. Dame D.)
If my friends change every time my circumstances change, they?ll
have a very changeable time.
Dame D. But, Mr. Tom, when Fortune smiles on you, why
don?t you try to retain her favour ?
Tom. Never could.
Dame D. Then why don?t you get somebody to do it for you P
Tom. By Jove, that?s not a bad idea. It would be quite a
change to have a long spell without any change. But what?s the
good of thinking about it ? Eiches have wings, Dame Davies.
Eiches have wings.
Dame D. Their wings may be clipped , Mr. Tom.
Tom. Can they ? I did?nt know that.
Dame D. But it takes two to do it, Mr. Tom ?a pair of blades,
riveted together ?and at least one of them sharp. (Going through
the motion of clipping with her first and second finger.)
Tom. Scissors! .. . . But, I say, they all call you Mrs. Davies.
Were you married, then?
Dame D. I was.
Tom. And w r ere you?a ?a success as a wife P
Dame I). A success? I should think so ! You never saw an
old man die so happy as my old man died.
SOLO.? Dame Davies.
When Mister Davies (rest his soul!)

With last remaining breath, poor man,

Lest bills should agi fate him?-
And the following was his dying speech,
(I give it you verbatim) ?

Doctor. A hair of the dog that hit him.


Tessy. Oh. I did?nt know a dog had bitten him.

Tessy. Out with it at once, or I?ll take hack my promise !

Tessy (recit.) I see ! I see ! And ere the play is done,
Of course he?ll know Fayette and Lil are one!
Chorus. Eureka ! Eureka!
To make his malady quit him,
There?s nothing half so safe and sure
As a hair of the dog that hit him.
A hair of the dog, a hair of the dog,
A hair of the dog that bit him!
Eureka! Eur?
Doctor. Now, now, now ! Allow me please. You can?t say
? Eureka.? You don?t know Greek evidently. It?s I who say
? Eureka.? I have found it. You must address me in the
second person singular? Eurekas? as ? as ? as.

We hope it will heneff you,
If ever you should yourself require
A hair of the dog that bit you.
A hair of the dog, a hair of the dog,
A hair of the dog that bit you.

Something dreadful comes I?ll swear,
Us to visit.

Something wicked this way comes.
Say! What is it?
Tessy. Behold, the heav?ns grow black!
The sun foregoes his lustre !
Tom (bursting in on the scene )
Hi! girls! Lookout! We?re right in the track
Of a regular Southerly Buster !
Sere the stage ivhtch has been gradually growing darker, becomes
quite dark , as a furious gale sweeps across the scene. Screams ,
confusion, and rushing to and fro. Above the noise of the
storm and the sound of the storm-music , are occasionally
heard the words (sung) *? Look out /? and ?Southerly
Buster ,? as in repetition of last line sung. When the storm
has lasted for a time, the sun suddenly bursts forth again ,
disclosing the ivhole company still on sfaqe, in pairs , a lady
lying in the arms of each gentleman. Tom and Dame Davies,
the Doctor and Tessy being paired together. In the middle
of the stage are seen Lie and Joe, Lie clinging to Joe. The
latter bending his head toward her, as if con versin q with her.
Her face is hid , so that he has no opportunity of recognising
her. Suddenly he seems to realize his position, and casts her
off-
Joe. Alas, my vow I?ve broken !
Lie. Oh love ! Oh sweet!?
Joe. Alas the words I?ve spoken !
Lie. Again we meet! ?
Joe. Though I but said ?Be not afraid ?

Oh cast me not again away,
But bid me dearest, bid me

END OE ACT 11.


ACT 111.
Before the curtain rises an unseen hand is heard playig the music
of the Ballet, followed by cheers and applause , and cries of
? Encore," as for an unseen performer. When the curtain
rises , ?an inner stage is seen, the curtain up, and a
female dancer bowing acknowledgements to the applause
of the crowd. In front is an audience of diggers?some
smoking. The stage is supposed to he in a large tent. The
inner curtain descends , but the digge r s insist on their
? Encore ? being complied with. The inner curtain again
rises and the Ballet begins.
BALLET
(Performed by the ladies of the Variety Troupe.)
Cries of admiration, cheers and exclamations of delighted criticism
are heard and continued at appropriate stages throughout its
performance. When the curtain falls, the performers are
again called upon , but the curtain merely rises and shows
them still grouped as at the end of the Ballet The diggers
throw nuggets on the stage, which are eagerly scrambled for
by the girls, and weighed in their hands. The curtain then
falls.
Various diggers rise and move about. Bottles are produced
and liquor poured into pannikins and passed round. While
this is going on, two diggers come to the front.
First Digger flighting his pipe). Well, iny colonial, what
d?ye think of that?
Second Digger (struggling with his pipe, slightly under the
influence of liquor). Grolly, man, it?s nyum nyum. .. . But I
thought the Boss was to he here. I heerd tell it was for his par-
tic?lar benefit. Moreover, what 1 says is this {getting quarrel-
somely excited). ... it would be a bloomin? sight more respectful-
like to us diggers ... if the Boss, after shoutin? seats for all
hands, had come an? sot hisself down among us. He?s gettin? too
almighty ?igh, is Lucky Joe.
First Digger. But ain?t ye aweer the Boss can?t abear the
sight of a gal ? '1 hey say Cooky?s with him now, tryin? persua-
sion on him, hut it ain?t no go. You know his crank, sure-lye.


Second Digger (waxing more vehement). Damn his cranks !
I say it?s onrespectful. Boys ! L say it?s onrespectful to this
crowd that the Boss don?t show hisaelf. What say you ?
Voices o� Diggers. That?s so, Dusty!. So say all of us.
Let?s fetch him ! Who?s on ?
First Digger. Softly, boys. Softly does it. If ye will
have it, let?s work it through a deppitation.
Second Digger. Deppitation be it, then .. . me, an? you an?
Bully Ben .... Is that agreed, boys P
Voices of Diggers. Agreed! That?s it! The?ayes? have it.
First Digger (as the Deputation begin to move off the stage).
But only persuasion, you know ?
Second Digger. Only persuasion. We?ll just persuade him
that if he don?t come along of us, we?ll bust up this here show.
(As they disappear , the bell rings, and to cries of ? Seats, boys!
Seats ! ? the curtain rises).
Fan, in page's dress, appears on the inner stage.
(Cheers from Diggers.)
Fan. Gentlemen, I appear on the part of the management,
who desire me to express their regret that their world-famed
baritone singer, Signor Basso Tenore, has been taken suddenly
ill?the water of this place having disagreed with him.?
A Voice. Tight!
(Laughter and howls.)
Fan. And he will consequently be unable to sing this evening.
I have much pleasure, however, in announcing that our friend, Mr.
Tom Trueman, whose powers as a vocalist are known to you all,
has volunteered to take the Signor?s place, and will now sing his
popular song ? The Bower-Birds.?
(Applause.)
A Voice. We?d rather have Tom any day !
Voices oe Diggers. That we would !
(Repeated cheers.)
Tom appears on the inner stage in evening dress, a sheet of music
in his hand.
A Voice. Golly ! Ain?t he a Swell!
Another Voice. That ain?t old mother Patchett?s starchin?,
you bet!
Another Voice. Is them the baritouey?s togs, Tom?


As the unseen hand strikes the first note of the accompaniment, a
Digger standing up amongst the crowd with a bottle and pan-
nikin, calls out ?
?Ave a drink first, Tom ! your fav?rite brand !
Tom remains imperturbable , and attempts to begin.
Voices of Diggers. No you don?t!
Not till you?ve wet your whistle !
Not till you wet them glossy togs, Tom!
Tom leaps down from the stage among them, and goes through the
form of drinking from a pannikin, then turns to go back to
the stage, a number of Diggers get behind him.
Voices of Diggers. No! Don?t go up there !
We?d rather have you here, Tom !
Stay with your friends !
Stick it out here, Tom ! And we?ll give
you a chorus!
Tom mo res to tne front of the outer stage, and the unseen band
again strikes up the opening bars of the accompaniment to the
song of ? The Bower-Birds."
The inner curtain falls.
SOLO.? Tom.
I knew two Spotted Bower-birds,
A female and a male :
They came to me for comfort,
And told me all their tale:?
A Man of Lore had passed their way,
Bald-headed, lean and pale.
You know the kind of man.
Bald-headed, lean and pale ;
And you?ll pity those two Bower-birds,
Who told me all their tale.
You know the kind of man, &c., &c.
Chorus.
Within their bower he spied them,
And called them such a name !
? Chlamydera Maculata ?
Was what he did exclaim !
What cares that heartless Man of Lore,
They?ve left the place for shame.
You know the kind of man,
Bald-headed, lean and pale,
Who calls poor birds disgraceful names, ?
And hence this woful tale.
You know the kind of man, &c., &c.
Chorus.


? Ghlamydera Maculata ! ?
And now, in mournful mood,
They seek, in hopes to lose it,
Some higher latitude.
But oh, that Man of Lore, he knows
?Twill stick to them for good !
You know the kind of man,
Bald-headed, lean and pale,
And you?ll pity those two Bower-birds,
Though that is all their tale.
Choktjs. You know the kind of man, &c., &c.
At the close 0/Tom?s soar/, enter the Deputation, followed hy Joe
and the Doctoe. Joe seats himself with his hack to the
inner stage, r VoiA joins the Doctoe. They reyard Joe wist-
fully.
Diggkes. Three cheers for the Boss ! Hurrah ! &c.
Job rises , turns half round and sliyhtly acknowledyiny the cheers,
resumes his seat as before.
Doctoe. (in a low hut excited tone). Tom, slip round to Lil.
Say he?s come ; and no matter what is next in the bill, tell her to
let the curtain rise at once on that Bridal Procession ?you know.
{Exit Tom.)
Doctoe {aside). Gad I?m as nervous as I was at my first
operation. Guess I?m the only one of the medical fraternity that
ever prescribed a Circus for the cure of a lunatic patient. {To
a digger with a pannikin.) Here?-if I don?t exhibit aqua vitce
in my own case, I'll be a patient myself. {Band, who hy this
time have returned to their seats in the orchestra, striking up
the music of the Bridal March). Ha ! They?re at it already !
The inner curtain rises on the Bridal Procession. The Chorus of
girls sing ? Comes the Bride,? &c., as in Act 1., and continue
to sing as they march round the inner stage. Doctoe regards
Joe steadily.
Joe appears strangely moved. He rises, turns half round, tremb-
ling, but again turns his hack to the stage and resumes his
seat, drops his head and hides his face in his hands. The
girls arrange themselves in a line at the back of the stage, as
if awaiting the appearance of the Bridegroom. Joe remains
as before.
Doctoe. Perdition! The darned thing won?t work ! There?s
some link missing ! What the devil can it be ?
Joe produces his small hand-glass and gazes into it wistfully.
Doctoe. Ha! There it is! That is it!
The Doctoe beckons violently to Lie, who shoivs by her gesture
that she understands his meaning. She leaps down from the


stage , and , coming behind Joe, looks over his shoulder. He
sees her reflection in the glass. He starts up trembling.
Looks again in the glass. Sees her reflection still. Turns
round very slowly , still keeping his eye on the glass , and ex-
hibiting symptoms of great agitation At length sees Lie,
drops the glass , and with a cry , clasps her in his arms. They
remain some time in the attitude of embrace , the chorus girls
singing ?Happy Bride,? &c. Joe over and again holds Lil
at arms length , ami gazes into her face as if to assure himself
of the reality of her presence. The other leading characters
are grouped around them , but at a little distance, the audience
of Diggers looking on ivith manifestations of pleasure. The
Doctor dancing with delight.
Cries and shouting are heard outside?hubbub of a crowd close at
hand. A man rushes in and whispers to Tom.
Tom (excitedly to Joe). The night-shift have come across the
largest nugget ever unearthed in Australia !
Great excitement among the crowd , ivho immediately begin to rush
off the stage.
Tom (taking Joe by the arm). Come, Sir! Come!
Joe waves him off. Tom runs off the stage , followed by all the
rest. Joe and Lie are left alone.
DUET. ?Joe and Lie.
Joe. In such an hour, oh love, as this,
No treasure rare hath charms
To tempt me from the rarer bliss
I find within thine arms.
Ear more to me thy smile, thy kiss,
Than all the gold
The world doth hold.
No more I wait on Fortune?s call,
Since thou art mine, my all in all.
Ensemble. When each to each is all in all,
The world is ours, whate?er befall.
Lie. In such an hour as this, oh love,
i hear no voice but thine ;
I crave no other bliss, oh love,
Than thus to know thee mine.
Thy vows are treasure far above
All store of gold
The ivorld doth hold.

selves around the stage.

USE ONLY
WATSON, FERGUSON & CO.?S WRITING INKS.
THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT, after subjecting the Inks
to a careful examination and test, have decided that in future these Inks are
to be substituted for Stephens? Inks in all the Government
Departments, and have accordingly contracted with WATSON, FERGUSON CO.
for the supply. They are also largely sold hy agents in New South Wales and Victoria.
The public may therefore feel thoroughly assured as to the high merits of the Inks.
igf No More Imported Inks.
THE WRITING INK OF THE DAY
IS WATSON, FERGUSON d CO.?S.
MEMO.?We beg to bring before your notice our Writing
Inks, which, after a long and careful research, we have
brought to such perfection that we feel confident they will
be found equal in every respect to Stephens? (or any other
imported Inks), and at a cost of one-third less.
BLUE BLACK WRITING FLUID.
BLUE BLACK COPYING INK.
VIOLET BLACK COPYING INK.
SCARLET INK FOR STEEL PENS.
CONCENTRATED BLUE BLACK WRITING FLUID.
INDELIBLE MARKING INK FOR LINEN.
DARK and LIGHT BLUE, VIOLET and other COLOURED INKS.
CYCLOSTYLE INK?BLACK, RED, and BLUE.
INKS for RUBBER and METAL ENDORSING STAMPS.
NOTICE. ?Many Stationers and Storekeepers object to sell our Inks solely on account of there
being a larger profit attached to the sale of a quart bottle of Stephens? Inks at 3s. 6d. than a quart bottle
of ours at 2s. 6d. Purchasers should therefore see that they are not made to pay 40 per cent, more for
the mere difference of a name, and insist upon having no other than Watson, Ferguson & Co.?s, on any
plea whatever. The fact that the Ink is now exclusively adopted in all the Government
Departments to the exclusion of Stephens and other makers, is a sufficient guarantee that W. F. and
Co.?s Ink is equal to the best of any imported.
