Toreword
The Evangelical Revival of the 18th Century had deep
roots in the lives of the people in Cornwall. A century later,
many of their descendants migrated to the Ballarat goldfield.
Some settled in the canvas-town at Mount Pleasant where they
erected their tent Bethel on the site of the present Church.
Their sincere piety, evangelical fervour, and moral force
made a deep impression upon the community. Others as well
as their descendants entered this spiritual inheritance. Conse-
quently, the century of this Church is marked by periodic
revivals, decisive victories in the battle with the liquor traffic;
generous support to charitable institutions; and unstinted giving
to meet Church building costs.
Many of these saints have gone on before. We gladly
and proudly honour their memory.
“Great the heritage they left us,
Great the conquests to be won.”
What of the future? We possess the message which alone
can save men and women today, and bring true and lasting
in our time.
Let us be worthy followers of our predecessors and our
Master Jesus Christ, and carry into the new Church the same
love, loyalty and devotion. Only so can we make a vital
impact upon the community in which we live.
In the preparations for the centenary celebrations our
Church organisations have enthusiastically co-operated with
the T rustees. A warm welcome awaits all who are able to
join us on this great occasion.
Albert Briggs, Minister.
Reginald G. Bartle, Trust Secretary.


A Brief Historical Survey
A number of Cornishmen, transferring from Clayton Hill to
the tent-town of Mount Pleasant, had their Church brought across
and re-erected on the site of the present Mount Pleasant Church.
The first services at Mount Pleasant were held in a structure of
slab sides and canvas roof in Apiil, 1855. Miners attended services
in red shirts, moleskin pants, red silk sashes and Wellington boots—
a loud contrast to the milder colours worn by their women folk.
Two years later, this edifice was replaced by a wooden building
with a shingle roof; it had seating accommodation for 200.
The Rev. J. S. Waugh laid the foundation stone of the bluestone
Church on 21st March, 1865; it was built to accommodate 300. Of
this ceremony “ The Ballarat Star,” March 22nd, 1865, reported that
“Some of the people, both male and female, were so rude as to engage
in such loud talking under the very nose of the speakers, that on one
occasion the minister celebrant had to stop and call them to order.”
(Talkative friends please note.)
During 1914-18, the last of the big gold mines in the district
closed down. Consequently, many families moved from Ballarat.
In 1949 the Trustees decided to start a New Church Building-
Fund and Rev. R. W. Uren, resident Minister at the time, subscribed
the first £l.
On 28th February, 1954, the foundation stone of the new Church
was laid by the Rev. A. D. Leiean who had worked wholeheartedly
and effectively to swell the Building Fund.
SUNDAY SCHOOL
The first school rolls date from January, 1855, and the school
was held in the tent Church and later in the wooden Church The
first Sunday School building was erected in 1876 and replaced by the
present one in 1907. The Sunday School centenary was celebrated
on 12th December, 1954.
Few Sunday Schools have had so few Superintendents in a
century’s history. The terms of three occupants of that position cover
a period of 70 years—Mr. D. Berriman, 25 years; Mr. C. C. Growcott,
20 years; and Mr. A. Coates, 25 years.
CHOIR SINGING
The first conductor was Mr. Jonathan Shaw, whose choir
consisted of male voices. This Church has always been noted for
its singing, and for vigorous singing no choir has excelled Mount
Pleasant.

Farewell
O God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home.

The Lord bless thee and keep thee;
the Lord make His face to shine upon
thee and be gracious unto thee; The
Lord lift up His countenance upon thee
and give thee peace.
