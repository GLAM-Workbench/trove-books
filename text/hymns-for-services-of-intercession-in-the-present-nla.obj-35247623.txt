2.—Lamb of God, Who Died to Prove.
Tune: Ajalon.
Lamb of God, Who died to prove
All the depth and height of love;
In the shadow of Thy cross
We would shelter from the loss,
From the terror and the shame
Of a world with war aﬂame.
Man of Sorrows, we "would bring
Here the prayer we scarce can sing.
For the men who ﬁght and die,
For the orphan’s broken cry;
For the burden Thou canst bear
And the darkness Thou canst. share.
Saviour of the world, we plead
By Thy Cross high o'er our need;
Calm the storms of wrong and hate,
Shield the hearts made desolate,
Thrones of earthly pride remove~
And bring in Thy reign of love.
_Amen.
3.-0 God, in Whom We Live and Move.
Tune: “Melita."
O God. in Whom we live and move,
Who art our Strength, our Home, our Love;
From Whom our inmost prayers we learn,
To Whom our wistful faiths return:
Thou Who hast drawn our hopes to Thee:
O hear our cry for victory.
Lord of Nations, here we stand,
Marshalled and ledat Thy command;
We saw a people driven to die,
And heard Thy glory in their cry:
Now as We match to make them free,
Grant us, 0 Lord, Thy victory.
God of our children, hear our prayer,
Though we through dark and death must fare;
Turn back the serried ranks of hate,
The tempest cries of wrong abate;
And through our tears, Lord let us see
The shining of Thy victory.
_ Amen.


4.—Lord God of Hosts.
Tune: Ombersley.
Lord God of Hosts, Thy hand alone’
Has built our hearths, our spires, our throne;
And made our empire broad and free,
One with the greatness of the sea. _
Yet we, Thy people, Lord, have erred
Far from the guidance of Thy word;
In ease and pride we dreamed away
The shining of Thy mercy’s day.
Now in the gloom of war we come
To Thee our fathers’ Help and Home;
And ask that we as they may prove
The sway of Thy redeeming. Love.
Teach us the faith that ﬁnds Thy song
Through nights of tears, and days of wrong:
Give us the steady heart to stand
Unshaken at Thy clear command.
Search us with truth, 0 God, and then
Show us the Brotherhood of men—
That city built beneath the sky
Of Love that gave itself to die.
Lord God of Hosts, Thy hand alone
Can shield our hearths, our spires our throne;
And make us gentle, brave, and free,
To serve before Thy majesty.
Amen.
s.—Nearer My God to Thee.
Nearer, my God, to Thee—
Nearer to Thee,
E’en though it be a cross
That raiseth me;
Still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my God, to Theer~
Nearer to Thee.
Though like the wanderer,
The sun gone down,
Darkness be over me,
My rest a stone;
Yet, in my dreams, I’d be
Nearer, my God, to Thee—
‘ Nearer to Thee.
There let the way appear,
Steps unto heaven: .
All that Thou sendst to me
In mercy given:
Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my God, to Thee—-
Nearer to Thee.


Then with my waking thoughts,
Bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs
Bethel I’ll raise,
So by my woes to be
Nearer-', my God, to Thee-
Nearer to Thee. ' V '
Or if. on joyful wing,
Cleaving the sky, -
Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
Upwards I ﬂy,
Still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my God, to Thee-
Nearer to Thee. Amen.
6.—Lord God of Hosts (Johﬁ Oxenham).
To be sung to the tune “Melita”—“Eternal
Father, strong to save.”
Lord God of Hosts, whose mighty hand
Dominion holds on sea and land,
In Peace and War Thy Will we see
Shaping the larger liberty.
Nations may rise and nations fall,
Thy Changeless Purpose rules them all.
When Death ﬁies swift on wave or field,
Be Thou a sure defence and shield!
Console and succour those who fall
And help and hearten each and all!
0, hear a people's prayers for those
Who fearless face their country's foes!
For those who weak and broken lie,
In weariness and agony—
Great Healer, to their beds of pain
Come, touch, -and make them whole again!
0, hear a people's prayers, and bless
Thy servants in their hour of stress!
For those to whom the call shall come
We pray Thy tender welcome home.
The toil, the bitterness all past,
We trust them to Thy love at last.
0. hear a people's prayers for all
Who, nobly striving, nobly fall! '
For those who minister and heal,
And spend themselves, their skill, their zeal—
Renew their hearts with Christ-like faith,
And guard them from disease and death.
And in Thine own good time, Lord, send
Thye Peace on earth till Time shall end!

7.—Recessional.
Tune :. “St. Chrysostom.”
God of our fathers, known of old, ,
Lord of our far-ﬂung battle line,
"Beneath Whose awful‘ Hands we hold
Dominion over palm and pine—-
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget!
The tumult and the shouting dies:
The captains and the kings" depart;
Still stands Thine ancient sacriﬁce,
An humble and a contrite heart;
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget—lest we forget!
Far-called our naylies melt away;
On dune and headline sinks the ﬁre;
LO,; all our pomp of yesterday
'ls one with Nineveh and Tyre!
Judge of the nations, spare us yet,
Lest we _forget—-lest we} forget!/
If, drunk with sight of power, we loose
Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe,
Such boastings as the Gentiles use,
Or lesser breeds without the law,
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget——lest we, forget l‘
For heathen heart that puts her trust
In reeking tube and ironshard,
All valiant dust that builds on dust,
And guarding calls. not _Thee to guard.
For frantic boast and foolish word,
Thy mercy on Thy people Lord! Amen.
-Rudyard Kipling.
B.—Fathe‘r Who Aft Alone-.

Father, who art alone
Our helper and our stay,
0 hear us as we plead
For loved. ones far away,
And shield with Thine almighty hand
Our Wanderers’ by sea and land.
For Thou, our Father God,
Art present everywhere,
And bendest low Thine ear
To catch the faintest prayer,
Waiting rich blessings ‘to bestow
On all Thy children here below.


0 compass with Thy love
The daily path they tread;
- And may Thy light and truth
Upon their hearts be shed,
That, one in all things with Thy will,
He%ven’s peace and joy their souls may
l .
Guard them from every harm
When dangers shall assail,
And teach them that Thy power
Can never, never fail;
We cannot with our loved ones be,
But trust them, Father, unto Thee.
We all are travellers here
Along life's various ‘road,
Meeting and parting oft
Till we shall mount to God;
At home at last, with those we love,
Within the Fatherland above.
Amen.
9.——ln the Hour of Trial.
In the hour of trial,
Jesu! plead ior me,
Lest by base denial
I depart from Thee;
When Thou seest me waver,
With a look recall,
Nor, for fear or favor,
Suffer me to fall. I
With forbidden pleasures
Should this vain world charm,
Or its tempting treasures
Spread, to work me harm;
Bring to my remembrance
Sad Gethesemane,
Or, in dark resemblance,
Cross-crowned Calvary.
Should Thy mercy send me
Sorrow, toil, and woe;
Or should pain attend me .
On my path below;
Grant that I may never
Fail Thy hand to see;
Grant that I may ever
Cast my care on Thee.
When my last hour cometh, . '
Fraught with strife and pain;
When my dust returneth
To the dust again;
On Thy truth relying
Through that mortal strife,
Jesu. take me, dying,
To eternal life. . Amen.

Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide
0 receive my soul at last!
Other refuge have I none;
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee:
Leave. ah! leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me!
All my trust on Thee is stayed, "
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenceless head
With the shadow of Thy wing! "

More than all in Thee I ﬁnd;
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
Heal the sick, and lead the blind!

Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears for ever ﬂow,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou a.lon’e.


Nothing in my hand I bring;
Simply to Thy Cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless, look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the fountain ﬂy;
Wash me, Saviour, or I die.
While I draw this ﬂeeting breath,
When mine eyes shall close in death,
When I soar through tracts unknown,
See Thee on Thy judgment throne,
Rock of Ages cleft‘ for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.
Amen.

A kingly crown to gain;

Could pierce beyond the grave,
Who saw His Master in the sky,
And called on Him to save;
Like Him, with pardon on his tongue,
In midst of mortal pain,
He prayed for them that did the wrong;
Who follows in His train?

On whom the Spirit came, -
Twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew,
‘And mocked the cross and ﬂame;
They met the tyrant’s brandishedsteel,
The lion’s gory mane,
They bowed their necks the death to feel;
Who follows in their train?
Amen.

To follow in their train.
