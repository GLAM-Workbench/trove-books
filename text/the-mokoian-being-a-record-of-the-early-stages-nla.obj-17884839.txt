THE MOKOIAN.
Published in Emulation
of thf. Honoured Comrades
we FOLLOW
Editorial.
The dedicatory lines quoted on the cover of this pro-
duction are, we think, almost sufficient introduction to what
follows within, but there are still some matters which must
not be overlooked. The lines quoted come to mind as expres-
sing very aptly our view of what lies ahead in the clouded
turmoil we are now moving towards. We quote them hum-
bly, conscious that whatever confronts our battalion we shall
be able to render only so much as our best amounts to. But
this much we are ready to give in order to help the great
cause, to resist the infamous wrongs thrust upon our com-
rades and our Allies and to make more clear the horizon
of the future. What more need be said?
The name “Mokoian” was selected from the many sug-
gested, because the publication relates strictly to the units
on His Majesty’s New Zealand Troopship No. 43, which is
in reality the old spume-throwing Mokoia we knew in more
peaceful times as a useful coastal and inter-colonial trader.
She, too, has been drawn into the vortex by war’s demands,
and, at the time of writing, is plying her way through
tropical waters we must not be too definite about. Her
passengers consist of the headquarters staff of the Fourth
Battalion, N.ZE.B., A, B and D Companies of that unit and
a section of the New Zealand Medical Corps, all of whom are
iu the happiest frame of mind and well pleased with the
behaviour of the transport. Under the skilful handling of the
master, Captain Brown, and his associates the ship has braved
the broad expanse of the southern seas and set a resolute
prow toward our destination with a minimum of discomfort
to the land lubbers who strove to form fours on the bridgs
deck.
It will be found that a certain proportion of the matter
contained in this number is reprinted from -earlier issues
printed on voyage. The matter is selected on its merit, and,
as it called forth favourable comment at the time of publi-
cation, is considered an essential part of the souvenir.
The editor wishes to thank all who have helped in the
work of preparation of the various numbers, the dili-
gent salesmen and the officers who have encouraged with
their interest. In detail thanks are due to :
Major Wolstenholme, whose ready permission gave the
Mokoian its birthright.
Major Stansell, whose supervision was of very material
assistance.
The Chief Steward, Mr. Perkis, who placed the ships
printing plant at our disposal.
Finally we wish to point out that we have neither
sneered nor jeered. We hope that we have cheered and that
the slate is wiped clean of our iniquities.
THE MOKOIAN.
Humours of Extempore Journalism.
Since so keen an interest has been evinced in the
“Mokoian” it has been thought advisable to tell the whole
story, or, at any rate, so much as is printable, of how the
little paper came into existence. There are, of course, certain
shades of the history which will hot bear committal to type
for the very strong reason that one would have to employ
language so highly coloured that it might blind the com-
positors. However, there remains a good deal that is print-
able, and to this we come now.
When, early in the voyage across the Tasman Sea, the
idea of a paper was mooted and the writer was invited to
take upon himself the responsibilities of chief culprit, there
was no intention that the paper should be printed on voyage.
However the following day a discovery was made, and this
changed the whole course of events. It was ascertained that
there was a printing press on board. Now, the chief culprit
is not a printer, but he went aft under the protection of our
genial friend the chief steward, Mr. Berkis, and looked over
the plant. Hopes rose high. Here was a platen press, which,
though obviously a relic of antiquity, gloried in the name of
“The Model.” With such a name it could not fail to be
satisfactory! At least that was the first thought upon behold-
ing it.
Moreover, there was a seeming abundance of type and ink.
What more could be desired?
A hasty consultation with the 0.C., the Chief Culprit’s
Company ensued, a Compositor was run to earth, and the
epoch-making proceedings were initiated. We were in the
midst of our stocktaking when we ran foul of the medical
officer, who had some “ remarks ” to make regarding the
general disregard we showed for cleanliness. Undismayed,
w'e pushed on with our new enterprise. All day long we
wallowed in kerosine, ink and debris. At last we managed to
dig the plant out, but we were dismayed to find that the supply
of type was sadly deficient. Had it- not been that our word
had been given that a paper would be issued, this deficiency
might have deterred us. We, the staff sat down. We smoked.
We scratched our respective heads. The question that troubled
us was how were we going to print a whole page when we had
only five R’s and four T’s? No ordinary page could possibly
contain less than forty of each of these letters. And ours are
to be ordinary pages. Very ordinary I We smoked some more
and scratched a little more diligently, but no solution pre-
sented itself.
“ W ®T y° u k[ >ow all about it, I’ll leave it to you,” said
the Chief Culprit to Culprit No. 2. Whereupon he went out
into the sun and took his case.
No more was said about the missing T’s, but the com-
positor demanded manuscript the following morning. When
a few minor items had been handed over a session of thought
became necessary in order that the journal might be rich
m wisdom and wise sayings. But instead of wisdom came
a dread discovery-there was no paper. Like a thief in the
light the Chief Culprit went forth and scouted. He was
prepared to steal, but managed to borrow two hundred sheets
of foolscap. There were, needless to say, much too large to
use on a machine that had never printed anything larger than
a menu card However, a company quartermaster fell into
oui hands, and we extorted from him a butcher’s knife bearing
a family resemblance to a scimitar. With this the paper wal
hewn into suitable size, and the printing began. There were
innumerable diversions in passing. The verbal fireworks ol
tie compositor when he discovered that his cases were de-
ficient in more respects that have been mentioned have been
refreshing even though they disturbed the steady flow of in-
spiration, besides which there have been ' the callars
Oh. yes those dear callers. When at the height
of oiu labours an, unshaven face suffered in ” a
"■ «
“ Hello, printin’ a paper?” This with an air of discovery,
reply ' <omg 8 blt of bomb-making,” the comp, would
“ look out y° u don’t blow yourself up, sonny,”
would be the parting shot. J
They came and went (after a time) but we persevered.
Hie results of our labours are known to everyone on board,
and they speak for themselves.


CROSSING THE LINE.
Initiations and Honours.
“These delights if thou canst give,
Mirth, with thee I mean to live.”
Milton.
That imp, Laughter, walked abroad, on the
day we crossed the line. Just when we slipped
through the barrier between the hemispheres wilf
probably remain a profound mystery, for opinions
on the subject differ widely. The brass boy was sure that
we crossed bn Friday morning, the bo’suu was taciturn and
the stewards certain that it was Saturday. A corporal related
how ; he felt a bump on Thursday evening, and one of the
officers was sure that the increased speed on Friday morning
was due to the fact that we were travelling down hill. How-
ever, in the midst of this whirlwind.of ancient jocularity we
bow our heads in acceptance of the general view that we
are now in the northern hemisphere.
Neptune and his dazzling entrounge came aboard at 1.30
p.m., on February 2Vth. His entry was triumphant. As
with sufficient covering to make the police doubtful whether
they should make an arrest. “His Majesty” was attended by
a gaudily bedecked herald, the court physician, Dr. Bill
Smith, and an extensive following including criers, police,
and the court barbers, the latter being armed with huge
razors.
When the honoured visitors had taken up their positions,
the herald called through his megaphone for the master of
his ship, whose representative, Mr. Bankine, the first mate,
managed to satisfy Neptune that all was in order, for which
service he was admitted to the order of the “Sons of the
Sea Cooks.”
“Bring forth the officer commanding the troops here,”
demanded Neptune stridently.
The C. O. faced the inevitable cheerfully, and, to the
accompaniment of roars of laughter, was ushered into the
“royal” presence by a squad of weirdly dressed police.
Being charged with making his first attempt to cross the
line, he put forward so eloquent a plea that “His Majesty”
was moved to admit certain statements as extenuating. This
generosity did not mean escape however, for, fixing his victim
with an inscrutable eye, the presiding genius administered a
raking dressing down for what, he said, was considered an
AD INFINITUM
How the bin appears when you are peeling.
the hoary head of the border monarch made its appearance
it .so inflamed the imagination of the Maori rangitira in
attendance that he was moved to lead his braves in a haka
of welcome, the combined effects of the waving mere, the
rolling tongues and eyes, the quivering flesh and the incanta-
tion eliciting a veritable storm of applause (vide the Dom-
inion) Men in the scantiest of khaki garments were perched
on every conceivable coign of vantage in view of what was
to be the centre of activity for the afternoon. They clung
like so many flies to spars, derricks, ventilators, railings,
ladders, etc., until Neptune’s bath was completely walled in.
With the entry of the distinguished visitors Laughter waved
Iris wand and roars of hearty response came from every
quarter, for the members of the Court were arrayed in won-
derfully incongruous costumes.
Neptune, impersonated by that incorrigible wag Denny
of A. Company, was arrayed according to the needs of the
moment in Crown and flowing robe, but the influence that
had the most telling effect in making one aware of his pre-
sence was the stench arising from a decaying fish he trailed
at the end of a rope. He was accompanied by a buxom and
bedizzened Mrs. Neptune, who, in turn, was attended by
a coy little train bearer in the person, of Sergt. Muldoon, who
wore a modern frock combining the maximum of exposure
unpardonable mission. But the C. O. took his medicine
with fortitude in consideration for which he was awarded a
fine of “thirty bob,” fourteen days C.B. “with all conces-
sions” and was presented with an iron cross.
The Adjutant came like a bride to the altar, dressed for
the part. He was compelled to admit that there was nothing
to be said in his defence, whereupon he was ordered to pay
a fine of “20 bob” and to receive one shave and two dips.
“Barber, seize your prey,” Neptune commanded.
The barber, being an obedient wight; (with an N.Z 8.8.
training) seized. Seated in the chair the victim had to
endure a liberal plastering with a mess of green and pink
lathers followed by a rough-house shave with a yard
long wooden razor. This gentle little ceremony over,
the victim was tipped backwards into the bath and delivered
into the hands of the “Knights of Hie Bath,” who dutifully
carried out instructions.
The O.C. B Company followed. In consideration for his
“timely criticisms” he was offered an iron cross, but he
expressed a. preference for the Order of the Bath. Neptune,
being an obliging ruler, with a turn in the direction of democ-
racy, gladly acceded to the suggestion and ordered payment
of a fine of 30/-, one shave, and four dips, which command
was carried out to the latter. These preliminaries over the


fun followed fast and frolicsome. Penalties were handed out
in a most promiscuous manner, the fines never being
omitted. Lather was bespattered indescriminately and the
bath assumed a soupy appearance, but the victims —even
markers —steady —displayed the greatest of good humour.
The majority of the officers, including the padre and the
medical staff, having passed under the benign scrutiny of the
Ocean Monarch, a start was made on the rounding-up system
by which all who came within reach of the court police
were given the honours. Lieut. Emery, whose nurses cos-
tume stirred the spirit of gallantry in Neptune, was permitted
to escape on payment of one kiss. There is no call to enter
into discussion as to which was the least to be desired
punishment. Lieut. Reid questioned the qualifications of
the court doctor, who used a megaphone as a stethoscope.
The prisoner demanded a consultation which may or may not
have been a ruse to ensure that Captain Guthrie was not
overlooked. Wc have our doots. At any rate the last named
officer was brought forward. He pronounced his colleague
sound, and both were promptly admitted to the Order of the
Bath. ,
A tropical shower sweeping from the west practically put
an end to the proceedings. It was, however, a timely in-
tervention for it enabled those to whom the lather was still
adhering to indulge in the rarity 7 of a fresh water bath and
afforded excuse for the descreet withdrawal of many who
believed that their turns were approaching. It is understood

the course of preparation. They will take the following

OUR CONCERTS,
“And to his ears there came suck words as these
Light of Asia.
Of the changeless monotony of our voyage has doue
nothing else it has served to bring forward much entertaining
talent which would probably not have been discovered under
other conditions. The pugilistee stunts of the Donk and
Tim Daly could not satisfy everyone, though they had the
effect of showing who were prepared to remain spectators, so
an inventory of the talent available for concerts had to be
taken. The result has been a series of concerts of uniformly
high merit in the course of which many performers have won
unstinted praise and the men on board have displayed the
keenest interest. The life on the ocean wave may have its
allurements with those whose knowledge of it is limited
to song and story, but, while it must be admitted that it has
certain compensations, there is always the mocking swish ot
the rollers to hammer home the consciousness that tomorrow
and its work will be exactly the same as is experienced today.
Entertainment, therefore, becomes a dire necessity.
Between Auckland and Albany everyone was so busily
engaged in exchanging tali stories anent previous experiences
at sea that any other form of diversion, appeared superfluous,
but even prevarication pulls after a while, and the limit was
reached when dissertations upon the playful habits of whales
became the invariable order for the smok-ho.
The responsibility for the creation of a new interest fell
to B. Company, and a very enjoyable concert programme was
rendered in the social hall. Major Stansell, 0.C., B. Corn-
pany, occupied the chair and managed the audience so well
that the performers escaped scatheless. The notice on the
wall requesting the patrons to throw nothing at the orchestra
was respected, a fact for which the members of that organi-
sation wish to return their heartfelt thanks. Songs and
stories with, now and then, a rousing chorus put everyone in
excellent spirits and the bar takings touched zero. In short
the concert was such an unqualified success that it became
obvious that it would have to be repeated.
This was done a few evenings later when the transport
was nearing the tropic of Caprecorn, and, as the heat had
already come into play, the second concert was given on the
birdge deck. Songs belonging to other days were resuscitated
and the choruses of “Annie Laurie,” “Every Ship will Find
a Harbour,” etc., rang out across the calm tropical waters
carried on a freshening breeze.
The Sergeants Mess provided the next party of guilty ones,
and the concert was given on the forward bridge deck. Eegi-
mental Sergeant-Major Watts protected the performers in his
capacity as Chairman, and the function was quite as success-
ful as those which preceded it.
On the eve of crossing the line a monster concert was
given, practically all the performers on board being con-
cerned. So satisfied was the audience that a demand for
more was put forward, and seevral officers had to step into
the breach. The C.0., who presided, scored a marked suc-
cess with “The Rosebud,” a sweetly, plaintive little song,
while the Adjutant and other officers helped to prolong a re-
cord concert.
“Thus, long ago,
Ere heaving bellows learn’d to blow
While organs yet were mute,
Timotheus, to his breathing lute,
And sounding lyre,
Could swell the soul to rage, or kindle soft desire.
AMATOS.
(Love Fever).
Being the substance of a lecture delivered by Rfm. F. R.
Woolbridge with the object of covering a very grave omission
on the part of the medical staff.
This is a specific fever caused by the entrance into the
system of the bacillus amatos. It does not attack the very
young or very aged to any extent. It generally occurs
between the first and last shave in man (see Hector
McDonald’s treatise) and the first and last, hair net in the
case of a woman. The mortality rate is only about 99.9 per
cent.
The forms of the attack may be roughly put down as
simple cardiatio, acute cardiatic and chronic oardiatic. The
simple, being very mild, can tie treated by giving a brand
new wash. Chaff and cold water will do. The acute and
chronic forms are dangerous, lasting anywhere between one
week and a life-time. The chief symptoms are ;
(1). Loss of appetite.
(2), Rise in temperature and fall in pocket money.
(8). Frequent brushing of the hair. If the hair has a
well defined parting accompanied by highly Inflamed sox
medical aid should be instantly procured.
(4). Variegated Respirations.
(6). Sighs and deep exhalations (mince pies, pork, etc.
may also be the cause).
Treatment.
Change of environment (enlist and become a rifleman)
Plain cooking (cut out pastries as much as possible, especially
any kind of tart) encourage a healthy hobby (keep white
mica).


The disease may run a short course or may become mom
able. Inoculation is useless. One attack does not give
immunity against another, but those who are susceptib e
should avoid reading poetry. Do not wear a look of ha
next your heart. It may set up irritation and prevent identi
fication disc from accomplishing its aim to remove dan ir
unlimited quantities. Great controversys have raged over the
origin of the fever but most of the explanations have proved
quite ambiguous. Perhaps the best idea of the origin is that
it was originally a parasitic blight living upon an apple tree,
(see Genises-Garden of Eden episode).

APPARITIONS.
THREE FAREWELLS.
The Hose Down.
The God of Day treading his majestic way from East to
West beholds strange spectacles. But the strangest of them
all is one that meets his aiming gaze as be bobs over the
horizon and bids “Good-morning to the world in general
the hose-down parade.
Scene 1.
The Domitoeies.
A tangled mass of nakedness slowly and sleepily resolves
itself into a number of man-shapes as an angry voice invokes
them to hasten. , .
Domitory Sergeant —get a move on you lazy blighters.
Come on Smith, you’re always last; you too Jones.
Rfm. Smith *******!
Rfm. Jones *******!
The exodus commences the dormitory Sergeant mean-
while exhorting, the laggards to “get a move on” with
adjectival fireworks interpolated. Through devious pas-
sage-ways and up winding stair-ways the weird procession
winds its way to the bridge deck, where scene No. 2 is
enacted.
Scene 2.
BmDGtE Deck.
Man on the Hose (as first figure of procession emerges
from companionway). Come on Rip Van Winkle, I m not
going to hang on to this thing all day, Cold? No its not
cold. Now don’t shy off like a skittish heifer. It wont
hurt you. What the devil are you jumping at?
Rip Van Winkle —-How about giving someone ei’se a
turn.
By this time the deck is crowded with naked shape*.
There are long men, strong men, lean men, clean men (very
few), fat men, short men, lithe men, clumsy men, and
others who cannot be classified. They come in such variety
that one recalls Gabriel Rosette’s illustrations_of Dante’s
works. Some come boldly forward to the squirting nozzle,
others sidle up for a sprinkling, while still others linger on the
outskirts of the concourse, satisfied to enjoy second hand the
sensations of the bath.
The sun blinks at such a spectacle.
Presently a dismal howl! rends the air. One of the lost
souls speaks to the man at the hose.
“There’s no need to knock the wall of my dining room in
with that confounded thing.”
Man at the’ Hose —Well it needs a wash.
One by one they pass under the stream and wend their
shivering way down, the slippery stairs hack to their quarters.
Scene 3.
The Domitoeies.
Domitory Sergeant —Now, you fellows, hurry up. Dry
yourselves and dress. You’ll have to turn out for physical
drill in a few minutes.
Rifleman Sinks —Someone’s poled my pants.
Rfm. Jinks —Where’s my flaming shirt.
Chorus—Where’s my
Various articles are mentioned. There is something,
menacing in the howl, so the Domitory Sergeant departs to
“see what he can do about it.”
Presently he returns to call down the stairs “Hurry up,
below, ten minutes warning’s gone.
Rifleman Binks (still searching vainly for pants), ‘ r oh
yes, its all hurry up and no hurry down. But the burning
question is what blighter’s got Willie’s little pants. And
now I suppose I’ll get ‘Ell for bein’ late.”
She leaned back, resting her beautiful head, in the hollow
of my shoulder, her hair touching my cheek. All around
was still, the purpling shadows of night having brought a cool
quietness. We had said the innumerable things lovers say
at parting, and now the dread hour had arrived. We were
upon the highest pinnacle of emotion.
“And you will come back to me," she whispered. It
was more a statement than a question, I thanked God for her
faith
“When I have done my job" I answered.
“You will always think of me?”
“Yes, always, just as I want you to remember me.”
She sighed and went on, “ You will be brave.” Again i
was more a statement than a question.
“Because I will remember your courage,” I answered.
It was time for me to go, I kissed her tenderly—with a
tenderness springing from the depths of my soul—and, with
my arm about her, I rose.
With arms entwined we walked to the gate. A car was
waiting in the shadows.
She leaned out over the gate. Her exquisite eyes were
shining. I could net speak.
But she whom I had elected the greatest girl in God’s
creation proved herself in that last moment and gave me a
religion to carry.
“I would not have you stay,” she said. “Much as 1
love you I want you t6 win your spurs. Good-bye, dear,—
May God grant all my prayers for you.
t*' * *
Her silvered hair glistened under the ray of light escaping
through the shade of the reading lamp, and I caught the
glinting play of the needles as the hands that had ministered
to my infant body knitted comforts.
I stood upon the threshold of my greatest sorrow. But
as the sense of my great grief came home to me and made my
throat burn, my mother helped me again as she had helpel
me a thousand times before.
“You will see much dear ” she said.
“Yes, mother.”
“You will write often?”
“Often mother.”
She looked at me, and I became conscious of her pride.
Yet she spoke to me —to whom manhood had come many
years ago—as she would have spoken to a child.
“When you go on your way, dear boy, you will find
yourself in many situations which will demand of you all the
moral strength your father and I have tried to give you.
Remember your mother who always prays that your soul may
be as white and yonr body as clean of disease and hurt as
when you nestled in her arms.”
An hour later I bade my mother farewell, and she smiled
through her tears.
* * * * *
The old Dad opened the door of what used to be my room.
The room is now filled with the boxes of soldier brothers who
have gone the way of all men.
“You haven’t got long now, boy,” he said between the
long puffs he took at his pipe, for, though his seventieth
birthday 7 has gone to join its predecessors in the garden I
memory, the dear old boy .still relishes his pipe.
“Only a little while, Dad, but I’m glad to be going.
I’ve been a long time in camp.
“It seems only a day or two since you went,*’ he said,
and then he gave me his farewell blessing— -“We’ve done
what we could for you boy. We’re proud of you and glad
you’re on your way to join your brothers and your chums. 1
know you will take your gruel without complaint. Be glaj
of it because it will make a man of you. God bless you and
the cause you are to vindicate.


These were the most- bitter partings of my life, I tell you
of them because they gave me a soldier’s creed—to win my
sprite, to keep my soul and body clean and to take my gruel.
And to this I say, as Plato said : —“Anything more?
This prayer, I think, is enough for me.

and came through the ordeal unscathed. Some musicians!
That some means should be taken to prevent the in-
discriminate kissing of girls at the wayside ports. The
doctor quite forgot to touch on this subject in his lecture on
the prevention of diseases. Still, it wouldn’t be a bad form
of inocculation. Medical staff please note.
That there will be no need to round up a fatted calf for
Dick Monaghan when he returns home. He will bring a
pair of beauties with him.
That it was never discovered in camp that L.-Corp.
Wright, of A. Coy. is an expert “Chips.” The ship’s car-
penter is green with envy. Sam knows something.
The 4th Platoon A. Coy. were first to hang up the flag
of honor for one week in Maymorn. How the mighty have
fallen! They reckon they will come back to form again now
the temptations have been removed. Who can tell?
That the Farmyard Melody in the forward hatch at
Lights Out is really worth a trip down to hear. “Facile
decensus est in- Averni.” 15th Platoon excel in clucking
hens and cook Growings. 16th Platoon (Saxon’s Bairns)
make a specialty of “Hee Haws;” seems to come quite nat-
ural to them. Nos. 13 and 14 produce a babel of sound quite
unrecognisable, but the “Baas” seem to predominate. Surely
they are not lapsing back to their native state?
Sergt. Fitzpatrick desires it to be known through these
columns that he does not use Antipon.
AYe strongly suspect that the “Dirty Dozen” is a name
no longer applicable. Since washing without soap has been
the vogue the number has risen to 400.
The postal authorities were the other day asking for
the writer of an unaddressed letter written by Tim to Alice.
Case of “Alice Where Art Thou,”eh Tim?
Rflm. Bateman and Stilton of A. Coy. promised to give
an aquatic display if leave was not granted in Auckland.
AVas the water too cold?
It is stated in the most select circles that Hector
McDonald will deliver a lecture shortly on “The Secret of
being Always Shaven.”
A RECRUIT’S REMINISCENCES.
Trentham :
Say you all remember Trentham, and the outfit that you got
When they shot you fhrough the storeroom as if the floor
was hot,
When your denims, slouch and great-coat, with all your other
gear,
Came flying from all quarters and the order was, “Si™
Here 1”
It- was a scene of hurry, there was no time for halts,
You just passed through that building like a dose of Epsom
Salts;
Oh, the nervous strain was awful, you simply shook with
fear,
When that stern bewhiskered autocrat yelled fiercely
“Quick Sign Her©l’’
Alas, you could not really know what then comprised you •
kit,
Nor could you say in honesty your denims were a fit :
'Tis true they’ve shrunk with age and use, but in their youth
’twas said,
That room enough there was to spare in which to stow yam
bed.
And then 't was farewell Trentham, and you staggered neath
your load,
How you floundered as you formed your fours along that
well-known road ;
You all felt sad that morning, as a way you all were borne,
To that sylvan scenic Paradise, that libel called “Mav
Mora.”
MAY MORN ;
And thus we came and conquered, and settled on the spot,
The tender memories that thou wove will never be forgot .
if thou hast made us sinners the fault alone is thine, °
For in spite of our entreaties thy climate- ne’er was fine.
Ah May Morn, how we loved thee when thy gentle zephyrs
blew,
And old Pluvious was incensed and drenched us through
and through;
When we steered through the mud-heaps from the cook-hous ■
with our mess,
We would sing from Sankey Moody and thy loved name we
would bless.
But we could not stay for ever where the slush was full
knee-deep,
Where the rain came thro’ the canvas and would drench
us in our sleep ;
So we prayed for our deliverance, but ere- the time had ebbed,
We found in consternation that our blessed feet were
webbed.
We bid farewell to May Morn, to it’s towering chimney stack,
W e left it in the dead of night, no more to wander back ;
Who e'er may share thy shelter, in future days to be,
We pray thou’lt pay them homage for what thou did’st to
W B,
RANGIOTU:
When we stepped upon the flier for another change of sphere
This time to RANGIOTU we went with feelings queer.
Thank goodness! Here we found a place you could no;
match on earth,
> Tl ‘e natives swore no rain had fell not from its date of birth
But soon a- newer nuisance then made its presence felt,
The water scheme all went on strike, the butter too would
melt.
The sand would blow into your eyes, your nose, your mouth
your ears,
Until of dread Sand-i-tis the doctor had his fears.
Of course we went to Foxton, proud city by the sea,
AVe did it on a route march, on half a mug of tea;
We followed with night duties among the rugged hills.
And lost a number of our squad thro’ taking Beecham
Pills.


With a wind-up march through Palmerston, and Auckland
city too.
We stepped on board the transport and waved our friends
adieu.
And we watched our loved Mew Zealand fade dimly far
astern,
Where our loved ones dwell and wish us well until our sah
return.
THE TURF.
They say that it is necessary for the waves to keep step
in order to satisfy the standards of exactitude required of a
certain ship.
“There’s a ship in. our fleet,
She’s trim and she’s neat,
But, oh my! Heave a sigh !
For the waves racing white,
Must dress by the right,
Or go up as high ar a kite ;”
B COMPANY’S SPORTS.
The protest of No. 6 Platoon against No. 8 in the tug-o'-
war for making fast to a stanchion has been withdrawn.
Evidence elicited the fact that it was only “Baby” Young as
anchor man.
Two sth Platoon sergeants were not exactly experts at
spar-boxing, but they seemed to enjoy themselves, and
certainly amused the crowd.
A popular win ; Dad Brewer’s iu the cock-fighting.
Sergt. Gibbons seems to be fond of salt water. He got
plenty. Capt. Hackworth got some too.
The Lazy Stick event was purposely omitted. Certainly.
Not at all a suitable event at B. Coy.’s sports.
A number of spectators gave as their excuse for not com-
peting “They were long distance champions. Bight oh, you
budding Dorandos, plenty of time to show staying powers on
other fields.
An “in and out affair.” The obstacle race.
A striking feature of the sports : Hector McDonald’s
face hectoring No. 8 in the tug-o-war.
Why no events for ladies? Spar-boxing, or even the
wheel-barrow race would both have been appreciated.
Tim Daly had no show against Sergt. Goulding in the
spar boxing. Taihoa sergeant, the “Donk” is in training.
D. COMPANY’S DONNYBBOOK.
D Company's sports, held on Sunday afternoon, were a
huge success. One of the chief events, the tug-of-war, was
annexed by the 15th platoon, who put in a hefty team, with
Andy Casey in. the stern.
One of the most amusing events of the days was the
blind boxing contest. The sparring exhibition of Walsh and
Avery made even the 0.0. laugh.
Several other amusing events excellently competed for,
made up a very enjoyable afternoon’s sport.
We would suggest the following items for the next sports
meeting to be held on board :
1. Climbing the greasy pole with a brick under each arm.
Ist prize, 1 day’s feed at the Officers’ Mess; 2nd, 5
minutes in the bar-room; 3rd, warm bath.
2. Putting the 161b. shot 3 times round the bridge deck.
Ist prize, Compliments of the Season, by the Band;
2nd, Three cheers from the Crowd; 3rd, bucket of fresh
water.
3. Officers’ Race, 5 times round a three-cornered ring,
uphill. Ist prize, a week’s board in No. 1 hatch; 2nd,
1 day as censor; 3rd, book of canteen coupons.
AMONG THE NUTS.
OVERHEARD IN THE OFFICERS’ MESS.
Do they get the fresh fish out of the baths when thev
draw up the salt water?”
“Yes, but the fish get something not exactly fresh when
the plugs are removed.”
THE PIANOLA CRANK
Oh, that Pianola Crank, he should be done to death,
He’ll sit and grind the instrument until he’s out of
breath :
Of music his ideas are crude, he’s got an insane fad
To murder all the music rolls and drive his comrades
If he were training for the track to either bike or run,
His actions would be justified, we’d think it jolly fun;
But to see him grimly pedalling, while the luckless
keynotes groan,
Is the vilest form of torture that we have ever known.
Last night it was suggested, while lights were growing
dim,
That there should be a picket told off to capture him.
His awful fate was quickly sealed in language more
than vapid,
We’re going to sling him up aloft, and give him “Three
Rounds Rapid.”

THE BATTLE OF X
(BY “EYE-WITNESS.”)
Orders came through suddenly that we had to take posi-
tion X, cost what might. We were entrenched, and had
been subjected to a day’s bombardment of the heaviest artil-
lery, notwithstanding which all the boys’ beds were neatly
dressed, and the C.0., had passed the word along “That he
was more than pleased with the appearance of everything.”
Dress orders came through ; Forage Caps, etc. Position
X nevertheless stood where it was, bristling with difficulties.
Our officers drew breaths (not revolvers) at the thought of
getting everyone safely over the parapet in forage caps.
Comrades whispered to comrades their good-byes and final
admonitions that certain buttons were undone. One platoon
commander, fearing that Grand Rounds (.303) would find his
bunks untidy, sent back for a report on condition of same.
The report was concise and to the point ; “Very dirty Retire
your command at once; not a moment to be lost!”
The awful moment was approaching, and a deathly still-
ness reigned.
Superior officer to Platoon Commander No. 2 : “Pvte.
Jinks is wearing a slouch hat.”
Pvte. Jinks has lost his forage cap, sir.”
“Retire your command! Damn, you 1 How can we pre-
sent a solid front improperly dressed?”
The moments to many of our brave men, perhaps their
last, were fleeting swiftly. Alas I O.C. right wing reports:
“Many of my braves have their laces showing beneath their
puttees. Shall I carry on?”
The reply came short and swift: “Good God 1 Retire
your command! The men will fall over them!”
What next?
“Bill Adams, show the flag of truce!”
The flag of truce waves o’er our ramparts. Do our foes
recognise it? Yes! Two officers step out and approach our
position; two of our’s advance.
“My compliments to you. Will you grant an
armistice?”
“An. armistice! The battle has hardly begun
“ ’Er well, my men, not being accustomed to the din and
noise of battle, have omitted certain items of dress, and all
commands have been retired to adjust same.”
“Not usual, my dcah sir, weally, I will await your
second essay.”
