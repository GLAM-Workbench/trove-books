PRAYER OF INVOCATION
HYMN 643
QDrfor of S'erotre
Great King of nations, hear our
prayer,
While at Thy feet we fall,
And humbly with united cry
To Thee for mercy call.
The guilt is ours, but grace is Thine;
O turn us not away.
But hear us from Thy lofty throne,
And help us when we pray.
The Moderator
“Great God of Nations”
Our fathers’ sins were manifold.
And ours no less we own;
Yet wondrously from age to age
Thy goodness hath been shown.
When dangers, like a stormy sea,
Beset our country round,
To Thee we looked, to Thee we
cried,
And help in Thee was found
With one consent we meekly bow
Beneath Thy chastening hand,
And, pouring forth confession meet.
Mourn with our mourning land.
With pitying eye behold our need,
As thus we lift our prayer;
Correct us with Thy judgments.
Lord,
Then let Thy mercy spare.
READING (Old Testament), Ps. 46

PRAYER . . . Rev. John Edwards, M.A., Clerk of Assembly
PSALM 24, verses 7-10,
Ye gates, lift up your heads on high;
ye doors that last for aye.
Be lifted up, that so the King
of glory enter may.
But who of glory is the King?
The mighty Lord is this;
Ev’n that same Lord, that great in
might and strong in battle is.
Ye gates, lift up your heads; ye doors,
doors that do last for aye,
Be lifted up, that so the King
of glory enter may.
But who is he that is the King
of glory? who is this?
The Lord of hosts, and none but he-,
The King of glory is.
READING (New Testament), John xiv, 1-13—
Rev. James McLeod, St. Stephen’s Church, Sydney


For those we love within the veil.
O fuller, sweeter is that life.
Who once were comrades of our
And larger, ampler is the air:
way,
Eye cannot see nor heart conceive
We thank Thee, Lord; for they have
The glory there;
won
To cloudless day;
And life for them is life indeed,
Nor know to what high purpose Thou
Dost yet employ their ripened
The splendid goal of earth’s strait
powers,
Nor how at Thy behest they touch
race;
And where no shadows intervene
This life of ours.
They see Thy face.
Not as we knew them any more,
Toilworn, and sad with burdened
There are no tears within their eyes;
With love they keep perpetual
care, —
tryst;
Erect, clear-eyed, upon their brows
And praise and work and rest are one,
Thy Name they bear.
With Thee, O Christ.
HYMN 601
“O God our help in ages past”
O God, our Kelp in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home!
A thousand ages in Thy sight
Are like an evening gone;
Short as the watch that ends the
night
Before the rising sun.
Under the shadow of Thy throne
Thy saints have dwelt secure;
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
And our defence is sure.
Time, like an ever-rolling stream.
Bears all its sons away;
They fly forgotten, as a dream
Dies at the opening day.
Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame.
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same.
O God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Be Thou our guard while troubles
last,
And our eternal home.
