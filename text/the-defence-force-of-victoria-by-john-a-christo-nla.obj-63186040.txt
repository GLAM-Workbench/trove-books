THE DEFENCE FORCE OF VICTORIA.
2nd December, 1880.
In determining the extent and constitution of the defence force for
the colony of Victoria, due regard must be had to the conditions and
circumstances of the colony, as well as to its military requirements.
If the latter only were to be considered, undoubtedly a regularly
organized paid force would be established ; but this the financial
circumstances of the country forbid. It remains, therefore, to deter-
mine what form of military force may be established which will be
sufficiently economical, and yet which will afford a reasonably good
and reliable means of resisting foreign aggression. Such a force, to
be of any value, must be fairly drilled and disciplined, of good
physique, capable of being readily assembled and quickly moved to
any particular place. It must be properly divided into regiments
and battalions of sufficient size, and, since it must form our first
line of defence, it must be made as efficient as the circumstances of
the colony will allow. In numbers it should be sufficient to meet,
on equal terms, any force which is likely to be brought against us ;
and we have the high authority of Sir William Jervois for believing
that its numbers should not be less than 2,700 men.
Do the local forces of Victoria, as at present established, fulfil
these conditions 1 In my opinion, they decidedly do not. While I
am willing to give credit to the local forces for much that is
excellent ; for persevering, often in the face of many difficulties, with
their self-imposed duties ; for honestly striving for greater pro-
ficiency ; yet I believe that the system is radically weak. I believe
them to be insufficiently drilled?that the twenty-four parades
which they are required to attend annually are altogether insuffi-
cient, being less than they would have to do in a week in the army,
with the further disadvantage of being done at night. lam well
aware that the zeal of the greater number induces them to attend
more frequently than the law requires, but that does not weaken
the statement that the system is at fault. It sometimes happens
that not a single daylight drill is held for twelve or eighteen months.
I believe them to be divided into companies which are too small, and
that they are not drilled in battalions or regiments of adequate size
?indeed, that would be impossible by night. The physique of the
force has gradually deteriorated, through the increased admission of
mere lads. These, no doubt, would fight, and fight bravely too, but
they require the intermixture and example of men of more mature
age to acquire the necessary steadiness and pertinacity in moments
of pressing danger. The discipline of the whole force is too lax ;
in particular companies especially is this the case ; while the attend-
ance at parades scarcely averages 40 per cent, of the strength of the
corps. Another disadvantage is that they are not readily assembled ;
the men are scattered widely in particular districts, and could not be


assembled without considerable notice. The system of drilling in
small companies prevents a proper knowledge of field movements in
either officers or men ; while the various companies being drilled in
somewhat different time of march and movement is destructive to
uniformity of action. Even when a battalion parade does take
place, the number present is totally inadequate. One battalion of
infantry, even on paper, numbers only 300 men. On parade, if we
exclude the bands, only 50 or 60 files can usually be put into line?
about the strength of two very weak companies.
Yet, exclusive of the naval defences, this is the force upon which
the colony has to depend in case of invasion. Even in time of war
it is improbable that more than a comparatively small force could be
kept regularly paid ; and it is clear that no other force is likely to
be available, under existing circumstances, which can be drilled and
trained in the military knowledge essential in modern warfare. It
is in time of peace that this knowledge must be instilled and all
preliminaries arranged. When war breaks out, the rapidity of
modern evolutions and tactics forbids the hope that sufficient time
will be allowed to drill and organize bodies of troops. It is in time
of peace, therefore, that we must complete our arrangements. You
may refer to the Victorian Artillery as affording an efficient and
reliable body of men. No doubt they are an exceedingly fine body
of men, fit to cope with any equal number that may be brought
against them ; but they are only 150 strong, and we may rest
assured that no enemy is likely to invade the country without a
force sufficiently powerful to absolutely ignore such an insignificant
number. It has been said that they would form the nucleus of the
defence force, around which the remainder would rally in time of
war, and that the discipline and military spirit of this handful of
men would, by some mysterious process, permeate the 3,000 men
necessary for our defence. The force of the argument may be
estimated at its just value by considering that a force of 3,000 men
occupy a space of about two-thirds of a mile when in line ; yet the
various parts of this extensive line are to be supposed to be affected
by the proceedings of a body so insignificant in numbers as the
Victorian Artillery. And if the argument were worthy of serious
consideration, it is certainly incomprehensible that the proceedings
of a body of 150 artillerymen could greatly affect the operations of
a line of infantry, when it is a well-established maxim in war that
artillery must always be themselves supported by infantry, and their
movements must, therefore, to a great extent conform to the latter.
It is not, therefore, the artillery that would govern the movements
of the infantry, but, on the contrary, it is the action of the latter
which must absolutely control the movements of the artillery. How
necessary is it, therefore, that the infantry should be equal to the
duties which will devolve upon them !
It is evident that an effective and readily movable force is required
by the country ; that the present condition of the local forces does not
supply the desideratum ; and that a reorganization and remodelling
of those forces is necessary. The best means of doing so is, in my
opinion, to pay the men. We do not find in any pursuit that
effective service is given, year after year, for nothing, and we may


rest satisfied that the military system of the country will be no
exception to the rule. Of course I am well aware that the country
cannot afford, and Government would never sanction, a heavy
military expenditure ; but a moderate and reasonable amount would,
I believe, be agreed to by all parties, as necessary to place the
country in a state of defence against foreign aggression. Such
expenditure can be regarded only as an insurance against possible
disaster, and should be looked at in precisely the same light as we
regard insurance against fire or shipwreck ; and I believe that the
services of more than 2,500 men can be secured for the amount
which has lately been paid for military purposes, viz., �40,000 a
year. Under the system I propose, these 2,500 men would receive
five times as much drill as is now obligatory upon the Volunteer
Force, and may therefore be expected to be proportionately more
efficient, particularly as they would serve under the ? Discipline Act,?
and be compelled to attend a given number of daylight drills in
every quarter. I propose that the whole of the Volunteer Force be
reorganized, enrolled under the ? Discipline Act,? and paid the small
amount of �lO a year each, on the same system as the Naval
Reserve, and should, like them, be compelled to attend, in every
quarter, thirty hours? drill, of which eleven hours must be daylight
drills. This gives a total of 120 hours? drill in every year, precisely
five times as much as must now be attended by volunteers in order
to be classed as ?effective.? If any member of the force attend the
required drills, and go through his course of musketry instruction,
at the end of the quarter he will receive his money. Should he fail
to atttend the required drills, there will -be nothing for him the
country will pay nothing, and he may do better next quarter. To
judge of the results which may be expected to flow from such a
system, I desire to lay down no hypothesis ; I will point simply
to facts and to x'esults which have already been established. I will
point to the Naval Reserve of Victoria, among whom the system
lias been established, and ask you to draw your conclusions from the
results shown there, and not from any imaginary theory.
I will ask you to consider the chief qualifications necessary in a
soldier, as exemplified in their case :?lst, their physique ; 2nd, their
length of service and consequent efficiency ; 3rd, their discipline ;
and 4th, their drill.
1. Respecting the physique of the men, it must be admitted that
the Naval Reserve forms a force which is far superior to any
volunteer corps, and, in this respect, Is equal to the regular forces
of the Royal Navy ; indeed, at a recent trial of strength in the
military sports they showed themselves superior to any equal
number from the squadron then in the Bay. But, without insti-
tuting comparisons, it must be admitted that they form an
exceedingly serviceable bod}' of men, none of them being admitted
under 21 years of age; and their physique and capacity for
endurance form a strong contrast to that of the majority of the
Volunteer Force.
2. Their efficiency is greatly increased by the length of time they
remain in the service. In the Volunteer Force I believe that
about 800 resignations are received every year, and an equal number


of raw youths admitted in their place, making a total change of
25 per cent, in the whole force every year. Of these a large
number remain for a few months, attend perhaps eighteen or
twenty parades, are classed as ? effective,? and then drop out, while
the Government pay the capitation grant of �2 10s. per head for
them. In other oases volunteers attend twenty-four parades in the
first few months of the year, and then cease practically to belong to
the force, but their names are continued on the roll to the end of
the year, and the capitation grant drawn before they are struck off.
Bearing these facts in mind, it may be inferred that a Volunteer
Force which returns 3,200 effectives at the end of the year does not
really at any one time contain more than 2,700 or 2,800 men who
would he available in case of necessity, while their average length of
service would probably not exceed eighteen months or two years,
and during that time they need not attend more than from thirty-
six to forty-eight parades and drills. In contrast to this, we find
the small payment allowed to the Naval Reserve induces the men to
remain year after year. A very large proportion of them have been
in since the establishment of the force, and many of them were
members of the old Volunteer Naval Brigade before that ; so that
their length of service, combined with the large number of drills
they attend, makes them a really efficient body of men. The late
Captain Stubbs, a few weeks before his death, informed me that the
average length of service in the paid Artillery Corps did not exceed
ten months, because some had only recently joined, while others,
when they had been in for about eighteen months, were drafted into
the police and penal departments. The duration of service in the
Naval Reserve must, therefore, be much greater than in the paid
Artillery Corps ; a corresponding increase may be expected in
proficiency ; and the same good result may be anticipated if the
Volunteer Force be reorganized on a similar basis.
3. With respect to discipline, the men in the Naval Reserve serve
under the ? Discipline Act,? and are subject to the same penalties
as the permanent artillery. The silence and precision of their move-
ments shows that their discipline is good, while the rarity of any
punishment for insubordination proves conclusively the excellent
results that may be expected from payment. In civil affairs a fine
of �2 or �3 is usually considered a sufficient punishment for any
ordinary police offences, and this is precisely the means by which
discipline is enforced and regularity of drill attained in the case of
the Naval Reserve, without putting into force the penal clauses of
the ? Discipline Act,? except on rare occasions. The forfeiture of �'??>
due at the end of the quarter is, in one sense, equivalent to a fine of
similar amount ; and the stopipage of this sum by the commanding-
officer is a sufficiently heavy punishment for any ordinary offences,
and acts to some extent as a deterrent against greater ones.
4. The drill of these men is, as might be expected from the greater
number of parades they attend, far superior to that of the Volunteer
Force, and indeed superior to what might be expected from a com-
pulsory militia, such as that of England. In England, the militia
turn out for drill only at a stated time in the year, and then only
for a very short period. Their knowledge of drill is, therefore, not

sufficiently sustained, and in the long interval between their periods
of service much is necessarily forgotten. But in the Naval Reserve
the drill is continuous throughout the year ; every week they attend
two parades in addition to the daylight drills called at intervals, and the
advantages of the system are apparent in the excellence of their drill.
To extend this system to the whole of the local forces no special
legislation is required. The ? Discipline Ant? enables the Government
to admit under its provisions any persons whom it chooses ; there
need, therefore, be no delay in its application. All that is required
is to maintain the military expenditure at the amount it has reached
during the last few years, but to distribute it differently. Under
present arrangements, only �7,800 to �B,OOO are expended upon the
Volunteer Force ; the balance of the vote defrays the cost of drill-
instructors, stores, staff, and the Artillery Corps. So long as the
latter corps exists, I believe the heavy expenditure it involves will
prevent any Government from attempting to ameliorate the condition
of the local forces generally. But which is better for the country?
to have a force of 150 artillerymen and 3,000 indifferent volunteers,
or to have a reliable force, of 2,500 well-drilled men, under good
discipline, equal in every respect to the Naval Reserve 1 I consider
that this question admits of but one answer, and I would therefore
propose that the field officers urge upon the Government?
1. That the present military forces be reorganized, and a paid
force of 2,500 men be enrolled under the ? Discipline Act.?
2. That each man sworn in under the ? Discipline Act ? be paid
�lO a year.
3. That two parades per week in uniform, or twenty-six parades
per quarter, be held at the various orderly rooms in the
evenings, as at present ; and, in addition, that daylight
parades be held every second or third week on Saturday
afternoons ; nineteen hours of evening parades and eleven
hours of daylight parades per quarter to be compulsory.
4. That payments of �lO a year bo made in four quarterly
payments. Should any member fail to attend the minimum
number of parades prescribed, his pay to be forfeited for
that quarter.
5. The whole of the naval and military forces of Victoria to
serve Under the ?Discipline Act? in time of peace, and to
be subject to the provisions of the ?Mutiny Act? of
Great Britain in time of war.


It has teen, suggested that the country does not require a very
numerous land force, because the system of defence which has been
decided on has for its object the absolute exclusion of an enemy by
completely barring the entrance to the bay. I regret that I cannot
endorse this argument. On the contrary, it appears to me that the
concentration of the whole of the defences at the Heads, and the
absolute ignoring of any inner line of defence, implies the necessity
for providing a sufficient force to prevent the only line of defence
from being taken. The loss of any of the forts at the Heads may
mean the collapse of the whole of our defences. Sir W. Jervois
seems to have been impressed with the necessity for such a force, for
he recommends that 2,700 men should be maintained by the colony
?for the purpose, doubtless, of meeting and opposing any hostile
force which might land. But, in making a recommendation that
2,700 men should be provided, no doubt Sir W. Jervois had in view
a force which was real and efficient. He probably contemplated a
force under effective discipline, which might be readily assembled,
and quickly moved to any threatened point, and which in presence
of the enemy would display, not only courage, but also skill in an
equal degree. Without such a force, of what value are the forts
which he recommends ? It has been established that the forts, aided
by lines of torpedoes, and by the Cerberus, will prevent the ingress
of a hostile fleet. But what if any of the forts are taken 1 Let us
consider the position of an enemy desirous of attacking Melbourne.
He may either enter Western Port, and march overland a distance
of 42 miles, or he may endeavour to turn the defences at Port Phillip
Heads. The former contingency is improbable, unless the attacking
force should be so powerful as to march to an assured victory, and
be able therefore to leave his line of communication liable to inter-
ruption. But the attempt to turn the defences at the Heads and
capture one or more of the forts might be made with a much smaller
force, and with less risk of a serious disaster to the enemy should
the attempt not succeed. The distance between Queenscliff and
Point Lonsdale, along the beach, is about three miles ; and large
vessels may anchor at a distance of 3,600 yards from the battery,
and land their men from boats at a point half-a-mile north-east of
Point Lonsdale, and distant only about 700 yards from the vessels.
A landing may be made there at all times, except when a heavy
gale is blowing from the south-east. The hostile force might then
advance rapidly towards Queenscliff and take the battery there in
rear. At present that battery is open, and could offer no resistance
from the land side. But, assuming that it receive further additions,
it does not seem impossible that an active and enterprising enemy
might succeed in obtaining possession of what is a mere six-gun
battery ; more particularly as he would be powerfully aided by the
guns of his fleet. Should he succeed in this, it is quite conceivable
that the whole scheme for the defence of Melbourne would collapse.
The lines of torpedoes might be removed, and the maintainance of
the fort commanding the West Channel rendered impossible, so that
this in turn must fall.
I believe that when the wind is favourable a similar attempt might
be made to take the battery at Point Nepean. Should either of


these attacks be successful, the result must be most disastrous, as
there is no inner line of defence. The batteries commanding
Hobson?s Bay have been dismantled ; and Melbourne could be bom-
barded without the satisfaction even of returning a shot.
The only way in which such attempts could be defeated is by
having an efficient and sufficiently numerous land force to prevent the
success of any attack upon the batteries, and to encounter any force
which might attempt to march overland from Western Port.
Without such a force the colony cannot be defended ; and it is
certain that the training and establishment of such a force is not a
matter of days or weeks, but of long and patient labour, extending
over a considerable period of time. Without it, we may build forts
and shambles for those who, with weak and insufficient power, will
still nobly strive for the honour and safety of their country ; but
those efforts must be in vain, and the forts raised at such expense
will only be the means of deepening our disasters. It behoves,
therefore, every man who has a spark of patriotism in his breast to
labour earnestly and zealously for the establishment of such a force
as, while within the means of the country financially, may make an
enemy weigh well the consequences before he ventures to set foot on
the soil of Victoria,
ADDENDUM, 8th FEBRUARY, 1882.
The above paper was read at a meeting of officers held near the
end of 1880. The subject matter of it was to have been discussed;
but, for some unexplained reason, no consideration has ever yet
been given to it, although I have reason to believe that nearly every
officer in the force is in favoux*, at any rate, of the general pxdnciples
thei?ein laid down. The present seems to be a time peculiarly appro-
priate for taking such steps as will lead to the settlement of our
defences upon some satisfactory basis All must admit that the present
defence foi?ce is insufficient in number and inefficient in discipline,
drill, and physique. It may be assumed that the Government
must be as satisfied as the volxxnteer officers can be of the inadequacy
of the present force to x?esist foreign aggression, for they have ali?eady
given notice in the legislature that, during the present recess, the
condition of the force will receive their serious consideration, with a
view to introduce such changes as may be necessary during the next
session of Parliament. None can know better than the officex?s of
the force in what direction changes may be beneficially made ; and
it is, therefoi?e, incumbent upon them to give the benefit of their
knowledge and experience to ? the powers that be,? in order that the
best possible light may be thrown upon the whole subject. In all
communications to the press, and in almost all the utterances of our
public men, the contention seems to be that Victoria has little else
to fear, in time of war, than the attack of one or two crxxisers, and
that to resist them the Cerberus, aided by the foi?ts at the Heads, will
be an ample defence. It is true that Sir W. Jervois contemplated
the possibility of an attack in greater force either by way of Western


Port or by turning the batteries at the Heads ; and to prevent such
an occurrence, he recommends the maintenance of a force of 2,700
men. I have lately become possessed of certain information with
regard to the preparations made by another country, which leads me
to believe that, in the event of England declaring war against that
country, a force of 5,000 men would probably be sent to attack this
city in case of war. lam not in a position to give the full details of
this scheme ; but let us assume that England and Russia were at
war, and let us imagine that Russia had, at the present moment, ten
fast steamers, of the ordinary merchant type, in her ports in Eastern
Siberia. Will anyone say that those vessels could not be filled with
infantry and field artillery, and despatched, not in a body, but singly,
with orders to rendezvous at some place out of the ordinary run of
commerce?say 200 miles south of Tasmania?until they had all
assembled, and then make a sudden dash at Melbourne? Would it
be impossible, at the same time, to have another vessel employed to
cut the telegraph line to Europe, and thus prevent the immediate
knowledge of the attack being transmitted to English men-of-war in
the East ? The sending of such a force as 5,000 men would be a
very small matter, so far as the number is concerned ; it would be
absolutely insignificant in comparison with the huge armies of
Russia.
It may be said that our own cruisers in the Pacific and Australian
stations would not be idle. Granted ; but it is also quite conceivable
that their attention might be taken up by the movements of the
heavily-armed Russian men-of-war, which would be pretty sure to
make a diversion to cover the real attack. And it must be borne in
mind that in war nothing is certain, and that every attack implies a
certain amount of risk. The question is?would the benefits arising
from a successful attack on Melbourne be sufficient to warrant the
risk? I believe it would. Assuming that it was successful, the.
victors would not be content with exacting less than �2, 000,000
sterling. They would then separate, and endeavour singly to escape
the English cruisers by seeking some neutral port or by returning
to their own territory. The general result would be, not merely
the fearful destitution to which this colony would be reduced by the
subtraction of so large a sum from its resources, but the utter loss of
prestige which England herself would suffer. On the other hand, if
the attack were unsuccessful, the loss of 5,000 men would be almost
unfelt by the Russian Government, while their vigour and determi-
nation in making such an attack would suffice to keep a large pro-
portion of the English armaments on the defensive, and therefore at
a distance from the Russian coasts. It is not, perhaps, generally
known in this colony that the armaments of Russia on the Pacific
coast are of a very formidable description?much more so than any-
thing England possesses in any portion of the Pacific. In saying
this, of course I am referring only to land armaments. Even 25
years ago the fortifications at Petropavlovski were quite safe against
any attack that England could make. During the Crimean war,
when the strength of the Russian army was very much less than it
is now, an English expedition against that fortress failed most disas-
trously. The fleet was beaten off with heavy loss, the vessels were


seriously damaged, and the commamder, overcome with the heavy
losses he had sustained, committed siuicide. Since then considerable
additions have been made to the fortifiioations, while new and strongly-
fortified posts have been established sat Nikolaevski, by the mouth of
the Amoor, and at Yladivostock, nearly 1,000 miles nearer to Aus-
tralia.
It is madness to shut our eyes to tlhese facts, and to neglect taking
such precautions as will secure us against the calamities that are
absolutely certain if we are attacked in the present state of the
Victorian defences. In the paper whiich I have just read, I proposed
a land force of 2,500 men. When tlhat paper was written, in 1880,
I was aware that the Government off the day contemplated making
sweeping reductions in every branch cof the Government service, and
J felt that it would be hopeless t� ask for any increase of the
expenditure, which at that time amounted to �1:0,000. I could
only hope that the amount for defences would not be seriously
reduced, and therefore drew up a sciheme providing for the largest
efficient force within that limit. I am of opinion, however, that
this colony should maintain a force off 3,000 men in time of peace,
to be increased to 10,000 men in ttime of war?if necessary, by
compulsory enrolment. It must be generally admitted that?the
present defence force of Victoria is ai failure. I have already given
my reasons for this statement in tlhe paper just read. I would
propose, therefore, that as the system under which the Naval Reserve
is enrolled has been an unqualified success, that that system be
extended to the whole of the defence; force of Victoria. The small
amount of payment made to each mian would be sufficient to make
him attend properly to his military dluties ; and although it may be
contended that the sum he receives?wiz., .�l2 a year?is insufficient
for the purpose, yet experience prowes the contrary. The Naval
Reserve turn out regularly for dayllight parades, and remain for
years in the force, thereby acquiring a high degree of efficiency.
And small as the amount of �l2 a yeear may be, yet it comes to 2s.
per hour for every drill they have to attend, an amount which they
would not earn at their trades. I consider that if the system were
extended so as to include 3,000 men hn time of peace, ample protec-
tion would be afforded to the colony from foreign aggression. A
very small permanent force, not exceeding forty men, or just sufficient
to man one gun in each battery, should be maintained to keep the
stores and guns in proper order. Should war be apprehended, the
batteries would be immediately manned by men from the �eneral
defence force, who would then be paid full wages. There can be no
doubt that the system of partial payment, in time of peace, would
cause large numbers of labouring men to join, and they would
willingly, in time of war, enter for the defence of the batteries.
This may be expected with the greater certainty, because at such a
time, probably, there would be some difficulty in obtaining regular
work. It is desirable that the number of men in the permanent
artillery should be as few as possible, partly because they would not
be at all more efficient than the general force under the proposed
system, but chiefly on account of the great expense. The expense
of the permanent artillery, which was abolished in 1880, varied

from �15,000 to �20,000 a year. If that amount were added to
the cost of the staff and general force, it would reach a figure which
Parliament would probably never sanction. And if the choice must
be made between 3,000 men similar to the Naval Reserve, and the
present force backed by 150 artillerymen such as those who were
disbanded, the former is so immeasurably superior as to admit of no
comparison.
A plan somewhat similar to the one proposed has been in operation
in New South Wales and South Australia for some time. During
the last fourteen or fifteen years I have had many opportunities of
seeing the local forces of New South Wales, and until the system of
partial payment was introduced into that colony I had good grounds
for believing that the Victorian forces were far superior. During
my recent visit, however, to Sydney, I found that under the new
system the improvement in the drill and discipline of the force there
was so marked, and placed them so distinctly ahead of the Victorian
forces, that I felt quite ashamed and pained at the contrast. It
cannot be maintained that those colonies are so far in advance of
Victoria as to enable them to maintain a force beyond our powers ;
I believe the truth to be otherwise. And if we regard the matter
from a business point of view?as a matter of insurance against a
heavy calamity?we find that the gross? annual expenditure for
military purposes would not amount to two shillings per head of the
population. Having regard to the wealth of this colony, and the
consequent temptation which it offers to an invader, it seems inex-
cusable that no.suffioient means be adopted to secure its safety. The
policy hitherto followed presents a striking contrast to that of every
civilized state, even in cases where the resources of the state are far
inferior to ours. Thus??
In some of the instances given above it is true that the revenue
exceeds that of "Victoria, but the military force maintained is also
immeasurably greater than any proposed for Victoria, and we may
rest satisfied that if it were known that an efficient force of 3,000
men was maintained here, capable of being increased to 10,000 men
in time of war, the country would be perfectly safe ; no attack
would ever be made upon it. But the maintenance of an inefficient
and insignificant force is a direct invitation for an enemy to make
the attempt.
