Hymn—
6ob f our 15elp !u Hges past/'
(Tune—St. Ann’s.)
f Q GOD, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home ;
Beneath the shadow of Thy Throne
Thy'Saints have dwelt secure ;
Sufficient is Thine Arm alone,
And our defence is sure.
ff Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the Same.
An?. A thousand ages in Thy sight
Are like an evening gone ;
Short as the watch that ends the night
Before the rising sun.
Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
Bears all its sons away ;
They fly forgotten, as a dream
Dies at the opening day.
O God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Be Thou our guard while troubles last,
And our eternal home. Amen.

THE METHODIST CHAPLAIN—
prater.
GOD, with Whom do live the
spirits of them that depart hence in the
Lord, and with Whom the souls of the faithful,
after they are delivered from the burden of the
flesh, are in joy and felicity ; we bless Thy holy
name for all Thy saints departed this life in
Iny faith and fear, especially Thy chosen servant
King Edward, who, by the grace Thou didst
bestow upon him, ever studied to preserve Thy
people committed to his charge in peace and
godliness. We humbly beseech Thee, O Lord,
to grant heavenly consolation to Thy servants,
our Sovereign Lord King George and Queen
Mary, our gracious Queen-Mother Alexandra, the
Duke of Cornwall, and all the Royal Family;
while they mourn the death of one so dear,
may they not sorrow as those without hope for
him who sleeps in Jesus. Endue us all with
grace so to follow Thy blessed saints in all
virtuous and godly living that we may come to
those unspeakable joys which Thou hast prepared
for them that unfeignedly love Thee; through
Jesus Christ our Lord.

THE BAPTIST CHAPLAIN will announce the Hymn
“ flearcr, <Sot>, to £bee.”
(Tune —Horbury. )
mf NEARER, my God, to Thee ?
Nearer to Thee ;
E’en though, it be a cross
That raiseth me ;
GPGSG. Still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
dim. Nearer to Thee.
p Though, like the wanderer,
The sun gone down,
Darkness comes ~ over me,
My rest a stone,
erese. Yet in my dreams I’d be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
dim. Nearer to Thee.
mf There let my way appear
Steps unto Heav’n,
GFGSG. All that Thou sendest me
In mercy given,
Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
dim. . Nearer to Thee.
if Then, with my waking thoughts
Bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs
Beth-el 111 raise;
Bo by my woes to be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
dim. Nearer to Thee. Amen.
