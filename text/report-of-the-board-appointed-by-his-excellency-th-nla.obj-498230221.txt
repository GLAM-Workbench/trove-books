REPORT.
To His Excellency the Governor in Council.
May it please Your Excellency—
We, tlie members of the Board appointed on the 27th July last to
inquire into the extent of the injury caused by sludge from mines,
and the best means of preventing or mitigating future damage, have
now the honour to submit the results of our investigations. It may,
however, be desirable to explain, in the first instance, how the necessity
for making these investigations arose, in order that the drift and scope
of the inquiry may be the better understood. For this purpose it will
be necessary to refer back to the early days of the gold mining industry,
which, commencing in this colony in the year 1851, has.been carried on
without interruption ever since. At that time, and for many years
subsequently, only a very small portion of country Crown lands had
been alienated ; and, if this state of things had continued, the compli-
cations that have since arisen with regard to the disposal of sludge from
mines might have been more easily adjusted. But in the natural course
of settlement, the agricultural and pastoral lands abutting on the creeks
and rivers became private property, and it is to be regretted that the
difficulties connected with the sludge question were not sooner foreseen
and provided for. At the same time, it should be remembered that the
circumstances arising out of the discovery of gold in the colony were
entirely novel to a British community, there having been nothing
analogous in the mother country to furnish a guide or warning. In
those early days, wherever gold was discovered in the colony, the diggers
plied their avocation regardless of future consequences, and thus it came
about that from the earliest times the creeks and rivers were looked upon
as the natural outlets for the debris from the mines, no thought being given
to the ultimate effects of filling up the watercourses. In fact, riparian
rights, to a certain extent, have since been claimed by the miners to have
accrued through long usage. It was not until the year 1872 that the
subject arrested the attention of the land owners immediately concerned;
but even then no attempt was made to mitigate the evil. , At the end of
1885, however, the matter became so alarmingly serious in the Ores wick
and Smeaton districts as to call for immediate action.on the part of the
Government. On the one hand, the mine owners (who were threatened
with Supreme Court •injunctions to restrain them from working their
mines on account of the pollution of the creeks resulting therefrom)
appealed to the Government to introduce a short Act to meet the
difficulty; whilst, on the other hand, the farmers and graziers petitioned
the Legislature to devise some means to prevent the lands which they
had purchased from the State, becoming valueless, as was already the
case in numerous instances. A petition from the farmers at Carisbrook
(which may be taken as typical of others) will be found in Appendix A,
Note.—The figures in the* margin refer to the numbers of the questions in the evidence.

and it must be admitted that its tone is both moderate and conciliatory.
In fact, the subject was felt by all to be, what it certainly is, a most
difficult and delicate one to deal with ; and lienee the necessity became
apparent for a thorough examination of tlie whole question, with a view
to some remedy being suggested which would, be applicable to the
entire colony.
As will be seen from the notes in Appendix B, we made, before
taking any evidence, a careful personal inspection of the principal creeks
and rivers affected, as well as of the mines which are now, or have been,
discharging debris into them. This inspection, together with the evidence
subsequently obtained, and which is attached hereto, showed that the
damage caused by mining sludge throughout the colony is of a far more
serious nature than was generally supposed, whilst it has made manifest
the fact that the injury is likely to be greatly increased in the future, at
least in some districts, unless remedial measures are immediately taken.
The injuries already inflicted, and which, unfortunately, in many
cases, cannot be cured, consist in the filling up of the large clear water-
holes in the creeks and rivers (used for stock and domestic purposes),
the silting up of the river beds, causing the sludge to overflow on the
adjacent lands, to the destruction of vegetation and fruit trees ; the
liability of horses and cattle going to water in the creeks being bogged
in the slum and perishing there, or contracting disease by drinking the
muddy and often mineralized water ; the deterioration in the quality of
the wool of sheep depasturing in the vicinity of the silted-up streams,
by reason of the sand being blown into the fleeces by the wind, and the
depreciation in the value of the lands affected. These, and the destruc-
tion of roads and bridges, are some of the evils arising from the absence
of foresight on the part of the Legislature in years gone by and the
want of care on the part of the miners. It must not, however, be sup-
posed that the whole of the injury, so far as the silting up of streams is
concerned, is due solely to mining operations ; natural causes, such
as the wasting away of the banks during floods, the breaking up of the
soil for agricultural purposes, the making of roads, &c., have contributed
to some extent to the filling up of many watercourses. Yet, the fact of
the highly discoloured waters becoming clear directly sluicing works are
suspended, proves that the matter in suspension is chiefly due to mining
operations.
There are now in operation in the colony several distinct classes of
mining, which, for the purposes of this Report, may be divided into six,
namely:—Quartz mining, deep alluvial, shallow alluvial, ground sluicing,
hydraulic sluicing, and sluicing with the giant nozzle. It will be necessary
to take these classes separately, in order to show the nature and extent of
the injury done by each, the manner in which the injury is caused, and the
means by which future damage maybe prevented or mitigated in each case.
Dealing first with quartz mining , we find from personal inspection,
as well as from the evidence adduced in the several mining centres, that
the quartz tailings can, in nearly every case, and at a comparatively
small cost, be retained on the ground, and that much of the evil arising
from allowing them to enter the creeks can be obviated. In no in-
stances is this more clearly exemplified than in those of the three quartz


miues at Clunes, where the detention of the debris of tailings and pyrites
‘ on the ground could have been effected without difficulty at small cost,
and will be so in future if the companies are compelled to stack. In
fact, these tailings are invariably stacked by mining companies when
they find it necessary to conserve the water for crushing purposes. It
is only when this necessity does not exist that the debris is recklessly
sent into the creeks. To such an extent lias this been done, that, in the
Sandhurst district, the Bendigo Creek has been for a considerable length
almost completely, obliterated by the sludge which continues to be
deposited, at the rate of about six inches per year. In the Ballarat
district, the Yarrowee River has been similarly filled up and the water-
course shifted. In the Loddon district, the same has occurred in the
Deep Creek and in Campbell’s Creek, whilst the Loddon River is very
greatly filled up. In all these cases the injury is increasing year by
year through the accumulation of fresh deposits of sludge.
We have stated that, when it suits their own convenience, mining
companies invariably stack their tailings and retain them on their own
ground, and we think that, where the convenience of others is at stake,
and not alone their convenience but their property and means of liveli-
hood, the mine owners should show some consideration. We do not, of
course, desire to suggest anything which would seriously hamper the
mining industry ; but* it is evident that th 6 present mode of disposing of
the detritus from quartz mines cannot, in fairness or justice, be allowed
to continue. Having carefully considered the subject, the means we
propose of preventing or mitigating future damage arising from this
class of mining are the stacking or impounding of the tailings on the
ground, the cost of which, the evidence shows,- is not prohibitory, the
formation of dams to allow the tailings water from the batteries to
settle, and the -abolition of all sluice-valves at the bottom of the dams,
thus allowing the water to flow off from the top only.
That these precautions, if generally adopted, will prevent much of
the mischief caused by quartz mining operations, we have not the slightest
doubt. In fact, in the cases of Koch’s Pioneer Company, Sandhurst; the
Duchess of Edinburgh, Beehive, Catherine, and other companies at
Eaglchawk; the Frederick the Great Company, Sebastian; Llanberris and
others, Ballarat; Rocky Lead, Creswick, and numerous other companies,
where these precautions are taken to a greater or less extent, the injurious
effects are minimized, and are scarcely noticeable. But it might be asked;
how can companies who have not sufficient ground for the purpose stack
their tailings or form settling dams ? This touches one of the many
difficulties by which the sludge question is surrounded, and points to the
folly of a practice which has prevailed for some years past, namely, that
of permitting areas to be occupied, for residences on land required for
mining purposes, thereby unnecessarily crippling an important industry.
The cases, however, are few, up to the present time, in which the diffi-
culty arising from want of space cannot be overcome, either by running
the tailings into adjacent gullies, by arranging with adjoining companies,
or by constructing silt-reservoirs across some of the old workings.
A few instances will suffice to show what can be done in the way
of stacking on limited spaces. The New Chum and Victoria Company

at Sandhurst have crushed a total of 130,000 tons of quartz, and two-
tliirds of the tailings resulting therefrom have heen stacked on an area of
2 acres, the remaining one-tliird having heen discharged into the creek,
so that 3 acres would have heen sufficient to stack the whole of the
tailings up to the present time. Again, the manager of the New Chum
United Company, Sandhurst, states in his evidence that only one-fiftieth
part of his tailings escapes, although the company crushes 10,000 tons
of quartz per year. In the Castl'emaine district, the Forest. Creek
Wattle Gully Company have treated in 23 years GO,OOO cubic yards of
stuff, a quantity which, if stacked in the same manner as .the tailings of
the New Chum and Victoria Company, would not cover more than Ig-
nores of the total area which the company hold under lease, namely 8
acres. In the case of the Port Phillip Company at Clunes, million
tons of quartz have been crushed during 30 years, and the resulting
tailings, if similarly stacked, would have covered only 15 acres, out of
the large area available, whilst the 8,000 tons of pyrites which the com-
pany have produced during that time would have occupied but little
additional space. As a rule, few mining companies crush more than
4,000 tons of quartz annually, the tailings' from which would only
cover an area of 2 acres to a depth of nine inches per year, and such
areas are usually available if not restricted by the occupation of portions
of the land for roads, residences, &c.
The next branch of mining to be considered is that known as
deep alluvial. The principal injury caused by this class of mining is the
introduction into the streams and creeks of the colony of deleterious
water, with large quantities of sludge and pipe-clay, rendering the water
unfit for stock or domestic purposes, besides so filling the creeks as to
to render it dangerous for stock to approach them on account of the
liability of sheep and cattle to getting bogged, as well as the injury
to vegetation on the adjoining low-lying lands.
The remedy in this case consists also in stacking the sludge in a
series of dams at the mines to settle the water before passing it into the
creeks.
That this can be effectually accomplished, is well exemplified by the
operations of the Hepburn Estate. and Hepburn Consols Companies at
Smeaton, the Midas Company at Sulky Gully, the New Buninyong
Company at Buninyong, Britt’s old workings at Huntly, &c. In fact,
in all instances where the land owners have insisted upon the sludge
being stacked, the companies have effected (or propose to effect) this,
notwithstanding the additional cost to be entailed;
There is, doubtless, a difficulty in settling pipe-clay sludge, and it
is probably impossible to so far effect it as to remove discolouration
from the water; but there is no doubt, from known instances, that
by the use of three or more settling dams consecutively, the resulting
water may be discharged in a condition fit for stock. If a small pro-
portion only of pipe-clay is suspended in the discharged water, the
channels soon become clear after the cessation of mining operations, this
being amply shown by the watercourse in the neighbourhood of the
New Buninyong Company in the Ballarat district.


Some of the agriculturalists recognize the fact that it would be
injurious to the community to press objections to discolouration of the
water by mining, and agree that, were the mining companies to adopt
measures to ensure the best method of stacking the sludge, there would
not be any serious ground for complaint on the part of the farming
interest.
Shallow alluvial mining inflicts injuries on the adjacent creeks
and agricultural land similar to those caused by deep alluvial; but the
quantity of sludge now discharged is comparatively small, and it is not
composed in the same manner of so large a proportion of pipe-clay.
This class of mining is usually carried on in localities which in
former years afforded remunerative employment to a large number of
diggers, hut many of these localities have long since been worked out and
almost abandoned, the number of miners now employed being very few.
Where operations are carelessly conducted, such as by placing the
debris on the sides of or in watercourses (as in the case of the Loddon
River above Newstead),much injury is caused; but, with care, these evils
could not only be prevented, but in many cases actual benefit can be
derived from the judicious diversion of the sludge from puddlers’ dams.
At White Hills, near' Sandhurst, for instance, is a large plot of
land, part of old alluvial workings, filled with puddlers’ sludge, on
which there are now a number of thriving fruit trees and an excellent
crop. The Eaglehawk public gardens also afford a good example
of what can be done to improve the land occupied by abandoned
alluvial workings by the judicious use of sludge and tailings from the
adjacent mines.
Mining under the head of sluicing has next to be considered, and,
for convenience, it is divided into ground sluicing, hydraulic sluicing,
and sluicing with the giant nozzle. Under the head of ground sluicing
is included all sluicing effected without the use of hydraulic pressure
—such as sluicing in the bed of a creek or river, or by passing the water
over the surface and washing away the material by its weight and force,
with or without sluice-boxes.
The sluicing in the Castlemaine, Sandhurst, Daylesford and Bal-
larat districts comes under this head, as also, with two exceptions, the
sluicing in the Beecliworth district, and that at Omeo and in the neigh-
bourhood of Bright. . • .
This class of mining is, as now carried on, productive, in a great
many cases, of more injury than gain. In the Beecliworth district it is
a staple industry, and employment is given to a large number of miners
and others; but in the Loddon valley and along Forest, Fryer’s, and
Campbell’s Creeks, and even in' the case of the larger works at
Heatheote, the disadvantage outbalances any gold-producing advantage
to the. general community. For instance, at Chewton, we found that
about 6 acres of land, with an average depth of 30 feet, amounting in
all to about 300,000 cubic yards, w r ere sent into the creek during the
past twelve years, the results giving barely wages to a party of from
two to four men. Again, at Heatlicote, we found that, though the injury
to the Mclvor Creek is such as to have called forth most serious

representations to tlie Government, yet tlie number ot men actually
obtaining employment on tlie works lias not latterly exceeded eight men
during a period of only four months in the year.
The only way to prevent an increase of the evils connected with
this class of mining is to attach conditions to any future water-right
licenses for sluicing purposes, to exempt the lands abutting on rivers
from occupation under miners’ rights, and to grant'such lands on lease in
. cases only where it can be shown that the sludge can be stacked on the
ground or diverted from the rivers, the lessees to be required by
covenant to observe these conditions.
Hydraulic sluicing is that effected by the use of water under pres-
sure directed against the alluvial deposit by means of pipes or canvas
hose with nozzles, and is only distinguished from sluicing with the giant
nozzle by the usually smaller character of the work. It is practised in
the Omeo, Beech worth, Mitta Mitta, Castlemaine and Heathcote dis-
tricts. In the Heathcote district, the Mclvor Creek is most injuriously
filled ; in the Beech worth district, Beid’s and Hodgson’s Creeks are
partly obliterated, and the Ovens Biver is silted up; whilst at Omeo
the Livingstone Creek is choked with tailings and sludge.
A large quantity of water under pressure is used in the operations
which come under this head; and the amount of stuff held in suspension
and carried for long distances down the creeks is proportionately great,
resulting in the filling up of the streams and rivers to such an extent
as to cause them to overflow their banks and leave a deposit on the
low-lying lands, which, though not injurious in thin layers on rich soil,
is absolutely .destructive to vegetation when deposited on inferior soil
or in thick .. The remedy we propose in this case is to turn the
sluicing water from the tail-races into old workings or side gullies, the
effect of which would be to convert these localities from arid wastes,
as they are now, into fertile and reproductive lands, and at the same
time to free the valuable creeks and rivers of the colony from the dele-
terious substances for which they are now the receptacles. Where
such is impracticable, the remedies previously described must be applied.
As regards the value of the gold obtained from such sluicing opera-
tions, the results are, in many cases, unsatisfactory to the colony at
large. For instance, from the report of Mr. Mining Begistrar Lake, it
appears that from 50,000 cubic yards of dirt which the Union Company
cast into the Biver Mitta Mitta but 760 z,. of gold were obtained, or at a
rate of only loz. for each 660 cubic yards. Thus a quantity that
would fill a creek for 15 miles in length, 30 feet wide, and 3 feet deep,
would represent a money value in gold of only 4000 z., or about £1,400.
Yet the injury caused to the adjacent lands is very great, rendering
the water dangerous for approach by Stock and unfit for domestic
consumption.
Here we cannot help touching upon the great irrigation experiment
to which the colony is now committed, for it is certainly intimately
connected with the sludge question. It is our opinion, formed after
having inspected many of the rivers and creeks of the colony, that, if
the present mode of disposing of sludge is not discontinued, the time is
not far distant when the waters will be rendered unfit for irrigation


purposes, as tliey will be found to deposit thin layers of tenacious slum
—like a coating of cement—which, instead of being an aid to the cultiva-
tion and growth of grasses and cereals, will be most prejudicial to them.
Nor is this all. The expensive weirs which are either already made, in
course of formation, or contemplated in various parts of the colony,
will ultimately become mere silt traps for the retention of the debris
brought down from the mines, and will become useless for the purposes
for which they are intended.
The last branch of mining to be considered is sluicing by means
of the giant nozzle. This system of mining has of late years been
introduced into the Mitta Mitta and Cobungra districts from California,
where it is known as “placer mining.” By means of it, the quantity of
stuff that can be sent into the rivers is enormous. At present, there are
only three* of these nozzles at work in the colony, each of which
displaces a ton of earth per minute, working day and night; but it is
proposed shortly to increase the number to twelve, in' which case not
less than 7,000 cubic yards per day of 24 hours will be discharged into
the River Mitta Mitta. This amounts in one year to 2,000,000 cubic
yards, sufficient to fill a stream 105 feet wide to a depth of three feet
for a distance of 32 miles in twelve months. As a counterpoise to this
threatened danger to the rivers of the colony,, what, it may be asked,
are the advantages which the general community reaps from the intro-
duction of the Californian system ? Sluicing requires, as we have
shown, the employment of but comparatively few miners, whilst, with
the use of the giant nozzle, the proportion which the labour employed
bears to the quantity of material removed is infinitely less. In Cali-
fornia, the system has recently been prohibited by law, in consequence
of the immense damage done to agriculture, and, according to the State
Mineralogist of the Mining Bureau of that country, the prohibition is
not likely to be removed “until some method of placer mining is
devised which will admit of the working of the great auriferous beds of
the State without injury to other interests.” In the face of this, and
seeing that the giant nozzle has only recently been introduced into this
colony, we are of opinion that this is the proper time to regulate its
further use in Victoria, before further damage is done or further
vested interests accrue. No such remedy as stacking can be applied in
the case of placer mining, nor, as far as we are aware, are there any
means of mitigating the enormous injury which a continuance of that
system of mining threatens.
In the case of the Pioneer Company, on the Mitta Mitta, the evil
is now in progress, as the sludge water is delivered direct into the river,
carrying no less than 1,300 cubic yards of material per day. In the case
of the proposed Long Point Company the sludge must also immediately
find its way into the river, and such action as is possible to prevent the
continuance of the injury should be at once taken, for, if allowed to
continue until the expiration of the present lease, the damage done will
be very serious.
In the case, of the Cobungra Company, the distance along
which the sludge has to pass before reaching the junction of the
Snowy Creek and Mitta Mitta River is such that comparatively

slight injury will result during tlie remaining term of the lease ; hut, on
its expiration, an examination of the injuries to the watercourses and
adjoining lands should he made, and, if found to he serious, covenants
should’ he included in the new leases to compel the companies to make
provision for the retention of the sludge. In the case of the Mammoth
Company the material operated upon- is of such a character (granite
drift) that it will he discharged in large quantities at a very rapid rate
into the river, and steps should be taken to insure that the action of the
company shall not result in excessive injury to the adjacent land and
watercourses.
From our experience of various abandoned mines, where the sludge
had been stacked—such as the New Buninyong Estate, Britt’s Company,
the large workings near Alma township, and other instances—it is
evident that the cost of maintenance of the sludge banks of alluvial
mines, after abandonment by the companies, will he nominal; and the
same may he said of sludge from sluicing claims deposited on areas
outside the watercourse, as well as of the stacks of quartz tailings.
Provided mining companies are prohibited from depositing sludge
in storm-water courses, the cost of maintenance will he so small
that it might he effected when necessary by day labour employed by
the State. But in no case should the dams he allowed to cross the
water channels without adequate independent provision for the discharge
of storm-water, otherwise, the maintenance after abandonment of the
claim might become a tax upon the State; and it should be one of the
covenants of every mining lease that the stacks of sludge should be
maintained and left in good order, and jjrotected by sufficient drains;
Whatever remedies are applied, it is not to be expected that the
water passed off from impounding the tailings or sludge will be absolutely
clear, but it may be made sufficiently so to be fit for use by stock, and even
for domestic purposes, by filtration; whilst to mere discolouration, during
the period the mines are at work, the farming interest is not opposed.
In the cases of existing mines on which it is impossible to effect a
remedy for the nuisance created by the debris , it becomes a question
whether the injury being done to the lands and watercourses is not
greater than the benefits conferred # on the community by the value of
the gold obtained. Where such would appear to be the case, it is
worthy of consideration whether the State should not resume possession
of the land; and, in cases where a remedy is possible, a new lease could
be issued on conditions embodying the proposed remedy.
As before stated, the difficulties in. dealing with the sludge question
would have been far less had action been taken at an earlier date, and
that it was not is greatly due to a want of energy on the part of several
of the local bodies, who permitted the evil to increase and assume such
formidable dimensions without any attempt to check its growth. Thus
the miners were permitted to act as best suited themselves without
reference to the injuries unnecessarily caused, until they appear to
consider they have prior rights to the detriment of agriculturists and
others.
The difficulties can apparently be overcome without serious loss to
the mining community if, on the one hand, mine-owners will consider


tlie injury that a want of care in stacking the debris produces, and
adopt the best measures to prevent a continuance of the system of
passing it into the watercourses ; and if, on the other hand, the land-
holders will see the necessity of leaving the mining interest as little
trammelled as iDOSsible, accepting mere discolouration of water as
inevitable during the period the mines are at work. .
In conclusion, the opinions and recommendations of the Board on
the difficult and intricate problem submitted to them may be summarised
as follows: .
1. That the Inspectors of Mines throughout the colony should
be appointed Inspectors of Sludge in their respective
districts.
2. That every mining company should be required to make such
provision for the retention of debris as, in the opinion of the
local Inspector, will enable the resultant water to flow
therefrom without detriment to public or private interests.
3. That no sluices from the bottom of any sludge or settling dam
should be permitted.
4. That provision should be made for the maintenance by the
State of all sludge or tailings banks after the cessation, of
the mining operations.
5. That no mining company should be permitted to construct a
sludge, tailing, or water conservation dam in any watercourse
without provision being made for the flood waters of such
course being carried independent of such dam.
6. That no permission to mine by sluicing should. in future be
granted until the lessee has given proof that he can obtain
an area sufficient to retain and settle the sludge.
7. That all Crown lands adjoining running streams should, be re-
served from mining operations to such distance or height
above the running stream as may, by the Inspector, be deemed
sufficient to jjermit of retention of the sludge.
8. That the Inspector be empowered to decide in what manner a
mining company should be required to provide for the dis-
posal of debris.
9. That the Inspector of Mines in any district, upon receiving a
written complaint, from any resident or owner of land
therein, to the effect that he suffers or anticipates injury
; from mining operations to his land or stock, by reason of
the injurious effect of sludge discharged from mines on
such land or into the watercourse, or by reason of injury to
roads, bridges, channels, or other works, by such operations,
should inquire into such complaint, make an examination
of the locality affected and of the mining operations, and
report thereon to the Minister of Mines, recommending
such course as, in his opinion, will remedy or mitigate the
evil complained of.
Conclusion.

Note 15.

Note 5.


10. That prior to* the issue of any new water-right license or lease
for mining purposes the Inspector for the district should
ascertain and report to the Minister of Mines upon the
means to he adopted to prevent deterioration of the water-
courses and other injuries by the proposed mining operations,
in order that the necessary covenants may be introduced
into the new leases.
These recommendations we have embodied in a draft Bill
(Appendix C), and we are of opinion that it should be passed into law
as early as practicable, with, of course, such amendments, additions,
or alterations as Your Excellency’s advisers and the wisdom of
Parliament mjiy decide upon.
We have the honor to be,
Your Excellency’s most obedient Servants,

1. That the chief industry of Clunes consists in working the gold-bearing reefs of that place, and
that the quartz after being crushed, and the gold extracted, creates refuse or sludge, which is ejected into
the creek to a great and alarming extent.
2. That so large is the quantity of this deleterious matter that has been and is continued to be
thrown in, that, during the past few years, deep waterlioles that formerly served as natural reservoirs
during the drought of summer, are now completely filled up, and in some parts, for miles in succession, no
water can be obtained during that season.
3. That the essential point of our memorial, however, is to draw your attention to the immense
amount of damage done to the farmers and others by the deposit of sludge upon the alluvial flats, by the
periodical inundation of the creek.
4. That many of us have lost as much as twenty to one hundred acres of our best land, by its
having been covered, in some places two feet deep, by the drift from the quartz-crushing companies of •
Clunes.
5. That we beg to inform you that the sludge in question is of the most deleterious nature, that it
contains qualities highly inimical to vegetable life, and that nothing will grow upon the land after its
deposit.
6. That we may here also observe that the creek water, in consequence of the impurities it contains,
is rendered totally unfit for human consumption, and that neither f@r culinary nor lavatory purposes can it
be used until it has undergone a tedious and expensive mode of purification.
7. That taking into consideration the vast expenditure the Government has been put to for
“ Water Supply/’ aud the numerous and extensive reserves that have been proclaimed for the ostensible
purpose of water accommodation, it would indeed be a great anomaly were the natural streams allowed to
be polluted aud filled up with the sludge and debris of mining companies.
8. . That we are fully sensible that the industry of gold mining should be fostered and encouraged,
still we cannot but feci it an injustice that one section of the community, many of whom at present are
residents of other lands, should reap wealth and fortune at the expense and ruin of others, particularly
when the great cause of the mischief can be obviated.
9. That we would most respectfully suggest that an order be issued that the respective gold companies
should retain their tailings on the surface of their own leases, as this could be effected at little cost, the
machinery that is now used to eject it into the creek being adapted for turning it on their own land.
10. That your memorialists, in conclusion, humbly submit that the boon they solicit is but that one
of the good gifts of Providence may reach their homesteads in its purity, and free from injurious polluting
influences placed in it by the gold-mining companies of Clunes.
And your memorialists, trusting that the boon they ask may be granted, as in duty bound, will ever
pray, &c.
APPENDIX B.
NOTES BY THE BOARD DURING PERSONAL INSPECTIONS.
THE RIVER LODDON AND TRIBUTARIES.
The tributaries conveying sludge and silt from mining operations into the River Loddon are:—
Into Campbell's Creek.
1. Forest Creek—Sluicing and quartz.
2. Wattle Gully—Quartz.
8. Barker’s Creek—Sluicing.
Into Loddon River.
4. Campbell’s Creek—Sluicing and quartz.
5. Fryer’s Creek—Sluicing and quartz.
6. Jim Crow Creek—Sluicing and quartz.
Into Creswick Creek.
7. Slaty Creek—Sluicing.
8. Glen Donald Creek—Alluvial.
Into Deep Creek.
9. Creswick Creek.
10. Birched Creek.
Into Loddon River.
11. Deep or Tullaroop Creek.
12. Alma Creek, into Bet Bet.
13. Bet Bet Creek, into Bet Bet.
14. Loddon River.


1. Forest Creek.
The amount of sluicing is now not largo, only one company being at work on the Red and
Montgomery Hills. The system of working is with canvas hose discharging Coliban water. The face
runs to 35 feet in height, and several years’ work are anticipated. No attempt is made to impound
sludge, but there is neither area nor fall to admit of it. Sluicing has been continuing here during
the past twelve years, during which between four and five acres have been sluiced, and nearly 300,000
cubic yards of filling have consequently been delivered into Forest Creek, and the prospective work will
deliver nearly a million cubic yards more. The number of men employed is stated to be from two to four.
Of future work it appears there should be, at the same rate, about nine years' prospective work, and over
fifteen years’ in the adjoining sluicing claim.
2. Wattle Gully.
In Wattle Gully are three quartz mines, the tailings and silt from which were partly stacked
in the gully in order to form ponds for impounding water, and the storm water was conveyed in a channel
along the slope of the gully. They now, however, discharge direct into the watercourse, the former
settling dams having been broken through, and thus about 50 stamps are now delivering into the gully
and thence into Forest Creek. Into Forest Creek the Manchester Company discharge mu oh sludge from
their battery; yet it is so situated that small inexpensive dams in the gully would impound the whole
of the silt and enable the water to run off clear.
3. Barker’s Creek.
The only sluicing at present in progress is by one party of 'men employed by Mr. Gaylard, in
Specimen Gully, on a 60-acre lease. The Coliban race supplies the water, which is used over the surface
without a hose.
An attempt has been made here to stack the tailings, but none to settle the sludge; this, however,
would be difficult, as the level of the bed-rock on which the tail-race boxes rest is but little above that of
the creek.
Mr. Gaylard anticipates many years’ work, and is of opinion that, on the further introduction of
Coliban water, sluicing will be extended largely into other gullies—an opinion shared by Mr. Elsdon, the
officer in charge of the Coliban races.
4. Campbell’s Creek.
There is not at present any sluicing on the Bald Hills on the Muckleford side of Campbell’s Creek,
but it is probable that a large area will hereafter be operated upon ; but so great a width of moderate flat
land intervenes to the creek that there should not be any insuperable difficulty in impounding tailings
and settling the sludge.
5. Fryer’s Creek.
This creek is the receptacle for the tailings and silt of several quartz mines from the head of the
creek—the Anglo-Australasian, Duke of Cornwall, and others. Settling dams have been made across the
creek, but during.a storm all the dams were destroyed and the silt carried down the creek. A large
quantity, however, still remains, but is being partly cut away by rains, filling the bed of the creek lower
down.
Three parties are sluicing, two only to a limited extent; one, however, in Nuggety Gully, is sluicing
with'a large quantity of water from the Loddon Water Company, falling over the edge of the face. The
face is about 25 feet deep, and area large, and as the bottom is but little above the creek, there is no oppor-
tunity to impound tailings or settle the sludge, so that the former fills Fryer’s Creek, passing down the
latter during rains into the Loddon at Vaughan.
The sludge from the sluices is found many miles down the Loddon.
On completion of the Coliban races round the watershed of Fryer’s Creek, more extended sluicing
operations are anticipated, if water is- obtainable, all tending to fill and discolour the Loddon.
Mr. Appleton, even at Eddington, attributes the discolouration greatly to this sluicing, as the water
becomes clearer after the days when sluicing is discontinued.
0. Jim Crow Creek.
This creek conveys silt and sludge from sluicing and mining at Daylesford aud Yandoit.
The junction mine of the latter is on the edge of the creek, and, being alluvial, with small area in
which to stack sludge, difficulty would bo found in keeping it out of the creek. The tailings could easily
be stacked more thoroughly than at present.
The sluicing near Yandoit is but small, but there have been large works supplied with water from
a race from the Deep Creek, and a large area may yet be sluiced.
7. Slaty Creek, Creswick.
On this creek, which forms the head of Creswick Creek, very extensive sluicing works have been
carried out, and, with ample water, considerable operations may again be undertaken.
At present, not more than twenty men are sluicing in the creek, but even these are sending down
a large quantity of sludge. One party working near the head have a face some 30 feet deep, supplied by a
race tapping the head of the creek, and anticipate many years of prospective work.
Two other parties sluicing above Cabbage Tree Flat have anticipated work for ten years with a
face of, say, 25 feet.
No boxes are used in this creek, on account of the tenacious character of the clay ; all are ground
sluicing.
There does not appear to be any means of stacking sludge near the works, and to construct
impounding sludge dams across the main Slaty Creek nearer Creswick would be costly.
A large quantity of silt has been and is being carried down the creek by the winter rains.


8. Creswick Creek.
• The Glen Donald Creek, which discharges through the small township of llollingWQod, receives the
sludge from the following deep alluvial mines : —Lone Hand, Lord Harry, Madame Berry, and Australa-
sian Extended, Davis Nos. 1 and 2, and Australasian Eaglehawk Companies.
The three former convey the sludge for a considerable distance in races, and after some attempt at
impounding, but the latter deliver direct into the creek without any settling dams.
• In all the cases the sludge dams might be enlarged, and banks made higher, and thus rendered suffi-
ciently effective ; but at present sludge is run off consisting of a thick pipe-clay.
Creswick Creek, above the junction with Glen Donald Creek, is merely discoloured by sluicing
water, and partially filled, but below the junction the creek is much injured. Bell’s Company, near
Creswick, deliver direct into Creswick Creek, but the operations are of a smaller character.
9. Clunes.
At Clunes, on the Creswick Creek, are three batteries .belonging to the Port Phillip Mining
Company, with 80 stamps ; South Clunes United, with 60 ; and New North Clunes, with 30 stamps, all of
which deliver the tailings direct into the creek without any attempt at settlement.
From the first-named company alone 1,310 thousand cubic yards of material have been sent into the
creek, which has been thus much filled. The water from the pyrites works is also sent direct into the
creek, causing much unnecessary injury, and delivering some 8,000 tons into the creek.
Yet the tailings and pyrites refuse might have been kept out of the creek without difficulty or
serious cost.
The result is that, whilst Birche’s Creek is clear, the Creswick Creek is very much filled with quartz
tailings, in addition to the sludge from the Allendale mines and the results of past sluicing from Creswick,
and the water is thus rendered unfit for stock, whilst the deposit spread over the low-lying lands during
flood time is destructive.
The question of stacking the tailings and pyrites in these three mines appears never to have been
considered. No complaints were made by the local bodies, nor action taken by those injured, and thus the
mine owners did not give thought to the amount of injury they were, according to the evidence of the
.managers, needlessly causing in the creek.
10. Birciie’s Creek.
No damage has as yet occurred to Birche’s Creek, the mines from which such is feared in the future
being as yet only prospective. Settling dams, passing the sludge from one into the other, will probably
effect sufficient settlement to admit of the water, though discoloured, being passed from several mines into
Birche’s Creek, below the water-supply weir, without detriment to stock. Some of the mine waters are
•brackish, but not excessively, and would not affect the creek water, excepting during the dry period, and
at that time the natural creeks are more or less so.
Between the Smeaton Reserve United Company and the Rocky Lead Company, however, the ground
is taken up for future mining operations, but no company is as yet at work. The natural drainage will be
into Birche’s Creek, which is the present water channel for the water supply of Clunes • between the
reservoir and the weir.
Should the Water Supply Commission, however, extend the pipes from the weir to the reservo’r,
so as to avoid the future introduction into Clunes of the objectionable drainage - now being passed in from
Smeaton and other mining townships, this difficnlty will cease.
The Hepburn Consols Company and Hepburn No. 1 have been successful in stacking the sludge,
only discoloured water being passed from them into a creek sufficiently clear for stock, no complaints
from those living on that creek having been made.
The Hepburn Estate Company will retain the whole of the sludge in a natural basin on the lease.
11. Deep or Tdllaroop Creek.
The Deep Creek, receiving the discharge of the Creswick, MacCallum’s, and Sandy Creeks, is much
silted up, and filled with quartz, sand, and slum, the old creek bed, near Bucknall’s P.R., being filled up
level, and the water passing along a new channel.
This creek receives the discharge of the Sandy Creek, into which passes the surplus water from the
Kong Meng Company. This company has so stacked the sludge as to show that it can, with more care, be
satisfactorily accomplished, and the water can be taken away sufficiently clear from the top of the dam.
The deposit of sludge and silt is very great at Carisbrook, and continues to the Loddon at its junc-
tion at Eddington, the value of the property fronting the creek being greatly depreciated. Along the line
of the creek, through the properties of Mr. Bucknall and others, the trees in the watercourse have died,.
being killed, it is stated, by the water discharged from the Clunes quartz mines, and the injury to the low-
lying lands is shown by the evidence to be very serious.
Future injury to this creek, beyond that due to the deposit already in the watercourse, may be
almost prevented by insistance on effectually stacking of the sludge from both the quartz and alluvial
mines, the sluicing works in Slaty Creek being of too limited a character to seriously affect the creek.
12. Alma Creek.
The workings on this creek above the Duke Consols have been abandoned, but at one time sent large
quantities of silt into the creek, which is still being added to, and washed by storms into the Bet Bet Creek.
The Duke Consols delivers a large stream of very brackish water direct into the creek, and
discharges sludge over the paddocks without any endeavour to impound, and yet the slope at which it
remains shows that no difficulty would be met with in retaining the sludge within proper limits.


13. Bet Bet Creek.
On this creek is situated the Duke and Timor mine, discharging much sludge and scum into the
creek. Very imperfect attempts are made to dam the sludge, by which the creek is much injured, and the
quantity carried down during flood time to the Loddon is very considerable; yet there is sufficient space for
construction of the necessary dams, which could be rendered effective without serious cost to the company.
The creek has been so filled that the low-lying lands down to the Loddon are covered at every
storm, and much injury is done by the deposit of slum and sludge, whilst the water from the mines is so
brackish as to render the water of the creek unfit for domestic use.
The remedy here lies in compelling the miners at Timor to effectually stack the sludge and deliver
the water clear.
14. The Loddon River.
At Eddington, below the junction of the Loddon and the Deep Creek, the water is highly
discoloured, and throws a heavy deposit of silt of sandy clay, filling up the waterholes. One hole is
stated to have filled up 25 feet in fifteen years, and it is stated that a flood lasting for two'days will deposit
6 inches in depth. The water becomes quite clear during dry weather and when sluicing is discontinued ;
and the deposit on the banks is stated as one foot average per year, but part of this is due to the natural
disintegration of the soil and washing away during rains.
The filling-up is considerable at Jane Yale, some five miles lower down the river from Eddington ;
hut at Newbridge, though the water is much discoloured, the deposit of silt in the river bed does not appear
to be very heavy, and it does not appear as yet to have travelled further doAvn than Mr. Ramsey’s property.
The deposit is stated by the latter to be a good fertilizer, and is not in any way objected to.
At Bridgewater the river is not silted up as yet, so that the whole injury to the Loddon caused by
sludge may be regarded as terminated at this place for the present.
There is no remedy possible to prevent the continuance of the evil by the passage down the river of
the material already deposited in it excepting by construction of costly silt reservoirs ; but if the intro-
duction of fresh deposits be prevented in the mining districts, the. river would in time resume somewhat its
former condition.
SANDHURST DISTRICT.
The following are the creeks conveying sludge and silt from mining operations ; the workings are
in quartz, with but little sluicing and very little alluvial:—
Into Bendigo Creek.
Golden Gully.
Sludge Channel from New Chum line.
Ironbark Gully.
Long Gully.
California Gully.
Into Myers Creek.
Pegleg Gully.
Sailors’.
Devonshire.
Sebastian.
15. Golden Gully.
A large hank of tailings was constructed in this gully by the G. G. Consolidated Company and
others ; but no care having been extended to the banks, the impounded silt is being carried down the gully
to the Bendigo Creek.
The quartz mines, such as Shenandoah, evidently permitted all silt to flow into the creek, and
the Railway Company, which at one period stacked the silt, now permits it to be washed by mine or
rain waters, and also by the water from the Eureka Company, into the Bendigo Creek, and yet no difficulty
whatever exists to prevent the restoration of the silt dam banks and the diversion of the mine waters.
The sludge channel from the New Chum line delivers a large quantity of sludge, which should he
retained in the sludge dams on the claims.
The mining companies make effective arrangements in most cases for retention of the silt; but when
the dams become full, the managers, instead of enlarging and raising the dams, too frequently empty them
by sluices near the ground level, and thus deliver enormous quantities of tailings into the creeks, the excuse
advanced for such action being want of space on which to construct settling or tailings dams.
16. Myers Creek.
The United Devonshire and Duchess of Edinburgh Companies are situated at the head of Devon-
shire Gully; but the arrangements for stacking the silt are so admirable that only clear water passes down
the gully, which is at the head entirely free from sludge, and yet the first-named company has to disburse
£3 royalty per week for permission to transfer the tailings.
In Sailors’ Gully, the settling dams of Clarke’s Company are such that the silt is completely
retained, notwithstanding that the sludge, having a large admixture of slate, is difficult to deal with ; and
the Catherine Company is also effectively retaining the silt.
At Sebastian, the Frederick the Great mine, although crushing 100 tons per day, proves that silt
and sludge can be stacked and impounded, and although much slum results from crushing slate, the arrange-
ments are so good that the water discharged is clear. The mine waters are chalybeate and brackish.
17. Bendigo Creek.
The creek opposite Mr. Ruedon’s, at Huntly, has been filled up with quartz sludge and tailings, and
the filling extends for four miles or so, becoming more general opposite Huntly, where the watercourse is
completely obliterated, and sludge deposited to a width of a quarter of a mile on each side of the former
channel, it is said, at a rate of about six inches per year.


The largest deposit of silt is brought in by the Eagleliawk Creek, which, eighteen years ago, was
excavated to a depth of six feet, but is now but two feet below the general surface.
Fui ther down, at Fruhling road, the sludge has blocked the watercourse up to level of floor of the
bridge over the former creek channel, which was about 12 feet deep.
The filling-up, owing to the sludge, has reached to below Bagshot, at the crossing of the Murray
road, and some portions have been carried down by floods to below G-oornong.
Near Huntly are the works of a former company, managed by Mr. Britt, on which operations were
suspended in about 1880. The sludge appears in this case to have been carefully and successfully
impounded ; the former sludge dams are now grassed over, and no deposit appears to have occurred on the
adjoining lands.
At White Hills is a large plot of fenced-in land, part of old workings filled level with puddlers’
sludge, on which is a good crop and many fruit trees. Mr. Ruedon also considers the sludge from the
Bendigo Creek excellent for vines if the further deposit is prevented, but is prevented from planting by
the recurring deposits.
The Eagleliawk public gardens also afford an excellent example of what can be done to improve
old workings by the judicious use of sludge and tailings.
18. Heathcote.
Large sluici"-?. operations by Mr. Hedley are in progress, and have been for the past four years.
It is assumed that there is work for fifty years to come, and the quantity of tailings and sludge now being
passed direct into the creek is very large. The working face reaches to 20 feet, and scarcity in the supply
of water, owing to past dry seasons, alone restricts the amount of work done.
If a dam or dams were made in the valley of the old workings in Commissioner’s Flat, and the
sluice water introduced through a cutting across the saddle between this flat and workings, the sludge
could be utilized with advantage in filling the old holes and levelling the surface ; and, if the cutting and
dam were made, the cost of maintenance and raising the latter as required would not be great.
In a similar manner, a considerable proportion of the sludge from the proposed workings in Long
Gully can be retained in one or more dams constructed across the gully, just above the crossing of High-
street, without interfering with the workings; but neither of these suggestions can be adopted unless the
.areas required for settlement of the sludge are reserved from occupation for mining or other purposes.
Hedley, in evidence, states the number of men employed by him as seven or eight this year, and a
maximum of twelve last year, working eight hours during a period, at the most, of nine months in the year.
The Meadows’ Yalley Sluicing Company, again, never employ more than seven men, and for less than
three months in the year.
In both cases, the managers admit the serious evils caused by the sludge from their works, but give
reasons why they are powerless to prevent or mitigate them ; and, as they are working under miners’ rights,
and not under leases, there is, under the existing law, no control whatever upon their operations, unless
action can be taken on the ground of injury caused by discharge of their debris into the creeks, and to this
Mr. Hedley demurs, on the ground that the creek had been used for mining purposes since the first Mclvor
rush. Both companies anticipate many years of future work, and the injuries they will cause to the
landed interest will be very great if they are permitted to continue to work in the years to come as in the
past.
BEECHWORTH DISTRICT.
19. Beechworth.
20. Wangaratta.
21. Yackandandah.
22. Allan’s Flat.
23. Snowy Creek.
24. Mitta Mitta.
25. Cobungra.
2G. Omeo.
19. Beechworth District. '
The mines are all sluicing claims, mostly working ground previously worked, and* not any attempts
have been made to stack the sludge beyond what is necessary to obtain clearer water for sluicing operations.
There are many years of prospective work, and should a larger supply of water be introduced, the
sluicing operations will be greatly extended.
The old Nine-mile Creek is completely filled with tailings and sludge from previous claims of years
past, .now covered with saplings and scrub, and being re-sluiced by two companies.
Above Stanley, Mr. Simson has a crushing plant to crush for neighbouring reefs. The stacking of
tailings is very imperfect. The ownei 1 , however, has only a permission to occupy part of a mining lease,
and states that the impossibility of stacking all the tailings and sludge is due entirely to the action of the
licensees in restricting him both as to area of ground occupied by the tailings heaps and the height to
which they may be raised.
On the Three-mile Creek are several companies. The tailings are spread out at end of boxes ;
but no attempt is made to stack the sludge, excepting in two claims. On one, Busch and Co. constructed
a service dam 15 feet deep, which became a sludge dam, and kept the sludge back satisfactorily until filled.
In the adjoining claim, owned by Mr. Pund, the sludge is stacked to a considerable extent in the old work-
ings, in order to obtain clearer water; but on the next, or Break of Day claim, the service dams have proved
excellent sludge dams, completely keeping back the sludge until full. *
The Rocky Mountain and Fletcher’s claims have both many years of prospective work, and
discharge a large quantity of water containing sludge into Spring Creek, whence it flows ‘into a water
conservation dam used by the Excelsior company on the Woolshed.


This dam shows that the sludge cau be effectually stacked if the settling area is sufficiently large,
for the greater proportion settles immediately the water is at rest, and is not again easily moved by storm
water. The same is shown by the two water conservation dams previously mentioned, and it would appear
that, by carefully utilizing the available land in old workings and flats as settling areas, a very considerable
portion of the sludge now being passed into the Ovens down Rede’s Creek could be intercepted, as proposed
by Mr. Mining Surveyor Davidson and referred to in his evidence.
The Board suggests that the question of the disposal of the sludge from the works be carefully
considered before the application of the company on the Woolshed Creek be granted, for, as is shown
hereafter and in the evidence, Rede’s Creek, into which this company will deliver the sludge, is already
destroyed, and further injury to the lands both on the creek and on the Ovens River is anticipated without
the addition of further sludge from the large contemplated new works.
20. Wangaratta. ;
Rede's Creek is so much filled that, in the property of Mr. Charlton, about four miles above Wan-
garatta, the old watercourse is completely obliterated by the deposit of sludge, and a new channel has been
formed. The deposit reaches to the top of the old boundary fence on the property, and a further deposit
occurs with every heavy rain.
At the crossing of the Tarrawingee road and Rede’s Creek, the filling has been much greater
nearer Wangaratta. The deposit has completely destroyed the low-lying land along the course of the
creek, for a considerable width from the channel, of from a quarter to nearly half a mile.
The experience of Mr. Dodsworth, at Wangaratta, shows that the quantity of material in suspen-
sion in the water amounts to £ inch in 4 feet, or about 1 in 200 parts of the water drawn off about 2 feet
below the surface and about 3 feet above the bed of the river.
The Board, however, had no opportunity to verify by observation the statements made as to the
amount of filling in either the river or the creek, for the rains occurring just previously to the arrival of
the members so deleted the streams and raised the surface that measurements were not possible.
The clear water of the King River, though greatly swollen by the rains, contrasted in a most
marked manner with the discolouration of that in the Ovens River and Rede’s Creek. The evidence taken
at Wangaratta shows that the injury is not confined to Rede’s Creek, but already extends to the Murray
River.
There is no remedy for the injury yet to be done by the passage down the Ovens River of the large
body of silt lying in it from the Tarrawingee channel northward, but the further accumulation may be
lessened by the adoption of measures to stack the sludge, as far as possible, as previously recommended.
Above the channel, the workings are not very extensive, and are at such a distance on the Buckland
and above Bright on the Ovens Rivers that no serious injury need be anticipated, unless, owing to plentiful
rains or other causes, the operations were to greatly increase. At present, the Buckland and the Ovens at
their junction are, though discoloured, yet fit for stock and other purposes ; and above the junction of the
Tarrawingee channel the Ovens River was, when inspected by the Board, clear and in satisfactory condi-
tion.
21. At Yackandandah.
In the Premier Gold Mining Company, the service dam of six acres acts as a sludge dam alongside
of creek and inside gully, and retains the sludge brought down from the claims below Stanley, but there
being a sluice at the bottom opened daily, sludge is carried down the creek. There is no attempt to stack
the sludge other than for the purpose of conserving water.
. Mr. Jessop, the owner, states he would prefer clean water, but that there is no room to make further
sludge dams.
The slum in the sluicing water settles immediately the water is at rest.
In this and the other cases on the creek, use might be made of the old workings and side gullies
for settling purposes, and thus mitigate the future evil in the creek, besides reclaiming old worked-out
ground.
Mr. Jessop, as with others, objects to this, on the ground that he has not worked out the whole
creek over the length left by him as if worked out below his present site of. operations, stating that, if the
sludge were turned into these old workings, it would prevent their being worked out; but to this it may be
replied that the sluicer should so work out the lower ground that it may be used as sludge dams, and if he,
for his own purposes, neglects to do so, he should not be permitted to advance it as a reason for all sludge
being passed from his workings down the creek.
22. Allen’s Flat, Yackandandah Creek.
Here the creek is filled up 8 feet above the original bed, for, owing to a dam across the creek, to
supply two claims, the sludge has flooded over the flat lands previously worked, and filled up the holes
over, say, 24 acres, which, when further filled above level of floods, will be valuable.
. The silt is kept back and water-level raised 5 feet by means of a stake and brushwood dam, which
has withstood the creek during ten years.
Vissich and Co. at this point stack the tailings, the water from which is discharged into old workings.
In Mr. McCombe’s property, lower down the Yackandandah Creek, the flats to extent of 15 acres
have been flooded to an average depth of 6 feet.
The soil covered with sludge is stated not to be as good for agriculture as the mother soil, but still
will give good grass if the deposit ceases. If, however, heavy rains occur during a succession of years,
the flats will again be destroyed.
The above instance of Allen’s Flat shows that, in an inexpensive manner, sludge may in certain
cases be advantageously deposited out of the watercourse. The brushwood dam is inexpensive, and yet
No. 10, c


keeps back the sludge ; and as the sludge, once deposited, settled, and grown over, does not again cut away
beyond the requirement of the actual creek bed, the dam can be broken through and removed as soon as the
requisite height of filling has been attained.
23. On the Mitta Mitta River.
The Long Point Company is a progressive mine, situated about 8 miles up the river, above the
junction of the Snowy Creek, and proposes to use one giant nozzle.
The Mammoth Company, situated at Grauite Flat (also progressive), proposes to use at first two
giant nozzles, which are on the ground, but ultimately six will perhaps be engaged.
The discharge will be into Snowy Creek and thence into the Mitta Mitta River.
The fall in the Snowy Creek to the Mitta Mitta is about 32 feet per mile, affording no opportunity
for settlement of the sludge.
The quantity that will be discharged by the Mammoth Company will probably be very great, for
the ground to be sluiced is granite drift, Avhicli will be rapidly affected by the water.
The Mitta Mitta River at this point has so large a drainage area, and is so subject to enormous
bodies of storm water, that any attempt to form settling dams along its course would be fruitless ; and it
remains to be seen, at the expiration of the present lease, whether the injury to the watercourses is not of
greater moment to the community than the gain by extraction of the gold from the granite drift; and,
should it prove to be so, it will be necessary then either to refuse the re-issue of the lease, or to issue
under conditions providing for the retention of the sludge.
The same applies to the Long Point Company, but, being in slaty country, and the proposed
workings of a less extensive character, the injury to the Mitta Mitta River will probably be far less.
24. Mitta Mitta River.
Close to the junction Avitli SnoAvy Creek are tAvo companies—the Pioneer and the Union, the
former of Avhicli works with one giant nozzle at present, which sluices 1,333 cubic yards per 24 hours,
working at night also ; the latter company, adjoining the Pioneer, sluices 5,000 cubic yards per week ; and
both these claims deliver this large quantity of material direct into the Mitta Mitta River.
There are in these tAvo companies about 61 acres said to bo left for Avorking, at an average face of
100 feet, amounting to over 8,000,000 of cubic yards, which Avould fill a river, say, 210 feet Avide, 3 feet
deep, over 60 miles in length. The future evil, therefore, is one for serious consideration.
There is no possible method of stacking the sludge from these companies, and the injury to the
river, and consequently to the lands further down, must be increasing. When the present leases expire, it
will be a matter for consideration if such sluicing on the bank of an important river should not be discon-
tinued, for the benefit to the general community is but small compared to the injury being now caused, and
Avhicli Avill in future be increased by the discharge of the sludge waters.
But five men are employed on the Union and eleven on the Pioneer Avorks, by Avhicli are sluiced
5,000 cubic yards in the first and 8,000 cubic yards in the second case per Aveek.
In the evidence given by the managers of these tAvo companies, it appears that Avork is anticipated
to be carried on daily throughout the year, and thus, at 13,000 cubic yards per 24 hours, the total
8,000,000 of cubic yards remaining in the leases Avould be worked out in less than 12 years, or about the
period during which the present leases have yet to run ; and it thus follows that, if no action be taken
until the expiration of the leases, the damage above referred to as capable of being produced by the
discharge of 8,000,000 of yards Avill have been effected.
It has been impossible for the Board to examine the Mitta Mitta River betAveen Tallandoon and the
River Murray to ascertain to Avliat extent the Avorkings have up to the present affected the depth, but such
examination should be made Avith a view of estimating the probable injury to be caused during the period
of the leases, and, if such appears to bear out the above remarks, it will become a question Avhetlier the
works should not be abolished, even if the rights of the companies have to be purchased.
25. Cobungra Creek.
The sluicing claim is on Brandy Creek, which discharges into the Cobungra Creek and thence into
the Mitta Mitta River.
The height above sea-level of the sluicing claim is said to be 4,800 feet, and thus the Avatershed
supplying the water-races is but small, and a deficiency in the supply is the consequence.
The manager states that 90,000 cubic yards Avere sluiced in 1885, and 200,000 cubic yards between
June and December, or a period of seven months, in 1886.
The manager also stated that he can Avash over 2,000 cubic yards per 24 hours with the giant nozzle.
The average number of men directly employed by the company amounts to 14, Avhilst during the
time occupied in cleaning up the tail-race as many as 25 are employed.
The gold is found in places as deep as 3 feet into the rock.
The depth of the face runs from 60 to.loo feet, and as the hill is further cut into, the depth will
rise very considerably.
Considerable beds of lignite occur in the face, Avhicli, becoming very hard Avlien frozen, greatly retard
operations in Avinter.
The manager states that up to the present the sum of £15,000 has been expended. The lease
contains 70 acres, of which but 3 have been worked out, and the remaining 67 acres, taken as about
150,000 cubic yards to the acre, will amount to 10,000,000 yards, or sufficient to fill a space 60 miles long,
100 feet wide, and 9 feet deep.
The case of the Cobungra mine is one that should be carefully inquired into on the expiration of
the lease before reneAval, in order, if necessary, to insert conditions should injury to the land or Avatercourses
have assumed a serious aspect at that time, and no fresh lease for sluicing purposes on a similar scale
should be granted Avithout careful inquiry as to the possibility of the Avorks being carried on without
injuriously affecting ing other interests.


2G. Omeo.
Large sluicing operations have been in operation during the last 30 years, most of which have either
been abandoned or have passed into hands conducting them on a smaller scale.
The largest existing company is the Oriental, which delivers tailings down the gully into the
Livingstone Creek, close to the Main-road bridge, which has thus been blocked up from a depth of 14 feet
to only 3 feet, backing the water for some distance, and submerging the cultivated land above the bridge.
In this instance, much, if not all, of the injury caused by this company would have been prevented
had the Council firmly insisted that such measures as were necessary and possible were adopted by the
company to avoid passing the tailings, as at present, into the creek.
The area of the lease is 19 acres, of which 1 only has been worked out, and the depth of the face
averages 35 feet.
The time occupied in working out the 1 acre, containing about 58,000 cubic yards, has been 8 months,
the quantity sluiced per day having amounted to 275 cubic yards, and about 13 years’ work still remains for
the leased land, whilst the gold-bearing ground outside the leased area will probably afford many more
years’ work.
The work at present is being carried down only to a false bottom, the real bottom being from 30 feet
and upwards below this level, thus affording many years’ additional work.
The labour employed amounts to 9 men when in full work, and 5 when slack, the average number
employed being 7.
The -water used is obtained from the Livingstone, Jim Jack, and Mountain Creeks, in races respec-
tively 3‘o' x I’9', T6' x I‘2', and I*G' x I*o', with a fall of 7 - 6' to the mile.
The system of working is with the water flowing over the face to break down the material
previously undercut with hydraulic pressure through a canvas hose, and the workings are ground sluicing
without boxes.
No attempt whatever is made to arrest the passage of the tailings into the creek, the tail-race
having a fall of 1 foot to the box of 12 feet.
The old Pioneer claim now worked by a party of Chinese adjoins the Oriental. This claim has
been also worked during 30 years, and finds employment for 5 men, who make, it is said, about £3 average
per man per week. The average face is 48 feet, and there is work for about 10 years remaining.
Should a series of wet seasons occur, it is anticipated that three times as much work as at present
could be done by each of these companies.
There are several smaller claims at work discharging into Livingstone Creek, such as one party of
2 Chinese, Ah Fung’s party of 3 men, and Bloomfield’s of 3 men. No attempt is being made to stack the
tailings, which have completely filled the creek.
The sludge from the sluicers is carried down the Livingstone Creek to the Mitta Mitta River, but in
its course benefit has been derived from the deposit on the flat lands.
The Cobungra Creek discharges into the Mitta, above the junction of the Livingstone, and when the
sluicing is in progress the waters of both are highly discolourod, that of the latter being too thick for use.
In these cases, there is no necessity for the unrestricted discharge of tailings into the creeks, and
the companies could, without serious cost, retain them within reasonable limits, but it is impossible to retain
the sludge ; yet, as there is no evidence of injury to the adjoining lands as yet, and the length of River
Mitta Mitta is so great, whilst the drainage area free from mining which is brought into it is so extensive
as to dilute the discoloured sluicing water, it does not appear that action beyond the retention of the
tailings is required.
BALLARAT DISTRICT.
27. Little Bendigo.
28. Leigh River.
29. Burrumbeet Creek.
27. Little Bendigo.
Four companies, aggregating 113 head of stamps, delivering the tailings direct into the Yarrowee,
at Little Bendigo, have filled the creek to a depth at present of 8 to 10 feet, notwithstanding that room
exists for stacking tailings.
In Specimen Gully, two companies, with 30 head of stamps, deliver tailings into the Council's brick
drain, and thence into the Yarrowee.
The Last Chance claim, Pearce Brothers, and Llanberris Company, stack the tailings, the latter
company in an especially satisfactory manner; but two other in Canada Flat do not, neither do the com-
panies, with a total of 70 stamps, which deliver into the Leigh River in Winter’s Flat.
Above Sebastopol, no less than 175 stamps deliver direct into the Yarrowee, which, in Winter’s Flat,
is very seriously filled up, to the detriment of the roads and bridges, yet there is no greater difficulty in
effecting the stacking than in other cases where it is done, or admittedly possible, at a moderate cost.
The remedy in these cases is to be found in insisting on the stacking of the quartz tailings before
discharge into the watercourse.
28. Leigh River.
The Yarrowee Creek discharging into the Leigh River, the latter becomes the receptacle for all the
mining debris which has filled the waterholes and injured the water as far as Shelford ; here the injury to
the flat lands on the eastern side has been prevented by the construction of an earth dam along the bank
of a creek to a distance of nearly half-a-mile below the township, which was constructed in 1873, after the
last very high flood. The principal injury to the agricultural lands at this point occurred as far back as
between 1862 and 1870; but the floods having the effect of passing the sludge lower down the river, has


caused a deposit on the flats, and a partial filling of the River Leigh to Inverleigh, at the junction of the
Barwon, and thence whatever doposit has been brought down is carried by the larger stream towards the
sea, and this passage of the sludge from the Ballarat mines is undoubtedly proceeding at the present.
Mr. Farrar, of Shelford, states that his property has been depreciated 50 per cent, in value by the
deposit of sludge, for although a fair crop will grow on it during the wet seasons, yet, during the dry,
nothing will.
Mr. Armstrong’s land is also said bo destroyed, even for grazing purposes, to a distance of three
miles below Shelford, with a width ranging from half to three-quarters of a mile.
*
29. Burrumbeet Creek.
Some Chinese are sluicing on the watersheds of the Burrumbeet Creek, especially Waldie's Creek,
and though the workings do not appear to be extensive, or to employ much labour, yet very considerable
damage is done to the lands in the creek, both above and below Miners’ Rest. Here the waterlioles are all
filled up, and the property of Mr. Parker on the creek is completely destroyed, that of Mr. Parks, adjoining,
being also much injured by the works during the past four years.
At Windermere, it would appear that the principal ground for complaint is the destruction of the
water for domestic use, but fears are entertained that, unless stringent regulations are enforced to compel
the retention of the sludge by the mining companies, those now proposing to commence operations in the
Dowling Forest Estate and down to Miners’ Rest will cause the complete obliteration of the Burrumbeet
Creek and serious injury to the lake.
To prevent further injury, it will be necessary to render the stacking of the slum from the alluvial
mines imperative, and which can be effected as now by the Midas Company in the same group; and either
the sluicers on Waldie’s Creek should be compelled to divert and stack the sludge in side gullies before
delivery of the water into the creek, or the continuance of the sluicing operations in this locality should
be prohibited, for the loss to the community is greater than the gain by the works.
In the cases of the Dezoza Buninyong Estate Company and others in the neighbourhood, the tailings
are recklessly discharged into a small watercourse delivering into the Leigh River, near Scotchman’s village;
yet there is ample area on which to stack, the mine owners merely neglecting to adopt any precautions, in
the belief that, as no complaint has been made, there is no. ground for any.

MINUTES OE EVIDENCE
TAKEN BEFORE THE SLUDGE INQUIRY BOARD.
Preliminary Meeting , held at the Public Offices , Treasury Gardens , Melbourne ,
THURSDAY, stii AUGUST, 188 G.
Present :
R. 11. Shake spear, Esq., in the Chair;
A. F. Walker, Esq., | R. G. Ford, Esq.
Mr. Joseph Rowan acted as Secretary, and laid before the Board the following Order in Council, as
published in the Government Gazette :—
The Governor, with the advice of the Executive Council, has been pleased to appoint
R. 11. Shakespear, Esq., C.E., Melbourne,
Arthur F. Walker, Esq., Mining Surveyor, Sandhurst,
R. G. Ford, Esq., Public Works Department Melbourne,
to be a Board to inquire into and report on the extent of the injury caused by sludge from mines,
and the best means of preventing or mitigating future damage ;
R. H. Shakespear, Esq.,
to be Chairman of the Board.
JOHN L. DOW,
Department of Mines and Water Supply, Minister of Mines.
Melbourne, 27th July, 1886.
The Board decided to make a personal inspection of the rivers and the adjacent lands affected by
sludge from mines before taking any evidence, the times and places at which sittings of the Board will be
held to be fixed after the preliminary examination has been completed.
Beechworth ,
MONDAY, 27th SEPTEMBER, 1886.
Present:
R. 11. Shakespear, Esq., .C.E., in the Chair;
A. F. Walker, Esq., | R. G. Ford, Esq.
Henry Davidson sworn and examined.
1. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—I hold the position of Mining Surveyor, and Inspector
of Mines, and Inspector of Explosives, under the Mining Department; and Authorized Surveyor under
the Lands Department.
2. For what period have you held those positions ?—lt will bo eighteen years on the 30th of this
month since I came.
3. Are you aware of any injury having been, or at present being caused to agricultural or grazing
lands by mining operations ?—There has been serious damage in the past, but I am not aware of any
present damage at all. There has been a large quantity of good agricultural and grazing land thrown out
of use for years by the overflow of sludge. That is down Tarrawingee and Everton way. In time the gi’ass
grows again upon the sludge, but several years are required for this. I think that eventually the action
of the atmosphere upon it makes it fruitful, but not, in my opinion, equal to the submerged soil.
4. Have the creeks or rivers been injured in your district, to your knowledge ?—I consider that the
creeks and the rivers are gradually silting up.
5. Will you mention the creeks ?—There is the Three-mile Creek, and Hodgson’s Creek, as it is
variously called, and the Woolshed Creek.
6. You say the Three-mile Creek, the Woolshed, and Hodgson's Creek?—Yes, and the Yackan-
dandah Creek. I have seen, in very dry seasons, about the end of March, the bed of the Ovens River,
below Wangaratta, covered -with a hard cake coating of sludge, and after floods I have seen this slum lying
on the flats around the lagoons. I have seen that several times.
7. Below Wangaratta?—Below Wangaratta. That must have come down from the creeks up
here.
Sludge. b


8. Do you consider that the bed of the Ovens is at the present time being more filled up? —I do,
slowly and gradually—very slowly of late, compared to what it was in former years, when the rainfall was
abundant.
9. Can you afford any information as to the area now being sluiced ? —I have divided it into headings.
I have made out a list of the number of acres held under lease, and bye-laws, in different localities.
About 400 acres are held under lease around Beechworth and Stanley for sluicing purposes, that is under
the Gold Mining Regulations, and about half that area under miners’ rights, of which I have no knowledge,
for they are not surveyed nowadays. This area will shortly be increased to 600 acres; that is owing to a
recent application ou the Woolshed; 209 are in process of being brought under lease.
10. And 200 under miners’ rights?—Yes. At Yackandatulah there is, I should saj r , about 40 acres
held under gold-minor’s lease for sluicing purposes, and about the same area under miners’ rights. This, I
must mention, is a rough estimate. Around Bright there are about 2o acres held under gold-mining lease
for sluicing purposes, and I think six or eight times that area held under miners’ rights—say even ten times
that area. At Snowy Creek there are about 300 acres held under gold-mining lease for sluicing purposes,
and about half that area tinder miners’ rights for the same purpose. I will deal with the proportion actually
working further on.
11. You have given us the areas of the Snowy Creek ? —lt is about 300 acres under gold-mining
leases at Snowy Creek, and about half that area under miners’ rights.
12. Have you any further information to give upon the subject of areas ?—I can give a rough esti-
mate of the quantity of stuff sent down from each claim in the year, or rather of the acreage that is sluiced.
13. What is the acreage that is sluiced at present?—During the late dry seasons I estimate it
at an average of about one-third of an acre to each claim, but I am open to contradiction in the
matter. In ordinary wet seasons that would be more than doubled. I should say that, exclusive of
the Snowy Creek, the average depth of the faces would be from 15 to 20 feet in Beechworth and Yack-
andandah, and elsewhere; the faces up the Snowy Creek range from 140 down to about 80 or 90.
14. You state that the average sluiced would be a third of an acre per claim. How many claims
are there?—l made a rough estimate of about fourteen sluicing claims held under both leasing bye-laws
Regulations, on the Three-mile, Two-mile, and One-mile, the sludge from which all goes down to Tarra-
wingee or Springer’s Creek, and its tributaries; that is down from Silver Creek and elsewhere to the
claim upon the Woolshed. I estimate about fifteen claims. That sludge all goes to Eldorado, and thence
by Reedy Creek iuto the Ovens below Wangaratta. On the Nine-mile Creek and Yackandandah, I
estimate about twenty claims held under various titles, leasing and bye-laws; that sludge goes from this
down to the junction of the Little River near its junction with the Murray River. On the Buckland, about
twenty claims are held, I estimate, on various titles, the sludge from which goes direct to the Ovens at
Morse’s Creek, a tributary of the Oven’s River, and about five sluicing claims. At Freiburg, between
Bright and Harrietville, a tributary of the Ovens, about twelve sluicing claims. At Harrietvillo, upon the
Ovens River, about four sluicing claims. On the Ovens River, from Bright downwards towards Mvrtleford,
four sluicing claims. At Snowy Creek, at present, there are only two sluicing claims in full operation, the
Union and the Pioneer, but there are several others, such as the Mammoth and the Grand Junction, which
will shortly be at work. The average number of men employed upon all these claims for the present year
when water is scarce, I should say, is six men on each, but in good wet seasons I should estimate roughly
an average of twelve men to each.
15. Putting aside the Mammoth and others in progress upon the Snowy Creek, is there any prospect
of more extended sluicing in the district ? —Decidedly. There are some companies with 200 acres pegged
out in the Woolshed Valley, and if they go on there would be a great deal there to begin with, and down
at Yackandandah there are lots of claims of ground fit to work over again if there is water to do it with,
and, beside that, large areas of ground, not considered good at present would be taken up, if there were
abundance of water that would pay to put through in large quantities rapidly. In fact, nothing but water
is wanted to make the district as prosperous as ever it has been before, in my opinion.
16. Can you give any estimate of the proportions of tailings removed from the boxes to the amount
of slum carried away ? —lt is rather a difficult subject to estimate, but I think I have some notes about it;
I estimate the proportion of tailings to slum about Beechworth to be from a fourth to a fifth of the whole;
about the Buckland River I should say from half to one-third, and about Snowy Creek at from one-third
to one-fourtli.
17. In surveying races, what amount of fall to the box do you allow for the tail-race ?—Around
Beechworth, as a rule, the miners level their own races, and grade them themselves, in fact, the bulk of
them were in existence before I came to the district at all; but for a tail-race the miners do not like much
less than three inches and a-half; but I believe Mr. Lang, at the Niue-mile, is working with a less grade
than that, something like one and three-quarters to two and a-half, but he will be able to say for himself
what it is; I am not positive.
18. What rate of fall do they put for the water-races ? —That depends very much upon the character
of the water. If it is clear water a less fall, something like six feet to the mile I should say, but for muddy
water double that would bo required almost. The water comes in small streams, very narrow; there is not
enough of it to tear the sides of the races to pieces.
19. From your knowledge of the different claims can you inform us, or have you formed any opinion
whether the usual fall in the tail-race can be reduced with advantage ? —I believe if it was reduced, they
would save a great deal of fine floury gold, but the expense of working would be increased, for forking
would be required, and more labour. The question is whether the one would compensate for the other.
20. If the heavy stuff were more forked out a lesser fall would be sufficient to carry away the slum?
—I think so. Of course, that would be increased expense to the claim-holders, and they would resist that.
21. Are you in a position to make any suggestion as to any improved method of stacking sludge ?
I have thought and considered for many years past, and I still think that settling dams might be formed
in a series down the creeks, and at the junctions of side gullies with the creeks; let the water settle there,
and pass it on again; that is below the lowest claims. I imagine that dams of that description should be
maintained by the State, the miners should not be put to any expense over them. I may mention that my
estimates are only rough and approximate.
The witness withdrew.


Jolm Fund sworn and examined.
22. Where do you reside ?—At the Three-mile.
23. What is your occupation ?—Miner.
24. How long have you followed that occupation in this district ?—Over 33 years.
25. Where is your claim situated ?—On the Three-mile.
20. And the name of the company—is it not your own ?—Yes, and I am interested in two or three
besides.
27. What quantity of water do you use —per week or per 24 hours —as you like ?—You mean
running. Ido not understand the question thoroughly.
28. How much running water is brought in. How much water do you bring in from the races ?
It is about two sluice-heads for the 24 hours.
29. Where do you obtain that ?—From Stanley.
30. And how many hours a day do you sluice ?—About four hours.
31. For how many months ?—We will do that for, I suppose, seven or eight months in the year.
32. That is during the present seasons ? —Yes.
33. If you were in wet seasons ?—Of course then we should run eight or nine hours.
34. And for a greater number of months ?—Yes, for a greater number of months.
35. What fall have you in your tail-race boxes ?—The tail-race is about two and a-half.
36. How many men does it require, with you, to keep the tail-race clear ?—Two men in the morning
for a couple of hours, and the same after dinner. Twice a day.
37. That is equivalent to one man a whole day ?—lt all depends upon the ground. If the ground
is very stony, I have to put on more men; then there are six or eight of us at it for a couple of hours,
both morning and after dinner. First thing in the morning, and immediately after dinner.
38. It would average more than one man, and less than two ?—Yes.
39. Can you give us the proportion of tailings thrown out of the boxes, compared with the amount
of slum that is carried down ?—I could not.
40. That is, taking the whole quantity you turn through the boxes, can you give us any idea what the
proportion of tailings is ?—I could not do that.
41. You have heard it said to be from one-fourth to one-fifth here ?—I could not give any idea.
42. Is the water used bofore you receive it ?—Yes, it is.
43. By oue or two companies ?—One company, at present.
44. That is Telford’s ?—Yes. The United.
45. Do you adopt any mode of clearing the water after it comes from Telford’s, before you use
it? —Yes, there is some tailing ground where'the tailings lodge beforo it comes to us.
46. Who looks after that—who spreads the tailings—Telford or yourself ?—Telford looks after that.
47. Do you pass it into any dams with the view of settling the water, and rendering it clearer ?—•
It is not exactly a dam, it is just ground that has been already worked before.
48. You pass it into old ground to make the water clearer before use ?—Exactly so.
49. When the water leaves you it is re-used ? —lt is re-used again, and I do the same.
50. You clear the tail-race ?—Exactly. I look after my tailings.
51. And pass the water into old ground ?—Exactly.
52. So that the one below you again receives it considerably clearer than when it passes through
your Avorks ? —Yes, exactly. It passes from one to the other. We try to make the most of it.
53. What area of ground ha\’e you got ?—I am interested in about GO acres.
54. Of that, how much have you Avorked in the last feAV years ?—About half an acre a twelve
months, upon an average.
55. How many years* prospective work do you think there are left ?—There is a number of years.
56. lloav many acres have you Avorked out ? —I have Avorked out six acres.
57. And you have got 60 acres under lease ?—I haA r e altogether, under lease and miners’ rights,
nearly 60 acres.
58. But the Avhole of that is not Avorkable ?—Yes, it is all auriferous land.
59. What is the average depth of your face ?—lt is from 18 feet to 23 feet or 24 feet.
GO. Do you Avork ground that has been worked before, or partially neAV ground ? —lt was partially sunk
and driven, partially Avorked.
61. None of it absolutely new ground ?—No.
G 2. But is any portion of it ground that has been sluiced beforo ?—No. Not sluiced in the method
I am doing it.
G 3. Have any complaints ever been made to you about injurious effects from your Avorkings ?—No,
not to me.
G 4. What is the length of your tail-race ? —My tail-race is about a thousand yards, I suppose.
G 5. Hoav much of that do you actually clean up ?—We clean after three or four years. I clean the
whole of it.
66. And for ordinary cleaning-up ?—For ordinary cleaning-up I suppose I clean about 50 or 60
boxes.
67. And Avhat is your opinion as to the probabilities in the future of more or less extended sluicing
in the district ? —There Avould be more, and it ought to be extended, I think.
GB. Suppose you get no more Avater than the present supply, Avould the sluicing increase—is there
any probability of that in the district?—lf avc do not get any more supply, no; for all the water is used.
69. Suppose you had a series of wet years instead of dry years, would it be extended ?—Yes.
70. There Avould be Avater obtainable besides the rights already taken up, provided the years were
AAmt ?—lf Ave had continuous wet seasons, every spring Avould gh r e so much more Avater, and every party
that has got one could spend so much more money in draining and so on, to increase their supplies.
71. But that Avill not increase the number of claims ?—No, not where they are already taken up.
72. I mean in this district?—Notin this district.
73. But the number of claims Avould be increased if fresh Avater Avere introduced ?—Decidedly.
74. If the quantity of Avater Avere increased, Avould that increase tlic acreage that is capable of being


sluiced ?—Yes, if I liad more water I could sluice twice the quantity of ground. The more water we get
the more ground we get away.
1 5. Do you consider that the ground capable of being sluiced is all under occupation now, under
lease ? —I do not understand the question thoroughly.
70. You said before that if there were additional water further claims might be taken up ? —Yes.
77. Then you do not consider that the available gold-bearing land is at present all occupied?—No,
it is not now.
The witness withdrew.
John Lang sworn and examined.
78. Where do you reside ?—At Stanley.
79. And your occupation is, what ? —Miner.
80. For how many years have you mined in this district ? —I have been mining over 30 years.
81. Is that in Yackandandah ? —No, Stanley.
82. Are you the Mr. Lang who is working that claim above Phillips’s, below Stanley ?—Yes.
83. It is upon the Nine-mile Creek ?—Yes.
84. The ground that you are working has been worked before, has it not ?—Yes, several times.
85. What acreage are you holding there ?—About 30 acres.
80. llow many years have you been working this particular claim ?—I have just got into the lease
now. I have been five years and a-lialf putting a tail-race into it.
87. How many years’ work do you anticipate there is ? —lf we have good seasons we should run away
about two acres every year.
88. Does your lease include any land that has not been worked ?—Very little. It is nearly all worked,
you may say.
89. Where do you obtain the water that you sluice with ?—I obtain it out of the Nine-mile Creek*
a branch of what they call the Back Creek. All the water I want comes out of the same creek.
90. How many months in the year does that water, with present seasons, suffice to enable you to
work ?—I work all the year round.
91. I mean sluicing ; how many months in the year do you sluice ?—The last two or three years
we have only been running about three half days a week. That is about fifteen days a month.
92. Do you carry that on through the summer? —Yes.
93. You conserve sufficient water to carry you through the summer ?—Yes. We have very large
dams.
94. Do you know what fall you have in your tail-race ?—I have got an inch and three-quarters,
and about the last 100 boxes I put in I have about two inches. Two inches is the highest fall I have
got.
95. That is further down the race ? —No, that is at the head. All the rest has only an inch and
three-quarters.
96. How many meu do you find it necessary to have to keep the tail-race clear ?—We generally run
the tailings on to old ground. We keep the tailings back.
97. But have not you to 'fork your tailings out from the tail-race ?—We occasionally have to do
that, but very seldom ;in fact, with that body of water on you could not fork out. We rake it three times
a day.
98. Is there not a heavy wash in your claim ? —lt is nearly all wash. There is very little slum in
my claim ; it has been so often washed that very little remains.
99. Is the water used before you receive it? —Part of it, and part of it clear out of the dam. One
party I purchase water from uses it before me.
100. Do you deliver water for use to anyone below you ? —No.
101. It runs clear away ?—lt runs clear away. It is used for milling purposes after that, but, of
course, they pick it out of the creek to drive a Avater-wheol.
102. Do you adopt any method of clearing the water before you use it, by running it into a sludge
dam, or any other method ?—No.
103. You take it just as it comes ? —Just as it comes. Of course we adopt methods for keeping our
dams free : that is, from the clear water-races.
104. What is the average depth of the face that you expect to work ?—About 12 feet is the deepest
I have got. I have tested it.
105. Has any complaint of your working ever been made to you ?—No, never.
106. What is tho length of your tail-race?—3,7so yards.
107. What length of that do you clean out ?—That is when we are washing up ?
108. I mean for exceptional washing. No, take tho ordinary washing up first ? —We might not take
100 boxes—only take them just as far as they pay.
109. Would you ever clean up the remainder ?—Yes, when it runs four or five years it would pay us
to do it.
110. You hold a claim from near Stanley, do you not, down to that held by Phillips ?—Down to
where my men are working now. They are just upon the boundary of my lease.
111. That is north of Phillips's, is it not ?—Yes, the ground below that did not belong to me. That
is Phillips’s party.
112. Have you formed any opinion as to the probabilities of future working, whether it will be more
or less extended ? —I do not think it can be extended any more unless more water comes down.
113. If there were more water, is there an area of ground adapted to sluicing which is not yet taken
up ?—Yes.
114. If there were water, is there virgin soil near your claim that would he capablo of being
worked ?—Yes.
115. The area then is limited at present purely by the water ?—Yes, purely by the water.
The witness withdrew-.


Martin Mahee sworn and examined.
110. Where is your residence ?—Beechworth.
117. And your occupation ? —Miner.
118. For wlmt length of time have you followed that occupation here ?—About 33 years.
119. What claim is it you are on ?—The Rocky Mountain Company.
120. How long have you been working that claim ?—Near seventeen years.
121. Was that claim working before you took the management of it ?—Yes.
122. For what period was it, roughly? —I could not say; several years, it must have been; ten or
twelve years.
123. Do you know the quantity of water that you use ?—Pretty well. Do you mean the quantity
avc use when we are washing ?
124. The quantity that you get from the natural watershed from your races ?—I suppose 3,000,000
gallons a week would cover the whole lot, that is for the last couple of years, taking the average. ;
125. If there Avere Avater, are you entitled to more?—Yes, four times the quantity.
120. You do not get the full quantity to Avhich you are entitled ?—Nothing like it.
127. lloav many hours a day do you sluice?—To take the last two years, it does not average three
days a Aveek.
128. And lioav many hours during the day?—Nine hours, if avc have it.
129. Can you take it that you make an average lately of 27 hours during the week—that is, three
days of nine hours ?—Yes, it is about that.
130. What fall have you in the tail-race noAA r ?—One in 48.
131. That is up to the tunnels? —Through the Avliolo length.
132. Including the tunnel ?—Yes, all.
133. One in 48 ? —Yes, that is 3 inches to the box.
134. But is not there a drop in the tunnel ?—Yes, there is, in one place.
135. Does that average into your 3 inches ?—No, that is excluded altogether. Every box, as it is
laid from top to bottom, is supposed to haA r e 3 inches; the fall is graduated toAvards the bottom. The
boxes have not so much fall as they have at the top, but, taking the Avhole length, it averages that, excluding
the drop.
130. Previously, Avhcn you Avere Avorking the old tail-race, what Avas the fall then ? —An inch and
a-half to 2 inches.
137. What did you find Avas the effect of AA r orking Avith an inch and a-half to 2 inches?—lt Avas
very slow Avork.
138. You put through less material ? —Yes, by half.
139. Did you save any more gold in proportion? —No, I think there Avas not any more gold
saved to the cubic yard than is noAv.
140. Then your experience Avould lead you to believe that you would gain nothing in the matter of
gold by lessening the amount of fall? —By no means.
141. lloav many men are required to keep your tail-race clear?—There is no one employed upon
the tail-race.
142. You do not have to fork out from the tail-race ?—No, nothing.
143. Does all the heaA 7 y material get carried aAvay ?—Everything goes through.
144. What is the length of that race ?—About three-quarters of a mile. No, it is about two-thirds
of a mile; it is near 1,300 yards.
145. Is it boxed the Avhole Avay ?—Yes.
146. What length of those boxes do you clear up ?—About 100 boxes, 400 yards. We have cleared
up the tail-race right through.
147. Usually you clear up 100 boxes ?—Yes.
148. Will you clear up all through again ?—Yes, certainly.
149. Right through the tunnel? —Yes.
150. After the Avater leaves you it is used by others, is it not ?—lt is used at Reid’s Creek, some
tAvo miles below our tail-race.
151. Does any complaint ever reach you as to the condition in which the water leaves you ?—No.
152. What is the total area of your ground ?—There are 58 acres in the lease, and, out of that,
probably two are Avorked; so there arc 56 acres.
153. The two acres Avorked are in the late lease ?—Yes.
154. Tavo acres Avorked within the last ? —Two years—perhaps two years and a-half.
155. I want to arrive at the number of acres left to Avork ? —About 56.
156. And you Avork uoav at the rate of one acre ?—Take the last sixteen years since I have been
there, the average Avon Id be about three-quarters of an acre a year.
157. Is that the average in Avet seasons as Avell as in dry ? —Yes. But you understand that since the
company have put the tunnel through, a great deal more stuff is put through in wet seasons than when the
old race Avas Avorking.
158. Supposing that Ave had back the years that avc had from 1865 to 1875, would you put more
through, on the average, than three-quarters of an acre a year ? —Yes, the average of it is two acres in the
year.
159. What is the average depth of your face ?—The average depth of the face of the ground Avorked
is about 35 feet.
160. And the average depth of the actually gold-bearing portion—the Avash ?—The Avash upon the
bottom is about from tAvo to three feet; but at present, of course, the ground having been Avorked in old
claims, there is gold scattered upon the top and at the bottom of old shafts that help to fill up.
161. Are you Avorking any A'irgin ground ?—No; very little. We get a patch once in a AA r hile.
162. Is it ground that has been sunk or paddocked out, or Avas it sluiced ground?—lt Avas neA'er
sluiced; it Avas sunk and driven.
163. From your experience of the district, do you think that there will be probably more extended
sluicing Avorks ? —Not Avith the present supply of Avater.


164. But there is gold-bearing laud practically illimitable, as far as time is concerned, with the
present small supply ?—Yes.
1(35. It would last a great many years ?—Yes.
1(50. If water were by any means introduced, or you had exceptionally wet seasons, would the amount
of sluicing be greatly increased ?—ln wet seasons, of course. The increase over the present time would be
one-half at least.
167. Fifty per cent ?—Yes; but I do not know whether any now ground would be taken up, on
account of the expense of opening it up.
168. But if wo had ten years* wet seasons we might have as much as 50 per cent, more material
carried away ?—Yes, fully.
The ivitness withdrew.
Donald Fletcher 6WOru and examined.
, 169. Where is your residence ?—Beechworth.
170. And your occupation ?—Miner.
171. How long have you practised that in this district ?—Thirty years.
172. Are you the owner of a claim to the south of the railway station ? —Yes, a deep claim.
173. You have also an interest in another claim—you are partner in a claim at Yackandandah ?
Yes.
174. Taking this claim first; where do you obtain the water from that you use here?—The greatest
portion of it from near Stanley.
175. You are working that under a pressure, are you not —bringing it down by iron pipes ?—Yes,
using hydraulic sluicing.
176. What height of head do you get ? —A little over 100 feet; 120 feet nearly, but not quite so
much just now.
177. Has that claim been worked before, or is it virgin ground?—lt has all been undermined by
shafts, and driven out at the bottom.
178. But has not been sluiced? —It has not been sluiced.
179. What length of tail-race have you there?—l do not remember exactly. It is somewhere
about three-quarters of a mile.
180. Do you know what the fall of that is ? —Yes; the highest is 2i inches to 12 feet, about 1 in 57.
The lower part of it is I|, and and 2 inches.
181. And what length of that do you ordinarily clean up ? —I might clean up about, sometimes, 200
boxes; it depends upon the season.
182. How far down do you ever clean up ?—To the very bottom.
183. That bottom is, whereabouts?—Newtown bridge. Tliero is a portion that runs upon the
granite rock; we do not clean up that very often.
184. How many men does it take to keep the tail-race clear ?—None.
185. There is a large amount forked out alongside the race?—Very little, except when wo aro
washing down.
186. That is forked out when you are washing down ?—Yes, the stones.
187. You are aware that race carries very large blocks, very large wash is carried by the force of
the water? —Yes.
188. Could not you then work with a less fall, seeing that the fall, as it is, carries such a very
large wash down ?—We could not work at all then.
189. Why ?—Because of the expense of doing it. It would be so great that the ground would not
pay. It has not paid for a number of years, on account of the small quantity of water wo have to use.
190. You mean that, if you had an extra man to fork out the race, it would be too heavy a tax upon
the company?—Yes; but he could not do it. The weight of the water and stuff coming doAvn is so great
that a man with a fork would be of no use. There are great differences in the ground; there is some
ground where it is a heavy wash, and they are obliged to fork out, but they do not allow it to go into, the
boxes; it is forked out before it reaches them where the water is a good width, so that a man can stand in
it and fork it out. At Yackandandah, Silver Creek, and Deep Creek, the quantity of stones that they are
obliged to fork is perhaps ten times as much as you require to do down here. It is nearly all clay, and
sometimes no gravel at all hardly.
191. What quantity of water do you use per 24 hours? —It is difficult to calculate. If you had
given us notice before you came that you wanted these statistics, wo could have told you by calculation.
192. Can you say, roughly, how many sluice-heads ?—We use about ten sluice-heads when we are
working.
193. That is the Beechworth sluice-head—l6o gallons?—About 120 or 130 gallons a minute. It
is no use using less, and we have to store it up till we get that quantity to use.
194. How many hours have you supply for at that rate on the average? —During the last two years,
up to the last rain, all last month, about one day a week for months before that.
195. Docs that mean for 52 weeks in the year ? —No; in the dry season you may say about half
time throughout the year.
196. At nino hours a day ? —No, wo work eight hours a day.
197. Then, in your case, you carry everything away in the tail-race? —Except the stones that wo
throw out before it enters the boxes.
198. Stones, slum, and everything goes away ?—Yes, but we throAv out the large stones, but the
fine gravel all goes away.
199. Of the whole face, what is the depth of the face upon the average ?—lt will average 30 feet;
some of it as high as 50 feet.
200. What is the average depth of wash; I think there are two layers, are there not ?—Some-
times there is hardly anything to call a wash; sometimes there are streaks of wash above, but they are very
irregular. It comes in runs, and then goes out again.
201. Could you in any way average what would be the proportion of the depth of wash to the depth
of the face upon the average ?—No, it would be very difficult. In some places, through the whole face yoii
do not get more than a foot of gravel, and that has been driven out previously.


202. And tbo rest is not gold-bearing ?—No, and sometimes three or four, sometimes six feet of :
gravel come high up, and sometimes down towards the bottom.
203. Can you give any information as to what proportion of tbo tailings is left behind with you, as
against the quantity of tailings and mullock carried away ?—The quantity left behind at the workings is
very little ; the quantity of gravel deposited in the creek below to the quantity of slum that is carried right
down into the river, is a difficult thing. Ido not suppose there would be perhaps a third of the quantity
left as tailings, such as gravel, in most cases.
204. You do not stack your tailings?—No.
204). You pass them all over the falls ?—We pass them all over the falls.
20G. What area of ground does your claim comprise ?—The present lease is sixteen acres, and there
has been working in it about eight years.
207. And how many acres of that have you worked out during the eight years ? —I could not tell.
208. How many years 1 work do you anticipate you have got in ordinary seasons ?—Such seasons as
tho last eight seasons, I do not know when we should work it out; but you may, perhaps, average it at about
half an acre a year. In wet seasons, of course, it would be more.
209. I forgot to ask you about your other claim at Yackandandah ; will you kindly give us s<sme
information upon that ?—Yes, as far as I can.
210. You have a claim upon the Nine-mile Creek at Yackandandah ?—Yes, what is called
Yackandandah Creek. It is a continuation of tho Nine-mile Creek.
211. Do you know the area of that claim? —No, I could not say exactly. Mr. Jessop, my partner,
is managing it.
212. That claim is in the bed of tho creek ?—Yes, the bed and banks.
213. Is it all worked out ground or partly virgin ?—There is very little of i-t virgin. It has been all
driven, with pillars left in some places, and some of it has been sluiced.
214. You obtain water that has been previously worked, do not you ?—Yes.
215. Do you take any steps to settle the water before you use it?—No, wo have a service dam,
which settles the sludge of itself; but I may explain these sludge dams are always sluiced out periodically,
and a great deal of the sludge goes into tho creek. Tho sludge is seldom or never retained unless the site
is changed.
216. As a matter of fact, though you open your sluice every day, the water only scours out a very
small portion of that sludge?—Yes.
217. It does not sweep away the sludge from your dam ? —No, but sometimes a means is used, aud
a place is left to clean it out, if it is constructed simply to retain the sludge. You may see some upon the
Three-mile—narroAV long guts —and that is allowed to collect getting full, and then the sluice gate is opened,
aud it is sluiced out, and it is used to carry away the heavy stuff, and it is made as clean as possible ; but
ultimately it finds its way into the creek.
218. You have a sluice at the bottom of your service dam, have you not ?—Yes.
219. Is not the object of that to clear out the sludge ?—No, that dam is not for the purpose of
settling sludge at all, though it does settle it.
220. It was not erected to do that ?—No, but we had a larger feluice put in for the purpose of getting
as much sludge as we could into the creek.
221. Your object is not to settle tho sludge, but to get it away ?—To get it away.
222. Then alongside the creek you have a storm-water channel ?—Yes, a flood-race.
223. What is the length of your tail-race ?—I cannot remember exactly.
224. Is it boxed the whole way ?—lt is boxed tho whole way; it has not so much fall.
225. Do you take any steps to stack your tailings ?—No.
226. At the bottom ?—No.
227. You rake out the large stones ?—At the head before it enters the boxes, and when running
down to wash up we fork out all the gravel we can.
228. Before washing up ?—Yes.
229. Do not you periodically and constantly fork out the boxes to-clear out the large stones ?—That
is done mostly at the head before it enters the boxes.
230. And at the tail of the boxes, do you fake any steps at all ?—We get rid of as much as we can.
231. Does it run into old working at tho tail ? —No, into the bed of the creek, and they spread that
as mucli as possible. That is done by the water being run in one direction a little while till it is filled up,
and then turn it in the other direction.
232. You shift the end of the boxes ?—Yes, we do it by boards or brushwood.
233. Can you give any idea of the length of time under your present system of working; your lease
will last, how many years ? —I could not tell.
234. Do you know the rate at which it has been worked ?—No, I have not been very long into it, we
have only been really, you may say, working the last year, and this year the water has been very limited.
235. Has any complaint of your workings ever reached you ?—No, I have never heard any complaint
in this district, except at Tarrawingee.
236. Is there any probability of more extended work—sluicing ?—lf more water was available no
doubt there would be, but there is very little sludge from Yackandandah now, most of the banks are washed in.
237. Do you know anything of the prospects of tho quartz reefing in that locality ?—No. Upon
the upper part there is a prospect yet, but as far as our claim is concerned there are no quartz reefs below
it.
238. But can you give us any information as to the probability of quartz reefing in the locality ?
Between that part and Stanley I think there is a great probability of reefs being found.
239. Fresh reefs have been found lately, have they not ? —Yes.
240. Is it your opinion that that will become a considerable industry ?—I think it will; it is one of
tho most permanent reefs in the district, the Rocky Point.
241. Does the Hillsborough mine drain into the Yackandandah Creek ?—Yes, I think it does.
242. And the other mines, if they start, would they drain into the Yackandandah Creek also ? —Yes.
243. The Yackandandah Creek will be the main drain of the whole of the mining of that
district ?—Yes.
The witness ivithdrew.


William Varlev sworn and examined.
244. Where is your residence ?—Three-mile.
245. Your occupation ?—Miner.
246. How many years have you been engaged in this district as a miner ?—About sixteen years.
247. And the name of your claim is, what ?—The United Sluicing Company.
248. How many men do you employ upon that claim usually?—On an average five men; in the dry
seasons four men; and in the wet seasons, five, six, or seven men.
249. How many acres are there in the claim ? —I think there are about 30 acres.
250. How many years have you been working the claim?—The claim in full work ?
251. Yes ? —The claim, I dare sav, has been working the last 30 years or more.
252. How many acres have been completely worked out ?—About ten or a dozen acres, I should think.
253. Out of 30 ?—Out of 30.
254. It is all worked ground; it has been previously worked, has it not?—Yes, driven out.
255. Has it not been sluiced ?—Just the creek; a portion of the creek has been sluiced, paddocked,
and put through the lap-boxes.
256. There is a considerable depth of tailings from previous sluiciugs and slum upon your ground ?
—Yes.
257. Are you passing that all through ?—We are passing that all through.
258. Where do you obtain water for your work ? —Two-mile Springs, and Hurdle Flat, and Rocky
Creek.
259. Do you obtain the water after auy other company has used it ?—No.
260. You obtain it fresh?—Fresh water.
261. Do you deliver it to any other company ?—Yes, Mr. Pfund’s Company.
262. Then your claim there has a sludge dam ?—Yes.
263. When was that constructed ?—That was constructed at the commencement of the claim.
264. And what was the reason of that sludge dam being constructed?—We had to keep it back,
keep the tailings from going upon the claims lower down, so that they would have clear water.
265. This Avas a sludge dam, not a tailings dam ?—Yes, it holds up sludge and tailings both. No
sludge goes away from our tailings ground.
266. There did not, hut at present all storm-Avater passes over the sludge dam, and doAvn the sludge
channel, does not it?—Yes, the Avater goes doAvn, but very little sludge goes out of the dam, because it is
so flat before it leaves the dam.
267. The sludge dam is uoav filled, is it not ?—Yes, avc keep brushing up as it follows;us.
268. Are you still doing that ?—Yes.
269. You are still endeavouring to stack the sludge ?—Yes, most decidedly.
270. What fall do you find it necessary to have to stack the sludge ?—That is after leading the
boxes out into the tailing ground ?
271. Yes ?—I dare say two inches, or tA\ r o inches aud a-half, avc stack it at.
272. Tavo inches and a-half to the 12 feet ? —Yes.
273. Will the sludge stack at that?—The sludge is stacked lower doAvn; not as it comes out of the
boxes. We stack all the rough stuff there; avo keep a man at the tail to take all the rough stuff out, and
the sludge settles beloAV in the flat country.
274. What length of tail-race have you ?—I cannot exactly say the length of it. I dare say it is
1200 yards.
275. And what portion of that do you usually clean up?—We may clean up 70 or 100 boxes, accord-
ing to lioav long Ave have been running.
276. What is the average fall of the tail-race ?—Three inches to the 12 feet.
277. Do you consider that is the least fall that is satisfactory in your ground ?—We could not do Avith
any less in that ground ; it would be impossible to get the ground aAvay from above with less fall.
278. On Avliat ground do you say that ? —We should be backed up—Ave should just have to stand
and look at the Avater running doAvn to get the flume doAvn again. We could not get the ground away to
any advantage.
279. You cannot get your ground doAvn with under three inches?—No; it is a heavy Avash in our
ground —tailings from claims up above.
280. Your tail-race comes doAvn a considerable distance beloAV the sludge dam I speak of ? Yes
the surveyed line of it does.
281. Ido not knoAV Avhetlier you understand Avliat lam saying about the sludge dam. You have a
tail-race that comes from the bridge upon the Bright-road, that goes down towards Pfund’s ?—Yes; that is
a flume of boxes.
282. Yes ?—There is a thousand or twelve hundred yards of boxes; after it leaves that there is a
sludge dam.
283. That is the sludge; you are talking about tailings and sludge together ?—Tailings and sludge
together, all deposited at the foot of the boxes.
284. Do you endeavour to keep the tailings banked up ?—Yes.
285. Hoav many men does it require to fork those tailings out of the boxes ?—Out of the boxes, Ave
just take four or five men, Avhen Ave are Avasliing up, to fork out the rough stuff ; that is 3 or 4, or 5 or 6
months in the year.
286. At other times, do you fork out from the boxes at all ?—Only pick out the big stuff.
287. To go back to the sludge dam—l Avas talking of a different thing; evidently you do not
understand me. Nearer the bridge, about half-way betAveen PfumPs and the bridge upon the Bright-road,
aboA r e the cross flume that crosses the creek, there is a dam of apparently pure sludge. Did you construct
that ?—I do not understand exactly where you mean ?
288. Say you stand upon the crossing of the Bright-road Avith the Three-mile Creek, the road from
Beeclrworth to Bright ?—That is the Main Buckland-road ?
289. Yes. Standing there, and Avalking down the creek as if you Avere going to Tarrawingee ;
upon the right-hand side of the creek there is a sludge dam, not a quarter of a mile below the main road ;
there is a service reservoir immediately under the sludge dam ?—That is on the right of ■ the company’s'
flume ?


290. Yes?—That does not concern the company at all.
291. That is Avhat I wanted to arrive at—that was not constructed by your company ?—No.
292. Do you know anything about the circumstances of its construction ?—No; that is the creek
sludge that comes down the creek.
293. The storm water from the creek certainly passes over this dam; but this sludge dam is made
right out into the creek ?—I do not know anything about that; that has nothing to do with the company.
294. But you do not know who made it ?—No, I know nothing about it.
295. Do you know where the service dam is?—With clean water in ?
29G. Yes? —That has nothing to do with our company; it has to do with another party.
297. Whom does it belong to ?—Busch and Company.
298. Where are they working ? —ln the creek below me.
299. Between you and Pund?—Between me and Pund.
300. If you had more water would you extend your works ? —Y"es.
301. Put on more men ?—Put on more men.
302. Is there more ground available to work than you at present hold, that you could take up—
I mean, have you taken up all the available gold-bearing ground ?—No, I do not say that at all.
The ivitness withdrew.
Philip Busch sworn and examined.
303. What is your address ? —Threo-mile.
304. What is your occupation ? —Miner.
305. How long have you been engaged mining there?—Over twenty years.
306. You hold a claim there ?—Yes.
307. What is the size of the claim ?—About fourteen acres.
308. How many of those have you worked out ? —About nine.
309. Did you hear the questions that I asked from Mr. Lang in regard to that sludge dam ?—You
did not ask Mr. Lang.
310. I mean Mr. Varley ?Y r es.
311. Can you give any information upon that subject? —That is our water dam.
312. The lower one is your water dam now, the service dam ?—There are two; there is another one.
313. One is completely fdled up with sludge ? —Yes, very near.
314. That was constructed as a water dam ? —Yes.
315. Not with any view of settling slum in any way ?—No.
316. That is no longer used as a water dam ?—Yes, it is.
317. But the storm-water channel runs away at the same lovel now; it is level up to the bottom of the
storm-water channel, is it not ?—Not quite.
318. Mr. Zincke. —Excuse me. That dam was put in—l remember the circumstances very well —to
raise the water up to a certain height.
319. The Witness. —No, no, Mr. Zincke, you are quite wrong; that dam is lower down.
320. By the Board. —Where do you obtain your water from ?—From Three-mile Creek.
321. Has any company used it before you receive it ? —Yes.
322. Who? —Chambers. O’Neill, and Welsh. Three parties.
323. Before you get it ?Y r es.
324. Do you use the water in the condition jmu receive it in ?—Yes.
325. Without any attempt to clear it ?—No, wc have a sludge dam.
326. Do you line! that by settling the sludge you get better results?—YYs.
327. The clearer the water the better the result? —Y r es, we get more earth away.
328. Have you any idea of the quantity of water you get from your watershed —not from the service
dam ?—We get not more than four hours a Aveek iioav.
329. lloav many sluice-heads an hour ?—Eight or nine.
330. About 36 sluice-heads a Aveek ?—Yes.
331. lloav many men do you employ ?—There are tAvo of us Avorking.
332. And Avhat fall have you in you in your tail-race ?—Some have tAvo and a half, two and a quarter,
and three.
333. Is all the tail-race boxed ?—Yes.
334. Do you deliver the water to Pund’s claim ?—No, to a claim below Pund’s.
335. Which is that ?—The Break-of-day.
336. Who is the manager of the Break-of-day ? —That I do not kuow. There are a lot of Chinamen
working there. Ido not knoAv avlio is the manager.
337. What is the proportion of tailings that you throAV out from your boxes compared with the slum
that is removed ?—I do not knoAv.
338. Do you fork out the tailings and remove them ?Y r es, Ave do.
339. Do you make any attempt to stack the tailings ?—Doavu boloAv ?
340. Yes ?—The party doAvn beloAv does it, the same as avc do it upon the top.
341. What is the average depth of your Avorkings —the face?—From eight feet to eighteen feet—
about that.
342. Is it virgin ground, or ground that has been blocked out, or ground that has been sluiced out? —
Some has been blocked out, and some has been sluiced out.
343. Has any complaint ewer been made to you since you Avcre Avorking ?—Never.
344. If you had Avctter seasons, Avould you increase your operations ?Y r es.
345. Were your operations larger before the present cycle of dry seasons came in ?—Yes, they Avere.
346. How many men used you to employ ?—Four.
347. You employed double the number of men, and did double the Avork ? —Y'es.
348. Would you do the same again ?—Y’es, avc Avould.
349. lloav much stuff do you get through in a twelvemonth ? —lloav much acreage ?
350. Yes, take it as acreage ?—Say, a sixth part of an acre.
Sludge. c


351. You liave given us the depth of the face, twelve to eighteen feet ?—Eight feet to eighteen feet.
352. What proportion of that do you say is gold-hearing ?—There are several layers in it. Some-
times there are two or three layers of gravel that are good, and sometimes not ; and sometimes the old
ground worked before has all to be worked from top to bottom. Try wherever you like, you can get a speck
or two.
The witness withdrew.

James Gillies sworn and examined.
353. By the Board. —What is your occupation ? —Miner.
354. For how many years ?—Thirty years.
355. In this district ?—Yes.
356. What is the claim on which you are engaged ? —On the Three-mile.
357. Whereabouts is your claim on the Three-mile—give it me in reference to any other claim upon
which we have been asking questions ?—Below Ah Ping’s claim.
358. Is it below the Break-of-day ?—Yes, immediately below that.
359. Immediately below the Break-of-day dams ? —Yes.
360. Who is the manager of the Break-of-day ?—Ah Ping, I believe.
361. Is it a Chinese claim ? —Yes, it is a Chinese claim.
362. Where do you get your water from? —Our water is stale water. We get it from Telford and
Pund.
363. You get it from Pund, not from Telford, because Pund gets it from Telford ?—I get it from both.
364. Do you ?—Yes.
365. Do you get water from Telford separate from what you get from Pund ?—Yes, I should do,
but at present Ido not. Pund uses it, but we ought to have some distinct.
366. At present you get all the water from Pund ?—Yes.
367. Do you use the water in the condition in which it comes from Pund ?—I take it as it comes.
368. You do not take any steps to clear it ?—I take steps so far as this : I keep all the rough
tailings and sand as far ns I can by brushing it up, but otherwise I take it just as it comes.
369. There is a large stack of tailings just at the end of Pund’s claim ?—Yes.
370. Above the Break-of-day ?—Yes.
371. Is that looked after by Pund or yourself?—By Pund.
372. Have you any service dam ?—No, I have no other beside that.
373. Have you any sludge dams?—No. I tell you I take everything as it comes, with the exception
of the rough tailings. As the tailings come down to where I lift the water, I brush it up and keep them
back.
374. How many men have you got working upon the claim ?—I have 7 men just now. I mostly
have 7,8, or 10.
375. What is the area of the claim?—About 13 acres, I think.
376. And what number of acres have you worked out?—l suppose about 7or 8 acres.
377. And what is the depth of the face in your workings ?—lt will average about 15 feet
I suppose.
378. Are they old workings or virgin ground ?—All old.
379. Have they been sluiced before?—No.
380. Shafts and drives ?—Shafts sunk, and the ground has been driven. The whole of the ground,
about there has been driven at one time or other.
381. Can you give any idea of the proportion of the depth of wash to the face. What is the depth
of your wash averaging ?—The depth of gravel varies from 10 or 12 feet to about 2 inches, but I believe
the real wash that contains the gold would not average more than 6 or 8 inches.
382. Upon the bottom ? —Upon the bottom. Sometimes, where you have a heavy wash like that, you
will get a little gold about 4or 5 feet up; there is what they call a false bottom. Now and then you might
get a little gold upon it, but it might be only in one place, and you might try in half-a-dozen places and not
get the colour again.
383. What is about the length of your tail-race ? —I believe about a mile and a half.
384. What proportion of that is boxed ?—lt is all boxed the whole way down.
385. What is about the fall ?—About two iuches and a quarter —two inches and a quarter to the
box —that is, to 12 feet.
386. Do you employ men to keep the tail-race clear —to fork out ? —No, Ido not. I generally, when
I find the tail filled up, put on more boxes. I find it cheaper to do that than to employ men.
387. What do you do Avith your tailings Avlien they leave the boxes ?—They lodge about the place.
388. You just let them lodge ?—I just let them lodge, and then as the place fills up I put on more
boxes, and carry the tail further doAvn.
389. Do you spread your tailings Avhen they leave the box ?—Yes, they spread for 50 or 100 yards,
or nmre.
390. Do you clean up the Avhole length of the tail-race ?—No.
391. What portion do you clean up ?—Perhaps one-eighth or one-fourth. It just depends.
392. What is the greatest length you haA r e ever cleaned up, or Avill clean up again ?—1 might clean it
all the Avay doAvn some time or other, but I Avould not do it regularly. It Avould not pay. I think the last
time I cleaned up I cleaned up about three-quarters of a mile, and then it did not pay for doing it.
393. What proportion of tailings is there to slum carried away by the Avater ?—I should think about
one-fourtli.
394. The tailings are one-fourtli of the slum ?—Yes.
395. Does any person use the Avater but you ? —Yes.
396. Do they use the AA r ater Avithout attempting to stack ? —Yes, I belicA r e so—no, they do stack.
I may tell you that each claim, as they take the Avater from the claim above them, always stack the tailings
as far as they can.
397. Each claim stacks it from the claim above it ?—From the claim above.


398. That is, you would stack it from Pund's claim, and Fund would stack it from Telford’s ?
Most decidedly, and that is carried on all the way down, I believe, as far as the ground is Avorked. The
tailings that come from Telford’s never go down the creek. They are all lodged in Pund’s claim, or
ground that he has worked, and the tailings that Pund sends down lodge in my claim in ground that I have
worked. It is only the slush that goes down the creek. No rough tailings go down the creek.
399. Could not you work with less fall than 2f inches in the tail ?—No. Of course, I could if I had
plenty of water, but we have not got the water.
. 400. To work with a less fall it would be necessary to put on men to clear the race ?—Men would
not do it; you want water to clean a race, men cannot do it.
The witness withdrew.
Thomas Rankin sworn and examined.
101. By the Board. —Your address? —Hurdle Flat.
402. What company are you connected with ? —The Nine-mile Sluicing Company. ;
403. How long have you been engaged in mining in the district ?—About fifteen years.
404. On that claim for the whole time ?—About two years upon that claim.
405. What is the area of the claim ?—About 20 acres, I suppose, unworked ground in the lease, and
about 20 acres of miners’ right ground.
406. Forty acres? —About 40 acres.
407. Of that 40 acres, is much of it virgin ground, or has it all been worked? —It has been all
worked.
408. All sluiced ?—All sluiced.
409. Where do you obtain water from ?—From tunnels from the hills; springs in the hills.
410. Do you obtain any water that has been used by Messrs. Fletcher and Jessop?—No.
411. It is entirely fresh ?—Yes.
412. Do you use that used by Messrs. Lang ?—No; Fletcher’s claim is at Allen’s Flat.
413. Above Stanley ? —Yes.
414. What quantity of water do you use—how many sluice heads do you think in the 24 hou?£ ?
I could not exactly tell you.
415. Can yon tell us how many hours you work per day ?—I suppose the last twelve months or two
years, since I have been there, wo average about three days a week.
416. For how many hours a day ?—Eight hours.
417. What area have you worked out during the two years you have been there?—l suppose about
acres.
418. You work the whole through.—Yes.
419. You find the gold passing all through ?—All through it.
420. If you had wet seasons, would you largely increase your work ?—Yes.
421. How many men have you now?—Eleven.
422. And how many would you have if it was a wet season, such as we had a few years ago ?
Fifteen or 20 men you might carry in that ground.
423. How many months in the year do you work at the rate you mention ?—We work the year
round, but we do not, carry eleven men all the year round; it is according to the water.
424. How long was the claim working before the two years you mention ?—I could not say.
425. What depth of face have you ?—About 12 feet.
420. What is the fall in your tail-race ?—A portion of it is If inches; the last 30 boxes, I think,
are 2£ inches.
427. You are working with If inches. That is all worked ground; you have not heavy wash have
you ?—lt is all heavy, but I found it would not work. I had to raise the fall, and put it 2f- inches since I
came.
428. A fall of If inches was too little ?—Too little, it would not work it.
429. Does the inch carry away the heavy stuff ?—Yes, but it is not sufficient fall yet.
430. Do you fork out the boxes, and clear away the heavy stuff? —No, just before we turn the water
on we take out the heavy stones, that is all.
431. Do you stack the tailings ?—There is a dam across the tail below our flume, about 200 or 300
yards.
432. Is that constructed by yourself?—l think not; I cannot say; it was there when I went there.
433. Do you maintain it?—No.
434. Some one else maintains it ?—Yes.
435. Is the water used below you ?—Yes, I have seen it; it catches the water, and takes it round.
43G. The people below you look after the stacking of your tailings?—Yes, our tailings are upon the
head of a fall.
437. Have you a service dam ?—Yes, any amount of service dams—three or four of them.
438. If there were more water do you think that there would be an increased amount of sluicing in
the district?—Yes.
439. All over the district?—All over the district.
440. Is the land gold-bearing outside the immediate bed of the creek ?—Yes, all the side hills up
Europa Gully would give gold if there was water enough.
The witness withdrew.
Henry Bolle sworn and examined.
441. By the Board. —What is your address ?—Reid’s Creek.
442. What claim is it you are engaged upon? —The Excelsior.
443. How many years have you been so occupied ?—Twenty-six.
444/ Upon that claim ?—No, nineteen years in that claim.
445 What is the area of the claim ?—Six hundred yards.


446. And how much Ims been worked out ? —I cannot say.
447. How many acres do you think you work in the year ?—About three-quarters of an acre.
448. And the depth of your face ? —From 8 to 14 feet.
449. And how many men do you employ? —Four and live. If water is plentiful we employ more.
450. Do you obtain the whole of your water from the Spring Creek falls ?—Yes.
451. The whole of your water, then, is that delivered oil' from Mr. Fletcher and the Rocky
Mountains ? —Yes.
452. Do you take any steps to settle the water? —No, we could not.
453. You have a large service dam ?—We just take the water as it comes.
454. But you have a large service dam ?—Well, no; in summer time I put a bit of a dam, but as soon
as a bit of a freshet comes it goes away again.
455. You store your water at night, do not you ?—No, not in winter time; we might do it in
summer. This last year or two we have.
456. At present, are you not storing the water at night ? —No, we could not do it.
457. I thought you told the Board that you constructed a dam across that storm-water race nightly,
and cut it away in the morning ?—ln summer the water was clear. TheAvater is too small coming down; it
Avould be useless to us unless Ave store it up to make a head.
458. Do you endeavour to stack the sludge ? —No.
459. Not from those above you?—No.
460. You use the water just as it comes? —Yes.
461. Do you stack your tailings ?—No.
462. Do they go through the tunnel ?—They do.
463. Right doAvn to the falls ?—Right doAvn to the falls.
464. Hoav many men are you employing ?—Four and five —generally five.
465. IRwe you ever employed more ? —Yes, sometimes.
466. Hoav many is the greatest number you have employed ?—Eight and nine.
467. Was that during Avetter seasons ? —Yes, Avetter seasons.
g 468. Does the gold in your claim extend into the banks, or is it all in the bed of the creek ?—lt is
in the bed of the creek.
469. I belieA r e you are working preAuously-sluiced ground ?—Yes, all of it sluiced.
470. No A r irgin ground at all ?—No.
471. What depth of face are you working ?—About from 8 to 14 feet.
472. What was the object of a tunnel for your tail race ? —To lead the creek across it; Ave could not
Avork the ground unless Ave confine the creek to a certain side. To Avork the creek, Are had to keep the creek
along the bank, to keep the flood aAvay from us.
473. So you Avere obliged to leave the creek and run to the falls ?—No, we Avork the creek, and
turned the creek along the bank, and of course, to get across the race, Ave had got to tunnel.
474. What is the fall in the tunnel ?—An inch and a half.
475. Is the wash heavy ?—lt is.
476. And Avhat is the fall nearer your Avork ?—A little more doAvn beloAv; I think it is two inches or
tAvo inches and a half loAver doAvn.
477. Do you find that an inch and a half clears your wash ?—We cannot give it any more; Ave would
give it more if AA T e could.
478. You find it does clear the Avash ?—lt does.
479. Have you to clear out the tail-race ?—No.
480. The water clears itself ?—lt does.
481. Can you give any estimate of the proportion of sludge to tailings ?—I cannot.
The witness withdrew,
John Fletcher sworn and examined.
482. By the Board. —What is your residence ?—Beeclnvorth.
483. And your occupation ? —Bookseller.
484. You have been on the council of the BeecliAvorth Shire?—Yes.
485. And yon held the position of President? —Yes, last year.
486. Can you give the Board any information on the subject of the sludge question, as affecting
yourselves and your adjoining shires ?—Yes; it Avas the sludge leading from the mines in the BeecliAvorth
district that Avent toivards Wangaratta, through the North Ovens Shire and through the Beechworth Shire.
The North Ovens Shire Council obtained a grant of money from the Government, and they constructed a
channel, because it Avas spreading over the agricultural land ; and the Government granted them money
to cut the channel, if they took the responsibility of keeping it in repair. This Avas done up to a certain
point, and they then asked the Beechworth Council to construct a channel up to their boundary. We did
that. The channel is now all but completed, except one little point between the tAvo shires ; and, in con-
sequence of that not being completed, the sludge has filled up the channel made by the BeecliAvorth
Shire.
487. The Board have seen the gap between the tAvo. Prior to your cutting the channel, Aims the
condition of the creek similar to the condition of that part AA r here the gap uoav is—Avas it filled up as that
is ? —Yes.
488. Just as that is ?—Yes.
489. What Avould be the effect, of a flood upon a filling-up like that—used it, in those days, to go
over the lands ?—Yes.
490. And has the excavation of this sludge channel removed the ground of complaint ? —lt Avould
if it Avere completed.
491. What Avould then become of the sludge being brought doAvn ?—lt Avould go right down into the
Ovens River.
492. From your oavu knowledge, are you aAvnre Avbether the QAmns Rh r er is being perceptibly filled ?
*—l cannot say; but I do not think so.


493. At any rate, the sludge does not lodge in your sludge channel, but does go down into the Ovens
River ?—Yes.
494. Are you aware of the size—can you speak from memory of the size of the sludge channel ?
I could not —the documents are in the office here. The difficulty between the two shires is this : that the
portion made in the North Ovens Shire is smaller in carrying capacity than that made in the Beechworth
Shire.
495. However, that is a matter the Board has nothing to do with. Have you ever heard any com-
plaints from graziers or agriculturists upon the Ovens River?—No.
496. Below the junction altogether ?—No.
497. It would not come within your cognizance—No, nor have I heard of it in any way.
498. Have you ever had any complaints to you, in your official capacity, from residents far down the
Ovens River, or even down to the Murray ? —No.
499. No complaint was made to the Beechworth Shire?—No.
The witness withdrew.
John Wilson Morton sworn and examined.
500. By the Board. —Where is your residence ?—Beechworth.
501. What is your position ?—Shire Secretary.
502. How long have you held that position ?—Nine years.
503. Are you aware of any injury having been, or at the present being, caused to agriculturists,
graziers, or roads, through mining operations ? —Lately there have been no complaints, but, in former times,
there was an area of land, about 50 acres, that was covered with sludge to the injury of graziers and farmers
—that is within our shire, down about Tarrawingee.
504. Have the causes of such injury been removed ?—Partially, not completely.
505. Do you believe they will be removed on the completion of the sludge channel ?—Yes.
506. Those interested as landholders, and the councils having control of the roads, will be satisfied
when the sludge channel is completed?—l believe so.
507. Have you had any complaints at all from those abutting on the Ovens River as to sludge being
deposited in the river ?—No.
The witness vnthdrew.
508. The Chairman invited any person who desired to give evidence before the Board to come
forward.
William Williams sworn and examined.
509. By the Board. —Where is your residence ?—Oxley Flat.
510. And your occupation ?—Farmer.
511. How many years have you resided there ?—Seventeen.
512. What is the size of your holding ?—About 500 acres.
513. Are they situated on any creek—will you describe their situation?—The mouth of sludge
channel enters at the top of my holding. lam on the other side of the river.
514. On the opposite side of the Ovens ?—Yes.
515. Opposite the mouth of the sludge channel?—Yes, part of my holding is there.
516. Does your land suffer from the sludge or ddbris brought down by the sludge channel ?—lt has
not to any extent since the channel was cut.
517. What do you mean by “owing to the dry seasons ” ? —No floods ; there have been no floods for
the last seven winters of any consequence.
518. Were you residing upon the Ovens River when there were any floods ?—Yes.
519. What was the largest flood that you knew ?—1867 and 1870, and up to this seven years; this
is the seventh winter there has been no flood of any consequence.
520. What was the effect of the flood of 1870, or a similar flood upon your land ?—lt covered it all,
except a few knobs.
521. Water from where? —From the Ovens River.
522. How would your lands be affected now if such floods were to occur similar to what was
in 1870 ?—There is an area of from nine to twelve square miles situated as I am, and, if we have another wet
season, we shall be the same as Tarrawingee; we shall be thoroughly covered.
523. What will cause your land to be so thoroughly covered as you say? —The Ovens is silting up.
524. The Ovens is silting up?—Yes.
525. To what extent is the Ovens River silting up, to your own personal knowledge?—l see it every
summer there—every one can see it. It is from three to fifteen feet. The deep holes in the river are as
level as this table now for from half a mile to two miles.
526. Putting aside the filling up of the deep holes, and assuming the holes are filled up to the bed
of the creek, what amount of filling up beside that has taken place in the Ovens River up to the present—
can you give us an idea ?—From three to five feet.
527. Above the average general bed of the river ?—Yes, from the mouth of the sludge channel.
528. For what distance ? —For, I should say, half a mile to two miles, and then a little stuff fills up
there as it goes down.
529. In 1870, was there sludge being passed into the Ovens ?—No, Tarrawingee had it then.
530. So that it did not get into the Ovens ?—No.
531. What date was the last flood, did you say, in the river ? —There was no flood of any consequence
for seven winters. This is the seventh, and it is six years.
532. There was a flood in 1880 ?—Yes.
533. During the summer, does the deposit of sludge increase in the Ovens River more than it does in the
winter ?—I do not think it does, because there is no sludge coming down in summer. None has come down
since the sludge channel was cut; there is no water for the miners to work.


534. I do not quite understand you —since the channel was cut is not sludge coming down ?
If we had a wet season the miners could work, then it would fill up winter or summer.
535. As it is now, does it fill np during the summer?—lt does not fill up, because very little work
is done above.
536. What is the effect, have you noticed, of ordinary rains—two or three days rains—with regard to
the silt that is in the bed of the Ovens River; does it carry it further down, and to what extent ?—Yes ;
it is three days in summer unfit for cattle to drink—that is Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
537. Three days in the week ? —Three days in the Aveek.
538. Three days in the week in summer the water is clear and fit for cattle to drink ?—Four days;
and for three days it is not fit to drink when the sludge channel water reaches the river, and the miners
work for three days; it does not come down for one day, Monday.
539. Does that sludge water cause you any injury beyond the filling up of the Ovens River ?—Not
as yet. Still, if the sludge silts the river, what will become of us in a deep flood ?
540. Have you had any of your lands ever flooded over with sludge ?—Not to any great extent.
541. But have you ever had any ?—No.
542. You never had sludge upon your land yet?—Yes.
543. lloav many acres have you ever had sludge over ?—Say about 70.
544. What thickness of deposit of sludge would you have over your 70 acres ?—Not very thick.
545. How many inches —could you say ?—ln some parts, say three inches, and perhaps five in
another, according to the holes, and more.
546. And did that, occur some time ago ?—lt occurred since the sludge channel is cut.
547. That must have occurred quite recently ?—Yes ; even after this little flood there is some there.
548. lloav long ago —is it tAvo years ago or three years ago since you had this sludge ?—Yes.
549. Is there vegetation upon the portion hoav Avhich Avas covered Avitli sludge?—No, there isAvater
over it.
550. Are you sure you are right in the matter of the acreage that has been covered; because, seeing
you say there has been no flood, it appears a A r ery large acreage to have a deposit upon it?—So it is—it is
upon the bends of the river.
551. Then they are subject to periodical deposits of sludge Avlienever there is lavo or three days
rain ?—No.
552. Whereabouts are those bends in the river that have been and are being covered ?—lf you have
a plan I can very soon slioav you.
553. Without getting a plan, Avitli regard to the mouth of the sludge channel, lioav far doAvn the
Ovens River do those bends extend; if avo Avant to go and see the place, give us an idea of Avliere to go
to ?•—Commencing at the mouth of the sludge channel.
554. And running doAvn for Avliat distance ?—Say about tAvo miles.
555. Your land avc understand is immediately opposite the mouth of the sludge channel?—Yes,
part of it.
556. And it runs tAvo miles doAvn the river ?—There is another block bctAveen. My first block is
right opposite; then tliore is a neighbour, and I have a second and a third block again.
557. What is the name of your neighbour on the south side ?—Mr. Charles Connors.
The witness withdrew.
Laurence Murphy SAVorn and examined.
558. By the Board. —Where is your residence ?—One-mile.
559. What is your post-office address ?—Beeclnvorth.
560. What is your occupation ?—Miner, sluicer.
561. lloav long have you been sluicing in the district?—About 30 years.
562. What is the size of your claim ?—lt is considerably reduced iioav. I could not exactly say.
We have been working upon this claim for the last 26 years.
563. You do not knoAV Avliat the acreage is noAV ?—I could not say.
564. Hoav many men have been Avorking upon it ?—From four to seven and eight.
565. Throughout the period ?—Yes, excepting in some dry seasons there might be a slight reduction
in the men.
566. “ During the dry seasons”—you do not call the seasons Ave have had this year and last year dry
seasons ?—We kept four generally employed during last seasons.
567. You remember the times eight or nine years ago, Avhen the seasons were more Avet, had you
more men ? —We'liad as many as six, and sometimes seven, men Avasliing up.
568. Are you Avorking ground that has been sluiced before or neAV ground ?—Ground sluiced in 1857,
at least worked in 1857.
569. What is the depth of your face ? —Close upon 50 feet.
570. And the average proportion of Avash-dirt to the face ?—From 6 inches to 6 feet.
571. Have von any idea of the proportion of tailings to the mullock ?—About 25 per cent.
572. What is the length of your tail race ?—A mile.
573. And the fall ? —From to 3 inches to the 12 feet.
574. Is your Avasli heaA r y ?—lt is not.
575. If it is not heaA r y, could not you Avork Avitli a less fall ?—I could not at that depth; it would
not pay.
576. What do you mean by that depth ?—The quantity of earth that is desired to bo removed and
the small percentage of bottom. You must have a very good grade to take it aAvay and work it profitably.
577. You lia\'e to rush through a quantity on account of the depth of the face ?—Quite so.
578. Where do you get your Avater from ?—From Deep and Iloddle Creek and LoAver Stanley.
579. Do others work it before you ?—Not uoav.
580. What quantity of Avater do you use ?—I should think Ave have from six to eight sluice-heads
for Avorking ours.
581. BeecliAvorth sluice-lieads ?—Yes, Beechworth sluice-heads.


582. How many hours a day do you work ?—Eight.
583. And for how many days in the week ?—Six. ,
584. And for how many months will that extend in the year ?—I should think about eight or nine
months.
585. Do you sluice for the eight hours ; is it all sluicing ?—Yes; sometimes we may fall a bank for
an hour or two before we put the water on. We do that in order to get an increased head.
586. You must understand it is nothing to the Board how many hours you work in a day, except as
regards sluicing. It is only of importance to us to know how many hours the actual sluicing is at work ?
For six to eight months it is at the full period of eight hours a day.
587. And for three months in the year it would be a less time a day ?—Yes.
588. How much do you work in a year, do you think—what acreage ?—I think in the last twelve
months we might have about 60 perches.
589. Do you stack your tailings ? —No.
590. Do you make any provision at all for stacking sludge or tailings, or settling sludge ?—We do
not.
591. Does any company below you use the water ?—Yes.
592. What company is that ? —Ah Ping and party, the Break-of-Day upon the Three-mile.
593. Are you upon the Three-mile ?—No, I am upon the One-mile.
594. Your tail-race runs down and becomes the service-race for the Break-of-Day ?—There is a
service-dam at the lower end of our tail-race which, takes the water, and it is diverted on to the Three-mile
from there. There is what they call a sludge-dam there, which is periodically slummed out, and it is
simply a service-dam to divert the water on to the Three-mile to Ah Ping and party.
595. Then the water that you deliver is the water delivered over that dam—is it ?—Yes.
596. That is very highly-coloured water indeed ?—lt is.
597. Do the parties below you—the Break-of-Day—take the water in that condition ?—They do.
598. But they have a sludge-dam ?—No.
599. Just below that flume there is a sludge-dam ?—No; they have a service-dam this side of the
flume, between the Three-mile and the One-mile; but after a time those dams get filled up with sludge, and
periodically they have to sluice them out to make them serviceable again.
600. That dam is now very nearly full of sludge ? —Yes.
601. And it has retained the sludge perfectly ?—A portion of it.
602. And they will soon have to clear that dam and send the sludge down the creek ?—They will;
the dam is useless otherwise. We have done that for the last 28 or 30 years.
603. Is there a probability of larger and. more extended working ?—Provided we get an increased
supply of water.
604. And if we had wet seasons, what would be the probable percentage of increase of men; would
they employ half as many more men ?—I am satisfied they would employ three times as many men as have
been employed here latterly. For instance the Rocky Mountain, when they have a decent supply of water,
have eighteen to twenty men, and latterly, up to the present rains, they have only three men. The same
applies in a certain proportion to the other claims. There is one remark made by the last witness that I
would wish to give my experience upon —that is about discoloured water. He stated that three days in
the week the water was discoloured, and the cattle did not care about it ; four days a week it was pure in
the Ovens River. My experience is that cattle are very fond of discoloured water, and I have considerable
experience in cattle.
The witness withdreiv.
William Ward sworn and examined.
605. By the Board. —What is your address ?—Eldorado.
606. What is your occupation ?—Bookseller, at present.
607. You wish to give evidence upon the point, you say, of the liking of cattle for discoloured
water ?—Upon that and upon the sludge-dam. Generally my experience is different from Mr. Williams.
I may say I was for years connected with the North Ovens Shire.
608. In what capacity ?—As member, and president for two terms.
609.. Are you interested in agricultural pursuits or grazing ?—Yes, I have land myself, not on that
side; but I know the particulars.
610. Have you got cattle ?—Yes, I have cattle.
611. Were you connected with the North Ovens Shire at the time they constructed the sludge
channel ?—At the time the plans were made, not at the time they commenced the work.
612. At the time the drawings were commenced and the channel made ?—Yes.
613. What was the object of making the sludge channel ?—To relieve the ground of the sludge that
used to come down periodically.
614. Where does that go to? —At present it heads towards the river ; there has been very little down
since it was constructed, at least partially constructed.
615. How long ago is it since it was constructed ?—I suppose it is five years since it was first
commenced.
616. And but little sludge has passed down ? —Very little; the seasons have been very dry; besides
that, you know, there is no direct communication —there is a portion not formed.
617. Supposing that gap were formed, as there is no doubt it will be very shortly, and then Ave
have Avet seasons, would the effect of the sludge channel be to carry large bodies of sludge and tailings into
the Ovens River ? —I do not think large bodies.
618. That Avould not relieve ?—Yes, it Avould relie\'e-; but the discharge Avould not be so large as I
think Mr. Williams seemed to think, judging from Avhat spread over the land for a period of twenty
years.
619. The object of a sludge channel is to relieve the Avliole of the sludge that previously gathered
about TarraAviugee ?—No, you Avould not do that, for some of that is already covered Avith some of the
finest grass down there.


G2O. You could not remove what is already there, hut it would remove that nuisance ?—All you
_ could do would be to remove it from the point of junction, just below the hill. There is nothing you could
take from Tarrawingec proper now; it would he from the Beechworth shire; you would take it from above.
621. At the present time Avhere does the sludge remain if it does not go down the channel?—lt
remains between the portion that is not yet constructed, and back towards the Golden Fall.
622. What is that?—Up towards Beechworth.
623. If wc had a flood, that would all be swept into the Ovens River? —Yes, a portion goes from
Eldorado, and it is divided; some of it goes does down to the Golden Fall.
624. In constructing that channel, what was the opinion of the local bodies as to the effect upon the
Ovens River if the sludge passed down ?—I do not recollect that the question was ever raised through all
those years. There never was any complaint to the council of injury done.
625. The council were satisfied that if it got into the Ovens River it would go away somewhere ?
—Yes.
62G. With regard to any injury to the farmers upon the Ovens River —do you know the Ovens
River? —I know it well; in fact, I had land upon Oxley twenty years ago.
627. Supposing the Ovens River to be filled up, as the last witness said it was filling, would the
effect be to cause flooding over the banks ?—I do not agree Avith him that it has filled up so much—to
nothing like the rate he said.
628. But surely it must be filled up to the extent of the stuff that is taken doAvn into and spread along a
distance ? —As I say, his statement cannot be correct, for for seven years, as he himself said, there has been
a series of dry seasons, it could not have been, in the time he says, raised three or four feet, for thero have
been six dry seasons.
629. You must not make a mistake, there is no object in merely combatting evidence grven by
Mr. Williams —you can leave it to the Board to value the evidence ?—I have known the river for tAventy
years. I Ikia’c crossed it, and had an opportunity of judging.
G3O. The material there being Avashed doAvn, and that Avill go down in the future, Avill go into the
Ovens River ? —Yes.
631. And Avill tend to partially fill that river?—Yes, it must find a place of course.
G 32. Will the effect of partially filling that river cause floods to pass over the banks and flood the
lands adjoining?—Not as far as my knowledge extends. I never heard the question raised of the river getting
so filled up by any single farmer. They have nev r er anticipated that. The complaint has been the fear lest
the sludge floAving down should pollute the Avater. I have ncA r cr heard a single farmer express any fear
that the river Avould be so raised as to flood the land.
G 33. That question has never come before you ?—No.

(Taken at Creswick).
WEDNESDAY, 13tii OCTOBER, 1886.
Present :
R. I-I. Siiakespear, Esq., in the Chair ;
A. F. Walker, Esq., J R. G. Ford, Esq.
James Randell sAvorn and examined.
719. By the Board. —Where is your residence?—At Creswick.
720. And Avliat is your occupation ?—Mining investor.
721. Have you known the district for any length of time ? — For about tAvelve years I. have knOAvn
the district; of course for OA r er thirty-tAVO years since I first came into it, but I have been continually here
for the last eleven or tAvelve years.
722. From your oavii personal knowledge, can you state any cases Avhere the sludge has been pro-
ductive of injury either to the lands or to mining operations ?—I have no doubt it Avould be an injury in
instances here, people living upon the creeks. Of course it must be injurious to some of the landowners,
no doubt.
723. But you cannot speak of any special cases? —No, I am not acquainted with any special case.
724. Do you know of any cases in which mining companies here have been hampered in their
operations, or their operations rendered more difficult in consequence of the difficulty of treating the sludge and
disposing of it ?—Yes, of course, I knoAV cases of companies here that had been put to a considerable
expense in the way of storing of sludge as much as possible, and having to find other channels and outlets
for it, such as making races and so on.
725. Would you mention the name of any companies that have been so interfered with ?—The
Madame Berry especially, being immediately connected with it.


72G. Is mining on the increase in the district? —Well, I could hardly say that it is on the increase
at the present time, there being so many difficulties of late in the district, and that things are not going as
rapidly as they were a few years ago through the different difficulties in the way of sinking shafts. I think
it is not upon the decrease. I would think it is something similar to what it lias been.
727. In the meantime, I speak of the Madame Berry. A portion of that main lead is worked out,
is it not, from the head ?—Yes, from the head,
728. How far is that worked out, I mean—is it worked out down to the Madame Berry ?—Not cpiite
One company there is expected to finish in the course of four or five months, that is further south than the
Madame Berry.
729. Then above the Lone Hand, at No. 2, there is no further difficulty to he apprehended from
sludge ?—No, 1 think not, unless there are some new discoveries.
730. But the present known lead is worked out at present above that ?—Yes, it is.
731. What became of the sludge from the liistori and the Lone Hand No. 1?—It was all sent into
those gullies and ultimately into the creeks, falling into Grlen Donald Creek and so on into Creswick Creek.
I think that is about the course the whole of that slum from the companies in that direction takes. I might
mention here that that was the difficulty that I referred to in the Madame Berry, its regular course would,
have been to have gone down more to Birch’s Creek, and we had to construct channels to bring it into the
old'Creswick Creek, as it had been previously.
732. Then there were flumes and channels, were there not ?—The flumes were simply to keep it
from spreading over the land.
733. There is a flume from the Lord Harry ?—Yes, simply to keep it from being distributed all over
the surface, to convey it down to their channels.
734. And they are constructed to meet the objections raised by the land owners, I suppose ? —ln the
case of their fluming, every acre of land they would have destroyed they would have had .to pay £lO for. The
proprietors, where the fluming is that you refer to, were the owners of the royalty of the land; but the
arrangement with those who took up the mines for mining was that they were to pay £lO for every acre
destroyed, and so they found the fluming would be more economical than destroying the land.
735. They constructed the fluming to meet the objections of the landowners, and to save themselves
from purchasing the land ?—Yes.
73G. There has been a very large amount of sluicing done in former years, has there not ?—I think
so, at Creswick Creek.
737. Slaty Creek ?—Slaty Creek Avay, and the head portion of the old creek.
738. Have they any reason to anticipate that there will be sluicing in the future to any considerable
extent ?—Yes, I think so; it will go on for years, more or less.
739. In a small way it is going on now ?—Yes.
740. Do you anticipate any increase ?—I think it will go on as it is now, sometimes a little more,
and other times perhaps not as much; it depends a great deal upon the prosperity generally of the deep
mines. When some of those miners are thrown out of employment, they go and search for something of
that sort, having their homes here.
741. A sort of fossicking ?—A sort of fossicking; and sometimes they make fresh discoveries and
fresh developments.
742. If we had a series of wet years, say, and we had more Water obtainable, do you think sluicing
would be much increased ? I think, if water was plentiful, there are plenty of places about Creswick that
would be highly remunerative for sluicing purposes, and if they could get the water conveyed from the
higher ranges; that is the great object in sluicing in many cases, to get the water high enough on the ranges.
743. From your own experience of several mines in the district, do you consider tlxero is any prac-
tical or any serious difficulty in retaining the sludge ?—I think the larger portion of it can be retained. Of
course it means cost to the companies in the way that it would be done. In the Madame Berry it might
be done on a larger scale, that is, making dams, and getting as much as possible to settle in those dams
before it goes away; but there is a certain portion of the discoloured water must always go away, and that
must naturally find its way into the water channels. I don’t think any way is possible to settle the whole
of the water from puddling-machines, and so send it away clear. I think, if that was insisted upon being
done, mining would come to a standstill.
744. You know the Madame Berry claim ?—Thoroughly well.
745. And the one joining it ?—Yes.
746. Do not you think it was practicable to settle the sludge to a very much greater extent than it
is done at present ?—I think it could be done, but it would be at a great cost.
747. But why at a very great cost ? —The making of the dams and reservoirs, and settling ponds, as
yon may term them, means a lot of cost and expense.
748. But the dam being made, could the sludge, in your opinion, be satisfactorily settled to a very
much greater extent, if the dams were kept on being maintained at a higher level, and the sludge'allowed
to remain longer in the pond ?—Certainly; the water would come away much clearer, the more dams are
made, and the longer time it is allowed to settle; but I think it would be the means in many cases, where
there are poor mines, of stopping them. Of course, the Madame Berry mine and the Lone Hand have been
exceptionally rich, blit if certain things were insisted upon, some poor mines that I know in this district,
now at work, it would be the means of stopping, going to that extra expense.
749. In the mines you have been speaking of, do they employ men to maintain the banks ?—Yes,
always. We have, in the Madame Berry, always employed men to maintain the banks and to look after
the channels, and so on.
750. Have you any idea of the number of men so employed? —No, I could not exactly say that,
because, at certain times of the year, the manager puts on men at the most favourable season of the year—
he may put on eight or ten men at once in the summer time, when it gets set, so that they can take it out.
751. It is no good to answer a question of that sort, unfess you know of your own positive knowledge
—had we not better get that from the manager of the Madame Berry himself?—Yes, I think so. I think
the feeling of most men connected with mining is, that they desire to store all the sludge that can be done
at a reasonable cost, in the same way as it is done at the Madame Berry. I think that is the feeling of
most of the men lam connected with. Of course we all know the value of good streams of water. Plenty


of them are farmers; also they are well aware that, if things were allowed always to go on as it has done
in the early history of the colony, everything being put in the creeks, ultimately there would be no rivers or
creeks in the colony.
752. Have the Madame Berry and Lone Hand always been delivering water as thickly charged with
sludge as it is now ?—Just about the same as you have seen, possibly there might be a slight variation; but
that is a very fair criterion.
753. You think it would be detrimental to their interests if the dams were kept, say, 18 inches or
2 feet higher than they are at present, and the water allowed to settle in the dam ?—The more expense
they are put to in this subject, it is detrimental to the shareholders.
754. You think that to raise a dam 2 feet would be injurious to the interests of the mine ?—Yes, I
think that is the opinion of the manager, unless you made other dams, he thinks. He keeps the embank-
ments constantly sufficiently high for the purpose. The dam, once it got filled up, in any case would.be
running over, presuming that the embankment now was 2 or 3 feet higher, as soon as ever the water came
to the top of the embankment, tlio overflow would run away just about as thick.
755. Your object is, I presume, mainly to so far clear the water that it will run and get into Glen
Donald Creek ?—Yes, that is just it.
75G. And as long as it gets in there you do not care about retaining any more ?—Well, we have to
keep it clear to run through the races. The race is so flat that they must be very clear to settle that bulk
of matter.
757. The object of settling at the present time is to settle sufficiently to let the water run ?—Yes.
758. Has any complaint to your knowledge been made of the system of working at the Madame
Berry and the mode of disposing of the sludge ?—There have been complaints; first of all we had
some trouble, as I mentioned previously. We had to turn the water to save dispute with some land owners
into the direction it is going now, but since that has been done we never had but one complaint, and, I
think the gentleman who complained in that case Avas not suffering any injury Avhatever, not the slightest;
it Avas only an attempt to levy a black mail on the company.
The witness withdrcio.
William Henry Goro sworn and examined.
759. By the Board. —Where do you live ?—Kingston.
7GO. What is your occupation? —Assistant Shire Secretary.
761. Would you tell us first, if you are aAvare, speaking only from your personal knoAvledge, not
from hearsay at all, Avhether any injury has been, or is at present being caused to either agriculture or
grazing land, or to roads in the district by any mining operations ?—I am not prepared to ans Aver that of
my OAvn knoAvledge.
7G2. Can you tell the Board whether any action has been taken by the local body with regard to the
disposal of sludge from mining ?—I do not think so.
763. Are you aAvare whether any complaint has ever been made on the subject of sludge to the local
body ?—Not since I have been in the office, that is only tAvelve months. I can only speak of the last
tAvelve months.
764. Then is there any point connected Avith the question on which you would like to afford infor-
mation to the Board?—Yes, I can gms suggestions as to the mode of disposing of the sludge.
765. Will you kindly do so ? —Wo approve of taking it by a flumed channel by Allen’s survey from
a point near Wheeler’s Bridge.
7G6. Along Allen’s line?—Yes, through the Lord Clyde estate.
767. We knoAv Allen’s line; you propose to construct a flume along Allen’s line to dispose of the
sludge ?—Yes.
7GB. Where Avould you take it from, the north side or south side of Birch’s Creek ?—The north
side.
7G9. Then how Avon id you dispose of the sludge from the Madame Berry, and the Lord Harry, and
mines on the south side. Would you flume across Birch’s creek ?—Yes, I suppose so.
770. The proposition is to gather them all together in flumes, and carry one main flume into
Creswick Creek ?—lnto one main flume from near Wheeler’s Bridge.
771. Into Creswick Creek ?—Tullaroop Creek.
772. Tullaroop or Deep Creek ?—Yes.
773. That is beloAv the junction of the CresAvick Creek ?—Yes.
774. That is the proposition, to deliver the Avliole of the sludge into Tullaroop Creek?—Yes.
775. But have you any proposition to make Avitli regard to the retention of the sludge upon the
ground ? —Yes, for the mining claims to stack the heaviest of the sludge, and that the other portions which
are the least portion bo taken by the fluming to Tullaroop Creek, and to have Avhat you might call settling
ponds or depths at each mile at flat gradients Avhere it could be still clearer by the time it got to the
creek.
776. Those would be excavated sludge tanks, I suppose ?—Yes.
777. At every mile ?—At every mile.
778. Have you ever considered what Avould be the effect upon the Tullaroop Creek of the continuous
running of this sludge down the channel ?—No.
779. What size of channel did you propose?—Fluming.
780. Fluming ?—About 6 feet Avide and 3 feet deep.
781. Six by three, and Avith a fall of lioav much ? —I am not prepared to say.
782. Have you any remembrance of the quantity of material that you anticipated delivering down
this flume ?—No.
783. Upon Avhat basis did you contemplate making the flume, G feet by 3 feet?—Those are only
suggestions from the shire.
784. Exactly; but avo Avant to knoAv upon Avhat ground the suggestion was made, to ascertain what is
your idea of the quantity of sludge that Avould actually be delivered into the Tullaroop Creek ?—I have not


gone into it myself, I am only here representing my father; he was unable to be present, and he told me to
attend and give what information I could.
785. The portion of the Deep Creek into which you would send the sludge, is that in the Creswick
shire ? —No.
786. That is in another shire ?—Yes.
787. And has the council of that shire been consulted in this matter? —I do not know.
788. You know the nature of the sludge as delivered, have you any instances in your experience to
show that that sludge will travel that distance down to the Tullaroop Creek ?—No, I have not.
789. Your flume would have to follow the natural surface of the ground, of course, from Wheeler’s
Bridge ?—Yes.
790. Is there fall enough from Berry No. 1 and the other mines to get a flume down to Wheeler’s
Bridge—do you know the Beaconsfiehl mine ?—Yes.
791. Would that be capable of discharging into the flume ?—I think so.
792. You believe that that scheme has been so considered that all the claims would be able to deliver
into it ?—Yes.
793. Is this merely a suggestion, a proposal from your father, or does this in any way emanate from
the Council?—No, it is just a proposal from him.
794. Not adopted by the Council at present ?—No, he states that this is the only feasible way he
sees.
795. That is his opinion ?—Yes.
79G. You do not know such a matter as whether, and in which way Mr. Gore contemplated dealing
with these sludge tanks; how to clean them out, and what to do with them ?—No, I do not know what his
ideas are exactly. Ilis idea was to purchase an acre of ground, I think, at each depot.
797. And just fill it up and let it stand?—Yes, let it settle—of course all the was'te water from the
claims would be with the sludge.
" - 798. In other words the proposition was to purchase ground along the channel, and let the sludge
settle there, and not upon the ground at the mines ?—Yes, he said let the heaviest portion settle at the
mine.
799. Who was to pay, did he propose, for this channel?—l cannot say.
800. Were the Government, or the Shire Councils, or who was to pay for it?—l do not know.
801. This was to be a wooden flume, I suppose ?—No, an iron flume.
802. Galvanized iron ? —The ordinary fluming.
803. Have you any idea what the estimate of cost Avas ?—No, Ido not think it was ever gone into.
The witness withdrew .
Joseph Reed sworn and examined.
804. By the Chairman ,—What is your occupation ?—I am town clerk, treasurer, and surveyor of the
borough here.
805. Have you held that position for any number of years ?—The combined position since 1863 ;
town clerk since 1858.
806. Has any complaint ever come to the council on the subject of injury by sludge in this district?—
Ido not remember any. Ido not think so.
807. Has any action ever been taken by the local body here with regard to the disposal of sludge by
the construction of works?—None.
808. Have you experienced any difficulty through the silting up of this creek, the Creswick Creek,
from mining operations ?—I cannot say that we have experienced very much difficulty. The Council have
been put to expense, of course, in constructing a Avail alongside of the creek to prevent an encroachment
on the building side.
809. Is that due to the creek gradually filling from the debris brought down from higher up?—Yes,
the creek has risen. The bed of the creek has risen since the construction of the wall. I suppose it has
risen two feet, silted up by debris coming down from the sluicing operations above.
810. Upon the Slaty Creek ?—Slaty Creek and the Back Creek also; the two creeks join.
811. Do you find the rain brought from the creek has Avaslied out all the material it sent down be-
fore?—Yes, especially Avhere the bridges are. Sometimes a flood comes at the main bridge, and I have
noticed that directly the water reaches the girder, scouring commences at once.
812. It scours and carries it into the main creek ?—-Under the bridge and loAver doAvn the creek.
813. You sell Avater, do you not, for sluicing purposes ? —Yes. There is a Chinese rents the surplus
water from our watenvorks now.
814. Rents the surplus water?—Yes.
815. Is that Ah Soon ?—Yes.
816. Is he the only person?—He is the only lessee Ave have.
817. Lately I suppose that surplus water has been only very small in quantity ?—ln the winter time
there is a considerable quantity for sluicing operations;
818. Have you not experienced more dry seasons lately than usually is the case — have you as much
surplus Avater now as you used to have, and as you might have again if Avet seasons set in ? —No, I think not,
the last two or three years the seasons have been drier.
819. Do you think you Avould have applications for a larger amount of Avater, if you were able to
dispose of it for sluicing?—No, I scarcely think so; I think sluicing operations will be upon the decrease year
after year as far as my knoAvledge goes of the district, the greater portion of the sluicing ground has been
Avorked over. Some of the old diggings yet, Humbug Hill for instance, I believe the Avholo of that hill
would be sluiced aAvay if Avater could be got to it easily. There is a valley intervening, and it requires
wooden fluming to reach it. Just to the Avest of the toAvnship, some 20 years ago, the sludge channel from
the Hard Hill and Nuggetty Gully came down into the toAvn, just after the formation of the municipality,
and we constructed a new sludge channel along the west of the toAvnship.
820. A neAv sludge channel ?—A neAv sludge channel, and took it into the creek—we got a Govern-
ment grant of £l,OOO to do that.


821. You remember the creek many years ago, you say ?—Yes.
822. Have you seen any difference in the creek as regards its being filled up now from what it was
then ?—When I knew the creek first, there was no silt in it.
823. How many years is that ago ?—Thirty-two years, since I came to Creswick first.
824. What rise in the bed of the creek do you think has taken place during that time ?—ln places
not more than two or three feet; you would find in some places the old bed of the creek still, the silt has
shifted every year in every flood.
825. Shifting always down ?—Shifting always down.
82G. You consider then, that as far as Creswick is concerned, the injury that is caused by sludge is
on the decrease ?—Yes, you find that the old debris, that settled in the creek up, is being shifted down evei'y
year. For instance, above Allan’s Bridge, there Avas a place there with a lot of Chinese a few years ago,
and we endeavored to prevent their running the sludge into the creek, because it was likely to injure one of
our bridges, and it did, and eventually we took action against them; but as I could not prove that any
damage was already actually done to the bridge, though I stated In my ev : dencc I was certain the damage
would be done to the bridge, and it did, wo lost the case. Tins accumulation of quartz tailings is being
shifted lower down the creek with every flood; but as far as sluicing operations go, they are on the decline
altogether.
827. Is the Glen Donald Creek within your district?—No, that is in the shire.
828. Can you give any idea of the quantity of water that you dispose of to Ah Soon I —Six or
eight sluice-heads perhaps. We have three sources of supply: we have the Dene reservoir, and since then
the council have purchased two other mining tenements. One called Bragg’s dam, which we use as our
reservoir, running the Dene water into it; and then they purchased the St. George’s right on Slaty Creek.
829. Is that as high as the Slaty Creek?—Yes.
830. You are aware that a party of Chinamen are working upon the Slaty Creek, some distance
above Mopoke ?—Yes; but Mopoke is a branch, that is not upon the Slaty Creek.
831. I know; but up the Slaty Creek, we will say, about a mile above Mopoke, there is a party of
Chinamen working ?—That may be the same Ah Soon; he may be letting the Avater to those parties.
832; The Avater is taken from up the creek, upon the dividing range —is that Avater sold by you ?
If it is taken from Slaty Creek it is ours, and Ave convey it through private land belonging to a person
of the name of HoAvard.
833. In that case, the Avliolo of the sluicing at present done on Slaty Creek is done Avith your
Avater ?—I do not knoAv that. If it is from the water of Slaty Creek those Chinamen lease the Avater—Ah
Soon.
834. It is all included in the six to eight sluice-lieads ?—Yes, he has the surplus water from all our
sources.
835. Do you knoAv of any other source of supply, except from your oavix dams?—Yes; Mr.
Roycroft, for instance, has a supply.
836. Where is that?—From the Back Creek; it passes one of our reservoirs. He has got a dam
upon the Back Creek, known as Eaton’s dam.
837. Independent of you ?—Yes, this Eaton had a large Avater supply for many years, and did a
great deal of sluicing, and I believe they sell that for sluicing purposes now, and there is a battery also
gets Avater from him noAV.
838. Have you any idea of the quantity of water he could dispose of ? —I should think a very large
quantity, for all of it he collects he lets for mining purposes.
839. As much as yourself—six or eight sluice-heads ?—I should think so in winter time —that is,
he has that quantity of Avater lam sure—l do not say he disposes of it.
840. You calculate your sluice-heads, I suppose, at about a million gallons a Aveek—you see sluice-
heads vary so much in the country ?—A sluice-liead, I believe, in this part is 16 inches by 1 inch, Avith a
head of 6 inches.
841. Would you have any objection to tell us Avliat is the rental paid to you for the water per
sluice-head ?—lt is not paid for by sluice-head at all. We have advertised, and could not get parties to tender
for our surplus Avater; that Avould give you an idea of the quantity of sluicing done. This Chinese has now
taken the surplus water from the watenvorks for three years for £4O, and he had to do certain repairs to
Bragg’s dam, and to keep our races in repair, and keep the toAvn reservoir supplied, and he takes the surplus
Avater, Avhen the water runs oA-er the bye-Avash.
842. Is he restricted by you in any Avay as to the price he shall charge others ? —No.
843. Is that £4O a year ?—£4o for three years; he has to keep the races clean, and keep up a supply
for the inhabitants, and Avhen the reservoirs are below the bye-Avash he ceases to use the surplus water till
they are full again—that is if required.
844. Could you give us information as to the period during Avhicli the creek has been mostly filled
Avith the sludge—is it from old Avorkings, or has it been going on constantly and gradually ?—For the last
foAV years it is not from the sluicing operations so much, as from the shifting of the debris from old opera-
tions—every year, every freshet, the accumulations up-stream are being shifted doAvn.
845. Do you remember in the old days, when this large amount of sluicing Avas done, that evidently
has been done in the district, have you any idea as to Avhat Avas the maximum number of men employed in
sluicing at that time ?—No, I have not; there Avere a large number of sluicing parties, and generally, I think,
a sluicing party would comprise ten or tAvelve men.
846. You have no idea lioav many parties?—l have not.
847. And hoAV many years did the sluicing continue ?—The sluicing has been going on these tAventy
years, I suppose. It is fully tAventy years and more than that, since they commenced —twenty-five years
probably.
848. Was not there a rush in the matter of sluicing for some years ?—Yes, about that period—
tAventy-five years ago; there were several large parties then sluicing all round the place, wherever they
could carry the Avater at that time.
849. That Avas the time that the material was carried doAvn into the creek? —Yes, into the bed of the
creek; but lately the sluicing is not a tithe of Avhat it Avas.
The witness withdrew.


Christopher Russell sworn and examined.
850. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—Miner.
851. And where do you carry on your operations ? —Cabbage-tree.
852. What is the size of your lease there, or claim ?—We have no lease; we merely hold under
miner’s right.
858. Can you tell me what is the area of the ground you propose to work?—We have done the
sluicing we intend doing this year, and now we are engaged cleaning up the bottom, and it is slightly over
half an acre what we have shifted.
854. Where do you obtain the water from?—From Ah Soon.
855. And what quantity do you get from him ?—One sluice-head.
856. Does he supply that to you for a period only, or throughout the year ?—He supplies it when he
has a supply to give us; at times we have only half, and sometimes perhaps only a quarter.
857. You cannot depend upon the quantity you have ?—Only during the wet season.
858. How many months in the year do you work ?—We worked twenty weeks and two days at the
sluice-head; that is putting it all down. Sometimes it was only a quarter, sometimes three-quarters, some-
times a half; it would make twenty weeks two days at the present time.
859. What is the average depth of your face ? —Something like seven feet, I should think.
860. And the average depth of your washdirt ?—lt is old ground, and in many places it has been
taken out entirely.
861. The ground has been driven and blocked out ?—Yes.
862. Not sluiced before ? —No, not sluiced.
863. And how long have you been at work to get the half-acre out?—W’e have been all engaged
making a dam we required, to settle the night water; we have been there since the 14th-of February last.
864. How much do you anticipate being able to work per year; what area of ground ?—Yery likely
if we were to go to another place, we should not shift so much, because the ground being sandy in nature,
is very favorable to work, and we have also the advantage of a very good fall.
865. You are now working upon Cabbage-tree G-ully ?—We are working upon a slope rising off
Cabbage-tree Flat.
866. If you went to any other place, would it still be commanded by your same race and dam ?
There are places that that dam would command. There is probably another season’s work there in the
same place.
867. You expect to do another year’s work there?—Yes.
868. Do you think that there are many acres of ground available for sluicing that would bo payable?
—Yes, I think if the water could be had at the same rate that Ah Soon has it from the council, or even a
little more.
869. What you mean, if you could get the water at the price you are paying Ah Soon ?—No, I
mean at the price Ah Soon pays to the council or anything like that price; but we already owe him more
for the one sluice-liead than he owes to the council for the whole.
870. How much do you pay Ah Soon ?—Sixteen shillings a week for the sluice-head.
871. That sluice-liead you calculate at 16-inch, as we got it before ?—Yes.
872. And you consider that that is a high price to pay for the ground, such as it is ?—Yes; I con-
sider that, at 10s. per sluice-liead, there is a good deal of ground a man might make wages out of.
873. Do you think that if there was water, sluicing would largely increase up that creek?—Not
largely increase, but it would increase to some extent.
874. Would it double ?—Yes, I think it would double.
875. Is yours ground-sluiciug ?—Yes, ground-sluicing; what is termed ground-sluicing.
876. What becomes of the sludge and debris —the past year’s sluicing ?—lt empties into the Slaty
Creek.
877. Do you make any attempt at all to settle it or store it ?—No.
878. You told us, I think, that you had been some years upon Cabbage-tree Flat ?—Yes; I have
been a good many years employed in mining, but this is the first year I -have gone to any extent into
ground-sluicing. I have done a good deal of box-sluicing before.
879. Do you know this locality well ? —Yes, I have been here ever since my childhood.
880. Has the Slaty Creek, near Cabbage-tree Flat, altered very much?—Yes, considerably. The place
where I live, I remember when there -was no sand or tailings covering the flat. Then there was no forma-
tion of that creek; it went into a broad flat in those days.
881. No distinct defined water channel? —Not in that particular part; but further up and lower down
there was a defined water track, but in that particular part there is a deposit of, I should say, 18 inches of
sand and slush all over the flat, and then the water cut through it and wont lower than it did before and
left the sand and deposit above the present height of the creek.
882. Is the sand and sludge coming down the creek still?—Yes.
883. From further up ?—Yes.
884. Has it travelled down much?—Yes; up. where the operations Avere carried on formerly to a
greater extent than they are now, the tailings have loAvered considerably.
885. That is Tavistock ?—Further up than Tavistock; further up than the party of Chinamen you
spoke of.
886. Do you know the party—the four Chinamen I spoke of ?—I have seen them. Ido not know
them.
887. Are there any Avorkings further up than they are ?—Yes ; further up there is a party of
Europeans where Mr. Woolf is Avorking.
888. Are they taking Avater from the Council ?—No, that is nothing to do Avith the Council’s supply
whatever.
889. Those Chinamen—have they anything to do with the Council ?—No.
890. Where is that water taken from ?—I am not positive, but I think the creek is called Drake’s
Creek; it forks there about Mr. Woolf’s place.
891. It is a fork of Slaty Creek ?—Yes. The Council draAV their supply from the left hand branch
of the creek, but the Chinamen take it from the right hand; but Avhom the Avater-right belongs to I cannot
say.


892. You know the claim ?—Yes.
893. Is it previously worked ground ?—Yes.
894. Has it ever been sluiced before ?—Portions of it have been sluiced away; but you understand,
when ground has been ground-sluiced once, it is taken out and cannot be sluiced again; it is shifted entirely
away. The portion that is worked is entirely shifted and deposited into the creek or gully, as the case
may be.
895. Is this European party using this water from the same source—Drake’s Creek ?—I think so,
but I am not positive.
896. You do not know whether the water that the Chinese use is the same water that has been pre-
viously used by the Europeans ?—I, could not say, but Ido not think so.
897. You knew the creek down here, below the junction of the Back Creek in the old days ?—Yes.
898. Is that very much silted up below where the Slaty Creek joins the Back Creek ?—Yes, con-
siderably.
899. How much do you think ?—ln parts of it three feet or more, I think.
900. Is it still on the move during the winter rains ?—Yes; in flood times it will cut down.
901. Of later years, is the creek about Cabbage-tree getting clearer ?—Yes.
902. Is the silt getting away from it ?—Yes, the water is clearer than it used to be formerly.
903. What becomes of your tailings, you tell us that the sludge goes into the creek—what becomes
of the tailings ?—The greater portion of them are lying upon the flat, upon the banks of the creek, before
the water falls into the creek.
904. It is the light wash, is it not ?—Yes.
905. The tailings go away in the sluice ?—The gravelly portion of it does not go into the creek,
but a little portion; the clay and sand go into the creek.
906. Can you give any idea of the proportion of clay and sand as against the tailings ?—I should
think upwards of a third of it goes into the creek.
907. The remainder being kept in the sluice, and on tho ground ?—Yes.
908. Are you aware whether any complaint is ever made of the effect of the sluicing upon the creek
or the lands adjoining the creek ?—Not to my knowledge.
909. Have you any idea, from your own knowledge of the creek, of any means by which the further
carrying down of the sludge into the creek can be prevented ?—No. There is a simple matter that I might
mention that I have noticed upon the creek—that is, above the Clunes Waterworks —there have been
sluicing operations carried on there, and in former days (not to the extent it has been here), but their
water has afterwards to pass through a flat, where there is a very thick groAvth of reeds and grass, and I
notice that the slush is entirely dammed back by that, and you can scarcely notice the colour after it passes
through it. The water goes down into the Clunes Waterworks after that, and four miles down you scarcely
see that the water is coloured.
910. You say you have been sluicing before?—Yes.
911. In what direction ?—ln the same locality, but I have been working out there at times, and
noticed it.
912. Have you ever been sluicing where any attempt was made to stack or settle the sludge or
tailings ? —No.
913. Where is the growth of reeds?—lt is upon what they call the Pinchgut Lead, not far from
Rocky Lead; it is about a mile and a half in the west direction from Rocky Lead.
914. How far is that above Smeaton—we should like to see the place if you can describe it to us ?
—lt is a long way above Smeaton. I should think it is six miles above where the sluicing was done
upon the Clunes Waterworks.
915. Six miles above the weir ?—No, six miles above the waterworks; probably you have not seen
it; it is an out-of-the-way place, and not many people have seen it—it is at a place called the Old Victoria
Sawmill.
The vntness withdreiv.
John S. Patterson sworn and examined.
916. By the Board. —What are you ?—Mining manager of the Davies Freehold Company.
917. That is situated, where ?—On what we term Glen Donald, between Glen Donald and Green
Hills, Charleston.
918. What is the depth of your working ?—266 feet.
919. Have you any idea of what that represents above the sea level?—l could not say.
920. Do you know the surface of the ground above sea level ?—Yes, I can tell you—[ referring to
a^ocket-boolc\ —surface level at south bore, 1362 ft. 11 in.
921. That is surface level ?—Surface level.
922. And you have given the depth of the shaft ?—The depth of the shaft is 300 feet; we have got
two shafts—we have one 400 feet farther north.
923. What is the depth of the bottom of the wash ?—266 feet.
924. What is the average width and average depth of the wash ?—The depth of the wash, of course
what we have got to take, is from four to five and six feet of wash at times, and at other times perhaps a
foot of wash; we are never satisfied without we get a foot of wash, but a foot of wash carries all the gold.
925. And about an average width of ?—The width is hundreds of feet wide.
926. You cannot tell?—We cannot tell—everywhere we go.
927. It is broader and narrower at places ?—lt is a great wide field of wash; there is over 2,000
feet of wash.
928. What is the length of your claim ?—A mile and a half.
929. How long have you been at work ?—We have been at work
930. Actually raising wash ?—Actually raising wash, five years.
931. And what length of wash have you worked out in that period ?—About 600 or 700 feet; it is
not finished yet, but we have been operating upon that length.
932. In five years, 600 or 700 feet ?—Yes.


933. You have several yaars’ work before you, then ?—Many years’ work.
934. What is the mode of working ?—We raise the dirt, the wash-dirt, and put it in machines —
puddling-machines—which are erected high above the surface, and it is puddled there, and dropped down
through the machine on a plat underneath, and sluiced from there.
93f). How many puddling-machines do you use ? —We are using two at present, but we expect to
use four.
93G. How much do you put through the puddling-machines in 24 hours?—We put through
some days two machines, some days three, and some days one. There are about seven or eight parties of
men below, working from three shafts.
937. What I want to arrive at is, is the quantity of material passed in 24 hours through your
puddling-machines, and the quantity you are actually raising ?—Of course 1 am not prepared to give you
that exactly.
938. Somewhat near it ?—There are so many different levels, and levels of working that are not
raising wash at all.
939. How many machines do you put through per month ?—You may put down twelve machines a
week.
940. Have you any idea of the quantity of water that is used ?—Of course we have got a 12in. lift
going about three parts of the time, and we raise more water than we require for our use. Of course I was
not prepared to give that.
941. Have you any idea of the proportion of slum to the tailings ?—There is moro slum than there
is tailings.
942. Yes, of course, more slum than tailings?—Yes.
943. You have no idea of the relative proportion?—No, the dirt is divided into two parts; the
stones are all taken off, and the tailings left clear.
944. What do you do with the tailings ?—They drop upon the claim.
945. You stack them upon the ground ?—Yes.
' * 946. And with regard to the slum ?—That drops there too ; the great bulk remains there, and the
rest goes to the creek.
947. You have got sludge dams ?—No, we have no sludge dams.
948. Do you settle the water for re-use at all ?—No.
949. You run the sludge straight away ? —Straight away.
950. Into Glen Donald Creek ?—lnto Glen Donald Creek. And it runs from there to Creswick
Creek.
951. Has any complaint over been made to you on account of sludge being run into the Glen Donald
Creek ?—No.
952. Do you know of any having been made at all to your own personal knowledge?—Well, some
time ago, before this motion started at all, there was a complaint; hilt since that the party did not trouble
about it.
953. Would there be, in the case of your mine, any practical difficulty in constructing a sludge dam,
such as is done in other places ? —No, if it was necessary we could do it, but the sludge that leaves the
claim of course does not fill up the creek; it makes no difference to the creek.
954. Why ?—The sludge has been running there for many years, and when a heavy shower of rain
comes, of course it all goes; it is just the same this year as it was twelve years ago.
955. It goes further down ?—I do not know where it goes; it goes away, but the heavy part remains
on the claim.
956. How does it remain upon the claim, in a dam, or does it run clean over the surface anyhow ?
—lt is very thick when it leaves the machines at first, and of course it settles before it goes out of the
claim.
957. Does it spread over the ground?—Yes.
958. Could you give us information as to the quantity of stuff you put there, if we were to send you
some questions upon the subject ?—Yes, I could answer you then.
959. Your address is where ?—Holinwood.
960. The sludge from the Madame Berry and Lone Hand comes in above your junction with the
creek ?—Yes, comes above, where ours goes into Glen Donald.
961. And the drainage from Ristori and Lone Hand No. 1 also used to come in there, did it not ?
Yes, and the Loughlin.
962. Any others ?—There was the Dyke’s North-west, and Dyke’s, and all the old claims higher up
towards Spring Hill.
963. At the time those claims wore in work was the Glen Donald Creek more full of sludge than it
is now ?—The first two or three years it was just as full as it is now. I lived there, and I own a little bit
of ground there, and keep a few cattle, and of course I know all about it. I have been here eighteen years,
and I see no difference in Glen Donald Creek from what it was two years after the mines started.
964. Then you look upon it, I suppose, that the winter rain is sufficient to carry away as much
sludge as accumulates during the year ?—Yes.
965. And sends it away down somewhere else ?—Yes; if the mines were stopped the whole would
be cleared, if it Avas a good winter, a wet season, that Avould be all clear next season.
966. Did you hear Mr. Gore’s evidence?—No.
967. Have you heard of a proposition by Mr. Gore to construct a flume to carry the sludge doAvn to
Tullaroop Creek ? —I did not hear of it—l have my oAvn vieAvs upon it.
968. You have not heard of it outside ?—No.
969. Would you give us your views upon the matter?—My vieAV is that it would be far better to
alloAV the drainage from all the mines to go into the creek below the Aveir.
970. Togo into Birch’s Creek?—Yes, and to carry Avater, and supply the district Avith pure Avater
along the creek, it Avould be far easier and cheaper to run pure Avater on one side. There is the Cluues
Reservoir and the Climes pipes, they could all be supplied Avith them, and on the other side they could
be supplied with pipes going across the creek.
Sludge. e


971. Mr. Gore’s proposition is to construct a sludge channel, and keep Birch’s Creek full of clear
•water —your proposition is to make Birch’s Creek a sludge channel, and make a channel for the clear
water? —I do not think they cankeep the sludge out of the creek; it will be polluted any way.
972. You have been mining a good many years ? —Yes, I have been mining over thirty years.
973. You have seen claims where the sludge is stacked ?—Yes, where you are compelled to stack
it. You can stack it; but still, notwithstanding, there is dirty water runs in, because the dam gets full, and
of course it overflows.
974. That is because the dam gets full ?—Yes.
975. But if the dam was not allowed to get full, or if other dams are made, or these are kept higher,
does not the water then settle sufficiently to ruu out really clear?—l think the dams would get full in spite
of you ; you could not keep them down, if mining operations are carried on to any extent.
976. You think it is impossible to keep constructing dams so as to retain the sludge ?«—Yes.
977. Then what object is there in constructing sludge dams to the extent to which they have been
constructed?—Of course what they have done is to keep the heaviest of it away, and some parties have
done it to conserve the water, where they have been short of water. In the case where they have been
short of water, as some mines are, there is no sludge goes away at all, but there are a great many mines
which have got twice the quantity of water that is necessary.
9 1 78. Where a mine wants to conserve its own water for its own use, it can stack the sludge so that
the water is not sent out in an impure condition ? —Yes, where it is not extensive mining.
979. You know the Madame Berry and Lone Hand ?—Yes.
980. You know they have sludge dams ?—Yes.
981. Do you think the water leaves their dams in as pure a condition as it could be made to leave
them ?—lt is quite dirty, when it comes along the drain, for a mile after it leaves them;
982. Practically, there is no settlement at all in what runs down at the present time, is there ?
There is settlement.
983. Very little ?—The heaviest of it remains behind, but the dams here, where there is such a
quantity of water, get full, the reservoirs that are erected for it, and the water must go away —it is
impossible to keep it.
984. It has been stated that the object in the construction of the sludge dams of the present is
simply to clear water sufficiently to enable it to run ?—That is right.
985. You say there are some mines where they conserve the water, and re-use it; can you tell us
the name of any such mine ? —I could not name one now, hut I have done it myself to a great extent.
986. You have done that yourself—in the case whore you have done it, did you deliver what water
you delivered clear ? —Not clear, but we delivered so that we could use it again.
987. Discolored ?—Discolored.
988. So that stock could use it—was it in such a condition that cattle would drink it?—Yes, it could
be used by cattle.
989. The water at present delivered into Glen Donald Creek is not in a condition to he used ? —No,
it is too thick.
990. Do you think that the expense of constructing sludge dams to settle the water would be a
very material matter in the management of a mine—your own, for instance?—Of course it would entail
considerable expense. Our mine is a very poor mine, and every addition to labour
991. It is a mere question of labour, of course ? —Yes, and that adds to it.
992. What it entail upon you to do that, say the landowner insisted upon it ?—lt
would take £2 a week.
The witness withdrew.
William Guthrie Spence sworn and examined.
993. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—Secretary to the Miners’ Association and
commission agent.
994. Can you give us any information, from your own knowledge, upon the sludge question ?—ln
a general way. Of course 1 have a good knowledge of the district, and of some of the difficulties that the
companies have had in connection with it.
995. Would you state some of those diffiulties ?—The principal difficulty that occurred some time
back was the injunction stopping some companies from running their sludge and water at all.
99(5. Would you give us the circumstances of it ?—That was two of the mines, the Madame Berry
for one, and the Australasian the other. Ex parte injunctions Avere obtained by landoAvners against them,
and Avork was ordered to be suspended on that account, throwing out of employment a very large number
of men as well as damaging the property of the companies.
997. What action Avas taken in consequence ? —The difficulty Avas got over, I think, by the action
being withdraAvn, and legislation Avas asked for since to deal Avith the difficulty.
998. You mean the Sludge Act?—Yes.
999. Has any action ever been taken under the Sludge Act?—No.
1000. Then the Sludge Act has not tended to settle the difficulty ?—lt only opened the way, but no
steps haA r e been taken yet. The difficulty Avith the Madame Berry Company Avas got over by the company
arranging with other landoAvners to run over their property and paying for it. The party avlio obtained the
injunction was shunted by that means, othenvise the mine Avould have had to stop. In one case the sludge
Avas running from the Madame Berry into the Glen Donald Creek mentioned by Mr. Patterson.
1001. It is run iioav into the Glen Donald Creek ?—Yes. So is the Lord Harry sludge.
1002. So is the Lone Hand ? —Yes.
1003. At that time Avere they running out it over the surface of the land ?—They Avere storing it as
much as possible.
1004. Prior to the injunction?—Yes, as much as possible; the drainage Avas running away then.
1005. Was the drainage running aAvay then just as it is now ?—The drainage noAV is turned.
1006. 1 do not mean the chaunel, but Avas it of the same character of drainage that there is now?—
Yes, hut the sludge is run aAvay iioav iu the drain.


1007. More sludge is now running away than there was at the time before the injunction ? —Yes.
1008. Then they were storing sludge more at that time t han they do no tv ?—I could not say
positively as to that—the manager would be able to give you that more definitely.
1009. In what condition was the water at the time that this injunction was obtained; was it fit for
stock at that, time ?—No.
1010. Are you a practical miner?—Yes, I have been mining for many years.
1011. Was there any difliculty in their storing their sludgo so as to send down the water in a fit
condition for stock ? —The Avater Avould be scarcely fit. It Avould depend largely upon the character of the
alluvial Avash; the most of the mines in this district the Avater is very good.
1012. We are talking hoav of those particular mines?—Take all those mines the Avater has not so
much mineral in it that it is injurious. In some places, like the Australasian mine, the Avater Avould be
perhaps detrimental to stock and for other purposes, it avms so thick.
1013. I am not talking of the quality of water noAv, I merely talk of the quantity of sludge in it?
—lf that could be settled, it becomes clear enough. Ido not think it could be at all injurious.
1011. Could it be so settled ? —With ditliculty it could.
1 015. What is the difliculty ?—You must have a very largo dam, and a long time to settle.
101 G. What time do you think it Avould take to settle ? —lt Avould depend upon the supply of Avater
at the time. At the Madame Berry, puddling operations are upon a tolerably large scale; it Avould take
a long time for that sludge to settle—to let the Avater run OA'er. I do not think tAvo feet Avould be sufficient
to let it become clear enough. It just depends upon the amount of water coming.
1017. Idas it been tried ?—lt has been tried to a certain extent.
1018. Have you ever seen any dam Avhere there was eighteen inches or two feet of Avater ? —I could
not call to mind positiA r ely. I have seen them a foot deep of Avater at least. I could not say I have seen
tAvo feet.
lOl9. Where you suav it a foot in depth, did the sludge settle ?—The sludge settled pretty Avell;
but a certain amount of it got nAvay, and the Avater Avas not fit for stock. It would tend to pollute a creek.
1020. What depth do you consider would be sufficient if two feet is not enough ? —lt altogether
depends upon the quantity of Avater that has to pass through, and that depends upon the amount of puddling
being done; and another point is the rclalNe amount of material in the Avash-dirt that goes aAvay as slum
compared Avith tailings. Tailings become clean and settle. Wash-dirt in some mines has a great deal of soft
material in it, that goes aAvay as sludge —soft pipe-clay, for instance—that takes a long time for Avater to
settle. There is a great deal of soft pipe-clay in it.
1021. Has the Miners* Association as an association discussed the matter of the disposal of sludge?
—Only so far as pressing the Government to deal Avith it. We have not discussed any particular practical
scheme of dealing Avith it.
1022. Have you suggested to the GoA*ernment any particular means of dealing Avith it ?—No, only
by deputation generally. We left the details to be discussed.
1023. Did you hear the evidence given by Mr. Gore ? —Yes.
1024. You heard his scheme ?—Yes.
1025. Has that scheme ever come before the association ?—No, not before the association; only
before the officers. We, however, discussed it. As to the suggestion of Mr. Patterson, I Avonkl say that
that would depend A’ery largely upon the amount of fall that you could find, and as to the relative cost of
the two schemes.
102 G. Which do you call the t\v r o schemes ?—The one suggested by Mr. Patterson.
1027. You mean making BirclPs Creek either a clear water channel or a sludge channel—those you
call the two schemes ?—Yes.
1028. Have you at any time formed any opinion of your own upon the question of sludge ? —Only
one of those tAvo schemes.
1029. That is, you have only considered a scheme for getting rid of it into the Tullaroop Creek ?
Yes, either in the Avay indicated by Mr. Gore or Mr. Patterson. Both haA r e been before the public of this
district, and the difference is very much as to the relative cost over a period of years in the future, and there
is the calculation of the cost of fluming. The amount of sludge it Avould carry aAvav, Avhich Avould depend
upon the fall, for if they had to form dams to settle the sludge, that Avould be an additional cost which
would be done away Avith in the other case. My opinion, from Avliat I have seen of the sludge in several
of the creeks is, that it is not Avhat might be called a permanent injury; and when mining operations cease
in a few years, and the creeks become cleared, the sludge upon the banks of the creeks Avill grow grass. I
have seen a garden Avhere there was an old sludge bed groAving A r ery good vegetables. It is only temporary
injury to it; I do not look upon it as a permanent injury altogether.
1030. If the objection raised by the agricultural interest is principally that the water is rendered
unfit for stock, the Avliole difficulty could be got rid of if the sludge is sufficiently settled to enable the
Avater to be clear enough for cattle? —Yes, it Avould not be injurious if it is clear enough, from Avliat I
know of the Avater and its taste ; I have drunk Avater myself underground that has come away.
1031. And the sole question is as to Avhcther the cost Avould press hardly upon the mining interest?
—Yes.
1032. It is not a question of Avhether it can or cannot be done; it is only a question of money in your
opinion?—Yes, you can never settle it so as to become perfectly clear; there will ahvays be some drainage
even from the dam you settle it in.
1033. Could not it be so cleared as to send to Birch’s Creek?—That could be done without injuring
stock.
1034. Simply discoloured Avater?—l think so; it is simply a question of cost.
1035. Do you knoAV of any instance in Avhich the sludge has-been stacked successfully and the water
rendered clear enough for cattle ?—I could not call to mind any particular instance; the sludge in the Lone
Hand and Madame Berry has been stacked, the Lone Hand is stacking it.
1036. The Lone Hand does not deliver Avater clear enough for stock? —No. I could not say that I
know of any case Avhere such has been done; it would require great watchfulness and very great care ;
there is A r ery great difficulty in stacking it ; if an outlet can he obtained it is much the best plan, hence I
am rather inclined to favour the proposal of letting it run into the creek for the time being.


1037. But the people down below take the other point of view? —Yes; but if they can he supplied
for the time being with fresh water, the time will come when the water in the creek will be clear again ;
that is my opinion.
The vntness withdrew.
Adjourned.

THURSDAY, 14tii OCTOBER, 1886.
Present:
R. H. Shakespear, Esq., C.E., in the Chair;
A. F. Walker, Esq., | R. Gf. Ford, Esq.
John Champion sworn and examined.
1038. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—Mining manager.
1039. For what period have you been so engaged ? —I have been at it since I was about 25. I have
followed it 30 years.
1040. Where are you residing ?—I am residing at present at the Hepburn Estate.
1041. What is the name of the company ?—The Hepburn Estate Leasehold.
1042. How long have you been mining for the company ?—About four months, as well as I
remember.
1043. Can you tell us how long it is since the company have commenced to wash ?—lt will he about
six months.
1044. And the depth of the wash below the surface ?—About 382 feet, I think, as well as
I remember. The shaft was sunk before I went there, so I am not very well posted up in all those little
things.
1045. Do you know the level of the surface above the sea?—l do not know. You can get that
from Mr. Allen. I think I can give it to you from the plan. The “ Lone Hand*’ is the datum, if you have
their levels, We are 196 feet below the Lone Hand.
1046. The Lone Hand being 1,596, you are somewhere about 1,400 feet above the sea?—Yes.
1047. What is the average width and depth of the wash ?—lt is an unlimited width. We have proved
it to about 1,000 feet wide, and how much wider I cannot tell you. We have never seen the reef.
1048. What is the average depth of the wash ? —The usual depth of the Kingston mines, two feet
or a little over.
1049. What depth are you taking out ?—At present the whole height of the drive, but when we are
blocking out about a foot or a foot and a half of the wash. Most of the gold is in a foot and a half
of the wash. That is the usual system of mining in the Kingston district.
1050. Would you describe generally your system of working ? —We are driving the bottom drive
for a deep bore. We have proved ground in one of the bores there, 1,000 feet S.E. of the shaft, to be 421
feet. We are at that level, which is the bottom, of course. The intermediate level is 60 feet above that,
that is going in a northern direction. That is where we are getting the gold.
1051. We want to go more into the general mode of working than the particular modes ?—ln the
intermediate, we put up rises or jump-ups, and drove across the wash, east and west, and north and south.
1052. What is the length of the main drive along the lead ?—About 300 feet.
1053. And what is that below the surface ? —About 340 feet.
1054. With a fall towards the shaft ?—No, the fall is in a northern direction. The waslidirt work-
ings at present are 22 feet deeper than where the shaft bottomed, showing a dip of 22 feet in 300 to the
north.
1055. How many puddling machines have you at work ?—Four.
1056. Is that the full number you will have, or do you intend to increase ? —No, we shall not increase,
I think. You can do any quantity of work with four machines.
1057. What quantity of the stuff do you put through in the 24 hours ?—About 300 trucks.
1058. Can you give us the proportion of the slum to the tailings in bulk ?—About half and half.
1059. Do you store the slum and tailings ?—Yes.
1060. What method do you adopt in the storing ?—We have a natural lagoon upon the surface.
1061. Which Avill take the whole quantity ?—lt will take the whole quantity.
1062. How does that lagoon empty itself of storm water ?—I walked round it last night, and I cannot
find an outlet. If ever it has overflowed it has not done so for some years. I cannot in the least trace the
water having run for some years. The land has been all cultivated and ploughed, and it is all standing
intact.
1063. Therefore the slum will be absolutely conserved upon this lagoon ?—Yes.
1064. Have you had any experience in stacking slum where you had not got a natural lagoon like
this ?—Yes.
1065. What course have you adopted ?—We have made dams in the first place, and kept stacking
the sludge with sludge as we went on.
1066. Kept on raising the dam ?—Kept on raising the dam.
1067. What depth of water have you found it necessary to retain in the dam to enable the sludge to
settle?—That all depends upon the size of the dam. The larger the dam the less Avatcr answers the
purpose.


10G8. Would you require a foot or two feet or eighteen inches ?—I think, if you have a foot of
water it is quite sufficient.
1069. Did you then re-use the water, or run it off, after it passed over the sludge dam ?—I have
never been where the water has been returned.
1070. You have run it off ?—Yes.
1071. What condition was it in when after running off?—lt was dirty, hut there was no heavy
sand in it, or anything of that kind.
1072. Was it discoloured? —It was not perfectly clear, but it would not do any harm, I think.
1073. What was your object in storing the sludge in that case?—For the reason that if we did not
store it, it would fill up the races with sand below.
1074. Was it because of action taken, or conditions enforced, by the landowners ?~Partly that, and
partly our own benefit.
1075. It was to your own benefit?—ln certain places I have been in, it was. In other places, it
would have been better for us to run it all away. But in some places where there were landowners we
did not want to get into trouble, and we found it better to stack it.
1070. Did you find stacking add much to the cost of working ?—ln some places it cost a little, but
not much. It all. depends on your position.
1077. Are you speaking of mines in this district ? —Yes.
1078. What amount of labour in an ordinary fair-sized sludge dam does it require to keep topping
up the banks ?—About two men in each shift—say about los. a day. They could do a great deal of work.
1079. Two men, constantly employed in the year?—l had two men constantly in the Lone Hand
No. 2 shaft since I started.
1080. Are you managing that ?—I was manager there from the commencement till I went from
there to the estate.
.. . 1081. Do you employ two men to top that bank?—Yes, the whole time.
1082. Do you consider that the water running out of the Lone Hand No. 2 is what you have
described just now as dirty ?—lt is dirty.
1083. But not containing very heavy stuff ? —Very little sand goes away, indeed.
1084. Have not you succeeded in sending the water out of your sludge dams in a purer condition
than what is coming from the Lone Hand No. 2 ?—Of course, if we had additional dams, we could still
catch it and make it more pure. Of course that would be additional expense.
1085. As a matter of fact, there is scarcely any settlement in the Lone Hand No. 2, is there ?
There are large dams; there are large embankments, 20 feet high, I should say.
1086. But the water runs away on the top and gets away without much settlement? —It does not
settle a great deal.
1087. But there you do not have a foot, in fact not six indies of water?—We have not any water
at all, we just leave it to settle the heavy sand and most of the slum, and the water runs away; we have
no sheet of water.
1088. Then the case of the Lone Hand does not exemplify what you mean by conserving and
stacking sludge ?—No, we could make a great improvement upon that by having additional dams.
1089. Then, in the case of the Lone Hand, what would have been the difficulty in forming other
dams ? —Tt would put us to twice the expense at least if we had to do that ; instead of that we arranged
with Mr. Davies, a landed proprietor; we give him a certain sum of money for the right to run the sludge
there after settling it in the stack.
1090. What is the rate at which the sludge in the Lone Hand dam rises by the settlement of the
sludge ?—lt is not a great area, it all depends upon the area; it is a small place upon the top of the hill that
I use, confined, extremely so; a small place upon the top of the hill.
1091. You say you have two men constantly there ?—They have to be constantly watching it; it
would make a frightful mess if it broke away, spoiling the land.
1092. Then that labour was not merely topping the bank, but diverting the stream over the dam?—
Yes.
1093. The topping of the bank merely to keep it above the level of the sludge, what labour Avould
that take, independent of diverting the water inside ? —You would do the both things at the same time; it
would entirely silt up if you leave it to run any way it liked.
1094. We are told that in some cases one man is sufficient to top the bank—do you consider that an
under estimate ?—Where lamin a large place, one man one day a week could do it; but in a small place
one man can scarcely attend to it.
1095. When you speak of the cost that there would have been in such a mine as the Lone Hand,
the cost of constructing another sludge dam, what do you put as the cost of the land you would have to pay
for, extra land ? —We had to pay £lO an acre for all land we destroyed.
109(5. Then there is the cost of actually constructing the dam ? —Just so.
1097. At present you are constructing an outer dam, what we may call a safety dam, on the Hepburn
Estate, of your headings, are you not?—Yes.
1098. Is it costly to run your headings round ?—No, it will cost very little more than it would if
we threw up common earthworks; I think it will not be so much, but it will be a better job, and it is
stronger also, and will l-esist more than earth would.
1099. Would it have increased the expense much at the Lone Hand to have run headings round,
and formed a second outer dam ?—Yes, that would be a great expense.
1100. Could you give any idea of what you consider the expense of making another sludge dam of
the same size as that at present at the Lone Hand ? —There is an embankment of earth there; I have not
measured it, but I think it would be from -10 to 19 feet high; it AAsould go into a lot of money to construct a
thing like it, but Avhen the men are employed it is constructed day by day, and if you were to construct
another dam it Avould be upon the same principle, it Avould not bo doue all at once.
1101. That is what I mean —would the construction of a second dam have affected materially the
net profits ?—Another man would have been able to attend to that.
1102. That is, by the labour of another mm, and £lO an acre for the land, you could have obtained
another sludge dam at the Loue Hand ? —Yes.


, 1103. Tlicn the effect of that would have been to materally improve the character of the water
passing out?—lt would improve it, but there is always a certain amount of stuff going away; it is so light
and bouyant, it is almost impossible to catch the whole of it.
1104. What goes away now from the mine is very thick ? —I dare say it is now; we having made
arrangements with Mr. Davies, but it was not so before we made the arrangements.
1105. I understand that mine is not likely to continue at work for any length of time ?—No, it is
not.
110 G. Consequently you are not so careful about the sludge arrangements as you were at first ?
No, I believe three-fourths of it was deposited there in eight or nine months.
1107. Do you know what quantity of water is raised by the Hepburn Estate mine ?—From a
million to two million gallons per week; very little, so far, for such pumping machinery as we have got.
1108. What do you do with the whole of that water?—Pass it into the lagoon.
1109. In the case of the Lone Hand, what quantity of water were you raising ?—I suppose about
four millions per week.
1110. Do you require the whole of that water for washing ?—No.
1111. And what do you do with the balance ? —You speak of the Lone Hand ?
1112. Yes ?—That ran in this direction.
1113. Does it run through the sludge dam?—No, it was conducted a mile fram the Lone Hand right
here to Allendale; the people were very glad to have it ; it kept all the drains nice and clean.
1114. That was independent of the sludge dam?—lndependent of the sludge dam.
1115. Is that mine water brackish or sweet ?—I do not think it is bad water. I notice the cattle are
very fond of it; they would sooner drink it than any other water —it is very clear.
1116. You said before, “in consequence of some arrangements being made”—was any complaint
made of the method of working in the Lone Hand ?—We never had any complaint more than from
Mr, Davies, in Creswick, at the Bridge Hotel; of course all the companies were depositing sludge in the
creek at the time, and we had all the companies to give him something to keep him quiet, to get the right
to run sludge there.
1117. You got over the difficulty of buying further rights-?—Yes.
1118. But not by removing the water or purifying the water ?—No.
The witness withdrew.
Robert Miller Smyth sworn and examined.
1119. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—Mining manager.
1120. What is the name of the mine?—Berry No. 1.
1121. How long have you been manager ?—Six months.
1122. Have you got down to the wash ? —Yes.
1123. What depth is it below the surface ? —Wo have two distinct lines of ground; the one is 470
feet, and the other 450 feet.
1124. I have no levels of Berry No. 1 here; you are giving us now the level beloAv the surface ?
Yes, from the surface whim of our shaft; I can give you the sea-levels from Mr. Allen’s largo plan, and from
that I can give you the levels before you leave.
1125. What is the average width and depth of the wash ? —I have never been driving in the wash,
but from the bores that we put through, the depth of the strong wash seems to be about 5 feet; the eastern
bottom of which is about 450 feet deep is 350 feet wide; the western ground we have no knowledge of its
width.
1126. Have you commenced washing yet?—No.
1127. What number of puddling machines do you propose to use ?—Probably three; w r e have two
erected.
1128. What quantity of water are you raising at the present time ?—About from 25,000 to 30,000
gallons an hour.
1129. Is that decreasing ?—lt is likely to increase, perhaps to be doubled, or even trebled.
1130. What quantity of water do you anticipate having to use for washing ? —That will all depend
upon the number of men employed.
1131. You do not propose to use the whole body of water you are raising ?—No, nothing near it.
1132. What will you do with the body of water that you do not want for washing ?—We have
dams erected there, and, of course, it flows awa} r down into the creek.
1133. You propose to run straight into the creek such of your mine water as you do not require for
washing ?—Yes.
1134. What condition is that water in—is it brackish?—A little brackish. It will never be entirely
clear, but at the present time it is clearer than the creek water.
1135. Do you propose to adopt any method to stack the sludge ?—Yes, we will have to do so.
1136. Upon what grounds do you say you will have to do so ?—Because we are not allowed to run
it into the creek.
1137. That is by direction of the Water Commission ?—Yes, the easement from our mine is
directly into the creek for everything.
1138. You must deliver into the creek; you have no other delivery?—No other delivery at present,
the overflow of water, what we do not want for washing.
113!). Will the delivery into the creek be below or above weir? —Below the weir.
1140. In what way then does the Water Commission affect you, if it is below the weir?—Not in
any way. It is only the residents that live below the weir.
1141. To meet their objection, you propose to store the sludge ?—Yes.
1142. What method will you adopt in storing the sludge?—The method that I have adopted in
years gone by was to get as large a settling area as I could —say ten acres.
1143. Are you now speaking of a mine of which you were manager ?—Yes, at the New Buninyong,
We were surrounded with private property there, and we had to stack the sludge,


1144. "Were you successful m doing so?—Yes. We only had to pay £lO to pacify one man, who
supposed he was damaged; that was all ever we paid.
1145. Were the other agriculturalists lower down perfectly satisfied ?—Perfectly satisfied.
1146. And made no complaint?—And made no complaint.
1147. You had ten acres of a dam?—Yes.
1148. And ran all your sludge into the dam?—Yes.
1149. Did the sludge settle ?—Yes, to a great extent, very little settlement ran away. We would
have a large area of all the dams at the commencement, but raised them with the sludge, and in winter it
cost two men, and in summer one used to do.
1150. On the average a man and a half all the year round ?—Yes, I calculated it at £350 a year for
labour.
1151. You mean a man and a half per shift? —Yes, but they always arranged their work so as not
to have anything to do in the night. At the commencement, probably the cost would not exceed a man
and a half, but I think after we get the banks up high, in large Avorks like that you could not reckon the
cost to be less than £3OO a year.
1152. lloav do you make that to fit Avith a man and a half? —Yes, but I am afraid it Avould take
more as the banks got higher.
1153. And you ran on from one dam into another dam ?—Yes.
1154. Did you run into more than tAVO ?—Sometimes half a dozen.
1155. Progressive settlement?—Progressive settlement.
1156. And at the end of that, the result was that the Avater came out fit for stock, did it ?—Yes,
I dare say it Avould be pretty avcll fit for stock ; but there Avere a good many small farmers down beloAV,
and they used to use all the water avc sent down, and they Avere glad to get it in the summer. They
each and all Avauted it in the summer, but AA r e could not give it to all.
1157. Were you pumping Avater much out of the mine at the time ?—Yes.
1158. Did you pas on your water through the sludge dam ? —No, the overfloAv of Avater went another
way, and got mixed with the Avater from the sludge.
1159. The overflow Avent into the creek by another channel and mixed Avith the sludge in the
creek ? —Yes, and they were glad to get it, it did no harm to anything.
1160. In the present instance of the Berry No. 1, do you propose to construct a sludge dam, and
Avliat do you propose to do it Avith. Will you take your headings and construct a dam Avith the headings,
or Avi 11 you excavate upon the natural surface ? — I Avill excavate it in a narroAV channel, so that it Avill be
lifted with the shovel, and not to have any barrow Avork; that makes it cheap. I Avould have a large area
of ten acres., and excavate it in compartments.
1161. Would it be any cheaper to run your headings round and form a dam Avith your headings ?
No, it Avould not be as cheap.
11G2. Will you propose in the case of the Berry No. 1 to have more than one sludge dam ?—Yes.
1163. Would you adopt the same system as you did at Buninyong—a series of ponds?—Yes, the
dams are cheaply made. You must keep a man there to look after the sludge, and he Avill keep making the
dams all the time he is at work.
1164. Will you have to pay for the land ?—Yes, £7 10s. an acre.
1105. You lcnoAv the Avater—have you seen the water being delivered out of the Madame Berry, or
out of the Lone Hand ? —From the sludge?
1106. From the sludge ?—Yes.
1167. Will you deliver it clearer tliau that?—We shall have to deliver it clearer than the Lone
Hand does at present.
1168. You do not consider that as clear as sludge can be ?—Not nearly so clear as sludge can be
made, not nearly so pure as they used to make it before they made the arrangements Mr. Champion spoke
of with Mr. Davies.
1109. What is your idea of the quantity of stuff you expect to put through your four puddling
machines in 24 hours ?—ln full work Ave would raise 300 loads a day.
1170. What is the usual proportion of sludge to tailings ?—lt usually'runs about half. We throw
a good deal of the gravel aAvay beloAV when we get into a proper system of blocking, and about as much
gravel as reef comes up.
1171. What depth of water do you propose to hold in your first large settling dam ? —Only a feAV
inches.
1172. Will that be the case all through? —Yes; you do not Avant to hold much Avater there, Avlien
you are settling sludge as little as possible; in fact, it runs into one you see, and tlieu ho takes a little off
the side, and so into another, and so on till it reduces to a very little left, if properly cared for, and I suppose
in this instance we shall have to do so.
The witness withdrew.
Benjamin Bryant sworn and examined.
1173. By the Board. —What is your residence ?—Lord Harry.
1174. What, is your occupation ?—Mining manager.
1175. Of Avliat company ?—The Lord Harry Company.
1176. What is the time during Avhich you have been manager of the Lord Harry?—About three
months.
1177. Is the Lord Harry in waslulirt at present ? —Not at present. We are pumping.
1178. You are not down to the Avashdirt ? —Yes, but avo are swamped.
1179. What is the level of that waslulirt above the level of-tlie sea, or the depth beloAV the surface ?
—The depth beloAV the surface is about 600 feet; but the shaft is upon a hill 120 or 130 feet up a hill.
1180. I have got “ Surface frame of shaft, 1,596 feet”; lioav much is your shaft beloAV that ?—Six
hundred and tAventy feet, and the washdirt is about COO feet.
1181. What is the depth of the Avashdirt ?—The height, lam not in a position to say that. About
two or three feet, I think.


1182. How many puddling machines have you ?—Two.
1188. Do you propose to add. to them —do you imagine they will add to them ?—That will depend
upon circumstances.
1184. What quantity of stuff were you putting through when you were at work, or would you be
if you were at ivork iioav ? —That ivould depend upon circumstances. I cannot say.
118f>. Are you raising much water ?—About 6,000,000 gallons a Aveek.
1186. Is that of good quality—is it sweet or brackish ?—lt has been analysed and pronounced the
best in the district, good for domestic purposes.
1187. Where is that Avater at present delivered ? — lnto a branch creek below the Aveir.
1188. Have you ivashed ?—Yes.
1189. And to what extent —did you do much Avork ?—Not much. Not many machines.
1190. What did you do Avith the slum Avhen you Avere at Avork ?—The company constructed fluming
from the claim to carry it into the Lone Hand, I believe, and the Madame Berry. They made arrangements
Avith Mr. Davis like the other companies.
1191. To carry it into Hollinwood Creek ?—I think so.
1192. Why was it that you constructed the fluming — Avas it on the ground of any action taken by
landoAvners ? —No, I think not; not that I knoAV of. lam not sure of it.
1193. Could you have stacked the sludge Avhere you are at Avork ? —lt could be done, but not very
Avell, being in the side of the hill, and the fluming Avill take it all away; but if the fluming should fail, then
we Avould have to stack the sludge.
1194. Have you had any experience in stacking sludge ? —No.
1195. Can you tell me Avhat the proportion of slum, in Avliat you have Avorked, has been to the
tailings ? —About half, lam told from the inquiries I liaA r e made.
1196. Do you deliver your sludge direct as it is, Avitliout any settlement at all into the flumes?—No,
there are two small settling dams.
1197. And Avhat is the object of those; is it in order to render the Avater thin enough to run ?—Yes.
1198. It is for that object ? —For that object, so that the fluming shall carry away the other part.
1199. Is there sufficient area in the lease for the construction of sludge dams?—Yes.
1200. Have you seen any successful method of stacking sludge in any other claims? —To render the
water perfectly clear ?
1201. Of course it must remain discoloured; but to render it fit for stock ?—No, I cannot say that I
have.
1202. Hoav long has that claim been at Avork ?—Four or five years; frve years, I think.
1203. And out of that time, lioav long Avere you engaged in actually washing?—Only a foAv months,
I think.
1204. Hoav do you discharge the Avater into Birch’s Creek from the mine ?—Open gutter or drain
all the Avay along.
1205. Have you an adit?—Yes.
1206. What level is that adit at below the surface?—One hundred and tAvelve feet.
1207. You only pump the Avater up to this adit ?—That is all.
1208. Do you know the area of the lease ?—No, Ido not; it is a large area I knoAV. I knoAV from
the plan of the whole that it is larger that most of them.
The witness withdrew.
William Manners sworn and examined.
1209. By the Board. —What is your residence and occupation ?—My personal residence is upon the
claim, Smeaton Reserve Company.
1210. And occupation ? —Mining manager.
1211. Of the Smeaton Reserve ? —Yes, the Smeaton Reserve United Company.
1212. Hoav long have you been manager of that company ?—About four months and a half.
1213. Is the company at Avork?—Yes.
1214. Have they reached the Avash ? —No.
1215. Are they still sinking? —We are not even sinking. We have too much Avater to sink ; we
are pumping.
1216. What quantity of water are you raising at present ?—A little over 50,000 gallons an hour ; a
little over 8,000,000 a Aveek.
1217. Is the water on the increase, or the decrease ?—lt has been increasing ; it increased a fort-
night ago, and it is continuing something like the same strength up to the present.
1218. At Avhat level does the water come in ?—The water comes in at a level of about 212 feet from
the surface Avhere the shaft is situated, or about 130 feet beloAv the creek. The creek is running past our
claim, Avithin 500 or 600 feet, Birch’s Creek.
1219. We have got here the surface level at Anderson’s office door-step, that is near the claim ?
That is a few feet above the level of the creek ; Anderson’s office door-step may be about seven or eight
feet above the level of the creek.
1220. It is far beloAv the level of yonr surface frame ?—lt is 75 feet at least beloAv the level of our
surface.
1221. Hoav deep is your shaft at present?—About 212 feet.
1222. Have you any reason to knoAV the depth at Avliich you expect to meet the Avash ? —Yes.
1223. What would it be ? —Although it is someAvhat uncertain, the bore is near the creek, about
600 or 700 feet from the shaft; and the bore bottomed at 299 feet.
1224. Two hundred and ninety-nine feet beloAv Avhat ? — The surface of the bore, and that bore is 84
feet beloAv the level of the surface frame of the shaft.
1225. That is 383 feet beloAv the surface frame of the shaft ?—That is right. We think that the
bore indicates pretty Avell the deep ground, inasmuch as there is 4 or 5 feet of Avash proved in that bore,
and very heavy boulders.
1226. Heavy Avash for 5 feet in depth?—Yes.


1227. What method do yon propose to adopt. in the disposal of the slum ?—The only method that
we can possibly adopt will be to make the surface dams, and settle the sludge in those dams as much as
possible.
1228. Would you make one or more dams ? —Our area is rather confined, unless, of course, we might
be able to purchase property alongside. Our claim consists of what is called the Smeaton Reserve; and the
Smeaton Reserve, I am not very certain, but I do not think it is 20 acres, and the two-thirds of that is taken
up by people having bits of laud, and a show-yard, and there is very little available ground, at all events,
for making dams; although I believe we have a prior right to a considerable space of ground.
1229. If it is possible will you make more than one dam ? —I should think so. Ido not see
1230. Do you prefer the system of conserving in a succession of dams ?—I do not think you could
possibly clear the sludge sufficiently well to let it go down into the creek with one dam alone.
1231. Do you think, with a succession of dams, you would be able to let it go down the creek suffi-
ciently clear as far as farmers are concerned ?—I believe it would do them no injury whatever.
1232. It would be good enough for stock ?—lt would be good enough for stock.
1233. At the present time, where is your main water running ?—lnto Birch’s Creek.
1234. What is the quality of the water ? —You can just taste it a little hrackisli. It is just the
slightest tinge, and it is a little hard.
1235. Has any objection been raised to your running the water in ?—None whatever, so long as it is
as clear as it is. It is a very clear pure water, but a little hard.
1236. Have you had any notice or intimation given to you that you will have any objection raised
to your running in water that has been settled in sludge-dams ? —No. I suppose it is a little premature to
give any intimation of that kind. Our chance of getting sludgy water is so remote at present.
1237. You intend to adopt the very best method you can to stack the sludge, and deliver the water
as clear as you possibly can ?—We intend to do it, because we knoAv w.e must be prepared for it.
1238. If, in spite of all your precautions, you cannot clear the water sufficiently to meet objections
raised by the Water Commissioners, what course would you adopt then ? —I do not know, unless we could
find a way to come away down here towards Allendale, past the roads. I do not know that we can. Of
course they have not the levels of the district.
1239. Would you have any means of delivering the water below the weir of the water commission?
—I do not think we, as a company, could go to the expense to carry a drain or fluming down so far as the
Beaconsfield claim, which is the nearest to us.
1240. You would have to construct any work? —Yes, the Beaconsfield and the Lord Harry are just
in a line with us.
1241. You Avould have to construct any work of that kind yourself? —Yes, I think so, and I do not
think they would do that.
1242. Are there any companies in progress or formed above you on the Birch’s Creek ?—I believe
mining claims have been taken up, but none have made a start. I think the ground all the way between
us and Hepburn Rocky Lead is applied for.
1243. Has that question ever been raised to your knowledge, or in your presence, as to what would
be done by such companies as to getting rid of their water ?—No, it has never been brought up in my pre-
sence by any one. I have simply heard a rumour to the effect that the Government had authorized a survey
for a sludge channel to come up through those claims, the Berry Consuls and the Beaconsfield.
1244. You mean somewhat upon the lines of Mr. Gore’s and Mr, Allen’s survey. I think so, and
I think it was only surveyed as far as Beaconsfield. I got up pretty early this morning, and took a look
down. I never paid much attention to it, because, as I said before, it would be a considerable time before
we are troubled with any one complaining to us; but I took a walk down as far as the Beaconsfield nearly,
to see the lie of the country in reference to such a thing as a race. Of course, it is practicable to carry a
race upon the surface, but not by the road; we would have to secure the right to let the race go through a
a corner of the Seven Hills Estate, and then it would have to cross the road, and into Mr. Anderson’s
paddock, and before it would reach the Beaconsfield there would be a quarter of a mile at least of very high
fluming —I should think at least 20 to 30 feet high for nearly a quarter of a mile —to catch the level of the
hill that lies between us and the Beaconsfield to where this race has been surveyed up. It would be a very
expensive matter.
1245. Have you had any experience on claims where you have endeavoured to stack sludge ? —I
never happened to be mixed up with a company where we were compelled to stack our sludge; we always
had some means of conveying it away without trouble.
1246. In making these sludge dams, do you propose to use your headings to run round as the
formation of the dam ? —No.
1247. Do you consider that that would be a costly method ?—Yes ; you see our headings are generally
taken away from a height of 50 feet from the brace, and we would have to raise a tramway all round this
circle.
1248. As a matter of fact, your area being so restricted, your sludge dam would have to be very
high ?—lt would ; I do not know that it would require to be so very high ; the only way I can see for our
sludge to go from our claim, when such a thing is required, will be to make, perhaps, two or three little
sludge dams, not very large, and let it drain away down a blind creek that is in the locality.
1249. That is not delivering into Birch’s ?—That is not delivering into Birch’s, but the blind creek
does deliver into Birch’s.
1250. Below the weir?—Above the weir, 1 believe. Of course, it is impossible for me to say, at
the present time, what plan of operations the company may adopt; we have never really given the matter
very much consideration, but just for the sake of being able to give some evidence here, I went over the
ground this morning to see it. . „ '
1251. How many mines are pumping upon the same lead upon which you are situated ?—There is
no mine pumping upon the lead that we are on, that I am aware of, except the Hepburn Rocky Lead.
1252. That is several miles above you ? —I think tlio Hepburn Rocky Lead is near the head of it,
and we are near the bottom of it. It must run down and join with the main lead coming from the Madame
Berry and the Lone Hand. We are on the main lead that is coming through the country from the Rocky
Lead, and it will fall into the main flat, where the Ilephurn Estate and the Berry Consols are. There is
Sludge. f


no one of those claims ever had anything like a fourth, or a tenth, of the water that we have had in the
rock when they were sinking their shaft; none of them seem to have touched the belt of rock containing
this water.
The vntness withdrew.
William Maughan sworn aud examined.
1253. By the Board. —Whore is your residence ?—The Madame Berry claim, Allendale.
1254. What is your occupation ?—Mining manager.
1255. And the name of the company?—The Madame Berry Gold Mining Company.
1256. How long have you been in the position of manager ?—Twenty-five years.
1257. Twenty-five years as mining manager ?—Yes.
1258. How long in the Madame Berry ? —Six years and two months,
1259. Your company is in full work ?—Yes.
12G0. How long has it been actually washing?—Five years gone the 17th of February last.
1261. And what is the length of your claim along the lead?—Our claim is a mile square.
1262. Can you give me the depth of +1 ‘ wash below the surface at the upper end, that is at your
shaft ?—Four hundred and sixty-nino feet.
1263. That is below the surface ?—Below the surface.
1264. What depth of wash have you on the average, and what is the average width?—lt varies
considerably, but we only take it from eighteen inches to two feet.
1265. That is in blocking out ?—Yes. The other is all thrown back.
1266. What number of puddling machines are you employing ?—Three.
126 . That is your full number ?—That is our full number.
126 . You do not contemplate an increase? —Not the slightest.
1269. What quantity of stuff do you put through in 24 hours, or a week ?—I never kept any tally
till you gentlemen spoke to me, when you were up before, and we kept count for a certain time, and, as far
as I can judge, about 300 yards pass through the three in the 24 hours.
1270. What quantity of water do you raise per 24 hours ?—The quantity it requires to puddle—that
is about 96,000 gallons.
1271. What quantity do you work?—That is the quantity at this date, and any extra water for
feeding the boilers is got from No. 2 ; at present we have 40,000 to 50,000 gallons in the 24 hours more
than we had when you were here before.
1272. Are you using all your water ?—- We are, but instead of using it all over and over again, as we
were when you were here before, it all goes away.
1273. All you get is used in washing?—Yes, it is just about sufficient.
1274. What proportion of slum have you to your tailings ?—As near as I can calculate, about two
thirds; of course I cannot be accurate, but that is about as near the proportion as is possible to give.
1275. Do you adopt any method for storing the tailings, not the slum?—There is no storing about
them; we are obliged to truck them away the last three years.
1276. For storing the slum—do you store it?—To a certain extent we are obliged, for the race is
about two miles and a half in length, and the level is so dead that it will not run; we are obliged to store.
1277. What system have you to store it ? —We have twm dams.
1278. What depth of water do you keep in your dam?—l do not think there is more than a foot at
the front, but it is very seldom there is any water kept in it at all, for the simple reason that, up to lately,
this water and sludge has all been running into the creek, and it has been the main outlet for sludge ever
since the diggings opened.
1279. That is the Hollinwood Creek?—The Hollimvood Creek, and we only store it sufficiently to
get it away that way.
1280. It is more strictly Glen Donald Creek ? —I do not know what they call it exactly. Our two
sludge dams cover in area about fourteen acres. In summer time, no sludge goes away at all, it stacks itself,
there is not sufficient water to take it away, but in winter time a little more does go away.
1281. Would a sub-division of your dams, instead of being two large dams covering fourteen acres,
would their sub-division into a larger number, so that the water passes progressively from one dam to
another enable the sludge to be better conserved, and the water delivered clearer ?—No doubt about that;
the more dams you put in the claim, the more water goes awny, but you must take into consideration the
expense of doing all this.
1282. What amount of labour is required in your case at present to keep the dams topped up? —
Their expense is about £ll5 and £l2O a year; but it is principally keeping the dam clear for the water to
go. When the sludge dam wants raising we put on a few men, and do it at once.
1283. That, upon the average, costs £l5O a year ?—£lls to £l2O.
1284. Has auy complaint been made to you about the quantity and character of the sludge being
passed away ?—Five years ago, next month, there was an injunction put upon the Madame Berry for
running sludge and dirty water directly down north-west. Of course, the case went into court, and we
beat the party; but, in the meantime, we took levels to see if we could run it to where all the other claims
ran theirs down, and we found sufficient level to run the water, and we paid parties for leave to cut the
races through their property; and since that there has been no complaint till two months ago, we got a
lawyer’s letter from a farmer named McLeod, and we answered that it was a mistake, that it was not the
Madame Berry sludge that was injuring the property, aud they have acknowledge that it was not, it is the
Australasian sludge—that is the only complaint.
1285. Where is the land situated whose owner complained ?—Somewhere down by Hollinwood.
1286. Have you ever, in your position as mining manager of other claims, adopted means to store
sludge ? —Not the slightest, it is a thing we never heard of.
1287. Simply let it all go away ?—Everything used to run down the main creeks.
1288. What do you suppose would be the cost —supposing yon had further sludge dams, what would
be the extra cost entailed upon you ?—I can form no idea, not the slightest; in fact, two-thirds of the


companies in the district have not got places where they can store it. The Madame Berry No. 1 has the
best facilities I know of.
1289. Why should you consider that Madame Berry No. 1 has the best facilities for stacking sludge ?
—For the simple reason that the ground is so level; there are very poor facilities where the ground pitches
perhaps fifteen or twenty feet to the hundred. Our No. 2, we made a dam there, and it cost £3lO before
we began to wash, aud I do not think it will last us more than twelve to fourteen months when we get into
full working order, because it only covers an area of about three acres.
1290. You say that during the summer time the sludge remains in the dam ? —Yes, it spreads over
all the area; there is little or no water to take it away.
1291. You are not passing water at that time ?—No, not moro than comes with the sludge.
1292. You find, I suppose, that when the water is not in motion the sludgo settles quickly—is that
what I am to understand by your saying that there is not water enough to carry it away ?—Yes; in
summer time, the area being fourteen acres it spreads over, and by the time it gets to the bottom it is
nearly dry.
1293. Evaporation, does it ?—Yes. In winter time, of course, there is more water, and more goes
away; and, as I tell you now, we have got more water. What we used to conserve before for sluicing
purposes is all running away.
1294. Do you consider that you could not upon your works stack the sludge so as to render it clearer
than it is; it is very thick as it goes away at present ?—I am well aware that at No. Iwe can do so; but
we were not aware we were doing any harm. We are the only party that do anything to stack sludge since
I came here. All the other claims let it run of their own accord; and no doubt, with a little expense, we
could send ours away clearer; but it will not run; it is two miles and a half of race.
1295. It is a particularly thick greasy kind of sludge ?—Yes, pipe-clay, and pipe-clay is of such a
nature that it takes a long time before it will settle. One thing is certain, you must find an outlet for the
dirty water.
The witness withdrew.
John Parkin sworn and examined.
1296. By the Board. —Where is your residence ?—Kingston.
1297. And what is your occupation ?—Farming and mining.
1298. How long have you been occupied in farming in the district ?—I think twenty years; at any
rate, it is moro than that.
1299. Do yon, from personal observation, know of any land in the district injured by sludge ?—No,
I do not think I do; it is a big question, and I have not had time to think of it, but I do not think I do.
1300. Whereabout is your land situated ?—Just east of Kingston.
1301. How would that be with regard to the mines—can you show us it upon the plans ?—[ The
witness pointed out the same~\ —You understand.that there are no mines working at the present time there.
Some sixteen years since, east of where I am living there was a bore put down, which I had a big interest
in, and since the Clunes Water Commission came in it prevented the mine from ever being worked though
there was a good prospect of gold.
1302. When you say you are not aware of land so injured in this district —Avhat do you include in
the term “ district” ?—I include the whole neighbourhood where the mines are working. You understand
there is some I would not say damage done for everthing is paid for at per acre of land, the creeks are as
pure as ever they have been as yet.
1303. You are not aware, at any rate, of anything ?—I am not.
1304. Have you given any consideration to this sludge question ?—A very great deal.
1305. Would you give us the benefit of the results of your thought upon the matter? —Yes ; when
the mines began between hero and Clunes, I was the first person to go down there to make arrangements to
,'et the sludge go into the creek, there was no other way.
130(1. Creswiclc Creek or Deep Creek ?—Birch’s Cfeek, putting it in below the weir, and I thought
a little arcangement could be made, that it was a matter of a little money they were wanting; we could
supply them with clear water, but Ave could not possibly keep sludge out of the creek, and at the same
time work the mines.
1307. You have not then entered into the question of lioav to keep the sludge from Birch’s Creek ?
—I do not think it is possible to be done, except by stacking the principal part of it, but the muddy water
must go away. There has been a scheme laid doAvn, as you are aware, taking the sludge and Avater away
down the Smeaton Plains, I hardly knoAV Avhere it empties.
1308. That is the proposition of Mr. Gore’s ?—Yes, but really Avhen that is done, it does not mend
the thing at all; it is only a matter, as far as I see, betAveen the and Chines at the present time.
If you Avant to carry on mining, you cannot keep the muddy water out of the creek; but you can stack a lot
of sludge.
1309. Do you think that the Avater that Avould be delivered into the creek from the mines, if they
attempted to stack the heavy sludge, Avould be injurious to stock ?—That is a very hard thing for me to say;
I would not think it Avould.
1310. You Avould not be afraid of it for your oavii slock ?—No, I AA r ould not.
1311. That is, provided they take care to stack the sludge ? —Yes.
1312. Have vou seen the sludge that is delivered from the Madame Berry and the Lone Hand ?
Yes.
1313. Do you consider that that Avould be injurious to stock, Avhen it gets into the Glen Donald
Creek ? —I can only ans Aver from Avhat I have seen previous, Avhen the Kocky Lead was working the creek
in summer time, the Clunes Water Reserve was not made at the time, aud no person ever found fault Avitli
the creek at that time, it just moA r ed, and I think I could have Avritten my name upon it.
1314. Was that Birch’s Creek ?—That Avas Birch’s Creek, and that creek does not look as if there
was any sediment settled there at all iioav. We have had big floods since that though.
1315. Then the floods have washed the sediment down from there and cleared the creek ?—The creek
is as clear as ever it was. I kneAv it before, and I kneAv it after.


1316. How many years is it since tlie Rocky Lead was working?—lt must be something near
twenty years.
1317. The Rocky Lead is working now, is it not ?—No, not the Rocky Lead, not that very place,
hut a continuation is working now Avhicli has been left for a considerable time.
1318. That is discharging into Birch’s Creek now, is it ?—There is no other place.
1319. Have you been there recently. Can you speak from your own knowledge—l mean of what
they are doing now ?—Yes, it is not coming into Birch’s Creek now; but it comes into the Hepburn Lagoon,
and that runs into Birch’s Creek.
1320. Is there a regular outlet from the lagoon into Birch’s Creek ?—Yes.
1321. Are they stacking their sludge in the Hepburn Lagoon ?—No, I do not think so.
1322. Are they running their sludge at present into Birch’s Creek ?—They have no sludge to run at
present. They are not washing.
1323. Informer days thero was some sluicing up near Rocky Lead, was not there ?—Yes.
1324. Did they deliver into Birch’s Creek ?—Yes.
1325. Are you aware whether that sludge water carried sludge down Birch’s Creek as far as this.
Did it deposit the sludge up there, or did it bring it down as far as this?—The creek was very muddy down
here.
1326. And the creek above this point has got clearer, has it ? —lt is clear now.
1327. It is clear above those mines now? —Yes.
1328. Is the Rocky Lead Company above the Water Supply Commissioners’ dam, the higher dam
above the reservoir ?—No, I do not think so.
1329. They deliver below the reservoir?—Yes. They could not deliver it into the dam, you under-
stand, because of the Water Commission.
1330. They would not be allowed to? —They could not do it. Of course they could if they tried to
do it but it comes the other Avay.
1331. Naturally that does not come into the dam ?—lt does not come into the dam. It comes into
the creek, but not into the dam.
1332. Do you know lioav long it is since the Rocky Lead Avashed ?—No.
1333. Have they A\ r ashed Avithin the last feAV years ?—Yes. It may be perhaps eighteen months
since they have been washing.
1334. And then they delivered the results of their Avashing into Birch’s Creek ? —They must come
into Birch’s Creek or else into the Hepburn Lagoon.
1335. Do you know Avhether Birch’s Creek Avas particularly dirty, as if carrying sludge at that time
eighteen months ago, that is doAvn here at the lower Avoir ?—No, I cannot say it Avas any worse for what
they Avere doing. I have seen Birch’s Creek very dirty after a big fall of rain. Ido not knoAv that it is any
good at all for the ci’eek. From the red soil you may see it every day, even noAV after a fall of rain it is as
dirty a creek as ever I saw in the country.
1336. Is that the case above the Water Supply Commissioners’ dam; is the dam clear water till
you get doAvn below here ? —Yes, and always will be on account of the ploughing and the sand and the rain
fetching the red soil; and it runs away into the creek.
1337. But above the dam Ave get into a more rangy country ? —Yes and it is quite clear.
1338. Do you knoAv Avhat Avas the nature of the working upon the Rocky Lead, was it deep Avorking
or merely shalloAv ?—Both shalloAv and deep. In fact I Avas Avorking there myself. I had a steam puddling
machine there Avorking surface ground. As Avell as that, at Rocky Lead, they were Avorking in the rock. It
is a long time ago I speak of; more than 20 years since, and they had a rock shaft and a puddling machine
the same as noAV.
1339. Have you any idea Avhat number of puddling machines Avere Avorking at that time ?—I cannot
tell you.
1340. Has the creek, do you think, got clearer since that time by the mere carrying doAA r nof all this
material by flood water ?—lt is much clearer than it Avas then.
1341. You did not deliver into Hepburn’s'Lagoon ? —No.
1342. Your puddling machines delivered direct into the creek?—Yes.
1343. Have you any idea what area of ground did the AA r orkings cover, or how many men did they
employ —something to give one an idea of the size of them ?—lt is a very hard thing to say.
1344. The Avhole area of the old Avorkings ?—I suppose it was a couple of miles.
1345. A couple of miles along the lead ? —A couple of miles along the lead, and I may say that at
present you Avonld not say that there had ever been mines Avorked above to look at the creek.
1346. Is that creek a constant running creek in summer ?—Yes, as you heard me express myself
Avheu you asked me, in the summer time the creek was coming doAvn so thick that you could almost Avrite
your name upon the creek. It Avas only small, but still it Avas running.
1347. And now it has got clear again ? —Quite clear. There is one thing I may say, I think these
things could be easily got over. It is a matter with these people on the creek doAvn here. The only thing
that they are asking for is a little compensation, which I Avas the first person here to agree to give to them,
and let the thing be in the creek.
1348. But we must go a little beyond the immediate locality. The people doAvn the Deep Creek,
and doAvn the Loddon, far down, have a voice in the matter as Avell ?—I fully understand that. I think
they have a claim; but Avhat are you going to do. There are only tAVO Avays to do the thing —either stop
the mines, or let the water go into the creek, and stack as much sludge as you can —you can stack a certain
amount of sludge.

FRIDAY, 15th OCTOBER, 1886.
Present:
R. H. Shake spear, Esq., C.E., in the Chair;
A. F. Walker, Esq., [ R. G. Ford, Esq.
Albert Bucknall sworn and examined.
1349. By the Board. —Where is your residence ?—Rodborougli, near Majorca.
1350. What is your occupation ?—Grazier.
1351. How long have you been a grazier in this district ? —I was born in this district, and I have
been about twenty years grazing.
1352. Does any portion of your land suffer from debris from mining operations brought down a
creek or river ?—Yes.
1353. What creek or river does your land abut upon ?—The Tullaroop Creek.
1354. In what way does your land suffer ?—Through the overflow from the creek leaving a deposit
of sludge upon the flats.
1355. Is that overflow of the creek brought about by mining operations ?—Yes.
1356. In what way ?—Through the sludge being allowed to flow down the creek, and the floods
deposit it upon the flats.
1357. By “sludge/’ what do you define—do you mean quartz tailings and alluvial sludge?—Yes,
bo’tli. In previous years it was the quartz tailings. They filled up all the holes in the creek, but I think
not so much of that comes down now as sludge.
1358. Can you tell me to what depth have the holes in the creek upon your property been filled ?
Formerly they were from 30 to 40 feet deep, and now the whole bed of the creek is perfectly level, and is
rising every year, and upon my estate it is Avithin tAvo feet of the level of the flats.
1359. You say it is rising every year ?—Yes.
1360. Do not the Avinter rains carry down the accumulation ?—lf the Avinter rains do, it is filled up
to a greater extent the folloAving summer.
1361. NotAvitlistanding the effect of the winter rains in carrying doAvn sludge, its depth is still
increasing ?—Yes.
1362. What effect has the sludge upon vegetation?—lt killed it Avhere it is deposited —so thick in
some places that vegetation cannot get through it.
1363. Where is that ?—Just in places Avhere the eddy of the water takes place, where the backwater
is, and the water is still.
1364. Are you speaking now of flat lands upon the sides of the creek ? —Yes.
1365. When the flat lands are flooded, does it then, do you mean, kill the vegetation that is upon
those flats ?—Yes, but if it is only a thin deposit, as in some places, the A r egetation comes through again, but
in a great many places it is so thick that the vegetation cannot come through.
1366. What is the greatest depth of deposit that you have in any portion of your land?—About
three feet.
1367. Over Avhat area is your land injured ?—About 250 acres.
1368. What Avould you consider to be the average depth over that 250 acres ?—Some portion of it
has hardly any deposit upon it at all, though it has been over it, but where the Avater runs quickly it does
not leave any deposit, or hardly any.
1369. Can you give the aA'-erage depth upon the portion you say has been injured ?—An average of
six to nine inches, I should say.
1370. Over how many acres ? —Say 150 acres.
1371. When was the last time that those 150 acres Avere flooded? —I think 1870 was the last, but
a portion of this is flooded every year. Every year a flood goes over a portion of it.
1372. To what extent Avould you say?— One hundred acres, 1 should say.
1373. The effect of that constant deposit yearly is to destroy the A r egetation ?—Yes.
1374. Has the deposit any injurious effect upon the stock drinking from the creek ?—Yes, it lias;
the male sheep have to keep away from the creek all during the summer. Of course, in the winter, it does
not so much, they drink from the crab-holes, and not so much from the creek; but during summer, when they
have no other water to drink, I have to keep them away from the creek; it injures them very materially,
it kills them, in fact.
1375. Have you made any arrangements to give Avater to your stock independent of the creek ?
Yes.
1376. What arrangements have you made ?—Dams.
1377. Would you have made those arrangements had it not been for the mining operations ?—Yes,
I should have; but I have to keep the male sheep away from the creek, Avhen it Avould be far more to my
benefit to run them upon the creek.
1378. What length along the creek does your land that is injured by flood occupy ?—The Avhole
of the BucknalPs estate is about eleven miles and a half, but my OAvn is only about three and a half.
1379. Do you think that if the mining companies Avere to. carefully stack the sludge, and return the
Avater as clear as it can be returned, by passing it through a aeries of dams, so that the Avater Avould
still be discoloured but the heavy slum kept behind, would that be injurious to stock ? —No, I think not,
provided of course there is a great latitude in that, seeing that the Avater will still be discoloured —it might
be discoloured only slightly, or a very great deal. If it Avere only slightly discoloured, I think it would not.
1380. What I want to arrive at is this—Avould you, as a farmer, raise an objection to the discolouration
of the water, provided it is not carrying a very large quantity of silt in suspension ?—I do not think it
Avould do any damage. I should have no objection to only a slight discolouration.


1381. Do you know tlie creek that passes below the mines in the Hepburn Estate, say the Hepburn
Consols and Hepburn Ho. I—do you know that creek? —Yes; it is called Birch’s Creek, I think.
1382. Ho, not Birch’s Creek; it is a creek that runs another way ?—Then it is the Middle Creek.
1383. Do you think that that creek would be sufficiently clear not to interfere with the stock ?—I
can hardly say, because I have not seen that creek lately. I know the creek, but I have not seen it lately,
and I could hardly answer the question.
1881. Do you know the mine waters that are being pumped out there, but the Lord Harry ?
Ho, I have not been up there lately'.
1385. Or any of those companies ?—Ho, nor any of those companies.
1386. When land is not subjected to the recurrence of the overflow, does it regain its power of sus-
taining vegetation ?—lt does in some places, but in some places it is so thick that it cannot. For instance,
where it has two feet of sludge upon it, nothing can grow through it. It is rather sandy. It seems to
come through the sludge, but not through the sand. In some places pure sand—crushed quartz —is deposited,
and that is so loose upon the top that the roots of the vegetation cannot get hold at all, and there are acres
and acres of land of that sort where no vegetation grows whatever; it is nothing but pure crushed quartz.
1387. In your property, anew channel has been cut for the creek, has it not ?—Hot upon my property.
1388. You know where I mean, abovo the bridge, by an abandoned property running from yours
directly south ?—You mean that the creek has made a fresh channel for itself ?
1389. Ho, it has been artificially cut?—Ho, I do not know of anything like that.
1890. Do you know of any place on that creek along your property where the banks, not the mere
bed of the creek, have been tilled by quartz tailings—not the sludge merely but principally quartz tailings,
outside the bed of the creek, where the deposit upon the lands has been quartz tailings V—Yes, upon my
own land those places I speak of are crushed quartz.
1391. Does vegetation grow upon that after a time ?—Ho, it is too loose, it cannot get a hold.
1892. I have asked the question upon the term “ stock,” you have answered for sheep only. Do you
make the same reply with regard to cattle ?—Ho, I have never found it to injure cattle.
The xoitness withdrew.
Frederick Bucknall sworn and examined.
1393. By the Board. —Where is your residence and what is your occupation ?—My residence is upon
the Middle Creek, in the parish of Rodborough, and my occupation is that of a grazier.
1394. Ilow long have you been grazing in that district ?—Myself, since 1870.
1395. You have heard the evidence given by Mr. Albert Bucknall ?—Yes.
139 G. What would you like to add to that, or in wliat do you differ from it ? —What he has said is
very true. I think there is a little more to say, though, in regard to farming. I have cultivated the flats.
My lioldiug is only grazing; I was stopped from cultivation through the sludge.
1897. Where is the land situated that you were cultivating ?—My property is about a mile and a half
below my brother’s, on the same creek.
1898. Upon the Tullaroop or Deep Creek ?—Yes, almost the next property below.
1399. How many acres were you debarred from cultivating ?—About 100.
1400. In what way ?—The sludge. When I put a crop in, and the crop was up, towards the end of
winter, a flood nearly every time came over it and destroyed it, by leaving about 4 to G inches to 1 foot of
sludge over it.
1401. Does the flood come often. Ilow often does a flood occur, so as to swamp that land of yours ?
—Every year till the last four or five years; and these few dry seasons the floods have not been quite over
them. They come over portions of the flats, but not over all the flats.
1402. If the deposit of sludge ceases, would your land again become fit for cultivation ?—lf no more
came, the bulk of the flats would, because I think, by ploughing deep, I might get up some of the black
soil amongst the sludge.
1403. What is the frontage of your land to the creek?—About two miles.
1404. And how high—does the highest flood or the ordinary high yearly flood break over your land?
—The heavy floods will go a foot over the highest portions of those flats.
1405. Would you say how much over the lowest ? —Seven or eight feet deep, and leave quite a foot
of sand when it comes like that over the lowest portions of the flat, and the highest 6 inches to 1 foot.
140 G. Do you remember the creek before it was filled up?—l do, very well indeed.
1407. Ilow much lias it filled up in depth ?—The creek was a magnificent creek, with large water-
holes, and good fish in it, and they are completely filled. In my ground, the floods go right over the flats.
1408. Do you remember floods over that land before there was any filling up of the creek ?—Yes,
before there was any mining, but then the floods always left a deposit of very rich slimy soil; that was very
rich for the flats.
1409. In flats of that size, is there much deposit brought down by the waters, —surface waters—when
at the height of a flood, or is it not deposited more when the flood is falling ? —I do not think there is much
difference whether it is rising or falling. During the floods, the greater the quantity of water that comes
down the greater the quantity of sand that comes down.
1410. Then, in your case, it is impossible for you to protect your land by embankment or any other
means ?—I do not think I could; the larger floods would break over any embankment, and, in that case, it
deposits more sludge on account of the embankment. I was managing the station before it was separated
amongst us, and when my father had it, and I had flats of magnificent lucerne, and the first flood in 1870
destroyed all that. The lucerne wont down 18 to 20 feet deep upon those flats, and the barley grass was
so thick it would carry any amount of stock, and after that flood it was completely destroyed for several
years, till it began to sweeten again, and some thistles grov r over it. We never grow lucerne now; we could
not do it. The last I put in was completely smothered.
1411. You heard Mr. Albert Bucknall’s evidence upon the question of discolouration of the water —
that the water, if not carrying so large a quantity in suspension, is not injurious to cattle ?—Yes.
1412. And if it were properly stacked, it might very possibly be not objectionable even for sheep ?
Yes, I quite agree with that.


1413. You would not raise an objection from mere discolouration, if it was not carried too far?—lso.
1414. To wlmt use do you put the 100 acres you are unable now to cultivate?—lt grows principally
thistles, and in summer time the sheep eat up the thistles. We cannot do anything with the ground at all.
1415. How many sheep were you able to feed upon that 100 acres ? —I suppose quite a couple of
sheep to the acre.
1416. What is the total extent of your holding ?—Three thousand acres.
1417. Have you made any arrangements for the obtaining of water, otherwise than the creek, for
your cattle and stock ?—No; I have two springs that run into the creek that they water at principally, but
they water at the creek too, and I have to take my chance of any of them being hurt.
1418. Have you an ample supply from the springs?—Yes, an ample supply from the springs. It is
a kind of stricture that the wethers get from drinking the creek water.
1419. Seeing that you have another water supply, do you find that they go much to the creek ?
Yes, they drink at the creek sometimes, but principally at the springs. I think that is why my sheep
have not been injured by the floods, but they know what is deleterious to them, I think. Sometimes
the creek is very good and clear, and at other times it is very muddy. In the summer time it runs
pretty clear.
1420. During the winter, do you notice whether the debris in the creek is carried down much by
floods? —Yes, it travels down very fast, and keeps on travelling by the strong current in winter.
1421. And you are fed then again by the debris up above?—Yes, you can see the heavy sand
travelling ; it is continually coming down. Of course, the light stuff floats in the water, but you can see
the heavy sand continually travelling doAvn.
1422. You are not able to express any opinion as to what extent any of this sludge has hitherto
gone down to the Loddon ?—No.
1423. Have you noticed the growth of the trees to bo injured upon the banks ?—Certainly, they are
alj. dying. Every tree dies unless there is some current round the trunk sweeping away the sand.
1424. To what do you attribute that—to the quartz tailings or to the sludge ?—To both, I think. I
think it is a fact, they are being banked up so high that all the trees are dying down the creek. On my
brother’s land they are all dead.
1425. You attribute that to the cutting off the air round the trees, and not to anything so much con-
tained in the quartz tailings ? —I could not say. On my brother Edward’s land there is about 250 acres
destroyed by the sludge. Altogether, there is about eleven and a half miles down the creek from my
brother’s land down to the lowest point.
1426. Where does that land lie ?—He is next below me.
1427. Running down to where ? —To below Rodborough. He has got about 250 acres destroyed in
the same way —the finest flats, all lucerne flats.
1428. Does the water get more over those flats ?—Yes, they are broader flats, and there is more
extent of country destroyed.
1429. Still those flats would have been flooded prior to any mining operations ?—Yes ; but they are
enriched by the floodings before the sludge came. The sheep are damaged by the sludge in another way ;
the sand blows about greatly, and running about in the sand it blows up into the wool, and takes from the
value of the wool.
1430. You now speak of quartz sand ? —The bulk of it is quartz sand.
1431. Below Clunes ?—Yes.
1432. It is more to the quartz sand you raise objection than to the alluvial slum ? —The quartz sand
predominates very largely. They are both bad.
The witness zoithdrew.
John Beveridge sworn and examined.
1433. By the Board. —Where is your residence ?—Glendower.
1434. What is your occupation ?—Grazier.
1435. What length of time have you been grazing here ?—I have been a resident over tiventy years.
1436. What is the size of your holding ?—Between three and four thousand acres.
1437. What is its situation ?—Between three and four miles beyond Clunes.
1438. Does it adjoin Mr. Bucknall’s ? —About five miles further to the south.
1439. There is a creek been you ?—Yes ; but a number of neighbours are there, that I represent; I
speak for more than myself in the matter.
1440. You have heard the evidence already given ?—Yes.
1441. Will you now give your views, bearing in mind what has already been stated; in what you
differ and what you think fit to add to it ?—There is one question I would like to point out that I do not
think Mr. Bucknall has entered into thoroughly, that is the destruction of tlio land. At the present time,
a great part of the year, this water is not fit for stock at all, they cannot drink it.
1442. You speak of stock —what stock do you speak of ?—Sheep and cattle both, and horses as well.
1443. What time of the year is that ? —Generally when the creek is running low; in fact, half the
year the water is unfit for stock. •
1444. That is the summer time—the drier time ?■—Generally, in the time when they have plenty of
water in the creek, the stock do not require it very much; they can get it from the crab holes and elsewhere,
but beyond that we have not got it.
1445. Does the sludge accumulate more in summer than in winter ? —At present, the creek has no
holes in it—it is as level as this table. It is simply a sludge channel. When Ave have plenty of water
running in the creek it is not so heavily polluted by sludge.
1446. Did you Icuoav the creek before mining operations affected it ?—Yes.
1447. What has been the change in it ?—When I came here there Avere Avater holes, from Clunes
doAvn to where I live, that Avould float a ship, tAventy and thirty feet deep. Such a thing as a water hole
does not exist now, it is simply a stream of running sludge.
1448. This goes back lioav far ?—Every year it is going on.


1449. How far back ?—At the .time I came we had a beautiful clear stream of water, second to
none in the colony. The holes get silted up with quartz sand and sludge, principally from the quartz tailings
—they destroy the creek; the fact is, avo shall be Avaterless in another few years. And I point out another
matter to you, this creek has iioav millions of tons of stuff; if Ave have a flood such as AA r e had in 1870, if it
goes doAvn to the bottom, it Avill fill up the dams and reservoirs made for irrigation purposes.
1450. Do you notice Avhether the bed of the creek is rising still ? —Yes, slowly, and has been for
years. We have not had a heavy flood in the creek for years.
1451. Is it still on the move during the Avinter ? —lt is on the move all the time.
1452. And more comes doAA r n than goes away at present?—Yes; but if we had a good flood, of
course it would give the creek a scour out, and it is bound to go further on, and cannot help itself.
1453. What is the length of frontage you have upon the creek ?—I suppose about a mile and a half,
close upon that.
1454. How many acres of your land arc actually injured by deposit ?—Our country is different from
Mr. Buckuall’s; the banks of the creek are steep, and the flats limited in extent, and Ave do not suffer so
much from the flats being flooded as he does. Of course, if the small flats are flooded as he describes, lam
just in the same position.
1455. Can you add anything to Avhat Mr. Bucknall has said as to the effect of quartz tailings or the
slum—separate it, if you can—upon the vegetation ?—lt is impossible to separate them.
145 G. I mean, have you seen places where the quartz tailings had accumulated more than the slum,
and the effect of such ?—ln parts, perhaps, tAvo feet of this dry sand. Of course, nothing can grow in it;
nothing at all.
1457. Trees have been killed on the creek ?—Yes ; but I think stock Avill die too. A number of my
neighbours* stock have died, and I believe it is through nothing but drinking this Avater; and I can
corroborate Mr. Bucknall as to the male sheep going wrong.
1458. In what Avay does it affect the cattle or sheep ?—lt is an accumulation of sand, 1 believe, in
the intestines; but they SAvell up doAvn beloAv, and the Avater goes \vrong.
1459. Is it proved by cutting them open that such exists ?—I have cut many of them open.
1460. Have you found that ? —Generally. If I shift them away for a feAv weeks or months, a
number of them come right; if I leaArn them upon the creek they die off.
1461. You hav r e not lost \ r ery much in land—Avhat should you consider in your case you suffer in
value of stock, and inconvenience to stock, through the creek being polluted ?—We will put it in this way,
that I hold between three and four thousand acres of land, and if there is no Avater in the district it must
depreciate. That land some time ago, Avhen I had pure water, was Avorth at any rate £2 an acre more than
it is now.
1462. Tavo pounds an acre over the land ?—lf you Avere going to purchase it yourself, and the
Avater was destroyed in it, you can form an idea yourself.
1463. You think the deterioration of the property is over the whole ?—Yes; I believe this creek
being depreciated as it is will depreciate property to the extent of £2 an acre.
1464. If the deposit principally ceases, your land Avould then regain to a great extent and almost
entirely its value, Birch’s Creek being sA\ r ept out ?—I believe it would, in time.
1465. Then this depreciation of your property Avoukl cease? —I believe so; at any rate, it would
begin to recover itself if once Ave had pure Avater about.
1466. Have you lost any cattle or sheep through being bogged in these holes ?—Yes, I have lost a
certain number of sheep occasionally, and, as I tell you, I shift the sheep back occasionally. I have a
number of dams upon the property, because the stock Avill not drink this water if they can help it.
1467. You have actually lost some ?—I have actually lost some. Some of my neighbours, Avho have
brood mares and so on, do not allow their mares to go to the creek; they have to Avater them. There is
Mr. Irvine, Avho is here, avlio is a breeder of horses, and he has to Avater his horses, and Avill not let them
go the creek, not only on account of the water but on account of their getting bogged.
1468. Can you give the names of others along the creek —any estimate of theirs as to the injury they
have sustained, or the depreciation they regard themselves as having suffered ?—I take it for granted that
my neighbours suffer equally with myself—Mr. Irvine, Mr. Fawcett, Mr. Russell, Mrs. Clark, and a number
of others who are here.
The witness withdrew.
Albert Bucknall further examined.
1469. By the Board. —You heard the questions I asked from Mr. Beveridge as to the loss upon the land.
Do you consider that your land has been depreciated, and to what extent?—Decidedly it has; but I should
hardly go so far as Mr. Beveridge in saying £2 an acre over the A\ r liole extent. But in my case, as in his
case, the creek goes clean through the middle of the property.
1470. In your case you have lost a large area of land; but in his case, the banks being steep, it does
not affect him so much ?— No.
1471. What do you think your land has been depreciated through the creek being filled ?—I think
£1 an acre, but not so much as £2.
1472. Over Avhat area? —I have about 4,000 acres.
1473. Would you put it down at £1 an acre over the Avhole 4,000 acres ? —Yes, I consider that in
selling the property it Avould depreciate the whole to that extent. I forgot one item in regard to it, Avlien
you were examining me; my brother mentioned it, but not me. These large sand-beds that are left in some
places Avhere the billabongs of the creek have been filled with sand—in some places those billabongs have
become the bed of the creek, and the old bed is filled up Avitli sand—the creek has straightened itself. The
sheep walk through those billabongs, and there is a great cloud of sand and sludge in the avool, and the
sand drops out in summer and it takes the yolk of the wool along with it, and the yolk of the avool is Avhat
makes the wool grow; it is like the essential soil of a plant.
1474. Would not you place that under the head of depreciation of the property; the property AA'ould
yield so much less a year?—Yes, you may put it that Avay, but that is one Avay that it does depreciate


property, mid it is a great depreciation. Some of the sheep do not run upon the creek, hut those that do
run upon it I reckon that it takes off fully 2s. a sheep from the value of the fleece.
1475. What do you reckon to be the loss in that particular—from the sand falling into the wool?
—Yes, 2s. per sheep upon 3,000 sheep, that is £3OO.
The. witness withdrew.
Frederick Bucknall further examined.
147 G. By the Board. —You heard the questions I asked of your brother as to depreciation. What
do you consider has been the depreciation through the filling up of the creek ?—The depreciation upon my
property ?
1477. Yes ?—The half of my property that lies upon the Deep Creek and the other half upon the
Middle Creek, upon 1,300 acres, there is quite £1 an acre depreciation—that is the 1,300 acres that go
down to the creek.
1478. Albert Bucknall. —The creek runs just along the edge of my brothers property; but in Mr.
Beveridge’s case and my own it runs right through the middle.
1479. By the Board (to Frederick Bucknall). —What number of sheep do you include in that valua-
tion ? —Sixteen hundred.
1480. Do you attribute any depreciation in them to the causes mentioned by your brother ?—Yes.
1481. At what rate ?—About Is. 6d., I suppose. It does not damage my sheep quite as much as
my brother’s.
The witnesses withdrew.
David Irvine sworn and evamined.
'""1482. By the Board. —Where is your residence ? —Glendower.
1483. How long have you been in the district ?—About 28 years.
1484. Engaged in what ?—ln farming.
1485. You have heard the evidence of Mr. Beveridge ?—Yes.
1480. Do you wish to add anything to it?—No; I quite endorse everything Mr. Beveridge has said.
1487. Whereabouts is your property situated ?—About a mile further north of Mr. Beveridge.
1488. Between Mr. Beveridge and Mr. Bucknall ?—Yes.
1489. How many acres have you?—l have only 120 or 125 acres there.
1490. Do you front the creek ?—Yes.
1491. What length of your property fronls the creek ?—I think about, perhaps, 24 chains.
1492. Have you flat lands upon the creek?—Yos, but not much.
1493. How much would you say ?—I could not say; just a few acres only.
1494. Are those few acres overrun by deposit at any time ?—Yes, a little.
1495. To what depth ?—From a foot to six inches.
1496. Often ? —Every time there is a Hood, nearly; and, of course, it is always increasing.
1497. Would there be any difficulty in your banking out that foot to eighteen inches? —I could not
do it.
1498. Why not?—Because there is so much of it.
1499. You have a frontage of 24 chains ? —Yes, there is a portion of that would be six and seven
feet deep, but upon the flat ground it Avould average from six inches to a foot, but near the creek it is seven
or eight feet; in fact, the holes are filled up almost level with the banks of the creek, and level with the
flats.
1500. What do you use the land for at present, that 24 acres ?—Just for running stock on, cattle
and horses.
1501. Not for agricultural purposes ?—No.
1502. Is the land fit for agricultural purposes ? —I cannot say that it is; the banks are too precipitous.
1503. Where do your stock water ? —At this place.
1504. In the creek ?—Yes.
1505. Have you any other means of watering stock ?—No other means.
1500 Do you find your stock suffer in any way from watering at the creek ?—Yes; and not only
that, but this winter we had some breeding mares, and we were obliged to water them by bucket at the
house. It was not safe for them to go to the creek.
1507. In what way ?—They were sticking in the sludge.
1508. How much was the creek filled up opposite to your paddock ? —Level with the bank.
1509. What depth of sludge do you think there is there?—l believe some of the water-holes upon
our property were twelve or fourteen feet deep.
1510. You have said already that you agree with the evidence given by Mr. Beveridge ?—Yes, I
quite endorse everything he said.
1511. Is there anything else you wish to add ? —No.
1512. Can you tell me what you consider the depreciation of your land; what is your loss owing to
this state of things ?—lt is ruin to my land altogether, for I cannot make dams upon my land, it is too
level.
1513. You cannot say that altogether. What would be the difference upon the sale of your laud
from what it was before?—Sometimes the stock will come away from the creek; they will not taste the
water, it is so thick.
1514. What do you consider the value of your land to be at the present time?—£6 or £7 an acre;
but if it continues in the way it is doing, it will be valueless.
1515. What I want to arrive at from you is, what is your idea of the amount to which you have
suffered through this ?—I consider it £2 an acre, if I was selling the land.
1516. Over the whole property ?—lt is all affected the same.
The icitness withdrew.
-Sludoe. G


Thomas Fawcett sworn and examined.
1517. By the Board. —What is your address ?—Glengower.
1518. And your occupation ?—Grazier.
1519. How long have you been occupied in this locality as a grazier ?—From ten to twelve years,
with my father.
1520. What is the situation of the property; whereabouts is it with regard to Mr. BucknalFs, or
any of those who have given evidence ?—lt is situated beside Mr. Beveridge’s. Mr. Beveridge comes in
between us with a good many of his paddocks.
1521. Comes in between some of your paddocks ?—Yes, comes in between some of our paddocks.
1522. What is the area of your holding—how many acres ?—I think 6,000 acres.
1523. And what length of frontage have you upon the creek ?—About three miles.
1524. What arrangements have you made for watering your stock. First of all, is your stock cattle
or sheep ?—Both; we keep both cattle and sheep.
1525. How many, and in what proportionate number of head ?—I think we run sheep over about
half the area, and cattle over the other half.
1526. It would be as well to give us the number approximately of sheep or cattle ? —That we run ?
1527. Yes ?—This is xipon the Tullaroop Creek—about 4,000 sheep and 200 head of cattle.
1528. You heard the evidence given by Mr. Beveridge ?—Yes.
1529. Have you anything that you wish to add?—No, I think not. I fully agree with Mr.
Beveridge.
1530. Will you give us your estimate of the depreciation in your property by the creek bed having
been filled by mining operations ?—I think fully £2 per acre.
1531. Over how many acres ?—lf we were going to sell it, I think over the whole area, for we
depend upon the creek principally for water. We have dams in some of the paddocks, but they may go dry
in the summer months.
1532. That, you consider, Avould be the actual depreciation in the value of your property?—Yes.
1533. Do you make any allowance in that valuation for the fact that the mining operations, on the
other hand, have been the means of increasing the value of the land ?—lncreasing the value of our land ?
1534. Would the land be of the same value if there had never been any mining in the district ?—I
think it would have been worth more.
1535. Have you made any estimate of what your loss per year is upon the stock. You have given
us the depreciation of the land; how would you arrive at that—have you estimated the loss per head of
stock?—l know that our cattle that are running upon the Deep Creek, with the sludge water, do not improve
near so well as those that have clean water; they do not thrive so well.
1536. They do not thrive so well as those in your other paddocks ?—No.
1537. You have clear water for them in other paddocks ?—ln some paddocks we have.
1538. Do you ever have to move the stock from the paddocks upon the creek back to the paddocks
where there is the other water ? —We have taken them back some time before shearing ; the wethers that Mr.
Beveridge spoke about. We do not allow wether sheep to run upon the creek for any length of time.
1539. Is that on account of the water ?—lt is on account of the water.
The witness withdrew.
William Thomas sworn and examined.
1540. By the Board.- —Where do you reside ? —On Birch’s Creek.
1541. What is your occupation ?—Farmer.
1542. How long have you been farming there ?—Eight years.
1543. What is the area of your ground ?—Two hundred and fifty acres or thereabouts.
1544. How much of that fronts Birch’s Creek?—About ten chains, I expect. It must be more; I
cannot say exactly.
1545. Does Birch’s Creek ever overflow your land ?—No.
1546. Not even in flood time ?—No.
1547. What is the depth of the creek in front of your property—are there waterholes ?—There is one
waterhole there about 300 feet long, and I should say about five feet deep, and the rest of it is mostly
rapids.
1 548. What is the character of-the water now running down Birch’s Creek ?—Good water.
1549. At the present time you suffer no injury from any miuing operations ?—No, I do not.
1550. What is your object in coming here. Do you wish to lay anything before the Board ?—No,
I have nothing to say. 1 think it is quite impossible for them to impound the sludge upon the plains, but
I do not know that 1 could tell you anything more than you know.
1551. Have you been concerned in any representations made upon the subject of Birch ; s Creek to
the local bodies, or to the Government? —Yes, I have.
1552. Will you state in what way ?—I Avas one of the party to send down a deputation to meet the
Minister of Mines, I believe.
1553. What was the object of that ?—I subscribed towards it.
1554. What was the object of that?—To try to get the sludge impounded, so that the mines upon
Birch’s Creek should not pollute it.
1555. Representing that preventive measures should be taken to prevent the pollution of Birch’s
Creek—was that it ?■ —Yes.
The toitness withdrew.
Murdoch McKenzie sworn and examined.
1556. By the Board. —Where is your residence?—Birch’s Creek; close to the creek.
1557. Are you a farmer?—Yes.
1558. An agriculturist or grazier ?—Both conjoined.


1559. How long have you been farming in that locality ?—Twenty-four years.
1560. You heard what was said by the last witness on Birch’s Creek ?—Yes.
1561. Do you agree with what he has said ?—Yes.
1562. Have you anything to complain of at present ?—Not at the present time. Two or three years
ago I had plenty of sludge from the Madam Berry —four years ago.
1568. What action was taken in the matter ?—I had to get an injunction put upon the claim, or else
I would have had to leave the place.
1564. Did you get an injunction ?—Yes.
1565. What action did the Madam Berry take in consequence of that ?—They cut a drain, and put
the sludge into the Glen Donald Creek.
1566. Have you ever been to any mines where sludge was stacked ?—Yes.
1567. Have you ever seen sludge stacked so that the water resulting from it would give you no
grounds for complaint ?—Yes, down at Sebastopol, below Ballarat. I saw a quantity of sludge stacked there,
and water not so bad coming from it. It was discoloured a little.
1568. If that water was like what comes from Sebastopol, would you consider the farmers upon
Birch’s Creek would not have anything to complain of? —When I was living down at Inverleigh, near
Geelong, the water could be drunk by the cattle, and mining upon Sebastopol was in full swing.
1569. You think it is possible to so arrange tlmt mining shall not be injured, and yet the water be
made fit for cattle to use. If the miners conserved the water in dams, could they send water down thecreek
that you could not object to as a farmer ?—lt would not hurt for cattle if it was stacked properly, but then
it could not be used for domestic purposes. There is no way of keeping the sludge for it to be drinkable by
people.
1570. Are you dependent entirely upon Birch’s Creek for water ?—I have another creek going
through my land, besides a spring here. The creek rises at the Madam Berry, and I have springs
tlidte too.
1571. Where do you obtain water for your own domestic purposes now ?—Off my house.
1572. Then, as far as you are concerned, you would not go to Birch’s Creek for domestic water ?
—No.
1573. What is the area of your land ?—Six hundred acres.
1574. And how much of that fronts the creek? —Seventy-five chains.
The ivitness loithdrew.
Philip Perrcell sworn and examined.
1575. By the Board. —Where do you live?—Birch’s Creek.
1576. Arc you a farmer?—Yes.
1577. Agriculturist or grazier ?—Both.
1578. What is the area of your farm ? acres.
1579. What length of that is upon the creek ?—I suppose about 25 chains.
1580. Where do you get water for domestic purposes now ?—Out of the creek. I have no place
else to get it.
1581. Is the water in the creek of good quality? —No, it is getting damaged.
1582. In what way is the water in that creek getting damaged?—Sludge.
1583. In Birch’s Creek now ?—Yes, in Birch’s Creek now.
1584. Where does the sludge come from ?—I suppose out of the claims.
1585. But you do not know ?—I am sure.
1586. But you cannot say what claims it comes from ?—I could not exactly swear, but I know there
are two or three claims with the water coming into the creek.
1587. But Birch’s Creek at the present time is very clear, is it not ?—No, it is not ; it is rising up.
1588. It seems to me to be a very clear stream, and I saw it to-day ? —I often have seen it a lot
clearer than it is to-day.
1589. But you know that at this time of the year, after rains, no creek is clear ?—There was no rain
to hurt it, to make it dirty.
1590. Have you anything that you wish to add to the evidence already given by the two last
witnesses who live upon Birch's Creek ?—lf the water comes down any dirtier than it is, or any more
sludge comes down, it will ruin my paddock altogether. My paddock is quite flat upon the creek.
1591. But, as a matter of fact, can you say that sludge is coming down at all ?—lt is coming down
in a way. It is not exactly bad, but I know the creek is dirty towards the way it used to be.
1592. Whereabouts is your farm situated. Is it above the weir or below the weir?—Below ; close
upon the powder magazine.
1593. Have you suffered any damage at present ?—No, not at present. But I have seen, when there
were floods in the creek, about four acres of my paddock flooded.
1594. When did you last see sludge in the creek ?—I do not see much sludge in it, but I see the
water always coming down yellow and dirty.
1595. Is not that due to the sludge sent by the Madam Berry previously, that has been discontinued?
—I do not think any sludge comes from the Madam Berry claim.
1596. Not now r'—No.
1597. Is not what you are complaining of sludge that came down some time ago?—Yes.
1598. Not from any company at present?—l saw it, I suppose, two months ago. The water was
quite blue, coming down like drift, and everything else coming in the water together.
1599. Was the water brackish ?—Ye?, it was ; and it is not fit to be used now.
1600. What was the condition of the waier in Birch’s Creek during the summer time before there
was any mining. Was it brackish then ?—You might meet an old hole that would be a little brackish, but,
to take it generally, the water was fresh.
1601. But, if the water got very low, it would become brackish?—lt might in some holes, but
not all.
The witness withdrew.


Malcolm MacCallum sworn and examined.
1002. By the Board. —Wliat are you ?—Farmer.
160?>. Agriculturist or grazier ?—Both.
1604. And where is your farm ?—Within two miles of Chines, here, right across.
1605. Upon any creek ?—Upon Birch’s Creek.
1606. What is the area of your farm ?—One hundred and sixty-one acres.
1007. Plow much of that land is abutting the creek? —About 93 acres.
1608. And what length of your land fronts the creek ?—I suppose it will be close upon 25 chains—
between that and 30. lam not sure to a chain or two.
1009. What is the condition of Birch’s Creek water at the present time? —Very bad, sometimes;
some days it is pretty good, and other days as yellow as clay.
1010. What do you attribute that to ?—To the mines.
1611. Have you been up to the mines at all recently ? —Not recently; I have been last summer.
1612. Do you know, as a fact, whether any mines are delivering sludge into Birclr’s Creek at
present?—l know one mine, to my knowledge, was letting down dirty water; for sludge, I could not say.
1613. Do you know what mine that is?—l do not know the name of the mine. It is the left-hand
side of the creek, as you go up next to Hall’s.
1614. Is it nearly opposite the Lord Harry ?—Almost opposite the Lord Harry.
IGIS. Would you know the name if I mention it to you ?—I think it is Berry No. 1.
1616. What Berry No. 1 is delivering is mine-water, is it not; they have not got into the wash? —
They have a race going north-east, I think, and that race was letting the water down to a certain gully;
and part of it, at any rate, flowed down that gully on the south-east of the Hall, I think.
1617. Do you consider that the water of Birch’s Creek has seriously deteriorated by anything that
is being brought in, or has been brought in ?—I am sure of it. I have seen this creek 32 years ago, and it
was one of the finest creeks in the colony, with the loveliest water to be found in the colony.
1618. Does Birch’s Creek become clear in any part of the summer? —Sometimes it does, and some-
times it does not. Sometimes the sludge or polluted water comes down and spoils it. It is unfit for any
one to use. On some occasions I have to come to Clunes here for water for domestic use.
1619. You could not drink the water in Birch’s Creek ?—I could not drink the water in Birch’s
Creek.
1620. What was that from ?—lt was so clayey.
1621. Was it brackish ?—1 suppose it was both, but the clay was the worst.
1622. How long ago is that ?—Close upon twelve months. I had to do that, and we made a complaint
since about the sludge, and it got better for a time.
1623. Was it before the injunction was obtained against the Madam Berry?—Yes, before that. I
am not certain; I believe it was before.
1624. Would not the sludge that has come down discolouring the water be the sludge that was run
down from the Madam Berry before the injunction was obtained ?—I am not quite sure; but I know the
water was so bad that it could not possibly be drunk by any human being.
1625. Is the water since the last rains, the rains of the last six weeks, better or worse in Birch’s
Creek than it was before?—l noticed it particularly, and my wife has made the remark to me a few days
since that the water is clearer in the creek than it has been for a month or two, a few days ago.
1626. Have you suffered auy injury at all from the condition of the water in BirclFs Creek, beyond
the fact that you had to go elsewhere to obtain your domestic water on one occasion ?—Of course, it has
been drinkable for stock so far; but, unless wo are prompt against the sludge coming down, it would have
been to-day quite useless for both man and beast.
1627. If you had not taken the action you did ?—Exactly.
1628. At present, you have no ground to complain, are we to understand ? —The only complaint we
have got is that if we have a dry summer, and the house is unable to give us water for family use, then
we go to the creek; and, if the creek is bad, then we have to come to Clunes, and go to the pipes, and pay
for it.
1629. Before there was any mining at all, did the water of Birch’s Creek, during the summer, become
brackish ?—A little; but, to my knowledge, for the 32 years 1 have seen that creek, it was always a running
creek, and a good creek. I beliove lam the oldest resident in Clunes. We must cither get water some-
where else, or else keep the water we have fresh. We cannot do without it; it is impossible.
The witness withdrew.
James Dixon sworn and examined.
1630. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—Grazier.
1631. Where is your farm situated ?—On the creek that comes from the Madam Berry down to
Clunes, here, and joins Birch’s Creek about Grundimau’s Bridge, as we call it.
1632. You are not talking of Glen Donald Creek? —No, the creek that comes down from Mr.
McKenzie, from the Madam Berry.
1633. Is that a constantly running creek ?—We have a constant water supply there. I have occupied
the laud now 1 have been a resident of Clunes over 30 years, and I have never seen those holes dry yet.
1634. Is it a regular water-course ?—lt is a regular water-course.
1635. Where does it take its rise?—Above the Madam Berry, and down the valley all the way.
1636. Is your property on both sides of the creek ?—Yes.
1637. What is the area of the property ?—Two hundred acres.
1638. What amount of stock do you hold upon that ?—As much as ever 200 acres will hold.
1639. Sheep or cattle ?—All cattle ; dairy cows mostly.
1640. Where do you water your cattle ?—Upon this creek alone.
1641. Where do you obtain water for domestic use ? —I live in Clunes.
1642. But you water your cattle from this creek ?—My dairy cattle are supplied from this creek.
1643. Have you any complaint to make with regard to any of the operations of the miners ns
affecting your property ? —lf the sludge comes down, which was delivered formerly by the Madam Berry—


but that does not come now —bnt if the water is defiled, as it was twelvemonths or two years ago, my
cattle could not exist.
1644. But that is not occurring ?—lt is not occurring now.
1645. And if it does not occur again, do you suffer any loss ?—I suffer no loss.
The ivitness withdrew.
John Kennedy sworn and examined.
IG4G. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—I keep a lot of cattle—dairy cattle.
1G47. Where is your farm ?—At both sides of the creek.
1648. Which creek ?—BircUs Creek.
1649. Whereabouts —how far from Clunes ?—About a mile, I believe; close to where the powder
magazine is.
IGSO. How many acres ? —I have got 134 acres, the property of Mr. Bath. I pay rent for it.
1651. You are a leaseholder ?—I am a leaseholder, and have got some Government ground.
1652. What length does the property extend along the creek ?—I believe it would be nearly half-a-
mile along the creek, as far as I could guess.
1G53. What condition is Birch’s Creek water in now ?—This morning it looks very well, but a few
mornings ago it looked very bad.
1654. What do you call looking bad ?—Like mining mullock coming along in it.
1655. You know that when rain has been falling, all creeks and rivers passing through agricultural
lands or friable lands are liable to bring down a certain amount, of sediment, and discolour the Avater ?—lt
looked Avorse than that; it looked like sludge coming from mining.
1656. Do you know, as a fact, that any sludge Avas coming from mining ? —I could not sAvear where
it came from, because I did not see the mines.
1G57. Where do you obtain Avater from, for domestic purposes ?—I have tanks about my house, but
I get some from the creeks. The cattle depend entirely upon the creek.
IGSB. lloav many head of cattle do you keep ?—Between 30 and 40. I have not 40 noAV —a little
over 30,1 think.
1659. Has the Avater ever been in such condition as to be injurious to your cattle ?—lt Avas a feAV
days ago, as I think it avus A r ery bad; I did not like it at all; I did not know Avhere to go to complain about
it. It A\ r as very bad; it Avas not so bad this morning, as far as I could see.
1660. If the Avater is no Avorse, upon the average, than it is uoav, have you any ground to complain ?
—lf it Avas like this morning, I think it Avould do; but two or three mornings ago it Avas Avorse.
1061. Had there been heavy rain during the night ?—I do not helieA'e it Avas heavy rain; I think it
Avas affected by something more than rain.
1662. Is the Avater SAveet ?—Yes. To-day it looked well, as I Avas putting the cattle across.
I said in my house it was looking better than it Avas, but if it continued as it Avas a feAV days ago I do not
knoAV Avhat avo should do.
1G63. Was the colour clay-colour ?—lt Avas; it looked like mining sludge.
IGG4. Did you knoAV Birch’s Creek before there Avas any mining upon the creek ?—I did, avcll.
1G65. During the summer Avas the water brackish ?—Not to my knowledge; it A\ r asvery good Avater,
fit for any use.
1666. Do you consider that, up to the present, you have sustained any appreciable damage ?—I do
not think it so far, to my knowledge; no damage, as far as I can see, yet. If Ave were to lose the Avater
Ave should all suffer damage. I think it Avould ruin us altogether; Ave cannot do Avithout Avater.
The icitness withdrew.
William Grove sAVorn and examined.
16G7. By the Board. —Where is your residence ? —Birch’s Creek.
1668. What is your occupation ?—Publican.
1G69. Do you oavu any land ? —Only tAvo acres ; it does not affect the land at all—it is only the
Avater.
1670. Do yo hold any public position ?—I am one of the managers of the Common.
1671. For Avhom—under whose control are the Commons ?—Board of Land and Works.
1672. lloav long have you held that position ?—About eight years.
1673. IlaA r e you heard the evidence given in regard to Birch’s Creek ?—Yes.
1674. Is there anything further you Avish to say about it ?—lf it does not get any Averse than it is
to-day,it is right enough; but I think they kneAv that you were coming here, and Avould go and see the creek,
and it is a deal better than it Avas a Aveek ago. Last Sunday Aveek it was like thick mullock.
1675. Of a clay colour ?—No, it Avas pipeclay—no doubt about what it Avas.
1676. Have you been up about the mining portion lately ?—I Avas up about three months ago at
Wheeler’s Bridge, and I called there at a house, and they were carting Avater, and I asked Avhere they Avere
carting it to, and they said they Avere carting it to that diamond drill there. There Avas plenty of clear-
looking Avater running doAvn there, but these Government men had the Avater carted out of the race that
comes down to Clunes, before the water comes into it from the mines.
1677. That Avas for their OAA r n personal use ?—Yes, but people and all doAvn here haA’e to drink it.
1678. You say the Avater Avas the colour of pipeclay ? —Yes.
1679. Where Avas that Avater coming from ?—From the mines, no doubt..
1680. What mine ?—There are only one or two mines Avashing; it must have been a mine that Avas
washing.
1681. What mines are Avashing ?—The Madam Berry is Avashing. Ido not knoAV Avhether there
are any others.
1682. But the Madam Berry goes the other Avay ?—I do not knoAV; it may not all go, but it was
pipeclay anyway.
1683. Do you remember Avhen the injunction was taken out against the Madam Berry ?—Yes,


1684. How long ago was that approximately ?—Three or four years.
1685. Was any sludge letinto the creek before that time ?—I do not know; it never came down to us.
1686. Was not it that sludge noAv coming down?—No, it does not come down in the floods; it is not
ill flood when it is bad; but it is when they happen to let it off" from the dam, that is what I think it is—
when the water has been dammed back at the claim, I think they let it off" at night occasionally.
1687. Remember that this is evidence being taken down, and it is useless to give evidence of what
you are not certain; —you are not certain this comes from any mine ? —I am sure it could not come from
the surface. lam certain it may have come from a mine, but what mine Ido not know.
1688. It may have come from a mine, but not be coming from it now ?—I do not know. There
is about 500 head of cattle drinking this water. It will not hurt the cattle, if it is not worse than it is at
present; but a lot of residents upon the creek have to drink the water. It is not drinkable whore theso
flushes come down of this stuff.
1689. Do you remember the creek before there were any mining operations ?—Yes.
1690. Is the creek any worse to-day than it used to be at the same time of year before there was any
mining ? —lt is worse to-day, but not much worse to-day.
The toitness withdrew.
1691. Tlie Chairman inquired whether any agriculturist or grazier wished to give evidence. No
person responded.
Rivett Henry Bland sworn and examined.
1692. By the Board. —Where is your residence ?—I live at Clunes.
1693. What is your occupation ? —I am general manager of the Port Philip Company.
1694. How long have you held that position ?—I came out in 1852 as the resident director of that
company. I took the Clunes mine in 1858, and commenced work in that year.
1695. How long has the mine been in operation ? —Since then ; in fact, from 1857, I may say.
1696. Can you tell us about the total quantity of quartz that has been crushed during that period ?
—We have crushed 1,310,735 tons.
1697. Are you still sending a proportionate quantity through the battery? —No, very small indeed;
they have nearly stopped. They are now sinking a shaft in hopes of finding fresh leads, but we are raising
scarcely any quartz at all now—it has ceased working.
1698. What proportion of pyrites do you find in the quartz ? —The average is about one and a half
per cent.
1699. You treat the pyrites upon your own works ?—Yes ; we concentrate it first, separate from the
sand in buddies, and then we roast and grind it separately.
1700. Do you condense the fumes in the roasting ?—The greater part of them.
1701.. Where is your battery situated—is it near the creek ?—lt is close to the creek. Very near; it
is Avithin 200 or 300 feet of the creek.
1702. Where do you deliver your tailings ?—They run into the creek.
1703. And where do you deliver the Avater from the pyrites works ?—That all goes into the creek,
or nearly all of it.
1704. Have you ever made any attempt to stack your tailings ?—No, avc have not.
1705. Or to stack the Avater from the pyrites ? —No, the most of it goes into the creek. A good deal
of it is upon the flat —soaking into the flat—but it is not a very great quantity.
1706. That is from the pyrites ?—That is from the pyrites.
1707. The tailings have all gone into the creek? —The tailings have all gone into the creek.
1708. What is the area of your lease ?—One hundred and sixty acres. But it is only 30 or 40 acres
of that that Ave haA T e been mining under. All the rest there is nothing under, that avc knoAv of. It is a
long strip of ground half-a-mile long, or more than that, and less than a quarter of a mile Avide.
1709. Half-a-mile along the creek?—No, quarter of a mile along the creek. The quantity of
ground that there is quartz in is very narroAv, and it is less than a quarter of a mile.
1710. In the portion fronting the creek there is a considerable number of acres of flat land, is there
not ?—Yes.
1711. Would it not have been possible to have stacked your tailings upon that flat land ?—Yes, it is
possible to do it, of course.
1712. You anticipate, or you hope rather, that in sinking you may make a neAv find ?—That is the
hope, Avhat Ave are sinking for. We are prospecting tlie ground at greater depth, in the hope of finding
payable quartz. Whether Ave do or not is a matter of uncertainty.
1713. Should you make another find, so as to resume Avork, would it in any Avay be practicable to
stack your tailings upon the flat land ?—No, it Avould not be impracticable.
1714. Hoav many head of stampers have you ?—Eighty.
1715. Have those been in full work ?—They have been in full work. We commenced with only
tAventy, and went on adding to that, till about eighteen years ago we had about 80 head.
1716. Where do you obtain the Avater for your Avorks ? —Partly from the mine and partly from the
Water Commission.
1717. You do not obtain sufficient from the mine ?—No.
1718. Without entering into detail of that, can you tell us ?—The quantity of Avater consumed by
the stamps, Avlien in full Avork, is about eight gallons per stamper-head per minute. In the year 1877,
when Ave Avere in full Avork, Ave crushed 63,270 tons. The quantity of Avater that avc estimate AA r as used in
the stamps was 2,340,547 gallons, and that Ave paid the Water Commission for 210,000,000 of gallons.
The rest of it came from the mine. Before the reservoir Avas built, and the Avater was brought into Clunes
by the Commission, I had pumping works at Birch's Creek, and used to pump the Avater over. I had a
large locomotive, one of the Government locomotives, Avhich 1 bought, and force pumps, and pumped the
water up, and brought it right over to this creek.
1719. WTien you told us that the percentage of pyrites Avould be about one and a half per cent.,
tvould you apply that to the Avhole of the 1,300,000 tons?—For the first feAV years avc did not save any


pyrites. Everything was new 1 , and we did not know what to do, and we found that we Were wasting and
losing a great deal of gold, and then we commenced to save the pyrites. From 1857 to 1862, we did not
save any; in fact, in 1863, we did not save any. Then we began to save pyrites. The first year was 76
tons, and it went on then, and the highest was 400 tons in a year.
1720. Were you crushing more then?—No; we improved the process.
1721. Did the general average run the same of pyrites throughout the whole quartz ?—lt is a rough
average. In some you may find 3,4, 5 per cent., and in another load you may find scarcely any. The total
pyrites we have saved and treated from 1864 to the end of last year was 7,633 tons, which yielded about
30,000 ounces of gold. If you would like those returns, I can give it to you. It is not complete beyond a
certain period, but what I have given you is the total to the present time — Jianding in a paper']. That
return—[ handing in a paper ] —is the quantity of gold from all the mines at Clunes to that date.
1722. Should you resume work largely, and proceed to stack your tailings as you mentioned
previously, what method would you adopt ?—I think it would run in by gravitation. Ido not think we
need pump it. I think we could run the flaming so as to cover the flat with sand. Heavy floods may wash
some of it away again. It could be stored, a great part of it, there.
1723. Would you put a bank round the tailings?—No, I do not think it is necessary.
1724. It would be a great preventative as against floods ?—I think for a long time we could run it
upon a portion of the flat that would not be interfered with by floods. Ido not know for how many years.
1725. You would run the water off, I suppose, entirely from the top ?—Yes. Of course, the water
would run away into the creek.
1726. But you would have no bottom sluices in your dam?—No, the water would run away. This
quantity of water, eight gallons per head per minute, and eight head of stamps, the water would not remain
in the tailings; it would drain into the creek.
1727. I want, rather, to ascertain from you whether you would make a succession'of tailings dams,
or what course you Avould adopt ?—You see, there is no sludge. It is merely sand. It would not be muddy
Abater that Avould go in. It Avould be nearly clear Avater.
1728. All that Avould be necessary Avould be to let the water stand sufficiently long to settle ? —lt
Avould go through gradually. It would not be muddy. It is not like alluvial mining.

Joseph Bryant sworn and examined.
1729. By the Board. —Where is your residence?—Clunes.
1730. And occupation ? —Mining manager.
1731. Of what company ?—New North Clunes.
1732. Is that company in full work? —Yes.
1733. lloav long has the company been at work ?—Since 1863, I think.
1734. Where is the lease situated ?—Near the Tullaroop Creek.
1735. And the area of the lease ?—About 130 acres.
1736. Does your lease run down to the creek ?—Close on to the creek.
1737. Have you flat lands betAveen your machinery and the creek? —Yes.
1738. What quantity of quartz do you crush—Avhat quantity altogether have you crushed in the
mine ?—The total quantity crushed to the end of 188.5 Avould be 413,713 tons ; Ave have crushed from the
commencement of this year up to date 6,420 tons —a total quantity of 420,133 tons.
1739. Do you treat pyrites upon the Avorks?—Yes.
1740. What becomes of your tailings—where do you dispose of them?—They roll into the creek.
1741. And Avhere do you dispose of the water from your pyrites Avorks?—That also runs into the
creek.
1742. Has any attempt ever been made to stack the tailings ?—Not during my time.
1743. Do you knoAV of your personal knoAvledge Avhether any attempt has been made at any time
previously ?—I do not.
1744. Can you give any practical reason Avhy the tailings should not be stacked upon the flat lands
you have mentioned ?—No, I cannot, other than this, that it would entail additional cost upon the mining
operations.
1745. Can you give any idea of what the additional cost Avould be? —No, I have not thought of it
sufficiently.
1746. Have you ever had any experience upon claims Avhere tailings were stacked?—No.
1747. lloav many head of stamps have you? —Thirty at the present time.
1748. Where do you obtain the Avater from, and what quantity do you use ?—We obtain the prin-
cipal portion of the Avater from the Clunes Water Commission, and Ave also utilize the Avater we are pumping
out of the shaft. I find that, during the last tAvelve months, Ave have obtained from the Clunes Water Com-
mission 57,154 thousand gallons—that is for the battery—and 1,336 thousand gallons for boilers. We pay
Is. a thousand for battery purposes, and Is. a thousand for boilers. Then the total quantity used in
the last twelve months Avould be 84,770,000 gallons.
1749. That runs to the creek ? —Yes; a portion pumped out of it Avould be 26,280,000 gallons.
1750. lloav do you treat your pyrites?—Wo first burn it, and then grind it in Chilian mills. Of course,
concentrate it first, and then burn it and grind it.
1751. Do you use a condenser in the pyrites Avorks ? —No; I believe originally it Avas used. Perhaps
this may be information for the Board, but I heard that at that time the Avater from the condenser Avas
really more injurious in the public way than sending away the fumes through the stack.
1752. You mean the water passed doAvn into the creek contained more deleterious matter?—Yes,
and the cattle drinking it a great number of them died; and it-Avas through that, I understand, that the
condensing chamber Avas stopped then.
1753. You found it better to let the fumes escape?—Yes; not a great deal escapes, from the length
of the flue. The greater portion of both arsenic and sulphur are condensed in the stack, and we clean it out
occasionally, and dig pits and bury it.


1754. In the water passing into the creek from the pyrites works, there must be a certain proportion
of arsenic and sulphur sent down, is there not ?—I think very little. I think most of the sulphur and
arsenic is taken out of the stuff when it is going through the furnace. Ido not speak now as a chemist, hut
I think most of the arsenic and sulphur is sent away in fumes, and that the stuff left, sent through the
Chilian mills, with which water is mixed, is almost harmless.
1755. About how many tons a month do you put through ?—We have concentrated, for the present
year, from the Ist of January to date, 182 tons 7 cwt.
1756. Of pyrites ?—Of pyrites.
1757. And liow much of quartz ?—0,42(> tons.
1758. That is since the commencement of the year?—Yes. I have not got the total quantity of
pyrites treated ; 1 have only what we have concentrated from January to date.
1759. Would you he able to find the total quantity ?—Yes, I can find it out.
1760. Will you send it to the Secretary ?—Certainly, 1 will.
'The witness withdrew.
Thomas Ilewitson swown and examined.
1761. By the Board. —Where is your residence ?—Clunos.
1762. And occupation ?—Mining manager.
1765. For what company ? —South Chines United Company.
1764. How long have you held that position ?—About sixteen years, but the company has assumed
the title of the South Chines United for the last eighteen months—previous to that it was the South
Clunes Company, of which I was the manager.
1765. Where is your battery situated?—On the east side of the township, upon the Tullaroop Creek.
1766. How many head of stamps have you ?—Sixty.
1767. How many tons of quartz do you put through your stamps in a month ?—At the present time
we are crushing about 2,000 tons a month.
1768. What is the. total quantity you have put through ?—I have a tabulated statement here, if it
would serve your ends to take it ?
1761). Yes ?—That is up to the time the old company ceased work; it is in the paper; it gives the
total quantity of quartz crushed, and the number of tons of pyrites.
1770. Do yon make any attempt to stack your tailings ?—We do not.
1771. What do you do with the pyrites? —We concentrate it, and send it to the Port Philip to he
treated by that company.
1772. Where docs the water from the concentrator go to ?—Mr. Bland already stated hero that it
ran into the creek.
1773. But you concentrate it ?—Yes.
1774. And the water runs into the creek ?—Yes, but the water is pure from the pyrites.
1775. Wlnit is the quantity of "water you use per stamp ?—About eight gallons per stamp-head per
minute.
1776. Have you given the area of your lease ?—About 180 acres, I think.
1777. Is any portion of the area of your lease upon the opposite side of the creek ?—No, it does not
extend so far as that ; we have simply two or three building allotments close upon the creek that we have
our machinery upon, otherwise the machinery is apart from the lease altogether; it is upon private property.
1778. The battery is upon private property ?—The battery is upon private property.
1779. You know the piece of flat land in the bend of the river opposite your machinery ?—Yes.
1780. What practical difficulty is there in fluming your tailings across the creek, and stacking them
upon the opposite piece of ground ?—That could very easily be done at a small cost. Here is the balance-
sheet, that will give the total quantity crushed from the time of the inception of the present company—that
is last April, twelve months ago— \Jlanding in the same~\,
1781. That is the best information you can give us upon the subject ?—Yes.
, 1782. Is there any matter you desire to mention to the Board ?—No, I came very much unprepared;
I had no intimation about this until 12 o’clock, and our clerk was absent when I went back to the office,
so I was not able to prepare anything for you.
1786. If there is anything else you wish to say that you think it desirable to lay before the Board,
will you send it down in Avriting to the Secretary?—Thank you, I will attend to it.
The toitness withdrew.
1784. The Chairman. —ls there any other gentleman connected Avith the mining interest avlio AA r ishes
to make any remarks to the Board?
1785. No response.
1786. The Chairman. — Does any other AA'itness Avish to give evidence before the Board ?
1787. No response.
, Joseph Edwin Meyers, Esq., sworn and examined.
1788. By the Board. —Where is your address ?—Clunes.
1789. What is your position? —I occupy a dual position; I am hero to-day as Chairman of the
Clunes Water Commissioners and Mayor of the Borough.
1790. Will you state any particulars'that you think it advisable to mention to the Board in your
capacity as Chairman of the Water Commission ?— I may say that, on receipt of the invitation from Mr.
RoAvan, I conA r ened a joint meeting of the Clunes Water Commissioners and the borough council, because
both bodies are strongly impressed Avith the necessity of preventing the introduction of sludge, either into
the storage Avork or into the creek heloAv, and avc thought it Avns better to commit our A r ieAvs to Avriting,
Avliieh avc haAm done, and I Avill read the paper if you please. The first is a resolution adopted at a meeting
of the Water Commission. This resolution Avas moved and seconded, and adopted: —“Thatin A*ieAV of the great
injury Avhich Avould be inflicted upon the residents of Chines by the deposit of silt in the Avater-course, and the
consequent diminution of the supply, and the contamination of the Avater used for drinking and other


purposes, the Commissioners offer tlio strongest opposition to any proposal authorizing the discharge of mine- «
water into that portion of Tullarook Creek under their control.”
1791. Mine-water ?—Mine-water.
1792. Then, before passing to other things, perhaps I had better ask a few questions upon that
matter. Are there any of the mines at present discharging mine-water into Birch’s Creek ?—Yes.
1793. Within your district, or below your jurisdiction?—Both.
1794. Do you consent —have you consented—to the water being delivered in the portion within your
district ?—We have given most, if not all, of the companies notice that ive shall not allow them to discharge
any impure water into the reservoirs or storage works.
1795. At present that Smeatonßeserve is discharging water?—Yes.
1796. Do you object to the water?—We have not offered any opposition to that, because it is pure
at present.
1797. Then there is the Lord Harry—that discharges also above the weir, does not it?—Yes, I think
the Lord Harry discharges above the weir. The Smeaton Reserve Company are pumping constantly a
million gallons per twenty-four hours above the weir. The water is pure, being rock water, and is used for
their boilers; and then the Lord Harry Company send water into the creek by means of a surface drain,
which discharges below the pipe-head.
1798. Below the pipe-head ?—Below the pipe-head. Through this drain becoming choked, it
sometimes overflows, and it goes into the creek above the weir ; this is pure just now. The commis-
sioners are informed that the sludge from this company is sent down to Glen Donald Creek.
1799. Then there is the Berry No. I—that is delivering mine-Avater into the creek. Is that within
your jurisdiction ?—Yes, clearly within our jurisdiction as a Water Commission. The Berry No. 1 Company
have had several bursts of sand and water. The commissioners are informed the water is much discoloured,
and with the sand finds its way into Birch’s Creek below the weir.
1800. It is much discoloured by the sand—that is the official report ?—Yes.
1801. Is that the discolouration we have heard of from witnesses lower down on Birch’s Creek ?
We believe it to be that; and the Beaconsfield—the Beaconsfield Company are pumping 500 gallons per
hour constantly into the creek. The water has been pure, but is now becoming discoloured. The position
of the mine is about a mile and a half above the weir.
1802. Did you hear the evidence that was given about Birch’s Creek by some witnesses, who
appeared to think that some of the mines were at present delivering sludge into Birch’s Creek ?—Yes.
1803. Have you any reason to believe that that is the case ?—I do not think they are delivering
sludge, but those two mines are driving, and the water • becomes discoloured by pipeclay, and that is the
cause.
1804. Is it not the case that the ground is taken up largely from the Smeaton Reserve to the Rocky
Lead ?—Yes.
1805. What arrangements then will be made, or what conditions enforced, by the Commission as to
dealing with the mine-waters from those mines ?—The Commission object strongly to those mines, the
introduction of any impure water from any mines into the creek. With the Rocky Lead, an arrangement
has been entered into, and I will give the particulars of it. The Rocky Lead has an agreement with the
Water Commissioners. They have made arrangements for storing the sludge in dams. It runs from the
dams along the road in a drain into Langdon’s Creek, which discharges into the lagoon. At the present
time, owing possibly to the large extent of the lagoon, about 300 acres, no discolouration perceptible has
taken place. The company deposited a guarantee of £SOO with the Commissioners that no damage to the
water should take place.
1806. The Rocky Lead, then, are storing their sludge ?—Yes, in dams; and from the dams the water
finds its way along the road to the creek.
1807. You get the overflow into the creek ?—Yes, but by the time it reaches the creek after passing
through the lagoon it has been purified, and we find no fault with it. I think that is all that relates to the
Water Commission. Then, as to the Clunes Borough councillors, the views of the borough council are
embodied in this statement, which I shall now read:—
“ The Clunes Borough Council, on behalf of the residents of the municipality, would respectfully beg to impress upon
the members of the Sludge Board that whatever suggestions may be offered, with a view of overcoming the difficulty con-
nected with the disposal of sludge in this district, the Council regards it as being, in the highest degree, essential to the
welfare of the district that the water in Birch’s Creek may be maintained in its present state of purity.
“ In arriving at this conclusion, the Council has been guided mainly by the following reasons:—
“1. Birch’s Creek is now the only remaining pure stream of running water within a great many miles.
“ 2. Its banks are occupied by farmers, who depend upon the creek for water for their domestic use, as well as for the
use of their cattle.
“3. In addition to this, it is, in the dry season, largely availed of by graziers and farmers, who come from long distances
to water their stock and carry home a supply for their domestic use.
“4. At harvest time, it is the source from whence water is supplied for the use of threshing machines.
“5. In its course through the borough, it bounds the Clunes Common for a distance of nearly three miles. On this
Common there are depastured, on an average, 500 head of cattle. A large proportion of these cattle is owned
by poor persons, who depend upon them—either partially or wholly—for their support, and the creek is the
only place available in the Common for the supply of water to the stock.
“ 6. It is the only source of supply to a number of persons who reside on its banks within the borough boundary, and
whose distance from the mains precludes the possibility of their being supplied by the Clunes Water Commis-
sioners. The water discharged into the creek from the weir and pipe-head reservoir is ample, however, to
secure these people a constant and sufficient supply throughout the year.
“ 7. Though of minor importance, it may be mentioned that the creek is fairly well stocked with fish, and during the
summer months is a means of enjoyment to hundreds of the inhabitants.
“ In conclusion, the Council would point out that if any sludge should be permitted to enter the creek it would not only
largely depreciate the value of property abutting on it but would be regarded by the people of the district as a seriou 3
injustice, and a national loss, that a stream so pure and so much prized by the inhabitants should be wantonly destroyed.
“J. E. MEYERS, Mayor,
“ Clunes, 15th October, 1886.” “ WM. HY. HOBSON, Town Clerk.
The Council is very strongly impressed with the necessity of guarding the purity of this stream, because
we are aware that efforts are being made in other directions to deposit sludge or sludge-water in it.
1808. You are aware that a survey—a flying survey—was made by Mr. Allen for a sludge channel
from the Smeaton and Hepburn mines down to Clunes ?—Yes.
1809. And that a scheme was based upon that under the namo of Mr. Gore’s scheme—have you
heard of that ?—Yes.
Sludqe. h


1810. Have the council expressed any opinion as to the propriety or not of adopting such a scheme
—have they taken any action, or advanced auy opinion upon it ?—When the idea was promulgated, the
council at the time gave in their adhesion to the scheme, but there has been a slight alteration in the
constitution of the council since then, and they have not expressed any views at present, but my own
belief is that the majority of the council would still consider that the best method of getting out of the
difficulty.
1811. The council prefer to see the sludge taken further down, and delivered into the Tullaroop or
Deep Creek, below the junction of Birch’s Creek ?—I believe that is the view of the majority of the council,
and perhaps they would be unanimous. I may say, if yon will allow me, that I should like to refer to one
matter, and that is in connexion with our relations to the miners and mine-owners. The impression seems
to prevail amongst those people that this Clunes Council is actuated by a feeling of hostility towards them.
Ineel scarcely say that the council is not influenced by any such unworthy motive at all; the council
sympathizes with those mine-owners in their difficulties in getting rid of the sludge, but, at the same time,
we feel that it is of paramount importance that this creek shall not be interfered with. We feel, also, that
the difficulties which these people are contending with to-day will be our experience in the immediate
future. At the present time, we are putting a series of bores across the country in order to determine the
existence of a large channel of wash-dirt, which Mr. Reginald Murray (and his views are supported by other
authorities) considers to be in the locality, and as soon as the correctness of that theory is demonstrated
there is not the slightest doubt that there will be a number of mines formed to develop the ground, aud that,
I understand, is in the immediate vicinity of Birch's Creek, so that whatever action we take now to prevent
the pollution of the creek by people higher up will be equally necessary in regard to the mines to be formed
in the future.
1812. Has the council, in the past, ever taken any steps, or objected, in their capacity as a council,
to the pollution that has taken place of Creswick Creek ?—Not within my time.
1813. Is Glen Donald Creek within your district?—No.
The ivitness withdrew.

(Taken at Maryborough.)
WEDNESDAY, 20tii OCTOBER, 188 G.
Present:
R. H. Shakespear, Esq., in the Chair;
A. F. Walker, Esq., | R. G. Ford, Esq.
Frederick T. Outtrim sworn and examined.
1814. By the Board. —What are you ?—Secretary to the Shire of Tallarook.
1815. How long have you held that position ?—Twenty-three years.
1816. Can you give me some outline of the boundaries of the shire, what portions are included in
it, and what townships ? —Eddington, Carisbrook, Majorca, and Maryborough, the last three are surrounded
by the shire, but do not form a portion of it.
1817. Are you aware of any injury having been, or at present being caused to agricultural or
grazing lands, or to any of the roads in the shire by operations from mining ?—So far as agricultural or
grazing lands, I cannot say that there has.
1818. No complaint has reached you in your official capacity ?—No, not for that.
1819. Not as to agriculture or grazing ?—No.
1820. As regards the roads ?—Occasionally the council have to call upon the companies to make
good the roads, or to take the slum from the roads, but very seldom.
1821. Can you give any instances ?—ln which they have had to protect their roads against the
slum ?
1822. Yes ?—The Kong Meng and Duke Consols.
1823. Any other ? —Those are the only ones.
1824. In the case of the Kong Meng, what action was taken by the company in consequence of
your complaints ?—Not, perhaps, in consequence of our complaints, but they dammed their slum after they
found it injuring the roads.
1825. Was the effect of their damming the slum satisfactory ?—lt stopped the flow of slum upon
the road; that that was already there remained, of course.
182 G. No further deposit took place on the road ?—No.
1827. As regards the Duke Consols ?—They cut races and avoided it crossing the road.
1828. In those cases have you noticed whether the water that ran away from their sludge dams has
been clear and satisfactory ?—Yes, clear to a very great extent.
1829. The water from the Kong Meng runs into the Sandy Creek ?—Yes.
1830. Does it do any injury there to your knowledge ?—lt silts up the creeks.
1831. Even now ?—Yes, I think so.
1832. Notwithstanding that they are stacking the sludge?—l think so; the water still carries away
fine slum.
1833. And in the case of the Duke Consols, is there any injury to the Bet Bet, into which that
drains ?—I think it silts it up a little still.
1834. Do you know if any injury is caused to the Bet Bet by the mines at Homebush ?—I do not
think so; the waterflow is not into the Bet Bet from the Homebush.


1835. Where is it ?—lnto the Avoca River, at Natte Yallock.
183 G. The sludge dam as constructed by the Kong Meng has answered the purpose, and been satis-
factory, as far as the council is concerned?—l cannot speak very particularly; they have no shire engineer
there now, but I know, from passing over that road, that at one time slum ran over the road, and I know
once that they dammed that up, and it ran over, so I take it it has had an effect.
1837. Do you know the names of the mining companies actually at work in Horaebush ?—The
Working Miners’ United Company, and the New North Homebush Company.
1838. Any other ?—Those are the only two.
1839. Is any injury, as far as you are aware, caused to the Old Alma Creek by the former working,
the Gladstone, the Bismarck, and others ?—They filled the creek up.
1840. Is that injury still increasing ?—No, there are no mining companies there now at work.
1841. Have you taken any action, as a council, with regard to the filling up of the Bet Bet or Alma
Creeks ? —By way of protest ?
1842. Yes ?—No, not as a council.
1843. Outside your position as shire secretary, have you had any complaints made to you with regard
to the iniurious effects of sludge ?—The company of which I was and am legal manager at present were
sued, by a landholder, once for running water or slum across his land through a natural watercourse.
1844. Where was this mine ?—At Homebush —the Working Miners’ Company.
1845. Is that alluvial ?—Yes.
1846. Were the company at that time stacking sludge ?—They were not.
1847. Have they stacked since ?—No, it still runs. I may state that some of the watercourses in
the shire have been very much filled up during the last 20 years by slum, particularly the Deep Creek.
1848. The Deep Creek has been filled up by slum from which district?—From the 'Clunes mines
principally.
i... 1849. Have you any idea how far that filling up oxtends ?—Beyond our shire, and we extend now
as far as Eddington.
1850. And it goes beyond your shire ?—Yes.
1851. Can you give any information as to the rate that that filling lip is taking place, say at
Eddington ?—No, I cannot. I know waterholes that twenty years go were 30 or 40 feet deep are now not
10 feet deep.
1852. Do you know the Loddon near its junction with the Deep Creek ?—Yes.
1853. Is there much coming down there ?—Yes, it is slightly larger and larger each flood that comes
down.
1854. Should you consider that the principal damage in. the Loddon at Eddington is done by the
deposit brought down the Loddon itself, or that brought down the Deep Creek ?—I should think by the
Deep Creek.
1855. I understood you to say that you had had no complaints on the subject of watercourses ?—No
official complaints ; farmers are continually complaining that each flood that comes down washes the silt
further over their flats.
1856. You have had no petition to take the matter in hand as a council ?—No.
1857. And you as a council have not taken it in hand ?—No, the council requested the Royal
Commission on the water question to take evidence on the water question in connexion with that. Some
of the members of the council were under the impression that the floods continually going down would
destroy the weirs on the lower part of the Loddon.
1858. You have had no intimation as to any action taken by the Royal Commission on that subject ?
No.
1859. What was the result of the action taken by the Working Miners’ Company ?—The suit was
compromised
1860. On any special ground ?—We purchased the land that we run the slum through from him.
The Witness withdrew.
A. Lowenstein sworn and examined.
18(51. By the Board. —Where do you reside? —Maryborough.
1862. You are legal manager of several companies?—Yes, and director of a good many companies.
1863. Quartz or alluvial ?—Both quartz and alluvial.
18G4. Can you give the names of those companies ?—I am legal manager of the Golden Stream
Company, at Avoca; the Shaws Reef Company, White Hills, near Maryborough; and a number of others
that are just starting.
1865. You might as well give us the names of those that have been in work but are now worked
out ? —The Carisbrook United Company, at Carisbrook; the Leviathan Reef Company, at Chinaman’s
Flat; and, in former years, the Alma Consols Company, which is entirely worked out, the Queen’s
Company, the Count Bismarck Company ; and I was manager of the Dnke Company for a number
of years.
1866. In those that are worked out, was any attempt made in any of them, .and, if so, which, to
stack the sludge ?—Only in the Carisbrook United Company.
1867. For what length of time were they at work ?—The Alma Consols, Queen, and Count
Bismarck were about five years.
18G8. Those were the companies on the Little Alma Creek ?—Yes; the Timor Creek, they call it.
1869. They did stack the sludge along the banks of the creek? —No, the Carisbrook United did,
but the others never made any attempt. .
1870. None in the Bismarck and the Gladstone?—No, not that I recollect. The Timor Creek, it
appears, had been filled by the individual mining previous to the formation of those companies in the Alma
Creek diggings, and it was considered, the water supply being to some extent injured, that it was hardly
worth while to prevent any more sludge going down the creek.
1871. In the Carisbrook United the sludge was stacked?—To some extent, but very insufficiently.
1872. For what length of time? —Well, the company was at work four years.


1873. That company is not at work any longer ? —No, the machinery is dismantled. It was in the
township of Carisbrook and close to the creek, in the police paddock there.
1874. Upon whom would fall the maintenance of the sludge dam in the Carisbrook United since the
company wound up ?—There is no more work.
1875. Who keeps it in order now ?—The company has given up its lease, and no one undertakes to
keep the sludge.
187 G. Is it on private land ? —No, on Crown lands.
1877. Would it not be a mere matter of time how soon that sludge disappears into the creeks if the
dam is not kept in order ?—lt would.
1878. You have no idea what the cost of maintaining the dam at the time the working was ?—No, I
have not; of course it went into the general expenditure.
1879. Would the cost of maintaining the dams in the district be a very heavy tax, do you suppose,
upon the local bodies if it was left in their hands to maintain ?—I am afraid it would; because, probably,
there would be a number of dams belonging to different companies which would all have to be maintained by
one local body.
1880. In the case of the quartz mines that you were connected with —has there been any attempt at
stacking sludge ?—No, the quartz mine in the White Hill Reef Company was a long way from any water-
course. The tailings were lifted up by a tailing’s pump, and stacked in a heap, and the water ran off
comparatively clear.
1881. Was that stacked on private land ?—No, all Crown lands; in fact, the water was very useful
to gardeners and others, running away pretty clear after the tailings had been stacked. I never heard of
the tailings from that mine having caused any injury to anyone.
1882. You are not aware that the mining operations with which you have been connected have
caused any serious injury ?—Not tho quartz mining.
1883. Was any action threatened or brought against any of the companies with which you were
connected on the question ?—Not any of the companies of which I was legal manager; but it was in some
companies of which I am director —the new Kong Meng, and the Napier Freehold Company joining the
Kong Meng.
1884. The Kong Meng in consequence of complaint stacked their sludge—did they not? —Well they
always stacked it to some extent, but as it was found insufficient they kept making more efficient provision
for stacking it; so that at present, I think, it is as completely retained as it is as possible to do by dams.
The water still flows off milky, but I think the first objection was through overflowing the road.
1885. That action was taken by the shire council ?—No; before the sludge reached this road it went
over some land held under the 42nd clause, and it was the owner of that land who objected in the first place,
and in order to do away with his objection the sludge was stacked, which had the indirect effect of keeping
it off the road as well.
1886. Has he raised any objection since ?—No.
1887. In the case of the Napier—how long have they been at work ?—Puddling about twelve months.
1888. Where were they discharging the water ?—They always had a sludge dam and a race.
1889. Where do they discharge the water to ultimately ?—lnto the McCallum’s Creek. The Sandy
Creek runs into McCallum’s.
1890. Do you know the condition in which the water left the sludge dam of the Napier and went
into the creek ?—Clear.
1891. Why was the action brought against them ?—There was no action taken against the Napier.
There was an action by Mr. Napier against the Kong Meng, and the Napier company never came to an
action. He made claims for damage done by sludge, but we made an arrangement to take land at a certain
rate, and never came to an action.
1892. Did you purchase the land that had been injured ?—We purchased the right to put sludge on
it—not the fee-simple.
1893. Now do you stack that sludge ?—Yes, last week we took another piece of ground, six or seven
acres for that purpose, to enlarge our sludge dam.
1894. Are you working with one sludge dam or more ?—One, but we intend to enlarge it.
1895. You say the water does not run off really clear, but still milky ?—Well, in the Napier, it is as
clear as I have seen coming from any sludge dam; not as clear as crystal.
1896. In any company with which you have been connected, are you aware whether they have
worked with more than one sludge dam ?—No, not more than one.
1897. Do you know the McCallum’s Creek, personally ?—Yes.
1898. And the Sandy Creek?—Yes.
1899. Is either of them much filled up with sludge —to what depth are they filled up about the
junction ?—I do not know how deep those waterholes were previously to their being filled up, but the
creek is entirely filled up. I have often heard Mr. Napier say that the waterholes were 30 feet deep, which
are entirely filled up.
1900. Are there any companies that would be filling up the McCallum’s and Sandy creeks, south of
the Kong Meng ?—No.
1901. Was this due to past works ?—To a great extent. There was the Majorica lead, that was in
the hands of individual miners; all the sludge from their machines went into the Sandy Creek.
1902. Is the deposit from the old mining works being now carried down the McCallum’s Creek ?—No
doubt, but not so much; it seems to settle very hard, and the floods do not clear it out. They may gradually
carry down portions of it, but do not seem to clear the creek as in other places. Chalk’s freehold, adjoining
the Napier, is only a progressive mine; but they are just now making provision for both sludge and water,
and they are leading the water from the sludge dam, so that it will eventually go into the Deep Creek,
although the McCallum’s Creek would be the nearest.
1903. Do you propose to work with more than one dam ? —No, not as long as one is sufficient; they
are on Mr. Chalk’s private property; they have just entered into a contract of £l5O to cut a race into the
Deep Creek, a considerable distance away—l could show it on the map—instead of leading it into the
McCullum’s Creek which is considerably nearer, on account of the McCullum’s Creek being comparatively
free from sand, and the Deep Creek being already spoiled by the action of the Clunes miners,


1904. Have you any idea as manager, roughly, as to what would be the increase of cost in
the working of the Kong Mcng, or the Napier, through stacking the sludge ?—I could not say; it
necessitates, at least, one man all the year round, and sometimes two or three in winter, in cases of rain and
flood to keep the dams in order, continually raising them. They want continually looking after, because,
if a dam breaks away in one little place, it affects the whole dam.
The Witness withdrew.
Adjourned to GarisbrooJc, at Two o’clock.
(Taken at Carisbrook.)
WEDNESDAY, 20th OCTOBER, 1886.
Present:
R. H. Shakespear, Esq., in the Chair;
A. F. Walker, Esq., J R. G. Ford, Esq.
Henry Colley Clarkson sworn and examined.
1905. By the Board. —What is your position? —Town clerk of the borough of Carisbrook.
1906. How long have you held the position ?—Twelve years.
• 1907. Have any complaints been made to the Borough Council at any time on the subject of
injury done by the sludge ?—Yes, many complaints.
1908. What action has been taken by the council at any time on that?—There has been no action
taken by the council lately. Some time ago a petition was got up, by the farmers and others interested,
and steps were taken to try and prevent the sludge. At that time it was considered that the debris of the
minerals, from the crushing plants at Clunes were destroying the creek, more than what the sludge was
doing, and they tried to prevent the crushings from being run into the creek, but they did not succeed,
1909. When you say they attempted to prevent, do you mean they put in a petition or any other
action ?—Put in a petition.
1910. Is that a copy of the petition— \lianding the same to witness ]? —Something similar to this.
I will not swear that is a copy, but it is similar to the petition that was forwarded down.
1911. What date was that, have you any idea how many years ago ?—That was before I was town
clerk, I think Mr. Stewart will be able to say that.
1912. What was the result of the petition, are you aware ?—Nothing.
1913. Have any representations been made by the council at any time to the Minister, independently
of this petition, against the continuance of the sludge nuisance ?—Not since I was town clerk.
1914. How long ago did you say that was ?—Twelve years.
1915. Are you aware, of your own knowledge, whether any injury is at present being caused to
agricultural or grazing lands here ?—Yes, I am.
1916. Would you state the circumstances, please ?—I have been living here 32 years, and some of
the deep waterholes that were in existence then have been completely filled with the sludge. A creek that
required no fencing whatever, in order to keep the cattle in the paddocks, the cattle now, when there is no
flood on, can walk over it without any difficulty whatever; and in several instances the farmers have lost
both cattle and horses in the sludge, by them going down to the creek for water and sliding in with the
sludge and not being able to get out again; in fact, some of them have been completely buried up in the
sludge. Instead of having a permanent supply of water in the summer time, the farmers will have to make
dams in order to supply themselves with the water. If it was not now for the water in the summer .time
used for the working of the claims, the mining water coming down, that the cattle sometimes drink, they
would have to make the dams now.
1917. Do you own any land in the locality ? —Not farming land.
1918. Has the silt brought down from the mining claims had any effect on the floods in the river, to
your knowledge have the floods been worse since the mining operations 30 years ago ?—No, I cannot say
they are.
1919. You spoke of the waterholes, do you know whether, from your own observation, the general
bed of the creek has been raised ?—Yes, tho general bed has been raised. Where the creek was some 4or
5 feet deep only, it has now filled completely level.
1920. Whereabouts is it that the watercourse is completely filled up ?—ln Linton’s land, about two
miles from here, up the McCallum’s Creek, and in Mr. Fricke’s, Mr. Cambridge’s, Mr. Chalk's, Mr.
Stewart’s, and also Mr. Napier’s.
1921. Used there to be fish in this river ?—Plenty.
1922. Are they to be found now ? —Sometimes, in the shallow water.
1923. Of the same class, and same sizes and weights that they used to be ?—I do not know. They
do not seem to be as large as they were.
1924. And in quantity ?—Not so many.
1925. Still, fish do live there ?—Yes, there are fish there still.
1926. Do you notice if the creek becomes clear in the summer ?—Well, the water that runs in the
creek during the summer months now is from the claims. I have known the creek to be stopped altogether
during the summer months, prior to the claims working, but now, what comes from those, there is a little
water running down constantly now.
1927. Do you notice whether the water is discoloured water, or does it become clearer during the
summer than the winter ?—I think it is about the same, except when the flood is on it is more thick.
1928. Opposite the township, in the creek, is the creek losing in its general bed ?—lt is.


1929. Can you say, from your own observation, the silt in the creek is moving down and rising ?
I cannot. When there is a flood, what comes from the sides of the creek washes further down, hut the
sludge that seems to settle in the deep waterholes, and has been lodged in the creek for some time, does not
seem to move, hut any laid on the side gets very dry, and when the flood comes down brings part of it
down with it.
1930. Is what you have said applicable not only to the Deep Creek, hut also to McCallum’s ?—To
the Deep Creek.
1931. Are the circumstances the same with the McCallum’s, or would you alter in any way what
you have said ? —No. As to the fish up the Deep Creek, there are very few to he found now to what there
were. There used to he some very large fish up the Deep Creek.
1932. To what do you attribute that ?—The slum.
1933. Do you mean the discolouration of the water, or there being anything deleterious in the water ?
—Both.
1934. Do you notice any change for the worse at all in the water since the mines about Kingston
have been at work ?—Oh! yes, constantly in the Deep Creek.
1935. You get more slum ?—You get more slum.
193 G. To your knowledge, has the property of the landowners about here been depreciated through
deposits of sludge ?—Yes.
1937. Has the rateable value of the property in the bo"nugh of Carisbrook depreciated ?—lt has.
1938. To what extent —how much per cent., could you say ?—About 11 per cent.
1939. That is, you are unable to rate the laud, the landowners on the creek, within 11 per cent, of
what you could do, if it were not for the injury from sludge ?—Yes.
1940. What do you estimate the rateable value at ?—That refers to some portions of it, Mr. Stewart's
for instance; there is a considerable quantity of that that is useless that used to be valued the same as the
flat lands.
1941. What is your valuation now of Mr. Stewart’s in proportion, that is, how many aicres of his do
you value less ?—I could not say without looking at the book.
1942. Do you estimate your valuation by taking so many acres at a less value, or simply taking
a round sum off the whole property ?—So many acres.
1943. Could you give the numbers of those acres this afternoon ?—I will do so.
1944. Are there any other properties, besides Mr. Stewart’s, on which the valuation also is lessened ?
—The valuation was based formerly on different uncultivated land and on cultivated land; some of the land
previously cultivated on the creek is not cultivated now, and, consequently, it is rated as grazing land, and
some of it not even so much as that.
1945. Is that entirely due to sludge ?—lt is entirely due to sludge, at least that is my reason for
lowering it, and complaints made by the owners.
1946. The reductions are made on your recommendations?—Yes; and on their complaints.
1947. Your recommendation based on an examination into the complaints ?—Yes. I would like to
state also that we had here two breweries, that were in active operation before the silt and minerals came
down from the creek, from the Clunes crushing plant, but they have given up.
1948. Where was the supply of water for domestic purposes for the people of Carisbrook obtained
from ?—From the creek and from wells.
1949. Until how long ago ?—lt has always been that.
1950. And they still obtain water from the creek?—Not from the creek; they cannot use it; and
since the Carisbrook United Company’s claim has been at work, the wells have been tried to such a depth
that the water now is brackish, and people owning the wells had to sink deeper to follow the water down,
and, in consequence, it has become more brackish than it was formerly.
1951. Used the water in the creek when low in the summer time become brackish ?—Not formerly.
1952. Not even at the time when you have known the creek nearly dry ?—No, it was always good
water, and the cattle were always able to be supplied from it, and it could always be used for domestic pur-
poses, in fact Maryborough was at one time supplied from Carisbrook with water.
1953. Now you propose to obtain the water from Maryborough?—We are trying to.
1954. On the ground that the creek is unfit for use?—On the ground that the creek is unfit for use,
and that the wells are also unfit. We depend principally now on rain water for domestic purposes.
The council has gone to the expense of sinking underground tanks and catchiug the water from the roofs
of the town hall, and allowing every one that is without water to fetch water from it.
1955. Where is the drainage of the town of Carisbrook itself discharged to ?—lnto the creek.
1956. What part of the creek, above or below the township ?—Both. There is no drainage except
there is a flood.
1957. Did not that interfere with the purity of the water for domestic purposes for that time ?—I do
not think so. There was never any drainage to the creek from the yards or anything of that kind; it is only
from the gutters in the streets, when there is a flood, that the water escapes to the creek. It is very flat all
round the borough except the low-lying piece of ground by Cambridge's"paddock, that rises to the creek.
1958. So there was no drainage into the creek that would practically hurt the water?—No.
1959. You will kindly obtain that information from your books, and give it about Mr. Stewart’s and
the other properties in which the valuation has been altered ? —I will get it now.
The witness withdrew.
Ambrose Chalk sworn and examined.
1960. By the Board. —Where do you reside ?—Carisbrook.
1961. And your occupation ?—Sheep grazier and farmer.
1962. How many acres of land do you hold ?—Something over 3,000 acres.
1963. Whereabouts is that situated ?—All in the parish of Carisbrook.
1964. Does any portion of that abut upon anv of the creeks affected by sludge ?—Yes, on the
Deep Creek.
1965. What length of your land abuts on the Deep Creek ?—From three miles and a half to four
miles, bcause I have both sides of the creek in places.


1966. What stock do you keep on your land principally ?—Sheep and some cattle and horses.
1967. Where do you water your stock now?—They have got to depend on the creeks for water, I
adjoin two creeks, the McCallum’s and the Deep Creek.
1968. Will you take each of the creeks separately ? —I spoke of the Deep Creek before.
1969. In what way has the flow of sludge down the Deep Creek injuriously affected your land ?
That the flats are all covered up with sludge, and I should think it has put £lOO a year out of my pocket.
1970. By covering the flats with sludge ?—Yes.
1971. What was the land that has been covered with sludge used for—to what purpose did you
apply it ? —Grazing.
1972. Not agriculture ?—No.
1973. In what way does it affect stock so injuriously that you Avould put it down at £lOO ?
Because the grass is all covered —it is the richest part of the land—all covered with sludge, and there is
no grazing on it.
1974. Is that due to periodical floods or the usual yearly rains ?—The sludge coming from the floods
from the rains.
1975. When was the last flood that did that?—A few weeks age.
1976. Merely the ordinary rains, not like the flood of 1870?—No, every year, when there is any
rain at all.
1977. What is the acreage of the land ?—I really could not say, because it is very flat; as you come
to the flats they are covered with sludge; in fact, the creek is turned, in certain portions, out of its natural
course by the debris from Chines.
1978. Has that debris killed vegitation?—lt is covered right up.
1979. Does grass not grow through it ?—No, it is in places 30 feet deep.
1980. What is the least depth that is covered where the injury is done ?—Six to nine inches.
1981. And up to what ?—ln the bends of the creek, over 30 feet.
1982. And over the general run of the land it is what—not the bends ?—Nine inches to five or six
feet.
1983. Then you would have no means of banking it out, and protecting your land ? —Not the
slightest.
1984. Are the trees on the banks of the creeks injured in any way ?—ln some places the red gum
trees are killed, but not generally, not all through.
1985. Why do you specify redgum ?—Because the creek is lined with redgum, it is all redgum.
1986. How long is it since you first knew this Deep Creek ?—I suppose it is 17 or 18 years, or
perhaps more.
1987. Used you to have floods before that ?—Yes.
1988. Would the floods cover your lands to the same depth ?—Yes.
1989. Then would you consider that the filling of the creek has increased the height of the flood—
altered the height of the flood ?—lt may, a little, not a great deal.
1990. Then the objection is more to the quality of the debris brought down in the water ?—Yes, it
is a complete body of sludge and tailings from Clunes, that is where all the mischief has come from.
1991. Are you speaking of the quartz mines, or the alluvial, or both ?—I believe it is the quartz
mines and other sludge together.
1992. The alluvial mines have not been working many years —you had your property before they
were working ?—Yes.
1993. Was injury then done?—No, it has all come from Clunes —that has done the injury on the
Deep Creek.
1994. What effect has that water, as it is now, upon your sheep? —Well, I have not noticed much
material difference to the sheep, because, iu the Avinter time, they get plenty of Avater Avithout the creeks,
if there are any rains, because my land is crab-holey, and they get the A\ r ater; but in the summer they
depend on the creek.
1995. Does it injure them in the summer ?—No, I cannot detect any difference.
1996. Your complaint is as to its flooding over the land and destroying it ?—Yes.
1997. Have you absolute deposits of quartz tailings on your laud?—l believe it is quartz and sand.
I believe it is the tailings from Clunes.
1998. During the dry Aveatlier, does that in any Avay affect the avool ?—lf they get the sand in, but
not much; I do not count that amongst the injuries, it is the loss of the land and the grazing.
1999. Is your land rated at a less rate in consequence of the injury by the sludge ?—No, I occupy it
all myself. It has not been rated at a less rate—not by the valuation of the shire.
2000. If you Avere to sell your property, do you consider that the value AA r ould be less in consequence?
—Well, of course it would.
2001. To Avhat exteut? —I could not say. I reckon it from a grazing point of vieAV fully £lOO a
year. lAvould Avillingly pay £2,000 to have the creek put in the same condition as it Avas before the Clunes
sand came.
2002. You have been speaking entirely of Deep Creek, that is the quartz mining creek?—Yes.
2003. Can you tell us anything of McCallum’s, that is entirely alluvial ?—That has not got so far as
me yet, but it is coming very fast.
2004. You have horses and cattle, I suppose on your property ?—Yes.
2005. Have you ever found any injury to them from the state of the creek ?—No, they run on
McCallum’s Creek.
The witness withdrew.
George Henry Cambridge sworn and examined.
2006. By the Board. —Where is your residence ?—Carisbrook.. <
2007. And your occupation ?—Storekeeper.
2008. You own land here ?—Yes, a little.
2009. What acreage ?—One hundred and forty acres, near the creek.


2010. Where is that situated ?—On the creek.
2011. What length of that land fronts the creek ?—One side of it; the whole of it.
2012. Do you carry stock on it?—Yes.
2013. To what extent ?—Forty head of cattle.
2014. Any sheep? —No.
2015. Has your land suffered from mining operations? —Suffered from the debris coming down the
creek.
2016. In what way ?—Sand accumulated on the land after a flood.
2017. Was the land so covered after a flood used for agriculture or grazing purposes ? —lt was used
for agriculture at one time, but it is not now.
2018. Why?—On account of the sand.
2019. Would the sand deposit kill vegetation? —Yes.
2020. Is that due to its recurring as deposit, or would it of itself kill ?—The recurring.
2021. If the deposition were stopped in the future, would your land then suffer from it ?—I believe
it would for some years.
2022. Ultimately it would recover ?—I think it might.
2023. Do your stock water in the creek ?—At times.
2024. Have you ever found any injury to them ? —Yes, in dry weather.
2025. In what way ?—They will not drink it. I have seen them without water for a day or two,
and they would not drink it.
2026. What have you to do to water your stock under those circumstances ? —I have a dam up at
the back of the paddock, where there is generally a little water.
2027. Has your land been depreciated in value through the debris in the creek ?—I think so.
2028. Can you give any idea to what extent ?—On some high land that they could get £75 a year
for, now I do not think I could get £5O.
2029. Has your rating been in any way altered ?—No.
2030. Did not the inhabitants of Carisbrook one time make a petition on the subject of the abatement
of the nuisance of sludge ?—They did.
2031. How many years ago was that ?—Twelve or fourteen.
2032. Did you sign the petition ?—Yes.
2033. Is that a copy of it —[ handing a paper to the witness] ?—Yes, I believe that is.
2034. To whom was that petition sent ?—To the Minister of Lands.
2035. Was any action taken by the Government on this petition ?—No.
2036. Was any further action taken by the inhabitants ?—I do not think so. The petition was
signed by something like 250 parties, and I think the reply we got was that we had our remedy at law, as
far as I can recollect.
2037. Have you noticed whether the deposit in the creek opposite your land is increasing per year
or not ?—ln some places I believe it is, but in others not.
2038. Have you noticed whether it is moving down the creek ?—Yes, I believe it does.
2039. Do you think that, as more is brought down from up above, so it is being carried down during
the floods ?—Where the water runs shallow, and in a line, as it were, the sludge does not lodge so much;
but in a bend of the creek there it lodges.
2040. It lodges, of course, most in the summer ?—Yes.
2041. And the water becomes very thick ?—Yes.
2042. Then a scour takes place with the winter rains, and carries it right down ?—Yes.
2043. Do you know, from your own personal observation, if much sludge has been carried lower
down—say down to Eddington ? —Yes, all down the creek.
2044. You have been a good many years here ?—Yes.
2045. Do you remember the time when the creek was clear ?—Yes.
2046. Is that deposit that is now banking up the creek on the increase, do you think—the discharge
per year ?—I think it is.
2047. You have no idea at what rate it is increasing per year ?—No, I could not say.
2048. Had you good waterholes on the portion of the creek you know ?—Splendid.
2049. To what depth ?—Twenty to thirty feet.
2050. Have you any left ?—No, they are nearly all filled up.
2051. Used there to be good fishing ?—Grand fishing; I have seen cod-fish 14 lbs. weight.
2052. Are there any fish like that now ?—Oh, no.
2053. To what do you attribute that ? —The debris coming down from Clunes, for after a heavy
rain Ave have seen the fish floating on the surface. You can catch them with your hand.
2054. Do you mean half poisoned ?—Half poisoned.
2055. That would not be the case with merely the washings of the banks of the creeks after clearing
the water ?—No, we never saw that till the sludge came from Clunes.
2056. If the water was merely discoloured, the quartz tailings kept back, and the sludge itself kept
back, and the water discoloured, as it would be, from thoroughly Avell-arranged settling dams, would it be
injurious to your stock, do you think ?—No, I do not think it Avould.
2057. Is there anything else you Avould Avisli to mention ?—Yes. I think this creek being destroyed
has depreciated the value of the property to a considerable extent.
2058. Do you know from your knowledge that it lias done so—you might state any instances ?
I could not give any particular instance, but generally.
2059. The toAvn clerk tells us that there are properties depreciated, and he will give us those ?
Just so.
The witness withdrew.
. Henry Colley Clarkson re-called, further examined.
2060. The Witness. —I see by the books the depreciation in the valuation of property in Carisbrook
is on something like 300 acres altogether. One hundred acres of this belongs to Mr. Charles SteAvart, and
it Avas a complaint made by him that caused me to inspect the land, and I found that it Avas, as he stated,


depreciated, considerably in value, in consequence of the sand and the slum lodging on the land, and that
was reduced about 2s. per acre; and in consequence of* examining that, I found that other places had suffered
similarly, and I deducted from about 300 acres altogether in the borough, some of it Is., some Is. 3d., and
in this case it was 2s.
2061. Could you give the amount of what the reduction would be —the general reduction on the 300
acres ?—The general reduction on the 300 acres would be about £22 a year.
2062. Has this caused any difference in the valuation of the township properties ? —The township
property has depreciated in value in consequence of the supply of water being taken from it more than from
the sludge.
2063. That would then be increased again if the water were introduced from Maryborough, or
any other sufficient supply ?—Yes, through that source it would be.
20G4. You stated to us what the reduction was —25., Is., and Is. 3d. —but you did not inform us
what the original rating was from which that reduction was taken ?—The rates of this land per acre prior
to that on Mr. Stewart’s land were about 4s. 6d. an acre, and on the others 10s. up the McCallutn’s Creek
way —Mr. Napier’s.
2065. Off the 4s. 6d. you have taken amounts ranging up to 2s ?—I take the valuation on Mr.
Stewart’s property now, since that reduction altogether; but I consider that the land that was reduced, the
100 acres belonging to him that was reduced, is not worth more than 2s. a year, if that, if it was properly
valued.
2066. And up the McCallum’s Creek ?—Some of the land there is similar.
2067. You say 10s. some of that ? —Some of it, but it is reduced; there were some appeals against
the valuation on account of land not being so valuable as previously, and it is reduced to ss. 6d.; but that
is not so much through the slum as through the general depreciation of property through the creek being
filled up.
2068. Well that is the same ?—lt is the same, but the land would be worth considerably more now
than what it is if we had never had the slum; the land, at the time it was purchased, when the creek was
in its purity, was worth nearly half as much more than now.
2069. If the slum is prevented coming down, in the course of a few years the debris will be drawn
lower down the Loddon ?—Yes.
2070. Will the valuation of property then, do you think, rise to what it was ?—As I stated in
evidence, there is Mr. Linton, for instance, he has 240 acres there, and I consider his property is depreciated
at least £1 an acre, in consequence of the sludge lodged in the creek ; it will cause a considerable amount
for fencing, which would not have had to be done but for the sludge. The cattle can now cross the creek
without any trouble where a fence was never required, and where they could not have crossed at all.
2071. There will be the loss in the value of the fencing, whatever happens to the creek ?—Yes, I
should think £1 an acre.
The witness withdrew.
Charles Stewart sworn and examined.
2072. By the Board. —What is your address ?—Carisbrook. ,
2073. And your occupation?—l have been farming; lam mostly in sheep grazing now.
2074. How many acres do you hold ?—Two thousand two hundred acres.
2075. Where is it situated ?—On the Deep Creek, here along, not far from Carisbrook, and part of
it further on.
2076. Also on the Deep Creek ?—Yes.
2077. About how many miles frontage do you hold on the Deep Creek ?—Well, to take the turns in
the creek, I might hold three or four miles on the creek.
2078. What stock do you keep ?—I generally keep sheep and cattle, and a few horses.
2079. Where do you water your sheep ?—I have watered them at the creek.
2080. Have you any other means ? —No, I never required much other but the creek.
2081. Have you ever found any injury to your sheep by watering them in the creek ? —Yes, I have
opened them after they died, and have found them closed up; I have actually found stuff in their bladders,
so that they could not pass water through them.
2082. Was that during the summer or winter ?—Mostly the summer time; in the winter months
they do not require water.
2083. Have you ever found injury to your cattle and horses?—Yes, the cattle, I had a lot die last
year. I did not examine them, but the men told me they died from the water—l was away at the time at
New Zealand, and did not chance to see many dead, but they died there in the paddock, and I attribute it
entirely to the water, because there is nothing injurious, that I know of in the paddock, to interfere with
the cattle.
2084. Is there any portion of your land subject to flooding from the creek ? —Yes.
2085. Is the flooding worse now than it used to be ?—Yes.
2086. Does the flood rise higher than it use to do before there was any mining ?—Yes, the creek
has filled to that degree that it is mud to come out with a very little flood coming down.
2087. Have you had any of your laud flooded this winter?—No, not much, very little this winter.
2088. What effect upon your land has the deposit of sludge? —It has a very considerable effect
upon it, because what I could cultivate and get so much use off for years back, if I ploughed it up at the
grazing time, possibly I would get nothing at all now.
2089. If the floods were not to recur) so as not to bring down further deposit on your land, would
your land be injured by ploughing the slum into the black soil ?—Some of it. I could not get down to the
black soil, it would be all sand.
2090. Supposing you had but a foot of sludge passed over your land, would that injure your land so
as to prevent cultivation ?—lt will require additional cultivation to get at the black soil, to turn the bottom
up, to do any good.
2091. Would the sand and sludge mixed by ploughing be inferior for growing purposes to what the
original black soil was ?—I have not acquired that knowledge of it.
Sludqe. i


■ 2092. Dues the land, covered with sludge to a depth not exceeding nine inches or so 1 , recover itself
after a few years, if no more sludge passes over it ?—I have not that experience.
2093. You have a large paddock on which you have had a deposit of sludge ?—Yes.
2094. And it is at present very green, and looks ■well with wild clover ?—Yes.
2095. Will you state in what way the sludge has injured that paddock ?—To this degree, that as
soon as the hot sun comes on it with that sand, it dries it up, aud it goes away to nothing.
209(5. Would the hot sun during the summer have the effect of destroying the vegetation on tho
original soil ?—No, not nearly so much.
2097. Have you noticed whether the sludge coming down the creek has injured the trees on the
creek ?—I own land, seven or eight acres, between here and Cambridge's farm, and I could show you lots
that have died on the other part that you did not see, that have all died through sludge.
2098. Do you attribute that to the ordinary sludge ?—I do not know whether there is arsenic coming
down the creek or that, but they tell me that it does, and in this creek there is an effluvium rises from it
that I have observed did not do so in former times, and I do not know whether it is injurious or not, but I
believe it is.
2099. You say you have cut open sheep that have, as you imagine, died from drinking that water,
and you found sand in the intestines ?—Yes.
2100. Have you ever found sheep dead from drinking that water, as you imagined, without there
being that deposit in the intestines?—No; 1 found them die, but not with that deposit in them.
2101. There is nothing in the effect of the water on your stock to lead you to believe that the water
is poisonous in itself ?—I cannot prove whether it is poisonous or not; it may be one way, and I know that
the stock does not like it, if they could get water any other way.
2102. You knew the creek in the old days, when it was quite clear ?—I know the two creeks since
1847. I have been here 33 years.
2103. Used there to be good fish in the creek ?—Splendid fish and fowls, and - I do not think the
fowls can live upon it—the wild fowls or tame ones. I do not see the tame ducks like to stop on it as they
used to.
2104. Are there fish in it now ?—There are a few; but you might fish a day or two before you got
one.
2105. Have you noticed any effect on the fish after a freshet ?—I have gone down and caught small
ones and big ones with my hand like that—[ illustrating ] —after flood. I suppose it Avas the breaking
away of the great flood from Clunes.
2106. Did the fish seem to be poisoned ?—They were dead, and you could see any amount of
carcases along the creek after a flood dead.
2107. Is your land valued at a less rate now than it used to be?—Yes. I complained to the
valuator about it, that I thought it ivas too high on account of the sludge coming doAvn, and he demurred
a little to taking it doAvn; and I Avas determined to appeal to the Police Magistrate upon it, and shoAvhim it
had depreciated in value, and he then took it down.
2108. Hoav many acres do you consider have been injured by sludge? —lt might be, one Avay and
another, 100 acres in this place, but more further on.
2109. In your total property fronting the creek?—Close on 100 acres.
2110. Hoav much depreciation would you put on those 100 acres ? —lt has depreciated so that I
Avould be frightened to crop it, and some has not been in crop these 24 years.
2111. You mean to say you value your loss at the difference betAveen using the land for agriculture,
and using the laud for grazing ?—lf I could use it for agriculture it Avould pay me more.
2112. Can you give an idea hoiv much more it Avould pay on the average ?—I have had four tons of
stuff to tlie acre; and, if it Avill yield that on the average, 1 knoiv it Avould pay much better tlian grazing
cattle on it.
2113. You cannot say lioav much difference the 100 acres Avould represent in the year ?—No; not
Avithout going into it.
2114. Have you noticed any ill effects from the sand in the creek, not by the drinking, but on the
avool ?— Not very particular, because they do not lie about and stand amongst it ; Ave take them back. If
they Avere alloAved to, it would get into tho avool if they lay amongst it, Avhich they are very apt to do.
2115. Do you notice Avhether there is more material coming down the creek—is the bed of the
creek rising opposite your property, getting filled up ?—Well, it is so filled that it cannot get much more.
It might clear itself a little here and there ; there are a feAv holes that have cleared themselves a little,
and others have filled up.
2116. Can you say, from your oavii observation, Avhether the deposit is Avorking doAvn the creek,
further doAvn ?—lt is Avorking from one place to another, aud it lodges here in different places, according to
the floods, in my opinion ; but I consider directly there is a heavy flood it will put it over the flats
again.
2117. When did the creek opposite your property first appear to be affected by the sludge—ivlien
did you see the sludge first come down?—Of course the diggings Avere in 1854, but that sludge from the
Maryborough mines seemed to have but little effect upon it in 1854; but as soon as they commenced to let
it doAvn from the Clunes mines it Avas then Ave felt the effects, but I could not tell the date.
2118. Can you give an idea of hoiv many years ago it is since this ceased to be a clean creek, and
the sludge commenced to come doivn?—Twenty-four or 25 years ago.
2119. Do you knoAv the creek loiver down, toAvards Eddington?—Yes.
2120. Can you say how long ago it Avas since the creek there, at the junction of the Loddon and the
Deep Creek, avus clear? —Well, there has not been so much going doAvn there, on account of the sludge all
being deposited between here aud there.
2121. When did it first get down there?—l do not think there is half as much down there as there
is hero, but still it is doivn there.
2122. Have you seeu it there lately? —l Avas doAvn, but bcloiv the junction, toAvards Laanecoorie,
and I did not see half nor a quarter so much as avc have here.
2123. You have seen it at Laanecoorie ?—Yes.
2124. Do you remember the time Avhen the river at Laanecoorie Avas quite clean?—Yes.


2125. How long ago was it clean?—Eight or nine years. I could not detect much down there
anyway, not to what it is now.
2126. If yon were to pnt yonr land in the market now, what do yon think would be your actual
loss, your depreciation on the Avhole property, due to the filling up of the river?—At the present time that
is the question. It might fetch more, because with this new mining going on, if the gold deposit is in it, it
might fetch more, but only for mining, not for agricultural purposes.
The witness withdrew.
Michael Linton sworn and examined.
2127. By the Board. —Where do you reside ?—About a mile and a half out of Carisbrook.
2128. On the Deep Creek ?—On the McCallum’s Creek.
2129. Do you farm ?—Yes.
2130. Ilow many acres ?—I have about 434 by the creek.
2131. How much of that is agricultural ?—About 190 acres lam cultivating at present, but the
other was cultivated a short time ago. I generally cultivate each other year, and I have 163 acres that I
keep in grass, and the other I cultivate every other year.
2132. What frontage have you to the creek ?—The ground that fronts the creek is 434 acres.
2133. Is that agricultural or grazing ?—One hundred and sixty-three acres out of that is grazing.
2134. Have you any land on the creek that used to be agricultural land, and would now be agricul-
tural land if it were not for the sludge in the creek ?—No.
2135. You heard the evidence given before by Mr. Stewart and Mr. Cambridge?—Yes.
2136. Is there anything you wish to add to what they have said on the subject of the injury ?
There are certainly little bits of bends where there is a little garden, but nothing that I reckon much harm.
The creek that was about eight feet deep or nine feet is now filled up for about three parts. It goes
through my ground, and the other part has not received as much injury. It is now just about filled up,
and there is about three parts where I had hardly had a post and rail in it, which is now filled up. I have
put the seed in, and fenced in 60 chains where the cattle have crossed the creek.
2137. Are there any mines above your property on McCallum's Creek ?—My ground adjoins Mr.
Napier’s property, and there is slum coming from the Kong Meng into the McCallum's Creek; and I have
lost a large quantity of cattle and horses.
2138. The Kong Meng goes into the Sandy Creek ?—lt goes past Mr. Napier’s house, and my
property is about 400 yards from his.
2139. Is that stuff coming now from the Kong Meng ? —lt is now and again very thick, and I have
had it that the cattle could not get anything but what was very thick.
2140. Is it any better, now that the Kong Meng are stacking their sludge, than it used to be?—Yes,
it is better than it used to be; last summer it was quite thick, and it comes down now aud again very thick.
2141. Do you remember the time that the Kong Meng land sent the sludge across the road ? —I do
not remember the time very well.
2142. Is the water in McCallum’s Creek frequently unfit for stock ? —A few months back it has not
been so bad, but all last summer it was not fit for the cattle to drink.
2143. It has not been so bad lately?—No; it comes down thick now and again. It appears they
back their banks or something.
2144. You cannot say whether it is improved since the Kong Meng stacked their sludge—you are
not certain of the time apparently ?—No, I am not certain of the time, but it has improved since they
stacked their sludge. When it was coming down very bad, I was up at the Kong Meng, and I was com-
plaining about it, and since that it did not go beyond. Mr. Clarkson and Mr. Fricke, my neighbours, were
trying to take another course. When they saw the amount of damage, they thought of taking action.
2145. Are they proposing to take action now ? —No, it is all done away with.
214 G. Do you consider there is no serious ground for complaint at present?—Yes, very great.
2147. What does that lie in at present ?—There are 60 chains, in which there was 8 or 9 feet of
water. Now it has all to be fenced, and lam keeping a large quantity of cattle, and I have lost three or
four horses and several cattle. I lost one mare that cost me £4O.
2148. Is that, being bogged ? —Yes, they get stuck ; it is not like the sand, it is regular pipe-clay
and slum.
2149. And you have to fence it off? —Yes.
2150. What do you estimate the depreciation of your property through having to take this course ?
-—£l per acre, I should think, this ground by the creek.
2151. lloav much is that ?—Four hundred and thirty acres by the creek.
2152. You reckon that 430 acres decreased by £1 per acre?—Yes, even more than 30s. per acre in
value.
2153. Do you mean 430 acres at £1 per acre ?—Yes.
2154. That includes the value of the fence ?—Yes.
2155. Usually is the water in McCallum’s Creek unfit for stock ?—lt has been all adjoining Mr.
Napier’s and my ground, Avhen it has been thick—the Avater has been very thick till a feAv months back;
all last summer it was dreadful.
2156. Independently of the cattle being bogged, do you know of any injury to your cattle through
drinking the Avater ?—Yes. I feel sure the cattle’s stomachs, although I did not open them, Avould be full
of this white pipe-clay.
2157. At times the Avater comes doAvn from the Kong Meng-clear ? —lt comes very passable some-
times—sometimes it breaks over.
2158. But when it is not breaking over, when it comes clear from the Kong Meng, is it fit for stock?
—Yes.
2159. When the company are carefully stacking their sludge, there is no serious injury being done
to the creek at your place ? —lt used to come down last summer continually, it was not fit to drink, but for
sometime back it has been better now.
The witness withdrew.


Francis Stewart sworn and examined.
2160. By the Board. —Where is your property ?—About five miles from here.
2161. What is the nature of it—farming land or grazing ? —Been farming ; very little farming of
late years ; grazing now.
2162. Is there any reason you have not put. it to agricultural uses of late years?—Yos.
2163. What is it? —Sludge.
2164. That has forced you to throw portions of the land into grazing instead of agriculture ?—Yes.
2165. How many acres?—On this portion of the bend about 50 acres.
2166. W'lmt should you estimate your loss on these 50 acres ?—At the very least £lOO a year.
2167. What is the size of your holding ?—The frontage to the creek, do you mean?
2168. The whole of your holding first?—Two thousand and sixty acres.
2169. What length of that fronts the creek ?—One mile straight across.
2170. What quantity of stock do you keep ?—About. 1,000 sheep.
2171. And cattle ? —About 20 a year.
2172. Are portions of your land subject to be flooded? —Yes, all those 50 acres.
2173. Has your land been rated at a different valuation in consequence of the deposit of sludge ?
No, it has not.
2174. What do you estimate is the depreciation of value on your whole property through not having
the same clear water that you used to have ?—That is the actual loss yearly ?
2175. Your selling loss is what I want?—lt might be, at the very least, £1 an acre.
2176. That is due to the depreciation in the quality of the water ?—Yes.
2177. You have heard the evidence given by Mr. Stewart and others, do you agree in what they
say? —Yes.
2178. Have you anything else you wish to say in addition to what they have brought before us ?
No, I merely endorse their remarks.
The witness withdrew. *
Henry Fricke sworn and examined.
2179. By the Board. —Where is your property ?—McCallum’s Creek.
2180. What is the area?—Fifty acres.
2181. How much fronts the creek?—The whole frontage—one side.
2182. How much?—About 15 chains.
2183. What do you apply the land to mostly ?—Agriculture.
2184. Have you suffered in any way from the deposit of sludge?—Yes, I have suffered a good deal
on account of the coming of slush in the creek these five or six years.
2185. In what way has that injured you ?—The cattle have no water in the summer. lam getting
stock in the summer, and after the crop is over, I turn the stock in the stubble.
2186. What arrangements do you make for watering your stock at that time?—We filter the water.
2187. Have you noticed that the water coming down the McCallum’s Creek is better lately ?—lt is
not as bad as it used to be, but it is bad enough ; and that is because the Kong Meng have not water
enough.
2188. Are you aware whether they are stacking their sludge?—Yes.
2189. At the time they did the mischief to the McCallum’s Creek, were they stacking it ?—They have
beeu stacking it all the time, but still it went over. They had too much water and it took the sludge away.
2190. At the times when there was no breaking away at the top of the dam, did the water then
come away sufficiently clear not to be injurious to stock ?—Yes, it was thick enough to be injurious to
stock.
2191. You know the system of stacking there ? —Yes.
.2192. Do you consider that it would be possible to do it carefully enough, giving plenty of settle-
ment to clear the water, so as not to injure stock ?—Certainly, they have proved that in Carisbrook, the
Goldbrook Company, only that used to be a mine that stacked the slush, and the water went off pure and
clear.
2193. That is from your own knowledge ?■ —Yes; but the Kong Meng, when they do not run so much
water the water is clear going through the Sandy Creek before it comes to the McCallum’s.
2194. Then if the mines carefully stack the sludge to the best of their ability, they will not injure
the farming interest ?—I think not.
2195. Do you remember the Goldbrook Company you spoke of ?—Yes.
2196. Do they stack in one or more dams ?—I think two or three.
2197. Running the water from one to the other ? —Yes.
2198. What do you consider the depreciation in your'land, owing to the injury to the water ?—Two
pounds an acre over the whole area —the flats get overrun with sludge first, and take the flood over my
crops, even this winter, and leave dc'bris there; it is just there where the water breaks over my land, and
in the summer time the cattle get stuck in the creek, and we have to drag them ouf.
2199. Is there anything of any special importance you wish to mention? —No.
The witness withdrew.
James Jones sworn and examined.
2200. By the Board. —Where is your property ?—Opposite Mr. Charles Stewart’s, in the borough
of Carisbrook.
2201. On what creek ?—On the Deep Creek.
2202. What is the area of it ? —What I have purchased first; I measured the area of the creek this
morning with my chain, because I had not a map to show you, it is 43 chains along the creek.
2203. To what purpose do you apply it ?—Farming.
2204. What is the total area ?—Fifty-six acres that I complain against the sludge.
2205. Do you say you use your land for agriculture ?—Yes, agriculture.


2206. 11l what way is that land injured by the sludge ?—I had lucerne in it in the flat ground, black
soil that I could cut it three and four times a year, and obtain a crop, now it is nothing only a solid mass —
a sandbank.
2207. What do you do with the land now ?—To tell you the truth, I am going to appeal to the
council not to charge any rates for it, because I cannot make nothing of it.
2208. What do you consider you have lost in the value of those 50 acres ?—I consider, if it is
possible for me to have a look back as it was when I went there in 1855, that I would rather have the
creek back as it was without any damage to my place, than if any one was to give me £3OO for it; I have
gone to the expense of building, and the land cost four guineas an acre, and if the creek was not there, and
a noble creek it was, I would not be there,
2209. How long is it since you bought your property ?—The end of June, 1855.
2210. The creek was quite clear then?—You could seee every stone in the bottom of it.
2211. Have you any cattle ?—Yes.
2212. And sheep ?—No.
2213. What effect has the sludge on the cattle? —If I was to keep those cattle that I have drinking
that water daily, all round the year, they would never live.
2214. Where do you water the cattle ?—I have dams in the bank and elsewhere. Another thing
when the flood comes down in streams there is a stench with it.
2215. When is that; is that the first winter rains, or is that the summer or autumn?—Anytime
when we have the floods to carry down the sand.
2216. There is always the smell?—Of course.
2217. What do you attribute that to ?—Of course, I cannot analyse anything of that sort.
2218. Used there to be that smell years ago before the mining ?—Nothing at all. Another thing,
whdn'we had a flood previous to this, when I was keeping close to the creek as far as the flood would come,
the crop grew there. I could see the different growth in the crop, but now it kills everything.
2219. The slum that used to come down was a benefit?—Yes, to the land.
2220. And what comes down now is not ?—I had three and four acres of lucerne, as good a crop as
ever was in the world, about fifteen years ago when the first nuisance came down. I was not aware of
it for about three weeks. It killed the lucerne to an inch, and it destroyed all what I call the body of my
little farm; and more so there was a sludge petition here about fourteen years ago, and I was appointed by
the committee to go down to Deep Creek to get signatures, and I got over 200 signatures. I was the one
.that collected those.
The witness withdrew.
Archibald McCrabb sworn and examined.
2221. By the Board. —What is ybur occupation?—Grazier.
2222. How many acres do you hold ?—Seven hundred.
2223. Where are they situated?—On the Deep Creek.
2224. Where about ?—Four miles from Carisbrook.
2225. On the north or south ?—The north.
2226. How many head of stock have you ?—Cattle, sheep, and horses.
2227. How many ?—Three hundred sheep, 40 cattle, and some horses.
2228. Whose land is it adjoining ?—Sanson’s Station.
2229. Is it on the old pre-emptive ?—lt joins him.
2230. How far is it north of Mr. Stewart’s ?—Opposite Francis Stewart.
2231. Are you on the west bank of the creek ? —Yes.
2232. To what extent have you suffered by the sludge in the creek —have you suffered with
your stock by it ? Have you lost any stock ?—Yes, I have through their getting stuck in the creek.
2233. Have you had to take any steps in fencing your land in consequence ?—Yes, to fence it every
two or three years in consequence,
2234. What value of fencing have you had to put on in conseqnence of the stock being bogged in the
creek ?—I cannot say.
2235. Do you remember the creek many years ago ? ; —Yes.
2236. How long have you had your holding ? —Two years; my father had it before.
2237. Prior to the mining operations, do you know whether stock were ever bogged in the creek ?
—No.
2238. Then their being bogged in the creek is entirely due to sludge ?—Yes.
2239. What do you consider the value of the depreciation of the property ?—I could not say.
2240. You consider it is depreciated ?—Yes.
2241. Has your rating value been altered in any way by the council ?—No.
2242. You have heard the evidence that has been given by others ?—Yes.
2243. Do you endorse what they say ? —Yes.
2244. Is there anything particularly that they have not said, that you wish to bring before the
Board ?—No, I have nothing fresh.
The vdtness withdrew.
Charles Napier sworn and examined.
2245. By the Board. —Where is your property situated ? —McCallum’s Creek,along the Sandy Creek
—the junction.
2246. What is the area of your holding ?—Six hundred and forty acres.
2247. What is the length of it on the Sandy Creek ?—About 40 chains.
2248. And on the McCallum Creek ?—About 60.'
2249. Have you heard the evidence that has been given us by those residing on McCallum’s Creek f
—Yes.
2250. Do you agree with what they say ?—Yes, I agree with it.


2251. Will you state any special circumstances referriug to your own land that has not been already
brought out in evidence by previous witnesses ?—I did not hear any person make mention of any waterhole
being filled up, so that there was no water for the cattle, in my case it is so. The cattle cannot get to the
creek for water only in very few places with a stony bottom.
2252. What arrangements are you making to water ?—As long as the mines continue to improve
they can get water on those stony places, where they can get a firm footing.
2253. Is McCallum’s Creek unfit for stock ?—Not in the winter time, not as it is running now.
2254. Has it improved since the time that the Kong Meng stacked the sludge ?—Yes, it has
improved within the last six months.
2255. You heard what was said by Mr. Linton, that in his opinion it was quite possible for them to
stack in such a manner as not to cause injury to the farming interest ?—I am satisfied of that.
2256. As to the Sandy Creek, can you inform us whether the Sandy Creek is yet filled ?—Yes, it
is filled up entirely.
2257. From what cause ?—From the New Kong Meng Gold Mining Company allowing their slum
to run away from the mine.
2258. Are there any special reasons that you know of that, what you have said as to special stacking,
should not apply to the New Kong Meng ?—lt is merely neglected; they could do it as well as any other.
2259. Has your land been depreciated by the filling in of the McCallum and Sandy Creeks ?—To
the value of what it will cost to make dams.
2260. What will it cost to make the necessary dams ? —Five hundred pounds.
2261. Have you had cattle bogged in some of the creeks ? —Not to any serious extent. 1 have not
lost any.
22G2. If you had to sell the property, what extent, of depreciation would you anticipate there would
be on the total value, in consequence of the sludge ?—lt would be the extent, I presume, of what it would
cost to make the dams; Ido not think any other. Of course the creek used to be- as a fence from one
paddock to another, now it is not.
The witness ivithdrcw.
Alfred Peacock sworn and examined.
2263. By the Board. —What are you ?—Baker.
2264. What is your official position ?—Mayor of the borough of Carisbrook.
2265. You have heard the evidence given by the town clerk and by several witnesses ?—Yes.
2266. Is there any matter, in addition, you wish to introduce to the Board ?—I have nothing fresh
to introduce. I could endorse what they have said to be correct. I have known the creek for miles up
and down.
2267. You have heard what was said by the town clerk as to the rateable value ? —Yes.
2268. And you agree with that ?—Yes. There is one thing I think has been overlooked by those
giving evidence, that is in the winter time, when we have plenty of rain, the water from those claims is
mixed with the rain water, and that does not injure the cattle ; while in the summer time, when there is
nothing but the water coming down from the claims, it does injure the cattle. It comes down as clear as
gin, but is poisonous, and I have known cattle go and drink it in the heat of summer and die immediately.
2269. Which mine ?—The Kong Meng and the high land up towards Talbot. That is all I wish
to say.
2270. We find, in a great many cases, that, when the water breaks through in the natural water-
courses independently of mining, it becomes brackish ?—Yes.
2271. Is that the case here ?—Yes. In some parts of the creek avc find it so ; where the soil is
black it is salter.
The witness withdrew.
Alfred Coles sworn and examined.
2272. By the Board. —Are you a landowner here ?—I am a property-owner in the town of Carisbrook.
2273. Is your property, do you consider, injured by sludge ?—I consider the property is depreciated
in value by the slumming up of both creeks.
2274. Can you give any instance in proof of that ?—Any one that goes can see the damage done
to the creek, the tailings coming from the Clunes and Creswick in the Deep Creek, and the Kong Meng
and the Napier in the McCallum Creek.
2275. You have heard that the town clerk has informed us that there is a depreciation in the rate-
able value of property? —I think so, materially.
2276. Do you wish to add to that ?—My personal reason for coming forward is that I want to draw
the attention of the Board to the want of water that the town has been driven to through the creeks being
silted up.
2277. We have that in evidence ?—lf this Board could give any assistance; we have been agitating
for water and we are as far off as ever. When the land in former days when it was purchased by the early
settlers at a high value, it was supposed that the creeks would be kept pure for all time, and since that the
creeks have been slummed up and property depreciated, and we have been deprived of our natural water
supply.
2278. You endorse what has been referred to as to the deterioration of the supply of water and the
quality of it to the town of Carisbrook ?—Yes, it has completely destroyed it.
The witness withdrew.
Fi’ederick Fricke sworn and examined.
2279. By the Board. —Where is your property?—l am living in the back block, about half a mile
away from the McCallum Creek.
2280. What is the size of your property ?—About 200 acres.
228 L What do you use it for?—Stock and cultivation.


2282. Where do you at present water your stock ? —At present I have wafer in flic paddock', but in
the dry season I depend upon the McCallum or Deep Creek for water.
2283. You have to depend, during tho summer, on either of those two creeks ?—Yes, for watering
my stock.
2284. Have your stock actually to drink the water out of those creeks?—l have no other.
2285. Has that any injurious effect on the stock ?—I cannot see that it does; but they have no other
water.
2286. Have you lost any stock through watering at those creeks? —Yes; they get bogged, and
cannot get out. lam speaking of the Deep Creek now. I had them bogged in the sand.
2287. And in the McCallum, have you had any bogged ? —No.
2288. Which is the best water ?—The McCallum Creek water at present.
2289. Have you had any stock die from drinking water in the Deep Creek ?—No.
2290. Have you heard the evidence given by the other witnesses ? —Yes.
2291. Do you differ from or endorse it?—l endorse the evidence. The difficulty I complain of is
that in the dry season, in summer time, the stream of water is confined to about three or four feet in width,
and there is no water, unless the waterhole that used to be is filled up; and the cattle, in getting to those
narrow streams, have to go through half-a-dozen yards of sand, and they get bogged, and that is how they
get lost.
2292. To what extent, in money value, do you consider you are a sufferer by the sludge ?—I do not
suffer from it, because I am not on the creek; it is simply that I am deprived of the water.
2293. To what extent of money value are you the sufferer in that way. Would your land, if the
McCallum and Deep creeks were both clear, be worth more than it is now ? —Yes, I believe it would.
2294. How much more ? —I consider my property is depreciated £l an acre.
2295. For how many acres ?—Two hundred. lam one of a good many who live on the back blocks,
and we are dependent on the creek for water.
2296. Have you any wells ?—I have a splendid one; but, through the operation of the mines, I have
not had a bucket of water for four years. I was carting my water for domestic purposes from Maryborough.
Where I am living I am on the bed-rock, and the claims stopping operations has not given the water back,
because I am above water-level.
The ivitncss withdrew.

(Taken at Newstead.)
THURSDAY, 21st OCTOBER, 1886.
Present :
R. 11. Shakesteai:, Esq., in the Chair;
A. F. Walker, Esq., | R. G. Ford, Esq.
James Charles House sworn and examined.
2297. By the Board. —What are you ?—Civil Engineer.
2298. And your place of residence ? —Saudon.
2299. Do you hold any public office?—Secretary, treasurer, and engineer.of the Newstead Shire.
2300. Are you aware of any injury having been caused to agricultural or grazing lands within the
shire?—Yes.
2301. Will you please state them ?—The principal damage is along the Loddon River, and the
course of the Jim Crow Creek. I have been 25 years filling the offices I hold, and when I first came to
live in the district, just immediately west of where we are now, in the river there was a waterhole, I should
think a quarter of a mile long, and 25 to 30 feet deep. That is now entirely filled with sludge, and that
has been the case with all the waterholes up the Loddon. Round on the Jim Crow Creek was good agri-
cultural soil, that is filled with sludge, and from the de'bris the flats are useless to farmers. All the Loddon
flats are covered with four or five feet of sludge. The original soil, which was black and seven feet, you
cannot reach unless you dig down four or five feet.
2302. Has the rateable value of the land within the shire been lessened owing to the sludge
nuisance? —It is lessened to a considerable extent on those farms, but I cannot say it is on the whole,
because, where it is lessened ou one, it is increased on the other.
2303. But, putting the annual increment aside, has the value been affected by the sludge ?—Most
decidedly; I would not give as much for rental now as I would have done some years ago.
2304. Have you had any appeal against the rates ?—Yes.
2305. On the ground of the sludge nuisance ? —Yes.
2306. What was the result of the appeal ? —That the valuation was reduced.
2307. Can you give any idea of the percentage of reduction ? —I think in that case there was a
reduction of 20 per cent.; it may have been more.
2308. Were there any other cases of appeals ?—Not on that ground alone.
2309. What was the name of the owner of the land who appealed on the ground of the sludge ?
David Stewart.
2310. Has any injury been caused to the roads within the shire through the sludge ?—The creeks
have been silted up, and we have to raise bridges through the creeks getting full, and it causes the water
to flow out in flood time more than it would do otherwise, and washes the roads, and, on account of the
river filling, we have had to make a new road between Newstead and Guildford.


2811. On what ground had you to make the road? —On account of the water taking possession of
the road through the bed of the river filling up; the road became a creek, or rather a river.
2312. You spoke of the waterholes having been filled—to what extent do you think has the general
bed of the river been filled, independently of the waterholes ?—I should think about three or four feet.
2313. Do you remember the river prior to this filling up?—l remember it in 1852.
2314. Was there much mining debris at that time coming down ?—No, it was then only alluvial
mining in Forest Creek, it had only started the year previous.
2315. Do you remember the floods in those years ?—I remember the flood in 1865.
231 G. That is long after the mining commenced ?—That is the first flood I have any particular
knowledge of.
2317. At the time of that flood, had any large quantity of silt been brought down by mining
operations ? —The river had filled up by that time.
2318. To what extent then?—Well, the holes were filled considerably, and the bed of the river, I
should think two or three feet.
2319. Then the bed of the river has ifisen from two to three feet more since that date ?—I think so;
that is a matter, not of positive survey, but of conjecture.
2320. Have you noticed whether the floods are worse now than they were in 1865—the latest flood?
—No, we have had no flood since that so large. We had one in 1870 that was not quite so large; but,
perhaps, I might account for that in another way, because the 1865 flood had washed through the embank-
ments in the road at Newstead, and we put in new bridges, consequently there was more water-way, and
the water would not come so high.
2321. Did you put in those bridges on account of the damage done by the floods ? —Yes.
2322. Has any action been taken by the local body to protest against the introduction of so much
sludge into the river ?—No, we did not see what effect it would have at that time.
2323. Do you remember if there were fish in the river?—No, I do not; I never was a fisherman, so
that never interested me.
2324. Do you hold land yourself adjoining the Loddon ?—No.
2325. From your own observation, can you say whether the effect of sludge is injurious to vegetation
or not ?—I think, taking it generally, it is; at any rate, I would rather have the original soil than the
sludge as a farmer.
2326. You are a farmer too ?—Yes.
2327. There is an embankment in some property here belonging to Mr. Marks ?—Yes.
2328. That was put up for the purpose of retaining the land free from sludge ?—Yes, and keeping
the flood-water out.
2329. How many years ago was that constructed ?—I should think about eight or nine years; but I
am not certain on that point.
2330. That bank, however, would have been required to keep flood-waters out, even if there had been
no sludge ?—I think so.
2331. Are you aware whether any action has been taken by any of the residents —you say none has
been taken by the local body —against any mining company?—No, not that I know of; they have exercised
the usual Englishman's privilege of grumbling hard, but I do not think they have gone any further. You
see it is very difficult to take action —you must trace the sludge up to the place, and it is very difficult to
find whose sludge it is.
2332. Is there any other point in connexion with this that you think advisable to bring before
the Board ?—Only, if it is intended to use the River Loddon for irrigation, it is absolutely necessary to
keep the sludge out, or else the weirs to be constructed will only become sludge dams; they are bound to
silt up.
2333. Do you, as a farmer, consider that the water passing down the Loddon, in its present condition,
could be advantageously used for irrigation purposes ?—I would not like to say. The water would be very
useful if you cleared it from too large a deposit of sludge being left.
2334. I mean as it is running now ?—Well, I think not.
2335. You think there is too heavy a deposit of sludge at present to render it really valuable for
irrigation ?—Yes.
The witness withdrew.
' David C. Stewart sworn and examined.
2336. By the Board . —What is your occupation ?—Farmer.
2337. Where is your holding ? —Newstead, both above and below.
2338. On which creek or river ?—The Loddon, and Muckleford.
2339. Which side of’the Loddon do you occupy ?—The east side.
2340. What is the area of your holding ? —About 300 acres.
2341. What do you employ the land for, farming or grazing?—Cultivation and grazing.
2342. What number of acres do you cultivate ? —At present I am only cultivating about ten acres.
2343. Is that near the creek or away from it ?—Away from it.
2344. Is the land along the creek fit for cultivation ?—Well, no, it is not; there are some patches
that are above the level of the effects of the sludge.
2345. I was asking if the land originally was fit. for cultivation?—Originally it was all under
cultivation.
2846. Why is it not under cultivation now ? —lt is sludged too much, and the risk of floods spoiling
the crops prevents us from cultivating.
2317. What do you consider your land is depreciated from your not being fit to use it ?—Fully half
2348. Could you put that into money?—lt was certainly worth £2O per acre, and it is now worth
only half that.
2349. For how much? —One hundred and fifty acres.
2350. Would the sludge, as now deposited, if there was no re-deposit, be injurious to the land? —
Some of it; only some of it that is very sandy and gravelly. There is gravel as well as the fine silt, and,


where that is, it would have to be replaced, and put in the extreme hollows and covered. There are portions
as good as the original soil.
2351. Except the gravelly portion—if you ploughed the other portion with the soil, the land would
recover itself ?—lt would be just as good as it used to be.
2352. Do you find that the deposit of sludge by itself is unfavorable to vegetation ?—The result of
it coming down smothers the crop that may be in, and rots it, destroys it.
2353. The injury then depends on whether the flood comes when the crop is just above the ground?
—From that up till it is cut.
2354. Where do your stock water ?—At the Loddon and the Muckleford Creek.
2355. Have you suffered any injury in watering the stock owing to the sludge ?—No.
2356. The water is not injurious to the stock ?—We cannot say that it is.
2357. What length of land of yours abuts actually on the river ?—lt would have to be a rough
estimate —perhaps a mile and a quarter or a mile and a half.
2358. If there were no sludge, your land abutting on the river would be still subject to inundation
by flood ?—Yes.
2359. To what depth would the flood passover your land?—lt would vary from a few inches to
two or three feet.
2360. Would it be possible for you to bank out the flood ?—lt would.
2361. Do you know of the house at the junction of Jim Crow and the Loddon, where the land is
banked up ?—Yes, Mr. PetersoiTs, I think.
2362. That is banked out, I suppose, for flood purposes?—Yes.
2363. Or is that with a view to keeping back sludge?—The fact is, if the water came over as it
originally did, say 25 to 30 years ago, it would not affect the land, it would do it good.
" 2364. You mean, if it were not for the sludge that banking would not be done ?—No, it would not
be necessary.
2365. Have you ever taken any action to abate the nuisance as regards your own land ?—Action,
how ?
2366. Against any person ?—No.
2367. Have you ever appealed against your rating ?—Yes.
2368. What was the effect of the appeal ?—The effect was the reduction of £2O on the annual value
of 160 odd acres.
2369. Upon what ground did you make that appeal ?—On the general depreciation of the property,
more especially through the flats being made unfit for cultivation.
2370. By what cause?—By the sludge.
2371. Can you give us information as to what you consider your annual loss ?—lt would be very
hard to estimate that; I should say £2OO or £3OO.
2372. What is such land worth for grazing purposes now? —Some of it is worth as much as £1 per
acre, and some, I suppose, 2s. 6. to 3s. an acre.
2373. The land you are speaking of ?—Yes.
2374. What is the average of that ?—The average might be about Bs.
2375. What would that be worth if used for agricultural purposes ?—lt would be worth at least £l.
2376. Have you any idea what would be the cost of banking it along your frontage to keep out the
deposits of sludge ?—No, I could not make an estimate of that—it is a thing that would have to be taken
in hand by all; one doing it here and there would be of no use.
2377. You could not bank out your own land by yourself?—lt could be done, but it would be very
difficult. If all joined together, it would be much less expense; one doing it you would have to twist
about.
2378. About what width back from the river does the flat land extend in your case ?—ln some
cases, 6 or 7 chains, and in some 25 to 30 chains.
2379. Is there any other point you would like to mention —No, only it would be a very good thing
to keep the sludge off; the water has never done any harm; it was clear water at one time, and has never
done any harm.
2380. Have you noticed whether the general bed of the creek in front of your property is rising ?
Yes, the creek is getting lost sight of almost.
2381. It is still rising ?—Yes.
2382. Can you give an idea of what rate per year?—Lately, I think, some has risen about eighteen
inches in the last two years.
2383. Do you notice whether the creek scours during the early flood time?—No.
2384. I want to ascertain whether you, from your personal observation, have noticed whether the
body of silt in the river is moving down ?—No, it seems to be gathering; in fact, up here, the river is now
coming through the centre of our property.
2385. And every year is coming down from up above ?—Yes.
2386. But is the previous deposit washing away ? —No, it is still silting up.
2387. It is dead in front of your place ?—Actually dead.
The witness withdreio.
William Trudgeon sworn and examined.
2388. By the Board. —Where is your holding ?—ln Strangways and Newstead.
2389. Is it situated on any creek or river ? —On the Loddon. ’
2390. Is it east or west of Newstead ?—I hold land north and south; it is east of Newstead, and
north and south of the Loddon.
2391. Both sides of the Loddon ?—Yes.
2392. What is the area of your holding ?—About 300 odd acres.
2393. What is the length of it fronting the creek ?—lt is about something like 50 chains, I think,
fronting the Loddon.
Sludge. k


0394- Will you tell us to what purpose you put the land—for grazing or farming?—A portion
farming »" (l a T P Ol ' tion f azin g-
flow much is farming?—About 100 odd acres, I am cultivating just now.
2396. Does your land, or any portion of it, suffer from the deposition of sludge?—Yes.
2397. In what way ?—Through the debris from the mines coming down by floods, and flowing over
the an 2398. Over what area of land does it flow ?—Something like from 60 to 70 acres.
2399. And about what average depth of deposit do you get ?—I suppose it ranges from seven feet
to two feet; wou l ( l l )e three to four feet average.
2400. When was the last occasion when the land was flooded ?—There was a very small portion of
it flooded last January, and, but for the embankment. I bad run up to keep the floods within that portion,
all the low-lying land would have been spoiled, and the crops spoiled.
2401. What is the height of the embankment? —From five to eight feet in some places.
2402. Have you any idea what the cost of the embankment was? —No, I did it by day labour in
odd times, I did not take any estimate of the cost.
2403. What was the object of constructing this embankment ?—To keep flood-water off, and to
protect the land from the silt brought down by the floods.
2404. Your land would have been Hooded in any case ?—Yes, but not to such an extent. The
usual bed of the Loddon has filled up the height that the banks used to bo in the old times.
2405. About what height is that ?—From five to seven feet.
2400. You would not. have had to bank your land had it not been for the deposit in the river?—No,
because the little water that flowed ovor would have done good instead of injury, but for the deposit from
the mining district.
2407. Have you any land that you have been compelled to throw into grazing instead of agriculture,
on account of the deposit ?—All the land near the Loddon. The embankment I have put up is back one to
three or four chains from the old bed of the river.
2408. And the land between the embankment and the river bank could have been cultivated but for
the sludge?—Yes, down to the river embankment.
2409. What area would that be ?—From 15 to 20 acres.
2410. And what is your actual absolute loss in having to put the land to grazing instead of agricul-
ture ?—I could not say. Perhaps the loss to me actually would be 80s. to £2 per acre, cultivating the land
myself, but where the land is leased to a tenant, the loss might be 15s. per acre.
2411. For the full number of acres ?—Yes.
2412. If your land were sold, would it be depreciated owing to the river having been filled up?—
Undoubtedly.
2413. How much ?—From one-third to one-half.
2414. What would you think would be the value of your land per acre now if you put it. up ?—lt is
hard to say what it would fetch. I would not like to part with it anyhow for less than £25 to £3O an
acre—those river flats.
2415. And you think it would be more than that with the fiats in their natural state ?—Yes, they
are equal to any in the colony in fertility in their natural state.
2416. Do you carry stock on your land ?—Yes.
2417. Where do they water ?—On the Loddon and Mucklefonl.
2418. Have they suffered ?—As far as the cattle are concerned, I do not know that they have ; but
the horses, Ido not allow them to water there. I water them at the Muckleford, or they drink in the
yard. I once lost two valuable horses through the sand accumulating in the stomach.
2419. How do you know it was from that ?—They were opened after they died; and, in fact, before
they died they passed a lot of sand through them.
2420. How long ago was that ?—About two years ago, the last ; and the other the year before that.
2421. Was the water then in the same condition as it is now ? —Pretty much the same. Ido not
know that there was any difference, so far as I can judge.
2422. Do you notice whether the Avater becomes clearer at times on those dates Avhen sluicing
operations are not being carried out at. FryerstoAvn ?—Yes, much clearer. We find on Monday morning the
water really good, Avhen the Avork has been stopped on Sunday, the cattle might drink it ; but in the middle
of the week it is sludge itself, and hardly runs through the river.
2423. What length of experience have you had of the river ?—I have been on it 30 years, and I
have been a permanent resident here 25 years.
2424. There Avere deep Avaterholes then ?—Yes.
2425. Did the river carry much fish ?—I do not knoAV that there was much quantity, but there Avere
good fish.
2426. Does it carry them hoav ?—No, there is not enough Avater for a duck to swim in. You might
run your buggy doAvn.
2427. It becomes dry noAv in the summer ?—Before the Coliban Avater came in, it Avas dry in the
summer for months, sometimes no running stream. No doubt there is water percolating through the sand.
2428. Noav, the Aoav from the Coliban keeps a continual discharge doAvn the stream?—Yes.
2429. Is that discharge a benefit to the farmers ?—I do not Iciioav that it is.
2430. Is it a benefit to you ?—No.
2431. How do you Avater your stock during the summer months Avhen the river is dry ? —A bit of a
hole in the river side—there is ahvays Avater if you sink for it—there is plenty of Avater in the creek if you
sink for it.
2432. Do you notice Avhether the Avater coming doAvn is, on the aA r erage, Avorse hoav since the
Coliban was introduced than it avhs before ?—No, I think there is very little difference; AA r hilo the sluicers
have Avater they make it dirty, and Avhen they have no Avater they could not use it. It keeps a dirty stream
constantly running, instead of being at times dry Avithout Avater.
2433. Have you reason to believe by the effect on stock or the effect on fish that there is anything
bad in the character of the Avater that comes doAvn ?—Well, I do not knoAV that there are any minerals that
injure it, but Avater that is thick AA r ith sand and mud is not fit for stock any more than for human beings;


and as far as fish are concerned, when the water stops running it is like a macadamised road, you could
hardly put a sheep in it; it is beaten hard by the running stream.
2434. If the water were merely discoloured, not carrying a quantity of clay and sand, would you
consider that objectionable for stock ?—No, I would not if it was not thick, a slight discolouration would
not injure it.
2435. Have you, in your long experience on the river; been able to ascertain whether the silting in
the river is being carried down? —No doubt, every flood carries thousands and millions of tons down, which
takes the place of other stuff that is moving.
2430. Have you noticed it is moving actually ?—Yes, in flood time the stream will hardly run, it is
hardly thin enough to run in the creek, and wherever there is a thistle, or a dock, or any obstruction, you
find, left directly behind, a deposit of sand and gravel and rubbish, any slight obstruction to the sludge —
whenever the current of water is checked, this heavy silt settles, but where the water is running on it
takes a portion of it with it, and that carries the lighter stuff down the Loddon
The witness withdrew.
Stephen lieast sworn and examined.
2437. By the Board . —What are you ?—A farmer.
2438. Where is your land situated ?—On the Loddon, at Strang ways.
2439. East or west of Newstead?—A little south of Newstead.
2440. Beyond the junction of the Jim Crow ?—Just this side of that creek.
2441. Have you suffered any injury in your land from the deposit of sludge ? —Yes.
. 2442. In what way ?—Through the Loddon being choked up with the sludge and that.
2443. What area of your land has been flooded by sludge ?—All the lower land has been flooded with
the floods.
2444. How many acres of your land ?—Between 70 and 80 acres.
2445. What do you now do with these 70 or 80 acres of laud ?—I have been cropping most of it
from year to year.
2446. How do you manage to crop if if the deposits of sludge take place over the land ?—Well, I
have to run the risk of flood coming down and taking it away.
2447. Have you ever suffered any loss from running that risk ?—Yes.
2448. You have lost crops ? —Yes ; they have been cut and carried away by the floods.
2449. Are you still cropping that land ?—Yes, most of it.
2450. What do you estimate }'Our loss through the flooding of that land ?—I could hardly say.
2451. If you were to sell, what do you estimate the value of that land, which is subject to be
flooded ; how much per acre? —I should say it was worth £25 to £3O per acre.
2452. What do you consider it would be worth if it. were not subject to be flooded by sludge?—A
bit more.
2453. Can you give an idea of what you would place it at ?—No.
2454. The land would be subject to flood even if there were no mining?—Yes; but the water would
not do any harm.
2455. You have heard the evidence given by other witnesses ?—Yes.
2456. Do you agree with what they have said ?—Yes ; I perfectly agree in what they have said.
2457. Is there anything you wish particularly to add?—No ; Ido not know that there is. There is
not a great current in the Loddon there, it is a kind of a flat part of the country, and the Loddon is still full
enough every year.
2458. When was your land last flooded ? —Last Christmas.
2459. On the average for the last ten years, how often has that land, that you say is subject to
being flooded, been flooded ?—Flooded little or much every two or three years. '
2460. What would you call much, what depth of deposit ?—Some places four or five feet.
2461. That would render the land impossible for agricultural purposes ?—There was not much
sediment left behind.
2462. You mean four or five feet of water ? —Yes.
2463. I meant the sludge?—There is a little sludge left here and there, but not as much as on some
parts of my neighbours.
2464. What is the greatest amount of sludge that you get over a fair amount of fine land ?—Some-
times there are three or four inches to a foot.
2465. Then, when you resume operations, do you plough that in ?—Yes.
2466. Do you find that, with that sludge ploughed in, your land is improved or rendered less capable
of carrying crops ?—Less capable, in some places, where the rough sand comes.
2467. Does the sludge itself, where there is not the gravel, injure the land when it is ploughed in ?
—No; it does not seem to do the ground any injury.
2468. What is the total area of your land ?—About 40 chains on the Loddon.
2469. No; the total area of your whole holding ?—About 140 acres.
The witness withdrew.
William Trudgeon recalled.
2470. By the Board. —ls there any portion of the creek, within your property, that has formed a
new bed for itself ?—Yes, two different places it has formed a new bed for itself.
2471. What has become of the old bed?—lt is filled up with sand and gravel —it is actually higher
than the banks along it ; it forms an island.
2472. What length is that ?—About ten chains, one three, and another about seven chains; but the
creek formed that way is running straighter, it used to run round bends.
The loitness withdrew.


Alexander McPliee sworn and examined.
2473. By the Board. —You are are farmer?—Yes, and grazier.
2474. Where is your land ?—Within a mile of the township, on the Maryborough way, to the west.
247f>. Is it situated on the Loddon ?—Yes, there is 100 acres on the Loddon, subject to floods.
2470. For what use do you put that land ?—I have ceased cultivating it some years ago on account
of the sludge; lam just grazing. I found I could not cultivate with safety on account of the sludge.
2477. llow many years ago is it since you abandoned agriculture ?—Seven or eight years ago. The
last crop I put out, I did uot reap any crop ; it spoiled it completely.
2478. For how many years before that have you used the land for agriculture?—About ten years.
2479. What, do you consider the loss to yourself, per year, in turning this land into grazing instead
of agriculture ?—Something like £4OO a year. If I was to cultivate it, I believe, it would turn out that
much more than by grazing.
2480. How much is the land worth for grazing ?—lt is not worth more than os. an acre for grazing.
2481. What quantity of stock could you keep on 100 acres for grazing ?—One head of cattle, it may
be, to three acres.
2482. That is 83 head of cattle on that 100 acres ?—Yes, if the floods were not so bad; as sometimes
they formed sand-banks in some places where no grass grows.
2483. What would the land be worth for agricultural purposes if not subject to inundation by sludge ?
—£2 per acre I could get for rent.
2484. What is the area of your whole holding ?—Four hundred and eighty acres.
2485. What length of your land fronts the creek? —About three-quarters of a mile.
2486. Hoes your stock water in the creek ?—Yes.
2487. Both cattle and horses ?—No, Ido not allow tho horses. 1 have a creek across the river
where the stock mostly water.
2488. Why do you not allow the horses to water in the river ?—I consider it would be injurious to
drink this thick sludge Avater.
2489. Have you found it injurious to cattle ?—I cannot say I have seen much bad effects on cattle;
in the wiuter time they can get it from almost anywhere, but iu the summer time the Avater is not quite so
thick coming doAvn the river, because only a small body comes from the Coliban.
2490. It clears pretty Avell in the summer ? —Yes.
2491. Do you notice Avhether the water clears at different times of the Aveek ?—During the summer
time, it is clearer the beginning of the AA r eek, Avhen there is no work going on above it sluicing.
2492. Does it clear any time of the Aveek this time of the year ?—No.
241)3. You have heard the evidence of the other Avitnesses, do you agree Avith what they have said ?
—Yes, I consider they have grven evidence very much to the point.
2494. What depth of deposit of sludge occurs on your ground ?—There is a deposit of sludge now
on the average of about three feet, in fact, more, for the old posts I fenced the ground Avith first are hardly
above the surface.
2495. When Avas the last deposit of sludge on your ground ?—January last, the last flood.
2496. What deposit Avas spread over the land then ?—About six inches in parts, and Avliere the
current Avas anyAvay strong it Avashed aAvay a good deal, but where there Avas not much current about six
inches.
2497. Where there is about six inches left, does it carry good grass ?—No grass at all.
2498. Will not the vegetation get through that six inches of sand and gravel ?—No, not in a
season.
2499. Supposing there was no further deposit of sludge, Avould the vegetation get through ?
Eventually it might.
2500. And then Avould the land ultimately, in course of time, resume the condition in Avliich it Avas
before, and become good groAving ground ? —No, not for grain purposes. The original black soil gave better
crops.
2501. To restore it, you Avould have to get the black soil ?—We could not get to the black soil, it
is down three feet.
2502. That is only in places ?—No, all over the ground.
2503. Then your land is permanently injured for agricultural purposes ? —Yes.
The witness withdrew.
William Henry Mulholland sworn and examined.
2504. By the Board. —Where is your land situated ?—On the south side of Jim Ci’oav a d the
Loddon, and some on the Green Gully Creek as Avell.
2505. Hoav many acres of land have you? —At the present time, Avliat I have, with some belonging
to ourselves, altogether 160 acres.
2506. What length of frontage have you on the Loddon ?—Only a feAv chains on a portion of the
ground I have rented.
2507. What length of it fronts the Jim Cioav ?—About 25 chains.
2508. Is it situated immediately at the junction of the Jim CroAv and the Loddon ?—Close by, about
eight chains from that.
2509. Up the Jim Crow ? —Yes.
2510. Is it situated on Avliat Avas the old branch of the Loddon ?—I believe it was that; I am under
the impression that the tAvo originally joined about the land Avliere I am.
2511. What is the character of that land ?—lt has been all under cultivation, but noAv I have it for
grazing purposes.
2512. Why is it no longer used for cultivation?—lt is so much silted up by the Jim CroAv Creek,it
is not Avorth cultivating.
2513. Is the deposit worse down the Jim Crow or the Loddon ? —ln my portion it is worse on the
Jim Crow.


2514. You have noticed the deposit down the Loddon also?—Yes.
2515. Do you find that the deposit in the Jim Crow is more or less than in the Loddon ?—Where
the Loddon comes down, and the Jim Crow joins the Loddon, it stops the Jim Crow from running, and then
the debris is all stopped in the Jim Crow, and it lies thero.
2516. And then overflows the laud?—Yes.
2517. What is the nature of the sludge coming down the Jim Crow —is it the same nature as in the
Loddon ?—I think there is more gravel in the Jim Crow.
2518. Is there more slum in the Jim Crow ? —No, not so much slum as gravel.
2519. Is the Jim Crow much filled up ?—A good deal.
2520. How long is it since you have known the Jim Crow Creek ?—Twenty-five years.
2521. What has been the amount of filling during those 25 years in the Jim Crow ?—I could not
exactly say what it was ; at first it was clear stuff, that Avas before the diggings, but since then it has been
silting up, and filled Avith gravel and the debris from the claims.
2522. Just beloAV the main road to Castlemaine, on that Jim CroAV Creek, the creek occupies a very
considerable Avidth, there are several channels, Avas it originally the same ?—lt Avas. Before the road A\ r as
made, it used to extend across the land I occupy. 1
2523. It used to be flooded during flood time, irrespective of silt brought down from the mines?—
Yes.
2524. What Avas the effect of that flooding on your land —did it injure your land ?—Not at that
time. I Avas not the proprietor then, but I have heard them say so.
2525. You had better restrict yourself entirely to Avhat you knoAV, you did not OAvn the land at that
time ? —No.
2526. What do you estimate your loss in being no longer able to use the land for agriculture ?
I cbiild not say.
2527. Hoav long is it since you first cropped that land ? —About six years, I think.
2528. Used you continually to crop it before that ? No, it is not so long since 1 had the land in my
possession—ten years since I got it first.
2529. Did you crop it for the first four years ? —lt was in grass when 1 got it first; I had it tAvo
years before I put it in crop.
2530. Had it been cropped before you bought it ?—Yes.
2531. Hoav is it, if you could crop it at that time, six years ago, that you are unable to crop it now
—is it that the deposit is getting worse ?—I made a bank at the time, adjoining the road that leads to
Castlemaine, that stopped the Avater coming in over the top of it, and I had it in crop, but since then the
bank has been sAvamped.
2532. By flood down the Jim Crow ? —Yes.
2533. And you have not cared to go to the expense of re-banking it ?—No.
2534. Can you say Avhat the cost of re-erecting the bank Avould be?—No, I cannot say. I employed
men at daily labour at slack time to do the Avork; but Avhat the expense Avas of putting that bank to keep
out the Avater I could not say.
2535. Where do you Avater your stock ?—The; Jim Crow Creek.
253(5. How many cattle? —Twenty head.
2537. Have you found any inconvenience to them from taking the Avater in the Jim Ctoav ?—No ;
they like the Avater at the Avell in the yard better, and the horses Avill not drink the Avater in the creek; they
come back for Avater in the yard.
2538. You liaA'e heard the evidence given by the other Avitnesses ?—Yes.
2539. Do you agree Avith it ?—Yes, nearly all.
2540. Is there any portion you disagree Avith?—l cannot say any portion. But there is one thing,
about four years since I had the contract for making the road from NeAvstead by StrangAvays, and it Avasthe
creek gravel Ave Avere supposed to put on the road, and Ave took hundreds and hundreds of loads and
cleared out the creek.
2541. What creek?—The Jim CroAV. Since then it has filled up as high as it Avas before I cleaned
it out.
2542. lloav much did you take out ? —Three feet.
2543. Was it your operations where there, are to be seen iioav a large heap of gravel and a small tram-
way ?—Yes, that Avas my Avork, and that is all filled up uoav.
2544. For Avhat length in the creek did you take it ?—Doavii along both sides of the bridge.
2545. That is filled up again ?—Yes. There is another things —about Green Gully floods coming
down. I lost land there last January that Avas SAvept aAvay by the flood.
254 G. Where does the Green Gully take its rise?—That I could not say.
2547. Does it rise from any mining district ? —Up toAvards Smeaton, I think.
2548. Is there any mining in the Green Gully ?—There have been some time, but I think there is
not much noAV.
2549. You see you are now introducing the question of injury by natural flood, Avhich has nothing
to do Avith mining at all?—Except that the silt of the Loddon backs up the Green Gully Creek.
2550. And in that Avay you are caused mischief again on your land ?—Yes.
The witness withdrew.
William Cogle SAVorn and examined.
2551. By the Board. —Where is your land ?—Some on the'Muckleford Creek. I have none direct
on the Loddon, but I have Avithin about five chains of the Loddon.
2552. Have you access from your land to the Loddon ?—No.
2553. You do not water your stock in the Loddon ?—No.
2554. Has any of your land suffered from mining operations ?—Yes.
2555. In Avhat Avay ? —Sanded up.
2556. From Avhat river ?—From the Loddon.
2557. What is the area of your holding ?—What [ have rented and what is my OAvn —105 acres.


2558. How ranch of your land is silted np ?—Only twelve acres.
2559. That is flat land on the level of the Loddon ? —Yes.
25G0. It passes over somebody else’s land, and gets into yours ?—Yes; over Mr. Stewart’s land, and
gets into mine.
25G1. What is that land used for that is flooded ?—I cultivated it till it was silted up.
25(52. To what depth ?—Three or four feet over the whole twelve acres.
25(53. It is permanently destroyed ?—Not all of it; there arc patches of it I can cultivate, but the
greater part is destroyed for agriculture.
2564. What do you use it for ? —Grazing.
2565. What do you estimate your loss at through using it for grazing instead of agriculture ?—About
£3 an acre.
250(5. If you were to put your purchased land into the market for sale, to what extent do you
believe it would be depreciated by the loss of those twelve acres for agriculture ?—About £3 an acre on
the twelve.
2567. Are you well acquainted with the Loddon? —I am.
2568. For how many years ? —Twenty-six or 27.
2509. Have you heard the evidence given by others ?—Yes.
2570. Do you agree with that?—l do perfectly.
2571. Is there any other point that occurs to you that has not been mentioned by other witnesses ?
—lt is merely this: That the Loddon, since it has been sanded up and filled up, has found another course—
it comes through Mr. Stewart’s ground, within 30 feet of my own —and formed a new creek entirely in flood
time.
2572. That is not the place mentioned by Mr. Trudgeon ?—No, another place.
2573. To what length?—l should think it comes through Mr. Stewart’s ground about 40 chains.
2574. Is the old bed completely filled up ? —Yes, except in flood times; when a high flood comes,
part goes through the old, and the most through the new.
2575. It forms an ana branch ?—Yes ; it runs now three feet deep in this now bed at the present
time.
The witness withdrew.
David C. Stewart recalled and further examined.
257 G. By the Board. —Has the silting up of the river in your property had any effect in changing
the bed ?—Yes; the old bed has filled up to that extent it has caused a new river altogether to come
through for about 40 chains through our property.
2577. About what width is that new channel ?—About two chains.
2578. Is this loss of your land estimated by you in the depreciation of your property ?—Yes.
2579. You have taken that into consideration ?—Yes.
The witness withdrew.
James Thomas Philpot sworn and examined.
2580. By the Board. —What is your occupation?—A baker.
2581. Are you a landowner ?—Yes; not much area —about seven acres on Campbell’s Creek.
2582. Where about? —In the Newstead shire, above the junction of the Loddon about a mile. It is
at Yapeen.
2583. Which side of Campbell’s Creek are you on ?—I am living on the east, but the land runs
both sides.
2584. You are on the Yapeen side ?—Yes.
2585. How long have you known the creek ? : —I have lived there 18 years, and have known it
much longer ; I have known it from a child—26 years.
2586. Is your land abutting on the creek between the main road and the creek ?—The creek runs
right through it.
2587. In what way have you suffered by the results of mining operations ?—I have suffered greatly
by silting up. It is a large bend of the creek there, and it has silted up from one foot to seven feet. It has
flooded us out ten times.
2588. Is there any watercourse left there at all ?—The present watercourse is changed. The old
watercourse came more up towards Yapeen. The railway
2589. During ordinary rains, such rains as this year, is the creek flooded?—No; there has been no
large flood since last January.
2590. When Avas the last time that land was flooded ?—Last January.
2591. Is it flooded once a year on the average ?—No; hut we have been flooded altogether about,
ten times..
2592. In eighteen years ?—Yes.
2593. Do you remember the creek eighteen years ago ?—Yes.
2594. It was very much silted up then, was it not ?—Yes.
2595. But, in your opinion, has it become worse ? —lt is about five feet more silted than at that time.
I know from a post I put in at that time.
2596. And is it on the increase ?—Yes, every year.
2597. The Coliban water is now coming down from Yapeen ?—Yes.
2598. Is that producing any further effect?—Yes, it is leaving silt all the time, continually leaving
more silt, on account of being in a very large bend of creek.
2599. The little gully that comes down from Yapeen; is that filling?—Yes; that has been the cause
of the silting. There has been so much back waters, both ways, into the Bradfield’s property.
2GOO. Is the material on the move going down the creek?—What is moved one time it fills up the
next time.
2601. Do you notice it is moving ? —Yes.


2602. Although it is filling up, there is still some going away ?—Yes; but more coming down.
2603. Was your land subject to floods when you purchased it eighteen years ago?—Yes, it was very
much silted then, but not so badly as of late years.
2604. What is the dift’ercnceto your own land since then ? —Four feet in one part and seven feet in
auo ther.
2605. What do you use the land for ?—Little paddocks for cultivating and grazing to turn the
horses in.
2606. And fruit ?—Yes, the orchard; a great part of the orchard is spoiled altogether.
2607. It is overrun with silt?—Yes.
2608. Has that injured the trees ?—A great number of trees. The hardy sorts did not die, but all
the tender sorts, the peaches and apricots, withered away through the silt.
2609. What do you estimate your loss on your orchard and fruit trees? —I can hardly say.
2610. You have placed your land in grazing; would it have been fit for agriculture?—No. Iliad
about four acres of lucerne, and the flood in 1870 covered it over—put about eighteen inches on.
2611. That was two years after you purchased it?—Yes.
2612. What was the nature of the soil originally?—Good black soil.
2613. But that was prior to your purchase ?—Yes.
2614. Can you point out the Board in what way, seeing you purchased the piece of land already
silted to several feet and subject to periodical floods—and you purchased knowing this—in what way are
you specially injured by the results of mining ? —Through the injury to the business place through the
silting up of the creek. The back-water comes through now right into the bakery, and 1 have had to build
afresh stable and put it four feet higher than the original stable, and all. our other buildings we have had
to keep them up very much higher.
2615. That is due to the increased quantity of silt in the Campbell’s Creek ?—Yes, each flood
leaves four to six inches.
2616. When was the Coliban introduced down the Yapeen channel ?—About ten years ago, I think.
It lias been worse since the sluicing started.
2617. When did the sluicing commence down the Yapeen ?—We have had no sluicing there at all.
Not sluicing the hills; it is the puddle sluicing that is doing the damage at Yapeen.
2618. With the Coliban water?—Yes, we have a lot come down from Mopoke and the German
Gully. A great deal of silt came down from there, but they are not washing much up that way at the
present time.
2619. Where about is this silt brought into Campbell’s Creek from this sluicing ?—lt comes in at the
junction of Castlemaine and Forest Creek.
2620. You are not speaking of any sluicing about Poverty ? —There is no sluicing about Poverty,
any sluicing was about Yapeen, but I presume there are to be claims let now ; they are fetching the water
across the Donkey Hill, and Blanket Gully are about to be sluiced.
2621. You say it is worse since the Chewton and Barker’s Creek sluicing began ? —Yes, very much
worse indeed. The water was not bad at all for stock or anything before the sluicing was started.
2622. What is the effect of that on the water now —how do you know it to be the sluicing water?—
On account of the muddy state, you can put your hand in, and in a minute it will fill your hand with mud.
2623. And that used not to be ?—Only at flood time.
2624. This is the case when it is not at flood time ?—-Yes, latterly.
2625. Does the water get clear in the creek during the summer months?—No, oxcept on the Sunday
night and Monday morning the water is fit for cattle and horses.
2626. Can you give any estimate of the loss you consider you have suffered, since you purchased,
that you could not have contemplated?—l could not give an estimate—it is a great loss. If we wanted to
sell the business place, we would not get half the value, on account of being subject to be flooded out.
2627. Do you know the Loddon down here ?—Yes.
2628. You have known it for many years ?—Yes.
2629. You have heard what the other Avitnesses say?—Yes.
2630. You confirm Avhat they say ?—Yes, only Jim Crow Creek Avas ten to tAvelve feet deeper above
the junction of the Loddon, at the bridge on the Loddon, than it is uoav. I think this is about the third
channel that has been made there to my knowledge—the channel Avas continually shifting.,
2631. Uoav long is it since this Jim Crow Creek increased so much in the deposit? —When the Jim
CroAV first started to increase its silting Avas about 25 years ago.
2632. From the works at Daylesford and Yandoit?—Yes, the Yandoit Creek silted up more than
the Jim CroAV, till at Clydesdale there Avas the old and new nuggety Avorkings.
2633. And. the Avorkings at Daylesford ?—Yes, they silted up the Jim CroAV abo\ r e that.
2634. Is the silting up at the Jim CroAV Creek still increasing ?—I think so, there are several claims
there that are causing the silting up at the present time ; there is the Grand Junction—all their tailings are
running at the present time into the Jim CroAV Creek.
The witness withdrew.
Adjourned to Castlemaine at 2 o'clock.


(Taken at Castlemaine.)
THURSDAY, 21st OCTOBER, 188 G.
Present:
R. PI. Siiakespeak, Esq., in the Chair ;
A. F. Walker, Esq. | . R. G. Ford, Esq.,
John Marriott sworn and examined.
2635. By the Board. —Where do yon roside ? —At Campbell’s Creek.
263 G. What is your occupation ?—A gardener.
2637. Are you a landowner on the creek ?—Yes.
2638. How many acres? —"Pen, part on the watercourse, and part on the main road, two miles from
the Post-office exactly, from the Castlemaine Post-office.
2639. In what way is your land affected by the results of mining ?—By the immense sluicing there
has been there for four years, and all the tailings and so on have gone into the creek.
2640. Where is that ?—On Seventy-foot. Hill.
2641. Where is that ? —lt is behind the Standard Brewery, on the Campbell’s Creek.
2642. What has been the effect of their operations on the land ?—A very every heavy shower, it
comes through the house and all the lower part of it.
2643. To what extent has any deposit lodged on the land ?—ln 1870, fifteen inches, and we have
had it through four or five times since that.
2644. Have you had any over your land this year ?—No, there has not been sufficient rain for it.
2645. Have you had sufficient rain the last four years ?—Yes, two years ago, the 9th of last
November, we had it through the house again.
2646. How long have you had the land there ?—I bought some as far back as 27 years, some within
seven years and eight years, and so on.
2647. Is the portion bought within the last seven years the portion that is flooded ?—Yes.
2648. Was it flooded prior to your buying it ?—Yes; but you must bear in mind it was all old
paddocks. I have levelled it up since that two feet above the original surface of the land.
2649. There was no sluicing at the time you bought it ?—Yes, on the opposite side of creek.
2650. But on this particular creek that delivers into your land ?—No.
2651. Where is the water for the sluicing obtained from ?—By draining it in the creek.
2652. Not the Coliban water?—No.
2653. Have you noticed whether the bed of Campbell's Creek itself is raised above what it was
when you first entered the land ?—Yes, over four feet on an average.
2654. Raised by sludge by mining operations ?—Yes.
2655. What is the effect of the raising upon your land ?—lt throws all the water through me.
2656. The flood is higher than it used to be ?—Decidedly.
2657. At what rate is the bed of the creek rising do you suppose ?—I cannot form any idea the last
five years. ?
2658. Has it lost at all, the last few years ?—Some places it has, but when the creek has got narrow
it keeps itself clear; but when there is a wide space it does not, because there is room.
2659. Have you noticed of your own personal observation whether the material on the creek is
passing down or has settled there ?—Settled, it does not move.
2660. Simply gathering opposite to you, and does not move down ?—Yes, in fact to make waterway
myself, I blasted 400 yards of rock to let the water away.
2661. Your complaint is that the river bed is so filled up in that way, that it would otherwise not
be ?—Most decidedly.
The witness withdrew.
William Aberdeen sworn and examined.
2662. By the Board. —Where is your land situated ?—Guildford, Yapeon they call it; adjoining the
Honorable William Campbell’s it used to be. lam both sides of Campbell’s Creek, the junction of
Campbell’s Creek and the Loddon.
2663. Do you own the land there?—l owned none of it; it belongs to my children.
2664. You represent those to whom it belongs ?—Yes.
2665. How many acres of land have you ?—About 260 to 270 acres.
2666. Of those 270 acres, what length fronts on the creek ?—I am representing the whole, the lot
of them —that is all I can speak of. I have the plan here.
2667. As to yourself first, I wish to ask questions. What length of the creek fronts your land ?
About 27 to 28 chains.
2668. Is that on the two creeks ? —On the two creeks.
2669. How much on Campbells’s Creek and how much on the Loddon?—lt is all on the Campbell’s
Creek, from the junction of the Hon. W. Campbell’s original 640 acres. I got also land, in 1855, at £4O
per acre.
2670. What length of your land fronts the Loddon ?—I do not go down to the Loddon, Igo down
to the junction of the Campbell’s Creek. Ido not actually front the Loddon; it is Campbell’s Creek.
2671. How long have you known the creek?—From 1851.
2672. What portion of your land is affected by the sludge; how many acres?—About 27 to 28
acres.
2673. What is the effect of the sludge on this 27 acres ?—There is 6 feet 6 inches of sludge on that.
There is a post covered up that shows it; I would like you to see it.


2674. Wliat depth of sludge has been deposited in the bed of Campbell’s Creek since yoii have been
there ?—lt was 22 feet or 23 feet high, and it has risen three or four feet. Yapeen and other gullies coming
into this have destroyed the whole of the property there, ajid every day it is getting worse and worse. I
have spent scores of pounds clearing it out, but it is of no use ; as soon as the flood comes, it is filled up
again.
2675. How many acres of your land is the sludge actually deposited on ?—Over the 27 acres.
2676. To what use did you put it before ? —I got potatoes, pease, and wheat, and I used to grow
vegetables ; and I am ruined, and my house and all is destroyed.
2677. To what use do you put that land now ? —Sometimes a bit of grass comes on when the flood
does not come, and I put cows on it. '
2678. How many cows?—Thirty-eight cows ; but, of course, that will not keep them. It is only a
month or two, and the flood comes down. When the natural creek was there it was right enough, but it is
not now.
2679. What was the value of that land before it was covered with sludge?—l used to get Is. per
pound for pototoes and pease.
2680. How much could you make out of these 27 acres ?—Over £3OO, besides paying wages for two
families I brought up from Melbourne. That was in 1857.
2681. You had fruit trees on this ground ?—Yes.
2682. Are they destroyed now ?—Yes, all.
2683. What do you consider is the value of the land for selling or leasing purposes ?—Nothing at all.
2684. Could you sell the land ?—No.
2685. How much per acre was that laud worth ?—I would not have taken £2OO per acre for it.
». „ 2686. Your complaint then is entirely based, not upon any deterioration in the quality of the water,
but entirely in the fact that the creek has so filled up as to fill your land ?—Yes.
2687. What is the nature of the deposit of sludge that comes on your land—does it kill vegetation ?
—Everything dies. In the summer time it comes white, and is like salt or soda, and kills everything.
2688. Does the creek become clearer in summer time ?—No, never since the Coliban started.
2689. Are you talking of eighteen years ago, when the races were cut ?—I am speaking of now, since
the Coliban started. There are hundreds of men sluicing.
2690. Where ?—All over the whole diggings. There are not so many now, but years ago there
were, but now everything sluicing comes into the creek.
2691. There are a few ?—lt is filled up every time the flood comes down, and there is four feet. I
can get 10,000 big stones on my ground.
2692. When you talk of the large number of men sluicing, are you aware of what the number of
men sluicing the district is ?—There are very few now. lam speaking of years ago, but those that are
sluicing are doing as much mischief as 10,000 men, keeping the stuff back.
2693. Where are the men that do the mischief ?—They are going to start at Donkey Hill. They
have made a new cutting from the Coliban.
2694. Are they working yet ?—No, but as soon as the water is there, 40 or 50 men are waiting to
get the water.
2695. You say so much mischief has been done, where were the sluicers that produced all that
mischief?—All round the whole of the district here, from the top of the place at the back of Donkey Hill
down the Yapeen. You have no idea till you go to see.
2696. Is the sluicing at the present time causing you injury ?—I am sure of it.
2697. Where is that ?—lt would not pay me to look for it. I know the Government takes the money
from the people, and the stuff goes down.
The xvitness withdrew.
Charles Tolstrup sworn and examined.
2698. By the Board. —What public position do you hold ?—Secretary to the Mount Alexander
Shire.
2699. How long have you held the position of secretary ?—Eleven years.
2700. Were you acquainted with the district—did you reside in it prior to that time ?—Yes.
2701. Since when ?—Since 1859.
2702. Are you - aware of any injury having been done to any of the roads within the shire through
the sludge ?—Well, yes, to a very small extent.
2703. Any to the creeks ?—A gradual silting up.
2704. Has any complaint been made to the Government, or to any of the heads of any department
from your shire with regard to injury being done to the river ?—I can scarcely answer that by yes or no.
Complaints have been made of injury done to private property by the creek washing it away. It may
possibly be the result of silting up in certain portions.
2705. Was any action ever taken by the local body to construct any works to alleviate the nuisance
caused by sludge from the mines ?—Repeated efforts were made to get the Government to assist by grant.
2706. Was any grant ever made ?—No.
2707. All the works done on the creek have been done within your shire, or have been done at the
expense of the ratepayers ? —All in that direction, yes.
2708. Do you know of any injury having been caused to the creek or grazing lands on the creek
from your own knowledge ?—No.
2709. Has any complaint ever been made to the local body by owners of land on the creek?—No.
2710. You said that the creeks have been filled up—can you say to what depth Campbell’s Creek
has been filled up within your knowledge ?—No, I could not.
The witness withdrexo.
Philip Phillips sworn and examined.
2711. By the Board. —What is you occupation ?—A miner.
2712. Quartz or alluvial ?—Quartz, chiefly.
Sludge. l


2713. Where do you reside ?—I live at Campbell’s Creek, Main-road.
2714. How many years have you been working in this district?—Ever since 1855.
2715. In Campbell’s Creek ?—Yes, not all the time; but my wife and family have resided here ever
since.
2716. What area of ground do you occupy now ?—Very small, about half an acre of ground.
2717. Will you inform the Board of any particulars you wish to bring before them as to the sludge
question ?—I live between the Main-road and the creek.
2718. Describe exactly tho place?—About two miles from Castlemaine. We are some six or seven
people living on the banks of the creek, between the road and the creek, and we are affected by the floods;
wherever there is an angle of the creek, it throws the stuff that is washed down from the hills by the
sluicers, the opposite side of the creek, and by doing so, the creek is narrowed down so much there is not
sufficient room to carry the quantity of water that comes down the creek when we have heavy floods.
2719. What is the result on the adjoining properties ?—The result has been this, that I think the
land has been sold for £9s‘an acre, and the private property has been washed away on account of the filling
up on the opposite side. I have lost two panels, which carried away 17 feet of my ground, on account of
the creek being filled up.
2720. Of your ground—do you own land on the creek ?—My property between the main road and
the creek, the back part of my property is washed away.
2721. What is the area of your property ?—Well I have somewhere about over a quarter of an acre
where my house is built.
2722. And part of that is washed away ? —Yes.
2723. And the fencing washed away ?—Yes.
2724. When did that occur ?—lt has occurred on several occasions—nearly every heavy flood.
2725. When was the last flood that carried away the fencing ?—The last flood there carried away
some fruit trees, and eight or nine feet of ground.
2726. When was that ?—Three or four months ago.
2727. Is that within this year ?—Yes.
2728. The rains of last August—perhaps you talk of last winter ?—I could not tell the date.
2729. Prior to that, when was your land last injured ?—The land has been washed away every time
we havo a large flood of water.
2730. Once a year?—No, not every year. We have not heavy floods every year, but we have it
occasionally—l think we have had it two years previously that we had no heavy floods.
2731. Do you describe the rains that occurred about two months and a half ago a heavy flood ?—Yes.
2732. The Board were there at the time, and saw tho rain—you describe that as a heavy flood ?—Yes.
2733. What were you using the land for ?—A garden.
2734. Have you re-fenced it ?—No, I have not, since the last ground was washed away.
2735. Is it left open ?—Of course it must be left open if there is no fence there.
2736. It is left open ?—Yes.
2737. What do you do with the land if a portion is left open?—l have fruit trees in it and various
other things.
2738. What do you regard as the value of the land now ?—I do not know as to the value of the
land; it is not worth much. Had it not been for my house, I would not troxible anybody with it.
2739. Is there any deposit of sludge or silt in the land itself ?—No.
2740. The land could not be worth much if you do not find it worth while to protect it ?—No, I have
made every effort to protect it, and I am not able to do so.
2741. How long do you say it is since you had this property ?—Well, I think I bought the property
in 1861.
2742. Was there much silt there ?—No.
2743. Were you ever flooded out then ? —No.
2744. Floods had not, to your knowledge, been over the ground prior to that time ?—Not over the
ground at that time, because we had not so much stuff narroAving down the creek; there was more water-
way.
2745. Your complaint is that the water channel has been so filled up that the floods are extended,
and turned on to your land—is that what we are to understand ? —No, not exactly; the creek where lam is
as deep as it has ever been; if you understand me, at every turn in the creek, heavy floods throw the stuff
washed down from the hills by the sluicers to the opposite side, and that narrows down the creek, so we
have not waterway.
2746. Do you say the creek is as deep as it was when you first came there ?—Behind my place it is.
2747. Silt is not lodging at that place?—No, because the greater part of the creek is in my ground,
and the opposite side, where used to be the creek, is all filled up.
2748. The creek has altered its channel ?—Yes.
’The witness withdrew.
George Godfree sworn and examined.
2749. By the Board. —What are you ?—A storekeeper.
2750. Where is your farm situated ?—Four miles and a half from Castlemaine, at Yapeen.
2751. On which side of the creek is your land situated ?—On the eastern side of the creek.
2752. What is the area of your farm ?—About 100 acres.
2753. What length of it fronts the creek ?—None, it fronts the road.
2754. What distance is the nearest portion of your farm from the creek ?—Fifty to 60 yards.
2755. What is between you and the creek ?—The road and a small area of diggings.
2756. Will you describe in what way your land is injured by the mining ?—lt is injured by it in this
way. When the creek rises, the back-water brings a lot of sand and silt, and deposits it on the land; the
creek runs alongside of the road.
2757. What do you mean by the back-water ?—lt is not the main stream—the creek rises and
overflows the land.


2758. To what depth does it flood your laud ?—As much as four feet in some places.
2759. Does it carry any deposit on to your land ? —Yes, the silt.
2760. What depth of silt ?—Three and four feet in places.
2761. Of silt?—Yes, the black soil is completely covered, buried beyond the plough.
2762. How many years ago is it since you purchased this land ?—Twenty-two or 23 years. I
purchased from Mr. Taylor, the squatter.
2763. Was it subject to floods then ?—No.
2764. Was the black soil visible ?—Yes, for many years afterwards.
2765. Did you use it for agriculture?—Yes.
2766. To what purpose do you turn it now ? —Agriculture.
2767. Now ?—Well, the part that is flooded, I have grass seed sown on it.
2768. What area of land is so flooded that you sow seed on it, and have abandoned agriculture ?
About three acres.
2769. How long ago is it since you cropped that three acres ?—The year before last, and I have
sown grass since then.
2770. What is the deposit of actual silt on those three acres ?—ln some parts there is four feet, in
others, not more than two or three inches. We have ploughed it year after year, so as to mix the silt with
the soil.
2771. Three or four feet are only in depressions or holes?—The nearer the creek, the greater the
depression.
2772. What is the deposit over the average quantity of ground ?—Not more than a foot.
-2773. You plough that foot in with the black soil ?—We have done that year after year, sometimes
there has been three or four inches one year, the same another.
2774. What effect has that had on the crops ?—lt has produced sorrel.
2775. A poorer crop than on the original black soil ?—Yes.
2776. What is the difference in the value of the land, as agricultural land, these three acres to what
it used to be?—l do not know. I gave £25 per acre for it nineteen years ago; I would not get that much
for it now.
2777. You consider your whole property is deteriorated by the filling up of the creek ?—That is not
the only cause, there is a sludge gutter comes through my ground, and when the creek rises it prevents the
outflow of that, so that, on the whole the debris that comes down from the gully stops for 200 or 300 yards
up the paddock. It comes from Donkey Gully.
2778. Through Yapeen ?—No; about a mile on the Castlemaine side of Yapeen, and partly what
brought me in is, they propose sluicing the gullies above me, which would totally destroy my property.
2779. Are they yet ?—No.
2780. Have they got the races complete ? —They are being cut.
2781. And if the sluicing water is sent down, and a flood occurs on the Campbell’s Creek, the
sluicing waters Avould be backed on to your property ?—Every year it is getting worse.
2782. It is backed because of the bed of Campbell’s Creek getting too shallow ?—Yes.
2783. You have heard the last witness say the bed of the creek is as deep as ever lie knew it ?—I
do not know where. When I first bought the land Taylor's station was just opposite, and the creek, for
half a mile fully was 30 or 40 feet deep, and for many years after I lived there.
2784. Do you find that the creek is steadily rising ?—The creek is steadily rising, inasmuch as the
Newstead Shire Council, about three years ago spent £25 to alter the culvert, so as to give it more of a
sweep, so that the sludge will get away better into the creek. Since then it has cleared itself a little better
than it did before.
2785. What are the works going on in Donkey Gully now, that send down silt ?—lt is the remains
from old puddling machines.
2786. Not existing works? —No, but when every flood comes, the Chinamen make an improptu
ground sluice, and throw this into the stream.
2787. That is the sludge channel you are speaking of ?—Originally it was not—when I bought the
land it was not. The water used to flow all over the land, but when 1 commenced to plough, I had to form
the drain, and since then the water fretting away has made a very large one.
2788. You are afraid that, if sluicing from the Coliban water were introduced on a scale of any
magnitude, the evil would be vero much greater on your land ? —I am positive of it.
2789. Can you suggest any way by which your land can be saved ? —Not if tliey sluice above me,
with the sluicing from Cliewton is only a question of time when we shall have all to leave the flats.
2790. In your land can you bank out the water ? —From the Cliewton I could, but not from the
Donkey Gully if they sluice that.
2791. Your land is where ?—At the foot of Donkey Gully.
2792. Do you own land on both sides of the channel from there ?—Yes.
2793. So you could not bank out the water that comes down there? —It would destroy eight acres
of the very best land I have the first year.
2794. What do you consider your loss per year now is, owing to the filling up of the river ?—About
a man’s work two or three weeks in the year to keep it cleaned out.
2795. And if the sluicing were carried out you consider that eight acres of the land would be
destroyed ?—Totally destroyed.
2796. What do you consider is the value of those eight acres ?-«—They are worth £4O per acre.
2797. Have you any experience whether, provided the deposit does not move, the land recovers itself
so as to be fit for vegetation ?—To do so, I purchased a sub-soil plough about two years ago, and we have
fetched up the sub-soil, and it is all mixed with it, and since then I have had better crops than before.
2798. I suppose the deposit of sludge is so thick that you cannot reach the sub-soil by the sub-soil
plough. Can you grow anything ?—Very little.
2799. Is it good for grass ?—The further from the stream, of course, the less harm it does. For
instance, I know in one case of a neighbour of mine, Mr. Fox, his land is improved by it. He can grow
potatoes where he could never before. He got just the top of the water, the manure part.


2800. Have you cognizance of any other lands fronting the Loddon that have been injured ?
Hundreds of acres are down there.
2801. Where are the lands situated ?—ln Kennedy’s flat; but more particularly, I was going to say,
that recently, just last year, the Government subsidized the council to the extent of £1,600, to remove the
road from the flat on the roadside, in consequence of the Loddon being silted up.
2802. You were a member of the council at that time ?—Yes, I was, until last August.
2803. Have you ever had to raise any bridges in consequence of the creeks ?—Yes, one that was
raised, that cost nearly £2,000, was at the foot of Strangways.
2804. Have you raised one across the Jim Crow Creek ?—Yes, that is the one.
2805. How much did that cost ?—Something under £2,000.
2806. How high had you to raise it ? —I do not remember.
2807. Were you acquainted with the Jim Crow Creek some time previously ?—Yes.
2808. How deep was the deposit of silt in that creek ?—I should think, at the present time, fifteen
feet—l nearly lost a horse there three months ago.
2809. What should you consider the value of the flat lands on the Loddon, such as could be affected
by the floods ?—Fifty pounds per acre.
2810. What do you consider the value of those now subject to the deposit that comes down ?—Half
of that, except in a few places where the sludge has entirely destroyed the land.
■ 2811. It is the recurring deposit that does so much mischief ?—Yes, the more material left on the
more damage is done.
2812. Did the council receive applications from farmers in that district as to abatement of the
nuisance ?—I do not think so.
2813. Did the council ever make any abatement in their valuations on account of it?—Yes, I think
so—the land, when it was cultivated, used to be charged Is. per acre per annum, but since then the valua-
tion has been reckoned about 10s. per year—half that sum.
2814. Of your own knowledge, are you aware whether much land has gone out of cultivation and
into grazing on account of the deposit of sludge ?—Just about where I live there is very little, because it
is all old diggings, but further down the Loddon there is a great deal. I could not say exactly, but some
hundreds of acres of the best land in the Loddon.
The Witness withdrew.
Angus Cornish sworn and examined.
2815. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—Borough surveyor and rate-collector.
2816. How long have you held that position ? —Over twenty years.
2817. Of what borough? —Castlemaine.
2818. Are you aware of any injury having been done to any of the roads within the limits of the
borough through sludge ?—Yes, Forest Creek road is frequently scoured with it.
2819. What part of that road ?—Above the telegraph bridge, east of the telegraph bridge.
2820. Does the sludge flow over the road ?—Yes.
2821. To what depth?—lt has been two or three feet over the centre of the road often.
2822. When was the last flood over that road ?—Twelve months ago.
2823. Can you recollect when you first knew a flood passing over that road ? —Many years ago.
2824. At the time you took office were floods occasionally passing over that road ?—Yes, but very
seldom, only an extraordinarily high flood. I knew roads there 30 years ago.
2825. Do you consider the roads are worse owing to getting silted?—Yes, the channels of the
creeks are filled up, so that the water goes over the road.
2826. Which do you allude to—Wattle Gully ?—No, not so far as that; up McGrath-street there is
a creek.
2827. To what cause do you attribute the filling up ?—The sluicing operations.
2828. Where was the sluicing conducted ?—Further up, east of that—Little Bendigo.
2829. What holes or gullies were they sluicing ?—All along Little Bendigo; and they are sluicing
now in Montgomery Hill, and east of that along the back of Chewton.
2830. To what extent has Forest Creek filled up within the last ten years?—Many feet.
2831. Is it still filling up ?—Yes.
2832. What is causing it to fill up now, seeing there is no sluicing going on ?—There is sluicing
going on at Chewton, which goes into the Forest Creek.
2833. Very little ? —A good deal, and the rough metal remains in the Forest Creek, and the light
stuff washes further down the creek with the ordinary creek water.
2834. Is the filling up due to the old workings of Golden Gully ?—No.
2835. To the new works ?—Yes.
2836. To any crushing works on Forest Creek ?—No crushing; we never suffered from that.
2837. Is the creek filling up much owing to the crushing in Wattle Gully ?—The sluicing, but not
from the crushing.
2838. Not from the tailings from the battery ?—No, they wash away anything that is letdown; an
ordinary flood takes the light tailings away.
2839. Down to Campbell's Creek ?—Yes.
2840. By the sluicing it does not ?—No, it leaves the heavy matter.
2841. You are speaking of the tailings of the sluicings, but the slum is carried down ?—lt goes
further down the creek in any ordinary creek.
2842. The coarse tailings cause the filling up?—Yes. When the council has to pick it out, it is as
hard as road metal.
2843. Has any action been taken against any of the companies or mines producing any of the mis-
chief ?—The council lias given notice to some of the sluicers to have the culverts cleared out.
2844. Have you called upon the sluicers to stack the sludge ?—We have tried it. We gave a man
at Ivenson notice to stack the sludge going into Campbell’s Croeek there, to prevent the culvert silting up.


2845. How many men was lie employing in sluicing ?—Four or five.
2846. Was it ground or box sluicing ?—Partly both.
2847. Where did lie obtain his water for sluicing ?—From the Golden Point Reservoir.
2848. From the Coliban, you mean? —The Coliban.
2849. What was the result of his endeavours to stack the sludge ?—lt is a hard job to get them to
do it. He got a horse and cart, and took a bit of it away.
2850. Ho carted the tailings away?—Yes.
2851. Did he make any sludge dam to keep the slum back ?—A little, after being threatened to bo
summoned, he shovelled them up to one side.
2852. The action taken by the local body was to compel him to remove the tailings that were
choking the culvert—it was not a question of the sludge or slum ?—No.
2858. No other action has been taken by the council ?—ln Campbell’s Creek, where the creek has
washed away private property, the council has improved the place, and turned the creek in different places.
2854. Have you ever had to lift or alter the levels of any bridge ?—Yes; Maloney’s Bridge, at
Campbell’s Creek, was raised some feet.
2855. Was that due to the silting by the creek ?—Yes.
2856. How much of that was due to natural causes ?—I believe the chief was the sluicing. At this
place there used to be a very good fall, and they got silted by the heavier tailings.
2857. Do the tailings carry any distance down the creek ?—Not very far past our borough.
2858. Where is the limit of your borough ?—Campbell’s Creek, near where the old John-o’-Groats
used to be.
.. 2859. That is Campbell’s Creek township, do you mean ?—This side of the Standard, about half a
mile.
2860. Was any action taken as to the sluicing from Montgomery Hill ?—We have, on different
occasions, drawn their attention to the necessity of stacking them up there, to bank up the rough tailings.
2861. And the tailings were stacked?—ln some places.
2862. But the slum was allowed to run free ? —Yes.
2863. They have never been called upon to stack the slum ?—No.
2864. Do you consider that the sluicing is likely to be on the increase, or do you consider that the
ground is pretty well worked out ?—I think in this neighbourhood it is nearly worked out.
2865. You do not anticipate any increase ? —I think not.
The witness withdrew.
Hannibal 0. Rowe sworn and examined.
2866. By the Board. —What is your official position ?—Chairman of the Castlemaine Mining Board.
2867. Are there any points connected with the silting up of the creeks or rivers, or connected with
injury said to have been sustained through mining operations, on which you would like to make any remark to
the Board ?—I have nothing particular to say. My appearance here is in consequence of receiving, I pre-
sume, a letter from you, requesting my attendance. In consequence of that, I attended here to answer any
questions which you might think fit to ask me in relation to this matter.
2868. You have heard the evidence that has been given; do you agree with that evidence, or are
there any points you would like to offer any other evidence on ?—I cannot say that I could endorse the
whole of it.
2869. In what points do you differ ?—I think it has been stated that this silt or debris does not move
onward with the current. lam quite opposed to that; I say, from a very great experience, that it does.
2870. You consider that it ultimately moves forward, until it gets into the larger rivers ?—There is
not a doubt about it.
2871. In yo n r position as Chairman of the Mining Board, is there any matter that the Board, through
you as their representative, would wish to state to this Board of Inquiry ?—I am not aware that there is;
I am not instructed to that effect.
2872. In your private capacity, you have for many years had claims in Fryerstown, have you not ?
—Yes.
2873. Situated on the Fryer’s Creek ?—Yes.
2874. At one time there was an attempt to stack the tailings in Fryer’s Creek, was there not ?
Yes.
2875. And dams were made across the creek, withholding the tailings; was not that the case below
the Anglo-Australian and the Era ? —Yes.
2876. Are those dams in existence at present ?—I believe there are large stacks of tailings that are
now to be seen along Fryer’s Creek, that have been stacked—hundreds of thousands of tons.
2877 .But the main dams have been washed away; the stream has re-asserted itself ?—A great many
of them.
2878. Will not the balance of those tailings, unless protected, ultimately, to use your own opinion,
find their way down the creek ?—ln the course of ages, some of them might.
2879. Can you suggest any means by which banks of tailings once formed can be protected after the
companies which formed them have ceased to exist ?—I think, in a great measure, many of those stacks of
tailings that have been banked up, away from a watercourse, will not in any material way interfere with the
watercourses afterwards.
2880. But, as a fact, were not those banks in the Fryer’s Cfeek constructed actually across the water-
courses ? —Some of them were, for the purpose of dams, and in other places the watercourse was altered so
ns to pass clear from them.
2881. Side drains—storm-water channels were cut on the side ?—Yes.
2882. Can you, with your knowledge as a member of the Mining Board, suggest any means by which
the banks can be protected after the company has ceased to exist; can you suggest any remedy, or say who
should undertake the cost; should it be the Mining Board, or the local board, or the Government ?—I think
the Government, having received the whole of the fees for leases of mining generally, should undertake the
protection of those things through one of their departments.


2883. Should undertake the protection of dams, the works of which are abandoned ?—Decidedly so.
2884. Wliat should you estimate the cost then of maintaining the.dams in ordinary cases ?—lt would
not be very oxtensive; but, as I only received your kind request to attend here to-day, I have not gone
extensively into that question.
2885. What would be the annual cost of maintaining the stacks of tailings in the Fryer’s Creek,
from the Anglo-Australian, below the Duke of Cornwall; supposing that were to be undertaken by a cor-
porate or Government body, Avould it take one man to attend to the whole lot ?—I daresay it would.
2886. That would be sufficient, you think ?—I should think so. Of course, if I might be permitted,
I might say that it is not, as a rule, from quartz mining, that the damage is done to property at all; it is
done from the heavier debris, such as the heavy wash from sluicing, and the stuff that is carried by the
occasional floods from the broken-up tailings into the main water channels. I speak of the district in which
I reside.
2887. You mean, in Fryer’s Creek, the mischief is not done by the quartz mining ? —Yes, of course,
the lighter debris will flow further on into the big rivers and larger watercourses, while the heavier stops
behind, and some damage may be done to lands bordering on those rivers; no doubt there would be, in case
of heavy floods.
The witness withdrew.
James Elsdon sworn and examined.
2888. By the Board. —What position do you bold ?—lnspector of Works, Water Supply Department.
2889. How long have you held that office ?—Over nineteen years.
2890. What district is under your control ?—Castlemaine. I have been here four years and a half,
only here, the balance of the time in another district.
2891. Were you in charge of the district when that water was first introduced from the Coliban for
sluicing purposes ?—No.
2892. Has the quantity of water applied for, for sluicing purposes, increased during your tenure of
office ? —Yes.
2893. Is it still on the increase?—lt is much about the same just now.
2894. Have more races been recently cut by the Government, for the purpose of supplying water?—
Two during my time.
2895. Do the races now command the whole of the land of the Specimen Gully on the one side and
Fryer’s Range on the other ?—Specimen Gully side it does, on the Fryer’s Range it does not cover the
whole of it; there is nothing opened there yet.
2896. Are there any persons in Specimen Gully taking water from the department at present ?
Yes.
2897. Who ?—Gayland is one, Peeler and party —some three men.
2898. How many sluice-heads does Gayland take ? —Two million gallons per week.
2899. And the other, Peeler ? —They average half a million per week.
2900. Is there any other ? —Not at this time—there has been one temporarily for the slate quarries,
washing the stuff from the slate, only three or four weeks.
2901. We restrict ourselves to mining ?—Just so.
2902. Have you any reason to anticipate that more sluicing will be undertaken in Specimen Gully ?
—No.
2903. Provided you had more water ?—No, I do not think any more will be taken up in Specimen
Gully.
2904. Do you supply water to the Garfield ?—Yes.
2905. What quantity of water do they take?—Three-quarters of a million a week they have been;
they are about idle now.
2906. Are you supplying water to any other ?—Yes, 4,500,000 per week.
2907. Is that idle ?—No, that is busy.
2908. In Fryerstown, do you supply water for sluicing at present ? —One party, Haslitt and Company.
2909. If the upper reservoir of which you have heard at Malmsbury were constructed, and there was
an ample body of water available, would you have a greater demand for water for sluicing purposes ?
I think so, on the Campbell’s Creek and Fryer’s side.
2910. What price do you charge for the water now?—A halfpenny per 1,000 gallons for sluicing.
2911. For other purposes?—Mining, 3d. and a halfpenny, two prices, say three-quarters of a million
at a halfpenny, and the other quarter of a million 3d.; that is about the average charge.
2912. Are you aware whether it is contemplated to extend any further races into the Fryerstown
district, or any other portion of your district ?—No; this present race, Campbell’s Creek or Fryer’s Creek
—there is a new race, nearly completed.
2913. Where does that run?—By the Fryer’s Range, touching Mopoke Gully.
2914. And with what object is that race being constructed ?—To supply the sluicing at Campbell’s
Creek, White Hills, and other places.
2915. Have applications been made to the Government for water for sluicing those ?—I have
applications in the office for about 9,000,000 gallons per week.
2916. And you have not 9,000,000 gallons of water per week to spare?—l think, as the sluices
drop at Chewton, of course the water will have to be diverted to Campbell’s Creek. Some of the parties
who have been sluicing at Chewton have made application to sluice at Campbell’s Creek, and they will
abandon the other ground.
2917. There is no idea of abandoning ?—Some of the older parties—lverson’s party—he has let his
works, and is commencing at Campbell’s Creek.
2918. Is the supply enough for all purposes from the existing Malmsbury reservoir—from the water
now under your control ?—Yes, from this time we are supplying about 10,000,000 gallons down this Poverty
Gully race, and we can send about 7,000,000 more into some other flume.
2919. Can you supply, at the present time, all that apply to the department, directly you complete
this race, with the quantity of water coming down the main race ?—Yes, the Poverty Gully race we can


carry 16,000,000 to 18,000,000 gallons per week—there is less soakage and leakage. We can better
supply the larger quantity.
2920. Tlien, as far as sluicing is concerned, the existing Malmsbury reservoir is capable of supplying
all tlie requirements during the year ?—I cannot say that.
2921. Can you draw from the main as much water as is applied for by sluices ?—No, not with the
present aqueduct.
2922. Is the quantity of water running down the main sufficient at the present time ?—No, not
confining to the main aqueduct. I thought you were dealing with the branch solely.
2923. If a further body of water is supplied by means of the upper Malmsbury reservoir, so that
there will be more in the main race than there is now, do you imagine that there will be a greater demand
for water for sluicing purposes throughout this district ?—I do.
2924. To what extent do you think the sluicing operations in this district would be increased,
provided you could supply every application that came in?—From 12,000,000 up to 20,000,000 gallons.
2925. And you are at present only selling, what ?—An average by this race from the slate quarries
18,000,000 gallons per week, Poverty Gullv race, Golden Point race, Specimen Gully race.
2926. And if you had unlimited water, what amount of applications do you think you would
probably have ?—Probably about another 8,000,000 gallons. It would be a total for all, the new races
included, of 26,000,000 gallons.
2927. You think you can consume that in the Castlemaine district ?—I think so.
The witness withdrew.
Philip Phillips, recalled, further examined.
2928. The Witness. —l wish to state that the dirt in the original creek is over 4 feet higher than it
was seven years ago; the depth of the creek to-day that is in private property—the great part of the creek
is now in private property.
2929. Is that a new channel?—Yes, and this is at the angle of the creek, and wherever there is a
turn of the creek it always works up the stuff, and makes it deeper.
2930. Do I understand you that the old channel has silted up ?—Yes.
2931. And yet you say the creek is the same depth as it was before—you are speaking of the
new channel ?—The new channel at the angle of the creek.
The witness withdrew.
Adjourned to to-morroio, at Ten o’clock.
(Taken at Cheivton.)
FRIDAY, 22nd OCTOBER, 1886.
Present:
R. 11. Shake spear, Esq., in the Chair;
A. F. Walker, Esq., | R. G. Ford, Esq.
Thomas Morris sworn and examined.
2932. By the Board. —Where is your residence ?—Castlemaine.
2933. And your occupation ?—Miner.
2934. How long have you knoAvn this district?—Thirty-two years.
2935. Where is your claim situated ?—On Montgomery Hill at the present time.
2936. How long have you worked on Montgomery Hill ?—I have been sluicing for the last twelve
years, but I worked on the hill years before that.
2937. Do you hold it under lease or miner’s right?—We used to hold it under lease, but now under
miner’s right; we have worked out the lease, and have a private claim with miner’s rights.
2938. What area of ground have you worked out in Montgomery Hill ?—I should think between
four and five acres.
2939. How many acres of land do you think are there still payable and capable of being worked ?
There might be such a thing as three or four acres on the whole of the hill.
2940. Where do you obtain the water from ?—From the Poverty Gully race.
2941. From the Coliban ?—Yes.
2942. What quantity do you obtain from the Coliban?—We pay £2 7s. Bd.; we used to pay £2 2s.
—in the first going off we used to pay 6s. 6d. a week.
2943. What quantity do you use per week ?—A million and a quarter now.
2944. How many hours do you work now ?—Eight hours with the water.
2945. What is the average depth of the face you have been sluicing ?—Thirty feet, on the average;
we have a sluice as deep as 45 feet.
2946. What is the depth of the wash held in that 30 feet?—l couldn’t give you an exact idea; we
take the whole of it; we keep all we can, and send the clay down; we wash it from top to bottom.
2947. Can you give any idea of the portion of tailings to the quantity —how much per yard—tailings
as against the quantity of face ? —We send about one-half down to the creek as fine tailings.
2948. And the other half you retain on the works ?—Yes.
2949. And the half you send away, can you give any idea what is the proportion of heavy tailings
that remain, and slum that goes away ?—I could not, but I cau give you this idea, that there is at present
stacked hundreds of thousands of tons which we have sent down from the claim which has not reached the
creek, and there are thousands of tons gone with the creek.
2950. Did you make any attempt to stack the tailings ?—We have stacked all we can. Our claim
is situated so that it is impossible to stack them, because there is no way of saving till they are in tho
creek; we have stacked all we can.


2951. Is that on the little flat on the creek ?—Yes, wo have three acres for stacking.
2952. What is the length of your tail-race ? —Two hundred yards.
2953. Is it boxed ?—Mostly.
2954. What fall is there per 12 feet? —Five inches.
2955. Could you work by a less fall by forking out the tailings in the boxes ? —We do fork out all
we possibly can now, for our own benefit; we do not send any rough stuff to the creek, because we have
not the fall, we would if we could; but avo have to do the other for our oAvn benefit —it is no thanks to us.
2956. Have you ever tried working with a less fall than five inches to the box ?—Mauy a time.
2957. Is it unsatisfactory ?—lt is out of the question unless you get more Avater; we could Avork
Avith or 3 inches if we had two million gallons instead of one.
2958. You could then Avork from 2 to inches ?—Yes.
2959. Hoav many men do you employ on this Avork ? —Sometimes three, sometimes four, sometimes
tAvo —it all depends what the circumstances are.
2960. Hoav many men, if any, are employed in keeping the tail-race clear ? —Those in the face have
to mind the tail-race as well; there is nobody employed at the tail-race, but if anything happened to that,
they Avould have to leave the face and attend to it.
2961. Have you any service dam, or do you run direct from the Coliban race ? —Direct; Ave Avould
have a dam, but it is out of the question, the Avay we are situated, to have a dam made.
2962. Are you working previously Avorked ground, or virgin ground ?—All old ground that has been
Avorked a dozen times over at least.
2963. Has it ever been previously sluiced ? —No ; but some of it has been turned over from top to
bottom. We have gone through our Avork, and there have been ton or twelve tunnels through and partitions
of timber, if there is any fresh it is on the high reef, Avhich is valueless as a rule.
2964. What is the size of the tail-race? —Foot box.
2965. What depth ?—Tavo feet, and sometimes they are less, and rocks come in, and avo have to cut
very deep places, which ans Aver instead of boxes in those places.
2966. Has any complaint of your Avorking been made to you at any time ? —No, not direct. I have
heard complaints from time to time. I have heard some of the people of CliCAvton say we Avould SAvamp
our Chewton, and that they would be able to build on the tailings. I used to say if they did they would
come doAvn quick. I have heard such conversations, but nothing direct.
2967. Is yours hydraulic sluicing ?—Yes.
2968. You sluice with a canvas hose and nozzle ?—Yes; Ave get all the pressure avc possibly can.
2969. Are you connected Avith any other sluicing party?—Yes. I have got a share in a claim on
the Red Hill.
2970. Who is your partner on that hill ?—One called Claus Ricketts.
2971. How long has that party been at work in Red Hill ?—We have only sluiced five or six weeks
on the Red Hill.
2972. Hoav many acres do you think Avill be available there ?—There will be such a thing as seven
or eight acres.
2973. What is the depth of face there ?—The depth in the deepest part of the hill Avill be 60 feet.
2974. How many years’ sluicing will that extend over ?—From fifteen to tAventy years.
2975. How many men do you employ on that party ?—We have been laying down a tram road from
the hill race to run tailings up to the railway, but I cannot tell how many Ave will require; five or six. We
are ready to make a start, and we might require more than that number; Ave have not tried it.
2976. Is there any probability of more extended Avorks for sluicing, if there is sufficient Avater ?—I
believe sluicing will be for many years to come, but I do not know of any hill that will stand so much
sluicing as the Aberdeen Hill.
2977. Are there any other sluicing parties on those hills at present ?—Yes, several.
2978. Can you give the names of any of them ?—There is one on the White Hill called Roderick
and Evans—that is betAveen Montgomery and the Red Hill.
2979. And any other ?—There is another party in Coombs’ Gully; that is more towards the Eureka,
direct from our workings, running south.
2980. Is there any party at the back of Post-office Hill ?—I could’nt say. I believe there was a
party when I Avas here last; Ido not knoAV Avhether they are there now or not.
2981. If you Avere able to obtain more Avater from the Coliban, Avould you apply for it?—No; Ave
could have it if we Avanted it.
2982. You are at present obtaining all the Avater you require ?—Yes.
2983. Have you any idea what head of Avater you are working with—hoAV high is the race above the
bottom ?—I could not say; it is very high. The race runs close up to the Eureka and Poverty Hill.
2984. That is brought doAvn in an open race from the railway ?—Yes.
2985. Then the only head you are Avorking Avith is from your OAvn canvas hose ?—Yes.
2986. What pressure is it ?—Eighteen to tAventy feet.
2987. What size nozzle are you working Avith ?—We have different nozzles. When avo Avant to send
the Avater far, we use a little less than 2 inches and and 3—we have different nozzles, according to the
circumstances Ave are in.
2988. Can you make any suggestion with regard to the disposal of sludge from your claim Avithout
passing it into Forest Creek ?—No, I cannot; it is entirely out of the question. We are so situated that we
have to run the heaps right under the main road, and it is direct into the creek, and we have stacked all Ave
can stack.
2989. Have you any suggestion to make as to stacking ?—No.
2990. Does any person use the water that is supplied to you before coming to your claim ?—Yes,
are three sluicing parties using from the same race.
2991. Do you use your tail-race water ?—No, the Avater is coming down from the main race for 24
hours. It is divided amongst three parties—eight hours each.
2992. Is there anything you would like to state ?—I wish to make a feAV remarks. I have, as I told
you, been here for 32 years dealing Avith sludge and tailings, worse luck; and in the early days of the
diggings there were sometimes on those Mount Alexander diggings 30,000 people, and they were all busy.


In 1854 puddling machines were erected by scores, and hundreds of people employed; and after that, about
twenty years ago, a heavy flood came down, and washed the results of the first miners* work, the sludge
and the puddlings, and even the bridges on the creek, down to the lower laud on Campbell’s Creek and the
Loddon, and, from that time to this, those that have land on the sides of the creeks have been complaining;
and, in my opinion, the result of the present sludge and tailings does not affect them so much. It was like
the high tide then.
2993. What period was that ?—Somewhere between eighteen and twenty years ago—that flood that
washed all the bridges away.
2994. Do you mean 1870 ?—1 don’t know the date. Well, I believe that the Government ought to
reserve for mining purposes such a thing as three chains each side of the creeks and rivers, for the benefit
of the mining industry. Mining is the thing that has made this colony what it is, and miners ought to be
protected.
2995. For what purpose would you reserve three chains along the banks ? —That is in the case of
heavy floods, that the tailings may flood out to the sides. At the time, the people were making continual
complaints about it. Ido not know any sluicing company or companies that sent the tailings to the creek
direct, but the hill I am connected with, and the Barker’s Creek Mining Company, and they are often
stacking their tailings on the piece of ground kept purposely for that; and I suggest that, instead of putting
a heavier drag on the miners, you should advise the Government to employ prison labour to make the creek
ship-shape, to make the land payable to the inhabitants; then the free labour would be employed for the
borough and shire, instead of what it is, and the prisoners would get a little hard work, instead of what
they are doing.
The witness withdrew.
George Archbold sworn and examined.
2996. By the Board. —What is your occupation ? —Mining manager.
2997. Of what claim ?—The Central Wattle Gully claim.
2998. Is that a quartz claim ?—Yes.
2999. What is the area of the claim ?—I am not prepared to say that just now.
3000. Where is the claim situated ? —ln the gully.
3001. On the bank ?—Right in the gully, and there is a portion, of course, of the West Hill in it as
well.
3002. Is there a battery in the gully ?—Yes.
3003. What do you do with the tailings from the battery ?—We just run them away in the ordinary
way.
3004. Do you make any attempt to stack them ? —No.
3005. You ran them down the creek ?—Yes.
3006. How long has the company been in operation ?—lt has not been always under the present
company.
3007. How long has the claim been at work ?—I suppose thirty years at least, probably over.
3008. How long have you been the manager ?—Only three years now.
3009. Are you aware whether, prior to your taking the management, attempts were made to stack
the tailings ?—We were out of necessity obliged to stack them, in order to save the Avater on account of the
scarcity of water.
3010. Where do you get the water from now?—From the main race.
3011. And no longer having to conserve water you do not attempt to stack the tailings ?—No.
3012. Was any difficulty experienced in stacking the tailings at the time they were stacked ?—Yes,
a considerably difficulty.
3013. In what way ?—We were obliged to have a tailings-pump for one. thing, and we Avere obliged
to employ labour to throw the sludge-sand away to conserve the water.
3014. To throw the tailings away ?—We were obliged to bank them up.
3015. What amount of labour did it require to maintain your tailings-dams at that time ?—Of course
it was before my time, but I should think it would employ a man pretty well constantly.
3016. Have you ever had experience of a company in which the tailings were stacked ?—Yes,
I have.
3017. In what district?—ln this district, with Walker and Co., a very old company, and they have
a very old plant.
3018. Where was that plant situated ?—Forest Creek.
3019. Did they stack the tailings ?—Yes.
3020. Did they use a tailings-pump ?—No, simply a road-way —they were stacked in the creek, and
of course, in times of flood they were carried away.
3021. Have any companies in Wattle Gully besides yours at any time stacked tailings ?—Yes, I
think so.
3022. What condition are the banks of previous tailings in now —are they washed away or
maintained ? —Very little washed away, because they are away from the watercourse, so there has been
very little carried away.
3023. There would be no difficulty in stacking the tailings in your case, beyond employing one man
to keep the bank in order, and the purchase of the tailings-pump ?—I was referring to the past, it is quite
different now.
3024. Would there be any difficulty in stacking your tailings now ?—lt would be difficult; it would
require labour.
3025. That labour you have defined as one man ?—I only suppose.
3026. We have evidence of that elsewhere, and the purchase of the tailings-pump?—That would
be a serious matter. Our present arrangements are to work in connection with the water supply, and it
would necessitate a considerable outlay to work it now.
3027. In the purchase of a tailings-pump ?—Yes, and it would break up our existing arrangements
altogether.
Sludge. m


3028. In what way —what are the arrangements that would have to be broken up ?—Previous to
getting water from the department we had certain machinery, which as soon as we got water from the
department we dispensed with. In fact wo pulled it down, and to carry out the same thing; that is, to stack
tailings, it would necessitate the erection of the same machinery.
3029. Are you aware that the great majority of the Sandhurst mines use a tailiugs-pump and stack
their tailings ?—I believe it is so in many cases.
3030. How many head of stamps do you employ ?—Wo have fifteen. Of course they are not going
much at present, I regret to say.
3031. What number of stamps on the average do you maintain in constant Avork?—At present we
are working scarcely one week in a fortnight. During the last year we have simply crushed about 2,000
tons, I suppose.
3032. What quantity of Avater do you use ?—We have two quantities of Avater. There is one a
million, and the other is 500,000 gallons. We' have a condenser; so avc have two separate supplies.
3033. Your Avliole supply is from the Coliban ?—Yes.
3034. What quantity do you pay them for?—For those tivo distiuct supplies Ave pay, and now Ave pay
for it as Ave use it, because there may be sometimes over a Aveek Ave do not require the Avater, so they make a
concession to us, and we only pay as we use it.
3035. How much Avater do you obtain in a week from the G-overnment ?—I scarcely knoiv unless
I reckon it up. I could forward the Board a correct statement.
3036. Will you do so ?—I will.
3037. What other companies are there in Wattle Gully crushing ?—There is the Forest Creek and
the South Wattle Gully. That is all, I believe.
3038. Where is yours situated? —Between the two.
3039. The South Wattle Gully is the company next to you?—Yes, it is to the south of us.
3040. Do you know anything of the circumstances of the Inspector of Mines requiring the water to
be let off the settling ponds in one of those companies ?—I know what you refer to. Of course we had
formerly a dam for the water, and there was supposed to be a crack in that dam. There was mention made
of it, but I do not know if the inspector officially required that to be done ; and as there Avas a very near
prospect of us getting water from the Government I do not think he distressed us about it, but that is
dispensed with altogether noAV.
3041. But the conservation there was not dispensed Avith in consequence of any direction from the
Inspector of Mines ?—No, not directly, because Ave thought it would be a benefit; still he considered the
dam Avas not trustAvorthy, and for the safety of the men and our OAvn good, we Avere glad to dispense with it.
3042. Does any large body of Avater come down Wattle Gully during flood time ?—At times there is
a very good floAv. Of course it is a very small creek, and soon rises and falls.
3043. Does it overflow the channel cut on the side of the creek ?—Not noAV, it used to. I am not
aware that it does now.
3044. Is that due to any alteration in the channel or creek, or any alteration in the season ?—No
doubt due to the tailings running aAvay.
3045. You mean the tailings blocked the storm-Avater in the creek ?—Yes, considerably.
3046. There Avas no necessity that the tailings should be so placed as to block the storm-Avatcr.
Could not the storm-water run in the creek when the channel Avas cut ?—Of course it was the sludge. The
tailings we are obliged to stack up, because they would not run away, and Ave had to dam the Avater.
3047. And there Avas not sufficient AyaterAvay left for the ordinary storm-Avaters ?—We did not
interfere. It was simply, I suppose, the effect of the slum that ran aAvay from it. That Avould be the only
thing that caused then the stoppage of the Avater.
The ivitness withdrew.
Samuel Gaylard SAvorn and examined.
3048. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—Miner.
3049. Where is your claim at present ?—Specimen Gully, Barker’s Creek.
3050. Is it a sluicing claim ?—Yes.
3051; Where do you obtain the water from for your sluicing?—The Coliban—the main channel.
3052. What quantity do you obtain from that ?— Tavo million gallons per week.
3053. Is yours hydraulic sluicing ?—No.
3054. Ground sluicing, or with boxes ?—With boxes.
3055. What length of box tail-race have you ?—As near as I could say, about 260 12-foot lengths.
3056. What is the fall in your boxes ?—Two inches to the 12 feet.
3057. And you find that fall sufficient?—Well, Ave cannot get any more. We should like it.
3058. Would you use a greater fall if you could?—Yes; but Ave cannot get any more.
3059. Do you receive now as much Avater as you require, or would you use more if you could get
it? —We might get more perhaps sometimes.
3060. Is the quantity that you are obtaining now sufficient to develop the Avorks ?—Yes, it is
sufficient, at the present time. We used to use more. We used to use 3,000,000 gallons.
3061. Is any portion of your tail-race boxed betAveen the railway and the creek ?—Yes, one branch
of the race from the culvert, right aAvay doAvn past the road, perhaps sixty or seventy boxes.
3062. Are they also at the same fall ?—Yes; but across the road they have lavo inches and a half
to keep the road clear. There are about thirty of them tAvo inches and a half.
3063. What is the average depth of the face you Avork ?—At the present time the average depth of
the face is about fourteen to tAventy feet.
3064. And the area that you have already worked out ?—I can just give a guess. I cannot tell
exactly. I should fancy three or four acres.
3065. And how many acres do you think are still available for work ?—I think we have tAventy
acres in the claim and any amount available.
3066. Can you give any idea of how many years’ Avork there is in prospect for you?—We shall
have to work as fast as Ave can, and it Avill only be worked out in the next 68 years.


30C7. lloav many hours a day do you sluice? —We only work eight hours a day—the men.
30G8. But the sluice, the use of the water ?—On an average six hours.
30G9. Do you work from a service dam ?—Yes, cleaned all at the bottom.
3070. How many men do you find it necessary to keep the tail-race clear ?—There is one part of
the time. We do not keep any one there lately.
3071. Did you make any attempt to stack the tailings ? —We stack all the heavy we can, and, at the
present time, it is running through on pieces of ground that we purchased, about a hundred yards before it
goes into the creek.
3072. Did you purchase that for the purpose of stacking tailings ?—We purchased that for the pur-
pose of stacking tailings, as I pointed out to you.
3073. Can you give any idea of the average depth over ground to which you have deposited tailings
—how many feet ?—As near as I could say, it would average about 2 feet.
3074. The slum runs direct into Barker's Creek ?—Yes. The light stuff; what we cannot stop.
3075. Have you any idea of what is the proportion of tailings to the quantity that you wash—how
much would be the proportion that runs away to the proportion that you stack ? —I do not think there is a
great deal going in the creek at the present time. There might be ten loads a day, out of fifty, going into
the creek.
3076. Four-fifths would remain, you think ?—About that, I think.
3077. Your depth of face is 14 feet ?—Fourteen to 20 feet.
3078. What is the depth of your -wash ?—We wash it all; the ground has been worked that much
that it is pretty much all the same. In the solid ground all that has yet been worked, I can hardly tell
you where the gold is ; whether it is on the bottom, or higher up. Perhaps there may be 4or 5 feet of
wash dirt there.
3079. If you had 5 feet of wash dirt to a 14-foot face, that would be twice as much running away
as the tailings ?—Yes, we are obliged to run it all away to get this wash dirt.
3080. You said before that the proportion of what is retained to Avhat is run away would be about
four times as much as runs away ?—About from three to four, I would say. We pick out a great deal of
the rough.
3081. You do not run away all the stuff except the tailings ? —No, we pick out what we can of the
rough, and keep forking a good deal of the rough, all through the boxes, and the purchased ground saves
a good deal of the rough again, before it goes into the creek.
3082. lias the ground been worked previously ?—Several times over, where we are at the present
time.
3083. Has it been sluiced?—No; driving and puddling of all sorts—puddled over at different times.
3084. ITas any complaint of your method of working been made to you ?—Not particularly, only as
to this ground that we have bought, and on that account we bought the ground.
3085. The owner of that land complained ?—Yes, and in consequence we purchased it.
3086. In your opinion is there any probability of larger and more extended sluicing in the district ?
—There is plenty of ground, but people do not seem anxious to take it up at the present time. There is
one party above us, near the quarries.
3087. Are they at work now ? —They are. They have been there a few years. The William
Peeler.
3088. Is their ground a similar depth and face to yours ?—I think what they are working would
average 10 or 12 feet, what I have seen of it.
3089. Do you think they have any length of time before them to continue work ?—Yes, they have
a good few years there.
3090. lloav many sluice-heads do they employ ?—I do not altogether know. I think he takes about
half a million or a quarter of a million gallons —I do not know exactly.
3091. If more water Avere obtainable in the district, do you think sluicing would be on the increase?
Well, I should fancy there being so much ground, they would do so, though they do not seem anxious'to.'
3092. Has the limited quantity of sluicing done been in any Avay dependent on the available Avater
from the Coliban being limited in itself?—Only, that there were tAvo weeks some time ago, when I believe
there Avas a scarcity of Avater. We were stopped then a month or tAvo ago. That is the only time for the
four or five years I have been here that it was likely to get short.
3093. Do you contemplate making any alterations in the levels or position or condition of your tail-
race ?—No, not in the levels; Ave cannot. We might after a bit perhaps.
3094. When you get higher up ? —Yes, avc might then raise the boxes, just on purpose to save the
heavy stuff above.
3095. If you were to do that, Avould you stack the heavy stuff on the southern side of the raihvay ?
—Yes, Ave Avould stack it up, or where avc Avere working, because Ave should not require to go down further.
That is Avhy I should do it, or where the present tail-race is.
3096. That Avould stack a considerable portion of the slum too ?— The. thick dirty Avater it would
not stop, but it Avould stop all the heavy stuff.
3097. Would it be possible in that case to dam across the gully sufficiently to enable a portion of the
slum to settle and run the Avater rather clearer ? —lt Avould stop the heavy stuff at the end. The purchased
ground that Ave lniA r e beloAv would stop a good deal more in that case, and I daresay that will be done after
Christmas. That is what I intend to do with that.
3098. Are there any points you would like to bring before the Board ?—No, I do not know that I
have much experience. I have only been here four or five years, and do not know anything about previous
years.
The witness withdrew.
Michael Brown sworn and examined.
3099. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—Mining manager.
3100. Of Avhat company ? —Forest Creek, Wattle Gully.
3101. lloav long have you been the manager of that company ?—Eleven years. At least, I have
not been the manager that long for the present proprietary. It has been re-organized during that time, but
I have been in the mine during the eleven years.


3102. How long has the claim been at work ?—I could not answer that, as I have been only lieer
about fourteen years altogether. Perhaps over twenty years, I should think.
3103. How many head of stamps have you in your battery ? —Twenty.
3104. Are they in full work ?—Pretty well.
3105. How many tons do you crush per week ? —From 150 to 200 tons a week.
3106. What quantity of water do you use ? —Sometimes a little more than that. It all depends on
the nature of the quartz —for all purposes about two and a half millions of gallons.
3107. Is that obtained from the Coliban ?—Yes.
3108. You do not conserve water now for your own use ?—No.
3109. Do you make any attempt to stack the tailings ?—We have not, on account of getting the
water from the Coliban, and it is a little more convenient.
3110. At one time your company used to stack ?—The former company, I think, used to stack some
3111. There are the tailings in the gully ?—Yes, there are some.
3112. Would there be any difficulty in your stacking the tailings ?—Well, I do not suppose there
would be a great deal of difficulty; there Avould be a little expense.
3113. Have you had experience of a claim in which the tailings were stacked ? —Not a great deal.
3114. Have you had sufficient experience to state to the Board what would he the cost in labour of
maintaining the dams ?—First of all, we should have to carry it 400 or 500 yards to get it away from
private property, resident areas.
3115. Are you speaking of stacking in the gully ?—ln the side of the gully.
311 G. And you would carry that away by a tailings-pump or gravitation ?—Yes, tailings-pump and
burning.
3117. Independently of that cost, there would he the maintenance of the dam ?—Yes.
3118. Would one man be sufficient to maintain the dam ? —No, not for the battery we have going.
3119. Would you stack in one or more dams ?—lt would be necessary to stack in two.
3120. Have you seen tailings dams where the stacking has been such that the water has settled and
come away almost clear ?—Yes.
3121. Is there any reason why that should not be done in this case? —No doubt we could do it; it
is merely a matter of expense.
3122. Do you crush for the public, or only for the company ?—Only for the company.
3123. Have you any information to guide you in forming an opinion how long the works may yet
last ?—I have no idea.
3124. Are you pumping much mine water ?—We have a 7 and 8-incli pump in the shaft.
3125. How much water are you pumping ?—We keep it going on a 2-feet stroke pretty well
constantly.
3126. How many strokes a minute ?—I suppose she runs about from 7to 8 strokes a minute.
3127. Do you pass that mine water down the creek?—We pass it with the Government water in
through the batteries and down the creek.
3128. What is the condition of that mine water—is it sweet or brackish ?—Very brackish.
3129. Is there any likelihood of an increase in the number of the quartz mines ?—-I should think so;
the Forest Creek, Wattle Gully, being the deepest mine in the district, and we intend going down further.
We have a large body of stone in the bottom, and we have driven through it about 260 or 270 feet, through
a shoot of stone, and are not through it yet.
3130. How many feet down are you ?—We are sinking now below the 712-foot level. There is a
shoot of stone we have followed down, but it seems to be increasing in length at that depth.
3131. You think there is a considerable future there?—Yes. I think there is a great future in
Wattle Gully.
3132. Do you wish to make any remark ?—No, I think not. 1
The witness withdrew.
John Ebbott sworn and examined.
3133. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—Mining manager.
3134. Of what claim ? —The Garfield Gold Mining Company.
3135. Is that quartz ? —Yes.
3136. Where is it situated ?—On Forest Creek.
3137. Where do you obtain the water for crushing ?—From the Coliban race.
3138. How many stamps do you employ?—We have been driving 23, only 10 at present; we are
taking down the battery.
3139. You have removed some of those stamps ?—Yes, we are shifting the battery from one part of
the mine to the other.
3140. What do you work with ?—Steam power ; we intend to work with water when the
arrangements are made.
3141. It is not the company that is at present working with that Avater-wheel ?—No.
3142. Do you adjoin that company ? —Yes.
3143. Hoav many tons are you crushing hoav Avitli your ten stamps ?—That would be scarcely a fair
thing to ans Aver, because Ave are stopping; there is a great deal of broken time.
3144. When you Avorked with the 23 stamps, hoAV many tons did you crush?—When in full Avork
Ave Avere crushing from about 500 tons a fortnight.
3145. Have you many years* prospect, having changed your battery ?—As far as mining is
concerned it is a hard thing to say, but it may go on to the crack of doom for Avhat I knoAV.
3146. You have no reason to think it Avill not continue ?—No, it all depends upon the enterprise put
in the mines. >
3147. Where do you discharge the water?—lnto Avhat they call the Sailors’ Gully.
3148. And thence into Forest Creek ?—After a good distance of travelling it reaches there
ultimately.
3149. Do you stack the tailings ?—No.


3150. Have you ever done so, prior to obtaining the Coliban water? —Yes.
3151. As long as you had to conserve the water you stacked the tailings ?—Yes, when we could not
get a supply from the Government we did so.
3152. At the time you stacked the tailings did you run the water clear then into the gully ?—lt
would scarcely be correct to say clear, it would be in that muddy state somewhat.
3153. And now everything goes down?—Everything goes down straight off.
3154. Is there much mine water?—Not a considerable deal as yet, we are not deep enough.
3155. Can you give any idea of the quantity ?—Our pumps are seven inches, making about three
feet stroke; but we are not working the whole of the time, we only work on an average of eight hours in
the 24.
3156. Working third time, and how many strokes a minute ? —We make an average of about seven
strokes a minute, sometimes working very slow, and sometimes very fast.
3157. Is the water good quality ?—Clear.
3158. Is it brackish? —As regards that I could not positively state, because it is a good while since I
tasted it; but I should imagine it is brackish just now; we do not drink it.
3159. Is there any difficulty in your stacking your tailings? —There would be no difficulty as to
making arrangements, the only difficulty would be the expenditure.
3160. What would that consist of?—Providing dams for stacking, and the labour, it would bo a
serious item rather—it would not matter if the mine was paying heavy dividends; but where the stone is very
poor, as it is in this locality, it would be a very serious thing indeed.
3161. What would the amount of labour be? —It would depend upon the quality of the stuff put
through, and another thing to be considered would be the surroundings of the mine; in those places there is
natural provision where we could construct reserves for that sort of thing, very economically, while in other
places it would not meet the case.
3162. But you could stack tailings for a considerable time in those gullies at a moderate cost 7 —At
a fairly moderate cost.
3163. Would you have to obtain tailings-pumps, perhaps, or have you sufficient fall to work without?—
In our particular mine we should have a fall at a distance below, and that would obviate the necessity of
tailings-pump.
3164. But the expense of constructing a dam is merely a progressive expense ?—Yes.
3165. You keep on raising your dam as you crush, you do not construct a large dam to begin with?—
No, it would not be necessary, the slum has a fall enough; you can make your dam by that means, by raising it.
3166. Do you think one man would be sufficient to maintain your dam? —Not if we were crushing
600 tons a fortnight.
3167. Would you have more than one dam ?—lt would be necessary if you were to re-use the water,
to have a second.
3168. Have you seen claims where the stacking has been so satisfactorily performed that the water
leaves almost absolutely clear ?—Almost, yes, sufficiently clear to be used again if necessary; the water we
now use comes in a very muddy state off—the brackish water clears much quicker than that.
3169. Do you know anything of the case of the adjoining mine, what is the name of it, where the
wheel is used? —The Manchester.
3170. Do you know anything of the circumstances of that mine ?—Yes.
3171. What is the manager’s name ?—I am the manager.
3172. How many stamps are employed there?—Ten.
3173. What is the character of the working?—Quartz.
3174. And the water is obtained ?-*-From the Coliban race.
3175. And supplied to the water-wheel?—Supplied to the Avater-wlieel.
. 3176. Do you know the quantity of water that is passed through there ?—Four million and a half
per week we are getting now.
3177. Do you know the quantity that is crushed there?—Yes.
3178. What is that ?—About 170 tons since I have been there. Since taking charge of the thing
we have not had a full fortnight. We have only been there about six or seven months now. We have
never had the full fortnight, but it would average about 200 to 240 tons a fortnight.
3179. In that case the tailings are stacked in dams ?—No.
3180. Are there dams ip the gully below ?—No, none at all. It goes straight into the creek.
3181. Does the water run right into the creek ? —Yes.
3182. Would there be any difficulty in constructing in that gully a series of small dams, across the
gully ? —Bather. It would be because of the private property below it. So soon as we began to do that,
we should begin to dam back on private property.
3183. Throw the water back on private property ?—Yes, we should there —that is, if we had an
extensive one.
3184. Do you run the water from the water-wheel away with your tailings ?—Yes.
3185. Is that necessary —could you not send the water from the water-wheel otherwise than through
the tailings ? —There is no chance whatever of utilizing the water there otherwise than by sluicing ; there
is nothing to sluice between the wheel and the creek.
3186. Where do you obtain the water in use for your stamps —is that the water-wheel water, after
it is used for the water-wheel ?—Not after it is used for the water-wheel. At the same time, we have a
pipe conducting to the boxes ; we have a dam above, but we are in this difficulty there: when our dam is
emptied we have to stop the wheel, and run the supply into the dam. That was the mode of procedure
before we took the thing in hand—it is very inconvenient.
3187. If the water in the water-wheel were conducted in a different channel from the tailings, would
there then be any difficulty in stacking the tailings in that gully ?—lt would be a somewhat difficult thing.
3188. Is there any reason why the Avater from the Avater-Avheel shotild not run outside the bed of
the gully ?—No, it could be diverted down the creek, independently of that sent from the battery, without
very great difficulty. The difficulty of stacking the sand Avould be the serious matter there.
3189. But the difficulty would be very much lessened if you divert that large body of water ?—Very
much. It could not possibly be stacked with that water going there.


3190. If you were to use the tailings-pump, would there be a difficulty in stacking the tailings ?
Oh, no ; there is no difficulty in any of these matters ; it is a matter of exponse.
3191. Canyon give any idea of what the cost to the company would be of using the tailings-pump,
stacking, and diverting the water-wheel water, away from the same course ?—I should not like to give a
hasty opinion on that, because I have not matured any idea; but it would be a very serious thing, provided
you were doing a lot of work.
3192. Could you manage to write to the secretary, by-and-by, your outline estimate of what it will
be to the company ? —Yes, I could do that.
3193. The capital cost and the maintenance cost ?—Yes.
The witness withdreiv.
Thomas L. Brown sworn and examined.
3194. By the Board. —What position do you hold?—District Mining Surveyor and Registrar.
3195. How many years have you held that?—About 30, I think.
3190. Of what district ?—Castlemaine district.
3197. Are you aware of any injury having been done to the creeks in the Castlemaine district
through the results from mining operations ?—Many years ago, there was an immense damage done, when
the puddling machines were at Avork; but that is all SAvept aAvay now. We had then about 400 puddling
machines in this division, and they filled up the creeks, and the culverts of bridges to the full, and they
were consequently all washed aAvay, and neA\ r bridges and cul\ r orts had to be erected.
3198. Has that deposit been washed aAvay ? —Yes.
3199. And the creeks left pretty well in their original condition as to depth ?—Yes, deeper in many
places than they Avero originally.
3200. Has that material been Avashed aAvay beyond the limits of your district, do you suppose?—
Yes.
3201. Gone into the Loddon ?—Yes, and into the sea.
3202. Does the filling up of the creeks continue at the present time ?—No, only in two or three
instances.
3203. Would you mention those instances ?—The Adelaide Hill, to the Avest of Montgomery’s Hill,
and Red Hill.
3204. Those are all sluicing ? —Yes, and from Aberdeen Hill, those are the principal places.
3205. Is there any filling up of the creeks taking place from quartz mining operations at present ?
None.
320 G. You are aware that the tailings from the Wattle Gully mines Aoav doAvn the creek at
present ?—Yes, they have plenty of room on their own ground for years to come.
3207. It is coming doAvn the creek ?—Very little, scarcely any of it comes into the creek, and there
are alluvial excavations in their ground in Avliich they can stack the tailings for many years to come.
3208. Are they doing it ?—Yes, it naturally settles there.
3209. When the Board saAv the creek, beloAv the Forest Creek company, it seemed to be conveying
a very large amount ?—That is not the creek, that is simply the old alluvial Avorkings, and old excavations.
3210. That does not carry aAvay and get into the Little Bendigo Creek or any other creek ?—No.
3211. Nor find its Avay into Forest Creek ?—Very little; you may see a trace of it down the road
here.
3212. You think the passage of the tailings from the Wattle Gully is doing no harm to any creek in
the district ? —None Avliatever.
3213. As to any other mines in Forest Creek, are any of them causing any injury by filling up or
the introduction of deleterious water ?—No, the Garfield has nearly three-quarters of a mile of old
Avorkings, gullies, before it goes to the creek.
3214. Do, then, tailings arrive at the creek? —No, they are stacked for along time; they let it run
noAv, but there are so many large paddocks that nothing but the Avater and thin sediment gets into the
creek.
3215. Does the debris from old workings in Forest Creek and in the gullies on each side get carried
away now ?—Very little.
3216. It is not on the move ?—No.
3217. Do you consider that the mischief of the sludge in this portion of the district, Forest Creek
and its tributaries, is iioav over?—Yes, sluicing is nearly done up; there are only one race and three claims
in the district noAv for sluicing, only one puddling race. .
3218. Is sluicing, do you think, likely to be on the increase on the Campbell’s Creek side ?—That is
the only place.
3219. You think that will increase ?—Yes.
3220. To any material extent ?—Yes, most of the men from CheAvton are preparing to remove doAvn
there.
3221. Is the Campbell’s Creek being more filled up noAv ?—No.
3222. It is filled up ?—That Avas from the Noav Chum Gully principally.
3223. Do you think that Avill become worse in future OAving to the sluicing from the Coliban ?—No,
all that ground is worked out; there are no more tailings.
3224. You say there Avill be more ?—That is at Guildford, further doAvn the creek; this filling up is
in the Castlemaine township.
3225. Do you think there Avill be an extension of sluicing in the Fryer’s district?—No, I think not
A r ery great; the ground was more shalloAV there, and much more Avorked than in this division.
3226. Are there any pretty large operations in Fryer’s Creek in sluicing ?—No.
3227. There is one company in Golden Gully —Williams ?—A small one; he employs two men.
3228. He has got a pretty good face ?—Yes.
3229. That Avould carry a good deal of material ?—Yes; and another small one on the face o
Specimen Hill; but they do a very small amount.


3230. How do you account for the Campbell’s Creek, the watercourse .being so much obliterated,
the creek being so filled up all the Avay down to the junction at Guildford ?—lt lies very Hat.
3231. Is that filling up—is it still on the move from the higher levels ?—A great deal came down
from Barker’s Creek.
3232. Is it still going down in that direction ?—Very little.
3233. You think that it has settled, and is not washed by flood now ?—No, we have not had floods
sufficient to move it for a long time.
3234. If we had a flood like 1870, would it carry large quantities of that away?—No doubt, it
always does, and makes new courses.
3235. Do you notice whether along the banks of theLoddon—you know there are heaps of headings
from the tunnels thrown out on the side of the slope—do they wash away much ?—Yes, each flood they do
considerably.
3236. They really add to the filling of the creek ?—Yes; in fact the river is almost obliterated
near those tunnels.
3237. Can you make any suggestion whereby the evil caused by the washing away of these old
heaps can be prevented ?—Only bv the diversion of the creek, turning the water away from it.
3238. Or river, in that case ? —Yes.
3239. That holds good for the Loddon right above the junction of Fryer’s Creek ?—Yes, but there
the river is so confined that it cannot go out of its course.
3240. But it is still bringing quantities from those old heaps all the way down ? —Yes.
3241. Do you think it is washings from those claims more than the sluicing of the present that is
raising the Loddon ?—I do not think it is rising.
.3242. We have evidence that it is ?—lt is mostly from the Fryer’s division, then.
3243. Is there much working in the Loddon above Vaughan ?—Yes.
3244. Do you know whether the bed of the river above Vaughan is rising ?—No, I cannot say.
3245. Do you know Fryer’s Creek at the junction at Vaughan ?—Yes.
3246. Is that being fillod ?—I do not know that it is being filled extra.
3247. Have you any suggestion with your long knowledge of the district, whereby the progress of
this large body of silt in Campbell’s Creek and the Loddon can be in any way reduced ?—lt has been
suggested that the channel should be cut. At one time I surveyed a line from Forest Creek to the River
Loddon, at its junction with the Muckleford Creek at Newstead.
3248. Was that a clear water channel ?—lt was at one time.
3249. What was the object of that clear water channel ?—To see if the tailing could be carried away,
and confined to its own water channel.
3250. You propose to run the tailings in that ?—Yes.
3251. To carry the tailings further into the river ?—Yes.
3252. To clear the higher portions, and force the river down ?—Yes.
3253. What would bo the advantage of that ? —I do not know; I was directed to do it by the
Government.
3254. There was no consideration given as to what injury might be caused by the transmission of
this large body of stuff loAver doAvn ?—No.
3255. Would you be in favour yourself, Avitli your knoAvledgo of the place, of any such proposition ?
—No; I recommended very strongly against it.
3256. Do you knoAV the Barker’s Creek district?—Yes.
3257. Are you under the impression that sluicing may extend there ?—No; most of the yields have
been tried and given up as non-payable. Ido not think there is any necessity for any action being taken
in this district just noAv, there is so little. The only thing is the working of the claims at Montgomery’s
Hill, and thence through the Castlemaine borough. The borough of Castlemaino expended a lot of money
in carting it out.
3258. That was near the raihvay ?—That was the made channel, in the toAvnship itself, from the
Gas-works to the Distillery, and again to Campbell’s Creek.
3259. Has the portion that they cleared out re-filled ?—Partially, but they still continue to clear it
out. They use the tailings, and ten thousand of loads of tailing in the gullies here at the back of the
Adelaide Hill are utilized by the Government. They get them for nothing, and they are carted to Mel-
bourne as raihvay ballast, and for the sleepers.
3260. By dint of that Avork and what you have mentioned, you consider the difficulty here would be
got rid of in course of time ?—Yes.
3261. You are acquainted Avith the Fryerstown mine?—Yes, I used to have the Avholo of the
district.
3262. At one time Climes, Era, Anglo-Australian, and others used to stack the tailings in Fryer’s
Creek, did they not ?—They are in Golden Gully, a long way from any creek.
3263. But those dams were carried aAvay by the heavy storms ?—Yes, the Government reservoir at
Crocodile Gully burst, and carried aAvay the dams.
3264. Where has that material been washed to ?—Down Golden Gully.
32G5. Where to ?—lt is lodged in the gully, in the old Avorkings.
32GG. It has not got doAvn into Fryer’s Creek ?—No; not from there.
The witness withdrew.
John William Sparks sworn and examined.
3267. By the Board. —What office do you hold?—ToAvn Clerk and Surveyor at ChcAvton, and
Engineer and SurA r eyor to the Shire of Mount Alexander.
3268. How long have you held the position of Town Clerk of Chewton ?—Fifteen years.
3269. And how long Engineer and Surveyor to Mount Alexander shire ?—'Five years.
- 3270. Have you been resident in the district prior to holding those appointments ?—ln Chewton, 23
or 24 years.


3271. You heard the evidence given by Mr. Brown to the effect that no injury is being done by the
Wattle Gully mines in filling up the creeks, or by Garfield’s, or by any other mine; that the injury done to
the creek has been done in the past, and, us far as this district is concerned, is righting itself now —do you
agree with that ?—I do, perfectly. 1 think all the damage has been done in the past, and very little is
doing now; it is the result of operations of years ago.
3272. Had you to clear the creek at all within the borough of Chewton ?—No, everything is clear
now.
3273. Do you consider the sluicing mines at the present time are carrying much slum into the creek?
—There is so little sluicing going on, that it is doing very little harm indeed.
3274. As to the Mount Alexander shire, is the Loddon at its junction with Campbell’s Creek rising
at the present time from silt?—Yes, I should say it was, there.
3275. The watercourse of Campbell’s Creek is nearly obliterated ? —Yes, it is very wide, and, of
course, is almost obliterated.
327 G. You remember the time that the creek and the Loddon were really well-defined watercourses?
—They were certainly much better defined than now.
3277. How much deeper should you imagine they w'ere then than now ?—From what I remember of
Campbell’s Creek as far as the Loddon, near on to Japeen and Guildford, I should imagine that, some ten or
twelve years ago, it was five or six feet deeper.
3278. That would appear to be a rise of six inches in the year ?—Yes.
3270. Do you think that is still going on?—No, I do not think so now.
3280. Do not you think a large quantity is being swept down from the Barker’s Creek and Forest
Creek, right along Campbell’s Creek to the Loddon ?—I think very little from Forest Creek—l cannot
speak so well about Barker’s Creek, for I know very little of it.
3281. Supposing we had a flood like as in 1870, 1880, or in 1882, would that move a large body
down into the Loddon at Guildford, do you think ?—Well, it would take some down, but not in the same
proportion as it did some years ago.
3282. The evil is lessening, you think?—Yes.
3283. Has the Mount Alexander shire, at any time, made any complaint on the ground of the
silting up of Campbell’s Creek ?—We have had some trouble there with the sluicers, more especially on the
Main Road, near the school, the sluicing on the east side of the road, since sluicers are at work there, and
it choked up the culverts crossing the road; we believe that this is only a temporary inconvenience which
will rectify itself by and by.
3284. Did you take any action against the sluicers ? —No more than I compelled them, on one or two
occasions, to come and clear out the culverts.
3285. Was there much debris being carried down to the culverts ? —Yes, in one case it was com-
pletely choked; in fact, in heavy rains, the water used to wash across the road.
828(5. Then, when they cleared the road, was all that material carried into the Campbell’s Creek ?
Yes, of course; the culvert was not large enough to allow a very large quantity to go through; but it is so
flat, the debris settles about that road instead of going into the creek.
3287. Are there other places from which the slum can pass without getting into the creek ?—Not in
the locality. In Blanket Gully, where they propose to sluice, there is any amount of deep ground where
the debris can settle without any trouble at all.
3288. Would it be necessary for the sluicers to make dams or take any action to force the water into
those old workings, or will it go there naturally ? —There is a large natural fall.
3289. Then it could be sent to the old workings without cost to the miners ? —Yes.
3290. Do you know any place about here Avhere the old workings have been filled ?— ln Chewton,
it has largely assisted in disposing of the slum—the old workings.
3291. And when they are filled up, does vegetation grow well? —Very rarely.
3292. Do fruit trees grow in the deposit ?—I do not think fruit trees have ever been tried in this
district.
3293. Have you any instances where it has been attempted to make use of the land filled up by
sludge ?—No.
3294. There are some places in Sandhurst where apparently the sludge from the puddlers has proved
very satisfactory indeed for growing ?—Yes, in filling up old workings.
3295. You do not know any instance now?—No; the only instance of anything like vegetation that
1 know of is in the slum paddock, where there is a little vegetation of miserable sort, but no use—no trees.
329 0. Washed from puddling ?—Yes.
3297. You know the Wattle Gully companies are sending down their tailings without stacking over
old working's ?—Yes.
3298. Do you think those tailings will ever become of use in the old Avorkings—will they ever
fender the ground of any value ?—No, I do not imagine that those tailings will ever be of much use for
vegetation.
3299. We heard that a bridge in this borough had been carried away ?—That was many years ago.
Of course our creeks Avere silted Avith the old puddlers’ slum, and the bridges Avere built in the slum, and
Avhen the heavy floods of 1870 came that carried the slum aAvay, and Avith the slum the bridges.
3300. And Avere neAV bridges constructed ?—Yes.
3301. Has the Avater-Avay become reduced under those floods ?—No, in every case increased.
3302. In Campbell’s Creek has there been any difficulty Avith the bridges? — No; none that I am aware
of. There is some difficulty Avith some land OAvned by Mr. Marriott, near the bridge, Avhere some debris
collected in consequence of the creek turning at an angle. Some years ago it used to make its way on a
piece of land that formed a bye-wasli; but that land has been alienated from the Crown uoav, but they have
filled up the land and turned the creek round at a very sharp curve. It has consequently SAvept into one
side of Mr. Marriott’s property, and run up his bank, the debris on the other side, but that has done no
injury to the flat whate\ T er.
The ivitness withdrew.


John Waterhouse sworn and examined.
3303. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—Mining manager and engineer.
3304. Of what company ?—Of South Wattle Gully.
3305. How many stamps do you use?—Twelve.
3306. Tou have heard the evidence given by the managers of the other two companies ?—No, I was
not present at the time when they gave their evidence.
3307. You are further up at the top?—Yes.
3308. How many stamps do you keep in constant work?—None in constant work. We are using
twelve occasionally.
3309. How many tons do you crush in the week?—This year we have crushed about 200 tons. We
are only prospecting the mine at present. There are large heaps of old tailings, but it is in former times.
3310. You are not stacking your tailings; your are not doing enough work to do any mischief ?
No, those tailings that are stacked there could be well used. It is a most valuable building sand, if the
Railway Department would let us get it away cheap enough to Melbourne.
3311. I understand you wish to speak as to your experience in California?—Some of the finest
Chinese gardens are on the old debris from the sluicing in California.
3312. What is the nature of the ground that they sluiced?—Very much the same description as we
find in Victoria.
3313. What depth of sludge from sluicing is there on the ground you speak of ?—ln some places
50 or 60 feet, Aidiere they have taken down the high face.
3314. What height of face would they be working with ? —I have not seen the face worked, but I
have seen the remains of it. I should say 200 to 300 feet in places.
3315. When you say it is about the same character of ground, as there is here, it varies so much in
the different parts of the colony—could you give any idea; Avas it broken up volcanic? —No, mostly red
clay and gravels.
3316. Do you know Beeclnvorth ?—No, I have been there, but I do not knoAv the place Avell.
3317. You have not been on the sluicing ojierations in that district ?—No.
3318. To Avliat extent has the land been filled up with the sludge. How many acres should you
imagine ?—For miles in places, and I have seen it also in British Columbia.
3319. What Avas this sludge made use of for ? —Vegetables and fruit trees.
3320. lloav Avas it that this deposit is on the land to this extent instead of being in the creeks and
rivers ?—The American system of mining is to bring down a huge force of Avater by hydraulic nozzle, and
precipitate the heavy stuff almost whore it falls.
3321. They are doing that on the Mitta Mitta?—Yes, and on the SnoAvy Creek.
3322. Only there they run it straight into the m r er ?—Yes.
3323. You spoke of the claims in Avliich they are working doAvn hills Avith flat lands intervening
betAveen the river or creek ?—Yes,
3324. But Avhat method do they use to prevent the water carrying the sludge from running
away ?—A lot of it does run nAvay, till it fills the creek, but a lot stops on the flats.
3325. Do they attempt, by sludge dams, to retain the water ?—No, you see there is no compensation
payable to anyone there. They can do anything they like.
3326. What Avould be the distance from the facings to the nearest defined water-channel ?—ln some
places close by, and in others they Avould go into two or three gullies, and get caught going doAvn.
3327. Do they construct fascine dams, or sticks, or bushes ?—No, I have only seen that done AA r hen
they wanted to retain Avater.
3328. Not merely for the sludge ?—No.
3329. Are you acquainted in any way AA'ith the difficulties that have occurred in California with
the sludge Avhich became in many parts serious difficulties ?—That is since I AVas there. I have heard of
them, but I did not know of anything of the sort in my time.
The witness withdrew.
John Ehbott recalled and further examined.
3330. The Witness. —As to the silting up of the Loddon River itself, I have a very strong opinion
that it is not so much the result of mining operations —sluicing—carried on [at Fryer’s Creek and Forest
Creek, but from the mining operations carried on on the banks of the river itself.
3331. Which mining operations do you uoav speak of on the banks of the Loddon ?—Sluicing and
alluvial Avorkings.
3332. Whereabouts is that? —From Neivstead nearly to Glenlyon. I remember distinctly when
there Avere no mining operations carried on along the banks of the Loddon in those places.
3333. You are speaking of principally above Guildford?—The principal workings are above Vaughan,
although there is a good bit of Avork being done below Vaughan, and thence to Guildford.
3334. From Guildford up toAvards Glenlyon ?—Yes, there are some millions of tons being brought
out from the table lands and being run into the river right off, and every flood carries those large quantities
downward, and I believe that is Avhere the river is silting up so rapidly; it is more from that, as a conse-
quence, than from the Avork being done either by sluicing or quartz mining, that is in the tributaries of the
river. I remember, in a few years, the large waterholes just round Vaughan A\ r erc filled up just after the
rush took place on the table lands, Avlien I Avas a boy, the river Avas quite free.
3335. Which part from Guildford ?—As far upas Glenluce there Avere large beautiful Avaterlioles all
the Avay.
3336. Are you speaking of sluicing carried out Avith the Loddon water —surplus water ?—Yes, the
plan there has been to bring their dirt out and coin'ey it down in shoots by the side of the river, and sluice
it in the river by the side of the running stream. That Avas the old plan, and then in addition to that largo
quantities of debris have been brought out and throivn over as con\ r enient, instead of filling up.
3337. Has there been much sluicing operations carried out from the Loddon Sluicing Company’s
Avater ?—An immense deal has been carried on there for the last 25 years and more, almost 30 years.
Sludge. N


3338. Is there much now ? —Not so much, because things have been worked very poor, the hills
have been riddled. As you travel from Guildford away up the Loddon on either side, the table lands have
been perfectly riddled—that is, most of the hills.
3339. Still you come back to the position that the filling-up of the Loddon is due to past operations
more than the present ? —Of course, and more the result of work done in the immediate vicinity than away
in the tributaries of the Loddon. Ido not think the work done here, and on the other side as well, has very
materially affected the silting-up.
The witness withdrew.
Adjourned.
(Taken at Huntly.')
TUESDAY, 26th OCTOBER, 1886.
Present:
R. 11. SiiAKEsrEAR, Esq., in the Chair;
A. F. Walker, Esq.
Amie Ruedin sworn and examined.
3340. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—Vigueron and farmer.
3341. Where is your property situated?—On the east side of Bendigo Creek.
3342. At Huntly ?—Yes.
3343. What is the area of that ? —About 50 acres.
3344. How much of that do you use as a vineyard, and how much for other purposes ?—Fifteen
acres, vineyard and orchard mixed.
3345. To what use do you put the rest of your land ? —To growing cereals.
334(5. What length of your property fronts the Bendigo Creek ?—About 40 chains.
3347. Your vineyard is banked out from the creek ?—Yes.
3348. Was that, banked out, prior to your taking possession ?—Part of it only.
3349. How many years ago is it since you purchased the property ?—ln 1871.
3350. You say it was partly banked —what was the object of partly banking it ?—There was only
about six chains of it done, just facing the Eaglehawk channel.
3351. And you completed the banking out?—No, the rest was completed by the Government.
3352. You are speaking of the bank that is constructed along the creek ?—Yes.
3353. I was speaking of the banking along your property ? —I could not tell when that was done,
but the beginning Avas very slight, not more than eighteen inches in places, and two feet in others.
3354. That bank was constructed prior to the Bendigo Creek being banked ? —Yes, and to the best
of my knowledge it was done previous to the channel being cut by the Government, whether to keep the
sludge from the big engine or the puddling mills I could not say, but it was done in olden times.
3355. With the object of keeping the sludge from flowing over the land?—lt might have been for
the floods, but it might have been for mining operations. I could not tell.
3356. Does the remainder of your land that is not banked up like the vineyard suffer from sludge ?
—Well, it has this last seven or eight years. It suffered through the breakage of the bank.
3357. In what way did it suffer ?—The sides of the channel became worn and broke out, and of
course made floods. It flooded the crop.
3358. To what extent, to what acreage, and to what depth did it flood the lands ?—We have had
one a very severe oue; in fact, the whole of it was flooded to a height of about eighteen inches. That must
be some eight years ago, to the best of my recollection.
3359. When you say the whole of it, what acreage do you mean ?—About 50 acres.
3300. What is the result on the land of the sludge flowing over it—does the land recover itself after
a time ?—Well, it all depends. I have seen it benefit the land, and I have seen floods doing the land harm.
If the flood comes through it carries vegetable matter, that will do good to the land; but we have often
streams that carry silt from the mines. I have noticed that the plants after such floods die. I have had a
lot of grass die, and some green grass killed as if something poisonous had destroyed it.
33(11. Supposing there was no further deposit of sludge, to what purpose would you put the land
you have now that has been covered with sludge. Would you use it for vines ?—-Yes.
3362. Do you consider the deposit of sludge is injurious or favorable to the growth of vines ?—lf
the plant is thriving in the sludge, and one of those floods of this poisonous stuff comes in it will kill the
fruit, but allow the sludge to settle for twelve months or two years, and it becomes a benefit.
3363. Provided there was no further deposition the land recovers itself ?—Most decidedly.
3364. What effect has the sludge on the lands that you use for the cultivation of cereals ?—lt has
almost the same effect. Whatever it may contain it poisons the water from the mines, and has the
effect of killing vegetation for a certain time, and if you allow that land to remain idle for a couple of years,
you put a crop in and it will do good; hut at the time, if the flood comes while you have the crop in, it is a
real injury, and it may do an injury even if you are cropping it a few months after.
33G5. The Bendigo Creek fronting your property is banked up, partly by the council, and partly by
Government ?—Yes.
3366. If that bank is kept in order is that sufficient to keep out the floods ?—Well, every week the
silt is rising, for when we do not get floods we have a flow of sludge from the different mines—the Eagle-
liaAvk race a certain proportion, and the Bendigo Creek does the same.
3367. From your observations do you consider that the bed of the creek is rising to such an extent
that the floods can get over the top of the embankment ?—Yes.


33G8. To wlmt extent is that creek rising per year?—l should say eighteen inches near my place.
3309. With the other creek at Eaglehawk, at what rate is that rising per year ?—lt would be diffi-
cult for me to give you an idea. You see the junction is near my place, and when the flood comes it causes
the water to back up water, so it is very difficult to say.
3370. I see by my notes that I understood you to say previously, when we visited the ground
with you, that the creek had filled four feet in fifteen years, or at the rate of three inches per year, so that
there must be some misunderstanding ?—Yes; when I come to consider this case when we placed this em-
bankment, I thought we had room of five feet where now it almost overflow's, so that if the council do not
do it or the Government, we will be compelled ourselves to add a coat on top of this embankment, or we will
be overflowed.
3371. To what total extent has the creek filled ?—I do not know.
3372. The Eaglehawk Creek was cut out a few years ago ? —Yes.
3373. llow much ?—Six feet.
3374. llow long ago?—lt was done before I came there, but I could not be positive; something
about eighteen years ago.
3375. To what extent has it filled up during that time?—The creek does not fill up, the fall is so
great that it deepens itself rather than fills.
3370. Do you know as a matter of fact whether the deposit below your property in the creek is
increasing ?—Yes.
3377. And flooding over the lands more than formerly I—Yes,1 —Yes, greatly; in fact, there is a piece of
laud that I selected, and at the time I did I would not have minded risking putting a crop in; at present I
cannot risk any crop, I am the loser of the land there £lOO a year, not being able to crop it.
3378. When you bought the property was the Bendigo Creek a well-defined channel?—Yes.
3379. Is is still a well-defined channel at the end of your property ? —Not over my property.
3380. Is it completely filled up ?—Yes; I am speaking not of the 50 acres, but towards Freeling-
road; nearly two miles this side of Freeling-road it is lower.
3381. Is it injuring the properties?—lt makes the land so that no one can venture to put a crop in.
3382. It renders the land useless? —It renders the land useless; no one can settle on land that is
liable to be Avaslied aAvay.
3383. Is it useless for grazing ?—lt might be used for grazing about this time of the year. For a
couple of months the grass is very thick on that slum, and Avithout nourishment, the first hot Avinds it is
gone.
3384. Have you any idea of the area of ground that has been depreciated in value by the sludge
independently of your oavu — lioav many square miles ?— I should say it Avould be about six miles long by
three-quarters of a mile Avide.
3385. What should you consider Avas the depreciation in the value of that property ?—At least that
land Avould be worth £8 per acre for agricultural purposes, and it is not Avorth 10s. iioav. It is not Avorth
the fencing iioav as it is.
3380. Has any action been taken to your personal knoAvledge to confine that sludge, proA'ide a
channel for it, or to in any Avay mitigate the injuries to the laud?—Yes; avc have agitated for years, and
have had commissioners doAvn here, and have had a survey made; in fact, everything as proposed by the
different Ministries that have been in poAver, and through them getting out of office the scheme that Avas
put in motion Avas destroyed.
3387. When you say a survey made by the Government, for what purpose?—To have the channel
cut, deepened, and to carry the Avhole of our storm Avater.
3388. To carry the sludge water ?—To carry the storm Avaters. They intended all time that the
mining laAvs Avould be put in force to prevent the sludge coming doAvn, and Avould.give sufficient room to
convey Avater.
3389. It Avas not a sludge channel, but under that provision the sludge Avould be prevented, and the
creek restored to Avhat it Avas before?—Just so.
3390. lloav many acres of your property did you say Avere injured by the sludge ?— The Avhole, I
believe, of the private property has been flooded, but the sludge has been only tAvice over the Avhole of it.
3391. What portion of your property has been depreciated in value by the sludge, and to what
extent ?—About sixteen acres.
3392. What Avas the value of the sixteen acres if there Avere no sludge? —l tell you the purchased
price, £BOO for twelve acres.
3393. lloav long ago ?—Fifteen years ago.
3394. Has the value of the land risen since that time?—l do not knoAV that it has risen; I do not
know it has loAvered.
3395. You consider that the present A r alue of the land, proA'ided it Avere not injured by the sludge?
—-Yes.
3390. What is the present value ?—I consider I have lost through the orchard £4OO.
3397. You consider the value of that per acre has been depreciated at least 50 per cent. ?—Yes.
The toilness withdreiv.
John Tootell SAVornand examined.
3398. By the Board. —You are a farmer ?—Yes.
3899. Where is your property situated, and the extent of it ?—Bagshot; 87 acres.
3400. What portion of that 87 acres is fronting the creek, and lioav much of it has been injured by
sludge ?— TAventy-two chains fronting the creek; 25 acres have been injured by the sludge.
3401. Is the land rendered hopelessly useless or merely depreciated ?—Some of it is hopelessly
gone.
3402. lloav many acres of the 25 have gone ?—Perhaps not more than four or five.
3403. What do you consider the value of those four or five acres ?—£s an acre.
3404. What Avas the price you gave ?—Only £1 an acre.
3405. How many years ago ?—Thirty years next December,


3406. And you consider the land has risen to the value of £5O an acre?—Yes, with the improve-
ments on it; five acres of this land has been sold close by.
3407. And the other portion —the 21 acres—what do you consider the depreciation of value on those
21 acres ?—lt is not worth more than os. an acre.
3408. What do you use those 21 acres for ?—Cattle run on it.
3409. Was it ever cultivated? —A portion of it; about 10 acres.
3410. Why did you carry that out of agriculture into grazing? —On account of the stormwater
coming over and carrying sludge with it.
3411. How many years ago is it since it was last cultivated ?—I think about eight years ago.
3412. Then the damage done to the land was not so great eight years ago as it is now ?—The
damage is increasing every year.
3413. Can you give any instances to show to what extent it is increasing by means of bridges being
silted-up, or the water channels being altered, abraidcd ? —Yes, I know the creek is filling-up gradually
every year; some of the bridges are completely choked up.
3414. Can you mention any that are choked up ?—The Freeling-road bridge is completely choked up.
3415. Originally that bridge was constructed with a water-way of ten feet ?—Quite that.
3416. How many years is it since that water-way was ten feet deep ?—That I am not certain; I
think about fifteen years.
3417. It has taken about fifteen years to fill up ten feet, that is rising about nine inches a year ?
Something like that.
3418. Is the rate at which that creek is filling up now more than nine inches a year, or is the deposit
being gradually carried away?—l think about my own place it averages about six inches poryear, but the
nearer you get to Sandhurst it fills up more than that, perhaps nine inches about the Freeling.
3419. Was the Kamarooka Creek always in the same condition —filled up?—Filled up to within
oighteen inches.
3420. Has the hoav channel been carried to pass by this bridge ?—Yes, on the middle Kamarooka-
road, a new channel to relieve the whole channel that was choked up near the bridge.
3421. In the Ncilborougli-road bridge the channel is also to a great extent filled up ?—lt is filling;
it is not so much filled as the Middle Kamarooka or the Freeling, but filled within about three feet of the
beam.
1 3422. Did the council take any action at any time to endeavour to lessen the injury to the lands
caused by the sludge ?—Yes, they have constructed embankments up towards Epsom way, banking in the
Bendigo Creek to keep it off'the private lands and off the road; the destruction to the road is very great.
3423. Has the council suffered any loss by flooding on the road since that embankment was made ?
—No, not up at Epsom; they did doAvn at Huntley last year, the flood came across the road and destroyed
a piece of the road not many hundred yards from this.
3424. Was that the highest flood ?—lt was pretty high.
3425. Was it one that would have gone over the road had there been no sludge from mining ?—No,
it would not have gone over the road had there been no sludge, because the creek would have been good.
3426. Was not the embankment sufficient to keep the flood out ?—lt was at first, but since the creek
was filled up it banks up.
3427. The banks must be made higher, or the creok cleared out ?—Yes.
3428. Have the council done anything in the way of constructing channels lower down the creek ?
—No.
3429. Did they not make a cut near Bagsliot ?—Yes, at the Government expense, not the council.
3430. What amount of work was done there ?—There is about half the length of the cutting done
that we supposo was to bo done when the work was commenced—eight or nine miles in a straight line have
been done.
3431. Have you any idea of what the size of that channel is from memory ?—About six feet deep.
3432. What is the object of that channel ?—To give an outlet for the storm water and sludge to
carry it away.
3433. Where would the sludge be carried to by that channel ?—lt will settle as it goes along, and
have a longer length to settle in.
3434. Will not the effect of sending this sludge lower down by this channel be that the water
courses lower down will be filled up the same as they are up above ?—I think not, because the silt will
settle before it gets down there.
3435. But it will settle in the channel ?—Yes, and in the old bed of the creek, where it is not filled
«P-
-3436. If it settles in the channel will it not force the water over the adjoining lands in the same
Avay as it did with the lands up here ? —lf some provision is not made to catch the sludge and empty it out.
I imagine there should be catch-pits made after the creek is once cleaned out, settling ponds to clean out.
Wherever there is a piece of Government land it could be done without injuring any one.
3437. Is it part of the scheme of the sludge channol that the creek should be cleared out ?—Yes,
that is part of the scheme; and, where it is practicable, to make a new creek where it comes straighter and
give the water more fall, and get away better.
3438. Then the object of the sludge channel is not to convey the sludge down below the end of the
channel ? —No, but to make the channel as good as it formerly Avas Avlien Ave purchased our land, to take
the storm Avater aAvay.
3439. And throAV the sludge water out on the banks ?—Yes, Avhere it Avould settle, and I have no
doubt the council would see to it when it was once done.
3440. Is the sludge going doAvn. the creek uoav ?—Yes.
3441. Is it filled up?—No, I do not see that it is in the least.
3442. Where is that settling noA\ r in ?—ln Iluntly, Avhere it did originally.
3443. It is spread so much over the land that it does not go very far ?—Yes, it does not get to the
neAV cutting at present.
3444. What arrangement have you made for the continuation of this cut ? —The arrangement that
has been made is to apply to the Government for further grants of money.


3445. You have expended all the money given by the Government at present ?—Yes.
3446. Did the Government give that with the understanding that they should continue and give more
till the whole cut was completed ?—Yes, that was the understanding. At one of the deputations, I might
state, the Minister considered ours was an exceptional case, because the sludge was not accumulated, the
nuisance was not created in our own shire, hut run down on to us from other municipalities —Eagleliawk
and Sandhurst.
3447. The council have not at the present time any funds in hand to continue the work ?—No, not
any at all. We made applications this last two years to the Government, but could get no money from
them. I might state that the council made a bank near the Neilborough bridge to protect one man’s pro-
perty, and it threw the water on the opposite man’s side on the creek, and we had to compensate him for
the damage done and cut the bank away.
3448. llow far below the crossing of the main road below Bagshot does your cut extend beyond the
creek ? —lt comes up to very near tlio 12-mile post from Sandhurst.
3449. Has the excavation of this channel by the council had any effect upon your land in the miti-
gation of the injury ?—No, not at all.
3450. Done no good at all ?—No, the end of it is within two and a half miles of my land ; yet, so
far, it has not improved my land at all.
3451. They have not brought it sufficiently up the creek to improve your land ?—No.
3452. Do you know how far down the Bendigo Creek has the deposit of sludge extended beyond
the 12-mile post ? —The sludge in a very slight degree has gone down perhaps as far as fifteen or sixteen
miles iV
3453. Down to Gonrnong ?—Down to Gournong.
3454. Are you aware whether this is travelling further down the creek—has it gone further down
the creek this year than it was three years ago ?—A little must go down every year. It is still going
down, but very slightly; it will go to Mitiamo, but very slightly.
3455. If the deposit of sludge is not stopped at the mines, the head of the evil, will not the sludge
continue to go down through your cut through the channel miles away ?—lt must unless it is banked up
and cleaned out.
3456. Or stopped at the head ?—Or stopped at the head.
3457. Where will it go ultimately ?—lt will still keep filling up the creek.
3458. Where will it drain into ?—Mitiamo, and down as far as Mount Hope Creek, somewhere
down that way. I can tell you the loss lam at every year now is £lOO worth of crop; lam losing every
year through not being able to cultivate these 25 acres. My ground has been in cultivation so long that I
wish to cultivate some of this part, which is the best part of the land, and I cannot do it.
3459. You keep stock ? —A little.
3400. Where do you water it ?—I have good dams in every paddock, scarcely over dry.
3461. You are not dependent on the creek for your water? —No.
3462. Is there anything else yon wish to say to the Board ?—I think not, only that it is so many
years that we started this agitation and expected the Government to carry it out for us. .It was in 1877
when we first started the agitation and got the Government to acknowledge by granting money without
any conditions, that we should pay a subsidy, that they Avere responsible for it. I consider it was a complete
acknowledgment of all their responsibility.
34G3. You speak now as a member of the council ? —As a member of the council, because our roads
have been damaged so much. Every road that approaches the creek is continually been damaged by the
floods, and we take it as a great hardship that the Government does not give a grant of money every year.
In the first instance it was to cost £15,000, and we have received £4,500 as yet.
The loitness withdrew.
Owen Smith sworn and examined.
3464. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—Gardener.
3465. Where is your property ?—On the Bendigo Creek, on the west side, on the Freeling-road.
3466. You heard the evidence given by the other witnesses. What do you wish to say specially as
to your property ?—The Bendigo Creek has done a deal of damage to the garden, and has caused a great
deal of loss in regard to trees.
3467. How many acres have you ?—Fifteen.
3468. To what purpose do you apply that fifteen ?—About eight of it trees and vines ; the other
portion of it -was used for a vegetable garden.
3469. Is it subject to flood ?—lt was until a private bank was made.
3470. Who made that?—l bought the property with it.
3471. Is your land subject to flood now ?—Not exactly on the land, but it comes within as close as
two inches of going over the bank.
3472. Does in injure your fruit trees ?—Yes.
3473. Does it get on to the road ?—Not now; it is just tAvo years since it did, and it has killed a
lot of fruit trees.
3474. Is it killing anything now ?—No, because it does not get over now ; but of course it soaks
through tho bank.
3475. Do you consider there is any danger that the floods in fflture will got over the bank ?—Yes.
3476. What do you consider would be the value of that land of yours if there was no danger of
floods inundating tho land ?—Being in use as a fruit garden, the value of land was £l4O a year, but now
at the present time you can , t cultivate at all in it.
3477. How long have you known this land ?—About nine years.
3478. Are you aAvare if it Avere subject to floods before ?—Not with the previous owner. It is only
the last five or six years.
3479. Why is the land more subject to flood during that time than it Avas before ?—Through the
creek silting-up.
3480. To Avhat extent has the creek silted up on your land within that time ?—I should think about
three feet.


3481. About six inches a year ?—Fully that.
3482. What will be the effect of the continuance of that silting-up ?—lt would overflow my land,
and silt it, and make it no use at all.
3483. What is the value of the land now? —It is worth about £lO an acre fully.
3484. You say, were it not subject to flood, it would be Avortli £l4O a year ?—Yes.
3485. What does it bring in now ?—About £6O.
3486. Do you mean to say that the prospective danger of a flood reduces the value of your land by
£BO a year ?—lt has done.
3487. Why ? Is it that you are afraid of planting the same things, and turning it to account ?—No.
It is what lias come into it—the poisoned water from the mines.
3488. You say there has been no flood the last two years ?—No.
3489. Then why not turn the land to advantage during that time?—lt is full of sludge.
3490. What depth of sludge ? —About one foot deep.
3491. Have you any experience whether a deposit of sludge permanently injures the land or not—
supposing it was mixed up with the undersoil ?—Provided no more silt comes in; but if the water continues
to come in from the creek it will keep it still poisoned—it will recover in time.
3492. The injury is not a permanent one if the deposit could be stopped at the head ? —No. In
fact, the property was depreciated £2OO when the former man had it. I paid £2OO less than the previous
owner.
3493. How many years had the previous owner had it in possession ?—Nine or ten years.
3494. And it had depreciated £2O a year in his time ?—Yes, through the floods.
3495. Is the land still depreciating ? —Not if the floods are kept from it ; it may recover itself.
3496. You say you have a foot of deposit on the portion of your land laid out in fruit trees ?—Yes.
3497. What effect has that sludge had on the trees ?—Killed completely my best trees, through the
poisonous waters from the mines in Bendigo and Eaglehawk.
3498. Have you any stock ?—No.
3499. Can you give any instance, in your own personal knowledge, where that water has been
injurious to stock ? —No.
3500. You say the poisonous water —on what grounds do you use that word ; do you know it to be
poisonous ?—Yes, because the trees die once they get the water on them at all.
3501. That is quartz tailings ?—Yes, from the mines.
3502. Can you give information to show whether you are right in attributing it to the poisonous
nature of the water, or might it not be due to the effect of the deposit closing the pores, keeping off air
from the roots ?—No, I believe it is the water.
3503. As a gardener, you believe it to be that, and not any other cause ?—Yes, because the common
trees in the course of the water are all dead.
The witness loithdrew.
John Tootell recalled and further examined.
3504. By the Board. —Do you know from your own observation whether the trees in the watercourse
are dying ?—The natural trees of the bush are not dying.
The witness withdreiv.
Amie Ruedin recalled and further examined
3505. Are you aware whether the indigenious trees ore dying in the water course ? —I have found
fruit trees dying from the effect of the water.
3506. Do you know whether the natural indigouous trees are dying in the watercourse ?—At Mr.
Smith's place they are dying no doubt.
The ivitness withdreio
William Clay sworn and examined.
3507. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—Farmer.
3508. Where is your land situated, and what is the area?—Opposite Mr. Tootell’s, on the north side
of the Bendigo Creek; what I selected and what I bought extends about two miles along the creek.
3509. What effect has the creek on that two miles ?—There is an accumulation of sludge on the banks
varying from four feet to one.
3510. And for what width is that deposit ?—lt extends, in some places, taking in both sides of the
creek, for I occupy the creek on both sides, about 20 chains.
3511. It is about a quarter of a mile wide ?—Yes.
3512. It does not extend for the whole two miles I suppose ?—Well, of course, on my side it would
be still the same, I have a certain portion on both sides, and on the north side it is nearly as wide all the
way down, about ten chains.
3513. How long is it since you purchased this property?—About 1857 or 1858.
3514. I speak of the land that is injured by the flood?—Yes. I might refer to about 160 acres Ipur-
chased in the latter end of 1857 or 1858.
3515. Have you eyer cultivated that land ?—Yes.
3516. When Avas the last time you cultivated ?—There is a portion thatAvas inundated by the sludge
about three or four years ago."^
3517. Why do not you cultivate it now ?—Because the sludge goes on to a portion of it, though
not all.
3518. Does the sludge render it impossible for you to cultivate it ?—Not impossible but unremunera-
tive. There are some years when it might not be injurious, if it flows on before the crop is very young, and
before the heat comes, it would then lea\ r e a deposit; and more injury is done by the closing up of the pores
by the sludge than anything else, it is very dense.


3519. If the deposition of sludge in the creek were stopped would you consider that your land had
been injured by the sludge in the past ?—I think not, but it would do this, it would take an additional
amount to cultivate it to advantage. I believe a considerable portion of the good soil that is underneath
would have to be brought to the surface, because the sludge is so dense in itself that it is liable to resist the
rain water or anything to fertilize it; if the other were brought up and mixed with it, it would permit herb-
age to grow on it.
3520. What is the nature of the subsoil ? —On the very points injured by the sludge, very good—a
black soil.
3521. What depth of black soil?—lam sure on the immediate points of the creek, it is a couple of
feet deep.
3522. Do you think that a couple of feet deep would bear a mixture of one footof sludge and yet recover
and be good ?—I think so. To show the benefit of that soil, when I went down there first, I cultivated a
small portion near the creek, and it returned more than four tons of hay to the acre; at this same portion now
you can only see about six inches of the top.
3523. What do you use those acres for now ? —For nothing.
3524. Is it good for grazing ?—No.
3525. What value are they now ?—This portion is worth nothing, because of the flow of sludge
over it.
352 G. What would you consider the value of that before the sludge came down? —I .consider that
those portions of the creek where it had been destroyed have such soil that it is worth £lO an acre, cutting
those portions off by themselves for fruit-growing and so ou. As long as the creek continues to flood, anil
the sludge runs with such force over the surface that it leaves a deposit every time, it will destroy vegetation.
3527. Is the creek still rising ?—Yes.
3528. And the effect is to throw the deposit still more on the surface ?—Yes, and especially to spread
it more.
3529. Does the cut that was put in by the council reach as far as your land ?—No, about a quarter
to half a mile from that.
3530. Have you been a gainer in any Avay by the cut ? —I cannot perceive anything yet.
3531. The cut has not had the effect of passing the silt and deposit further away down yet?—Well,
a portion of it will, of course, that is, a certain portion of it mixed with water, and especially after a
drought, any continued drought, it comes down then a great deal more dense and thick than any other time
of the year; it is always clearing itself a little, and, when it gets into this channel, I certainly say it is
carried off by the force of the water, and then it carries it off further.
3532. Do you keep stock ?—Yes.
3583. Where do you water them ? —Sometimes in the creek.
3534. Have you any other means of watering the stock ?—Yes, I have dams constructed.
3535. Have you found that the watering the stock in the creek is injurious to them ?—No.
3536. Have you noticed whether the indigenous trees, the ordinary gum trees, the trees in the water-
course, are dying ? —Only in one place, and that is a long way down the creek, on Mr. KenVs station. I
noticed there the gum trees are dead.
3537. How far is that below you ? —Sixteen or eighteen miles.
3538. Does the sludge go down as far as that?—Yes.
3539. Sixteen or eighteen miles from Huutly ?—Yes; it is more than that from Huutly running the
Avay of the creek, it Avould be I should say more than 25 miles.
3540. The sludge has got down as far as that ? —Yes, and has deposited on the bed of the creek,
and on the land.
3541. Is it much on the land ?—Not much, I think; it is not very injurious there to the grass land.
3542. And yet it kills the trees ?—There I ha\ r e noticed them dead in the creek.
3543. Have you noticed Avhether they are dead in the creek higher along?—No; perhaps it may be
that they originally had a dam there.
3544. Would not the effect of the sludge channel, as cut by the council, be to carry the sludge more
rapidly further down the creek on this land you spoke of ? —lf it is allowed to sludge into the Avater at all,
it will carry it more or less doAvn.
3545. Then the construction of this channel, Avhilst apparently benefiting those up here, is merely
transferring the injury to those further down ? —To a certain extent, according to the amount of sludge in
the Avater.
3546. The only remedy then is to stop it at the head, in your opinion ?—That is my opinion.
3547. You say your land Avas not so injured but that you could cultivate for three years ?—Yes.
3548. And yet hoav it is throAvn out, and you say the rise in the creek is about six inches a year ?
I agree Avitli that, that it is injured on the banks or in the bottom; I knoAV it has raised it about five feet
in the bottom from the commencement.
3549. What you have found from your observations would appear to slioav that the injury is rapidly
increasing ?—Yes.
3550. More rapidly than the other Avitnesses thought ; you have a greater length of the creek, and
are in a better position to judge ?—Yes, it is JfloAving on to the banks Avith greater force, and is consequently
leaving more deposit.
3551. Then you think the evil a very serious one, and rapidly^increasing ?—Yes.
The witness withdrew.
John Buckley sworn and examined.
3552. By the Board. —What are you ?—A farmer.
3553. How many acres do you hold ?—Nineteen acres.
3554. And where are they situated ?—About 40 chains from the Bendigo creek.
8555. Is your land injured in any way by the deposit from the creek ?—Yes.
3556. In Avliat way ?—ln fact, I had a crop on at one time, and I had to give up cropping it, Avitli
this Avater, and breaking the bank—it broke the bank three times, and threw it over my farm.


3557. Where is the land ?—This side of Mr. Ruedin’s, and 40 chains from the creek.
3558. When was your land last flooded ?—This last flood.
3559. During this year ?—Yes.
3560. The last winter rains, in August ?—I could not say the exact date.
3561. Did the flood break over the creek ?—Yes, in three places.
3562. What effect had it on your land ?—Well, it spread over, and it went within seven feet of my
cellar.
3563. For a width of 40 chains ?—Yes.
3564. Did it carry any deposit?—Yes; when it broke over the bank it left tlio grass as red as that—
£pointing to a polished cedar table~\.
3565. What bank do you refer to ?—My own bank; but this came in where the bank broke by Mr.
creek —that was the cause of the flood coming in.
3566. How long have you had that property ?—Ten or twelve years.
3567. Was it banked when you bought it? —No, I banked it myself.
3568. Was that bank ever carried aAvay before ?—Yes.
3569. How many years ago was that?—The first crop I put in was carried off three times, and the
fence thrown down.
3570. Can you tell us when it was first carried away ?—I could not exactly say.
3571. I want to ascertain from you if the floods are increasing, and becoming more dangerous than
they were before ?—Before the bank that the Government put up for us above Ruedin’s every flood used to
come on us that came in the creek. Since that was put up, for four years, I have not had much that was
dangerous until that last flood. Then the flood above the creek was so high that it went over the bank; is
fact, sometimes it came there and the mud was as high as the very top of the bank.
3572. Do you consider that that "bank has done much permanent good, considering that the creek in
now filling up inside it ?—That bank that the Government put up near Ruedin’s, it never came in that
yet; but up beyond that there is no bank.
3573. If there had been no mining at all, would not the floods have gone over your land from the
Bendigo Creek ? —Not if the creek was cleared out; it would not come over the banks.
3574. Not if it was cleared now ?—No.
3575. If the creek was cleared out as it was originally, and tho bank taken down, would the water
still come over ?—Yes, it would.
3576. Then the flood coming over your land is not due to mining—you would be flooded out in any
case ?—I would if there was not a bank.
3577. Would the floods, under these circumstances, without mining, do you much injury?—Well,
the clean water would not do so much injury as the slum Avater that is coming on top of us. I Avas sur-
rounded with the Avater before the bank Avas there, and I had to take aAvay my children and my family for
fear of being droAvned.
3578. To Avliat use do you put your land ?—I had to knock off cropping it, and have cattle on it; it
Avas no use cropping it as long as this slum and slush was coming on it.
3579. When did you last cultivate it?—Eight years ago.
3580. And since that it has been in for grazing ?—Yes.
3581. Does it groAV good grass ?—Good grass if the slum did not come on ; it is a fine paddock for
grass.
3582. If the sludge could be prevented from being re-deposited, the land Avill become good again,
you think ?—Yes.
3583. And the sludge itself Avill groAV grass ?—lf there is not too much; but, if there is a great
depth, nothing Avill grow on it.
3584. What depth of deposit of sludge is actually on your land ?—ln fact, there may be three or
four inches in places; and there is some that Avas there before I came—some four feet.
3585. What is the subsoil?—lt is good red and black soil.
3586. And ploughing beyond the three or four inches, would that be of any injury ?—Not much, if
any more did not come.
3587. Whore do your stock Avater ?—There is no Avater running on that part of the. land ; but my
daughter took up a piece last year which is flooded in the same way.
3588. Do you water your stock from this creek ?—No. There is one thing I have to say that I
think, if there is not something done, we will, in fact, all have to clear out.
3589. What do you consider the value of your land if it were put into the market now ? —lt is Avortli
ten pounds an acre.
3590. With improvements on it ?—There is a good fence round it.
3591. And a house on it ?—Yes.
3592. What did you give for that land ?—£l an acre.
3593. Hoav long ago is it since you purchased it ? —Twelve years.
3594. You think the land has increased in value from £1 to £lO, including improvements; did you
put the improvements on ?—Yes.
3595. Did you put in the house and improvements ?—The house cost about £25, and I put the fence
up, and it cost me about £2O to put the banking; I put a strong fence, a three-rail fence.
3596. Hoav much do you think you have put in improvements—£loo ?—I think I have, if it Avas all
made up. Besides that, I liavetAvo acres of vineyard in that.
3597. Is the vineyard injured ?—There was a flood came last year. I put in a quarter of an acre of
young vines. They came on the finest I ever saAV, and when I came to prune them, they were all dead;
and now the flood came through, and I cannot say whether it Avas the flood killed them or not; but any
neighbour can see they are dead, and if it is not the flood that did it, I do not knoAV Avhat it is.
3598. You say you have nineteen acres, Avliich you value now at £lO an acre—that is £l9o—and
your improvements Avould be £9O; that would leave £lOO for nineteen, acres, for which you gave £1 an
acre. Then, according to that, the land has risen from £1 an acre to £5; but we were told that the land
about Huntly is stationary. Can you give any explanation of that ?—I do not see, when a man improves
his land; why not ?


3599. Did you take it direct from the Government? —Yes.
3600. You consider that the land not improved is worth £5 an acre ?—Yes.
The witness withdreiu.
William Stanley sworn and examined.
3001. By the Board. —Are you a landowner?—Yes.
3602. Where?—Huntley.
3003. Whereabouts ?—The boundary of Bngshot.
3604. What area of your land fronts the Bendigo Creek ? —!Yone of it; some goes within sixteen or
eighteen chains.
3605. Is any portion injured by the creek?—Yes.
3600. llow many acres ?—Eighty acres out of 100 are subject to hood.
3007. Would it always be subject to flood if there was no mining ?—lt Avould not he subject to flood
if there were no mining.
3008. What do you use the land for ? —Principally cultivation.
3009. Does the sludge interfere with the cultivation ?—Yes.
3610. What is the depth of the sludge, and why does it interfere?—There is a portion that I do not
cultivate, and some of it has a foot deep of silt over it; the portion I do cultivate, I cannot say any silt has
remained over.
3Oll. What is the area on which there is a foot of deposit?—lt may be very small. I have a grass
paddock, and four or five acres of that is subject to flood, and in places it is a foot high, and in portions
there is none at all.
3012. llow many acres is subject to the flood?—Five acres; but the whole of that is not covered
that deep.
3G13. What do you use the five acres for ?—I cannot use it for anything. It would not grow enough
grass to feed a goat.
3014. What is the subsoil?—Clay.
3615. Is it good for agriculture ? —Yes.
3016. Did you ever crop those five acres ?—No.
3017. If it were not for mining, would you crop those five acres ?—Yes.
3018. Then what do you consider your loss is in those five acres ? —For grazing puz’poses, not a
great deal.
3619. What is the value now ?—None. If it were good grass land, and not injured by the silt, I
would not value it at more than 55., the annual rent.
3020. Is that what the land is worth now ? —Some people put more value on it than that.
3621. If it were not for mining would the land be worth more ?—Decidedly.
3622. Can you say how much ?—I cannot say.
3023. You have heard it was worth £5 an acre ?—More than that; the land has cost me more
than that.
3624. How much ?—£l purchase-money, and fencing and grubbing £3 an acre, and the ploughing
£l. That will leave the land to cost the occupier £0 an acre.
3625. You put the value of those five acres at £0 an acre ?—lf improved and ready for cultivation,
it should be.
3620. If the creek Avero cleared and no more sludge coming down the creek, would your land still
be subject to flood ?—I think not.
3627. Would it then recover itself and become payable ?—lt Avould.
3628. You have heard Avhat has been said by the other Avitnesses —do you agree with what they
have brought forward ? —Other Avitnesses may suffer to a greater extent than I have, because my land is
not on the verge of the creek. One part is 40 chains aA\ r av, and that too is subject to floods. Some of
the land along the creek has three or four feet of sludge. Ido not suffer as much as those people.
3029. Do you Avater your stock in the creek ?—I have water on my oAvn land.
3630. Have you knoAvn Avhere the cattle Avatering in the creek suffer from it ?—I never heard.
3631. From your oavii observation, is the injury caused by the filling-in of the creek increasing ?
Decidedly; the creek is getting shallower and narroAver every year.
3632. What part of the creek are you speaking of now—above the cut ?—Above the cut from
Avhere they stopped the cutting up to Ruedin’s.
The icitness withdreiu.
Charles J. Busst sworn and examined.
3633. By the Board. —Where is your land situated ?—Fifteen chains from the Bendigo Creek at
Huntley.
3634. Have you access to the creek ?—No.
3635. Is yours flat land ? —Yes.
3636. Is it subject to flood ?—Every flood that comes down tlje creek.
3637. lloav long have you had it ?—Nearly two years.
3638. Was it land subject to floods in previous days, before the creek became so filled up ?—Yes, it
has all been covered Avith sludge; but it was all from the sludge, not the storm Avater. In fact, it is part of
the sludge reserve.
3639. It has not been flooded direct from the Bendigo Creek ?—The last two years, yes.
3640. I do not quite understand the distinction you are making betAvecn the sludge channel and
storm Avater ?—There Avas a very small wooden channel made by Government to convey the sludge from
the puddlers’ dams.
3641. Are you still subject to injury from the sludge channels ?—From the sludge.
Sludge. o


3G42. From 1 lie same channel ? —No, that is obliterated.
30-43. Now you are subject to floods from the Bendigo Creek ?—Yes, silt.
3G44. What was the effect of the soil from the puddlers’ dams ?—I have planted ten acres of vines
in it as an experiment.
8(145. Has the land on which you have planted those vines, and which was covered with the deposit
of sludge from the puddlers’ sludge, since been covered with any deposit from the quartz mines ?—Not
within the last, two years.
3G46. How long is it since you planted the vines ?—Last season.
3G47. You cannot, give an opinion vet as to whether it is favorable ?—Yes, the vines arc growing
very well.
3G48. What is the nature of the subsoil?—Very hard; the ordinary red soil.
3G4!). And the protection of that soil and the holding water in it, added to the nature of the sludge,
is rather beneficial ?—We have not had a chance of trying the soil yet, the sludge is too deep. The vines
arc growing in actual sludge as yet.
3Gf)O. As to the other portion of your land, is that flooded from the Bendigo Creek ?—The whole
of the land.
BGSI. What depth of sludge do you obtain ?—lt is not. sludge, it is dirty water.
3(!f)2. Does it not carry a deposit?—Almost imperceptible with me; I only get the dirty water.
3Gf)B. What harm is that doing you ?—lt, destroyed five acres of oats I had this year.
BGf)4. Can you hank it out ?—I did once, and the flood washed it away.
3Gf>s. How many acres have you subject to that flood ?—I have 20 acres, and my daughter has 20
acres, and 35 acres are subject to floods.
3GSG. Are you cropping the land ?—I have five acres in. I had ten acres of vines.
3G57. That is, twenty acres are not being cropped?—Twenty-five acres not being cropped.
3Gf>B. There are 25 acres not being cropped ?—Yes.
3G09. Why are you not cropping those 25 acres ?—I have not had time.
3GGO. Do you intend to crop ?—lf the water keeps away. If not, I dare not. The reason I put
the vines in was, 1 expected the channel to be cut, and it would suit well; but if a stormwater channel is
not cut, it will spoil the vines.
3GGI. If that is not completed, you cannot do more work ?—lf it is not completed, the whole work
will be thrown away. The Hood comes over one foot, and would destroy the grapes if they are ripe.
3GG2. What do you consider the depreciation ?—There is none. I only paid £1 an acre.
3GG3. You are no sufferer if the mischief ceases in the future ?—Not in the least.
3GG4. How has the crop done ?—The water killed the whole of the oats.
3GGS. While it was growing, was it in sludge at all, or the natural soil? —All sludge.
3GGG. Will a crop grow in sludge, provided it is not interfered with by fresh deposit?—l think so.
It is an experiment.
3GG7. Have you any reason to form an opinion as to whether the Bendigo Creek is poisonous, not
the flood waters, but the ordinary waters that come down the creek ?—I think not, except when in the
summer it is so thick. The ordinary water, coming in a flood, is not injurious.
3G68. Do you know from your observation when the water is very thick whether that, is injurious
or not ?—The water could not possibly get on the land till the flood conies. I have not put any stock onto
test that, point.
The witness withdrew.
Adolf Norman sworn and examined.
3GG9. By the Board. —Where is your land ? —On the north side of the Bendigo Creek.
BG7O. How many acres do you hold ?—One hundred and sixty-four.
3G73. To what purpose do you apply them?—Farming.
8G72. General farming, or vine culture ?—General farming.
BG7B. How many acres have you under agriculture, and how much in grazing ?—I have 110 acres
in cultivation. Not at all times, because I cannot do it now, because of the floods destroying it so much.
3G74. 'What do you do with the the other 50 acres? —For grazing.
3G7f). Where is the land situated?—On the Neilborough-road.
3G7G. Have you ever cultivated the portion that is nowin grazing ?—No. I am speaking of the
110 acres which I have grubbed and cultivated.
3G77. Has any portion of your land been injured by floods?—Yes.
8(178. How many acres ?—About 100.
3G70. In what way?—Because it is all on the side of the Bendigo Creek.
3GBO. To what extent is it injured—what is the depth of sludge ?—Three to four inches in some
places, and in others three to four feet.
3GBI. Where you have three inches, does it interfere with the use of the land for agriculture ?
Yes.
3G82. llotv ?—This slum cakes it, and puts it like tiles or pottery, the crop cannot get, through it,
and it stagnates the crop.
3(188. Provided the sludging takes place while the crop is young, it is injurious ?—Yes, and even
when it is old.
3G84. Have you turned some land from agriculture because of the sludge ? —Yes.
BGBS. How much ?—One hundred acres.
BGBG. I thought you used it now for agriculture ? —No, in former years.
3G87. When did you last cultivate this 100 acres ?—Forty-five acres I cultivated about two years
back.
3GBB. And the other 55 acres ?—About six years back.
8(189. Is the reason you have not cultivated any portion of this 100 acres during the last four years
entirely due to sludge ?—Yes.
3GOO. Is your land subject to a greater deposit than it used to be ?—Yes \ year after year it, is getting
Worse. °


8691. Wliat is the value of the laud now as grazing land ?—I could not say. I wanted to sell, and
I could not get £5 an acre for it, with all the improvements.
8(592. What could you get ? —I do not know exactly; some people wanted it, but they did not tell
me the price.
3698. What is the value of the improvements ?—There is fencing, and the grubbing cost me £3 and
£4 an acre ; and the fencing I did it all mostly myself.
8694. Still you can put a value on your labour. Tell me what the improvements are altogether—
fencing, grubbing, house, and everything?—From £4OO to £f>()(), I am certain of that.
3695. And the number of acres is 164? —Yes.
369(5. That is somewhere about £3 an acre for improvements ?—Yes.
8697. And you could not get £5 an acre now ?—No.
8698. What is the value of similar land near you not subject to floods, as a matter of fact ?—I know’
about ten years ago I was offered £7 an acre for my land —ten years ago.
3699. For this very same land ?—Yes.
3700. Have you spent money on the banks ?—A little, but not so-much.
8701. You say the improvements now are worth £3 an acre ; at this time, wlmt "were they worth?
—Somewhere about £2.
3702. Then according to that, if the land was not injured by flood, it would be worth somewhere
about £5 an acre?—Yes.
8703. And at the present time you could not get £2 for it, without improvements ? —No.
,v "8704. You heard the evidence about the filling up of the creek, and the bridges, and the injury to
vegetation caused by this silting from the mines ; do you agree with that?—Quite.
8705. Have you anything further to say ?—No, 1 am an old resident on the place—B2 years —and I
have know’n the Bendigo Creek 80 to 40 feet deep (nice holes for fish to be in), and where it is filled up
completely with silt. That is 32 years ago.
3706. You say there used to be fish in the creek ?—Yes.
8707. Are there any fish in the creek now? When were the fish last seen in the creek ?—That I
could not say, but since the slum has come I never saw’ them.
3708. Is that duo to the water being thick, or to something poisonous in the water ?—The creek
fdled itself up.
3709. Merely from that cause?—Yes.
8710. Do you water stock in the creek ? —No.
3711. Have you noticed whether the natural vegetation along the creek is dying ?—I noticed several
trees dying on the side of the creek. I believe it is more box than rcdguin and yellow’jacket. I believo
they stand more the winter.
8712. Do you find that the ordinary gums arc dying ? —I noticed some of them in some places are.
8718. Is that because of the sludge on the bank stopping the air, or to something poisonous in the
■water? —That I could not say exactly.
The witness withdrew.
Alfred Jenkin sworn and examined.
8714. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—Gardener.
3715. Where ? —A quarter of a mile back from the creek, near the Ajax bridge,
3716. What size?—Four acres.
8717. Auy flat land? —Yes.
3718. Is it subject to floods from the creek ?—Yes.
8719. When was it last flooded ? —Christmas last —in the early part of January.
8720. Was there any flood in August ? —No.
8721. Where is this land of yours ?—By the side of the Ironbark-road.
8722. Nearer Sandhurst than Iluntly ? —Yes.
3723. Have you been a sufferer through the filling-up of the creek ? —Yes.
8724. How much?—One year £5O.
8725. In what way?—The flood of waiter coming in and spoiling the vines.
8726. How many acres have you under vines ? —Three acres.
8727. Were those three acres all destroyed? —No, only a portion of them.
8728. Did those vines recover ?—They were damaged, the present crop was destroyed through the
excess of wet on that occasion. It spoiled the crop the following year, it had black spot.
3729. Is your land banket! out?—No, lam by the side of the road, and I had no road. I made a
petition to the council asking leave to bank, bat my neighbours interfered with me in some measure, because
it -would interfere w’ith them, if I put a bank along.
8780. What answer did the council give ?—They told me to wait till I did a certain amount, and
if I did any damage to others, I promised I would inform the council what I intended to do further.
8731. If you had permission to bank out your property, would it prevent further mischief ?—ldo
not know what extent of bank I would need. The flood has come over three feet.
8782. What ivould be the cost to erect a bank to keep out such a flood ?—About £5O.
8738. Then (he actual injury to your land is about £5O ?—Yes.
3734. Have you heard the evidence of the other witnesses ? —Yes.
3735. Do you agree with it ?—Yes, I agree in the main, it is the silting up of the ivatercourse above,
that brings the water on to my place; if the creek w r as kept clean above my place, I should not suffer.
878(5. Vou agree w’ith the other witnesses ?—I do in the main.
8787. From your own knowledge, is sludge, provided there is no re-deposit, favourable for vine
growing and for vegetables ? —There is no quantity of sludge on my land for me to judge by, I am so far
away from the creek; I do not get so much damage from the sludge coming on my land as from the floods.
The witness withdrew.


Thomas Britt sworn and examined.
3738. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—I am an engineer. Since I have been in the
colony I have been engaged in mining operations, always having my own mines, and employing my own
men.
3739. Have yon been engaged in farming also?—No, never.
3740. llow long have you been connected with mining in this district ?—Just close on 30 years.
3741. Wlias sort of mining was it at the back here that you were engaged in ?—The Hnntly Deep
Lead, where the deep lead came from ihe shallow working into the deep ground ; I was one of the first
that was Avorking that.
3742. Is the mine at the back of the Court-house abandoned ? —They are all abandoned, simply
because they are Avorked out.
3743. lloav long ago is it since they Avere Avorked ?—About eight years ago, I Avas the last, I think;
I was Avorking a mine doAvn here for about thirteen years.
3744. About hoAv many years ago is it since the puddling was actually stopped ? —There Avas
puddling going on here tAventy years ago, but. in isolated places.
3740. But in your mine in Hnntly ?—We Avere all crushing—l had a puddling cylinder first of all,
and found I could not catch the gold, I gave £650 for it, and had to put it on one side and erect a battery
instead.
3746. Is it as long as eight years since the crushing Avas stopped? —Yes.
3747. lloav many heads of stampers luiwe you on that battery ?—Sixteen head of stamps.
3748. And did you make any attempt to stack your sludge? —Yes, I stacked the Avhole of it, and I
haAe estimated altogether, Avith the Avhole of the material that came from the mine, I do not think there
could have been less than 140,000 tons lifted.
3749. And you stacked the Avhole of it ?—Yes, and I do not think you Avill find the evidence of
anything escaping.
3750. The ellect of the stacking Avas satisfactory ?—Yes.
3751. Was any complaint made as to your system of Avorking, or the A\ r ater?—No, because it Avas
equally balanced, Ave used all our water, and had none to spare. I used the water I got, and Avith the.
evaporation that took place I needed nothing, only to lift the sludge.
3752. Did you stack in one, or more than one dam ?—There Avere three dams, and they embraced an
area of six or seven acres.
3753. Did you pass the Avatcr from one dam to another ?—Yes, Avhen one dam Avas filled, I passed it
into another.
3754. Did you pass the Avater through three dams ?—No, ahvays through two dams.
3755. What depth Avould you keep in the settling-dam ?—I could pass that same Avater into the
boiler Avhen I only had four or five inches on the top.
3750. Was that sufficient to settle the sludge ? —Yes.
3757. Were you re-using the Avater ?—Yes.
3758. You did not pass any AA r ater aAvay ?—No.
3759. In re-using it, Avas the Avater settled so as to be clean ? —I have seen it sent round to the engine
as clear as crystal.
3700. What was the cost of the construction and maintenance of those sludge dams ?—The natural
decline in the land enabled me, by merely putting a loav bank, and keeping a considerable rise at the lower
end, I suppose I Avoukl have four or six feet of sludge before I get the water, to be at a level on the upper
end.
3701. Did it take more than one man ?—Two men night and day repeatedly.
3702. Taking the whole year round, Avliat labour Avas necessary?—One man all the year round ; but,
after a flood, I have seen the bank require a great deal of attention.
3703. Your banks Avere made for the purpose of conserving Avater for your oavh use? —For conserving
Avater for my oavh use, and for the purpose of retaining the sludge on the lease.
3764. Why did you retain the sludge on the lease; Avas there any complaint, or any danger of
complaint, from landowners ?—We Avere simply compelled to, because, if Ave let our sludge go, avc should
let our Avater go.
3765. Are those sludge dams grassed over uoav ? —Yes.
370(5. Then it would slioav that vegetation Avill groAv on the sludge ?—I have seen tomatoes amongst
the tailings from seeds accidentally dropped; and Avater-melons also.
37(57. Those Avould be quartz tailings ?—Yes.
IIaA r e you seen A’egetation growing amongst them ?—Yes.
3769. Was it that a little soil happened to be mixed there ?—No; A\ r e get the sludge amongst the
Avater, and Ave get the Avhole quartz. Auother matter in connexion Avith that; the great capacity in that
case Avas duo to this: as avc Avorked the ground, it became depressed from tAvo feet to two feet six.
3770. The ground falling into the old workings ?—Yes, from the upper part of the lead right away
doAvn the creek became depressed.
3771. What claim are you on Avork at uoav ?—Britt’s Freehold, about four miles and three-quarters
from here, at Bagshot.
3772. Do you intend to stack the sludge there ? —lt Avill have to be done. We have the Bendigo
Creek Avithin 300 yards of the engine, and, if Ave let it go at all, Ave must let it go into the creek; and, if avc
do, the people Avill complain, and Avill stop us, and very justly too.
3773. Is there water to be met Avith in that mine that you Avill use ?—Far more than Ave Avill use.
We have tAvo 12-inch pumps going.
3774. You do intend to stack the sludge ?—lt must be done; but I have heard nothing mentioned
about it.
3775. Shall you stack, in lioav many dams ?—Three; ahvays letting the sludge go into one, and
passing Avater out into the others.
3776. Shall you pass all your surplus mine waters through the dams?—l should keep sufficient AA r ater
to keep the puddling machines going.


3777. What is the character of that water? —It is slightly brackish; but I see the cattle drinking it
in the summer time when they are thirsty.
3778. Without our having to work out the stroke of the pumps, can you say what quantity of water
you are raising ?—I did have it, but I can hardly say—six feet stroke, with two 12-inch pumps, ten to eleven
strokes a minute.
3770. That claim is not fairly at work ?—No; we have had a lot of difficulties, as far as the water
is concerned, on the workings. We had 95 feet of water above us, and the water has only just been taken
out.
3780. ITow do you intend to commence your sludge bank; will you use your headings for it?—No;
if we have a crushing machine, the tailings-pump will pump the sand into heaps, and then the sludge and
Avater that goes from the heaps will run into the dams; and so it comes round again.
8781. llow will you commence to make the dam ?—Merely making a cutting in the level places till
it rises.
3782. Will you use the tailings pump ?—Yes, it must be done, because the ground is so flat. I had,
on a former occasion at Epsom, been working for four years a dredge, with a chain about 45 feet long.
That saved me two men working night and day for over six years.
3783. What arrangements have you with the landowners, as to land, for the purpose of making
sludge dams ?—The company have power to do that.
8784. Ho you pay extra for the further land you occupy for sludge dams ? —No. I may say, in
reference to the channel acivss here, I do not think anyone has been a greater loser than I through the
AvateF coming from Sandhurst, and filling up the creek and destroying property; for one night the flood
waters came down, from the bottom of the hill on the east side to the bottom on the west side, making one
sheet of water at the very least one mile and a quarter wide. I had the mine flooded that night, and that
night was a loss to me of about £5,000; and I lost one man there, at the same time, on account of this.
8785. Will this plant be the crushing plant at Britt’s Freehold ?—lt must be; that is if the thing is
done properly, because the cement in the ground contains gold Avhich the puddling machine will not
extract. An attempt Avas made to get rid of this sludge. A Avooden sludge-box avus built, and £20,000
Avero spent on it, I think, and the Commission came here taking evidence. I recollect I gave evidence on
that occasion. They could not get the sludge out at the end of the box.
3786. Have yen been connected Avitli stacking quartz tailings here ?—Yes ; at the back here, all
the quartz tailings are stacked, and the sludge also.
3787. Do yoti consider stacking the quartz tailings necessitates any serious expenditure on the
company ?—No ; I do not think it does more than to the extent I said—it requires a man to look after the
dams.
3788. You are aAvare that the majority of the companies in Sandhurst stack their tailings ; but, at
the same time, they have their sluices at the bottom of the dams ?—I have not seen it, but lam positively
sure such must be the case.
3789. Why?—Because I have seen such an amount of sludge coming down Ironbark and California
gullies, and I haA r e seen t.Avo or three culverts across the creek. I have seen the sludge coming from a
number of those hills, as thick as thick can be, going into this channel and bringing the rubbish doAvn
here.
3790. That is the puddling machines ?—Yes.
8791. Do you see a quantity of quartz tailings being sent doAvn this creek that you, as a minor and
engineer, consider could fairly, Avithout too much cost to the company, be retained on their oavii claims ?
It should never have been allo\A r ed to leave the Avorks.
3792. You do not see any practical difficulty in its being retained on the Avorks ?— I do not.
3793. With regard again to puddling machines, is there any real difficulty in stacking the sludge
from puddling machines ? —No; and I imagine the reason it is not done is the little extra expense it Avould
require.
3794. Y r ou do not consider, as a miner and manager of companies, that the insistance upon a
regulation, compelling the mines to stack the sludge on or near the Avorks, would have a prejudicial effect
on mining ?—I do not think it would, although, at the same time, in saying that, I shall hear of it again;
still I speak candidly, and say unless it is done the nuisance will never be stopped, it is utterly impossible.
3795. As au engineer, do you consider there is any sense Avhatcver in constructing sludge channels
to bring sludge from one place and deposit it in another, and leave it to go anyAvhere ?—I believe it is
almost impossible ; it must be done in the vicinity Avliere it is made, for this reason, that in the summer
time the heat of the sun has a tendency to bake the sludge rapidly, and it is almost impossible for it to run
far before the Avater is evaporated so that it Avill not move.
8796. So the sludge channel fails in its object to deposit the sludge at the further points ?—Yes.
3797. And if it did not fail, Avould not the depositing of that sludge further doAvn create an amount
of injury to the residents further down ?—Yes; because if you confined the Avater in a smaller compass,
instead of its being here fourteen or fifteen miles, I belicA r e you would have seen it at Ecliuca before hoav;
but it is so spread about.
3798. From your oAvn observation in this district, do you consider the sludge is on the move, year
by year ? —Yes. I am satisfied of it because, many years ago, a channel was cut by the Government, I
Avas on the council at the time, starting somewhere about Epsom, and finishing at the back of the Court-
house, Iluntly, and it stopped there abruptly. That Avas about thirty'feet wide, and three to six or seven
feet deep, Avith sloping sides. It cost a lot of money, and I Avas constantly asking the council to put a man
or tAvo on Avhen the heavy Aveather came to see the water passed on further doAvn; but a lot of stuff came
down and formed a complete barricade a quarter of a mile wide after floods, and the result Avas that the
Avliole of the place is filled up, and the dams are money throAvn aAvay.
3799. Have you thought out any scheme by Avhich the injury to the present creek can be prevented
from going further doAvn ?—I have thought of that a good deal, and I feel certain that all the time it is
allowed to come doAvn from Sandhurst it will continue.
3800. Granted it stopped at Sandhurst, that nothing more comes down, have you thought of any
scheme whereby the mischief can be stopped in the creek, from going further ? —No.


3801. Have you .seen fit any places brushwood or faoine dams for retaining the sludge ? —No. I was
going to say the same method of stacking the sludge and the tailings has been adopted by the whole of the
engines down here. I think there are about fifteen or sixteen came after me.
3802. With the result that, no injury has arisen to creeks or the lauds ?—Not. the slightest.
3803. The water is converted and re-used ?—Yes.
The iritness withdrew.
Edward Warren sworn and examined.
3804. By the Board. —What is your position ?—Secretary of the Shire of Iluntly.
3805. How long have you held that position ?—About five years.
380(5. Have any complaints been made to the council during your time, or to your knowledge before
your time, with regard to the injury being done to tbo landowners through the silt ?—Yes, several
complaints have been made during my time.
3807. What action has been taken by the council in consequence ?—They have repaired the banks
of the creeks from time to time.
3808. Was the injury done through the banks being out of repair ?—No, through the water breaking
them down after heavy rains; and there woro applications from the residents in the district to have them
repaired.
3809. llow is it those banks gave way —were they not strong enough or high enough ?—From the
silting up of the creek. The banks seemed to bo pretty strong.
3810. The bottom is rising to such an extent that the bank is no longer high enough ?—Yes.
3811. Have the council ever represented to the Government that those banks are rapidly becoming
insufficient for their work ?—I cannot say exactly, but they have represented to the Government that the
water has come down the different roads through the silting of the creek.
3812. Did the council pay towards the construction of those banks? —Towards the repairing of those
banks.
3813. Not towards the original construction ? —I cannot say; that was done before my time.
3814. Are you aware of the construction of this channel by the council down near Bagshot ?—Yes,
I was here when a portion of the work was formed, not at the commencement.
3815. Was that done by Government money ? —Yes.
3816. Upon plans approved by the Government ? —Yes.
3817. And done by the council ?—Yes.
3818. Is it subsidized by the council ?—Yes.
3819. What is the object of that channel ?—To carry away the storm water and to prevent injury to
property round the course of the creek.
3820. Has the water channel along the creek whore the cut is made filled up —the old channel ?
Yes, it has.
3821. Have any means been adopted to prevent this new cut carrying sludge with it?—None.
3822. Is it intended to be a sludge channel as well as a storm-water channel ?—No, a storm-water
channel.
3823. Will it not deliver the sludge with it ?—A sufficient quantity of water might carry off the
sludge.
3824. Where would that carry it to ?—Further on. I could not say how far. It has gone as far as
Gooruong, I understand. 1
3825. Have the council in your time ever discussed the question of what will be the ultimate result
of this sludge coming down the creek ? —Not at their meeting in my time.
382(5. Have they ever made any suggestion to the Government, or arrived at any resolution among
themselves, as to tho best means of mitigating the sludge nuisance ?—They have applied for grants from
time to time, and showed the injury that would accrue if they were not given.
3827. That is simply for the construction of this channel ?—Just so.
3828. That is merely to push the sludge out of Iluntly on to some .one else ?—I cannot say that.
3829. As to the actual stoppage of the mischief, no proposition has been made ?—No, not that I am
aware of. We have had various engineers, and their duty was simply to continue the original scheme drawn
up, I think, by Mr. James.
3830. Has the council been put to much expense in the reconstruction and lifting of bridges or
cutting new channels round bridges in consequence of the sludge ?—lt has some; never very serious.
3831. Did not the council construct a new bridge on the Ncilborough road?—Not in my time.
3832. Can you tell me what the size of this channel is that the council are cutting ?—Half a chain
wide at the bottom, I believe.
3883. You have heard the other evidence; are there any points on which you would like to make a
remark—do you endorse the evidence or object to it ? —I endorse the most of it, except I think some of the
witnesses said that if there woro no gold-mining refuse, the place would still overflow. Ido not think it
would.
3884. That is only in one or two instances of flat land ?—I believe but for the sludge coming down
it would not injure it to such an extent. 1 believe the channel is eighteen feet wide in the bottom. I had
.nothing to do with the plans.
3835. Have the council been put to expense in the repair of roads owing to this?—Yes, serious
expense.
8836. Can you give an idea of what the cost to the council has been —how much labour ?—I know
a portion of the road near the Bagshot school which sadly needs repairs; but the council do not deem it wise
till the channel is cleared; it would cost a large sum.
3837. Has the value of the property in (lie shire been in any way depreciated through the silting by
flooding ?—Yes, I should think so. The complaints of a number of residents that they cannot make their
living there unless there is some improvement.


3838. Have you had any appeal against rates on the ground of the sludge ?—I do not recollect that
wo have; we may.
3839. Have you ever reduced any of the rates on the ground that the land has been depreciated in
value on account of sludge ?—Hot after the valuation has been made, but the valuation may have
been lower in consequence.
3840. Have you reason to think it has been lower? —Yes, considerably, I should think; I have not
valued it myself.
3841. You would not be able to give any idea, roughly, of how many acres within the shire have
been depreciated in value?—No, because it varies in extent in different portions along the shire; I have
seen the main Murray Road on the way to Sandhurst quite covered over with it. In August, of this year,
the bank gave way, and the greater portion of the water went over.
3842. Would you describe the limits of the shire northward, and how far it goes beyon Goornong?d
—Beyond Elmore; Diggorra is the extreme end.
3843. llow far is that from here?—Thirty miles.
3844. Are you aware whether the deposit has reached there ?—No, I have had no complaints from
there.
3845. Have you had complaints from Goornong ? —No.
384 G. Then people are not in the habit of complaining ?—No. I believe the creek is deeper about
Goornong than here.
3847. Therefore the sludge is confined in the channel ?—Yes, I should think it remains there.
3848. Do you know it for yourself ? —No.
The witness withdraw.
William Clay recalled and further examined.
3849. The Witness. —As to mine waters, my opinion is this; from what I have observed at the mines
where a sluice is at the bottom. I was present on one occasion when this was let go. It is generally let
go at flood time, when there is rain; and when the first flood comes after a drought it is very thick.
3850-1. They open the sluices at the bottom of the dams?—Yes.
387)2. You have seen that done yourself ?—Yes.
3853. More than one case?—No, in one instance; but I heard from parties who wore connected
with those mines that there was a man told off to do it; but my observation is this in connexion with the
water that runs generally down in the creek where it is clear, that it is not in any way poisonous, in fact I
proved myself that it promotes the growth of grass; but when a flood comos, and it runs on the same ground,
this sludge being so thick, it rests on the grass, aiid,Avhcn the sun comes on,it binds it up; and this coming
repeatedly, it leaves a coat on the surface, and I believe, up to a certain extent, for a time, till it is fertilized
by the sun, it is poisonous.
3854. From your observation of the sludge brought down the creek after the first of the floods, you
believe it to be duo to opening the valves at the bottom ?—Yes; this is rcservod, and the creek is made so
perfect in the neighbourhood of Sandhurst by stone walls that, when it is not seen in Sandhurst, no remark
is made on it. I was six years a member of the Mining Board, and I was puddling as 'well, when there was a
general rate of £2 a quarter to maintain this sludge channel that was spoken of; this cost £(>,000 to make
it, and sometimes £420 to maintain it during the quarter; then they have all the deposit said to be thrown
on the banks come to Iluntly, at a certain place an old blind creek, and it was thought that would contain all the
sludge when it filled up. Well it filled up level up to the surface, and then the sun soon baked it up, and it
caked, and the next floods that came washed the entire of that out, and brought it down to a place further
down, so that there is really no use in depositing it in any place like that, because it is sure to move again.
But I may say that, if the puddlers had been left to themselves, they would have willingly retained this
sludge in the place, and take it out, if this tax was remitted. If that would be allowed; but, seeing that it
would destroy the creek in the neighbourhood of the town, this was strenuously maintained, and the quartz
miners had to contribute to the maintenance, and this is when and where the puddling ceased. Then about
Sandhurst this sludge channel fell into disrepair, and was discontinued. Of course, then the quartz miners
were allowed to put it into the creek, and facilities were given for them to do so. In New Chum Gully
the channel constructed by the municipal authorities was alwaj's full of sludge, bringing it into the creek,
and, when the storm came, it cleared the creek, and there was no complaint about it, and it was always
deposited here.
3855. In that instance whore you saw-the mining company discharging silt from the dam by a
bottom sluice, was it absolutely necessary to do that, or could they have retained that sludge on their
claim ?—I do not see why not. It would take a little more expense, that is.
385 G. Nothing serious ?—No.
The 20 it ness withdrew.
W. W. Watts sworn and examined.
3857. By the Board. —Have you been long resident here ?—Thirty-two years.
3858. What is your occupation ?—Hotel-keeper, farmer, and contractor.
3859. You own land here ?—Yes.
38G0. What do you wish to say on the sludge question ?—I wish to say a few words on the state of
the'Bendigo Creek. When I first came to this district it Avas a good flowing open creek, with deej) water-
holes, which one of the witnesses —I cannot say I saw it to the extent he did—seventy feet deep; but I
saw it fifteen and sixteen feet deep; along Mr. Rueditv’s property it was high situated; it was a deep fine
creek, with gum-trees growing on both banks.
38(51. What is the condition now?—Level up to the surface.
3862. Has that been going on steadily the last 30 years ? —Yes, but more so the last few years.
3863. It is ou the increase ?— lt is on the increase. About the sludge channel, you must not think
the sludge cnannel and the Bendigo Creek are the same; the sludge channel was in the old days, and that
Avas done aAvay Avith. It took the sludge aAvay to a certain extent ; but, after that time, the Bendigo Creek
steadily became silted up, and it has kept on so ever since.


38G4. Do you agree with the evidence given by the other witnesses ? —I do not think they exaggerated
in the least; I do not think they went far enough.
The witness withdrew.
John Tootell recalled and further examined.
3805. The Witness. —I would not like it to go abroad that we only want to get a sludge channel
made to run the sludge on to other people. Our object is to get a storm-water channel made to keep us
from being flooded, and, when that is done, to get settling ponds made to keep the sludge, and then clean
out the settling ponds; we have no wish to run it on others.
3860. By the Board. —Is that part and parcel of the proposition made to the Government for a
sludge channel?—lt has not been made to the Government, but I have always recommended it. It is to
keep our roads from being destroyed, and not for the purpose of running the sludge down to injure other
people.
The witness withdrew.
Adjourned.

WEDNESDAY, 27m OCTOBER, 1886.
Prcsetit:
R. 11. Shake spear, Esq., C.E., in the Chair;
A. F. Walker, Esq., | R. G. Ford, Esq.
Robert Jackson sworn and examined.
3807. By the Board. —You have the management of one of the mining claims in this district?—Yes,
the Neiv Chum and Victoria.
3868. That company has a battery ? —Yes.
3809. How many stamps ?—Fifty head.
3870. What quantity of water do you use per head ?—I think about sixteen gallons per hour—it is
rather more.
3871. llow many tons per week on the average do you crush?—Running full, we can put through
about 400 tons per week. It is a light battery. That is, running full time.
3872. What is the acreage of your lease ?—Fourteen or fifteen acres.
3873. Do you stack the tailings ?—The greater part of them.
3874. Do you use a tailings pump ?—Yes.
3875. When you say you stack the greater part of them, what portion of them do you stack ?
I think about two-thirds has been stacked up to this time. Since the company started we have crushed
altogether 129,118 loads of quartz. That will be about fifteen or sixteen years.
3870. And about two-thirds of that have retained ? —I just went over the tailings stack as we have
it at present. The total length of it will be something like 719 feet, the average about 123; that is, nine
drafts of the average height will be from 25 to 27, leaving a trifle less than 90,000 loads that there is
stacked there.
3877. You say you stack two-thirds of the quantity ?—We have been.
3878. What was the reason that the remaining one-third was not stacked?—ln the early days we
had got to be very particular about the water. In trying to conserve it, there is always a certain proportion
of the tailings, after it leaves the stamper, that is held in suspension in the water ; that you cannot very
well stack, for you cannot lift it, it has to lie in the settling pits till it gets firm, and it is far easier to send
it away, and much less expensive.
3879. Were you conserving the water, and re-using it, for your own purposes at the time that this
principal body of the tailings were stacked? —Yes.
3880. What was your object in stacking—was it to conserve water, to save ground, or to save the
creeks ?—Partly to save the creeks, at the time I speak of, and partly to save water. The creeks had not
been so well fossicked then as they have been of late years.
3881. Where do you obtain your water now ?—We have three large dams; partly from those and
partly from the Coliban.
3882. How do you fill the dams—where does the water come from that passes into the dams ?—lt
is the rain water we have been conserving. We have large drains, extensive drains.
3883. Do you endeavour to stack the tailings now as much as you did at the time that you required
the water for your own use ?—I cannot say that Ave are so particular about stacking them no ay.
3884. Have you a sluice at the bottom of the sludge dam ?—Yes.
3885. And do you open it ?—Yes.
3880. That, I suppose, is Avitli the object of getting aAvay the surplus of tailings ?—The slum, the
lighter particles of slum. We haA r e what Ave call the slum dam ; the Avater settles there partially. A
great many tailings go into that, no doubt, and we take advantage of the rains, and open this, and flood it
aAvay.
3887. Are your settling dams one or more ? —We ha\ r e tAvo.
3888. Do you pass Avater from one to the other ? —lt is lifted from the second one back into the
battery again, and used over and over again.
3889. Does the water become clear?—Not at all times ; it depends on the stuff Ave are crushing.
If there is a great deal of stuff held in suspension of course it is dicoloured.
3890. You say there Avould be a great expense incurred by the company if you stacked the remaining
third of the sludge?—Yes.


3891. What would the expense of stacking that extra third he? —It would have to be lifted out
with a ladle, and you could not, lift it out, it is so thin, it is like soup until the sun gets on to it and dries it.
3892. If the water is settling in the dams, does not the sun get to it and evaporate it sufficiently ?
The water is in a continual stream. It. leaves the tailings pump first into one pit; settles there partially,
and leaves that and goes into a second ; from that it is pumped back into the battery again.
3893. What is the proportion of the heavier tailings to this very light slum that is kept in suspension
in the water? —I should say from one-fourth slum to one-tliird of the total bulk of the tailings. The notes
I have got have been partly from tbe legal manager, and partly myself. I have given you the total of the
quartz crushed ; now the total of tailings stacked is 88,427 loads ; that we have stacked there ; that is
merely what you can see above the surface ; how far under it is I cannot say, but I understand, from what
I have seen of the gully myself in the early days, that it is from twelve to sixteen feet. Most of that
is under the surface.
3894. You open the sluice valve to let off I suppose the the surplus body of water ?—No, not tho
water, Ave want to save any water we can. But if we send the tailings Ave mußt send the Avater to carry
them aAvay.
3895. Why should it be necessary to send aAvay those tailings ?—You cannot lift them after they
get down there. The expense Avould be very great.
3896. Are not the tailings floating on the top of your settling dam; the Avater is floAving in at the top
of the dam ?—No, you cannot get on to the slum dam at all. Last year Ave made an affair of boards as
large as this table, to float tho slum aAvay. You Avould sink right out of sight if you Avent on to the slum
dam.
3897. What Avas the height of your slum dam?—l dare say tAventy-three feet from the Avater-
level.
3898. You see Avhatever difficulty there may be in retaining the Avater of the slum dam above
twenty-three feet, that same difficulty must have occurred Avhen you constructed the dam, of bringing it up
to tAventy-tlireo feet. What has prevented you alloAving more slum to settle there by raising the dam ?
I cannot say that I understand you.
3899. You say that you cannot retain the slum in the dam, because you cannot get on to the dam—
that the slum is too soft ?—The dam is in this position, that Ave have a door here, a flood-gate ; this will
only carry aAvay a certain proportion, and near the door. Then you must have a stream of water to Avash
this away.
3900. Why wash it away, Avhy not retain it ?—We Avant to keep a space to let the water go there.
We would not let the slum go there at all if Ave could keep it clear, but we cannot possibly do it.
3901. What special cause is there in your case that Avould prevent your retaining the slum and
keeping it clear, seeing that some other companies do ?—I do not knoAV of any in this district.
3902. The Duchess of Edinburgh, the South St. Mungo, the Lady Barkly, Clark’s, the Sebastian,
and some other companies do manage it ?—I think it is more the tailings than the slum, because Ido not
see how they can hold the slum back, unless there is some difference in the formation of their ground.
Ours is hidden also; the whole affair is surrounded Avith tailings, in some places thirty feet in height, and
the two dams lie right in the centre. The one is a settling pond ; the Avater flows from one to the other,
and Ave are obliged to run the slum away to get the Avater back.
3903. If you Avere dependent entirely on the Avater you can catch, Avould you still open those sluices
and let the water aAvay?—We should be obliged.
3904. Because you havm not room to stack ?—Yes, it is all surrounded Avith tailings.
3905. Have you raised your dams as high as you think they Avill bear raising ?—Yes.
3906. Hoav will you do in future—will you throw it all away ? Unless we can get space to evapo-
rate the Avater, and alloAv the slum to get firm; then it may be sluiced out.
3907. Shall you have the land on Avhicli to construct these additional sludge dams ?—We have no
land noAv; the reef is on both sides.
3908. Do you contemplate that you .will have to pass more sludge down the creek in the future and
not stack as much ?—lf A\ r e get the quartz we shall have to send aAvay as much as we can.
3909. That is entirely Avith you from the Avant of land ?—Yes.
3910. If you had the land what additional expense would the company incur in the retention of the
sludge —the one-third that you have been throAving aAvay ?—ln the course of time they would Avant to raise
the tailings pump, and that Avould raise the tailings heaps.
3911. That is in the far-off future, but what labour Avould it take to keep the banks in order ?—To
remove the 400 loads it would take two men per day and two at night, at tAvo guineas each, to do every-
thing.
3912. Is that what you pay noAv ?—We are doing very little at present. I have Chinamen there
now, and they hold back Avliat they can. I have got it let on tribute to a party of Chinese, so that avc have
not got to handle it all.
3913. Can you slioav us it since you let it to the Chinese—when were you last handling it your-
selves ? —About four years since.
3914. Going back that four years, Avhat Avas the cost to yourselves to maintain the bank ?—£4 ss.
a week, to four men.
3915. The maintenance of your dams, as they are hoav, cost £4 a week ?—Yes, the maintenance and
stacking of tailings—that is in full Avork.
3916. That must include more work than merely the difference of expense betAveen retention of that
extra third and your Avliole crushing ?—No, that was merely stoAving away the tailings.
3917. That Avas the retention of the whole tailings ?—Yes, and the slum had still to go into the
settling ponds.
3918. You did retain two-tliirds of the whole ?—Yes.
3919. And it cost £4 a Aveek ?—Yes.
3920. If you had retained the other third hoAv much would it have cost ?—That Avould be a
difficult question, as I have explained to you. We should require to evaporate the stuff.
3921. Are the Avhole fourteen or fifteen acres at present occupied?—Yes, by houses; we are sur-
rounded by streets. There is only a small portion of the lease occupied by the works of the company.
Sludge. p


3922. Why should you not draw off from the top what water is required to be drawn off, instead of
by sluice at the bottom ?—We would do that if possible, but all the heaviest particles fall to the bottom,
and they are so fine, they are like a paint, and we cannot get rid of them until it is dry again. If we could
throw it out and expose it to the sun it cracks into shales, the same as you have seen the alluvial slum.
3923. What depth of water do you keep in your slum dam?—When we run the slum off there will
be from 12 feet to 15 feet right down by the outlet. Of course it gets shallower as it gets away back—
perhaps 6 feet or 7 feet.
3924. But for the mere settlement of water for your own use ?—We always keep it as near level as
we possibly can.
3925. How many inches of water do you keep on the top of your slum before sluicing ?—Of course
the slum settling gradually raises the water to the top, and we run within 6 inches.
392 G. You find that is sufficient to settle ?—Not to settle it thoroughly.
3927. You say that your difficulty is your not having sufficient area of land to construct further
settling dams ?—By going to expense, no doubt we could make the tailings settle more—save more than a
third. We have three large pits on top; that is merely for the tailings, but then the slum is all drifted
away out of those. Unless the slum is forced out of those tailings you caunot handle them.
3928. Have you any remarks you wish to make on the subject ?—I have nothing further to say than
what I have said, but I think myself that the difficulty was started in the early days about the sludge question.
I do not think the tailings from the quartz mills do much damage, that is supposing the gullies have been
all clear of alluvial slum, for a pile of 100,000 tons looks very small when it is on the surface, and, if you
reckon the depth the rivers and creeks are, the slum that has gone down the creeks would have done very
little damage. But the evil is there, and the thing is to get rid of it.
The witness withdrew.
Arthur Paul sworn and examined.
3929. By the Board. —What company do you represent ?—The Fortune crushing works.
3930. How many head of stamps do you use ?—Forty-eight.
3931. Are they in constant work ?—Yes.
3932. How much do you put through in a week ?—A little over 600 tons.
3933. What quantity of water do you use in the week ?—I could not say.
3934. Is the water obtained from the mine ?—Some from the mine and some from the mains. That
does not go through my hands.
3935. What becomes of the water after it is passed through the battery ?—We work it over and
bring it back again.
3936. Do you stack your tailings ?—Yes.
3937. And you pass the water into sludge dams ?—Yes.
3938. One or more than one ?—Two.
3939. Does the water discharge from the second dam clear?—Pretty clear.
3940. Do you discharge water at all away from your premises ?—We do a little; there is slum, not
much clear Avater.
3941. Is that slum run off from the bottom of your sludge dam ?—Yes.
3942. During flood time, I suppose you raise the sluices and run the water off ?—Yes, perhaps
every three months or so.
3943. For what object do you run it off; is it to lessen the quantity on the claim ?—lt is very bad
for storing; it is like thin water when it is run off.
3944. Does not it settle if you give it sufficient time ?—lf you let it stand in the hot sun it would
dry in time.
3945. Then it is not the question of the area of the dam as to whether the stuff will settle out of
the water or not ?—But while the water is on the surface it will not settle.
394 G. You say you only flush out your dam once in three months?—Perhaps say two months. Wo
have two dams.
3947. Does the water settle during that two months —after settling in the dams for the two months ?
—We cannot do that. If we let it stand that way the slum would all remain in the dams.
3948. Is it not settled in that time ?—lt is nothing but thin slum.
3949. And does it not settle ? —No.
3950. What depth of water at the time you run off is there above the top of your tailings in the
dam ?—That is a point we can scarcely answer. When we see the water coming back very thick into the
main dam, then we run it off.
3951. You run the water simply because it gets thick ?—Yes.
3952. What objection would there be in your case to running it off from the top of the dam, instead
of by a sluice from the bottom —merely run the surface off ?—We do run it from the surface into the
main dam, to save the water.
3953. But when you sluice the dam, do you sluice it from the bottom or the top ?—We open the
flood-gate at the bottom, and let it go.
3954. That must carry away a large quantity of other tailings with it ?—No, it is nothing but fine
slum. We have three settling pits beside those.
3955. What area have you on the lease ?—I could not say; it is getting very small.
3956. Can you give us the area of your slum dams?—l suppose one is 12 by 8, 7 feet deep, and
the other is a regular round.
3957. You are talking of very small dams—l am talking of your large tailing dams ?—Yes, after it
comes from the settling pits it goes into those dams, and brings the water back.
3958. What is the size of the dams ?—These are only settling pits.
3959. I want the dams themselves?—The dam we run the water back into I suppose is about an
acre.
3960. Is there anything to prevent you extending the area—the size—of your main dams ?—We
could extend them largely.


3961. Why?—The bank is very high now to keep it; it is only a very small gully where we have
the main dam.
3962. You have no land available?—No.
3963. Can you say what is the proportion of the total tailings you crush to the finer slum that you
run off?—l should say that it would be a fiftieth part.
3964. Then you mean that you stack as much as forty-nine fiftieths of the total amount of crushing?
—I think so.
3965. Then you stack almost the whole of tho crushings?—Of course we do.
3966. And run away but very little ?—And run away but very little.
3967. Will you offer to the Board any suggestion that you think would be advisable?—l do not
think we can do anything more than Ave do; Ave stack all we possibly cau. But as far as this slum killing
anything goes, I think they are wrong on that point, because Ave have all Mr. LanseU’s foliage; it Avas on
the rocks, and it is only slum, aud it is as good as in any part of the colony. So the slum does not do harm
to that. And in the Avater there you will see thousands of gold-fish, so that slioavs that the mine water
does not kill fish. The mine water all round will breed gold-fish.
3968. The gold-fish are in dams into Avliich the Avater is passed with a very small amount of settle-
ment ?—Yes.
3969. And it does not seem to affect them?—No, and where the Avater from the mine comes in you
will see thousands of them. When they are washing from the wash-house, you will see them round the
soapsuds just the same.
3970. The vegetation is rich round those dams too ?—Yes, it is.
3971. When you run the water off from the mine, where does it go to— doAvn what course ?—New
Chum Gully.
8972, Does it run doAvn the sludge channel into the Bendigo Creek ?—Yes.
The witness withdrew.
George E. Thomson SAvorn and examined.
3973. By the Board. —Have you been engaged in mining in this district ?—Yes, since 1853. lam
not engaged in mining now. I Avas digging in 1853.
3974. The Board is given to understand that you have devoted a large amount of attention to the
sludge question, some years ago ? —Yes.
3975. What are your suggestions ?—The trouble appeared to be in connexion Avitli the sludge Avhen
the puddling machines Avere first here, and the mischief down at the creek arose, I think, from the fact that
there Avere 2,000 puddling machines at that time discharging slum down into the creek. The sludge
channel was constructed for that very purpose, to take it loAver doAvn the country. The great quantity that you
get now, the result of heavy rains, is the gradual washing doAvn of the silt that was throAvn up in the gullies
26 or 27 years ago. You can see it year by year gradually diminishing in height, all of Avliich finds its
Avay into the loAvest channel. If the suggestion that Avas throAvn out some years ago, of sowing gums,
had been adopted Avhile those gullies were raised, I believe it would have had the effect of arresting the
debris finding its way into the channels ; but that, of course, was not carried out. I do not see any
possible means of being able to prevent the sludge (if the sludge be the debris of old tailings) finding its
Avay in, and choking up more channels, of necessity.
3976. Do you consider that the Avhole of tho difficulty is owing to the Avorkings of the past, or is
the difficulty being added to by existing works ?—lt is being added to, no doubt, but in a very insignificant
way, compared to what it was.
3977. Have you given attention to the best method of preventing or mitigating the injury of- the
present, putting on one side that of the past ?—I do not think there is any remedy for it, except in the
stopping of the mines.
3978. I understood you had some suggestions to make?—No.
The witness withdrew.
John AgneAv SAvorn and examined.
3979. By the Board. —What company are you manager of? —Koch’s Pioneer.
3980. How many acres of land have you in the lease ?—Fifty-seven.
3981. Can you say hoAV many tons you crush in the Aveek ?—The number of tons Ave crush during
the Aveek varies considerably. We are crushing entirely for the public. Not more than 300 at present.
3982. Can you say lioav much by the year ? —We are crushing at present about 16,000 tons a year.
3983. Do you settle the tailings ?—We do.
3984. How many dams have you for settlement ?—Two, including the large flat surface on the top
of the tailings heap.
3985. Do you pass the water from one to the other ?—Yes.
8986. What is the result —do you obtain clear water in the last?—Perfectly clear water, quite as
clear as when draAvn from the dam.
3987. Do you find that the stacking of your tailings and slum causes a large expense to the com-
pany ?—Not so much with us as it would do with other companies, seeing we have such a large area to run
the tailings over.
3988. Do you Avork Avith a tailings pump ?—Yes.
3989. Will you give the sizes of the dams, 1,2, and 3 ?—Two and 3 Avould be about altogether 150
feet in length ; and No. I—that is, the top of the tailings heap—is about 250 yards in length by 80 in
width.
3990. Do you scour out at all ?—Only Avlien there is a flood on, to preserve the dams.
3991. Your object in scouring is simply to reduce the level of tho Avater, to save your dams ?
Quite so.
3992. Tha* drainage of a large area of ground passes across the storm-Avater channel and into your
ground ?—Yes,


3993. That, therefore, in flood-time brings a considerable quantity of water into your dam ?—Yes.
3994. If it were not for this flood water you would not have to relieve your dams ?—No, not relieve
at all.
3995. You have stacked the whole of your tailings —not passed anything away?—As far as we can.
399 G. That answer necessitates my asking what proportion of the total crushing you have retained?
—We have retained almost the whole, bar the water that goes away when the gates are opened to carry off
the storm water.
3997. What was the cause of your taking such care to store the water, and retain your tailings? —
For the purpose of using the water over again.
3998. What depth of water do you retain in the main dams ?—I think, in the main dams, something
like ten to fifteen feet.
3999. That is in your clear water dams ? —That is in the clear water dams.
4000. And in the settling dams ?—About ton feet.
4001. What quantity of Avater do you maintain in your first or tailings dam—how many inches ?
From eight inches to a foot. Wo have a large shallow surface.
4002. And you find it partially settles in that ?—Yes, the slum that settles in that we draw out to
the outer edge and the back, by scoops, and so keep raising the banks.
4003. In your case, how many men are employed solely for the purpose of raising the bank?—Two,
constantly.
4004. That amounts to what ?—Two Chinese, I might add, because the tailings are on tribute.
4005. What does that cost the company ?—lt does not cost the company but a very small trouble.
They receive a percentage from the amount of pyrites that they save. We pay them no wages.
4006. You are not using your pyrites works at present ?—No.
The ivitness withdrew.
Patrick Hayes sworn and examined.
4007. By the Board. —You are the mayor of the city ?—Yes.
4008. Can you give the Board any information as to any injury that has been caused to the bridges
and roads in the city? —Yes; our bridges, especially throughout the city portion, whero crushing is
in active work, suffered very severely this last ten or twelve years. In Ironbark G-ully alone there are
seven bridges affected by it; the main road, Mount Korong, there is a stone culvert that is nearly silted up,
and the damage from the silting is very serious; it is the expenditure we have to face on that road. But
coming down the creek to Wattle-street, the city council erected a new bridge there in 1876, and last
year it was quite silted up. We erected the bridge there to replace the one that was smothered up, at a
cost of £252, and we found fifteen feet of silt at the site of the bridge. Of course, when the bridge was
erected in 1876, ten years ago, it had a water-way of about seven feet, and in 1885 it was completely
smothered, sludge going over it, and over a considerable portion of the road, and we had to put a new
bridge there, and in putting down the piles we found sixteen feet of silt. The next bridge to it, Forest-
street, still in Ironbark Gully, was constructed about 22 years ago; it had then a water-way of seven or eight
feet, and we had to reconstruct it last year. It cost us £248, and wo found there seventeen feet of silt.
The next bridge, at Yiew-street, has about two or three inches of water-way there now. I suppose before
the summer is well on us it will be silted up. The same would apply to Millroy-street. Anderson-street
is even worse; you cannot detect any water-way there at all; and Arnold-street. All those are in Ironbark
Gully. The city council have provided £5OO to reconstruct those bridges at as early a date as possible.
It will cost us, the two wo have re-erected and those five we have to do, about £1,200; and the average
silt between Arnold-street and Yiew-street will be about sixteen feet; that is the damage that wo have to
face and make good in this one gully. Noav, going to Long Gully, that is in the northern portion of our
boundary, we have let a contract for reconstructing the Long Gully bridge, near the township of Long
Gully, for £2OO, and we find in digging for foundations that there are fourteen feet of silt there. Higher
up, in the Energetic-road, also crossing Long Gully, there is a bridge there with barely six inches of water-
way; that will have to be reconstructed this year; and at the Happy Yalley-road, going towards Sparrow-
hawk, we have a bridge actually smothered up with silt these two years, and as there is a road winding
about in another direction, we do not purpose to even recover it. The timbers have been there about
fifteen or sixteen years. Of course, we are so situated in Sandhurst that we cannot complain of the
expenditure in consequence of the silting of the sludge, because mining is the backbone of the city, and
we would rather make good those damages than harass the mining industry by prosecuting the mineowners.
We find it entails considerable expense on the council to make good the damages caused by this silting from
the mines.
4009. Do you find then that the injury is increasing yearly. The creeks are silting up, according
to your statement latterly ?—ln Ironbark Gully it is more noticeable, and in Long Gully than in any other
part. About three years ago we were threatened by silt coming down that drain, but we have walled the
Bendigo Creek; in fact it was spreading over the fiat, and we find when the water is confined within those
Avails that it throAvs it aAvay from us to do damage somewhere else.
4010. Have you ever had to take action against any company for causing unnecessary damage?—
Not these last ten years. I think avo did ten years ago, against Koch’s Pioneer Company. They had to
makegood the damage Ave Avere suffering from, by constructing a storm-Avater channel; that protected us
and them to some extent, and since then Ave thought it Avell to bear the expense and annoyance sooner than
to harass the mining industry.
4011. Have .any suggestions been made by the council at any time to the Government as to the
abatement or mitigation of the injury caused by tlie sludge ?—I am not aAA r are of any. There Avere
suggestions betAveen the council and the companies that it should be stacked, but Ave find in the slopes,
Avliere there is a good Avater fall, it is impossible to retain tbe silt in spite of all they can do; it Avill find its
Avay into the Avater-courses.
4012. But if the sluices are not opened at flood time to let the water out, the mere quantity that
washes away from the slopes into the Avater-courses Avonld not seriously interfere Avith your creeks and
bridges, would it ? —I think so. Ido not knoAV what appliances they have for retaining the sludge, but I


know, in the case of the larger claims, that after rain wo find the sides of the large creeks silting up with
a lot of the sludge, and where water does escape from the tops of the dams, that is washed away by the
small currents; and yet we find the creeks silting up after rain.
4013. Do you know Myer’s Creek ?—Yes, a portion of it.
4014. You know there are some larger dams situated on the head —there is the Duchess of Edin-
burgh and other claims ?—I do not know tho dams.
4015. Eaglehawk ?—They would have no dams at Myer’s Creek.
4016. Yes, they have. I was going to say the creek there is perfectly clear, and if not there, why
produce the injury in Sandhurst? —It Avill be near the head of Myer’s Creek, and would not have a large
water fall there. The creek is very small. It would be more of a gully; and then the creek winds away
from the source of the mining at Eaglehawk. It would go in a northerly direction, and, therefore, though
they have the head of the creek dammed, yet it will incline away from the course of mining, and for that
reason would escape being silted, whereas, in Sandhurst, our creek runs directly through it.
4017. Have you any suggestions or remarks you would like to make, in addition to what you have
said ?—No; it is a troublesome question, and really we do not know how to cope with it. We hope it is in
good hands to be remedied.
4018. The only chance of getting a remedy is to get the fullest possible information as to all the
different systems ; that is the object of tho Board ?—There is also, in Golden Gully—it is about four miles
from here in the extreme southern portion of our city —a bridge silted up from the sludge from the mining
there. Of course, all those things are washed down our water-course, and are an annoyance to us in the
-city.
4019. Golden Gully mines are abandoned ? —Some are.
4020. And there is a very large body of silt in the creek at present ?—Yes; and near the head of the
creek we have a bridge there that has very little water-way, and some years ago it had five or six feet, and
now it has only five or six inches.
4021. You have two roads that actually form sludge dams, that are keeping the sludge in the creek.
Has it occurred to you, supposing dams were constructed, and proved satisfactory in the making, what
course could be adopted to maintain them, after the companies have ceased to work ?—No, I do not think
we have ever seriously considered that.
4022. Golden Gully is an example of that, because there is a large quantity of silt, and there is no
one to look after it, and gradually it is coming down the main channel ?—Yes, we find it affects us in the
flood time in the city, the stored silt.
The tvitness withdrew.
Carl Roeder sworn and examined,
4023. By the Board. —You are connected with the mining industry ? —I am.
4024. In what capacity ? —I was 27 years mining manager for crushing works.
4025. Will you mention which?—l started with the Endeavour Company, subsequently amalgamated
with other claims, and called the Victoria Consols Company.
4026. Have you any suggestion you would like to make to the Board ?—I quite agree with several
mining managers here that it is literally impossible to stack the liquid slum. Of course, although it is said
that it would get dry, it would take six months to dry those slum dams, and then it would be difficult.
The greatest difficulty is that we are so limited with our area of land; the mining companies on those
principal mines, where the most mischief of slum does arise, have, perhaps, from 100 to 300 yards of land
in length, so they cannot construct dams; they must run the slum away, because they have not the area;
and if they were to raise it up (perhaps it has never occurred to you) or dam it back, it would throw the
sludge on the surrounding mines and the freehold property, which is because the country is so flat there.
There is one thing in answer to Mr. Hayes; he said one of the roads of the Sparrowhawk was completely
lost; that was principally lost from the heap of tailings that have been stacked up, and generally with the
crushing machine there, and, from the continual rain and so on, it washed that heap of tailings on the road.
4027. Is the company still there ?—Yes.
4028. Was it not the fault of the company if the rains were allowed to wash so much as to injure
the road?—lt sunk away. It is a height above the road; a portion of that and the storm washed those
tailings completely on that road. And, as regards the bridges you see from Thompson’s round, he said
that they would naturally wash into the gullies again. Now those bridges were constructed formerly in the
gullies, after the alluvial was taken out. They were put level on the original surface, and this silt that
Mr. Hayes speaks of is simply an accumulation to come to its natural level again. The gullies where the
bridges are constructed, the new ones, the silt is not so high as the original alluvial ground is. The gullies
were puddled out to a certain depth, the bridges were constructed, and, naturally, when the de'bris and slum
from the puddlers came down the gullies, it naturally got to the original level of the surface again.
4029. You say so many of the companies have insufficient land on which to stack their tailings ?
Yes.
4030. Do you know any instance of a company having insufficient land that has made arrangement
with another company whereby they obtained room ?—With freeholders, freehold properties. Ido know that
every company that I represented then, six or seven years ago, there was a piece of land held by them on
the other side of the creek, freehold, and we were continually at Avar with them, and at last we had to come
to some arrangement. We had to buy one-lialf of the land—it Avas rising land from the creek; but the
other upper half they still retain.
4031. Did you get rid of the difficulty ?—Only as far as this particular low spot was concerned.
4032. You did throw your tailings on the fresh ground ?—Yes.
4033. Did the company continue to Avork ?—They are A\ r orking now.
4034. Did it not press on the company so heavily as to hamper the mining ?— No; they will threaten
us to sue for damages. We have also bought out from this area tho land Avliich we hold there, from about
four or fNe different residents avlio occupied the land by miner’s right. We have a prior right in order to
accumulate as many tailings as possible; but Avherever the sludge in itself is concerned, really how can tha 1
be stacked and retained, because it is all the liquid stuff ?
4035. Wliat Avas the proportion of slum to the tailings ?—About one-quarter or a fifth,


4036. According to that, you could stack four-fifths; but you think you could not stack the other
fifth ?—I think that slum is a necessary evil. Ido not think the slum could ever be stacked. I see by the
paper the talk about the floods in Epsom in 1855 or 1856, that they had the biggest flood we ever had, and
since that we have been working there, this time in discharging this silt there, and I have not heard of any
more floods now than what there was then.
4037. Have you anything further you wish to say ? —I have not. As I say, my opinion is it is a
necessary evil. Of course, the complaint is that the land has become valueless; but really the land has
become valuable through the mining that is carried on.
4038. It is not a question of hampering the mining industry in any possible way. The object is to
ascertain whether there is any means of mitigating the evil ?—What I would like to point out is that it is
almost impossible to stop the tailings. I admit it is a grievance, but, at the same time, it is literally impos-
sible; and even, as the Mayor pointed out to you, in connexion with the damages, that we have tried to do
the best we can in those cases, but it is literally impossible to do it. You mention those companies over in
Eaglehawk, who conserve their tailings, and have only started about eighteen months ago. You would find,
if they were working so long as those companies, from the earlier period that I mentioned, that their ground
would be all occupied—that they would have to run them away just as well.
4039. On the other hand, the Koch’s Pioneer has been working a considerable time ?—Yes; they
send their tailings down the gully, on the side, although they have the privilege of opening it when a heavy
rain comes, and then it washes it all empty again for another flood to fill again.
The witness xvithdrew.
John Harvey sworn and examined.
4040. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—Mining manager.
4041. Of what claim ?—The New Chum United.
4042. How many head of stamps have you ?—Twenty-one.
4043. In constant work ? —Not just now, but for the last seven years they have been pretty constant
until the last few months.
4044. How many tons do you put through in the year ? —When in constant work, about 210 tons
per week.
4045. How much water do you use ?—Our water is so often worked over ; we have scarcely had to
buy any at all for the mine. We have a big drainage area there, and it comes into the dam from the large
space round.
4046. You have more than one dam?—One main dam and one settling dam.
4047. You run first into your main dam ?—The water carried from the hills goes into the main dam,
then it goes from there into the battery, worked with the tailings, and goes up on the tailings heap, pumped
up forty-eight feet through the tailings pump. Then we have the surface of the tailings, about three-
quarters of an acre to an acre over ; that drains over it. The heaviest of the sand is settled there, and the
light slum, of necessity, goes down into the settling dam.
4048. Do you discharge the lighter slum ?—That slum dam contains, I suppose, about 5,000 gallons
of water, or a little more—that settles it. In settling it varies. In every case it carries more or less of
the slum down for three or four or five weeks, and at the end of that time the slum settles so much that it is
quite full, and the water from that goes into the other dam, and carries a certain quantity of slum with it
into the main dam. That is filling up gradually, but this takes off the bulk of the settlement into the sludge
dam.
4049. Do you discharge mine-water from the slum dams outside your premises? —We let it go into
the gully. Our main dam is fixed right in the New Chum Gully; we let it out of the slum dam right into
the part of the gully below our main dam. That is let go. It varies—sometimes three weeks and some-
time five or six weeks —that slum that settles into the sludge dam, and the water that it contains, goes out,
perhaps, in three or four hours, and then we stop it; and it has to fill up again before we let it go again.
4050. You want all the water you can get?—We store it all, to get all the water we can.
4051. What is your object in discharging into the gully? —If we did not discharge into the gully,
when it gets full, as a natural consequence all the settlement would go back into the main dam,, and fill up
there quickly.
4052. What would be the harm there?—lt would drive us to the necessity of running water from
the mine to keep our battery going, or re-construct the dam or clean it out.
4053. Y r ou think the dam would fill too quickly? — Yes, it is filling very quickly; that is our trouble
now. We have a dam about two acres over, and we have not got more than half the size noAV, because
there are sluicers up the gully beyond us. They raised the surface, and, when the rain comes, it fills up our
main dam.
4054. Then with you, as with many others, it is a question of money?—lt is a matter of convenience
as well as money.
4055. What is the proportion of tailings and slum in the whole of your crushing? —Of course, I could
not test exactly, but I should say approximately not more than one-fiftieth part of our crushing would go
down—not more than that.
4056. You retain forty-nine fiftieths?—Yes; it is a very slight amount'we send away. Of course,
it depends on the situation of mines, how they are for stacking ; some are better off for it, and, as other
witnesses said, we have not got room to construct two or three or four, or one big, and two big enough of
those settling dams to turn the water into others while the other slum is drying up, because the inhabitants
are all round us, so there is not room.
4057. What would be the inconvenience to you if your water was drawn off entirely from the top of
the dams, and not by the sluice at the bottom ?—lt would be no earthly purpose; it would only carry off
the top of the water, and then after a week instead of five we should have to let go the top. Our settling
dam now is about seven feet deep. If you leave off, say two feet of that, it would only have the two feet
to fill up, whereas now we have the seven feet to fill up when it is all clear, and that, as a consequence,
takes down a great deal more settlement, and the water goes back, and. the main dam is much clearer.


4058. I do not see how you would lose the clearer, better settled water, because that is on the top ?
—Yes; but you must remember that when you have a hole seven feet deep, and take off from the top of
that into the main dam, or having a hole two feet deep, and take off from the top of that, you are taking
the clear water away clearer from the seven feet than you are from the two.
4059. What is the size of your dam ?—The slum dam is about thirty feet wide and about forty or
forty-five feet long.
4000. What depth of water does it require to settle—it does not require full seven feet for that?—
It would settle if it was only three or four feet ; but there is a continual current coming into it all the time,
and by having it three feet deep or four feet the water would naturally cause a greater stir and turmoil in
that than it would if I have seven feet to fill into, and with all the depth of seven feet our water sometimes-
goes into the main dam very dirty.
4061. The object of what I ask is, as long as there are bottom sluices, and the dams are emptied out
from those, there is literally no check on the quantity of stuff that might be taken away ; whereas, if
taken from the top, you get the clear water, and at the same time you cannot force away such a large
quantity of material down the creeks ?—There is no difference in that, in this way—the soft slum that
settles is confined to a certain space; when that is all gone no more goes, the hard will not come out —all
around the stuff is hard, and that does not come out; and if you got there a place to hold 5,000 gallons that
is only full of water and slum, and that will stand four or five weeks. If you have only one that will hold
2,500 gallons you have to run that off twice, whereas you run the other once, and by having the thing
deeper we have a better chance of getting it clear.
4062. Do you have much mine-water to contend with ?—Yes, a large quantity just now.
4063. Not as much as you require to keep the batteries going?—No, we let it go. What Ave get
from the mine, and what we catch from the surface, we can do Avith by saving up carefully. In summer
time, the summer before last, avo had to get some in from the Specimen Hill race, but last summer Ave had
none at all, but it is rarely we have to get any Avater; but the same thing as regards the filling up of the
creeks applies to the sluicers, and those men that Mr. Hayes said that loosening the stuff around on the flat,
on the borders of the gullies, when the heavy Avater comes it carries it right down into it, and there is no
chance of stopping it. We are troubled by the parties sluicing above us. When the rain comes, the
temporary bank is carried aAvay, and light sluicing-stuff comes doAvn into our dam, and fills it up. That
often occurs with us noAv.
The witness withdrew.
George N. Craig SAvorn and examined.
4064. By the Board. —You are connected with mining ?—Yes. ,
4065. In what capacity ?—Legal manager.
4066. Of many mines ?—Yes, several.
4067. Would you state the names of the principal ?—Garden Gully United, Carlisle, and the Garden
Gully Consolidated. Those are the only three that are crushing.
4068. Have you any information you wish to place before the Board on the subject of the sludge ?
—No. I came because I was asked by the Board.
4069. There is no use troubling you if you have nothing to say ?—I have no suggestions to make.
The witness withdrew.
William H. Grainger SAvorn and examined.
4070. By the Board. —What is your position?—lnspector of Mines for the Sandhurst district.
4071. Will you give the Board the benefit of your knoAvledge, gained in your position as Inspector
of Mines, on this subject of sludge ?—Yes. I Avould prefer to ans Aver any questions that you may ask.
4072. You have heard the questions asked the other Avitnesses as to stacking tailings ?— Yes.
4073. You heard some Avitnesses state that they stacked forty-nine fiftieths of the total quantity of
the stuff crushed, others state that they cannot stack more than four-fifths, others even less, Avliat is your
opinion of the matter —can the companies stack Avithout serious expense ?— I think both those statements
may be right—it is the position of the tailings catchments that has to do Avith it altogether—some are in more
favourable positions for saving than others. With regard to the question of Avhether it could be entirely
stacked, I think it could be; it is a matter entirely of cost. I knoAVone casein point, Avhere it has been done
so—complaints were made about it, and steps Avere taken, and they have done so.
4074. What is the name? — The Virginia, and I may explain the cause of it. There had been com-
plaints in the past, by some residents living near, of the tailings coming down on their allotments, but the
chief cause that led up to it Avas that their tailings Avater was fighting its Avay through the ground
into the Specimen Hill United mine, and the complaints from that mine led up to steps being taken. The
Department submitted it to me, and I gave a suggestion as to hoAV it could be remedied, Avliicli I will
describe. They had a very fair-sized area of catchments of tailings both north and south of their crushing
plant, and on the north side I suggested that a large dam, bank pretty high, should be made, and that the
sludge for the season should be alloAved to run there, and lodge there, that after getting the summer heat and
sun it would cake. They succeeded in doing that, and it stopped the Avater percolating through the ground,
and thence the complaints Avere stopped from the adjoining mine, and it ansAvered the double purpose.
4075. It answered satisfactorily?—lt did, and that demonstrated that the sludge could be stowed,
but it is a mere matter of expense.
4076. Was it a matter of serious expense to the company ?—I think it was a considerable expense;
but look at the Koeh\s Pioneer, it is Chinese they have, but if they make arrangements Avith the Chinese to
get labour or gold in return for this it amounts to the same in regard to the cost of the company’s working.
4077. Does any very large quantity, do you think, flow doAvn the creek, owing to the practice of
opening the sluices at the bottom during flood time ?—No question about that, there is a considerable
amount going down. I can see it, especially after flood time, but it is ahvays going down less or more
when they open the sludge dams.


4078. Do you regard the existence of sluice-boxes at the bottom of the dams as an actual necessity, or
could the water be drawn off two or three or four feet, or something like that from the top ?—The question
of regarding it as an absolute necessity is a very broad one—by doing that, it would so handicap mining that
I think it would be a very serious affair.
4079. It will handicap them to make them draw it from the top ?—Yes.
4080. In what way ?—They would have to stack it, their sludge and all.
4081. You think that is the ground ?—The principal ground, and mine owners and managers are
aware of that, too.
4082. If the mines were not enabled to sluice away all their slum, it would materially hamper the
mining industry ?—lt would materially hamper the mining industry.
4083. Yet you have instanced one company that does not, and we have had evidence of two others
that do actually stack ? —There is any amount of Koch’s goes down; and as to some being in a position,
I have explained that, owing to the position of some of the tailings dams. They are more favourably
situated for stacking than others. There is always a large percentage will find its way down in stormy
weather, with wind as well as rain. There is always a certain percentage of washings that will go into
the creek.
4084. What have wind and stormy weather to do with turning the water out of the dams into the
creek ?—Not at all; but, in spite of all the precautions, some will find its way.
4085. Do you know the instances of the Duchess of Edinburgh, at the head of Myers* Creek, and
the Lady Barkly and South St. Mungo on the other side ?—Yes, I know the position.
4086. The water leaves their dams clear ?—Yes.
4087. The Myers’ flat has not silted ?—No, but there have been some complaints there years ago.
4088. But not now ?—No.
4089. If done in other places, does not that convince you that the slum can be stacked ?—Yes, but
you understand they have a very large area there. Ido not know, any place where they have such a large
area as there.
4090. If land is obtainable still, the slum can be stacked ?—I think there is a possibility. I say it
will be materially against the mineowners to do it, but it can be done.
4091. The loss to mineowners would be the loss of obtaining land ?—There are many so situated
that land is not to be obtained.
4092. But it is in that direction that the loss will be, that they have not land enough ?—I think that
would be the serious part of it.
4093. Do you know the case of any company that, not having land of its own, flumes across the land
of another company, and uses their dams ?—I believe the United Devonshire has made arrangements with
the Duchess of Edinburgh to that effect. I see they are putting up a flume there.
4094. Does not that show that, if it becomes a necessity for a mining company to stack, they will make
the necessary arrangements ? —I do not know that it follows, unless by legislation. That is more a matter
that they would mutually agree amongst themselves.
4095. They could not carry on their workings unless they did ?—But it is a question whether they
could compel the other party to come to terms at all with the different claims.
4096. When that company found themselves in a difficulty—in that case they did so?—ln that case
they came to terms. Ido not know what they were.
4097. Have you, with your knowledge of the district, formed any idea in your own mind as to how
the evil of the sludge can be mitigated, if not done away with altogether ?—To stack all that possibly can
be done.
4098. Do you consider that the mines in your district do stack, at the present, all they possibly can ?
—I think they do very well all they possibly can. It is a very difficult thing to say. I think they do very
well. I think it is the desire of every manager to stack as much as he reasonably can. They all take
advantage of the storm water, less or more, to clear it off, and pass the damage on to some one else.
4099. Does not the difficulty hinge on that—how far the companies can afford to make arrange-
ments by which they should not have to sluice out so much ?—That comes back to the former question,
that it will considerably handicap mining. I quite agree with Mr. Hayes, that the beginning of the injury
was done many years ago by the puddling machines. I had experience of that thirty years ago, and about
more than four-fifths was carried away then —the alluvial washed away, and whole gullies were washed oiit
of the flats. In our tailings, we scarcely got a fifth part, and even that eventually got washed into the
gullies. We started them at the side, and they got washed away, so I think that the primary cause of the
complaint is the puddlers in the early times.
4100. Do you consider that the loose stuff from former workings is being carried down the channels
year by year ?—There are always loose washings going down—the rain washes a large percentage of the
loose stuff down.
4101. I am speaking of the old workings ?—Yes, from that also.
4102. Confine yourself entirely to the mining business, not as to banks of creeks being cut up by the
rain ?—That is what I am doing.
4103. What proportion is the damage from the washing down of old mines to the evil being now
continued by the existing mines ?—I think the damage was done formerly by old mining, but it is not per-
petuated now. I thing the injury now is from the quartz crushing.
4104. Have you any idea what proportion that bears to the injury done by the old workings?—
I could not say, but I think of the two the first did the larger amount of injury.
The witness withdrew.
Adjourned to Eaglehawk, at Three o'clock.


( Taken at Eaglehawk.)
WEDNESDAY, 27th OCTOBER, 1886.
Present:
R. H. Shakespeah, Esq., in the Chair;
A. F. Walker, Esq., | R. G. Ford, Esq.
Edward Toy sworn and examined.
4105. By the Board. —You are a mining manager here?—No, lam not. lam here as the mining
manager’s representative. lam the engineer of the.company.
4106. What company do you represent ?—The St. Mungo Gold Mining Company.
4107. Do you know the area of lease of the St. Mungo Company ?—No.
4108. How many stamps have you got ?—Thirty.
4109. And how many tons do you crush?—Eight hundred and sixty, and up to 870 tons a
fortnight.
4110. Where do you obtain the water from ?—We get part of it from the mine, and portion of the
rain-water. That we catch; and a portion, when we run short, we buy from the Government race.
4111. The mine-water is insufficient in itself ? —Yes.
4112. Can you tell what quantity of water you use per head ? —No, I could not.
4113. Can you tell the proportion of tailings and slum to the total quantity you crush ?—No; it
would be a hard matter to arrive at that.
4114. Do you stack the tailings?—We stack all the tailings.
4115. In one or more dams ?—ln one dam.
4116. Do you stack that for the purpose of conserving water ?—Yes.
4117. Do you pass any of the slum down the creek ?—Yes, a portion of it.
4118. You have no idea what the proportion is you pass down ?—Well, we have a dam that we run
off once in three or four weeks, and that would be from 30 to 40 cubic yards when it is full, and that is all
we run down the creek.
4119. By what depth is it ?—Three feet deep.
4120. In what condition is the water after settling in the dam?—Clear; that is, in our main water
dam. It is clear there.
4121. And you clear it in the one dam only ?—That is all.
4122. Has any complaint been made, do you know, to the company with regard to their system of
working and discharging any slum into the creek ?—No, we have never had any complaints since we started;
three years ago last September since we started the batteries
4123. You discharge in California Gully ?—No, Eaglehawk Gully.
4124. Can you say what the expense to the company is of stacking their sludge ?—lt is no expense
at all to the company, because the tailings are let to Chinamen, and the Chinamen have to look after the
tailings and the sludge for what they can get out of the tailings.
4125. You use a tailings pump, I suppose ?—Yes.
4126. Have you a sluice from the bottom of your sludge dam ?—Yes.
4127. Ido not understand quite. Have you a service water dam ?—We have a service water dam
to contain our water for battery purposes, and then the tailings-pump lifts the tailings from the batteries,
and discharges it into the dam. That we get for the tailings, and then the water we get from there goes
into another small dam for catching the sludge, so as to clear the water before it goes into the main dam,
and when that is full we have been in the habit of running it down by the creek.
4128. By a flood-gate at the bottom ?—A flood-gate put in the end of the sludge dam; we lift that
and let it go away.
4129. That is in the bottom of the dam ?—Yes.
4130. For what purpose do you run slum away from the dam —is it to lessen the quantity of material
in the face, or to get rid of the excess of surplus water ?—No, to get rid of the sludge.
4131. What would be the difficulty, in your case, of retaining the sludge?—Want of room; we have
only got about an acre of ground to store our tailings on.
4132. How often do you run that away ?—From three to four weeks.
4133. The Eaglehawk Gully just below your works is free of sludge ? —Yes.
4134. Where has that gone—is it flushed away by the storm-water ?—lt goes through the town here
through the creek, and goes right away down. There is a puddling machine just below us, and they run away
as much sludge as we do.
4135. What depth of water do you find necessary to retain in the dam in order to store the water ?
That is our main water dam ?
4136. Yes ?—When it is full there is about eight to ten feet of water in it.
4137. What depth of water do you retain in your tailings, from the water that runs into the surface
dam ?—The tailings dam. We do not retain any; it passes right into the sludge dam, and then Avhen that is
full we run it aAvay.
4138. Are there any other companies alongside of you carrying out the work in the same manner ?
Ido not think there is one. The Lady Barkly have got a large dam for retaining their sludge in, and that
is not full yet; that is just for their main water dam—a very large dam—and they have been running it in that
about eight or nine months, and that is not full yet. For the machines above us I cannot answer, but Ido
not think they run any down the creek; they have more room; they are trucking their tailings away; and some
are trucking their tailings down the mine.
4139. When you say you have no room, what is the area of your lease?—l said I did not know how
much, but. our tailings lease is just about an acre.
4140. Is that all you have ?—Yes.
4141. Is it shut in by buildings ?—By our own dam and the Lady Barkly dam.
Sludge. q


4142. With tlie South St. Mungo; there is a battery there?—That is a joint battery, between the
South St. Mungo and the Lady Barkly.
4143. Then what you said about the Lady Barkly applies to the South St. Mungo ?—Yes.
4144. At present, they are not discharging any down the creek ?—Not that I am aware of.
4145. In your sludge dam what water have you ?—Three feet deep and about forty yards square, and
when it is full of water it is clean water, but as the sludge is accumulating in that, so it fills up with
sludge, and we run it off.
4146. And you retain none in your tailings dam ?—That is where we lodge our tailings. We keep
no water there, and we keep as much of our sludge round that as we possibly can, to form a bank of that
dam, because tailings of themselves would not make much of a bank, because the water would go through,
and we would lose our water, and as our tailings rise so we must raise our banks.
4147. Do you know of any company not having land to stack the whole of its sludge, that discharges
its slum by agreement on to any other lands ?—No, not that I am aware of.
4148. Is there any vacant land anywhere within reasonable roach of your claim ?—I do not think
there is. We are cut off below our dam bank by the lease that Mr. Clark holds, just below us; and on the
southern end of our dam the Lady Barkly cuts us off, and on the other end is our water-dam, so that we
are confined altogether for room.
4149. Have you any remarks that you would like to make to the Board on this question; the object is
to see if there is any means of mitigating the mischief ? —lf we are doing any mischief at all, the only thing
we can do is to stop it.
4150. Do you consider you are creating any mischief?—l cannot say ;it is such a small quantity
we do run away, once in three or four weeks —thirty to forty square yards of sludge.
4151. What do you mean by “ stop it ” —in what sense ?—We would have to see what we could do—
see if we could get some more ground somewhere.
4152. Would it be possible? —At the present time, I do not see where we could.
4153. By an arrangement with any other company to take your sludge further off—is it possible ?
On the western boundary of our lease —it is a very high hill—there is any amount of ground there, but we
could not carry it up there with fluming, and I told you about the other sides.
The witness withdrew.
Frederick Clark sworn and examined.
, 4154. By the Board. —What is the company of which you are the manager ?—The Beehive Crushing
Works.
4155. Into what gully or creek do you discharge ?—I have not discharged any for some years.
I have been stacking the tailings for some years.
4156. To what creek or gully is your natural discharge, if any water leaves you—into what creek
does it go ?—Well, into Myers’ Creek; but formerly, when I stacked on the other side of the hill, the
Eaglehawk.
4157. How many stamps have you ?—Sixty head.
4158. How much do you crush in the week ?—About 700 tons.
4159. Have you any idea of the quantity of the water you use ?—I use what we can get from the
ordinary rainfall, and I take about an average of 650,000 gallons a month from the Water Department all the
year round.
4160. What is the quantity of water per head that you consume ?—I cannot say that.
4161. Do you stack your tailings ?—Yes.
4162. And your slum ?—Yes, both.
4163. Can you give any idea of what proportion the slum is to tailings?—lt depends entirely on
the nature of the quartz you are crushing; if the quartz is free from mullock, there would not be much
slum, and vice versa.
4164. Is there much more difficulty in dealing with the mullocky slum than the ordinary quartz ?
It requires a larger surface to settle the water.
4165. How many dams have you ?—Two.
4166. How many dams for the conservation of water?—Three water dams.
4167. And how many tailings dams ?—Two.
4168. And any sludge or settling dam besides ? —No; one of those I call tailings dams is for sludge.
4169. Do you pass the water from one into the other ?—Yes, and then into the water dams.
4170. Can you give the area of those dams at all ?—The last one is about an acre and a half—the
last sludge dam; the tailings dam, I suppose, covers three or four acres.
4171. And you find that you can use all the water that you pass out of your dams ?—Yes.
4172. And in what condition does that water settle—is it clear ?—Pretty clear; we get it as clear
as we possibly can.
4173. Do you find that the stacking of the slum is an expensive course to the company ? —No, not
very expensive; it is simply a question of getting room. I think if any person has plenty of room, that is
the only difficulty.
4174. Can you give an idea of what amount of labour you have to employ in making up the dam
banks ?—lt costs me about £3 a week.
4175. You have room ?—Yes.
4176. Then you actually do not send anything away ?—No, I have not done so for about five years.
4177. Have you any sluices at the bottom of your dams?—No.
4178. Supposing you had to send water away in consequence of heavy rains, the access of water
tending to fill up your dam, how do you get rid of that ?—lt flows over the by-wash.
4179. You take it off the top ?—Yes.
4180. What depth of water do you keep in your first tailings dam ?—A few inches.
4181. And in the second ?—ln the sludge dam we try to keep six inches of water above the
sediment.
4182. You find that enables you to settle the sediment ?—'Yes.


4183. And your water dam ?—One is about nine feet, and another is about six, and another about
five feet; we have had some rain lately, and it has filled all the dams up.
4184. Have you any information that you would like to give the Board, any suggestions as to the
general question of stacking tailings ?—Yes, I have thought many times that it is certainly a great con-
venience to mineowners where they can run the sludge away down the creek, supposing they have no
room to stack, or they find it cheaper to run the sludge away.
4185. It is always cheaper?—Yes.
4186. But provided there is room to stack it, is the question of the mere labour one whether it would
seriously affect or hamper the mining industry ?—I have not found it so; but I was going to remark that,
admitting that the landowners have suffered damage by sludge being run away, I think that could be pre-
vented, in a great measure, by the Government proclaiming sludge reserves, for between Eaglehawk and
Epsom there is a large extent of old alluvial workings on which no working has gone on for years. If a
sludge reserve was put there, and the bank maintained at small cost, it would hold all the sludge from those
dams for many years.
4187. Have you considered the question of who would construct and maintain such a bank?—l
think if the matter was taken up by mineowners, it Avould not take much to erect it.
4188. Subscribe it among themselves ? —Yes, the same as many years ago, when-there was puddling
going on, there was a sludge board appointed, and a small assessement made to maintain the channels.
4189. And fill the old workings ?—Yes.
„„ 4190. I see, from my notes, that your arrangements seem to have been very satisfactorily carried
out, notwithstanding that there is a large admixture of slate to deal with, so you are in a worse position
than some others ?—Mine is nearly all public crushing. It depends altogether on the mine it comes from—
sometimes the quartz is much cleaner than at other times.
4191. You use a tailings pump? —Yes, I send the tailings up 54 feet high.
The ivitness withdrew.
Churchill Davidson sworn and examined.
4192. By the Board. —What company do you represent ?—The Catherine Reef United Claim
holders* Gold Mining Company.
4193. How many years have you been manager ?—A little over seven years.
4194. How many stamps do you use ?—Sixty-four head.
4195. Have you any idea of the quantity of water you use for them?—Three hundred gallons an
hour per stamp.
4196. Can you give us the area of your lease ?—Fifty odd acres altogether.
4197. How many acres of that do you occupy for the purpose of stacking sludge and tailings ?—For
sludge, I think, about tliirteen to fourteen acres.
4198. You do stack the sludge ?—Yes, we store it all.
4199. Do you store it for the purpose of obtaining water for your own uses, or with a view of not
allowing the sludge to pass into other lands ?—With a view of not allowing the sludge to pass into other
lands, because we are obliged to.
4200. How is it you are obliged to ?—On account of the parties down Myers’ Flat complaining.
The company some years ago were let in for considerable expense for running down the sludge. It ran
doAvn the gully, and over some land, and it cost the company something like £l,OOO.
4201. An action was taken against the company ? —An action was taken against the company, and
they got judgment against them, and it cost nearly £l,OOO.
4202. And, in consequence of that action, you have now stacked your tailings and sludge ?—Yes,
always since. They did at the time as much as they could. Of course, there is a certain amount of sludge
will run away in heavy storms.
4203. You say you stacked as much as you could then—have you not stacked more since that action?
—We got a lease purposely of nearly ten acres to store the sludge, after it left everywhere, and made a dam
across the gully, and stored it there.
4204. How many dams have you, and what is your system of passing the water from one to the
other ?—We have two reservoirs for water, and three dfferent places for storing the sludge.
4205. Three different dams ?—Yes.
4206. Do you pass the water from one to the other ?—Through the machine, a certain amount of it.
We have a tailings pit we use also, and run the sludge through that—when we fill it with tailings, we run
it away. We have two compartments of it; the two outside are filled with tailings. The stuff runs over
the centre, and fills with sludge, and when the outside compartment wants to be let off, we open the gate,
and run the slum in with the tailings, and run it over the first dam that we have.
4207. Do you retain any water in that first dam, or pass it over the surface ?—The water that runs
over is completely lost. It runs down, and goes into the second dam, which has a very large area, and it
is pretty well settled there, and it then runs over the by-wash.
4208. What amount of water is there in the second dam ? —lt is for the race that comes away from
the spit round to the machine, and we have sevoral slum pits, and they settle as they come up, and when it
comes to the machine it is clear.
4209. You find that system satisfactory ?—Very satisfactory.
4210. Have you had any complaints at all recently ?—None made to me. I have heard parties
saying that there was some slum run away from us. I have not heard it officially.
4211. There is a little running off over the by-wash?—There must be in some of the storms ; and
storm-water there must, be some, but not any of any consequence.
4212. Have you any sluices at the bottom of your dam for scouring out ?—No.
4213. Do you take the water entirely from the dam ?—Yes, and it runs over the by-wash. All the
sludge that settles after that gets hard ; it is very difficult to wash it away.
4214. You are speaking now of the stone by-wasli, in the centre of Myers’ Creek?—Yes, the last
place we had.


4215. Can you give an idea of wliat was the additional cost to the company, owing to your having
to construct and maintain other dams since the action—how many men does it require to maintain your
dams ?—We have five now. I think about four guineas a week would be a fair average.
4216. For the whole of your dams ? —No, we have three shifts —one for each shift to look after the
tailings and keep the banks up, and two others making up dams—continuously for years.
4217. Suppose you could run the sludge straight down Myers* Creek, how much would you save?
—Two men’s labour every day.
4218. Then the actual cost of not being allowed to run it down the creek is two men constantly ?
Yes.
4219. And that amounts to how much ?—We pay them two guineas a week.
4220. What height do you lift your tailings with your pump ?—A little over forty feet.
4221. Do you find that yonr tailings hank washes away very much on the outside, that the slum
washes away with the ordinary rain—have you had any difficulty of that sort ?—No, it is just a matter of
eare on the man’s part in putting slum or sludge on the outside, and lining it well with it before they
fill in with the tailings. Tailings by themselves will wash away very soon, but a man of experience
putting it on and lining the back can get it pretty nearly like glue.
4222. Then it becomes a matter of care and management to enable the banks to stand ?—Yes.
4223. Supposing the time were to arrive that your company ceased to Avork, would those banks retain
their slopes without much expenditure in maintenance ?—I think so.
4224. The ordinary rainfall would not cut them away ?—I am pretty sure, because Ave are obliged to
stack the tailings in the slope within a few feet of the railway, and Ave have to be very cautious of that,
and I have seen the rains for years, and you Avould hardly notice the difference. There Avas one time the
hank inside broke, and broke the bank next; but that is not the same thing.
4225. Do you yourself, from your long experience, think there is any serious difficulty in other
companies carrying out a similar arrangement—stacking the sludge, and keeping the bank safe ? —Not at
all; it is a matter of room.
422 G. Would you afford us the benefit of your experience as to any suggestions that can be made to
mitigate the injuries from sludge ? —I have thought a great deal about this matter. It is a serious matter
to companies that have to store sludge. I think they should be made to store it; but I think the conditions
should not be so severe. Any person who knows the position of some of those places, and the heavy stuff
coming doAvn, Avould knoAv that there is ahvays sure to be a certain amount of slum or sludge gathered
Avith the water, discoloured.
4227. When you say the restrictions should not be so severe, am I to understand that you mean
that they should not be mulct in penalties, in case of excessive storms and accidents ?—I am, more particu-
larly if they let the tailings run aAvay Avith the slum—it Avould be different; but some people think the water
should be hardly discoloured. That is impossible; I have heard it said so. Take, for instance, a company
that are storing the sludge as much as they can, and there is a heavy thunderstorm, and some of that slum
that is not completely settled must run over the by-Avash, because you have to get rid of the storm-Avater,
and some of it will go Avith it, and many of them object to have that run doAvn on the land—how is it
possible to stop it ?
4228. You mean, provided all reasonable care is taken. More than that should not he expected ?
That is Avliat I think.
4229. And you are under the impression that, by the use of reasonable care, the injuries might be
onsiderably modified, if not stopped ?—I do.
The witness withdrew.
John Hooper sworn and examined.
4230. By the Board. —You are the manager of the Virginia Company ?—-Yes.
4231. Are you crushing at present?—Yes.
4232. Hoav many head? —Thirty.
4233. Can you tell the quantity of Avater you are using for those ?—I could scarcely tell the exact
quantity.
4234. Do you require all the Avater you obtain ?—Yes.
4235. Do you get much from the mine ?—None at present.
4236. Are you discharging Avater at all down the Avater channel?—Yes, at present.
4237. You are conserving it all for your own use ?—Yes.
4238. Hoav much do you crush per Aveek or per month ?—I suppose something like 300 tons per
Aveek.
4239. Do you stack your tailings ? —Yes.
4240. And yonr sludge ?—Yes, at present.
4241. You say at present —has the company not ahvays done so ? —No.
4242. How long is it since they commenced to stack the tailings and sludge ?—About four years.
4243. What Avas the reason of their commencing at that time to stack ?—The place they had been
stacking the tailings got pretty well filled up, and they found it necessary to find another place to stack the
tailings, and it was to their advantage to save their sludge as well as their tailings.
4244. Why to their advantage ? —To fill up the lower grounds.
4245. In your OAvn lease ? —Yes.
4246. What is the area of the lease ?—I could scarcely say.
4247. Will you tell us Avliat is your principle of stacking—hoAV many dams, the depth of Avater in the
dams, and lioav you pass the Avater from one to the other ?—We have at present a dam for conserving water
tor the 'Use of the battery—that would be about ten feet deep—that Avould be in the deepest place ; then
fliat Avater, of course, goes to the battery, and then it is brought back to the settling ponds, and into the
settling pit Ave call the dam, and from that it runs into the original dam, the first one again. One I have
recently made, outside of that—the Avater in that Avould be about ten or tAvelve feet deep at present —and I
intend, in carrying out the future operations there, to allow that place to be the settling place.
That is the loAver dam ?—Yes.


4249. What depth of water, if any, do you retain in your first tailings dam ?—At first, six or seven
feet of water, but it would gradully fill up by silting until it would get up to two or three inches of water,
and, as soon as that is the case, we run it into the next dam.
4250. Have you any bottom sluices in your dams ?—Yes.
4251. Do you scour your dams ?—Not at present.
4252. Have you done so ?—ln times past we have.
4253. Why not now ?—The same answer would come as I gave just now—we want the sludge to
fill up the dam ground.
4254. What is the object to yourselves in filling up the old ground ?—The object is first to make
the ground thoroughly water-tight on which the sand is to be stacked.
4255. On which your future dam will be ?—Yes.
4256. Was any action ever taken against your company in the matter of the discharge of slum ?—-
I do not remember any.
4257. It has been entirely voluntary action on your own parts ?—Yes.
4258. Putting aside the original construction of the dam, what do you consider is the expense to
the company of the maintenance of the dams, and raising the banks as the dams fill up ?—The present
expense will be just one man, at present; but, in the course of future events, it will be necessary to have
more than that, and then there will be a difficulty in the matter of storing slum on the ground continuously,
on account of its gradually rising.
4259. As that happens, you will have to make the bank up to meet it ? —Yes.
4260. What is the difficulty in that ? —To make the bank up ?—that would not be much until it got
to a certain height, and then there would be no settlement.
4261. Your banks are not constructed with slum coating on the outside, as was mentioned by Mr.
Davidson, are they ?—The outer bank of the lower dam is all of slum.
4262. That is one in course of construction now ?—Yes.
4263. Your old former tailings bank is not so ? —Yes.
4264. Do you find that old tailings-wash washes away much with the ordinary rainfall ? —lt will
naturally a little—not a great deal.
4265. "Will that wash away sufficient to do much injury to the creeks ?—I do not think so.
4266. You use a tailings pump ?—Yes.
4267. To what height do you raise that ?—About 25 feet.
4268. At present, you liavo no outlet from your dam ?—No, not from that dam. We have an outlet
from the clear water dam.
4269. The one on the right you have no outlet from ?—No.
4270. Have you managed other companies in this district before this ?—Not where there has been a
crushing machine.
4271. So you could not tell me anything about stacking elsewhere ?—No.
4272. Would you give the Board any suggestions you have thought of with regard to stacking ?
My opinion is something like Mr. Clark’s as to the reservation of room for tailings by the Government, but
we have plenty of room just below the dam made here by the Council. If there was a certain area set
apart there for stacking slum, it would be the means of hindering the sludge from proceeding further, and
would not be a very great outlay.
4273. That would be by constructing a dam across the old workings ?—Yes.
4274. And in that case would any harm result from sluicing at the dams of other companies ?—I
think not; not for a considerable time. Sludge will, of course, naturally fill up, and would have to be
emptied.
4275. You heard what Mr. Clark said on the subject of the possibility of the expense being shared
by several companies—do you think that is possible or feasible ?—I do not know. I have never heard our
company mention anything about the matter, but it is possible they might do that ; but I think it would be
necessary for the Government to take action to help them in the matter.
4276. By dint of making a dam across the old workings, you think the injury to the claims lower
down, and to the agricultural interest, could be absolutely stopped ?—lt could for a certain length of time.
Of course, it would be continual expense even to do that. If dams were made they would silt up, not only
from sludge from the mines but from the washing from the surface, and would have to be emptied in the
course of time.
4277. Still, a considerable number of tons could be kept?—Yes.
4278. Would that sludge so alter, so that, in course of time, a channel could be formed through it
to take the ordinary water, and not remove the balance of the sludge ?—Yes.
4279. That would be really a remedy for the evil, then, if the land is there ? —Yes.
4280. Have you had any experience in the construction of such a dam ?—I have not had very great
experience in the matter. I have made a few banks.
4281. Do you mean an earth bank ?—Yes.
4282. Do you think that fascine or scrub weirs would be of any use ?—I do not think they would.
4283. Have you ever seen one?—No; but I do not think they would.
4284. How would the flood-water, in the case of such a data as you propose, be provided for—the
storm-water, if it passed over the top, would carry the dam away?—You could have proper by-washes
made.
4285. You would make an earthern dam with by-washes ?—Yes.
4286. Is there anything else you would like to say ?—I do not think of anything further.
The witness withdrew.
James Fitzpatrick sworn and examined.
4287. By the Board. —You are a farmer ?—Yes.
4288. How many acres do you hold?—About 150 acres on Myers’ Creek.
4289. What length .of frontage have you there ?—Something about a mile.
4290. You are situated on both sides of the creek ?—No.


4291. Which side ?—On the east side.
4292. What is the name of the place where your property is situated ?—Myers 5 Creek and Myers 5
Flat—either of those.
4293. About one mile from the Catherine Reef Gold Mining Company—one mile down the creek ?
—About two miles and a half.
4294. Does your land suffer from any debris brought down from any mining operations?—Yes.
4295. In what way ?—With silt and slum all over it.
429 G. Is that silt and slum still coming down the creek, or are you speaking of the past ?—lt is not
coming down at the same rate as it used to twelve or fourteen years ago.
4297. In what way does that silt or slum injure your laud?—lt injured some so that I could not
reach the maiden soil, in fact, when I am ploughing.
4298. Over what area of your land does the silt deposit ? —Twenty acres.
4299. To what average depth is the deposit on this ? —To take it all through, it would average from
six to seven inches; in some places, it is three feet.
4300. Is it agricultural or grazing land ?—Agricultural.
4301. What is the nature of the soil ?—Loamy.
4302. Have you ever tried ploughing in the silt and slum with your natural soil?—I had to
do so.
4303. What was the effect on the crop ?—As soon as any hot weather comes, it gets scorched up and
burnt. It is a regular poison to any herbs growing on it.
4304. Your crop is more easily burnt up after the admixture of that than it was in its original state ?
—Yes.
4305. How long ago is it since the deposit first occurred on your land?—Fourteen years ago.
4306. What length of time have you been in possession ?—Twenty-three or 24 years.
4307. Used you to have floods over your land before that period ?—There used to be floods, but no
silt, no sand.
4308. The flood would go over the land ?—Yes.
4309. To the same depth that it does now ?—No, not now, where I have banked some of it out.
4310. Were the floods higher then than now, with the same amount of rain ?—I banked it on the
main road, and when a heavy storm comes it washes over that silt.
4311. I want to ascertain whether you find that the floods rise further, and inundate more of your
land, now than it used to do then—is the flood higher now than it used to be ? —Yes, and I will tell you
the reason for that. Where there was the level ground this silt set on it, and it raised the water more
over the rest of it.
4312. Has the creek bed much filled up ?—The creek is filled up.
4313. To what extent has the bed of the creek risen?—About four feet, and the Government formed
a dam there about nine years ago, which had cost, to the best of my belief, £BOO or £9OO, and that is all
filled up with silt, largo quartz silt.
4314. You say you are still sustaining the injury ?—Yes.
4315. Is the injury due to the old silt in the creek ?—Some of it, for I tell you the old silt that was
washed in the gully accumulated there, and stands still, and when the heavy storms come it washes
gradually away.
4316. And comes doAvn on your land ?—Yes.
4317. Does it wash away from your land, and go into the creek beyond ?—Yes.
4318. Has your banking out had the effect of keeping back the silt, and preventing it going further
down the creek ?—No.
4319. Have you banked across the watercourse ?—I made an embankment in two places to keep it
off the best way I could, and this is getting full of the silt, and, in fact, the public road is getting full three
feet, and still when a heavy storm comes it washes over the land.
4320. Is your bank carried across the watercourse at the road—is there a natural watercourse still
running across your paddock ?—There is no natural watercourse; it is a watercourse I formed myself.
4321. Does that road become a sheet of water in rain ?—Yes.
4322. What do you consider is the value of your land generally —not those twenty acres, hut your
ordinary land adjoining those twenty acres ?—I valued it about £l2 an acre.
4323. And what do you value your twenty acres now ? —lt is not worth anything till I get the silt
off. I Avould not take it as a gift.
4324. When did you last cultivate that tAventy acres ?—There is some cultivated now.
4325. Was it cultivated last year ?—I had to cultivate it. It runs along for ten chains, and when
I am Avorking the rest of the paddock I just run the horses through it the same.
4326. What have you in cultivation now, and what had you last year on the twenty acres ?
Wheat.
4327. How many bushels did you get off that tAventy acres ?—I made it into hay.
4328. Hoav many bushels did you get from the land adjoining, not covered ?—I made it all into hay.
4329. How many tons did you get to the acre off your land, that was not covered ?—Sometimes I
get as high as four tons to the acre in a good season.
4330. What did you get last year ?—Two tons.
4331. And how many tons per acre did you get off the twenty acres that have been over-run by the
sludge ?—About twenty acres. I had a part of the twenty acres I cannot Avork till I have carried the
slum off.
4332. I thought you did put it under agriculture ?—lt was not Avorth running the machine over it,
where the slum is.
4333. How many acres have been rendered useless, that you cannot use for agricultural purposes ?
About twenty acres.
4334. But you said you did last year, and have this year got a portion of that in agriculture ?
—Yes.
4335. How much of that tAventy acres have you in agriculture ?—About seven acres.
4336. Then how many acres are useless ?—About seven acres under cultivation.


4337. And thirteen useless ?—The rest I cannot work till I get the silt off. I could not reach the
maiden soil from the height of silt that is there.
4338. Did you bring any action, or take any action, against any companies as to the silt ?—I did.
4339. What was the result of that ?—The result was that I got any amount of law by paying for
it, but no justice.
4340. What was the result —was it decided that your land had been injured by them, and what was
the effect of it ?—That I cannot tell you. I brought an action twice. The first action there was a verdict
against me, and the second one—in fact, the judge put it to the jury, even if the mine was letting the slum
and silt into a man’s property, if he objected he could not do it—and still the jury was locked up all night,
and they did not agree.
4341. You are not certain that any silt is coming down into the creek now ?—Yes, sometimes.
4342. When is that ? —Any time when those dams, such as you heard the evidence about, get over-
flowed, a little will have to go.
4343. It is only a little ?—Not the same quantity as used to come.
4344. What is the nature of the deposit—is it quartz sand or slum ?—Quartz sand.
4345. You say the quartz sand is deposited to the extent of four feet—you know that road bridge?
—Yes.
4346. How much was that filled up under that road bridge—has it risen as much as four feet under
that bridge ?—There is about three feet under that bridge. I have seen the bridge cleared out, and in a
week there was three feet under it. It all comes through the Devonshire.
4347. Do you water stock in the creek ?—Yes.
4348. Is the creek in any way injurious to the stock ?—No, I do not find any injury of that kind.
All the injury is that it is getting filled up with slum and silt, and throwing the water back on the land.
4349. You have banked out a portion of your property ?—Yes.
4350. Is there any practical difficulty as to banking out the rest ?—lt is impossible for me to bank
it out.
4351. Are you aware if you have any neighbours, any other farmers, complaining in the same way as
you do ?—Yes.
4352. Are they adjoining your property ?—Yes.
4353. Would you give the names of them ?—There is one Torpey, Mrs. Williamson, and Thomas
Buzzy.
4354. Who is the next neighbour to yourself?—Mr. Buzzy and Mrs. Williamson.
4355. Is Buzzy on the north side ?—Yes.
4356. And is his land inundated the same as yours is ? —I cannot say. I had to try to defend
myself twice—an action brought in the Supreme Court. If a man was injured he would make his complaint,
I suppose.
The witness withdrew.
Hay Kirkwood sworn and examined.
4357. By the Board. —What position do you hold ?—Legal manager.
4358. But you'are also Mayor ?—I have been for a number of years ; but lam out of office now.
4359. Are you on the council still ?—Yes.
4360. As a member •of the council, are you aware whether any injury has been caused to the
agricultural lands within the control of the council ?—Unless those two cases which Mr. Davidson
mentioned, and Mr. Fitzpatrick, those are the only ones I have heard of. *
4361. Did the council take any action at all as to the matter ?—No.
4362. You have heard Mr. Fitzpatrick say that a lot of his propertv was converted into a sheet of
water covered with deposit—did the council take any action in that matter ?—No; that is in the Marong
shire.
4363. We would be very glad to hear any suggestion from you ? —As far as the council is concerned,
we had to take action once or twice at California Gully, as to sludge overfloAving the main road from the
Johnson’s Reef Company.
4364. What action did you take ?—We complained to the Minister of Mines, wrote several letters
to the company, and proposed to remedy the evil; but it rose so high that the sludge was quite up to the
level of the road, and we went so far as to bring the Minister of Mines up to see it, and the Minister of
Mines compelled the company to clear the creek below that, so that the sludge would get away.
4365. Was the Johnson’s Company at that time stacking ?—Yes, they were stacking the tailings
and allowing the slum to run away, as they used to do then.
4366. Are they still doing it ?—Yes.
4367. Are they causing injury to your roads now?—No; they-keep it clearer now. Ido not think
they run so much sludge down now.
4368. And they have cleared the creek ? —Yes.
4369. Have you formed any idea yourselves, or has it come before the council in the form of
suggestions as to the best method of preventing the nuisance ? —Yes; I have thought a good deal about the
sludge question, and seeing it brought from time to time before the Government, and especially the Huntly
Council, the matter could be very easily remedied in my opinion, that is to prevent any injury being done
below Eagleliawk side way, and that is by cutting a reservoir across the gullies, making a complete
reservoir, a permanent reservoir, and allowing the little sludge that goes away now to be caught, and not
go away.
4370. A sort of silt trap reservoir ?—No, a regular reservoir, with by-washes to keep the water at a
certain level, and Avhen one portion silted up it could be taken up.
4371. Do you agree Avith the suggestions of Mr. Clark and Mr. Davidson ?—Yes, I quite agree Avitli
them, except one thing, and that is—l do not think the quartz-crushing people should be called upon to
pay any expense at all.
4372. Should that be entirely a Government matter, in your opinion ?—Yes.
4373. Would the corporation assist ?—I do not think so.


4374. Have you received appeals at any time from tlie valuation, on the ground of land being injured
by the deposit ?—Never.
4375. Have you ever lowered your valuation on that ground ?—No, never ; it does not affect the
borough at all. As far as valuation goes, it is all outside; but this much I would suggest—and I think it
is right —the Government should do it in a mining district like this. There are three main gullies, Eagle-
hawk—and there is a large part of the country below the bottom of it, where a splendid reservoir could be
made—the same in the Devonshire, and the same in Myers’ Flat. That will prevent it, if a reservoir
was run across each of those, and it would prevent it for years.
4376. Is there anything going down the Devonshire or Myers’ Flat now?—There is the Albert
crushing machine, Avhich runs down to Fitzpatrick’s.
4377. Is that running much now ?—lt runs off in the usual way sometimes. Of course, when there
is plenty of water, the miners like to let off a little of the slum. I might state that the Lady Barkly and
South St. Mungo tailings and drainings from the slum stuff Avould lead into the same gully as the Duchess
of Devonshire, right down to Dead Horse.
4378. That is not into Myers’ Flat?—No, but that is the place where the stuff goes down to
Fitzpatrick’s, because I happened to be a witness in that case.
4379. You said the mining managers like to send some down, but we have had evidence that there
is no necessity for that; that where the mining managers have room, they can retain the tailings and the
slum, and at the present, until the dams get full, the Duchess of Edinburgh is also doing it ?—They could
stack it very well, but in the case of the St. Mungo, they sent a lot down past our door hero, and in the hot
weather it gets thick and nasty in the creek. At the present moment, there has been enough rain to clear
it all away.
4380. Is their area of settling large ?—No, they have only a small area. They run the sludge off
about every four weeks. You see the Catherine Reef dam and Mr. Clark’s partly run into Myers’ Creek.
4381. Have you any suggestion as to how the cost should be provided; and the cost of silt dams, if
you make them, after the companies have ceased to exist ?—I think the Government ought to do all the
work. If they have three permanent dams there, one man could look after the whole lot for some years till
they wanted cleaning.
4382. You would not approve of the suggestion that the interested councils should do it ?—No,
because it would fall on the companies ; they would charge a little more per ton for doing this, and we are
pretty well handicapped now, and I think the Government ought to relieve the mining industry a little;
and as far as the construction of these reservoirs goes, I should say they could be made for about £3OO to
£4OO each.
4383. It would appear that, with real care only, a very small portion need go down the creek ?
Ido not think there is a great deal goes down there, but Mr. Fitzpatrick says there is stuff still goes
doAvn. I was a witness in his case, and I remember all about it. It is a very flat country, and there is a
good deal of natural scour of the country coming down as well as the tailings—yellow sand.
4384. That must be eliminated, of course, from this question altogether ?—Yes.
4385. Are you aware whether other lands are injured down there ?—Yes, the lands that Mr. Fitz-
patrick mentions, Mrs. Williamson’s, and the others.
4386. You do not know any others ?—Yes, I have some land there myself, but it is a little away
from the gully.
4387. Are you near the gully ?—Near Mrs. Williamson's.
4388. How much is the land worth ?—Ten to twelve pounds an acre.
4389. Do you put it to agriculture ?—Yes, it is all agricultural land down there. Ido not cultivate
mine much now.
4390. Is there anything else you wish to mention ?—No, I think not.
The loitness loitlidrew.
Adjourned till to-morrow , at Heathcote.
(Taken at Heathcote.)
THURSDAY, 28th OCTOBER, 1886.
Present:
R. H. Shakespear, Esq., in the Chair;
A. F. Walker, Esq., J R. G. Ford, Esq.
Thomas Hedley sworn and examined.
4391. By the Board. —You carry on sluicing operations here ?—I do.
4392. Are you holding your land under lease from the Government or by miner’s right ?—By miner’s
right. I formerly held under lease, hut I hold now under miner’s right.
4393. What is the name of the company ?—The Mclvor Hydraulic Sluicing Company.
4394. What quantity of water do you use ?—All I can get; unfortunately I have not been able to
get enough the last four years.
4395. What quantity would you be using on the average per day during those four years when you
are at work ?—When I have a full supply at work I am able to use five million gallons per day.
4396. W'here do you obtain that from ?—From the Sugar-Loaf Creek, or the head of the Mclvor
Creek.
4397. What length of race have you ? —The survey of the race is 24 miles to the top of the hill
here, but I always reckon the race will be about 26 miles, because it runs backward and forwards in the
survey. .


4398. By whom was that race constructed?—By me, the first part of it; I bought out the party.
Thore was a company expended close on £2,000 before I took it up.
4399. lIoAv r much have you expended on it roughly ? —On the race I know there was expended
between £5,000 and £6,000. I bought this other party out. I did not consider they had much; but
whatever right they had 1 bought from them.
4400. Is there a weir at the head of the race ?—Yes, a log weir.
4401. Have you a service dam ?—I have one in Long Gully.
4402. What are the contents of the service dam ?—lt is seven acres, and the deepest part is twelve
or thirteen feet—l reckon about seven million gallons.
4403. During what period of the year have you been working, during the past four years ?—About
four years ago I had four months sluicing; the year before I had about four, and last year about four, and
I do not think, to put it all together, I have had above three weeks of what I could call a fair head this
year. I have often used moro water in three weeks than I have had this year.
4404. How many hours per day have you been working lately? —Eight.
4405. How many months in the year used you to work prior to that, four years ago ?—One year I
worked over nine months, I think that was the most I ever worked.
4406. And how many hours a day during that nine months ? —Sometimes the water was running
night and day. Even if I had not men on, it would be running down the tail-race.
4407. How many acres do you consider that you have worked tip, up to the present time ?—To the
best of my knowledge, I have worked twenty acres.
4408. Could you give the average depth of the face in those workings—l want to arrive at the
quantity ?—I think the twenty acres would average ten feet, and some of it has been as high as 22, and
some four and five feet —something over ten feet.
4409. How many acres of work in prospect do you consider you have ?—A great number of years.
4410. Canyon give any limit—as many as fifty ?—Yes. I would be safe to say at least fifty years;
there is plenty of ground.
4411. Would it be about the same average depth?—No. I think it Avould go down this Avay
further. I think the depth Avould hardly be as much.
4412. What length of tail-race have you got boxed ?—I have none boxed noAv r .
4413. All ground sluicing ? —All ground sluicing.
4414. Used you to Avork ivith a tail-race?—Yes. I lifted all by boxes last summer. I had the
ground raised, but the season was so uncertain I didn’t go to the expense of laying down boxes again.
4415. Supposing you had, in future, average good seasons, would you relay your boxes ?—Oh! yes;
I mean to next summer.
4416. You have excavated your tail-race Avith a proper fall Avith a vieAv to laying boxes ?—Yes.
I Avanted to go to Avork this year Avith as little expense as possible, on account of the dry season, and I did
not use boxes. I partly built it in the tail-race —the sides.
4417. What is the fall in your tail-race ?—About one hundred and tAventy feet to the mile —eighteen
inches to the chain.
4418. lloav much is that per box ?—Three inches and-a half, about.
4419. You find that is sufficient to carry aAvay ivlmt is required?—To work to any advantage, that
is about the least I can Avork Avith.
4420. Where do you deliver your tailings ?—I formerly delivered them on the flat; they gradually
made their Avay into the creek.
4421. And now ?—I am depositing the tailings in an old paddock that I Avorked out four or five
years ago.
4422. Can you give me any idea of the proportion of tailings to.the sludge ?—The proportion of
tailings to the sludge is very small in most of the ground.
4423. In other Avords, you run atvay almost all that you exca\ r ate ? —1 reckon, in a great deal of the
ground, I have Avorked in 100 loads of soil, and there would not be over 10 or 15 loads or tons of tailings.
4424. That is about from 10 to 15 per cent. ?—Yes.
4425. Where do you pass that sludge now ?—lt has gone doAvn the creek.
4426. What length of your tail-race do you Avasli up —do you rememberAvliere the end of your side-
boarding is ?—Doavii this end, before it drops into the paddock ?
4427. Yes ?—I Avash down to there.
4428. What is the length of your tail-race from your face down to the end of the portion A\ r ith the
sideboards ?—About 130 boxes of tAvelve feet each.
4429. Have you had any leA r els taken to show ivhether you can change the direction of the tail-race
and got across into Commissioners’ Flat ?—Yes, 1 could.
4430. Was there any difficulty in your doing so ?—No.
4431. Do you knoAv of any reason why you should not pass your tailings into Commissioners’ Flat ?
—There Avould not be fall to deposit them there.
4432. You knoAv the krvels ?—Yes.
4433. Can you give me the level of the top of your tail-race, near your face, down to the loAvest
portion of the saddle passing into Commissioners’ Flat; do you knoAv the difference of fall ? —No.
4434. From the head of your tail-race the loAvest part of your boxes running doAvn to the saddle
crossing into Commissioners’ Flat? —Well, the distance Avould be large that Avay from Avliere lain working.
4435. Are you are aAvare that, as far as can be judged Avithont actually accurate levels, the bottom
of your tail-race at the end of your side-boarding appears to be on a level Avith the loAvest part of the ridge
dividing you from Commissioners* Flat ?—I will tell you one thing, that ivhen I drop the tailings in there
into that paddock —I have this year already cut a tail-race round on the side of the Ileathcotc Hotel into the
creek, and it took all the fall I haA r e to deliver it into the creek —I Avas rather short of fall to go round
that Avay.
4436. What I Avant is this—if, instead of having a steep fall into the paddock from the point of
your tail-race Avliere you at present run into the paddock, are you aAvare Avhether I am correct in saying
that that point is about nine feet higher than the loAver part of the saddle running into Commissioners*
Flat?—No, the ground rises that AA r ay to the saddle.
Sludge. r


4487. It is only with barometer, but apparently the saddle is nine feet lower than this point ?
I know while I was working the Hospital Ilill claim, I Avorked in the same place Avhere I Avork iioav, and I
brought the tail-Avater round by the saddle to Avork there, and I know the fall where Ave are working noAV is
better than there.
4438. If it is a fact that the loAvest part of this saddle is about on the same level Avith, or a little
lower than, the junction of your tail-race, Avould there be any practical difficulty in turning your tail-race
from your place into Commissioners* Gully ?—Not a bit.
4439. If that is found to be practicable by taking the level, do you think that turning the sludge into
Commissioners’ Flat, into the old Avorkings, Avould effectually dispose of all you can send doAvn for some
time ?—Not of the sludge.
4440. It Avould not ? —Oh! no.
4441. The valley is Avide and there are a number of old workings ?—There are, but if the sludge
Avas stopped it would hold tailings for a long time ; but if you stopped those, it Avould fill it up very quick.
4442. Directly you pass over the ridge into Commissioners’ Flat, there is ample fall doAvn the gully?
—Yes.
4443. Nothing Avould stop you then ?—No.
4444. There Avould not be any practical difficulty in turning your Avater into Commissioners’ Gully ?
—Not a bit ;in fact, I believe, the fall Avould be better that Avay than the Avay lam coming.
4445. Can you give any reason Avliy such a course should not be adopted to get rid of the sludge
instead of turning it into the creek ? —Because the fall is so small the tailings Avould deposit all the heavy
gravel, but the sludge Avould go aAvay Avith the water.
4446. Could not the Avater, Avith a succession of low dams, be kept in the old Avorkings ?—I think
not.
4447. We see that in other places ?—For instance, running sludge from the puddling machine, you
might do it. that Avay ; but in turning tailings from the ground sluice you have to let it go to get clear of
the tailings and of the boxes, or they dam back, and that is the Avay I Avorked over here. I kept extending
my boxes as soon as the tailings filled up the ground, but then at the same time the sludge Avent away with
the Avater direct into the creek. Noav if you dam, it Avould be impossible for one season, one Avould cover
all Commissioners* Flat a foot deep Avith sludge, as far as I could run it.
4448. It becomes a matter of calculation as to the quantity of the stuff ?—Yes; but it is a difficult
thing to keep the sludge back, because the Avater is thick. When lam running off top stuff with a head
of water, the Avater is as thick as porridge. I have seen box sluicing Avhere the tailings of some Avere kept
back and the Avater taken to another sluice; but it Avas only a small stream of Avater.
4449. We have seen it Avith the Avater passing off sufficiently pure to be no detriment into the creek ?
—The Avater is that thick that when it goes aAvay from me, if it Avas to settle for 24 hours, it Avould still be
muddy, it is so much boxed up in the water Avhen it leaves me; and, unless you have a still-dam, it Avould
not settle.
4450. Why should you not have some still-dams in Commissioners’ Flat ? —I knoAv there is not
sufficient fall to admit of building a dam. As soon as you build a dam you do aAvay Avith the fall, because
it takes a certain amount of fall to carry the tailings and sludge into this dam, and then the fine sediment
fills it up quite as quick as tailings; and, as long as the Avater is in motion, it Avould still be dirty.
4451. As long as there is fall enough to get clear from the bottom of your tail-race, it becomes a
matter in Avhich the settling of your slum cannot, interfere Avith your works until the dam becomes high
enough to block back your tail-race ?—With stacking the slum, it would not pay.
4452. Why do you say it Avould not pay ?—Because I find it now, in a great many cases, that with
all the fall to take advantage of everything, it takes me all my time to make it pay.
4453. What Avould be exactly the' cost, can you say, if there Avere some dams thrown across
Commissioners’ Flat to fill the old Avorkings ?—There would be private property come in the Avay, and
existing rights.
4454. As a practical sluicer, I ask you Avhat objection Avould there be ? —The cost Avould be the one
great objection.
4455. What Avould be the cost of forming a dam—very loav dams, and only raised from time to time?
—There is Long Gully, a place that I did think of opening up, and putting a good tail-race in. From the
one end of that gully there is a greater extent of sluicing ground than any place in Heathcote, and, from
one end of it to the other, there is only 150 feet of fall in two miles, and to Avork the ground the tail-race
AYOuld have to be taken right from the creek.
4456. Up in the gully ?—Yes; more to the south of the gully that my dam is in, the reservoir.
4457. Then you object really because of the doubt Avhcther the level will answer ?—I am certain
the level Avill not ans Aver in any of those gullies Avhere I have been Avorking. Possum Gully, Long Gully,
and Argyle Gully Avould not admit of any dams at all; I have tried the levels on the Avliole of them.
4458. lloav many men do you employ ?—I liaA’e very feAv this year, seven or eight.
4459. How many did you employ last year ?—The highest I employed last year avus about eleven
and tAvelve.
4460. Do you employ full day*s Avork for the Avliole Aveek during the months that you Avorked ?
Yes, as soon as I had the Avater; since you Avere here last, I had a fortnight I had no Avater at all ; it Avas
not Avorking.
4461. Is that due to the dryness of the past few seasons ?—Yes.
44G2. Before the seasons became so dry how many men did you employ ?—I have had as high as 50.
4463. Suppose Ave had a succession of Avet seasons, such as Ave had eight or nine years ago, how
manv men Avould you expect to employ ? —From 20 to 30. If I had one season like I had some years
back, I would remove more stuff one year than I have done in the last four.
4464. Have you to employ labour specially to keep your tail-race clear ? — I generally keep on one
or tAVO men on the tail-race cutting up or keeping the tailings running clear.
4465. Do you mean one or tAvo men constantly ?—One and tAvo men constantly on the race keeping
it clear.
4466. Is that forking out the rough stuff ?—Breaking up bigish lumps and taking stones out Avhen-
ever it happens to block, and sometimes the race will fill up Avith a lot of stuff ; that causes a great deal of
labour to keep it running.


4467. Have any complaints been made at any time on your system of working ?—No.
4468. Has any complaint been made to you on tlio subject of the amount of tailings that have been
delivered in the creek ?—Yes.
4469. Have you taken any action with regard to that? —No.
4470. You at present deliver your tailings as well as your sludge ?—No; at present the tailings are
deposited on the paddock at the back of the Hospital.
4471. You began it when we were up here ?—Yes, all the tailings are stopped there, but the sludge
goes on.
4472. What amount of maintenance do you find it necessary to keep on the ivater-race to maintain
it ?—I think, for maintenance at the time the water is running, I pay one man at the head of the race,
turning the water on and turning it off at the time of heavy rain, 255. a week, and he has to look after
seven miles of race as well; then there is another man, I give him about £1 a week to keep the race for
about twelve miles. Then there are two boys, I give them ss. a week each for minding the balance.
4473. Do you work with a nozzle ?—Yes; but I have not applied hydraulic pressure this year.
4474. You are merely running over the top?—Yes.
4475. What is the size of the water-race ? —Five feet wido from the head of the race to the reservoir,
and from the reservoir here it is six feet.
4476. And the depth ? —lt carries about fifteen or sixteen inches of water.
4477. And the fall per mile?—Six feet eight inches, an inch to the chain.
4478. There has been a great deal of correspondence on the subject, and, I believe, you have entered
into some of it—can you suggest any remedy yourself for the injury that the agriculturalists complain of
lower down ?—I cannot. When I started here, I knew that the creek had been used for mining purposes
since the first Mclvor rush, for puddling and all sorts of mining, and I started with faith that I could use it
for the same purpose.
The witness withdrew.
Henry Thomas sworn and examined.
4479. By the Board. —Are you connected with the mining interest here ?—Yes.
4480. In what way ?—I have an interest in the Meadow Valley Sluice Company.
4481. Is that at work now ? —Yes.
4482. What is the area of the lease ?—They have no lease, it is held by mining right.
4483. How long have you been at> work ? —There has not been much work done lately. They let
a tribute about the beginning of September this year.
4484. That was the commencement of the working of the company?—Yes, this year.
4485. Wns it working the previous year ?—Yes.
4486. How long has the sluicing operation been going on in the Meadow Valley ?—About four
years.
4487. How many acres have been worked out during those four years ?—About thirty, I suppose.
4488. Could you give the average depth of face ?—lt runs from three feet down to about nine or ten.
4489. An average of six or seven feet ?—Yes.
4490. How many acres are there still left to work ?—Over 200, I should think, round about there—
that is, on that spot; but the water would command the other diggings about that place.
4491. And about the same depth of face ?—Some of it would be deeper.
4492. Where do you obtain the water from for your purposes?—From the Meadow Valley Creek.
4493. Do you dam that creek yourself?—Yes.
4494. What are the contents of your service-dam ?—As near as we could get it, it is about
27,000,000 gallons.
4495. And the length of your water-race ?—The head-race is about three miles long.
4496. Do you know the fall of that ?—I do not.
4497. Where do you discharge the water from your sluicing?—lnto the Wild Duck Creek.
4498. Do you make any attempt to stack your tailings?—The tailings do not go down.
4499. Do you stack them ?—They stack themselves in Patterson’s Gully, and never go down to the
creek.
4500. They are sufficiently heavy not to be carried ?—Yes.
4501. What proportion of tailings are there to the full quantity that you removed ?—Some of the
clay ground, I should think, the percentage of tailings would be very small—not more than 8 or 10 per
cent.
4502. Then do you run down to the creek all the balance ?—Yes.
4503. Ninety per cent you run into the Wild Dog Creek ? —Something like that; it goes away as
dirty water.
4504. It is carrying away the whole nine-tenths of what you are working? —It is very muddy, but
it runs freely.
4505. What is the length of your tail-race ?—Close on a mile.
4506. Does that deliver direct into Wild Duck Creek ?—Yes; it is timbered all the way down into
the creek.
4507. Do you make any attempt to stack your sludge, any way?—No; it would be no good to attempt
it. We could not possibly do it.
4508. You say it is absolutely impossible to do it ?—Yes.
4509. On what grounds? —There is nowhere to stack it.
4510. How is that—is the land all private land ?—The fact is the quantity would be so much it
would go over private land. We have difficulty enough to keep it away off the private land as it is.
4511. You have not the land?—No, we have only the right to run the tail-race through.
4512. That passes through private lands ?—Yes.
4513. How many men do you employ ?—Seven at the last tribute—never more than that.
4514. How many months in the year do you work ? —We have had very little work. This year we
only had since the Board was here last.


4515. I want to know the value of the labour employed on the works this year and last year—how
many men, for how many months ?—The first year there were, I think, seventeen men employed for about
three or four months, and, since then, there have only been six or seven employed, just as long as the water
would last.
4516. Would that be about-three or four months ?—No, not as much as that—it did not average
three months.
4517. Has any complaint been made to you as to the effect of discharging sludge into the Wild Duck
Creek ?—Only a general complaint. There has been no one objected to it personally—only farmers and
the people living down the creek.
4518. They have complained?—Yes.
4519. Did you ever take into consideration any method by which you can mitigate the injury from
which they are suffering ? —I cannot see how it can be done. I cannot see any possibility of impounding it,
because the amount of water that we run through is so much that we could not possibly impound it —we
have no means at all. lam certain it is not possible.
4520. Were you at any time recommended to suspend operations on that claim ?—I was not, but iny
mate told me he was recommended not to go on with it.
4521. What was the result of the recommendation ? —He died, and we went on with it ourselves; I
took no notice of the recommendations. The operations were suspended through a partnership quarrel, and
the fact is it is now in a state of chaos. As to the partnership disputes, we could not come to any agree-
ment as to the mode in which it should be worked, and so on.
4522. It was not suspended on account of any action threatened or taken with regard to the disposal
of sludge?—No; we never had any action threatened.
4523. Could you give any information to the Board as to whether it is at all probable that more
extended sluicing will take place in that portion of the district ?—lf we could raise capital, I intended to
take in all the ground we have on the plan, and then we have a very large amount of water available—we
intended to go as far as Pohlman’s Creek.
4524. Are any steps being taken to increase the quantity of water? —Not at the present time.
4525. Is it likely they will he ? —lf the Government will allow us we will do so, because it is
capable of being made valuable in that case.
4526. If the Government do allow you to make provision to conserve more water, would the sluicing
be largely increased ? —I think so.
4527. Many more acres ? —We should go through that portion I speak of.
4528. How many acres ?—About 200 acres available in that place, without diverting the race from
its present course.
4529. And about how much more available from the other increased sources of supply ? —There are
a good many acres round about in different places, as much more land is available, I think.
4530. You think the sluicing may extend over 400 acres ?—Yes.
The witness withdrew.
Richard Williams sworn and examined.
4531. By the Board. —You are a farmer here ?—Yes.
4532. How many acres do you hold ?—We have 1,004 on the creek.
4533. Where are they situated as to Ileatheote ?—Four and a half miles on the Mclvor Creek.
4534. What length of land actually fronts the creek ?—About two miles frontage, both sides of the
creek.
4535. Do you hold under Crown grant ?—lt is freehold.
4536. Under original Crown grant?—Yes.
4537. Did that Crown grant give the right to the creek ? —I do not know.
4538. Is your land subject to flooding from the Mclvor Creek ?—Yes.
4539. Has it been flooded this year?—Not this year.
4540. When was it last flooded ?—Last year there were one or two small floods. They did not go
over the flats very far.
4541. When was the last heavy flood there ? —About three years ago was the heaviest flood we have
had.
4542. Have the floods done more injury to your laud since the sluicing works were conducted here
than before ? —Yes.
4543. It has raised the level of the flood ?—Yes.
4544. To what extent has the creek within your boundaries silted-up ?—lt was deep-water creeks
before, and now there is no water at all; it is just the same as a sludge channel.
4545. Has the general bed between the waterholes been silted-up? —Yes.
4546. To what depth, on the average?—l could not say. It is just level now; you can walk up
the bed of the creek in dry weather.
4547. To what purpose do you apply your land ?—Agriculture and grazing.
4548. How many acres oE your agricultural land have been interfered with by the floods depositing
silt ?—All the best of the land along the creek has all been flooded by the creek —the best of the agriculture
land.
4549. Is silt deposited by those floods on the land ? —Yes, all over it.
4550. How many acres of land suffer from the deposit of sludge ?—Over 100 acres, I should think.
4551. What depth does the sludge go over it, on the average ?—I have no idea.
4552. Four or five inches ?—Some places a foot or eighteen inches —others, only a few inches.
4553. Are you still cultivating the land over which the sludge was deposited ?—Some of it.
4554. Have you thrown any of it out of agriculture into grazing ? —Yes.
4555. What induced you to do it?—On account of the sludge—the floods going over it, it used to
carry it away.
. 4556. About how many acres out of that hundred are you still cultivating ?—We have only a small
part twenty acres in crop at all.


4557. What is the effect on the crop of the sludge deposit ?—lt affects the growth of the crop.
4558. What is the nature of the soil underneath ?—Black.
4559. Can you plough in the silt with the black soil ?—ln some places—iu others it is all silt.
4560. Does it lessen the crop ?—I do not think it affects the growth of the crop where it mixes
with the black soil.
4561. Provided the flood does not come at the time of year to interfere with the growth of the
crop ? —A little of it does not, matter, but where there is much silt it dries up with the heat.
4562. llow many cattle and sheep do you keep ? —About 70 or 80 head of cattle, and a little over
2,000 sheep and lambs.
4563. Where do you water the cattle and sheep?—We have a spring, and some dams in the
paddock.
4564. You do not now water them in the creek ?—ln the summer time they never go near the
creek.
4565. Used you to water them in the creek ? —Yes.
4566. How long ago is it since you discontinued that ?—Since the creek has been silted-up —there
are one or two places where there are springs on the banks, and we dig out the water there.
4567. Did you find the water in any way injurious ?—£7o, I do not think it affects them.
4568. Describe in what way you suffer in watering your cattle and sheep ?—When the sludge comes
down nothing Avill touch it—it is just like porridge Avhen the sludge settles on the banks of the creek, it
gradually fills up.
4569. Does the Avater become clearer in summer than in Avinter ?—lf there is no sluicing the Avater
comes clearer.
4570. Does it clear quickly ?—lt is clear in the mornings after being running all night; it is dis-
coloured, but the stock drink it—it is after dinner-time it comes down muddy again when the sluicing is
going on.
4571. Have you lost cattle or sheep in the creek ?—Yes.
4572. Hoav long ago ?—We lost a horse three months ago.
4573. lloav long is it since you suffered from their being lost in the creek ?—Seven years ; e\ r er since
the sluicing began.
4574. You knoAV the sluicing existed prior to your losing any cattle in the creek ?—Yes.
4575. How many have you lost altogether?—l could not say.
4576. And sheep ?—We have had in the creek over 100 in one season, but they do not all die. Wo
pulled them all out, but they Avere covered Nvith sludge, and they Avere no use for avool.
4577. Does that happen periodically—yearly? —Just before the creek dries up in the summer, after
a month or six weeks—from now the creek dries, and it is soft in the centre, and strange stock go into it to
get a drink, then they find it is soft and plunge right in.
4578. You consider the value of your land is depreciated, owing to the filling-up of the creek by silt?
—Yes, greatly.
4579. To what, extent ?—I should say over £l,OOO.
4580. £1 an acre ?—Fully.
4581. Hoav long is it since you purchased the property ?—About fourteen or fifteen years.
4582. Was the creek quite clear then ?—Yes.
4583. What do you consider the A’alue of your land fifteen years ago, when you purchased ?—I do
not knoAV exactly —it belongs to my father.
4584. Has land been rising in value in this district ?—Yes.
4585. What should you say is the value of that land hoav ?—I could not say exactly, I have no idea.
The witness withdrew.
Thomas S. Williams sworn and examined.
4586. By the Board. —l understand you are the oAvner of the land the last Avitness has spoken of ?
—Yes.
4587. You are his father ?—Yes.
4588. When did you purchase the land ?—Fifteen years ago.
4589. What was the value of the land at the time you purchased it ? —Bare, Avithout fences or
anything, it cost me £2 55., and I have put on more than that amount for improvements.
4590. £4 10s. an acre ? —lt cost me more than that.
4591. Has the land been rising iu value since ?—Yes.
4592. Putting aside the silt, Avhat is the value of the land that is affected by the deposit?—About
£5 an acre.
4593. That is the ordinary land ?— The Avhole lot, take it all through.
4594. What is the value of similar land in the locality that is not affected by any silt in the creek ?
—Perhaps £6 an acre.
4595. And Avhat do you consider the existing value of your land now ?—About £5.
4596. You consider the land has been depreciated to the extent of £1 an acre? —I think so. It
was a chain of Avaterholes, all clear, Avhen I purchased it, some 100 yards long and ten feet deep; that is
all filled up.
4597. Are you aware Avhether your deed of conveyance gives you the right of the creek ?—Yes.
4598. Is that shown on the CroAvn grant ?—Yes, you see the creek is included in the rest.
4599. Does the land silt on the bank both sides ? —Both sides of the creek.
4600. With the creek running through the property ?—Yes. I bought it from Duncan Matheson,
fiften years ago; but I daresay it was sold first 30 years ago—the first or second land sale.
The witness withdrew.
William Speed sworn and examined.
4601. By the Board. —You are a landoAvner ? —I am.
4602. Where is your land situated ?—On the Mclvor Creek, and on the W r ild Duck Creek some of it. 1


4603. It is further down from Heatlicote than Mr. Williams’ ?—Yes.
4004. Does it adjoin Mr. Williams?—No.
4GOo. How many acres have you altogether ?—Two thousand.
4606. Are you both sides of the Mclvor ? —I am with 1,000 acres, but lam on the Wild Duck with
the other.
4007. On both sides of the Wild Duck ?—One.
4008. What length of your property fronts the Mclvor Creek ?—I should think about a mile.
4609. And what length fronts down the Wild Duck ?—I should fancy about lialf-a-mile.
4610. Do you suffer from the overflow of water upon your land ?—No.
4011. Is your complaint principally that your cattle and sheep are bogged in the creek? —Yes.
4612. Will von describe in what way you suffer, and to what extent ?—I am a grazier, and wo have
as many as GOO and 700 cattle on the place at a time, and the cattle in coming down to try to get a drink
get bogged, and we perhaps may see them before they perish ; but if we do, we have to pull them out, and
the consequence is that the cattle are no use afterwards.
4013. Strained?—Yes, strained all to pieces.
4614. lloav long ago is it since you had any cattle bogged in the creek ? —Three years ago.
4015. You had none before that ?—No.
4010. Had the sludge reached down as low as your property more than three years ago ?—Yes.
4017. Not to any considerable depth ?—When I purchased the property that I hold now, three years
ago that is, without sludge in the Mclvor.
4618. How is it that none of the cattle were bogged more than three years ago ?—I did not hold that
property before then.
4019. Have you had any cattle in the creek this year? —No.
4020. Are you taking any measures to keep them out by fencing ? —No, not now. We have to movo
them away in consequence of the sludge coming down now.
4021. Where do you water the stock ? —ln dams.
4022. If there were no sludge in the creek, would you water them in the creek ?—Yes.
4023. Is there any quantity of slum being brought down the Wild Duck Creek ?—No.
4624. Has any slum come down at all from the Meadow Valley ?—The Meadow Valley is not near
the Wild Duck at all ; it is away to the westward.
4625. Away from your property?—Yes; the sluicing working from the Meadow Valley comes into
the Mclvor Creek, part of it on my property.
4026. Not into the Wild Duck ? —No.
4627. What should you consider is your loss owing to the sludge ?—Through the sludge coming
down the inconvenience we are put to, and the loss occasioned through not having water to water cattle, I
consider I have lost £l,OOO, or it has depreciated the property to the extent of £l,OOO.
4628. Would you put that at a depreciation all round at 10s. an acre ? —Yes.
4029. Would you obtain the 10s. less if you put it in the market now ? —I think so, and less.
4630. Do you think there is anything injurious to the stock in the water ?—I do not And it; but
common sense must tell you that the stock do suffer from drinking that dirty water.
4631. You do not knoAV any instances where the animals have actually suffered ?—No.
4032. What do you consider the value of your land at present?—Where the garden comes ?
4033. Yes?—About £3.
4634. If there were no sludge, what would you consider the value ?—Five pounds.
4635. You are putting that on the land where the sludge is ?—Yes.
4036. You are not speaking of land covered with a deposit of sludge ?—No, I am merely speaking
of the sludge in the creek.
4637. lloav do you estimate the area of land affected by the sludge unless it applies to the Avhole of
the property ?—lt applies to the Avhole of the 1,000 acres, because it abuts on the creek, and avc cannot get
to the creek to Avater the stock.
4638. Then it is on the 1,000 acres you reckon this loss ?—Yes.
4639. IlaA'e you any suggestions you aa t ouUl like to make to the Board on the question?—The only
suggestion I could think of is to try and stop it. It is just like pea-soup noAV in the creek.
4640. It has been said that if the tailings Avere more completely kept out of the slum sent down it
would be actually Avorse ?—I cannot see Avhy not impound the sludge.
4641. But you have no aclual suggestion to make ? —No.
The witness withdrew.
William Duncan SAVorn and examined.
4042. By the Board. —Are you a farmer here? —Yes.
4643. lloav many acres?—About 120 acres.
4044. Are they agriculture or grazing? —That is Avhat is affected by the sludge.
4045. Where are they situated ?—Adjoining Mr. Peel’s.
4040. On the Heatlicote side or the north ?—On the north.
4647. In Avhat. AA r ay is that 120 acres affected by the sludge?—The flood Avaters the greater
portion of it.
4648. lloav long have you had the property ?—TVenty-seven years.
4649. Before the sludge commenced was your land flooded at times? —Yes, A'ery often; but it did
not do harm then, it did good.
4650. Is the water higher now during flood than it Avas at that time?—No, I do not think it is;
the Avater Avas clean then.
4651. About Avhat depth does the deposit of sludge cover the 100 acres ?—lt does not coA'er all of it,
but it goes OA'er more than half.
4052. About 50 acres ?—Yes, the creek covers about that in high flood, and that is a portion of two
paddocks.
4653. What do you use those flats for?—Wheat and oats.


4654. Had you aiiy crop in last year?—Yes.
4(555. Have you ever put that 50 acres out of crop on account of the sludge ?—I let it lie for nearly
seven years till last year, because of the sluicing; because the first year I totally lost all there was in it by
the flood that came just before harvest.
4656. Might it not occur now ?—Yes, it did so last year, but it only covered about a half then.
4657. You are taking the risk ?—Yes, 1 lost a portion of it last year, but not all.
4658. You put the land into grazing, I suppose? —It was in grazing up to last year.
4651). For five years ?—Yes.
4660. Do you find that if you plough in the sludge with the natural soil that that spoils the crop ?
Yes, I think it does, because I can scarcely touch the sludge; it is too deep—seven or eight inches—where
I plough, and in some places two feet, may be, as every flood of the creek covers it.
4661. Suppose there is no further deposit of sludge in the creek, do you think the land would then
recover entirely ?—I think it might if it was to be ploughed.
4662. It is not a pe-imanent injury ?—lt would require to lie a good time where it is not too deep.
On the banks of the creek, where there is two or three feet, there is not a vestige of grass, and never has
been; where there is two or three inches there is a little on it.
4663. Do you keep any stock?—About twenty cows grazing on this higher land.
4664. Do they water in the creek ? —No.
4665. Why ?—lt is too muddy, and, besides, they cannot go to the creek because of the bogging.
4666. Is the water too thick for them to drink ?—Yes.
4667. What is the effect of their drinking it ?—I consider it would kill them.
4668. Do you know of any instance where it did harm? —Yes, Mr. Hamilton here had a horse died
the other day, and he took a ball a pound weight of sand out of it.
4669. Is there any other risk ?—The cattle would get bogged.
4670. Have you ever lost any ?—Yes, they died in the creek; others I have pulled out and they
died. I pulled them out with bullocks.
4671. How many have died?—l believe I have lost a dozen large cattle already.
4672. And any others injured?—Yes, pulling them all to pieces.
4673. How many injured?—Four or five perhaps ; they were not any more good after being pulled
to pieces.
4674. What have you lost through the silting-up of the creek, do you think, on your actual money
losses in the loss of those cattle ?—The actual money loss would amount to more than £2OO, that is in the
value of the cattle.
4675. In how many years is that ?—The last five years, since the sludge commenced.
4676. Is there anything further you wish to say on the subject?—l hardly know anything further
that I could say.
4677. You said so far as money loss—what do you mean ?—That is the depreciation—the value of
my property.
4678. What do you consider that at ?—I would consider it would be more than £7OO. I paid £8
10s. an acre for the land when I bought it.
4679. For the 120 acres ?—For 104 acres, and then there is another paddock affected by the sludge
that there is twenty acres in, besides that.
4680. That is what you paid for it ?—Yes.
4681. What do you consider the value of the land now, if you were to sell?—I have been offered
£ll an acre for it; but I would not sell it.
4682. That is a profit on that land of £4so—how long is it since you were offered £ll an acre ?
Ten or twelve months, that is before the sludge.
4683. What would you get for the land now ?—I could not say ; I would get a pretty good price
even now, because it is an exceptional piece of land—the flat land of the creek.
4684. Are you the owner ?—Yes.
4685. What do you consider is the actual depreciation per acre of those 124 acres owing to the
sludge ? —lf I had to buy it myself, I would not give within a pound an acre. I have had to make dame,
and have lifted the fence twice on account of the sludge, and it is now sticking to the mud.
The witness withdrew.
Robinson Cox, junior, sworn and examined.
4686. By the Board. —You are a landowner here?—No, it is my father that owns the land.
4687. Are you representing your father to-day ?—I cannot say I am.
4688. You know the land ? —Yes.
4689. Where is the land situated ? —On the Wild Duck.
4690. Whereabouts?—Adjoining Mr. Speed’s. There is no sludge on the part of the creek where we
are living—it does not affect our property.
4691. Then have you anything to say on the subject of sludge ?—I cannot say I have, although I
know a good deal of the damage that is done to neighbours.
4692. Can you speak from your own personal observation —actual knowledge, not merely from hearsay,
what injury it has done ?—Yes.
4693. Give any instance ?—There were splendid waterholes along the Wild Duck below the
junction, about 200 yards long and 25 to 30 feet deep, and they are now filled up—they are level now, you
could walk across them; and I have seen stock stuck in, and helped to pull them but, and generally rhe best
that got in—it was so severe on it the getting it out —it was useless.
4694. Have you seen that in many instances ?—No, not a great many, not being present to pull
them out.
The ivitness withdreio.


Edward L. Moses sworn and examined.
4695. By the Board. —Where is your property ? —On the Mount Ida Creek.
4G96. Whereabouts on the creek?—Four miles from here—the others have made a mistake, it is not
Wild Duck Creek, it is Mount Ida Creek.
4697. Do you mean the same creek that they call the Wild Duck ?—Yes; I will call it that if you
like, but, by Crown grant, it is Mount Ida Creek.
4G98. Can you tell me in what way your property has suffered on the creek ?—The creek has been
silted-up. We had large waterholes when 1 purchased the land.
4699. llow far are you below the junction ?—The junction of Mclvor and the Mount Ida Creek?
4700. Yes?—Part of my land is about a quarter of a mile, and part is a mile and a half.
4701. How many acres have you there ?—One hundred acres.
4702. Do they front the creek? —Yes.
4703. What do you use the land for—agriculture or grazing ?—Agriculture and grazing.
4704. How many acres are Hooded by the creek ?—About twenty, at times.
4705. What are you doing with the twenty acres ?—Cultivating it.
4706. Have you thrown any portion out of cultivation on account of the floods ?—No.
4707. Do you find the silt injures the land where it is ploughed up into ?—The sandy portion does;
hut that that is mixed with clay does not interfere with the land.
4708. Take the average of your crops—what have you in crop this year ?—Oats.
4709. And what last year ?—Oats.
4710. What is your average number of bushels on the land that is not flooded ?—I am growing hay ;
I cut it all for hay.
4711. How many tons do you get off your other land ?—That on the creek I get the most from.
4712. On this land that is flooded ?—Yes.
4713. Then what is your complaint ?—That the creek is silted-up where we used to water our
cattle, and Avhere there were large waterholes in the creek, it is filled up now with silt, and principally
sand at my part.
4714. Do your cattle water in the creek ? —Well, there is water there; but in summer you can walk
from one end of the creek to the other—not a drop of water in it.
4715. That is due to the waterholes being lilled ?—Yes.
4716. Have you ever had cattle bogged in the creek ?—Yes.
4717. On several occasions?—Yes.
4718. How many head ?—I could not say —this has occurred at different times; and we have got
them out, and some died and some did not.
4719. Has your land depreciated in value ?—lf I Was going to buy the land, I would not give so
much, on account of water not being there.
4720. What is the extent of depreciation owing to there not being the water ?—I should think fully
£1 an acre.
4721. How do you water your stock now—by dams on your own property?—Yes, the dams on the
Crown lands.
4722. When did you construct those dams—how many years ago?—About ten years ago.
4723. Then you constructed those dams before the sluicing began ?—There was flooding in the creek
before the sluicing began.
o O
4724. Then the flooding up of the creek is not due entirely to sluicing ?—No, not entirely.
4725. To what extent should you imagine the sluicing has contributed to it ?—The principal water-
holes have been filled up by sluicing. Formerly, they were only partly filled up.
4726. You say, teu years ago, you constructed dams ?—Yes, in one part of my property ; but the
other part I did not, because I have sufficient water there in the creek.
4727. Do you consider you have suffered any absolute loss through the cattle being bogged in the
creek ?—Yes.
4728. To what extent ?—I could not tell you. It has occurred at different times; sometimes the
cattle got over it, and sometimes they did not.
4729. How many years is it since you purchased ?—The first portion of the property was fenced 2(5
years ago.
4730. Was the creek clear then ?—Yes ; there were large waterholes two fathoms deep.
4731. And, ten years ago, they were principally filled up before the sluicing began ?—A very little.
4732. To what extent had the silting-up gone then —at that time, were the waterholes half filled?
—lt had extended down to my place ;it had not gone much below.me.
4733. There was the wash coming down all that time before the sluicing ?—Yes, ever since the gold-
fields opened.
4734. Which would have filled the waterholes in a short time?—No, nothing like the rate it has
gone on with the sluicing ; and the cattle could not drink it. Now, I have had horses bad, and we have
given them medicine, and they have passed balls of sand ; they would not drink the water at the creek.
4735. Is that sluicing water ?—I do not know what other it would be. If you saw the water when
it comas down at twelve in the day, and then the first thing in the morning, you Avould see a great
difference. The cattle, when they are thirsty, will drink when they see the water, whether it is thick or
not, and it injures them.
The witness loithdreio.
James Feehan sworn and examined.
4736. By the Board. —You are President of the Mclvor Shire ? —Yes.
4737. Have you ever received any appeal against the valuation at all, on the ground of injury caused
by the sludge depreciating the property ?—Not that I am aware of.
4738. Has the question of the valuation been taken into consideration, to your knowledge ? —The
depreciation by sludge 1 do not think was ever taken into consideration.
4739. Are you aware of any injury having been done to the creeks ?—Yes.


4740. To wliat extent has it affected any bridges, or done any harm to the works the shire ?
We have a storm crossing that cost the shire £4O to construct, and we had to build a bridge iu the same
place through the sludge.
4741. Is that in the Mclvor Creek ?—Yes.
4742. Is the creek still rising there?—The creek slightly keeps silting-up still.
4743. How long ago is it since you built that bridge?—About three years.
4744. Have you any idea—has it silted up since the three years ?—I noticed the waterlioles further
down the creek get silted up every year worse between here for about five miles from here. They could
not he much worse than they are at present, because there are no holes left; they are all silted up. The
waterlioles further on, and down below the junction of the Wild Duck, are iioav getting filled up rapidly.
4745. Has the council taken any action with regard to the injury caused by the sludge ?—I think
we sent a deputation down about three years ago to the Mining Department in reference to it.
4746. Was there any result from that deputation ?—I could not inform you now Avliat action. I Avas
a member of the council at the time, but I am not prepared to ans Aver Avliat action Avas taken.
4747. Have you been many years in the district? —About 27 years.
4748. With the knoAvledge that you hold of sludge, can you afford any suggestions, or gh r e any
information to the Board ?—I think the sludge should he impounded from the first.
4749. Did you hear the eA r idence given by Mr. Iledley ?—Yes.
4750. Did you hear the question about, the stacking on Commissioners’ Flat ?—Yes.
4751. Are there any reasons connected Avith roads and land leases, &c., that would render it impos-
sible to make use of the flat? —I do not think it.
4752. Granted that the difficulty of mere levels Avere sliOAvn not to be insuperable, do youthen
think it Avould be Avorth Avhile entertaining the project of stacking the slum in Commissioners’ Flat?— l do.
4753. Do you think if that could he done in the Avay you heard suggested in the course of the
examination, Avould that remove the injury from the farmers resident doAvn the creek ?—I think it Avould,
by putting in a dam to prev r ent the sludge getting away until the water Avould settle.
4754. What is done in some other districts is the succession of small loav dams the water thus had
time to settle ?Y r es. I suav it done here some years ago by the puddlers.
4755. And you think it Avould be satisfactory if carried out ?—I think there is sufficient ground to
hold all the debris from those Avorkings during his lease.
4756. And the old workings ?—And the old workings.
4757. Have you ever seen old workings that have been filled up with sludge?—Yes.
4758. Has it proved satisfactory Avith vegetation on it?—Yes, after years.
4759. Has the shire been put to any additional cost OAving to this silting-up — you have mentioned
one instance, one bridge—any other?—That is all that is Avorthy of bringing under your notice—the cost
of that bridge Avas £6OO odd.
4760. To replace the ford previously constructed ?—Yes, which cost us £4O.

WEDNESDAY", lOtii NOVEMBER, 1886.
Present :
R. H. Shake spear, Esq., C.E., in the Chair ;
A. F. Walker, Esq.,
Frederick Appleton sworn and examined.
4761. What is your occupation?—l am a breAver, residing at Eddington.
4762. Tloav long liaA r e you resided there ?—Fifteen years.
4763. Where is your breAvery situate ?■—On the banks of the Loddon, at Eddington.
4764. Do you use the Avater of the Loddon in your business ?—Yes.
4765. lloav long have you known the Loddon River ?—Thirty-three years. When first I kncAv the
Loddon it Avas a chain of Avaterholes. It Avas not running all the year round.
4766. Have you seen floods in the river so far back ? —Yes, I have seen floods about that time and
since, but they never left any silt behind like they do noAV.
4767. When did you first notice the silting-up taking place? — Within the last fifteen years. When
I Avent to the breAvery first, the Avaterhole in front of the brcAvrery Avas 23 feet in depth; iioav it is only
bctAveen three and four feet in the natural bed, the deepest part. At. that time there was a log on the edge
of the river-bank, from which I could dive into six feet of Avater. This log is now eight feet buried in the
slum.
4768. That shows a deposit of fourteen feet in fifteen years ?Y r es.
4709. Have you noticed Avhether the natural bed of the river is silting-up? —No, the bed of the
river does not silt up, but the Avaterholes get filled, slioAving that the silt is being carried doAvn by every
flood.
4770. Have you any knowledge of the Deep Creek ?—Yes, I have knoAvn it since *54. It Avas
then a beautiful stream. It junctions Avith the McCallum*s Creek at Carisbrook.
4771. Is the bed of the Deep Creek silted-up ?Y r es, it is very much silted-up, and is still rising.
iSHTDOE. S


4772. Is'the silt in the Loddon, opposite your place at Eddington, increasing annually?—Yes,
About five years ago I erected a fence for the purpose of keeping cattle out. It was lour feet high, hut
it is now nearly covered up with silt. The silting has averaged one foot a year.
4773. Do you put. the Loddon water through any process before using it in the brewery ?—Yes,
I boil it ; the boiling makes it clearer. In a bucket of water gallons) there is usually three-fourths of
an inch of sediment. The cold water tanks (400 gallons each) are cleaned once a month in winter time.
They usually contain two inches of sediment. After a heavy continuous rain, of say a; couple of days*
duration, there is a deposit of about six inches.
4774. Is the water brackish? —No, but in summer time, when it is clear, it is very hard.
4775. Do you know the Bet Bet Creek ?—Yes, it brings a large amount of silt into the Loddon
from the mines at Chinaman's Flat and the Alma.
4776. It is also silted-up, is it not?—Yes, it is completely filled up, almost level with the banks
and every flood spreads the silt over the banks, to the in jury of the adjacent property.
4777. To what extent are adjacent lands injured ? —The flood-water goes on the lands to the extent
of eight or ten chains in some places.
4778. llovv docs it injure the lands ?—lt spoils them for producing grain.
4779. Are the waters of the Bet Bet and the Deep Creek brackish. ?—The Bet Bet water is
hrackish, owing to mining operations; but the Deep Creek is so diluted by fresh streams that the quality of
its water has not been very much injured.
4780. Do you consider the Bet Bet water injurious ?—Yes, I could not use it in brewing. I have
been informed by two brewers, who formerly carried on business at Newbridge, that the principal cause of
their closing was the badness of the water. This was about ten years ago. Previous to that time they
were doing a good business.
4781. Are you acquainted with the Laanecoorie district ?—Yes. At one time there was a fine
waterkole, about mile in length, there, but now it is entirely filled up with sludge from the Bet Bet.
Originally the water was twenty feet deep. The filling up has been at the rate of about one foot per year.
4782. Has the natural bed of the creek been also silted-up ?—No, only the waterlioles.
4788. Is this deposit of one foot per year working down the Loddon gradually? —I should say it
must do so.
4784. To what do you attribute the deposit ?—I attribute it, first, to mining, especially sluicing ;
secondly, to natural disintegration of the soil through agricultural operations; and, thirdly, to the washing
down of old alluvial workings, and of roads having channels.
4785. Can you give any idea of the proportion of deposit due to mining, and to agricultural opera-
tions respectively ?—No, I could not say.
4786. Do you consider that, if there were no mining, the deposit would be less than one foot per
year ?—Yes, it would certainly be very much less.
4787. Are you aware whether any injury has been done to farmers on the Bet Bet or the Loddon
through sludge?—l know of several farmers on the Bet Bet who have suffered injury, but I have not heard
of any on the Loddon.
4788. Have you any suggestions to offer with regard to the steps that should be taken to mitigate
the injury ?—The only course I can suggest is to compel the mines to retain the sludge on their own ground
by stacking it.
The witness withdrew.
Hugh Pearson sivorn and examined.
4789. You are a storekeeper, I believe, residing here at Newbridge ?—Yes.
4790. How long have you known the River Loddon ?—Twenty-five years.
4791. Will you describe to the Board the difference in the appearance of the river then and now?—
The east side is considerably silted-up, and the flood of 1871 scoured out a new channel.
4792. Do you know of any land injured by deposit of sludge in high floods ?—Yes, Mr. Kay’s
Elmsford estate, three miles up; also two flats on the east side, near Newbridge.
4793. Is the deposit injurious to the land ?—lf it does not come too often, or when the crop is a
certain height it is a fertilizer. Landowners do not complain of it.
4794. Does the silt gather in the summer ? —Yes.
4795. And the winter rains remove it I suppose ? —I cannot say.
4796. Is the bod of the river silting-up ? —No, only the waterlioles.
4797. You have heard the evidence of Mr. Appleton—do you agree with it ?—Yes generally.
The vntness withdrew.
Henry Erwin sworn and examined.
4798. What is your occupation? —I am an accountant,
4799. Residing at Newbridge ?—Yes.
4800. How long have you known the Loddon ? —'Twenty-six years.
4801. Can you add anything concerning it to the evidence given by Mr. Appleton and Mr. Pearson?
—No, I cannot add anything material. I endorse what they have stated.
4802. Do you know of any cases in this district in which the value of the land has been depreciated
through sludge ? —No. I consider the sludge is beneficial to the land.
4803. Did the river originally contain fish ?Y r es, and fish are still sometimes to be found in it after
floods —in the Avaterholes.
4804. Is the water injurious ?—ln summer time, when the water is clearer, it is more injurious than
in winter.
4805. When did you first notice the sludge travelling down the river?—As far as Newbridge is
concerned, it has been principally within the last four years.
The witness withdrew.


F. G. Martin sworn and examined.
4806. Will yon please state your occupation and place of residence? —I am a veterinary surgeon and
farmer, residing at Newbridge.
4807. How long have you been a resident here ?—About 3d years. I was here before the bridge
was built, and helped to put it up. I was then a Government oilicer.
4808. Where is your property situate ?—lt fronts the Fiver Loddon.
4809. Of what description is the natural soil ?—lt is a light one, twelve inches deep, overlying clay.
4810. lias the land been injured through deposits of sludge?—Formerly the deposits did good, but
since mining commenced they are injurious. Four years ago I put in live acres of lucerne near the river.
The first year it was very good, but since that not a blade lias come up. The deposits are poisonous, oven-
if ploughed in with the natural soil which is not strong enough to stand the admixture of the silt.
4811. Do you consider the river is being continually silted up?—l do; and during the last ten or
twelve years, when a flood occurs, the land over which the flood flows becomes poisonous.
4812. Has your property become depreciated in value? —My holding is a small one, only half-a-milo
frontage to the river; my house is half-a-mile away.
4813. Do you think the water is injurious to stock ?—During the summer months the water becomes
clearer, and it is then poisonous, not good for stock. If you water plants with it,, they die after a few
applications.
The witness withdrew.
Thomas Ramsay examined.
4814. What is your occupation ?—I am a farmer, residing here at Newbridge, and at the present
time President of the Ret Ret Shire.
4815. Has your land suffered in any way through deposits of sludge? —No. I consider the sludge
a service if the deposits do not occur too often ; but I am aware that higher up, nearer the mines, it is
injurious.
4816. What depth of deposit do you consider to be beneficial ? —About four inches, so that you can
raise part of the original soil with the plough.
4817. What is the character of your soil ? —At the bottom clay, and above it black soil. In a pad-
dock of mine, about ten acres in extent, which is composed entirely of sludge about four feet deep, I have
now a crop of wheat five feet high. I take the crop off for hay before the dry weather comes in.
4818. Does vegetation on sludge deposits become dried up during the summer months ?—Yes. About
eight years ago I sowed a paddock of lucerne where there was a deposit of sludge, but it completely dried
up when the dry weather came. I have, at the present time, a good crop of wheat in the same paddock.
This paddock has not been flooded since 1870.
4819. How long have yon been resident here ? —About eighteen years.
4820. Is the river different now from what it was then ? —No, it is just about the same.
4821. Is the water brackish ?—ln the summer the water is clear and is then slightly brackish. It
is not, I think, injurious to stock but nourishing for them. During the winter the water smells badly, and
stock do not like it ; dead carcases being brought down by it. '
4822. Do you allow your stock to water in the river ? —Yes, always.
4823. Do you think the silt is travelling down the river?—l cannot say. I don’t think the mining
sludge has yet reached me.
4824. Do you know Rridgewater ?—Yes ; but I cannot say whether the sludge has yet reached there.
4825. As president of the shire, have you heard any complaints about the Loddon or the Ret Ret?
—I have not heard of any complaints about the Loddon, but I have heard complaints about the Ret Ret.
Farmers complain of the watcrholes being filled up with mining sludge through the miners not storing it.
4826. Was the Ret Ret brackish before mining commenced ?—No.
4827. I understand you to say that cattle and horses like the water of the Loddon about Newbridge?
—Yes.
4828. Has your shire council had any appeals against rates on the grounds of depreciation of
property through sludge?—Yes ; two complaints have been made that the value of land has depreciated on
the banks of the Ret Ret, but none as to land on the Loddon.
The xoitness withdrew.

SATURDAY, 13tii NOVEMRER, 1886.
Present:
R. 11. Shakesrear, Esq., in the Chair:
A. F. Walker, Esq.
Henry Mitton Parker sworn and examined.
4829. By the Board. —What is your occupation ? —I have a public-house and I have some land.
4830. Where is your land situated?—l have a piece at Mount Rowan, but my freehold is on the
Rurrumbeet Creek in Dowling Forest. I have a plan of the ground, I was intending to bring in to show
the exact locality, but I could not find it when I came in.
4831. Does your land suffer from sludge or de'bris from mining?—Yes.
4832. W hat mines deliver debris on to your land ? —I have never traced it up, but the shire engineer,


Mr. Bail’ll, has been up sonic years ago, anil they found some Chinamen sluicing on the range behind what
is called the Black Hill Spur, the head of Dead-horse Gully ; they had been sluicing some hill or hills and
bringing the water over the rangss. Mr. Bath and Mr. Morton, on some business, called on the Minister
of Mines some years ago, and he could give them no hopes of any alteration in the matter.
4833. It is from sluicing yon suffer ?—Any alluvial mines. There have been some at the head of this
creek, they did not send out a quantity; it is this washing with a large quantity of water and sluicing the
hills that does the damage.
4834. The water comes down your creek coloured ? —Just like gruel.
4835. What amount of cattle have you ?—I have had very few lately ; I have no grass for them.
4836. What arrangements have you for watering your cattle?—The creek used to have nice water,
but now they will not drink it owing to the sluicing.
4837. It is too thick for them to drink ?—Yes, and mixed with mineral water, and it has destroyed
the grass and covered the ground something like from a few inches to four feet in some places, up to the
height of the fence. I planted a hedge round it and it has killed that ground; 40 acres that I had a
revenue on of £6O a year, and now I do not know what it is worth; it is seven or eight miles from Ballarat.
It was worth £2O an acre for grass, with a beautiful black soil, it is a special piece of ground, and now it
acts as a filter-bed, that long grass, and the sludge lodges there, and I am the most unfortunate victim of
any there.
4838. How many acres do you consider have been injured by this deposit of sludge ?—About 42.
4839. The creek overflows in flood-time?—Yes.
4840. What depth of deposit does it leave on your land each time ? —I could not say that.
4841. What is the depth now? —From a few inches to three feet.
4842. What do you use that land for now ?—1 never had it anything but grass.
4843. It is grass now ?—Y”es.
4844. Is it capable of carrying as much stock as before ?—I have had only one cow and a foal this
month, but the sludge is so much like gruel.
4845. The A r egetation is not through it?—Only the tussocks of grass; but to put stock on it makes
it worse still.
4846. What would be the depreciation of your property through the loss of these 42 acres ?—I con-
sider the land is worth £2O an acre in grass, or that the 42 acres was Avorth £6O a year to me.
4847. What is it Avorth hoav ?—Not A r ery much ; I have only had two head of stock on it this tAvclve
months.
4848. Do you also suffer by the loss of the Avater as a means of Avatering your stock ?—Yes, there is
a creek that used to be six feet deep in part of the paddock, anil that Avould keep water all the year round.
4849. Have you made any other arrangements for Avatering your stock ?—No, avc bring them home.
4850. Do you Avater them in the creek ?—There are some holes not quite in the creek, and they get
filled occasionally and dry up again, so, excepting in summer, Ave are able to Avater them there.
4851. Y r ou say that some of your neighbours have also been injured ?—Yes.
4852. Can you give the names ?—One is Mr. Henry Parks, and Mr. Holgate ; I understood he Avas
coming here.
4853. Are they above you on the same creek ?—One is above and the other is alongside of me, a
little above me.
4854. Have you ever taken any action as to the ground of complaint? — Yes; avo had a meeting, and
they are rather backward, Avliich I have had to complain about, and there Avere perhaps half-a-dozen
atteuded, and then grumbled since there Avas not some action taken, and I said —“ It is your own faults.”
4855. Did the meeting lapse ?—No. We saAV Mr. Morton and Mr. Bath, and they called on the
Minister of Mines, or some person in authority in Melbourne, and represented the case to them, and they
said nothing could be done.
4856. How long ago is that? —Four or five years ago.
48.57. How many years have you been in possession of that land?—Nearly thirty-two.
4858. lloav many years ago is it since that stream Avas first polluted ?—I should think about the
time avo took action, four or five years.
4859. Not before ? —Not much ; it may have been a little.
4860. If you haA r e not folloAved up that creek, it is merely on hearsay that you say injury has been
done by sluicing ?—Yes; but the evidence is pretty good. It Avas our engineer, Brigauger, since dead,
avlio said it.
4861. Is there any quartz mining up the creek ?—Very little.
4862. The debris is entirely sluicing, so far as you knoAv ?—Yes. There used to be five or six
Avaterholes as deep as this room is high; they have been all filled up. I say that for the benefit of the
Miner's Rest township. We had water all the year round, and the travelling stock has had to suffer.
The witness tvithdrew.
Andrew Berriman SAVorn and examined.
4863. By the Board. —What is your occupation ? —Mining manager.
4864. For Avhat claim ?—The Buninyong estate and the Desoza claims.
4865 Tavo claims ?—Y"es.
4866. Is the Buninyong estate claim held under lease ?—Not under Government lease.
4867. What is the area of your claim ?—lt is about half-a-mile long, but I do not knoAv exactly the
width.
4868. Along the line of the reef ?—Yes, from north to south.
4869. You do not know the width ?—Approximately I might tell; about 600 or 700 feet.
4870. lloav many years has the Buninyong Estate Company been at Avork?—About five or six years.
4871. Can you give us any information approximately as to the number of tons that have been
crushed during that five or six years ?—About 20,000 tons.
4872. lloav many head of stamps have you ? —Fifteen.


4873. Where do you obtain the water from ? —What is coining from the shaft and the Buniuyong
reservoir, and the Instate dam—three sources.
4874. Where do you send your debris or tailings ?—Part, of it has been pumped up into the dam,
and part runs into a blind creek.
4875. About what proportion of this number of tons has been placed in a'dam, and how much run
into the creek —approximately ?—About 5,000 tons have been stored, and the remainder, about 15,000,
passed into the blind creek.
4876. What was your object in stacking the 5,000 tons ?—Partly to bauk up the dam and make it
water-tight, and partly to supply water to work over again.
4877. To conserve water for your own use?—Yes; that was before we had flaming put up from the
Estate dam.
4878. Since you have had that you have not found it necessary to conserve water ?_ —No.
4870. And therefore you send all your tailings into the creek? —Yes.
4880. Has any complaint ever been made against your sending the tailings into the creek ?—No, not
that I am aware of.
4881. Have you ever been connected with any mines that stacked their tailings?—Yes; very often
they had occasion to do so when they had no supply of water to work their Avater over again.
4882. That is merely for the purpose of conserving their water ?—Yes, solely. .
4883. What would be the difliculty in your stacking tailings in your present site ?—lt would be a
very expensive undertaking, and being on private property it would occupy a large piece of ground.
4884. To whom does that private property belong ?—The Bank of New South W ales.
4885. Is not the bank interested in the mine ?—They have a percentage of the gold, and the company
also pays a rental.
4886. Have you any idea what that value of the land is that is held by the bank per acre? —No ; I
do not know; it would be a hard matter to estimate that, I think.
4887. Putting aside the value of the land required to stack the tailings, what would be the actual
cost to the compay of constructing dams and maintaining them to stack the tailings you are now throwing
out ?—The cost to the company would be something enormous.
4888. What do you call enormous —place .it in figures ?—That is to make dams and to stack the
tailings. To begin with, Ido not think the bank would agree to cutting up their property.
4889. That is another question; put that aside ?—The getting rid of the tailings is such a trivial
matter that I do not think it would be once entertained ?
4890. It may be trivial to the bank, to the owners of the property, and to yourself, but all that goes
doAvn into the Leigh River ?—The quantity is so little—2o,ooo tons in five years.
4891. That is from your claim only?—Yes.
4892. But there is the other claim also, the Desoza ?—That has not been crushing for a long time.
4893. What quantity did they send doAvn ? —We stacked a lot of those tailiugs on the claim.
4894. Why ?—To conserve the Avater to use it over again.
4895. Did you find that A\ r as a very costly business ?—Yes, very.
4896. Then there is freehold after you ?—Yes.
4897. Did they stack their tailing?—Yes, they kept the tailings on the ground for the purpose of
conserving the Avater.
4898. They did not send the tailings into the creek ?—No.
4899. That claim is still at Avork ?—Not in full operation for some time; I belioA-e there is a party
in it.
4900. They are continuing to stack ?—Well, they arc crushing, but they have not crushed for a long
time, but they ahvays stacked so as to conserve the Avater.
4901. What Avould be the cost to the company, independently of the purchase of land from the bank,
of constructing a bank and stacking the tailings that you are throwing out ? —Two hundred pounds a year to
clean the sand pits alone.
4902. What do you mean by that? —Emptying them.
4903. If you constructed tAVO or three dams, running from one into the other,Avliy would you have to
empty ? —I Avas thinking of Avorking the Avater over again.
4904. But you are not dealing Avith that, you have your OAvn Avater, so the expense Avould be simply
to run the tailiugs into the dams, and raise the dams as they become full—that Avould be the sole expense?
—ln that case you avoulcl scarcely Avant to sink any dams, you Avould run it doAvn hill ; the sand Avould
make a dam for itself, but the depression is so little that it Avould soon bank up, and back on your
machinery.
4905. Is there not a very fair slope—in fact, a heavy slope—from your machinery doAvn to the
creek ; that flume is very high ?—Yes, there is a slope, I think, that would bank it back in time. If you
run the tailings doAvn there, avc would not want to sink any dams. The sand Avould construct its OAA T n
bank.
4906. Just at the first start, to keep it from spreading ? —Yes.
4907. Is there any practical difficulty as to that being done ?—I doubt whether the bank would
consent to running the sand over their land.
4908. I ask you simply as a mining manager ? —No difliculty at all, if it Avas CroAvn lands.
4909. The difficulty, if any, lies in obtaining the use of the land ?—Yes.
4910. If the Desoza Avere at Avork, the same Avould hold good? —Yes, avc could stack it there.
4911. And it is stacked somewhat ?—Yes, a good deal to Avork the Avater over again.
The roitness toilhdrew.
Theophilus Williams SAVorn and examined.
4912. By the Board. —What is your occupation?—Mining manager, at present.
4913. Of Avhat company? —Llanberis Company.
4914. What area of ground is comprised Avithin that lease ?—About 86 acres altogether.
4915. Hoav many stamps haA’e you at Avork ? —Thirty.


4916. Do you use si tailings-pump ?—Yes, we lisive a ecntrifugstl pump.
4917. Cau you inform the Board how many tons have been crushed since that company ivas
formed ?—No, but our average number of tons, until about ten years ago, wsis about 1,000 tons a fortnight;
since that it varies from 500 to 700 tons.
4918. You stack the tailings ?—Wo stack all the tailings.
4911). Do you do that for the purpose of conserving water ?—Partly, and for the other reason—we
have no place to run them. The town council has the channel, and will not allow us to run it into that, so
that we sire obliged to stack it.
4920. How many dams have you for the purpose of stacking ?—One.
41)21. Do you run the water away ?—We pass it into another dam.
41)22. Then you have more than one dam ? —Yes.
41)23. Then you pass it from one into another ?—Yes.
41)24. And you find that water becomes clear ?—Yes.
41)25. Whore does the water ultimately pass from your second dam—do you re-use the whole of it ?
—Yes.
4926. You pass none away ?—No.
4927. What means have you of cleaning the dams in the case of heavy rains—have yon bottom
sluices? —No, it would run off at the top.
4928. What is the cost to the company of maintaining those two dams ?—lt requires one man
constantly.
4929. Can you inform the Board what is the area of those settling dams?—Judging from the
surface, I think it is from six to eight acres.
4930. How long have the tailings been running into those dams—how many years ?—The last
twenty years.
4931. They represent the work of twenty years?—Yes, with the exception of when winter floods
come. We have a way of opening the dams for the sludge to run away.
4932. To relievo you from the weight of the storm-water? —Yes.
4933. You are not allowed now? —Within the last three years we made an arrangement with the
town council that when the dams overflow the Gong Gong, they give us the water to carry the sludge
to fill some depressions they have got there.
4934. That is by arrangement with the council? —Yes.
4935. You at present pass your tailings across the channel across on to land on the opposite side ?
—Yes
4936. And they give you water in return ?—Yes.
4937. If that is the case, you do not find that the mere stacking of your sludge is such a very
serious matter to the company ? —lt is a benefit to the council at present to fill up those hollows.
1938. Is there any suggestion you would like to make? — l had a little experience about twenty
years ago, in connexion ivith the sludge out at a farm I had at the Lake Wendouree, at the time the
Garibaldi and Essex Avere at Avork. One year, Avlien the council refused to send the Avater into the lake or
SAvamp, it Aims run doivn to a paddock of six acres that I used for English grass, and that ivas the best
year I had in that paddock.
4939. Was that quartz or alluvial ? —Alluvial.
4940. You have never seen an instance of quartz tailings being of use ?—No. Then they ran the
sludge over tivo acres of ground, and that did good.
4941. What depth of sludge had you ? —lt did good in tivo ivays. In the first place, those three
acres I thought ivcre ruined; after that 1 found a fine groivth of ivhite clover on it. Other parts of the
farm ivhere there is only a quarter of an inch of sludge lying on it, it did it good.
4942. It is only a thin deposit? —Yes, A r ery thin; hut I ivas afraid then it ivould spoil it altogether.
4943. Was it the pipe-clay sludge ?—No, clay from the alluvial—not quartz.
The toitness unthdrew.
George Sinclair sworn and examined.
4944. lhj the Board. —What company is it you are manager of ?—Doivliug Forest Estate, No. 1.
4945. What is the area of the lease ?—Eight hundred and sixty-three acres.
4946. Is there any condition attached to the lease preventing you from depositing sludge on the
land ?—I am not aivare of any. I think it is intended that the slum should ho stacked.
4947. You are not aware of any clause in the lease compelling it to ,be stacked ?—I think there is,
probably.
4948. How long has the company been at ivork?—About four years.
4949. Can you give the Board any idea of the quantity of ivasli that you have passed through?—
We have put through an average of tivo machines a iveek for six months.
495<>. You have not been Avashing for more than that ?—Yes, hut before that it did not exceed a
machine a iveek.
4951. For what length of time ivas that ?—Extending over about eighteen months previous to that.
4952. Do you stack the sludge ?—Yes.
4953. The ivhole of it ? —Yes.
4954. What is the system by ivliich you stack —have you one or more than one dam ?—Three dams.
4955. Do you pass the ivater from one into the other ?—Yes.
4956. And then let the ivater off at the last, or re-use it?—lt runs aivay.
4957. Clear?—Pretty near—a little milky.
4958. What do you find is the expense to the company in maintaining those dams? —At present
about 80s. per iveek. If the company ivas in full ivork it ivould take £5 or £6 a week to keep them going.
4959. You ivould have to increase the size of the dams ?—Yes; it is a very steep incline on the fall
of the hill. It is not the same surface area, the hanks are a fair height.
4960. You have a large amount of headings in the claim ?—Yes.


49G1. Would there be any serious expense in utilizing those headings to form your dams ?—A
considerable expense in carting or trucking it.
4962. Would the expense of utilizing this be too great. Would it be cheaper to excavate? —Yes,
■when you have three dams you can raise it up with sludge after a time when it dries.
4963. You say the water passes off milky ?—A little.
4964. There was none passing while we were there. Would it be possible by increasing the size
of the dams to render the water still clearer? —No, you could not run it oft’ much clearer.
4965. lias any complaint been made as to the quality of the water run off from the sludge dams ?
—No.
4966. Where does that water run ?—Down that small creek, Sulky Dully Creek, and into the
Creswick Creek.
4967. What quantity of mine water do you raise ? —Eighty thousand gallons in 24 hours.
4968. Is that water of good quality ?—Perfectly fresh.
4969. Not brackish ? —No.
4970. Is it clear ?—Mostly.
4971. Do you use the water —is it fit for human consumption ?—Yes, the men drink it below, and
we use it on the top as well, after it settles.
4972. You pass that water direct into Sulky Gully ?—lt passes right away.
4973. And it mixes Avith AvhateA’cr you send olf the sludge dams ?—Yes, there is an agreement with
the Midas Company to take all our surplus Avater for puddling purposes, so there will be no Avater except
the overflow from the slum going into the creek. It will not pass into the creek until it leaves the Midas;
50.000 gallons in the 24 hours Avill go to the Midas.
4974. Have you had any complaint made as to passing the mine Avaters or sludge through the
properties beloAv you ?—No.
4975. I thought there had been a complaint made by Mr. BroAvn, farmer? —The drains AVere not
properly cleaned out through his property, and he only complained that, Avlien there Avas a flood came it
overflowed and Avent through his property, and it Avent over his land, but Avhcn there Avas the ordinary
Avater from the mine it did not disturb him. He has applied to the council to get a storm-Avater channel in
another direction.
4976. No complaint has been raised hv him at present ? —No, the drains have been enlarged since.
4977. Do you consider there is any probability of much larger, more extended area of mining in the
Midas group ?—Yes, there is bound to be a large amount of country opened there.
4978. The drainage Avill all be into Sulky Creek ?—All on the eastern side of the range, but on the
Avest it Avill go the other Avay.
4979. From the Midas it Avill run into the Sulky Gully ?—Yes, all of it, the Midas and the North
Midas and ours will all go into Sulky Gully.
4980. What other companies are at present Avorking ?—No others; there Avill be in a mouth or tAvo.
4981. At the present there is only your oAvn and the Midas ?—That is all.
The loitness withdrew.
John Dalgleish sworn aiid examined.
4982. By the Board. —You are a farmer?—Yes.
4983. Where is your land situated ?—I might state I appear on account of the shire council, though
lam sorry the president is not here, because the road is getting A r ery much blocked up by sludge from the
Sulky Gully lead.
4984. What shire do you represent ?—The Shire of Ballarat.
4985. What road do you speak of ?—The road at Sulky Gully, bcloAV the Midas.
4986. The sludge has overfloAved that road ?—The sludge from the Midas comes doAvn and makes it
impassible.
4987. Has the council taken any action ?—They have been served Avith a notice, but they do not
seem to take any notice of it.
4988. Are you a member of the council ?—-Yes.
4989. And the council have sent notice to the Midas, and no action has been taken by them ?—As
yet, nothing. lam speaking of the Midas.
4990. That company is hoav attempting to partially stack their sludge; is that in consequence of any
action taken by you ?—I think it is to benefit themselves —on account of the property oAvner —to protect
the land. It Avould be all over the country if they did not stack it.
4991. Is the nuisance continued of sending stuff doAvn that road ?—Yes, the last day or tAvo.
4992. If avc had heavy rains, the roads Avould be all flooded ?—The road will be impassible if they
do not stack. The company can keep the mine sludge back, but not the Avater. But some do not seem to
care to do it, and the stuff goes aAvay.
4993. llqav long is it since you sent notice to the company ?—We sent tAvice; the last notice the
secretary got orders about on Monday.
4994. In Avlmt terms —are you giving them to understand that you Avill take further action ?
1 suppose so.
4995. Hoav long is it since this injury to the road commenced ?—lt has continued for a tAvelve-
month, since they began to Avash. Not only that, but they have been laying pipes doAvn, and bringing
them across the road; and they haA’e been a great annoyance to the council and the ratepayers.- But it is
no use taking notice; they take no notice of us.
4996. Have you, as a council, received complaints from farmers and landoAvners as to the creek being
injured—polluted—the Avater?—No, not as to the Avater, but as to the road.
4997. No complaints for the Avater ?—No.
4998. You have knoAvn that creek—Sulky Gully — lioav long ?—The last 32 years.
4999. Do you consider that that creek is being injured ?—I do. There were some fine Avaterholea
some time ago, and hoav they are all sanded up; and Avhcn a flood comes it overfloAVs and destroys the
grass—from the debris.


. JiOOO. Have you any land fronting that creek ?—]\ly land is not there.
5001. Is it affected ?—lt is below the Criterion claim. My land has risen for more than eighteen
months; and they seem to he very careless.
5002. Where is your land, as regards the Midas claim ? South. The drainage from my land will
go into Burrumbeet Creek, not Sulky Gully.
5008. Do you consider your land will be injured?—Not by the Midas; but by other claims, if they
do not take proper steps. The water will injure it; but not to the same extent as if they were stacking
the sludge.
5004. You say you have raised your land—is that for watering purposes ? —Yes.
5005. Have you put any clause into your lease compelling the company to take steps to stack or
otherwise provide for their sludge ?—There is a clause to that effect, I believe. There is a clause to the
effect, that whatever area they destroy they have to pay compensation.
5006; How much per acre would that come to ?—Thirty pounds.
The witness vnthdrew.
Ilenry Parks sworn and examined.
5007. By the Board. —What is your business? —A farmer and dairyman.
5008. Where situated ?—Close on the township of Miner’s Rest.
5009. Is any portion of vour property affected by the sludge ?—Yes, a good portion of it.
5010. From which mine? —From the Burrumbeet Creek the sludge comes.
5011. Which mines are affecting you ?—I cannot say, but I think it is from Chinamen sluicing.
5012. You were not here when Mr. Parker gave his evidence? —No.
5018. Your case will be the same as his? —Exactly; my property and his are adjoining.
5014. D 9 you find that water is injurious to your stock? —Very injurious when the water is thick,
they will not touch it at all.
5015. Then you have to make other provision ? —lf it was not for a well I have at my house, even
in the winter, I could not water my stock, the cattle will not touch it.
5010. Does the sludge form a deposit on any portion of your land ?—Yes.
5017. On what acerage does it deposit on ? —Close on 40.
5018. About what thickness of deposit ?—The worst part of it, after a flood, is six inches thick, it
covers it all over, you cannot see a particle of grass.
5019. What do you use that land for?—Grazing and agriculture; but through this sludge, some
portion, which I would use for agriculture, I cannot.
5020. If the deposit does not exceed six inches in the worst places, have you never ploughed it up
with the natural soil ? —No.
5021. Would that be injurious and less good than the natural soil ?—I cannot say.
5022. What is the nature of the natural soil ?—A grey soil.
5023. Heavy ? —A portion is excellent soil, black.
5024. Would six inches of sludge on that be a permanent injury when ultimately worked up with
the natural soil?—I think so.
5025. What do you consider your loss on that 40 acres ?—The grass is completely lost.
5026. How many cattle would that 40 acres maintain ?—Twelve head.
5027. What does it maintain now ? —About half that quantity.
5028. You loose the maintenance of six head of cattle per year, and are you put to greater expense
or loss through having to water your cattle the other way ?—A great loss.
5029. Can you give an estimate of that ? —I could not ; but it is a great trouble to myself and the
children to be continually watering the cattle, which I would not have to do but for the sludge.
5030. How many acres have you ?—One hundred and sixty-five.
5031. Suppose you put this into the market, would the value he depreciated in consequence of the
sludge nuisance in the creek ?—Considerably.
5032. Can you give any idea what the amount of depreciation would be per acre ? —I expect that
part that is affected by the sludge would be £3 per acre depreciation.
5033. That is on 40 acres? —Yes.
5034. Then you find that vegetation does not grow on it ?—lt is impossible for a time, it would
come through, but when the sludge comes again it covers it again.
5035. The sludge is constantly deposited ?—Yes.
503 G. How long ago is it since it was first deposited ?—There was a big flood this winter.
5037. But how many years back ?—I have not been there long, only seven months.
5038. There was a deposit prior to your coming there ?Y r es, I was not so well acquainted with it
as I am now.
5039. In what way ? —I have seen the floods. If I had seen the floods and the sludge Ido not
think I would have gone there.
5040. You consider the sludge is a real serious injury that would have prevented your buying the
land? —Yes, very serious.
The witness withdrew.
Henry Symons sworn and examined.
5041. By the Board. —What is your occupation? —Butcher and farmer.
5042. Where ?—Mount Rowan.
5043. Do you hold land there ?—Yes.
5044. How many acres ?—Six hundred acres.
5045. Is any portion of that injured by sludge ?—About 20 acres.
5046. From what mine ?—I could not tell exactly, but according to report it comes from some
sluicing parties up in the ranges.


5047. Is your property adjoining that of Mr. Parkins ?—No, nearer the source, within throe miles
from where we are sitting now.
5048. And twentv acres are injured ?—Yes.
5049. Yorr have heard the evidence given by Mr. Parkes, do you agree with that ? —1 only heard
the latter part of it.
5050. Will you describe the injury to those twenty acres ?—lt has silted up the bottom of the creek,
and the sludge has spread over the land for a depth of from six inches to three feet, the watcrholes filled
up that Avere at least from ten to fifteen chains nAvay from the creek.
5051. Putting aside the Avaterholes, to Avhat depth has the creek been filled up betAveen the water-
holes —the natural bed of the creek ?—ln some places it is 0A T er tAvo feet to more than that.
5052. Is that creek still filling ?—Yes.
5053. Is that the Burrumbeet Creek ?—This is the head of it.
5054. When did the injury commence ?—I think four or five years ago. It has been gradually
spreading every year—more acreage.
5055. Was it a clear stream prior to that ?—Yes.
5050. What do you uoav use that tAveuty acres for ?—Nothing.
5057. It is useless ?—lt is useless.
5058. Were you in possession of the land prior to .this four or five years ?—Yes.
5059. What did you use it for then ?—Grazing.
50G0. What head could you graze on it ? —We have never had it stocked to its full capabilities, I
expect.
5061. What does the general average of your land carry ?—I could not tell you. Some occasions
Ave had a lot of stock, and sometimes a little.,
5062. What Avas the value of that land for grazing purposes prior to its being injured ?—Nine
pounds an acre Ave gave for it then.
5063. And iioav ?—lt is increased in Auilue, being so near the toAvn.
5064. What Avould you get for it noAV ?—I could not say. As far as grazing is concerned, it is
wholly destroyed.
5005. Then Avhat is it good for, is it good for agricultural purposes?—l expect it Avould be, if it Avas
cultivated, but Avhether it Avould be Avith tAvo feet of sludge on it, remains to be proved. The land adjoining
that was sold for betAveen £l5 and £l6 per acre last month.
5066. Land not injured by sludge ?—Yes.
The witness withdrew.
Robert Bryant sAvorn and examined.
5067. By the Board. —You are manager of the Midas ?—Yes.
5068. lloav long have you been washing? —Close on tAvelve months.
5069. Can you give any idea of the quantity you have put through ?—No, I can only give a fair
estimate of what Ave have put through—the last three months something like 150 tons in tAventy-four
hours. We have been treating washdirt.
5070. What is the area of your claim?—l could not say. It is aA r ery largo claim—about a mile by
a mile and a half.
5071. Altogether on private land?—Yes.
5072. Is there any condition in your lease compelling you to stack'sludge ?—I do not think so, but
lam not in a position to state. I have not seen the documents.
5073. Are you stacking at present ?—Yes, stacking all our sludge.
5074. Upon Avhat grounds are you stacking noAV —Avhat are your reasons ?—Simply to keep it from
going doAvn the channels.
5075. Not merely for the purpose of conserving Avater ?—No.
5076. Were you here when OA 7 idence Avas given as to a complaint having been sent in by the shire
council ? —There has been one complaint, and that very recently; and I Avas rather surprised to hear Mr.
Dalgleish state that sludge had been going on the road for the last three months. What sludge went on the
road Avas before the dams Avere constructed, Avhen they Avere just trying the Avashdirt. At that time they
Avere not stacking, and that lodged on the road, and a flood came and took it doAvn the creek; but the
last three months, in fact, Ave have been returning our Avater.
5077. Have you had experience in any other alluvial mine in Avhich sludge has been stacked ?—Yes.
5078. What company ?—The De Murska, Kingston.
5079. There it Avas in consequence of the demand of the landowner? —Yes.
5080. What system ?— Tavo dams, one a very large one, and one beloAv it to filter the Avater, to pass
the Avater from one into the other.
5081. Were you re-using the Avhole of your water, or did you pass any aAvay ?—Passed it aAvay.
5082. What condition AA r as it in? —Discoloured, but carrying very little sludge.
5083. Was it good for stock ?—Yes.
5084. Was any complaint made by farmers or others using the Avater beloAv ?—Not by us; but several
other claims Avere discharging their slum-Avater into the same creek, and there Avere complaints lodged.
5085. Were there any complaints against the water you sent in ?—No.
5086. Was it a pipe-clay ?—Yes.
5087. Have you seen the sludge noAV being sent out from the Madam Berry ?—Yes.
5088. Since they made the arrangement through Davies’ land ?—Yes.
5089. Did you send your water out from Kingston in better condition than that ?—Yes, and Ave do
now. The cattle can drink the water that percolates below the dam.
5090. It Avas not thick as that is ?—No, it is simply a question of making dams for settling it.
5091. And you consider that the sludge Avhere you are now, in. the Midas, can be satisfactorily
settled ?—Y es.
Sludge. t


5092. So that the water running away from you is perfectly clear ?—Yes; and that is what we are
doing now, because we are returning water. The little water going away is percolating through the sand-
stone perfectly clear.
5093. What does the cost to the company amount to, to stack the sludge ? —About £3 per week at
present. It will be somewhat more by-and-by. We are erecting another puddling machine. We are
stacking 40 tons a day.
5094. Is one man a day throughout the year sufficient ?—No.
5095. Less than two and more than one ?—Just so.
5096. And you think that it is quite possible to stack your sludge, without over-taxing the claim, in
such a manner that the water is. delivered fairly clear, and the sludge prevented passing over the surface of
the land ?—Yes, we are very favourably situated for that. We can divert, the storm-water (that is generally
the great difficulty) from going in amongst the slum and breaking away the embankment. We can avoid
that.
5097. Is there much pipe-clay in that ?—Yes, a great deal. It is chiefly pipe-clav.
5098. Nearly as thick as they have it in the Allandale mines ?—Yes.
5099. Are there any suggestions you would like to make ?—With your permission I would to refer
to a remark by Mr. Dalgleish, that we have been a perfect nuisance to the council, Our object has been to
keep the claim going, and we have something like 150 men employed there, and through the scarcity of water,
that has been the great difliculty, and we have had to utilize the old shafts to bring the water across the
road. That is only temporary, and we are making provision now for a permanent supply ; and I mention
that to show that it is scarcely well for the council to go out of their way to throw any obstruction in the
way of mining, especially in developing that in the district. It is only a temporary arrangement putting
that pipe across the road, and it is not much of an inconvenience to the traffic. As to the silting up of the
creek below or where the creek is at the cross roads there; it is just in that position that the storm-water
will bring down all the silt. It is not the quantity of sludge but the quantity of sand that is brought from
the east and north. But at present there is not a particle of slum on the road.
5100. You are not delivering any more now ? —No, none at all.
The witness withdrew.
William Chisholm sworn and examined.
5101. By the Board. —What claim do you represent ?—The Prince Regent Quartz Mining Company,
Ballarat East.
5102. How many head of stamps have you there ?—Twenty.
5103. How long has the claim been at work ?—The battery has been at Avork about se\ r en years.
5104. Can you give the Board information as to what is the total quantity— lioav many tons
have been crushed? —No; there has been a good deal of stoppages with this battery, and not going regularly,
but she crushes about 300 tons Avlien she is going regularly.
5105. Do you stack your tailings?—Yes.
5106. Do you deliver any into that creek—Canadian Flat ?—ln the Avinter time.
5107. Why do you deliver into that creek in the winter time?—Because the storm-water carries
them aAvay.
5108. Where do you stack—in the bed of the creek ?—No, outside of the creek, then the overflow
of the dam goes through the sand and washes the water into the creek, and the flood carries it aAvay.
5109. Have you bottom sluices in your dams ?—We let it out through the sluice at the bottom.
5110. Why is it you do not stack your tailings more completely so that you do not have to run any
off ? —We could not possibly do that, it Avould take too much space, Ave have not land enough.
5111. What is the area of your lease ? —We have only about four acres on the low side of the
battery.
5112. Between you and the creek is that ?—Yes.
5113. Is that Crown land adjoining?—Yes.
5114. What is there to prevent your having more than four acres, if it is Crown land ?—We have
the creek on that side.
5115. Is there anything to prevent your having more land north and south ?—lt is higher than we
are on the opposite side, so Ave could not run it. There is property above on the same side.
5110. And beloAv you ?—Yes.
5117. So you are shut in by other claims ?—Yes.
5118. You say the land is higher on the other side —do you use a tailings-pump ?—No.
5119. If you did, Avould there be any difficulty in stacking your tailings ? —lt Avould be very expen-
sive; it is so far to run the tailings, and you Avould need to raise them so high.
5120. lloav far would you have to carry your tailings in that case ?—-Four hundred or 500 yards in
fluming.
5121. Right across the flat ?—Yes.
5122. Why have you to do that ?—Because our dam goes to the edge of it there, and Ave could not
Avork the pump so far from the engine Avithout long gearing; it is 200 yards and more to the creek, on our
side.
5123. And you Avould have to go another 200 yards of the other side ?—Yes.
5124. What height Avould you have to raise the the tailings ?—Thirty or 40 feet.
5125. On account of the steep nature of the land ? —Yes; and then it Avould hold very little on the
side of the hill. I make my embankments as high as I can, and I have never let any go since I have been
there.
5126. Within the last seven months you have not let any go ?—No.
5127. Are your banks pretty high now ?—Yes.
5128. When shall you find it necessary to let any go ?—I can keep on raising for a considerable
time, but ultimatety it will have to go.
5129. Is that creek, the Canadian Flat, much subject to floods ?—No; a lot of water comes doAvn in
the Avinter time, but it never overfloAvs.


5130. What height in the largest flood will come down ?—I cannot say.
5131. Is the flat such that it would be impossible to dam the tailings in the flat after they have left
your ground ?—I do not think it would; there is another battery below us, and one below that, all
delivering into the creek. All the sand that has come from those batteries has never done any harm, it goes
nto the Yarrowec.
5132. Where does it go to ?—I suppose it goes to the sea.
5133. There is another claim above you, what is the name of that ?—The Whoali Hapw.
5134. Mr. Melrose is the manager ?—Yes.
5135. Can you give us any information as to how many head ?—Fifteen.
5136. Are they in the same position that you are in the Prince Regent in regard to stacking the
tailings ?—Pretty much; they can stack more than I can, as their battery is situated on higher ground.
5137. And do the same as you—let off during the Avinter months?—Yes, and let it all go in the
Avinter months.
5138. They do not use a tailings-pump ?—No.
5139. Has any complaint been made to you about your working ?—No.
The witness withdrew.
John Wall SAVorn and examined.
5140. By the Board. —What position do you hold ?—I am town clerk of Sebastopol.
5141. lloav long have you held that position ? —About twenty years. If the Board Avill allow me to
state a feAA r facts, I am prepared to do so.
5142. Will you please do so ?—I Avas the first mining surveyor appointed by the Governor in
Council in this country. I Avas appointed in 1856, and therefore for a very long time I have been connected
Avith mining operations. For 31 years the sludge from the Ballarat mines has been going down the
YarroAvee Creek. I have made an approximate estimate of the quantity of sludge Avhich has found its Avay
into that creek during the past 31 years, and I find it totals 80,000,000 cubic yards. I also estimate the
yearly supply at present at 50,000 cubic yards. Such has been the enormous quantity of sludge finding its
Avay into that creek, especially in the early days of Ballarat mines, say tAventy to thirty years ago; and, in
one case, the principal bed of the YarroAvee Creek has been shifted eight chains to the west. I produce a
plan made by me in 1856, shoAving the principal branch of the Yai'roAvee Creek in those days, and also
showing the very small branch along Avhich Avater only ran during the highest floods. In consequence of
the large quantity of sludge from the White Horse Ranges, the eastern branch lias been filled, and the
permanent creek iioav is eight chains AvestAvard of the former bed. The original bed of the creek is covered
Avitli from tAventy to tAventv-five feet of sludge —[ handing in a plan\. Several holders of private property
in the neighbourhood of Sebastopol, Avhose land abuts on the YarroAvee, lnwe suffered very considerably in
consequence of the doAvn-fioAv of sludge. I lay before you a plan of the borough of Sebastopol, shoAving
the creek frontages. One landholder, Mr. Ellis, holds about 30 acres abutting on the creek here, between
Bala and Yickers-street. An embankment Avas constructed round the eastern portion of that land by the
former proprietor at a cost of £l2O, for the purpose of keeping the sludge from the Ballarat mines from
spreading over the loav portions of his estate. The present proprietor yearly has to repair or add to that
embankment to keep the sludge from overflowing. That laud is exceedingly valuable; it is worth ait least
£4O per acre. Mr. Dickenson, who holds land at the south-east part of the municipality, betAveen Dockwras
and Albert streets, has for twenty years been engaged in the construction of an embankment along the
eastern portion of his land for the purpose of keeping the creek sludge from overfloAving him. The total
cost of that work to Mr. Dickenson is £350, and if he had not so constructed that embankment,
tAvelve acres of his best land would have been destroyed, that is the low-lying lands near the creek are the
best in the district. I estimate the value of that land at £4O an acre, and he has twelve acres that avoulcl
be irreparably injured; his loss Avould have been very great had he not incurred that cost to make the
embankment. It is made of stone, earth-works, and slabs. Mr. Elford’s land adjoins on the south. Mr.
Elford has fourteen acres of land irreparably damaged. It is noAV utterly useless; there is a depth of
sludge from one to five feet on it: it carries nothing but furze and rushes. I estimate the value of that land
at £4O an acre. Mr. Elford’s loss has been £560; it Avas magnificent land in its native condition, and it is
noAV utterly Avortliless. The eastern portion of the BonshaAv estate, south of the Buninyong road, and east
of the Cambrian Hill road, that belongs to Mr. Jenkyn Thomas. Twenty acres of that land is now covered
with sludge. It Avas exceedingly A r aluable 30 years ago; in fact, I farmed a portion of that 26 years ago
under Mr. Winter, avlio Avas then the owner. I estimate the value of that land is £4O an acre. Mr. J.
Thomas’s loss is not less than £BOO. I have not made inquiries touching any other cases than the four
named; but, as 1 am Avell acquainted Avitli the history of the sludge question in connexion with the lands I
have referred to, I feel quite sure that the Board may place some reliance on the statement I have made
touching the original value of those lands and of their present injured condition. I may further add that, in
consequence of the large quantity of sand from the batteries and sludge from the mines finding an outlet
through the YarroAvee, this nuisance is likely rather to increase than abate; and eighty million cubic yards,
or, at all events, about a quarter of the quantity lies in the country adjoining the bed of the creek, and forms
a series of shifting sand banks for every flood to carry nearer and nearer the sea.
5143. Have you any knoAvledge of how far the sludge .has as yet been carried down the Leigh
River ?—I have not.
5144. No doubt it has ? —For a considerable distance, no doubt of it.
5145. Can you say also Avhetlieryou have grounds for believing that the sludge is- still passing doAvn,
assuming that the annual increment is 50,000 cubic yards—is that, or a large portion of that steadily going
down there ?—A small portion of it is going doAvn and getting nearer the sea ; a considerable portion of it,
hoAvever, is forming sandbanks on the bed, on the soils of the creek, and raising the loav lands.
5146. Will the result of this be to increase the injury caused by floods ?—I think so ;in some places
the sludge covers a Avidth of from 25 to 30 chains of loAv-lying country doAvn the Yarrowee.
5147. Has the water of the YarroAvee beloAV the mines deteriorated for purposes of stock? —l have
not been down the YarroAvee beloAV the mines for fifteen or sixteen years, but I should fancy that it will
be deteriorated for stock : it must of necessity be, I fancy, especially Avhen yoxx look at the very dirty


character of the water, the stinking water, that passes down the Yarrowee now. I cannot see anything in
the Yarrowee that would purify it for stock purposes, after it passes Sebastopol or Winter’s Flat, before it
reaches the sea.
5148. And above that there is not only the tailings, but pyrites being actually discharged direct into
the Yarrowee ?—Yes, if I were a landowner along the side of the Yarrowee, within the limits of the sludge
nuisance, I certainly would ask the Government to compensate me or buy me out. The only remedy for
this nuisance, which cannot be prevented, because the mining interest must be allowed to have full swing,
would be, in my opinion, for the Government to pass a Bill enabling them to buy out all the low-lying lands
along the Yarrowee from Ballarat to the sea ; that is the only fair and equitable method in my opinion.
5149. What would be the result of entirely cutting off the supply of water, for stock purposes, in
the lower countries ?—lf the water were cut oil' for stock purposes in the low countries, stock could not be
kept.
5150. It would only remove the injury to the farmers further down ? —Undoubtedly, I speak of the
damage to private property. If the Government constructed some purifying apparatus to make good the
water, if it is within the reach of science to do so, it would be gnod to water stock, but under the present
circumstances the stock must bo removed to some other part of the country, or the mining operations in
Ballarat and district would have to be stopped.
5151. Has your council constructed any works in the form of storm-water channels?—Yes, a sludge
channel.
5152. In the Yarrowee ?—lt was for the purpose of carrying the sludge from the Band of Hope
No. 3, the Albion Company, and the St. George, into the Yarrowee.
5153. Diverting it into the Yarrowee ? —For the purpose of diverting it into the Yarrowee, to get
rid of it from the mines.
5154. Part of it crossed the roads and streams ?—Yes, and the sludge channel was constructed, and
put under my superintendence, and answered admirably, and the consequence was that an immense quantity
of sludge was carried down daily into the Yarrowee.
5155. Was it, in your opinion, impossible for the companies to have retained that sludge on their
own premises ?—lt would be very expensive.
515(5. It is done elsewhere; why should it be more expensive here ?—lt was never suggested in
those days when the alluvial mines were working; the directors, managers, and the shire council did all they
could to get that sludge out of the municipality. We wanted it away. It would spoil the beauty of the
municipality; we did not care where it went to.
The witness withdrew.
James Cotter sworn and examined.
5157. By the Board. —You are connected with the mining interest at Ballarat ?—Yes.
5158. In what way?—As a shareholder, at present; but formerly as manager of two of the largest
alluvial mines we have had in the district of Ballarat.
5159. Which are those ? —The late Hand and Band and the Koh-i-noor companies.
5160. Are those companies at work ?—Not at present; but, whilst manager of those companies, I
have lnid a great deal of experience, having had to stack the sludge at each of them, so as not to flow
far away.
5161. Were you successful in doing so ?—Yes.
5162. Can you give me an idea of the number of machines put through by the Koh-i-noor ? —During
a portion of the time we were working we put through 21 machines in 24 hours.
5163. And yet you stacked the sludge ?—And yet we stacked the greater portion within those town
blocks; the streets were at each side.
5164. How many acres of land had you available on which to stack the sludge ?—The whole of the
place at the time was merely Crown lands; but, at the same time, we were bound to keep the sludge from
the parties who had houses on their miner’s rights, and I think the acreage would be perhaps about 40 or
50 acres.
5165. Did you stack in one or more than one dam ?—Several.
5166. Passing the water from one to the other? —Yes.
5167. Was there much pipeclay in the wash ?—A good deal.
5168. Did you conserve the water for your own use, or pass it off ?—Wo used to return a good deal
and use it.
5169. And pass some off?—Yes.
5170. What condition was that in ?—Pretty thick, from the puddling machine.
5171. But that from settling-dams ?—There would be very little sand.
5172. Was it fit for stock after it left the settling-dams ? —I have experienced the stock drinkiug the
water after leaving our dams, whilst I was working in the Hand and Band; not in the Koh-i-noor, because
there was no stock about there.
5173. You did discharge some water from the Koh-i-noor? —Yes.
5174. But it was in fair condition ?—Yes.
5175. Turning to the Hand and Band, what was the size of the workings there ?—Very large.
5176. As large as the Koh-i-noor ? —Larger, but not the same quantity of work.
5177. What was the amount of land available for stacking ?—We were allowed by the City Council
about 30 acres.
5175. Did you stack there ?—Yes, we were bound to stack within that limit.
5179. Did you re-use your water ? —We had not to re-use any there, because we had a large quantity
of water always.
5180. You send the water away out of your settling dams. You have known stock drink it ?—Yes.
5181. Would you think it so thick as to be injurious to stock, although they drink it; or was it
merely discoloured ? —lt was discoloured. I have read some evidence from veterinary surgeons showing
that sand is injurious to stock when they eat the grass very low. That is the only thing that would induce
me to say it may be injurious to stock —the sand in the bowels. I would like to give information to the


Board of what I did myself with the water. I tried an experiment, after passing through our dams. I
ploughed some trenches as though I was going to irrigate, and I found the result so good that I would like
to have a farm, in the course of where I could get such water. I think it would be a great advantage to
me to irrigate with the water after it passed through my settling-dam.
5182. Containing a portion of sludge ?—Not much.
5183. After that the water filtered through the ground and would he clear ?—I think it would purify
the water to some extent. The water would be as clear as coming from any other source nearly.
5184. What was the acreage of your dams in those mines ?—ln the Hand and Band I suppose we
would have an area of five or six acres in each of the dams.
5185. What was the cost, in labour, of the men required to maintain those dams ?—ln the Hand
and Band, and in the Koh-i-noor we could keep it within reasonable limits, with one man constantly
employed by looking after the embankments and keeping it within our allowed limits. I might state, for
the information of the Board, that after it left the claim, before it got into the Yarrowee, it was a distance
of three-quarters of a mile, and on each side of the channel running along. To show that much sand did
not get away, I do not believe you could get a load of sand in any one place, showing that much sand did
not come away with the water, that we nearly succeeded in catching all the sand.
518 G. Is there any suggestion you Avould like to make further ? —No, with the exception that I agree
entirely with Mr. Bryant’s evidence, that with care, all the mines I am aware of, the sludge can be stacked.
I do not mean to say without doing injury to streams that are quite clear, but with ordinary care that the
sludge can be conserved, so that it will not be such a nuisance or injury to the farming interest as it is at
the present time.
5187. And without pressing too heavily on the mining companies ?—Just so.
The witness withdrew.
James Baird sworn and examined.
5188. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—Farmer. I am also a councillor of the Shire of
Ballarat.
5189. Where is your land situated ?—lt is situated within two miles and a half of Lake Learmonth.
5190. Do you suffer from the accumulation of sludge? — Not at all.
5191. Will you make any suggestions or statement you wish to ?—I happened to be a councillor of
the Shire of Ballarat, and the creek I wish to speak of runs through the shire a very long distance. It is
the Burrumbeet Creek, and it has been a great trouble to the shire council, and also to the people there. It
used to be one of the finest and clearest streams in Victoria.
5192. How long ago?—Four or five years ago; and there were some fine waterholes all the way
down from the Dead-horse Ranges to the Burrumbeet Creek. Now all those holes are filled up, and it is
beginning to throw the sludge on every side. Some paddocks are getting half covered with it. Now this is
caused through some Chinamen, avlio are not, making much money by it either, as they knocked off some
time ago and then commenced sluicing again. If they were to stack the stuff it would not do so much harm,
but they allow everything to go. The source of this happens to be in the Buugaree shire—not in Ballarat;
and Ave applied to the Buugaree people to stop it, and they made a sort of promise that they would, and it
was stopped. I believe also that they said they Avould not renoAV any licence; but it seems that they have
done it, because it has been going on as bad as ever all the Avay doAvn through those flats, which are very
valuable land, and there are farmers on every side, and going through the township of Miner’s Rest, Avhere
they have no other Avay of getting Avater for cattle and domestic purposes. For a year or tAvo after they
started first the Avater kept perfectly clear, except at flood time, Avlien all this stuff that had been stored up
came doAvn as bad as ever. When the flood Avas over it settled, and people could use it, but xioav it is
continually going as bad as before; and if that could be stopped it Avould be one of the greatest things for
the district.
5193. Where do the Chinamen get their Avater from ?— I do not knoAv; but I know it is in the
ranges toAvards Dead-horse, in the Bungaree shire. And there was something Avorse than that—it Avorking
doAvn, I Avill not say, as one Avitness put it, to the sea—but into Burrumbeet Lake, and it Avill fill that
valuable lake of beautiful fresh Avater some day —probably not in my day; but there is not the slightest
doubt it is bound to fill that lake to a tremendous extent.
5194. Has any portion reached the lake yet?—Yes, not a large body of it, but the discoloured Avater
has got down. It is a beautiful stream doAvn there — a beautiful creek going into the lake, Avitli fish in
abundance.
5195. Your suggestion is that the sluicing is of so little value, in point of labour, that, for the
general good to the community at large, it should be stopped altogether ? —That is it. We tried to do
something, but Ave found that the shire council had no poAver, and that some of the private proprietors of
land Avould have to take action. None of them Avere inclined to do it, in case they got into a laAv-suit; and
to get into a laAv-suit Avith Chinamen, Avitli probably no back-bone—they Avere afraid of it. The Chinamen
knocked off for a time.
5196. Do you knoAv lioav many parties Avere at Avork ?—No. There is one paddock in particular in
the flat, doAvn beloAv Avhere it goes through Miner’s Rest, belonging to Mr. Parker, Avhicli is completely
covered, and it is carrying the Avater on to our roads. In a very short time it Avill come round and SAveep
our roads, instead of going through the paddock.
5197. Then you Avill take action as a council? —I do not knoAv, but something ought to be done.
5198. As a member of the council, are you aAvare Avhetlier the rateable property in the shire has been
depreciated in consequence of this in any Avay ?— I cannot say Avhether it has. I have no doubt it is a great
evil, but whether they liaA r o been rated any loAver or not, I would not like to say. There is another thing
I wish to speak of. The Midas claim is also in the Ballarat shire, and Ave have had some trouble with
them. Noav Mr. Cotter has given very good evidence here that it can be stacked and not do much injury.
I knoAv they have been Avarned, because avc sent our secretary Avitli one of our councillors, present uoav, to
warn them take care of their stuff, and not let it come on to the roads, and they took no notice.
5199. Did you hear the evidence of Mr. Bryant ?—No.
5200. He said the company intended to stack ?—I am glad to hear it. The damage is not very great
as yet, but it Avould be, no doubt.
The witness withdrew.


George Hale sworn and examined.
5201. By the Board. —You are connected to the Buninyong Weir ?—1 am secretary.
5202. llow long have you held that position ?—Between fifteen and sixteen years.
5203. Will you describe to the Board any ill effects to the roads or properties within the shire due
to the sludge nuisance ? —Down at Winter’s Flat, referred to by Mr. Wall, it is very flat, low-lying lands,
and at each flood it brings down large quantities of sludge, and overflows the banks of the creek, and has
now cut another course altogether, and the flood at the commencement of this year or the end of last year
took away the embankment, and partly destroyed Winter’s Flat Bridge.
5204. Where is the bridge as regards Scotchman’s village ?—On the road to Sehastapool, being
immediately on the southern boundary of Sehastapool. It was generally called the Star and Garter Bridge,
and has been up now between 28 and 30 years.
5205. The Yarrowce is so filled up there that there is not the waterway there used to bo ?—No;
and Avlien a flood occurs it takes aAvay the approaches on either side of the bridge; in fact, it made it so
dangerous Ave had to stop the traffic Avhile the works Avere going on.
5206. Was that bridge constructed before your time ?—No; 26 or 27 years ago. I am under the
impression it was originally constructed by the Government.
5207. What Avas the height of Avatenvay under that bridge?—Fourteen or fifteen feet, I should
say.
5208. What is it uoav? — Tavo feet six inches in the deepest part. It is a tremendous flat.
5209. Has that filling up taken place uniformly, or has it been greater of later years ?—Yes, since
the quartz companies of the Redan. I bolieve that has filled up the creek much-more than in the old
alluvial days.
5210. You think the evil is increasing ?—To a great extent.
5211. Hoav far has the sludge gone done the Leigh ?—Fourteen or fifteen miles. I have been doAvn,
and there are some banks Avhcrc the ci'eek runs beyond Avith a flood. When the floods come they throAv up
the sludge on either side.
5212. Where do you take the fourteen or fifteen imlcs ?—lt is more than that from Ballarat. I was
taking it from the boundary of the shire. That would be twenty miles from Ballarat to my knoAvledge, but
I have not folloAved the creek further doAvn.
5213. To your knoAvlcdged tAventy miles below Ballarat the sludge is there ?—Yes, and you Avill see
it in large beds Avhere the creek has taken a turn and overfloAved the fiats.
5214. We Avent to Scotchman’s Village, and there Avas any amount there ?—lf you go right doAvn to
Mount Mercer you find it on each side of you all the same.
5215. Were you in the Buninyong shire when the New Buninyong mine Avas working ?—Yes. I
Avas not then engaged. I Avas then managing one of the large mines.
5216. Did you knoAv the Ncav Buninyong mine ? —Yes.
5217. There they stack the sludge? —Yes.
5218. And that Avas pipe-clay ?—Yes.
5219. And they stacked A r ery satisfactorily, did they not ?—Yes.
5220. We had the CA’idenco of Mr. Smyth, Avho was the manager, who said he had been very suc-
cessful in stacking the sludge, and said it had been done Avithout causing any injury to the adjoining land,
and no complaints as to water running off. We went down and Avent over those old Avorkings the other
day, and the appearance bears out Avhat he said ?—I believe lie Avas under a bond not to alloAv the sludge to
run over the land, because there is very rich land all round Avhere the claim was.
5221. And they Avere successful ?—Yes.
5222. And yet there is a good deal of pipe-clay in that wash, too ?—I do not think the old alluvial
claims did anything like the damage of the present quartz crushing. There is a larger quantity, and it
seems to form itself into banks, and as soon as the first flood comes it Avashes all over the low-lying lands.
There is one thing to be considered, there are not the same facilities there Avere many years ago. Of course
the creek in many places Avas very loav to get doAvn to it. There Avere very high banks, and now they are
very nearly level with the surface, and it took a long time to fill this up.
5223. Would you like to make any suggestion, having been a mining manager and had large experi-
ence, as to abatement of the nuisance ?—I could not advance any Avithout there Avas a system of stacking the
debris on the claim. Ido not think there Avould be any injury to the Leigh noAV alloAA r ing the Avater to run
if there Avas only the water. It is the largo quantity of sludge.
5224. You have seen, in your oavii experience, that the sludge from the alhdal mines can be stacked ?
—Yes, no doubt of that. And the same Avay with the quartz, it can be stacked.
The witness toithdreiv.
Thomas Elford sworn and examined.
5225. By the Board. —You have property on the Leigh?—Yes, doAvn close to the bridge that has
been spoken of.
5220. Near the bridge in Winter’s Flat? —Yes.
5227. Will you describe to the Board Avhat injuries you yourself have suffered, or you know luive
been suffered by your neighbours?—Mr. Wall gave a true account of that, when he spoke about it, when he
mentioned my case. I purchased over 30 years ago.
5228. You endorse Avhat has been said by Mr. Wall ?—Yes, I think he Avas near the mark. But
the stuff from the batteries noAA', I think, ought to be stacked. That is Avhat has done all the mischief. If
that Avas stacked the AA r ater Avould soon cleanse the channel and go on right. But where there is so much of
this loose work, instead of spending money to stack the sludge, they shove it into the creek, and it spoils
everything.
5229. Is the water injurious to stock uoav ?—Where I am the stock need it; they can go and
drink elsewhere. Ido not think people Avould trouble much about it, if they could get rid of the sand. The
sand, these last feAv years, has been a terror to
paid a high price for it. I dare say there are three to five feet of sludge on it, and it is not Avortli anything,


and if it was in its proper state it would be worth £4O per acre to anyone. I gave £ls to £3O per acre
for it.
5230. llow many acres would that apply to ?—Fourteen to twenty. 1 have only a little over 40
acres. Those companies, I know, are running everything into the creek; they crush 300 tons per week,
and everything goes down, and the first flood it spreads over everywhere, the roads and bridges and every-
thing suffer.
5231. You think the mischief is increasing ?—Yes, it is worse the last two years than ever before.
5232. Can you say how much the bed of the creek is rising per year; is it six inches ?—I could not
say; but the land has to rise with it. I have been there 30 years. When there was a high flood, you would
see more room under the bridge than all the space now under the bridge at ordinary times. They have
spent money altering the bridge, but if there came a thunderstorm, it would not go under now; it would
go all over it. It is a great drawback to parties on the creek. It is the best of the land, and of course it
is all smothered.

WEDNESDAY, Btii DECEMBER, 1886.
Present :
R. 11. Shake spear, Esq., C.E., in the Chair;
A. F. Walker, Esq.
Frederick George Docker sworn and examined.
5233. By the Board. —What is your occupation?—Grazier.
5234. And where is your land situated ? —About five miles down the Ovens River, on the north side
from here.
5235. llow many acres do you hold ? —About 2,500 of the flooded ground, and about 1,500 of high
land.
5236. What length of your land fronts the river ?—Four miles fully.
5237. And by an average depth of how much ? —Of about one mile.
5238. Is that the flooded portion ?—Yes.
5239. About a mile is flooded back ?—Yes.
5240. To what depth is that land of yours flooded ?—Varying, in high floods, from six inches up to
eight or nine feet, exclusive of the water-courses.
5241. What was the last occasion on which it was flooded as deeply as that?—l think in 1867 or
1868.
5242. The 1870 flood ?—Yes.
5243. When was the last time in which it was flooded six inches ?—The six inches would be the
highest portion of the land.
5244. When was the last occasion on which the land was flooded ?—ln this spring, one half of the
2,500 acres would be under water.
5245. Is that the August rain ?—August and September.
524 G. What depth was the flooding then ?—lt would vary from nothing up to five or six feet.
5247. In the lowest depressions ?—Yes.
5248. How long have you been the holder of the land ?—lt was taken up by my father ; ho held it
since 1839.
5249. How long have you personally known it ? —The last 40 years.
5250. Used the land—prior to the mining operations affecting the river—in any way to be flooded in
those days ?—Yes.
5251. To the same extent? —Quite, or very nearly so. Some seasons there are some very high
floods, others, moderate floods.
5252. Do you consider that the mining operations have had the effect of causing the floods to be
more frequent or higher? —I do not think so ; scarcely appreciably so.
5253. Does the flood leave any deposit on your land?—Yes, a considerable deposit.
5254. Of what nature ? —A yellow slimy clay.
5255. Is it from the mining operations, or cutting away from natural causes?—Mining operations, 1
feel assured.
525 G. Principally ?—Principally.
5257. How long is it since the deposit first took place upon yourland ?—1 should think, to a great
extent, ever since the gold-field has been discovered; to a much greater extent since the sludge has been
brought down the Tarrawingee sludge channel.
5258. What is the depth since the sludge channel at Tarrawingee was constructed—the general
average depth of this deposit—that is left upon your land, say, after such rains as we have had this year ?
—I should think, throughout the season, there would be'a deposit of about three or four inches, perhaps;
not over the whole of the land; to a greater extent in some places than others.
5259. What effect has this deposit upon the grasses?—l do not think the deposits, through the early
floods, are very injurious; but, as happens occasionally, we have a flood in November, a very high flood,
and after the grass has obtained a good length, the grass then becomes so dirty that stock do not thrive on
jt well. If there is a good thunderstorm within a few days after the flood, the damage is very slight;


but one season, about three or four years since, a high flood occurred, covering nearly the whole of the flat;
there was no rain after that for two or three months; that grass was almost ruined.
5260. Are you unable, in consequence of this deposit, to carry as large a number of stock as you
otherwise would ?—I think I carry fully the same quantity of stock, but lam liable to the loss I have men-
tioned just now; that particular season I had the same number of stock on the place, but they did not fatten
at all. I almost lost, that season.
52(51. Can you give the Board any outline of your estimate as to the difference in value, owing to
your stock not fattening so well ?—I should think, that particular season, I must have lost £2OO.
5262. What season is that?—l cannot recollect the particular season; it is some four or five years
since.
5263. And since that, do you estimate you are able to obtain less return from your stock ?—No, I
think not.
5264. It is only exceptional years ?—lt is only exceptional years. Every year I have a slight loss
from the great deposit of sludge in the creek that runs down from Beechworth to my property. In that
creek there is a deposit in places of six or eight feet of sludge. Occasionally sheep and cattle get bogged
in this, towards the end of the summer. The loss is not great, but there is a certain amount.
52G5. What creek is that?—Reid’s Creek.
52GG. Running through Eldorado ?—Yes; the water comes into that also from the Tarrawingee
sludge channel. The channel runs into the Ovens River, and there is a branch running into this creek
before it comes into our property.
5267. Do you find the grass grows upon this sludge, where it exceeds a foot in depth ? —Yes, the
summer grass grows.
5268. Does it groAV luxuriantly ?—Yes; couch grass.
5269. Does the summer heat have any worse effect on the grasses growing in the sludge; does it tend
to perish it from the heat ?—I do not think so.
5270. Knowing the Ovens River so long, do you notice whether the river is silting-up —filling in
any way ?—I have not noticed the river itself silting-up very much. I have not taken particular notice of
the bed of the Ovens River, but in my own property there are a number of watei’-coxirses, this particular
creek and a number of others, that are silting-up to a very great extent..
5271. Do you notice whether Reid's Creek, where it passes through your property, is silting-up ?
To a very great extent.
5272. To what extent ?—I think, on an average, an extent of five or six feet.
5273. The general average, not waterholes ?—I think the general average would be five feet, taking
waterholes and the shallower portions as well.
5274. Has that had the effect of increasing floods along Reid’s Creek ?—I should think it must to
a certain extent. It is difficult to say, because some seasons we have much greater rainfalls than others.
We have not had a flood now equal to the 1870 flood, but still, as the beds of the lagoons and creeks silt
up, floods, with the same amount of rain, must be greater.
5275. Do you water your stock in Reid’s Creek ?—A great number of them.
5276. Do you find any injury to the stock from the water ?—No.
5277. Nor from the Ovens ?—No.
5278. The injury is entirely in the form of silting-up ?—Damage to the grass, the silting-up, and
occasionally stock bogging in Reid's Creek.
5279. They do not bog in the main river ?—No, I think not.
5280. Is the water in Reid's Creek fit for domestic consumption ? —I think so. I think it is good
enough. Some people object to its bad colour.
5281. You did not mention what you consider the rising of Reid’s Creek is .per year ?—I should
think about three or four inches per year. It will vary, of course, very much.
5282. Is there anything you wish to say in addition ? —Only that I think the construction of sludge
channels brings the evil from some people down on to others. We have suffered a good deal more damage
since the construction of the Tarrawingee sludge channel. I think the proper course would"be the construc-
tion of reservoirs, above me, in the hills, xvhere the water could settle, and retain the sludge up there. Of
course those reservoirs would silt-up very rapidly, but every few years it would be an inexpensive thing to
increase the embankments.
5283. Is that an opinion founded on actual knowledge of mining operations ?—I am giving my own
opinion.
The witness withdrew.
John Peppard sworn and examined.
5284. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—Farmer.
5285. Where is your land situated ? —ln Tarrawingee.
528 G. On the Ovens River?—No, on Hodgson’s Creek.
5287. What area of land do you hold ?—About GOO acres.
5288. In what way is your land affected by this question of debris from the mines ?—The portion
of it along the creek has suffered very considerably.
5289. What length of frontage have you to the creek ?—Between 30 and 40 chains.
5290. How many acres are affected by the sludge ? —The whole of this laud. I believe at one time
it would be close on 200 acres along this creek that has been affected.
5291. How far is your land from Tarrawingee itself—the township ?—From the Government town-
ship ? It is quite close to it. The Upper Tarrawingee, the Government allotment, is quite close to it, not a
quarter of a mile away from some of the land.
5292. Does your land abut on the portion where the sludge channel has been cut ?—Yes, the channel
runs through it.
5293. Are you in the North Ovens Shire portion or the Beechworth portion ?—The North Ovens.
5294. In what way are you now a sufferer by the sludge ?—When I bought this land in 1858 there
■was a nice creek, a clear creek of water in Hodgson’s Creek, and all along there the creek was from ten to


thirty feet deep Soon .afterwards, from the mining operations no doubt, the creek silted np till it got quite
level with the banks, there was no creek at all, it flowed over every place year by year, and kept getting worse.
5295. Has not the sludge channel been cut there ?—Part of it; it is not completed yet.
5296. It is completed in front of your property ?—Yes.
5297. Does not that carry sludge past your property ?—Yes, lately it does, if it could only got into
it; but if there was heavy rain the sludge could not get into the channel past my property.
5298. If there was heavy rain your laud would be flooded notwithstanding the channel ? —No, not if
the channel was completed. At present it is in an unfinished state; there is some half-a-mile or so left, in
the middle.
5299. Which side of the channel are you on ? —I have land on both sides of it.
5300. It is the back water from the unfinished portion between the two chanuels that would come
up on you ?—That is what I am'frightened of. We have had no heavy rains lately.
5301. If the channel was completed ? —I think it would meet all requirements. I have suffered
. considerably in years gone by. I lost a crop on this land year after year. It made it quite useless.
5302. How many acres used to be flooded ?—Patches in it; the high ground would not bo flooded,
but about 100 acres have been subject to the flood in years gone by.
5303. To what purpose do you apply that land now, agriculture or grazing ?—Agriculture now.
5304. Does it bear average good crops?—Yes, it is very good land.
5305. The portion covered by the deposit ? —lt was not so good for some years; I could get no crop,
but by ploughing it very deep and getting underneath it did very well; but where the sludge is very deep
~on it, it is no good.
5306. When you can mix the natural soil with it, it turns out very well ?—Yes.
5307. What depth can you plough it in ?—Six to eight inches.
5308. What is the nature of the natural soil ? —A kind of chocolate.
5309. Strong rich soil ?—Yes.
5310. Your experience would tend to show that, with the sludge coming down from tho workings at
Beechworth, as long as the deposit is not too deep, it is a question of time ?—lf there was no provision to
carry the water off, I think it would actually ruin all the land —thousands of acres about there. I have
seen it at times three miles wide, only a sheet of yellow water, slime, and mullock, from the mines. There
was no way to carry it aAvay.
5311. That is stopped now, with the exception of the gap ?—lt is quite as bad, until the channel is
completed, the money laid out as yet has been only thrown away, I consider.
The witticss withdrew.
Hopton Nolan -sworn and examined.
5312. By the Board. —Where is your residence? —Tarrawingeo.
5313. What is your position?—Farmer, grazier, hotelkeeper, and storekeeper, and president of the
North Ovens Shire.
5314. Are you also a landowner ?—Yes.
5315. How many acres do you hold that is affected by the sludge question ?—Between 400 and 500
acres.
5316. Was that at one time subject to injury by the sludge?—Yes, the great bulk of it. It has
touched it in some shape or form.
5317. Is it still subject to injury ?—No, not immediately now.
5318. Has the effect of that channel been to relieve your land ?—lt has.
5319. What depth of deposit have you had upon your laud upon the average ?—lt is a very difficult
thing to get at. The old original creek, Hodgson’s Creek, went through my land. It has made a deposit
there from one inch to twenty feet in the old original Hodgson’s Creek.
5320. Has your land now regained its quality and character since the deposit of sludge has been
stopped ?—No, I should say not.
5321. You heard the evidence of the last witness that, in time, and by turning up the natural soil,
. the laud regains its original condition ?—I am of the opposite opinion; I have tested that matter. There are
two classes of sludge that emanate from Hodgson’s Creek. In Beechworth, it is called the Three Mile;
that is where it heads itself. I am thoroughly well acquainted with Beechworth. I was one of the first
men who got gold on the Three Mile, and I do not hesitate to say there are two classes of matter that come
from it, sand and slate. The slate portion I have proved to be most injurious. I have known it to destroy
gigantic trees from one foot to two feet and three feet through where it has sludged-up. I am inclined to
think very little vegetation will grow when it will destroy trees like that—not only one tree, but belts of it.
Judge Casey visited it with me, so did Mr. Patterson and Mr. Bent, and I explained and showed it to them.
Judge Casey was under this impression, that this sludge and filth that came from the diggings would enrich
and make the land good. That was Mr. Casey’s opinion; I proved to the contrary. I showed him the belt
of timber destroyed by the sludge.
5322. Prior to the sludge channel being cut, you banked out your garden and orchard ?—I did the
bulk of my property. If I had not it would have been very little use to me.
5323. There had been a deposit of sludge over it prior to that ?—There was.
5324. Are not the trees bearing well there ?—The portion of the land which I banked away—put a
two or three feet bank against—there would be nothing upon, only half-an-inch of sludge or so. I kept the
sludge from going on that; that ground I have trenched two feet. It would make very little difference
there, but any part of the land where there is any depth of sludge it is injurious. I can illustrate it this way,
by the fact that the foliage which drops from the trees and any other matter will grow grass, but if that is
removed, if you touch it with your heel, or cattle travelling over it remove this stuff, nothing will grow on
the sludge for some time to come.
5325. Your opinion is valuable as showing the effect of sludge upon land, but you are speaking
of the past. Have you any reason to anticipate any further injury from the sludge ?—lf the sludge got on
to my land it would injure it.
5326. Can it get on to it now ?—Yes; if the sludge channel is not completed it will.
Sludge. U


5827. That is a matter entirely between the two councils and the Government ?—The councils have
nothing to do with it; the Government have.
5328. Are the properties round Tarrawingee injured or likely to bo injured by the sludge ?—Not if
the channel is completed. lam satisfied the channel will have the desired effect.
5329. You remember on the visit of the Board on the 23rd of September to Tarrawingee, you
informed the Board you considered there was no use taking evidence in Tarrawingee, because no further
injury was likely to be done, because the injury was stopped ?—I do not know if I said those exact words.
I showed the Board many places where the sludge accumulated to a certain extent. So far as we were
concerned, if the channel was constructed we were safe. You had the president of the Beechworth Shire
there. There was a portion of the shire that was going to be annexed to the Beechworth Shire. He
could have explained all about it. There is not the slighest doubt it is a destructive thing.
5330. How long ago is it since the sludge channel in the North Ovens Shire was constructed ?—The
first construction of the channel commenced in 1878, to the best of my knowledge.
5331. I mean completed down to the Ovens through the North Ovens Shire ? —lt is not completed
yet.
5332. With the exception of the gap between yourself and Beechworth, it is completed ?—Yes; that
is where the severance is asked for.
5333. From the point in the North Ovens Shire nearest the Beechworth Shire, down to the Ovens
River — lioav long is it since that was completed ?—About three years, to the best of my knowledge.
5331. There has been but very little rain since that ? —lt has been dry seasons up to last week.
5335. Has much sludge gone down that channel to the Ovens ?—Yes, there is a very great quantity.
5336. Has any complaint ever been made to the shire council of injury to the Ovens through sludge
brought down the sludge channel into that river? —Yes, I think there has. I think the Oxley people
lodged a complaint. They wish us to do something with reference to it.
5337. Hid they suggest any line of action to the council?—Yes, with reference to the creek that is
nearly opposite to the mouth, where the channel discharges itself into the river, wishing us to go to some
expense in stopping the sludge going into this creek which goes into Oxley. We were friendly enough
to agree to do it for them.
5338. Did you take any action as a council ?—lt is in abeyance now. We are ready at any time to
do it, and tenders are issued for the work.
5339. Are you aware whether the waterholos in the Ovens, below the junction of the sludge
channel, havo been filled since the construction of the sludge channel ?—They must have been.
5310. Do you know as a fact?—l know many localities on that river. It has been filled in—there is a
deposit of sludge.
5341. Since the construction of the channel ?—Yes.
The witness withdrew.
William Curtis sworn and examined.
5342. By the Board. —You are a farmer ?—Yes.
5343. Where is your land situated ?—On the Ovens.
5344. Which side ?—This side—the southern side.
5345. Whereabouts is it ?—About four miles below Waugaratta, on the Ovens.
5346. What frontage have you to the Ovens River ?—I could not say—about a mile.
5347. What do you use the land for ?—Agriculture and grazing.
5348. Is any portion of that land injured by the state of the river ?—I cannot say that any portion
is injured by the river now; I could not say what it will be in years to come. There is a sediment injthe
river, and that river is thick three, four, or five days in the week.
5349. Do your cattle water in the river ? —Yes.
'5350. Is it too thick for them ?—No.
5351. You are afraid the deposit is increasing ? —No doubt of it.
5352. Can you tell of your own knowledge whether the bed of the river is siltiug-up ?—I think
undoubtedly it is. Igo by logs that lie in the river.
5353. You cannot give any idea to what extent ? —No.
5354. You have not suffered any damage at present ?—No.
The witness withdrew.
Charles Conners SAvorn and examined.
5355. By the Board. —You are a farmer ?—A grazier.
5356. Your land is situated next to Mr. Williams ?—Yes, I am the second farm next to the mouth
of the sludge channel, on the opposite side.
5357. How far is your farm below the mouth of the sludge channel ?—Nearly half-a-mile by the
line of the river.
5358. What frontage have you to the Ovens ?—About half-a-mile or three-quarters of a mile.
5359. In Avliat way does your land suffer from debris brought down from the mines ?—My land has
not suffered much yet; it is the river silting-up.
• 5360. When did you first notice the river silting-up ?—The last tAvo years very much. Three years
ago I used to fish in a hole, and the other day I Avent. half Avay across it on the sludge.
5361. Do you attribute that to the TarraAvingee sludge channel ?—I do. All the deep holes in the
bends of the river are filling-up in my frontage and beloAV me.
5362. Did you notice Avhether that filling-up took place more rapidly just after the completion of the
channel, or is it increasing iioav? —Yery much since the completion of the channel.
53G3. Did the principal washing down of the sludge and the filling-up of the holes take place
immediately after the completion of the channel, or is it increasing uoav ? —lncreasing ever since.
53G4. At a more increasing rate ?—Yery much so. In all the deep holes where we used to fish our
sinkers would be ten feet; it is now not more than tAvo at loav Avater. The river is very high noAV.


53G5. Has the general bed of the river between the waterholes, assuming the waterholes to be filled
up, silted up ?—The bed has silted up—all the deep holes.
53GG. Put aside the deep holes, assume they are filled, is the bed of the river filling-up then ?—Yes,
it is filliug-up slowly but surely.
5367. Your fear is of the future ?—Yes, entirely.
53G8. Is there anything else you wish to say ?—Nothing further than that I would be in favour of
what Mr. Docker says about stopping the sludge.
The roitness withdrew.
Henry Woollard sworn and examined.
53G9. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—Farmer at Tarrawingee.
5370. Whereabouts is your land situated ? —Close to the railway station.
5371. What creek do you front?—Hodgson’s Creek.
5372. Is your land abutting on the portion where the sludge channel is constructed ?—Yes.
5373. In the North Ovens portion ? —Yes.
5374. Does your land iioav suffer, or is it likely to suffer, from the sludge ?—lt suffers from the back
water over the portion not finished. It is cut about three parts of the way through ‘my land ; there it
stops.
5375. If that channel were finished, have you any fear you would suffer any further damage ? —No, I
ilo not think so. lam bound to suffer until the channel is finished.
The witness withdrew.
Dan. Diffey sworn and examined.
5376. By the Board. —Are you a landowner ? —Yes.
5377. Do you farm your land ?—Yes.
5378. Whereabouts is it situated ?—Tarrawingee and East Wangaratta.
5379. Is it situated on the Ovens ? —Yes, our land is on the river at Tarrawingee.
5380. Is it on the Tarrawingee side—the northern side of the river ? —Yes.
5381. What length of frontage have you to the river? —About two miles.
5382. Does your land suffer from the deposit of sludge? —No, we are above the channel on the river.
5383. You are south of the sludge channel ?—We are east of it.
5384. In what way do you suffer ? —At Tarrawingee we are not hurt with it, but the Wangaratta
farm is being considerably damaged.
5385. Putting aside the Tarrawingee and taking the East Wangaratta property—whore is that
situated ?—About three miles out on tbe Wangaratta road.
538 G. Which side of the Ovens river is that?—On the northern side.
5387. What frontage have you there to the river ?—lt is not the river farm, it is off the river.
5388. Do you consider your land is injured in any way by the sludge ?—Not a great quantity of the
land, but we had a clear creek through the farm when I first was connected with it, and plenty of water for
stock. Since the overflow of Hodgson’s Creek into Crabliole Creek, it has sludged up the Avatercourse, and
the Avaterholes, and a great quantity of the land on the banks.
5389. Where does this overfloAv take place from Hodgson’s Creek?—ln Tamvwingee.
5390. Is it from the unfinished portion of the sludge channel ?—Yes.
5391. That Avould be prevented altogether by the completion of the channel?—Yes; I consider if the
channel Avas carried out it Avould clear us from any further damage there.
The witness withdrew.
AndrcAV J. Wighton SAVorn and examined.
5392. By the Board. —What are you ?—Road inspector for the North Ovens Shire Council.
5393. lloav long have you held that position ?—Fully ten years.
5394. What do you wish to bring before the Board of your own knowledge on the question of sludge?
—I might state that it is only a question of time Avlien the sludge channel that has been constructed by the
North OA 7 ens Shii’e Council Avill bo filled up, if the sludge continues.
5395. You consider it A\ r ill not be capable of performing its duty for any length of time? —No.
5396. From what cause do you imagine that Avill be the case. Is the fall too small, or Avill the
river bank it up at the outlet ?—From both causes; it has been in operation now for about three or four
years, and the loAver portion, Avitli 20 feet to the mile fall, has sludged up about 3 feet betAveen Nolan’s
and the river.
5397. Has that eA r er been cleared out by the council ?—No.
5398. Have floods had the effect of clearing it out ?—We had a large one on Saturday last.
5399. Did that clear out any portion ?—lt has left it pretty clear, still it seems to be about the same
height. It is only a question of time Avlien the channel is filled up if the same operation is carried on of
sending it doAvn.
5400. It is a question of time, or of the council keeping the channel clear ?—Yes.
5401. When this gap is filled up, of course a greater body of AA r ater will flnsli doAvn the channel?—
It had as much as it could hold last Saturday; it broke nAvay in three places.
5402. A large quantity must have been passing through the gap?—Yes, through the Crabliole
Creek.
5403. Then e\ r en the sludge channel Avill not completely obviate the difficulty ?—No.
5404. Are you aAvare of the state of the Ovens River prior to the construction of the sludge channel,
and its condition now?—Yes.
5405. II as the effect of the sludge channel been to fill the Ovens River? —It has filled tbe holes
chiefly, and left a lot of silt along the banks, but Avith regard to the general bed it has not risen at all,


5406. That deposit is being swept away down the river ?—Yes; it silts a little in the summer, and
in the winter the silt lifts and is carried further down.
5407. Have you made any observation how far the silt has been carried down ?—Oh, you can find
it thrown up on the banks near the North Boorhaman, near the Murray.
5408. I suppose iu small quantities down there ?—With each winter the flood spreads over the
land, and a certain settlement takes place. It does not seem to injure the grass, it is too small a deposit j
hut further up, where the deposit is thicker, it does injure tho grass.
5409. Can you say how far down the river the holes have filled up at present. From what you say
it appears the holes have been filled nearly to the Murray? —No; I say I did not notice that the general
bed of the river has risen; even the action of the water in the winter time has the same effect upon holes
as upon the other portions. Sometimes it scours the holes out, and sometimes there is a heavier deposit of
sand that the water does not take out, and it remains there.
5410. Are you aware whether, above the Tarrawingee sludge channel, the holes are filled?—ln the
river ?
5411. Yes?—l am not aware of it, not from that cause.
5412. There is mining above there ?—Yes, on the Buckland and the Ovens.
5413. The sludge has not reached so low ?—Yes, you can trace the silt, but it is very slight.
5414. You really attribute the injury in the Ovens River below to the Beechworth sludge coming
down the Tarrawingee channel?—Yes, and from Reid’s Creek. They are two different channels ; the one
enters at Tarrawingee, and the other below Mr. Docker’s place. '
5415. That comes down the Eldorado?—Yes, it comes from Beechworth.
5416. How far do your duties as road inspector extend down the Ovens ?—Down to the north-west
angle of North Boorhaman.
5417. Do you get as far as the junction of Reid’s Creek and the Ovens ?—Yes, below that.
5418. Do you find that Reid’s Creek is much filled ?—Very much.
5419. Can you give any idea to what extent Reid’s Creek has silted?—l should say, from my own
personal knowledge, in the immediate vicinity of North Wangaratta at least 8 or 10 feet.
5420. Has that had any injurious effect upon any roads or bridges, or other shire constructions ?
A bridge was constructed there thirty years ago; from the silting up of the creek a flood came and washed
it away, and there are a couple of bridges thrown across there now; they seem to do very well, but the silt
is gradually rising, and the openings of them are getting smaller.
5421. Is Reid’s Creek filling more rapidly now than it used to —are the present mining operations
affecting it, or is the silting-up due to the original mining ?—lt seems to silt up every year; at present it
depends upon the floods coming down the creek and moving the silt from the higher portions and leaving
it upon the more level parts.
5422. Is there much land damaged along Reid’s Creek ?—From this bridge I speak of, the creek is
confined between two high banks, although the land purchased all ran down to the creek at one time ; the
flat portion of the land, between those banks, has been damaged by the silt.
5423. Seriously damaged ?—Yes.
5424. Is there anything else you wish to say ?—No.
The witness withdrew.
Michael Keogh stvorn and examined.
5425. By the Board. —You are a farmer ?—Yes.
5426. Whereabouts is your property ?—Just where the last portion of the sludge channel was cut.
5427. The Tarrawingee channel ?—Yes.
5428. On which side of the Ovens ? —The Tarrawingee side.
5429. Are you above the channel or below it ?—I am below it, just where the channel was finished.
5430. Nearer here than the channel ? —Yes; but I am close to the piece of the channel that is not
finished. lam at the upper end of the North Ovens Shire, just at the railway station.
5431. Would your land be injured if the channel were completed ?—lt is injured already.
5432. But would your land be injured if it were finished? —No, it would be free.
5433. We hear from the inspector of roads that last Saturday the rain was sufficiently heavy to fill
the sludge channel, as far as it could fill it ?—lt could carry a good bit more—it went over the channel, but
not over the banks.
5434. Did it go over the natural surface? —It went a part of the way up the banks, not as high as
the top of the banks.
5435. Did the rain then flood over your land ? —Yes; it breaks on to me from the piece that is not
finished, and smothers me.
5436. To what depth did the water flow over your land from the part that is not finished ?—From
last Saturday’s flood, in some places more than a foot.
5437. To what width ?—About 14 chains.
5438. Would there be an average depth of 6 inches? —It would not average that; in some places
over a foot, and in others not so much; it went into my house.
The ivitness withdrew.
Francis Riley sworn and examined.
5439. By the Board. —What is your occupation ? —I am a retired engineer of the Roads and Bridges
Office.
5440. Living in this district?—Wangaratta.
5441. How many years have you been here ? —Thirty-three years. The creeks called One Mile,
Two Mile, and Three Mile Creeks flow into what is called Hodgson’s Creek. In the seven miles from
Beechworth the fall is about 1,000 feet; all the rest of the distance to Wangaratta the fall is about
300. The creek at Tarrawingee has been very much silted up. I have seen fences there covered
with the sludge about 4ft. Gin. high. A bridge was constructed about a mile below the original channel,


and it was silted up to the extent of about 10 feet in two or three years; I eannot say how long, but a very
short time—not more than three years. The Ovens River is silted up in many places, and at the junction
of the Ovens and the Murray I saw a stream of water in the height of summer, perhaps about 30 or 40
yards wide, and the bed of the river at each side was smoothly levelled up to a curve, like a basin, with the
sludge.
5442. Is that near the junction of the Ovens and the Murray ?—At the junction.
5443. In the Ovens River ?—ln the Ovens River.
5444. When did you see this ?—About three years ago.
5445. That was owing to the sludge that was brought down prior to the construction of the sludge
channel ?—Certainly.
5440. Are you acquainted with this sludge channel ?—I have never seen it.
5447. Do you know the condition of the Ovens itself, except at this point; latterly is the Ovens
between Tarrawingee and here silting-up, to your knowledge ?—I cannot say from my own knowledge, but
I consider it must be. I forgot to mention as to the creek, called Hodgson’s Creek, originally where the
channel is now being cut, the stream of water was diverted, and flowed through this bridge I have referred
to, which silted up 10 feet, to a point about a mile lower down, that is about nine miles from Wangaratta.
Subsequently to that, the course was again diverted. It went into what is called the Crabhole Creek, and
these alterations were occasioned by the silting-up of the streams at different times, and, possibly, also assisted
by the falling of some tree into the water-course.
5448. Do you know Reid's Creek ?—I do.
5449. You heard the evidence that that avus filling-up very much; do you agree with that ?—I
suppose in the lower part it is, to a considerable extent, but I should not think higher up it should, because
the fall of the river is very great; but I do not know.
The ivitness withdrew.
Samuel Shaw sworn and examined.
5450. By the Board. —Are you the owner of land here ?—Yes.
5451. Whereabouts ?—Tarrawingee and North Ovens.
5452. Fronting the Ovens River ?—Yes.
5453. Are you above or beloAv the junction of the sludge channel ?—Principally beloAV.
5454. Do you own land on both sides of the sludge channel ?—Yes.
5455. Will you give the Board any information you can as to the effect of sludge upon your land or
the river ?—At one time it made a course a little from the original channel of Hodgson’s Creek. It filled
that up light doAvn to the river; then it came in again at another corner, and Avent. right through the paddock
for about tAvo miles and a half, came in and made a circle right through, and passed into this Crabhole
Creek. Latterly it came through the Crabhole Creek, but since the channel has been cut it has not come
that Avay; it all comes doAvn the channel ijoav.
5456. Do you notice Avhether the sludge coming down the channel has had any injurious effect upon
the Ovens River ?—Yes; wherever there is a clay bottom and a log across the river, it backs up and causes
the sludging-up —no doubt about that.
5457. You heard the evidence about the silting-up of the Avaterholes in the Ovens below the
channel ?—Yes.
5458. Do you agree Avith that ?—Yes.
5459. With regard to the Ovens above the channel, are the Avaterholes silting-up ?—I have never
been up.
5400. You have laud up there ?—Yes, but I have only acquired it lately.
5461. Are there waterholes above the channel ? —Yes.
5402. Are there none below the channel ?—There are some filling-up.
5463. Above there are Avaterholes still existing?—Yes, Avherever it is a rocky bottom,or a gravelly
bottom, it Avill not fill so quick; it is only Avliere it is clay, and where there are logs across the river.
5404. Have you any present or prospective damage to complain of through the sludge ?—Not since
the sludge channel was commenced.
5465. That has eased you of any ground of complaint?—Yes.
5466. Your complaint would be the silting-up of a lot of the bed of the river ?—Yes. It is possible,
if it is not finished, it may come in again at the back.
The witness withdrew.
William Balding SAvorn and examined.
5467. By the Board. —What is your occupation ?—Farmer.
5468. Where is your land situated ?—South Wangaratta, about five miles doAvn the Ovens.
5469. Are you above or beloAv the junction of Reid’s Creek with the Ovens ? —Part is above and
part beloAv.
5470. Does your land suffer from the sludge ?—Yes.
5471. In Avhat Avay? —In the deposit left on the land, through the floods.
5472. Over lioav many acres do you suffer from the deposit ?—One huudred and twenty.
5473. To what average depth does the deposit come upon your land ?—I should say an average of
about an inch.
5474. When Avas the last time that your land avus flooded?—Last AA'inter—the August rains.
5475. Is it grazing or farm land ?—Grazing.
5476. Does it injure the grasses? —Yes, decidedly.
5477. Does it lessen your carrying capacity of stock ?—Yes.
5478. To what extent —what percentage less ?—I could not say.
5479. You do carry less stock ?—Yes; after the deposit is left on the grass, the cattle Avill not
touch it for a time.


. 5480. When did you first have a deposit on the land ?—I am a recent resident there; last season
was my first.
5481. Then you will not be able to give evidence as to whether the evils are increasing or not? —No.
5482. You can only say there are floods over your lauds, and deposits in consequence ?—Yes.
The witness withdrew.
John C. Marshall sworn and examined.
5483. By the Board. —You are the shire secretary of the North Ovens Shire ?—I am.
5484. llow many years have you held that position ?—This is my sixteenth year as secretary, my
twentieth year as an officer of the shire.
5485. Were you previously acquainted with the district ? —Yes.
5486. For how many years?—Since November, 1852.
5487. You were acquainted with the Ovens River prior to the construction of this channel?—Yes.
5488. And have you observed it since ?—Not to take any notice. I could not give any particular
evidence as to the present state of it. My calling does not call forth such notice. I make periodical visits
through the shire, and hear a good deal from residents. I knew the Ovens well enough when it was
running a clear stream, and also Hodgson’s Creek.
5489. Do you notice that it is becoming less and less a clear stream year by year ?—I see that it is
very thick at times, about four days a week generally; on Monday morning it is clear.
5490. Is that above Reid’s Creek ?—About here and above.
5491. Do you know the Ovens below Reid’s Creek ?—I knowdt, but I cannot say much about it.
I know it down to the junction.
5492. Rutting aside the sludge channel, have you had complaints as to the injurious effect of the
sludge ?—We used to have, not lately, except by parties residing in the vicinity of the unmade portion,
We had complaints from the Oxley Shire about the silting-up of the river, and the two councils have
arranged to do some snagging, to allow a clear course for it.
5493. Have you had complaints from the residents of Reid’s Creek ?—No.
5494. Are you shire valuer ? —Yes.
5495. Have you at any time reduced the valuation of any of the properties within the shire on the
ground of injury done by the sludge ?—I have, in different instances.
549 G. In many instances ? —Chiefly those along the course of Hodgson’s Creek, and a few at North
’YVangaratta. Mr. O’Neill’s property was reduced on that account.
5497. Where is that ?—A mile and a half from here, on the Ovens.
5498. Hoav many properties have you reduced in value along the Ovens ?—Not so many along the
Ovens as along Hodgson’s Creek ?—There Avere some properties betAveen the Redesdale Estate, uoav OAvned
by Mr. Slunv, and Mr. O’Neill. I cannot enumerate them. I think McMahon Avas one, and Longmore,
and I think the next one to it also I reduced.
5499. Can you give any idea Avhat the reduction is—Avliat, percentage, Avliat proportion of the original
valuation you Avould take off?—Probably from 30s. to £2 per acre Avould be taken off in the annual value.
a 5500. What Avould you have placed the annual A r alue at if there Avere not any reduction for the
sludge ?—For grass land along the river, 3s. Gd. all acre; that Avould be from £3 10s. to £4.
5501. From £4 you take off this amount ?—Yes, in some instances.
5502. That amounts to a reduction of nearly 50 per cent, in some cases ?—Not 50 per cent.
5503. You said you made a reduction of from 30s. to £2 ?—Say 30s.
5504. Off land that Avould othenvise be worth £4 ?—Yes.
5505. Have you made any reduction in the valuation of land on Reid’s Creek ? —ln one or tAVO
cases.
550 G. What proportion—anything like the same ?—Perhaps not. I remember making a reduction
in Mr. Chandler’s case. I reduced it by deducting so many acres as useless. I have done that in other
instances. In Mr. O’Neill’s case I did so.
5507. Can you give any idea of how many acres, roughly, you have excised as useless, and upon
lioav many acres you have made a reduction ?—I could not answer that.
5508. Could you get that information from your books ?—Probably I could.
5509. Will you let us have that in town ?—Yes. I think in most instances I made a reduction in
the acreage. I knoAv I have made such reduction, and I think it Avas in that Avay. This Avas in former
years, not recently.
5510. Will you give the date when this Avas done ?—Yes.
5511. You have not recently made any reduction ?—No.
5512. Have you increased the valuation in the district generally Avithin the last few years ?—Yes.
5513. Have you increased the valuation of those portions that have been affected by the state of the
river—either Reid’s Creek or the Ovens ?—They must be, because they have all been, more or less.
5514. There is an unearned increment upon the land —are you increasing the valuations upon the
portions on the Ovens and Reid’s Creek at the same rate as the other portions of the shire ?—Yes ; I have
had no complaints to warrant my not doing so.
The 'witness withdrew.
Alexander Tone SAvorn and examined.
5515. By the Board. —You are a councillor of the borough?—Yes.
551 G. And a resident of Wangaratta ?—For 40 years.
5517. Will you make any statement you Avish to ?—I may state that the council contemplated, before
this sludge channel Commission came into existence, communicating Avith the Government in relation to
the pollution of the river through the sludge coming from BeeeliAVorth. When work is suspended at the
diggings .on the Saturday, on the Monday morning the river is as clear as amber; but on Tuesday, after
work has been resumed, the river is polluted. It is a thick muddy stream, The council have gone to some


expense in clearing the river, and snagging it for boating and soon; and on Tuesday, the river is hardly fit
to look at. Some years ago, when we had some heavy floods, Hodgson’s creek filled up, and the sludge
found some other channel—the stuff went into the Yellow Creek, and the council was put to the expense of
erecting a bridge over this stream, in consequence of a number of people having been drowned there. We
found it would he incumbent upon us to back up this Yellow Creek to bring the stream down the Ovens River
—the silting of the river at this place is preventing the natural course of the river, and the water is
going through this Yellow Creek.
5518. Whereabouts is it?—lt. is a tributary going across about half-a-milo from herefrom the Ovens
River to Reid’s Creek. Kvcntuallv, no doubt, if there is not some check, it will be the course of the fiver
in some years.
5519. Of Reid’s Creek? —Of the C)vens River. It. is making rapid strides towards that now.
5520. Do you mean that, the Ovens is filling up ?—lt, is silting up in such a Avay that the natural
flow of the river is impeded by the silting, and it is making its egress through the Yellow Creek into Reid's
Crock.
5521. Reid’s Creek, we are told, is silfing-up rapidly to the extent of 5 or 6 feet?—lt is. I may
further state that, some few years ago, we could catch any number of fish here; and, no doubt, the silting
of the river is souring the water and killing the fish.
5522. Is that due to the fact that the waterholes are becoming shallower, and the fish have no
shelter, or to the souring of the water? —The souring of the water.
5523. The deposit is of an injurious character ?—lt affects the fish.
5524. What ground have you for supposing that the fish are affected—you notice that the number is
less, but, have you anything to show that the fish themselves suffer? —Nothing further than that, if you go
up the King, Avhere the water is clear, you can catch fish. At the meeting of the waters you will see the
difference. Where the water is clear, you can catch fish; but where it is muddy, you will not catch
them in the same quantity.
5525. The King comes in below Wangaratta, does it not?—No, just here; about 150 yards away.
5526. You have heard the evidence given by previous witnesses as to the condition of both rivers ?
—Yes.
5527. Do you agree with that ?—Y”es; and wherever the silt, comes upon land, it sours it—
grass will not grow. I may state that 1 wont down to Mr. Fraser, when he was Minister of Public Works,
on purpose to get a subsidy to cut that channel to relieve the people of TarraAvingee from the sludge.
5528. In doing that, you are aware that you tvere simply bringing it doAvn to other people ?—We
Avere, but Ave did not think it would cause an evil.
5529. If you had to do it again, would yourecommond that mode ?—No; I may say it Avas seriously
thought of making a receptacle for the sludge, by the Government, near Reid’s Creek.
5530. How many years ago Avas that contemplated ?—Fifteen or seventeen years ago.
5531. Was that the suggestion of Mr. Davison, the mining surveyor ?—I think it Avas.
5532. Y r ou say you represented that to the Government of the day? —No, Mr. Davidson did— avc
simply Avent doAvn to get a subsidy to carry the sludge channel or remove the evil.
5533. You did not go down to make this suggestion ?—No, the suggestion of Mr. Davidson arose
from our action.
The witness withdrew.
Francis Williams SAvorn and examined.
5534. By the Board. —Your are a farmer ?—Y"es.
5535. Where is your laud situated ?—South Wangaratta, on the Ovens River.
5536. Is your land injured by the sludge ?—About ten acres of the flat.
5537. You have heard the evidence given by the other Avitnesses ?—Y"es.
5538. Do you agree with their evidence ?—Yes.
5539. You have nothing further you Avish to say to the Board on the siibjcct ?—No.
The xvitness withdrew.
Michael O’Neill SAvorn and examined.
5540. By the Board. —You are a farmer?—Yes.
5541. Where is your land situated ?—Within two miles of Wangaratta, up the Ovens River.
5542. On the north side ?—Yes.
5543. What length of your land fronts the river ?—Over a mile.
5544. Does your land suffer through the sludge ?—Yes, very much.
5545. Does the sludge deposit on your land? —Y’es.
5546. To Avliat depth ?—ln some places, four feet and over.
5547. Hoav many acres of your land are subject to be covered Avith the deposit ?—Over 100 acres.
5548. Putting aside the extremely loav places, what is the general average of tho deposit upon your
land ?—Convenient to the banks of the river is the higher ground, and then it falls aAvay toAvards Reid’s
Creek.
5549. What is the general average depth of the deposit in heavy rain ?—lt is from three to four
inches this Avinter.
5550. Is that the deposit ? —That is the deposit. Not on the Avhole of it, because I had to embank
on a portion of it.
5551. You have banked out a portion ? —Yes.
5552. Had you not banked out, Avhat Avould be the result ?—lt Avould be just the same over this
100 acres.
5553. "Where does that deposit come from?—The Ovens, and a portion on the other side from
Reid's Creek. lam betAveen the tAvo.
5554. When did you first suffer from the deposit on your land from the Ovens ?—When the sludge
came doAvn through Hodgson’s Creek. How many years ago ?—Seventeen or eighteen.


5555. How many years ago ?—Seventeen or eighteen.
5556. Have you suffered more since the sludge channel Avas constructed ? —Not so much.
5557. How long ago is it since yon suffered from the deposit from Reid’s Creek ?—I had not taken
up the land at that time. It is about thirteen years.
5558. Is the flooding and consequent deposit on your land increasing year by year ?—Not since the
channel was cut.
5559. Is it increasing from Reid’s Creek ? —Yes. No later than Saturday last it went over a portion
of it.
5560. You have heard the evidence as to the amount of silting up of the holes in the Ovens betAveen
Tamvwingee and here ?—Yes.
5561. Do you agree with that? —The Ovens River, opposite my land, has not silted. There is a
current of Avater ahvays running, and there is a considerable fall.
55G2. Are the AA r aterlioles filled ?—ln the paddock they are filled.
5563. In the bed of the river ?—There are some big Avaterholes there yet.
55G4. You do not agree Avith the evidence that the holes are filled-up ?—Anywhere Avliere there is
no fall of water I agree with it, hut Avhere there is a fall it carries away the silt.
55G5. Do you agree Avith Avhat has been said as to the filling up of Reid's Creek ?—Yes, I do.
55G6. Is there any other question you would like to bring before the Board ?—lf this irrigation
scheme is carried out in the North-eastern District, and takes away any of the Avater from the river on to
higher ground, then there is no doubt hut what the bed of the river Avill become entirely silted.
5567. You said just now that you do not suffer so much since the channel was cut, that is, Hodgson’s
Creek does not overfloAv and come doAvn upon your property betAveen Reid’s Creek and the Ovens River ?
There is a channel broken there from the river, through the heavy floods; it has cut a channel through my
paddocks, and that leaves a deposit every time it overfloAvs.
5568. Is it from the Crab-hole Creek you get the backAvater that is hurting you noAV ?—lt was from
the Crab-hole Creek.
5569. Before the channel Avas cut ?—Yes.
5570. If the channel Avas completed would you still suffer?—Yes, through this cutting that has
naturally formed by the action of the Avater, and as long as that is kept open I shall suffer; if it was
confined to the Ovens I Avould not suffer so much.
5571. You do not suffer from the Ovens River ?—I do, Avhen the OA r ens overflows to any height—
it comes over my paddocks and leaA r es the silt on them.
5572. If the Ovens silts up you will become a greater sufferer than you are now ?—Yes.
The vntness withdrew.
Charles Chandler SAVorn and examined.
5573. By the Board. —You are a farmer? —Yes.
5574. Where is your land situated ?—On Reid’s Creek, partly in the borough and partly in the
North Ovens shire. I live on the Boundary-road.
5575. Hoav far up Reid’s Creek from its junction Avith the Ovens ?—I am about a mile and a half
from the Ovens.
5576. How far is your land from here ?—To where I live is nearly four miles.
5577. What frontage have you on Reid’s Creek ?—Something over a mile altogether.
5578. Are you on both sides ?—No, I am hounded by Avhat was Reid’s Creek, there is no such thing
noAV.
5579. What do you mean by that ?—lt is as level as this floor, I cannot tell where the creek Avas in
some places.
5580. Is the effect of that to throw the floods on your land ?—Yes.
5581. lloav long is it since it commenced to silt up ?—Ever since the diggings Avere opened. I took
up this land in about 1854.
5582. Do you notice Avhether the creek is still filling ?—I have written a paper which I will read to
the Board that is my experience of Reid’s Creek —[the witness read the same as folloios']
“ When I settled on Reid’s Creek about 32 years ago I had large ponds of water very deep, beautifully clear, and with
a good supply of fish. The banks were well grassed and of good fattening quality. I used to keep about 80 head of cattle,
I cannot keep more than half that number noAV, and for the last five years, during the summer months, I have had to draw
from a Avell all the Avater my horses and cattle drank. On that portion Avhere I live. No. 13 section B, I used to have
about four acres of very rich flat, on Avhich I used to grow vegetables too for the market—l afterwards greAv grain, the
last crop Avas Calcutta oats, they are there yet; just as they Avere ripening the flood of mud came and covered them
(the oats) completely, so the land I purchased and the crop is some tAvo feet beloAv the surface. Within the borough, and
bounded by Avhat used to be Reid’s Creek, I OAvn 211 acres, about 50 acres of this Avas a rich flat, it is not half the
value it Avas, and for about seven years it Avas as barren as a sea beach. It is noAV sloAvly recovering, but is easily
burnt by the summer’s sun, and mostly destroyed by the winter frosts.”
It seems to have no root, it cannot stand the Avinter frosts.
5583. And the summer heat ?—Or the summer heat—“ When I purchased this there Avere good clear
ponds of water in addition to the creek, these are uoav destroyed by the sludge, and for the last four years there
has not been a drop of Avater after about NeAv Year’s Day —my fence for about GO chains I have raised three
times, and for 3 or 4 chains I had to dig out the top-rail and build a neAV fence and top.” They silted up three
times in one place, the silt rose so quickly that they Avere lost to me. When Reid’s Creek comes doAvn at the
time the Ovens is high it makes a backAvater of Reid’s Creek, and then all the settling takes place —over
12 inches on 50 acres I have knoAvn to be silted in one place, covered completely over in one night; that
is when Reid’s Creek and the Ovens are up together. That is when it had the worst effect on me. I
have kept 80 head of cattle, I canuot so Avell keep half that number iioav, although you may go over it and
say I have nothing to grumble about, there is plenty of grass, but the quality is not there.
5584. Does that grass perish early in the summer ?—Yes.
5585. Take the rains Ave had in August last, did you see the flood Avaters coming doAvn the creek ?
I ahvays see them Avhen they do come doAvn.
5586. You say there is no other channel noAV ? —Not a sign in places Avhere I used to take fish out
of 14 lb. Aveight. I could not tell except from the position of the fence where they are.


5587. Tlie water must come down in a sheet now if there is no watercourse ? —Yes, if we had the
rains we used to have, Ido not know what the consequences would be. Ido not consider we have had a
flood to speak of for seventeen years.
5588. I want to get some idea of the rains we had last week ?—Those last rains affected me more
than the ones in August —the rain a day or two ago.
5589. The water spread over the surface of the ground ?—Yes.
5590. To what width ?—This was not a flood when Reid's Creek was Reid’s Creek, it would not be
outside the banks—it would not be a flood at all. On about four acres where my crop lies buried, it went
nearly all over it. I was walking through it last night after the cows, and it has buried some of it 6 inches,
even with that little bit of flood, and it has mullocked other parts.
5591. When was the last heavy rain you had ? —We have not had one since 1870.
5592. Not in 1880 ?—Agricultural rains, but nothing like a flood. I heard the Road Inspector
speaking about the bridge silting-up on that road. I have myself seen horses and days taking shelter under
it, and now I cannot walk under it.
The witness withdrew.
Adjourned to to-morroio at ten o'clock.
(Taken at Wangaratta.)
THURSDAY, 9th DECEMBER, 1886.
Present:
R. H. Shakespear, Esq., C.E., in the Chair;
;A. F. Walker, Esq.
William Dale sworn and examined.
5593. By the Board.— What is your occupation ?—A grazier and farmer.
5594. Whereabouts is your property?—lt runs from the township right down to the junction of
Reid's Creek and .the river. I own about 600 acres between Reid’s Creek and the river.
5595. Have you any property on the other side of Reid’s Creek—on the frontage of the creek?—No.
5596. Do you suffer from the deposit of sludge on your land ? —I should rather think so. I think I
suffer down there more than the people do above. There is a sort of low place —a basin —it is in the
junction of the river and the creek, and it settles there. My boundary runs along Reid's Creek, but there
is a small point that is not measured in; there is a chain and a half of Government property. lam a chain
and a half away from the river.
5597. Is the bed of Reid’s Creek much silted-up ?—Very nearly completely.
5598. Nearly level with the bank ?—Yes.
5599. What was the depth of Reid’s Creek, in its natural state, prior to its silting-up?—ln some
places it has silted-up eight or ten feet. It was a sort of chain of waterholes in summer time, and when
the floods came down it became a river.
5600. Has that silting up had the effect of causing it to cut out other channels across the land ?
Yes..
5601. There is no longer any principal defined channel?—No.
5602. How many years is it since you first Avere acquainted with this property? —I* came herein
1852. I have had some of the property about sixteen or seventeen years, and some I have only bought
within the last seven or eight yeurs.
5603. Had the late rains of last Saturday any effect in flooding the property ? ; —No, it is only surface
water lying; it has not run the creeks or the river over.
5604. When was the last time your land was flooded ?—I think in June of this year, somewhere about
that.
5605. How many acres were flooded then?—l could not exactly say. I should say 100 acres, or
over. I own 316 acres in one block, and it was flooded with the sludge, and the other was flooded with the
river water.
5606. How many acres were flooded ?—For that part, I do not think there Avas 100 acres out of the
lot not flooded.
5607. To what average depth did that flood extend over the land ?—From 12 inches up to, in some
places, 3or 4 feet, I should say; you could not come to the average. I should say, on the surface land,
where the creeks are not, it would be from 12 to 15 inches.
5608. Prior to the silting up of the creek, would that land have been flooded Avith the same amount
of rain as it is iioav ?—lt Avould, from the river.
5609. What deposit Avould that leave?—lt has left a lot, in some places 2 or 3 feet, and, in others,
6 inches; Avhere the ground is loav the most mud lies; Avlien the ground is high it scours off.
5610. Do you carry stock on this land that has been flooded?—Yes, I keep it fora summer paddock.
It is no use for the Avinter.
5611. Is grass on it now?—Yes.
5612. The effect is not to destroy the grass ?—The grass is no good, it is sour, the cattle do not
seem to care for it at all; they Avill not eat it unless they are compelled to do so.
5613. Do you carry less stock noAv than you used to do prior to the silting-up?—l think it is about
the same average. Since the channel came to TarraAvingee, it has taken a good deal of the sludge into the
river that came doAvn Reid's Creek; the consequence is it is filling up the river, year after year, and even-
tually, in my opinion, if A\ r e have a flood like that of 1870, all the other side of the rh r er will be submerged
with one lot of mud; it cannot get aAvay Avithout going over that fiat.
Sludge. x


5G14. If you carry the same amount of stock you used to do, prior to the silting-up, in what way
are you injured by the sludge ?—I am not any more injured now than ten years ago; but, if the sludge is
allowed to come into the river, I shall be, by-and-by, to a great extent. I can see it coming every year;
the river silting-up fast and the creek. Where is the sludge to go to ?
5615. The evil is not increasing, as far as you are concerned, at the present moment ? —No.
5616. Has the bed of the Ovebs, between the township and the junction, silted-up?—Yes.
5617. Can you give any idea to what extent ?—Four or five days ago, I was swimming in the Ovens,
and I went to the side of the river, and, as far as I could feel with my feet, there was 6 or 7 inches of silt;
that was behind my place; I live on the bank of the river, round by the island where the river is cut into
two parts; there is 30 feet silted-up on the inside, next the island; all the low places along the river are
the same way; wherever there is a low place, it is silting-up fast; where the ground is high, it scours away
to the low places.
5618. Is there anything else you wish to say ?—I heard some of the witnesses speaking yesterday
about the Yellow Creek; there is a creek beyond the Yellow' Creek, which runs through O’Niel’s paddock;
that used to be a creek—there used to be some difficulty in getting across —now it it completely silted-up
down to the round island.
5619. Is that from Reid’s Creek?—Partially, from the river and partially from Reid’s Creek; when
the water gets down it spreads out, right and left, and runs into Reid’s Creek and into the river. I know
all the creeks, Hodgson’s Creek and Crab-liole Creek; and when I knew them first, there Avere big chains
of waterholes, noAv they are completely silted-up, and the same with this river in the course of time.
The witness withdrew.
Henry S. Parfitt sworn and examined.
5620. By the Board. —You are a landowner ?—I am.
5621. To Avhat use do you apply your land ?—Grazing and farming.
5622. Where is it ?—Most of it is ten or twelve miles from here, doAvn the river—about 50 or 60
acres, has a frontage to Reid’s Creek.
5623. Will you describe the condition of the flat land on your property on Reid’s Creek ?—The
whole of it is useless, 26 acres.
5624. Is the deposit on that land recurring ?—Not so much these last few.years.
5625. Was there a deposit from the rains on Saturday?—Yes.
5626. What effect has that deposit—does it destroy the vegetation ?—There is not any on it.
5627. You are not able to put any stock on it ?—No.
5628. The Board saAV the land ? —Yes, that was what Avas last inundated.
5629. How many years is it since you were able to carry stock on the land ?—Not Avithin the last
eight years.
5630. What should you consider the average depth of the deposit ?—Fully three feet.
5631. And the width from the creek back ?—lt is completely submerged from the edge of the creek
to that high land you saw yesterday—about twenty or thirty chains.
5632. With regard to the property you hold on the Ovens, how is that affected ?—lt does not. border
the Ovens, it is two miles back from the Ovens; that is not affected.
5633. Can you give the Board any information—you have heard a good many Avitnesses, and were
with the Board, yesterday, on the ground; can you give any information as to the injury being done on the
Ovens and Reid’s Creek ?—What portion ?
5634. Any portion ?—lVenty or 25 miles from here I have observed the sludge silting-up.
5635. Below Peechelba?—No; 25 miles from here; Peechelba is about 13 miles.
5636. What did you observe there?—The silt and sediment from the mines.
5637. To Avhat depth do you consider that has been deposited ?—A good {criterion is a bridge that
has been erected by the Yarrawonga Council on the borders of our council; there, I should say, there is 6
or 8 inches of deposit on the flat. ,
5638. Are the flats any size ?—About lialf-a-mile wide, sometimes a mile, very seldom more than a
mile wide. .
5639. That is at a point about 25 miles lower doAvn ?—Yes.
5640. Does the same injury extend from there to the junction of Reid’s Creek ?—I can scarcely say.
5641. You do not know anything beyond that ?—No; beyond having heard complaints from the
people of YarraAvonga, that the Avater is being discoloured and silting is taking place at Bundalong, near the
junction of the Ovens and the Murray.
5642. From what you have heard, do you suppose the silt has reached the Murray ?—I do. Ido
not see hoAV it could be so far down as the bridge at YarraAvonga and not reach the Murray.
5643. You are a member of the council ?—Both the borough and shire councils.
5644. Can you give any instances, from any Avorks of construction under the shire council, showing
that the silting has been going on to any great extent ?—I could not show any better instance than the one
you Avitnessed at Mr. Chandler’s. The previous bridge Avas swept away by the silting-up from the mines ;
when the water came there was no waterway, and away went the bridge.
5645. At the time the bridge Avas constructed, the depth of waterway Avas greater than it is now?—
Five times as much; in the former bridge, as in the present one, there is not more than 3 feet betAveen the
beams and. the surface soil noAV in some places.
5646. You put in a second bridge at TarraAvingee as a flood-Avater bridge ?—Yes.
5647. That has been silted-up since it was erected ?—To a depth of 12 or 15 feet.
5648. That Avas erected in 1871 or 1872 ?—I am not sure which it Avas, shortly after the flood.
5649. Has that been a gradual deposit year by year ?—Year by year. I- have ridden under that
bridge scores of times, and noAv you can hardly crawl under it. Mr. Cliandler told you he saw a spring
dray with a hood on it camping under it, and I have seen it Avlien that could be done.
5650. What should you consider the value of that land of yours on Reid’s Creek—the 26 acres prior
to the time when it Avas rendered valueless by the sludge ?—Five to six pounds per acre.
5651. It was good land?—Yes; that is Ayhen land was low—some few years back, Avhen land Avas
lower than it is now.


5652. You informed the Board yesterday that you found the effect of the sludge is to promote the
growth of scrub to a great extent ?—Yes, it does; you observe that on all the farms fronting Reid's Creek.
5653. It tends to check the growth of grass ?—Yes, grass cannot grow there when there is sludge.
I must say there is no doubt that in the future it is not likely we shall he troubled with the sludge to the
same extent, because if the river takes the sludge we shall not have it spread over the land.
5654. The Board hardly understand in what way that applies, because the Reid’s Creek damage has
nothing to do with the Tarrawingeo sludge channel ?—No, but we used to have a large portion of the Tarra-
wingee sludge as well as the Reid’s Creek. In any ordinary flood you would see two distinct streams, one
as yellow as possible, and the other quite clear. So in that corner we had the benefit of both sludge
deposits, they met there and silted-up the low lands.
5655. Have you been in the habit of watering stock on Reid’s Creek ?—Not for many years past,
we have lagoon water.
5656. You have not watered them since it has been in the condition we saw yesterday ?—No, always
take them to the lagoon, about 200 yards further.
5657. Was Reid’s Creek, when Ave saw it yesterday, in an ordinary condition, or was it better than
usual as far as discoloration goes ?—I think about the ordinary colour after the rains we have had. It is
evident that, if the whole of the sludge from the Ovens diggings goes into the sludge channel, it is only a
question of a very short time when the river must be silted up.
5658. You mean the mining qn the Three-mile Creek ?—lf that comes doAvn through the channel,
and gets into the river, it must fill it up. If you had travelled over TarraAvingee and seen the Avidth of the
..sludge, deposited over that land, you Avould see the force of that remark, because if that is conveyed into
the river instead of going over the laud, it must do to it what it has done to Reid’s Creek—wipe it out of the
map altogether. The country that has been inundated at TarraAvingee by the sludge is, in some cases, fully
the four miles wide.
5659. By an average depth of how much I —l suppose the average depth at TarraAvingee Avould be
four inches ; but I am not speaking Avith authority, because not having lived there, I have not tested the
depth, but in many cases it is feet.
The witness withdrew.
Joseph Trotman sworn and examined.
5660. By the Board. —Are you a landowner ?—Yes.
5661. Whereabouts is your property ? —lt commences on the river at the toAvn boundary—the north-
west boundary.
5662. Is your land situated on the Ovens?—Yes ; it has a frontage to the Ovens of six miles, as
the stream runs on the Avest side.
5663. Will you give the Board any information you can as to the damage that has been done to land
by the silting of the river ?—I cannot go back as far as my neighbours. I have only purchased about three
years since, but it is the best laud on the river flats, and the stock Avill not stay there. They always make
for the higher ground, and yet, apparently, the grass is greener on the flats than on the higher ground.
5664. When was that land last covered Avitli any deposit ? —After every rainy season, Avhen the Avater
recedes, it leaves a deposit.
5665. Was it covered this last Aveek ?—Yes, partially; portions'of it; not so much. I have not
been over it since. Ido not think the Avater has receded. You cannot tell till the water goes down.
5666. How many acres are you speaking of?—I should say about 200 acres had the water over it.
5667. How many more cattle do you think you could maintain were it not for this deposit ?—I
think the flats Avould carry quite double the number of cattle if it was sweet grass ; if they would eat it.
5668. How many Avould that be ? —I reckon about eight acres ’to a beast all the year round. I
daresay the flats would carry more ; the back laud Avould carry that.
5669. Have you noticed, during the three years, whether there Avas a deposit of silt in the river ?
Yes, on the logs and on the banks you can see it. I planted some willows up and doAvn the river, and I
notice there is fully an inch of sediment on them.
5670. An inch in height up the stem? —An inch in thickness.
5671. To what height would that be up the trees ? —They were covered ; they were young trees,
just put in last season.
5672. That Avould appear as if there Avas a considerable amount of deposit held in suspension in the
Avater ?—ln many places Avhere the Avater has more fall and rush, it does not settle so much ; but in the
backwater it does settle.
5673. Do you notice the Avater much clearer in the summer months ?—No, it is fully as bad four or
five days in the Aveek.
5674. Does it clear at other times Avhen the sluicing is not going on ? —Yes, it is as clear as the
King River is.
5675. It is your opinion that it comes from the sluicing, not the Avashing away of the banks ?
I have never been up that far; but it comes from some place.
5676. When you purchased the property, three years ago, Avas the grass sour then on the flats ?
I suppose about the same. I Avas not aAvare of it. I did not know anything about this sludge.
5677. Were you able to carry more stock three years ago than you are noAV on those flats ?—No,
about the same.
5678. Have you anything else you wish to mention to the Board ?—No, I think not; my experience
is not so great as many.
The witness icithdrew.
. John DodsAvorth SAVorn and examined.
5679. By the Board. —What is the business of your firm ?—Stewart, DodsAvorth, and Co., breAvers
and cordial-makers.
5680. Where is the factory situated ?—On the Ovens, in Wangaratta,


SGBI. How long has the business- been in existence? —About three years and a half, I should
imagine, on that particular spot. I have been in Wangaratta these last ten years.
5682. Is your business affected by the condition of the river?—*-1 cannot say that it is. The sludge
accumulates, and we have to let it settle in tanks before we can use it.
5083. You lot the water settle in tanks ?—Yes.
5684. Do you boil the water, or treat it in any way ?—We use alum to purify it.
5685. Do you use alum to all the Avater you use for brewing ?—Yes.
5686. You settle it in 400-gallon tanks ?—Yes.
5687. How long do you leave the water to settle ?—Generally all night.
5688. And then use the alum ?—Yes.
5689. What depth of deposit do you obtain in the bottom of the tank ?—About a quarter of an inch
as near as I can tell you.
5690. Do you use sufficient alum to clear the water ?—Yes, it is quite clear.
5691. Then that would be the actual quantity in suspension in the water ? —Yes. I would not say
it is a quarter of an inch, but it is near that; it is more or less according to the state of the water ; some-
times the water is very muddy, at other times it is very clear. It is only two days in the week that it is
clear.
5692. Do you then have to settle it ?—No, it is as clear as possible then.
5693. Do you know Avhat days in the week those are ?—I think it is clear to-day, for one, and it is
clear on a Sunday. It comes down muddy on Sunday morning, and clears about five o’clock.
5694. It is clear when they are not sluicing?—Yes. A lot of farmers down the Ovens state that
they can hardly get any drinking water except on one or two days of the week. It is very obnoxious to
them.
5695. When you started the business, three years ago, did you find the amount of deposit in your
tanks was as great as it is noAv ?—I think about the same; but, since the last flood came down, we find it
very thick for two or thi’ee days at times, as if the storm-water had raised it from the bottom.
5696. The water is of good quality ?—Yes, very good; we cannot grumble about the quality of the
water if it were not for the sludge.
5697. During the summer, when the river is nearly dry, is the Avater sweet ?—Yes.
5698. It never becomes brackish ? —No, it is thicker in the summer time than it is noAV, because the
flow is not so great; it does not get away from the sluicing.
5699. From Avhat part of the river do you take the water ?—We have the pipes 10 or 15 feet into
the river.
5700. Are the pipes resting on the bottom ?—No, on tAVO T pieces.
5701. How high do you suppose the pipe is kept from the silt ?—The bottom of the pipe is about 2
feet to or 3 feet beloAV the summer level of the water.
5702. Can you tell us Avhat the depth of the river is at summer level ?—I suppose there is a hole
there about 8 feet deep; but it is continually silting-up in several places on the river, at this place it is
about 7 or 8 feet deep at summer level.
5703. We notice that at the bridge the level of the water is only 6 feet 9 inches ? —This is a deep
hole, where Ave are.
5704. Is that hole getting shalloAver ?—Yes, it is. In several places on the river, Avliere I go
fishing, holes that I have fished in in-previous years, are silting-up considerably; in fact, if you Avere to go
along the river bank noAv, Avlien this flood goes doAvn, I daresay you Avould find a lot of sediment on the
banks. •
5705. Mr. Trotman. —With reference to the water being fit for domestic purposes, I may say that,
when I purchased this place, I Avas going to erect pumping gear on the river for the use of the house, but
I found this dirty water coming down, and they told me it was from the sludge, so I had to sink a Avell, and
try to refine it. I failed in that, and’ I have had to erect a pumping plant on a less permanent stream.
5706. You no longer use the Ovens for domestic purposes ?—No, we could not use it. I had to take
a less permanent stream, and Ave may run out of water, and then have to get it from the Ovens.
5707. It is fit for stock ?—Yes, it is fit for stock; but I think some of the witnesses said yesterday
it was fit for domestic use.
5708. They said there Avere no complaints about it ?—I think there are some days when they Avould
not like to use it, even those that said so.
5709. Mr. Dodsworth.— Three or four years ago, Avhen we went out we could get fish, now we can
get none; but Avhether it is the effect of the sludge, I could not say.
5710. You have knoAvn the neighbourhood for some time?—Yes, since 1869, when I came up here.
5711. Mr. Brasch. —I have seen tlie river at the bridge Avith not more than 4or 5 inches of water
in it.
5712. The river becomes merely a chain of Avaterholes ? —I never saAv it stop running altogether,
but I have seen it so shalloAv that there Avere only four or five inches of water. They had some boats here
that drew very little water, and they had to scrape the bottom in order to get over'certain places.
5713. To Mr. Dodsworth. —ls this hole that you use a long one ?—lt is a continuation of the river,
but it is deeper than the generality of the places round. A little farther on there is a crossing-place, AA’here
yOu can Avalk over in summer time, and where they take cattle over. This hole must scour itself out. It
is a sort of gravelly bottom, and it sAveops itself out.
The wittiess withdrew.
Charles Wilson sworn and examined.
5714. By the Board. —Are you a resident of the town?—Yes.
5715. For lioav many years ?—I was born and bred here.
5716. Can you afford the Board any information as to the silting-up of the Ovens River ?—As to the
bend below the bridge, I consider there must be a deposit of fully one foot.
5717. In lioav many years ?—Three or four years. There is a tree Avhich has fallen across into the
river, and AvheneA T er there are floods it silts-up there.


5718. Does it appear to you that .that is steadily increasing ?—Yes, and with every flood it is
increasing. Whenever there are floods, or whenever the water comes down, there is a fresh deposit over
the old.
5719. You take the deposit to be an average of three or four inches a year ? —I should think it would
be something like that.
5720. Do you believe that that deposit has come from the mining operations ?—I think it has. It
is a very slimy kind of stuff'.
5721. It is not a deposit that would be caused by the cutting away of the river bank ?—I do not
think so.
5722. Do you notice whether the river is clearer some days than ’others?—Yes; it is generally
clearer on Monday, after the Sunday when they do not work ; on the average it is clearer once or twice a
week.
5723. From that you infer the discolouration is due to the sludge ?—Yes.
The witness tvithdrew.
Thomas Bailey sworn and examined.
5724. By the Board. —What is your occupation?—l am a retired publican. I.amuse myself now
with shooting and fishing.
5725. Have you been long resident in the district?—Over twenty years.
5720. Are you a landowner here ? —No.
5727. Can you give evidence as to the condition of the Ovens or of Reid’s Creek ?—Yes, both.'
5728. Will you inform the Board, with regard to the Ovens River, what you notice to be the effect of
the sludge brought down the river ?—I notice, as a rule, when the diggers cease washing, the river is clear
—when the sluicing is not going on. I notice when the sluicing is going on for weeks, it is so thick that
you can almost imagine you could walk on it.
5729. Have you ever noticed Avhether it becomes clearer on some days of the week ?—As a rule on
Monday or Tuesday.
5730. After the sluicing has been stopped on the Sunday?—Yes.
5731. Do you know the river between the Tarrawingee sludge channel and Wangaratta ?—I know
it between here and Tarrawingee; I know where the sludge channel goes into it.
5732. Are the waterholes filled up?—A great many of them; the. river has changed in- several
places.
5733. Is it still changing?—Yes, it is changing. At O’Neill’s, it has changed its course altogether,
it has cut off a portion of the land; it is called the old river there, and a new river has formed.
5734. You are aware that takes place in any river, where the ground alongside is of a friable loose
nature ? —This is not the banks falling in; this is sludge.
5735. Why should you attribute it to sludge ? —Because the old river has silted-up, and it has cut its
way through the land.
5736. Have you any reason to form the opinion that it is not from natural causes, but from the
mines ?—lt is not from natural causes; it is not from stuff brought down the river from the banks, it is
from mining. If you dig and see the nature of the soil, you will see what it is.
5737. The character of the deposit is such that you know it to be from mining ?—Yes.
5738. What depth is deposited in the river where you say it is silted-up so as to change the course ?
—I could not tell. I know the river has changed; it -is considerably higher than where the river runs in
summer time. In winter it runs round there still.
5739. The river was running in its old channel when first you knew it 7—lt was.
5740. Do you know the river below Wangaratta down to the junction of Reid’s Creek ?—I do.
5741. Is that much filled-up ?—I cannot give much evidence as to that. 1 have not been much along
that river.
5742. Do you-know Reid’s Creek ?—Yes.
5743. Has that filled-up much ?—lt has.
5744. Recently ?—I can see where there are fences where land was bought or taken up some time
ago—about fifteen or twenty years ago—and up to the third rail is covered on the flat.
5745. We have it in evidence that the Tarrawingee sludge channel was completed about three years
ago ?—I do not know that it has been completed at all.
5746. That end of it—it is discharging into the Ovens ?—Yes.
5747. Have you noticed whether it has made any difference in .the Ovens River —the construction of
that channel ?—Since I came here the Ovens was periodically dirty. I could not swear that channel has
caused it. I believe it would make its way into the Ovens; whether that channel was cut or not, the dirty
water would have to make its way into the Ovens.
5748. The great proportion of it goes down the Crab-hole Creek ?—The Crab-hole Creek comes
into the Ovens. It would get into the Ovens some way. There is another place I wish to mention—the
junction of the Ovens and the King. There is a great eddy where the two rivers meet; it comes round the
point. I remember a tree falling in there some years ago, and there is a standstill there—a kind of whirl-
pool back —the water comes back, and the mud has time to stop and settle; there is over 9 feet of
deposit there.
5749. Do you know how long it has taken for that island to form ?—I know I fished there where
the tree fell in; I could walk under the tree then, and now I will have to dig to walk over it.
5750. You think it is about nine feet in fifteen years ?—I think so.
5751. Was the greater portion deposited, do you think, fifteen years ago, or is it a regular gradual
deposit ?—A regular gradual deposit.
5752. You consider it to be increasing gradually and regularly ?—lncreasing gradually and regularly.
It is a loamy sandy deposit that comes down.
5753. Unlike what would come from the natural surface, and like what would come from the
sluicing operations ?—Yes.
5754. Is the deposit in Reid’s Creek of the same character ?—The very same.


5755. Is there anything else you wish to say ?—lt is destroying the fishing in the river.
5756. Would not the absence of the fish be caused by the fact of the waterholes being filled-up, and'
their not having the same shelter in deep Avater ?—There are waterholes still left, no matter hoAV dry the
season is there are Avaterholos.
5757. Deep Avaterholes? —Deep waterholes.
5758. What depth are the Avaterholes ? —At. the junction, Avhere the King drops into the Ovens,
there is a Avaterholo that, I think, is over 20 feet deep at loav water.
5759. We have had evidence that these Avaterholes have been filled-up? —In places so they are, but
Avhere the clear water drops in out of the King there is a hole 20 feet deep, I believe.
5760. Is that below the island ?—lt is at the south side of the island. The island is formed at the
north side of the river, and the hole is at the ilorth side of the island, where the King drops in.
5761. Then do you attribute the scarcity of fish to the discolouration of the Avater ? —I do not think
the fish Avill live in it. I think they have gone higher up the river. We cannot catch fish here; for weeks
there is no use throAving in a line, because the river is perfectly thick, like gruel.
5762. Do you think the fish go higher up, then ?—I think so. They go up the King, or keep above
the sludge channel, or they do not come up the Ovens at all—they go up the Murray.
5763. Do you knoAv whether it is a fact that the fish have become fewer in number loAver doAvn, in the
Ovens, near the Murray ?—I knoAv they have become fewer in number the last few years altogether, right
down to the Murray. I remember Avlien I could go out Avith a rod, and be sure to catch fish any time.
The witness withdrew.
Frederick Simpson SAVorn and examined.
5764. By the Board. —What are you ?—Grazier, dairyman, and gardener, living on Reid’s Creek.
5765. Where is your property ?—Just boloAV the Long Reach, on the northern side of Reid’s Creek.
I have three-quarters of a mile frontage.
5766. Is your land subject to flood ? —Yes.
5767. For Avliat distance back from Reid’s Creek is it flooded ?—From one bank to the other clear across.
5768. What width of your land is flooded ?—Every part of it.
5769. What is the Avidth ?—A mile and a half from bank to bank ; it is all flooded.
5770. Have you a mile and a half? —No; eA'eryone’s property is flooded.
5771. Your property is on the other side of Reid’s Creek?—No, I live on the other side, hut my
property is not. I had to leave it on account of the Avater.
5772. It is on this side of Reid’s Creek, near the junction of the railway?—The railway runs
through it. •
5773. That property of yours is entirely submerged during flood ?—Yes.
5774. Hoav many acres do you hold ?—About 170 in that property.
5775. All of Avliich is flooded at times ?—Yes, 6 feet deep where the house used to stand.
5776. When Avas that last flooded ?—ln 1874, the Avhole of it.
5777. That Avas not flooded this year at all ?—Nothing to speak of.
5778. When the flood of 1874 Avent back did it leave much deposit on the land ? —No. That
property has suffered nothing, so far, from silt. The river Avater floods it generally, breaking out of these
cuttings. That drives the muddy Avater to the eastern bank of the creek, and keeps it in its bed.
5779. What is your ground for complaint, as regards the operations of the miners ?—Mr. Chandler's
property is about three-quarters of a mile abovo me, and, of course, the creek is completely filled up there,
and it is gradually filling-up coming down; and, if it comes down much more, it Avill drive it from its natural
course, and go over some other part of my land and completely destroy it.
5780. You are afraid the deposit will ultimately come down and flood over yoiir land ?—Yes, it will fill
up the bed of the creek as it has done to Mr. Chandler, and serve me as it has done him. Some Avitnesses
said yesterday that they thought freshets carried aAvay deposits and carried them further down the river;
it is no such thing, every particle of deposit that has been there in summer will remain; all the floods will
never shift it.
5781. That is the thin deposits on the flats ?—Yes, and the deep deposits in the river. It is never
shifted after it has been left there. If there is a stump standing up in the strongest part of the current the
muddy Avater coming doAvn causes an eddy, and the deposit Avill accumulate at the foot of it, and instead of
that being Avashed away Avhen you see it again, it is three times the size, and round the foot of every post,
so there is no Avashing aAvay unless there is a Avater-fall. If there is a water-fall it Avill Avash out a liolo.
I am afraid it Avill silt up the creek and destroy my land; and if it is turned into the river there is not the
slightest doubt it will silt up the river. "Where it is most noticeable is'three or four miles from the junction
of the Murray. You will see high banks of it there.
• 5782.’Y0u are speaking of your oavu knowledge? —Yes, no man has suffered more than I have
through the Avater, not from silt. I have knoAvn the river for 25 years, and there are large bars 8 or
9 feet high running across the river in different places, leaving narrow channels for the river, and no flood
ever stirs them. I attribute that to the Murray having a straigliter courre than the Ovens, and generally
rising before the Ovens, and Avhen the Ovens is backed up it "is stagnant water so to speak, and alloAvs the
silt to settle.
5783. When Avere you first aware that the silt had reached the Murray?—The last twelve years,
and I think more than that.
5784. Can you give any idea as to Avliat extent the general bed of the river ha§ been silted-up near
the River Murray, putting aside the bars ?—ln some places, except those bars, [it is not silted at all, where
there has been a stream going across gravel. In other places it is silted-up 7 feet or 8 feet.
5785. Are the Avaterholes filled ?—Yes; and a long Avay this side of that too. Some of the bars are
Avithin four miles of here.
5786. Are the flat lands'in any Avay injured doAvn toAvards the Murray ?—I do not think so yet.
5787. The injury is confined to the bed of the river ?—Yes, there is not the slightest doubt it will
silt-up altogether in time if the silt is alloAved to come doAvn in the Avay it has done.
The witness xoithdrew.


James Pratt sworn and examined.
5788. By the Board. —You are a landowner ?—Yes.
5789. Where is your land situated ? —ln Boorahman, about 12 miles down from here.
5790. Is it east or west of the Ovens River ? —On the east side of the river.
5791. About what length of frontage to the river have you ?—About half-a-mile.
5792. Have you flat lands fronting the river ?—Only a small portion.
5793. Do your lands suffer from the deposits of silt ?—Not much.
5794. Can you give us any information as to the condition of the river ? —I have been 25 years
there, and from what I can see the river is suffering from the sludge that is coming down. It is being
silted-up.
5795. Is the deposit that is coming down the river steadily increasing, or did it come down in greater
quantities in past years ?—I fancy that it is not worse now than it has been a few years ago.
5796. Still there is a deposit coming down ? —Yes; at times the river is quite thick, and unfit for
any purpose whatever.
5797. Have you ever noticed whether the river is clearer on some days in the week than at other
times ? —Yes.
5798. Is it ever quite clear; we have evidence that the river becomes clear, say on Monday and
Tuesday ?—I have noticed that some days in the the week it is clear. I could not - say the days.
5799. That would appear as if it was due to sluicing operations above ?—Yes.
5800. Do you find the water is injurious in any way to stock—so much sediment ?—I could not say
that it was.
5801. Is it fit for domestic consumption ? —Not exactly at that time.
5802. On certain days in the week it is ?—Yes.
5803. When it is clear the water is fresh and sweet, not brackish?—Yes.
5804. When the water is very low in the river in summer, is it brackish' ?—I have never noticed
that.
5805. You knew the river 25 years ago?—Yes..
5806. Have you any idea what the depth of deposit is ?—I could not say, but every year it seems to
be something more; even the gravel they have taken out for repairing the roads is covered up every year
with silt.
5807. Showing there is positive movement going on all the time ?—Yes, it could not be otherwise,
because the river water is quite thick at times. '
5808. We have to guard against mixing up the material that will naturally come down every river
and the material from mining?—lt must be from mining,because it is clear on certain days,l have noticed;
but what days I could not say.
5809. The deposit is coming down when there are no rains ?—Yes, from - the sluice water.
5810. How long have you noticed the river to be discoloured ?—For many years, nearly as long as I
have been there.
5811. You do not know if- it has been any worse since the Tarrawingee sludge channel wa's cut —
that is, within the last three years ?—I do not think it has been worse. Certainly the sludge has been con-
fined to a certain channel more than it was; but, at the same time, it used to find its way into the river a
good deal. .
5812. Is there anything else you would like to mention ? —Nothing more than that I fancy; if it is
allowed to go on as it is, in course of years, there will be considerable damage down to property —serious
depreciation. The last few years have been rather dry; we have experienced no particular floods.
5813. You think, if we were to have a succession of wet seasons for ten years, such as we have had
in the past, a real amount of injury would be done?—Yes, I think so. The low-lying lands used to be
covered for days and weeks, whereas of late years they, have not been.
5814. Have you ever had the low lands covered with water within the last two or three years?—
Last year, it was for a certain time, but not to any great extent. •
5815. It did not leave any deposit ?—lt does leave a deposit; every flood must leave a deposit.
5816. A deposit different from.ordinary river floods—did it leave a mining deposit ?—Yes.
5817. To what extent ?—I could not say. I have never noticed that. It does leave a deposit
among the grass.
5818. It covers the stems of the grass ? —Yes.
5819. Not sufficient to injure the grasses?—l have not experienced any great injury myself.
The witness withdrew.
Adjourned.
