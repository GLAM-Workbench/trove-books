WESLEYAN MISSIONARY NOTICES.
JULY, 1572.
NEWS has been received of the safe arrival in Fiji of the “ John
Wesley,” of the holding of the Fiji District Meeting, and of
the departure of the “ Wesley” from Fiji to Samoa and Eotumah.
On completing her work at the two latter places the Mission ship will
return to Kandavau, to take on board the Rev. Joseph and Mrs.
Nettleton, who, after a lengthened and useful term in the Islands are
about to visit the colonies.
We have to report the arrival of the Rev. W. T. and Mrs.
Raboue from the Friendly Islands. Mrs. Rabone has been suffering
for some time, and now returns to the colonies in very impaired health.
Mr. Raboue proposes to return to his work by the “ Wesley,” in the
hope that Mrs. Raboue may be able to follow in a few months.
It is our painful duty to report the death of the Rev. S. Rabone,
the late much esteemed General Secretary for Missions. For the
lengthy accounts herein given of his lamented death, and of the
services connected therewith, we are indebted to the Editors of The
Christian Advocate and Wesleyan Record.
FUNERAL OF THE LATE REV. S. RABONE.
The funeral of the late Rev. S.
Rabone took place on Tuesday af-
ternoon, July 28rd. At 3 o’clock
a large assemblage of sorrowing
friends—many of whom, venerable
from their age or their standing
in the Church and in society, and
still more who held in grateful re-
membrance the profit they derived
from his ministry, were suffused
in tears —had taken their places
in the Bourke-street Wesleyan
Church, and many more crowded
the place for some distance around
it. Thither the remains were car-
ried—his late residence being the
next house to the church—the
Rev. W. Clarke reading portions
of the Burial Service. The coffin
having been placed in front of the
communion rails, the Rev. George
Hurst read the remainder of the
Burial Service. The Rev. B.
Chapnian, (President of the Con-
ference) then gave out the 716th
hymn—
Hear what the voice from Heaven proclaims
To all the pious dead—
which was sung with great so-
lemnity, the organ accompanying
with peculiarly soft tones. The
President then delivered the fol-
lowing address:—
“ My dear friends, the occasion
of our assembling here this after-
noon is, I am sure, to all of us an
exceedingly sorrowful one. We
are here to pay a last tribute of
respect and affection to the
memory of our beloved Brother


Rabono, w'hose remains w r o are
about to follow' to their last rest-
ing place. Nothing that wo can
say, or do, or feel, will in the
slightest degree affect our dear
friend who has escaped to the
skies ; but it is natural and not
unscriptural, to express our sor-
row, and our deep sense of the
bereavement and of the loss we
have sustained by his death. I
am sure, that when the tidings of
this sad event—l call it sad, not
as respecting himself, but us—are
carried to all parts of our widely
extended connexion 1 great lamen-
tation will be made over him.’
Our loss, however, is to him in-
finite gain. ‘He has fought a
good fight, finished his course,
kept the faith,’ and may we not
say, received the crown. It is not
my intention on this occasion to
speak of the deceased in terms of
eulogy, which I might do safely
and truly—for he has deserved
well of us—nor shall I attempt to
pourtray his character for your in-
struction and imitation —this will
be done at another time, and by
one better fitted for the task than
I am; but I do desire to say a
few words about the very sudden
removal of our dear friend, which
may send us from this funeral
wiser and holier, even though
sadder men. Surely this is an
occasion which we ought to im-
prove, to solemnise our minds and
prepare our hearts for giving up
our own account. How very un-
expected was this event. If it
had happened twelve months ago,
when he seemed in failing health,
w r e should not have been so much
surprised. He, however, re-
covered, and we had great pleasure
in seeing his renewed vigour. He
called on me on Friday last, and
seemed very well and cheerful.
Many of you saw him in this
church on Sunday afternoon, two
hours before his death, apparently
in good health. None of you
imagined that he was just on the
threshold of eternity. None
thought that our dear friend was
so soon to be numbered with the
silent dead. Allow me to ask, is
there any reason why death should
not come to any one in this as-
sembly, quite as suddenly as it
came to him ? Many who now
hear me have occasionally sat
under the ministry of our de-
parted friend, and have listened
to warnings, exhortations and in-
structions from his lips. He is
gone from us, you will not sec or
hear him any more on earth.
Surely it is wise to enquire
whether we have profited by his
teaching—whether we have se-
cured, or are trying sincerely to
secure a readiness for eternity. If
death were to come to us as sud-
denly, should we be as well pre-
pared? Oh, that his death may
deepen the impressions which
have been produced by his ministry
and by his holy living. ‘ Be ye
also ready, for at such an hour as
ye think not the Son of Man
cometh.’ Will my brethren in
the Ministry allow me to say that
his removal speaks impressively
to us who have been associated
with him as fellow-labourers. Our
career may be ended as unex-
pectedly as his has been. The
loved work of our ministry will
soon cease, ‘ for the night cometh
when no man can work.’ We shall
soon preach our last sermon, utter
our last warning, make our last
appeal! Soon our places wall be
filled by others—our work wall be
in other hands. One of our
fathers is gone. In presence of
the dead let us consecrate our


selves anew to our work, and la-
bour for the salvation of souls and
the building up of the Church as
we have never done. Let us seek
to be afresh and more abundantly
baptized with the Spirit of our
Master, that when the Chief Shep-
herd shall appear, we may receive
a crown that fadeth not away.
To his children, this event is the
cause of very great sorrow. Their
loss is incalculable. He was a
wise and kind father, and enjoyed
the love and reverence of his
children. To them I may say
that, for the sake of their father
—who was widely known, and
much respected and loved—they
have the sincere sympathy of mul-
titudes. Last night at our prayer
meeting I heard—and in many
other prayer meetings, I doubt
not, my brethren heard-—pious
men and women praying for the
children, and as the time rolls on,
many, many more will pray for
them. The prayers of the good
are a priceless treasure. These
prayers will be heard, and Divine
consolations will refresh and heal
their bruised hearts. And the
prayers of their sainted parents,
now both gone, will be answered,
we hope, in their present and ever-
lasting welfare. After a while the
bereaved family will find some al-
leviation of their sorrows in re-
flecting upon the love and esteem
in which their father was held.
His seventeen years of mission-
ary life in the Friendly Islands,
commencing as it did when the
Mission was young, and demand-
ing great self-denial, bravery, pa-
tience, and love, have earned for
him a place in the hearts of the
Tonguese which we are unable to
estimate. The attendance of vol-
untary mourners here to-day,
while it is an expression of much
respect, is not the measure of
the esteem which he has gained
by his twenty-two years of service
in Australia. His children no
doubt grieve that he died alone,
that they were not permitted to
listen to last words of affection
and parting, and of confidence in
God—that they had not the op-
portunity of ministering to his
wants in his dying moments. And
they may be led if not to question
the kindness of the manner of his
removal—yet to think it might
have been better had it occurred
otherwise. But He that holdeth
the keys of death and the grave,
that openeth and no man shutteth,
was his Saviour and friend. He
charges himself with the death of
his saints—its time, manner, and
place —and all is right. What we
know not now we shall know here-
after. ‘ All things are yours,
whether Paul, or Apollos, or
Cephas, or life or death!’ All the
circumstances are wisely and
kindly decided. But the servant
was not the sufferer—Divine con-
solations were what he needed,
and were no doubt supplied. Let
the children try to recall the wise
and loving counsels which they
have so often listened to. As to
our dear friend himself, our know-
ledge of his manner of life for
many years forbids any misgiv-
ings. Having found mercy
through faith in his crucified
Saviour, ‘ he has been working out
his salvation.’ It is not without
comfort to us to reflect that when
he met the Master’s messenger,
death, he was on his Master’s
errand, doing his work —going to
publish the sinner’s friend. And
that his last thoughts were of
Jesus, for the text on which he
intended to dilate was, ‘ For as
Moses lifted up the Serpent in


the wilderness, even so must the
Son of Man be lifted up, that
whosoever believeth in him should
not perish, but have eternal life.’
Instead of doing what was in his
heart, the Master said it is enough,
and took him to enjoy that ever-
lasting life, and so he
Ceased at once to work and live.
By the loss our Church has hereby
sustained, I am reminded of
the saying, that God buries His
workmen, but carries on His
work. Perhaps, however, some
of the faithful are taken to
rouse some of us who are not
so faithful as we should be.
But, be this as it may, many
can have little idea how much
we, as a Church, owed to
the care, diligence, punctuality,
and fidelity of our dear friend.
Some of us know that while so
quiet and unostentatious, he
worked very hard. My own im-
pression now is, that if a year
ago he had taken complete and
lengthened rest, his life might
have been spared. When it be-
comes necessary to make provi-
sion for the work which he can do
no longer, we shall know more of
its arduousness than we do now.
In conclusion, though we may be
saddened by the fact that our
dear brother has gone from us,
yet, if we remember whither he
has gone, we may leave this place
moved by a holy joy.”
The Rev. J. B. Waterhouse
then offered prayer, after which
the body was carried to the hearse,
and the funeral procession, which
was one of the most numerous and
respectable witnessed in Sydney
for some time, formed, on foot,
three deep in front of the hearse,
headed by the Ministers of all the
Sydney, suburban, Parramatta,
and even more distant circuits,
with Ministers of other denomina-
tions in Sydney, among whom we
observed the Rev. Dr. Steel (Pres-
byterian), Rev. Thomas Smith
(Church of England), Revs. W.
Slatyer, and T. Johnson (Congre-
gational), Rev. A. Webb (Baptist)
and Dr. Moffit, his medical at-
tendant. Then followed members
of the Missionary Executive Com-
mittee, and a great many of the
personal friends of the deceased.
After the hearse, which was drawn
by four horses, came the mourning
coaches with the members of the
family, followed by upwards of one
hundred vehicles, all filled with
sympathising friends. The pro-
cessionmoved along Bourke-street,
South-head Road, up Crown-street,
then down Devonshire-street, past
the place where he had finished
his course, and on to the Wesleyan
burial ground. The coffin was
placed in the Wesleyan Mis-
sionary Vault, beside the body
of her who had been the partner
of his joys and sorrows in his
ministerial work. The Rev. H.
H. Gaud then read the remain-
ing part of the service, and the
Rev. C. Creed engaged in prayer,
which brought the melancholy
proceedings to a close.
FUNERAL SERMON OF THE LATE REV. S. RABONE.
Ox Wednesday last, according to
appointment, the Rev. James
Watkin improved the death of
his long valued friend and emi-
nent servant of Christ, the late
Rev. Stephen Rabone, in York-
street Wesleyan Church. The
assemblage was one of the great-
est, if not the very largest, that
ever congregated within the walls


of that building. Not only were
the pews crowded but the aisles
were so packed that there was
scarcely standing room, and many
were unable to gain admittance
at all. There was also a large
attendance of Ministers, not only
of those belonging to the Wes-
leyan Church, but to the other
Protestant denominations. The
rev. and venerable gentleman,
himself a veteran in Missionary
warfare, commenced the service,
by giving out the 718th hymn,,
which was well sung, not only by
the choir, but the vast congrega-
tion assembled. After prayer
the choir sang Pope’s Ode, the
organ accompanying with such
effect as to impress the hearts of
all present. The lesson was
taken from the 14th Chapter of
Job. This was followed by the
67th hymn. The venerable minis-
ter then spoke as follows : —A
solemn occasion this. All our
faces are serious, and I can
speak for one sad heart. A
sad bereavement has fallen upon
us and upon all you dear children.
With you there is wide-spread
sympathy. The Amens that ac-
companied the petition breathed
by your Father’s friend and your’s,
in the opening prayer, were with-
out doubt sincere. Oh ! I trust
that it will be ; that he will wel-
come you one after another to
that better world to which he has
gone. Not only is a family be-
reaved, but a Church is bereaved,
our section of the Church. A
Prince and a great man has
fallen in Israel, but we do not
sorrow for him, no, no. Oh ! no
sorrow for him, never. Our sor-
row is for ourselves. We would
rather sing one of the funeral
hymns, written by Charles Wes-
ley, or rather one of the triumph-
ant odes that his great genius
and spirituality enabled him to
compose. We would rather sing
Lo! the prisoner is released,
Lightened of his fleshly load.
“ Yes; the Christian course
is run,” he “ finds his God
and sits and sings triumphant in
Paradise.” We don’t sigh for
him, but for ourselves. Funeral
sermons are common—perhaps
too common —that is a thought
of mine—they are too frequently
preached. But the present de-
monstration is justified by the
character of the deceased and
by the manner of his death, for'
that was well nigh tragic. It
came upon me with an earthquake
shock. A terrible thing it was
a few years ago to hear that the
“London” had gone down in the
Bay of Biscay, carrying with it
one—aye —more than one who
was very dear to me, but it did
not affect me like this last stroke.
I have been trembling ever since.
I am like an aspen now and ought
not to be in the position I occupy.
I wish I had been excused. I
should like to have been sitting
with you, children; but my
brethren ordered it otherwise, and
I have to address this awful
assembly. I have not seen such
a gathering of English faces for
the forty years and more. I used
to see such congregations in the
old country, but they are rare
here—more’s the pity. I feel
appalled at the number here
present, shall we all die? Every
one of us. Shall we all get to
heaven? We may. There is
room, thank God for that. The
highway has been cast up, the
Leader has been appointed, the
hand-book has been entered, and
we may return and come to Zion
with songs, with everlasting joy


on onr head. We may obtain
joy and gladness, and sorrow and
sighing shall flee away. I said
that the death of my friend—and
he was my friend, my oldest
friend this side of the world. A
dear friend. I have many dear
friends and he was a very dear
friend. This death seemed to be
something dreadful. He died
alone—died in the street. There
was no one to encourage him
when taking his departure.
Happy soul, thy days are ended.
None of us saw the struggle
through thy latest passion to His
everlasting rest. Like Moses,
he died alone. No son there to
say, Father, is God with you ?
No daughter there to lay her soft
hand under his head, and say,
Father, is Christ precious to you?
He died alone. To me it seems
something next to the tragic; but
God was with him, for “ He is
faithful who hath promised.”
And the promise is, I will be with
him in trouble ; and the response
to that is expressed in the lan-
guage of the Psalmist: “ Yea,
though I walk through the valley
and shadow of death,” &c. Ah !
there was no walking through in
this case. Just one step in, and
it was a step out, so that there is
consolation even there. He didn’t
suffer the pains that are incident
to dying in many instances. How
beautifully calm his countenance
was. How beautifully calm !
There was a heavenly smile upon
his face. When I saw him last,
I expected to see him living that
day, had made up my mind to go
to Surry Hills to see him. I did
go, and I spoke to him, but he
didn’t speak to me. I said, “ I
didn’t think you would go first.”
I didn’t think I should have to
preach a funeral sermon for him.
I thought if such an honour were
decreed me—not that I deserve it
—he would have done it for me.
But it was not to be. He has
gone ! and we are here to testify
our respect to the departed whose
face in the flesh we shall see no
more until the morning of the re-
surrection. We shall see it then,
beautified, never again to have a
wrinkle in it. Then the voice of
the Son of Man shall be heard
saying, “ Arise ye dead, come to
judgment.” We are here to be
reminded of our own mortality
and of the uncertainty of life.
“ Lord, what is life ? An hour
glass on the run ; a mist retreating
from the rising sun ; a busy, oft-
repeated dream; its length, a
minute’s thought, a moment’s
pause.” And we are urged to be
ready. “ Be ye also ready, for at
such an hour,” &c. We have
gathered to hear a funeral ser-
mon. The text will be found in
the 21st verse of the Ist chapter
of the Epistle to the Philippians,
and it is this : “ For to me to live is
Christ, and to die is gain,” which
text may be treated as descriptive
of what a believer’s life is—“ For
tome to live is Christ.” As descrip-
tive of what a believer’s death
will be—“ To die is gain.” These
words were true of him who wrote
them. Oh! how true. A grand
man that; a wonderful man that;
I go for the opinion that he was
the greatest man that ever lived.
A little Benjamite, as John Wes-
ley called him. He was a great
man. He was an eminent Chris-
tian, as well as an eminent Minis-
ter of the Word. I am sure that
these words are descriptive of him
whom we bewail—whose loss to
ourselves we bewail, I mean. And
these words ought to be descrip-
tive of us. They are of some of


ns. They may he of each of ns.
They must he if we are Christians.
Christ’s religion, like Christ him-
self, is unalterable. He is the
Immutable, the Ever-abiding, the
Priest who has an everlasting
Priesthood. He changes not, and
His religion changes not. There
is a wish amongst some that
Christianity should receive addi-
tional touches—that it should be
improved that it should be
mended. When men can mend
sunshine, when men can mend the
air we breathe, when men can
control the operations of nature
with greater exactness and per-
fection than is done now, then,
and not till then, will alteration
for the better be effected. In fact,
my brethren, Christ’s religion
does not need altering. It is as
good as it should be, and as good
as it can be ; there is no mending
it. It does not grow old and
effete, like man’s productions ; it
is still the same blessed thing it
was in the time when the Apostle
laboured and suffered, still the
same thing—and Christians of
that time were types of the
Christians of the present time—
that is, if the Christians of now
are what they ought to be. “ For
me to live is Christ, and to die is
gain.” We owe all to the Saviour.
We owe all the good we enjoy to
the Saviour. “ But ye who are
in Christ Jesus,” &c. And be-
lievers and Christians may sing
with heart and voice—-
Jesus my all in all Thou art.
We owe the name we bear to him
—Christians. That is better than
Episcopalian, or Baptist, or Pro-
testant, or Methodist, or any other
that has been assumed or imposed.
We owe our salvation to Him—
the opportunity—the power to
seek—the gift itself. He is the
Saviour from beginning to end;
the author of Faith and its
finisher. He saves to the utter-
most. The text exhibits the
Saviour under the idea of Life—
Christ is our life. Sin is death,
moral death, exposes to the second
death, the death which never dies.
For the worm dieth not and the
fire is not quenched. The believer
lives. The sinner is dead in tres-
passes and sins; he is under con-
demnation ;. the sentence has been
pronounced; it only waits to be
carried into effect. The believer
lives, and lives through Christ—
he owes this life of his to Christ.
We may say that he lives by
Christ in virtue of His atoning
death. Every believer’s life is in
virtue of a death. He died (speak-
ing of the Saviour) the just for
the unjust that he might bring us
to God. .He died for our sins
and rose again for our justifica-
tion. The death of Christ is the
grand fact of all history. It was
looked forward to for four thou-
sand years —has been looked back
upon for two thousand nearly—
will be while the clock of time
shall continue to tick—will be
when time shall be no more. For
will there not be a glorious mul-
titude which no man can number
who will have to sing this song,
“ Unto him that loved us and
washed us from our sins in His
blood and hath made us Kings
and Priests unto God.” The be-
liever lives because Christ died.
That death procured pardon. The
believer realised death through
the Lord Jesus Christ. Oh, yes!
There are some who ignore the
doctrine of the atonement but we
are not of the number. We be-
lieve in the efficacy of Christ’s
death endured for all sinners, for
He by the grace of God tasted


death for every man: and of all
the mountains, Calvary is the
mountain for us. “ The Cross !
all stained with blood,” attracts
our notice. We look at it and
we live. We hasten to it. We
say “ Oh, lot me kiss thy bleed-
ing feet and bathe and wash them
with my tears !” Some of you
know all about this, so did this
apostle—this apostle of the Gen-
tiles ; he knew the efficacy of
Christ’s blood. “ Arise and be
baptized and wash away thy sins,
calling upon the name of' the
Lord ; and the man who felt such
a sense of condemnation, who felt
that he was spiritually dead and
expressed himself in language in-
dicative of so much agony, “ Oh!
wretched man that I am who shall
deliver me from this death ?”
This man by trusting in the death
of Christ was enabled to say,
“ There is now no condemnation.”
The Apostle Paul made much of
the fact of Christ’s death. Faith
in it was the staple of his preach-
ing, “ believe.” “ Believe in the
Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall
be saved.” He knew the efficacy
of it himself, he had witnessed it
in others. I recommend it to all
who are anxious to obtain freedom
from condemnation and the im-
partation of a new r life. Our
friend who has gone, whom we
buried the other day, amidst the
regrets of a great multitude, be-
lieved all this. He experienced
what rve call conviction, the law
came with power, “ sin revived
and he died,” he felt himself to
be a guilty creature, asked the
question, “ What must I do to be
saved ?” “ How shall this burden
be removed from my conscience?”
“ How 7 shall this soul of mine be
renewed, that 1 may love my God
and do what is pleasing in his
sight ?” and the question was an-
swered. He trusted in this self-
same Jesus ; he heard what Jesus
could do ; he believed in the
Gospel; he trusted and received
the blessing to which the Apostle
may refer in these words, “ For
me to live is Christ.” Many of
us remember when we thought
there was no mercy for us, but
“ a fearful looking for of judg-
ment and firey indignation which
shall devour the adversary.” The
catalogue of our sins seemed to
be interminably long; our sins
seemed to be frightfully aggrava-
ted—and so they were—and wo
were ready to conclude there was
no help for us but in God, and so
we hung down our heads like
guilty criminals and if the sen-
tence had been pronounced, “De-
part from me,” we should have
said amen to that decision, but
that was not said. Another word
was used. We were treated in a
different way, in virtue of that
wonderful death of Christ. The
word of forgiveness was pro-
nounced, and who so happy as we.
Oh, what a load was removed
from the conscience ! What a
blessed feeling of peace was in-
duced then. We could attest that
of which the Apostle wrote,
“ There is no condemnation.” We
felt that we were brought out of
the prison, that we didn’t stand in
the dock any longer, but were ad-
mitted into God’s family, made
His children, and we were enabled
to say—
My God is reconciled,
His pardoning voice I hear,
He owns me for His child,
I can no longer fear;
With confidence I now draw nigh,
And Father, abba Father cry.
Yes, the title twice repeated to
make sure, “ Father, Father.”
Some of us know what this ex-’
perience is, “Alive in Christ.”


The believer lives in Christ, in
union with Him. The grandest
description of the Saviour perhaps
is “ Christ our life.” “ No con-
demnation to them which are in
Christ Jesus.” He came that we
might have life. “ Because I live
ye shall live also.” “ I live, yet
not I.” These are some of the
Scriptures bearing upon this
point. The thing is illustrated
by our Lord himself in the para-
ble of the vine; and it is illus-
trated by the Apostle, who com-
pares the Christian church to the
human body—Christ being the
Head, Christians being the mem-
bers. Our friend, with the
Apostle, had this experience ; he
believed in religious experience—
he believed in being in union with
the Saviour—a close union, closer
than that of connubial relation-
ship itself, where the two are one.
But in this case the two are one
spirit—one spirit with the Lord.
Our friend who has gone lived in
this way; he had union with
Christ; he was a branch of the
Tree, and he brought forth fruit.
The believer lives like Christ.
He has set us an example that
we should tread in His steps.
“ Follow Me,” He said to Peter.
“ Follow Me,” He says to each
of us, “ Follow Me.” And we
are to walk as Christ walked.
He was patient in suffering, fully
acquiesced in the will of God,
was actively obedient. The
Apostle saw this, and so did your
father and my friend ; he lived
like Christ. This was eminently
true of the Apostle Paul when
called by the Saviour and made a
Christian and an Apostle at one
and the same time. What com-
plete self-abnegation appeared
hero; he was a rising young man.
The sect to which he joined himself
was everywhere spoken against.
He might have risen to the highest
place among the nobles of his
nation, but he took not counsel of
flesh and blood, he cast them all
away, he counted the great and
good things of the world as dung
and dross that he might win Christ
and be found of Him without spot
and blameless. Our friend, my
friend, our brother, (father,
Methodists had begun to call
him,) lived in this way. He lived
for Christ; he might have become
a man of wealth if he had stayed
in the old country ; he might have
been as great an iron master as
as many of those we hear of, but
he was called to work for Christ
and said, farewell father and
mother —farewell brothers and
sisters—farewell worldly wealth
and worldly consideration. He
might have risen to political emi-
nence, for he had a clear mind and
a ready way of expressing him-
self, and would have made a better
senator than many of those who
are engaged in legislation; but
he chose to suffer affliction with
the people of God, to be a fol-
lower of Christ, and to work for
Christ. This, my brethren, is
what all who profess and call
themselves Christians ought to
do. The believer hopes to live
with Christ, the future is the
great thing, it is to that the be-
liever looks, and on very good
grounds he has authority for ex-
pecting to realise a glorious
future; a future in which there
will be complete exemption from
suffering a future of unutterable
joy.
Dost thou desire to know or see,
What thy mysterious name shall be.
My brethren, this kind of expe-
rience is that which we ought all
of us to have, and may I be per


mitted after the antique fashion
to make the application of this
part of our subject. Are there
any here who hate not a saving
interest in Christ ? Christ is not
their life though he died for them,
and has been living and praying
for them until now. But he is
not their life, and the reason is to
be formed in these words of His
to the Jews, “ Ye will not come
unto me that ye might have life.”
His love has been wasted. His
blood has been poured out in vain
in the case of these people, and
it is to be feared that some of you
who are here present are in this
predicament. Ah ! let me say to
you that this will not do, this
must not be persisted in. “ Why
will ye die ?” “ Why will ye die ?”
We hope that you will not. See
to it that the experience described
by the. first part of the text shall
be realised by you. It may be, it
is the desire of Heaven—the de-
sign of Heaven that this should
be the case, and all that is want-
ing is consent on your part. Pro-
vision has been made, the sacrifice
has been offered and accepted, and
provision of grace has been made
to meet your case. Let me then
exhort you to accept the Saviour.
Remember that the blessing He
offers is life, nothing less than
life. I don’t say freedom from
every care, not yet that, but I do
say a happy life, preparation for
death, which may come suddenly,
which will be sure to come. This
my brethren is the blessing that
may be realised by you, and those
of you who have this life value it,
treasure it, seek to grow stronger
and more healthy, so* that you
may ever anticipate that which
was the Apostle Paul’s anticipa-
tion, that death would be gain.
The believer's death. All die.
The believer is taken hence,
sometimes in snoh a way as
almost to justify the strong lan-
guage we have heard in reference
to the great Arbiter’s proceed-
ing
He takes the good, too good on earth to stay,
He leaves the bad, too bad to take away.
Death will come. There is no
avoiding it. The elixir of life
has not been found out, and will
not be. No wisdom can elude
death, no power can cope effectu-
ally with death. There is no
running away from him—he will
overtake us. We must die. Ours
is a dying race. Our world is an
unwalled cemetery. The stench
of death is in our nostrils. The
sound of the passing bell is ever
falling on the ear. The mourn-
ers go about the streets. Death
is sure. To some, death is an
irreparable loss, for they die in
their sin. We cannot bring back
our dear friend by the tears we
shed, by the sighs we heave. An
irreparable loss ! To some who
suffer, death is an irreparable loss.
To some, death is a blessing—the
end of evil —the commencement
of joy, of joy that is never to end.
This view of the text is one that
would, no doubt, have led the
philosophical Governor Festus to
utter again the words, “ Paul,
Paul, thou art beside thyself;
much learning doth make thee
mad.” Death and gain—only
think of the junction of these
words. Gain ! Gain ! Why,
death pushes the monarch from
his throne—strips the purple from
his shoulders—takes his crown
and oasts it into the dust. Death !
Why, it stops the pleasure of the
bon vivant. Death puts an end
to the enterprises of the merchant.
Gain! What does the man mean ?
Gain ! Is it not a complete loss ?


Gain 1 No, my brethren, the
Apostle was quite right. These
are not the words of madness but
of “ truth and soberness.” Gain ?
Whatever the worldling may
think of this, it is true ; and you
might say to the fearful—to those
who are kept in bondage by fear
of death—that death is gain to
those who trust in Christ. Death
is not a loss ; death is a blessing.
The Apostle was contemplating
death, expecting it to come soon,
when he wrote this letter. It did
not come as soon as he expected,
it came, nevertheless, in due
time. A painful and shameful
death ; but he was still in the
same mind when the execution-
er’s sword was gleaming before
his eyes. In the last letter he
wrote, we find words like these :
“ I am now ready to be offered,
and the time of my departure is
at hand. I have fought a good
fight, I have finished my course,
I have kept the faith : hence-
forth, there is laid up for me a
crown of righteousness, which the
Lord, the righteous judge, shall
give me at that day : and not to
me only, but unto all them also
that love His appearing.” What
did the Apostle expect to gain ?
Comfort ? Here we have no con-
tinuing city, we are strangers.
Death is the journey ended. That
last sigh, or groan, or struggle,
was a knock at the door, the door
was open to receive the spirit that
had just parted with its fleshly
companion home; the word is
“ welcome home.” Comfort is
gain—Comfort. This is one of
the words “ now he is comforted.”
Peace —the believer may expect
to gain peace. The battle of life
is over. Friends, how many ?
Friendship ! how dear ? how per-
manent ? Angels, Patriarchs,
Apostles, Martyrs, the good from
everywhere. Old friendships are
revived, and new ones are formed.
The Apostle Paul had been the
instrument of many conversions,
and very many of his children in
the faith, had gone to heaven be-
fore him. Those no doubt would
welcome him. Our friend, our
dear friend would have many such
to welcome him. I have been
thinking—l have never ceased to
think all day long, and at night
when I have been awake —of my
friend who has gone. I have
been thinking of his getting to
heaven and being met by some
that he knew on earth and that I
knew—not people of our colour
nor our speech. Do they retain
different languages in heaven ? or
have they one language there ?
Be that as it may, I have thought
a large group would gather
around the newly arrived spirit
and say, “ Welcome home,” and
some would say, “ This is Mr.
P.abone.” “We are glad you
have come.” “ How glad we
are.” And then under the in-
fluence of gratitude I have
imagined these converts of his
casting themselves at the Saviour’s
feet, and saying, “ This is the
instrument in Thy hand of our
being brought to God.” Gain !
They are all friends in heaven.
No pride, therefore no supercili-
ous looks, no cold shoulder, for
there will be no cold hearts.
Gain ! Friends ! new friends and
old friends, and what a happy
meeting there ! In robes of white,
“ palms in their hands they all
shall bear and crowns upon their
heads.” I sometimes think, if it
should be my mercy to get to
heaven, that I shall get David to
sing one of the songs of Zion
for my delectation. Sing to a


finer harp than his genius ever
enabled him to make out of the
wood that grows on earth, sing
one of the songs of Zion. If it
should be my mercy to get to
heaven, I should like to hear
him, who on Mars Hill, set forth
the true God and eternal life to
the proudest set of men that per-
haps breathed at that time. I
should like to get him to dis-
course about the Gospel. The
gain of friends! How many
friends, my dear friend has left
behind him. We are all his
friends, and I am so glad to see
so many testifying their respect
for the man that deserved the
highest respect. But many more
friends has he got in that bright
world. Oh ! how many more ?
Gain ! the gain of knowledge, the
gain of peace, the gain of friends.
Safety. There’s danger while
here—the danger of mistake—
the danger of falling, and draw-
ing back to perdition. How
often we sing—■
Ah! Lord, with trembling I confess,
and I know my dear friend had
great sympathy with this senti-
ment. He used to sing and say
these words. But there’s no
danger now—all is well. As
they say in this country, All is
well, all is well for ever. No
danger now. No temptation
now of any kind. Safety !
perfect safety. He will gain
the fruition of God. This
is the highest joy. Moses sees
God’s face and lives. Stephen
has been received by his Lord.
The fruition of God. It is some-
thing to converse with Abraham,
the friend of God—something to
consort with Isaiah, the Evan-
gelical Prophet—something to be
associated with the Apostle Paul
—or, to come down to later
times, with that modern Apostle,
John Wesley, and his associate,
George Whitfield. But to be
with Jesus—to see the face of
God and live, to hear the voice
of God expressive of his love—
this, my brethren, constitutes
Heaven.” This gain is pure and
simple, “no crook in the lot.”
Some earthly things—good in
themselves—may be turned into
that which is baneful, and that is
often done —power, knowledge,
health, wealth. This gain is
permanent. It is glory ! It is
eternal glory. The comfort of
peace and safety are to endure.
The friends are to be fast friends
of the God that ever liveth.
These are to be for ever with the
Lord—to die is gain. No won-
der that the Apostle desired to
depart and be with Christ which is
far better. Our friend knows all
about it now. He has made ac-
quaintance with the unsullied
light of Heaven—no night there.
He has been admitted to the
society of the Church of the first-
born which is in Heaven, and can
sing with any of them. Unto
him that hath loved us, &c. He
has gone from us. Oh ! let us
follow him thither.
They mourn the dead, who live as they desire.
Will all you dear young people
follow your father and mother
to heaven ? Say that you
will, God being your helper.
Will you—the personal friends
and admirers of the good man
who has gone from us—will you
give him the gratification of
shaking hands with you again ?
of manifesting his friendly
Christian feelings towards you ?
Oh! will you follow him to
heaven ? Some of you are jour-
neying to the place of which the
Lord hath said, “ I will give it


you.” Thank God the narrow
way is not without Pilgrims—
there are some, though there are
not enough—not as many as
should be—but there are some
who do not go all the way. “ Be
ye followers of them, who
through,” &c. Some of you have
been often influenced by the ser-
mons that our friend has
preached. You have been im-
pressed often and often by what
that good man said, and almost
led to devote yourselves to God.
He thought about some of you,
he prayed about all of you, wept
over some of you. Ho went
away without noticing that there
was any decision on your part.
Oh, make the decision to-night.
Let this death we lament be,
under God, life to you. Live for
Christ. Live to Christ, and
death will be gain. My dear
brethren in the ministry, the
standard bearers are beginning
to fall out of the ranks. Oh !
they are being called to join the
heavenly host. Let it be yours
who are still young and strong,
whose heads are not grey, whose
faces are not wrinkled, who are
still in your hey-day ; let it be
yours to labour with greater dili-
gence than ever, that he may be
glorified. Emulate the example
and spirit of our friend, who has
gone before.
BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE OF THE LATE REV.
STEPHEN RABONE.
THE EBV. JAMES WATKIN.
“ The memory of the just is
blessed,” are words which receive
illustration in the case of him of
whom these “ short and simple
annals” are written. The writer
would have preferred that some
other hand than his, had been em-
ployed in writing this memoir ; it
is the hand of friendship that
does it; a friendship of many
years standing, and unbroken
from the beginning ; and if par-
tiality should be suspected, it may
be easily accounted for by the
above fact; but there is not much
danger of too much eulogy being
indulged in by the writer, as he
desires only to “ glorify God in
him” who has been so unex-
pectedly taken from us.
Mr. Rabone was well known to
the general public of New South
Wales, his name has long been a
familiar one; he was held in great
reputation in his own section of
the Church, and in high respect
by other branches of the Church;
his removal from our midst is
mourned very generally, as much
so perhaps as has been the case
with any one who has been buried
in New South Wales. The fu-
neral was a sight to see for the
numbers present on that sad occa-
sion ; and for the sighs and tears
and expressed regrets of the
mourners who assembled to do
honour to the departed minister:
people of all classes among us
and of all ages. “ Both young
men and maidens, old men and
children,” were gathered at the
solemnity,
Stephen Rabone was one of the
children of Thomas and Hannah
Rabone, respectable inhabitants
of a town, which was notorious
in the early history of Metho-
dism ; and has become famous
since in its annals, and is so now;


one of the “tentowns” so famous
for the manufactures carried on
in them, principally in iron, and
for Methodism. Mr. Rabone’s
friends were largely engaged in
the trade of the district, and he
was brought up to it himself, and
might have acquired fortune by
its pursuit; he was, however,
called to “ preach unto the Gen-
tiles the unsearchable riches of
Christ,” and that call was obeyed;
and that duty faithfully dis-
charged for many years.
Mr. Rabone’s mother was a
true Hannah, and it was affecting
to hear him mention her, and her
prayers for him, as being under
God, the means of his early dedi-
cation to God; for he “remem-
bered his Creator in the days of
his youth.”
Mr. Rabone was born at Tip-
ton, in Staffordshire, on January
13th, 1811 ; and so had only
about entered on his seventh de-
cade ; he was in his sixty-second
year. To us his life seems short;
but “ he lives long (enough) who
lives well; ” and that our brother
did from his youth up.
He received a good English
education, was facile with his pen
and a ready reckoner at figures ;
in fact, he was a firstrate man of
business.
It was seen by the Church to
which he belonged that he was
“ a chosen vessel,” and he was
soon called to do “ the work of
the Lord; ” he became a local
preacher, and filled that position
so well as to be thought of for
“ the full work of the ministry,”
and to that the British Conference
of 1833 appointed him, for in that
year we find his name in connec-
tion with the Appleby Circuit,
Westmoreland, and there he la-
boured with acceptance, as he did
also in all his subsequent appoint-
ments, both in the islands and in
the colony, but his heart was set
upon the Foreign Missionary work,
and the fact that he had relatives
engaged in that work may have
had its influence ; the Rev. John
Thomas, Missionary to the
Friendly Islands, was his brother-
in-law, he having married Mr.
Rabone’s sister.
In 1834, the Conference ap-
pointed Mr. Rabone to the
Friendly Islands, and preparation
for the long voyage and long so-
journ on this side of the world
had to be made ; one of the things
preparatory was, that he should
be married, and on September 15,
1834, he was united in marriage
with Miss Eliza Thomas, who for
thirty-four years was the partner
of his joys and sorrows, (they
had both) and who then almost as
suddenly as her husband ex-
changed mortality for life. She
was a help-meet for him, until
visited with the affliction which
prostrated her reason, and well
nigh rendered her oblivious to the
face and voice of affection; and
then she became the care of her
sorrowing husband, and he cared
for his dear Eliza as tenderly as
she had cared for their children,
seven ; it was a sight affecting to
see, made the heart swell and the
eyes fill as the remembrance of it
does at this time, though years
have passed away since then.
Mrs. Rabone was sister to the
Rev. John Thomas, so there was
a double bond subsisting.
Sometime in 1834, (the precise
date I cannot learn) Mr. Rabone
and his young wife embarked for
these ends of the earth, and had
for a fellow passenger, the Rev.
Edward Sweetman ; the voyage
was disastrously interrupted, the


vessel was wrecked on or near
Bona Vista, one of the Cape de
Verde Islands, and the passen-
gers escaped with life only and
the clothes they wore—the first of
many “ perils of the sea ” to
which the young missionary would
have to be exposed. On the 18th
of December, 1834, the ship-
wreck occurred; after some suf-
fering and endurance, the ship-
wrecked party got back to Eng-
land ; not, however, to stay there
for long. The sea waves and
wrecked vessel had not quenched
the zeal of our friend, our friends
let me sa} r . If there had been
any shrinking it would have been
respected by the Missionary Com-
mittee, as in other and far less
serious cases.
Again they embarked, and after
a long voyage of half-a-year,
reached Hobart Town, in Tas-
mania. There was some deten-
tion, and there was fruit of Mr.
Rabone’s labours in that country.
It is more than thirty years since
then, but there are many who still
remember the fine looking young
man and his magnificent voice.
It was pleasing to see the venera-
tion in which he was held there,
on various visits paid by him at
Conference time, and especially at
the last w'hen he was very poorly,
and since when he can hardly be
said to have been really well.
In 1887 he arrived in the
Friendly Islands, and for a long
time laboured there; occupied
successively the three stations
into which that mission is divided.
It is not necessary to state the
order in which he was appointed
to them. Of the three stations,
perhaps he preferred Haabai.
In Tonga he had to labour amidst
war’s alarms, and was sometimes
in danger; he was “in peril
among the heathen, ” but “ God
was a shield for him against the
face of his enemies; ” and the
wrath of man was made to praise
his great deliverer. It may be
said, without disparagement to
any, that our friend was one of
the most laborious, most able, and
most successful of the Friendly
Islands missionaries. It was
pleasing to see the affection in
which he was held on the occasion
of his visit as a Deputation, a few
years ago—it almost amounted to
adoration. During that visit, a
fine young native minister was or-
dained, and it came out in his
statement that he had been led to
seek the Lord by means of a
sermon preached by another native
minister, and that sermon was
one of Mr. Eabone’s manuscript
sermons, written many years
before. Many of his sermons are
in the possession of the native
preachers, and still used by them,
and blessed by God.
During Mr. Eabone’s residence
in the Friendly Islands, he pre-
pared a vocabulary of the language
in Tonguese and English, which
has been of very great service to
those who have come after in the
work there; and though removed
himself, he benefits the Mission
by that literary labour ; and more
than that, he is represented in the
Mission by his second son, in
Tonga, and by a daughter (Mrs.
Rooney) in Fiji.
The circumstances of his family
rendered removal necessary at
length, and in 1850 he came to
this colony, where he has since
laboured as a Circuit Minister, or
as the General Secretary of the
Missions of our Church; and it
may be said of him in both voca-
tions that he was a wise and faith-
ful servant.


His first colonial appointment
was to the Maitland circuit, and
that was a widely extended circuit
at that time ; several circuits have
been carved out of it, and some of
them are sufficiently large still.
He was removed to what was then
Sydney North, then to Parram-
atta, subsequently to Newtown,
then to Chippendale, in which
circuit he ended his work as an
itinerant Methodist preacher, for
he was then appointed to the office
which has been rendered vacant
by his lamented decease. The
Church, as well as his sorrowing
family, counts itself bereaved, and
utters the wail of Elisha: “ My
father, my father, the chariot of
Israel, and the horseman thereof. ”
“ Our fathers, where are they ? ”
Our fathers’ God, where is He ?
“ The Lord of Hosts is with us,
the God of Jacob is our refuge.”
We die, we perish, but our God
liveth. Our dear brother here
departed, had the thought that
his end would be sudden ; and so
it came to pass :
How many fall as sudden,
Not as safe.
He lived for Heaven ; he was
ready for anything, ready for
everything, for he was Christ’s.
On the last evening of his life,
he seemed to be quite as well as
usual; in fact he had been better
during the last week or two than
for many months before, and we
were hoping to see him in robust
health once more ; but we know
not the day of our death. He
had undertaken the service at
Chippendale, and had made pre-
paration for the duty—he was
an example of careful preparation
for all the duties he had to per-
form.
He took tea with “ the chil-
dren,” as he called them ; con-
ducted family worship as usual,
read Zechariah ii., and sang the
881st hymn in our collection ; and
put the date to both chapter and
hymn—perhaps the last time he
used the pen he could use so well,
before his “ right hand forgot its
cunning ; ” and at about a quar-
ter past six set out on his last
journey, and short as it was did
not finish. The angels of God
met him when death met him,
“ and the dust returned to the
earth as it was, the spirit returned
to God who gave it.”
It is supposed that our de-
parted friend was making his way
to his son’s house, perhaps feel-
ing himself to be ill; but he was
not able to take the few remain-
ing steps, and died in the street;
it was not a painful wading
through the river, but a leap over
it; heaven at one bound.
Our friend is gone before
To that celestial shore ;
He hath left his mates behind ;
He hath all the storms outrode ;
Found the rest we toil to find ;
Landed in the arms of God.
The text he had selected for
the service at Chippendale was
John iii. 14, 15 ; and the hymns
he had chosen to be sung at the
service were the 31st, 34th, 37th.
The last verse,
Happy, if with my latest breath.
And did not his master say in re-
ference to his wish—lt was well
that it was in thy heart to cry
once more, “ Behold the Lamb.”
And perhaps, though no ear of
child or friend heard it, he did
with latest breath “ gasp His
name.” That name we know was
very dear to him ; that name was
often on his lips.
We should have liked to have
had his dying testimony, (Method-
ist people are, perhaps, too anx-
ious on that point) but this was


denied us ; we have, however, a
Christian life of great transpa-
rency, lasting for more than forty
years. We have heard his “Ex-
perience,” as given in Class-meet-
ings and Love-feasts, given at the
last Conference Love-feast in a
way that melted us all. His
allusion to his mother and her
prayers, prayers for him, to which
he used to get up and listen when
she thought her boy was asleep.
jSTo need of a dying testimony
from him.
Mr. Rabone was appointed
President of the seventh Austral-
asian Conference in 1861. During
the eleven years before his death
he was Book Steward for New
South Wales, and under his
management the Book concern
became an established success.
He has been the Clerical Trea-
surer of the Church Extension
Society from its commencement
in 1858. For a number of years
Mr. Rabone transacted the busi-
ness of the Wesleyan Church in
connection with the New South
Wales Government. In 1869 he
was apjoointed a member of a
deputation to examine the state
of the South Sea Missions.
Mr. Rabone was not ostenta-
tious in any respect. He was not
one of the demonstratively reli-
gious ; but you could tell when
he was preaching that it was a felt
gospel he proclaimed, and when
he was praying that he entered
into the holiest of all by the blood
of Jesus.
He was had in good repute by
the Churches, and had a “ good
report of them that are without.”
He was a good man of business ;
one who sought to promote the
prosperity of the city in which he
dwelt, as all professing Christians
should endeavour to do.
He was a good Methodist
preacher—solid, earnest, loving,
and successful; was, as the writer
thinks, very much like Barnabas,
a character of which he was very
fond—“ For he was a good man.”
Farewell, dear friend—gone from
us, gone before us. May we fol-
low thee to the better land.
Amen.
His mortal remains lie in a
tomb in the Devonshire-street
Cemetery, where also lie the re-
mains of his wife : she departed
this life May 14, 1868, so Mr.
Rabone had been for four years a
widower.
“ And devout men carried
Stephen to his burial, and made
great lamentation over him.”
Rest in peace.


THE LATE REV. STEPHEN RABONE.
