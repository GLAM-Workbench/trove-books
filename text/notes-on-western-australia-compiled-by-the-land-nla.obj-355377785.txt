NOTES
WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
rpHE Colony of Western Australia is situated
between the 14th and 35th degree of south
latitude, and between the 115th and 129th degree
of longitude, and contains over 1,000,000 square
miles. It thus embodies a climate capable of pro-
ducing everything that can be grown in any part of
the world, from tropical vegetation to the produce of
Europe; the temperate and by far the finest climate,
from a European point of view, is to be found
between the 32nd and 35th degree of south latitude.
Western Australia is the last formed, but there
can be little doubt will turn out to be the best
Colony in Australia, and second to no country in
the world. Its position must give it considerable
advantage over its sister Colonies in Australia, it
being one week by steamer, or some 2,500 miles,
nearer to Great Britain and India, and there can be
little doubt that in the near future its magnificent
ports of Perth, Fremantle and Albany, to say

nothing of others that will be opened up, will
become the ports of arrival and departure of the
mails for nearly the whole continent of Australia,
from whence they will he despatched by railways,
which are in contemplation, or for which concessions
have been granted. This alone must give an enormous
impetus to the progress ot Western Australia.
In 1880 the public revenue was £180,049, and
the public expenditure £204,337. The public
revenue in 1889 was £442,725. That, however,
included a special repayment from loan funds on
account of moneys previously advanced from the
revenue of £60,512. The actual current revenue,
therefore, was £382,213, against which the expendi-
ture was £386,000. The Budget for 1890 was
framed on the basis of an estimated revenue of
£385,160, and an estimated expenditure of £394,677.
The proportion of railways and telegraphs to its
population is considerably the highest in the world.
The public debt is £1,275,000, or, taking the
statistics of 1888, £3O per head of the population,
equal to 3*5 years’ revenue. To compare Western
Australia with the other colonies,

£786,000, and the exports from £447,000 to £680,000,
being an increase of about 50 per cent. The whole
external trade of the colony amounted to £34 13s.

The export of wool has risen in five years (1883 to
1888) from 3,861,927 lbs. to 8,475,240 lbs.
When responsible Government is granted, which
is only now a question, of a short time, the Bill


haying passed the second reading, and the Committee
of the House of Commons, "Western Australia will
move ahead quite as quickly as the sister colonies
have done. Queensland was granted responsible
Government with a population of 28,000, and during
the first 30 years of self-government this number had
increased to 367,000, and the revenue from £lBO,OOO
to £3,000,000. Western Australia has a population
of 43,332, and 442 miles of railways and 2,970
miles of telegraphs completed and at work, 294 and
560 miles respectively under construction.
The Land Corporation of West Australia, Limited,
have acquired 1,236,460 acres of land in the best
part, or south-west district of the Colony. This land
is held under the Crown on what may be termed
“ conditional freeholds,” i.e., conditional leases have
been granted which have seventeen years to run from
the Ist January, 1890, the conditions being three :
[а) That a yearly rent of £1 per 1,000 acres be
paid.
(б) That within the period named the land be
enclosed with a good and substantial
fence of two rails, or three strong wires.
(c) That the land be cleared of a plant, known
as Gastrolobium Grandijlora, which is dan-
gerous to sheep if eaten at certain seasons
of the year. At the same time, wherever
this plant is found, it is a sure indication
of good land.
On these very simple and easy conditions being
complied with, at any time within three years of the
expiration of the said term, the freehold title in fee-
simple is granted, but if these conditions are complied


with, and the full balance of rent paid during any
period of the lease, the Crown grant may thereupon
be issued.
Fencing. —Mr. Alexander Forrest, M.L.C., of
Perth, Western Australia, brother of the Surveyor-
General of the Colony, reports that the cost of
enclosing land with a six-wire fence and substantial
standards is £4O per mile.
With respect to the removal of the Gastrolohium
Grandijlora, the existence of which in other
Australian Colonics does not influence the upset price
placed on such land by the respective governments,
Mr. Alexander Forrest also states that the cost of its
eradication is 6d. per acre, at which price he has
cleared 12,000 acres, and obtained his freehold title
deeds.
Government Price of Land in Australia. —
In the Colonies of New South Wales , Victoria , South
Australia , and Queensland the upset price of all
uncleared land held by the Crown is 20s. per acre,
subject to stringent improvement conditions, which
include fencing, clearing, and residence.
In Western Australia, the largest, youngest, and
at present the least populated, the lowest upset price
ranges from 10s. to 20s. per acre, also subject to
improvement conditions.
The Concession obtained from the Government of
Western Australia in respect of this large area of
1,236,460 acres of land is exceptional; and under


the revised land laws of the Colony similar con-
cessions cannot now be obtained. And inasmuch as
this land can he held, occupied, or disposed of
without compliance with the conditions of fencing
and clearing for a period extending over 17 years,
at the option of the holder, it will be obvious that
this great and exclusive advantage is of immense
value.
Land in corresponding latitudes in the adjoining
Colonies having soil suitable for agricultural purposes
is worth from £2O to £lOO per acre when improved
and cultivated, the price being regulated according
to situation in reference to means of transportation.
Situation.— The whole of these large areas have
been selected and secured in the most favoured
district in the Colony, namely, the south-west
portion. The greater part of the land is within easy
distance of railways now in operation, being from
only two miles up to forty miles therefrom. It is also
near to good public roads, one large portion being
bisected by the Perth-Albany coach road.
Climate.— Under this head the official publications
state as follows:
“ The climate of the south-western portion of the
“ Colony is said to be one of the finest in the world,
‘ ‘ and the Colony throughout is exceptionally healthy.
“ The south-west corner is, however, the most
“ salubrious, being seldom too hot or too cold, and
“ having regular temperate seasons. At Perth, in
“ 31° 57' south latitude, the mean temperature is 65°
“ Fahrenheit, the average yearly rainfall 32-73.
“ Further south, at Albany, in 35° south latitude,


“ the mean temperature is 60° Fahrenheit, and the
“ rainfall 31-79. Drought is unknown. The
“ mortality since its colonisation in 1829 averages
“ only 1 per cent.”

Soil. —The whole of the land in question is
admirably suited for pastoral purposes, and a large
proportion for agricultural and horticultural culti-
vation. Wheat, barley, oats, maize, and other
cereals grow well in the district; while fruits such
as grape, apple, orange, lemon, pear, fig, olive,
mulberry, and a large variety of others yield
abundantly, and are capable of being produced in
large quantities. The lands under vine in the
colony are yielding an average of 185 gallons of
wine to the acre, worth from 2s. to 4s. per gallon
according to quality and condition.
“ The vine grows luxuriantly throughout the
“ southern portions of the colony, and it is merely a
“ question of planting to ensure an abundant crop
“of grapes.” “ Nearly everything that is required
“ by the working man can he easily grown, and by
“ perseverance and frugality he can be certain of
“ securing a good living for himself and his family.”
The land now under cultivation in the Colony
is 106,000 acres, as against 77,000 acres five years
ago, an increase of about 40 per cent. Comparing
this Colony with the other Australasian Colonies in
this respect, it will be found that, with the exception
of South Australia (which is the great wheat-growing
Colony of the group), the ratio of cultivation to
population is greatest in Western Australia. Agri-
culture is carried on only in the south-western
division of the Colony. There are about 20,000
acres in wheat, the average yield being about 12


bushels an acre. About 130,000 gallons of wine
were made in 1889, and it is estimated that there
are about 5,000 square miles of good wine-growing
country in the south-western division.
Horses and Cattle. —The district is also
particularly well adapted for horse breeding. The
ports of shipment are Fremantle and Albany. In
India the market demand for horses of good class
from Australia is practically unlimited ; and there
is very little doubt that extensive establishments of
this character would pay handsomely. The success
would in some measure be due to the short voyage
from this colony to India and the East. According
to the latest return of live stock in the Colony, at
the end of 1889 there were 41,935 horses, 118,517
homed cattle, 2,364,418 sheep, and 26,354 pigs.
Over 8,000,000 lbs. of wool were exported in 1889.
Timber. — In the south-western division there is a
large quantity of first-class timber which is like fine,
rich mahogany, and also the well-known jarrah tree,
which could be made a considerable and profitable
source of revenue. At the present moment it is
being used in London experimentally for wood
paving.
Water.— This important essential is obtainable
throughout the district at shallow depth. Wherever
land is fenced and cleared to suit it for the reception
of sheep or cattle there is a flow of water to the


hollows and valleys, where permanent pools are
quickly formed. The indigenous grasses quickly
take the place of scrub and undergrowth, and these,
nurtured by the abundant rainfall, render the land
capable of supporting a very satisfactory number of
sheep or cattle on a given area. There are rivers
and brooks intersecting the property of the Land
Corporation of West Australia, 5, Copthall Buildings,
London, E.C., such as the Helena, Darkin, Bannister,
Hotham, Murray, Arthur, Blackwood, Kojomip and
others.
Minerals, &c. —Four very promising goldfields
have already been discovered, viz,: —Kimberley,
Pilbarra, Nullagine and Yilgarn, as the following
newspaper extracts will show :
The Colonies and India , April 2nd, 1890.—“ Another
“ report of the discovery of a new goldfield comes
“ from Western Australia, and a rush has already set
<•' in for the place, which is said to lie to the eastward
“of Roebourne, close by the Oakover River. Large
“ numbers of diggers have gone across from the
“ Nullagine Fields, and the report states that on the
“ new ground a party of five men found as much as
“ 700 ozs. of gold in a few days.”
The British Australasian, April 2nd, 1890.
“ Upwards of 1,300 ozs. of gold have been found in
“ three weeks on the new alluvial fields at Milligan,
“ W.A ”
The Colonies and India , May 7th, 1890.—“ A rich


“ gold bearing reef has been discovered at Camden
“ Harbour, W.A., and it is expected that the yield
“ will be 100 ozs. to the ton.”
lt A man working at Nullagine recently found at a
“ depth of from 15 to 20 feet a stratum of gold four
“ inches thick, yielding at the rate of 100 ozs. per
“ load. Several nuggets weighing from 15 to 30 ozs.
“ have been found on the field.”
The Colonies and India , May 14th, 1890. —“ Still
“ more glowing accounts are coming to hand by each
“ successive mail respecting the prospects of thegold-
“ fields in this Colony. A report from the Pilbarra
‘ ‘ country states that two men who were starting from
“ the Nullagine had gone but a few hundred yards
“ when their horse kicked up a small nugget. They
“ looked about and found more gold, and in nine days
“ obtained 26 ozs. They were still doing well, and
‘‘ 50 men were on the field when the mail left. It is
“ also stated that a man, named Beaton, found in the
‘ ‘ conglomerate in the main camp at Pilbarra a stratum
‘‘ of gold bearing ore about four inches thick,at a depth
“oflsto 20 feet. It gets thinner but richer as it is
“ worked, and takes an average of eight days to
“ obtain a load. It is estimated that Beaton has
“ got nearly 1,000 ozs. in two months. Other parties
“ are also working near him, but with less results.
“ Another big nugget, weighing 30 ozs., has been
“ found near Mosquito Creek by a man named
“ Wheelock ; also one weighing 20 ozs., by another
“ man near the same place.”


Daily Chronicle, May 20th, 1890.—“ At the time
‘ ‘ the mail left Western Australia, great excitement
‘ ‘ prevailed throughout the colony in connection with
“an extensive gold discovery at Ashburton. Tele-
“ grams from that field state that various parties
“ have obtained 1,000 ozs. of gold. Another telegram
“ from Roebourne station states that much interest is
“ still felt regarding the new find on the Ashburton.
“ It is believed that the find is the richest the colony
“ has yet seen. Several large nuggets have been
“ unearthed and a large quantity of loose gold.
“ There is plenty of water on the scene of the
“ discovery, and the Ashburton people are all leaving
“ for the find.”
“ News fromYilgarn states that the Central Mine
“ has struck rich stone at the 80 feet level.”
Nothing is known of the mineral wealth of the
large quantity of land held by the Land Corporation
of West Australia, covering as it does about 2,000
square miles of country, regarding the greater
portion of which no geological examination has been
undertaken. The Rev. C. G-. Nicolay, of Fremantle,
in his pamphlet on the geologyof Western Australia,
after referring to the Northern or Kimberley District
Gold Fields, observes that ‘ ‘ the mineral wealth of
“ the rest of the Colony is undoubtedly great, ores
“ of metals, as might be expected from its geological
“ structure, being widely distributed,” and he alludes
to the fact that the existence of gold within the
south-western district is known.


“ Diorite is the country rock of some of the chief
“ gold veins of Venezuela. Gold is found in the dis-
“ integrated diorites of Khutel, Turkestan. The placer
“ gold of the Urals, according to Murchison, lies chiefly
“ on the greenstone bed rock. Greenstone or diorite is
“ the main source of much of the gold of New Guinea,
“ and of New South Wales. At Temora gold is found
“ in the reefs traversing diorite, but not those in the
“ slate. Some of the reefs on the Thames Gold Field,
“New Zealand, are in diorite. Diorite dykes accompany
“ many of the Ballarat, Gippsland and Western Aus-
tralian veins.”—“Practical Gold Mining.” C. G.
Warnford-Lock. 1889.
The West Australian Government Geologist, Mr.
Henry T. L. Brown, in his report on the south-
western district of the Colony (south of the Murchison
River), 1873, says :
“ Greenstone or diorite, a rock composed of two
“ minerals, feldspar and hornblende, is very common
“in the western and south-western parts of the
“ Colony. It occurs in the form of dykes, traversing
“ the granite, metamorphic, and slaty rocks, and also
“ in large masses' 1
Judging from these authorities there is evidently
great scope for prospecting on the land, and encou-
raging evidence of the possibility of valuable deposits
of gold, silver and other metals being found, which
would immediately enhance its value enormously.
Pearls. —The value of the export of pearls and
pearl shells to England in 1888 was .£84,311.


There is no civilised country in the world where
good lands, easy of access, having a splendid climate
and many other grand natural advantages, can he
acquired on anything like such terms and conditions.
These have also all the advantages of being within
Her Majesty’s dominions, thus ensuring title and
possession.
Under a liberal system of government, the Colony
of Western Australia will, without doubt, go ahead
in leaps and bounds like her sister colonies have done;
and the lands, which can now be secured on low and
exceptionally favourable conditions, must under these
circumstances greatly advance in value.

EXTRACTS from REPORTS of Mr. H. S. RAHFORD,
Dated Perth , Western Australia , 14 th July
and 12 th August , 1887.
In accordance with your request, I beg herewith
to hand you a report with reference to the land
applied for by the Land Corporation of West
Australia, Limited.
The conditions under which this land is held are,
that £ 1 per thousand acres per annum shall be paid
as rent. The term of lease to be 21 years. Three
years after all indigenous plants have been proved
to be destroyed, the land then being substantially
fenced, a Crown grant can be obtained by paying
balance of rent, that is, by making total payments,
as rent, amount to .£2l (twenty-one pounds) per
thousand acres.
The cost of fencing the blocks held by the Land
Corporation of West Australia will be very
favourably influenced by the fact that along all the
boundary lines the proper timber for this work
(jarrah or white gum) is now growing in large
quantities, so that very little carting will be required.
The land south-west of York, bounded by Mount
Observation, Mount Dale, Boyaganing Hill and


Goolaring Hill, will form a valuable property when
fenced and cleared of plant, as this country is
within easy reach of the capital of this Colony, On
these blocks near Mount Dale a splendid supply of
jarrah timber can be obtained, and in the future, no
doubt, saw mills will be established here, and this
industry will be carried out to the advantage of the
proprietors. The land nearer York is well adapted
for pastoral purposes, as runs for sheep, cattle and
horses.
The land extending from Yaganing on the Perth-
Albany Road to Mount Saddleback comprises a large
area that can well be utilised for agricultural
or pastoral pursuits. In this section of the Colony a
large annual rainfall can be depended upon. Wheat
and other cereals can be grown, yielding in many
cases quite 25 bushels per acre; this average has
been obtained by farmers in the Hotham River, to
my knowledge, without the application of any
manure whatever.
Grape-vines, peaches, apples, nectarines, apricots,
figs, plums, mulberries, quinces, almonds, goose-
berries, oranges, lemons, citrons, bananas, straw-
berries, loquats, pomegranates, olives, melons, &c.,
grow luxuriantly with very little attention, and to
the cultivation of these fruits I think a large amoun
of attention should be devoted. Anyone who has
travelled through these districts as I have must
have been struck with the vigorous growth of the
fruit trees in these parts.


Nearly every settler lias a good supply of choicest
fruits in each season, but as yet in this district no
attempt has been made to go in for fruit-preserving
works; and annually very large amounts of money
are sent out of the Colony to America and elsewhere
for dried and bottled fruits that can be produced
here equal in quantity to those grown in any other
part of the world.
There is a splendid opening for the prosecution of
the fruit industry in this Colony, and for the suc-
cessful working of this project 1 should suggest that
in the first instance peasants from either Italy, Ger-
many, Switzerland, or Spain should be procured—
men whose early training has fitted them in these
pursuits.
Another industry that could be well carried out in
these properties would be the establishment of fac-
tories for the curing of hams, bacon, pork, &c., for
which there is a great demand at present, not only in
the southern portions of this Colony but also in the
Kimberley district.
“This latter settlement, from which such good
“ reports as to its wealth as a gold mining and reef
“ country are now coming freely to hand, will, in
“ the near future, prove a splendid market, and one
“ easily reached, for all the products that the southern
“ portions are well able to supply. Some of the
“ richest reefs in the world have been discovered in
“ East Kimberley.”


My remarks as to the land in the vicinity of the
Bannister, Hotham, and Williams Rivers, will also
appty to the land south of the Beaufort River.
. The whole of the lands held by the Land Corpora-
tion of West Australia are well adapted for the
breeding of sheep, cattle, and horses, when cleared
and fenced in.
Trusting this undertaking may be carried out to a
successful issue, which in my opinion is quite prac-
ticable if well managed,
I remain, Sirs,
Yours very truly,

EXTRACTS from the REPORT of Mr. E. T. HOOLEY,
Local Managing Director of Dalgetty & Co., Limited,
and Government Inspector of Lands,
Dated Perth , Western Australia , 1 5th October , 1887.
In compliance with your request, I will now give
you a report upon certain lands leased from the
Crown hy the Land Corporation of West Australia,
Limited.
I will deal with the Corporation land under the
following heads, viz., pastoral, agricultural, and
horticultural.
Pastoral will apply to the whole of the country
examined by me.
The large tract selected by the Corporation,
between Perth and the eastern districts, along the
course of the Helena and Harking Rivers, consists
of open forests, timbered with white and red gum
and jarrah, some of the latter being excellent timber.
Much of this country is very hilly, the tops of which,
in the jarrah forests, are covered with ironstone and
coarse gravel. The white gum country consists
chiefly of a grey loam of a medium quality, whilst
the red gum is generally found on a much richer soil


The whole of this country would be very suitable for
cattle stations, and being near a good market, would
pay well for the outlay needful to bring it into
practicable use.
This ground is well watered by permanent pools
and springs, besides which water can be procured in
the gullies at easy depths, or by damming.
Along the course of the Helena River there is a
very rich alluvial soil, capable of producing cereals,
root crops or fruit of any description.'
The country along the Albany Road, commencing
47 miles from Perth, and extending to the 63-mile
post, is composed of open jarrah forests, with patches
of white gum, with black-boy valleys, and patches of
springy ground, which make the best of gardens or
potato plots.
On several of these blocks there is a large quantity
of first-class Jarrah, which in a short time must
become very valuable.
In the neighbourhood of the Bannister and Hotham
Rivers the country improves from an agricultural
point of view, and there is a large extent of good
agricultural land of rich chocolate soil and dark loam,
which, with the abundant rainfall of this district,
will yield heavy grain crops. Towards the junction
of the Hotham and Murray Rivers the land is still
richer, and here the York-road plant may be found
on the richest soil, although to no extent.
The whole of this country may be said to be well
watered, as, in addition to many permanent pools in


the rivers, there are many springs, and numerous
gullies which may be dammed at a moderate cost.
To tit the country for pastoral purposes (and the
whole of the land held hy the Corporation may be
so utilised) it will be necessary to enclose it with a
5-wire fence, if intended for horses and cattle, or
with 6 wires if intended for sheep.
I would recommend enclosing the country in
blocks of, say, 50,000 acres.
For agricultural purposes I consider, as before
stated, that the best land lies along the Hotham and
Murray Rivers.
Horticultural. —In this industry I consider the
Corporation have unlimited scope. In fact 1 have
no hesitation in saying that the suitable portions of
the Company’s land are capable of producing wine
(and, of course, brandy), oil and fruit, including
apples, pears, peaches, plums, figs, apricots, loquats,
oranges, lemons, &c., in quantities to supply the
United Kingdom.
The principal timber on horticultural land is
jarrah and paper bark, which does not burn freely
even when dead. In preparing land for vines or fruit
trees, the maximum cost would he £6 to £1 per acre.
Vines will the third year yield 200 gallons of wine,
which if sold at the low price of 35., will give a
return of £3O per acre.
By keeping fowls and pigs, which would get their
own living, and with milk and butter, and such crops


as the ground would yield, a family would easily
make ends meet until the vines and trees gave a
return. In addition to the foregoing there is a lot of
ready money to he made out of kangaroo hunting;
skins are now worth from Is. 6d. to 4s. 6d. each on
the spot, and I have known a man during the past
winter to make, by kangarooing on the Company’s
land, from 20s. to 30s. per day. Then again there
are opossum skins to be obtained in large numbers ;
these are now worth out here 4s. per dozen. Again,
throughout the whole of the Corporation’s land wild
honey abounds, and many of the country people use
this as a substitute for sugar.
