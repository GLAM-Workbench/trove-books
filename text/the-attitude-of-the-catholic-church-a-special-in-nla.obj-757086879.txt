I trust this booklet will be received
without sectarian suspicion. Its

the “ Westminster Gazette” (Lon-

(Sydney). “ The interview” care-
fully revised, is now offered to
everyone, in a new dress, which, sig-
nificantly enough, was suggested if
not actually provided by some of
the leading men in Sydney who do
not accept all the teachings of the
Catholic Church, but who admire
the wisdom and the patriotism
of his Eminence the Australian

CATHOLIC DEMOCRACY.
/Cardinal Moran spends most
of his time at his city
residence at the back of the
Cathedral. There in the outer
chambers he is safely guarded
from intruders by an elderly,
clean-shaven, Blarney - proof
Irishman, and attended by his
secretary, Dr. O’Haran. Out-
wardly, thehouse looks deserted,
and the furniture in the hall
and in the waiting-rooms would
not lead one to believe that
the place is occupied by a prince
of the Church. In his tastes
the Cardinal is severely simple.




To get a press interview with
his Eminence is more than a
matter of every-day difficulty.
It was only after much nego-
tiation that I received an invi-
tation to St. Mary’s to talk
with him about the present
attitude of the Church in regard
to social, political, and educa-
tional questions in Australia.
Dr. O’Haran led me up a
flight of stairs and into a large
room, on the walls of which
were cases of books and two or
three pictures, copies from the
works of Old Masters. I had
not been waiting long when the
Cardinal entered the room. He
was dressed in a dark cassock
with a red border, and over the


cassock he wore a purple tippet,
and on his breast a small golden
cross.
He received me without
ceremony, and I remarked that
he was no doubt interested to
learn from a recent cablegram
that the Primate was satisfied
with the educational system of
New South Wales.


11.
“the real problem of society.”
“ I had many conversations
on the subject with his prede-
cessor, the Right Rev. Dr.
Barry,” replied his Eminence.
“ He looked on religion as an
essential element in education,
and he publicly declared in
many of his addresses that the
stand the Catholics had taken
was the right one. Of course
we regard the problem of edu-
cation as the real problem of
society at the present day.
We consider that if the children
are allowed to grow up without
religion or in indifference to


religion that the future of the
nation must be tainted with the
same impiety or indifference,
and that—particularly to-day
—nothing can be more detri-
mental to the true interests of
society than the growth of irre-
ligion. The wealthier classes
can provide means for having
their children trained in religion
and piety, independently of
scholastic training, but for the
great mass of the children the
only education is that afforded
by the public schools. Now-
adays the mass of the people
cannot be overlooked, not only
as an element of society, but
as a governing element. We
used to speak of the 18th


century as a century of aristo-
crats or of absolute government.
In the present age, and parti-
cularly in these independent
colonies of the British Empire,
democracy is the ruling power,
and if democracy is allowed to
be tainted with irreligion or
socialism, or impiety—by what-
ever name it may be called—
the future of society must be
sad indeed.”
“ Is socialism, then,” I asked,
“another name for impiety ?”
“I do not wish to include
under that name Christian
socialism,” the Cardinal an-
swered. “I mean that socialism
which corresponds to commun-
ism in France and Nihilism in


Russia, and is known by other
names in different parts of
Spain and Germany. Impiety
is at its root, and its fruits
present all the bitterness of
that impiety.”

THE PRIEST IN POLITICS.
In talking on political mat-
ters, I remarked that it was
said in some quarters that the
priest exercised an undue in-
fluence over the politics of the
country.
His Eminence did not think
so.
“ The clergy, as individuals,”
he said, “ have their rights the
same as any other individual in
this free country, and they are
equally entitled to follow their
conscientious convictions, but
without exercising any undue
influence in regard to others.


“ As regards myself, person-
ally, I take no part in politics,
and neither the freetraders nor
the protectionists have ever
as yet been able to discover
whether I am a freetrader or a
protectionist, and it will be
some time before they make
that discovery.”
“ A great number of Catho-
lics are freetraders,” he con-
tinued. “ Some of the leading
freetraders in Sydney are Catho-
lics. On the other hand, very
many other Catholics, and some
of them leading men in the
political party, are protection-
ists. They are all my friends,
and I trust both parties will
continue to exercise with all


freedom their conscientious
opinions on all matters calcu-
lated to promote the interests
of Australia. lam convinced
that the Catholic clergy and
the Catholic body do not yield
in the matter of patriotism to
any other denomination in the
country. On the contrary, I
am fully assured that in this
matter of true patriotism they
are to be reckoned among the
most unselfish and disinterested
friends of progress in our
various colonies.”


IV.
THE EDUCATIONAL QUESTION AS IT
STANDS TO-DAY.
“ But,” I said, “ is the edu-
cational question, of which we
have just been speaking, not
still a matter of political im-
portance to the Church ?”
“ The educational question
at present is practically not
discussed,” his Eminence said,
in reply. “It has no place
in the political programmes of
either of the leading parties.
The Catholic clergy and Catho-
lic body do not desire to inter-
fere in any way with those
who are content with the public


school system. We all feel
that, logically speaking, and
considering the principle on
which the system rests, it
should bring indifferentism and
ruin into social life amongst us.
But we also know from experi-
ence that through the influence
of parents, and many other
social influences, these evil
principles do not always work
out their logical conclusions.
“ Catholics in the country
districts avail themselves of the
public schools, because there
are no other schools available.
But, then, we instruct the
parents to make up by special
exercises in religion for the
defect in the school education


of these children, and we hope
that in these special cases
Providence will not be wanting
in assistance to overcome the
difficulties that would other-
wise seem unsurmountable, and
should work ruin in so many
families. At the same time,
it should be remembered, our
convent schools, and those con-
ducted by the various brother-
hoods, are not only religious
schools, but they compete in
every branch of the curriculum
with the best of the public
schools, and at the public ex-
aminations very many children
from our religious schools carry
away the prizes.”


V.
THE PROSPECTS OF STATE AID.
We then talked about the
prospects of State aid.
The Cardinal said :
“It is difficult to foretell
what may be the educational
system in 20 years hence. One
thing is certain—that the per-
manence of our Catholic schools
is secure ; and in our Catholic
schools I trust the educational,
as well as the religious, training
of our children will attain that
perfection to which all our en-
deavours are directed. Many
of our schools at present have
attained that perfection, especi


ally the schools conducted by
our devoted nuns. lam con-
vinced in no part of the world
will you find a more useful or
a higher and more ennobling
teaching carried on than in our
convent schools.
“In the matter of State aid,
although the political future
is necessarily uncertain, I am
convinced that the time will
come when the Australian
Governments will recognise our
Catholic schools, and will do
justice to our excellent Catholic
teachers. It has been more
than once proposed by very
distinguished Protestants that
the Catholic schools should be
recognised, and that they should


receive compensation from the
State for the secular results
achieved. Should that be
granted at any time, the de-
mands of the Catholic body
will be in a great measure
satisfied. They have never
asked for more.”


VI.
THE SOCIAL POSITION OF IRISH-,
AUSTRALIANS.
Speaking on the unemployed
question, I asked his Eminence
if it were true that a large
proportion of that body were
Irish.
He could not state the pro-
portions, but he added :
“ I don’t think the Catholics
are more numerous, or so
numerous, as other denomina-
tions in the ranks of the unem-
ployed. For instance, in the
Pitt Town Labour Settlement,
and in other efforts that have
been made to relieve those out


of work, as far as I can learn
the proportion of Catholics is
about the same as our numeri-
cal proportion in the census of
the country. The last census,
that of ’9l, makes us a little
more than 25 per cent, of the
population.
“ Looking at the public posi-
tion of the Catholic body—
which, of course, although
mostly Irish or of Irish descent,
includes representatives from
almost every country —they
are seen to be able to hold
their own in all public offices,
and in the professions and the
private and commercial enter-
prises of the country.”


VII.
“ THE CHURCH OF THE POOR,’
In the advanced democratic
camp, where schemes are being
hatched for turning humanity
upside down, attacks are often
made upon the conservatism of
the Catholic Church.
Cardinal Moran, however,
claims that the policy of the
Church is essentially demo-
cratic In the course of the
conversation he said :
“ The Catholic Church has
always been proud to be the
Church of the poor. We look
back to the first days of the


Gospel, when the apostles re-
ceived their mission to protect
the poor, and it has always
been the boast of the Church
that, in her dealings with the
poor, the prophecy of the Re-
deemer has been fulfilled. We
have had the poor always with
us. And I trust that to the
end of time we may never lose
that prerogative of ministering
to the poor. At the same
time, the Church labours for
every class, for people in every
condition of life, but if one class
merits her predilection more
than another, it is the poor.
All her sympathies are with
those who are using their en-
deavours to lift up the vast


number who are in poverty,
and to alleviate the misery that
prevails.
“In a country such as Aus-
tralia, with its boundless re-
sources, there is abundance for
every class, and the efforts of
the Government and of philan-
thropists should be mainly
directed to bring that abun-
dance within the reach of those
who have been hitherto ex-
cluded from it.”


VIII.
WEALTH AND WANT.
“ The main question is, of
course : How should these
efforts be directed ?”
“ So far as the Church is
concerned, we would be far
from wishing to deprive anyone
of his property, or to pull down
the wealthy classes. We would
rather wish to lift up those
that are in indigence, that all
may partake of the abundance
which nature supplies in this
favoured country.
“That which is often spoken
of as the antagonism of the


labouring classes against em-
ployers, so far as it merits the
approval of any sensible man,
is in many ways a misnomer.
It is rather an antagonism to the
unjust dealings of employers,
to unfair monopoly, and to the
greediness of many who are
in possession of wealth. The
object of those who are engaged
in the contest should be not to
rob the men who are rich of
their wealth, but to extend its
advantages to the many, and
to limit the action of those who
would monopolise that wealth.”
c


IX.
CATHOLIC AND PROTESTANT UNITY.
Referring to Irish affairs, I
remarked that a prominent
statesman had written to me
to the effect that Home Rule
would be a message of peace
not only to Ireland, but to the
people in the British colonies.
“ The people are already
united here,” remarked his
Eminence, ‘‘with the exception
of those who are known as the
Orange body; but they are
very few. The Catholics and
Protestants in all political,
social, and philanthropic move-
ments are most peacefully


united, and I am happy to see
that our leading- Catholics show
anxiety to promote that happy
concord. I don’t think the
Home Rule question will affect
these relations in any way.
The great majority of our
Protestant citizens have as
keen a sympathy with justice
to Ireland as any of our Catho-
lic citizens.”
He does not think it pro-
bable that the Irish-Australian
native will ever lose interest in
Ireland.
“ As a matter of fact,” he
said, “the Irish-Australians are
as enthusiastic as the most
ardent lovers of Ireland that
have come* direct from the


mother-country. A greatmany
of them are well instructed re-
garding the past history of
the country. They know the
wrongs that Ireland has
suffered, and they rejoice that
at the present day there is
such public sentiment through-
out Great Britain with the
efforts to redress those wrongs.”


X.
THOSE WHO WAR AGAINST THE
CHURCH.
Talking of the “ A.P.A,” an
association which has lately
arisen in America with the
object of protecting the State
against the influence of Rome,
his Eminence said :
“We have quite a different
class of people here from those
who make war against the
Church in the United States.
The United States for many
years received not only very
many excellent citizens, but,
against her will, a great deal
O 7 ©


of the social scum of Europe.
When the various revolutions
were put down, in ’4B and ’49,
the enemies of all society and
of all religion made their way
in thousands to America, and
ever since the scum of society in
Italy, France, in Belgium, and
in Germany, not to say Great
Britain, have endeavoured to
plot against* the Church in
remote parts of America. It
is fully verified in them what
one of the old writers says—
‘ You may change your sky,
but your principles and your
dishonesty will remain the
same.’ But here in Australia
we have the advantage. We
are too far away from the home


countries for many such men
to find their way hither, and
we have a strong Government
to deal with those scoundrels.
I am happy to say that our
Catholics dissociate themselves
entirely from such men.”


XI.
THE POSITION OF THE PROTESTANT
CHURCH.
Before leaving, I asked Car-
dinal Moran what he thought
of religious sentirfient in Aus-
tralia.
“ Undoubtedly in the Pro-
testant Church, with its various
denominations,” he said, “there
is a general feeling of indiffer-
ence. Some leading Protes-
tants, holding responsible places
of trust in their respective
churches, in conversation with
myself, showed that they had
no sympathy whatever with the
distinct doctrines of the Angli-
can constitution, for instance


with the Divinity of our Blessed
Lord. They are merely Pro-
testants, which is a very con-
venient name for designating
a fashionable style of religion,
but beyond the name, a great
many of them have very little
knowledge of Protestanism,and
little sympathy with its teach-
ino\ That indifference has
o
made no headway whatever in
our Catholic body. Our Catho-
lic clergy and people are most
perfectly united, and the Catho-
lic body, as a rule, by their
splendid sacrifice in the cause
of religion, education, and
charity, have shown their
earnestness for, and devotion
to, the faith they profess.”


XII.
THE SECRET OF CATHOLIC
PROGRESS.
“ Speaking of these sacri-
fices,” I said, “ the Primate
recently remarked to me, in
the course of an interview,
that their explanation would
be found in the fact that the
Anglican Church did not bring
spiritual pressure to bear in
the same way. This pressure
is taken as an explanation of
the material advancement of
the Church.”
His Eminence smiled.
“ Well, no spiritual pressure is
brought to bear on the people,”


he said. “ The advancement
is due to their own union with
their pastors, and their own
desire to promote religion and
the various duties of charity
and education which are linked
with religion. I would con-
sider that the sufferings of the
Catholics for the faith in Aus-
tralia in the first 50 years of
the colony has had a great
deal to do with the present
marvellous spirit of religion
and sacrifices in upholding every
interest of religion. In this 50
years to which I have referred,
the priests were true martyrs
and confessors of the faith, and
many a leading Protestant still
living has spoken to me in


admiration of the devotedness
shown by them in ministering
to their flocks, in spite of the
difficulties which then hindered
the ministry. The Catholic
feeling of the people could not
but correspond to that heroism
and devotedness on the part of
the clergy, and hence, with the
clergy and their flocks truly
united, we look with confidence
to the future.”


FEDERATION OR
REVOLUTION?


XIII.
FEDERATION OR REVOLU-
TION?
TOURING my interview with
Cardinal Moran, he ex-
pressed very strong views on
the subj ect of federation. These
views he emphasised with even
greater force in another con-
versation I had with him a day
or two ago at St. Mary’s
“ I am convinced,” he said,
“ that all our bishops and the
great majority of our clergy,
in a spirit of patriotism, look
forward to the federation of
the colonies as a matter of
vital importance, and one which
no political party can very long


ignore. I know that at present
many political leaders pooh
pooh the question, and say the
people take no interest in it.
But so far as I can judge of
the opinion of our people,
particularly in New South
Wales, I consider that federa-
tion must come, and if not
achieved by our political leaders,
it will come as a matter of
revolution.”
“ A peaceful revolution,” I
interjected.
“ I mean by revolution,” he
continued, in an emphatic tone,
“ the determination of the
people to assert their rights ;
and, of course, under such a
republican constitution as we


enjoy here, they must achieve
those results. I say we enjoy
a republican constitution. I
regard our colonial Administra-
tion, linked as it is to the
Crown of Great Britain, as the
most perfect form of republican
government. It has all the
freedom which a republican
government imparts, and it is
free from the many unpleasant
influences to which, as in the
United States, an elected head
of a republic is subject.”


XIV.
THE QUESTION OF INDEPENDENCE.
After relating how, in Con-
servative circles in England,
Australian federation.is looked
upon with disapproval, because
it is believed that federation
would lead to separation, he
said: —
“ X don’t think the question
of separation will be promoted
by federation. On the con-
trary, I think that when the
colonies are federated the con-
nection will be strengthened,
for the full liberty which we
shall then enjoy will satisfy all
our aspirations. Separation
D


from the mother-country would
deprive us of many material
advantages. We are protected
along our coasts and in our
commerce by the British navy.
There is no country in the
world enjoys such domestic
peace as Australia does. We
are not afraid of any invasion.
We have no home enemy to
disturb us, and yet we have no
standing army. A handful of
police and military suffices for
all our requirements. That is
a condition of things that could
scarcely be maintained if the
bonds of union with the Empire
were severed.
“But the present relations of
the colonies to one another are


quite intolerable. The interests
of the people are the same ;
their aspirations the same.
Very often members of tl>e
same family live in different
colonies, and still the frontiers
between these colonies are in
many ways an impassable
barrier to that union and
mutual sympathy which should
characterise the people, and
which the people are deter-
mined to have.”
“ Your ideas are not Im-
perialistic,” I said.
“ No,” he replied. “ I have
always opposed what is called
Imperial Federation. That
would lead to interminable con-
fusion in the colonies. But I


have publicly stated that I
consider the question of Aus-
tralian federation not only a
question of urgent political im-
portance, but a question also of
patriotism. I wish to be asso-
ciated with the people as an
enthusiast in promoting it in
every way in my power.”


XV.
WHAT FEDERATION MEANS.
“I consider that the progress
of the country, the develop-
ment of her resources, and the
influence which Australia must
exercise on other countries,
must depend in a great measure
upon the friendly federation of
the colonies.
“ The example of Canada is
one that should put this ques-
tion in its true light. When
the Canadian colonies were
distinct and had conflicting
laws, the name of Canada was
almost unknown in home
politics, and Canada exercised


no influence whatever on other
countries. Since the federation
of the Canadian Dominion, her
resources have wonderfully
developed. The railways and
the lines of steamships connect-
ing her with other countries
fill with astonishment even
some of the financiers of the
most ad van ced European States.
“ The same must happen in
Australia. We need great
trunk railways to open up the
resources of the interior of the
country, and we need com-
mercial alliance with all the
countries that surround us. It
is only a federated Australia
that can achieve this.”


XVI.
THE PROSPECTS OF A REPUBLIC.
Talking of the prospects of
a republic, his Eminence said
that probably a republic would
not be set up within 50 or 100
years.
“America is a great country,”
he added. “No one with the
sense of the advance of modern
times can refuse the United
States a great measure of
praise, and her separation from
Great Britain was undoubtedly
favourable to that progress.
But the relations of Great
Britain to her polonies have
greatly changed during the past


100 years. As regards the
future separation of Australia
from the Empire, it is all a mere
matter of interest. If ever it
becomes of interest to Austra-
lia to be an independent State,
thepolitical leaders will effect the
separation, and England would
offer very little opposition to
it. But all our interests at the
present day, and for 50 years
at least, point rather to a closer
union with the Empire.”
“ I should think,” I said,
“that sentiment will have more
to do with the union than
interest.”
“Journalists,” replied the
Cardinal, “ write a great deal
about sentiment, and it un


doubtedly influences those who
were born in England, and
have made their home in Aus-
tralia. But among the native
Australians, whether of Irish
or British descent, I consider
sentiment has but little in-
fluence over their opinions. I
consider that interest is their
only bond with the Empire.
Of course, with Catholics, their
religious duty adds strength to
this bond; but for the great
mass of the people, interest is
the only bond that links us
with the home country.”

The Company’s fleet consists of the steamships
“ Airlee,” “Guthrie,” “Menmuir,” and “ Cat-
terthun,” which are fitted up with every requisite
for a voyage through tropical climes.
Yearly Excursion Trips are now run, and the
steamers are despatched early in March for China
and Japan, where sufficient time is afforded
passengers to give them an opportunity of seeing
the beautiful sights of these Wonder Lands.
Messrs. Thomas Cook & Sons usually conduct a
tour in connection with these Excursions.
