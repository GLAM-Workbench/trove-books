INTRODUCTION.
In submitting this pamphlet, the Pastoral tenants of the Crown would respect-
fully urge that their claims for consideration may be calmly and dispas-
sionately discussed. They cannot discover any necessity for the arbitrary
clauses which are included in the new Land Bill, nor do they believe that it
is advisable to ruin them, and sacrifice the public estate, by an indiscriminate
system of uncalled for selection. Nearly all the best land in the colony has
been alienated from their runs, either by sale, selection, or commonage, and in
virtue of this undisputed fact, they ask that reasonable protection for the
remaining portions may be accorded to them.
They submit that they represent one of the greatest interests of the colony,
and one with which its prosperity is intimately identified ; also that they are
justly entitled to a share of that fostering care and protection which has bee�
so liberally bestowed on industries of lesser importance. They also claim
this protection on the ground that they have a right to long and undisturbed
leases by virtue of the Order in Council, issued by Her Majesty the Queen,
on the 9th day of March, 1847; by the high rentals they are paying, and by
the many millions sterling which they have expended in improving the
property of the State. They have further the equitable right acquired by thirty-
three years of beneficial occupation, and their position, as occupiers of the
public estate, bears a close analogy to that of the claimants of tenant right in
Ireland. There is, however, this difference between them and the Irish
tenants, that whereas the latter have always paid a reasonable rental, the
pastoral tenants have been rack-rented, and rack-rented again, the sum total
they are now paying, being, in many instances, shamefully excessive, when
the immense area of good land which-has been alienated from their runs,
and the decline in value of wool and stock, is taken into account.


It is generally admitted that nearly all the agricultural land has now been
taken from the stations, and that the land which remains, is for the most part
of very inferior quality, and quite unsuitable for cultivation.
When this is taken into consideration, it will become evident that not only
have the choicest lands been alienated, but that in consequence thereof, the
resources of Victoria, as a borrower of capital for the construction of rail-
ways and other public works, have been seriously curtailed, simply because
a large proportion of the most tangible description of security which could
have been offered, is no longer the property of the State. In short, it is but
too true that, in order to gratify the popular idea that before a country can
become prosperous, its inhabitants must become cultivators of the soil, the
best lands of the colony have passed from the Crown for a mere tithe of
their value.
The production of cereals has been forced to an excess which is far in
advance of the requirements of the population, and the suggestive fact
that no fewer than 4,204 farmers and selectors have signed the peti-
tions on behalf of the pastoral tenants, proves that the thirst for land has
been fully appeased.
It will be found on reference to the analysis of the 37,695 signatures
which have been obtained to the petitions, that the intellect and
social standing of the inhabitants of the colony is very largely represented.
Men of all grades, ranks, and professions, have appended their signatures;
thus clearly evidencing an almost unanimous feeling that the claims
which are advanced are entitled to the fullest and most liberal adjustment.
Melbourne,
September 9, 1869.


PEOPOSED AMENDMENTS OP TIE PETITIONS
OF THE
? Council &
PROPOSED ALTERATION OF RENTALS AND OTHER AMEND-
MENTS OF THE NEW LAND BILL, IN ORDER TO MAKE
IT MORE JUST AND EQUITABLE TOWARDS THE PASTORAL
INTEREST.
n presenting these Petitions, the Pastoral Tenants desire to state that they
are prepared to pay higher rentals than those which are named in the prayer,
providing reasonable tenure can he granted in order to admit of the various
stations being worked economically. They would point out that unless this
tenure is given, they will he liable to have their sheep and cattle paddocks con-
tmually interfered with by the alienation of the most valuable portions of their
runs; and they will thus not only he put to great loss through the selection of
tneir fences, &c., but also in removing or constructing new improvements, and
they will further often he compelled to sell their stock at a great sacrifice,
owing to the diminished grazing capabilities of their stations, through
continuous and narrassing selection and commonage.
The great losses which must arise from this system will bo at once evident,
is, therefore, submitted that if reasonable protection is afforded, the
lessees of the best stations are willing to pay 6d per sheep, and the lessees
of the inferior to average stations 2d to 4d per sheep, these rates being, so
ar as regards average to good stations, Id to 2d per head' over those which are
named in the petition ; in fact, they would amount to very nearly the rentals
which are at present exacted. In the Riverine district of New South Wales
the stations have, after careful valuations, been appraised at rentals which
amount to an average rate of about 2d per sheep, and the station owners there
have excellent grazing country, with large reservations for their special pro-
teetion. It is almost unnecessary to state, that for breeding or fattening
qualities, the Riverma stations are much superior to those of this colony, and
t ey have the additional advantage of a railway to the boundary of the
colony, constructed by Victoria. So far as cattle stations are concerned, they
are of opinion that the rents should not be higher than those which are
named in the 1 etitions, because the inferior country which remains in their
occupation is only adapted for breeding purposes.
Ihe reservations which the pastoral tenants desire to be made, in order
to save them from ruin, and enable them to pay these rentals, are as
follows: ? Absolute reservation from either selection or commonage
for land situate within one mile of homesteads where no pre-emptive section
.? ,o ,*r rl granted; within one mile of pre-emptive sections, within one
mile of wool-sheds, sheepwashes, reservoirs, tanks, dams, or wells which shall
have been constructed prior to the passing of the Land Bill now under
discussion, also within half a mile of well-established cattle yards. Reserva-
tions should also be made of one mile out of each two and a half miles of
rivei 01 creek frontage, in order to secure access to same for stock from the
? a � ft will he admitted that in asking for these reserves there
is nothing unreasonable.


They also ask that compensation shall he paid hy the selector of any land
to the owner of any valuable improvements which may have been made on
the land prior to the passing of the New Land Bill. These improvements to
include fences, huts, and yards, and the amount of this compensation to he
fixed hy arbitration. , . .... ,
In thus agreeing to pay higher rentals than are asked in the petition, tne
Pastoral Tenants wish to point out that the proposed mode of fixing those
rentals is very unfair to them. Under the new hill, the Board of Land and
Works will fix the rental, and their decision will he final. By the operation
of this mode of fixing rentals, doubtless many unjust decisions will through
io-norance he made, and for this reason the settlers desire to express their
disapproval of it. In their opinion, the only fair way of fixing and adjusting
the rentals is hy the decision of properly qualified valuators, one to he
appointed hy the Board of Land and Works, and one hy the owner of the
run. In case of dispute, these valuators to elect an umpire, whose decision
shall he final. , . ? , ~
The Pastoral Tenants are also willing that a substantial log tence shall
he constructed round selections, instead of post and rail }> or wire, as
mentioned in the Petition, several of the selectors who have signed having
pointed out that a log fence is much cheaper, and more in accordance with
their means. This fence to he made sheep and cattle proof. _
The Pastoral Tenants are of opinion that, as the construction of a fence
before placing on stock will involve delay, the selectors should he allowed to
have their selections rent free during the construction of the said fence,
providing the term does not exceed twelve months.
This will prove liow willingly the Pastoral Tenants and selectors are
working together. . , - _
The Pastoral Tenants also desire to submit that the penalty of os per acre
imposed in clause 90 for nonfulfilment of conditions of improvement on
certificate lands, is excessive ; and that, in the present deeply distressed state
of the pastoral interest, it would he absolutely ruinous to many. And that
as a very large number of the wealthy certificate holders have paid up the
purchase-money and obtained their Crown grants without having effected
any improvement whatever, a substantial injustice would be inflicted on those
who, from want of means, have been unable to pay off the balance of the
purchase-money; because, in such cases, those who were best able to have
effected the improvements will escape altogether, whilst the penalty will fall
only upon those who, however willing, were really unable to make the-
payments before they became due.
THE NEW LAND BILL.
The following is a list of clauses which the Pastoral Tenants respectfully
submit ought to be altered or amended if their operations are to be conducted
with any regard to either safety or tenure.
First,? the interpretation clause, which states that?
? The word ? allotment, 5 whenever the same is used in this Act shall be taken
to mean a quantity of land not exceeding six hundred and forty acres and not
embracing more than one half-mile of frontage and like in proportion for a
lesser area to any lake lagoon river stream or watercourse forming a
boundary of such allotment measured in a right line from one extreme point
of the same to the other and which shall be applied for by any applicant
for a license under this Act whether the same may be surveyed or unsurveyed
Crown lands.? 5


Clause 19, part 3. A condition that the licensee shall within two years
from the issue of such license enclose the land described in such license with
a f?�d and substantial fence; and shall during the currency of such license
cultivate at least one acre out of every ten acres thereof.?
? Clause 62. The Governor shall issue to the persons who shall at the time
of the passing of this Act be in the licensed occupation of runs for pastoral
purposes and the executors administrators and assigns of such persons yearly
licenses to occupy such runs for pastoral purposes; but no such license heretofore
or hereafter to he issued shall be deemed to prevent such run or any part thereof
from being sold based or licensed under any of the preceding Parts of this Act
proclaimed a common or occupied by virtue of any miner?s right or business
license or any license for other than pastoral purposes, or from being otherwise
alienated or dealt with under the authority of this or any other Act now or here-
after to he m force.
, l *9 la V se f 3, F rom and after the first of January one thousand eight
hundred and seventy-one the rent to be paid by every such licensee for his
run shall be at the rate of Eightpence for every sheep or Four Shillings for
every head of cattle which it shall be determined to be capable of carrying
y the Board. Provided that the said rate shall be re-adjusted by Parlia-
ment upon the expiration of five years from the passing hereof. Provided
further that until the thirty-first day of December One thousand eight
hundred and seventy the rent to be paid by every licensee for pastoral
occupation shall be determined by the Board, and paid and payment thereof
e w� Ced ln the samo manner aB . if this Act had not been passed.?
. j, Whenever a penalty has been incurred by any person under the one
hundred and twenty-sixth section of ? The Land Act 1862 ? or the
seventh section of ? The Amending Land Act 1865 ? it shall be lawful for the
Governor to demand and receive the amount of such penalty in addition to
the purchase-money before issuing a Crown grant of any allotment in
respect of which such penalty has accrued to such person or his assignee :
Provided that no Crown grant of any such allotment shall he issued unless
the person applying for such grant shall have proved to the satisfaction of the
Board to be certified under its seal that the provisions of the thirty-sixth
� f ,^ ct No - 145 or the sev enth section of ? The-Amending Land Act
1865 as the case may be have been fully complied with in respect of such
allotment or m default of such certificate shall have paid a penalty at the
rate of five shillings for every acre of such allotment.?
To any one at all acquainted with pastoral pursuits, it is clear that under
these clauses the Ministry of the day will have power, at any moment, and
without any appeal or practical responsibility, to ruin any individual tenant
ot tne Crown or, at their pleasure, the tenants of a whole district, or the
entire pastoral interest. By these clauses security of tenure, the only real basis
of improvementand prosperity is entirely destroyed. The extraordinarymanner
in which the 42nd clause of the present bill has been interpreted, is sufficient
evidence of the construction which Ministers can adopt to suit their purposes


COPY OF PETITION.
To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the Legislative
Assembly.
The humble petition of the undersigned persons who are interested in station
property, or who desire that consideration should he extended to the pastoral
tenants of the Crown,
Humbly sheweth that,
Your petitioners would beg to bring under your notice the great depreciation
in value of station property, and the many difficulties with which the Pastoral
Tenants have to contend in consequence of the serious decline in prices of wool
and sheep.
Your petitioners would submit to your consideration the well-known fact
that during the past three years wool has sustained a reduction in value
of from thirty-five to forty per cent., and that sheep have also declined in
value to the extent of at least fifty per cent, on the average, during the same
period.
Your petitioners also beg to urge that in addition to these misfortunes,
the pastoral tenants have had to contend with severe droughts and bush
fires, and in other respects also have sustained much loss.
In consideration of these disasters your Assembly has been graciously
pleased to extend large concessions to those persons who have selected land
under the amending Act of 1865, and the pastoral tenants of the Crown
bog that you will also in a similar manner extend consideration to them.
They humbly submit their claims as colonists and pioneers of settlement,
and would respectfully refer to the enormous sums which have been expended
by them in improving the Crown Lands of the colony.
They would also beg to point out to you that nearly all the choice lands
have been alienated from their stations by selection, purchase and commonage,
and that they have not obstructed settlement under the various Land Acts;
although numerous instances of much hardship have occurred in consequence.
Your petitioners beg to submit that the present rentals of stations are far
in excess of their value. In 1862, when wool and sheep were realising very
high prices, and the stations included several millions of acres of choice
lands which have since been alienated, a rental of 8d per sheep, and 2s per
head of cattle, amounting in the aggregate to �208,930 per annum was
deemed sufficient; this rental having been fixed by the Government after
careful valuations.
The present rentals amount to �177,643 sterling per annum, so that it will
be clearly evident to your honourable House that taking into consideration
the great decline in value of pastoral produce, and the fact that 7,458,915
acres of the choicest land have been alienated from the stations since the
Ist of January, 1862, the rents exacted are grievously oppressive. They
would submit to you that the lands which have been alienated from the runs
far exceed, in annual value, those which remain.
You petitioners view with alarm that clause in the new Land Bill which
proposes to appraise the rentals of the various stations at 8d per sheep, and
they would submit to you that it is not possible for them to contend
against their many difficulties if this exorbitant rent is exacted from them.
They would humbly submit to you that 4d per sheep is the highest rental
which the best stations can at present possibly afford to pay, and that
probably half the stations in the colony cannot bo worked to advantage at
more than 2d per sheep. They would urge on your consideration that the


rentals be fixed at rates varying from 2d. to 4d per head, according to the
description of country, its grazing capabilities, distance from market, or
expense of management.
Your petitioners would also beg to remind you that it is proposed to
appraise the rentals of cattle stations at the rate of four shillings per head.
This your petitioners beg to submit is far in excess of the annual value of
those stations, and they pray that you will cause this rental to be reduced to
from one shilling to two shillings per head, according to the description and
value of the country on which the cattle are depastured. It is humbly
submitted that the area of fattening country is now so very limited, that
owners of even the best cattle stations cannot afford to pay a higher rental
than 2s per head.
Your petitioners would further beg to draw your attention to the great
losses the pastoral tenants will sustain if the proposed system of selection
is adopted. They do not, however, object to this if reasonable precautions
are taken to ensure the bona fides of each selector, and also to prevent the
spread of scab, which disease is increasing to an alarming extent. They
are of that in order to prevent the spread of this disease, and as a
protection against fraud each selector should erect 8P substantial post and rail
or wire fence round his selection before bringing his stock on the land.
They humbly submit that the adoption of this course will be the best test
of the good faith of the selectors, and that it will act as a safeguard and
protection to the bona fide settler against unprincipled persons who may
desire to take up land for purposes of extortion. It is suggested that this
will not act prejudicially against the selectors, because they must necessarily
fence the land before commencing to stock or cultivate it.
Your petitioners would further humbly submit to your honourable House
that some compensation should be allowed to the pastoral tenants, if the
valuable improvements they have erected are taken from them. They beg
to point out to you that millions sterling have been expended in the erection
of these improvements, and that it will be a great hardship if they are
deprived of them without adequate compensation.
Your petitioners are grateful for the extension of tenure which is proposed
to be accorded to the pastoral tenants in the new Land Bill, but they would
beg to submit to you that this will, in numerous instances, afford but little
assistance in protecting the most important portions of the stations, unless
reserves are made securing from selection certain areas round improvements ;
also, reasonable proportions of water frontage to rivers or creeks. They
would beg to draw your attention to the fact that, without reservations of
this nature, the occupiers of Crown lands will be liable to much hardship,
and probably, in many cases, be compelled to abandon their stations, in
consequence of selections being made which will interfere with the working
of them. �
In conclusion, your petitioners humbly submit their cause for your decision y
and your petitioners will ever pray, &c.

APPENDIX
CONTAINING
LETTEES ON THE SQUATTING QUESTION.


The following letters form portions of many which the author
of this Pamphlet has addressed to the newspapers, during the
past three months, on the different phases of the Squatting
Question.
They are reprinted here in order that the public generally
may have an opportunity of considering and discussing the
justice of the claims which are advanced by the Pastoral
Tenants.

It will thus he evident that, as compared with 1862, when the existing
rentals fixed- 0d per or 30 per cent, average.
Fat wethers and ewes, 10s each, or 50 ?
Store sheep, Bsr to 12s 6d, or 66 ?


Under these circumstances a corresponding reduction, or, at least, an equitable
adjustment of the rents, is urgently called for, to relieve the great depression
now existing. It is matter of fact that many owners of runs are working at
a loss, the returns from their stations being insufficient to pay the actual
expenses. They have, however, continued to occupy most of their properties
tt� �- f eithe j obtami , n g a reduction of the rent, or being able to effect
a sale, -having made valuable improvements and stocked their runs, they
cannot altogether abandon them.
Taking the above facts into consideration, it must be clear that if the rents
ot runs were fixed by fair arbitration in 1862, on the basis of the then exist-
ing value of station property, wool, and sheep, they ought now to be reduced
m proportion viz., to the extent of nearly 50 per cent.?which is the average
decline in value of station property and produce.
A sufficient rental for any station would now be?
-4d each for sheep
Is Gd ? cattle
Is Gd ? horses.
The principle of fixing the rental of runs in proportion to the stock depastured
is unfair, for the simple reason that the capital of the settlers expended in
improvements has, in many instances, increased the grazing capabilities of
t0 f tbe ext . ent � f . 10 � P er cent.; in fact, more than doubled their
capacity for earming stock. Is it just that the Government should take the
advantage of these improvements, and compel the settlers to pay interest on
tneir own capital ? r J
A more equitable mode of fixing the rental to be paid, would be first to
value a station as it stands, and from the total value deduct the value of the
stock and improvements, thus arriving at an estimate of the value of the bare
run, on which alone it is contended that the Government have reasonable
# mg / en ? rhuS ? well a PP� in ted station, at the present
time, in thorough order, fenced in and subdivided, and consisting of purely
pastora! country sound and healthy, and not likely to be disturbed by
selection, would be worth perhaps 15s per head, provide#reasonable tenure was

of te n llure remains to be adjusted on a safe basis for
the high rental indicated; and this could be effected without in any wav
trenching upon the Agricultural land, comparatively little of which now
remains to the Crown tenants. An absolute lease should be given for at
least ten years covering trom interference certain areas round homesteads
woolsheds stock-yards, dams, and water frontages. From one-half to one
mile from the improvements mentioned, should thus bo
secured to the runs in order to ensure their being worked without
interference; and also to prevent unprincipled selectors from taking up land
m inconvenient situations for purposes of extortion or otherwise. If at any
future time the runs are put up to auction for disposal, a fair valuation should
be allowed to the pastoral tenant for all the improvements he has made, such

THE SQUATTING QUESTION.
TO THE EDITOR OP THE ARGUS.
SST?* y� ur Permission, I shall be glad to lay before the public the
qplp 14 f f ex P enence and inquiries in reference to the profits derived from
sheep farming, and also on the squatting question generally. So much
ignorance prevails on the subject, even amongst members of the Legislative
Assembly, as evidenced by their speeches in the House, that it becomes neces
sary that authentic and reliable data should be published, in order to refute
the misstatements that are daily being made.
The letter signed ?Beta,? published in your issue of the 11th inst., furnishes
? lC nSd thl- SIX st f- 10ns ? whicb ? duri ng the past twelve months have not

instance of this, I may give the experience of one of my friends, who owns a

year gives the following result:? *

Or about one quarter percent, interest on his purchase-money. Now the
person referred to is a careful and economical manager, and his station is
enced in and subdivided into paddocks, the various improvements including-
W a a rt^ msitcs on a well-appointed run. The country is sound and
healthy, and there are no exceptional circumstances which would tend to
dimmish his returns. It is tme the season has been unfavorable, and that
owing to the scarcity of grass his sheep have not been in good condition ? still
even taking these drawbacks into account, it must be evident that See the
decline in value of wool and stock, the profits of sheep-farming have been
seriousiy curtaded. The mstance I quote shows a return of a fraction over
2s l B d per fleece, _ which is about the average value this season,?indeed in
many cases within my own knowledge, 2s per fleece is nearer the mark and
I beheve that this latter rate fairly represents the value of fleeces shorn from
sheep depasturing on nine-tenths of the present available Crown lands
Where sheep are fed on rich pastures, like the freehold estates of the Western
district, much higher results are of course attainable, because they have not
only the advantage of abundant feed, but the owners are generally in a posi-
tion to attend to careful hreedmg, with a view of securing heavy fleeces of
superior wool. The Crown tenants are now debarred from�these opportune
ties, because, in the first place, nearly all the best portions of then- imns have
been taken from them by selection, and, in the second place, because thefr
tenure of the remainder is so very insecure that there is no inducement to
invest the requisite capital. # ULIO
~ The facts I have adduced will tend to dispel that illusion with respect to
the golden fleece which is prevalent in the minds of those who are not practi-
cally acquainted with the subject, and I will now refer to the profits the
denVeS f f�? w� f bls sur P lus st �ck. A large proportion
of the stations in certain districts never have any surplus stock, simply


because tbe lambings are than sufficient to cover the mortality arising
from disease and dry seasons. Those stations which do, in ordinary years,
give a reasonable increase, may be divided into two classes?breeding runs
and fattening runs. There are very few of the latter description in Victoria,
because all the richest lands have been alienated; indeed, I question if there
are a dozen stations in the colony which could send a draft of fat sheep to
market, the inferior land remaining to the occupants and the almost
universal system of overstocking, preventing any chance of securing carcases
for the butcher. It therefore follows that, in the great majority of instances,
only store sheep could be sold, and the prices obtainable for these, taking an
average of the year, range from 3s to 5s each, for good stock. Inferior uud
old sheep are almost unsaleable, and no relative value can be quoted, although
probably Is to 2s 6d each, according to length of wool, would be a fair price
to name. _ .. , ~
The expenses of working a station vary so much, according to the quality
and description of country, that it is difficult to arrive at an exact estimate ;
but, talking an average of the present runs, about �9O per 1,000 sheep would
be nearly correct. Where the country is open, a large station might be
managed for a less sum ; but, on the other hand, where, as in the case of most
of the stations, there is hilly, barren, scrubby, or dry country, and last?not
least?selectors to attend to and conciliate, the expenses are undoubtedly
higher. These calculations of receipts and expenditure will assist in enabling
a fair estimate to be formed ; and when the extortionate rent proposed to be
enforced is added, it will be evident that the modicum of profit derived from
squatting is small indeed. I have not mentioned the possible contingency of a
dry season, with its disastrous consequences ; but I may state, that during one
year out of probably each three years, the chances of bad lambings and scanty
feed must be provided for.
I regret to notice that a general impression seems to prevail among those
who are not immediately acquainted with squatting pursuits, that the system
of management on most stations is careless and extravagant. It is continually
pointed out by these individuals that the public lands are not being put to
their best use, and that the advent of the free selector is urgently needed in
order to put an end to the existing order of things. Now, what are the facts.
Why, I will venture to assert that in no department of industry in these
colonies is so much rigid and persevering economy exercised, at the
same time enormous sums are continually being expended in improving the
Crown lands, in order to enable them to depasture more stock. In many
cases, however, it is utterly impossible to curtail expenses below a certain
limit, owing to the thousands of swagmen, who, during the greater portion of
the year, roam about the country, ostensibly in search of employment, but
often for the mere pleasure of leading a lazy idle life, at the expense or the
squatters. These men arrive at a station at sundown, and expect supper, bed,
and breakfast as their birthright, and this, he it stated to the credit of the
despised Crown tenants, is seldom or never refused. The cost of maintaining
these hungry wanderers forms a most serious item in the expenses of a station,
and the squatters seldom receive credit or gratitude for their kindness ;in fact,
probably some of the very men who have experienced their hospitality are the
first to injure them. As an instance of the tax which this wholesale system
of gratuitous hoard and lodging entails on the settlers, I may mention that at
one station in the Wimmera district, where I spent an evening, thirty-six
travellers were accommodated that night, and I was told that this was not an
unusual number; indeed, on adjoining runs, as many as fifty to sixty men per
night had been provided for.
The losses and difficulties with which the pastoral tenants have to contend
do not in any respect enlist sympathy; on the contrary, their very misfortunes
would seem to furnish additional motives for crushing them. Contrast this with


the treatment the selector receives. I have before me a copy of a petition, signed
by sixty-eight occupiers of selected land in and near the district of Colac,
praying that, in consideration of the continued depreciation in the price of
wool, stock, and dairy produce, and the bush fires which have visited their
district for three years in succession, some concession may be made to them in
the new Land Bill. To this and similar representations the Government pro-
pose to respond by granting an extension of ten years for payment of the pur-
chase money for their selections. Now, precisely the same casualties apply
with equal force to the pastoral tenants; but how does the Government extend
a helping hand to them ? Why, by threatening to drive them from their
stations, taking the best portions away from them, and increasing their rents.
Yet I fail to discover that the squatters have committed any crimes
than causing mutton to be retailed at a penny per pound, overstocking the
European markets with wool, feeding thousands of swagmen, and expending
millions sterling in making otherwise useless lands of the colony available for
depasturing purposes. It is true none of these offences can be charged to
the selectors as yet, but possibly in after years they may be found equally
guilty.
In the debates on the land question, I have noted a continual desire on the
part of a certain section of honourable members that the squatters should be
compelled to pay a fair rental for their runs. The precise figure which these
gentlemen would consider a fair rental, is indeed a mystery to me, and
probably, is so to themselves ; for I cannot conceive how they are to know the
value of station property better than the holders. The rentals are already
far too excessive, and the attempt to increase them will, no doubt, have the
effect of causing many stations to be abandoned. I quite admit that the
selectors are paying 2s per acre rent, and I maintain that the choice lands
they have secured are better worth that rate than the remaining Crown lands
are worth one-twentieth part of it. The public appear to lose sight of the
fact that the selections made comprise the very cream of the runs, and that
the loss of those portions renders the remainder of many of the stations
almost worthless for grazing purposes, a large proportion being barren
ranges, scrub, and heath. Again, I complain that the Government
object to allow a fair reduction of rent for the portions so
taken away, and even in cases where they take the question
into consideration, the allowance made is generally according to the number
of acres alienated, without reference to the quality of those acres. This is
obviously unfair, for the acres which have been selected may, taking acre for
acre, be worth ten times as much to the run as those which remain. This,
however, only serves to further illustrate the leading principle of ? Down
with the Squatters.? One member of the Assembly pointed out that no less
than 212 runs are held by twenty gentlemen or firms. If he has ever
occupied the responsible position of mortgagor or mortgagee, he must be
aware that it is the general custom to take security for advances made, and
hence the transfers of licenses in the cases alluded to. This gentleman pro-
ceeded to state that it was not sheep that would pay the colony, but an
industrious and frugal population. Will he point out how the industrious
and frugal population alluded to propose to utilise the Crown lands ? If it is
for cultivation instead of grazing, only one result can follow, viz., the ruin
and starvation of the cultivators. Another honourable member stated that
the opening up of the country by selectors would lead to the clearing of the
Malice Scrub. If he has ever seen the scrub referred to, he will no doubt be
willing to admit that such a desirable consummation is as yet somewhat
remote.
Another instance of the erroneous impressions which prevail is furnished
in your issue of this date. It is there stated that manager of a largo
freehold pastoral estate, being about to leave his situation, desires to form a


station on the adjoining Crown lands, and he laments that the proposed grant-
ing of further tenure to the squatters will prevent him having the opportunity
of doing so. He expresses his willingness to pay Is per acre rent, and regrets
that he is thus debarred from becoming a squatter. I can scarcely believe
that this letter is genuine, because a person who has held such a situation as
he mentions, would know that there are numbers of stations now in the
market, stocked, and with complete improvements, which he can purchase for
less outlay than would be required to stock and render available the Crown
lands to which he refers. His offer of a rental of Is per acre may, in the
opinion of some of our more enthusiastic anti-squatters, furnish conclusive
evidence that all Crown lands are worth that figure, whereas he no doubt
wishes to choose the most valuable portion of the station referred to.
I would also draw attention to another instance of the one-sided policy
pursued by the Government in their new Land Bill. At present a squatter can
only purchase land by public auction, and from cases with which I am familiar,
I believe the average cost of land secured in that way during the past year,
has been about �1 16s per acre. Now, compare this with the mode of purchase
intended to be opened to the selector. For the purpose of explaining the
argument, I will suppose a squatter buys one acre of land at auction for
�1 15s cash. The interest on that �1 15s, calculated for thirteen years
at 10 per cent., or 3s 6d per annum, is �2 6s 6d per acre, so
that the land at the end of thirteen years costs him, interest included,
�4 Os 6d per acre. The selector is to be allowed the right of securing
land anywhere, no matter whether its value be �1 or �lO per acre,
for thirteen yearly payments of 2s each, making a total of �1 6s, thus showing
a clear difference of �2 14s 6d per acre against the squatter, even on land
worth only �1 15s per acre. Now, I know instances where selectors have
secured lands which, had they been put up to public competition, would have
realised from �5 to �lO per acre. Let us see what amount is thus lost to the
State by the wisdom of our Legislators and Government. Take an acre of
land at the medium rate between the two quotations given, that is,
�7 10s per acre.
Add interest the Government would have gained at
their debenture rate of 6 per cent, per annum, say 9s
per annum for thirteen years .. .. �5 17 0
Total cost per acre if bought by the squatter
Deduct the price paid by the selector
..�l3 7 0
�l6 0
Showing a clear loss of .. .. .. ~ �l2 1 0 per acre
by the system of selection.
I quite admit that the selector must expend �1 per acre in improvements,
but in order to make use of the land, he would necessarily have to expend
fully this sum. Even the obnoxious squatter cannot use the land without
making certain improvements, such as fencing, &c., &c. It is thus evident
that in order to carry out the desire to foster and artificially support a sub-
sidiary interest, the property of the State is sacrificed, and one of our greatest
sources of wealth is sought to be destroyed.
In conclusion, I may be permitted to state that, in my humble opinion, the
great bulk of the lands now occupied by the squatters cannot be applied _to
better use, and the eviction of the present holders can only lead to the creation
of an obstructive class in their places. This class would probably have well-
defined rights and privileges, and consequently would be in a position to
effectually retard the settlement of the country.

THE SQUATTING QUESTION.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS.
Sir, ?My attention has been directed to several paragraphs hearing on the
above question which have appeared in your columns during the past few days.
Had you not thought proper to copy them from the various country papers in
which they were first published, no further notice need have been taken
of them; and I can only regret that your desire to reflect the opinions of the
press in an impartial manner should have induced you to give them space in
the Argus . The fact of your doing so gives these effusions a character and
prestige they would not otherwise attain, and thus it becomes necessary to ex-
pose the absurd deductions arrived at by the writers. With your permission,
I will first refer to an extract from a Gipps Land paper, published in your
issue of the 21st inst. After giving effect to his distorted views on the pro-
posed new Land Bill, the writer finally finds expression for his feelings in the
following graphic language:?
The selectors have a right to see that their interests are not sacrificed to the
banks, of which the squatters are only the tools, and whose foreign proprietary are
striving to clutch the fee simple of the colony. I and my fellow selectors are not
to be bamboozled by the cry of squatters in distress.
The foreign shareholders of the banks will doubtless for the future retire
into obscurity, now that their nefarious designs have been exposed; and as for
the selectors being ?bamboozled,? I think it would, indeed, be difficult to
trick them, as the writer has probably already found out to his cost. lam
inclined to doubt that this man is a selector, for it is certain that if he were,
he would ere this have learned that the Government propose to extend the
operation of the 42nd clause throughout the country irrespective of any rights
which the squatters may desire to advance. Were it not that there are
people in the colony credulous enough to believe such vapid nonsense, I would
not take the trouble to question his statements.
Another paragraph appears in the same issue, bearing on the sub-division
of the runs. It is proper to state that this is from a Deniliquin paper, and the
writer has evidently not had recent practical experience of the expenses and
returns of small stations. A reference to the various letters published in your
columns during the past few weeks is a sufficient answer to his arguments, for
it is clearly proved that small runs do not pay, unless under exceptional cir-
cumstances. A subdivision of the runs would ruin the present occupants, and
doubtless their successors also ; indeed, the adoption of such an extreme and
unnecessary course would be both arbitrary and unjust.
The third paragraph is extracted from a paper published not a hundred
iniles from Avoca, and the writer?s opinions are couched in warlike sentences.
After stating that Mr. Grant has hitherto been a ? Bayard in politics, sans
peur et sans reproche? he proceeds to say that ? the New Land Bill is a huge
piece of legislative armour, intended to be protective of the interests of
the squatters for a further period of ten years.? One?s first impression on
gaining breath after this' glorious news is, that the bugbear termed selection is
an idle dream. Let the squatters cheer up, for according to the statement in
question, there are crumbs of comfort in store for them, and once the bill is
passed there will be no more selection. Unfortunately for the writer?s asser-
tion, it is but too true that the new bill provides for indiscriminate free selec-
tion, and it is, therefore, only proper to point out to the editor of the news-
paper in question that his statement is based on fallacious grounds. The armour
is, after all, only pasteboard, not steel; and doubtless it will speedily be
smashed when the extension of the 42nd clause comes into operation, the


unfortunate men who have attempted to shield themselves within it being at
once placed hors de combat. _ .
The fourth paragraph deserves special mention. It appears m your issue
of the 24th inst., and is taken from a paper published not fifty miles from
Maryborough. The figures brought forward are so colossal in their magni-
tude the calculations are so minutely correct, and withal striking, even to
the most superficial observer, that, at the risk of trespassing too much on
your space, I beg that you will allow me to give it in extenso:?
The squatters occupy 27,000,000 acres, or more than half the entire area of the
colony and for this vast domain they pay the insignificant rental of �174,331;
whereas as Mr. Service told the House, when he was a member of it?and it will be
remembered that, having been a minister of Lands and Survey, he was entitled to
speak with authority on the subject?if the Crown wanted to get the highest pos-
sible rentals for the runs they could obtain a million of money. Let the people of
this colony weigh well the words of that gentleman. If the pastoral lands of Vic-
toria were turned to proper account, instead of being handed over to the squatters
for another ten years at a merely nominal rent, they would yield a rental?over
and above what they now return?capable of defraying the interest, at five per
cent upon a railway loan of �16.520,000, for which amount we could construct
1 652?miles of additional railway, even at what is now considered to be the extrava-
gant estimate of �lO,OOO per mile. Let ah classes of the community in this and
everv other district destitute of railways ponder well these incontrovertible facts.
When we ask for railway communication we are told the country cannot attbrd it;
and yet the same men who tell us this propose to hand over to the squatters for
another ten years the occupation of a magnificent estate, which, if properly
managed, might be made to provide the interest on a loan sufficiently large to
enable us to" bring every large town, every important agricultural district, and
every centre of mining population, into direct connection with the metropolis.
The writer returns to the charge with renewed vigour, as will he seen on
reference to the extract copied in your paper of this date: ?
With a squatting Chief Secretary and a squatting magnate like Mr. Hugh
Glass pullimr the strings behind the scenes, the people of this colony are about to be
made the victims of a conspiracy which, if successful, will place them completely
at the mercy of the pastoral kings of Victoria, and of the politicians who are playing
their little game, and doing their imperious bidding.
At first sight, 27,000,000 acres loom enormously large, hut after deducting
the laro-e areas of mallee scrub, heath, waterless plains, barren ranges, and
otherwise almost useless land, a comparatively small quantity of good grazing
country remains. A fair sample of the mallee scrub may be seen within fifty
miles of Maryborough, and I commend it to the writer?s attention when he
proceeds to avail himself of his privileges us a free selector. An hou. member
said in the Legislative Assembly a few evenings ago, that the selectors would
clear the mallee scrub, and make it available ; and I do not deny that they
could do so, but before commencing to cultivate, they would require to trans-
fer all the soil from the Western District to it, also to construct most extensive
irrio-ation works. It, however, remains open to question whether the fact of
the malice being prepared for cultivation would compensate for the W estem
District being converted into a desert. With reference to the rental of
�1 000 000 sterling, which Mr. James Service is stated to have said
could have been obtained for the Crown Lands when he was in office during
1859 and 1860,1 am prepared to prove that his estimate was nearly correct, and
this will be readily admitted when it is shown that no fewer than 8,195,526
acres, including nearly all the agricultural land in the colony, have since then
been alienated from the squatting runs by purchase, selection and common-
age. Lest my figures should be disputed, I will proceed to classify the various


items, and I commend them to the attention of the sapient writer now
referred to: ?
Acres.
Sold by auction, 1860 to 1868 .. .. .. 2,502,289
Sold and selected under Land Act of 1862 .. .. 1,222,000
Selected under Amending Act of 1865 .. .. 1,425,151
Do by certificates do do . . .. .. .. 559,423
Do under 42nd clause do do .. .. .. 486,699
Commonage, about .. .. .. .. 2,000,000
Total area alienated, 1860, to December 31, 1868 8,195,562
Now, these lands include almost every acre that is worth anything for
cultivation, the best of those which continue in the occupation of the Crown
tenants being, as a rule, thinly grassed, and only adapted for grazing
purposes. Taking the alienated lands at 2s per acre rental ?and they are
better worth that rate on the average than the acres held by the squatters are
worth one-twentieth part of it ?an area of country, representing �819,556 4s
in annual value, is lost to the pastoral estate since Mr. Service made the
calculation in question. If this amount is deducted from the sum total of
�1,000,000, it will be evident that, even accepting the writer?s views on the
subject of rental, �180,443 16s represents the rent which the Crown tenants
ought to be compelled to pay, assuming, of course, that the valuations of 1860
apply also to 1869. Unfortunately for the settlers, a widely different state of
matters now prevails, for, according to indisputable authorities, station pro-
duce has during the interim, declined in value at least thirty per cent. This
depreciation may seem trivial, and I candidly apologise to the editor of the
paper alluded to for directing his attention to it; still it ought in justice to
be recognised. Assuming, then, that such is the fact, we are led to the con-
clusion that the present rentals ought to be fixed at �126,310 13s 3d per
annum, whereas we actually find, on reference to the Crown Lands office,
that the Government are exacting �177,643 yearly! There is thus, according
to the ruling of the newspaper in question, some �50,000 to be deducted
from the assessments; and let us hope that the President of the Board of
Land and Works, who, according to the new bill, will hold the scales of
justice, will not only promptly make this reduction, but also refund the sums
which must evidently have been overpaid; en passant , it is a noteworthy
fact that Governments always refund with the utmost promptitude.
It is much to be regretted that the writer has, ? Curtius? engulphed
his financial reputation in his own statistics, in re the construction of 1,652
miles of railroad, but clearly if the Crown lands are not worth �1,000,000
per annum, the ?navvies? cannot get to work. Owing to defective foundations
the whole structure falls to the ground! Reqniescat in pace .
The feeling manner in which the writer alludes to the public estate being
handed over to the squatters for another ten years, will doubtless arouse
sympathy in the breasts of the sentimental, but let them take courage, for an
excellent remedy to counteract the attempt to retain possession of the valuable
estate referred to, has been provided byjthe Hon. J. M. Grant. This remedy
is ? free selection before survey, throughout the colony,? and it will be a
? pill? to upset the squatter?s digestion. Under the operation of this
as administered in the sugar of the 42nd clause, he will vanish into thin air,
his run gradually slipping from under his feet. Let us hope that he will
make a will bequeathing his flocks to his successors, the selectors, for their
sole use and benefit. Should he wish to avoid the essentials which are com-
monly supposed to accompany a final dispensation of one?s goods and chattels,
he will doubtless find in a future issue of the paper referred to, a delicate sug-
gestion, that, in accordance with the dictates of common courtesy, not to
mention etiquette, the squatters should ? hand over? (to use a hackneyed


phrase) their flocks to their successors as a peace offering, and also shepherd
the same gratis till further orders.
To advert seriously to the question at issue, it is surely reprehensible in the
highest degree to endeavour to arouse antagonism against a class who are
deserving of the fullest support and consideration. This antagonism does
not proceed from the selectors themselves, for the absence of direct agitation,
and the fact that the new Land Bill concedes to them the fullest rights and
privileges, is sufficient proof that they have no wish to adopt the rabid views
published by a certain section of the country press. An entente cordiale has
already to a great extent been established between them and the squatters,
and if the newspapers alluded to would direct their efforts towards maintaining
and increasing it, they would serve the interests of the community at large.
I remain, Sir, your obedient servant,

EENTS OF SHEEP STATIONS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS.
Sir, ?It must be evident to any person who has even a moderate know-
ledge of business principles, that the present system of fixing the rents of
sheep stations is founded on an entirely wrong basis. Classification, in ac-
cordance with the description of country held, its capacity for depasturing
stock, expense of management, or distance from market, is not even hinted at,
and yet all who have had practical experience in sheep-farming know that
each of these considerations has a direct influence on the returns. One writer,
who in his various letters has brought forward some startling facts, has
pointed out that many stations never have any surplus stock to sell, simply
because the increase is not more than sufficient to make up the deficiencies
caused by disease. Any person who has had experience of fluke can readily
confirm this; indeed, the writer alluded to might have added, that unless the
entire stock were sold off and replaced every three or four years, the greater
portion would die. Diseased sheep cannot yield heavy sound fleeces, so that
in the return from wool, also, there is a serious deficiency when compared
with healthy runs. As regards expenses, it is clear that large areas of thinly-
grassed inferior land, or rangy mountainous country, require not only more
expenditure in labour, but in other respects also; for instance, the large out-
lay for rock salt which poor hilly country requires. A plentiful supply of
salt is absolutely necessary to keep the sheep in even ordinary health. Is it
reasonable that stations of this description should be classed at the same rental
as sound healthy runs which have large lambings, and annually send off
drafts of store or fat stock ? It must be patent to all, that if first-class runs
can afford a rental of 8d per head, those of the inferior description should not
be rated at more than one-fourth to one-half that amount. I consider the
principle of fixing a rate per head is unjust, unless an equitable classification,
according to the description of country, is arrived at.
There is only one really correct mode of arriving at the proper rentals which
ought to be derived from squatting stations ; and the system which is work-
ing so successfully in Eiverina is founded on a principle analogous to that
which I propose to point out. I believe it will be conceded that the only
portion of a well-appointed station on which the Government have any
grounds for charging rental, is the Crown lands forming that station. I
think it will be admitted that the Government have no claim to the sheep,


nor to the freehold purchased land, nor to the selections, so long as rent is paid
on them, nor to the improvements; and yet it is sought to tax the Crown
tenants for each and all of these items ; and this is the case now, as I can
prove by a reference to several stations. Can anything be more uniust ?
And yet the squatters dare not even object to it, whilst the authorities at the
Crown Lands office have so long been accustomed to the system that they
look upon this extortion with complacency; indeed, consider it in all respects
perfectly legitimate. Although the squatters have suffered so much from
selection, all the choicest and most valuable portions of their stations being
alienated from them, they are expected to pay precisely the same rentals,
even where the depasturing capabilites of their runs are decreased to the ex-
tent of fully one-half, whilst the remainder is, by the abstraction of the best
portions, rendered more expensive to work, and is comparatively of little
value. If they remonstrate, they are quietly told to say nothing, or they will
fare worse, and thus a ? reign of terror ? is established. Before an applica-
tion for reduction is even entertained, a fee of �5 is exacted, and this fee is
not returned.
I l * fixing the rentals ot the present stations I would respectfully suggest
the following method. First, value a station in its entirety, stock, purchased
land, and improvements included. This valuation in the case of a sheep
station, could be adjusted at rates varying from 10s to 15s per head for the
sheep, according to description of country, chances of comparative freedom
from selection, healthiness of sheep, expense of management, or distance from
market; and such valuations could readily be arrived at. The Government
upset price of �1 per acre might also be added, where stations include pur-
chased land. For the purpose of illustrating the argument, I will take a case,
sa y A station stocked with 20,000 sheep, consisting of sound healthy pastoral
country, not likely to be much interfered with by selection, and with a ten
years lease, subject to operation of the 42nd clause, given in, would be worth
probably 15s per head, or �15,000. Deduct the value of the sheep, say at 5s
each �5,000 ; do, the cost or value of the various improvements, such as house,
woolshed yards, fencing, dams, &c,, �4,ooo?leaves �6,000 as being the net
value of the Crown lands. On these Crown lands, as fixed at this value,
interest at the debenture rate of 6 per cent, per annum might be charged,
So*a 6 half -y earl 7 as P resen t* This would give the rental of the run at
�.560 per annum, whereas the Government propose to charge all stations 8d
a ,0 31 j ss ee P depastured. Eightpence per head on 20,000 sheep
is �666 13s 4d ; therefore in the case of a run with 20,000 sheep, a squatter
is charged with interest on his own capital expended in improvements
and stock to the extent of �306 13s 4d per annum. This virtually
amounts to charging him interest at 6 per cent, per annum on �5,111 sterling
ot ms own money. If the interest were calculated at the present borrowing
rate of 5 per cent, per annum, a still more glaring inconsistency would be
apparent. 1 have cited a first-class station as an example of the application of
the rule, but it would apply with equal force to an inferior run, because on
interior country the sheep are not nearly so valuable, nor would the improve-
ments be worth so much. Probably a valuation of not more than 2s 6d per
head would be fixed on the sheep.
No wonder that whilst such a system is prevalent the Victorian settlers
are involved in difficulties. In order to assist them the banks and agents have
materially reduced the rates of interest, but the Government adopts precisely
the opposite course, for no matter how much wool or stock may decline in
value no matter how much their runs may have diminished in area and
grazing capabilities the same rentals must be extorted from them. I consider
that, taking mto account the altered times, 4d per head now, is equal to 8d per
head in 1862. r
I eould cite individual instances of stations which at th's present time are


paying interest to the Government to the extent of twenty to thirty per cent,
per annum on the value the bare Crown lands would realise if offered to public
competition. In these instances the owners have erected vahiableimprovements,
which they cannot afford to forfeit, and they continue paying the rents m the
hope of an equitable adjustment. All their efforts to obtain this have, however,
been fruitless, and their deposits of �5 each have been paid to little purpose.
So much has been said about making the squatters pay a fair rental for
their runs, and so much indisputable evidence has been brought forward to
prove that they are already paying considerably more than a fair rental, that
I need scarcely refer to the question. , ������
If the interest on 20s is calculated at the rate of ten per cent, per annum,
which is the present hank rate on overdrawn accounts, it must he evident
that the selectors will, under the proposed new Land Bill, acquire a Crown
nrant of their lands for nothing, the mode of payment being neither more
nor less than a free gift of the public estate. They are to pay only the
interest on the purchase-money of �1 per acre, the principal being given to
them Even if interest is estimated at tne debenture rate of six per cent,
per annum, it will he found that the total cost at the end of the thirteen
years would he only 10s 5d per acre, and if the extended tune for payment is
taken Into consideration, it will he clear that even at this lesser rate of
interest, the terms are almost nominal. The squatters, who are m all reB P ectB
equally worthy of support, and more especially so when considered as
colonists and large employers of labour and capital, are vmtually prolnhited
from purchasing land even to protect their improvements, although they ask
the privilege of being allowed to pay at least �1 pen. acre cash for it, and as
much more as public competition may force them to give. _ , ~ .
The manifest injustice towards the squattmg interest is too palpable t
require comment. AGENDA.

rr. n rprrp PASTORAL TENANTS OF VICTORIA, AND ALL WHO
iRE mTERESTED IN THE SQUATTING QUESTION.
Gentlemen', -From the manner in which the vanousclausesofthenew
Land Bill are being discussed by the Legislative Assembly, it will, doubtless,
be apparent to you that the squatting interest is scarcely receiving that
reasonable consideration to which it is entitled. In advancing this state-
ment it is not desired or intended to question the justice of the decisions
which have been arrived at in respect to the various clauses which have
already been disposed of; but it is submitted that, even at this early stage of
thediscussion, it is apparently but too clear that the bias of the arguments
brought forward is to the disadvantage of the pastoral tenants as a class.
That there are no legitimate grounds for this tendency towards antagoras
will, I believe, be admitted by all who have any knowledge of Reposition
which the squatters have occupied for many years past. It cannot be proved
that they have retarded settlement; indeed, a reference to the present unfor-
tunate juncture in their affairs affords the best proof they have not done
It is well known that nearly all the land worth cultivation Has Deen
alienated from their runs, and in consequence of this
in value of wool and sheep, they are at present involved m almost inextricable
"Government, in consideration of continued droughts, bad seasons and
the great decline in value of pastoral produce, are, m the new Land Bill,
moving large concessions to those persons who have selected land under the


amending Act of 1865. The wise policy thus displayed is worthy of all
commendation, and the squatters are glad to recognise the acts of prudent
legislation thus evidenced. They also approve of the facilities which are
ottered to all who desire to commence the cultivation of the Crown lands of
the colony, and they do not desire to offer any obstacles in the way of legiti-
mate settlement. _ In conceding this, it may, however, be asked why such
ample consideration should he extended to one class of colonists, and not to
another class, whose claims, whether considered in respect to policy or equity
are m all matters quite equal to those of the selectors. Heavy rentals!
droughts, _ bad seasons, and depression in value of wool and sheep, have
pressed with equal force against the squatters, but their claims for considera-
tion are entirely ignored. The cause of this lies in the fact that the
selectors are fully represented in the Legislative Assembly, and the squatters
are virtually unrepresented ; the two or three members who might advocate
their claims, being entirely out-voted and out-numbered. This ought not
to. be the case, for the squatting interest has been one great means of
raismg the colony to its present proud position, and at this time it is one of
its chiei sources of wealth. A reference to the fact that 150,000 bales of
wool representing, even at present reduced rates, probably �2,000,000 in
value, are annually produced on the squatting stations of Victoria alone,
wiil prove this, and when the value of stock is added, it will be clear
that this is an interest which the colony cannot afford to sacrifice. The
millions of capital involved, and the thousands of men employed on the
various stations, seem to be entirely lost sight of, and yet any man of even
ordmaiy foresight, can readily perceive that it would be most suicidal policy
to wilfully destroy an interest of this magnitude. The Crown lands
cannot be utilised to better advantage than at present, and the attempt
to create a new class of settlers to evict and succeed the pastoral
tenants, will doubtless, if it is carried much further, lead to
the rum, not only of the present occupants, but of their would-be
successors. In short, if selection is carried on to the same extent as it has
been this past three years, the colony will, probably before the expiration
of another three years, be called upon to legislate for the relief of a class
o suffering farmers, created out of the wreck of the chief source of its pros-
perity. It is simply impossible for small farms of inferior land to give a
lucrative source of income in this uncertain climate, unless under very
exceptional circumstances. Even if nine-tenths of the present Crown Lands
were divided into farms of 320 acres each, and one of these farms was pre-
eented to each selector as a free gift, I question if three-fourths of them could
eke out even a miserable subsistence, by either cultivation or grazing. If
there were ten times the present population, a gift of farms of this acreage
might be worth acceptance, because there would be a market for produce.
iWen with the present large population (when compared with the adjoining
profitable results.
It must be evident that there are no obstacles in the way of protection to
the squatters ; but they scarcely ask even for protection, but simply for a
small share of that consideration which is now being so bountifully extended
? reasonable man will, or can, dispute their right to this, ?
indeed, were their claims argued on equitable grounds, or had even common
justice been extended to them, they would probably not have been in their
present unfortunate position, nor would so many of the selectors have hope-
essly sunk their capital and involved themselves in difficulties through the
allurements of that ? will-o?-the-wisp,? a liberal land law. Is it not well
known, and do not many of these men themselves admit, that they were in all


resnects more happy and contented in the employ of the squatters, than they
S rcStivators under the auspices of the existing Land Act? In the
one instance their remuneration was a certainty, but in the other case it is
anything but certain, for they cannot force the growth of luxuriant crops on
inferior soil, nor can they compel the payment of a remunerative pnce for
their produce. I admit that numbers of them have prospered, but these are the
fortunate possessors of good agricultural land. As nothing but mfcnor to
average grazing country remains, chances of this kind are not likely to occur
ag The first and most important concession which the squatters desire the
Government to extend to them is a reduction of the present most excessive
rentals. So many letters have appeared m the papers on this subject, that it
is almost unnecessary to furnish reasons for an application of this nature,
cannot be disputed that all the best lands have been alienated from the stations,
that wool has declined in value from 35 to 40 per cent, during the past three
years, and that store and fat sheep have on the average sustained a reduction
to the extent of at least 50 per cent, during the same period. The selectors have
already informed the Government about the two last-named items; and they
have further drawn attention to the fact that severe droughts and disastrous
bush fires have been experienced since 1865, and that they have suffered
greatly in consequence. The Government have promptly acceded to their
wishes by virtually proposing to forego the one pound per acre purchase-
money? for their lands; for if interest is calculated at the Bank rate of 10 per
cent per annum, it will be found that the concession of deferred payments by
instalments of two shillings per acre, extending over ten years, amounts to a
gift of the lands they have selected. , , , , ...
S At the very time that this liberal gift is made to the selectors it is proposed
to raise the rents of the squatters. The reasons for adopting this anomalous
svstem of legislation are difficult of solution, and the inference drawn will
probably be that the desire is to extinguish the squatting interest as speedily
as possible. On no other grounds can the course adopted be even excused,
for it cannot be disputed that the very misfortunes to which the selectors have
been subjected, have pressed with almost double force on the squatters. They
have in been continually harrassed by the incessant reduction of
the grazing capabilities of their stations, through the cream of their runs being
selected thus destroying their paddocks, and forcing them to sell stock at a
sacrifice? They have also seen their valuable improvements become the pro-
perty of the new occupants of the lands. No compensation is given for these
minrovementa though they are readily adopted by the incoming tenants, and
often very materially assist in enchancing the value of their selections, and
making up the expenditure of �1 per acre which is required by e
CrowP before a certificate is granted. No apphcation for reduction
of rent in respect of these selections is even entertained, unless a deposit ot �5
L paid and forfeited and in no case that has come under my knowledge has
the reduction made amounted to one-fourth the depreciation m grazmg
canabilities which the run may have sustained.
I do not attempt to excuse the cases of bribery and corruption with which
about twelve of the squatters have been charged, although I do maintain that
if these men could not secure a recognition of .their just rights without having
SSTL, mean, ot obtaining it, their offence i., after all, a on.
The bribed, not the bribers, were the real offenders. The editor ot a
Melbourne newspaper, in reply to my arguments, urged that the squatters, as
a class, were unworthy of support, because they had been guilty of b bery.
Mav I ask him if he would condemn a thousand editors of newspapers
because twelve of those editors had resorted to questionable means m
endeavouring to retain possession of their own property *
It appears to me that there is now only one course open for the squatte


to adopt, and that is, to petition the Legislative Council and Legislative
Assembly, laying before both Houses the difficulties with which they have to
contend, and praying for their consideration of the pastoral interest in the
New Land Bm. In order to carry out this object, I propose to draw up a
petition embodying the alterations which ought to be made in the Bill if the
squatting interest is to be saved from ruin. These alterations will not
mtertere with the rights proposed to be accorded to the selectors, for the
squatters recognize their claims, and are willing to cheerfully facilitate them
in effecting the settlment of the country to advantage. I propose to forward
copies of this petition to settlers in the various districts of the colony with
whom l am acquainted, and their duty will be to obtain the signatures of all
persons interested in station property; indeed I have not the least doubt that
many ot the selectors also will willingly append their signatures to
such a document. I beg respectfully to offer my services, and
1 am prepared to conduct all those details which will have to be
earned out in Melbourne. The only portion of the work which I ask the
settlers to perform, is for each to canvass his own district, and obtain the sig-
natures of those who are interested. The project only occurred to me a few
days ago, and I have mentioned it to several of my pastoral friends, also to
many ot the principal merchants, all of whom cordially coincide in the views
1 have endeavoured to elucidate on the squatting question. They agree with
me that a bona fide petition of this character, influentially and numerously

great influence with the Legislative Council,
and also the Legislative Assembly; and, if it should be successful in attain-
ing the desired object, I shall feel amply rewarded.
In a few days I shall forward copies of the petition to the various districts
ot the colony, and, in the meantime, communications for me can be addressed
to the care of Andrew Murray, Esq., the editor of the Economist. Hoping
tnat the project will secure your approval and support,
I remain, gentlemen,

THE SQUATTERS? PETITION.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE AGE.
Sir, In the leading article on the squatting question which appears in this
day?s Age I notice a serious misstatement; indeed, had I not seen a similar
assertion a few weeks ago, I should have concluded it was an error caused by
accident. It is to the effect that six million acres of land out of the seven
million acres which have been alienated from the runs, have passed into the
hands of the squatters. A different tale is told in a return published by the
Crown Lands Office, and which was laid before the House of Assembly on
the 29th June, wherein it will be found that from Ist January, 1862, to 31st
December, 1868, the following lands were alienated from the runs by
purchase, selection and commonage:? J

Acres.
Of this total quantity the squatters purchased and selected less than 2,000,000
acres, and the hulk of even this acreage was taken up under the Duffy Act of
1862. During the latter year many stations in the Western district and
Ginns Land were converted into estates, and thus the owners, fortunately for
themselves, were enabled to secede from the much abused squatting com-
munity, and become landed proprietors. The present squatters have scarcely
had the opportunity of securing any land, even for the protection of the
most important portions of their improvements; indeed the whole legal
machinery of the Crown Lands department has been put into operation for
the express purpose of preventing them from obtaining even the smallest and
most necessary portions of their runs. If the new Land Bill comes into
operation, it is but too evident that improvements which have cost several
miHions sterling will be jeopardised, and probably m many
uselessly sacrificed. I say uselessly sacrificed, because nine-tenths of
the land forming the present stations is entirely worthless for
purposes, and the fact of its being opened to indiscriminate selection will
pave the way to wholesale extortion. It will certainly never be taken up for
cultivation, and it will not pay for grazing on a small scale. The flagrant
injustice with which the pastoral interest has been treated is now beginning
tobe so palpable to all classes of the community that a decided reaction is
not far distant. Probably the and a certain section of t e
Legislature, will then bo induced to cease their efforts to destroy the leading
interest of the colony. I trust these senseless attempts to extirpate the
squatters will be thwarted so far as the remaining stations are concerned;
otherwise it is not difficult to foresee that a disastrous financial crisis and wide
spread ruin will be the result.

RENTS OF SQUATTING STATIONS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE HAMILTON SPECTATOR.
Sir, ?My attention has been directed to a letter published in your issue of
the 11th inst., signed John B. Hughes. Had not the writer advanced his
statements in an authoritative, and so far as I am personally concerned,
offensive manner, I should not have replied to his assertions. He has, how-
ever, come forward in a spirit which leaves me no option; therefore, great as is
my aversion to newspaper controversies, I must needs trespass on your space
for the purpose of contradicting this would-be dictator.
After alluding to the petition being 411 hawked? about the colony, and
endeavouring to awe the uninitiated by stating that he has refused to sign it,
he proceeds to deny the statement embodied in the petition, to the effect that
the present rentals were fixed by fair arbitration in 1862. He endeavours to
fortify his contradiction by an allusion to his connection with the Gannawarra
Station, at which I must confess my surprise, as the termination of his connec-
tion with that station is well known. He further proceeds to state that
according to the basis of an arrangement made between the Government and
the Crown tenants in 1862, all the improvements on the different stations
will, after the 31st December, 1870, become the property of the colony. Now,
to quote his own words, I deny that statement altogether.
I say that this lease, which he alleges formed an essential portion of a
contract made in 1862, was never actually granted; and I further beg to
assert that even had it been granted, the Government dissolved the contract
in 1866, by bringing forward an Amending Land Act, which placed the best
squatting runs entirely at the mercy of an indiscriminate system of selection.
To bring the matter home to him, I will suggest an analogy to this cancella-
tion of the contract, presuming of course that such contract ever existed,
which I dispute.
I will therefore ask him whether, if he were to take a lease of the Victoria
Hotel, Hamilton, for eight years, at a rental of �5OO per annum, and at the
expiration of three years, the landlord took forcible possession of the bar and
best rooms, and re-let same to another tenant, he would not consider his lease
cancelled. I will further suppose that he had during the three years expended
�2,000 sterling in erecting additional buildings and otherwise improving the
hotel, and that the landlord, notwithstanding this, not only retained possession of
the bar and best rooms as aforesaid, hut also refused to allow him any compen-
sation for the improvements he had made, and, in addition, insisted on the
full rental of �550 per annum being faithfully and punctually paid up to the
date of expiration of the lease. I think lam justified in stating that, if the
Supreme Court refused to grant redress, Mr. John B. Hughes would feel
mightily aggrieved, and from his well known love of publicity, doubtless the
story of his wrongs would reach the uttermost bounds of Her Majesty's
dominions.
Now the landlord of the pastoral tenants of Victoria has acted towards
them in a somewhat similar manner, and yet Mr. John B. Hughes would
contend that the said landlord has the right to insist on a supposititious lease
being carried out in its integrity.
The pastoral tenants have always maintained a defensive attitude, hut their
remonstrances have been set aside. It must not bo forgotten that the rights
conferred by the Orders in Council in March, 1847, are not abrogated,
although they have been ignored. Even had the arrangement of 1862 been
carried out, the squatters would still, at the expiration of 1870, require to be
dealt with as tenants who had the pre-emption conferred by right of posses-


sion, extending over thirty years, and the enormous outlay expended by them
in improving the property of the State.
Mr. Duffy, in his official pamphlet, describes the arrangement made with
the squatters in 1862 as follows;??It is provided that existing runs shall
continue to be let for pastoral purposes on a yearly license, which license,
however, shall issue uninterruptedly (unless Parliament otherwise provides)
for eight years from the first of January, 1868.?
This arrangement does not mention any contract, or any compensation to
be given; how, then, could the tenure cease at the expiration of 1870? I
admit that the Act provides for the extinction of the Orders in Council, but as
these had never been put into legal operation, such a provision was unneces-
sary. If Mr. Duffy had intended that all claims on behalf of the Crown
tenants should expire in 1870, he would have worded the clauses very dif-
ferently. The fact is, the squatters had at that time been in uninterrupted
possession for more than twenty years, and the Duffy act provided that their
tenancy should not be disturbed for a period of eight years. At the end of
that term, another arrangement would require to be made, and this arrange-
ment is sought to be effected by means of the Land Bill which is now under
discussion in the House of Assembly.
Doubtless Mr. John B. Hughes is aware that the colony owed its prosperity
up to the discovery of the goldfields almost entirely to pastoral occupation, and
I would further bring under his notice the fact that in 1851 a wealthy com-
munity, numbering 80,000 souls, exporting produce to the value of �1,000,000
sterling per annum, were congregated in Victoria in a great measure through
the enterprise and exertions of the pastoral tenants. They were the founders
and pioneers of the colony, and from that date to the present the pastoral
interest has been one of its chief sources of wealth. Their present tenancy
is very different from that which in other countries comes under the
designation of squatting. For instance, in the United States of America,
several millions of sheep are grazed without any rental being exacted,
consequently no obligations are involved. Here the pastoral tenants have for
many years past paid the fullest annual value of the Crown lands which
they occupy, and the question involves both legal rights and enormous
property. Indeed, this is recognised by that unbiassed standard of appeal,
the Supreme Court. Even the Duke of Newcastle, in his speech in the
House of Lords, when referring to this subject, said?? None of their lord-
ships would deny that where a tenant had expended his money in the
improvement of a property, and he was dispossessed by his landlord,
he had a moral right to compensation. And the Duke, in his
memorable despatch, suggested that compensation should be made
to the squatters for the loss of their runs and improvements,
but this the Government have never offered, and the question still
remains unsettled. The editor of the Economist states, in the issue of that
paper of the 30th ult., that ? The rights of the pastoral tenants under the
Orders in Council were excepted by the Constitution Act, and cannot legally
be dealt with or infringed by any Act of Parliament. The Queen?s
promises and engagements were expressly reserved, and no less an authority
than Sir Roundell Palmer has said that the Orders in Council are promises
and engagements still binding and still unfulfilled. Of course, our Parlia-
ment has driven a coach-and-six through those promises and engagements;
but our Parliament is not supreme, and at any moment questions might arise,
and the Supreme Court and the Privy Council might be appealed
to in behalf of those who may suffer from the illegal acts of our Parliament and
Government. One of the promises was the grant of leases for fourteen
years. This promise remains unfulfilled. It may be said that,
substantially, the lease has been granted. But even supposing this was so,
there was a promise of renewal. Section 16 declares that 4 if no part of the


run be sold, the previous lessee shall be entitled to a renewal of the lease of
the whole ; or if any part of the run not amounting in all to one equal fourth
thereof be sold, such lessee shall be entitled to a renewal of the lease for the
remaining parts of the lands comprised in his run.? Such was Her Majesty's
engagement, by Order in Council, signed at Osborne House, on 9th March,
1847 ; and the Constitution Act, from which our Parliament derives its
powers, expressly declares ? that nothing herein contained shall prevent, or
be construed to prevent, the fulfilment of any contract, promise or engage-
ment made by or on behalf of Her Majesty, with respect to any lands situate
within the said colony, in any cases where such contract, promise, or engage-
ment shall have been lawfully made before the time at which this Act shall
take effect within the said colony.' ?
The settlers are not however, so unreasonable as to ask that these rights
should be respected ; and, indeed, the said rights have been entirely set aside,
the Government having sold stations and portions of stations, ad libitum,
without either compensation or consideration. This has not been objected to,
and taking into account all matters connected with the case, no reasonable
man can object to any portion of the petition. It fully recognises the fact
that the pastoral tenants must give way to agricultural settlement, but until
the lands are required for more advantageous purposes, it asks that the present
system of occupation may be continued. Tinder the circumstances, I am
surprised that even Mr. John B. Hughes should take exception to this.
With reference to the rentals exacted, and the desire to have them fixed
at 2d to 4d per sheep, and Is to 2s per head of cattle, according to description
of country, I believe that were the rentals fixed at these rates, the sum total
would be almost or fully as much as is at present collected. It must be borne
in mind that nearly all the stations in the colony are stocked to the utmost
extent, and indeed overstocked, a large proportion of them carrying double
the number of sheep which were depastured in 1862; in fact, I know
instances where by lavish expenditure of capital, in fencing, dams, and other
costly improvements, the grazing capabilities have been almost trebled.
This, however, has been effected at the cost of great depreciation in the
of the stock, which on many stations are not to be com-
pared with the sheep which were depastured in 1862. It follows
that the exaction of a rental of 8d per sheep, and 4s per head of cattle,
would aggregate a sum total of probably double the present amounts, whereas
we find that under the exaction of only �177,500 sterling, the pastoral tenants
are greatly overtaxed. It is not, however, the present rentals which necessi-
tate the petition, but the dread of the enormous sums which will be extorted
when the new Land Bill comes into operation. At present values of wool
and stock, wide spread ruin must ensue, for the settlers cannot possibly pay
them.
Brevity is the soul of wit; but, as Quintilian has it, Nimium corripientes
omnia sequitur obscuritas , hence the length of my epistle.
I remain,
Your obedient servant,
