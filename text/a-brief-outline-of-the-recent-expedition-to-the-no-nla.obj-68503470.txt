tion of 1600 persons ; of these seven only were white; and 350
were Mandingos, who inhabited a village before the British took
possession of it. Thanks to the active zeal of the Wesleyan mis-
sionaries, here are now two chapels, two schools for children, and
one for adults, and the natives seem cheerful, orderly, and well-
disposed to cultivate the ground, and to apply themselves to learn
the various arts in which they are instructed.
When we consider the dreadful state of the slave-trade, which
recent inquiries have brought to light, and the absolute necessity
that exists, if we really wish to put a stop to it, of inducing the
negroes to turn their attention either to cultivating the ground, or
to some peaceful occupation, in their own country, we are san-
guine enough to look upon this establishment at Janjan-Bure as
a normal school, where people of nearly every tribe of Western
Africa are receiving instruction in arts and civilization, if not in
Christianity, which they may eventually carry with them to their
several homes, and thereby be the means of diffusing civilization
in places the most remote and inaccessible, which for the next
century neither missionary nor traveller can hope to visit.
XII.? A brief outline of the recent Expedition to the North-west
Coast of Australia ; under Lieutenants Grey and Lusiiington.
Principally from documents in the Colonial Office.
[ln offering to the readers of the f Geographical Journal? a brief out-
line of the recent expedition to the north-western coast of Australia,
extracted chiefly from documents liberally furnished to the Society
by the Colonial Office and the Admiralty, it is not with the slightest
hope of satisfying curiosity, or to anticipate the interest which the
public in general, and geographers especially, always feel in
enterprizes of this nature, but merely to give such a sketch of the
principal features of the expedition as may serve to direct those
who are desirous of obtaining information respecting a portion of
this remarkable country ?hitherto only visited by Tasman, Dam-
pier, Baudin, and King, and never before, we believe, penetrated
by any European?to look forward to the detailed journals of the
spirited officers who had the conduct of the expedition, assured
that they will contain much to interest them, not only in geo-
graphy and in the light thrown upon the origin of the races who
now inhabit this vast island, but in natural history, geology, and
other branches of science.]

tenants Grey and Lushington, and their party for the land
expedition, left England on the 14th of Jnly, and touching
at Teneriffe and Bahia in the Brazils, reached the Cape of
Good Hope on the 21st of September, 1837- Here the parties
separated, as the Eeacjle s orders directed her to Swan River,
while the leaders of the land expedition adopted the spirited hut
hazardous determination of proceeding direct to their destination
on the N.W. coast of Australia.
Having freighted the Lynher, a schooner of 160 tons, taken on
board 50 sheep and goats, and made all the requisite arrange-
ments for the thorough equipment of their party, Messrs. Grey
and Lushington quitted the Cape on the 20th of October, and on
the 3rd of December reached Hanover Bay, at the outlet ot
Prince Regent?s River, in lat. 15� 20' south, long. 124� 40' east.
Here having landed and pitched their tents in a beautiful
valley now for the first time trodden by European feet, and hav-
ing formally taken possession of this part of the countiy in the
name of her Majesty, the schooner, under charge of Mr. Lushing-
ton, was despatched to Coepang, in the island of Timor, distant
about 300 miles to the north, to embark ponies, of which six-and-
twenty were obtained, at the rate of about two pounds each, chiefly
in exchange for muskets and powder.
During the vessel s absence Mr. Orey and liis party examined
the country in the immediate vicinity of their camp and explored
a small stream which watered the valley, for about five miles to
the southward, where it separated into two branches ; one of which
is little more than a mountain torrent; the other a much more
considerable stream, winding through a deep and narrow valley :
the soil brought down by it was rich and good, and therefore it
was probably the drain of a considerable tract of fertile country.
The country generally as viewed from the sea, promises well,
but upon landing the first appearance is monotonous and stenl;
being composed of rocky hills of sandstone about 300 feet in
height, covered with brushwood and prickly grass; but between
these hills are beautiful vallies, the soil of which is fertile, and
where fresh water may always be found. Although at this time,
from prudential motives, no communication was held with the
natives, still their huts were visited, and found to consist of a conical
frame-work of wood, about 4 feet high and 10 feet in diametei at
the base, and were upon the whole well and neatly made. The
natives were evidently in possession of sharp-cutting instruments,
and many large trees were seen with notches or steps cut in
them, by means of which they ascend for the purpose of stripping
off the bark, which furnishes them with all the clothes they need
in this fine climate^?the hatchets may probably be of stone.
The principal food of the natives would seem to be here, as in
other parts of this land, kangaroo and shell-fish, as the remains


of them were found near their fires, and both of them are
abundant.
On the return of Lieutenant Lusliington from Timor with the
ponies and other necessaries, on the 20th of January, 1838, the
party commenced their preparations for their immediate depar-
ture; and on the Ist of February quitted their encampment at
Hanover Bay for the interior. The party consisted of 12 persons,
including besides the leaders of the expedition, Mr. Walker, as
surgeon and naturalist, two sailors, three men of the corps of
sappers and miners, &c., with their ponies laden with instruments,
provisions, and baggage, and followed by part of their flock
of sheep and goats. They proceeded first about 15 miles in a
nearly due south direction, until they had reached the parallel
of 15� 29' S. lat. The whole of the country lying between this
point and Hanover Bay was composed of ridges of sandstone, of
no great elevation, but intersected by deep ravines ; their progress
was consequently slow and toilsome, for they had to construct paths
for the horses to travel upon before they were able to move from
one encampment to the next spot where they intended to halt.
In this first part of the journey they also lost many horses ; indeed
all of them suffered more or less from it.
After passing the parallel of 15�29'S. they entered upon a
very rich tract of country, that even surpassed in fertility that
small portion of the Brazils which they had had an opportunity
of seeing. A large expanse of Avater having been seen a little to
the Avest of south, they were induced to pursue that direction,
and still found the country to be of the same rich and luxuriant
character. Upon attaining the parallel of 15� 43' S. lat., and
124� 44' E. long., they found themselves upon the banks of a
very considerable river, which Lieutenant Grey named Glenelg
River, in testimony of the obligations which he and the Avhole
expedition Avere under to the Principal Secretary of State for the
Colonies.
The river was at this point salt; and as, from its magnitude
and rapid current, no possibility existed of crossing it, they were
obliged to travel up its banks in a north-easterly direction?their
progress being much impeded by the number of tributary streams
which poured into it, many of these being of such a size and
depth, OAving to their running through a loav country, that they
Avere in the same manner obliged to travel for several miles up
their banks, before they could get an opportunity of crossing them.
The luxuriance of the vegetation also much impeded their pro-
gress ; so that, although their horses again began to thrive from
the goodness of the grass, their advance was still sloAvand difficult.
The river first became perfectly fresh at a point situated in
15� 41' S. lat., and 124� 53' E. long. Beyond this point it Avould
not be navigable for large vessels; for a series of rapids occur


here, so that a portage must necessarily he established: imme-
diately below this point a shoal of porpoises was seen.
From hence they still continued their course to the eastward,
in the direction of the river, hut at some distance from it, until
they arrived at a point situated in 15� 41' 50" S. lat., and 124� 59'
E. long. The river was here quite fresh, running at the rate of
rather more than 5 knots an hour. Its banks were composed of
fine white sand; and even close to the bank it was fathoms in
depth.
On the other side of the river the country hereabouts appeared
to be low and marshy; and a remarkable circumstance was ob-
served, namely, that drift-wood, weeds, &c. were lodged in the
forked branches of trees at least 15 feet above their heads when
they stood upon the banks of the river : extensive inundations must
therefore sometimes take place, and at these periods there is little
doubt that the whole of the low country to the south is flooded.
A very large tributary stream here joined the river, which they
could not cross, as it ran through a low and marshy country; and
they were again obliged to turn off to the northward. After fol-
lowing its course for about eight miles through a marshy and al-
most impassable country, they succeeded in crossing it, but still
experienced great difficulty in travelling upon the other side of it;
for owing to the heavy rains which had lately fallen, the marshes
were almost impassable.
Lieut. Grey here remarks that these heavy rains, which were
of several days? continuance, had but very little effect upon the
main river, and would by no means account for the signs of in-
undation which they there saw. This is a remarkable fact, and,
viewed in connexion with some others, bears materially upon the
physical geography of the country.
In 15� 4Q' S. lat., and 125� 6' E. long., they crossed another
very considerable stream, which ran in the direction of Glenelg
river. This was the largest tributary stream seen flowing down
to it.
The next point at which they saw the river was in 15� 56' S.
lat., and in 125� 8' E. long.; it was here 250 yards wide, but again
formed a series of rapids; and they found a ford just above these,
the average depth of which was not more than 3 feet. The soil
on its banks was still good : the bed of the river at this point
trended away to the eastward.
Only 12 ponies now surviving out of the 26 which had arrived
from Timor, it was deemed prudent no longer to follow the course
of this river; but Lieut. Grey resolved to push on with as much
dispatch as possible in the direction of the great opening behind
Dampier?s Land; for although it was evident that from want of
provisions they would soon be compelled to return to Hanover


Bay, he conceived it absolutely necessary that the part of the
country above alluded to should be examined.
After crossing the river, the country again changed its cha-
racter, the soil becoming sandy, and they began the ascent of a
chain of hills running from S.E. to N.W, They continued
this gradual ascent for three days, and then found themselves at
a point situated in 1()� 3' S. lat. and 125� 13' 30'' E. long.: they
were now nearly at the summit of the part of the range that they
were on, but to the S.E., south, and S.W. they could see nothing
but inaccessible precipices.
Several days were occupied in trying to find a pass by which
the horses might proceed over the mountains, but none such
could be found ; they, therefore, resolved to proceed with a small
party to examine the country to the south of their present
position.
At this time Mr. Grey?s wound in the hip, which he received
from the spear of a native at the outset of his journey, became so
painful, that the surgeon positively forbade his proceeding a step
farther. A detached party, therefore, started under the com-
mand of Mr. Lushington, and attained a point situated in about
16� SO' S. lat. and 125� 15' E. long.; the result of their recon-
naissance was, that in all probability, no large river could exist
immediately to the south.
As any further attempt to proceed in that direction appeared
then to be useless, and as the party were compelled to return to
Hanover Bay from want of provisions, they resolved to make for
this point by a route different to that which they had already tra-
versed, and thus fully to complete the exploration of this portion
of the country.
On arriving at Hanover Bay, on the 15th March, they had the
unexpected pleasure of meeting with Captain Wickham, R.N., in
command of H.M.S. Beagle, who had, after a careful examination
of the coast, arrived at the same conclusion, viz., that no large
river could exist between the one that they had discovered, and
Fitzrog River, which he had discovered at the south part of the
great opening behind Dampier?s Land.
These rivers, although of considerable magnitude, are still
utterly insufficient to account for the drainage of this vast conti-
nent, and this interesting question, instead of being at all placed
in a clearer point of view by the united exertions of these two
expeditions is, if possible, at this moment involved in deeper ob-
scurity and mystery than ever.
In the course of the journey Messrs. Grey and Lushington
found a great many curious native paintings in caves, executed in
a surprising way for a savage race. In these caves were some


drawings of the human hand, which showed great knowledge of
the art of producing effect: they selected a rock in the most
gloomy part of the cave, and the hand must have been placed upon
this rock and some white powder dashed against it. When the
hand was removed, a sort of stamp was left upon the rock ; the
hand was then painted black and the rock about it quite white, so
that on entering that part of the cave, it appeared as if a human
hand and arm were projecting through a crevice, admitting light.
Many of the figures in these drawings were clothed, though the
natives themselves were in a perfect state of nature. These and
other circumstances would countenance the belief that they are a
race of Asiatic origin; indeed, Lieut. Grey expresses his conviction
that the mass of evidence he has collected on this point will
enable him to prove it.*
These caves and paintings were all far inland, and nothing of
the kind was near the coast. Copies were also obtained of some
of the drawings by the natives living on the coast, but these are
said to be the productions of a quite distinct race.
Before quitting Hanover Bay the party had the gratification of
seeing the bread-fruit and cocoa-nut trees which they had brought
from Timor, and planted in the valley, as well as numerous seeds
from the Brazils and the Cape of Good Hope, in a most flourish-
ing state. They had also introduced and left there several
animals, as ponies, goats, and sheep, and in short done everything
in their power to make their visit a blessing to the natives and
to the country.
On the 30th April the Lynher sailed for the Mauritius, whence
Mr. Grey?s letter is dated on -the 2nd June, at which time, it is
highly satisfactory to add, he had quite recovered the effects of his
wound, and contemplated returning to a more southern portion of
the same coast of Australia. Lieutenant, now, we are happy to
say. Captain Lushington, has arrived in England, and it is gratifying
to hear the distinct testimony he bears to the zeal and energy
displayed by Lieutenant Grey, even when suffering from the
effects of a wound and a tropical temperature, in his anxiety to
carry into execution the expedition entrusted to his charge.

Xlll. ?Outline of the Survey of part of the N.W. Coast of
Australia, in H.M.S. Beagle, in 1838. By Captain Wick-
ham, R.N. Communicated by Captain Beaufort, Royal
Navy.
H.M.S. Beagle, 17th April, 1838.
Port-George IV., N.W. Coast of Australia.
Sir, ?I have the honour to acquaint you that H.M. surveying
vessel, under ray command, sailed from Swan River on the 4th
January, 1838, and proceeded direct to the N.W. coast of
Australia.
We reached the shoal soundings off Cape Villaret on the even-
ing of the 15th without being able to make out the land before
dark; but continued to stand on until the water shoaled to 14
fathoms, when an anchor was dropped to enable us to retain
our position, with a view to commence the examination of Roe-
buck Bay in the morning; consequently at daylight we ivere
under way and standing into the bay, which we soon found to be
very shoal, and were obliged to anchor with Cape Villaret bear-
ing S. 15� W. 6 or 7 miles, and about 3� miles off shore, in
6 fathoms at high-water, and a rise and fall of 18 feet at the
neaps.
Several attempts were made to get the ship farther into the
bay, but we only succeeded in getting her about 5 or 6 miles
above our first anchorage. The examination of the bay was con-
sequently commenced in the boats, and was soon found to be of
small extent, terminating in flats of muddy sand, which dried from
1 to 2 miles off at low water.
The shores of the bay were carefully traced without our being
able to discover any opening whatever, thereby setting at rest the
question respecting Dampier Land being an island.
From Roebuck Bay we proceeded to the nortlrward, where
the coast was found to differ a little from that laid down in the
charts ; and, thinking there might be some opening unobserved by
Captain King, owing to his distance off shore, we narrowly ex-
amined every part of the coast as far as Point Swan, never being
more than from 2 to 3 miles off shore, and at times considerably
within that distance, anchoring every night, which we were for-
tunately enabled to do, owing to the favourable state of the
weather.
The bay round Sandy Point, which has been named Beagle
Bay, in lat. 16� 50', affords the best anchorage on the coast, but it
is exposed to westerly winds.
The coast from Roebuck Bay to Point Swan having been
closely examined, without the slightest appearance of even a


stream of fresh water running into the sea from any part of it,
and the weather being evidently on the eve of a change, and the
westerly monsoon setting in upon the coast, the ship was moored
off the first sandy beach round Point Swan, which place appeared
to offer the best anchorage we were likely to find. I therefore
resolved to wait a few days for the purpose of rating the chrono-
meters, and making the other necessary observations, and, if pos-
sible, to complete our stock of water: wood we saw was plentiful
everywhere.
We remained at this anchorage until February 9th, during
which time we had constant bad weather, blowing hard from the
westward, between N.W. and S.W., with very heavy rain, and
much thunder and lightning.
This bad weather, although very much against our surveying
operations, was favourable to us, inasmuch as it enabled us to
fill up our water, which was caught by the awning, and bailed
from the hollows of the rocks. A well was sunk 16 feet deep,
and some feet below the level of the sea at high water, but there
the soil (still of a sandy nature) was perfectly dry.
From Point Swan we proceeded towards Sunday Strait, having
previously ascertained that there was no passage fit for a vessel
of any description between that and Point Swan, the whole space
being thickly strewed with rocky islets and reefs, nearly all dry
at low water, and causing heavy races and overfalls as they became
covered at half-tide.
Owing to the unsettled state of the weather, we were obliged
to anchor at three different times under the large island on the
west side of the strait, in exposed anchorages; but this trifling
delay enabled us to complete Captain King?s plan of the place.
From these islands, which we have named Roe?s Islands (in
compliment to Lieut. Roe, who accompanied Captain King), we
proceeded to Cygnet Bay, and continued a close examination of
the coast to the southward. Many good anchorages were found,
but no appearance of streams of fresh water.
Having reached as far as Foul Point, I sent Lieutenant Stokes
with two boats to trace the shore farther to the southward, and to
gain some information as to the probable extent of the opening.
He returned on the eighth day, having succeeded in discovering
that the southern part of King?s Sound terminated in the mouth
of a river, or of an extensive lake, as at low-tide (the fall being
36 feet) the water was quite fresh alongside the boat, and running
in small streams from the southward, between the extensive flats
that were left dry by the tide, and reached from shore to shore, a
distance of 5 or 6 miles, without leaving a passage for a boat.
In consequence of tfiis information the ship was moved to the


S.E., in which direction Captain King had seen land raised by
refraction, but which was found to be only 18 miles distant, and
very low. From this point the examination of the river was con-
tinued by Lieut. Stokes and myself.
We found it to be of trifling extent; but, from the quantities of
drift-wood and weeds suspended to the trees from 12 to 15 feet
over our heads, it must be subject to immense inundations at
certain seasons of the year ; and from the lowness of the land on
each bank, as far as we could see, the whole country must then
be under water for an extent of many miles.
We proceeded about 15 miles in a straight line, S. by E., at
which place our progress was impeded by the numbers of drift-
trees that completely blocked the passage. At this point the river
was rapid, and ran in three or four small streams, occasioned by
some islets, and a number of fallen trees.
The banks were nowhere above 12 feet high, and the land on
each side perfectly level, as far as could be seen from the top of
the highest tree. Quantities of rich grass covered both banks;
and the country appeared in places to be thickly wooded.
The entrance to this river, which has been named Fitz�oy
River, in compliment to Captain R. Fitz�oy, R.N., is in lat.
17� 34' S., and long, 123� 38' E. (nearly).
During the examination of the river, a boat was employed in
tracing the shore to the eastward, which appeared to be a deep
opening, as no land was visible from the mast-head, and I
thought it not improbable that a passage might be found com-
municating with Collier Bay; but, like all the other openings we
had examined, it terminated in low flat land, thickly studded with
mangroves, amongst which the tide flows for a considerable dis-
tance ; and at low water the whole shore is fronted by extensive
flats of soft mud.
From this point the shore of the main land has been carefully-
traced as far as Port-George IV., chiefly by Lieut. Stokes, in the
boats, who is perfectly satisfied that there is no stream of any
consequence running into the sea from any part of it.
On the passage from King?s Sound to Port George IV.
we discovered a dry sand-bank, 10 or 12 feet above w r ater, and
which is not laid down in Captain King?s chart. It lies in lat,
15� 19' 20'' S., and long. 123� 35' E., being about 26 miles N.E.
by E. of Adele Island.
It lies in a direction about N.W. and S.E.; the dry part about
a third of a mile; but the whole extent of the breakers occupying
a space of about 4 or 5 miles in that direction, which appears to
be the direction of all the islands, reefs, sand-banks, and tide-
ripplings on this part of the coast, there is much uneven ground


between Adcle Island and this bank, which has been named
Beagle Bank,
I take this opportunity also of making known the discovery of
two dangers seen by Mr. Browse in the Lynher (the vessel in
which Mr. Grey and party arrived on the coast).
One is situated in lat. 15� 26' 30" S., and long. 121� 55'
and is a reef about 2 feet under water; the other is in lat. 14� 4'
S., and long. 123� SO' E. This last was fallen in with on the
second night after sailing from Timor; therefore cannot be much
out of position ; besides, the vessel was furnished with a good
chronometer. It is an island about a mile in extent, but very low,
and was not discovered until about 2 cables distant, when Mr.
Browse sounded in 10 fathoms. He afterwards sounded, when
he thought himself about a mile to the westward of it, but had no
bottom with 40 fathoms.
As we have been fortunate enough to meet Lieut. Grey and his
party, who returned from his expedition three days after our ar-
rival here, and who has kindly offered to take charge of any letters
we may wish to send, I take the opportunity ot sending this short
account of our proceedings, and merely a sketch of our work in
continuation of Captain King?s charts, as there has not been time
to lay down the work that all have been busy in collecting, and
which will require at least two quiet months to put together.
As we have now only three weeks provisions on boaid, and I
am given to understand that no supplies can be procured at
Timor, excepting for present use, and those with some difficulty,
in exchange for gunpowder only, we shall make the best ot oui
way to Swan River, where it will be necessary to refresh the crew,
who, although we have had no sickness occasioned by the climate,
which I consider equal to any in the world, will be much invi-
gorated by a change of temperature, which, since our arrival on
the coast, has rarely been below 83�, and frequently as high as
95� 5' in the shade.
After receiving supplies and refreshments at Swan River, I
shall proceed to Sidney for stores and to refit; likewise to get the
work of this cruise completed, before going to Bass Strait, the
examination of which place will afford ample employment lor the
summer months. I have the honour to be, &c.
Jno. C. Wickham, Commander.
Extract from a private letter from Captain Wickham to
Captain Beaufort:?
? I was afraid at the commencement of our survey that Captain
King?s luck was to attend us; as on the night of our anchoring off
Cape Villaret, one of those furious squalls he so well describes came


off tlie land at E.S.E., and, although we had nearly 80 fathoms of
cable out, our anchor broke like a piece of glass, and, having pre-
viously broken one at Swan River, it was no very pleasing event;
however, since that everything has favoured us. We have had
frequent communications with the natives at different places, and
all have been of a most friendly nature ; indeed, they have invari-
ably sought our acquaintance, by coming to the beach and beck-
oning to us to land; and, whenever our parties have landed,
although at times in great numbers, for the purpose of fishing,
wooding, and watering, they have never drawn back, but have
put themselves (unarmed) entirely into our power, and have never
once expressed a wish that our arms should be laid down.
Almost all that we have seen have had the two front teeth of the.
upper-jaw extracted, and all perfectly naked, with the exception
of a small grass apron.
?This appears to be a very extraordinary part of the world ; the
whole coast on the western side of King?s Sound, also the entire
coast between Roebuck Bay and Point Swan, being entirely of
sand-stone, whereas, the islands and all the high land on the
eastern side are entirely of quartz, and of so rugged an outline,
that it is a most difficult matter to proceed in any direction. The
islands are almost void of vegetation, and the whole seem to be
thrown up into such fantastical shapes, as to lead one to suppose
this part of the world to be in the last stage of utter ruin and con-
fusion. From Valentine Island (where the cliffs end) the land
is very low, and continues so to the banks of Fitz�oy river. I
am afraid that this river is never likely to become of any service,
owing to its distance from the sea, and the risk in approaching it,
occasioned by the strong tides amongst the islands of Buccaneer?s
Archipelago; but lam of opinion that, if a party is ever to reach
the interior of Australia, it must be on its banks; the wood is
nowhere so thick as to offer any impediment to such an under-
taking, and there would be a certain supply of good grass. It
appears to me that the inundations that evidently take place at
times are in no way connected with the rainy season on the coast,
as at our visit, which was immediately after the rains, there were
no recent marks of the country having been flooded; these over-
flowings might prove a serious evil, as in many places there would
be no escape but in the trees ; the bed of the river is entirely of
sand and gravel, therefore, no sickness would be likely to arise
from keeping on its banks.
I find that Mr. Grey has discovered another river at no great
distance from Prince Regent?s River, and which he thinks dis-
charges itself into the sea, somewhere between this port and Col-
lier Bay; but, as Lieut. Stokes has just returned from the exami-


nation of that piece of coast, without having seen any opening, or
anything to lead him to suppose the existence of a river, I think
it more than probable that Glenelg River loses itself in the low
land, and escapes by numerous creeks through the many man-
grove-flats by which each small bay is bounded; and it is not
improbable that it may lose itself in the boundless mangrove-
flats at the head of Stokes? Bay. From the account of Lieut.
Stokes, it appears very unlikely that any river of consequence
empties itself into the sea on this side of Collier Bay, as no drift-
trees or timber was seen by him; the tides were regular, and in
the depth of Collier Bay there was scarcely any stream of tide.
This was not the case in the entrance to Fitz�oy River, as there
the tides were very rapid; the flood ran only 4 hours, and the
ebb 8, and in King?s Sound there was a great deal of drift
timber, which increased very much as we approached the river,
and the water was quite muddy; between this and Collier Bay
the water was not even discoloured. It appears strange where
this river runs into the sea, but I am quite of opinion that it may
be lost in numerous creeks which we generally find in all man-
grove-flats, and into which it is next to impossible to penetrate in
the boats. lam very glad that we have met Grey?s party, and
that all has gone on well, as I should have been reluctant to leave
the coast without having heard of them; it is a satisfactory wind-
up to our first campaign.
? I cannot conclude this without expressing to you the entire
satisfaction I feel with respect to the manner in which all have
performed the different duties allotted to them. Stokes has
been most indefatigable. Natural history has not been forgotten
by those who have had time to attend to it.?

[When that clever old navigator Dampier was off this part of
the coast in the year 1699, he noticed the extraordinary rapidity
of the tide, which had not been the case in the higher latitudes of
this western coast, and he makes this observation, that, ? by the
great tides I met with a while afterwards, more to the N.E., I
had a strong suspicion that here might be a kind of archipelago
of islands, and a passage possibly to the south of New Holland
and New Guinea into the great sea eastward, which I had
thoughts also of attempting on my return from New Guinea.?
He did not, however, return. The examination made by Capt.
Wickham sets the question of a passage at rest; and I think the
great occasional rise of the two rivers, that of Prince Regent,
observed by Grey and Lushington, and that of Fitz�oy River,


described by Wickham, both stating it to be about 15 feet, will
fully explain the rapidity and irregularity of the tides mentioned
by Dampier, when these rivers are in a state of flood, and the
whole country adjacent inundated.
These rivers now discovered are not of sufficient magnitude to
explain the discrepancy which seems to exist between the great
land of Australia and all other continents and large islands on
the face of the globe. The drainage of these, and the rest already
known, are quite insufficient in ordinary cases to carry off the
waters of so vast a country. May not the extraordinary occasional
rise point to the old conjecture of some great Mediterranean sea?
One spot only now remains where a large river can be looked for,
and that is in the bottom of the deep and wide gulf of Carpen-
taria ; and if not there, we must either conclude that there is
some peculiarity in the construction and material of Australia, or
that the waters are collected in numerous lakes or one great sea,
and evaporated or absorbed before they reach the coast. ?
