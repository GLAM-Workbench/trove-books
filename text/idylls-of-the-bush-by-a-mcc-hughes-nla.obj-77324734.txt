fWlude.
Rare ecstacy, to none but poet known.
To softly stir the sympathetic string
Of Nature?s harp ; straight stream and forest ring
Striving humanity?s strange undertone.
The swelling diapason of the flood?
The plaintive minor cadence of the flow?
Weird wild-wave harmonies, now loud, now low.
Weave world-wide symphony with wind and wood ;
Rippling rhyme melodies with light refrain
Of life, of love, of laughter; while beneath
The mad dance music?tears, dark change, and death.
Throb in profoundest counterpoint of pain.

pro'api!
I know a grotto cut in living rock.
The stray moss drapes the moisture-dripping stone.
Half hid behind the creeper-wreathen stock
Of ancient woodland monarch ; here alone
The sultry noon is shaded into cool.
And thro? the tendril curtain garish day
Mirrors mysterious visions in the pool;
Faint in the dreaming ear and far away
Shrills the cicada's chirp, and the rich bloom
Of golden sprays, that droop from swaying wattle.
Thrills on the sense in delicate perfume ;
There found I once a vile, black empty bottle.
With vulgar flaunting label, reeking gin.
A greasy, torn newspaper ; ?but enough !
'Twas the foul trail of that slum-haunting rough,
Gipsy without romance, the Larrikin !
Can it be true ?then may I never know it ?
Australia's too commercial for a poet ?


Eupel^a:
Wk were merry that night
With song and laughter and play :
-*? am P fires shining bright,
? fiere our entrenchments lay.
Twas a high slab-fence close strung,
-Kun round in a zig-a-zag,
And over our tents there swum*
Our new .Republic's flag.
Oood true blue like the skies,
r +S 1 ?� ne of your stri P es and bars.
Just the Southern Cross, a sight for sore eyes.
In four bright silver stars.
We were merry that night,
i or Nickle had yet to come,
reckoned they?d wait to fight.
When we?d heard the tattoo drum.
Our camp was like a fair ;
The men they yarned and joked,
hying round In the open air.
Played euchre and drank and smoked.
There was the Frenchy, Le Maire,
Scraping his fiddle like mad, ? '
And many a light-heeled pair
Twirled round him, lad with lad.
There was old Dutchman Hans
Crooning of Vaterland,
And beating time on the pans
With a cooking fork in hand.
Pat, though his watch wern?t done.
Was learning us how to shoot.
Making bayonet thrusts for fun ?
At the sole of Sandy?s boot.


Sword in fist, swaggered Jed?
Same sword with which he d toast ?
Practising to cut off a head
With a turnip on a post.
Bob and Jack and I,
Seeing that we were pards.
Were quietly sitting by
Telling fortunes on the cards
? Each man cut ? says Jack
? Before Hans brings the grub
I took and shuffled the pack,
And turns a smallish club.
Diamonds stand for wealth.
And hearts for a sweetheart's kiss,
And clubs, hard work and health,
And spades, what goes amiss.
Jack hearts, he's lots o? sons ;
Then Bob says, drawing breath :
� Here goes for the King of Diamons!
?Twas the ace of spades?that's Death .
After the rest turned in,
I sat alone by the fire,
A sentry slouched by with a grin.
As I looks up to inquire.
? Red-coats is off to bed.
And forty winks never hurts ;
Safe for to-morrow," he said, ?
? Would they spoil their Sunday shirts r
I sat alone, and seemed
To have gift of second sight,
For I saw (or else I dreamed)
The strangest things that night.
9 Twas a Queen raised up on high ,
Gold-crowned , with purple robe.
And her sceptre touched the sky ,
And her footstool was the globe.
Around her throne there stood
On guard a stalwart land ,
The children of her blood
United heart and hand.


The East her splendour sent ,
The North her noblest ones,
The West her brain-craft lent ,
The South her hardy sons.
To the Motherland they turn
With fond and faithful glow,
Their face was bold and stern
Looking outward at the foe.
One undivided Nation,
With their standards all unfurled ,
In that glorious Federation
Of the English-speaking World!
I woke just as day began,
Jack pulled me by the arm ?
A cry through the sleepers ran?
? They?re coming ! Turnout! Sound alarm !?
We hurried full speed to our post,
Half dressed and half awake ;
Yes, there was a greyish host
Creeping upward like a snake.
? We?ll hold our own, never fear I?
Cried Yerne, ? Aim low! and ?fire V*
Black gaps in their ranks appear.
They waver ?they halt ?they retire.
We thought them turning to fly
And cheered; they rallied right well.
Flashed back a volley; a cry?
Bob threw up his arms and fell.
Dead ! That black ace ; understand ?
My throat felt one big lump ;
The Dealer will give him the better hand
When He plays up His last old trump.
No time to mourn for the dead.
They fired so slow and true.
Whoever exposed but a head.
Was hit before he knew.
Lalor stood up on some sand.
No general need be bolder.
Coolly giving the word of command.
Till he dropped shot through the shoulder.


Sudden as magic, a hush !
A voice rang stern and clear, ?
? Charge !? Then a dreadful rush.
And a wild, determined cheer.
Like a breaker dashes ashore
With the spray spikes on its edge.
Their line swept on with a roar ?
A bristling bayonet hedge.
Crash ! They broke through the Stockade ;
We met them and gave them pause.
Locked at close quarters, we made
Our stand for the good old cause.
Pat, Jed, and Sandy were there,
The blood trickling off them in rivers,
4t Courage, mes braves I? shrieked Le Maire,
His fiddle slung round him in shivers.
Hans fought quiet as sin.
You?d have thought him too peaceful to quarrel.
His gun broke, he wouldn?t give in
Till he?d struck down two with the barrel.
Eight in their thick rushed Jack
With me and some of our best.
We faced them, back to back,
With the cold steel at our breast.
*Twas a sight I shall ne?er forget?
The soldiers? glittering blades.
Our faces fierce and set,
And the shattered palisades ;
Fugitives running to hide.
Close chased, in the empty claims.
Cut down or captured on every side.
And the tents a mass of flames.
Down in our midst dropped the flag,
We?d sworn with life to defend,
?Twas but a scorched and tattered rag,.
But we kept it till the end.
Still we struggled like men,
When something struck my head ;
I fell in Jack?s arms, and then.
The scene whirled round blood red.


When I came to myself again.
The sun blazed in the skies;
There was no one round but the slain.
With their ghastly staring eyes,
And rifles and pistols and swords
Scattered wide on the trampled s md,
When under a pile of smouldering boards
I marked a quivering hand ;
It was Lalor; I hauled him out.
Half gone with pain and thirst;
Some stragglers heard me shout.
And we tended him the first.
We made for the rising ground?
The ranges were safe from harm?
And a surgeon was somehow found.
To dock our poor leader?s arm.
For weeks in hiding we stayed.
Till the hue-and-cry grew cold.
Not a man our lives betrayed.
In vain they offered their gold.
Jack and twelve others were tried
At Melbourne, and charged with treason.
The people were all on our side.
And to hang us wasn?t in reason.
They were each in turn acquitted.
Our cause wasn?t far from right,
We were less to be blamed than pitied ;
That?s the story of the fight.
Yes, here?s all success to their scheme
Of Imperial Federation :
Our Republic was a dream;
Yet I?ve an intimation,
However useless that skirmish seem,
?Twas the birth-throe of a Nation !


IS IS ftje Bores!

Piir)ovo;i.
Far as the blue horizon curve doth reach.
Billow on billow, the unfathomed trees.
Touched by the gentle fingers of the breeze.
Moan round, like wavelets whispering to the beach
The melancholy secrets of the seas ;
Clear in the foreground one lone gum uprears
Its giant bole, bare-headed, tempest-riven.
Like hoary sire, who hath outlived his peers.
Stands musing on the past, yet points to heaven.
Stern scene of desolation and of dearth !
?Tis of dim old-world history a page.
Bearing the imprint of Creation?s birth :
Last-born of Nations ! Is thy heritage ?
Strange thought?the skeleton of Titan earth ?


@7l B&pr) QA(zvj,
Too solemn are these fern groves, too austere,
For prankish revelry of Satyr rude ;
Dare lily-crowned nymph wreathe dances nude,
Or frenzied Mcenad, whirl wild orgy here.
The dim, mysterious shrine of Solitude ?
What pagan Presence immemorial
Bodes hence its oracles ? The thought defiles
These chastely carven shafts, whose cloistered ai-les
Trace Gothic arch on fronded capital.
Eich groined with fretted foliage, and crowned
By stately minster-vault of azure air.
What tho? no sob from deep-souled organ sound ?
No pallid priest pour penitential prayer ?
Fall to thy knees ; thou stand?st on holy ground !

What say? You can?t loss the track ! It?s plain as a
pikestaff before ye.
No ? Want to know what that cross is for, cut in the blue
gum ?
Well, if you?re not push?d for time, I?m the man to tell you
the story.
Stranger bout here ??No offence. ?You?ve rather the look
of a new chum.
Tim Brown and me, one mornin* ten year back, were after
a bullock.
Fine three-year-old, what strayed in the bush, and the
boss cut up skimpy.
Quietly ridin? along, an? smokin? an? cussin? MacCulloch?
He were our boss then, ?s gone home with his pile, you?ll
know he?s an Im-Pe?
Tim sez to me, sez he, ? Hev you got any lights ?ny wheres
on ye ?
Dern?d if this baccy ?ull draw,? and I went a-fumblin?
and gropin?;
Both on us look?d rather blue, for I hedn?t a matchbox
upon me.
Tim sez again, ? Here?s luck ; there?s a chap camp?d cut
in the opin.?
There, true enough, lay a man wrapp?d up in an old yellow
blanket.
Close up agen that gum, and the ash of a fire before him.
i Takin it easy ? ? sez I. ?If we rouse him, he ought for
to thank it.
Sun?s up an hour, ? sez Tim. Sez I, " He?ll hev had a
good snore, Tim.
Mebbe, he d join in a billy of tea, or a decentish damper;
Likely he?s short o? tucker, and I?m that hungry, it?s
crazin?.
hat ho ! matey,? sez I. ? Wake up, we?re goin? to camp
yer.
Preps you can loan us a light, an? we?ll soon hev the fire
a-blazinV?
Never an inch he budg?d, the? I waited nigh on a minute ;
Tim sat suckin? his pipe, as he?d give all the world for a
whiff on


I gets down from the horse, for I guess?d there was somethin?
in it,
Pulls off the blanket an? looks, an? cries, ? Good Lord !
he?s a stiff un ! ?
u Gone right bung ? ? sez Tim. So I feels his heart; it
warn?t heatin?.
Nothin? much left but skin an? bone, an? his clothes worn
and tatter?d.
4t Guess, Tim,? sez I, ? the pore chap is done with drinkin?*
an? eatin.
He?s few enough duds on his back to sleep out in.? Not
that that matter?d.
Let?s run over his swag, an? see who he is?where he got
?em.?
u Right,? sez Tim. So we lift him, an? both overhaul?d
his pockets.
Pannikin?s all that we found, that were chockful of holes at
the bottom ;
Round his neck was one of them big, round, old-fashion?d
lockets.
"Well, we opens it, Tim an? me. Inside was a picter?
Gal about twenty, I think; but there, sir, 1 ain?t a scholer;
Never a lass I see in all my life that hev lick?d her.
Pretty ? Why, that ain?t the word. She?d hev whipp?d a
cherubin holler.
Hair shiny yeller, like gold, an? great big eyes, an? such
blue uns?
Just them eyes that are death in foolin? an? leadin? a lad on :
Such an innercent face ! Sez I, ? Tim, she?s one o? the true
uns.?
" Bet your life,? sez Tim, ?a girl with that face ain?t a
bad un?.?
Who was the gal ? I dunno. You see thet?s no business of ours.
Tell you, though, what I?m sure ?it warn?t his mother or
sister.
Tim didn?t speak for a bit, starin? hard, an? he sez, ? By the
Powers!
Angels is scary of earth ; she?s in heav?n.? Thet were
Tim?s notion, mister.
Alebbe she was his sweetheart, an? neither hed got any
money ;
An? he comes right out here in hopes of makin? his fortchin.


Lord! Most newcomers thinks this land flows milk and
honey.
When the soil?s as dry as a bone, an" the sun above?s thet
scorchin?*
Mebbe they quarrell?d, an? mebbe they med her marry the
wrong un :
Mebbe ?twere he went wrong ; there?s hundreds of ways
for trouble ?
There, I mustn?t run on, or I?ll make the story a long un.
Tim an? me we roll?d him in his blanket, folded double,
Dug a hole just there, laid him in, an? cover?d him under,
Crossin? his hands on his breast, an? puttin? the locket
betwixt ?em.
Tim, he cuts that cross with his knife, a regular wonder!
Eight good mate were Tim, but a drop o? religion mix?d him.
Sometimes I?ve thought since, an? so?s my old woman Nancy,
It?s playin? it low on a man to die like a drought-
foundered wether;
Never a pal, let alone his lass, by. I?d like for to fancy,
Somewheres, in some better country, they?re hand in
hand together.
Well, when we?d finish?d the job, I plump?d pretty quick
into saddle;
Tim kept moonin? around, and lookin? uncommonly silly.
So I shouts, u Mate, look sharp ! ? An? as he were gettin?
a-straddle,
I see him slip in his pocket thet pore dead fellow?s old billy.
?G?win to make tea in a sieve?? sez I, jokin?. His
answer warn?t civil;?
A 1 pardner were Tim, tho?; I wish I knew more of his
kidney; ?
Sulk?d all the rest o? the ride, an? said, once or twice low.
? Pore divil!?
What?s come to Tim ? Oh, he?s dead-got thrown hurdle-
racin?, down Sydney.
There, I?ve bin keepin? you standin? a long sight more nor
I meant to.
Preps you?ve a good stretch to go ? Good day ? ?Good
day. ?Your nag?s rare and frisky.
Hi! Mind you stop at the house by the crik, an? say thet
I sent you ;
And then, if Nance is about, she?ll give you a toothful of
whiskey.


ecpcl |2)�ur)cl Jin)
Know old u Homeward Bound ? Jim ?
Stop a sec.; just hand a light over.
Yes, sir ! I think I know him.
Old mate, is that same Jimmie Dover.
Officer fellow at hum ;
Went the pace, broke dead, ?course he sail yer.
Gold fever days. As a chum.
There weren?t his match in Australia.
Gentleman born and bred.
If his anticedents were shady ;
Eegular fine figure-head,
And hands as white as a lady.
No keener sportsman you?d find.
From a kangaroo drive down to rattin?,
And when he got very blind.
He?d sing you a love song in Latin.
Knew how to handle his fives,
Yet never the least overbearin?;
When he got mad, it was knives.
He could trump over three men in swearin?.
?Tom,? he would say (we?d a claim
At Bendigo), ? I ain?t done my duty !
I wants to redeem my name.
Go hum rich, and marry my beauty.?
Lord! how he?d dig and he?d wash.
Black with mud and with sweat, like a pigger.
Early and late, and no bosh !
A model industrious digger.
One day his pick hits a lump ;
? Quartz !? sez I, as he stooped for to tug it;
I feels my heart fairly jump,
When he screams, (t Thank God ! it?s a nugget! ?
We?d each two cool thous., that same.
When we came for to do the dividin?.
Jim hands me over his claim.
And next mornin? starts homeward a-ridin?.


Got down to Melbourne all right,
And went and painted the town red;
?Champagne and euchre all night;
Got kick'd out in a week, least so Brown said.
Anyways, back there he comes,
A reg?lar disreputable figure.
Sez, ? Tom, let?s in ?gain as chums.
Voyage hum wants a vast more to rig her.?
Well, we works for a while.
And had just a luck that was tidy ;
Never exactly strikes ile.
So Jim hit on another grand idee.
Soon as he?d saved up some tin.
He sets up a pub on the trail yer ;
Develops a weakness for gin.
And goes smash in six months; ?nother failure !
Out as a bookie he rips,
There weren?t no long odds but he?d lay for it;
Alius had wonderful tips.
Cock-sure ?bout some dark stable favourite.
Somehow, thinks I, that won?t pay,
Though he swore he was goin? on swimmy;
He cut his stick sudden one day ;
I lost sight for a bit of old Jimmy.
Met him next time at the docks,
An? shouts, " Hello, mate; what?s yer doin? ??
He were port?rin? a passenger?s box,
But chirps, "I?m a long spell off ruin.?
Sez I, ? Goin? home, sir, in course ??
Sez he, with a kind of a snigger,
a I?ll wait a bit, yet, old horse,
?Til my pile gets a size or two bigger.?
Sez I, ? Come up for a glass.?
As a toast, I sez, ? Jim, you?re a strong ?un,
But I thinks, without any gas.
The first hum that you?ll land is your long ?un.?
There now, it?s puffectly clear,
Jim wasn?t the man for to fail ye.
Has Jim gone hum yet ? No fear!
He?s keepin? a gate on the railw?y.

Crimson roses hail the time
Of our tryst with scented greeting;
Daffodillies softly chime
Golden bells for lovers? meeting.
Quivering into dreams of love,
Violets veil their maiden faces ;
Creamy banksia above
Trellised framework round her traces.
*
Little grave, yet dainty face.
Eyes that droop with wistful yearning,
Lashes dark, with weary grace.
Shade the lights in dim depths burning.
Cheeks aflush, like pale moss rose,
Hair in sun-stirred ripples sheening;
Night, in passionate repose.
Grey and still is o?er her leaning.
Hope ! Fair Seraph from heaven?s gate;
Lone Despair ! Dark cowled Friar ;
Read me truly, read my fate,
Pluck love?s blossom ?feel love?s briar.
Poses cluster close to hear,
Lilies bow their heads in waiting;
Sore suspense, ?twixt hope and fear,
Thrills each petal palpitating.
Mine ! For heart is lost in heart.
In sweet rapture of emotion.
Like two streams which rise apart.
Twine and faint to purple ocean.

Mine till death !?whatever comes.
And the ages that are after :
Breezes wake the brooding gums
Into silvery bursts of laughter.
Lilies offer incense meet,
Eoses red hearts rend asunder
Showering fragrance at her feet;
Violets peep in modest wonder.
Falling stars of jessamine,
To the waters waft the story;
Sea and sky with smile divine,^
Glide round listening earth in glory.


�/I |Bus J) B ipe
t ires ain?t much of account ? I dunno ; they?re right this
cold weather ;
Bush fires ? That?s quite different j its pretty clear
you?re a stranger.
Liz, run out o? the room,?shut door?now us two?s together,
111 tell you something I know, and you can judge if
there?s danger.
Sixteen year back we come to the bush, and tuk up this
selection.
Me and my wife Jinny; there warn?t scarce three acre o?
clearin??
Derbyshire man I am, had a shop with a tidy connection,
limes got bad, we left home?Liz came wi? the next new
year in.
Liz were on three year old, and that summer were hot as an
ov en j
Everything dry as a chip ; one day I were out timber
loppin?
Close to the swamp; (we?d done well, though the farm
tuk a sight of improvin?)
Happy as any two kings, while the sweat kep? pourin? and
droppin?.
Gibson?s boy tears up,?a fine young beggar o? sivin?
Says, ? Here?s a lark ! The trees is afire,?? and were off
in a second.
I never thinks o? the lad, though the last as see him livin?.
No ! I ran for the house, sort o? sure it were worse nor
he reckoned.


Ran as if for my life; a strong north wind were a-blowin?;
Smoke came pourin' in clouds, like snuff i' your eyes.
downright cruel.
Thick as a fog; overhead I hears flocks o? parrots a-goin?,
Screechin? like creeturs possessed; the bush was just
ready-laid fuel.
Soon as I cleared to the open, I fairly staggered?the valley
One gret sea o? fire, wi' the flames leapin' higher and
higher.
Clean 'bove the tops o' the trees, and runnin' like light
thro' the mallee.
Shooting up sparks like rockets; the crik itself seemed
afire !
Down 'twixt the house and me, were a stretch o' long
withered rye-grass,
?Fore I were half down the bank, that were bare and
covered wi? pebble,
Fire came and cut between, and I see wi?out call for a
spy-glass.
Farm, out-buildings and all, flare up like a handful o?
stebble.
Less than a minute after I marks the wife and the daughter.
Wife were making for me, and I thought it rare plucky?
rather!
Wadin' through red hot ash knee-deep as if it were water,
Holdin' our Liz ?bove her head, and the bairn was sayin?
? Our Father."
Fearfully burnt i' the legs she were, I knew she were dyin?.
Both soles scorched right off ?like an old shoe bust from
the upper;
Liz were sound as a bell, and bless her ! she warn't even
cryin'.
Only kep' sayin?, ? Poor Mammie," and ? Dada, baby
wants supper."


Dozens o? times I struck off for help, whole place were hot
cinder;
Three whole days she laid with the child, we?d hardly a
mossel.
Time after time I limps back, my clothes droppin? from me
in tinder;
Patient she laid, poor lamb ! and smiled like a ,dyin?
apostle.
Fourth day, early, she called me, and tuk my hand and she
held me.
? Good-bye, John,? says she, ? come soon. Til wait by yon
Gate, dear,? ?
Party got through wi? relief, fetched doctor and food, so
they?ve telled me,
Found me holdin? the child ; for the wife they were hours
too late here.
Thutteen year come December she diedthere mister?
beg pardin ;
Rum ! when I thinks o that smoke, ev?n now it maks my
eyes water;
Died !?my poor lass don?t move; I?ll just tak a turn i?
the gardin ;
Mebbe whatever you want, you won?t mind callin? the
daughter.

Secret.
I?ye a truthful reputation, boss, as you can well believe,
For a native-born gumsucker isn?t given to deceive.
And as in shoutin' nobblers you?ve proved so very free,
I?ll spin you a true anecdote, wot happened once to me.
Two miles above the crossin?, there?s a station, Dimbooloo,
That was regular infested by a giant kangaroo,
Wot played up perfect terror with the pasture for the sheep,
Ancl it never came in gunshot ?is a weasel caught asleep ?
You could hunt him, he?d romp over a six-foot fence o? logs.
Then squatted cool and picked his teeth, till overtook by
dogs,
When he?d work his hinder digits with a sky-entific scoop,
And you found your pups curled neatly in a sorter flabby
loop.
He stuck up Biddy Flanagan one night when all alone ?
She?s a widdy nigh on fifty, and would ride some twenty
stone,
(Which proves that kangaroos in love have well developed
taste) ?
And he well-nigh scared her into fits by huggin? on her
waist.
?Twern?t embracin? that she minded ; the thing wot scared
her most,
She took it for a visit from her dear departed?s ghost; #
And he didn?t use to hug her, bar he came home very tight.
And that, preliminary to a rough-and-tumble fight.


I guess he cotched a Tartar, she?s a decent pair o? lungs.
And ?tain?t old men like him alone gets frit by women?s
tongues;
Anyway we found her safe, imbibing whiskey on a bank.
And there arn?t a blessed saint in heaven she didn?t take
and thank.
One night when arter cattle I got bushed ; ?twas black as
black.
The horse fell lame, I had to walk and fumble out 'the
track,
When that long-legged beast rose sudden just beside a
boxwood clump.
And I took it for old Nick and gave a blarmed almighty
jump.
Horse reared, and turned, and skooted, like it was fresh
from grass;
T?other flopped for me like a big dog (there wern?t no room
to pass),
A-bowin? and a-scrapin? like a Chinee when he?s sacked.
And thinks I, ? Old chum, your biz?ness will be settled in
one act.?
It?s a creepy sort of feelin?, boss, to hob-a-nob with death !
(Eh ??well just to oblige you.?Here?s luck ! ?l?m out of
breath.)
In a fit of desperation, I lifts my long stock-whip,
And sez, ? ?Fore I goes under, you bet! I?ll make you skip.?
Clean as a penny whistle, that lash snipped off his head !
I reasonably expected the brute would tumble dead.
But he ?you won?t believe it, and it?s fact, boss, wot I say?
Slipped his head in his breast pocket and calmly sloped
away !
And they say ?bout here you?ll see him still a-loafin? round
at night.
And if he meets a lady, he will raise his head polite,
But should it be a stockman with a ten-foot lash instead.
He doesn?t stop inquiring, but he tries to hide that head!
Well I?ll take it without sugar, as you are so very kind ;
I?ve a truthful reputation, boss, and always bears in mind,
That tho? the world is round as round, we must act on the
square ;
So I calls my little history, a Bomer; ?so it air !

What profit, eagle-hearted Pioneers,
To pierce the dry heart of the stony wild.
Out-living toil and want, your hopes your fears.
And when hard-won success too late had smiled.
Die ; ?with no hand to soothe, no voice to cheer ?
The evergreen monotony of wood,
True funeral plumes, may round your deathbeds stand*
Your very graves be lost in shifting sand.
The sullen desert o?er your bleached bones brood.
The brazen firmament let fall no tear;
Yet ?tis not wholly vain for others? good.
Ye freely lavished all that men prize best ?
Brain, fortune, life ; ?beyond that last dark flood
In Land of golden promise have ye rest.

What penance, self-imposed, drove thee to dwell
Far from thy fellows ? Was there one fair maid.
Who grew thy world, and cast thee forth betrayed
To hide thy sore wound in this lonely dell ?
What sin-flushed passion ? Or red barricade,
Where Freedom brief defies the tyrant?s chain.
Fulfilling patriot?s dreams ? Or gnawing pain
Of blood-stained conscience, sered with fires of hell P
What blight of some unmerited disgrace,
O solitary stranger ? ?Who can tell ?
Whate?er thy woe, thy fault, thy soul had space
In sweet adversity to kiss the rod.
Thy burden bore too heavy ; ?now ?tis well;
Thy life with all its secrets is with God.

Of all Australian careers.
I?d recommend to anxious stranger.
Most honourable far appears
The trade of a high-class bushranger.
You?ll need a smack of Eobin Hood,
The pluck, that goes to make a hero,
Some strange relapses into good.
And freaks of heartlessness like Nero.
Practice is best of antidotes
To combat scruples, that may tease ye.
With practice cutting people?s throats
Becomes monotonously easy.
Well, when your hand and heart are nerved
To rob a church without compunction.
In short th? apprenticeship is served ;
These hints may aid your (k)nightly function.
Eegarding dress ; ??tis scarce worth while
To put on mediaeval armour,
When you?ve but to abstract the pile
Of an intoxicated farmer.
A scarlet shirt looks very chaste
On one, who paints a township gory;
P?raps quiet black?s in better taste,
When hurling trainloads slap to glory.
Like wise philosopher condole
With plundered miser?s indignation.
But prove ?tis better on the whole
His coin?s restored to circulation.
Ease the flush digger of his bag.
Nor heed him if he sweareth madly.
Your comfort, as you pouch the swag.
To know he would have spent it badly.


To stick a bank up, I conceive,
Breeds stores of cheerful meditation.
How kind an action to relieve
The poor cashiers from sore temptation.
Be above all philanthropist.
And help the poor man to a living,
The happy medium to assist
Those who are rather shy of giving.
Strike no alarms in ladies? breast.
Who advertise gold-smiths at races.
Praise ? beauty unadorned ? as best.
And gild with smiles their ravished faces.
Whate?er stray troopers you may meet.
Destroy them as you fit determine.
Except to ornament a street.
They're quite unnecessary vermin.
Two special dangers I must name:
The first, a love for potent waters ;
The second ?tho? it's hard to blame?
Undue complaisance to Eve's daughters.
?Tis patent that the flowing bowl
Dulls keenest wits till fools can match you,
And sweethearts love Delilah's role
And set the Philistines to catch you.
With proper care this grand career,
Proverbially, both short and merry.
Lasts long, and you need only fear
A f battue 9 most extraordinary.
'Twill take a thousand men in blue.
To bag you, not to count black trackers;
And p'raps a regiment or two,
And half the colony as backers.
Handcuffs and escorts don?t look well,
But then th? unpleasant part's soon over;
You?ll live confined in prison cell,
Comparatively quite in clover.
The recollection of your acts,
Is in itself a satisfaction.
And every post will bring you tracts
To keep your spirits from re-action.


Your trial to an average man
Will seem a grand apotheosis.
Your counsel may do all he can
To prove you?re meek and mild as Moses :
Plead, ?Noble Anger drove to crime,
(Excuse as good as any other)
? For somehow, somewhere, at some time
Someone insulted your grandmother !
The jury will reject this view.
As slurring your true reputation,
The judge will gently break to you
Their verdict of disapprobation.
I?m really loth to say ? Good-bye ! ?
Your last hour?s tolling from the steeple !
Reflect how few like you may die
In sympathy with all good people.
Courage ! Your memoirs shall give tone
To a literature that makes an ass sick.
The reading public won?t disown
A genuine Australasian classic.
Romance, that runs staid Virtue down.
And in revenge a convict hallows,
Will fain bestow a martyr?s crown
On the grim drop-scene of the gallows.


Only a year! Why it seems an age.
Since the night on which we parted;
Fool! to misread the future?s page ;
Yet we both were broken-hearted.
Was it an omen the moon turned dark.
As our troth was given and taken ?
Did I imagine a poor station clerk
Could not be for a lord forsaken ?
An English lord, with a long pedigree,
A manor in history olden,
A nobleman, polished, and grand and free,
And in all but the purse-strings?golden.
Lords can worship the golden calf.
For all their coronet?s glamour ;
Pocket their pride and forbear to laugh
At Parvenus? old-world grammar.
Yet I can pardon a simple girl
Who yields to a titled wooer;
The commonest courtesies of an earl
Thrill, with.hidden meaning, through her.
But why should the flower of our maidenhood
Deck far lands, like forced exotic ?
Has not Australia men as good ?
Such bridals were patriotic !
Why do we boast of our pet ? Protection ?
To keep out the foreign invader ?
Guard native products in each direction.
While Love is a false freetrader P
Sweet was her love ! Though another?s bride,
Why should I wish to forget her ?
Why should I hate her new possessor ?
Time must her choice and my lot decide.
By Jove ! The postman with a letter !
Her handwriting !?? They?re starting back.?
She refused the lord ! ? ?That?s better. ?
? I?ve not forgotten my promise to Jack ! ?
God bless her !

?Twas Sunday; the diggers were pouring
In and out of the bar in the bush.
Drinking and fighting and roaring.
When sudden there fell a hush.
?Twas hut a lark that was singing,
In a wicker cage on the wall;
But his voice through the room went ringing,
For he sang to the heart of all.
The old, ever-welcome story.
Bubbled out from his quivering throat.
Of his far-off home and its glory,
Till they hung on every note.
For he sang of the sun-glow early
On the tops of the whispering trees ;
Of the dew in the flowercups pearly.
And dumb murmuring of bees.
Green lanes, with their winding hedges,
?Neath arched avenues of limes;
The brook, with its reeds and sedges.
And the mill-wheel?s plashing chimes.
The breath of fresh woodland posies.
Hawthorn and lush meadowsweet.
Honeysuckle and wild white roses,
And red poppies in the wheat.
The ploughboyVsong to his horses ;
The scent of the new-stirred clod;
The willowy watercourses,
And the swirl of the angler?s rod.
Pink orchards, with mossy railing ;
Homefields, with broad hayswathes brown ;
The coppice of Scotch firs veiling
The smoke haze over the town.


The gleam on the grey church tower ;
The yews round the daisied graves ;
The moorland, purple with shower.
And the rainbow out on the waves.
He sang of the dear home faces
That smile, as in days long fled.
Of a lost love's winsome graces,
And soft memories of the dead,
Till his song touched the gate of heaven,
In a burst of praise and prayer.
Breathing sense of sins forgiven ;
And trembled to silence there.
And the rugged bushmen linger.
As though they were loth to part;
For a song from the soul of a singer
(jroes straight to the listener?s heart.


Here, you ! Drop that stone !? Twere you I see a-slingin?.
Only a blarmed Chinee ? What right have you to oppress
Peel off your coat like me ; do credit to your upbringin?.
Put up your hands. Now, mate. Pm goin? to larn you a
lesson.
Tidyish crack, that were ; it well nigh stove your rib in.
There?s the claret bung drawn from your ill-conditioned
smeller.
Don?t try kickin?, ole boss, but stick to English fibbin?.
Right cross-counter under the chin; how?s that, ole feller ?
-Guess this should lay you out; have you had enough, you
varmin ?
Sure! ?Well, you lie there, and cool yourself in the
gutter.
Peace and goodwill?s my text; I?m going to spin you a
sarmin;
Peace and goodwill, d?ye hear ? I?ll crack your skull if
you mutter.
I knew a Chinaman once, he lived nigh us in the gully.
Had a fair bit of a garden, with lots of market stuff in;
Me and my mates had a down on him, ?I were a dreadful
bully ?
Shook the poor beggar?s apples, and hunted him round
for nuffin.


We was on the bust one day, when we corned across him ;
Went for him, like one man, and stripped him almost
naked.
Tied him up to a stump,?we hadn?t no blanket to toss him ?
Cut off his pigtail and burnt it, he?d rather died than
we?d take it.
Not so long after that, I gets took bad with typhus.
None of my pals came nigh, they was all darned sight
too scary,
Left me to rot like a sheep, and none to care how my life
vyos :
All the same I had, as the story-books say, my good fairy.
Ah Chack, none else that were, the Chinee ; he heard I
was dyin?.
Nussed and sat up watchin?, like him and me were
brothers.
Kept things straight and cooked with me there helpless
lyin'.
Touchin? me with his hand, that were softer far than my
mother?s.
Took on as bad as bad when the doctor thought me croakin,
Brought me grapes and peaches to eat from that same
garden,
When I picked up, wouldn?t take no return oh, I?m not
jokin?;
Chap as hates a Chinee arter that,?s a dev?lish hard un.
Well! For your black eye, try a slice of raw pertater.
And afore you gets up, just mark my words, young feller;
Charity?s one thro? the world and so is human natur?,
Makes not a cuss of odds, if a man?s skin?s white or yeller!

The night and the wind conspire to blind
The horse and the rider?s form;
Jagged lightnings trace the Devil?s face
Grim grinning thro? gloom and storm.
Loud thunder roars and a deluge pours
Through the thin pent-house of gums ;
And the chill of death chokes the traveller?s breath
And every limb benumbs.
But the rain had ceased, when his weary beast
Breasts the Haunted Gully?s slope,
And he thought of the tale of the suicide pale,
And the blasted tree with the rope.
And sudden he'stops and the bridle drops :
Oh ! what sound rings through the air ?
*Tis an eldritch yell, as though demons from hell,
Were holding a Sabbat there !
And straight on his sight blazed a fire-pile bright,
Flames flickering green and blue.
And round and round, half in air?half on ground,
Whirls a wild Walpurgis crew.
Are they ghosts of the dead, raised from burial red,
In the secret graves of crime ?
Or convicts of old, who to Satan sold
Their souls for this weird good time ?
Are they witches, whose pride hath salvation denied
For broomsticks, black tom-cats, and owls ?
Or the tars and the skipper of doomed Phantom Ship ?
Arabian Afreets and ghouls ?
Lo ! A skeleton band dance hand in hand ;
Bare skulls gleam with fiery eyes,
Their ribs ghastly white with uncanny light.
And a gruesome music sighs.


But the tired horse neighed;?swift the death-round stayed,
And the rider?s heart turned cold;
For the tallest came, blood-red in the flame,
To welcome that mortal bold.
He fled at a canter, like douoe Tam o? Shanter
Rode frae th? auld kirk o? Ayr,
And a wild burst of laughter, came floating after,
Adding wings to his despair.
His spur rowels sank in his steed?s steaming flank,
And the flint-flakes flash fire from its feet,
And they thunder and thud through water and mud
In that midnight flight so fleet!
Soon he reaches a hut, hammers hard with whip-butt,
Half-crazed with unearthly fears;
A light shines inside, the door opens wide ;
An old man with a bottle appears.
He stopped not to ask, seized and emptied the flask.
Then fainted as dead as a nail;
The horse stares and eyes this fuss with surprise,
And scornfully whisks his tail.
He awoke on a bed, and shrieked out and said: ?
? Are them devils a-chasin? me P?
And the old man replied ? you?ll have to be tied,
You?ve got proper hot D.T.
Guess J.D.K.Z. sent you off your head.?
? ?Tain?t the drink, man, made me ill!?
Then he pours out his tale, all trembling and pale ;
And the old man sat very still.
?Ye confounded fool! Where did ye go to school ?
Ye cowardly new-chum skunk !
Ye?ve seen just the bobbery o? some blacks? corroboree,
And ye?re nearly dead with funk !?
Then that youth arose and resumed his clothes.
And kind of faded away.
In a back seat curled, and sick of the world
For many and many a day.

Though the text?s not in the Bible
Take a pen and score it down :
? God Almighty made the country,
But the Devil made the town ! ?
Melbourne cannot spell out Nation,
Towns are but the country?s brain ;
One bold pioneer in Gippsland?s
Worth ten clerks in Flinders Lane.
Plant out London in Sahara,
In a twelve month it would fail,
Or drag on a sorry tadpole?
Dropsied head, consumptive tail.
Cutting tracks to open back blocks.
Bridging streams without a name,
Paves the broad highway of glory?
Hears triumphal arch for fame.
?Tis the struggle with stern Nature
Stamps the hall-print on brave men.
And the plough cuts deeper landmarks
Than the scratch of office pen.
Less to make a barren sovereign
Multiply its barren score.
Than to raise one wheat-ear golden,
Where bare desert howled before.
Less to found a lordly mansion
On a speculative rush.
Than to store one hole with water.
Or reclaim one patch of bush.


Is the backbone of a nation
Found in city smoke and din ?
Narrow-chested counterjumper,
Lazy loafing larrikin ?
Can our march in peaceful progress,
Can our firm defence in war.
Lie with the luxurious loungers
Of the billiard room and bar ?
He?s a man, whose sweat and labour
Turn a wilderness to home;
Had it lain with attic tenants.
Little had been heard of Rome.
He?s a man, whose toil?s reflected
In each field?s familiar form ;
Not the rats that foul the vessel,
To desert her in a storm.
He?s a man, whose roots strike deepest
In the soil whereon they grew ;
Not the city population.
Ever shifting, ever new.
Little Bourke Street?s not salvation
Subsidised by Government;
Every rich contented people
Owe their rise to discontent.
Discontent, with more than hunger.
Higher aims than quenching thirst;
Why in slum stay rank outsider
In the bush an easy first ?
Lay to heart two grand bush maxims
(All the rest is pluck and push)
? Good wine needs no bush to boom it! ?
And ? Don?t beat about the bush ! ?
Value most true independence.
Sure and golden are its gains;
Honest work can beat prospecting.
Taxed from other people?s brains.


Bees can fill tlieir hives with honey ;
And communities of ants
Seem to pick a tidy living,
Without Parliament free grants .
To the country ! To the country !
There there?s room for millions more ;
When the land is fully conquered.
We?re a Nation ; ?not before !
Yes, a Nation, bold as eaglet
Soaring high on new-fledged wing.
Strong, with strength of a young lion,
Crouching close for first fierce spring.
And when Europe?s forced to reckon
With the Southern Hemisphere,
Mind ! Old England is our granny ?
Our own Motherland is here!

?Twas on a Christmas evening, when the sun had lost its
heat,
We?d been to a fern gully for a pic-nic as a treat,
And we?d all had tea together?the children, wife, and I
And she?d been telling fairy tales to make the time go by.
She told that nursery favourite, ? The Babes lost in the
Wood.?
How their pious guardian uncle, who wasn?t any good.
Hired two infernal larrikins to kill them out of hand,
While he annexed their property in houses and in land.
How those mates went for each other as to how to do the
job.
And the big one fetched the little one a settler on the nob ;
And soothed the frightened children, saying ? You?ve no
call to cry,
He?s safe in Abr?ham?s bosom, where you?ll both be bye-
and-by.?
How he swore he?d fetch ?em lollies, if their whimpering
they?d hush.
And made straight tracks and left ?em to camp out in the
bush.
How they wandered and they wondered, till they lay down
side by side.
With their flowers and their blackberries, and pined away
and died,
(Poor innocent wee babbies not to know that man
deceives!)
And the little robin red-breasts took and covered ?em with
leaves.
Then I went to fetch the buggy, to drive by moonlight
back,
And all the rest were ready;?but where were May and
Jack?
I sat and held the horses, and as they were not found,
Slung considerable quantities of blasphemy around.
I went myself and searched, for it had closed in pitchy
dark,
I reckoned they were hiding to surprise us for a lark.
They?re playing those lost Babes !? cried wife, and then I
feared the worst.
And all her foolish fairy-tales I free and feeling cursed.


We roused up all the neighbours, for the wife could get no
We made up a search party, and we summoned the police.
We wired off for black trackers, when our efforts proved no
Two days�and nights, we sought in vain the new Babes in

And helmed to take an interest in his work, as well he
As we wentalong together he kept reading off the sign:
How at first they?d run alongside, hand in hand, in a bee-line,
THUhe little girl got tired out, and dragged a way behind.
And her brother tried to carry her; and bread crumbs

tipped Erppfy.
Pm just glad to be back in the busli.
You won?t hear again of my leaving ;
England?s not bad at a push.
If the weather were not so deceiving.
There?s nothing in London you?ll find
You cannot get better in Melbourne ;
They may be a bit more refined
And of course there are more of the swell-born.
Regent Street?s their great boast, as you know.
It might be much straighter and clearer ;
The ? Block ? to my mind has more ?? go,?
And our shops are as large and far dearer.
I cannot say much for ? the Row,?
It cuts a respectable figure;
It?s just like our Albert Park show
On Fridays, though possibly bigger.
That ? Tower ??s an eyesore to an age
That lives as ours does at high pressure,
I?ve seen lots of scenes on the stage.
Just as good, and the paint looked much fresher.
St. Paul?s is the worst of ? dead-beats,?
With a great empty dome for a steeple ;
And you can?t find ? the City ? for streets,
And you can?t find the streets for the people.
Their Parliament House?s a fair size,
As far as I cared to remark it;
The M.?sP. with their airs and their cries,
Are like cockies in old Paddy?s market.
They?ll talk the hind leg off a horse;
If it comes to a fight, why they funk ?em ;
If Europe came for us, of course.
We?d lay Europe out with our bunkum.


The bridges are all very well
And yet for the traffic they?re narrer,
A thing we won?t have for a spell
At the new Princes bridge on the Yarra.
Theayters ? The seats cost a lot;
That Irving?s not half a bad clown, Sii,
The pieces are most of them rot?
Nellie Stewart would bring the house down. Sir .
Every one under a lord . , ,
Thinks to travel first-class downright wicked,
Why a bishop can only afford
To run to a second-class ticket.
The servants are humble as mice,
They?ll stand an amount of abusing,
You never need say a thing twice, .
They?ve no backbone like ours for refusing.
If you chaff with the ladies, they smile.
Lisp ? Original!? ? Awfully funny !
And whisper aloud all the while,
� is he married ?? and ? Has he got money ?
The gentlemen seldom get tight.
Their manners are terribly starchy ;
If you state your opinion outright.
Their eyebrows curl up sort of archy.
They?re a far from intelligent set.
Though books and " high culchaw their glory are,
For lots of the scholars I met.
Had never once heard of Victoria .
An art show of ? old masters ??s their pride?
I wouldn?t run them for a salary,?
I prefer, though I?ve not been inside.
Our own little National Gallery.
Their Standard's let down by our Age,
If the Times is ahead of the Argus ;
One Australian novel I?ll wage
Out-horrors ten " dreadfuls ? by Fargus.


The ? Derby? ?s no patch on our a Cup,?
Though the horses are certainly slapping;
ITI own I did once get stuck up
Over cards, when they caught me a -Napping.
Their cricket, they say, theyVe a face.
Is tile ?hub? of their national honour;
W. G. might be tried for a place
In a team beside Spofforth or Bonnor.
Beach made a hatful each night
As the greatest attraction they?d going;
How the Cockneys rolled up for a sight
Of a chap, who knew something of rowing.
Yes ! England?s a wonderful nation,
To say any less would be shabby.
She licks us in big population.
Beer, paupers, and?Westminster Abbey !


IS f�
Tht time is yet to come; and in thy hand
Lies thy success or failure ; for the deeds
Of rising nations are as broadcast seeds.
To crown with golden harvest-time the land,
Or blight its fairest promise with foul weeds.
Yea ! fraught with destiny, for weal, or woe.
Is every tree that to the bushman yields,
Each acre won to the reclaimed fields,
Each friend close-knitted and unmasked each foe !
Poised is thy scale?to conquer or succumb
United shalt thou rise, divided fall!
Let selfish fears, vain jealousies be dumb,
One mighty Heart shall pulse the trumpet call:
? Australia, advance ! Thy time is come ! ?
