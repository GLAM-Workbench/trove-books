The Federation of British Australasia:
A Sketch from a Political and an Economic Point of View.
[Paper Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science,
"a Meeting in Sydney, N.S.W., January, 1898.]
By J. T. Walker
(One of the Representatives of New South Wales in the Australasian
Federal Convention, 1897-8).
1. The Encyclopedia Britannica defines “ Australasia ” thus: —
One of the six great geographical divisions of the Globe, is situated, as its
name indicates, south of Asia, between the Equator and 50° S. lat., and no 0 and
180 0 E. long. It comprises the island-continents of New Guinea, Australia,
Tasmania and New Zealand, and conterminous archipelagoes of New Britain,
Solomon Islands, Loyalty Islands and New Caledonia.
In the Imperial “ Federal Council of Australasia Act” (48
and 49 Vic., No. 60), the expression, “ Her Majesty’s possessiohs
in Australasia,” means —
The Colonies and such other territories as Her Majesty may from time to
time declare by Order in Council to be within the operation of this Act.
“ The Federation of British Australasia,” therefore, signifies
in this paper a Federation of all Australasia now forming, or that
may hereafter form, an integral portion of the British Empire.
2. At the present time, excluding British New Guinea, which,
it will be admitted, is exceptionally circumstanced, there are eight
quasi-independent Colonies or States in British Australasia, viz. :
New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and
Western Australia (comprising “Australia” proper), Tasmania,
New Zealand and Fiji.
Looking to future developments, and remembering that Aus-
tralasia is merely on the threshold of its political existence, can it
be doubted that there is much to be said in favour of encouraging
and working earnestly towards an early federation of these at
present separate political entities ? Probably, at first, only Aus-
tralia and Tasmania may see their way to federate as a so-called
Commonwealth, but, once such a commencement has been made,
surely it will only be a matter of comparatively short time before
the other Colonies will fall into line.


3. We shall now suppose that such a Federation is in contem-
plation, and we shall endeavour to outline briefly a few of the
political and economic advantages and developments likely, in our
opinion, to ensue or to arise should the Federation become an
accomplished fact.
4. In this connection it may be well to take a glance at Canada,
to see what advantages have accrued to her since the Provinces
became a Dominion. The High Commissioner of Canada takes a
position in Great Britain altogether different from that of the
Agent-General of any Australasian Colony ; he represents the
Government of several States, whereas an Agent-General repre-
sents only one State. Canada, single-handed, carries a weight in
Imperial Councils much greater than she did in the days before
Federation. So will it be with Australasia when her High Com-
missioner can speak as the representative of a Government of
4,000,000 inhabitants. In like manner, when we look to the
question of Defence, can anyone fail to appreciate the enormous
advantage of having one head over the forces in place of several
heads ? In the limits of this paper minute details must be avoided,
but surely it is permissible to mention the political advantages of
having a strong executive, of building up a National in contra-
distinction to a Provincial sentiment, the preservation of law and
order, including civil and religious liberty, the introduction of
intercolonial freetrade, a uniform currency and a uniform postal and
telegraphic system.
5. When we remember that the population of the United
States of America in 121 years has increased from three millions to
72 millions, the enormous possibilities in store, in course of time,
for British Australasia as a Federation, are enough to make one
pause in contemplation. Now is surely the time to lay deep and
well the foundations of a future nation —a nation, let us hope, that
will enter, when the time comes for separate existence—possibly
centuries hence—into a lasting offensive and defensive alliance with
the Mother Country, and perhaps even with other English-speaking
communities, such as the Dominion of Canada and the United
States of America, so as to assist in maintaining, and even
guaranteeing, the peace of the civilised world.
6. The Federation of British Australasia may politically be
considered from at least three points of view : firstly, from the
Colonial; secondly, from the British or Imperial; and thirdly, from
the Foreign. We shall consider these in the order named.
7. First, the Colonial point of view. Federation will tend to
abolish artificial border-lines between sister States ; it will open a
wider field to Colonial statesmen, to the professional, commercial,
agricultural, mining and mechanical classes ; it will greatly extend
commercial and social intercourse in all directions, abolishing such
restrictions to trade as border duties, differential tariffs and conflict-
ing laws and usages. To borrow a well-known and well-understood
expression, “ Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not


vex Ephraim.” Aims will become national rather than provincial,
and, in course of time, it is believed cosmopolitanism and broad-
mindedness will effectually supersede their opposites. The strength
and increasing importance of the Federation will promote a spirit
of self-reliance amongst its citizens, and will tend to make it re-
spected abroad. Not only so, but it will attract population from
the United Kingdom, and from the continent of Europe, who in
turn will not merely benefit themselves, but will add to the pro-
ductiveness and the stability of the States. With increased
facilities for moving from place to place, population will gradually
settle on the unoccupied lands, The Defence forces will be amal-
gamated under one system, and in time the Federation will
provide for its naval as well as for its military establishments. The
Postal, Telegraphic, Quarantine and other systems will also be
under Federal control —all of which ought to strengthen the feeling
of oneness in the community. Not merely so, but with the ap-
proval of the Mother Country, effective steps will doubtless be
taken to minimise danger from the introduction of undesirable
immigrants, so that, for all time, the Federation will be preponde-
ratingly Anglo-Saxon or Anglo-Celtic in race—essentially an
English-speaking community.
8. The establishment of the Federation should, in time, make
its Civil Service attractive to a considerable portion of the very elite
of its youth, for whom entrance and promotion should depend
solely on merit. The Service should be absolutely free from party-
political control, and should thus never become a menace, through
inefficiency or favouritism, to the economical management of State
departments. Federation will also hasten the time when the
Colonies could greatly strengthen the hands of the Mother Country
in the event of hostilities menacing her—a privilege and duty
which they would esteem and recognise in view of the many
benefits experienced through the Imperial connection, and in
accordance with the loyalty to the Crown that is one of their
cherished and distinguishing characteristics. On the other hand,
the Colonies cannot but recognise the danger of remaining for long
unfederated, as thereby jealousies might generate into active ani-
mosities, intensified by warring tariffs, and, as years passed by,
they might repeat the experience of South American Republics
should they sever from the Mother Country. It would, indeed,
be a melancholy and deplorable state of affairs if, owing to pro-
longed dissensions and remaining apart, Australasia became a
second Europe as regards independent nations, although originally
springing from one stock.
9. Second, the British point of view. To the Imperial
Government the Federation of the Australasian Colonies under the
Crown would necessarily be highly gratifying. In the first place,
it would be a testimony to the unity of the Empire ; and in the
second, it would minimise the danger of possible friction between
the Home and the Colonial Governments, as there would be only


one channel of official communication in place of several. Ihe
connection between the Mother Country and her Colonies resembles
in some respects that of a loved parent with his dutiful offspring.
A father likes to see his sons make their way in the world, in time
marry and set up separate establishments for themselves. In like
manner, a Mother State must expect to see her political offspring
hive off, and, as it were, start on their own account. The differ-
ence arises that, in the latter case, the Mother hopes that for many
days to come there will be hearty co-operation, which eventua y
may take the form of a Confederation for mutual help and
support, should the increase of population in the younger com-
munities necessitate a friendly severance—in other words, the
birth of a new English-speaking nation, able to maintain its inde-
pendence in times of peace or war.
io. The Mother Country has long recognised that the Colonies
are a splendid field for her surplus population, thus benefiting
those who emigrate, and giving more elbow-room to those who
remain behind ; in place of being a source of weakness to her they
are a source of strength, and they tend to increase her importance
both in the political and in the commercial world. She recognises
that it is much better for her that her emigrants should remain
her faithful subjects than that they should swell the numbers of
unfriendly, or even friendly, powers. On this aspect of the question
it is interesting and instructive to read the following extract from
the defunct Colonial Magazine (edited by Robert Montgomery
Martin), published in March, 1840, whose appropriate motto was—
Far as the breeze can bear the billow’s foam,
Survey our Empire, and behold our home.
“The migration of individuals from one part of a kingdom or
empire to another part of the same kingdom or empiu is decidedly beneficial;
existing deficiencies are supplied ', the condition of the migrators
improved (or else they would not have migrated), and knowledge
is extended and increased by promoting facility of intercourse
between distant communities, for an incalculable benefit is derived
from the interchange of mind, as well as from the transfer of
merchandise. It is those generally who are strong of heart, and
in full bodily health, who migrate ; and if the migrators do not quit
the island, kingdom or empire, the general weal is not diminished,
as the improvement of the condition of the migrators benefits the
whole community (on the principles expounded in our previous
number, on the commerce of England with her Colonies and a
foreign State); but, if they quit their native country to reside in a
foreign land, the strength of those who remain is diminished, while
the young and the aged, the feeble and the indigent, are thrown for
support on the reduced resources and increasing care of those who
have not migrated. Moreover, it can never be the true policy of a
nation to strengthen a neighbouring or rival State by the addition
of skilful artisans, while the nation is becoming daily weaker from
the additions thus made to the power of its neighbour. It is one


of the first duties of a wise statesman to encourage the increase of
population. Paley correctly states some of the advantages
possessed by a populous empire in these words :
Happiness is made up by the number of individuals who enjoy it: one hun-
dred persons are capable of producing a greater degree of individual happiness than
one person is : whatever, therefore, augments population {cateris paribus) is’the
great desideratum of a State; and the destruction of population by famine, pes-
tilence, the sword, &c., is one of the greatest evils to a country, and a serious
drawback on the happiness of each remaining individual.
The United Kingdom has now 28,000,000 of inhabitants, and
in some parts (Ireland) the number of mouths to the square mile
is about 300, which is an exceedingly dense population. If the
kingdom were cut off from all communication with other parts of
the world, there would either be an immense augmentation of the
inhabitants (the present rate of increase of births over deaths is
estimated at 1,000 a day) or there would be convulsive movements
in the body politic—civil wars, diseases (physical as well as moral)
would ensue —the frame-work of the social edifice would be quickly
annihilated, and anarchy, misery and total destruction would be
the certain result. To an insulated kingdom like England, emigra-
tion is now as indispensable as air was to the number of individuals
who were crowded in the “black hole of Calcutta”; and as we
have previously demonstrated, it is evidently for the advantage of
those who leave the island, as well as for those who remain in the
island, that the migration should only be from one part of the
empire to another, and not to a foreign State ; for every increase
in the rate of wages, and in the profits arising from industry, skill,
and capital enables the emigrant to become a purchaser of the
manufactures of the Mother Country, increases his prosperity, and
adds to the wealth and happiness of the whole community in the
empire. Thus, by the judicious regulation of the stream of emi-
gration, we preserve one of the main elements of a nation’s
strength, and provide for its extension and perpetuity. This is
beautifully exemplified by Wordsworth, who, in the following
expressive lines, has commended the establishment of colonies on
the principle of the bees sending off their annual swarm from the
overthronged hive, while predicting the beneficial results attendant
on the extension of ‘ Britain’s swarms over the smallest habitable
rock ’ :
As the element of air affords
An easy passage to the industrious bees,
P'raught with their burthens; and a way as smooth,
For those ordained to take their sounding flight
From the thronged hive, and settle where they list
In fresh abodes, their labour to renew ;
So the wide waters, open to the power,
The will, the interest, and the appointed needs
Of Britain, do invite her to cast off
Her swarms; and in succession to send them forth
Bound to establish new communities
On every shore whose aspect favours hope,


Or bold adventure ; promising, to skill
And perseverance, their deserved reward.
Change, wide and deep, and silently performed,
This land shall witness; and as days roll on,
Earth’s universal frame shall feel the effect,
Even till the smallest habitable rock,
Beaten by lonely billows, hear the songs
Of harmonised society, and bloom
With civil arts, that send their fragrance forth,
A grateful tribute to all-ruling heaven.”
ii. Third, the Foreign point of view. To foreign powers the
Federation of British Australasia would be a significant sign—it
would be a further proof, if such were needed—of the marvellous
genius of the British for colonisation, and of the adaptability of
the race to altered and altering environment. Further, the estab-
lishment of Federations in Canada and Australasia would in all
probability be followed by a South African Federation ; so that in
time Great Britain would have stalwart offshoots, well able, not
only to defend themselves, but to render aid to the Mother Country
when so required, and in times of peace presenting splendid fields
for British emigrants, who would thus be retaining their national
heritage almost wherever they might elect to go. Trade would
naturally follow the flag, and the commercial instinct being strong
in all civilised nations, not a few of the sons and daughters of Con-
tinental Europe would throw in their lot with the English-speaking
race. In this connection it may be mentioned that in the 60 years
ending with 1879 no fewer than 3,000,000 Germans, 313,000
French, 306,000 Swedes and Norwegians, 83,000 Swiss, 70,000
Italians, 65,000 Austrian-Hungarians, 48,000 Danes, 44,000 Dutch,
38,000 Russians, and 28,000 Spaniards settled in the United States
of America in spite of the difference in language—always more or
less a deterrent—besides 4,700,000 from the British Isles, who did
not labour under the same drawback. Almost all these people
practically resigned allegiance to the respective European Govern-
ments, and became naturalised citizens of the United States.
According to the census of 1891, nearly 50,000 Germans and over
5,000 Frenchmen were resident in British Australasia. These
were doubtless merely the vanguard of thousands yet to follow.
Signs are not wanting that, both in Germany and France, there is
a growing desire to follow in the footsteps of Great Britain in
founding colonies, but so far, apparently, with but limited success.
In eastern countries, such as China and Japan, the growing im-
portance of British Australasia, as evidenced by Federation, would
probably have a wholesome effect in more ways than one. Trade
would continue to expand, but at the same time it would be
realised that the British colonists were determined to retain within
their own territories the supremacy and purity of their race. Any
attempt at acquisition of territory in Australasian waters would be
promptly, vigorously, and effectively resented. It is not improbable
foreign nationalities generally would admit that, in the cause of


peace, it is well that natural boundaries, such as seas, should, for
governmental purposes, where practicable, separate countries. If
this opinion became intensified, it might in time be found feasible
to arrange for the retirement of the French from New Caledonia, of
the Germans and Dutch from New Guinea, either by sale or by ex-
change of territory. The United States of America, in days gone by,
purchased Louisiana from France, and in 1867 they bought Alaska
from Russia (price 7,200,000 dollars), and more recently Great
Britain ceded Heligoland to Germany. Such object lessons should
surely not be without instruction for us. Possibly in Africa and
in South America might be found a partial solution of the diffi-
culty. If the French retired from New Caledonia, removing their
convicts by a gradual process, the existing joint protectorate of
the New Hebrides would doubtless come to an end satisfactorily
through the acquisition of the islands by Great Britain, whose
missionaries have laboured there with much self-denial and con-
siderable success for nearly 55 years, not a few, indeed, sealing
their testimony with their blood.
12. Economic aspect. From the economic point of view the
Federation of British Australasia has attraction to a numerous
class who care very little for what may be considered the political
aspect of the question, although, as a matter of fact, the political
and economic are so interwoven, and so mutually dependent, that
the border line at times between the two is somewhat indistinct.
As an illustration of this fact we may mention the subject of Inter-
colonial Freetrade. That is largely a political matter, as the aboli-
tion of border duties must necessarily affect the revenue of the
different States, and, in consequence, may necessitate an alteration
of the incidence of taxation ; and yet nobody will deny it must also
have important economic bearings, as, by its adoption, interchange
of the natural products of differing climes and soils will be facili-
tated, and the body politic derive the advantages thence ensuing.
Judging by the experiences of the German Empire and of Canada,
subsequent to Federation in each case, and the consequent aboli-
tion of inter-State duties, the growth of the internal trade should
be enormous. In the case of Germany, one says :—“ We may say
that Federation is the chief political factor in the modern history
of Germany. Modern German history, so far as industrial pro-
gress is concerned, is practically the history of the Zollverein. She
has grown from a poor country into being the fourth commercial
power in the world, and, I believe, she is now the third manufac-
turing power in the world. National products have increased,
consumption has increased, and there has been an enormous
increase in locally-manufactured articles. And the most remarkable
increase of all is the increase in farming, agricultural and mining
products.”
13. In like manner, in Canada its Federation gave a tremendous
impetus to internal intercourse, trade and manufactures, although
three years after the abrogation in 1866 of the treaty with the


United States the exports to that country fell something like
-£4,000,000 in value annually; within seven years after the
Dominion had been established its foreign export trade, however,
rose from about to and the volume of its
total foreign trade (exports and imports) from £^25,000, 000 to, say,
in 1893-4.
14. Who can doubt but that a similar experience will be ours on
the accomplishment of Federation ? Like causes produce like effects.
Greater economy in Government should also result from Federation,
although this may not be experienced for the first few years—the
transition period. For example, each State could advantageously
reduce the number of its local legislators, and with the transfer to
the Commonwealth Government of the Post and Telegraph Depart-
ments, one Postmaster-General in place of several would suffice;
in like manner, the various Agencies-General could be superseded
by one Pligh Commissionership in London, and so on.
15. Financiers inform us that if the various public debts are
consolidated, there will be a very substantial saving in the present
annual charge for interest, and assuredly a still larger proportionate
saving in interest on all new loans in the form of Australasian
Consols. It is also believed that, after Federation is accomplished,
the advantages of still further savings in the same direction are
within measurable distance, should the Imperial Government see
its way to authorise Australasian Consols to be included in the list
of Trustees’ securities. It may be mentioned that in November
last the Victorian Government, for balance of a Conversion
scheme (exceeding £2, 000,000) from 4 to 3 per cent., obtained an
average price of £(103 Bs. id. for £IOO stock, which will, allowing
for the currency of the stock, yield purchasers only about 2f per
cent, per annum. This is quite 1 per cent, less than the average rate
paid by the Australasian Colonies on their existing aggregate in-
debtedness, and is a very encouraging sign from a Federation point
of view. By reference to Table VII. in the Appendix, it will be
noticed that in six Colonies alone it is believed on the maturity of
existing loans a saving of per annum will be effected in
the annual charge for interest.
16. Not only will economic advantages ensue from consolidation
of debts, the transfer to the Central Government of Customs, De-
fence, Quarantine, Postal and Telegraph Departments, Ocean
Beacons and Buoys, and the Agency-General in London, but the
establishment of a Federal Judicature will in its train produce
simplicity, celerity and economy in all cases involving complicated
machinery. It is suggested that suitors shall have the option of a
final appeal to a Federal High Court or to Her Majesty’s Privy
Council. Lawyers are divided on the question, but to the average
layman the advantages of an optional appeal seem incontrovertible.
Surely it will be found that much economy will result from the
processes of a Court having jurisdiction over the whole territory in
place of only one portion, when one Probate of a Will will suffice


in place of the existing complicated system, when one Insolvency
Law will suffice for the Federation and when a uniform system for
obtaining statistics and publishing statutory returns (Banking and
such like) will supersede the present cumbrous and, in some cases,
antiquated and misleading systems.
17. Although deemed impracticable at present to federate the
Railway systems, it is still hoped that that in time will be accom-
plished. In the meantime it is generally conceded that a unification
of the railway gauges is a federal matter, and that expenses in
connection therewith should be borne by the federal Government.
It needs no showing that when that is accomplished, the economic
advantages will be apparent in expense attending the transfer of
troops from place to place, in the conveyance of produce to its
natural ports, and to the rapid and economical distribution of
population from the seaboard to the interior and vice versa. Is it
too much to hope that in time the fares on the railways will be so
reduced, after earning interest on cost, that they will fulfil as they
have only partially done hitherto, the object of bringing outside
districts into such easy accessibility from the seaboard, that a larger
proportion of the population than hitherto will feel attracted to the
development of the natural resources of the country—pastoral,
mining and agricultural ? In the same direction it is to be hoped
that in time there will be one charge for letters and telegrams all
over the mainland, and that the charges for cablegram messages
will also be materially lessened. The same authority already
quoted says very truly, “ When the shackles which surround
the dealings of Australians with Australians are removed a vast
amount of potential energy will be set free,” and, referring to the
so-called loss of Border Customs duties, he adds, “ That amount
will not be lost; it will remain in the pockets of the people, and
take the shape of a great store of productive energy. The more
severe study we give to these problems—the more we desire to judge
the future by the past —the more we will see that any petty sacri-
fices we may make in the shape of any temporary dislocations of
revenue and trade, or on account of any errors in the scheme of
distribution, will be doubly repaid to us by the lasting and sub-
stantial advantages which Federation will confer on the people of
this continent.”
18. Currency is essentially a question that will have to be under
Federal control. What an advantage it will be economically when
a Federal Government Legal Tender Note Issue on a convertible
gold basis, available throughout the length and breadth of the b ede-
ration, will supersede the separate systems at present in vogue.
There will, of course, have to be non-political commissioners
appointed to manage and control the Issue. On this subject per-
haps a quotation from an address on the “ Prospective Finances of
the Australian Federation or Commonwealth ” may be excused.
The address was delivered over a year ago, but its figures still
apply;


Relative to the suggested Federal Note Issue Department, it may be well to
remember that the Commonwealth is bound to legislate for the currency. In
Queensland, at the present time, the Government issues convertible Treasury
Notes, whilst in the other Colonies the banks issue notes convertible into gold on
demand, in some Colonies the notes being a first charge on the assets of the
respective banks, whilst in other Colonies noteholders do not enjoy any pre-
ference over other creditors. The banks find that, where they have to pay duty
to the State on their average note circulation, the latter is not a source of profit
to them as in the early days it undoubtedly used to be. On the principle that the
safety of the public is the supreme law, bankers will not object to the Federal
Government having the sole right to issue legal tender notes, convertible into
gold on demand at places to be appointed in the Federal Capital, and in the
Capitals of all the Provinces or States. The Note Issue Department should also
be under the control of non-political trustees or commissioners, who should
always keep at least 30 per cent, of coin in the Treasury against average note
circulation, and who should be at liberty to invest 70 per cent, in British and
Australian or Australasian Consols and Exchequer Bills. As the notes would be
legal tender throughout the length and breadth of the continent of Australia and
in Tasmania, they would become in time a very popular form of currency, and
the circulation would, in my opinion, undoubtedly go on increasing in even a
greater ratio than the population. By latest returns, the total bank note circula-
tion in the Federating Colonies would appear to be under to which
would have to be added the Queeensland Treasury note issue: as 70 per cent,
of the total amount should bring in a revenue averaging 2§ per cent, per annum,
it is probably not over sanguine on present figures to estimate the net annual
profit to the Federal Government at about
19. With regard to the consolidation of the provincial debts
into Australasian Consols, it has also been suggested that a very
material saving could be effected by employing the Federal High
Commissioner in London (with, if need be, a Council of Advice) to
conduct the floating of new loans, the conversion of old loans, and
the inscription of stocks, with the periodical payment of interest
thereon. It is not necessary to particularise the commissions and
savings that would be thus effected, but it may be mentioned that
one important advantage an interminable stock would have over a
terminable one would be that the British Government Stamp Duty
of 12s. 6d. per cent, would only require to be paid once for all, in
place of every time a stock matured and had to be renewed. As
savings to be effected in payment of interest, whether by the State
itself or by its inhabitants, have practical bearings on the economic
aspect of Federation, mention may also be made of the advantage
to be gained by Australasian banks, and therefore by their con-
stituents, could a considerable portion of the banks’ coin reserves be
represented by Australasian Consols on an Australasian Register.
It stands to reason that if banks could carry on their business
at a perceptibly lower percentage of expense, they could afford
to advance money at appreciably lower rates, which undoubtedly
would have a stimulating effect on business generally. This is
referred to in the following extracts from the address previously
quoted. The allusions to an Australian Stock Exchange security,
and to the possibly disturbed state of the money market, are also
suggestive:—
It may be mentioned that if a portion of the proposed Australian Consols
are on the Australian Register, but with the right after notice to be transferred to


the London Register, they will become a favourite Australian Stock Exchange
security; and will also, I doubt not, be largely availed of by bankers and others
for temporary investment purposes, and, possibly, a considerable portion of the
bank settlement “ pools ” in each provincial capital could with advantage be
invested in them. Everything that can be legitimately done to keep interest low
tends to promote manufacturing and other enterprise, and that would, to some
extent, be the result if the banking “pools” were no longer unproductive of
income, as at present. . . . All the Australasian Governments have ahead of
them the necessity of providing for maturing loans, possibly at an inconvenient
time, when the money market may be in a disturbed state. That risk will, at all
events, be obviated after conversion into interminable stock, and the consequent
recurring commissions to bankers and brokers will then be a thing of the past.
20. Having glanced briefly at the political and economic
aspects of the proposed Federation of British Australasia, a few
further general remarks may, perhaps, not be out of place. When
one considers the vastness and surpassing importance of the
subject, one cannot but feel that it is difficult to compress into
such a small space what should be said —it is just another instance
of what the French call Vembarvas de richesses.
21. When the first Federal Parliament meets for the despatch
of business, the Tariff question will doubtless be an important bone
of contention, unless, indeed, as let us hope it will be, the spirit of
compromise is largely in the ascendant. At present the majority
of the Australasian Colonies either favour a Protectionist Tariff pure
and simple, or a Revenue Tariff with Protectionist incidence. New
South Wales is the only pronouncedly Freetrade Colony, but her
views have the sympathy of influential minorities in the other
Colonies. Lovers of Federation, therefore, who hold opposite
views on the Fiscal question, will not improbably try and devise a
via media, as national unity in face of possible external foes is of
paramount importance. A Revenue Tariff, sufficiently high to pro-
vide graduated vanishing bonuses to certain infant industries
(manufacturing or otherwise) requiring, in the opinion of many,
something in excess of a merely moderate Protectionist incidence
in taxation, should meet the case. By this time it is generally con-
ceded that the consumers of any article are more numerous than
the producers of that article, so, to give it other than a 'temporary
“ lift ” over what may be called the preliminary stile is practically
punishing the many for the benefit of the few. Economists
favouring Freetrade are not unwilling, under certain conditions, to
“ stoop ” in the, to them consoling, belief that, in the long run, they
will “conquer.” They welcome Intercolonial Freetrade as a step
towards a more general application of the principle, and they
remember, for their comfort, that many moderate and “ discrimi-
nating ” Protectionists say that the assistance they desire from
the State is only intended to last for a brief period. Such persons
think Canada is an instance in point, and they are not, therefore,
strongly averse to Sir Wilfrid Laurier’s attempt to gradually intro-
duce Freetrade.
22. It is now generally recognised that the Federal Parliament
will attract to itself a considerable contingent of the foremost men


in the Federating Colonies—men who will endeavour loyally to
carry out the mandate of the electors—actuated, it is hoped, by a
love for the State, superior to, and irrespective of, party.
23. The question of the regulation of coloured labour will require
calm deliberation to bring it to a saiisfactary solution. Even those
who allege it is indispensable to successful tropical agriculture
have no wish to introduce it, excepting safeguarded against abuse,
and with due provision for the return of the labourers after the
expiry of their engagements. In Queensland, in the Northern
Territory of South Australia, and in Western Australia, it has
been suggested that such labour will not be required south of lati-
tude 26° S. If Federation is not brought about soon, the Black
Labour question many be one of many which will increase the diffi-
culties of union hereafter, unless outside pressure, such as a
general war in Europe, should force us, nolens volens, into the very
thing so many of us wish accomplished in a time of peace, such as
we are now enjoying.
24. The ostensible aim and professed object of a war is to
redress injuries with a view to the establishment of a lasting peace.
Quarrels between nations often arise through boundary disputes.
On the principle that “ Prevention is better than cure,” would it
not be well that each great nationality represented in the Southern
Hemisphere should peacefully arrange —and the sooner the better—
to have a considerable distance between its possessions and those
of its friendly, or even of its so-called unfriendly, rivals in the
prosecution of their respective national aspirations ? It is evident
the present tripartite division of New Guinea contains the germs of
possible complications hereafter, and, therefore, the sooner the
island is formally incorporated with the British Possessions the
better for the cause of civilisation —so, at least, it appears to us.
25. In the proposed Federal Constitution, might it not be well
to have an exceptional elastic provision to be availed of after so
many years’ experience of the working of the Constitution ; but
after such amendments as then might be desirable being effected,
the Constitution to become more rigid in its amendment provisions
than during the first prescribed period ? Although in a minority
at the present time, in our opinion those have a strong case who
would desire to catalogue the respective spheres and duties of the
Provincial and the Federal Governments, with a proviso that “ all
matters or things not specifically allotted to the Provincial Parlia-
ments shall be under the control of the Federal Government until
it legislatively divests itself of the same.” This may savour of the
Canadian system, but at all events it effectually prevents the possi-
bility of conflict arising on unforeseen subjects; and, as human
nature is constituted, it will probably be much more easy to get the
Federal Parliament to transfer the control of certain questions to
the Provincial Parliaments, than to get the latter to be unanimous
in lessening their relative power by extending the sphere of action
of the Federal Parliament. This very fact should be borne in


mind -when constituting an Inter-State Commission to regulate
Railway Rates, so that Intercolonial Freetrade should not be emas-
culated by Preferential Railway Rates.
26. One of the initial troubles of the Federal Government
will be to organise a Federal Civil Service, which from the start
should be carefully graded into classes. In addition to appoint-
ments by a non-political board, there should be an Officers’ Super-
annuation Fund, under the control of non-political trustees, the per-
centage on salaries payable by officers being dependent on and
regulated by the report of highly qualified actuaries. Officers so
appointed would have some guarantee that, subject to good
behaviour and efficient discharge of duties, they would have a per-
manency until the age for retirement arrived; or, if health should
give way, they would be entitled to a stipulated retiring allowance,
in proportion to length of service and contributions paid by them
to the Superannuation Fund. Of course, provision would also have
to be made for their retirement, should general retrenchment so
require. Now-a-days, the Colonial Civil Service has very little
attraction for rising young men, who naturally prefer walks of life
where their abilities will tell, and not where they may vegetate for
years, and have their lives made miserable by yearly recurring
debates on the Estimates by, in too many cases, ignoramuses with
the letters “ M.L.A.” attached to their names, and whose legis-
lative emoluments, in not a few cases, are considerably above what
they could earn outside of Parliament.
27. Table I. in the Appendix supplies statistics relating to the
population of the United States of America at decennial periods
from 1790 to 1890, with instructive information respecting the
stream of immigration from Europe and Canada between 1840 and
1890. Colonel Bell, the respected Consul of the United States,
has courteously supplied the figures. The other Tables, with the
exception of Table IX., were compiled in the office of the Govern-
ment Statist of Victoria, and all bear, more or less, on the subject
matter of this paper. A perusal of them will, it is believed, do
much to strengthen the faith of those who think that, in the light
of experience elsewhere, the Federation of British Australasia
should no longer be delayed.
28. From the geographical definition of “ Australasia
already quoted, it will be seen that if the British can acquire ex-
clusive jurisdiction over the territories in the portion of the Globe
indicated, the boundaries of such sphere will approximately repre-
sent an area extending from the Equator southwardly, say, 3,500
miles, by a distance from East to West of, say, 4,900 miles, with
the exception of the area represented by Java, and portions of
Sumatra, Borneo and Celebes, which extend south of the Equator,
and which certainly are generally considered outside of Australasia
proper.
29. In the domain of science, geologists and astronomers for
the most part seem to ignore ordinary computations of time, a


million years, much less a thousand, being often with them *as one
day ! Under such circumstances, may not politico-social econo-
mists be allowed to extend their horizon a few hundred years back-
wards or forwards, and draw attention to contrasts between time,
past, present and future ? We do not propose to go back to the
days of Julius Caesar, whose death is still occasionally alluded to
by our local Parliamentarians, and who is credited with having
invaded Britain b.c. 55, but let us, in imagination, compare
Britain a.d. 1066, when William the Conqueror invaded it, with the
British Empire in a.d. 1897, on ty 831 years afterwards ! Who in
those early days could have dreamed of the future in store for the
Mother Country ? Even as the oak is in the acorn, so was the
germ of the most wonderful Empire the world has yet seen in that
little known and thinly-populated isle. And what has been may
surely yet be ! We are of the same race, and we enjoy advantages
our forefathers never had. Let us endeavour to rise to our destiny,
maintain our civil rights and liberties, and go on our way rejoicing,
loyal to the Crown and Flag under which we live and are protected,
and welcoming to our shores all who care to cast in their lot with
us, and who at the same time bring with them habits of industry
and integrity. We have seen how, in 121 years, the United States
have increased in population from 3,000,000 to 72,000,000, and
how in 831 years the British Isles have grown from a very small
beginning, relatively, to a magnificent Empire, whose Flag is, in
very truth, the symbol of liberty all the world over. One hundred
and twenty-one years hence will carry us to a.d. 2018, and 831
years hence to a.d. 2728. Why should the geologists and
astronomers monopolise the pleasures of anticipation ? The
present generation has assuredly great responsibilities resting upon
its shoulders. May it never forget that principles are eternal, and
that, for weal or woe, the future of Australasia largely depends on
the adoption of an enlightened course of action at this stage of our
national existence. It is seldom wise to prophesy, unless, as the
humourists say, “ after the event,” and as a notable instance in
point it may be mentioned that in July, 1788, Lieut-Governor
Major Ross wrote from New South Wales to the Under-Secretary
of State as follows :
I will, in confidence, venture to assure you that this country will never
answer to settle in, for though I think corn will grow here, yet I am convinced
that if ever it is able to maintain the people sent here, it cannot be in less time
than perhaps xoo years hence. I, therefore, think it will be cheaper to feed con-
victs on turtle and venison at the London Tower than be at the expense of
sending men here.
And in November of the same year he further wrote :
In the whole world there is not a worse country than what we have yet seen.
All that is contiguous to us is so very barren and forbidding that it may with
truth be said, “ Here Nature is reversed.’’ And if not so, she is nearly worn out,
for almost all the seeds we have put in the ground have rotted, and I have no
doubt but will, like the wood of this wild country, when burnt or rotten, turn to
sand.


History has already abundantly falsified these predictions.
Were one inclined to attempt to forecast the future of British
Australasia, one would like to do so (and, possibly, not without
some degree of justification), in the ever memorable words of the
author of “ Paradise Lost ” :
Methinks I see in my mind a noble and puissant nation rousing herself like
a strong man after a sleep, and shaking her invincible locks ; methinks I see her
as an eagle mewing her mighty youth, and kindling her undazzled eyes at the
full midday beam ; purging and unsealing her long abused sight at the fountain
itself of heavenly radiance, while the whole noise of timorous and flocking
birds, with those also that love the twilight, flutter about amazed at what she
means.
30. May we as a community be preserved from thinking that
mere material interests should absorb our attention ; rather, on the
contrary, may we ever encourage and seek to encourage the pursuit
and the acquisition of knowledge in the spheres of science, art,
philosophy, and everything that makes for the mental, the moral
or the physical happiness and prosperity of mankind. In this con-
nection a perusal of Table 111. in the Appendix is specially instruc-
tive, as it shows that, at all events nominally, the adherents of the
Christian religion compose 94 per cent, of the population in the
Colonies enumerated. If a nation is to be built up on a strong and
enduring basis, all the elements of national life must be fostered,
if possible, in due proportions one to another.
31. Tennyson commemorated the opening of the “ Colinderies ”
(i.e., the Colonial and Indian Exhibition), in 1886, by a poem in
which regretful allusion is made to the unfortunate political errors
of the historic past, in driving away from the national fold our
kinsmen in the United States, and in which, likewise, in becoming
language, the intention is voiced of acting far differently in the
future :
Britain fought her sons of yore,
Britain failed; and never more,
Careless of our growing kin,
Shall we sin our father’s sin.
Men that in a narrower day,
Unprophetic rulers they,
Drove from out the mother’s nest
That young eagle of the west
To forage for herself alone —
Britons, hold your own.
Sharers of our glorious past,
Brothers, must we part at last ?
Shall we not, through good and ill,
Cleave to one another still ?
Britons, myriad voices call —
Sons be welded, each and all.
May such sentiments produce their appropriate actions, and may
the Mother and her children long be united in the happiest of ties !
Tennyson held the conviction that the English race was “ destined
to be the greatest among races,” and that a federation, or more
properly a confederation, of the Mother Country and her Colonies


“ would be the strongest force for good and for freedom that the
world had ever known.” He also “ did not believe it hopeless that
America should enter into a close alliance with such a league.” A
public writer on this subject remarks that “ the dreams of one
generation sometimes become practical politics in the next.”
32. Oneof the most gifted of Australia’s sons, so far back as 1822
—that is 75 years ago—whilst a student at Cambridge University,
apostrophised the ever loved Mother Country in the following lines
with which we think we may not inappropriately close these remarks
on the Federation of British Australasia :
May all thy glories in another sphere
Relume, and shine more brightly still than here ;
May this —thy last-born infant —then arise
To glad thy heart and greet thy parent eyes ;
And Australasia float, with flag unfurled,
A new Britannia in another world.
