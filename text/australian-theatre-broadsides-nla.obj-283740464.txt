It seems worth recalling the fact that'
in the spring 1096. exactly 800 year* 5
ago, took place the first Crusade,
magnificent mania of faith and fanaticism
which aroused Europe by a great re-
ligious impulse to stem the course of the
followers of the false prophet Mahomet
in the East.
For the first time in its history, the
Colorado gold output is in exc«se of its
silver production. Nearly all the gold
came from the vicinity of Cripple Creek.
Colorado, however, is still foremost as a
silver State. The output of gold last
year was 17,310,955 dollars ; of silver,
14,259,049 dollars.

later) : “ Now, I hope you have kept

Fond Mother: “My darling, it is bed-

“Yes.” He had been waiting for that

he heard her say it. “ Yes.” He longed
to take her in his arms, but she spoke as
if there was more that she wished to say,
and so he hesitated. “ Yesterday I pro-
mised to be another’s.” He strode away

Dear Sir, I have much pleasure in bearing testimony to the good result of your
corn and bunion treatment without cutting. The cure in my case was a painless and
thorough one, and lam now no longer a walking barometer. Your treatment of the
bnnion & (a regular fiend of ten years’ standing) was an undoubted success. It is some
nine months since yon attended me, and I can safely say I have never suffered
inconvenience with my feet since. Wishing you every success, I remain, dear sir, yours

The other day a lady was asked by
gome little girls to come and look at a
bridal-party of dolls, at whose toilette
they had been assisting. On viewing the
pretty gathering, she ventured to inquire,
“ But where is the bridegroom F” “ Oh,
we don’t want any men !” was the prompt
reply.

Justice: “Gall the next case, bailiff.”
Bailiff: “The next case, yer honour, is a

I’ll fine the whole business for contempt

ng of colors :
“The lass whose akin hazel brown.
With brighter colors should o’ercome her own.
Let the fair nymph in vrh*«c white cheek is see®

The sable mournful hue should choose to wear.
So the pale moon still adsinas with purest light.
Clad in the dasky mantle of the night.”

every day. When we say Wine, we mean First-
class Colonial Wine, not the concoction that is
served up in a lot of the low dives that frequent;
all Australian cities. Medical men have affirmed

port wine than in any other alcoholic drink, and
the prescription for invalids is very often simply
good Colonial Port Wine, Coolalta if possible,
for Wilkinson's Coolalta Winks are un-
doubtedly the finest on the market. |

Since the introduction of the fashionable P.D.
Corset to the Ladies of Australia, they have, by
their general excellence, comfort and durability,
placed themselves at the head of all other makes.
Being made of the very best materials only, and
designed by the leading French experts for
attire, they stand unrivalled for finish, perfect-
ness of fit, style and elegance.
To Ladies who have been wearing the older
makes the French P. D. come as a pleasant sur-
prise ; and as in England, America, and on the
Continent Ladies of fashion wear no other, those
who have not so far putehased the French P. D.
we would invite to do so, and prove for them-
selves.
Purchasers are requested to see that our trade
mark P.D. is stamped on inside band—none are
genuine without. To be obtained from all the
leading Drapers throughout Australia.

the editor of a contemporary asking him
or advice. One, who was the father of
twins, inquired the best wav to get
them ’aiily over teething. The othfer
n-ked how to protect his orchard from
grasshoppers. In replying, the editor
made a mistake in the names, and the
happy father was told to “ cover them
carefully with straw and set fire to them,
and the little pests, after jumping about
in the flames for a few minutes, will be
speedily settled while the victim of the
grasshoppers was advised to give a little
castor oil, and rub their gums gently with
a bone.”
