To Correspondents.
Although it is only in rare cases that they can be recommended in
preference to the Duplex, we intend to continue the manufacture of
Worthington steam pumps of the single cylinder type, of both vertical and
horizontal patterns.
It is, therefore, especially important that we should be consulted as to the
proper type, size, pattern, and proportion of pumps for any service, as well
as to the plan of their connections and the kind of material to be used in
their construction.
We should be informed of all the conditions of the service under which the
pump is to work, as indicated by the following questions :
ist. To what service is it to be applied ?
*2nd. The quality of the liquid to be pumped, whether salt, fresh, acid,
clear or gritty ; and whether it is to be pumped cold or hot ?
3rd. To what height is the water to be lifted by suction , and what are the
length and diameter of the suction and discharge pipes ?
4th. Of what material is the suction pipe, and what is its general arrange-
ment as regards other pipes leading into it, &c. ?
sth. Will supply be taken from a driven well ? If not, from what source ?
6th. To what height, or against what pressure, is the water to be pumped ?
7th. What is the greatest quantity of water needed per hour ?
Bth. What pressure of steam is used ?
9th. Will pump exhaust into atmosphere, into condenser, or against a back
pressure ? If so, how much ?
If any difficulty is experienced in making a pump work properly when first
started, it will generally be found to result from imperfect connections, or from
the temporary stiffness to be expected in a new machine.
nVhen hot water is to be pumped, the difficulty of lifting it by suction increases with the
temperature. It should, therefore, be arranged to flow into the pump chamber, if so hot as to
vaporize when the pressure of the atmosphere is removed.


Unless the suction lift and length of suction pipe are moderate, a foot-valve,
a charging connection, and a vacuum chamber are very desirable, if not
absolutely necessary. The supply pipe must, of course, be entirely free from
air leakage.
It sometimes happens that a pump refuses to lift water while the full pressure
against which it is expected to work is resting upon the force valves, for the
reason that the air within the pump chamber is not dislodged, but only
compressed by the motion of the plunger. It is well, therefore, to arrange for
running without pressure until the air is expelled, and water follows. 1 his is
done by placing a check valve in the delivery pipe, and providing a waste
delivery to be closed after the pump has caught the water. Such a valve is also
required for keeping back the pressure when the pump is opened for examination
of the valves.
A general arrangement of pipe connections and attachments is illustrated
and described on pages 148 and 149 of this Catalogue. The information will
be found useful to those persons not fully acquainted with the subject.
The quality of the material and workmanship of Worthington steam pumps
is guaranteed to be first-class in every particular. Nothing is omitted in their
manufacture that would tend to their improvement in strength or durability.
Their exterior finish is ordinarily as plain as is compatible with good taste and
design. But where desirable for special cases, they will be finished as
ornamentally as may be demanded, at the cost of the extra work.
To designate the sizes of Worthington Pumps, give the diameters of their
steam cvlinders and water plungers, and length of stroke. In referring to one
already in use, its shop number should be stated.
In ordering repair parts particular attention is directed to pages 152 to
155, where full lists and descriptions are given. It will be noticed that the
Worthington pump, as now manufactured, differs in some details from the earlier
patterns. On this account it is very important that the size and shop numbei
of the pump be clearly stated in all orders for repair parts.
All pumps are fitted with brass valves unless otherwise specified, but
rubber, rubber composition, or other suitable material can be furnished if
desired. For pumping salt water, or where the pump may lie so long unused
as to be liable to rust, the piston rods and plungers should be of brass, and
where fitted on board ship complete pump end should be made of composition.
Every machine, whether new or after being repaired, is fully tested under
various conditions of speed and pressure before being delivered from our factory.

Worthington Steam Pump.
Regular Pattern.
Size, 16in. X 10¼in. X 10in.


Worthington Steam Pump.
The valve motion is the prominent and distinguishing peculiarity of the Worthington Pump.
To this it owes its complete exemption from noise or concussive action. Two steam pumps are
placed side by side, and so combined as to act reciprocally upon the steam valves of each other.
The one piston acts to give steam to the other, after which it finishes its own stroke, and waits for
its valve to be acted upon before it can renew its motion. This pause allows all the water valves
to seat quietly, and removes everything like harshness of motion.
As one or the other of the steam valves must be always open, there can be no dead point. The
pump is, therefore, always ready to start when the steam is admitted, and is managed by the simple
opening and shutting of the throttle valve.
In its application to steam pumps for ordinary service, as well as to waterworks engines of the
largest class, a combination of reliability with economy in first cost and in running expenses is
attained, not realised by any other type of pumping machinery.
The Worthington Pump is distinguished for great simplicity and strength of construction
having few moving parts, with no harsh motions, and not subject to fracture or other derangement.
In the arrangement of the Worthington Steam Pump, special care has been taken to have the
parts easily accessible for inspection or repairs. All the moving pieces, being made to gauge, can
be readily renewed.
Added to its durability, the smooth and noiseless action of the Worthington Steam Pump makes
it preferable on many important services, where the jar of a single-cylinder or crank and fly-wheel
pump would be objectional or destructive.
SPECIAL ATTENTION IS CALLED TO THE DETAILS OF CONSTRUCTION OF
THE VALVE MOTION OF WORTHINGTON PUMPS. AS NOW MADE, ALL THESE
PARTS, INCLUDING THE SPOOL ON THE PISTON ROD. ARE STEEL; ALL CIRCULAR
PARTS BEING MADE FROM ROLLED STEEL RODS, AND OTHER IRREGULAR PARTS
BEING DROP FORGED. ALL THE WEARING SURFACES OF THE VALVE MOTION
ARE AMPLY LARGE, AND ALL PINS ARE HARDENED. THIS SHOULD BE CARE-
FULLY CONSIDERED BY ALL PURCHASERS OF PUMPING MACHINERY. THE CUT
ON THE OPPOSITE PAGE ILLUSTRATES THIS CONSTRUCTION FOR PUMPS,
BEGINNING WITH 10-INCH STROKE.
ON THE LARGER SIZES OF PUMPS THE PISTON RODS ARE DIVIDED AT THE
SPOOL, WHICH ENABLES THE STEAM AND THE WATER PISTON ROD TO BE
DRAWN AT THEIR RESPECTIVE ENDS, THEREFORE REQUIRING LESS SPACE FOR
DRAWING THESE RODS THAN IN THE CASE OF SOLID ONES. ALTHOUGH THIS
CONSTRUCTION IS MORE EXPENSIVE, IT HAS BEEN FOUND IN MANY CASES TO
BE ADVANTAGEOUS, ESPECIALLY WHERE PUMPS ARE USED ON SHIPBOARD,
ELECTRIC LIGHT STATIONS, AND OTHER SERVICES WHERE THE SPACE IS
LIMITED.
IN ADDITION TO THE ADVANTAGE OF SPACE IT ALLOWS THE STEAM END OF
THE PISTON ROD TO BE ALWAYS MADE OF STEEL, WHEREAS THE WATER END
OF THE ROD CAN BE MADE OF BRONZE OR OTHER SUITABLE METAL FOR
PUMPING SALT OR ACID WATER.


Worthington Steam Pump.
Sectional View.


Worthington Steam Pump.
Regular Pattern.
The illustration on the opposite page is a sectional view of one side or half of a Worthington
High-pressure Regular Pattern Steam Pump. Its object is to exhibit the great simplicity of its
interior arrangement, especially that pertaining to the steam valve.
This valve, as may be seen at E, is an ordinary slide-valve, working upon a flat face over ports
or openings. Its simplicity and durability, in contrast with any other form of steam valve, is well
known. Although numerous attempts have been made to supersede it, it still maintains its place
on locomotives and other forms of high-pressure crank engines. No matter how long the engine
may stand inactive, a slide valve will not rust or adhere to its seat, and is always ready to start
when required. No water can collect in its cavities to produce trouble by freezing. In a word, it
may be called the simplest and most reliable steam valve known to engineers.
In the Worthington Engine the motion of this valve is produced by a vibrating arm, seen at F,
which swings through the whole length of the stroke, with long and easy leverage. As the moving
parts are always in contact, the blow inseparable from the tappet system is avoided. Even the
motion of the well-known eccentric upon crank engines is not comparable to this for moderate
friction and durability.
Attention is also directed to the arrangement of the double-acting plunger, shown at B.
It works through a deep metallic packing ring, bored to an accurate fit, being neither elastic nor
adjustable. Both the ring and the plunger can be quickly taken out, and either refitted or
exchanged for new ones at small cost; and if it be desired at any time to change the proportions
between the steam pistons and pumps, a plunger of scmewhat larger size, or decreased to any
smaller diameter, can be readily substituted. As exact proportions between the pcwer and work
are alwavs desirable, if not necessary, this is a very important adiantage.
This system of renewal of the working parts has been proved by long experience to be the least
expensive and most satisfactory for ordinary work. The plunger is located some inches above the
suction valves, to form a subsiding chamber, into which any foreign substance may fall below the
wearing surfaces. This enables it to work longer without renewal than the usual form of piston
pump, especially in water containing grit or other solid material. (For arrangement of plungers,
with external and adjustable packing, see pages 50 to 63.) The water enters the pump from the
suction chamber C, through the suction valves, then passes partly round and partly by the end of
the plunger, through the force valves, nearly in a straight course, into the delivery chamber D, thus
traversing a very direct and ample water way. The bottom and top plates furnish a large area for
the accommodation of the valves. These consist of several small discs of rubber or other suitable
material, easy to examine and inexpensive to replace.


Worthington Standard Feed Pump.
Size, 6in. X 4in. X 6in.


Worthington Standard Feed Pump.
The Worthington Standard Feed Pump illustrated on the opposite page is constructed for
working pressures not exceeding 200 lbs. per square inch.
The steam valve motion is the standard Worthington motion.
The water ends of these pumps are fitted with gunmetal valves working on gunmeta seats.
For such important service as boiler feeding, pumps should be carefully selected and slow speeds
are specially recommended, as oftentimes the successful working of important installations is entirely
dependent upon these machines being able to perform their work continuously, and any mishap to
the pump, due to overworking or other cause, might be attended by serious consequences. In all
imnortant installations these machines should be in duplicate. ' ,
The capacities given below are those recommended for heavy pressures, and may fully be relied
upon for continuous working, and in cases of emergency may be considerably increased. V\ hen
selecting pumps, all comparisons should be based on the diameter and number of plungers and the
piston speed at which they will have to run, it being borne in mind that Worthington pumps have
two double-acting plungers, and therefore deliver twice as much water as single cylinder double-
acting pumps, or double cyclinder crank pumps with single-acting plungers of the same size when
if candisarranged to utilise the exhaust steam from these feed pumps for heating the
feed water this should be done, as the economy thus effected is greater than that obtained by
exhausting g ener allv, it is advisable to avoid suction lifts, and to so place the
pumps that the water will flow into them, even when pumping cold water ; when the water to be
pumped is hot, it is imperative to have a head on the suction side of the pump, this head being in-
creased as the temperature of the water increases. . .
Brass-fitted pumps are recommended when the w r ater to be dealt with is hot or salt, or if the
machine has to stand idle for long periods. , , ,
For Marine service or other special requirements, pumps can be supplied with water ends made
entirely of gunmetal if desired. P,

Worthington Compound Boiler
Feed Pump.
The cut on the opposite page illustrates the Worthington Standard Horizontal Feed Pump
as constructed with compound steam cylinders, and suitable for supplying boilers in which the
working pressure does not exceed 200 lbs. per square inch.
The adoption of the compound cylinders effects a saving of about 30 per cent, in the amount
of steam requited for driving the pumps*and their use is recommended in all important installa-
tions where greater economy is desired than can be obtained with the high pressure form of machine.
With a view of meeting the increasing demand for thisform of Feed Pump, several new designs
and sikes have recently been introduced, and these machines are made of both 6in. and ioin.
stroke as given in the table, With smaller pumps than those indicated below, the saving effected in
the cpnsumption of fuel hardly justifies the increased cost of compound steam cylinders.
When circumstances permit, the exhaust steam from these machines can with advantage be
turned through a Heater rather than into the atmosphere or condenser, thus effecting a still further
economy ; and by intelligently utilizing the heat of the exhaust steam, nearly all of it is returned to
the boiler, and the work of feeding the boiler is done with little loss of heat. A pamphlet clearly
explaining the economy and advantages of this utilization of heat may be had on application.
The capacities 'given in the table below can be fully relied upon for continuous working
against heavy pressures, and can be considerably increased in cases of emergency.

Worthington Pressure Feed Pump.
Size, 9in. X 5in. X 10in.


Worthington Pressure Feed Pump.
The Worthington Pressure Pattern Feed Pump, illustrated on the opposite page, is designed
for water pressures up to 300 lbs. per square inch.
The steam valve motion is the standard Worthington valve motion.
For heavy pressures it is often desirable, if not absolutely necessary, to substitute externally
packed rams or plungers for the internal piston arrangement, owing to the greater tendency of
water at high pressure to cut pistons and liners, causing leakage which cannot so easily be detected
in pumps with internally packed pistons.
In this type of Peed Pump each of the ordinary double-acting water pistons is replaced bv two
single-acting rams attached to cross-heads, and connected together by suitable tie rods, the two
plungers thus producing a double-acting effect. The glands of the rams situated at either end of the
pump am easily accessible for inspection and for renewal of packing. This construction is better
than oidinary double-acting rams on account of the greater accessibility of the stuffing boxes and
the smaller number used with this design. As the piston rods do not come in contact with the
liquid pumped they can always be of steel, thus ensuring the greatest strength.
water valves are located in separate valve boxes, and are easily accessible by removing the
valve box covers. The water valve boxes, being separate castings bolted to the main pump barrels
can be renewed in case of fracture or accident without necessitating the entire water end of the
pump being replaced.
The compound arrangement of steam cylinders can be adopted on this class of pump if greater
economy is required.
The capacities given in the table below can be fully relied upon for continuous working against
heavy pressures, and may be considerably increased in cases of emergency.

Size 5¼ in. and 7½ in. X 4½ in. X 6in.


Worthington Ram Feed Pump.
The cuts on the opposite page illustrate a design of Externally Packed Pump introduced
for boiler feed service, for circumstances where outside packed plungers are preferable to the
standard piston pattern of pump.
The pumps listed below are constructed for working pressures not exceeding 160 pounds
per square inch.
These Externally Packed Plungers are specially applicable where the boiler feed water is
hard, causing wear on the liners of an internally packed piston pump. The stuffing boxes
are packed with flax packing, or other suitable adjustable packing, which is softer than the rams
of the pump and consequently takes up nearly all the wear. If any leakage occurs, it will be at
once noticed by the attendant and can be remedied by adjusting the glands of the stuffing
boxes or by renewing the packing when necessary.
In cases where hot feed water ,is pumped, there is no fear of the rams binding owing to
unequal expansion of the metals, as the packing will be compressed and allow the plungers free
motion. If the packing is too tight the glands can very easily be slacked back.
When pumping hot water, these pumps should be placed below the level of the water in the
suction tank, and if the temperature is exceedingly high, or nearly at boiling point, they should be
arranged with as great a head on the suction side of the pump as possible.
In the cuts opposite the pumps are similar to each other, but the method of driving them
differs, the upper cut illustrating a simple engine and the lower one a compound. The compound
steam cylinders are an advantage where economy is desired, as a saving of about 30 per cent, of the
steam consumption is effected b;' their adoption.

Worthington
Vertical Marine Feed Pump.
Size, 7½in. X 5in. X 6in.


Worthington Vertical Marine
Feed Pump.
The Worthington Vertical Marine Peed Pump, illustrated on the opposite page, is designed
especially for use on ship-board for main boiler feed, tire and other services in connection with triple
or quadruple expansion engines, where a very high steam pressure is carried, and is intended lor
working pressures up to 250 lbs. per square inch.
The steam end is fitted with the Worthington piston valve motion, embodying some of the
latest patented features.
The abject of designing a pump of this description was to meet the demands of marine engineers
for a machine which would occupy the least possible floor space and head room ; have all its
internal parts easily accessible; be simple and strong in its construction ; arid bv reason of its
superior workmanship and quality require the least possible attention and repair.
The water passages are free and direct, and the water valves are arranged in valve boxes, all at
the front of the pump, so as to be easily accessible and allow the pump being placed close against
the bulk-head, as it is not necessary to allow for any space at the back or sides for examination.
The suction and delivery valves are in separate boxes, so that any one of them can be examined
without disturbing the others, and they are so placed that the pump readily frees itself of vapour
when pumping hot water. The couplings on the rods between the steam and water pistons allow
of the water pistons being taken out for examination without disturbing either the steam cylinders
or the valve motion ; and they further reduce to a minimum the head rcom required for drawing
the st°am pistons and rods.
Worthington pumps of this design are extensively used by the various Governments, as well as
for fast Mail and Passenger Steamers and the Merchant Service generally.
They are also well suited for electric light installations, and for other situations where space
does not permit the use of horizontal machines.
In addition to the design shown on the opposite page, special designs
and sizes are made for heavier pressures than given above to suit the re-
quirements of the British and other Governments; also specially light
Pumps for Torpedo Boats, Torpedo Catchers, Cruisers, and Battleships,
can be supplied.
In any emergency the speed of the pumps can be considerably increased beyond the figures
stated in the list.

Worthington Type “D."
Long Stroke Vertical Feed Pump.
Size, 10in. X 7in. X 18in.


Worthington Type “D."
Long Stroke Vertical Feed Pump.
The illustration opposite represents a comparatively new design of feed pump with specially
long stroke, which is intended for use in important situations where a slow running machine making
few reciprocations is desirable, both on account of the wear and tear caused by fast running, and
the decrease of economy due to a large number of reciprocations necessitating the filling of clear
ances in the steam cylinders at each stroke. To increase the economy in steam consumption these
pumps have been designed with the adjusting gear for the valve motion outside the steam chest, so
that the length of stroke can be adjusted while the pump is in operation. It is of course not neces-
sary to alter the adjusting nuts except for very wide ranges of speed, but very slow running requires
a later admission of steam in the cylinders than is the case with the pump running at a high speed
this being due to the absence of momentum in the former case.
The valve motion of this pump is of the piston type and the piston valves are balanced so as to
diminish the friction of moving them, this arrangement being specially important when working
with heavy steam pressures. The pumps are designed to meet the highest requirements in steam
pressure which are met with in connection with up-to-date water tube boilers, and the water ends
of the pumps will withstand test pressures up to 700 lbs. per square inch without danger. The
pump barrels are made of gun metal in order to economise weight, and' avoid corrosion and
deterioration, -and the whole machine is as compact as possible so as to occupy very small floor
space. This is of, especial importance for marine service, where space in the engine and boiler rooms
is extremely valuable and limited.
On pages 22 and 23 are illustrated and described our latest type of
Vertical Feed Pump known as “Type E.”

Worthington Type “E.”
Long Stroke Vertical Feed Pump.
Size, 9in. X 6in. X 12in.


Worthington Type “E.”
Long Stroke Vertical Feed Pump.
The half tone cut on the opposite page outlines our latest design of Feed Pump and General Service
Pump, this pump embodying all of the latest features and requirements necessary with the intro-
duction of high pressures, (both steam and water,) as well as all of the special features as incorporated
in our type “ D ” machine, together with modifications and improvements which have suggested
themselves since the type “ D ” machine has been so successfully placed upon the market. Especially
has this reference to weight and space, these two points, owing to the modified design, admitting of
a somewhat lighter pump, as well as one requiring reduced head room.
This type machine is designed for working pressures—both steam and water—up to 350 lbs. per
square inch, and a list of the standard sizes we give below.
The steam end of this pump is fitted with piston valve motion, the arrangement of the pistons
being such as admit of same balancing, being easy of access and of such a design as makes it
impossible for same to get out of order.
The water end of the pump is made in two separate parts, the. valve box being separate from
the water barrels, held firmly in place by studs, allowing by this arrangement of a number of com-
binations, such as the valve box being made of metal other than as required for the water barrels.
The manner in which the water valves of this pump are arranged within the valve chamber is
unique, special thought and consideration given to the objection arising from time to time of the
valves, valve seats, coming adrift, and this has been successfully overcome by a special arrangement,
all of which admits of both the suction and delivery valve being held firmly and securely in place
by one large spindle, this spindle being common to one each suction and delivery valve, this
arrangement being followed throughout the pump to the extent necessary to the number of valves
required to secure liberal valve area.
is especially designed and offered for ship work such as Main and Auxiliary Boiler
Feed, General Service Pump, &c.. and owing to the large numberof patterns different combinations
other than those as mentioned below can be offered, this according to the service as required.
It also, for land installations where a first class pump is required, recommends itself for Boiler
Feed Service.

Worthington Compound Steam Pump.
Size, 10in. and 16in. X 8 ½ in. X 10in.


Worthington Compound Steam Pump.
In the arrangement of steam cylinders here employed, the steam is used expansively, which can-
not be done in the ordinary form. Having exerted its force through one stroke, upon the smaller
steam piston, it expands upon the larger during the return stroke, and operates’to drive the piston
in the other direction. This is, in effect, the same thing as using a cut-off on a crank engine only
with the great advantage of uniform and steady action upon the water column.
Compound Cylinders are recommended in any service where the saving of fuel is an important
consideration. In such cases their greater first cost is fully justified, as they require 30 to 33 per
cent, less coal than any high-pressure form of pump for the same work. A further saving may be
effected when worked in connection with a condenser, in which case the low-pressure evlinders
should be steam jacketed.

Worthington Low Service Pump.
The Worthington Low Service Pump, illustrated on the opposite page, is intended for use where
the water is to be pumped only to a moderate height, and the water ends of these pumps are con-
structed for a water pressure of 70 lbs. per square inch.
The steam ends are the same patterns as used in connection with the Regular Pattern Pumps
illustrated on page 26.
The Water ends of these machines have the same general form and exterior construction as the
Regular Pattern Pump, but have water plungers, nearly, or quite, the same diameter as the steam
pistons. ■
In any emergency the speed of the pumps can be considerably increased beyond the quantities
given in the list.

Worthington Fire Pump.
Size “G.”


Worthington Fire Pump.
For the protection of Mills, Factories, Hotels, Private Mansions, &c. Recommended by the
leading Fire Insurance Companies for use in connection with Automatic Sprinklers. For illustra-
tion of Automatic Fire Pump, see page 140.
In this pattern the valve areas and water passages are unusually large, to insure the complete
filling of the pump cylinders with water when the machine is running at its greatest speed.
The superiority of the Worthington valve motion is especially prominent in steam pumps
applied to this service, for it enables them to run without jar or danger of derangement at the very
high rate of speed that is sometimes required. With all forms of single-cylinder pumps under such
circumstances, the concussion of the water valves at each reciprocation of the plunger, and the
blow upon the valve rod tappets, are dangerously severe, and render the machine and water pipes
liable to fracture. To obviate this difficulty as far as possible, the length of stroke is often
unduly increased to reduce the number of these concussions in a given length of piston travel.
The practical limit of speed at which single-cynnder pumps can be driven is, however, fixed at a
point which can be greatly exceeded by the Worthington. There are no tappets in the valve
motion of the Worthington pump. It neither strikes a blow nor operates suddenly upon the
plunger. The piston cushions quietly upon steam at the end of the stroke, pauses for an instant
until the water valves have closed, and then starts on the return stroke gradually, as its steam valve
is opened by the motion of the opposite piston.
The steam cylinders of all the Fire Pumps given in the list can be compounded if desired.
As this arrangemeqt secures a saving of more than 30 per . cent, of the fuel required by the high
pressure form of pump, it is often of great advantage, especially where the machines are to be
used on regular work.
Worthington P ire Pumps fitted with water pistons instead of plungers will be furnished v-hen
desired . Such modification of the regular pattern is recommended only in cases where, on account
of frost, no foot valve to keep the pump charged with water can be used on the suction pipe.
Prices of Worthington Fire Pumps of any desired capacity or proportion furnished on applica-
tion. Two, four and six way hose connections fitted to these pumps, when required, at cost.

Worthington Underwriter Fire Pump
Mutual Insurance Companies’ Specifications.
In our Underwriter Fire Pump, the water passages, valve areas, and suction
and discharge nozzles are all much larger than in any ordinary pump, so a greater
amount of water can be discharged without water-hammer. Also, the steam
and exhaust ports and nozzles are designed so as to give unrestricted passage to
the Steam. The pump is “ rust-proof,” and will start instantly, after standing
unused for a long time. The piston rods and valve rods are made of Tobin
bronze. All stuffing boxes and glands are brass lined. Plungers and plunger
sleeve are of composition, but the metals are differently mixed to prevent cutting.
This mixture of the metals has been a subject of much experiment and study ; it
has now brought us great success, as the parts work perfectly upon each other,
without friction or impairment.
Each pump has the following fittings, heretofore charged as extras, but now
included in the price and regularly furnished :
Capacity-Plate on Discharge Air-Chamber.
Stroke-Gauge, graduated on each end.
Vacuum or Suction Air-Chamber.
Steam-Gauge, 5 inches diameter.
Water-Gauge, 5 inches diameter, with duplex spring.
Relief-Valve of large capacity.
Relief-Valve Discharge-Cone.
Set of brass priming Pipes and special valves.
Required number of 2 y 2 inches Ludlow Hose-Valves.
One pint Sight-Feed Cylinder Lubricator.
All according to the specifications.
On account of the larger passage ways, brass parts and attachments men-
tioned, the pump necessarily costs more than an ordinary fire pump ; but the
cost by the gallon discharged is less, since the Underwriter pump can deliver a
greater quantity of water in the same length of time. It is also much heavier and
stronger, with superior workmanship, and better protected from rust and accident.

The actual capacity of each pump is more than the Underwriters’ rating,
and a greater speed can be attained, that will increase the number of fire
streams.


Worthington Low Steam Pressure
Pump.
Size, 6in. X 2½in. X 6in.


Worthington Low Steam Pressure
Pump.
In apartment houses, and all public and private buildings, where the “low pressure” system
of steam heating is in operation, pumps are required to run with a very moderate pressure of steam.
This necessitates different relative proportions of steam cylinders and water plungers from those
ordinarily employed. Special patterns are furnished to meet every requirement of such service.
These pumps are absolutely positive in operation; they require very little attention, and are
not liable to get out of order.
The sizes given in the subjoined list are suitable for pumping against a head of ioo to 125 feet
with an effective steam pressure of from 5 to 10 lbs.
At a slight additional cost, the smaller sizes can be fitted with a hand-power attachment,
thereby enabling them to be operated by hand when “steam is down.”
By changing the size of the pump plungers, these pumps can readily be altered to our “ Regular
Pattern” pumps, as the steam and water ends are built sufficiently strong to permit this change.
This is a very desirable feature in their construction, and will doubtless be appreciated by practical
engineers. The cost of this change is trifling.
These pumps are also used in greenhouses and nurseries.
The questions on page 4 should be carefully answered when making enquiries about pumps
for this service, so that a suitable selection can be made.

Worthington Piston Pump.
Sectional View.


Worthington Piston Pump.
For General Service.
The sectional cut on the opposite page illustrates the Worthington pump of the piston pattern,
designed for boiler feeding, fire, hydraulic elevator, and general service where the water pressure
does not exceed 160 lbs. This pattern should be used where the liquid to be pumped contains
small quantities of grit or foreign material, or where there is an unusually long or high suction lift,
and a foot valve cannot be used.
The water cylinders are composition lined, and have adjustable packed pistons. The water
valves are so arranged that the water pistons are at all times submerged. The valve areas and
water passages are large, and special care has been taken to have all the parts easily accessible for
inspection or repairs.

Worthington Circulating or Bilge Pump.
Size, 10in. X 10½in. X 10in.


Worthington Circulating or
Bilge Pump.
These machines are constructed of such proportions as to insure the best results with the least
expenditure of steam, and are made as light as is compatible with proper strength and durability.
The valves are easily reached through conveniently placed hand-holes, and the parts made
accurately to gauge, so as to facilitate renewals in case of wear. These pumps are also extensively
employed for bilge pumping, and for wrecking purposes. Their large valves and free water-ways
make them especially well-fitted for this work. The valve area being unusually large permits the
free passage of such floating material as is often met with in this service, and which would tend to
clog the pump and render it inoperative.
In any emergency the speed of the pumps may be considerably increased beyond the figures
stated in the list.

Worthington
Horizontal Ballast Pump.
Size, 6in. X 8½in. X 6in.


Worthington Horizontal Ballast Pump.
This machine was constructed to meet the requirements of steamship builders, and is now
recognised and adopted by the principal marine engineers of this and of other countries as the
standard design for this se'rvice and for oil-tank steamer work.
It will be observed that its proportions are such as to secure the advantages of large pumping
capacity with unusual compactness and moderate weight.
The pump is of the packed piston type, and has the valves so arranged that the waler pistons
are always submerged, thus making it particularly adapted for long and difficult suction lifts,
such as are met with in steamers carrying petroleum in bulk, and in steamers having extensive
systems of water ballast tanks.
The demands for water ballast service are generally met by the following sizes ; but wherever
required, machines of greater or less capacity can be supplied. For sizes not given below, refer to
Piston Pattern Pumps, page 41.
In case of necessity, the speed stated in the table below can be considerably increased.

Worthington Vertical Ballast Pump.
Size, 7½in X 9in. X 6in.


Worthington Vertical Ballast Pump.
These pumps were originally designed to meet the requirements of shipbuilders for a thoroughly
substantial and reliable Ballast Pump, and have been extensively used by the principal marine
engineers throughout the world.
It will be observed that the proportions are such as to secure the advantage of large pumping
capacity, with unusual compactness and moderate weight, these pumps weighing much less than
the fly-wheel ballast pumps so long used for this service, and which are being rapidly superseded
by the Worthington Pump.
This pump is of the packed piston type, and has the valves so arranged that the water pistons
are always submerged, thus making it particularly well adapted for long and difficult suction lifts,
such as are met with in steamers carrying petroleum in baulk, and in steamers having extensive
systems of water ballast tanks.
In this construction the valves, both suction and delivery, can be quickly got at through suitable
hand-hole plates arranged on the top and front of the valve-box chamber. The pumps are made
with double suction openings and double delivery, so that connections can be made at either or
both sides as may be desired.
The design of the pump is such that it can be placed in a corner or against a bulk head,
there being no necessity for getting at the back of the machine, all parts and hand-hole covers for
inspection being placed on the front.
The demands for water ballast service are generally met by the following sizes; but when
required a greater or less capacity can be supplied. In an emergency the speed of the pumps can
be considerably increased beyond the figures given in the list.

Worthington Patent Wrecking Pump,
Vertical Single-Acting Pattern.


Worthington Patent Vertical
Wrecking Pump.
(Special Single-Acting Pattern.)
A 1 so for Drainage and Irrigating Service.
This special design of our Vertical Pump is a very convenient and inexpensive
form of pump for Wrecking, Drainage or Irrigating purposes. These pumps are
largely used by the Wrecking Companies of the Sea Coast and Lake Service ; on the
lower Mississippi River they are used for draining bottom lands, etc. They are light
portable, and have great pumping capacity. They are single-acting, but the flow of
water from the pumps is practically constant, as the peculiar design and operation of
pumps gives this effect. These pumps will handle large quantities of water with
greater economy than centrifugal pumps, while they are much simpler and less likely
to get out of order. They will not grind out and lose their suction power, causing
excessive slippage, but will iully discharge their correct theoretical capacity of
water at any speed • an impossibility with centrifugal and similar pumps. It has
been demonstrated from trials made by well-known authorities that centrifugal pumps
do not deliver the same quantity of water per revolution at different speeds.
A full and comparatively long stroke with an even, smooth motion on the up as
well as on th edown stroke are special features of our Vertical Wrecking Pumps. The
steam cylinder is positive and does not require any lever or other hand gear to work it
“ off the centre.” There are no belts to slip or complicated mechanism to get out of
order.
These pumps are simply ‘ lift ” pumps and are not designed to ele\ ate water above
their discharge nozzles, but they will draw water any distance within the limit of
*• suction power.

ALSO PATTERNS FOR LARGER SIZES AND OTHER COSlBINATIONS
OF CYLINDERS.
, * The capacities given in this column are figured at the moderate speed of about 120 to 150
feet piston travel per minute.
The water cylinder is lined with brass; the piston rod, valve seats, etc., are also of
brass; so that these pumps are adapted for salt as well as fresh water. Valves of
best Vulcanized Rubber are used, with the largest area possible to pass obstructions.
In addition to the pumps given above, numerous sizes and combinations of the
ordinary Horizontal Pattern, for Wrecking, Drainage, or Irrigating Service are made.


Worthington Packed Plunger Pump.
Size, 12in. X 7in. X 10in.


Worthington Packed Plunger Pump.
In designing this pattern great care has been taken to reduce as much as practicable the loss by
friction inseparable from external packed plungers of all forms by adopting snch methods of con-
struction as will secure absolute rigidity of alignment under the heavy pressures often encountered
by this form of pump.
The patterns are so subdivided that the lupture, from any cause, of any one part, only
necessitates the renewal of a comparatively small casting. The cost of this pump is of necessity
somewhat greater than that of the Regular Pattern, but knowing that wherever the selection of
the Packed Plunger form is advisable, the service is of such severe character as to call for the
best obtainable workmanship and design, no expense has been spared to add to its efficiency or
strength.
The arrangement of compound Cylinders, shown on page 28, can be applied to these pumps.

Worthington Patent Vertical
Sinking Pump.


Worthington Patent Vertical
Sinking Pump.
“ Bucket and Plunger Pattern.
This improved type of sinking pump is especially adapted for sinking new
shafts, recovering “drowned out” mines, and for general excavating work involving
a variable water level. It is compact, easily handled, and, while designed to work
in a vertical position, will operate satisfactorily at any desired .angle, either suspended
by a tackle or hooked to the shaft timbering. It is positive in operation, throws a
steady continuous stream of water, and owing to the improved form of valve
motion, and a special cushioning device in the steam cylinder, is exceedingly quiet
in action.
The lower plunger, or ‘ ‘ bucket,’’ works in a removable cylinder of hard iron, which
may be replaced readily and at slight expense when worn out.
Swing bolts allow of easy access to the pump barrel and valves, the latter being of
best vulcanized rubber, with gun-metal seats. The suction opening is at the lower end
convenient for attaching hcse or piping, the discharge nozzle being above and to one
side ot the water cylinder, bach pump is fitted with a ring bolt, firmly embedded in
the cylinder head, for hanging by tackle, and with adjustable wrought-iron dogs bolted
to cylinders, for hanging from shaft timbers.

in an emergency, but we do not recommend exceeding it for continuous service.


Before connecting up sinking pump blow out the steam pipe thoroughly.
Any dirt or rubbish carried into the steam cylinder will cut it and injure it
seriously. After pump is connected remove reverse valve covers or plugs, take
out the valves and let steam blow through. Then carefully wipe the valves and
pockets clean before replacing the valve.
Special Vertical Plunger Sinking Pump.


Worthington Vertical Sinking Pump.
Outside Packed Plunger Pattern.
In this type of pump a hard iron plunger moves in two working-barrels having
stuffing boxes and glands fitted with swing bolts for convenience in packing. The
valves are of medium hard rubber, with brass seats, bolts and springs, the valve
chamber being independent and easily removable for inspection or repairs. The
suction valve chamber is fitted with automatic air valves for relieving the pump of air,
and the discharge air chamber has a cock for the same purpose. The discharge
elbow is fitted with a standard flange and has a cock for drawing off the water in dis-
charge pipe when desired. The bottom flange of the lower working barrel has swing
bolts for convenience of removal in order to take out sand or gravel, and the discharge
air chamber is in one piece, securing compactness and minimum weight.
The steam cylinder has a recently improved valve gear, without external moving
parts, thus reducing the liability to injury from accident or rough usage. The entire
design of this pump is exceptionally strong and compact ; workmanship and materials
are of the best, and fully warranted in every respect.

Size, 18 ½ X 7 X 10.


Worthington Packed Plunger Mine Pump
Scranton Pattern.
It is very difficult to design and construct a steam pump that will satisfactorily meet the exacting require-
ments of mine pumping. The surface is generally rough, severe and continuous. Great care must be exercised
both in the selection and adaptation of the material used in construction, as the water to be pumped is often of a kind
that will attack and quickly destroy it. The location of the mine is usually remote from supplies, and any
necessity for renewals or repairs, unless they can be made without skilled labour and with little delay, may be
attended with serious consequences. , ~ ,
These considerations, therefore, demand that a mine pump should be extraordinarily durable, simple and
efficient, and have led to the construction of the form of Worthington pumping engine illustrated on opposite
page. In it are embodied the result of the best practice heretofore, together with some important improvements
that have been recently secured by Letters Patent.
The plungers of this machine work through central externally packed stuffing-boxes, into four separate and
distinct water cy.inders. The valve areas and water ways are unusually large in proportion to the displacements
of the Plunger, so that the velocity, and consequent destructive action of the water currents are decreased. The
discharge tee can be turned in any direction.
The pumps are designed to safely withstand a severe working pressure, and all their attachments are
especially strengthened with a view to meeting the rough usage and hard work to which, in this service they are
liable to be subjected. ,
These machines are usua'ly made with simple high pressure cylinders, but compound cy.inders or triple
expansion, arranged as shown on page 58, can be adopted if greater economy is desired.
In any emergency the stated capacity of the pumps can be considerably exceeded.

Worthington Triple Expansion Mine Pump.
Lehigh Pattern.
Size, 13in. and 21in. and 34in. X 10in. X 24in.


Worthington Mine Pump.
Lehigh Pattern.
This pattern of Worthington Mine Pump is especially designed to withstand the heavy pressure
encountered in deep workings, and is recommended in all cases where a working pressure greater
than 300 lbs. to the square inch is encountered.
This pattern of pump is identical with that of the Pressure Pump shown on page 60, but with
such modifications in detail of construction as have been deemed expedient to meet the demands
of mine usage.
All parts exposed to pressure arc subdivided as much as possible, in order to overcome the
objection, so often made in mine pumps, of having to replace, the entire water end in case of rupture
through accident or negligence ; and each part is of a form well suited to resist the heavy pressures
encountered.
The water valves are arranged in a series of valve boxes or pot chambers, each chamber
containing one or more small valves having a low lift, and which are easily accessible by screwing
back the nuts on the eye bolts, and removing the valve box covers.
These machines are usually made as high pressure engines; but where a greater economy is
required they can be arranged with compound cylinders. (See page 28.) Ail parts of these
machines are made strictly to guage.
In any emergency the speed of the pumps may be considerably increased beyond the figures
stated in the list.

Worthington Hydraulic Pressure Pump.
Size, 10in. X 2½in X 10in.


Worthington Hydraulic Pressure Pump.
This Pattern fo pump is especially designed for driving hydraulic lifts and cranes, cotton and
hydraulic presses, for oil pipelines, mining purposes and such service as requires the delivery of
liquids under heavy pressures.
In the Worthington Pressure Pump the ordinary interior double-acting plunger is replaced by
Two plungers or rams having external adjustable packings, readily renewed, which work into each
end of a cylinder having a central partition. The plungers are connected together by yokes and
exterior rods in such a manner as to cause them to move together as one plunger, so that while the
one is drawing, the other is forcing the fluid, thus making the pump double-acting. The valve
boxes are also modified for the purpose of subdividing them into separate small chambers, easily
accessible and capable of resisting very heavy pressures. The general arrangement shown’ in the
engraving is subject to numerous alterations to adapt the pump to different requirements. The
general characteristic of independent plungers with exterior packing is, however, in all cases pre-
served, as being not only more accessible in case of leakage, but also as allowing the use of different
forms and material of packing. The severe pressure to which these pumps are often applied, not
less in some cases than 8,000 lbs. to the square inch, demand the most thorough construction'and
the use of the very best material.
The arrangement of compound steam cylinders shown on page 28, also the triple expansion
arrangement, as illustrated on the following page, can be applied to these pumps where a savin"
of fuel is desired. The water valves are easily accessible, and are contained in small chambers,
capable of resisting very heavy pressures. The general arrangement shown in the engraving is
subject to numerous alterations, according to various requirements, but the general characteristic of
four outside packed plungers is in all cases preserved.
The material used in the construction of these pumps is selected with great care, aud everv pre-
caution is taken to ensure their proper performance on work of the most severe character.

Worthington Independent Jet
Condenser.
Sectional View.


Worthington Independent Jet
Condenser,
FOR USE WITH
Marine and Stationary Steam Engines, Steam Pumping Engines,
Vacuum Pans, Extract Evaporators, and Multiple
Effect Vacuum Apparatus of all kinds.
That the practical results attained by condensing engines should approximate those that theory
indicates, it is important that the condensing apparatus employed should be the most efficient pos-
sible ; that it should maintain the highest vacuum with the least cost of production ; that it should
be regular and reliable in action; simple in construction ; and that its application to the engine
should be unaccompanied by any risk of accident. These exacting requirements are all fully met
by the Worthington Condenser.
Exhaust steam from an engine enters a vacuum with a velocity of about I,9oo'feet per second,
and water under atmospheric pressure with a velocity of 47 feet per second. Excepting the machine
herein described, it may be said that in all forms of jet condensers operated by air pumps the injec-
tion water and the water from the steam fall to the bottom of the condensing chamber, come to a
rest before entering the pump, and consequently lose the value of the momentum acquired when
entering the vacuous space. In the Worthington Condenser, however, the construction and
arrangement are such that the momentum of the steam and water is conserved, and this force is
utilized to assist the pump in its work.
In the Worthington Condenser the air set free by the condensation of the steam is intermingled
with the water. The pump haS the same regularity of motion that is characteristic of Worthington
pumping machinery; in fact, it acts as a water pump, although the water is aerated. There is
here a great distinction between the Worthington Condenser pumping aerated water, and an air
pump pumping air and water unmixed. In the latter case the air pump has a varying and
irregular duty to perform, and the inevitable result is an irregular and slamming movement.
The demands of electric lighting and manufacturing industries for economical steam power
point out clearly the value and the necessity of this adjunct of the steam engine. By the application
of the Worthington Condenser to non-condensing engines, twenty-five per cent, saving in the steam
consumption, and hence in the fuel burned, is frequently obtained. The increase in power often
exceeds thirty per cent.
In electric light and railway power stations this condenser may be found condensing the
steam and maintaining a vacuum upon both high and low speed engines of many kinds. It has
proved to be distinctively the condenser for dynamo engines. At the date of this catalogue it is
condensing the exhaust steam from engines developing, in the aggregate, over 2,500,000 horse
power.
See pages 72, 73, 84 and 85 for description of Worthington Cooling Towers and Condensers.


Worthington Patent Air Pump & Jet Condenser.
Regular Horizontal Pattern.

'-The above capacities are figured on a basis of condensing water not exceeding a temperature
of 60 deg. F.: in case of colder or warmer water, smaller or larger sizes should be selected.
With each air pump and jet condenser we supply a lubricator, drip-cocks, and full set of
spanners and socket wrenches.
The engraving shows a gate valve on the injection pipe. This valve is not supplied
with the condenser (unless specially ordered), but should always be placed on the injection pipe at
the most convenient point near the condenser.
The condenser is provided with our Patent Break-Vacuum Safety Attachment, etc., as illustrated.


Worthington Simplex Beam Air Pump
and Jet Condenser.
Size, 14in. X 22in. X 15in.


Worthington Patent
Vertical Single Acting Beam Air Pump.
Having one Simplex Steam Cylinder.
The engraving opposite illustrating our improved Vertical Air Pump and Jet Condenser shows
a comparatively new form of condensing apparatus. It is especially designed to occupy the least
amount of floor Space a very important feature in connection with electric light and power houses
or other steam plants where room is usually very limited.
The \ ertical Single-Acting Air Pump is a favourite type with many engineers and is often
considered more desirable than a Horizontal Double-acting Air Pump one of the’reasons being
the fact that the clearance spaces are much less and the direction of the flow of water and vapors’
is not changed in passing through the air cylinders. This and the natural tendency of the hot
vapors to rise, assist the air buckets in doing their work with the least number of strokes.
Another advantage of this design is the fact that the suction nozzle of the pump is very close
to the floor, so that the condenser stands much lower than with the “ horizontal” type of air pumps.
This is a very important feature where head room is limited, particularly in steam plants requiring
the condensing apparatus to be placed below the engine-room floor.

Worthington Combined Air & Circulating Pumps.


Worthington Patent Combined Air
and Circulating Pumps.
This special combination of Air Pump with Circulating Pump is one of the
most compact and economical arrangements for use with surface condensers for
stationary or marine engines. The steam cylinder of this pump is fitted with
our patent outside valve motion whicli can be adjusted to run the full length of
stroke under all conditions of speed. Both the air and circulating pump
cylinders are brass fitted throughout; the pistons, piston rods, valve seats and
bolts are of brass. The pistons are of our improved type, being packed with
hemp packing which can be set out as wear takes place.
The engraving on opposite page shows the water cylinder provided with a
bye-pass valve for regulating the amount of circulating water where its
temperature varies with the season of the year, as is usually the case. This
valve is attached to pumps of the size illustrated and larger sizes. The air
cylinders of all sizes are provided with a priming-valve at each end (as shown)
for sealing the suction valves and priming the pump.
We also arrange our Combined Air and Circulating Pumps when desired,
with compound steam cylinders for the medium and larger sizes. This type of
pump is illustrated at the bottom of opposite page.

Worthington Improved Surface Condenser mounted on
Combined Air and Circulating Pump.


Worthington Improved Surface
Condenser
Mounted on Combined Air and Circulating Pump.
Our Combined Condensing Plant is the most compact and simple machine on ths market.
The condenser being placed above the pumps gives perfect drainage into the air pump, which
not only avoids the expense of extra piping but allows the highest vacuum to be obtained.
The Condenser is of our rectangular design having shell of high grade cast iron
well ribbed.
The tube heads are of brass, and the tubes of solid drawn brass tinned inside and outside.
They are secured in the tube heads with our latest pattern brass ferrule, and packed with linen
packing. The ferrule is designed so that it is impossible for the tubes to creep.
The water covers are arranged so that they can be removed without disturbing the tube
plates or interfering with any pipe work. The exhaust steam on entering the Condenser comes
in contact with a perforated baffle plate, and thus distributes the steam overall the tubes.
The necessary hand holes are provided in the steam and water space so that the Condenser
can be readiiy examined.
The pumps are of our combined type as illustrated and described on pages 70 and 71 of this
catalogue.
When required, we can quote for these Condensers mounted on our combined air and
circulating pumps with Tandem compound Steam Cylinders—see pages 70 and 71.
We also supply our Condensers with our Electrically driven Air and Circulating Pumps.

Worthington Wet Vacuum Pump.
Horizontal Pattern with Piston Steam Valves.


Worthington Wet Vacuum Pump.
Patented.
In the operation of the Wet System of Condensation, there has been for a long time a demand
for an apparatus that will produce a steady and high degree of vacuum without complications of
machinery.
These pumps are exceedingly simple. The steam valves of a patented Piston form, and as
two steam cylinders and two air cylinders are located side by side, and the piston-rod of one pump
through the intervening val ve motion operates the steam valve of the other pump, the whole power
of either steam cylinder is thus available to move the opposite steam valve, whereas in the single
cylinder pumps, wnich require steam thrown valves actuated by small supplemental pistons, no
such surplus power is available.
All the working parts of the Worthington Wet Vacuum Pump that require oiling are in the
steam chest, and are there lubricated by the steam and the oil contained in it. This feature allows
long periods of running without attention. This is important in connection with surface condensers
and with those systems of building heating that employ a vacuum of greater or less degree on the
returns, and where machines that expose delicate parts or require constant attendance cannot safely
be placed.
Special consideration will be given to the selection of this apparatus for use with Surface
Condensers, Keel Condensers, Vacuum Pans, Multiple Effect Evaporating Apparatus, Stills and
Heating Systems.
It must be remembered, in comparing these sizes with Single Cylinder Pumps, that the
Worthington Wet Vacuum Pump has two double acting pistons working together, and is, therefore,
double the capacity of a single cylinder pump with a piston of same diameter.

Single Rotative Dry Vacuum Pump.
These can also be used as blowers for air pressures not exceeding 15 lbs. per square inch.
Size, 12in. X 22in. X 18in.


Worthington Improved
Rotative Dry Vacuum Pump.
This is a new form of vacuum pump of the type used for the dry system, and has been
designed and constructed to meet requirements calling for pumps of large capacity with high
degree of vacuum, such as in the case of sugar refineries and vacuum pans in general, for
preserving processes, for removal of air from underneath covers in canning goods, and for central
condensing systems.
This machine is built both of the single type and of the duplex type. It will be seen by the
illustrations, both single and duplex, that the machines are compact, substantial and simple, with
double-acting steam cylinders, and double-acting vacuum cylinders, the pistons operating in both
being mounted on the same piston rod. The fly-wheels are of such weight as to admit of operation
at very slow speed. No water is used inside the vacuum cylinders for cooling. The vacuum
cylinders are cooled by means of water jackets either in the cylinder heads or in the barrels
of cylinders. The suction valves of vacuum cylinder are positively operated by means of eccentrics,
and the speed of the machine is only limited by the conditions limiting the speed of ordinary steam
engines. The ordinary running speed of these machines is 100 revolutions per minute (for 18 inch
stroke or less) and can be exceeded, depending upon length of stroke and the size of the machine.
The fly-wheels are proportioned for a speed less than 100 revolutions per minute and the lower
speeds may be obtained by adjusting the governor to the speed required. As no water is admitted
to the inside of the vacuum cylinders no difficulty is encountered in removing it at the end of
stroke, thus admitting of high rotative speed, while most rotative dry vacuum pumps of other
manufacturers employing the ordinary suction and delivery valves, require water injected inside
the vacuum c\ linders to keep the cylinders cool and to seal the valves, thus requiring these pumps
to run at a slow rate of speed so that the water can be discharged as the pump approaches the end
of its stroke the result is that a machine has to be employed,practically double the size required
had one of our rotative dry vacuum pumps with mechanically operated suction valves, been used.
For high steam pressures we provide the steam cylinders with Meyer cut-off valves, at extra
price, producing a high economy in steam consumption.
The type of suction valves employed in the vacuum cylinders depends upon the size of
cylinders. The smaller machines have valves of the slide valve type and the larger machines rotary
valves of the Corliss type. The ports are of very liberal size so as to offer the least possible
friction to the vapours handled. The suction valves, being mechanically moved, open promptly to
the full extent and offer no obstruction tc the entrance of the vapours into the vacuum cylinders,
instead of compelling the vapour to overcome the tension of the suction valve springs before the
suction valvescan open, as in the ordinary type of vacuum pump. The design of the valves in the
vacuum cylinders is such that all vapour remaining in the clearance space, at the end of the stroke
of the vacuum piston is removed by means of an equalizing port in the valve which connects the
two opposite ends of the vacuum cylinder together when the piston is at the end of its stroke.
The result of this is, that the vapours collected in the clearance space in front of the piston at
atmospheric pressure, pass back into the large vacuum space at the back of the piston, the
pressure on the two sides of the vacuum piston being thus equalized and reduced to very neaily
that maintained in the suction pipe, so that when the piston begins to make its return stroke,
instead of the clearance space being filled with vapour at atmospheric pressure, which would
expand and prevent the immediate production of a complete vacuum, work begins at once and
practically the full displacement of the vacuum piston is effective at each stroke.
One of the most important features of this machine is that, although it may be run at constant
speed, the steam consumption in driving it is in proportion to the work done. The steam
and vacuum cylinders are made of close grained cast iron, as hard as can be machined. Steam
and vacuum pistons are of cast iron, with packing rings, and both pistons are machined on the
outside. The connecting rods are of best open hearth forged steel, arranged with special adjust-
ments The steam valves are of the common B type, fitted with Meyer cut-off when specially
ordered. In this case the steam valve consists of two parts, the main and distributing valves.
When the Meyer cut-off is used, the point of cut-off is indicated bya pointer and scale, and the
point of cut-off is adjusted by means of a handwheel. The valve gear is a modification of the
eccentric motion giving a quicker movement of the valves than is possible with the ordinary
eccentric motion. The beds of both the single and duplex type are designed to resist and with-
stand the severest strains. The main bearings have broad surfaces, with adjustments for taking
up wear, and are heavily babbitted. The quality of material and workmanship employed on these
machines is of the best, and everything is subjected to a rigid test and inspection under conditions
as nearly approaching the working conditions as possible, before leaving the factory.
Every machine is provided with centrifugal speed governor, and with oiling device.
For illustrations see pages 76 and 78. For sizes see page 79,

Worthington Simplex Twin Vertical
Beam Air Pump.
Size, 12in. X 25in. X 18in.


Worthington Patent Vertical Twin Air
Pump.
(Single Acting Beam Pattern).
This novel and very efficient design of Vertical Air Pump, combining two
double-acting steam cylinders with two single-acting air cylinders, as illustrated
on the opposite page, is of special importance where floor space is limited and
high vacuum desired for the least expenditure of power. It has many other
advantages that recommend it for marine service, such as simplicity, compact-
ness, quiet running, and wide range of speed and capacity.
The air cylinders are of the well-known vertical single-acting type, with
foot, and bucket valves, all accessible through conveniently located hand-holes.
By means of the working beams, links and rods, connecting the air buckets and
steam piston, a proper balance is established, consequently there is a uniform and
smooth action throughout. There being two buckets, the discharge of water and
air is continuous.

“The above capacities are figured on a basis of condensing water not exceeding a temperature
of 60 deg. F.; in case of colder or warmer water, smaller or larger sizes should be selected.
The double-acting steam cylinders are especially designed for the purpose of being operated
with our latest improved valve gear, which is perfectly positive at all speeds. The pump can be
adjusted to run full length of stroke, even while in operation. We also provide these pumps with
cross compound steam cylinders.
The air cylinders are of cast-iron lined with composition, and the buckets of cast-iron,
packed with adjustable fibrous packing, held in place by composition followers, &c. The valves
are of specially vulcanized rubber and work on composition seats; valve bolts also of composition ;
valve springs of phosphor-bronze.
The code word covers a pump with iron air end, brass lined. The bucket and bucket rods
are of iron. If the pump has to be provided with head valves on iron plates, add code word

Worthington Central Condenser.
Capacity 3,000 H.P.


Worthington Central Condenser.
PATENTED.
The Worthington system of central condensation, by which the exhaust steam of the engines of
an entire plant may be condensed by one condenser, possesses so many features of value that it is
being extensively introduced into large power stations, rolling mills, and blast furnace
engine houses. It reduces the apparatus to the simplest form, and at the same time allows the use
of more economical types of condenser and pumps than is possible with relatively small individual
condensers for each engine unit. Attendance and wear and tear are reduced to a minimum, and
the degree of vacuum obtained is higher than that with ordinary air pumps and condensers. Any
number of engines scattered over an extended area may be exhausted into the system, and part of
them may be started up and shut down without interfering with the others.
A characteristic of the system is the use of separate water and dry vacuum pumps. The former
handles simply the water for condensation, which it lifts by suction, and discharges into the con-
denser. The condenser is placed in an elevated position about thirty feet above the hot well, and
the water falls out of it by gravity against the pressure of the atmosphere. As the condenser has no
connection with the suction pipe of the water pump, except through that pump, it will be seen
that a fluctuation or sudden fall of the vacuum in the condenser does not cause a loss of suction as
would be the case with the ordinary type of jet condenser, in which the vacuum in the condenser
lifts the injection water. This feature makes the central condenser especially adapted to situations
where there is apt to be a sudden overload thrown on the condenser, such as obtains in electric
railway power houses and rolling mills. The water pump, as it has a uniform duty to perform, is
usually provided with compound or triple expansion steam cylinders. This places it on the same
basis as regards economy as pumps employed in water-works pumping stations.
As the water pump is assisted in lifting the water by the vacuum in the condenser, it is readily
primed on starting up, and the load upon the pump reduced in proportion to this benefit on
regular work. The former feature is of value when long suction pipes are used. The vacuum
pump may be started up and the air removed from the suction pipe ; the water will then flow in
until above the pump valves, when the pump can be immediately put into service.
The duty of the vacuum pump is to exhaust the air from the condenser and the pipe system
This pump is designed on the most economical lines, which is made possible by the fact that the air
is cooled by an air cooler in the injection pipe, and is practically free from water. A description of
Worthington rotative dry vacuum pump will be found on page 77.
Anyone interested in tins type of condensing apparatus would do well to communicate
with us.

Worthington Water Cooling Tower.
Fan Type.


Worthington Cooling Towers.
The necessity of running engines condensing is evident to every engineer
who has studied this problem, but there are many cases where condensing is
impossible because either there is a limited supply of water available for
circulating purposes or no supply at all. To meet this want various methods
have been adopted whereby circulating water can be cooled and used over
again in the condenser ; one method has been to construct a large pond or
reservoir and to pump the water by the circulating pump into one end and
take the cooled water out at the other. The objections to this system are that
a large area of land has to be used for the purpose and this is not always
available near electricity works, power stations or manufacturing centres, and
the cost of the land is often greater than the gain effected. Another drawback
is that a very large proportion of the water is lost by evaporation, while the
amount of cooling is not very great. In order, therefore, to overcome this
difficulty, we have designed various types of cooling towers in which the
circulating water is cooled. The towers are of various designs, some can be
mounted upon a roof, should no ground space be available, or they can be
built over reservoirs or tanks on the ground line, and in any case they qlways
occupy a great deal less ground area than a pond.
We have had large experience in the manufacture of Water-cooling Towers
for cooling circulating water in connection with condensing plant.
We illustrate on the opposite page one of our steel cooling towers with fan
for forced draught. The special feature of these towers is the method of
distributing the water over the cooling medium. The steel mats are suspended
from the distribution troughs in such a way that the hot water is equally
divided over the whole area of the cooling surface, and thus the efficiency of
these towers is very high.
In addition to the above we also build wooden cooling towers. These
towers occupy a much larger ground space than the steel towers but where
space is available they are much less costly than the steel type.
As the various duties for which these towers are built are continually
changing we cannot give a full list of sizes and capacities, but we will be
happy to forward drawings and specifications to any of our clients on receipt of
their enquiries.


Beer Racking Pumps.
Size, 7½in. X 9in. X 10in.


Worthington Beer Racking Pump.
'l'lie Worthington Beer Racking Pump and Reservoir is the result of a
continually increasing demand! among brewers for an inexpensive and, at the
same time, a reliable machine for racking beer.
This apparatus, which embodies many recent improvements, is entirely new,
having been especially designed to meet the requirements of the service for which
it is intended.
As will be seen from the cut on theoposite page, the Compressor is mounted
on an Air Reservoir, of such dimensions as to give proper storage capacity, this
Reservoir also serving as a bed plate. The air cylinders are composition lined,
and the piston rods are of brass. Each machine is fitted with a lubricator, glass
water gauge, pressure gauge, drip cocks and automatic air pressure regulator
complete.
As evidence of its superiority, we need only call attention to the following
features in which it differs materially from all other machines offered for the
same purpose.
The Pressure Regulator automatically controls the speed, slowing down and
finally stopping the pump when the desired air pressure is obtained, and
gradually starting up again when the air is withdrawn from the Reservoir.
The entire apparatus is compact, durable and self-contained, has no intricate
working parts liable to get out of order, and requires little if any attention on
the part of the engineer.
To select the size best adapted to any special case, it is necessary when
ordering to state :
The maximum gauge pressure against which the Compressor is to work;
The number of cubic feet of air at atmospheric pressure required per minute;
The available effective steam pressure.
The following sizes, which are constantly kept in stock, can be supplied on
short notice.

Worthington Water Motor.


Worthington Water Motor.
The cut on the opposite page illustrates a Worthington Water Motor of ordinary size. These
machines are designed to be driven by water pressure instead of steam. In their construction they
do not differ materially from the Standard Worthington Steam Pump, except that the driving
cylinders are provided with extra large passages suitable for the prompt and easy flow of the water.
A large number of these motors are in use, giving excellent satisfaction, and under various
conditions of service as regards driving head, pumping head, and quantity of water required to be
pumped per minute, ranging from one gallon per minute to over a million gallons in twenty-
four hours.
As the.conditions of driving head and pumping lift vary in every case, it is always necessary
in designing these motors, to know the head in feet, or pounds per square inch, and quantity in
gallons per minute available for driving the motor; also the gallons per minute to be pumped, and
against what head or pressure ; also whether the water to be pumped is the same as that used for
driving the machine or not.
For the above reasons we cannot furnish a regular list of sizes, as each demand, having
different conditions, requires a special proportioning of the driving and pumping cylinders to
suit the case.
When the following information is furnished, Worthington Water Motors adapted for any
conditions of service and of any capacity can be supplied:
ist. Height to which the water is to be pumped, its quality, and length of delivery pipe from
motor to point of delivery.
2nd. Head in feet, or pounds pressure per square inch, under which the water to be used in
driving the machine will enter the cylinder, and the quantity available.
3rd. The length of supply pipe from fountain head to the machine.
4th. Whether the pump suction can be taken from the driving supply pipe or from some
other source.
The Worthington Water Motor received an award at the World’s Columbian Exposition
which read as follows
“Two pressure cylinders, worked with water pressure at one end, drive two pumps at the
other. The valve motion is a tappet motion, one piston rod giving motion to the valve on the
other cylinder. It may be regarded as an Hydraulic Relay or pressure intensifier. It is a very
useful appliance, and can be employed to pump water at a long distance, instead of having an
isolated steam plant, which would require more attention, and, in many cases, an extra boiler
and attendant.”


Worthington Automatic Pump and
Receiver.


Worthington Automatic Pump and
Receiver.
In Factories, Hotels and Apartment Houses, or in any building where steam is used for heating
purposes, it is always desirable, and generally necessary, to provide an apparatus for draining the
radiators, coils, and steam pipes, and also to feed automatically to the boilers the water of
condensation while it is in the hottest condition. The absence of a suitable arrangement of this
kind is often the cause of the disagreeable snapping and hammering sound in radiators and steam
pipes which, particularly in Hotels and Apartment Houses, it is important to avoid. In manufac-
turing establishments, the addition of such an apparatus is not only a source of economy in coal
consumption, but it increases the efficiency of the heating plant.
The Worthington Automatic Pump and Receiver was designed to meet the several require-
ments of this service, with the simplest and least complicated form of construction. This machine
combines simplicity of construction with such improvements as especially fit it to the best modern
practice in steam heating and circulation.
The operation of the Worthington Pump and Receiver may briefly be described as follows
The supply of steam which operates the pump is controlled by a valve and float in the receiver. As
the water enters into the receiver the float is allowed to fill with water; the weight of float filled
with water is counterbalanced by an iron weight on the outside, this acting upon the valve causes
it to admit steam to the pump.” The latter at once feeds this hot water of condensation to the
boiler without allowing it to cool. The above operation is repeated as the receiver fills, so that at
all times the action of the pump is to automatically supply to the boiler whatever water enters
the receiver.
The receiver rests on a solid base or bed plate, which also supports the pump. The connections
and; fittings shown in the cut are furnished with the machine. These consist of suction and steam
pipes from pump to receiver, and a gauge glass. The latter, however, is not a necessary attachment
to the receiver, as it is impossible for the water level to fall below the level to which the
governing appliance adjusts it. The pump is the Worthington Standard Feed Pump, but the Low
Steam Pressure Pump, described on page 37, can be used in places where it is necessary to carry
steam at low pressure, the extra expense of the charge being inconsiderable.
The following list gives the sizes usually kept in stock. Other sizes for special service can be
furnished, if required.

Worthington Jacket Tank and Pump.
In connection with engines having steam jacketed cylinders, an arrangement similar to the
above is used, which returns the steam as fast as condensed in the jackets directly back to the
boiler, without bringing it in contact with the atmosphere. In this case the steam for working the
pump is taken from the inside of the receiver itself.
This arrangement is much more economical than turning the condensed steam into a trap', as is
usually the case where the engines and boilers are not so arranged that the water would trap
directly back to the boilers.

Worthington Steam Pump and Boiler.
The illustration on the opposite page represents the Worthington Steam Pump and Boiler,
complete with auxiliary feed, boiler base, smoke bonnet, water columns, gauge glass, gauge cocks’
steam gauge, safety valve, globe valves, two-way exhaust cock, blow-off cocks, steam and exhaust
pipes, boiler feed connections, and all necessary fittings.
The pumps can be fitted with an auxiliary end feed, attached to one of the piston rods. This
is the most durable, safe, and certain means of supplying the boiler with water that can be used.
The Low Service or “Tank” Pumps are suitable only for places where water is to be forced
not higher than 50 to 75 feet.
This apparatus is easily understood and managed. It is simple, compact, durable, economical
and efficient, and was designed with a special view to meeting the pumping requirements of Rail-
road Water Stations, Quarries. Brick Yards. Coffer Dams, Country Residences, and Hotels, and all
isolated places where a complete independent pumping plant is required.
The pumps will be fitted with water valves of rubber or metal as required.

Worthington Centrifugal Pumps.


Centrifugal Pumps for High Lifts.
During the last year or two there has been what might well be termed a
revolution in the design of Centrifugal Pumps. Formerly it was generally
taken for granted that a Centrifugal Pump could not be designed to work
satisfactorily at a greater head than 50 feet, the pump efficiency at this head
being considerably less than that obtainable with the first class of reciprocating
pump. Now, however, a change has taken place and our latest practice has
produced a centrifugal pump capable of operating against heads sometimes as
great as 2000 feet with an efficiency approximating that of a displacement
pump.
Worthington Turbine Pumps are built for all capacities and heads to suit
every condition of service, whether direct —connected to steam engine, electric
or other form of motor, belt or rope driven.
The design of our Turbine Pump is the embodiment of simplicity and the
highest degree of first-class workmanship, making an efficiency of 70 %to 80%
easily obtainable under suitable conditions.
The illustration on the opposite page shows a Five Stage Worthington
Turbine Pump which has been at work for some time at the Lewis Merthyr
Company’s Collieries in South Wales. This plant delivers 334 gallons per
minute against a head of 360 feet, and on test gave this duty with a pump
efficiency of 74 %.
For complete information on the subject of Worthington Turbine Pumps
w r e would refer those interested to our SPECIAL 'IURBINE CATALOGUE,
dealing exclusively with this subject.
Low Lift Pumps.
In addition to Turbine Pumps we have given very special attention to
Centrifugal Pumps suitable for lower heads, and are now in a position to give
prompt delivery of Low Lift Pumps for the largest capacities, and to guarantee
an efficiency hitherto unequalled.

Worthington Electric House Pump.


Worthington Electric House Pump.
I'he pump on opposite page was designed to meet an increased demand in
the larger cities for a means of supplying water to the upper floors of apartment
buildings or private residences at such times when the regular pressure on the
main is insufficient.
This pump has all the requirements to make it the best on the market,
viz. : noiselessness, simplicity and reasonableness of price.
It is particularly designed to operate in connection with a slow speed motor
of i H.P. capacity, although the actual amount of power consumed varies by
\ H.P. and i H.P., depending upon the head against which it is called upon to
pump.
We manufacture these pumps in six sizes ranging in capacities from 480 to
1700 gallons per hour.
They can be supplied with motor mounted on the same base plate as
illustrated, or with pulley only, thereby allowing power to be taken from any
other available source.
These machines can also be provided with double reduction of pulleys
should higher speed motors be used.

Duplex Horizontal Power Pump.


Worthington Regular Pattern
Duplex Power Pump.
The Regular Pattern Duplex Power Pump consists of our standard duplex
water end combined with a horizontal power end which supports the main pump
shaft, pinion shaft and driving gear. The cranks are set at 90 degrees. The
crossheads are guided above and below and are adjustable for wear. Journal
boxes on both the main shaft and crank shaft are lined with babbit. The frame,
crank discs, connecting rods and all other working parts are carefully designed
and constructed so as to best withstand the heavy strains to which they are
subjected. Each pump has two double-acting water plungers.
In cases where sufficient room is not available to permit driving by belt,
these pumps can be connected direct to an electric motor through a double
reduction of spur gearing.

Triplex Horizontal Single-Acting Portable
Mine Pump.
Fig. 885. Size 6 ½ in. X 8in.


Triplex Horizontal, Single-Acting,
Portable Mine Pump.
The pump shown in Fig. 885 on the opposite page is especially designed for
mine work. The horizontal pattern is best adapted for, low passageways, and
affords easy access to all parts. The crank shaft is of the composite design ; the
connecting rods are of the solid end type, fitted with adjustable boxes. The
gearing is machine cut and protected by metal guards. Outside ways and
crossheads are provided for guiding the travel of the plungers, which are
outside packed, a feature that greatly enhances the life of a mine pump, where
the water is acid, sulphurous or gritty.
The openings on the water cylinder are centrally located, which permits
of taking suction from either side of the track, and discharging at any angle
without complicated connections. The frame and bed is a single casting, and
extends under both pump and motor ; it is entirely of iron and not affected by
moisture, therefore perfect alignment of the machine is insured. The complete
apparatus is mounted on iron trucks and easily transported.

Air Compressors.
The use of compressed air is spreading so rapidly and so constantly that a complete list of its
applications would require more space than this catalogue can afford. It has been indispensable
for many years in mining, quarrying, tunnelling, and railroad work. Its widespread use in general
manufacturing is more recent; but w.e can safely say that to-day no large shop without a compress-
ing plant can pretend to economical adminstration. Because of its safety, its cheapness of trans-
mission and ease of application, it has already supplanted hydraulic and electric machinery in
many instances ; and it is common experience that in any shop possessing a supply of compressed
air, special uses and applications for it multiply amazingly. Its field in deep-well pumping is
already extensive. The part which it is to play in long-distance transmission, and in transportation,
has not yet been fully defined, but present conditions give great promise for the future.
We have been manufacturing compressing machinery for twenty years, and the development of
the field under our own eyes has given us exceptional opportunities to keep abreast and ahead of it
The experience of this long period has taught us the essentials of good compressor building, ana
has suggested points wherein departure from existing practice has proved advantageous. Special
machinery and improved methods of administration and inspection, while enabling us to enforce
an exceptionally high standard of accuracy and interchangeability of parts, also give us, in con-
nection with the volume of our business, material advantages over the smaller shop in the way of
economical production. And largely because of these factors we have been encouraged to incor-
porate in our construction certain features more expensive than the average maker deems profitable ;
our fork frame, solid forged shaft and corliss air valve gear are cases in point. Observation, how-
ever, and the appreciation of users, have justified us in the belief that high-grade work adds more
to a machine’s value than to its cost; and that with a broader knowledge of compressed air require-
ments a steadily increasing proportion of buyers realize that the true measure of a compressor's
economy is determined not so much by its price as by the closeness of its builder’s adherence to
correct principles of design and construction.

General Specification of Worthington
Air Compressors.
CYLINDERS. Our cylinders, both air and steam, are cast of hard, close-grained iron, the
surface of which in use assumes a smooth, glassy character, and with proper lubrication is affected
very slowly by subsequent wear.
PISTONS. Pistons, except in special cases, are fitted with Harris-Babbit self-adjusting
packing rings ; these are made in segments in order that they may accommodate themselves closely
to slight changes in cylinder-bore due to wear. The joints are broken, and the segments held out
by light springs. of German silver wire. The piston is simple, durable, tight, and runs with less
Friction than any other type made.
ALIGNMENT. In all our machines rigid alignment is secured by the use of cast-iron
housings or bed plafes, the joints being made with matching tongues and grooves or straight
flanges. Studs or dowel pins are never relied upon to maintain alignment.
SPEED RATINGS. Our compressors can, with perfect safety, be run considerably faster
than their rated speeds. We have thought best to list their capacities conservatively, even at the
risk of unfavorable comparison with the ratings of other builders. -Our figures, however, can be
attained in steady running year in and year out, and are not merely outside limits of performance.
TESTING. Each machine before leaving our shops is rigidly inspected and throoughly tested
under more severe conditions than are likely to be met with in actual practice. This insures the pur-
chaser against the development of defects and consequent delays during erection on his premises.
FOUNDATION PLANS. A blue print will be furnished, on request, with each compressor
showing the arrangement of foundations and foundation bolts, the location of main pipe connec-
tions, and over-all dimensions.
WORKMANSHIP, MATERIAL AND FINISH. Every part of our machinery is made to
template, and can be duplicated accurately. Castings are properly scraped and filled, and, unless
otherwise specified, two coats of steel-colored paint are applied. Bright work is highly polished
and well greased, and leaded before despatch, as a protection against rust. Workmanship,
material and finish are of the highest excellence throughout, not only on our Corliss type, but on
our smaller machines as well. Reduction in cost in the case of the latter is effected not by slighting
them in construction, but by lessening the number of their parts. We are prepared to guarantee
our output fully, and to maintain a reputation based on many years of conscientious work.

features of peculiar difficulty. The ordinary
direct acting deep well pump, though oftentimes
indispensable, is in many cases not wholly
satisfactory; while complication, expense and
lack of space forbid the employment in driven
wells of most of the direct air displacement
devices. We believe that, under usual conditions,
the air lift is by far the best solution of the
problem yet reached. We have installed a large
number of plants, and are prepared to bid on
the equipment of wells for any capacity.
In principle and operation the air lift is extremely simple. Air is injected
through a nozzle placed below the working water level, and rising, carries
water up with it. The submerged parts are subject to no wear whatever, and,
except for corrosion, are practically indestructible, even when working in the
gritty water so fatal to deep well pump pistons. The air compressor and
receiver, the only parts needing attention, are at the surface, and readily
accessible. Our experiments have been extensive and systematic, and we have
determined conclusively that when proper submergence of the air nozzle can be
assured, the yield of a well previously fitted with a deep well pump is doubled
or trebled by the use of the air lift. The sparkle and life imparted to the


water raised, and the cooling effect of the expanding air, make this method
peculiarly suitable for water works purposes ; while owing to the absence of
pump rod and plunger friction, and the superior steam economy of the fly-
wheel compressor, better duty can be obtained than with the old style pump
When warm water is to be raised, its heat, instead of being a disadvantage
is a source of increased economy.
A certain minimum ratio between submergence of the nozzle and height
of lift is, however, essential to the successful working of an air lift, and
inquiries should inform us on the following points :
(1) Depth of water level below desired discharge level both when well
is being worked and at rest.
(2) Style of pump used and yield obtained if the well has been pre-
viously worked.
(3) Total depth of well below' discharge level.
(4) Diameter and condition of well casing.
(5) Peculiarities in temperature or quality of water.
As manufacturers of apparatus for raising liquids under the three principal
systems—by direct displacement, as in ordinary pumping ;by air displacement,
as in the “ racking ” of beer and chemicals ; and by the air lift—w'e believe
that we can give less biased and more valuable advice as to the equipment
best suited to given conditions than can the makers of any single type. We
issue a special catalogue on deep well pumping, which we will forward on
application.


Worthington Automatic Feed Pump.
(Arrangement of Two Worthington Vertical Marine Pumps and Hot Well.)


Worthington Automatic Feed Pump.
The introduction of the high steam pressures used in triple and quadruple expansion engines,
as well as the increased piston speed at which these engines are now run, has led to the removal of
the feed pumps from the main engines, and the adoption of independent pumps in lieu thereof for
this service.
With pumps fitted to the main engines and running at a fixed speed, it is an impossibility to so
proportion them as to insure the chambers being completely filled at each stroke, as the supply
delivered by the air pumps is not uniform ; and whenever the pump chambers fail to fill, especially
with the high pressures now met with, the shock soon renders the pumps inoperative. Moreover’
this concussion or water hammer, owing to the intermittent delivery of attached pumps, is so great
as to cause serious danger of rupture in the pipes.
In dealing with liquids under heavy pressures, it is of the utmost importance that the pump
chambers should always fill, and that the delivery should be constant and uniform, and thus avoid
the shock inseparable from single-acting and single-cylinder pumps, in which the flow of water
comes to rest at each reversal of the pump plunger. This result is fully accomplished in the
Worthington Pump, which, as stated on page 7, gives a constant and uniform delivery, with entire
absence of anything like shock or water hammer in the pipes.
For use on shipboard, it is customary to arrange the independent feed pumps so that the water
is delivered into the boilers, as fast as it comes over from the air pumps. This is usually accomplished
by the use of a float in a tank or hot-well, which controls the speed at which the pumps are run,
completely shutting off the steam from the pump, and stopping it in case water fails to come over,
and gradually opening the valve again as the water is delivered into the hot-well. This necessitates
that the pump used for this service shall have no dead centre, and shall always be in a position to
start.
In addition to these advantages, Independent Worthington Pumps for feed pumps as well as
for bilge and ballast service, will be found more economical than pumps driven from the main
engines, provided a proper utilisation is made of the heat of the exhaust steam used by the pumps.
The cut on the opposite page shows the general arrangement of two feed pumps with automatic
regulator for this service, but which may be varied in detail to suit existing requirements. In this
the float A rising in the tank B as the water is delivered over by the air pumps, gradually opens
the steam valve C> and puts one or both of the pumps in motion, the speed of the pump being
dependent upon the height of the water in the hot-well. Should no water be delivered over by the
air pump, or should the water lower in the supply tank or hot-well, the float gradually
slows up the pump, bringing it to a complete stop before the suction pipe is uncovered.
In this arrangement either pump can be made to pump from the hot-well to the boiler direct, or
through a heater. For description of the Worthington Marine Feed Water Heater, see pages
13S and 137.
Prices and particulars of Worthington Automatic Feed Pumps, suited to any particular case,
will be furnished upon receipt of the necessary particulars.

Worthington Improved Marine Feed
Water Heater.
The advantages to be gained by using auxiliary feed water heaters in
connection with marine engines are so thoroughly recognized that it is
hardly necessary to dwell on the subject except to say that, if the condensers
can be relieved of the exhaust steam from the auxiliary engines and steam
pumps, and a large portion of the heat in this exhaust steam carried back to the
boilers, by means of the feed water, such heaters not only effect economy in
coal, but add to the life of the boilers and save many repair bills.
In calling attention to the “ Worthington ” heater, which will raise the feed
water from the hot well temperature up to as high as 210 to 220 degrees
Fahrenheit, it will be seen by the cut, on the opposite page, that it is arranged
in two sections. In the upper section the exhaust steam and feed water are
brought together by means of a spray cone, which is adjustable from the outside,
and the heat of the steam is thoroughly absorbed by the feed water. The water
then gravitates to the receiver below, where it is allowed to accumulate only in
sufficient quantity to operate the float, which, by means of the levers, rods, etc.,
controls the steam throttle valve that supplies steam to the feed pump. This
valve is a balanced “ chronometer ” valve, and operates the speed of the pump
in the most positive manner. The feed water from the hot well tank is
pumped up by a pump into the heater through the “ feed water inlet,” the water
spraying through the adjustable cone into the dome of the heater. After
passing through the spray nozzle in the form of a thin sheet, the water is still
further atomized by two perforated baffle plates. The exhaust steam from the
auxiliary engines, steam pumps, etc., enters the heater by the “steam exhaust
inlet nozzle ” through the automatic check valve. This check valve is provided
with a dash pot on the upper side. The amount of “cushion” for this dash
pot is adjustable from the outside, by means of the hand-wheels shown.
The great advantage of the “ Worthington ” heater over the usual form of
marine feed water heaters of the open jet type is in the receiving chamber
referred to. This receiver acts as a reservoir, in which the water loses it turbidity
frees itself from vapours, and maintains a steady, even level; so that the ball
float governing the speed of the feed pump moves slowly and with the least

oscillating movement, thus avoiding the uneven motion to which other forms of
heaters are liable. The feed pump is therefore prevented from entirely draining
the heater and becoming vapour bound. The ball float is counterbalanced,
and owing to its being m a horizontal chamber, it has a radius of action not
possible in a vertical cylinder of reasonable size.
The “ Worthington ” heater is also provided with an air valve for allowing the
air and noncondensible vapours to pass from the top of the heater to the surface
condenser. The safety valve, also located on top of the heater, can be set at
any pressure desired —usually the pressure carried in the low pressure receiver
of the engine. NOTE. —The usual practice is to have a branch pipe connecting
the heater with the receiver of the, low pressure cyiinder of the engine, so that any
surplus of exhaust steam from the auxiliaries not condensed by the feed water will
pass to the engine—or vice versa. The heater is also provided with steam and
water pressure gauges. l'he glass water gauge located at one end of the
receiver shows clearly the level of the water. Both heater and receiver are
well covered with non-conducting material, and neatly lagged with Russia iron.
Although the “ Worthington” Marine Feed Water Heater has been in the
market only for a few years, it has been applied to some of the largest
“ Atlantic Greyhounds,” as well as many of the fast coasting steamers. It is
also in use on many of the German, French and Mail Steamers, and upon
other Government Vessels.

Worthington Multi-Current Feed Water Heater.
Horizontal Design.
Size, 800 Horse Power.


Worthington Multi-current Feed
Water Heater.
Where it is desired to heat the feed water by the main engine exhaust before the latter
is finally discharged to the atmosphere or a condenser it is necessary to use a tubular heater.
As the result of careful investigation we have been able to increase greatly the efficiency
of this type.
In the apparatus shown herewith the steam traverses the length of the heater three times
and the water six times, giving not only high velocity, but also a small water core through
which the heat must pass, and the counter currents of water and steam so essential to the rapid
transfer of heat. The tubes are easily accessible for cleaning and special care has been taken
to provide for expansion and contraction, thus making it possible to use copper or brass tubes as
occasion requires. The ends of the tubes are firmly expanded and secured in the two heads
one of which is rigid and part of the main shell casting, while the other head is a copper plate
or diaphragm, the periphery of which is attached to the flange of the heater shell. This arrange-
ment takes care of the unequal expansion between the tubes and the shell, and is absolutely
reliable and free from strain under all conditions of temperature and pressure. The tubes are
arranged in six nests and the flow of water through them is controlled by partitions in the water
chambers at each end of the heater, so that the water will pass through each nest in turn, thus
traversing the heater six times. The circulation is positive and the heater is designed to give an
even distribution of water, avoiding a sluggish flow or positive stagnation, which often appears in
the ordinary tubular heaters not designed on correct principles. The exhaust steam from the engine
is thoroughly and evenly distributed by means of partitions in the heater shell and the flow is
so diverted as to pass three times through the heater and circulate freely among the tubes. The
total absence of stuffing boxes and packings of any kind in this heater does away entirely with the
possibility of leakage and loss of feed water. The trouble experienced in other heaters with tube
packings subjected to high temperature and pressures have been a source of continual annoyance
and dissatisfaction. The cross-sectional area between the tubes is greater than the area of the
exhaust pipe, offering no obstruction to the flow of the steam and thus eliminating back pressure.
Entrained water is removed by drip pipes.
Access to the heater is had by removing the heads; the tubes of the vertical heaters can be
cleaned from the top and the horizontal heaters from either end. Feet or saddles are furnished as
occasion requires. Mud-blows are provided to keep the heater clean and free from sediment.
Every heater is tested under 250 'pounds pressure per square inch, giving a safe working pressure
of 175 pounds. The heaters are made in sizes up to 5,000 horse-power in both the horizontal and
vertical types.


Worthington Automatic Pressure
Regulator and Safety Draining
Attachment.


Worthington Automatic Pressure
Regulator.
It is often desirable, as well for convenience as for safety, that the pressure against which a
steam pump is working should be kept uniform while delivering directly into a system of pipes
where the demand for water is intermittent. This can be accomplished only by means of some
device whereby the water pressure in the discharge pipe is made to control automatically the
admittance of steam to the steam cylinders.
The Worthington Regulator is designed for this purpose, and has proved entirely reliable. By
means of it the pump can be removed at any distance from the attendant, who need merely supply
it with steam from a convenient point, and the Regulator will control its action, preventing the
pipes from being subjected to undue pressure.
It has proved a very valuable and convenient attachment to pumps used for the supply and fire
protection of mills, or manufacturing establishments generally, in connection with hydrants or
with automatic sprinklers, where it is not only necessary that the pressure in the pipes should be
kept constant to meet immediate demands in case of fire, but that the pump should be instantly
started with the opening of the first sprinkler or hydrant. This result the Regulator can be relied
upon to secure.
In the illustration opposite, the Regulator is shown attached to a Worthington Fire Pump.
The cylinder of the Regulator contains a spring (not shown in cut opposite) which can be set, by
means of suitable check nuts, for any desired pressure. When that pressure is reached in the
discharge pipe of the pump, it is communicated by means of the small connecting pipe to the piston
within the cylinder. This piston, being attached to the balance steam valve, shuts off the steam in
the steam pipe, either stopping or slowing down the pump. When the water pressure falls, the
action of the Regulator is reversed, and the pump moves forward with such speed as is necessary
to raise it to the required point.

Worthington Safety Draining
Attachment.
The Worthington Safety Draining Attachment, also illustrated on the opposite page, is
designed to automatically drain the water of condensation from the steam cylinders without loss
of live steam.
It consists of suitable connecting pipes draining into a steam trap and provided with automatic
check valves. It is very simple in construction, and durable, and has been found entirely reliable in
its operation. It is recommended for use on steam pumps employed for fire protection, especially in
connection with the Worthington Pressure Regulator above described. Without this safety
attachment the steam pistons of pumps used on this service may be prevented from acting promptly
at a most critical moment, by being suddenly called upon to move without time being given to
drain the cylinders or the connecting steam pipe of such water as may have collected in them from
the condensation of the steam. While the only effect of this on the Worthington pump is
to delay somewhat its attaining full speed, in some forms of pumps it often results in serious
accident, amounting occasionally to a complete wrecking of the machine.

Worthington Strainer-Box & Strainer.
, 11 °[ t v f n necessa ry, and generally desirable, that there should be a strainer attached some-
where to the supply pipe of a pump. The difficulty of reaching it in case it should become
obstructed and require cleaning is the great objection to placing it on the end of the supply pipe
furthest from the pump, and has led to the design and adoption of the arrangement shown in the
illustration opposite.
As will be seen by an examination of the illustration, the strainer consists of a cylindrical cast-
ing with removable cover, having nozzles which permit its being placed in the horizontal part of the
suction pipe, forming a section of the same. The strainer proper consists of two cast brass grated
p ates which rest in vertical grooves, being so placed as to give the maximum area, and offer the
least resistance to the flow of the water. The plates can be readily removed and cleaned.
I his strainer can in some cases be connected direct to the suction flange of the pump, but in
order not to interfere with the removal of water cylinder heads, it is recommended that a section of
pipe or spool piece be interposed between the strainer and the pump.
Special Strainers of larger sizes than those included in the list can be furnished.

Worthington Check and Foot Valves.
These patterns are constructed with especial care as to proper proportion and strength, com-
bined with good material and workmanship. The areas of their passages are sufficiently lar'o-e to
admit of the fluid passing through them with the minimum amount of frictional resistance.
I he interior of the Check Valves can be reached by means of convenient hand-holes.
For the larger sizes of Foot Valves is provided an attachment, designed to relieve the valve and
the supply pipe of any undue internal pressure to .which they might be subjected. This is in
many cases, a verj r necessary safeguard, as with pumping machinery working under severe resist-
ances the water pressure can be transmitted through leakages from the force to the supply main
while the engine is at rest, and is generally sufficient to burst the foot valve or the suction chamber
of the pump if they are not relieved through a safety device of this character.
Ihe following list comprises the regular patterns of valves. They are usually kept in stock

Worthington Steam Accumulator.


Worthington Steam Accumulator.
While the use of steam accumulators for storing hydraulic
power is not new, it is only within the last few years that this
machine has received the attention it deserves and has been
perfected in its detail so that it can be placed on the market
ready to meet the demands of any service.
The cut on opposite page illustrates a horizontal accum-
lator of this type manufactured and patented by the Worthing-
ton Pump Company, Limited. It consists of an ordinary steam
cylinder such as would be used in a steam engine, excepting
that it has no ports or valve, combined with a ram cylinder
similar to that of a weighted accumulator. Instead of a
weight, a steam piston, acted on by a fixed steam pressure
exerts the necessary force on the ram. The ram is securely
bolted to the piston and passes through two stuffing-boxes, one
in the steam cylinder head and the other in the ram cylinder
The stuffing box in the steam cylinder head is lightly packed
as its only office is to prevent the leakage of the exhaust steam
which is let into the back end of the steam cylinder to keep hot
the walls of the cylinder and th§ piston.
The supply of steam to the pump is regulated to meet the
variations of consumption of water in the following manner :
The regulating pipe consists of a polished perforated pipe
of proper diameter, which at one end is connected to an open-
ing through the centre of the accumulator steam cylinder
head, and passes longitudinally through the centre of the
accumulator steam piston into the interior of the ram casting,
the joint between this pipe and the steam piston being made

by a long self-adjusting sleeve. The steam supply to the pressure pump is taken from the interior
of the accumulator steam cylinder, through the holes in the regulating pipe, thence through
the steam cylinder head to the pump, the holes in the regulating pipe being distributed spirally
throughout its length.
The position of the accumulator steam piston, which depends on the amount of water stored in
the ram cylinder, governs the number of holes in the regulating pipe which opens into the interior
of the steam cylinder, and so controls the amount of steam supplied and hence the speed of the
pump. In service, as the ram cylinder fills, the speed of the pump decreases until just before the
steam piston reaches the head of the accumulator cylinder, all the holes in the regulating pipe are
shut off by the sleeve in the steam piston, thus stopping the pump. As the water is drawn off from
the ram cylinder, the number of holes uncovered in the regulating pipe gradually increases until
enough are open to drive the pump at its full speed. By this arrangement, variations in the speed
of the pump are gradual, which is essential to the quiet operation of a heavy pressure pump on a
varying consumption of water.
Worthington steam pumps and accumulators have been extensively used on the cruisers and
battleships of the United States Government for general hydraulic service and for working the
gun carriages and turrets.


Arrangement of Pipe Connections.
Showing Side View of Pump.


Arrangement of Pipe Connections.
The cut on the opposite page is presented for the purpose of showing those not fully acquainted
with the subject, a good arrangement of pipe connections, together with the attachment of
Strainer-Box and Strainer, and Check and Foot Valves, described on pages 142 and 143.
On the suction pipe C is a foot valve D , which keeps the pipes and cylinders charged with
water, so that the pump, when being started, does not have to free itself and the suction pipe of
air. This valve is always essential on an unusually long suction pipe, or where the suction lift is
severe. In such cases the vacuum chamber F should also be added. It is readily made by
extending the suction pipe upward, using a tee instead of the elbow E, and putting a cap
on the top.
The arrangement of strainer-box and strainer, shown at A, is described on page 143.
A check valve should be placed upon the delivery pipe to keep back the water when the pump
is opened for examination or repairs.
A “waste delivery” or “starting pipe” that can be led into any convenient place of overflow
should be provided, so that the pump at starting can free itself of air, while the pressure is kept
from it by the check valve. When the pump has properly started, the valve in the “waste
delivery” should be closed.
The “ charging pipe ” /, connecting the delivery pipe beyond the check valve with the suction
chamber of the pump, is for the purpose of charging the cylinders and suction pipe, before starting,
with water from the delivery pipe, in case they have been purposely emptied or the water has
leaked out through the foot valve.
The suction or supply opening is on the end of the pump at the flange B.
If any difficulty is experienced in making a pump work properly when first started, it will
generally be found to proceed from imperfect connections, or from the temporary stiffness to be
expected in a new machine.
Unless the suction lift and length of supply pipe are moderate, a foot valve, a charging
connection and a vacuum chamber are very desirable, if not absolutely necessary. The supply pipe
must, of course, be entirely free from air leakage.
If oftens happens that a pump refuses to lift water while the full pressure against which it is
expected to work is resting upon the force valves, for the reason that the air within the pump
chamber is not dislodged, but only compressed, by the motion of the plunger. It is well, therefore,
to arrange for running without pressure until the air is expelled, and water follows. This is done
by placing a check valve in the delivery pipe, and providing a waste delivery to be closed after the
pump has caught water. Such a valve is also required for keeping back the pressure when the
pump is opened for examination of the valves.


Worthington Steam Pump.
Sectional View
Showing Method of Setting Steam Valves.


We are frequently asked how to set
the Steam Valves of a Worthington
Pump.
For those not conversant with the usual technical terms, the following directions will be of
assistance:
The steam valve of a Worthington pump has no outside lap, consequently, when in its central
position, it just covers the steam ports leading to opposite ends of cylinder.
By lost motion is meant the distance a valve rod travels before moving the valve; or, if the
steam chest cover is off, the amount of lost motion is shown by the distance the valve can be
moved back and forth before coming in contact with the valve rod nut.
To set the piston in the middle of its stroke, open the drip cocks and move piston by prying on
the cross-head (not on lever), until it comes in contact with the cylinder head ; make a mark on
piston rod at face of steam end stuffing box follower; move piston back to contact stroke at opposite
end. Make second mark on piston rod half-way between first mark and the aforesaid follower
Then if piston is again moved until second mark coincides with the face of same follower, it will be
exactly in the middle of its stroke.
Bear in mind that the piston on one side moves the valve on opposite side.
To Set the Valves.
{a) When the steam valve is moved by a single valve rod nut.
Place one piston in the middle of its stroke; disconnect link from head of valve rod on
opposite side. 'I hen set the valve in its central position ; place valve nut evenly between jaws on
back of valve, screw valve rod in or out until eye on valve rod head comes in iine with eye of valve
rod link; then re-connect. Repeat the operation on opposite side, and the valves will be
properly set.
(l>) When the valve rod has more than the lock nut.
Place one piston in the middle of its stroke and the opposite slide valve in central position ;
adjust lock nuts so as to allow about ij inch lost motion on each side of jaw, and valve is set. Do
not disconnect the valve motion. Repeat operation on other side.
The best way to divide the lost motion equally is to move the valve each way until it strikes
the nut or nuts, and see if the port openings are equal.
It is advisable to place both pistons at the middle of their strokes before touching either slide
valve.
Too much lost motion will tend to lengthen the stroke, and may cause the piston to strike the
cylinder heads ; vice versa, when there is not enough lost motion the stroke will be perceptibly
shortened.
N.B.—All pumps before leaving tbe Hydraulic Works bave tbe valves properly
set, and are in perfect running order. Unsatisfactory operation is generally to be
attributed to poor packing or faulty connections.

Worthington Water Works Pumping Engines.


Worthington Water Works Pumping
Engines.
The Worthington Pumping Engine in its earliest form was first applied to water works
service for the city of Savannah, Ga., in the year 1854. Six years later the improvement known
as the Duplex valve motion was invented, and from that time Worthington engines have been
so extensively introduced for the supply of water for cities and towns, that to-day there are more
of them in use than those of all other types combined.
Since the erection of the first Worthington engine, about 50 years ago, the demands of a most
varied and extended service have resulted in the perfecting of seveti distinct types of the
machine, each possessing distinctive features and improvements adapted to its class of work. In
small water works, where the power and capacity are moderate, and where economy in fuel con-
sumption is of little consequence, the pumps for general service, illustrated on pages 26 and 27,
are found to be appropriate and satisfactory. When, as the magnitude and importance of the
plants are somewhat increased, attention begins to be attracted to the question of more economi-
cal operation, a pump better adapted for the service would be the Compound class, illustrated on
pages 28 and 29. A still higher and more important class of station would call for the Com-
pound Condensing Engine. The latter type has been most extensively used, and through a range
of capacity extending from 2,000,000 up to 30,000,000 of gallons daily.
As the demand for even greater economy in fuel was made manifest, the Worthington Engine,
keeping abreast of the times, developed into the Triple Expansion, the High Duty Compound,
High Duty High Ratio Compound, and the High Duty Triple'Expansion forms. These latter
embody all the refinements and improvements found in the latest and most advanced practice in
steam and Hydraulic engineering.
In the. past 45 years upwards of 2,000 Worthington Pumping Engines of record have been
built and furnished to water works in all parts of the world. Up to January 1902, the aggregate
daily capacity of all the Worthington pumping engines in water works service was over
6,784,000,000 gallons.
The illustration upon the opposite page represents the Worthington High Duty Triple Ex-
pansion Pumping Engine. This engine is extensively used in the leading pumping stations
throughout the world, where the high cost of fuel necessitates the employment of an engine of
the highest economy, combined with simplicity of construction, absolute reliability, and safety.
It also possesses the advantage of requiring very little space and, inexpensive foundations.
Estimates will be furnished upon application for Pumping Engines of any type and
capacity for water works, sewage, irrigation, etc.


Worthington Meter
For Measuring Water, Beer, Oil and other Fluids.


Worthington Meters.
Water Meters may be divided into two classes :
First —The positive.
Second—The inferential.
To the first class belong all forms of piston meters, whether reciprocating or rotary. To the
second, disc, rotating vane, propeller wheels and similar devices, depending on the current for their
movement. The distinctive difference between the two classes lies in the fact that the piston
meter measures the fluid by means of chambers alternately filled and emptied, and is, therefore,
positive in its reading, regardless of the passing fluid, while the rotating vane type must of
necessity be affected to a more or less extent by the velocity of the water and the frictional
resistance of the moving parts.
The Worthington Meter is of the reciprocating piston type, and has made a record which has
earned for it the reputation “ unequalled for accuracy and durability.” The general design is
somewhat similar to that of the well-known duplex pump, consisting of two reciprocating
plungers working in parallel rings. The water is admitted and discharged through the ports
in the base of the meter. The chambers at either end of the plungers are alternately
placed in communication with the inlet and discharge openings through the medium of gmall
D valves, which valves are actuated by the plungers in their backward and forward movements.
One of the plungers imparts a reciprocating motion to the lever near the top of the main
casting, which in turn operates the counter movement through the spindle and ratchet gear
Thus the counter is arranged to move the dial pointers once for every four strokes or
displacements, and the water cannot pass through the meter without registration, for in
order to pass through it must be displaced by the plungers and, therefore, recorded by
the movement of the lever and counter mechanism ; nor can there be an over registration, because
the plungers cannot move unless the fluid is displaced.
The counter usually registers in Imperial Gallons.
This Meter is particularly adapted to water-works service. The body, bottom, cap and heads
are constructed of the best quality of cast iron. The plungers, plunger rings, slide valves, and
seats are made of a special, brass composition, as are also the lever, spindle, spindle stuffing box,
and ratchet movement. The counter is designed and constructed with special care, with a. view to
having it as perfect as possible in all its details. No rubber or fibre parts are used ; therefore, the
meter is not affected by hot water, a feature appreciated by all water companies.
For pressures exceeding ioolbs. per square inch, a special heavy pressure pattern meter is
supplied.

Worthington Hot Water Meters.
tor the continuous measuring of water at temperatures above 120° Fahrenheit, special
Hot Water Meters are furnished. These meters differ from the General Service in that all of the
working parts, together with the bodies, are made of brass, and special adjustable buffers are
provided to assist in calibrating. When tested and adjusted to meet the conditions under which
they will be required to work, the meters will give results of the most satisfactory character.
On expert trials of steam engines and boilers, where it is necessary to obtain with great
accuracy the rate of evaporation, the Worthington Hot Water Meter will be found indispensable
many expert and consulting engineers regarding it as a necessary part of their outfit. For test
purposes, special bye-pass pipes can be supplied, so arranged that the meter can be thrown in or
out of service with the least possible delay. These pipes also permit of testing the meter without
removing it from the main feed line.
A special folder descriptive of the Worthington Hot Water Meter will be forwarded on
application.

Bye-pass for Hot Water or Test Meters.
The above illustration shows the most convenient and approved method of connecting Test Meters.
Worthington Test Meter.
Every engineer who has had control of a boiler plant has felt the necessity of having some
simple device by which the amount of water fed to the boilers could be accurately determined.
With such an appliance at hand, it becomes an easy matter to test the value of various coals, and
to determine which of several is the most economical. A careful manager naturally endeavours
to make comparisons of this character, but finds himself frequently confused by conflicting
results, arising from the supposition that his shop or factory consumes the same quantity of power
at all times.
The Worthington Test Meter meets all these requirements. There is no arrangement of feed-
water piping, pumps, heaters, filters, or other apparatus, to which it cannot be applied with but
trifling outlay. It can be used without interfering with the operation and usual conditions of the
plant, for long or short periods, as may be desired, or it can be thrown out of commission
entirely.
Owing to the errors introduced by dealing with very hot water under high pressure, the
amount registered by the meter may not be exactly the same as that passing through the meter;
but the difference between the two is always constant, and, when determined and applied to the
counter-reading, the actual amount passing through the meter will be given. It must be borne in
mind, however, that the error of the Worthington Test Meter is a very small percentage, and it is
only in cases where great accuracy is desired that the counter-reading cannot be taken as final
The conditions being the same as those under which the test is to take place, the correction is
readily found by setting the three-way cocks so as to pass the water through the meter. The read-
ing of the counter, together with the temperature of the water, furnishes (by consulting a table) the
weight of the water passing through the meter in any given time. The three-way cocks are then
turned so as to cut off the meter, and allow the water to flow by way of the angle valve and empty
for precisely the same time into a cask or tank placed on a scale ; the angle valve first having been
closed until the pressure shown by the gauge is the same as when the water is passing through the
meter. The relation between the weight of the metered amount and that found by actual
measurement gives, in a percentage plus or minus, the correction to be applied to the counter-
reading. In this way it is possible to test the meter as frequently as may be desired. Further by
properly setting the cocks, and breaking the couplings, the meter may be removed without inter-
rupting the flow of water to the boiler, or hindering in anyway the operation of the plant. If
desired, we will furnish at moderate cost the necessary fittings, as illustrated above, viz.: —
2 Three-way Cocks,
i 6in. Pressure Gauge,
i Thermometer,
1 Brass Angle Valve,
2 Brass Meter Couplings,
2 Brass Pipe Couplings,
Necessary Iron Pipe.
The Worthington Test Meter is suitable for a pressure of 200 lbs. per square inch, and a
temperature of 250 degrees Fahr.
Upon application, further particulars, together with sizes and prices, will gladly be given.
Test Meters for special service, when the temperature and pressure are exceptionally high, can
alto be furnished. In such cases, conditions should be clearly stated when asking for quotations.


Worthington Oil Meters.
For measuring crude oil, petroleum and naphtha from and into tanks, and for recording the
amount of oil used in connection with oil burning apparatus, Oil Meters are furnished. They
are fitted with special attachments, and the counters are usually arranged to read in Imperial
gallons. For use in gasworks, the Oil Meters are sometimes fitted, at an additional cost, with
large vertical dials, which can be readily observed by the gas maker from his position at the valves
and in this manner the speed at which the oil is being passed can be noted. The dials have two
hands, one showing units and the other tens, and they are arranged so that they can be set back
to zero at any time without interfering with the progressive registration. The Oil Meters are
furnished with vent pipes in place of the vent screws shown on page 158. The vent pipes are fitted
with air cocks at the top, which should be opened at intervals when the meters are working on such
fluids as naphtha, benzine, kerosene, &c., to relieve any gas which may be collected in the meter
and vent pipes.

Worthington Disc Meters.
The Worthington Disc Meter has been designed to meet the growing demand for a meter
which would combine the minimum weight consistent with reliability on constant service an
accuracy of registration. As the total weight of the %in. size is only eight and one-hair poun s
and as exhaustive tests show a most remarkable accuracy, both of these reauxrements have Deen
Vhis meter represents the most advanced practice in the disc type, eliminating the weaknesses
which have been encountered in the past in other similar meters. It is simple in construction, . e
workmanship and finish are of the highest grade, and all parts are made to gauge an
interchangeable. A water balanced disc is employed, thereby reducing wear to a minimum.
This balance is so perfect that practically no resistance is offered to the flow of water, there Deing
no appreciable loss of pressure at full speed. , . , ■ .
The meter is constructed throughout of the best bronze composition, except the bottom P. ja
which may be of iron or bronze as preferred. The counters are made either of the straignt
reading or of the standard seven circle type, and read in gallons, litres, &c., as may be specmea. as
shown in the cut, these meters are made with the inlet and outlet spuds cast on and fitted witn
male thread ; connections are furnished when desired. An interior strainer is a part ol the regular
construction. . , , . r j
Duplicate parts are always carried in stock, rind repairs may be made in a few moments ana
at trifling cost. „ T ,
We are always ready to furnish sample meters to Water Works Companies for trial.

In estimating the capacity of Worthington Pumps (i.e., the delivery in Gallons per minute or
per hour) at a given rate of Piston speed, it should be noted that the Worthington Pump has two
double-acting water plungers; its capacity, therefore, is double that of any ordinary double-
acting Pump of the same size, or four times as large as a single-acting pump.


Fire Streams.
Pressure required at nozzle and at pump, with quantity and pressure necessary to throw good
effective streams various distances through different size nozzles, using 100 feet of ordinary 2 y, inch
rubber lined hose and smooth nozzles.

N.B —The'above pressures are based on the supposition that the hose is coupled direct to the
delivery of the pump and while the stream is flowing; if, however, the hose is coupled to a hydrant
which is supplied direct from the pump, then the corresponding fire pump pressure must be
greater than the hydrant pressure by an amount equal to friction loss, and difference of head
between hydrant and pump.
The pressures given are indicated pressures, not effective pressures. Effective pressures would
be slightly greater.
The distances given are for effective fire streams adapted for fire purposes, and are not for mere
isolated drops.

The Worthington Hydraulic Works, established in 1843
have from the first been devoted solely to the manu-
facture of Pumping Machinery, and are the largest
as well as the oldest works in the world exclusively
engaged in this branch of engineering. At the pre-
sent time over
175,000 Pumps
have been built at these works, which are at pre-
sent capable of turning out annually about
18,000 Pumps.
