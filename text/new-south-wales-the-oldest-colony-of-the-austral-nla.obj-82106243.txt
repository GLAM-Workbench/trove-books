NEW SOUTH WALES.
ITS PROGRESS DURING TEN YEARS,
FROM 1862 TO 1871.
The publication of the Statistics of New South Wales
for the year 1871 ?lately laid before Parliament offers an
interesting - subject of inquiry With regard to the progress
and resources of the colony. The report of the Registrar-
General, which accompanies the volume, conveys a very
clear and well arranged analysis of the tables as they
relate to the year under review, but, very naturally, extends
no further. I propose, therefore, to embrace in this review
a wider range of observation, and to take stock of the
resources and progress of the country during the last ten
years ?comparing the five years from 1862 to 1866 with
the five years from 1867 to 1871. It is by comparison
that we arrive at an accurate knowledge of the rate of
progress we have attained, and are able to discover where
we have receded?if at all?and where we have stood
still, and where we have advanced. The period is free
from the embarrassment which met the statistician in the
early period of the colony?s history. I mean with regard
to the loss of territory through dismemberment. In 1851,
Port Philip was separated from us ; and at the end of 1859
the Moreton Bay districts were taken from us. In 1862' we
had well nigh recovered, and, in some respects, more than
recovered, the losses inflicted by the deprivation of so large
a slice of our territory as that which now forms the thriving
colony of Queensland. Indeed, it may at this time be said


chat the loss has, by the enterprise of the people and by the
fillip given to the development of the country through its
establishment under a separate Government, been converted
into a clear gain, through the growth of a vigorous enter-
prising community, carrying on friendly and profitable
relations with us. Statistical results are valuable for the
right comprehension of the principles which should guide
the proceedings of Government, and I am sure I need not
at this time, and before this society, attempt to indicate the
important bearing which statistical investigation has upon
legislation. Empirical treatment of subjects, without know-
ledge derived from facts must be as dangerous in its effects
upon the body politic as upon the human frame, for it has
no guide but opinions, the truth or fallacy of which be
they rational or be they visionary?is equally unsusceptible
of proof from scientific data. Hypothesis and conjecture
may be necessary in the pursuit of any investigation, but it
is by the results of observations, carefully recorded, that
Governments should be guided in their endeavours to pro-
mote the welfare of the people whose interests are confided
to their care. I will, then, under the belief that these
premises will be freely admitted, proceed to point attention
to the facts recorded in the volume before me ; and I am
happy to bear testimony to the care and industry manifested
by the compiler, in the collection as well as in the prepara-
tion of the figures set forth for our information. lam not
going to weary you with long columns of figures in pur-
suing the investigation of the facts as 1 find them recorded ;
I purpose for perspicuity and simplicity?s sake, to take the
averages of the quinquennial periods, and to exhibit the
results with as much conciseness as is compatible with a
clear elucidation of the facts to which I am about to invite


your attention. The subjects will be treated under five
principal heads, viz.:?l, Population; 2, Production; 3,
Manufactures; 4,Trade and Commerce; 5, Accumulation.
L?POPULATION
The number and increase of the people must always be
regarded as the most important element in the progress of
a country. Let us see then what information we can gather
on this head. The census taken on April 7, 1861, resulted
in a total population of 350,860 souls, of which $5 per cent,
were males, and 45 per cent, were females. The census
taken on April 2, 1871, resulted in a total population of
503,981 souls, comprising males and females in very nearly
the same proportion as ten years ago. The aggregate gain
to the country was 153,121 souls, equal to 43 per cent, in
the decennary. Of this number 108,972, or 31 per cent,
was the result of natural increase by the excess of births
over deaths ; whilst the balance, equal to 12 per cent., is
due to the excess of immigration over emigration. Teem-
ing with mineral wealth beyond calculation, abounding in
the richest pasturage, and possessing a soil which, properly
cultivated, yields to the occupier no stinted return for the
toil and labour he has bestowed upon it, we have much to
do in the way of wooing a population to assist in the
development of the boundless resources of this young
country When we consider the area comprised within its
limits, and know' that for each man, woman, and child in it
were it parcelled out amongst them ?over 400 acres of land
would fall to the lot of each ; and when we reflect on this
further fact, that without exceeding the density of the popu-
lation as it exists in the county of Cumberland ?exclusive of
Sydney?we have room for a population exceeding twenty


millions of souls, or forty times the number of its present
inhabitants?we cannot but hail with pleasure the prospect
which is opening- to us of a considerable accession to the
population, not only by reason of the attraction of our
mineral wealth, but by means of an assisted immigration,
the funds for which have made their appearance on the
Estimates fot 1873 for the first time for many years. The
statistics of this colony, as well as those of Victoria, amply
prove the fact that wag-es have declined with the stoppage
of immigration, and have never ruled so high as they have
reached in those years when immigration was at its full
swing. Of all causes which create national wealth, the
power of population is the most influential; hence the
interest which attaches to comprehensive and systematic
returns designed to illustrate the social progress of a nation,
amongst which a census of the people must ever be re-
garded as the truest index to its wealth ; and instead of the
repulsive dryness which thoughtless custom has ascribed to
statistics of this nature, they ought to have all the attrac-
tiveness of pictures of a people?s condition. For this reason
the tables that are now in process of compilation from the
facts elicited at the late census will, when published, be
replete with interest, and form the basis for administrative
and economical measures of the highest consequence to the
well-being of the community. A good deal of impatience
has manifested itself at what appears to unreflecting per-
sons the dilatoriness of the compilers; but anyone who has
had experience of the labour involved in reducing into
shape and order the mass of information contained in the
returns, will readily acknowledge the truth of the old
proverb ? more haste, worse speed,? and that it applies
with peculiar force to the elaborate details of a census.


lI.?PRODUCTION.
We must still under this head give precedence to our
pastoral industry, for the time has not yet arrived, although
it may not be far off, when our mineral resources may take
the first rank amongst the producing interests of the country.
The statistics show that we commenced the decennial
period with the following live stock, namely:?
Horses. Cattle Sheep.
273,389 2,620,383 6,145,651
and that we close the decennary with
304,100 2,014,888 16,278,697
that is to say, we have increased our horse-stock by over
30,000; we are poorer in horned cattle by over 60,0000,
and we have increased our sheep by over 10,000,000. This
is a striking result, and one which can hardly have been
anticipated, namely, that whilst we have increased our flocks
in the ten years 165 per cent., we have lost 23 per cent, of
our herds. Whether we owe this deficiency in our horned
cattle to the ravages of pleuro pneumonia, or to the in-
creased demand for beef by the meat-preserving establish-
ments, I know not ?partly, perhaps, to both. The result,
from whatever cause it arises, ought to stimulate our cattle-
breeders and farmers to greater care and greater exertion,
so as to keep pace with the increasing requirements of the
country. For every 100 of the" population, we have 400
head of cattle and 3,200 sheep, or, in other words, 4 head
of cattle and 32 sheep for every man, woman, and child in
the country. We need be under no apprehension of starv-
ing, from lack of butchers? meat; whilst at the same time it
is not very clear, from the returns of the last ten years


stood thus, viz,;?
Cattle.
Sheep.

195,213
(unless we can greatly extend our power of increase),
where the great surplus of capital is to come from that is
expected to feed the growing demand for our beef ?whether
salted, tinned, or frozen?in the mother-country. The
decrease in cattle occurred most noticeably in the years
1863 and 1864, and it would seem that the ill-effects of the
pleuro-pneumonia epidemic were felt up to the year 1869, for
it is not till that year the number of cattle in this colony
shows an upward tendency. Between 1862 and 1871
omitting the two years 1867 and 1868, in which no statistics
of the ?overland? traffic were taken?the exports and
imports of cattle and sheep across the border to Victoria
Net exports in the eight years 517,630 3,245,577
Wool.
The tables which exhibit the export of wool?the produce
of the colony?furnish the following information : ?They
show us that in the year 1862 our flocks produced
20,988,393 lbs, of wool, of the estimated value of ï¿½ 1,801,186,
which gives an average of over three pounds six ounces per
sheep, and an estimated value of nearly one shilling and
ninepence per pound. In 1866 the production had increased
to 36,980,685 pounds of wool, with an estimated value of
ï¿½2,830,348, or a little over one shilling and sixpence per
pound; thus exhibiting an increase in the production to the
extent of 76 per cent. Whilst in the last five years of the
series?that is in the year 1871 ?the exports reached the


highest figures ever sent away, namely, 65,611,953 pounds
of wool, and the estimated value of ï¿½4,748,160, or a little
over one shilling and fivepence per pound. Not far short of
five millions sterling, and equal to an increase of production
of 212 per cent, in the ten years, and nearly 80 per cent, in
the last five years. The clip of 1871 gave an average yield
of 4 lbs. per sheep, that is ten ounces over the clip of 1862,
owing probably in great measure to the larger proportion
of wool going home in grease. We have no means of
ascertaining the actual return proceeds of the clip of last
year; indeed, it cannot yet have been all realised. I shall
not be accused of overstating the case, however, if I put
down the surplus return to the colony, over and above the
value before stated, at a million and a half sterling, thus
bringing up the value of the clip to six millions and a
quarter sterling. It is a noticeable feature in the returns of
the exports of wool, the produce of our own flocks, that over
41 per cent, goes to Melbourne or Adelaide for shipment, a
fact which suggests considerations beyond the scope of this
paper to discuss.
Tallow, etc.
As appertaining to the pastoral interests, the sketch would
be incomplete without a notice of the value of live-stock,
tallow, hides, sheepskins, and tinned meats, but I will treat
them in the aggregate for fear of wearying you, having
much ground yet to go over. Of course we have no means
of ascertaining the value of the home consumption, we must
therefore be.content to estimate the production by the value
of the exports as expressed in the returns before us. I


find, then, that we exported seaward last year, the produce
of our own flocks and herds, to the value of ?
Live-stock &4M3 0
Salt and preserved meats 133,266
Hides and skins 48,283
Tallow 246,727
Total ï¿½468,606
Thus bringing- up the value of our pastoral produce? to a
sum approaching seven millions sterling. Comparing this
result with a similar investigation presented by me to the
Philosophical Society just six years ago, it would appear
that, altogether, irrespective of the late rise in the value of
wool, the income from our pastoral industry has very nearly
doubled itself in the last six years?the pastoral exports in
1865 being then estimated at not more than .ï¿½3,298,402.
But these figures, I see, include the value of the live-stock
wool, and tallow, exported ? overland.? I must, therefore,
to make the comparison complete, look up the value of
the pastoral produce so exported last year. I find it is as
follows, viz.:?
Live Stock ï¿½9 1 4)^93
Tallow, skins, &c 23,594
Wool 2,443,380
Total ï¿½3,381,867
If we add this to the amount previously estimated we shall
arrive at an aggregate sum exceeding eight millions and a
half sterling, as the total estimated value of *our pastoral
exports for the year 1871, viz.:
Wool, seaward ï¿½4748,160
Tallow, &c., ditto ? 468,606
Wool, live-stock, tallow, &c., overland 3,381,867
Grand total ï¿½8,598,633


Agriculture.
In order to illustrate more clearly the progress we have
made in this important branch of industry, it will be advisable
to divide the decennary into two equal periods, and average
the results of each. We shall thus arrive at a more accu-
rate knowledge of the progress we have made than if we
were to take the results of single years. The comparison
then comes out as follows, viz.:?Average five years, 1862
to 1866: wheat, 124,666 acres; maize, 101,225 acres;
other crops, 125,614 acres; total, 351,505 acres. Average
five years, 1868 to 1872: wheat, 160,965 acres; maize,
118,301 acres; other crops, 155,738 acres; total, 435,004
acres.* We find, then, from these figures? 1, that the
average acreage under.wheat has increased by 36,299
acres, nearly 30 per cent.; 2, that the average acreage
under maize has increased by 17,076 acres, or nearly 17
percent.; 3, that the average acreage under ?all other
crops,?f has increased by 30,124 acres, or 24 per cent.;
4, and that the total acreage under cultivation has increased
in the last five years by 83,499 acres, equal to 24 per cent.
I am not quite sure whether this rate of progress will satisfy
the ardent aspirations of those who looked by means of a
liberal land policy to attract industry to the soil; but I
cannot think they ought to be discouraged in the face of the
results elicited by the late census, and just brought under
your notice, namely, that the total increase of the population
in the ten years has been only 43 per cent But I will
follow up this inquiry a little further with the view of show-
ing that exclusive of the pastoral tenants, the number of
occupiers of land has increased from 19,361 in 1864 (the

first year in which the statistics were collected) to 29*174
in 1872 ?rather over 50 per cent. Comparing this with
the rate of increase of the population, it must be admitted
that the occupation of the land has commanded a fair share
of attention. But before I leave the subject of agriculture
for other industries waiting our attention, I must proceed to
notice shortly the results of the wheat tillage. Pursuing
the comparison in the same way that I have treated the
extent of land under crop, I find that the average yield of
the quinquennial period was 1,270,044 bushels, or barely
ten bushels to the acre, at Bs. per bushel in Sydney (which
the statistics tell us was the average price during that
period) we obtain a result of ï¿½508,017, or at the rate of
ï¿½4 per acre. The average of the second quinquennial
period produced 1,930217 bushels, or 12 bushels per acre,
which at 6s. per bushel?a little over the average price as
given in the tables?will yield a gross return of ï¿½579 a6 5
or at the rate of ï¿½3 12s. per acre. I am not prepared to
say whether this rate of remuneration compensates the
farmer for his outlay, toil and trouble, in New South Wales;
but we know that the farmers of South Australia are per-
fectly content to sell their wheat on the ground at 3 s - 6d.
per bushel, and that the average yield per acre does not
exceed our own; and, moreover, that wheat and flour con-
stitute one of their principal articles of export, whilst with
us the average produce is barely sufficient for the supply of
one-half the population -the average of the first five-years
being about bushels per head, and the average of the
last five years being about 4 bushels per head. The average
allowance per head of the population, including wheat for
seed, is estimated at bushels. The value of the imports
of wheat and flour, deducting exports, has averaged no less
than ï¿½472,560. Whilst of grain of all kinds used for food,


wheat and flour inclusive, the balance of imports over ex-
ports has exceeded half a million sterling? per annum
(ï¿½538,005) during - the ten years under review. Amongst
the exports of grain last year it is satisfactory to notice
741,567 bushels of maize, valued at ï¿½109,412, being - at the
rate of a trifle under 3s. per bushel. This is one of the most
certain and prolific crops we have?maintaining a steady
average yield of 30 bushels per acre, and its value will be
the more appreciated when I tell you that irrespective of
home consumption we have exported, on the average, an-
nually, 783,617 bushels of the aggregate value of ï¿½ 1,175,426,
or at the rate of ï¿½i 17,542 per annum*
Sugab.
On March 31, 1864, the statistics for the first time afford
evidence of the aptitude of parts of this colony for the growth
of the sugar-cane. We find in that year the modest attempt
of two acres, with a produce alongside it of 280 pounds of
sugar. From this small beginning we trace a rapid in-
crease, which at the beginning of this year had attained
dimensions of considerable importance; for we find that no
less than 4,393 acres were under cultivation, of which 1,994-
acres were productive, and yielded 1,241 tons of sugar, ex-
clusive of the produce of 748 acres in the Clarence district,
which at the time of taking the returns could not be ascer-
tained, but which, if we estimated it at the average of the
remainder, will bring up the yield to as near as possible a
ton to the acre. The establishment of this industry is per-
haps one of the most important features in the history of the
period we are recording, and I am afraid that the returns of
* Is it not strange that a cereal so wholesome, and which forms so
large a portion of the food of the people in the United States and
Canada, should be viewed with repugnance as an article of food by our
own people ?


last year do not do it justice; for I find on looking- up the
figures again that the yield of sugar in 1869 and 1870, with
a much smaller extent of land under crop, was 3,048 tons
against 2,667* tons in the two succeeding years. In the four
years 1869 to 1872 the value of the sugar produced has
exceeded ï¿½150,000.
Wine.
The notice of our agricultural produce would not be com-
plete if I omitted to draw attention to the increase of the vine
culture. There is no industry in which we have made
greater advance, whether we regard it in quantity or qua-
lity. From 1,459 acres under crO P in 1863, we haV6 ad "
vanced to 4,152 acres in 1872, or 185 per cent, in the ten
years. And in the production of wine the returns show an
increase from 144,888 gallons in 1863, to gallons m
1872, exhibiting an equal rate of production with the acre-
age in crop. What value this produce may represent I
know not. The restrictive fiscal policy of our neighbours
has hitherto prevented its attaining any commercial value,
for I can find no notice of it in the Decennial Tables of ex-
ports, and in the Customs returns for 1871, only a few
samples, amounting to 1,679 gallons in all were exported, to
which no specific value is attached. That the time, however,
will come when the mother-country will as readily avail
herself of our wines as she is anxious to take our meat, no
one will, I think, be prepared to dispute. But I must pass on
to the next subject, only stopping to make the remark, that
it is impossible to reduce the produce of our husbandry, as
we can our wool and gold, to any arithmetical nicety of
calculation as to value. It may make no great show in the
list of our exports, but it gives occupation and support to

nearly 5,000 of our people; and, although I have given
agriculture the second place in this paper, I would not be so
rash as to place the husbandman in the second rank
amongst the wealth-makers of the colony. Heavy losses
and sore discouragements are his lot. Alternations of
drought, of frost, of rust and blight, of grub and caterpillar,
are amongst the difficulties he has to contend with, and in a
degree that is felt by no other producing class amongst us.
Gold-
The statistics of our gold-mines for the ten years ending
December 31, 1871, exhibit for the first nine years of the
series a gradual diminution in production. Commencing
with a value of ï¿½2,212,534 i n 1862, the production declined
till it reached in 1870 the lowest point recorded since the
first discovery of gold in 1851, namely, ï¿½763,655. In the
year 1871, however, there are indications of a recovery,
which during the present year have more than realised the
most sanguine expectations of the mining population. The
production last year mounted again to ï¿½1,143,781, making
up the total value produced in the decennary to ï¿½11,591,742
?the first five years averaging ï¿½1,411,786, the second five
years averaging only ï¿½906,561. The industry during the
first five years gave employment to about 20,000 of our
people, and during the second g five years to about 15,000 on
the average. The value of the gold produced in the colony
and exported from 1851 to 1861 inclusive was ï¿½13,596,686.
To what proportions the energy and the enterprise that are
now being directed to the development of this branch of
industry may cause the production to attain, is a question
beyond the power of human foresight to conjecture, I must
leave it to others to discuss this problem, and pass on to the


consideration of a branch of industry more certain in its
results, viz.:?
Coal.
We are here without a rival, and may calculate with
certainty on a production, limited only by the demand, for
ages to come. Whilst gold confounds all the theories of
geologists and defies their conclusions, the existence and ex-
tent of our coal formations is a matter of as much certainty
to the experienced eye of the geologist as if it lay on the
surface. And now that the miners and their masters seem
to have arrived at a better understanding, and to perceive
that it is to the interest of both to work in harmony, we may
confidently hope that the production may attain proportions
which will place this industry in the first rank amongst the
products of the country. In spite of the many drawbacks
which have attended the pursuit, it is satisfactory to notice
that whilst the average produce of the five years, 1862 to
1866, was 563,835 tons of coal annually, and an average
value of ï¿½281,998, or equal to not far short of a million and
a half, on the whole, the produce of the five years, 1867 to
1871, reached a yearly average of 882,272 tons, of the
value of ï¿½347,957? or nearly a million and three-quarters on
the whole. The value of the coal in the first period is esti-
mated at 1 os. per ton, and in the second period at barely Bs,
per ton. Had the value remained the same, the produce of
the latter quinquennial period would have realised ï¿½2,205,681
or nearly three-quarters of a million in excess of the earlier
period. The great development of our coal-mining indus-
try will be seen in the comparison of the last with the pre-
ceding ten years:?

These industries, although promising great results in the
future, have not yet attained a development that swells up
to any material extent the resources of the colony. I find
that the extent of the production in 1871 was?
3 .?MANUFACTURES.
Under this branch of industry, we have no great progress
to boast of. The most noticeable feature in the returns is
the establishment within the last two years of fifty-seven
mills for the manufacture of sugar from the cane, grown on
the northern rivers. In the manufacture of woollen cloth
there has been an increase of five to seven establishments
only in the ten years, turning out on the average for the last
five years, 218,276 yards of cloth per annum, against
120,719 yards the previous five years. In tobacco, soap and
candles, tallow and lard, refined sugar, and distilled spirits
?which constitute the only remaining specimens of manu-
facturing industry exhibited in the tables?there is nothing
to notice that would justify my detaining you. I shall there-
fore pass on to the consideration of the statistics of our
4.?TRADE AND COMMERCE.
In attempting to illustrate the growth of our commerce it
will be well to examine the returns of imports and exports
? seaward ? in the first place, leaving what is called the
? overland ? trade for after consideration. Following this
plan, I find that in the ten years, 1862 to 1871 inclusive, we
imported seaward, goods to the value of ï¿½84,832,363, and we

of the average population. The value of the imports into
Great Britain during the same period was at the rate of
ï¿½9 ss., and of exports at'the rate of ï¿½5 16s. per head of the
population. I have looked through the statistics of the Board
of Trade for the last ten years, and I cannot find amongst
all the dependencies of the British Crown?British India ex-
cepted?any trade that approaches in value to that of ?Aus-
tralia.? The colonies are not separately specified in the re-
turns, but as it may be interesting to show what rank the
Australian colonies take amongst ? the British Possessions ?
in their trade with the mother country, I will take leave to
quote the following figures from the Statistical Abstract

The imports from Australia were 22 per cent, of the
whole, and the exports of Australia were 19 per cent, of the
whole. You will, perhaps, excuse this digression. It
occurred to me that the information might be interesting to
many who have never realised the important commercial
position Her Majesty?s Australian possessions occupy?second
only to British India with its teeming millions of inhabit-
ants?and far in advance of the North American Colonies
with a population three times that of the Australias. But to
return to our own statistics, it should be notified that our
trade with Great Britain constitutes no preponderating share
of the whole, for I find that in the ten years we imported
from Great Britain to the value of ï¿½32,575,549 ; Australian
and other colonies, ï¿½37,926,609; foreign countries,
ï¿½ i 4,330j i 4S > that is to say, from Great Britain, 40 per
cent.; other colonies, 42 per cent.; foreign countries 17 per
cent. ; as also in exports during the same period, we ex-
ported to Great Britain to the value of ï¿½30,208,485 ; Austra-
lian and other colonies, ï¿½41,467,718 ; and foreign countries,
ï¿½2,472,673* that is to say, at the rate of 41 per cent., 56 per
cent., and 3 per cent, respectively. The importance of our
intercolonial trade is here very remarkably exemplified, for
we see by these figures that as regards ? imports ? it con-


stitutes nearly one half, and as regards ?exports? more
than one half of the entire commerce of the country. It may
be interesting here to notice the extent to which the export
trade is indebted to the produce and manufactures of the
country, because the prosperity of the colony may be judged
by the productions over and above its own wants of articles,
the result of its own people?s industry. Well, in this point of
view, we may derive satisfaction from the returns; for I find
that of the exports valued at ï¿½74,148,876, for the ten years
no less than ï¿½52,043,742 represent the produce and manu-
factures of New South Wales, exhibiting an annual average
of over five millions sterling, and at the rate of ï¿½l2 3s. 6d,
per head of the population. It has already been shown that
the exports of Great Britain for the same period were at the
rate of ï¿½5 16s. per head of the population. Relatively,
therefore, the wealth of this community has been increasing
in a ratio more than double that of the mother-country.
There may, perhaps, be two reasons assigned for this; the
one refers to the great natural resources of the country,
which yield their riches with comparatively small assistance
from man. The other refers to what I conceive to be the
more effective condition of population. If the productive
class bears a larger proportion to the unproductive in one
country than in another, the power of creating wealth will
be by so much increased. I have reason to believe that
when the ? census ? of Great Britain in 1871 is compared
with that of New South Wales, it will be found that the
population, ineffective by reason of age, bears a higher
ratio to the aggregate numbers in Great Britain than it does
in New South Wales. I have not the statistics before me to
enable me to verify this opinion at the present time, but I
remember making a comparison (in preparing my report
on the census of 1856) and I there found, that by the census


of 1851, the population of Great Britain between the ages
of ten and seventy ?extreme limits?showed no less than 57
per cent, outside those limits. That is to say, that 57 per
cent, were dependent for food, education, and support, upon
the remaining 43 per cent.; whilst, in New South Wales
between the ages of 10 and 60,* there were 69 per cent,
effective to 31 per cent, ineffective. By the census of 1856,
I find that, taking the boys and girls under 14 years, and
the people above 60 years, the proportions were: ?Between
14 and *3O, 59 - 67 per cent., leaving 40'33 per cent, unpro-
ductive = 100. The late census, I believe, exhibits a pro-
portion of 58 per cent, between the ages of 14 and 65, which
perhaps fairly represents the present working population
leaving 24 per cent, unproductive. I merely, in passing,
throw out these suggestions for your consideration as they
occur to me, in some measure to account for the larger
producing power of the Australian colonies as compared
with England. We will now proceed to analyse a little
more closely the Customs returns, and compare the two
quinquennial periods embraced in the decennary under
review. And first as to ? Imports.? It appears that between
1862 and 1866, we imported articles to the value of
ï¿½46,285,929, yielding an annual average of .ï¿½9,257,185 ;
whilst between 1867 and 1871 we imported to the value of
only ï¿½38,546,434, yielding an annual average of ï¿½7,709,286
showing a decrease of over a million and a half yearly, and
it appears that this decrease was not in the intercolonial
trade, but in the trade with the mother-country; for whilst
the colonial trade sustains a slightly increased average?
that is from ï¿½3,777,341 to ï¿½3,806,792, the average imports
from Great Britain fell from ï¿½4,182,809 to ï¿½2,972,300, or
a decrease of 29 percent. We may, I think, trace here the
The classification did not distinguish the ages over 60.


effect of the low value at home of our staple product, wool,
and perhaps to some extent, the languishing state of the
gold-mining interest during the latter period. And may we
not also attribute the decrease to a forced economy in the
use of luxuries, which comparatively straitened circumstances
taught us to observe. Let us now see how the matter stands
as to ? Exports the total value for the first five years was
.ï¿½38,860,002, equal to an annual average of ,ï¿½7,772,000;
and for the second five years .ï¿½35,288,874, or an average of
ï¿½7,057,775, an annual decrease of not much short of three-
quarters of a million ? Now here the picture is reversed ;
the decrease is not in the exports to Great Britain, but in
the Colonial trade, for whilst the annual average to Great
Britain increased from ï¿½2,694,495 in the first period to
ï¿½3,347,201, or 24 per cent, in the second period, the value
of the intercolonial exports decreased from an average of
ï¿½4,860,199, to 3,433,344, or 30 per cent. This falling off
is apparent in the figures which represent the value of the
exports to each of the Australian colonies, but appears more
particularly manifest in the trade with Queensland, which
dropped from the annual average of ï¿½ 1,173,558 during the
first five years, to ï¿½798,668, or 32 per cent during the last.
And this is a very natural result, not only of the increased
facilities for direct trade with the mother-country but also
perhaps of her people having freed themselves from the
galling yoke of their former pecuniary dependence upon the
mercantile and banking institutions of the parent colony.
There is still the overland traffic with the adjoining colonies
to be noticed. I do not intend to enter into an elaborate
analysis of the figures presented under this head. The time
at my disposal will not admit of it, and I do not wish to
trespass on your attention at greater length than I can help.
I will take the statistics of two years only, namely, 1861 and


1871, and compare them, that you may see the vast increase
of the overland trade in the ten years I find that the value
of the imports across the Border and up the Darling - , in
1861, was under ï¿½200,000, and the exports under ï¿½900.000,
whilst in 1871 we imported from

results, namely:?

Before passing on to the last subject of our inquiry, I
should like to draw a comparison between the decade.we
have been reviewing and that which preceded it, for they
must present to the minds of colonists of a quarter of a cen-
tury?s standing features differing very widely in their outlines.
In the earlier decade we embrace that period of intense
excitement, great speculation, and remarkable development
which followed the discovery of gold. In the second de-
cade we trace in the first half of it symptoms of depression
naturally following a period of over-trading and general
extravagance in which confidence in the permanent stability
and elasticity of our resources was well-nigh destroyed. In
the second half of the latter decade we may discover clear
evidence of recovery through the exercise of vigilant economy,
as exemplified in reduced imports, and through the
vigorous efforts made by the producing interests to lessen the
cost, to improve the quality, and to increase the quantity of
our marketable productions, as in the face of almost over-
whelming discouragement, is exemplified in the increased
exports to the mother-country. Depression follows excite-
ment as naturally in the body social as in the body physical,
and it is somewhat remarkable that they seem to occupy
pretty equal periods in the history of this country. Let us
inquire then how the matter stands between the decade of
? excitement,? and the decade of ? depression.? The de-
cade of ? excitement ? shows an aggregate import trade to
the value of


The decade of ? depression? shows an
a ï¿½'g? re g?ate import trade of the value of
ï¿½84,832,363
And an aggregate export trade of
74,148,876
Together
ï¿½158,981,239
And this is without taking into account the ? overland ?
traffic, which, we have seen, exceeded last year four millions
sterling. I was hardly prepared to expect that the in-
vestigation would bring out such a result as an excess of
over fifty-eight millions sterling as compared with the great
gold-producing era. The increase in the producing power
of population is here remarkably brought out; for whilst
the actual increase of population was only 46 per cent., the
increase of trade and production was nearly 58 per cent.
Surely, then, such facts as these ought for ever to dispel
the silly fears which have led to such disastrous results in
the cases of many of our most valuable colonists, whose in-
terests have been sacrificed to ignorance or timidity; and
they ought to establish a well-founded and enduring confi-
dence both here and at home in the strength and elasticity
of our resources, and in the power of production of our
people.
S.?ACCUMULATION.
The coin and bullion in the Sydney branch of the Royal
Mint, in the Colonial Treasury, and in the banks of the
colony, on December 31, 1871, amounted to 2'522,387,being
an increase of 74 per cent, on the amount on the same day
of the previous year. A comparison between the first and
second five years of the decade shows an average of
ï¿½1,278,151 for the first period, ï¿½1,904,855 for the second,
t.e? an increase of nearly 50 per cent. But it is to the
amount on deposit in the several banking institutions that
we must look for evidence of the accumulated wealth of the


people, I find, then, that at the end of 1871, the sworn
returns of the banks showed that they held?
On deposit no less than ï¿½7,043,885
N. S. W. Savings Banks 931,688
Post Office ditto 14,226
Together ï¿½7,989,799
This was at the rate of ï¿½l5 17s. id. per head of the popu
lation. And it seems to have been in excess of the deposits
at (he end of the previous year by nearly a million sterling.
Dividing the decennary into two equal parts, it will be found
(hat the average annual deposits in the banks during the
earlier five years were ï¿½5,713,974, and in the latter five
years ï¿½6,490,091, showing an increase of between 13 and
14 per cent. The discounts at the several banks on De-
cember 3 1 last represented an aggregate value of ï¿½7,668,022
and if we add to this the mortgages on land and on live-
stock and liens on crops, we shall arrive approximately
at the indebtedness of the producing interests at the end of
last year. We will tabulate them as follows, viz.;?
Banks and discounts ï¿½7,668,022
Mortgages on land 697,440
Ditto on live-stock 703,333
Liens on wool 451,926
Ditto on crops 13,170
Total ï¿½9^33*891
From this sum I suppose it is fair to deduct the ? dis-
charges ? during the year; they were as follows, viz.:?
Mortgages on land ï¿½318,168
Conveyances under ditto 148,340
Mortgages on live stock 333 5 36
Total ï¿½800,044
This leaves a net liability, secured on the lands, houses,


live-stock, and crops of the country to the extent of
ï¿½8>733>&47- The net liability under the same heads ten
years before was ï¿½6,906,066. The increase of liabilities,
therefore, is only ï¿½1,827,781, or at the rate of 26 per cent,
which, compared with the vast increase in the material
wealth of the country, as evidenced by the results of this
investigation, ought to inspire us with confidence in the per-
manent stability and elasticity of our resources, and should I
not add, with shame and confusion, for our late shortcomings
in this behalf. Gentlemen, I shall carry this inquiry no
further at this time. I have taken you over a large field of
observation, but we have only been able to dig up the sur-
face, and must leave a large field of investigation unex-
plored. My remarks have been confined to the illustration
of the material advancement of the colony. There is the
question as to the social, moral, and educational progress
left untouched. The Registrar-General will have the
opportunity of enlightening us upon this question through his
shortly expected report on the census of 1871. The figures
which I have been endeavouring to explain to you this
evening represent the workings of a society that cannot yet
boast of a century?s existence. On Jan. 26, 1788, Governor
Philip first moored his boat and hoisted the British flag
almost on the spot where we are now assembled. The first
thirty years of the colony?s history is wrapped in a good
deal of traditionary darkness, and few people care to lift the
veil. It is well, perhaps, that it should so be left. In 1821,
the light of statistics began to dawn on her history. New
South Wales then numbered 29,783 souls, and enjoyed a
revenue of ï¿½36,231. In ten years from that date she had
increased her population to 51,155 souls, her revenue to
ï¿½ 121,066 and her import and export trade reached ï¿½81 4,320.
in 1841 she had increased her population to 149,669 souls,

1815, after the dismemberment of the Southern districts, she
had increased her population to 197,168, but her revenue
and her trade suffered by the loss. Her revenue was
ï¿½406,056, and her trade ï¿½3,360,843. In the next decade
after the dismemberment of her northern territory she in-
creased her population to 358,278 souls, her revenue to
ï¿½1,448,613, and her trade to ï¿½11,986,394 ; whilst in 1871
she had increased her population to 519,182 souls, her
revenue to ï¿½2,727,404, and her trade to ï¿½20,854,540. The
wealth-producing- power of population is, I think, fully ex-
emplified in these figures; for we shall see that, excepting
the one period marked by the dismemberment of Port Philip,
as the population increased so did the power of production,
and in an increased ratio.
The import and export trade per head of the population
We appear now to be on the threshold of another epoch
of excitement and prosperity; and, whoever may live to see
the decade out, may have a marvellous story to tell of the
country?s progress, far outstripping that which I have been
able to show you to-night; and if, deriving wisdom from the
experience of the past, we direct our energies aright, and
endeavour to educate our youthful population up to the high
standard to which they should aspire, we may hope that,
with the increase of the wealth, we may at the same time be
promoting the happiness of the people, so that in the course
of time we may raise the national character to the standard
we should try to attain-that of a wise and an understanding
people.
