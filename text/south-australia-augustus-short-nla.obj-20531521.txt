50UTH AUSTRALIA
The Colony of South Australia, founded in the year 1836, has risen with unexampled
rapidity in numbers and importance. Its population is now believed to exceed 25,000; and from
the rich Mines of Copper and Lead, discovered in many parts of the Colony, an extraordinary
increase by immigration, both from Europe and the neighbouring Colonies, may be expected.
The concentration, however, of the population consequent upon Mining operations, while it calls
for the immediate supply of Religious Ordinances, affords, at the same time, the best hope of
their being effectually supplied. From the annexed tabular statement, it appears that two
additional Clergymen are required for North and South Adelaide, with their adjacent villages,
Thebarton, Hindmarsh, Walkerville, Goodwood, &c. Seven other localities (besides Port
Adelaide, Mount Barker, Gawler, which have resident Clergymen) are sufficiently peopled to
call for the residence, or missionary visits, of a Pastor.
An effort has been made in the Colony itself by the South Australian Church Society,
which has collected £3OO in the past year, and it is hoped that by regular contributions from
every individual belonging to our Church, a considerable yearly income may be realised. Sub-
scriptions also to the amount of £1,650 have been made since 1844, towards liquidating the debt on
Trinity Church. But until local resources can be fully and systematically developed, the presence
and labours of more Clergy are needed in order to stimulate exertion; and for their temporary
I<-:i• r • ■ i
support, the aid of the Mother Country is required. It must be remembered that Clergy,
Churches, School-houses, Parsonages, Glebes, are all needed; and it can hardly be expected
that, amid the struggles of a young Colony, such objects can adequately be provided
out of the limited capital of the industrious Emigrant. It is during the trying period of his
first establishment, that he requires, and it is hoped will not ask in vain for, the support of his
fellow Christians and fellow Churchmen; members of the same body, and heirs of the same
immortal hopes with himself. Those who possess land, or other property in the Colony, or
whose relatives are settled there, will, it is believed, feel it to be their especial privilege and
duty to contribute according to their ability, for the furtherance of this holy cause. An income
of £lOO per annum, together with an allowance of £l2O for Outfit and Passage, is the lowest
remuneration which can be justly offered to any Minister of the Gospel, who is willing to give
himself to the Lord’s service in the Colonial Churches. By the blessing of God it is hoped that
many will be found to go forth and labour in the Vineyard, content with the simple measure of
food and raiment which will thus be supplied.

EXISTING CHURCH ESTABLISHMENT
Besides the above districts, the Special Surveys of the Burra Burra, Mount Barker, Reedy Creek
and Mount Remarkable, are presumed to have from 200 to 300 people at each, and the number is very
rapidly increasing. At the Kapunda, Victoria, Montacute Mines, also, a number of workpeople must be
congregated ; and the total of such mining labourers with their families cannot, it is thought be less
than 4,000 souls. ° ’
