■ ‘‘all the thrones are clouded with OUR LOSS.”


GOD, our help in ages past,
" Our hope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
Anri our eternal home ;
[Sf. Ann.
Beneath the shadow of Thy Throne
Thy saints have dwelt secure ;
Sufficient is Thine Arm alone,
And our defence is sure.
Before the hills in order stood,
Or eartl^received her frame,
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the Same.
A thousand ages in Thy sight
Are like an evening gone ;
Short as the watch that ends the night
Before the rising sun.
Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
Bears all its sons away ;
They fly forgotten as a dream
Dies at the opening day.
0 God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Be Thou our guard while troubles last,
And our eternal home.
Amen.
]V| Y God, my Father, while I stray [Troyte.
■I*! Far from my home on life’s rough way,
0 teach me from my heart to say,
“ Thy Will be done.”
Though dark my path, and sad my lot,
Let me he still and murmur not.
Or breathe the prayer divinely taught,
“ Thy Will be done.”
What though in lonely grief I sigh
For friends beloved no longer nigh,
Submissive would I still reply,
“Thy Will be done.”
HYMNS
If Thou shouldst call me to resign
What most I prize, it ne’er was mine ;
I only yield Thee what is Thine ;
“ Thy Will be done.”
Let but my fainting heart be blest
With Thy sweet Spirit for its guest,
My God, to Thee T leave the rest ;
“ Thy Will be done.”
Renew my will from day to day.
Blend it with Thine, and take away
All that now makes it hard to say,
“ Thy Will be done.” Amen.
Sankey.
SAFE in the arms of Jesus,
Safe on His gentle breast,
There by His love o’ershaded,
Sweetly my soul shall rest.
Hark ! ’tis the voice of angels
Borne in a song to me,
Over the fields of g’ory,
Over the Jasper sea.
ROCK of ages, cleft for me, [“ Redhead.”
Let me hide myself in Thee ;
Let the Water and the Blood,
From Th3 r riven Ride which flow’d,
Be of sin the double cure,
Cleanse me from its guilt and power.
Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy Cross I cling ;
Naked, come to Thee for dress ;
Helpless, look to Thee for grace ;
Foul, I to the Fountain fly ;
Wash me, Saviour, or I die.
While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyelids close in death.
When I soar through tracts unknown.
See Thee on Thy Judgment Throne ;
Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee. Amen.
[Pilgrim.
4 4 COR ever with the Lord ! ”
■ Amen ; so let it he ;
Life from the dead is in that word,
’Tis immortality.
Here in the body pent,
Absent from Him I roam,
Yet nightly pitch my moving tent
A day’s march nearer home.
My Father’s house on high,
Home of my soul, how near
At times to faith’s foreseeing eye
Thy golden gates appear !
Ah ! then my spirit faints
To reach the land I love,
The bright inheritance of Saints,
Jerusalem above.
“ For ever with the Lord,”
Father, if ’tis Thy Will,
The promise of that faithful word
Even here to me fulfil.
Be Thou at my right hand
Then can I never fail;
Uphold Thou me, and I shall stand,
Fight, and I must prevail.
So when my latest breath
Shall rend the veil in twain,
By death I shall escape from death,
And life eternal gain.
Knowing as I am known,
How shall I love that word,
And oft repeat before the Throne,
“ For ever with the Lord ! ”
Amen.
_ . . .. , . Jesus, my heart’s dear Refuge,
Safe in the arms of Jesus, Jesus has died for me ;
Safe from corroding care Firm on the Rook of Ages
Safe from the world s temptations Ever my trust sha ]i ( )e .
Sin cannot harm me there, Here let me wait with patience,
Free from the Wight of sorrow, Wait tjn the ni „ ht is o>er 0 > er -
Free from my doubts and fears; Waifc ti „ l see the morning
Only a few more trials, Break on the golden shore.
Only a few more tears 1 Amen.
