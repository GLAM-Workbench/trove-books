IN MEMORIAL!
William Atkinson Gardner, J.P., Member of the
Legislative Council for the County of Cornwall', died
at Newnham, June 21s/, 1855, in the fortieth year of
his age.
The sudden death of this lamented gentleman has
deprived the community of one ever anxious to assist in
every good and benevolent object. His charity was
unbounded, and many will deplore the loss of one, who
relieved them in distress as much by his kindly
thoughtfulness and sympathy, as by his ready and open
generosity.
Possessing a cultivated and elegant mind, this small
volume of his Poems attests at once, his literary tastes
and his benevolent character. To his friends it will
possess a melancholy interest, his last days having been
spent in correcting the proof sheets, and he closed his
work, while lying on that bed of sickness from which he
never rose.

PREFACE.
Thf.se rythms are not on martial subjects,
and have nothing more to do with the war
individually, than the lightest fancies which
adorn the Bazaar-stalls of benevolent ladies.
But as paper is made from rags, it is hoped
that the produce of these papers may he
issued forth in lint to the wounded of the
Crimea.
Newsham, May 1855.




My fancy wanders gladly,
O’er day and moments past;
As mcm’ry whispers sadly,
They were too sweet to last.
I think on those distant waters,
On that blue and foaming deep ;
And on those clustered islands,
Which tranquil and beauteous sleep.
And I think on happy moments,
And those sweet half-waking dreams ;
When the moonlight through the clusters
Of the wild vine sweetly gleams.
When the rays of the setting sun
Throw a halo o’er the wave,
And the splash of the breaking water,
Sounds loud in the echoing cave:
I.


And I think of one lovely evening.
At the close of a joyous day,
When together with friends beloved.
We plied our homeward way.
And the voice of the loved one softly toned.
So gentle and so still.
Like o’er its dark and stormy bed.
Murmurs the mountain rill.
And though no word was spoke of love,
There was that in that voice’s tone.
Which spoke to my beating heart—
As that voice could speak alone.
I thought net, then, on the fair sea nymph.
With her pearl-shell plaited tress ;
Or the mermaid sporting wildly.
In her sea-weed woven dress.
And if from the bottom of the deep,
Had sprang the enchantress's lay,
I should not like the CEncid chief have calk’d.
For the cord and the hempen stay.


For to me one look of kindness.
From those eyes I loved so well;
Was dearer, far, than the countless wealth.
Of the ocean’s treasure cell.
The memory of those happy hours,
Shall ne’er forgotten he.
As long as those mountains dark o’erhang.
That deep unfathomed sea.
And if the dead, the memory hold.
Of bright hours passed below ;
I’d think of those moments sweet, nor wish,
A purer bliss to know.
Madeira, 1836.


II.
THE COMPLAINT.
A FRAGMENT.
1.
I would not, if I could, forget
The blow which almost rived my heart;
For sure the tie was more than sweet.
Which pained me so when forced to part.
And yet, from stage to stage to travel.
To trace the increase of one’s love;
Draws tighter yet that clueless ravel,
Which love about the heart-strings wove.
To dwell on smile, and mein, and motion,
To count the bliss of those sweet hours ;
When all absorbed by fond devotion.
Heaven seemed to hallow love like ours.


From the first hour when love dictated,
The words the tongue scarce dared ex-
press ;
To those sweet moments, when unsated.
The lips ne’er opened save to bless.
Say, while o’er such a picture leaning,
Dreaming of ought save care or pain ;
Oh! can one understand the meaning,
Of “ parting ne’er to meet again.”
I cannot, dare not, try to tell,
How first those words rang on mine car;
But in my heart, remembered well.
Still echo faint, those sounds of fear.
2.
Still every day my mem’ry hies,
Back to those days of faultless pleasure;
And once again I seem to prize,
As if my own, that long lost treasure.
I tell the reasons w T hy I loved.
And where my love at first begun ;
And what it was my heart first moved.
To risk its peace on that fair one.


And then my fancy takes me quite.
And Reason sleeps when Fancy wakes;
I know again that fond delight.
Which all too soon my heart forsakes.
Not yet, not yet, that fiendish mutter !
I feel again those arms entwine ;
I hear again that dear voice utter,
" In joy or sorrow I am thine."
But then ! as starting from a trance,
In which for aye I would have lain ;
A vision scowls on me askance.
And mutters “ ne’er to meet again."
3.
I never to a friend could say.
We part to meet again “no more"—
E’en though I know his distant way.
May lead to many a fatal shore.
For though we know that all things here,
Each day but near a certain end ;
One charm remains, our heart to cheer,
A seeming confidence to lend.


Some peace still o’er our anguish reigns—
Some joy survives till this be fled ;
We live so long as Hope remains—
We die when all our Hopes are dead.
4.
It is not, that we, face to face,
Again together ne’er may meet
It is not, that nor time nor place
May see us more, each other greet.
It is the distance of the heart—
It is the absence of the will,
Which makes us as for ever part.
And face to face yet severs still.
Had but the heart remained united, —
Were but the will as once unchanged.
All common hindrance had been slighted.
For ne’er had fear the heart estranged.
And e’en had fate ordained that never,
Our hopes should here fulfilment find ;
Fate hath no power, the heart to sever,
Doom holds no thraldom o’er the mind.
18.°,8.


III.
THE ABJURATION
The freshness of my heart is seared
Its strings vibrate an altered tone :
Each echo of what once endeared,
Serves but to prove its music gone.
E’en were there one, who should combine,
Nature’s each grace w'ithout her stain';
And though such charms could all be mine,
I would not—could not—love again.
For me from beauty’s perfect mould,
Have fall’n such tears as lovers shed ;
Like streams which flow from mines of gold,
The wealth betraying whence they sped:
And oft when beauty’s cheek was wet,
I’ve bid bright smiles resume their reign;
Those tears and smiles I must forget.
E’er I can ever love again.


Oh ! tell mo not, that he whose heart,
Hath given its faith —its all away,
Can let those inem’ries depart.
Which once were thought its only stay;
Nor bid my wounded pride awake :
Ye do but rend my heart in vain—
Till every hope, my heart forsake,
I can not —will not—love again.
Nor bid me think that other charms,
Can wale my heart from cherished woe;
To risk again those fond alarms,
Which only anxious lovers know.
Oh ! tempt me not, to break my vow r ;
My very self I should disdain,
And e’en the falsest charge allow',
If I could pledge my heart again.
1838,


IV.
LINES ON SPRING.
Blest o’er all seasons is the spring ;
Now nature seems once more to live r
The birds a warbling welcome bring,
All things harmonious echo give.
No more we fear the chilling blast—
No more shall icy bond enslave ;
Spring comes, and as to hide the past,
Conceals ’neath flowers old winter’s grave.
The child may well in spring rejoice,
Free now amidst the fields to stray ;
The small birds answering to his voice,—
The little lambs his mates at play.
Now whilst again the butterfly,
Flutters before his anxious hand ;
His smile reflects the sunny sky,—
His heart, the newly flowering land.


And most the charms of spring engage,
The heart with boyhood buoyant still;
Like in the presence of stern age,
He cowered beneath the winter's chill:
Now whilst with opened chest he stands.
To breathe (he genial, perfumed wind ;
He feels his strength, his heart expands.
And generous thoughts suffuse his mind.
What longings wake in maiden’s breast.
She culls the flowers with careless hand;
Subdued .she feels, and half oppressed.
By joys she scarce can understand :
As when the lover owns his love,
And in his arms her fears take wing ;
Her heart what new emotions move.
Herself meet emblem of the spring.
And he whose heart, by grace subdued,
Owns over all a sovereign will;
Feels in the spring, his faith renewed.
And sees that God is gracious still.
To him the flowers, that now begin.
Their heads above the sod to raise,
Presage a bright eternal spring.
And fill his heart with grateful praise.
B


He who but lately saw the sky,
With winter’s deepest shade o’erspread ;
Might well forget that spring was nigh.
And dream that nature’s self was dead ;
And thus the heart which deemed it’s heaven,
With sunless skies for aye o’ercast.
May see in spring, a token given.
That sorrow cannot ever last.
Alike the serious and the gay,—
Alike the youthful and the old ;
Welcome the sun’s returning ray,
And joy that nature’s charms unfold.
Then whilst we sun us in the beam,
We’ll sing the opening charms of spring;
Though incommensurate may seem.
The measured numbers which we bring.
Is it that scarce our lips dare tell ?
Each new emotion which we feel:
Is it that we would rather dwell P
All silent than each hope reveal.
Oh yes, alas ! the blooming bowers,
By springs sweet influence revived;
Too oft remind us of the flowers,
Which not the winter’s cold survived.
1839.


V.
TO A FLIRT.
Stella so innocent and gay,
Smiles on each lover’s feigned sorrow;
One thinks himself most blest to-day,
Another still more blest to-morrow.
Each in their turn her favours share,
But each too soon their worth despises ;
For love will bear with no compeer,
To share with it the thing it prizes.
Oh, Stella ! would thine ear incline.
To words of well-intentioned warning ;
For sure a form so fair as thine,
Should lack no grace thy sex adorning.
That warning voice, would tell bow vain.
Is shortlived joy which ends in sorrow;
How valueless the art to gain,
The smile to-day, the tear to-morrow.


Would tell thee that the enchantress oft,
A victim to her spells may fall;
The heart may weave midst dalliance soft,
A chain to hold itself in thrall.
The speckled snake, whose fangs are drawn.
May dread the infant's playful grasp;
The rose without her guardian thorn,
May perish in the wanton clasp.
Thy charms will prove a source of pain,
Should’st thou from wisdom’s pathway
swerve;
And brightest wit thy greatest bane.
Uncheck’d by maidenly reserve.
1839.


VI.
THE THREE CLASSIFICATIONS OF
HESIOD.
He, who right on of his own might,
In wisdom’s track hath pressed ;
And neither looked to left nor right.
He is of men “ the best.”
And he who of himself distrust—
Is not too proud to learn ;
And seeks the councils of the just.
The “ second rank” may earn.
Should one from wisdom’s call have shrank,
Though void of innate grace;
Him “ worthless” call, and he his rank,
The “ lowest of his race.”
a 3


VII.
TO MARIA.
Maria, if my untutored hand essay.
To tell my love to thee in simple verse ;
Not to vain flattery will I tune my lay,
Nor in vain words, thy cherished charms
rehearse.
I would but yield one sigh, but breathe one
prayer.
The simple tributes of an honest heart
Enough for me, if I can dry one tear.
Or one fond momentary joy impart.
I will not liken thee to fairest birds.
Though sweeter far to me, than nightin-
gale’s—
Thy voice at even, whispering gentle words;
For not as they, when past the winter
gales.


Thou will’st not Lie thee to another mate,
To list anew to novel tales of love.
No! true till death, the gentle hand of fate
Shall bear, still living on, thy soul above.
I will not liken thee unto a flower.
Oh! envy not the roses richest bloom;
Flowers do but brighten more the summer
hour,
To leave us cheerless in the hour of gloom.
Oh! ne’er be thine the flowers unlucky fate,
Pluck’d ruthlessly too oft by rudest hand;
But gentle angels thy last sigh await,
To bear thy spirit to a flowery land.
I can but offer thus a simple strain.
Our lot, alas! in different scales is cast;
And yet one thought of me, thou may’st
retain,
Till this life's struggle haply may be past.
And think of me, as one whose erring heart,
Thou all unworthy of a love like thine;
Still follows on, to seek that better part,
Where 'mid eternal flowers, no earthly
thorns entwine.
1838.


VIII.
LINES.
She spake no word, she breath’d no sigh,
Of which the vulgar world might speak ;
Hut her lofty soul, and purpose high,
Scarce hid a heart nigh fit to break.
No plaint she made, though the thorn was
there,
Which a reckless hand had dared to plant;
And her beauty gained a hue more fair, —
And her eye gleamed brighter than 'twas
wont.
Like the moon, beneath the dark green hill,
She sank all peacefully to rest;
For the light, she reflected, was shining still
Beyond, in the regions of the blest.


IX.
LINES TO M. C.
A lady said to me, one day,
Oil! sing a strain for me;
I quick replied,
“ Thy suit shall never be denied ;
But let me not in search of subject stray—
But he my song of thee, and only thee.”
But she returned—
“ Midst subjects pure and high,
“ A minstrel's theme should not be cir-
cumscribed ;
“ Sure in the realm of nature unde-
scribed ;
“ For which the poet’s rapture never burned,
‘* Lies many a gem in silence yet inurn’d,
“ More worthy of thy song than I.”


But as she spoke she smiled,
A smile which all she said, belied ;
I could but gaze, for to my heart there
went
Such thrill of pleasure: words could
give no vent,
Like man’s first tempter by a look beguil’d,
For such a smile content 1 could have
died.
“ Lady, I know a flower,
Which hides its beauty midst its verdant
leaves.
Like thy fair eyes a lustrous blue it
wears—
‘Forget me not,’ the cherished name
it bears;
The lover owns its unpretending power.
Its name the solace which its care re-
lieves.”
“ So if I choose a theme.
I’ll sing the flower which minds me most
of thee;
For shaded half'neath tresses long and
light.
Which know no touch of art all fair
and bright ;


Thy beauty most resembles it I deem,
Veiling itself in Nature’s panoply.”
“ What gift is half so meet,
As that which speaks the fond heart’s
every prayer ;
‘Forget me not,’ breathes every
lov’rs sigh.
Let me but live in thy fond memory ;
The trust in this can make e’en absence
sweet,
While mem’ry lives I’m with thee every
where.”
“ Lady ; —should worthy suitor woo thy
love.
And smiles from thee should be his bliss-
ful lot;
Oh, leave such flowers to wither where
they grow.
No mem’ry token need thy hand
bestow;
For he whom Fate ordains thy heart to
move.
Will read thy every glance ‘Forget
me not.’ ”
1837.


X.
Like as the mountain’s ice-clad brow,
Which owns no fellow, stands unmov’d ;
Whilst tides and seasons change below,
Is cold—the heart which never loved.
But colder yet than mountain’s brow,
Is the dark, deep, and silent grave ;
Where pride and beauty lie them low,
'Neath clammy clay, or deep blue wave,
Not otherwise the heart which gave.
It’s hope, its love, for nought away ;
No storm can reach that living grave,—
No sunlight shed illusive ray.
Reckless, unnerved, alone, unmoved—
Careless 'gainst deepening woes to war;
Though cold the heart which never loved,
Still colder that which loves no more.


XI.
THE REMEMBRANCE.
What though she never can be mine,
Still must I o’er her mem’ry yearn ;
And give around my heart to twine,
A love that seeks not for return.
What blissful longings filled my soul.
With raptures when her form I saw ;
How roamed my thoughts beyond control,
Mid fancies ne’er conceived before.
Yes, sure, my soul was borne away.
To sojourn in a brighter sphere ;
Hope lighted up a constant day,
And scared away the night of fear.
Hope was the sun that lit my bowers,
Thence alike the flowers my joy I drew ;
For colourless would be the flowers,
Where the sweet light could not shine
through.


No more that sun illumes the sky,
And hope no longer cheers my lot;
Then let me mourn and droop and die,
By her I love, despised, forgot.
The wanderer on Arabia’s strand,
Though trackless desert round him lies ;
Oft sees as if from out the sand,
Fair lakes and palaces arise.
Full well he knows he ne’er can gain,
Those scenes which live not through the
day;
Perchance they but increase his pain,
And yet he turns him not away.
I, like the traveller long to gaze,
On visions of illusive joys;
Which ever as their forms they raise,
A sad reality destroys.
My paradise the loving eye,
My living streams, affection’s tear;
My sun, a love that cannot die.
Fond words the music to mine ear.


His vision faded, how the dearth,
Must to the wanderer’s eye appear ;
How piteous the return to earth,
Of one who dream’t his heaven so near.
Though fairest charms on either hand.
Along ray weary pathway lie ;
Like exile in a foreign land,
I can no loveliness descry.
The Swiss, the sweetest tones will scorn,
By that which cheers his native hill;
But sweeter than the Alpine horn,
The voice, my heart hears echoing still.
1839.


XII.
I gained but one poor moment's gaze.
Into the joyous land of love;
Bewildered now in dreamy maze,
My fingers half unguided move.
I lack the power to sing or write,
My tongue but stammering utterance
yields ;
To tell of those sweet realms of light.
Loves mortal-trod Elysian fields.
But thou,who shared’st that moment’s glance,
Who stood’st and gazed that time with me;
Unravel my delicious tra nee.
And read my soul, ’tis ope’d to thee.
Thou can’st supply each wanting part,
Can’st fill each half unfinished line ;
Can’st read the longing of ray heart,
And show it, fair transcribed on thine.


XIII,
TO MARY H — .
] will not tell thee that I love,
Nof tempt thine ear with flattering speech ;
Fair words I trow, would worthless prove,
Thy love to gain, thy heart to reach.
1 would not that the courtiers art,
Should boast its skill o’er soul like thine ;
Nor that the homage of the heart,
Should need such guise from lips of mine.
I’d woo thee as at even tide,
The yephyrs woo the bursting flowers;
"Whilst round their cups they playful guide.
Then rustling sigh in neighb’ring bowers.
Those sighs the listening groves betray,
And whisper through the woodland vale ;
Say would the flowret turn away,
If she should hear the impassion’d tale,
c


I'd woo thee as the gentle dove.
With artless notes is fondly woo’d ;
Profaning not the thought of love.
But deep with tenderness embued.
Those wood notes I could seek to catch,
And innocent should be my lay ;
As that sweet bird’s, who joys to watch.
And tend his mate from spray to spray.
The flower its fragant cup may bend,
To list the wooing of the wind ;
The gentle dove her ear may lend,
And answer with a note as kind.
So may my guileless love be blessed.
My wooing call no frown from thee;
But wake within thy gentle breast,
A love as innocent and free.
Mona, 1839.


XIV.
TO MR. AND MRS. A — .
The thought of home—when at the garden
gate,
Earth’s parents saw the world before
their feet;
The home of each went with them, for the
fate,
O’erhanging both alike, they both might
meet.
In the wild solitude, oh ! not alone,
They walked; for faith and love, the
charms of home;
Without which home is not, these were not
gone,
But in their hearts went forth with them
the world to roam.
c 2


And ever in Earth’s pilgrimage, the heart,
Though yearning for admission to those
groves
From which the fiery sword it’s footsteps
part,
Has yet whereof to joy; for he who loves,
Whose heart bears with him what his father
brought
From Paradise, what Earth’s first mother
knew;
He, like our early parents instinct-taught,
Joys in the flowers of hope, the sky of
blue.
Yes, decked with flowers the path, and blue
the sky,
Of him whose heart has found a kindred
mate ;
One of God’s creatures, ever to be nigh,
To bear with him the stern decrees of
fate.
What matter where his weary path may
tend,
So long as from one home not called to
part
Whilst with him goes, his footsteps to attend
That cherished home his fond com-
panion’s heart.


For ye, whose kindness generously shown,
Has warmed the stranger’s heart, the
stranger’s prayer
Will aye ascend ; and not lor ye alone
But for your offspring too, that they may
share.
Heaven’s choicest blessings; and the kin-
dred thought
Of “ Home” on earth, and “ Home”
above the skies;
(If reason teach what instinct early taught),
May in the hearts of each, with joy spon-
taneous rise.
Isle of Man, 1812.

XV.
TWO SONNETS
TO A LADY ABROAD.
1.
The youth may tread on many a distant
shore,
’Neath many a foreign clime may gladly
roam;
Yet false his heart, who learns to long no
more
For that he left behind, his childhood’s
home
Yes, let him go where Heaven with profuse
hand
Hath sprinkled freely, nature’s every
charm ;
Where constant sunlight gilds a flowery
land, —
Where storms pervade not, and the skies
are calm:
No, though far brighter than his native
clime.
Though there the torrents roll, the tem-
pests lower.
Still o’er his heart fond memory holds her
powei’,
Sings in his car a never-ceasing chime ;
One power alone his heart away can bear,
’Tis woman’s smile, that smile is every
where.


2,
’Twas so with me, when first I learn’d to
roam,
Met me a kindly smile from one whose
birth,
Blessed not the land I fondly call ray home;
Yet that fair smile for me had equal
worth.
Lady, that smile was thine, thy friendly
hand,
Welcomed the wanderer in that distant
land.
And now again, though long, long years
have pass’d,
Thy smile recalls the time I saw thee
last;
Bids me to dwell on many a happy hour.
On kindly words, on many a kindly deed,
(F or aught I gave an undeserved meed),
Which thy good will was pleased on me to
shower;
Bids me forget my home, and learn to
bless,
In every clime, fair woman’s loveliness.
Leipzig, 1840.


XVI.
LES HORACES-DE RACINE.
[After seeing Mademoiselle Rachel.]
CAMILLE.
Hive me barbarian then a heart like thine,
Or would'st thou to my prayer an ear
incline,
Give me Curatios’ back, or me to grief
resign ;
His lot to me was happiness or woe,
Living I loved him—dead my tears shall
flow.
Seek not thy sister ! she, no more the same,
]3ut prides her in an injured loved one’s
name.
She like a fury now thy steps shall track,
Aye in thine ear thy crime shall echo back;
Tiger replete with blood! who bars the tear,
And with my lover’s death my heart would
cheer ;
Who boasting to the skies his valorous deed,
Would bid me cause my love again to bleed;
3Vlay every woe thy anxious life attend,
Till to a lot like mine thy hopes may tend ;
And some fell coward stroke be thine to sear
That fame to thy brutality so dear.
Farit, 183*5.


XVII.
YOUTH AND AGE.
Led by the light of childish faith.
Our infant footsteps careless stray ;
And follow on an aimless path,
Where’er another points the way :
A stormless sea—no rocks in view,
In gilded bark—with trusted crew.
But when the selfish will awakes,
Far brighter tracks the soul invite ;
Hope now the rein of conduct takes,
And turns our faces to the light;
The distant sky is ever clear,
Though heavy storm-clouds hover near,
Next love assumes the sole command,
And leads us with a flowery chain;
Now first we think we understand,
The definite joy we sought to gain ;
We love what to ourselves seems good.
And envy dies for want of food.


And if young love should prove at best,
A charm which scarce an hour endures ;
Yet friendship sure will stand the test,
For sympathy the most allures ;
And friendship seems the best to be,
When love breeds fear and jealousy.
Then is there not a constant light.
Which beams o’er childhood, manhood,
age,
Always a something fair and bright,
A breaking morn an opening page ;
Some joy which seems but first begun,—
Some chord which thrills in unison.
And shall we then our Maker blame,
Who placed us in a world like this ;
Lit in our hearts a generous flame.
And gave to each a share of bliss ;
And hope to point beyond the sky,
When love and friendship ne’er shall die.
1839.


XVIII.
TO AN IRISH LADY,
WITH A PORTRAIT OF O’CONNELL DURING HIS
CONFINEMENT.
For him the peasant’s prayer shall rise.
The Irish maid a teardrop shed ;
A prostrate nation’s tears and sighs,
Shall call down blessings on his head.
Low though the voice, and faint the prayer,
Which Ireland’s millions upraise ;
They shall be answer’d one day there.
Where Ireland’s prayers shall turn to
praise.
1811,


XIX.
TO MARGARET.
Tis long ago, and yet how fast.
The months and years have sped away;
Say dearest can we call “ the past”—
That whieh is “ present” every day.
We have it still, the present hour
Is but what every hour hath been;
The bloom is still upon the flower,
The bridal chaplet freshly green.
Yet look we back, for is there aught,
We would not wish to see again P
And think we back, for is there thought,
Which might recur to give us pain P
Say dearest, have we cause to blush
For mutual wrong or thought unkind ;
Or are there tears away to brush,
For sorrows treasur’d in the mind P


For had we grief, cur mutual (ears,
Straight from the cause our thoughts be-
guil'd ;
And all our separate cares and fears.
Were banish’d when the other smil’d ;
One word sufficed from me or thee,
The other’s fainting hopes to raise ;
And words of kindness aye must he,
Most welcome on the darkest days.
Tis long ago ; full many a year
Hath pass’d since first our fates wore one ;
And those are now no longer here.
Who bless’d us when onr course begun ;
And many a friend in death lies low,
Whose smile was cheeriest once of all!
But shall we wish it were not so,
Or long the sainted to recall P
No ! they arc gone, and we who stay,
Must turn us still to earthly things ;
And look that every coming day,
Some care or pleasure with it brings*
For aye our time is meted out
By little minutes, hours, and days,
And as we turn the year about,
Our thoughts and hopes go thousand ways.


How different is the land of peace,
Which strong in faith, we hope to gain \
That blessed land where joys increase,
Nor turn each instant into pain.
For here, what seems the brightest now,
To-morrow will have lost its bloom ;
And flowers to-day that flagrant blow,
Will lose to-morrow their perfume.
We hope in vain—a something new
May wake a longing in the breast;
But distant hills alone are blue,
And beauty fades when once possessed.
Like hope, the picture seen from far,
Shows scenes which fancy’s foot might
tread ;
Alas ! when we approach more near,
It is but canvass lightly spread.
Reality,—but wherefore chide,
Hope hath not cheated me in thee ;
Art thou not sitting at my side,
And all that I would have thee be.
Though otherwise than hope had told,
Reality has come to life ;
Did not the glitter prove of gold
The hour when first I call’d thee wife ?


My blessing on thee—thou art mine,
In heart and soul ray faithful wife ;
May Hymen’s flowery fetters twine,
As tightly round us all through life.
Nor think we two alone sustain,
The bond which all so lightly rests ;
For love is prisoner in the chain.
And flutters ever in our breasts,
1814.

FANCY, No. I.
A plop of irossy turf,
With flowers of early May;
A still deep stream, whose waters seem,
All loth to go their way.
A clacking mill ’neath yonder hill,
Half hid by leafy bowers ;
And Hakes of water from the rill,
Which melt in viewless showers.
And leaning ’gainst a wicker gate,
The genius of the glade ;
A village maid with air sedate.
Just half-way in the shade.


XXI.
FANCY, No. II.
I know a massive bridge,
With ivy overgrown;
Built like a pyramid, its ridge
High with rough chisell’d stone.
Beneath its gothic arch,
Pellucid waters flow;
The ancient oak and forest larch,
Bow to them as they go.
The pile frowns meaningly in shade.
As light they pass along;
Strongly contrasts its posture staid,
Such wishy-washy throng.
These go with ever changing mood,
Dancing, or now at rest
It stands, as it has ever stood,
In clasping ivy dress’d.


Can we decide the question—
Who can the sequel know
Jf first the bridge do crumble.
Or the brooklet cease to flow.


XXII.
THE EVENING WALK.
The air was soft, the sky was blue,
The face of heaven for once was bright;
The cobweb’s net had caught the dew.
And glisten’d gaily in the light.
Sparkling on every stem a pearl
Of heaven’s own weeping gently hung
Like joy’s own tear, which full and clear
Springs from the heart whose hopes are
young.
Not on the cobweb’s gauze above,
Not o ly on the flowret’s bell;
The light of heaven reflected shone
That evening when I mark’d it well.
It ting’d the cheek of such an one.
As oft we dream of, when at night
Visions arise, and happier skies
Seem opening to the strengthen’d sight.

We think of heaven with joy, because
We people it with spirits fair;
We think its laws are nature’s laws.
That forms like ours the angels wear.
We clothe the things we wot not of.
With indistinct and dreamy grace ;
And visions flit, by fancy lit
With fairy form and angel face.
Our thoughts of heaven—our hopes on earth
Are hut as one ; the finite view
Sees in its measurement of worth,
The mortal and the angel too.
Thrice blest is he, who meets below
One who reality, and dream.
May both supply, and ever nigh
Still as he gazes lovelier seem.
The air was soft, the sky was blue—
(My song is of a summer day) ;
The heaven-wept pearls, the sparkling dcw
Were brush’d by maiden’s foot away.
Nor did I mourn their fate, my heart
Forgot its fancies, and its beat,
With impulse new, and temper true.
Kept measure with that maiden’s feet.


She was a young and willful girl,
And as she tripp’d it cheerily.
The fairies round her every curl
Were gamboling right merrily.
Well skill’d in fairy lore, I heard
That ever as she onward mov’d,
Around her head, soft voices said,
She should be dearly, fondly lov’d.
I think the fairies knew that I
Could understand their tongue, for oft
As I look’d upward to the sky,
I heard a rustling aloft.
Scarce dare I seek their thoughts to clothe,
So pure they were, and innocent;
Cut all I heard, each tiniest word,
Fill’d up my heart with rare content.
They said or sung of life and love—
Of mutual joys and blissful hours ;
They seemed to link the world above.
So wondrously with this of ours.
They bid me know that heaven is found,
Where all else banished and forgot;
Love is the fare, which like the air
We live by though we see it not.
d 3


“ An essence 'tis, distilled” they said,
First from the blossoms of that tree,
’Neath which Eve’s earliest footsteps stay’d.
All ignorant what her lot might be :
Nor knowing aught, save that she lov’d
And was lov’d, so her first caress
"Was for that flow T er, which from that hour
Hath ever bloom’d, and bloomed to bless.
We fairies know it well, it grows
No more on earth, the scented bowers
"Where Eden’s sparkling river flows
Alone are blest with those rich flowers :
But when the golden sunlight dies,
And dews descend like silvery rain;
Its virtue pours, in magic showers,
And earth is Eden once again.”
The air was calm, the sky was blue,
(My song is of a summer eve) ;
Away the tiny fairies flew
And left me, oh! but not to grieve :
For first they said—“ It is the hour !”
Then circling once around the maid,
Who pensive led, away they sped,
And mingled with the copse’s shade.


Then thus I thought, if woman’s smile,
Fresh from the skies, taught love to be ;
How truly pure, how free from guile.
Is love’s ennobling sympathy.
Reflect from kindred spirits’ eye,
Yes, ’tis a light from other spheres;
Which fills the gaze, with dazzling rays,
And melts the soul to love and tears.
Tears from a virtuous maiden’s eyes,
Unworthy man who bids them flow ;
And yet when rising to the skies.
They tell the tale of love below.
For all our pleasures, all our hopes,
Are chronicled by these blight gems;
And each one shed, warm offered,
Is worth a hundred diadems.
The dew drop sparkling on the flower,
Is kissed by fondly wandering winds ;
The zephyr moodful as the hour,
For each fond clasp some flow’ret finds.
All down the glade, in sun or shade,
There’s nothing seeks to be alone ;
The rivulet, cannot forget
The water mingling with its own.


And the lighthearted one who bade,
He set to words the fairies lay ;
Not doom’d to bloom alone and fade,
Shall joy her of perpetual May.
She shall be kissed by fairy kiss.
Her lips shall taste love’s wondrous dew
Pure from the sky—when some one nigh.
Fresh from her lips shall taste it too.
Chasdey, 1844.

THE SEASONS.
The heart hy love enkindled,
In the first fond happy hours;
Joys of a glorious Spring-tide,
With its sunlight and new flowers.
The heart whose call is answer’d.
By an echo just and true;
Basks in the lime of Summer,
When the sky is ever blue.
The heart which rests contented,
With the loved one for its own;
Is rich as is the Autumn,
With its fruit and its flowers full blown.
But ah ! as 'neath the Winter,
Which follows the bright hours fled,
Is the heart which hath lost its vigour.
Whose hopes are with the dead.


But the winter of the heart,
Treads oft on the heels of spring ;
And the bird which hath sought a summer
home,
Must resume its weary wing.

TO CLARA PEARSON.
Dear little lady, bid my rhyme
Be all euphonious for thy sake ;
To keep my verse in tune and time.
For thee, no common care I’d take.
Oh ! may fond spirits hover o’er me.
Whilst all thy childish charms I trace;
Enough if they but hold before me
Thy modell’d form—thy angel face.
Dear Clara, artists who aspire,
To limn the watchers round the blest ;
Gather a smiling infant choir,
To lull their spirits into rest.
Already in my dreams I’ve seen,
Snch as I would should tend on me ;
But thou my waking dream hast been,
For I have seen their type in thee.


Clara, look up ! and from thy brow,
The lightly-hanging tresses toss ;
Witness thy bright eyes that e’en now,
Flit fancies fair thy mind across.
Is not the earth most fair, ray child,
A world of flowers in colours gay ;
See from each brow by thee beguil’d.
The shade of care hath pass’d away.
They could but smile to see thy face,
Illum’d with every first-born joy;
We know how young is every grace,
That Time was born but to destroy.
But Time hath had no time to take,
A single flow’ret from thy wreath ;
Clara! I would that I could make.
Thy charms immortal spite of death.
Then we should have a beauty rare,
Living amongst us ever new ;
Something to tell us what is fair.
To guide our thoughts to what is true ;
For art grows old-, and nature dies
Most mortal when its loss bereaves us
Of what is fairest in our eyes;-
And cherish’d closest when it leaves us.


But, Clara! 'tis too soon to fear,
That aught can steal thy charms away;
Like daylight growing aye more clear,
We see thy rise o’er life’s long day.
Bright is thy morning, may thy noon,
Be overshone by placid light;
And thine a summer sleep, which soon,
Shall wake to days which know not night.
1846.


XXV.
THE VENETIAN ON HORSEBACK.
Once on a time, on solid ground,
His half amphibious town forsaking ;
A young Venetian northward bound,
On saddleback his way was taking.
Beside him trugg’d his faithful squire
Pippo, who look’d upon a horse,
As something which should awe inspire,—
A hypogryff, or something worse.
At length, what with the heat and distance,
Pippo, whose strength began to fail,
As readiest way to gain assistance,
Applied him to the horse’s tail.
A beast ’neath such a load content.
To him the reasoning seem’d conclusive.
Could not consistently resent,
A contact so much less obtrusive.


Now, though the horse, by conduct steady,
Had seem’d to own the promise granted;
He did not show himself so ready,
To grant the sequel Pippo wanted :
And as no more impressive way.
For horse’s use was e'er invented—
By which to say, at once, “ nay—nay,”
A hearty kick show’d he dissented.
Reproof, we know, is seldom pleasant,
E’en though the gentlest hand may deal it;
But knock-down-method like the present,
How few but seriously would feel it;
And Pippo tumbling rowly-powly,
Stammer’d out words we dare not name;
Forgot, indeed, good manners wholly,—
A better man had done the same.
He rose, and as might be expected,
Sought straight to make the matter
square;
He seized a stone, and ill-directed,
He sent it whizzing through the air.
Revenge is blind, and now alack!
Behold, how once more Fortune trick'd
him,
The pebble caught his master’s back,
And left unscathed his destin’d victim.


Fearful he gain’d his master’s side,
Look’d piteously, and grumbled sore :
“ Oh! Pippo, oh !” his master cried—
“ Such beast was ne’er bestrode before;
The villain brute, no wise contented.
To leave you sprawling on the track ;
On me, alike, his rage he vented.
He kicked me just now on the back.”


XXVI.
A VALENTINE,
TO MY WIFE IN COBLENZ
We afe not parted, dearest wife,
Though face to face we may not be;
I lonely live but half a life,—
I live the other half with thee.
The chain of this material world
Is heavy on me here, and yet
Still am I free, to be with thee,
In thought and heart—dear Margaret.
At morning, when from sleep I rise,
I think that thou art waking too;
Though to new days, I ope mine eyes,
The days but not my thoughts are new.
With thee my hours begin and end,
The sun may rise, the sun may set;
Where’er my wand’ring footsteps tend,
I leave thee not—dear Margaret.
E


At night my lonely couch I seek,
To say—“oh, would that she were here;”
Fond word of wife, the love of life,
Springs from the things w r e hold most
dear.
And I love life, for much there is,
That I would never more forget;
And least that hour, when in thy flower,
I call’d thee “ wife”—dear Margaret.
Long years have pass’d, since that first day,
I clasp’d thee trembling to my breast;
Lift up thine eyes to mine, and say—
Hath not each after day been blest ?
The frown has lasted but an hour, —
The sun on wrath has never set;
The transient tear, but left more clear.
The minds’ right vision—Margaret.
And in thine hour of fear and pain,
Did’st not thou see the joys in store;
To know ourselves renew’d again,
Our hopes expanding more and more.
When two small eyes that look’d like mine.
The mother’s long faint gaze had met;
Say did’st thou mourn, the sorrows borne,
For both our sakes—dear Margaret.


Two little voices tuned to mine,
Shall bless thee for thy love and truth ;
A love like ours—a love like thine,
May glory in perpetual youth.
And as we journey to life’s end,
Whatever cares our way beset;
Love shall our onward course attend,
And gild our future—Margaret.
Shall it not be so ? though apart -
From all I hold most dear in life ;
Do I not know my second heart,
Beats in thy bosom, dearest wife ?
Thus am I selfish, for ray hopes,
In one dear setting all are set;
Clasp then thy heart, and ask what part,
Is not all mine—sweet Margaret.
And thus, not quite in idle rhyme,
I bring thee near to where I dwell;
And pass a pleasant hour of time,
Musing o’er joys remember’d well.
Not sever’d from thee till my heart,
Shall all thy charms, thy love forget;
And that shall be, when thou to me,
Art not my own —my Margaret.
London, Feb, 14.

XXVII.
TO JESSIE.
I love thee in thy every mood,
My eldest, dearest, choicest child ;
Deep in wise thought from legend caught,
Or frolic beckon’d running wild.
I love thee for I see thy heart,
Is featur'd on thine aspect mild ;
So wise, so gravely gay thou art,
And yet in every thing a child.
I see thee as on little feet,
(Eight moons had scarcely fill’d and
waned)
Running my fond embrace to meet
The garden wicket thou hadst gain’d,
Right proud to trot and cautious all.
The gaping iron grate to shun
Then crowing with a cheery call,
The guerdon kiss well earn’d and won.


Do I not mini the time when first,
Tutored to certain sound, thy voice
With words so few, but each day new,
Rejoicing, made the heart rejoice.
When echoes of each fond true word,
And nursery songs with oft refrain :
Returning from thy lips were heard,
And in slight music came again.
And later when with memory ripe,
The hist’ry of the small ‘ Bo Peep’;
Of shepherd boy with crook and pipe,
Of ‘ little boy blue’ all sound asleep.
Of ancient dame who lived in a shoe.
And of him who would not say his prayers;
Were told of, with an accent true.
And oft rehears’d upon the stairs.
But was it not a sad surprise
When once, to share mama’s kind love
Scarce welcome to thy wondering eyes,
A baby came from heaven above.
And nurse was running out of wits
Instead of singing songs to you;
And you felt lone, and half unknown,
And greater still the mystery grew,
£ 3


Until a precious baby girl,
Was shown thee with its placid eyes;
And dimpled fingers ; and the curl,
Of its light ringlets ; and the sighs.
Of its young breathing;—then we knew.
That one more friend to thee was given ;
To go beside thee this world through,
And grant it God with thee to Heaven.
One hour of sadness—then the light.
Of a new joy lit thy glad eyes
With promise of a new delight;—
Heavy and dark the raindrop lies
Dull on the flower like sorrow’s tear
Till the dark cloud is backward roll'd ;
But joy and light shall bid it wear,
The rainbow colors blue and gold.
Then, tenderest of nurses thou
With two years wisdom in thy head
Crow’d to the baby wakefull now.
And sleeping, trod with chariest tread.
And caught the earliest ray of light,
First twinkle of the opening dawn,
Which bade it wake from mental night
To hail the sparkles of the morn.


And now, outgrown thy baby-hood,
I watch thee play thy little part ;
And see how with unchanging mood.
In goodness grows thy gentle heart.
All the fond wishes that ray mind
Can shape in fancy are for thee ;
And could my hopes fulfillment find.
How grand my little girl would be.
She should be fair as she is now,
And innocent as she now is ;
And glowing on her open brow,
Should all tender charities.
Her eyes should calmly smile around,
Their silent speech, good will and peace;
And her good actions should abound.
To bid all earthly joys increase.
I ask not beauty, though thy face
Child of my heart is kind and fair ;
Nor pride of form, although a grace,
Follows thy footsteps every where.
I simply seek that thou raayst be,
A neighbour true to poor and great;
Such as pale sorrow joys to see,
And gladness hails a welcome mate.


I wish that kindnesses of heart.
May make thee dear e’en to thyself;
That real worlhfull love of art,
Teach thee to scorn both pride and pelf:
That in thy life thou mays’t be true,
To earnest sense of honest worth;
And that thy future hut renew.
That which thou learnd’st to prize on
earth.

THE EMIGRANT’S SONG.
AIR, —“ Jeannot and Jeannette.”
We are going far away—far away from
England’s shore,
And the friends we see around us now, we
never may see more;
But our hearts will be in England, wherever
we may roam
And the land w T e leave behind us now, we
still will call our home.
Perchance beyond the ocean, when we’ve
safely pass’d the storm,
At the hands of good kind people, we may
find a welcome warm ;


For 'tis British blood which flows there, and
’tis British skill which sways,
"Which will mind us of the good old land,
in a hundred modern ways.
When we rise o’er swelling waters, ’tis on
England’s wave we ride,
We’ve a British keel beneath us, arid Bri-
tain’s at our side;
And when our course is run, and we’re just
half round the world,
'Tis the flag of good old England which we
shall see unfurl’d.
We are going far away—far away from
England’s shore,
When the land is far behind us, we shall
love it more and more;
Full of hope, but more of sorrow, we hasten
on our track.
But we see the golden day in store, the
day when we come back.

CARMEN TRIUMPHALE.
IN COMMEMORATION OF THE OPENING OF THE
ROYAL. EXCHANGE, OCT. 28, 1844..
1.
All hail, fair Enterprise !
The walls are built again ;
Slowly we saw them rise—
Slowly to stately height attain.
The chisel traced the stone.
The mallet struck the blow.
Untiring, till the work was done.
Complete above, below.
The halls of Commerce tower, unrivalled,
and alone.


2.
A voice is in those halls.
And with a dreamy sound
Upon the ear it falls
Like varying tones from all the vast
around
Invok’d, each nobler sense,
Each to the heart appeals,
They seek to know from whence
The awe which each one feels ?
They own the power of dumb magnificence.
3.
Deep down beneath the sod
On which the grass grows thin,
Or if by footsteps trod,
Bare of all covering,
Great heaps of stone slept centuries of
years.
See they must come to light,
Layer after layer appears.
The wedge with irresistless might
The block from block, the mass from masses
tears.


4.
Nature made vale and hill,
The features of her face,
But art with wonders novel still
Hath bid them change their place,
Man erst the gift from heaven obtain'd
That all should work his will,
And still that right maintain’d.
He prides him on his skill,
And justifies each step from primal nature
gain’d.
5.
From out her varied store
He takes of stone and lime,
He melts her iron ore
Such as in olden time
Serv’d but to slay, or fetter down his
kind.
But now the sword at rest,
With ready earnest mind,
And love-enkindled breast,
The joys of peace he owns, refining and
refin’d.


G.
The joys of peace ! Behold
Nations with nations share,
See kingdoms each their wealth unfold,
And hither all repair
For lo ! the gates of peace are opening
to their tread,
The walls are built again !
The stone and iron wed !
Chant high the joyous strain
“To foster Peace alone, behold these
halls outspread.”
7.
Hail Commerce, and fair trade.
Proofs of a nation’s strength,
Brighter than aye displayed
Your time shall come at length,
And in these isles eternally abide.
For Britons ever free
Have held them side by side.
Fruit of their industry
Beyond yon lofty portal opening wide I


8.
Who is it enters in,
Chief of a glittering throng,
’Midst drums and trumpets din.
Her citizens among ?
Oh ! ’tis Victoria, England's cheery
Queen.
Approvingly she smiles
As well she might, I ween,
For who in all her isles
But would with smiles’ hehold so pros-
perous a scene.
9.
Yet look around once more,
No palaces are these.
No silken couch, no cushion’d floor,
Nought which invites to ease
Are here to tempt the sense to weakling
joys.
Oh, 'tis a nobler thought
Which the glad heart employs
“ This, Industry hath wrought
The merit of this work no foreign aid
destroys.”


10.
“ "We built it with our hands”
Our merchant princes say,
“ A monument it stands
“ Of what the freeman may
“ By his good handiwork and brain com-
plete ;
“ Yet one thing, gracious Queen,
“ One thing is wanting yet,
“ Still brighter were the scene
“ Could we with trade set free ’gainst the
whole world compete.”
11.
Oh ! fair e’en now these towers
Rise stately in the light!
But yet far sunnier hours
Shall dawn with promise bright
"When the last chain is loosed which
fetters Trade.'
Then truly, British skill
Of none, of nought, afraid
Shall work with heart, and will,
And boast the arts of peace right royally
displayed.


XXX.
TO A LADY OVER THE WAY.
Yes, thou dost well to tend the flowers,
Thou fairer than they all;
The choicest blooms of sweetest bowers
Kind Nature did forestall,
And will’d that we, at once should see
Her richest gifts combined in thee.
White be thy robe, or varying hues
Enwrap thy moulded form.
Not careful need’st thou be to choose,
Art must, I trow, conform ;
And charms of dress, themselves confess
TJnneeded, by thy loveliness.
Were I that rose thou hangest o’er.
Oh ! I should pine and fret;
I would display rny leaves no more,
And Feet’s praise forget;
For who would dare to call me fair
When thy sweet face was present there P


Art thou hut pleasing to the sight,
Is’t all, that which we see ?
Oh! I have heard thy fingers light
Press on the thrilling key ;
Arid tones I’ve heard, may be averr’d.
From thy sweet voice, as of a bird.
A dull, cold street, a stony street.
House walls, and many a stair,
The noisy wheel, and tramp of feet
Of goers here and there,
Hinder the tone, which I alone
Would hear with thee, and call our own.
Not joyous would I he, yet still
The joy were all so rare !
I, first, at least, would take my fill, —
Would there be aught to spare ?
My heart is wide, and at thy side,
I'd pour the draught, whate’er betide.
A draught of love ; oh ! ever full
I’d fill, and drink it up ;
With each deep draught, a flower I’d cull,
And fling it in the cup.
Flowers of the soul, my scented bowl
Should bid my sense in glory roll.


Yes, Love’s deep flood, and Music’s flowers.
Both owing, girl, to thee;
Oh ! truly I, for such bright hours,
A debtor deep, should be.
Yet every lay I would repay,
And all thy love, as lovers may.
Nature to thee has blessings given,
Bless not thyself alone,
No form like thine has ever striven
Against a heart of stone.
List I Nature’s voice, for sure the choice
Is thine, to pine or to rejoice.
God knows I would not harm thee, girl,
Nor teach thee what is “ care ; ”
I would not injure one small curl
Of all thy braided hair;
Nor need I tell what is the spell
To conjure love—thou knows’t it well.
Then to thy window come again,
And with thy rosy lips
If not offended at my strain
Kiss thou thy finger tips;
A pleasant way, ’twill be to say
That I have pleased thee, with my lay.

HYMN TO AUSTRALIA.
All hail! Australia hail!
Borne on the southern gale
Thy stainless flag wave high.
Emblem to earth and sky ;
That Austral land, and islands claim—
The glories of a kingdom’s name.
. No despot’s foot e’er trod
Our all-enfranchised sod—
No serf to serfdom born
Here first beheld the morn :
Freedom of speech, unfetter’d trod,
Have ripen’d here from glorious seed.
And here the heart to warm
Religion’s purest form.
Glowing in mellow light
Meets the entranced sight;
Not gaining grace, from earthly throne,
Her strength, her beauty all her own.


Oh God ! our jprayers attend,
To thee our hearts ascend;
Thy guidance grant that we—
May alway stedfast be,
In righteous cause, a brethren band—
Heart meeting heart, and hand in hand.




TRANSLATIONS.




I.
FROM GÖTHE.
On a bright morning of young spring,
The shepherdess tripped forth and sang ;
No care knew she, the fair young thing.
As through the woods her wild notes rang.
So la, la! le ralla, &c.
Young Thyrsis for a single kiss,
Offered her sheep, aye, one ; two; three;
But archly she refused such bliss.
And laugh’d and sang right merru
So la, la ! le ralla, &c.
Another offered ribbons bright—
Another thought his all too cheap ;
Of hearts and ribbons she made light.
And treated them like Thyrsis’s sheep.
So la, la ! le ralla, &c.


I fear me much the little chit,
From silly sheep such ways had ta’en;
Though sheep and ribbons she might get,
Hearts do not always bid again.
So la, la ! le ralla, &c.
IS3S.


II.
Tuou art too like a flower.
Which each rude blast may destroy ;
I view thee in thy spring-tide hour.
With a melancholy joy.
I wish when e’er I behold thee,
My hand on thy head to lay;
To pray that God ever uphold thee,
Pure as thou art to day.
1838,


III.
FROM THE GERMAN.
Her heart and mine had plighted,
Each to the other their troth ;
And lay so fast united.
That each wish seemed known to both.
But ah, alas ! the blossom.
Which in her breast she wore;
In our embrace forgotten.
Lay crushed to bloom no more.
1838.


IV.
THE MIDNIGHT WATCH.
Oft as my midnight watch I keep,
And slowly on the moments creep ;
I think of her I left behind,
If she be good, and true, and kind.
When first I saw the colours wave.
Can I forget the kiss she gave ;
With ribbons gay my helm she dress’d.
And clasp’d her soldier to her breast.
Oh ! she is constant, yes and good,
This cheers ray heart and fires my blood ;
Though cold and chill the wintry night.
One thought of her gives warmth and light
Now by the tapers flickering ray,
Lonely she dreams the hours away ;
Or bids a simple prayer ascend,
For her poor absent wandering friend.


Oh! fear not, love, though every hour.
Around my head may dangers low’r;
There’s one who each away can wend.
For God is aye the soldier’s friend.
The clock strikes four, the watch comes
round.
To soldier’s ear a grateful sound ;
Sweet he thy sleep, thy dreams of me.
For all my heart love is with thee.
Cologne, 1844.


V.
THE MINSTREL'S CURSE,
FROM THE GERMAN OF UHLAND.
In olden time right high and proud, a noble
castle stood,
Far peering o’er the neighbouring lands,.
e’en to the distant flood :
Whilst round, sweet smelling gardens, a
circling garland drew:
And many a fountain glittered, with the
rainbow’s every hue.
There lived a haughty monarch, rich in
conquest and domain,
With mein all terribly severe, he there his
seat hath ta’en ;
For his thoughts they dwell on horror, and
furious in his mood.
And what he speaks is irony, and what he
writes is blood.


One day drew near this palace proud, a
noble minstrel pair.
The one had locks like riven snow, whilst
brown the other’s hair.
The old man with the harp in hand, on a
proud charger rode,
Meanwhile his comrade, by his side, in
youthful vigour strode.
The old man thus the youth addressed—
“ now, be prepared my son,
“ Think of our rarest melodies, and tune
our d jepest tone.
“ With varying theme, from joy to grief, we
well must play our part,
“ Be it to-day, our chance to touch, this
monarch’s flinty heart.”
Now in the hall the pair are stood, the
lolly piles between.
And on the throne, have ta’en their seats,
the monarch and his queen ;
The monarch fearful in his pride, like ruddy
northern light,
The queen all lovely and serene, as when
the moon shines bright.


And now the old man swept the strings, the
notes told loud and clear;
That full and ever yet more full, they
swell’d upon the ear :
And then like heaven’s own music stream’d
the young man’s voice along,
Whilst with a deep dead ghost-like sound,
toned in the old man’s song.
They sing of spring-tide and of love, of
good old times gone by ;
Of liberty and manly zeal, of faith and
purity:
They sing the graces which a glow, to
manly breasts impart,—
They sing of every noble theme, which
fires the manly heart.
The courtiers circling round the throne,
forget the courtly jest;
The ancient rugged warriors bend, as at
God’s own behest:
The queen suffused all tenderly, with love
and fond desire,
Throws down the rose which graced her
breast, a tribute to the lyre.
o


“ My people ye have all seduced, would’st
also have ray wife”—
The king cries fearfully aloud, to deadliest
purpose rife :
He hurls his sword, which glittering, the
young man’s breast bores through,
Whence ’stead the golden tide of song, the
lifeblood upward flew.
Asunder break the listening throng, like
leaves dispersed by storm.
The young man. in his master’s arras, hath
sank his lifeless form :
He throws his cloak arcund him, and he
sets him on his steed—
He binds him upright sitting, and forth he
doth him lead.
But at the lofty portal halts, the patriarch
of song,
He grasps his harp, to none save which,
like tones did e’er belong;
Against a marble pillar, it’s dashed with
fury wild,
Meanwhile his voice, through hall and court,
with fearful anguish thiill’d.


“ Woe—woe ye stately palaces, for ever
ever mute,
“ Be the voice of song, in your lofty halls,
the harp and the sounding lute:
“ Sighs only, and deep moans be heard, and
the slavish crouching tread,
“Till trampled hy revenge ye lie, in the
dunghill’s loathsome bed.
“ Woe—woe ye blooming gardens, smiling
in spring’s first light,
“ Look on this face and witness, of death’s
distorting blight:
“Sapp’d be each tree, and leafless, and
dried each fountain head,
“For future days a dreary waste, a wilder-
ness outspread.
“Woe—woe, thou maniac homicide, thou
curst of minstrelsy,
“ In vain be all thy graspings, for a blood-
stained eulogy:
“ Thy mem’ry be forgotten, in deepest shade
immersed,
“ Like the last gasp of struggling life, in
empty air outburst.”
o 2


The old man’s voice is mute, but his cry
was heard in heaven,
The lofty towers lie desolate, the walls are
strewed and riven ;
One pillar lone remaining, tells of the days
gone by,
E’en this, all cracked and tottering, may
fall each coming day.
And where the gardens smiled, is a waste
and a barren land,
No single tree invites to shade, no spring
bursts through the sand ;
The monarch’s name survives not, in song
or sounding verse.
Perished and all forgotten that is the
minstrel’s curse.


VI.
THE HOSTESS’S DAUGHTER.
FROM THE GERMAN OF UHLAND.
Tueee youths passed over the flowing
Rhine,
At the house of a hostess they turned them
in.
“ Good hostess have you good wine and
heer ?
“ How speeds it with your daughter fair ?”
“ My wine and beer is fresh and clear—
“ My daughter, she lies on the dark death
bier.”
And as they entered her roof beneath.
She lay there on the shrine of death.
The first, the veil from her features raised.
And long time with mournful look he gazed.
g 3


“Oh ! lived’st thou yet thou beauteous
flower,
“My heart should be thine from this very
hour.”
The second, the veil o'er her face replaced.
And turned him away while the tears fell
fast.
“ Oh! that thou liest on the dark death bier,
“I’ve loved thee right well, so many a
year.”
The third, drew again right quick the veil,
And kissed those lips so deathly pale.
“ I loved thee ever—l love thee to-day,
“ And my love shall be thine to eternity.”


VII.
FROM THE GERMAN OF HEINE.
In dreams I saw my long lost love,
A piteous object lorn and poor ;
A sickly child in hand she led.
Another on her arm she bore.
Her form, ah ! once so beautiful,
Wasted and worn and sore distress’d ;
Whilst poverty, with all its cares,
Her gait and garments both confess’d.
Along the damp and dreary street.
She trod all totteringly and slow;
And as she came to where I stood,
I said in accents slow and low.
“ To my own home come go with me,
For thou art wanting, pale and ill ;
The labour of my hands shall serve
Thy wants to meet, thy woes to still.”


“ Thy little ones I’ll tend and watch,
And bid my humble means to share;
But more than all, thyself poor thing,
Shal’t be the object of my care.”
" I’ll never bid thee list the tale,
How once I hoped thy love to crave ;
And when thou’rt gone,—a silent tear
I’ll weep upon thy hapless grave.”
1839.


VIII.
THE FISHER GIRL.
Thou lovely fisher maiden,
Bid thy skiff near the strand ;
Come then and sit thee beside me.
We’ll whisper hand in hand.
And if my arms enclasp thee
Say, hast thou cause for fear ;
Dost thou not trust the ocean,
E’en when the storm is near.
My heart too, like the ocean,
Has storm, and ebb and flow ;
But pearls of fairest whiteness,
Lie in its depths below.


IX.
THE CASTLE ON THE SEA.
FROM THE GERMAN OF UHLAND.
Has’t seen the noble castle,
The stately ocean keep ;
Which ’round so red and golden.
The clouds all proudly sweep ?
It stoops as would it lave
Its foot in the flood below ;
Its lofty turrets tower,
In the evening’s purple glow !
Full well I saw the castle,
The towers so high and proud ;
The moon rode proudly over it.
And o’er it swept the cloud.
The winds and waves gay hounding,
Bore they with sound along ;
Didst hear the halls resounding,
With tones of feast and song ?


The winds and every wave
Were hushed in deep repose,
I wept as from the halls
The sound of woe arose.
Dids’t see in hall or tower,
The monarch and his queen,
The mantle proudly waving—
The crown’s reflected sheen P
Led they not forth in gladness,
A virgin tall and fair,
Brighter than summer brightness.
Decked in her golden hair.
I saw the noble parents—
The golden crown was gone ;
I saw dark mourning vestments,
But maiden saw I none.
1840.


X.
THE SONG OF THE HEBREW.
Friends and kindred, fate-united,
Is it still our lot to mourn !
Must our every joy be blighted,
Still the badge of woe be borne ?
Our’s in spite of fell oppression
Are earth’s treasures, jewels, gold ;
All is ours in full possession,
All that hate could not withhold.
Reck' we not of scoff, nor scorn.
Mockery soon shall turn to shame ;
We who boast us Jewish born,
Mindful of our father’s fame :
As the Macabee victorious—
As our fathers with the sword
Fought and fell, nor fell inglorious—
Fight we with the enlighten’d word.


Not upon the willow listless.
Bid be hung the Jewish lyre ;
Rather let the song resistless,
Melt to love the Gentile’s ire :
Not by falchion, not by spear—
Not by blood be justice won ;
This the banner that we bear—
“ Jew and Gentile are as one.”
But if still, untouched remains.
Stony still the Gentile’s heart;
We triumphant o’er our pains,
Then may boast the better part.
Whilst our peaceful banner w r aves.
This our glorious song shall be—
They to prejudice the slaves,
And, in soul, the freeman we.
Aix la Chnpelle, 1843.


XI.
FREEDOM OF THOUGHT—WORD-AND
DEED.
Freedom of speech, unshackled deed,
Brethren with joy we hail;
Sown is e’en now the generous seed.
Whose increase ne’er shall fail:
Seed of a race, whose roots entwine—
Where proudly flows the German Rhine.
Take, each then—take the brother’s hand.
Proudly the brow upraise;
Once more pervades our Fatherland,
The soul of other days.
The soul, oh ! more than half divine—
The genius of the German Rhine.


For this, whilst round the goblet goes,
We’ll drink the Royal pair ;
At their behest, at once repose,
Proportionate and fair.
Freedom to act, as to opine—
They will’d it free, the German Rhine.
See how the spirit thus set free,
Rises into the light;
The eagle not more loftily,
Pursues his homeward flight.
Like him, the skies alone confine—
The genius of the German Rhine.
Drink next the Deputies; again
Circle the goblet round ;
They will not that their fellow men,
Be beaten like the hound.
The knout to Russia, they resign—
Far be it from the German Rhine.
Nor shall henceforth the man be known,
By outside look or dress ;
Peasant and peer alike we own,
In native manliness.
Their humble birtb, shall none repine—
Who boast their land the banks of Rhine.


The Rhine ! the Rhine ! it sihall be free.
Through mountain, plain and vale ;
A nation’s voice in harmony,
With deathless song shall hail. •
As votary new at Freedom’s shrine—
The genius of the German Rhine.
Aix In Chapelle, 1842.


POSTSCRIPT.
All youthful sympathies are dear,
Be they express’d in love-taught song ;
Or by mens voices sounding clear,
From stirrings of a national wrong.
Alas ! that national interests jar,
And fights and feuds disturb the earth ;
For all the glorious feats of war,
But rob the lands and spoil their worth.
Arc not our best hopes set on peace,
When Commerce with a gilded hand
Shall bid these warlike tumults cease,
And ope still more a fairy land.
When all in mutual aid combining,
Shall beautify and deck the world.
And national interests close entwining,
Shall bid the flags of war be furl’d.


Soon may it be, when every lanJ,
Each strengthen’d in its own fair right;
Can give again the brother’s hand,
And rub the war-raoil’d harness bright.
—And set it up against the wall,
Like cupboard china priz’d by dames;
To chronicle what did befall,
The almost then forgotten names.
Soon may the general anthem rise,
Sounding right gloriously along ;
And echoing both to earth and skies,
“ Good will on earth, and peace to men.”
Kewnham, May 1850.
