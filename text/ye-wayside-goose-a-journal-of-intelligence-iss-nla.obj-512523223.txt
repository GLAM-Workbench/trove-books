AND THE CHIEF SAID
UNTO THE TRIBE
A woman, dressed in the latest
fashion platery, may look charming,
hut a hole in her stocking will attract
more attention.
Take a man from the ranks, put him
into a uniform with many brass but-
tons fhereon, and he instantly assumes
a majestic air—and acts the bear.
You may fail several times in
striving for your ideals, hut remember
your enthusiasm acts as a tonic to the
weary struggler.
Beware of gluttony, and ape not
the pig.
Your life is a book, and you are the
judge of its pages.
Don’t be a giggler. Let the world
see that you can be serious at times.
A giggler lamentably fails when it
comes to grasping life’s problems.
When weariness o’ercomes you, get
out into the sunlight of love.
Fishing may be likened unto life.
Once cast the line into the sea of life,
and, waiting patiently, you bring up
either a silvery fish or a piece of sea-
weed.
Hal E. Stone.


IN THE WAKE OF
THE BEAUTIFUL
Til S die natural year draws round
J I to a finish, and the perished
winter emerges into spring, the
old impulses for recreation
are revived. Not a foot but
treads the ground more lightly, and a
trifle more eagerly, as the hours of
sunshine lengthen and soften at die
approach of spring.
Plodding through streets of slush
and under shies of slate is all very
well; but when the roads are dry
underfoot, and die shy is blue over-
head, the tramp instinct, which is no
respecter of respectability, wahes up
and has its due.
The wild wander-lust is on us, and
as we looh out of our window in die
early hours of the morning, and note
die pale, warm spring shy, there comes
a longing for a looh at die real color
of the earth —yes, real and green —
not this sichly gray of granite and
asphalt. It is irresistible, so off we
start, shortly after breahfast, to mahe
this longing definite, the party consist-
ing of Hal and Phil Stone and my-
self.
Queen’s Parh, Moonee Ponds, is our
trysting-place. Our way lay through
North Carlton and Brunswich —unin-
teresting, save for die curious construc-
tion of quaint houses we meet with —
and in due time we arrive at the Parh
gates.


Once inside the Park we feel that
we have left the city miles away, for
here are flowers in plenty, and that
incessant, dreamy hum of bird - life
which is inseparable from any country
scene. The walks wind easily for the
most part between oaks, thorns, and
other trees, and the perfume of the
pink and white buds swaying slightly
in die breeze comes to us as we walk
—a waft of delicate and fragrant
freshness!
The ponds, with their different
varieties of water-lilies, are inspected,
and then we'stroll around the Park,
with its picturesque lake in the centre,
which is surrounded by lawns and
flower beds, with some very beautiful
blooms.
Here on the verdant and smooth-
shaven grass, a few feet away from
the water’s edge, the camera is ad-
justed and a photo of the lake obtained,
which, widi the swans gliding here and
there, forms a pretty scene. From
here, too, we have a good view of die
northern portion of the Park. Here is
preserved a bit of the forest primeval
—the trees in their natural position,
unaltered by and unacted upon by
man.
Continuing our walk around the
lake, we come at last to the Rosery,
which, despite the rough and inclement
weather of the previous week, makes
a fine display, with upwards of 1000
plants, comprising 600 different varie-
ties of roses; each kind standing out


though, when one has to advertise cash
prizes for contributions from amateurs.
Where is the distinction drawn between
amateurism and professionalism ?
Thus Dr. Edwin B. Swift in a letter
of welcome to his Australian brethren:
“Say to the amateurs of your country
I send them a cordial greeting of good-
fellowship. Let their pens always
spread the gospel of Truth; may their
nibs be broken before they are dipped
in the ink-well of gall and wormwood.
Let them take Shakespeare’s guidance:
‘To thine own self be true.
And it must follow, as the night
the day.
Thou canst not fhen he false to any
man.
We thank Dr. Swift for his kind
message, but would add that in ex-
pounding the gospel of Truth to some
is as a concoction of gall and worm-
wood, and has a disastrous effect upon
their nerves; they have no conscience.
Truth is mighty, and the Waysiders
have a happy knack of utilising it.
For that reason we have gained many
enemies; but we don’t mind that —it s
all in the game.
The East is the newsiest of all a.j.
papers. An article therein refers to a
prominent Brooklyn amateur who tried
to “bunco steer’ the Chief, but got it
“in the neck from Chas. Hems.
Arrows, entitled the Hal E. Stone
Issue, contains the charges against
E. H. Smith, of Brooklyn.

GABBLE OF THE GOOSE
__ NEW policy bas been decided
j| upon. Heretofore quite a lot
of space bas been devoted to
amateur matters, but for tbe
future tbe newer class of jour-
nalism will be catered for.
Tbe Medicine Man went very solid
against any change, and argued all
ways— and ngbtly so, too —but tbe
Tribe believed tbe new series worth a
trial.
In tbe early days of Ye Wayside
Goose no one showed a greater interest
in its welfare than did Mr. John
Brennan, and now that be is suffering
from rheumatism we want to say bow
very sorry we are.
During tbe year there will emanate
from tbe Waysiderie, a cbap-booke
with this strange title —Tbe Gathering
of die Moss, by Hal E. Stone. 50
pages, and printed in tbe Waysiders
own peculiar style. 60 cents gets it.
Samuel Goddard, Maker of Quaint
Pictures, is to be married on April
20th. and as Sam is tbe first tribes-
man found guilty of such an act,
tbe Chief reckons that a fine of 50
cents will suffice.
Phil Stone tried bis prentice band
at engraving on metal, also zinc etch-
ing, and, according to results this
issue, be bas been very successful.

House,’ whereat will meet all mem-
bers of tbe Waysiders on March Btb.

THE WAYSIDE BOWS
DOWN IN SORROW.
FROM EARTH TO HEAVEN,
NATHANIEL ALBERT SHAW,
JANUARY 27, 1905,
AGED 23 YEARS.
u HESITATION, a dash across
the oncoming milk cart, a big
red gasb on the breast, and
Nathaniel Albert Shaw was
dead.
The tragical ending of such a young
life was a terrible shock to us.
Only a few nights previous to the
tragedy be bad visited the home of
the Waysiders, and kept the staff in
quite a merry mood. We explained
the trips to the country and our love
of the beautiful. Albert Shaw was
interested, and hoped to be with us
at die next outing.
Little did we dream of fbe awful
death that awaited him.
“I ll see you again soon,” be said
as be left our bouse ; and be having
mounted bis bicycle, we watched him
ride away into the night.
Sometimes it hardly seems real to
think that Albert is gone from us, and
at eventide when we watch the rest-
less people moving to and fro, and
seethe glinting of fbe lights, fbe fbought
comes to us fbat be will come again.


PRESCRIPTIONS OF
THE MEDICINE MAN
111.-. Why not XXX?—then there
would be something in it.
Face: You say you are unsettled.
Well, if you don’t pay your sub.
you 11 be settled quick enough.
The French Novelist: We give you
credit for being a hard-working en-
thusiast, but, remember, Australians
are not born in France, nor are their
customs similar to those of Paree.
Indigestible Bill: Close your mouth
and breathe through your ears;
they’re large enough.
Sympathiser: Never mind telling us
about your blue blood. Ours is
just the ordinary red variety, but
rather guess it gets there every time.
M.K.; So the ‘Little Vagabond’ is
arrested, after all ? Ah, well, as
you say, there is little, if any, com-
pensation for hard work in the
manuscript journal line.
Frank Stroud: No, the Medicine Man
has not had his photo taken of late
years. The Chief does all the
posing for the Tribe, and he has a
mortgage on all the plates.
T.D.; No use to us. Try a larger
journal.
Whiskers: We know of nothing that
would suit your case. If they will
not grow naturally, dip your chin
in glue, and we will lend you a mat
and a pair of scissors.
Martin C. Brennan.
