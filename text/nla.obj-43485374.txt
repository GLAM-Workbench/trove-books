Mr. Q. H. Reid’s Manifesto
Speech delivered by the Liberal Leader at the 1.0.0. F. Temple,
Elizabeth Street, on October 23rd, 1906.
A meeting of the members and
supporters of the Australian De-
mocratic Union, and the various
leagues co-operating with the
union, was held last night in the
1.0.0. F. Temple, Elizabeth-
street. The Right Hon. G. H.
Reid presided in his official capa-
city.
With him on the platform were
Mrs. Reid, Mr. Joseph Cook,
M.H.R., Mrs. Cook, Senators
Walker and Gould, Messrs. Syd-
ney Smith. W. E. Johnson, W. H.
Kelly, H. W. Lee, Sir James Gra-
ham, Mr. John Hindle, and a
number of other ladies and gentle-
men.
Mr. Reid said: I have been
away so much from Sydney that
I was anxious to have the plea-
sure of the company of the mem-
bers of our Democratic Union,
executive, and those who are part
of the committees in the various
suburbs of the great metropolis;
also some of the representatives
of the leagues—the six leagues—
of which this Democratic Union is
composed. lam glad to meet
you, to thank you for the great
services, the unpaid services, the
devoted, zealous service, which
you are devoting to a proper pre-
paration for the great electoral
struggle which is before us.
I now propose to acquaint you
with the manifesto which I ad-
dress to the ELECTORS OF THE
AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.
THE MANIFESTO.
In addressing the electors of
the Commonwealth may I pause
for a moment to thank, with the
utmost gratitude, those of you
ELECTORS OF EAST SYDNEY.
who live in East Sydney, whose
wonderful kindness and constant
support have been my chief en-
couragement and reward through
the whole of my long public car-
eer. Mr. Watson and the leagues
that control him brand me as the
leader of a “reactionary and con-
servative party.” This charge is a
false one. (Cheers.) lam the
leader of a party in New South
Wales, and in Australia, too,
THE LIBERAL AND DEMO-
CRATIC PARTY.
which is essentially liberal and
democratic. (Hear, hear.) Our
policy has always been directed
against monopoly and privilege
in every shape or form. The
greatest victory ever won in the
Southern Hemisphere for the just
rights of the people, in the way of
lessening the burdens of the poor,
and in the direction of making the
wealthier classes contribute more
fairly to the cost of Government,
was won by our efforts in New
South Wales. (Applause.) It
is also said that the wealthy
classes, who have always opposed
me for so many years are helping
our party now. I repeat what the
Hon. Dugald Thomson, the trea-
surer of the Democratic Union,
has said: We have neither asked
nor received, in this great cam-
paign, a single penny of financial
support, from any of those great
financial bodies to which refer-
ence has been made. (Applause.)
So long as persons of that class
act fairly and honorably they are
just as much entitled to defend
their industrial liberty as any

other person. Does Mr. Watson
forget that his followers are
straining every nerve to destroy
HIGH TARIFFISTS.
private enterprise? Does he for-
get that the high tariff manufac-
turers behind Mr. Deakin are
fighting to increase the burdens
of the people for their own per-
sonal advantage? The rich have
nothing to expect from us that


the poor have not. Not long ago
an eminent personage, who some-
times alludes to controversial
politics, gave us a more flattering
notice. He saw in us, if not the
broad and healthy characteristics
of patriotic democrats like Mr.
Watson and his party, at least a
resemblance to one of the great-
est and most valiant, if one of
the most eccentric champions of
poor and distressed humanity,
MR. DEAKIN AND SIR GEORGE
TURNER AND MR. REID.
Don Quixote. (Laughter.) So
long as Mr. Deakin was in office
he got on very well with the La-
bor Party. That was so from
May, 1901, to April, 1904. That
was so from June, 1905, down to
the present day. It was not so
between April, 1904, and June,
1905. Mr. Deakin was then out
of office. He, with Sir George
Turner, met me in conference in
May, 1904. We then resolved to
form a basis of coalition.
He, however, refused to take
his proper share of the burd-
en. (Hear, hear.) Sir George,
though stricken with a griev-
ous illness, imperilled his
health rather than allow me to be
utterly fooled, and took on him-
self the duty Mr. Deakin would
not. A year afterwards, Mr.
Deakin made a speech which
made our position intolerable. I
adopted a certain course, which
Mr. Deakin thinks “treachery and
betrayal.” That course Sir
George Turner and every other
Minister fully concurred in. (Ap-
plause.) This imputation of
treachery and betrayal represents
all Sir George Turner has got
from his old friend as a reward
for keeping faith with me in Mr.
Deakin’s place. Sir George, one
of the best and straightest and
most useful public men Australia
ever had, has not regained his
health, and is compelled to retire
from public life—l hope only for
a time.
WHO WAS THE BETRAYER?
On Saturday, June 24, 1904, at
the end of the recess, Mr. Deakin,
at Ballarat, whilst in alliance with
me, publicly asked the Labor
Party to enter into an alliance
with him. I point to that as the
act of betrayal. (Cheers.) It
took the heart and soul out of our
compact of alliance. Even with
every Deakinite with us, we had
only a bare majority. One de-
faulter could have ousted us.
That speech at Ballarat, every
newspaper in Australia regarded
as a “notice to quit.” Could Igo
hat in hand to Mr. Deakin, and
ask if he really meant it? If he
did not mean it, could he not have
corrected the universal impres-
sion by one friendly word? That
friendly word was never spoken.
The day before the speech, in a
newspaper published 12,000 miles
away, it was announced that Mr.
Deakin in that speech would “re-
unite the protectionists and end
the coalition.” Was the cable-
gram a spiritualistic freak?
(Laughter.) Scarcely, for the cor-
respondent of the London news-
paper was, and is, a parliament-
ary hand on the staff of the Mel-
bourne “Age!” I know now that
the defeat of the Reid-M‘Lean
Government was arranged be-
tween the Labor Party and the
Deakinites, or some of them, be-
fore Parliament met on the after-
noon of June 28. Early in the
morning of that day a Deakinite
approached Sir Phillip Fysh, and
asked if he would support a mo-
tion to defeat us. To his credit,
“WE’VE GOT THEM BEATEN.”
he refused. He was then told,
“We have got them beaten, any-
how!” Sir Phillip Fysh will not
tell me the name of the Deakinite,
but I have reason to believe he is
an influential member of the pre-
sent Administration. Will Mr.
Deakin ask Sir Phillip who it was?
THE EXPIRING PARLIAMENT.
He might tell him. The results of
the general election of 1903 made
the position of parties worse—
Mr. Deakin became more help-
less, the caucus became more
powerful. The position sickened
Mr. Deakin, and he escaped from
it. Having broken from the cau


cus he suddenly discovered that
I was a good Liberal, with whom
he could unite, and whom he
could heartily support! The La-
bor Government went into office
in April, 1904; he joined me in
May. He then told the Labor
Party and the Labor Leagues
what he really thought of them.
A more scathing political denun-
ciation was never uttered in Aus-
tralia. They were the “fatal
enemies of Australian progress.”
They threatened “the indepen-
dence of the whole community.”
They sought “to rush Australia
over a precipice.” They were lead-
ing the Commonwealth “on a
downward path to, perhaps, so-
cial slavery.” Yet within a few
months he was again their most
obedient servant! (Laughter.)
The “social slavery” is not yet,
but the “Ministerial slavery” be-

MENT.
gan afresh. Mr. Deakin’s com-
ments on that Administration are
most unfair and inaccurate. We
came into office in the middle of
one session, and were strangled
before another session could be-
gin. Every day Parliament sat
with the slenderest possible ma-
ority; we were met by the bitter-
est possible opposition. The dif-
ference between his term of office
and mine was, we would not pur-
chase a day’s life at a sacrifice of
self-respect. (Cheers.) What
was his conduct? He rushed
again into the arms of the very
men whom he declared to be the
enemies of their country.
LAST SESSION.
“A DEGRADING ALLIANCE."
This degrading alliance enabled
Mr. Deakin to count on a tempor-
ary, .but for the time solid, acqu-
iescent majority. Was it strange
that a good deal of work was
done? The quality of the work,
however, will not bear criticism.
There was always a strong selfish
element working behind the
scenes. Behind Mr. Deakin there
were those who wanted something
more from the taxpayers. (Hear,
hear.) Behind Mr. Watson there
was an arm}' that wanted fresh
advantages, and further means of
coercing non-unionists. The poli-
tical atmosphere was dense with
self-interest. Under these condi-
tions the Opposition had a con-
stant, desperate, battle to main-
tain in defence of the public inter-
ests, and sound principles of
legislation. Some of the meas-
ures of the Government included
good objects, which the Opposi-
tion supported, but they nearly
always went to extremes, which it
was our duty to resist, or were
full of defects it was our duty to
correct. The able, indeed, the
splendid work done by my deputy,
Mr. Joseph Cook—(cheers)—dur-
ing my absence, often on political
business, as well as professional
work, have been obvious to the
whole community. That which Mr.
Deakin calls “obstruction” most
people will recognise as strenuous
untiring efforts to protect the
THE ANTI-TRUST ACT.
public welfare. The Anti-Trust
Act is a conspicuous specimen of
the faults I have mentioned. Effi-
cient measures to prevent unfair
practices by trade combinations
all can support. But even Mr.
Watson does not believe in the
methods of this Act. Under cover
of a good object, that is, a
power over trusts to prevent
wrongdoing, there was enact-
ed a system of prohibitory
protection which entangles in Sir
William Lyne’s net every single
trader, whether British or Austra-
lian, who is engaged in ocean
commerce with the Common-
wealth !
THE PRICE OF OFFICE.
Before I came into office a bill of
the previous Deakin Government,
to prevent the piracy of trade
marks, was twisted out of shape
by a Labor amendment in the
Senate, inserting a scheme of
trade-union labels, of which
there were none then in exist-
tence. We opposed this in the
Senate, but the bill came down to
the House, where we did not take


THE UNION LABEL.
it up. In Adelaide Mr. Deakin
tried to connect me with the union
label. Sir Josiah Symon exposed
his unfairness. At Ballarat, on
Wednesday last, Mr. Deakin, who
knew so much better, repeated
the same miserable tactics. After
we came to office no Minister ever
touched the union label provision
except to try to get it omitted.
The Deakin Government elabor-
ately recast and supported the
union label provisions, which are
now law. It was part of the
price they paid for office. In its
practical operation this power en-
ables trade unions to force every
non-unionist out of a factory. In-
deed, if there were 500 unionists
and five non-unionists in a fac-
tory, the 500 are not allowed by
the law, even if willing, to give
their label to the manufacturer so
THE CONTRACT IMMIGRANTS
ACT.
long as the five remain! This
Contract Immigrants Act makes
things real!}' worse for the best
sort of immigrants—those who
come out, not as adventurers, but
under engagement to do work
waiting for them. Thanks to Mr.
Dugald Thomson, not to the Gov-
ernment, a provision was inserted
relieving our kinsmen in England,
Scotland, and Ireland, from some
of the odious conditions still at-
taching to other nations. Mr.
Deakin and Mr. Watson would
open the gates wide to “a farmer
with a little capital.” They will
not open the gates wide to a
white agricultural laborer, whose
capital is in his brain and sinews,
and a definite offer of honest
work. (Applause.) These men
are called “slaves” or “chattels.”
As if an engagement to labor left
an Australian a free man, yet
makes a European something less
than a free man! Misguided,
rampant self-interest is at the
bottom of this, not patriotism.
(Applause.) Throw open all your
gates for white men who will help
us build up a white Australia
on something better than Acts of
Parliament—human energy and
enterprise. (Cheers.) Yet Mr.
Deakin, who backs the Labor
party up in their “dog-in-the-man-
ger” policy, puts £"5000 on the
estimates, and says he has con-
verted a great immigration policy

VICTORIA.
into an “actuality.” (Laughter.)
All parts of the Empire joined in
the project of an Imperial monu-
ment, in London, in honor of our
late Sovereign, the best the world
has ever seen. Our Government
joined. If ever there was a pro-
ject in which protectionists, free-
traders and Laborites could joy-
fully unite this was one. Yet the
Labor party refused to join, sug-
gesting a hospital. “O Charity,
how many meannesses are cloak-
ed by thy name”
THE TARIFF COMMISSION.
Shortly after the Coalition Gov-
ernment was formed, on the basis
of a fiscal truce, the Isaacs-Lyne
wing of the Opposition sought to
embarrass us by a clamor for re-
lief for the artisans of Melbourne,
who were alleged to be starving,
and the industries of Melbourne,
which were alleged to be ruined.
Mr. Isaacs, now happily removed
from mundane troubles —(laugh-
ter) —shed tears of anxious sym-
pathy over the missing “Christ-
mas dinner” of these unhappy vic-
tims. Our Government appoint-
ed a Royal Commission to inquire
into the work of the tariff and its
effects on Australian industries.
I courted the fullest investiga-
tion. I knew there might well
be anomalies that called for re-
dress, and hardships that ought
to be removed. But I felt sure
that the pictures of misery were
sham pictures, and that the
“ruin” was bogus so far as the
effect of the tariff was concerned.
Mr. Deakin did not object to the
appointment of the commission,
indeed I conferred with him as to
its composition. The evidence
published from day to day reveal-
ed many unblushing attempts to
fleece the public, but few cases
in which the tariff had been the


genuine cause of genuine dis-
tress. It was shown in some
cases that those who begged for
“more protection” had already an
amount of duty which not only
covered “the difference between
Australian wages and the low wa-
ges of other countries,” but actu-
ally amounted to a higher propor-
tion of value than all the money
spent in wages! The farmers ap-
peared before the commissioners
to beg that the duties should not
be increased. At the present
time the manufacturers of Vic-
toria are prospering beyond pre-
vious experience, and are pushing
their wares all over Australia.
The men who clamored most, the
two McKays, of the “ Sunshine
harvesters,” were found to be
making a profit of many thous-
ands a year. A special Act to
make them better off at the ex-
pense of the struggling Australi-
an farmer has been triumphantly
passed. (Cries of “Shame.”) Yet
the hands employed in agricultu-
ral implement works in Victoria
have doubled in the past two or
three years! This simply means
that the McKays will make a
magnificent haul out of a sham
crisis!
PREFERENTIAL TRADE.
The treaty with South Africa was
a good one, easily accomplished.
That with New Zealand has mis-
carried. But in reference to the
scheme of preferential trade with
England, the Prime Minister has
covered himself with ridicule,
both as the founder of a policy
and as its pilot through Parlia-
ment. (Hear, hear.) The only
conceivable shape in which the
Mother-country could give us any
preference worth having would be
in the form of duties on food and
raw materials, the bulk of the
British imports from Australia.
The only conceivable way in
which the British people could be
induced to change their present
feeling would be by a genuine
preference and real advantage,
given to the British manufactur-
ers, in the markets of Australia.
Better far to do nothing than
A SHAM OFFER.
make a sham offer, which could
only strengthen the opponents
and discourage the champions of
preference in the Mother-country.
Yet that is what the Government
have done. Not a single duty was
reduced in favor of Great Britain,
and the duties raised against the
rest of the Empire and foreign
countries covered only a few hun-
dred thousand pounds worth of
foreign trade! Our import of ap-
parel and textiles is .£9,500,000
a year. Our import of piece
goods, including woollens, is £6,~
250,000 a year. Our import
of metals and machinery is
;£6,3 50,000. With two excep-
tions, covering of foreign
trade, there is not one line
of preference to the Mother-coun-
try in any shape or form touching
the ,£22,000,000 worth of trade
under those headings! If Mr.
Deakin’s measure was a sham,
his piloting of the measure was
even worse. He allowed an
amendment to stand, as to the
color of the crews and cabin boys
on British ships carrying the
goods, which makes acceptance
of that bill by the British Govern-
ment impossible. The amendment
was carried in a thin House by a
majorit}' of one. I happened to
be there. (Laughter.) I implored
the Prime Minister to try for its
recission. He refused. The end
of it all was that the Board of
Trade reminded him of a number
of Treaties by which we are
bound, and the poor man in his
desperation actually made use of
a Governor-General’s message in
order to set a bill right, not in a
matter of form, but of substance.
The Senate properly refused to
allow the Government to intro-
duce the King’s representative
into the sphere of politics in order
to cure the foolishness of his Min-
isters. (Loud cheers.)
THE CAPITAL SITE.
The bungling of the Government
over this important matter has
been mainly caused by the duel
between two Ministers, Sir Wm.
Lyne and Mr. Chapman, for their


respective sites—(hear, hear) —
and the desire of the Victorian
members of the Cabinet to go
very slow. If the selection of the
site involved a huge expenditure
as often alleged, one could not
wonder at opposition. But the ex-
penditure need not run into large
figures, until the population runs
into many millions, A capital in
Sydney, or Melbourne, would cost
ever so much more than a capital
in the interior. Every represen-
tative in New South Wales should
be bound down to a demand for
an immediate settlement of this
matter. (Applause.) There was
a wonderful struggle to add to
the revenues of the harvester
makers—if one-tenth of that had
been devoted to the ques-
tion of the capital site it
would have been chosen long ago.
QUEENSLAND SUGAR
INDUSTRY.
(Cheers.) I joined with those
who were prepared to repatriate
the Kanakas, and this, of course,
exposed that great industry to a
period of anxiety and crisis.
Every proof that the ruin predict-
ed will not follow 7 I notice with
great pleasure. If the white la-
bor in Australia cannot, or will
not, save the cane fields from
desolation the industry must be
reinforced by white labor from
abroad. But, so far, no necessity
has been shown for extraordinary
TRANSCONTINENTAL RAIL-
WAYS.
measures. Various great projects
are “m the air” for railway sys-
tems across the continent from
and to various points. Such pro-
jects must, some day, be carried
out. But I, speaking for my-
self, regard a railway exten-
sion through South Australia
to West Australia as one
which ought certainly to be
carried out, unless the proposed
survey shows it to be impractic-
able. I regard the bill for a sur-
vey of the line, not as a conces-
sion, but as the least possible
thing we can do in justice to the
grand State, and the enterprising
people, of Western Australia.
(Cheers.) Closer touch between
that vast area and the sister
States will be of signal service
to all. I know there is much op-
position to this by members of all
the political parties, but I have
never altered my views as ex-
pressed from the first.
“HOME RULE.”
One of the saddest mistakes the
dying Parliament has made was
its abuse of its proper authority
displayed in an Address to the
King on the subject of Home Rule
for Ireland. I appealed to the
House to leave that vexed and
burning question to the ordinary
fields of free public discussion,
instead of using the name of the
whole Parliament and people
without any warrant from the
constituencies. Our Federal Par-
liament has troubles, and fights,
and duties enough without advis-
ing other Parliaments —equally
independent—how they can im-
prove their legislative machinery.
If a separate Parliament for Ire-
land would be a good, thing, I am
satisfied the good sense of the
people of the United Kingdom will
bring it about. (Cheers.) The
wish of every admirer of the illus-
trious Irish race is that the mem-
ory of their ancient wrongs may
\be entirely effaced by every pos-
sible measure of generous re-
dress. Public opinion on the sub-
ject of Home Rule is greatly di-
vided. Many support it because
they believe it will make the Uni-
ted Kingdom more united still.
Others believe the movement to
be inspired by a desire to break
up the United Kingdom and dis-
member the British Empire.
(Cheers.) The Federal Parlia-
ment should not have forced the
controversy on Australian poli-
tics. Leaving this review of the
past, I now come to
THE PRESENT SITUATION.
The Parliament will soon be dis-
solved, and its Ministry and its
members are approaching that
one eventful day on which you,
and not they, are the masters of
the State. You, ladies and gen-
tlemen, the electors of the whole

Commonwealth, must judge be-
tween us. The Government comes
before you not with a majority,
but as a remnant of a body whose
majority has disappeared. That
solid phalanx of 45, which got on
so comfortably together, making
laws as if they really believed in
one another, is now broken into
two. One fragment is driven to
the painful task of exterminating
the other. The other fragment
fills the air with curses aimed at
the “machine,” whose pliant tool
it was a few short days ago.
(Prolonged applause.) Such is
the deplorable state to which re-
sponsible government and par-
liamentary institutions have been
reduced. How pitiful the present
fate of that Constitution, which
Mr. Deakin in his better days
used to hold up to your enraptur-
ed imagination, “strong as a fort-
ress, sacred as a shrine!”
THE DEAKIN REMNANT.
I am going now to give you the
numbers of the respective parties
in the House:—
* Two vacancies.
Nine Ministers and twelve sup-
porters! What satire more sting-
ing than these plain figures could
be invented? (Cheers.) And what
appeal does this diminutive rem-
nant make for a fresh lease of
power and leadership in Austra-
lia? Clearly, its only chance of
hying as a Government depends
upon another miserable term of
servitude to the Socialist “ ma-
chine” and the Labor caucus.
Alone, it can do nothing but in-
ju;e the Liberal cause and ad-
vance ihe Socialist cause. And
yet every Minister but one is an
Anti-Socialist! And that one is
a political conundrum. (Laughter,
and cry of “Sir William Lyne.”)
Surely the electors will restore
Australian politics to some higher
level in which great principles
range men into sympathetic
groups! The Labor - Socialist
leagues are doing one good thing
for Australian politics—they are
striving to get rid of the system
of three parties just as strenu-
ously as we are. They have re-
sponded with scorn to the over-
tures for an alliance, not based
on principle, but place and pay.
They believe their party has a fu-
ture. We know the Government
has only a past. Unless you,
ladies and gentlemen, respond
either to the appeal of the Oppo-
sition or the appeal of the Social-
ists, you will be the real authors
of another miserable period of in-
trigue. (Loud applause.) What
is the appeal the shattered Deak-
in Administration makes for a
continuance of its humiliating
career? What great, inspiring
cry comes from Ballarat? No-
thing but a wail over a distress
which does not exist, in order to
fill the pockets of a few men who
already have enough out of. the
taxpayers. (A voice: “Too
much.”) The Victorian Chamber
of Manufacturers waited on the
Chief Secretary a few days ago,
and drew a sad picture, not of a
deficiency of orders, but a defi-
ciency of skilled labor. Last time
Mr. Deakin was for “Fiscal peace”
and “Preferential Trade.” Now
he is for “Higher 1 - iff” and “Pre-
ferential tariff.” The latter dual
cry is almost a contradiction in
terras, for Great Britain manu-
factures nearly all the things the
additional duties are wanted for.
Will the Government specify the
industries which are in distress?
The Labor-Socialist Party, on the
other hand, raises one of the
most momentous problems of the
present day. The issue which
rises above all others, as a lofty
mountain rises above a range of
hills, is that involved in the so-
cialistic “objective” of the Labor
party. Is that to be the “beacon


light” of the political destinies of
Australia, or is it not? (Cries of
“No.”) That is the great ques-
tion beside which all others are
insignificant. That great ques-
tion divides two great parties.
What says the party hanging on
our flanks? If it is against So-
cialism, why is it fighting us? If
it is for Socialism, why is it fight-
ing the Socialists?
THE FUTURE.
Now I come to the most import-
ant subject—to the future. Be-
fore dealing with the great, the
vital issue, to which I have refer-
red, I desire to point out the lines
of public policy which should in
my opinion be followed upon some
other public questions.
THE CAUCUS.
i. One of the chief grounds on
which I earnestly appeal to the
electors to vote for my supporters
is that I desire to see the suprem-
acy of the secret caucus destroy-
ed. The fate of policies now is
decided in secret conclaves, which
contain representatives bound
hand and foot to vote as a major-
ity decides, on all matters affect-
ing the platform; and few things
do not! If thirteen in the caucus
say “Yes” and twelve say “No,”
the whole twenti’-five are compel-
led to say “Yes” in Parliament,
twelve' violating their judgment
and the duty they owe to the Par-
liament and to the electors of
Australia. (A voice: “That’s
right,” and cheers.) And vet thev
call me yes-no. (Laughter.)
ALLIES OF THE CAUCUS.
2. If you are opposed to the
caucus, do not help the caucus
by voting for the Deakin Cabinet,
which is willing to do the work of
the caucus again if a chance is
offered.
FISCAL PEACE.
3. I ask you to let the present
protective tariff rest, adjusting
anomalies and hardships which
the reports of the Tariff Commis-
sion may bring to light. Person-
ally I favor the suggestion for a
referendum to the whole people,
in order that the lament-
able differences which divide
Liberals without dividing Social-
ists, may be settled.
BOOKKEEPING CLAUSE,
4. The bookkeeping clauses
should be ended. The case of
Western Australia can be equit-
ably provided for.
THE BRADDON CLAUSE.
5. The protection afforded by
the Braddon clause to the finan-
ces of the State should be per-
petually extended, but in a more
flexible form.
OLD-ACE PENSIONS.
6. The question of old-age pen-
sions could be settled at once, as
it ought to be, if Queensland,
South Australia, and Tasmania,
as I have pressed them to do,
would fall into line with the other
three States, which responded to
my appeal. In South Australia
arid Queensland there are Labor
Premiers. I regard a national
system of old-age pensions as one
of the essential features of Fed-
eral policy. (Hear, hear.)
PREFERENTIAL TRADE.
7. If the people of Great Brit-
ain change their minds, and be-
lieve a preferential arrangement
with Australia advisable, I would
meet their wishes by an equitable
arrangement. But I do not think
the people of the Mother-country
will ever agree to taxes on food,
and their horror of such taxes is
natural, and I think sensible, too.
(Applause.)
UNCONDITIONAL PREFER-
ENCE.
8. I support an unconditional
preference, offered by Australia
to the Mother-country, but if any
is offered it should not be a sham.
NATIONAL DEFENCE.
g. National defence I regard as
a matter of supreme importance;
but I do not favor universal and
compulsory military service.
(Hear, hear.) I would favor com


pulsory military drill in all pub-
lic schools, and especially encour-
age the cadet movement. I think
provision also for a continuous
system of military training for
some years after the boys leave
school most desirable. In that
way we will get nearest to univer-
sal training without universal
conscription. Encouragement of
volunteer forces open to the boys
when they become men should be
the leading feature of our mili-
tary system.
I thoroughly support efficiency
of equipment. The highest, grav-
est want of all, is a military chief
of acknowledged eminence in the
art of war, and experience
gained in commanding huge
bodies of troops in actual
warfare. (Cheers.) Acting on
the ignoble cry of “Aus-
tralia for Australians,” the
Government have put in the sup-
reme position an officer of high
standing and ability, and a per-
son of merit, but without either
of these vital qualifications. If
they did this in time of danger
they would deserve to be im-
peached for high treason. (Ap-
plause. )
COAST AND HARBOR
DEFENCES.
Coastal and harbor defence is,
I consider, even more vital than
military defence, because sudden
ocean raids are more likely dan-
gers than attempts at a perma-
nent landing. Whilst the British
fleet is, and must for a long time
to come, be our main line of naval
defence, we owe to the Empire, as
well as to ourselves, the duty of
laying the foundation of an effi-
cient system of port and coast de-
fences, an “inner line” of naval
defence, which is at present sadly
neglected. The presence of an
Australian navy on the high seas
is an affair of the future.
IMMIGRATION.
I regard immigration as the
greatest of our industrial and
national needs. Not re-inforce-
ments for our over-crowded cities,
but a stream of white agricultural
immigration. (Applause.) Farm-
ers if you like, but agri-
cultural laborers, too. The
laws against white immigrants
with definite employment before
them, which Mr. Deakin and Mr.
Watson defend, largely discount
all their professions on this sub-

more valuable result to the people

Without sacrificing the vital

New Guinea is a vast and popu-
lous territory, m which two great

duty to promote and encourage
white enterprise, and our duty to

shape. I supported it because of
the paramount importance of the
object in view. , New develop-
ments of agricultural enterprise

enterprise and pioneer settlement

tinent, are well worth trying.
Every precaution must, however,
be taken to avoid the disappoint-
ments, and prevent the abuses,

Northern territory must be fed-
eralised, civilised, and developed.
That is one of the greatest and
grandest tasks of the Common-
wealth. In that task beyond most
others there is room for boundless
enterprise, and only by such
means can Australia attain a de-
fensive position. It is here that
the objection to white immigrants
under engagement, and the per-
sistence by Mr. Deakin and Mr.
Watson in laws which hamper
them, become so astoundingly
bereft of the faintest glimmer of
statesmanship.
CAPITAL AND LABOR.
Compulsory arbitration in Aus-
tralia, so far, has not worked
well, for either employer or em-
ployed, in many cases. Peace
and harmony have certainly not
been established. One voluntary
agreement is worth a thousand
settlements by force. I would
like to see the compulsory pro-
cess of conciliation put more to

torian system. (Hear, hear.) Al-
though I submitted to the gener-
al sense of the House in the mat-
ter of preference to unionists,
with the rider attached, I am per-
sonally opposed most strongly to
any exercise of a power of prefer-
ence for one worker against an-
other, by a judge presiding over
a tribunal of justice. (Cheers.)
Any preference or advantage
unionists gain for themselves
they are entitled to, just as fully
as any merchant is entitled to his
profits; but I think the law should
stand neutral, and interfere with
no man’s right to earn his own
living, whether he be unionist or
non-unionist. (Prolonged ap-
plause.)
CLOSER SETTLEMENT.
Whilst no man believes more
strongly in the policy of closer
settlement than I do, or would
pursue a more vigorous policy of
breaking up large estates in
Australia than I would, I prefer
the first of the two methods em-
bodied in the “fighting platform”
of the Political Labor League of
New South Wales. In that plat-
form one of the planks is “Re-
sumption of land for closer set-
tlement,” the other is a progres-
sive land tax on all lands over
in value. The Federal
party has adopted the second. It
could not, if it would, adopt the
first, because the Federal authori-
ty could not resume lands for
closer settlement. What the La-
bor-Socialist Party cannot do di-
rectly it seeks to do by subter


fuge, and by an invasion of State
rights. (Hear, hear.) They have
no more legal right to cut up land
in a State by means of a tax than
they have by means of a survey-
or. Their project seeks to make
all land-holdings, however, small,
subject to the panics of a glutted
market, in order to nationalise
them, whether large or small,
which is the main object of their
socialistic creed. One of the ob-
vious advantages of the policy of
State resumption is that the State
can choose the best lands first.
Under the progressive tax, the
large estates would be reduced
on the basis of getting rid of the
worst land first. I believe in land
LAND VALUE TAXATION.
value taxation as a perfectly fair
principle. (Applause.) I carried
a land tax in New South Wales.
But land value taxation, and clos-
er settlement, and “bursting up
the large estates,” are all ques-
tions just as entirely within the
province of the State, and just as
foreign to the jurisdiction of
Federal politicians, as an attempt
to “burst up” the public schools,
or the public hospitals, would be.
There are two ways of carrying
out the great and beneficial work
of closer settlement—one by an
unconstitutional stratagem, the
other by the simple, honest, me-
thod of resuming and paying.
This course leaves land at its hon-
est value whether held in 50 acres
or 5000. The other method in-
volves all land values in chaos,
ripe for that socialistic proposal,
“nationalisation of land.” There

are a number of changes in the
navigation laws, which ought to

of the Labor Party is to estab-
lish a “ ring” of their own in the
Australian shipping trade, by put-
ting British ships under restric-
tions not yet attached to them.
This is also one of the aims of the

COMMERCIAL CODES.
Federal codes on the subject of
banking, trading corporations, in-
surance, bankruptcy, and all
other commercial matters includ-
ed in the Constitution, as an im-
portant part of the practical
benefits of Federation, to be real-
ised at an early date.
SOCIALISM.
I now come, ladies and gentle-
men, to the greatest of all the
Federal issues—Socialism. (Loud
cheers.) Shall the policy of
State Socialism be adopted as
the national policy, or shall it be
emphatically discarded and repu-
diated? This is no question of
using the powers of the Common-
wealth freely and fearlessly in
redressing wrongs and suppress-
ing abuses, or in advancing the
general welfare. That policy be-
gan and flourished in Australia
long before the Socialists were
ever heard of, and will continue
long after they have disappeared.
(Cheers.) The Socialism which
we will fight to the death is
not the use of the powers of the
State for the advancement of the
people, but an attempt to enable
the State to usurp the function
of private enterprise and to de-
stroy the industrial freedom of
the masses in order to make them
become servants of the State,
whilst taking all the risks of a
gigantic trading ' speculation
managed by official “bosses.”
The first demand of the
Socialists is, “nationalise mon-
opolies.” This issue really
raises the whole question. If
a tobacco monopoly, or a ship-
ping monopoly, or a sugar mono-
poly, is to be run by the Common-
wealth, why not nationalise all
other industries? The “object-
ive” of the Socialists clearly in


volves that course. It covers “all
producers,” therefore “all produc-
ing industries.” If, as they say,
capital is “exploiting” labor, I say
the State would “exploit” labor,
too, and with more effect. Priv-
ate enterprise pays all its own
losses, but the Socialistic State
would cast all the losses of its
stupendous undertakings on the
workers, who would, when the
scheme was complete, be the
only shareholders of “Australia
unlimited,” with a capital debt of
£1,000,000,000, and an interest
payment of £50,000,000 a year
to provide for —equal to about £1
a week out of the pocket of each
male worker—before the gigantic
monopoly began to make a penny
towards earning a bare sub-
sistence for the people, to
say nothing of profits. What
a mess the politicians—for
they are the State in its ac-
tive personality—have nearly al-
ways made of politics, for which
they are supposed to be specially
fitted! (A voice: “That’s right.”)
But our blunders in politics would
be fascinating, compared with
the horrible tangle we would get
the people into in trying to run all
the town and country industries
of Australia.
INDUSTRIAL DESPOTISM.
The first step essential to social-
ised industries would be the pro-
clamation of industrial despotism
—absolute suppression of private
enterprise absolute authority
in the bosses —absolute sub-
jection on the - part of the
men absolutism everywhere!
The workers would have to
go where ordered, do what
they were told, and take what
they were paid! (Hear, hear.)
At present they shift their politi-
cal masters, then their mas-
ters (that is, the State; that is,
the “bosses”) would shift them!
MERIT OR EQUALITY?
Are the socialised workers to be
paid according to merit? (A cry:
"No.”) That would mean an im-
mensely costly audit, and univer-
sal discontent. (Hear, hear.)
Are they to be paid the
same all round? That would
amount to a gigantic “exploita-
tion” of labor on the part of the
State, the weak and lazy enjoying
dividends equal to those earned
by the strong, the capable, and
the industrious. Again, univer-
sal discontent. The horrors and
miseries of that Socialistic ex-
periment in Paraguay would
spread over the whole continent.
“Individualism” and “competition”
instead of being suppressed,
would assert themselves in far
more unlovely and disastrous
forms than ever, because there
would be only one ladder of ambi-
tion left, at the foot of which a
million of male workers would
scramble for the best Government
billet. The terms “ capital” and
“capitalist” cover more than
money. They include the few
who have much money, the many
who have some, and all who have
none at all. The brains of a man,
his physical strength, his frugal,
indomitable spirit, all these are
forms of “capital,” and all the
men possessing them are “capital-
ists.” Almost every successful
man in Australia began life with
no otfter capital. These qualities
were translated by arduous labor
and enterprise into money, just
as the qualities of some other
men translate themselves into
failure and self-indulgence. In
seeking to destroy the motives
which make men “ capitalists,”
you seek to destroy the motives
which make men, and nations of
men, successful. You do more.
You sound the death-knell of per-
sonal liberty as well as contract
the opportunities of personal am-
bition. The State industrial be-
comes one of a vast army. He
is an elector, one day in three
years —he is a shareholder —when
calls have to be made—but a free
agent, no, and never. A paren-
tal authority far from divine sur-
rounds him, from which there is
no escape, either in youth, man-
hood, or old age. To-day the
Australian people are the masters
of the State. Then, the State
would become the immovable,
eternal master of the people.
These socialistic schemes have


been tried everywhere, and have
failed everywhere. They were
conceived more than 2000 years
ago, and have never since then
won the endorsement of a single
statesman in any country. They
transform the relations of hu-
man life and fetter human initia-
tive at every point. They really
require the re-creation of human-
ity; for force cannot reform the
human soul. Love may, self-sac-
rifice may, but force never.
(Cheers.) In place of all these
mad, disastrous schemes, I have
a few simple suggestions to offer.
If labor does not get its honest
share in the great work of pro-
duction, see that it does get jus-
tice. If monopolies become a
nuisance or an injury, regulate or
suppress them. But do not en-
slave all because some do wrong.
Do not force industrial fetters on
all because some are weak, or lag
behind. Relieve the industrial
cripples by some other methods
than that of breeding a nation of
industrial conscripts.
NOT AN ELECTION CRY.
Ladies and Gentlemen, —I have
fully opened my mind to you upon
all the great questions of the
day. Although I have criticised
the present Administration, as I
thought it' my duty to do, I be-
lieve most of its members, and
nearly all its adherents, will soon
realise that I have not manufac-
tured an election cry, but have
discovered a real and increasing
national danger, which must
some day compel all Liberals,
whether in one camp or the other,
to bur}' their grievances and their
differences, and rally their forces
to free Parliament from the dom-
ination of the secret caucus, and
to defend the industrial and poli-
tical liberty of Australia from the
attack of Socialism. (Loud
cheers.) Last night, at Red-
fern, the innate ferocity of
the socialistic tiger displayed
itself. The right of public
meeting, the right of free
speech, the common fairness of
allowing me, as one political lead-
er, to reply to Mr. Watson, an-
other political leader, on a public
platform—all these were out-
raged; and considerations which
appeal to every civilised intelli-
gence and to the most rudiment-
ary instinct of political liberty,
were deliberately and persistent-
ly trampled under foot. The tiger
cub of Australian Socialism in in-
deed beginning to feel its claws
and-to show its teeth.
I close this manifesto with the
memorable words of the present
Prime Minister, Mr. Deakin, when
he and I stood side by side in the
political arena:
“ Instead, therefore, of taking the downward
path that would lead to political servitude,
and perhaps to social slavery, we want to rally
to our flag those in favor of responsible 'go-
vernment, to restore majority rule, and to
maintain that priceless heritage which our
forefathers have handed down to us. and
which we should preserve or perish.” (Loud
and prolonged applause)


Australia’s Nine Greatest Needs.
Mr. Reid indicates the Nine Greatest Needs of
Australia as follows
1. The rescue of national politics from the influence of class feeling
and personal selfishness.
2. The restoration of majority rule and parliamentary government.
3. The overthrow of the secret political caucus which has captured
the Federal Government and Federal Parliament.
4. The cessation of hostilities and the establishment of a spirit of
mutual fairness between employers and trades-unions and all other
workers in the Commonwealth.
5. White agricultural immigration the necessity of a white Australia.
6. Systems of public instructions that teach those who can read and
write something that is even more important—how to become skilled
workers on the plains, in factories, and in the mines of Australia; and
beyond that how to become enlightened men and women up to the
highest range of their mental capacities.
7. Agricultural settlement and scientific development of rural
industries.
8. Honest electoral boundaries.
9. Pure and efficient electoral rolls, and, better still, electors who
value the vote they are entitled to.
Australia’s Nine Greatest Evils.
Mr. Reid sums up Australia’s Greatest Evils.
1. Six overcrowded capitals in six sparsely-settled States.
2. The ascendency of a close corporation in politics—the Socialist
Labour Party —based on political and industrial privilege, gained for
some workers at the expense of others.
• 8. A socialist movement that aims at the regeneration of
humanity, not by Christian methods of love and self-sacrifice, but by
the dismal sway of State compulsion, preceded by a war of classes, and
the destruction of private enterprise and industrial liberty.
4. The use of a noble, democratic name —that of labour—in
support of the socialistic movement, inspired by hatred of personal
liberty, which it denounces under the name of competition and indi-
vidualism ; the attempts socialists are making to represent the capi-
talised labour of the frugal and industrious as the robbery erf the
frugal and industrious.
5. The substitution by the labour leagues of Australia of the
socialistic ideal of compulsion for the democratic ideal of liberty.
6. The attempt of Australian socialists to replace the democratic
principle that the people are masters of the State by the socialistic
principle that the State should be master of the people.
7. The disgusting selfishness of those who would rather help the
cause they denounce as a national danger than renounce the faint
prospect of personal advantage by means of a higher tariff.
8. The desperate and deplorable position of the present Govern-
ment, who are anti-socialists to a man, but prefer to suppress their
views, and remain in office as servants of socialists.
9. The attempt the Deakin Government and the socialist party
in alliance are making to deprive the anti-socialist forces of Australia
of a magnificent triumph by means of a flank movement for a high
tariff, which endangers the forces of the anti-socialists, and adds to
the powers of the socialistic fiscal-atheist party.
