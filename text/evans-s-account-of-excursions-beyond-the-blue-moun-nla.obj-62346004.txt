A RT * XXII. Evans?s Account of Excursions beyond the
Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
Xn the year 1813 and beginning of 1814, Mr. George William
E v ans, Deputy Surveyor of Lands at Sydney, for the first time
explored a considerable extent of country to the westward of
the Blue Mountains. The tract of land hitherto occupied by
the colonists of N. S. Wales is very limited, extending along
the eastern coast to the north and south of Port Jackson only
80 miles, and westward, about 40 miles to the foot of the chain of
mountains in the interior, which form the western boundary: it
is singular that in the twenty-five years, which the colony has
been established no one of the settlement had been induced to
explore the passage over these mountains. Two attempts were
formerly made, one by Mr. Bass, and the other by Mr. Caley,
both of which failed. The first passage over the most difficult
and rugged part of these mountains was effected by Messrs.
Blanlandj Wentworth, and Lawson. The present Governor

Mac Quarrie, soon after his arrival at the colony, availing himself
of the facilities afforded by the discoveiies of these three gentle-
men, determined to encourage the attempt to find a passage to
the western country, and in Nov. 1813, Mr. Evans was entrusted
with the accomplishment of this object. The result of this
journey has been long before the public. The favourable ac-
count of this gentleman induced the governor to cause a road
to be constructed for the passage and conveyance of cattle and
provisions to the interior; this road, after great exertions and
labour, was completed, under the directions of William Cox,
Esq. and on the 25th of April 1815, the Governor and his suite
commenced an excursion over the Blue Mountains by the new
road. The early part of the journey was found to present fewer
difficulties than were expected. At a distance, however, of about
twenty miles the country changes, being rocky and moun-
tainous, and extremely rugged. The views on the summit of
the western mountains, are described as very beautiful, and
the scenery of the glens and passes are very grand and romantic.
Fifty six miles in the interior, two streams unite in a valley,
forming a river, called by the Governor, Cox?s river, which
empties itself into the river Nepean, and it is conjectured from
the nature of the country through which it passes that it iqust
be one of the principal causes of the floods which have been
occasionally felt on the banks of the Hawkesbury, into which
the Nepean discharges itself. Westward of Cox?s river the
country becomes hilly, but is generally open forest land, and
good pasturage : a range of lofty hills and narrow vallies alter-
nately form the country from Cox?s river to Fish river. A
distance of l 6 miles from thence to Sidraouth valley the
country continues hilly, affording good pasturage; at the valley,
the land is level and for the first time unincumbered with trees;
the country is agaiu hilly to Campbell?s river (13 miles), when it
exhibits an open and extensive view of rising grounds and fertile
plains. Judging from the height of the banks, this river must
be on some occasions of very considerable magnitude, but the
great drought which had prevailed at the time of the Governor?s
excursion for the three preceding years, had reduced the river so
that it then had the appearance of a chain of ponds; the soil on


in New South Wales.
its banks was very rich. Seven miles from the bridge over
Campbell?s river, Bathurst plains open to the view, presenting a
rich tract of eleven miles in length, bounded by rising hills
thinly wooded. The Mac Quarrie river, which is formed by the
fountain of the Fish and Campbell rivers, takes a winding course
through the plains. On the twelfth day the Governor ar-
rived at these plains (14-0 miles distant from Sydney,) and
remained a week, making excursions in the surrounding country,
and whilst there, fixed on a site for the erection of a town
(Bathurst) at a future period. The excursions whilst at Bathurst
did not exceed 22 miles in aS. W. direction. The country was
found generally fertile and well adapted to the purposes of
agriculture ; within ten miles of Bathurst there are not less than
50,000 acres of land clear of timber, one half of which, at least,
is excellent soil. The timber to the westward is inferior to
that of the northern colony. Coal and lime-stone were disco-
vered ; game and fish abundant. The foregoing account of the
Governor?s excursion reached this country some time since;
but the Governor, whilst at Bathurst, desirous to make further
discoveries of the country to the west, instructed Mr. Evans
to proceed, and pursue his discoveries as far westward as
the means of carrying provisions and the nature of the
country would permit. The result of this excursion by Mr.
Evans has very lately reached this country; and the following
is a brief account extracted from the
Journal of that Gentleman.
On the 13th of May, 1815, Mr. Evans commenced his tour
of discovery, and on the 2d of June, finding his provisions
would not enable him to proceed further, he began to retrace
his course back to Bathurst, where he arrived on the 12th,
having been absent thirty-one days. In the course of this tour
he travelled over a vast number of rich and fertile vallies,
with successions of hills well covered with good timber, chiefly
the stringy bark and the pine, and the whole country abound-
ing with ponds and gullies of fine water; he also fell in with
a large river, which he conceives would become navigable for
boats at the distance of a few days travelling along its banks:


4.56 Evans?s Excursion beyond the Blue Mountains
from its course he conjectures that it must join its waters
with those of the Mac Quarrie river ; and little doubt, it is
observed, can he entertained, that their joint streams must form a
navigable river of very considerable size. At a distance of about
sixty miles from Bathurst, Mr. Evans discovered a number of
hills, the points of which ended in perpendicular heads, from
thirty to forty feet high, of pure lime-stone of a misty gray
colour.?At this place, and also throughout the general course
of the journey, kangaroos, emues, ducks, &c. were seen in
great numbers, and the new river, to which Air. Evans gave
the name of the Lachlan , abounds with fish. In the course of
this tour, Mr. Evans also discovered a substance which he
describes as possessing much of the sweetness and flavour of
manna, but totally different in its appearance, being very
white, and having a roundish irregular surface, not unlike the
rough outside of confectioner?s comfits, and of the size of the
largest hail-stone. Where this substance was found most
plentiful, kangaroos were seen, in immense flocks, and wild
fowl equally abundant.
The natives appeared more numerous than at Bathurst;
but so very wild, and apparently so much alarmed at the sight
of white men, that he could not induce them to come near,
or to hold any intercourse whatever with him.
At the termination of the tour, Mr. Evans saw a good level
country, of a most interesting appearance, and a very rich
soil ; and conceives that there is no barrier to prevent the
travelling farther westward to almost any extent that could
be desired. He states that the distance travelled by him on
this occasion, was 142 measured out miles; which, with digres-
sions to the souihwa\ made the total distance 155 miles from
Bathurst :?He addsfnt tSe same time, that having taken a
more direct line back to Bathurst than that by which he left it, he
made the distance then only 115 miles* and observes, that a
* The exact course taken by Mr. Evans is not very distinctly
stated r plans, however, of the route, both of the Governor and
Mr, Evans, have been forwarded to the office of the Secretary of
the Colonial Department, which we hope at a future period we
may be able to lay before our readers.

good road may be made all that length without any consider-
able difficulty, there not being more than three hills which
may not be avoided.
From the entire tenor of Mr. Evans?s narrative, it appears
that the country over which he passed has even exceeded the
country leading to and surrounding; Bathurst, in richness
fertility, and all the other valuable objects for the sustenance
of a numerous population. To the foregoing account, the
Governor had added some particulars omitted in his own tour.
When he ai rived at Bathurst, he found there three native
men and six children, standing with a working party: they
appeared much alarmed, particularly at the horses?but this
soon ceased, and they became quite familiar. Frequently during
the stay at Bathurst, small parties of men and boys came in.
They were in appearance very like those of Sydney, though
rathei better looking and stronger made ; some of them were
blind of one eye, though not always on the same side.?Their
language being altogether dissimilar to that of the natives of
Sydney, it was impossible to learn whether their being thus
blinded was the result of any established custom, or accidental.
These men were covered with skins of different animals,
neatly sewed together, and wore the fur side inwards; on
the outer, or skin side, they had curious devices wrought.
They seemed to be perfectly harmless and inoffensive, and by
no means warlike or savage, few of them having any weapons
whatever with them, but merely a stone axe, which they use
for cutting steps for themselves to climb up trees by, in pur-
suit of the little animals which they live upon.
These natives never brought any of their females with them
on their visits to Bathurst.
