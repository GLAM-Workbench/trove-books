The First Nowell.
When a poor man came in sight,
Gathering 1 winter fuel.
The next good joy that Mary had,
It was the joy of three ;
To see her own son, Jesus Christ
Making the blind to see.
Making the blind to see, good Loud,
And happy, &c.

fHE first Nowell the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields
as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter?s night that was so deep.
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell,
Born is the King of Israel.
Tenor solo? II
? Blither, page, and stand by me,
If thou know?st it, telling,
Yonder peasant, who is he ?
Where and what his dwelling??
Treble solo
The next good joy that Mary had,
It was the joy of four ;
To see her own son, Jesus Cueist,
Reading the Bible o?er.
Reading the Bible o?er, good Lord,
And happy, &c.
V
The next good joy that Mary had,
It was the joy of five ;
To see her own son, Jesus Christ,
Raising the dead to life.
Raising the dead to life, good Lord,
And happy, &e.

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.
Nowell, &c.
? Hre, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain ;
Bight against the forest fence,
By Saint Agnes? fountain.?
Tenor, solo? 111
And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far ;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Nowell, &c.
? Bring me flesh and bring me wine,
Bring me pine logs hither ;
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear them thither.?
Chorus ?
Page and Monarch, forth they went,
Forth they went together ;
Through the rude wind?s wild lament
And the bitter weather.
This star drew nigh to the north-west,
O?er Bethlehem it took it?s rest;
And there it did both stop and stay
Right over the place where Jesus lay.
Nowell, &c.
The next good joy that Mary had,
It was the joy of six ;
To see her own son, Jesus Christ,
Upon the crucifix ;
Upon the crucifix, good Lord,
And happy, &c.
VI!
The next good joy that Mary had,
It was the joy of seven ;
To see her own son, Jesus Christ,
Ascending into heaven.
Ascending into heaven, good Lord,
And happy, &c.
Treble solo? IV.
? Sire, the night is darker now,
And the wind blows stronger ;
Fails my heart, I know not how,
I can go no longer.?
Tenor solo?
Then entered in those wise men three,
Full reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in His presence
Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.
Nowell, &c.
? Mark my footsteps, good my page ;
Tread thou in them boldly ;
Thou shalt find the winter?s rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.?
Then let us all with one accord
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made heaven and earl h of nought,
And with His blood mankind hath bought.
Nowell, &c.
Chorus? V.
In the master?s steps he trod.
Where the snow lay dinted ;
Heat was in the very sod
Which the saint had printed.
Therefore Christian men, be suro.
Wealth or rank possessing,
Ye who now will bless the poor,
Shall yourselves find blessing.
Come ye Lofty*
tOME ye lofty, come ye lowly,
Let your songs of gladness ring;
In a stable lies the Holy, , *
In a manger rests tog King :
See in Mary?s anijs reposing
Christ by highest Heaven adored ;
Oom*�, your circle round him closing,
Pious hearts that love the Lord.
3 A Child This Day Is Born.
Jfe Child this day is born,
iLI, A Child of high renowu ;
Most worthy of a sceptre,
A sceptre and a crown.
Glad tidings to all men,
Glad tidings sing we may,
Because the King of Kings
Was born on Christmas Hay.
6 Waken, Christian Children.
Come ye poor, no pomp of station
Robes the Child your hearts adore :
He, the Loed of all salvation,
Shares your want is weak and poor;
Oxen round about behold them ;
Rafters naked, cold, andifcre,
See the shepherds, God has?told them
That the PeinSe of Life lies there.
I|S{�AKEN, Christian Children,
lyjlf Up and let us sing
With glad voices, the praises
Of our new-born King.
These tidings shepherds heard
Whilst watching o?er their fold;
?Twas by an angel unto them
That night revealed and told
Glad tidings, &c.
Up, ?(is meet to welcome
With a joyous lay
Christ, the King of Glory,
Born for us to-day.
Then was there with the angel
An host incontinent
Of heavenly bright soldiers
All from the Highest sent.
Glad tidings, &c.
Come ye children blithe and merry,
This one Child' your model make ;
Christmas holly, leaf, and berry,
All be prized for His dear sake;
Come ye gentle hearts and tender,
Come ye spirits keen and bold ;
All in all your homage render,
Weak and mighty, young and old.
Come, nor fear to seek him
Children though we be;
Once he said of children
? Let them come to me.?
They praised the Loed our God,
And our celestial King;
All glory be in Paradise,
This heavenly host do sing.
Glad tidings, &c.
In a manger lowly
Sleeps the heavenly Child,
O'er Him fondly bendeth
Mary, mother mild.
High above a star is shining,
And the wise men haste from far:
Come glad hearts, and spirits pining?-
For you all has risen the Star.
Let us bring our poor oblations.
Thanks and love, and, faith and praise
Gome ye people, ye nations,
All in all draw nigh to gaze.
All glory be to God
That sitteth still on high.
With praises and with triumph great
And joyful m^-^y.
Glad tmffigs, &o.
Far above that stable,
Up in heaven so high,
One bright star outshinoth,
Watching silently.
Fear not then to enter,
Though we cannot bring
Gold, or myrrh, or incense,
Fitting for a King.
3 The Seven Joys of Mary.
I
fHE first good joy that Mary had,
It was the joy of one ;
To see the blessed Jesus Christ
When He was first her son. *
When He was first her son, good Lord,
And happy may we be,
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
To all eternity.
II
The next good joy that Mary had
It was the joy of two ;
To see her own son, Jesus Cheist
Making the lame to go.
Making the lame to go, good Lord,
And happy, &o.
Hark the Heaven of heavens is ringing :
Cheist the Loed to man is born 1
Are not all our hearts too singing,
Welcome, welcome, Christmas morn ?
Still the Child all power possessing,
Smiles as through the ages past;
And the song of Christmas blessing
Sweetly sinks to rest at last.
Gifts, he asketh riches,
Offerings costlier still,
Yet may Christian children
Bring them if they will.
Brighter than all jewels
Shines the modest eye ;
Best of gifts he loveth
Infant purity.
5 Good King Wenceslas.
CHOEUS ? r
�OOD King Wenceslas looked out,
On the FeUjit of Stephen,
W hen the snow lay round about,
Deep and crisp and even;
Brightly shone the moon that night,
Haste we then to welcome,
With a joyous lay,
Christ, the King of Glory,
Though the frost was cruel,
Born for us to-day.
