NATIONAL ANTHEM
(BAND ACCOMPANIMENT.)
God save our gracious Queen,
Long live our noble Queen,
God save the Queen ;
Send her victorious,
Happy and glorious,
Long to reign over us :
God save the Queen.
O Lord, our God, arise,
Scatter her enemies,
And make them fall;
Confound their politics,
Frustrate their knavish tricks;
On Thee our hearts we fix :
God save the Queen.
Thy choicest gifts in store
On her be pleased to pour,
Long may she reign ;
May she defend our laws,
And ever give us cause
To sing, with heart and voice,
“God Save the Queen.”


PSALM
To BE SUNG.
PSALM XLII.
Quemadmodum.
Like as the hart desireth the water-brooks : so longeth
my soul after thee, O God.
2. My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living
God: when shall I come to appear before the presence of
God?
3. My tears have been my meat day and night: while
they daily say unto me, Where is now thy God?
4. Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart
by myself: for I went with the multitude, and brought
them forth into the house of God;
5. In the voice of praise and thanksgiving : among such
as keep holy-day.
6. Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul: and
why art thou so disquieted within me?
7. Put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks
for the help of his countenance.
8. My God, my soul is vexed within me: therefore
will I remember thee concerning the land of Jordan, and
the little hill of Hermon.
9. One deep calleth another, because of the noise of
the water-pipes: all thy waves and storms are gone over
me.
10. The Lord hath granted his loving-kindness in the
day-time : and in the night season did I sing of him, and
made my prayer unto the God of my life.
11. I will say unto the God of my strength, Why hast
thou forgotten me: why go I thus heavily, while the
enemy oppresseth me ?
12. My bones are smitten asunder as with a sword:
while mine enemies that trouble me cast me in the teeth;


13. Namely, while they say daily unto me: Where is
now thy God ?
14. Why art thou so vexed, Omy soul: and why art
thou so disquieted within me ?
15. O put thy trust in God: for I will yet thank him,
which is the help of my countenance, and my God.
LESSON.
ACTS, CHAPTER X, VERSES 1 TO 8
TO BE SUNG
THE NUNC PIMITTIS
LoRD, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace:
according to thy word.
For mine eyes have seen : thy salvation,
Which thou hast prepared : before the face of all people ;
To be a light to lighten the Gentiles : and to be the glory
of thy people Israel.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son : and to the Holy
Ghost;
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be :
world without end. Amen.


FIRST HYMN
TO BE SUNG BEFORE SERMON. (BAND ACCOMPANIMENT.)
“ 0 be joyful in the Lord , all ye Lands."
f All people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice ;
Him serve with fear, His praise forth tell,
Come ye before Him, and rejoice.
mf The Lord, ye know, is God indeed;
Without our aid he did us make :
We are His flock, He doth us feed,
And for his sheep He doth us take.
f O enter then His gates with praise,
Approach with joy His courts unto ;
Praise, laud, and bless his name always,
For it is seemly so to do.
mf For why? the Lord our God is good;
His mercy is for ever sure :
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure.
ff To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
The God Whom Heav’n and earth adore,
From men and from the Angel-host
Be praise and glory evermore. Amen.
SERMON

SENIOR CHAPLAIN THE REV. J. STANLEY LOW, R.D.
Collection in aid of the funds of the United Service
Home for Old Sailors and Soldiers,


SECOND HYMN
AFRER SERMON (BAND ACCOMPANIMENT.)
“Be strong and of a good courage. . . . And the Lord, He it is
that doth go before thee.”
([)NWARD, Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
With the Cross of Jesus
Going on before.
Christ the Royal Master
Leads against the foe;
Forward into battle,
See, His banners go !
Onward, Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
With the Cross of Jesus
Going on before.
2. At the sign of triumph
Satan’s host doth flee;
On then, Christian soldiers,
On to victory.
Hell’s foundations quiver
At the shout of praise;
Brothers, lift your voices,
Loud your anthems raise.
Onward, &c.
3. Like a mighty army
Moves the Church of God;
Brothers, we are treading
Where the Saints have trod;
We are not divided,
All one body we,
One in hope and doctrine,
One in charity.
Onward, &c.


4- Onward, then, ye people,
Join our happy throng,
Blend with ours your voices
In the triumph song;
Glory, laud, and honour
Unto Christ the King,
This through countless ages
Men and Angels sing.
Onward, &c. Amen.
BENEDICTION.
