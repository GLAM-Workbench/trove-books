My Lord, —I cannot but be touched by the
explanation which your Lordship has given me
of the motives which have induced my young
friends of the Church of England Sunday Schools,
in the Dioceses of Sydney and Goulburn, to
present me with a sible anb ISook til it oinin o u
jihajjtt ; and I the more heartily thank the
givers, and have the more pleasure in accepting
their gift, that I understand it to be an expression
of their loyal attachment to Her Majesty, as
well as of affectionate good-will for myself.
I can assure your Lordship that when I have
the honor of shewing to the Queen the many tokens
of loyalty and affection which I have received
during my visit to the Australian Colonies, none
will please Her Majesty more than this gift from
the children of her Church of England subjects
in these two dioceses.
Alfred,
To the Lord Bishop of Sydney.
