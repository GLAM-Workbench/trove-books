A comprehensive view
OF THE LATE AND PRESENT
COURT FEES AND ATTORNEYS? CHARGES.
It is with considerable regret we feel ourselves forced to address
the public on the subject of the remuneration to be awarded us, as
Practitioners of the Supreme Court, for our services therein, and
the inadequacy of that remuneration, in the present state of the
Colony 5 but the questions that have been agitated in the Legislative
Council during its late sittings, with reference to the Petition of
the Attorneys, on the subject of their charges ?the address of the
Council to the late Lieutenant-Governor in favor of such Petition,
and the steps adopted by His Excellency, notwithstanding the
recommendation contained in such address, coupled with the
observations of the Acting Chief Justice, in his letter to the
Colonial Secretary of the 21st March, 1854 (a copy of which
letter is appended hereto), render it absolutely necessary that we
should put the public fully in possession of the circumstances
under which we appealed to the Council, and the grounds of the
appeal itself.
The question of professional remuneration is one which closely
concerns the public, and we feel assured that, if they will follow
us through the short details we are about to lay before them, they
will admit that our objections to the present scale of costs are well
founded, and that the alterations asked for were required, in order
(to use the language of His Honor in the letter to which we have
alluded) that justice might be done ?to those who pay, as well as
those who receive costs.?
We had reasonably expected that the subject of professional
remuneration would have been adjusted by the Judges of the
Colony with a due regard to the interests of all parties.
Their position was a sufficient guarantee that any scale suggested
nr ordered by them would not, as regards the public, be dis-
proportionate to the expense and labor involved, and the concurrent
circumstances of the times; and the thorough acquaintance which
it is but reasonable to expect they would have with the difficulties


of our position, justified us in expecting from them (if not out of
regard to the welfare of the practitioners, at least from an anxiety
for the dignity of the profession) the allowance of such a scale of
charges as would have enabled us, whilst discharging our duty to
our clients, to receive for our labor a compensation equivalent to
that obtained by the exercise of other professions, and commensurate
with the outlay involved in a legal education and attendant upon
the maintenance of a respectabie social position; that our expec-
tations have not been realized, the publication of this statement
is sufficient proof.
Intimately connected with (in fact involved in) the present
question, is the statement, before alluded to, of His Honor
the Acting Chief Justice, contained in his letter to the
Colonial Secretary on the subject of the Attorneys? charges.
This letter, which wears the appearance of a desire to earn
popularity at the expense of our profession, contained a statement
so diametically opposed to the conviction of the Attorneys that
they considered themselves called on, at once, to express publicly
their dissent therefrom, and accordingly the following letter was
published in both the daily j ournals:
THE SUPREME COURT EULES.
To the Editor of the Argus ? Herald.
Melbourne, 12th April, 1854.
Sir, ?In the letter addressed by the Acting Chief Justice to
the Colonial Secretary, accompanying the assent of the Judges
to an increase of fifty per cent, to the charges to be allowed to the
Attorneys, occur the following passages:?
? You state in your letter that it has been collected from the
debate in the Legislative Council, that the reason actuating the
House was, that while the Court fees were increased, the Attorneys?
charges were not proportionately augmented.?
? I may be allowed to justify the act of the Judges by respect-
fully assuring His Excellency that the Honorable House must
have been misinformed, if moved on such grounds.?
We, the undersigned Attorneys of the Supreme Court, hereby
avow that the House was moved upon the above-mentioned grounds
(amongst others), and express our conviction that the House was
not misinformed.


We are at present engaged in compiling a statement, supported
t>y figures, which we intend laying before the public, and which
we believe will fully justify the conviction above expressed.
We are, Sir,
&c., &c., &c.
Our first step then will be to prove?
That, by the new rules, the Court fees are increased.
Our second-
That the Attorneys? charges are not proportionately augmented.
And our
That the present remuneration to practitioners is not by any
means adequate to the value of their services.
The first two will be best accomplished by placing the old and
new scales themselves, in both instances (fees and charges), so far
as they correspond, in juxta position, and then by shewing their
actual working in six actions, taken from amongst a large number,
as a fair criterion of the whole.
The following Table, as appended to His Honor?s letter, shows
at a glance the difference between the old scale of Court fees, as
drawn up by Chief Justice A?Beckett in the year 1846, and the
present scale, drawn to meet the exigencies of the year 1854.

to publish, with our remarks thereon.


NOTES.
REMARKS
To Note 1. Wo do not find
the item of �1 ss. or �1 2s. in
1. The Great Seal of Court
is affixed only to Commissions,
Writs of ?Ne Exeat,? Injunc- the Scale published in Sir Wil-
tion, and other documents of liam A?Beckett?s rules ; the fee
' - ? -i w ? n
similar importance. The fee
originally payable was �1 55.,
reduced to �1 2s. It is apparent
that a larger fee should be paid
for the use of this seal, kept by
the directions of 15 Yict. No. 10,
Section IX. ?in the custody of
the Chief Justice,? than for that
of the ordinary seals or stamps.
However, the fee is reduced �lO
per cent.
2. The charge for sealing Writ
of Summons, and alias and
plurias Writs, was graduated ac-
cording to the sum sought to
be recovered, which graduation
ceased at a certain sum (�500).
The reason for this is not ob-
vious, as, if that plan were un-
exceptionable, the costs should
have been systematically carried
through, on that relative scale,
to the termination of the suit.
The present arrangement equal-
izes the charge.
3. This fee has been increased
in order to restrain, if possible,
the unnecessary and reprehensi-
ble practice of annexing unim-
portant documents at a heavy
expense to the suitor.
there set down is only ss. in all
instances.
To Note 3. We beg respect-
fully to question the efficacy of
the plan adopted, and to dissent,
in toto, from the inference to be
drawn from His Honor?s note.
In the first place, we cannot see
how imposing an additional six-
pence will lessen the expense to
the suitor; and in the second
place, the practice of attaching
original documents to the affida-
vit, instead of setting it out in
the body thereof, has the distinct
effect of lessening, not increas-
ing, expense. If the document
attached be unimportant, we
conceive it would be more con-
sistent with economy to order
the taxing officer to disallow any
charge in respect thereto, than


4. The sum previously paid
was too low, and that now charged
may be considered inadequate,
hut the number of recognizances,
entered into in the Supreme
Court, is small.
5. Here there is a reduction
of �75 per cent. The former
charge was immoderate.
6. The increase here of Is.
is justifiable, on two distinct
to impose sixpence additional a$
a penalty in the shape of Court
ee.
To Note 4. This charge (even
in old times) has always been
considered by the profession un-
called-for and oppressive.
To Note 5. We fully coincide
with the reduction made herein.
To Note 6. We have yet to
learn the illustration of the latter
grounds. Ist. A vast number of part of His Honor?s note, not
Orders, of a purely technical and being aware of any such new and
valueless description, is swept
away at a loss to the revenue,
and a new class of highly im-
portant orders brought into ex-
istence, for which a higher charge
than that formerly imposed
should be made.
7. The charge, originally pay-
able in this Court, was 2} per
cent., abolished in Actions at
Law, though not in Equity, and
the item is more easily defended
than any other, as the trouble
and responsibility imposed upon
the officers of the Court are
greater in this instance than in
any othpr.
8. The charge hitherto made
is too? low; the altered circum-
stances of the country being
taken into consideration.
> 9. The former charge was con-
sidered too low.
10. The same reason is given
for this alteration.
important orders.
To Note 7. It is to be pre-
sumed that the Legislative Coun-
cil, in fixing the salary of the
Prothonotary, considered the
responsibility of his office, and
remunerated him accordingly.
Further, we cannot see what his
trouble and responsibility have
to do with the charge, as not one
penny of the per centage goes to
him. In England, the fee never
exceeds �1 for any amount.
remarks made in To Note 11. We may mention
Note 2 apply here; in addition here that any additional dis-
.? * ma y be observed, patch in the recovery of these
a the Prothonotary may now debts, is fully (if not more than)
compute principal and interest, counterbalanced by the delay en-
m undefended actions, not only tailed under the New Rules, in
on bills and notes, but on undisputed and undefended ac-
c eques on any absolute order tions on open accounts, which


for the payment of money?on formerly could he concluded (in
any agreement, indenture, bond,
or covenant for the payment of,
or to recover, any sum certain,
payable on demand or on a fixed
day, without any condition ; so
that a large class of cases will
now be disposed of, in the first
instance, upon which in former
times, several Court fees now
abolished were payable.
12 and 13. See notes 9 and
10.
14. The charge is now made
for an Affidavit containing 90,
instead of 72 words.
15. Any number of ? names?
may be inserted in a Subpoena
now; formerly only three could
appear.
16. For this item there is no
analogous charge in the pre-
viously existing scale. Several
were formerly paid, now abo-
debt) as rapidly as actions on
Bills of Exchange, but must now
wait their turn with defended
actions, to have the amount due
settled by a jury ; involving
thus, heavy Court fees, which
were formerly avoided, as well
as very vexatious delay.
To Note 14. His Honor for-
got this theory in providing for
the Attorney?s charges for Draw-
ing and Engrossing. Even un-
der the increased fee here set
forth, the Attorneys have gener-
ally to send their own clerks to
make the copies, and pay the
fee as if the Court clerks made
them. We believe it will be
found, that if the clerks in the
Prothonotary?s office were paid
? per folio,? they could not earn
their salaries in office hours.
To Note 15. The explanation
given for the increase from the
former charge of 2s. 6d. (omitted
in His Honor?s scale) to 7s. 6d.,
is only applicable where all the
witnesses reside close to each
other. It is necessary to pro-
duce the original subpoena to
each witness ; consequently,
where they reside at a distance
from each other, concurrent
(duplicate) writs must be issued.
For these duplicates the fee of
2s. 6d. each is charged (the
former price of all writs), in ad-
dition to the 7s. 6d. on the first
original. It can be easily seen
how, under this arrangement, the
fees on subpoenas will be rather
increased than diminished.

altogether insufficient; and as
none hut general demurers will

ment, the action may he termin-

20. This is a far more just To Note 20. It is when the
charge than that formerly in use amount of the hill is in itself
at law. In Equity, the charge heavy, that every addition is
was always 2 per cent. There severely felt. And now, as the
is hut one fee for completing the hill rises in amount, so the fee

To Notes 25 and 26. His
Honor does not consider it at all

By the above table it will he seen that the taxation which the
Judges deem it expedient to levy upon the litigating public for
the support of the Court and its officers, in these expensive times,
is, in some instances, trebled, and in most?(and those of most
frequent occurrence) ?doubled.

It is worthy of remark, in respect to those Court fees, that the
fees for administering affidavits (not noticed in the above scale)
which would go to benefit private commissioners, and not the
coffers of the Court, have not been augmented.
We now proceed to shew the effect of the old and new scales
in their actual working. For this purpose, we have taken
indiscriminately, six bills of costs taxed under the old scale, and,
assuming similar actions to be brought under the new rules,
we find the following to be the result, as to the Court fees, under
the two scales.
(Table Wo. 2.)

In all the tables the same fees to counsel have been adopted
for both scales, to make as little deviation as possible from the
actual taxed bills. Of late, however, the barristers? fees have
been (by a resolution of the Bar) increased to an average of double
the old scale. This alteration, while raising the present costs of
action to an amount equal to, if not higher than that formerly
paid, serves to augment still further the Court fees payaole for
taxation, as shewn in the first table.
It will thus be seen that, not only are the individual items
of the Court fees, as shewn in the first table, in most
instances doubled, but that, on an average, their total amount, in
each action, as shewn by the second table, is increased in nearly
the same proportion.
Thus stand the fees as they appear by the scale, but professional
men only can discover how successfully, under the New Eules, these
fees are made to ?increase and multiply? in the working of the
actions. We will give one instance.
In an action on an open account (undisputed) where defendant
does not plead, interlocatory judgment is obtained by default. The
old process was, to sign judgment on paper, immediately on the
expiration of defendant?s time for pleading. This secures to the


plaintiff the admission of the debt, by preventing the defendant
from pleading in denial, which he could do at any time, even after
the period allowed by the Eules, provided judgment was not
signed by plaintiff. The interim between the signing of the
judgment, and the last day for setting down the cause for assess-
ment of damages afforded a time of grace for the defendant to
settle the action without further expense. If not settled by the
last day, plaintiff?s attorney filed the record and set the cause
down for assessment of damages; upon this he paid aggregate
fees to the extent of �2 11s!
Under the New Eules, the signing of judgment on paper is
abolished, and the security to the plaintiff afforded thereby, as
before explained, can only be obtained by filing the record, and
setting the cause down immediately after the expiration of de-
fendant?s time to plead. Upon this, aggregate fees of �2 15s. are
paid to the Prothonotary. By this method of proceeding, the
entire expense is entailed in the first instance, thus depriving the
defendant of the grace given him under the Old Eules. When it
is considered how many actions are settled before trial, it will be
apparent what an increase of revenue is secured to the Court on
business which never comes to a trial, and which in former times,
was saved to the suitor.
We next address ourselves to the Attorneys? Charges, to shew
that they are not increased in this proportion, but in fact dimin-
ished by the New Eules. In doing this there is some little
difficulty ; as the short but comprehensive scale instituted by His
Honor Sir IVilliam a Beckett, consisting only of twenty lines, but,
in effect, including all the charges provided for by the New Scale,
(with the exception of a few items arising from the change of
practice, which are, however, in proportion, less than would be
allowed under the Old Scale), has now been elaborated to about
140 items. A copy of the latter is appended at the end.
Its result is successfully and correctly shewn in the following
table, which is a copy of Sir William A?Beckett?s scale, with
the corresponding items under the New Rules.

In analyzing the above Scales we find that the Ist, sth, 9th,
10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 15th, and 18th items are the same in both ;
the 16th and 17th (New Scale) form about an average between
the highest and lowest in the corresponding Old; the 14th is
never higher, sometimes lower ; the 20th doubled, and the 19th
avowedly less. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th, and Bth items deserve
*
special attention ; for, although, excepting the 4th, the remunera-
tion is the same in both scales, the amount of work performed by
the attorney has been considerably augmented by the alteration of
the length of the folio from 72 to 90 words?exactly one-fourth
more. Bearing this in mind, the 2nd, 3rd, 7th, and Bth items,
whilst apparently the same in both, are, in effect, one-fifth less
under the New than the Old Scale, and the 4th item, whilst
increased in remuneration one-third, is augmented in labor one-
fifth.
The above table has only reference to actions where the amount


sought is over �5O; should the amount be Under �5O, ?the
scale of remuneration, by the New Rules, is considerably lower,
while, under the Old Rules, the same scale obtained for all actions.
\Ve next submit, as in the case of the Court fees, the effect of
the above charges, in the same six actions before made use of in
reference to the Court fees. The same Court fees are here repeated
to make the table more useful for reference.

The remark following the 2nd table, as to counsel?s fees, applies
here also.
By the above table and explanation it will be seen that, while tho
expense to the public is, in reality, very little if at all diminished,
the Court fees are considerably increased. The above exposition
will, we think, fully justify the public expression of our convic-
tion, that the Legislative Council, when moved on the ground
mentioned in the Colonial Secretary?s letter, and referred to by
His Honor, was not misinformed. And we cannot but express
our surprise that the imputation of having misinformed the
House, cast by His Honor?s letter on the Attorneys, should have
been so unconditionally cast upon our profession.
Our third step brings us to the general question of the adequacy
of remuneration allowed by the New Rules, when taken in con-
nection with the existing circumstances of the times. His Honor,
in his letter to the Colonial Secretary, above alluded to, states ;
? The Scales of Costs recently, fixed by the Fifteen Judges of
England, were taken as the basis of calculation, as far as they were
capable of being applied, and what was considered to be a liberal
augmentation was made.
On examining the Schedule appended to the New Rules (com-
prising fees of Court and Charges of Attorneys), we find that it is


English.

copied, almost verbatim, from that recently promulgated in Eng-
land. And that, while the scale of ? fees? is consistently aug-
mented, the Attorney?s Charges (with the exception of the seven
items mentioned in the next table) are in no way increased, but,
on the contrary, two items, in the higher class of actions, and all
the items in actions between �2O and �5O, are diminished.
We must therefore suppose that the paragraph, above quoted
from His Honor?s letter, had reference to the addition of 50 per
cent, which he, and Mr. Justice Williams, pledged themselves to
allow us, and that, at the time of writing, it had escaped his
memory that they had withdrawn the pledge, as will be afterwards
shewn.
THE FOLLOWING- TABLE CONTAINS THE
ITEMS EE PE BRED TO.
(Table Wo. 5.)
With regard to the numerous items included in the term ?Draw-
ing,? and intended to remunerate the attorney for his mental labor
(which, of all other charges, ought to be handsomely paid for, as
involving the experience, learning, and aptitude of the practitioner),
it will naturally be inferred from their absence from the above
table, that they are not altered; but the fact is, that as, when com-
pared in a previous part of this statement with the old colonial,
so now, when compared with the present English scale, they ex-
*No Correspondent can be obtained to work for this amount. The charge
actually paid averages four times the sum.


Mbit a considerable diminution ; as the Judges, while retaining the
English standard of compensation, have raised the amount of work,
by "declaring that the folio, which still in England (as formerly
here) contains 72 words shall henceforth, in Victoria, comprise 90 ;
thus reducing our remuneration one-fourth below the English
standard.
The increased remuneration of one-third, shewn in the seventh
item of the above scale for copying, bears but small proportion to
the increased amount of labor and outlay involved in the extended
length of the folio, and the expense, to the attorney in the Colony,
over his brother, in England, which latter, is augmented at least
four, and in many instances, six times ; and, in respect of office
rent, ten times, at the very lowest calculeration.
In addition to the disproportionate remuneration paid to the
English and Colonial attorney,?taking into consideration their re-
lative expenses, ?there is, as previously hinted, a most significant
fact exhibited in the comparison of the two scales, tending to
lessen, still more, in a numerous class of actions, the Attorney?s
Charges in the Colony. The English scale contains two sets of
charges, ?one for actions over, and the other under �2O. The New
Colonial scale, while, on a similar principle, applying a different
rate of charges to two classes of actions, raises that on which the
lower scale is payable, from �2O to �5O. Thus, while the attorney
in England obtains the highest remuneration for a debt involving
�2l, the Colonial practitioner is remunerated with the lower scale
while recovering �49. The injustice of this requires no comment
beyond replying to those who would remind us that �2O at home
is equal to �5O here,? that we should be happy to see our remuner-
ation based upon the some principle.

But one more table will complete our statistics, and this we
consider absolutely necessary, to enable us to place, in its true
light, the amount of remuneration paid to attorneys for the
arduous, harrasing, and responsible duties imposed upon them, in
their connection with the litigating public. In the second table,
contained in this pamphlet, there appears the actual amount of
costs paid by the client in six actions, and of the Court fees paid
in each; leaving an apparently large balance* to the credit of the
attorney conducting the suit. Of this balance, it will scarcely be
believed what a very insignificant amount turns out, on analzya-
tion, to be profit.
The following tables shew the disposal of the entire sum paid

on each bill of costs ; by which, it will appear how much is paid
by the attorney in disbursements known as ? costs out of pocket,?
(and for what paid,) and how much remains as the recompense of
his labor and outlay of capital:?

The remark as to Counsels? Fees, made after the second table,
is particularly applicable here. The effect of the alteration then
referred to, on the above table is, that while the costs out of
pocket for Counsel and Court Fees are considerably augmented, the
? remuneration,? not being increased in amount, is still less in
porportion to the outlay.
The amount of profit shewn by the above Scale has again to be
diminished by a proportionate amount of the outlay incurred in
stationery, salary to a managing clerk, and rent of office. If these
expenses be taken into consideration, with the interest of the


money on the outlay, it is apparent that the practitioner, on whom
rests the serious responsibility, both moral and pecuniary, of
other men?s property and interests, and the anxiety arising there-
from, receives as an equivalent for his services?which are surely
as valuable as those of any other servants of the public,?a remu-
neration which the most insignificant dabbler in trade would re-
gard with contempt.
It may, perhaps, suggest itself to the minds of some of our
readers, that provided their business is done, and their end ac-
complished, the less expense incurred in obtaining these objects
the greater amount of good produced. This view is as erroneous
as it is selfish; and although we feel it is unnecessary to enter into
any argument to prove it so with the respectable and liberal
minded portion of the community, we consider it is but fair to
them and ourselves to place them upon their guard against being
carried away with such a plausible, but erroneous principle, as its
effects must inevitably be to lower the tone of our profession and
jeopardize their interests.
It cannot be expected that men who have received a liberal
education, and who must, from their experience and observation
of the transactions of their clients, become in a very short time
intimately acquained with the many facilities which in this
colony present themselves to men of capital or intelligence, of
accumulating a fortune, will stand by and complacently view the
stream of wealth pouring into the laps of their brother-colonists,
while they themselves are expending their hard-earned knowledge,
labor, and experience, in the unremunerating toil of securing to
their clients the safe possession of their accumulated wealth, or
repelling aggressions on their rights. It behoves the community,
for its own sake, to endeavor to retain within the ranks of the
legal profession men of the highest respectability and most ex-
tensive experience; and to do this, it is evident that professional
men should be satisfied that, while dedicating their talents and
experience to the service of their fellow-men, they may expect a
reward proportionate to the gains derived from any other kind of
industry. Should such remuneration be withheld, from a feeling
of cupidity, or a want of thorough appreciation of the value of such
services, the result must inevitably be, that those respectable
members, who, from other sources than the law, have become
independent, will retire in disgust from such a thankless office ;


and those, who equally respectable, but not so fortunate, are
compelled from circumstances to adhere to the profession, will
confine themselves to the practice of conveyancing and advice ;
leaving the practice of the Court (which though more laborious
to the solicitor, is not less necessary to the public) to a class of
unprincipled adventurers, who, with ingenuity enough to evade
any Regulations or Rules of Court, however stringent or carefully
drawn, will by a studied multiplication of difficulties, with the view
to supply to themselves that remuneration which the Court, by its
present Rules, denies to legitimate business?reflects discredit upon
the whole body?work most injuriously against the interests of
the public?and at length extract from their dearly-bought ex-
perience, that justice which we now seek from their good sense.
The Legislative Council was apparently, impressed with such a
view of the subject when (in compliance with our appeal to them
on the question of remuneration) they refused to recommend the
adoption of the New Scale of Charges. We can imagine the feel-
ings of Honorable Members, when they discovered that (notwith-
standing their deliberately expressed opinion) the Rules were
adopted ?in globo? by His Excellency, with the advice, of course,
of his Crown Law Officers, on the alleged ground, ? that they
must all stand or fall together ; and, as the Court Fees were press-
ing, the charges must pass in other words, that as the Court
.and its Officers must be supported, the Attorneys might con-
veniently be sacrificed, as it was a matter for which no one was
supposed to care.
With the above remarks we feel we might, with safety, leave
the subject in the hands of the public ; but, it behoves us to
f- ?
answer the question which will naturally arise, ? why we do not
lay these arguments before (and seek for this remuneration from)
the Judges of the-Court, who by their dictum, sanctioned by the
Legislative Council, could effect the desired alteration.? To this
we reply, that we have on many occasions submitted our wishes
and reasons, and we now proceed to shew the details of our con-
ferences, which have only led to results as disheartening as un-
expected.
About the month of August, 1853, the Attorneys, perceiving
that the salary of the Judges and other Officers of Government
were very handsomely supplemented by the Council, addressed
the Judges on the question of remuneration. After some inter-


views, an increase of �5O per cent, was assented to, and an order
was given to the Prothonotary to that effect. Of a sudden, it was
discovered hv their Honors, that, before such an order could he
carried out, a rule to that effect must lie on the table of the
? House? for thirty days; and as the Council was not then sitting,
we had nothing left but patience. Before the House met, the
Judges determined upon adopting an entirely new mode of pro-
cedure, and the rules to carry out the change. They were ac-
cordingly drawn, and (in imitation of the plan adopted by the
Judges in .England), a Scale of Fees and Charges, supposed to be
applicable to the new form of procedure, was submitted to the
Council. A deputation of the Attorneys waited oh their Honors,
by appointment. At this meeting the Acting-Chief-Justice, in
reply to objections raised as to the insufficiency of the charges,
repeatedly reminded the Attorneys ? that they must remember
the true charge would be �5O per cent, thereon.? And Mr. Justice
Williams explained ?that the principle on which they (the Judges)
had acted, was, instead of going through the Scale seriatim;
to take the English Scale as a basis, and, by Rules of Court issued
from time to time, to order such a per centage on the gross
amount of taxed costs (less fees out of pocket) as might meet
the increase of expenses, &c.? To this the deputation gave the
fullest approval, and, although they mentioned that they con-
sidered 50 rather under the per centage required by the times,
expressed acquiescence in the then promised increase to that
extent, on the express statement of the Judges, that if that was
proved to be inadequate, a further increase would be ordered.
Some short time afterwards, and contemporaneously with the
Rules being placed upon the table of the ? House,? the Acting-
Chief-Justice informed the Secretary of the Law Society, by letter,
that. the Judges had determined on withdrawing the Rule
allowing �5O per cent, increase, considering that the increase in
business would make amends for the decrease in remuneration.
On the receipt of such an unexpected communication, a petition
was presented to the Legislative Council by the Attorneys, pray-
ing that the Members would not recommend the adoption of the
New Rules, on the ground that the Attorneys? Charges, as ordered
therein, were not sufficient to remunerate the profession.
The arguments used on that occasion were of sufficient force to
convince the House that the prayer of the petition was just, and


accordingly a recommendation was forwarded by the Council to
His Excellency, that that portion of the Eules which comprised the
? charges? should not be adopted. This recommendation (as men-
tioned in a former part of this statement) was quietly laid aside
and the Eules passed in their integrity (?) on the ground above set
forth: but it was distinctly stated at that time, that it was done
so on the understanding that immediate steps should be taken by
the Judges to bring in a rule ordering an increase on the
charges. Some considerable time having elapsed, and no steps
taken by their Honors, the Attorneys requested �n interview on
the subject. An appointment was made for the 4th April. In
consequence of a mistake as to the hour of meeting, but few
attended at the precise time. These few requested a short delay
to enable the other members to be present, but such an indulgence
was peremptorily refused.
Another appointment was procured, at which the Attorneys
attended, but from which their Honors were absent. A third
meeting was appointed for the 18th of the same month, when, at
length, Mr. Justice Williams received a deputation from our pro-
fession, and at this meeting His Honor distinctly admitted that
? within his own knowledge, the Common Law did not pay, even
in former times,? and, being closely pressed to increase the charges
100 per cent, at once, he stated, as one reason for refusing, that
the subject was an unpopular one, and would, perhaps, be taken
up by the press and as another, ? that having drawn up the
Scale himself, and being, in his opinion, fully competent to decide
the question of remuneration to the Attorneys, he felt so disgusted
at their holding a different view of the subject, and not at once
fully perceiving and appreciating his liberality in suggesting 50
per cent, increase, that he had withdrawn from any further
interest in the matter, and left it to take its own course.? .We
had always understood that Judges, in the exercise of their
judicial functions, were superior to private feeling, or dread of
popular censure.
The result, however, of this meeting was a promise that a Eule
should forthwith be placed upon the table of the House, ordering
an addition of 50 per cent. How this promise has been carried
m
out will appear by the sequel.
On Monday the 21st March (exactly forty days after the
passing of the Hew Eules) the Acting-Chief-Justice forwarded to


the Colonial Secretary the letter alluded to in the opening of this
statement, intending to accompany it with the Eule in question.
The Eule, it appears, was by accident omitted, of which His Honor
received intimation from the Colonial Secretary. We believe
a rigid search was instituted for the missing document, and not
having been found, another copy was subsequently forwarded to
the Colonial Secretary, but too late to be laid on the table of the
House until the following Monday. Seven clear days were thus
lost, and sufficient time was not afforded before the prorogation of
Council to enable the Rule to lie on the table of the House thirty
clear days. An attempt was made by a Member of the Council to
remedy the effect of the delay ! but, in consequence of difficulties
suggested by the Attorney-General (!), he found it useless, and
withdrew his motion. We do not say that the Eule, which, after
so much delay, at length found its way (too late) into the Legisla-
tive Chamber, was designedly retarded; but we know that the
effect to us is quite as injurious, and we consider we have just
grounds of complaint in being thus compelled to postpone, till the
next opening of the Council, the power to claim, under the Eules
of the Court in which we practice, a fair remuneration for our
services, the absence of which remuneration would compel us to
work at a loss, and which postponement will in the meantime
entail upon our clients, even when successful, a heavy expense for
the conduct of their business, which they cheerfully accord to us,
in the meantime, as the well-merited reward of our labors, but
which, they justly consider, ought to be recoverable from the un-
successful party.
/
SJ
In conclusion, we have only to add, that we most readily adopt
the suggestion of His Honor the Acting-Chief-Justice in the letter
so often alluded to, of referring the whole matter to a Committee
of the Legislative Council, empowered to take evidence and hear
the opinions of those who pay, as well as those who receive costs.
We have no fear of submitting the merits of the case to the con-
sideration of men who are themselves affected, both immediately
and prospectively, by the remuneration paid to those to whose
probity and ability their most important worldly interests are
confided, and we feel assured that the same sound policy which
governed them in voting liberal salaries for the Judges, as well
as other Government officers placed in situations of responsibility
and trust, and also their own extended views of political economy,


and a sympathy for their brother colonists, will lead them to apply
in our case the well-known maxim, that ? the laborer is worthy of
his hire.?

Letter of His Honor the Acting Chief Justice, alluded to in the
within Statement.
G. 8., 419.
54 ( 1759. Judges? Chambers,
21st March, 1854.
Sib,
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of 15th February, 1854, on the subject of the Address presented
to His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor by the Honorable the
Legislative Council, praying him to disallow the ? Schedule of
Fees? appended to the ? Rules of Court,? recently prepared by the
Judges of the Supreme Court.
It is unfortunately not in my power to meet the enquiry directed
by His Excellency in a manner satisfactory to myself, inasmuch
as I am not in possession of any specific grounds of objection to
any of the numereus items in the Schedule.
You state in your letter ? that it has been collected from the
debate? in the Legislative Council, that the reason actuating the
House was, that while the Court Fees were increased, the Attor-
neys? charges were not proportionately augmented.
I may be allowed to justify the act of the Judges by respectfully
assuring His Excellency that the Honorable House must have
been misinformed if moved on such grounds.
In my letter to you of November 29th, 1853, I disclosed the
motives and circumstances which had influenced the Judges in
preparing the Schedule. ?
The ? Scale of Costs? recently fixed by the fifteen Judges of
England were taken as the basis of calculation, as far as they were
capable of being applied, and what was conceived to be a liberal
augmentation was made.
As regards the Table of Court Fees, I beg to subjoin a list of
those to be paid on the Common Law side of the Court, accom-
panied with explanatory notes, and am prepared, if required, to


offer comments on the others. There does not appear to he any
valid reason why these should he disturbed.
With respect to those regulating the costs of Attorneys, I had
proposed to submit a similar explanatory table, which would have
exhibited the care ?with which the Judges, in compiling them, had
considered the rights and interests of suitors and of the public, as
well as of the professional gentlemen, at the same time by no
means disregarding the latter.
It has become unnecessary to trespass on the time of His Excel-
lency with this document, as His Honor Mr. Justice Williams
received a Deputation of Attorneys, who waited on him last week
to state their objections to the scale of these costs. I was pre-
vented from giving my attendance, but His Honor Mr. Justice
Williams has informed me that a very large proportion of the
Attorneys in practice in Melbourne appeared before him; they
were extremely anxious that an increase of not less than �lOO per
cent, should be allowed; to this neither His Honor nor I can bring
ourselves to assent, but His Honor Mr. Justice Williams states
that the representations made to him by the gentlemen present
induce him to accede to a suggestion that an increase of �5O per
cent, on the existing tariff of costs may be made ; this is the
amount originally contended for, and as I have no further desire to
resist the suggestion (if it be considered as of a temporary nature),
a Rule of Court suitable for the purpose has been prepared.
That Rule I have the honor to enclose, with a request that you
will be pleased to state to His Excellency, that by this course
objections of the gentlemen of the legal profession may be ob-
viated, and the professed intention of the Honorable the Legislative
Council complied with.
With the approval of His Excellency, you will further be
pleased to lay it on the Table of the Honorable the Legislative
Council, at your earliest convenience.
I consider it still necessary to observe that, on the subject of
this increase of Fees, a concession has been made to a branch of the
legal profession, in deference to the voice of those of its members
who have submitted their objections to the Honorable the
Legislative Council, and through that body to His Excel-
lency ; and, moreover, that remonstrance has only been heard on
one side.
Great, I will not say too great, stress has been laid on the in-


APPENDIX.
creased expense entailed on gentlemen of the legal profession in
supporting their establishments.
That, which is incontestible, and which occurs in the econ-
omically-conducted office as well as in those in which expenditure
is less controlled, has been already enumerated amongst the causes
disposing the Judges to raise, as they did, the scale of remuneration
for such important and material services requiring professional
ability as were actually performed.
But while the Judges have been labouring to simplify and
diminish the machinery of the Court to relieve the suitor from the
operose and dilatory proceedings which hitherto obstructed his
progress, and to render justice accessible and obtainable by ex-
peditious and inexpensive means, they will have only partially
succeeded if the spirit which originated the impediments which
they have endeayoured to remove be still allowed to pervade the
transactions of the practitioners, and a system of disproportionate
and extravagant payments for minute and detailed services of a
purely mechanical character, and for operations delegated to
scriveners or messengers, be perpetuated. However, the question
is now left by the Judges with His Excellency, to be placed, with
his sanction, in the hands of the Representatives; and if the
public be seriously concerned to protect itself from taxation of
this nature, the whole matter might be referred to a Committee
empowered to take evidence and hear the opinions of those who
pay, as well as those who receive costs.
Will you have the goodness to inform His Excellency the Lieu-
tenant-Governor, that the delay in sending a reply to your letter
(15th February, 1854) occurred in consequence of an interference
(over which I had no control) with the arrangements made by the
Judges to receive the deputation of the Attorneys.
I have the honor to be, Sir,
Your obedient servant,
(Signed) REDMOND BARRY,
Acting Chief Justice.

THE Court Fees allowed for Business in Common Law
and the County Court not being remunerative to the
Practitioners, a Commission will, from this date, he
charged in this Office, on the amount of debts recovered
and paid over to Clients, at the following Scale, and no
� extra costs? will he charged.
0 (S &2a IE 3
On Sums up to �2OO - - - - �5 per cent.
Above �2OO and not exceeding �5OO �3 per cent.
Above �5OO and not exceeding �lOOO �2 per cent.
Above �lOOO - �1 per cent.
If the Commission, at the rate of any one of the
three last, should be less than the Maximum of that at
the Scale preceding it, the Maximum at the preceding
Scale will be charged.
This Notice refers only to Proceedings for Debts t�
which there is no real Defence. In all cases in which
there is a bona fide dispute, the ordinary practice of
making out a Bill, as between Attorney and Client, and
giving Credit for any amount received from the other
side, will be followed.
In cases where Proceedings have been commenced,
and the parties subsequently settle between themselves,
the above Commission will be chargeable.
