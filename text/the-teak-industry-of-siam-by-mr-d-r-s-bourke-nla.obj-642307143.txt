The Teak Industry of Siam.
CHAPTER I.
Situation and Area, General Topo-
graphy, General Geological Features.
Climate.
A. Situation and Area.
The Northern Siamese teak zone is
situate 4 mainly between latitude 17° N
%ndthenorthern boundary of the country,
which rafiges from latitude 19° 4Q' to
20- 30'N, and between longtitudes 97°
30' and 101° 20'E.
To the west of the River Menam
Chao Phya there are certain scattered
outlying teak forests extending as far
south as latitude 14°N in the Province
of Kanburi, whilst, to the east of this
mam river, there are a few detached teak
aieas as far south as latitude 15° N. but
the main body of forests is north
of latitude 17° N.
The teak tree may be said to o TOW
throughout this northern zone, hut at
the same time only in certain local-
ities where the general conditions are
suitable.
No general and full topographical
«vrv ey of Northern Siam is yet available
U.t the total area of this zone has
been roughly estimated at 107,000 square
Kilometres, or 41,000 square miles, of
"Inch it is probable that the teak-
producing areas do not exceed 27,000
square kilometres, or about 10,000
square miles, that is to say, approximate-
ly a quarter of the whole area.
B. General Topography
, The region may be described as
” Yu, eVei ’ mountai »°us in places.
ie hill and mountain ranges run in
belts from 20 to 25 kilometres wide,
| the usual heights of these ranges being
j from 600 to 900 metres, or from 2,000'
to 3,000', but in places much higher
mountain masses occur. Thus the
highest mountain in Siam, Doi Intanon
or Doi Angka, which is 2.580 metres,
or 8,450', in height, lies within this
legion, and the Doi Sutep mountain, just
north of the town of Chiengmai, the
capital of Northern Siam, attains a
height of 1,676 metres, or 5,447'. There
| are several other mountains in this
| region higher than Doi Sutep.
| Except in the extreme north-eastern
i corner of this region, the hill and
; mountain ranges run north and south
more or less parallel to one another, and
the niain rivers and streams follow the
main valleys between the hill ranges.
In the north-eastern corner the hill
and mountain ranges run more or less
east and west and the main streams flow
eastwards.
The whole zone is traversed by a vast
network of waterways of varying size
and nature, and contains eight main
drainage basins, four being of small, and
four of large size. Two of the smaller
basins, forming the Me Pai and Me Yuam
Elvers, drain westwards into the Salween
Eher, which flows south-wards through
Turinese territory into the sea at Am-
hdst. 50 miles below Monlmein. In the
north-eastern corner of this zone two
other small rivers, the Me lug and the Me
Kok, drain eastwards into the great Me
Khong River, which forms the boundary
between Siam and French Indo-China
in this particular area. Finally, the
four large remaining rivers, the Me
Ping, the Me Wang, the Me Yom and
the Nan, have their basins completely


within Siamese territory. Their head
waters are situated in the northern
region of Siam and they How southwards,
all meeting at various points to form
finally the main River Menam Chao
Pliya, which flows through Bangkok into
the Gulf of Siam.
The general topographical features
of this zone consist, first, of flat alluvial
valley basins varying in width from 15
to 20 kilometres, which are more or less
under cultivation ; between these basins
and the hill or mountain ranges there is
usually a broad or fairly broad belt of
rolling foothills, much intersected by
limeroOs side-streams and tribu-
nes. The hill and mountain ranges
e often very steep. Owing to peeu-
«rgeological formations, in places these
> r er basins are cut up into sections,
d these sections are connected by
rrow rugged canyons or gorges form-
l rapids or narrows ”in the courses
the rivers, so that, if the region were
rtly submerged, a chain of lakes coll-
ated by narrow straits would be pro-
file beds of the main rivers are
Tally of a very winding nature, and
! riveva themselves are usually mud-
dy and sluggish, except in flood time
and where they pass through , the steep
narrow gorges to which allusion has
already been made. Owing to their
shifting and shallow beds these main
rivers are bad for navigation except dur-
ing the floods, and the rise and fall of
their waters during the rains is at all
times extremely uncertain. The side-
streams and tributaries are of almost
vaiiety, but are mainly narrow
rocky valleys liable to sudden violent
rises or spates during the rains and com-
pletely dry during the rest of the year.
The genera] character of the topo-
graphy of this region and the nature of
the rivers and streams are of the great-
est importance to the teak industry, be-
cause every year the output of the
Northern Siamese teak-forests is floated
down the numerous water-w r ays towards
its destination.
C- General Geological Features.
<■ Up to the present time no general
geological map of the region has been
made, but an extremely interesting Re-
connaissance Geological Report of the
Circles of Bayap and Maharashtra,* with
sketch maps, has been written by Mr.
Wallace Lee, Petroleum Geologist, and
published in B.E. 2466 (1923) by the
Department of Royal State Railways.
The geological formations of this
region are very varied and complicated,
and will require a great deal of study.
In general, the whole country, forms a
more or less parallel series of synclinal
and anticlinal folds running in north-
ern and southern directions, composed
of many different geological structures.
For forest purposes, at present, it is
sufficient to divide the formation into
the following broad groups (i) basin-
deposits (ii) shales and sandstones
(iii) limestones (iv) schists and slates
(v) granite and other igneous rocks
(vi) laterite and lateritic formations.
(i) Basin Deposits.
These deposits are varied in charac-
ter, as they include all the finer
alluvia of streams and rivers and
the hill outwash in the valley bottoms
and outskirts of foot-hills. Consider-
ing these from the practical point
of view, they thus include both
heavy stiff agricultural soil forming
.... .. . t?
* Now amalgamated into one Circle, Bayap.


I irrigated pad i fields or capable of irri-
gation and cultivation, as well as con-
siderable tracts of well-drained or
fairly well-drained sandy alluvial soil,
found in valley bottoms or along the
I banks of streams throughout this region.
(II) Shales and Sandstones.
Such formations are found scattered
throughout this region. They are of
great variety, the sandstone being
usually grey, yellow, brown or reddish
in colour. The majority of the teak-
bearing areas of Northern Siam occupy
sandstone or shale formations.
: # (ill) Limestones.
R I striking and spectacular
al feature in Northern Siam
by the limestone formations,
tghout this region, but very
the extreme eastern portion
The outcrops usually form a dis-
onnected and isolated series of sharp
peaks and narrow ranges of hills, rising
ft'om the plains. One side of
the outcrop is usually a sheer cliff,
while the opposite slope is steep and
The rocks themselves are hard and
M'ly crystalline in texture, whitish,
grey or iight blue in colour. A peculiar
#nd characteristic flora grows on these
limestone hills, and they are noted for
|he fine teak they produce,
ft Ov) Schists and Slates,
p Ihe sc occur scattered throughout,
Especially near granite formations. In
phe central portion of the teak zone, in
|he valleys of the Me Ping, Me Wang
jind Me Yom. considerable areas occur,
while a large, compact, and continuous
l rea 18 known to occur in the eastern
If ai t the zone, at the head waters of
phe Me Nan River.
(v) Granite and Other Igneous Rocks.
The portions of the teak zone com-
posed of such rocks are few in number
and very scattered. It is notable fhat
such formations either coververy exten-
sive continuous areas, or very small
isolated areas.
A long continuous belt of granite
'extends north and south, from the neigh-
bourhood of Muang Fang in North-
Eastern Siam down to the Khun Tan
tunnel on the Northern Railway line. It
is believed to be nearly 200 kilometres
lon g and about 16 kilometres wide.
Another long continuous granite
belt exists to the west of the Me Ping
River. It is believed to be about 100
kilometres long but varies much in
width, being exceptionally narrow in
places. Small isolated masses of gra-
nite occur scattered throughout this
region.
There is also a considerable variety
of intrusive and extrusive rocks, which
occur chiefly in the form of dikes and
bosses of basalt and rhyolite.
(vi) Lateritc and Lateritic Formations.
Vast areas of Northern Siam are
composed of latcrite or lateritic forma-
tions ; these cover a larger area of land
surface than any other kind of forma-
tion, and are found occupying both level
plains, foothills and mountains up to
4,000' elevation.
The characteristic rock is red late-
ritc, which often forms extensive out-
crops ; it weathers and decomposes
easily, forming red or pinkish soils,
either of clayey or sandy nature. Such
soils are usually well drained, and the
general formation is notorious for its
lack of water during the dry, hot
months of the year. The soils derived


from such rocks support a few well-
known and peculiar types of forest
vegetation not usually occurring on
other kinds of soil.
D. Climate.
As the teak zone of Northern Siam
is an inland region, it possesses a fairly
continental climate, marked by consider-
able differences of heat and cold.
The year is divisible into three sea-
sons; the dry, cold weather, which usually
lasts from the middle of November till
the middle of March, and during this
season the temperature ranges from
45° F to 90° F, the lowest temperature
recorded being 41.3° F and the coldest
months being December and January ;
the dry, hot weather, from about the mid-
dle of March to the beginning of the rains
in May, during which season the
temperature ranges from 70° F to 100° F
and over, the highest recorded tempera-
ture in Chiengmai being 109.8° F; and the
rainy season, which lasts from May to
the end of October and sometimes even
later than this. During the rains the
temperature usally ranges from 73° F to
90° F.
Records of rainfall for the past 20
years over the whole of Northern Siam
show that the average annual rainfall has
been 1,196.1 millimetres, or 47.8 inches,
fhe wettest year on record was B. E.
2452 ( 1909-1910 ), in which there
was an average rainfall of 1,653 milli-
metres, or 58 inches, throughout the
region ; and the driest year was in B. E.
2451 ( 1908-1909 ), in which the
average rainfall in the region was only
967.3 millimetres, or 38.7 inches.
Certain portions of this region re-
ceive a considerably heavier rainfall
than others, and the following list shows
the average annual rainfall for each
province, based on average figures
worked out for the last 20 years:—
Cliiengrai 1,449 millimetres or 58 inches

There is usually some rainfall dur-
ing every month of the year, but when
it rains outside the limits of the rainy
season, it usually only falls in showers,
though sometimes two or three days*
continuous rain is experienced in the
dry season. The following shows the

CHAPTER II.
General Sylvicultural Information
about the Teak Forests of
Northern Siam.
It is necessary to make a few pre-
liminary observations. Northern Sigm
is very sparsely inhabited and culti-
yated. It may be described as being
essentially a forest country. It is be-
lieved that only about 10% oE the total
area is under permanent cultivation, the
rest being made up of forest, waste
lands and shifting cultivation.
The permanent cultivation areas,
almost entirely under rice cultivation,
are situated in the large alluvial tracts
near the main rivers. Shifting cultivation
is found all over the mountains, hills and
foothills ; it is largely practised by
nomadic tribes who cut down the forests,
burn the wood, cultivate crops of hill rice
and vegetables in the ashes, and then
move on to repeat the operation else-
where in the following year. It is quite
impossible to estimate such areas, as this
type of cultivation is often under little
or no control. The rest of the country
is covered by vast forests of various
types, by secondary re-growth caused
by the shifting cultivation, which may
be classed as bushes and woody weeds*
and in places grassy plains occur, covered
by heavy tall grasses and scattered
treegrowth.
In this region the extreme eleva-
tion at which teak is found is 3,000'
(912 metres), and as a rule teak seldom
occurs in any quantity above 2,500'
(760 metres) ; all forests above these
altitudes are, therefore, completely omit-
ted. Assuming that 2,500' is the real
extreme elevation of teak in Nor-
thern Siam, it is to be noted that
this is considerably lower thaniin either
Burma or India. The reason for this is
at present unknown.
A* General Description of the chief
types of Forests growing in
~~
the Teak Z one of
Northern Siam.
*1 he forest flora of the region is
very rich and comprises a large number
of woody species, many of which also
occur in the neighbouring countries of
Burma,the Shan States and Indo-China,
but some of which are only found in
Northern Siam.
There are three main types of forest,
which contain a number of sub-types;
and again these types and sub-types often
blend into one another in such bewilder-
ing fashion that it is sometimes possible
to find the three main types all mixed
together in a few acres of forest land.
The three main types are (i) Ever-
green forests; (ii) Lateritic forests or
forests of deciduous Dipterocarps; and
(iii) Mixed deciduous forests. It is
these latter forests that contain the teak.
(i) Evergreen Forests.
In Northern Siam the evergreen
foiests are scattered in distribution, are
of limited area and of local occurrence.
It is estimated that 5% of the total area
is covered with this type of forest. They
usually grow in damp valleys and low-
lying localities on deep rich soil.
The general characteristics are as
follows. First, an upper storey of tall,
straight, and sometimes gigantic ever-
green trees from 100' to 200' in heio-ht
o ?
whose clear boles often attain a length
of 60' to 90': these trees are often


.encircled by huge creepers and Jianes.
Below this there is a second storey of
smaller trees and various kinds of palms,
intermingled with many kinds of shrubs?
cycads, can'es and bamboos. Such forests
are very notable for the many kinds of
epiphytes, such as orchids and tree-ferns,
clinging to the stems of the larger trees.
The atmosphere in such forests is hot,
damp, and stuffy, and the undergrowth
is dense and often impenetrable.
The number of species of trees in
these forests is very large, . and the
following list gives a few of the com-
moner trees:—
Polyalthia suberosa (Macliam), Po-
lyalthia obtusa (Tawng haw oi), Tala-
uma Hodgsoni (Champa pa), Bischoffia
mvanica (Tom), Artocavpus Lakoocha
(Hat), Garcinia cornea (Mada), Lager-
stroemia tomentosa (Pui sa-en), Lager-
stroemia calycnlata (Pui luang), Tetra-
meles nudiflora (Ngun), Trewia nudiflora
(Mapawp), Duabanga sonneratioid.es
(Turn ten), Dopea. odorata (Takien
tawng), Dipterocarpus alatus and Dip-
terocarpus turbinalus (Yang), Cinna-
momum spp ., Eugenia macro,carpa
(Chompu deng), Cedrela Toona (Yom
hawm), Sterculia alata (Tet chui),
Elaeocarpvs sp. (Maniun), Homalium
Damron gianum (Kai), Celtis spp .
(Hat), Putranyiva Boxburghii (Ba-ong
11 °k), Ficus Boxburghii , Ficus Cunia
(DAa), Quercus spicata (Kaw), Livis-
tona speciosa (Kaw), and Caryota urens
(Ivfiang).
Amongst the bamboos the common-
est found are— Oxytenanthera albocili-
ata (Mai lai), which occurs throughout
all classes of forests, Dendrocalamus
liamiltonii (Mai hole), Bambusa poly-
morpha (Mai hawp), Cephalostachyum
as well as many others.
There are also many species of
climbing canes throughout these areas.
Teak does not occur generally in
such forests; nevertheless, in some
places teak is found in evergreen areas,
especially in the lighter sub-types which
may be described as semi-evergreen. As
a rule the general factors are unsuitable,
the overpowering vegetation suppresses-
the teak, and eventually it disappears.
(ii) Lateritic Forests or Forests of
Deciduous Dipterocarps.
Iliese forests cover a larger area of
Northern Siam than any other type, and
are estimated to comprise aboftt 50% of
the total area of this region.
They occur on the level plains,
on low foot-hills, and sometimes on steep
hills up to 4,000' in height. They are
usually found on porous, well-drained
soils, formed by the decomposition of
laterite, which are either red clay, red-
dish or pinkish loams, reddish or white
sandy soils, and they sometimes grow
on rocky outcrops of the laterite rock
itself.
These forests are known locally as
Pa Deng or Pa Pc, and in Burma they
aie well-known under the general name
of Indaing.
The general appearance of these
forests is open and grassy, often
approaching the savannah type of
foiests ; the trees are scattered and are,
as a rule, of medium or small size, both
m height and girth. The number of
species growing in these forests is
limited, and neither bamboos nor canes
occur.
ihe Undergrowth consists of long
grass or scattered bushes. These forests
are burnt regularly every year, but,
nevertheless, natural regeneration occurs


fairly plentifully and often luxuriantly.
The following are the main sub-types
recognizable, though these sub-types
blend and form all kinds of mixtures.
(a) Mai Tung Jungle:
In which Dipterocarpus tubercula-
tus (Mai tung) is the dominant tree,
usually in a mixture with Dipterocarpus
obtusifolius (Mai liieng) and other asso-
ciates.
(b) Mai Hieng Jungle:
In which Dipterocarpus obtusifolius
(Mai hieng) is the dominant tree, in a
mixture with' Dipterocarpus tubercula-
tus (Mai tung) and other associates.
(c) Mai Pao anti Mai Nge Jungle:
In which forests Pentacme siamensis
(Mai pao) and Shoren obtusa (Mai
ngc) are the dominant species, together
with many associates.
(d) Oak Jungle:
In some forests oak trees of various
species are so prevalent that they be-
come the dominant species, and thus
really form a fourth recognizable sub-
type.
The foil owing is a list of the com-
moner species of trees occurring in these
forests: — Ui pter oca rp us tu be real a tus
(lung ) ,• Dip terocarpus obf.usi foil us
(Hieng), Pentacme siamensis (Pao),
S/iorea obtusa (Ngc), Aporosa villosa
(Muat top), Gardenia turgida (Dik
diam), liandia tomentosa (Nani tong),
Pkyllanthus embiica (Makam pawm),
Cassia Garettiana (lvl lek pc), Morirula
tomentosa ( Ta sua pa), Ochna Wallichii
(lan luang), Buck anania lati folia
(Halt mu), Melanorrhoea usitata (Halt

Carissa Carandas (Nam kl het), Stry-
chnos nu.v-blandu (Matiing), Quercus
Kerrii (Kaw mu), Quercus Thomsoni ,
Quercus set?iiserrata, Quercus polysta-
chya.
Teak as a rule shuns the lateritic
forests, sometimes because the highly
ferruginous soil appears unsuitable for
its growth, and more especially because
the soil in such forests is usually ex-
ceedingly dry and does not hold water.
Nevertheless, examples of teak-bearing
forests blending with lateritic forests
may be found in places, particularly
on heavy red clay soils which obviously
do hold water.
(Ill) Mixed Deciduous Forests.
Nearly all the remaining forest area
of Northern Siam is composed of mixed
deciduous forests, which exhibit many
sub-types blending with one another.
These forests contain a vast num-
ber of deciduous trees of different spe-
cies, with the teak growing scattered
here and there in small groups and pat-
ches and often as single trees. It is
very noticeable how irregular is the dis-
tribution of the teak, as it is often com-
pletely absent throughout large areas of
such forests, where all the conditions
appear most favourable to its growth
and development.
These forests occupy every con-
ceivable situation, aspect and elevation
from 200' up to 2,500'. During the
dry, hot months they become lealless
and, being very dry, are visited by
forest fires every year.
It would be too long to try and enu-
merate all the different species of trees
inhabiting these forests, and in the fol-
lowing list an attempt is made to men-


tion the more common associates of
teak- in the mixed deciduous forests of
Northern Siam.
The commonest associates of teak
are: —
Xylia dolabriformis (Deng), and
next to this but a long way behind comes
Lagerstroemia Balansae (Pui deng).
Closely following the above are
Terminalia mucronata (Pui luat),
Terminalia tomentosa (Rok fa), Ptero-
carpus macrocarpus (Du), Lagerstroemia
calycnlata (Tabek).
Less numerous but, nevertheless,
very widely distributed throughout the
teak forests are Dillenia pentagyna
(Siin bai luang), Mitragyna diversifolia
(Turn kwao), Bombax insigne and Bom-
bax malabaricum (Ngiu pa), Schlei-
cher a trijuga (Chok), Terminalia trip-
teroides (Pu chao), Odina Wodier ( Kuk),
Berry a mollis" (Lieng man), Spondias
pinnata (hawk), Garuga . pinnata
( Kam ), Eriolaena ( andolle i (Lie ng
Kfio), Miliiisa velutina (Kang hua
mu), Dalbergia cult rata (Ket dam),
Canangium latifolium (Nao), Cratoxy-
lon pruni forum (Tin yang), Greuria
vestita (Yap), Ad-inn, cordifolia (Kwao),
Millettia Brarulisiana (Chan), Stry-
chnos nux-bland a (Tung), Colona flori-
hunda (Yap), Vide.v limonifolia (Tin
nok), Premna pyramidata (Sak k!
kai), Dalbergia Kerrii (Pi Chan),
At'zelia xylocarpa (Maka luang).
Another important group of teak
associates are the bamboos, and the
following list represents some of
the commoner kinds found in the
teak forests:— Oxytenanthera albociliata
(Mai lai), which in Northern Siam may
be described as the commonest and
universal bamboo growing botji in teak
and evergreen forests ; Dendrocalamus
membranaceus (Mai sang), which is a
sure indicator of the suitability of any
locality for growing teak ; Bambusa
Titlda (Mai bong) ; Bambusa arundi-
nacea (Mai pai), found chiefly on flat
alluvial tracts along the banks of rivers
and streams, chiefly in the Southern
portions of the teak zone ; Thyrsostachys-
siamensis (Mai ruak), found chiefly
on limestone formations ; Cephalost-
achyum pergracile (Mai kao lam),,
chiefly growing in the moister portions
of the teak forests.
Bambusa polymorpha (Mai hawp) is
not usually a common associate of teak,
but generally occupies damp and shady
situations at the bottom of ravines, in
contrast to its habits in lower Burma.
The undergrowth in the teak forests
is very varied. The commonest shrub
or small tree in the undergrowth is
Croton oblongifolius (Plao), and several
species of Clerodendron and Flemingia
are common. It is noticeable that every
year the pestilential climbing weed
Eupatorium odor a turn (Ya muang wai)
is spreading more and more throughout
Northern Siam. It fills up the aband-
oned clearings caused by shifting culti-
vation and spreads thence, far and wide,
into the neighbouring deciduous forests,
wherever there is sufficient light for its
development.
B. General Characteristics.
(i) General.
In Northern Siam the teak tree de-
velops into a large deciduous tree, with
a thin grey exfoliating bark and large
oval-shaped leaves from 1' to 2' long.


The thickness of the bark varies
with the age and size of the tree from
0.3" to 1.2", averaging 0.7" for a full-
sized tree.
Under favourable conditions the
Hfifee grows with a tall, straight, cylindri-
cal bole, often fluted and buttressed at
the base, and a large well-developed
rounded crown.
In dry localities the teak tree sheds
its leaves as early as the middle of
January, while in moist localities it
does not lose its leaves till April. It
comes into leaf in May, with the ad-
vent of the rainy season. The teak tree
usually comes into flower in June or
July, but in dry years the flowering may
be delayed as late as August. The
fruit ripens and falls to the ground in
lebruary and March, and may germi-
nate in the following rains or may lie
dormant for one or more years.
(Ii) Natural Reproduction.
Here, as elsewhere, the teak tree de-
mands a strong light and dislikes shade
of any sort. In portions of Northern
Siam natural reproduction obviously
suffers greatly from the dense shade of
bamboos, more especially from the dense
thickets of Qxytenanthera albociliata
(Mai lai), which grow right down to
ground-level. In many places the over-
powering invasions of Eup a tori am odo-
ratum (Ya unhang wai) blot out all
hopes of the tree being able to repro-
duce itself successfully.
The whole question of natural re-
production is of vital importance to the
future of the Northern Siamese teak
forests, especially as the creation of
teak plantations and sylvicultural ope-
rations to assist the younger age classes
have not yet been undertaken on a large
scale. Speaking generally, natural re-
production may be described as fair but
very uneven. Nothing is more striking
than the richness of teak reproduction
in some forests, contrasted with the
poverty or complete absence of young
teak in othei forests. As sylviculture is
still in its infancy, it is not possible to
give moie piecise information on this
subject.
, is noteworthy that these forests
are subject to burning every year. Most
forest fires occur early, or fairly early, in
the dry weather, which is a greatadvan-
tage. In general, this burning has both
its advantages and drawbacks, but on
the whole it is advantageous by keeping
down the fast-growing undergrowth, and
thus enabling a proportion of the young-
er teak to establish itself.
On the other hand, the fierce fires
made by the shifting cultivators must
destroy annually many millions of
young teak seedlings and saplings*
(ii) Artificial Reproduction and Measures to
improve the Growing Stock.
The most important teak planta-
tions are those in the Prae Division
with a total area of 40£ ‘rai,’ or 162
acres, now from 13 to 15 years old, and
those in the Salween Division with a
total area of 255 ‘rai,’ or 102 acres, now
from 8 to 10 years old. In other Forest
Divisions there are also a few small
isolated teak plantations, so that altoge-
ther, allowing for losses in area which
are bound to occur, the area of teak
plantations in the whole of Northern
Siam may amount to about 750 ‘rai, 5 or
300 acres.
These plantations have been formed
mainly by departmental methods and


A party of timber-working-Elephants.


i regards moisture, all that can be
; Kiiid is that, wherevir moisture becomes
• excessive, teak forests are replaced by
evergreen forests. As regards elevation,
teak is extremely accommodating at all
I elevations up to 2,500' (7 60 metres).
I
As regards soil, teak is found grow-
ing freely on all kinds of soils except
those formed by the decomposition of
| kterite and on very stiff water-logged
f rice lands, although even in the latter
f ease it must be said that “padi-field” teak
hby no means uncommon. In point of
fact, teak is a most adaptable tree.
Teak needs, for its finest devclop-
I ment, a deep, rich, well-drained loam or
aandy loam, and it obtains such soils all
| over Northern Siam, from the deeompo-
l iition of sand-stone, shale, and limestone,
as well as metamorphic and igneous rocks.
| Splendid teak forests may also be found
p on well-drained, sandy basin deposits.
I. The majority of these teak forests
■Bff-'
pare found growing on sand-stone and
Ttliale formations, but, on the whole, the
; richest teak areas per unit of area grow
on limestone formations. Although
fhe latter only make up a very small
jjjbreentage of the total land surface
||of this region, it is remarkable how
much of the teak output is de-
prived from them. Teak abounds not
pPly on loamy soils derived from
\ lc r °ck itself, but also on shallow soils
mixed up with large limestone boulders
and debris.
From such observations as have
been made, it seems probable that teak
is less well distributed on soils derived
from metamorphic and igneous rocks,
anu m some loca l ities it is conspicuously
absent from soils in which the under-
lying rock is slate.
D. Growth.
In Northern Siam, as elsewhere the
teak tree grows considerably faster in
its youth than in its later years. The
rate of growth, in girth especially, i s
very irregular, and ranges between wide
extremes, as can well be imagined from
the varying conditions and the many
vicissitudes through which the tree has
to pass during its long life in the forest.
Thus teak trees have been found grow-
ing on rich alluvial soils, which attained
a girth at breast height of 7', or 2.13
metres, in 60 years, whereas many
others of the same girth have been
measured, which took from 250 to 300
years to reach this size.
In point of size, it may confidently
be stated that in Northern Siam the teak
tiee attains as large, if not larger, di-
mensions as anywhere else in the world.
At the present time, as far as is known,
the largest teak-tree now standing in
Siam is to be found in the Sentaw sub-
division of the Utaradit Province, in
the Pitsanulok Forest Division, near
Latitude 17° 30'. The girth of this tree
at breast height is 29 / 5 // , or 8.96 metres;
its total height is 151', or 46.03 metres
and it possesses a clear bole of 77', 0 r
23 47 metres. There are still a number
of teak trees known to be standing
which could compare with this tree, but
none of them could surpass it in size.
Nowadays, owing to excessive ex-
ploitation in the past, the largest trees
are usually to be found in the more
outlying and hitherto inaccessible locali-
ties, where the teak forests are of a
more virgin character, as for example
in the valleys of the Me Fang, Me Kok
and Me Dig rivers, and in isolated valleys
round the outskirts of the teak region

iis in the Nan Province and parts of the
Pitsanulok Division, where there has
been less exploitation in the past.
The following general rate of girth
has been calculated by measuring and
counting annual, rings on 400 teak
stumps situated in many localities, on
various kinds of soils and at different
altitudes. These figures include thick-
ness of the bark :
In the past it has always been as-
sumed that the general rate of girth
increment in Northern Siam was ap-
proximately equal to that in Burma,
and the data collected hitherto, though
not yet full, tend to show that this
assumption is sufficiently correct for
practical purposes, os the general
rate of girth-increment for the whole
of Burma has been worked out as fol-
lows (Vide Indian Forest Records,
Volume 111, Part I.):
The following statement shows the
number of years it takes for teak trees
in Northern Siam to attain 7' in girth,
on various classes of soils, as far as has
been ascertained to date:—
The height growths of 609 teak
trees, growing under varying conditions,
have been measured with instruments,
and the following information is worthy
of record.
The tree does not usually form a
clear well-defined bole until it has at-'
tained a girth of 4' at breast height ; at
this girth the length of the bole averages
slightly above half the total height of
the tree. The tree completes its prin-
cipal height growth, which averages |
about 108', when it has attained a girth i
at breast height of 5' to 6'. The longest!
bole measured was found to be 96'ini
length. |

general height growth of different girth j
classes, calculated from the above I
measurements: —


£. Injuries to which Teak is liable.
The following is a brief summary
of tlie chief injuries to which teak is
liable when standing in the forests.
lit'
(i) Man.
§1
. Man causes injury to teak in
various ways, first by hacking and
damaging young trees, and secondly
bv causing forest fires. The general
effects of these great fires have
already been discussed. The greatest
Joss caused by fire is among the ma-
< lure trees which have been girdled,
and which thus sometimes stand in a
fcctly dry condition in the forest for
some years before they are felled. The
■Eider classes of green trees are us-
jjblly fairly resistant to fire, and the
ijounger classes have great powers of
||oppicing and shooting up time after
time when burnt, until they eventually
fetablish themselves ; but, on the other
hand, ihey are often completely destroy-
ed by the intense local fires caused bv
||t0 shifting cultivators, who first fell the
forest and then pile up the material and
set the whole on fire.
(ii) Insects.
The bee-hole borer causes enormous
damage to all classes of teak-trees
this region. Its general
effects are discussed in another chapter.
I be only other insect disease, which lias
been noticed, is caused by some species
of defoliator not yet identified; its de-
predations are only local.
(iii) Animals.
Both wild and tame elephants do
local damage among the young teak,
tearing down and uprooting saplings and
even larger trees. Birds, especially
woodpeckers, damage all classes of teak,
by making holes in them with their
beaks to catch the bee-hole borers inside
the timber.
(iv) Fungi.
There are various kinds of fungi
which damage teak trees, but as yet no
information about them is available.
(v) Wind.
Strong winds usually prevail at the
beginning and end of the rainy season
and also in the dry, hot months. A
fair amount of damage is caused by
windfalls among the larger teak, espe-
cially among those trees growing in
exposed situations. But, of course, a
percentage of these windfalls is recover-
ed during the exploitation of the
forests.
During the past 15 years, which
corresponds approximately to the period
of the last teak leases, it is estimated
that there was a loss of 8 or 9% on the
total number of teak trees selected and
girdled.


CHAPTER III.
. general account ot the work of the Royal Forest
Department in Northern Slam, with special
reference to the Teak trade and to
the development of the
Teak leases.
_
-
The earliest available records of the
working of the Northern Siamese te'ak
forests show that the exploitation was
chiefly in the hands of Burmans and
Shans, together with a certain number
of Chinese traders and local Lao and
Siamese.
These persons obtained various
kinds permits from the Lao Chiefs, and
worked the forests in a more or less
I
irregular manner.
Owing to the irregularity with which
such permits were issued, an attempt
was made to regulate this trade by the
inclusion in the treaty with Great Bri-
tain of 188 H (B. E. 2426) of certain
clauses prohibiting British subjects from
working the teak forests without duly
registered permits, and enjoining upon
the Lao Chiefs not to issue permits for
the same forest to more than one person,
but, in spite of this, confusion still
continued and cases between contending
parties were still rife.
The first person to perceive the
great possibilities of international trade
in Siamese teak was an American Doc-
tor, whose operations eventually resulted
in several important European com-
panies taking up the business. But,
owing; to the state of affairs then pre-
O
vailing in Northern Siam, the entry of
these firms did little to allay the existing
confusion, because they competed with
one another to obtain working rights
over the various forests from the diffe-
rent Lao Chiefs.
Under the circumstances it was
natural that the girdling of the teak
trees should be carried on in an indis-
criminate manner, under no definite
rules and with no thought for the
future of the forests, any size of tree
being girdled to suit the purchasei s
taste. The timber was Royalty mark-
ed, and the Royalty was collected on
the spot in a haphazard manner by
local officials appointed by the Lao
Chiefs. Theoretically, out of the Royal-
ty collected, the Siamese Government
took one-half share and the Lao Chiefs
the other half, but the system naturally
lent itself to serious abuses.
To improve matters and to put the
whole industry on a more stable and
systematic basis, the Siamese Govern-
ment decided to engage the services of
a trained and experienced British Forest
Officer from Burma, with a view to
establishing a State Forest Depart-
ment.
Mr. H. A. Slade, the officer in ques-
tion, arrived in January B. E. 2438
(1896), and in due course submitted
a report in which he pointed out that
severe losses were being : sustained
through wasteful felling and log-
o'inc: ; that the theft of teak for boat-
building and house-construction was
regrettably prevalent ; and that incalcul-
able damage was being done to the
forests bv the felling and exploitation
of small undersized trees for posts and
similar purposes.
To remedy the unstable conditions
obtaining, he made the following sugges-
tions which were adopted by the Gov-
ernment :


I) No more leases should be
) Fellings should be reduced
the existing leases.
) No working should be allowed
3 re without a regular lease.
) Extraction of undersized teak

n.
II? Proposals were made to establish a
Jfcfest Department with a small regular
.Staff to be increased in the future as the
Work developed. The headquarters of
Ipe Department were at that time fixed
at Chiengmai. By the end of B. E. 2441
(March 1899) the staff consisted of 10
European and 7 Siamese Forest Offi-
cers. The Department was placed under
the control of the Ministry of the
Interior. Steps were also taken to re-
cruit and send abroad, to receive training
in forestry, young educated Siamese
students-, and from the year B.' E.
2446 (1903-04) onwards such trained
officers began to join the Department.
In order to safeguard the interests
of the Siamese Government, and in
Older to put a stop to the most .flagrant
abuses, the following legislation was en-
acted relating to the exploitation of teak
forests:—
(1) The Royal Decree of 17th
January B. E. 2439 (1897), prohibiting
the defacing of property-marks, and
providing for the examination and
settlement of claims to super-marked
timber.
This was a most necessary measure,
because at that time there were lar( r e
numbers of teak logs lying all over the
country under disputed ownership. All
kinds of devices were being resorted to,
to deface the original hammer marks and
to substitute or superimpose false ham-
mer marks on the logs. In fact, for
many years the forest staff was actively
engaged in settling the disputed owner-
ship of such logs.
(2) The Royal Decree of 9th
September 13. E. 2440 (1897), prohi-
biting any further girdling and felling
of small undersized teak trees, and
imposing an increased Royalty rate on
such trees as had been girdled or felled
before the Decree came into force.
(3) The Royal Decree of Ist
December B. E. 2440 (1897), prohibit-


4-ng< the girdling or felling of any teak
tree, except under a regular lease or
some written Government authorization.
(4) The Royal Decree of 23rd
February B. E. 2441 (1899), prohibit-
ing- anyone from marking with a private
hammer-mark any log of which he was
not the undisputed owner.
(5) The Royal Decree' of 9th
July B. E. 2442 (1899), prohibiting the
removal of any teak timber, before it
had been properly Royalty-marked and
Royalty collected.
One of the first measures intro-
duced, in order to put the teak
industry on a more regular and con-
trolled basis, was the publishing of a
regular Lease Form for the working of
teak forests. All new leases were
granted in this form, and as many of the
existing lessees as possible were induced
to exchange their leases for those in
the new form. The main provisions of
this first regular lease were as follows: —
(1) The lease period was 6 years.
(2) The rates of Royalty fixed
were: —
For European Firms, with a few ex-
ceptions,
Full-sized logs ... Rs. 4J each
Small logs ... Rs. lj ~
Logs other than
teak... Rs. 2 ~
For Local Lessees
Full-sized logs ... Rs. to each
Small logs ... Rs. 1J- each
Logs other than
teak... Rs. 1J to 3 each.
“Full sized logs” were logs over
4'3 7/ at mid-girth, or logs not less than
lO'G" long.
“Small logs” were logs below both
these dimensions.
(3) No timber could be converted
till Royalty and Duty had been paid.
(4) No trees were allowed to-
be girdled during the W months, prece-
ding the expiration of the lease.
(5) No trees were allowed- to,
be girdled which were less than 6' 4|"
in girth at 54" from ground-level. This
exploitable girth was in some cases rais-
ed to 7' 1".
#
(6) All trees were to be gird-
led two years before being felled.
(7) No tree was to be girdled
unless there was another seed-bearing
tree standing near it. *
(8) Various penalties were imposed
for damage done to the forests during
felling ; for damage done to timber
during felling and logging ; for logs
burnt in the forests and in transit.
(9) All logs had to be marked with
a property-mark hammer before being
placed in any floating stream.
(10) Logs rejected by the lessee
could either be taken over by the Forest
Department and disposed of, after re-
payment of any dues already paid by
the lessee, or returned to the lessee, in*
which case the latter was bound to pay
the dues on them and could convert
them after doing so.
(11) The Minister of the Interior
had the power to close the whole of the
leased area, or any part of it, to further,
girdling if he thought it necessary to do
so, or could order all girdling to be done
under a Forest Officer’s supervision. In
the ordinary course of events the gird-:
ling of the teak was done by the lessees.
(12) The lessee had the right toj
grant permits to any approved person or j
persons to work the whole or part of hisi
leased area, but each permit thus grant-
ed had to be duly registered, and a re-f
gistration fee of Rs. 300 paid. |


The above form of lease having
proved unsatisfactory for various rea-
ffcdos, a new form was drawn up and
Aifmight into force in the case of all new
«Jeases, as well as exchanged for the old
Rorms, so that by the end of B. E. 2440
mh&swFn i 8.98 ) practically every lease

Under this new lease every area
lls divided into two halves, each half
be worked over in 6 years, thus
ing a felling-cycle of 12 years,
ng which the whole forest was to be
When these new 6 year leases
ted, no further girdling was permit-
owing to the large accumulated
ks of girdled teak already stand-
P&g in the forests. But, as time went on
Ed this stock began to be worked off,
Smiling of trees above a fixed mini-
Illm girth was re-started in many
Ijpes. The work was done by Forest
■leers or by Assistants of the Euro-
Jpn timber firms working under the
JJgbrest Officers, and this system was
during the years B. E. 2446
and 2447 (1903-1905). As, however,

■out the year B. E. 2448 (1905-1906)

department. The principle of all this
J|fe'dling was that two out of every
W ve marketable trees above 6' 4J"
Brth should be* girdled, fair average
?tsees to be selected.
The main provisions of this second
-form of lease were as follows:
| (1) The period of the lease was
for 6 years.
(2) The rates of Royalty fixed
were :
For European Firms , with a few ex-
ceptions,
Rs. 10 for 3 Pikat logs and over.
Rs. 6 for all smaller 100-s.
O
Jr or Loan Lessees cne Royalty rates
were correspondingly Rs. 12 and Rs. 8.
T -B.—(The average cubic content
of a 3 Pikat log is approximately 38
cubic feet.)
The rates of Duty were:—
Ticals 3.26 per log of 3 pikat size
and over.
Ticals 0.80 on all smaller loirs.
(3) Penalties were imposed for
allowing timber to be burnt or damaged
by fire, either in the leased area or in
transit.
(4) Logs had to be hammer-mark-
ed by the Forest Department before be-
ing put into any floating stream.
(5) Logs felled, which the lessee
did not wish to extract, had to be mark-
ed with a Rejection hammer and noti-
fied to the Forest authorities, who could
then sell or remove them.
(6) Timber had to be supplied to
the Forest Department on demand, at
certain rates fixed according to export
prices.
(7) The following were the chief
rules’ regulating the felling of teak
trees :
(a) No trees to be felled ex-
cept those already girdled or naturally
dead and dry, under penalty. As has
been already explained, this was sub-
sequently changed and modified in most
leases.
(b) No trees to be felled higher
than 3' from the ground, except in the
case of hollow trees, under penalty.


(c) Injury to forests in felling
trees to be avoided.
(d) Logging to be done in such a
way as to attain the maximum yield of j
timber per log.
(8) It was forbidden to sell or
mortgage the lease to any other person,
but the lessee was entitled to grant a
permit to any duly approved person,
or persons, to work the leased area under
the terms of the agreement;, upon pay-
ment of a registration fee of Rs. 300 for
each such permit.
Originally the Duty station had
been fixed at Chainat on the Menam
Chao Phya, but, as this was found to be
too far from the forests, a new station
was opened at Paknampo, near the con-
fluence of the Me Ping and Me Yom
Rivers, in B. E. 2441 (1898-1899). By
this time the principle was clearly esta-
blished that the European firms should
pay both Royalty and Duty on their
teak logs on their arrival at the Duty
station, whereas the local lessees should
pay Royalty on the spot and Duty sub-
sequently, on arrival of their logs at
Paknampo.
Another Duty station was establish-
ed at Kado on the Salween River, four
miles north of Moulmein, for the collec-
tion of dues on logs floated down
from the western areas of Siam, in B. E.
2442 (1899-1900).
From the time of the establishment
of the Royal Forest Department, the
Government gradually asserted its sove-
reign rights over the teak forests
of Northern Siam, and the Lao Chiefs
and their descendants were assigned the
position of co-sharers ih the profits of
the forests, but with no administrative
control over the management. From
the years B. E. 2439 and B. E. 2440
(1896-1898) the collection of Royalty
and Duty was entirely taken over'by the
Forest Department, the Government
guaranteeing the Chiefs against any
loss of revenue thereby. Far from any
loss being incurred, there was an
diate large increase of 250%. Up to the
year B. E. 2448 (1905-1906) the Forest
Department was responsible for the pay-
ment of the shares due to the Lao
Chiefs, but in that year this duty was
taken over by the Ministry of Finance?
though the Forest Department still con-
tinued to assess the various amounts
payable and to collect the actual Reven-
ue as before.
Since the establishment of Govern-
ment control there has been a gradual
decrease in the leased areas controlled
by local lessees, and a corresponding in-
crease in those controlled by the timber
firms. This has been due to the diffi-*"
culties experienced by local lessees,
first, owing to lack of capital (other
than elephants) with which to pay their
working expenses and Royalty—a diffi-
culty which became very acute in bad
years —and, secondly, owing to the lack
of an assured and ready market for their
timber. The advent of the timber firms
had the effect of not only inducing the
local lessees to sell their timber to such
firms, but in most cases to make over
their rights to them in return for pecu-
niary considerations, by granting the
firms sole permits to work their areas,
with the right to apply for renewal of
the lease in their own name. This ar- ]
rangement has been to the great mutual j
advantage of both parties, and at the j
present time about 85% of the total area j
of the teak forests is controlled by the j
timber firms, and 15% by local lessees,
including a very small area of forests
worked departmentally by the Gov-
ernment, at present 1% of the total
area. I


From, the year B.E. 2439 to the
year 13. E. 2451 the main achievements
of the Royal Forest Department in Nor-
thern Siam may be shortly summarized
as follows :
(a) The teak forests were placed
under a regular system of leases.
(b) In these leased areas the yield
was to some extent regulated and the
interests of the forest property safe-
guarded, by controlling the girdling, by
.fixing a minimum exploitable girth, and
by imposing other salutary measures.
t, (e) The revenue from the forests
was largely increased by raising the
royalty rates, by more regular collec-
tion of dues, by better supervision and
by more systematic exploitation.
E (d) Many disputes with regard to
.leased areas were settled.
SSL
j,' (e) The ownership of a very large
|mumbei of logs in dispute was deter-
mined, and the Royalty on such logs
collected.
,
(f) The exploitation and traffic in
small under-sized trees was stopped.
■P Co) The theft of timber in transit
Was very much reduced.
If (h) A considerable amount of ex-
plorati on and exploratory mapping was
done by the forest staff, and at the same
time a certain amount of notes and ob-
servations on the contents and condition
of various forests were recorded.
(i) dhe whole of the teak zone in
Jporthern Siam was divided up into
Forest Divisions, and in each Division a
certain number of Sub-Divisions were
The staff was divided up
stationed according to the work in-
volved. Buildings were erected from
jfear to year as funds permitted.
I 0) A certain amount of trade in
other woods was encouraged and deve-
loped.
In B. E. 2451 (1908-1909), as many
of the existing teak leases were about to
expire, it was decided to take in hand
the complete reorganization of the lease
system.
Arising out of old customs and as a
result of various bargains and arrange-
ments made with the Lao Chiefs and
local lessees generally, the timber firms
controlled a large number of leased
areas scattered irregularly all over the
northern country, and many of these
areas were extremely small and isolated.
Such a state of affairs was uneconomic
to a degree, and it also made inspection
and control by the Forest Staff more
difficult and expensive.
Again, the h elling-Cycle of 12 years
in all was invariably found to be too
short, with the result that the timber
firms were constantly asking the Gov-
ernment for extensions of time and
also for sanction to girdle more green
trees.
The new scheme provided for :
(1) The exchange of forests be-
tween the various lessees and the open-
ing of most of the forests hitherto
closed, so as to allow the re-grouping
and consolidation of former numerous
small leases into a few leases of laro-e-
-areas and compact form.
(2) The division of the leased
aieas into 2 halves of approximately
equal productiveness ; one half to be
closed, and the *other half opened for
15 years, thus fixing the Felling-Cycle
foi the entire area at 30 years instead
of at 12 years, as hitherto.
(o) The Royalty to be raised on
full sized logs from Rs. 10 to Ticals
12 per log.


This reorganization was success-
fully carried through, in spite of many
difficulties and delays, and proved of
great advantage to all parties concern-
ed. It caused a reduction in the work-
ing expenses of the lessees. It enabled
them <-0 look much further ahead, and
thus to estimate their revenue and ex-
penditure with much greater certainty
than before. The Siamese Government
gained by the increase in Royalty and
by the greater ease of control and in-
spection. The whole industry was placed
on a better and surer basis, and the
causes of friction between the Forest
Department and the timber firms were
lessened to a very great degree.
Ihe number of leases was largely
reduced bv these new arrangements.
Up to 1909 the number of leases
in force had varied from 83 to 105,
but thereafter the total number was
reduced to 40.
The following European and Chi-
nese firms were the principal lessees
under these 15 year leases, the remain-
ing areas being held by Lao Chiefs and
local lessees.

Under these 15 year leases all trees
above 6' 4J" girth at breast height
were to be girdled and felled, with the
exception of certain trees reserved as
seed-bearers and for other sylvicultural
purposes, no definite number of such
trees being fixed. The selection and
girdling of the teak was done by the
staff of the timber firms under the
general inspection of the Forest Depart-
ment. In the local leases the selection
and girdling of the trees was done by
Forest Officers, and the exploitable'girth
was fixed at V.
The full number of trees to be
girdled was selected throughout the*
leased areas, and the whole stock was
then girdled within a period of 4 or
5 years. The disadvantages of "this
method of procedure were very apparent
in after years, owing to the considerable
percentage of dead and dry teak trees
destroyed by forest fires and other
agencies, before they could be exploited
by the lessees concerned, and also by
the loss of growth increment consequent
upon the trees standing for years in the
forests in a dead and dry condition
awaiting felling.
The main provisions of this first 15
year lease were as follows :
(1) The period of the lease was
for 15 years.
(2) Royalty rates fixed for the great
majority of the leases were:—
Rate per log.
Logs 3 pikat size and above Tics. 12
Smaller logs. ... ... Tics. 6
Logs below 11 sole in length
(17' 101"). ... ... Tics. 4 :


Elepliant dragging a teak log.
Klepinints ‘ounging’ and dragging teak logs.


Logs below 11 sok in length
gL I1( j smaller than the 2 pikat
mL, ••• ••• ... Tics. 2
W (3) Penalties were provided for
lli&ak trees damaged in felling or by fire,
either in the leased area or in transit.
wm (4) Dogs were to be marked with a
I Jianuner supplied by the Forest Depart-
HLent before being put into a floating
■feream.
(5) Dogs rejected by the lessee to
Ijbe hammer-marked with a special ham-
jpier and handed over to the Forest De-
fcpartment for disposal.
Wk, ( 6) Teak to be supplied for Gov-
ernment purposes at cost prices of
■praction and delivery along the main
Banes of export.
(7)
E (a) All teak above G'4J-" girth
E at breast height to be girdled
K excepting certain classes of
fk trees reserved for sylvicultural
I
purposes.
|| (b) No tree to be felled above 3'
II from the ground except hollow
K trees.
E I (c) No unnecessary damage in
11 felling.
HI (d) No teak timber to be convert-
ed in the forest.
! Wt. ( e ) Dogging to be done so as to
■ produce the maximum amount
per log.
lit (8) The same regulations regard -

U (9) The boundaries of the leased
' Hp «ind the closed half area were speci-
I p* Di general terms at the end of the
eaM 8 according to natural boundaries.

P 8 done.
I (Speaking generally, the Royalty
on first-class logs were increased
by 20% under these leases. Rat.es on
other classes of logs remained the same.
Rates of duty were unchanged.
Owing to the various changes in
the rates of Royalty which had occurred
from time to time, considerable compli-
cations arose about the large numbers
i of teak logs arriving at Paknampo,
j charged at various rates of Royalty. .J n
I the case of many logs, the original
| liammer-marks had worn off or be-
! come so faint as to be illegible ; thus
grave doubts arose as to the correct
amounts due on many logs, and there was
danger of the Government losing large
sums of revenue thereby. After pro-
tracted negotiations these questions
were finally settled by compromise
in the year B. E. 2454 (1911-12).
In B. E. 2461 (1918), some six
years before the expiry f the then ex-
isting leases, the question of the
organisation of the new 15 year leases
in the closed half areas began to be con-
sidered.
After lengthy negotiations the fol-
lowing main principles were laid down:
(1) The girdling of the trees for
the first time to be undertaken by the
Forest Department, who would charge
the lessees one Tical per tree, except in
the western areas comprising the Sal-
ween and part of the Baheng Divisions,
where the timber firms would still
continue to do the work.
A special Girdling Division to be
established with a staff to carry out this
work.
(2) In the case of the European
firms, the exploitable girth to be fixed
on a sliding scale with 6' BJ-" as the
average, above which trees were to be
girdled. In the case of the local
lessees, the exploitable girth to be fixed
at 7' as before.


(3) In all leases, up to 6% of the
I total number of exploitable trees to be
; reserved, the best and soundest trees to
* be selected for this purpose. In addi-
| tion, seed-bearers and other trees
might be reserved for sylvicultural
I purposes.
(4) Each leased area, for the pur-
s' poses of forest control, to be divided
into three compartments or coupes, and
I the lessee to be permitted to exploit
1 each coupe within 4 to 6 years. The
if lessee to be bound to complete the ex-
Iploitation of one coupe, before starting
I work in another coupe.
(5) Royalty to be collected accord-
ill jpg to the cubic capacity of the logs and
Ipthe class of timber, not simply per log
[lit* hitherto, and payment of Duty to be
mm Risked. The average Royalty to be
■led at Tcs. 12.50 per ton of 50 cubic
jpeet. Forests more difficult to work than
tin average, or of worse general quality
than the average, to be assigned a lower
fmte of Royalty, whereas more easily
■priced and better forests were to be
■feigned a higher rate. As the metric
: system has now been introduced into
jjjam, all figures in the present leases
Bp he converted from English into metric
■Measurements.
jh It was originally intended to girdle
jjproug'h the new leased areas as quickly
Ip possible, following the old practice,
fortunately, the great defects of this,
Rliich have been already described, were
jfblly realized, and it was found possible
B° orange the system to one of deferred
S' idling. Under the present arrange-
gpcnt, girdling proceeds through the
forest keeping a few years ahead of the
jPSsee’s working. The wishes of the
Various lessees are complied with as far
possild e, so that the actual practice
paries slightly.
Uepartmental girdling operations
started in B. E. 2462 (1919), and have
been going on yearly ever since. Most
of the new leases came into force on Ist
June B. E. 2467 (1925), and the num-
ber of new leases now in force is 40.
The main provisions of the present
leases are:—
(1) Period of the lease is 15 years..
(2) Rates of Royalty.
The standard rates of Royalty fixed
for average forests are:—
Tcs. Tcs.
per ton perc.m.
(a) Ist class logs of
40 cubic feet (1.13 cubic
metres) or over, and 18'
(5.49 metres), or over
in length ... ... 12.50 '8.83
(b) 2nd class logs
under 40 cubic feet
(1.13 cubic metres),and
18' (5.49 metres) or
over in length ... 8 5.65
(c) 3rd class logs
under 18' (5.49 metres)
in length ... ... 5 353
These rates are increased or de-
creased within certain limits, according
to the difficulty of working the forests
or other circumstances, as already
mentioned.
(2) At the end of the 2nd, 7th and
12th yeai, if the Minister controlling*
the forest areas is satisfied that the
Bangkok price for rough timber or rafts
of average quality at such time is over
lo pikat, and if the price continues to be
so for a reasonable time, he may, after
the close of the year, increase the rates
on Ist class logs by approximately 21%.
But if, at any time after increasing the
rates as above, the Minister is satisfied
that the price has dropped to 15 pikat
or below, he shall decrease the rates to
the original figure, but mav increase


them again within one month from the
beginning of the next period as laid
down.
(3) The felling and logging me-
thods have been improved by binding
the lessees to use saws for fellino- wher-
possible and in all cases for cross-
cutting trees. No tree except hollow
trees may be felled higher than 2' from
the ground.
(4) Logging must be done so as to
produce the largest possible out-turn of
reasonably sound and straight full-size
timber.
(5) As soon as possible after De-
cember Ist in each year, the lessee
undertakes to break up all stacks of
logs from his leased areas, which may
have formed in any floating stream.
Other important new features have
already been mentioned and therefore
will not be repeated. For the rest,
most of the ordinary clauses and penal-
ties mentioned in the first 15 year
lease are repeated in the present
lease.
The present leases obviously re-
present a great advance and improve-
ment on former leases from the point
of view of the forests. As so; many
new features h?ive been introduced, it is
not possible as yet to make further com-
ments (sufficient experience not having
been gained), remembering that it
takes about five years on the average
for a teak log to reach Bangkok from
the time when it was felled.
On the 7th April B.E. 2464 (1921)
the Royal forest Department was trans-
ferred from the control of the Ministry
of the Interior to that of the Ministry of
Lands and Agriculture.
At present, in B. E. 2470 (1927),
the staff in Northern Siam stands as
follows :

CHAPTER IV.
System of Management together with
various Statistical Information.
A. General System of Working.
The teak forests of Northern Siam
have been, and are being, worked accord-
ing to felling schemes based on the
Brandis Selection System of Burma.
This system was evolved many
years ago by the late Sir Dietrich
Brandis in order to introduce some sys-
tem of regular working, and also some
control of the yield or output, in the
teak forests of Burma. The latter are
approximately similar in type to the
Siamese teak forests and, moreover, the
general conditions of exploitation and
other factors closely resemble those pre-
vailing in Northern Siam.
The general principles involved in
this system of forest-working may now
be briefly described :
(i) Girth-classes for the teak trees
are fixed. In Burma they are generally
arranged as follows:—Class I, trees of
7' girth and above at breast height ;
Class 11, trees from 6' to 7' girth; Class
111, trees from 4' 6" to 6' girth ; Class
IV, trees from 3' to 4' 6" girth ; Class
V, trees of 3' girth and below.
(ii) Enumeration of the teak trees
in each forest is carried out, either over
the entire forest or over a proportion of
the forest, the object being to find out
the number of trees in the different
girth-classes, and more especially the
number of those in classes I, II and 111.
(iii) It is then necessary to find out
the average number of years in which
the smallest trees in class II will rise to
class I. As the teak tree produces one
Well-defined ring for every year’s
growth, the average rate of growth can
be found out by measuring the radius
of a stump and counting the number of
rings along the radius.
(iv) The period of time needed for
all the trees in class II to rise to class
I is called the Felling-Cycle, and in
Burma, nowadays, this is usually fixed
at 30 years.
(v) Theoretically, if the teak forest
in question is in a normal condition,
felli ngs can pass over the entire forest
in 30 years, during which time all trees
in class I can be removed at the annual
rate of 1 /30th of the total number, ex-
cept such large trees as are needed to
be kept as seed-bearers and for other
sylvicultural purposes. At the end of
this Felling-Cycle of 30 years, the forest
should be in the same condition as be-
fore, perhaps in an even better condition,
because all the trees in class II will
have increased in girth during the 30
years and entered class I ; and thus be
ready for cutting during the next Felling-
ln short, the object of the pro-
cess is to remove the current annual in-
crement of the forest, or the interest as
it may be called, and to leave the capital
entire or even augmented.
It is obvious that the point of most
immediate importance is that there
should be a considerably larger number
of trees in class II to take the place of
those in class I, allowing for the numer-
ous casualties which are bound to occur,
in the ordinary course of events, during
the lapse of many years.
Unfortunately, these mixed types of
teak forests are generally in an abnormal
condition, and contain an undue prepon-
derance-of class I trees, with a corres-
ponding deficit of class 11, and sometimes


even of class 111 trees. If, therefore,
the yield of the teak forest is to be
maintained in future generations, it is
necessary to make various calculations
and allowances, and to keep over a con-
siderable proportion of class I trees for
the next Felling-Cycle.
(vi) In the practical working of
this system in Burma, the forest is
divided up into a number of Sub-divi-
sions, or Sub-periodic Blocks, corres-
ponding to Sub-Divisions of the Felling-
Cycle. In each Block the trees are
selected, girdled and felled, and the
entire operation is completed before
passing on to the next block.
In order to increase the stock of
trees in the younger age classes, teak
plantations are also extensively made,
and sylvicultural operations are carried
out with the object of freeing the
younger trees from the masses of infe-
rior trees, bamboos, and other growths
which surround and threaten to suppress
them.
The teak forests of Northern Siam
may be said to have been placed bn a
basis of thorough and systematic ex-
ploitation with the reorganization of the
system of leases in the year B. E. 2451
(1909).
With this reorganization, an adap-
tation of the Brandis Selection System
was embodied in the lease.
Each forest was divided into two
halves of equal teak productiveness,
as far as could be approximately esti-
mated.
A Felling-Cycle of 30 years was
adopted, as it was assumed that the
-average rate of growth of the teak tree
in Northern Siam was about the same as
in Burma.
In the first half lease period of 15
years, in all forests leased to European
companies, which represent about 85°/
of the total area, all trees above 6'4i"
in girth at breast height were selected,
girdled and felled, and in all forests
leased to local lessees and Depart-
mentally worked, this exploitable girth
was fixed at 7'. Seed-bearers and
other trees above 6' 4J" in girth,
required for sylvicultural purposes, were
reserved.
In the second half lease period of
15 years, now just begun, the exploit-
able girth of the tree has been raised to
6'B-J" in the case of all areas leased to
European companies, and up to 6% of
the best and soundest class 1 trees are
being reserved. As in the first half
areas, seed-bearers and sylvicultural
trees are also being reserved. In
the local leases and Departmentally
worked forests the exploitable girth has
remained at 7' .
In addition, each area has been sub-
divided into three sub-periodic Blocks,
or coupes, and each of these has to be
completely worked out in 4 to 6 years
before passing on to the next coupe.
No actual enumerations have . been
carried out, except, of course, in the
case of all class I trees ; but esti-
mates of other classes have been made
during girdling operations.
The Siamese teak forests are ab-
normal, in that they contain too large a
proportion of over-mature trees and too
small a proportion of class II and class
111 trees. This was, unfortunately,
not clearly foreseen, and the effect of
the rather low minimum girths fixed in
the early leases has been, that not only
the interest, but a part of the capital of
the forests as well, has been annually

in the not distant future must be a con-
siderable reduction in both the timber
and money yield of the forests, which
can only be restored after a long period
of recuperation.
B. Output of the Teak Forests in the
P ast -
The following table shows the total
number of teak logs extracted during the
past 30 years, since the establishment of
the Royal Forest Department,and floated
down the three rivers, the Menam Chao
Phya, the Salween and the Mekliong.
In addition, there are every year a
certain number of rejected logs, known
as “ rejections.” 'These are logs consi-
dered to be unmarketable by the lessees
and, as such, are left in the forests.
Wherever possible, these logs are dis-
posed of by the Forest Department by
means of local sales, but where there is
no demand these logs have to be aband-
oned. It is not possible to give accurate
information concerning such logs, and,
therefore, they are omitted.

Total

The total number of teak log's ex-
tracted and floated down these three
rivers during the past 30 years is
3,454,924. As previously mentioned,
this does not quite represent the total
output of teak in Siam, because a cer-
tain number of rejected logs are
sold locally every year all over the
Northern Siamese teak zone, and these
have been omitted from this statement.
Some of the best “rejections” are
brought down by the Forest Department
and sold at Paknampo.
The average annual number of
logs brought down the Menam Chao
Pliya to Paknampo and Bangkok in the
past has been 92,984,* similar figures
for logs brought down the Salween
River to Moulmein are 18,827, and
down the Mekhong River to Saio-on
6,707.
The total average annual production
of teak for the whole of Siam during
the last 15 years has thus been 111,620
logs, excluding rejections. It is to be
noted that no logs from Siam were
floated down the Mekhong River before
1911-12.
The following statement shows the
estimated average cubic content of each
log brought down the Menam Chao
1 hya for the past 15 years, and the mea-
sured average cubic content of each
log floated down the Salween and
Mekhong Rivers. In the case of the
Salween, the figures are for the last two
years only. The average amounts of
Royalty and Duty, levied by the Siamese
Government on each log, during the
above-mentioned periods are also
given :

This indicates that the Northern
Siamese teak forests have produced a
jfcjet profit of about 31| million Ticals
during the past 30 years’ working, from
the teak alone, excluding all other
sources of revenue, or, on the average,
a million ticals per annum.

Note on the Valuation of
Teak by Pikat.
Pikatis a unit for teak logs depend-,
*ing on a ratio of size to value. In meas-
uring logs the usual practice .is to
take the length of the log.in.‘wa’ and
<sok,’ four ‘sole’ being equal to one ‘wa’,,
arid the girth, round the middle of the
fog, in ‘-karri*. In taking the girth,'how-
ever, the cane used for measuring is bent
in two after the measurement is made,
and the ‘karri* counted off on the bent
cane, so that the number of ‘kam’ so
found actually represents only half the
circumference of the log. The length
of a ‘wa’, as used by timber traders,,
varies, with the locality and according
to arrangement between buyer and seller,
from 78 to 80 inches, and the ‘kam’
from 4~ to inches. The standard ‘wa’
generally used for selling teak logs is
80 English inches, and the standard
‘kam’ inches.
How the value of a log is arrived at
is most readily shown by tables, two of
which are subjoined. The first table
gives the pikat value of logs measuring"
4 to 10 ‘sok’ in length, and 4 to 16 ‘kam’
in (half) girth. The second table gives
the pikat value of logs from 3 to 9 ‘wa’
in length, and from 5 to 16 ‘kam’ in
(half) girth. If it is required to .kno\tf
the value of a log measuring 7 ‘wa’ by :
8 ‘kam’ sold at 10 pikat, turn to table II
and look down the 7 ‘wa’ column and
along the 8 ‘kam’ line until they meet.
The resulting figure, 12, gives the value
in ticals for one pikat of that log; the-
price of the log is, therefore, 120 ticalsi

CHAPTER V.
Exploitation and Transport.
A. Section and Girdling.
The first thing to do is to select the
trees to be exploited and to girdle them.
In the leases which recently expired
the greater part of the selection and
girdling was done by the lessees under
the supervision of the Forest Depart-
ment, but under the present leases,
which have recently come into operation,
this work, with few exceptions, is being
carried out by the Department itself.
The selection and girdling are done
by organized parties, each party being-
under the immediate control of a o-ird-
D
ling clerk. The first procedure is to ex-
plore and make a rough sketch-map
of the whole leased area under operation,
and especially to mark the course of
the creeks and waterways. Having
done this, the next step is to divide up
the whole area into sections and sub-
sections, according to the natural fea-
tures of the ground and the course of the
streams. Each section is denoted on the
map by a capital letter, and each sub-
section by a number in addition.
The area is then gone through
systematically from end to end, and
each tree above a certain fixed girth at
breast-height, selected for felling, is
measured and marked with a deep blaze
on the bole. On this blaze are stamped
(a) a girdling hammer-mark, (b) below
this, the section letter and sub-section
number, and (c) at the bottom, the serial
number of the tree. A similar blaze is
made on the buttress at the base of the
tree, and the same information is stamp-
ed thereon. All these essential data are
entered in a girdling-register.
The selected tree is then girdled,
this being effected by cutting a complete
ring round the bole of the tree at 1' 6"
to 2' from the ground, through the outer
and inner bark into the wood. The
breadth and depth of this ring vary
between 4" and 5". The effect of cut-
ting through the inner bark is to
arrest the downward flow of elaborated
sap to the roots, and this gradually kills
the entire tree, which slowly dries up
and eventually remains standing in a%
completely dry condition. The minimum
period required to kill a teak tree in this
manner is two years, and some trees do
not attain a completely dry condition till
three years have elapsed. When the tim-
ber is dry, it has the property of floating
buoyantly in water; and, as very nearly
all the output from the teak forests in
Northern Siam is transported by water,
all exploitable trees must first be girdled.
Besides the trees selected and
giidled for exploitation, a certain per-
centage of trees above the exploitable
girth limit are retained for sylvicultural
purposes, such as seed-bearing ; these
trees are marked with a large letter S
painted in tar on their boles. Similarly,
under the new leases in force at present,
up to 6% of the total number of trees
selected for girdling may be retained as
reserved trees, and for this purpose the
best and soundest timber is chosen.
These trees are marked with a laro-e R
in tar on their boles.
B. General.
When lessees take-over their areas,
they usually proceed to explore and
make sketch maps on a fairly large
scale of the most important teak-bearing
tracts pvitli compass and chain and plane-
table methods of survey. They then

proceed to organize the exploitation
work, either by means of contractors or
by working out the timber themselves.
As a rule, both systems are employed.
C. Felling, Logging and Dragging.
Labour for felling, logging and
dragging is organised and housed in
regular camps, each camp being under
the immediate control of a headman and
deputy headman. In former vears such
labour was largely recruited from the
Khamu, a hard-working jungle people,
skilled in all kinds of forest labour
and inhabiting parts of French Indo-
China, who were brought over to work
on contract terms. Nowadays, this sup-
ply is becoming scarcer every year, and
the people available locally, such as the
Lao, Shan, and Karen, are becoming
more and more employed for this kind
of work.
Felling-work sometimes starts in
the dry, hot months, but is chiefly
carried on right through the rainy
season. As the trees to be felled are
standing in a perfectly dry condition,
they are somewhat brittle and liable to
break and split when brought down in
felling; it is, therefore, sometimes ad-
visable to lop off the largest branches
before proceeding to fell the tree. Dur-
ing the. rains the soft ground and mud
greatly assist in reducing the risk of
damage.
o
Formerly felling work was done
entirely with the axe, but under the
present leases trees are felled with cross-
cutting saws to reduce wastage, the axe
being used as an auxiliary tool to cut on
the side on which the tree is to fall. No
stump is permitted to be higher than 2'
from the ground, except in the case of
unsound trees.
Labour engaged in felling works in
gangs, and in these gangs the axemen
work in pairs. Each pair can fell from
3 to 5 trees a day according to size and
other circumstances. As soon as the
tree is felled, the branches are sawn off
and trimmed flush with the bole ; the
trunk is also completely barked. It
is then examined by the lessee’s
representative who marks it into
lengths for logging, and it is cross-
sawn at these points and converted into
logs. As soon as these are readv, they
are carefully examined and all unsuit-
able logs known as “rejections” are
discarded. During the period of the past
15 year leases it was generally found,
under the system of logging then pre-
vailing, that 9 teak trees produced 10
logs.
If the spot at which the logs are
lying is a difficult one, the next step is
to bring up elephants who slowly push
the logs end on with their foreheads,
and generally manoeuvre them down to
a situation whence the logs can be
dragged. Block and tackle are often
used to assist in this operation.
lor the purposes of dragging, drag-
holes are cut at either end, and one end
of each log is “snouted” or rounded
off, so as to enable it to slip : along
easily in the mud. According to the
size of the log to be dragged, one or
more elephants are harnessed to the
“ snouted end, by passing a chain
through the drag-hole. If more than
one elephant is employed, the animals
are harnessed either tandem-fashion
or in line, according to circumstances.
The logs are usually dragged for-
ward by elephants, in stages of about
1,000 yards each, from the stump or


dragging point, as the case may be, to
the delivery point, which is situated
either on the banks of a floating stream
or on a cart-road. The number of stages
depends on the total length of the drag,
and at the end of each stage the logs
being dragged forward are accumulated
at a temporary depot, where they are
again examined and any “rejections”
eliminated before they pass on to the
next depot.
At the delivery point the final exam-
ination takes place. Each log passed
or accepted is carefully measured, and
its cubic content and other details re-
corded in the lessee’s registers. The
passed logs are then hammered all over
with the special hammer designed for
the particular lease area in Avhicli the
log was produced, and a large shallow
maik oi device is cut at the centre of
the log with axes, which at once easily
distinguishes it as being the property of
the particular lessee. If the delivery
point is on the banks of a floating stream,
the logs are dragged and placed in the
bed of the creek to await the arrival of
the next rise of water to carry them
down on their long journey southwards.
In the teak region of Siam elephants
are the only animals employed in drag-
ging logs ; buffaloes are never thus
employed, in contrast to Burma, Avhere
buffalo dragging is a highly developed
practice of long standing.
formerly carting was little practis-
ed, but nowadays the use of carts is
almost universal, with the result
that the amount of dragging necessary-
is diminishing gradually every year, and
the total lengths of drags are being
steadily reduced. At the present time,
it is uncommon to find a total drag-
length of over 4 miles, or 6J kilometres.
On level or slightly undulating
ground dragging can be accomplished
with ease and rapidity. The main drag-
ging-paths are quickly laid out and all
obstacles are cut down or removed to a
breadth of about 4 feet. Stout cross-pieces
or sleepers are then laid down across
the paths at a distance of 4 or 5 feet
apart, to facilitate the passage of the
logs. In addition to the rider, eacli ele-
phant is accompanied by a footman
whose duty is to see that each cross-*
piece is in its proper position.
In hilly, rugged and broken coun-
tr y> dragging is often a heavy and
difficult operation. In such localities,
as the logs have usually to be conveyed
both up and down steep slopes, the lay-
ing out and construction of the drag-
ging paths often entails much skill and
labour. Such dragging-paths are really
small wet-slides, or shallow troughs full
of mud and Avater. After drao’jHno’ the
logs up the ascents, the elephants are
unharnessed and proceed to push and
slide the logs down the descents by
their own weight, until they reach level
or ascending ground Avhere they have
again to be dragged onwards.
D. Carting.
It is probable that the most striking
change in the methods of teak extraction
has been the universal opening up of
Northern Siam by means of cart-tracks
during the past 20 years or so, and the
ever-increasing quantities of teak logs
carted every year.
Carting can only take place during
the dry months of the year. It usually
starts in December or January ; and con-
tinues steadily until the beginning of
the rains. The logs are carted from the
delivery point to the nearest floating

stream or creek. The work is almost
invariably carried out by local contrac-
#
tors, and these men either repair the
existing tracks or, if none exist, lay out
new tracks and construct the necessary
bridges. Across deep creeks or gullies
they often construct rustic bridges of
considerable size and strength, made of
jungle timbers lashed securely together
with canes and creepers.
Carting work is entirely in the hands
of the local people, chiefly Lao. The
carts used are of the simplest pattern,
consisting of a pair of small wooden
wheels joined by an axle, above which
is a strong block of wood on which the
log rests while in transit, together with
shafts and yoke attached of the ordinary
types.
When removing long teak logs, the
log is gradually lifted and several carts
placed under it at intervals along its
entire length, each cart being tightly
lashed to the log and fastened to the
next with heavy iron chains. The
draught animals are harnessed to the
last cart at the end of the I 02:.
The cartmen display great skill and
ingenuity in hoisting the logs on to the
carts. Small or moderate-sized los;s
are lifted with crowbars and levers,
while heavy bulky logs are usually
hoisted up on crib-works, built to a
height where the carts can be easily
slipped under the logs.
Buffaloes are usually employed as
draught animals, bullocks less frequent-
ly, as they have not sufficient weight
and strength, although they are much
hardier animals. As many as 8 to 10
pairs of buffaloes may be employed on
occasion, and the work is always of a
heavy and arduous nature, especially
in the dry, hot months, owing to the
deep dust covering the tracks and to the
prevailing heat and drought.
In North-Eastern Siam the valley
of the Me Ing is noted for its flat and
swampy nature, and in this tract of
country the French firm, La Compagnie
Est-Asiatique Franqaise, has success-
fully introduced carts, generally known
as “ high wheels.” The characteristic
features of such carts are their enor-
mous wheels and the corresponding
height of the axles from the ground.
The logs are attached and transported
under the axles of the carts.
The advantages which these “ higli-
wheels ” possess over other forms of
carts, when used on flat ground, are: —
(i) The ease and speed with which
a log can he picked up and attached
below the axle, by merely reversing the
shaft. With trained men the whole work
of raising and attaching a log to the cart
can be done in 15 minutes.
(ii) The low centre of gravity.
(iii) The speed of transport, due
to the large wheel circumference.
This form of cart is not used in any
other teak forest in Siam, and was
specially designed by Chains, a tribe of
Malay descent brought from Kratie, a
town in Indo-China on the Me Khong
River.
E. Transport by Water.
(i) General.
In Northern Siam the floating sea-
son usually lasts from June to the end
of October, sometimes rather longer.
The best months for floating are August,
September and October. The actual
period is always liable to variations.


The general character of the rivers and
streams for floating purposes is un-
certain and difficult, due partly to the
fact that the catchment areas of the
main rivers (except the ,Me Khong and
the Salween) are situated within the
limits of Northern Siam, and are there-
fore fed by the local rains and not
by snow water, and perhaps also, partly
to the great local denudation of some of
the catchment areas by shifting cultiva-
tion. There is also a wide-spread opin-
ion that the number of floating days in
each season is gradually diminishing,
but whether this is due to some climatic
cycle or to other reasons is not possible
to determine.
Nowadays it is an accepted fact that
some of the larger floating creeks have
deteriorated during the past 30 or 40
years, and this has been due to the con-
stant passage of vast numbers of teak
logs which, in the absence of regular
river-training, have worn away the
banks by constant attrition, and thus
caused the creeks to become much
broader and shallower. In short, the
whole character of such creeks has been
changed and in some cases also the
actual course of the creek has shifted,
so much so that examples are occurring
where logs, which have lain for many
years, have to be taken out and carted
or conveyed by some kind of mechanical
traction to the main rivers.
The general transport by waterfalls
naturally into three portions. The first
comprises the journey which the logs
have to take down the numerous side
creeks and tributaries into the main
rivers; the second portion of the journey
is that taken by the logs down the main
rivers to the rafting station, and the
third and final stage is from the rafting
station, where all the logs are caught
and made up into rafts, to their ultimate
destination.
At the beginning, the logs are placed
in the creeks, separated from each other
and parallel to the direction of the
stream. They then await the next “rise”,
or flood, to carry them onwards. As the
creeks are very tortuous and full of
obstructions, the logs constantly tend to
jam and pile up; it is, therefore, neces-
sary to divide up each creek into sections
and to organize in each section a camp,
consisting of men and trained elephants
who constantly patrol the banks, break
up the stacks, push the logs into
the stream and thus set the mass float-
ing down-stream again. This opera-
tion, known as “ ounging,” is carried
on throughout the floating season. This
work goes on down all side creeks and
tributaries till the logs reach the main
rivers; in these the accumulation of
logs is often enormous, and the work of
breaking up the jams and keeping the
logs moving downstream is often very
arduous and sometimes even dangerous.
At the end of the floating season,
when both the main rivers and the side
streams do not contain enough water to
float logs in, steps are taken to break up
all the stacks, to separate all the logs
and to straighten them out in the beds of
the streams. This is effected by parties
of men and elephants, the latter pulling
out the “key” logs and performing other
operations with wonderful skill and pre-
cision.
As soon as this has been done, the
next step is to organize a system of fire-
protection, because, owing to the fact
that the deciduous forests of Northern
Siam are visited by forest fires every


year, there is naturally considerable
risk from fire. The main rivers are di-
vided up into sections, and in each
section fire-guards are maintained during
the dry months till the beginning of the
rains. Fire-lines are burnt, and all in-
flammable matter along the banks and
round thje logs is destroyed.
4
From January onwards representa-
tives of the various lessees travel up-
stream ‘neaping,’ that is, taking a count
nf the numbers of their logs which are
lying in the beds of the main rivers.
(il) Rafting.
All the main rivers contain stret-
ches of rapids, rushing through narrow
gorges and filled with rocky obstruc-
tions, through which it is impossible for
rafts to pass. It is therefore necessary
that logs should float singly down the
rivers to certain localities below the
rapids where they can be caught, made
up into rafts, and conveyed to their des-
tinations.
In this manner logs travel singly
distances which vary from 100 to 250
miles, or from 160 to 400 kilometres.
The various rafting points on the main
rivers are as follows:—on the Salween,
Kyodan, which is situated by river about
70 miles, or 112 kilometres, north of
Moulmein ; on the Me Ping, Raheng,
which is situated by river 131 miles, or
210 kilometres, north of Paknampo, and
319 miles, or 510 kilometres, north of
Bangkok, and where the logs coming
down both the Me Ping and Me Wang
are caught and rafted ; on the Me Yom
the rafting points lie between Sawanka-
lok and Sukothai ; the former place is
situated by river 150 miles, or 240 kilo-
metres, north of Paknampo, and 337
miles, or 540 kilometres, north of Bang-
kok ; on the Me Nan the logs are caught
and rafted from Utaradit, situated by
river at a distance of 187 miles, or 300
kilometres, north of Paknampo and 375
miles, or 600 kilometres, north of
Bangkok.
The rafting business is entirely in
the hands of local families, who live
along the river banks in the various
localities where the rafts are made up ;
and who, having been engaged in this
business for generations from father to
son, are naturally very experienced and
skilled in such operations, possessing a
unique knowledge of the courses and the
behaviour of the rivers during the float-
ing season. It is noteworthy, in the
case of rafts coming down the Me Pin<r
Me Y6m and Me Nan, that one set of
raftsmen make up and bring down the
rafts as far as Paknampo, where, after
being paid off, they hand them over to
another set of men who take on the rafts
to the storage grounds above Bangkok,
or direct to the saw-mills at Bangkok as
required. Should the saw-mills be short
of timber, as may happen on occasion,,
the lessees send up launches to tow their
rafts quickly down to the mills.
The Me Ping and the Me Yom are
by far the two most important rafting
rivers, the number of logs passing down
them far exceeding those conveyed on
the three other rafting rivers.
The floating channel of the Me Ping
has the characteristics of being broad,
full of shallows and obstructions, and
the rise and fall of its flood-waters is
extremely changeable and at all times
uncertain. The rafts of teak logs
brought down this river are always
large, broad and rigid in pattern. Their
general shape resembles an elongated


turtle-shell. The largest logs are placed
in the centre; the greatest width contains
a row of 30 to 40 logs, and tRe total num-
ber of logs in a raft may amount to 400
and sometimes even to 450.
The rows of logs are all lashed
tightly together with canes passed
through the drag-holes, and every row
is similarly fastened to the row in front
•of it. In addition, long stout bamboos
are laid and tied down over each line of
drag-holes to maintain rigidity through-
out the width of the raft.
At either end, fore and aft, a “ float-
ing platform is made, consisting of
10 to 12 long, thin, straight logs, which
are specially and securely lashed toge-
ther. On the fore-end platform a large
forked pole is planted upright, which
serves as a rowlock in which to work a
paddle, but this may be omitted. On the
aft-end platform a large wooden post,
or capstan, is also securely planted up-
right. This is a very important item,
as both the steering and the general
control of the raft largely depend
upon it.
About the centre of the raft a hut
is built for the accommodation of the
«rew, and just in front of the aft-end
platform a large bamboo tripod ladder,
or look-out place, is erected, from 8 to
9 feet high, and the headman shouts
directions to the crew, and controls the
navigation of the raft from the top of
this ladder.
The crew consists of a headman, a
spare man working a paddle at the fore
end of the raft, two men at the capstan,
and two pole-men.
I he general steering and control of
the raft is done in the following manner.
Hie aft-end of the raft is swung to the j
right or left by one of the pole-men
jumping into the river with a lono- cane
cable, composed of 7 twisted canes, tied
to his pole. He drives the sharp end of
the pole into the bottom of the river and
clings on to it with all his might, until
he is dragged over by the raft, when he,
proceeds to swim down to another fav-
ourable spot and to repeat the operation.
The man at the capstan, in;the mean-
while, keeps the slack of the cable coiled
round the capstan and pays it out or
takes it in, as required. When stopping
the raft, both pole-men are engaged in.
hanging on to their poles in the water
and both capstan-men in managing the
cables. These operations require great
skill and experience, as can be realized
from the size and weight of the raft, and
they often cause great excitement.
Great experience is also needed to
choose the right time in which to take
down the rafts from Raheng to Paknam-
po, when the water conditions are most
favourable. The best seasons for raft-
ing are usually at the beginning and end
of the rains. With good water the jour-
ney usually takes from 3 weeks to a
month. Rafts can only travel by day
and are tied up at night. When moored
at night, the aft-end of the raft is secur-
ed by means of a row of short poles
driven firmly into the bed of the river,
and fastened to the raft by the usual
twisted cane cables.
On their way down the Me Ping the
raftsmen usually catch a number of
drift logs, which they attach to the out-
side edges of the raft, and thus bring
down to the Duty Station.
Rafting conditions down the Me
Yom are different from those prevailing
on the Me Ping. 4he channel is much
deeper and narrower, and the course of


the river is much more winding ; con-
sequently, the type of raft constructed
and its control in* transit is quite
different.
That used on the Me Yom is a long,
narrow, torpedo-shaped raft made up of
10 to 13 rows of logs, with 10 to 15
logs in each row, and the total number
of logs brought down in any one raft
does not exceed 200.
The logs are loosely lashed together
with canes, and no bamboo cross-pieces
are used. This looseness and lack of
rigidity enables the raft to negotiate the
many narrow bends and curves in the
river. At either end of each row of
logs a separate log is tied by one end,
leaving its other end floating free in the
water. These logs act as fenders to any
obstructions which the raft may meet
on its course down the river. When the
rafts are moored at night, these fenders
are reversed, the free end being tied up,
and the tied end set free, thus guarding
the raft when stationary from damage
by logs or other objects floating down
stream.
At the fore and aft ends, floating
platforms of long, thin, straight logs
are constructed. On the fore-end plat-
form two strong, forked posts are
planted upright, and serve as rowlocks
in which large paddles are worked,
while on the aft-end platform one strong
capstan is planted upright. The hut for
the accommodation of the crew is built
near the fore-end.
The usual crew consists of a head-
man, who takes his stand on the raft at
the fore-end and not on a look-out place,
two paddle-men working the large
wooden paddles which are really oars,
and one capstan-man and one pole-man
controlling the aft-end of the raft.
Thus the raft is controlled from
both ends, but the main control is by
the paddles at the fore-end. The con-
trol of the aft-end -is effected by the
pole-man, who is provided with a short
thick pole attached to a cane cable,
swimming quickly to the bank and plant-
ing his pole firmly in the ground, while
the capstan-man pays out or takes in
the slack of the cab!e as required. As
soon as the pole-man perceives that there
is no more slack to pay out, he dashes
into the water, swims downstream and
again fixes his pole into the bank further
down, to repeat the operation. Me
Yom rafts also travel only by day, and
with favourable conditions the journey
to Paknampo takes from 14 days to three
weeks.
All rafts, which fail to reach their
destination by the end of the floating
season, become stranded in the beds of
the rivers, and a guard of one or more
men has to be left on them, to protect
them against fire and theft, until the
next floating season starts.
All cane cables and cane lashings
have to be carefully watched, as they are
naturally subjected to great strain, and
in the case of stranded rafts every lash-
ing has to be renewed before the raft
can proceed down river in the following
year.
On arrival at Paknampo, Me Yom
rafts can proceed thence to Bangkok
without any alterations, but Me Ping
rafts have to be broken up and re-made
into smaller rafts of not more than 200
logs each, which are controlled chiefly
by paddles.
Taking an average for the whole of
the teak region of Northern Siam, it is
estimated that it takes a log from 4 to


5 years to travel from the spot where it
was felled to the storage grounds above
Bangkok or to Bangkok itself.
«
F. Special works carried out for the pur-
poses of facilitating teak extraction
and transport.
(i) River and Stream Control.
Clearance of rivers and Streams,
chiefly by means of blasting, takes place
every year in many parts of the teak
region. No very large scheme for river
training has ever been carried out, but
the following special works deserve
mention: —
Floating work on the Me Ing River
in North-Eastern Siam presents consider-
able difficulties which have necessitated
special measures being taken.
The river flows in a north-easterly
direction for a total distance of about 90
miles, or 144 kilometres, discharging
1 O O
into the Me Khong River.
In a good year floating work can be
carried on from June to the middle of
November, the best months being
August and September. The main
stream flows through swampy plains,
and the course of the river is feeble
owing to its low banks. On the lower
Me Ing, that is to say, in the portion
nearest the Me Khong, the river is deep
and floating is easy; but on the upper Me
Ing, that is, in that portion of the river
between the towm of Phayao and the
mouth of the Me Piim tributary, floating
is difficult, owing to the narrowness of
the river and the numerous obstructions
caused by local irrigation dams. To
avoid these obstacles, the lessees, La
Compagnie Est-Asiatique Frampaise,
have dug a canal for the passage of teak
logs, 200 metres long, parallel with the |
main river. |
The tributaries of the Me Ing pro-
vide a variety of floating problems. The
Me Tam is a small left batik tributary
with high banks, in which the “rises**'
only last as long as the rains which pro-
duce them. To overcome the delays
caused by the constant stranding of logs
in the bed of the stream, the lessees
have constructed a series of five tempo-
rary wooden dams from 3 to 6 metres
high, consisting of squared posts and
cross-pieces, covered with boarding.
With the onset of the rains, the water-
levels between the dams rise consider-
ably, and finally when great floods des-
cend the creek, the dams are completely
obliterated, leaving no traces. The
volume of water, thus stored up, causes
all the logs tying in the creeks to float
into the Me Ing with great ease and
rapidity.
A similar kind of problem present-
ed itself ,on the upper reaches of the
Me lak, another tributary. In this
case a large number of small temporary
bamboo dams or pallisades have been
constructed in a series across the creeks,
with the object of banking up the water
and thus increasing the force and vol-
ume of the’final large “ rise ” down the
stream.
The Me Piim is one of the largest
left bank tributaries of the Me Ing. Its
headwaters are formed by the junction
of two creeks, the Me Kao to the north
and the Me Hang to the south. The
courses of both creeks are swampy, and
the latter rises out of a large swamp. To
avoid the expense of constructing long-
cart-roads for the extraction of 100-g
leading to the Me Pum, six temporary
barrages have been constructed across
the Me Kao, and from a point below the
last barrage a canal has been dug, 3.7 *

miles, or 6 kilometres, in length, from
the Me Kao to the Me Hang. Again, to
facilitate the passage of logs lying at
the head of the Me Hang, another canal
has been dug across the swamp. By
these means, more than 30,000 Ws have
been floated easily and cheaply into the
Me Pum.
A Government Duty-Station having
been established at Ban Ten on the Me
Ing, near the junction of that river and
the Me Kliong, all teak rafts are Te-
quired to stop at this point for examin-
ation by the Forest Department, before
proceeding down the main river.
This has involved difficulties, owino;
to the violent currents produced at and
near the junction of the two rivers.
When both rivers are rising and falling
together, everything is normal, but
when the Me Ivhong is rising and the Me
Ing is falling, a violent back-water as-
cends the Me Ing, sweeping back the
rafts and sometimes breaking the steel
hawsers by which they are attached.
Conversely, when the Me Ing is in flood
and the Me Kliong is falling, a violent
current is produced in the opposite di-
rection.
To obviate mishaps, the lessees have
cut a canal, 80 metres in length, thereby
joining up by water the two ends of a
large horse-shoe bend in the course of the
Me Ing near its mouth. By this means
they have converted this horse shoe bend
into a calm back-water capable of stor-
ing as many as 25,000 teak logs.
To reduce the expense of excava-
tion, the canal was dug with a tapering
or wedge-shaped cross-section, and the
sloping sides were dug out in steps, each
step being 1 metre high and J metre
broad. The breadth of the canal at the j
top is 40 metres, and the total depth at
the centre is 15 metres. The work has
been completely successful, and the
action of the river keeps on enlarging
the cross-section of the canal, thereby
increasing its efficiency and utility.
Messrs. L. T. Leonowens Ltd. have
also constructed in recent years some
interesting temporary log dams in cer-
tain creeks of their leased forests, for
the purpose of piling up the flood waters.
If the dam breaks cleanly, the, volume
| and force of the final “ rise ” are greatlv
magnified thereby.
Such dams are built either singly
or in a series, and are placed in narrow
portions of the creeks, as close as possi-
ble to the timber to be moved, and as
far as possible from any stack of tim-
ber lying in the creek above the dam.
The construction of a dam of this
nature is briefly as follows.
Pairs of roughly-squared jungle-
wood logs are laid in the bed of the
stream. Each pair is added to the pair
lying below, the ends of the logs cross-
ing at right angles and being dovetailed
or slotted into one another, while the
opposite ends are buried in the banks.
The apex of the dam points upstream.
By means of such dams, from 1,000 to
2,000 logs lying in a single creek have
been moved distances up to 10 miles
with great force and rapidity.
(li) Overland Transport.
In recent years there have been de-
velopments of considerable interest and
magnitude in various methods of mecha-
nical transport, and the following is a
short account of some of the most im-
portant work of this nature.


I. The Anglo-Siam Corporation,
Ltd., for some years past have been ex-
ploiting the Phayao—Me Chune forests,
which are situated in a tract of country
forming the headwaters of the Me Ing
River. This river flows north-eastwards
into the Me Khong, but, as the timber
has to be extracted eastwards into the
Me Yom and thence floated south-
-4
wards to Bangkok, it lias been found
necessary to construct a logging railway
to accomplish this object.
This is a metre-gauge line 49.25
miles,K)r 78.8 kilometres long, with 24
lb. rails well laid on teak sleepers 6'
long, placed 10 to a rail length of- 21'.
Ihe line is ballasted with rock metal
or coarse gravel, and the necessary
bridges are of strong hardwood timber.
The line starts and runs westwards
from Miiang Pong on the banks of the
Me Yom, and at this place repair
shops and general work-shops have been
erected. The first rails are laid on the
banks of the river, where a slip-way has
been made so that logs on arrival can
be rolled straight off the trucks into the
water. A temporary dam is constructed
every year in the river, to provide suffi-
cient storage accommodation for the tim-
ber delivered during the dry season.
Immediately, on leaving the river,
the line has to ascend and climb over
the steep watershed between the Me Yom
and Me Ing drainage areas, and for the
first 8 miles it consists of a series of
embankments and cuttings, some as deep
as 25', with many sharp curves and
steep gradients, which for short dist-
ances are sometimes as much as 1 in 18
and even lin 16. At Kiw Dong Dam the
line reaches an altitude of about 600'
above Miiang Pong, and from this point
for the next 11 miles it starts to descend
with many sharp curves but- .easier
grades to the 19th mile, whence it has to
climb over another but smaller pass.
From the foot of this pass-to the end of
the line the nature of; the country is
much easier. .
Seven tank locomotives and 131
timber trucks are in use. One train is
usually made up of 1 locomotive and 8
trucks, carrying 7 logs. The line is in
full working throughout the year, Sun-*'
days excepted, and the average yearly
delivery is from 8,000. to 8,500 logs.
11. The Borneo Company Ltd. have
entered upon a lease to extract teak
growing in the Me Fang drainage area.
This valley drains into the Me Kok
River, which flows eastwards and north-
eastwards into the Me Kliong River on
the boundary of North-Eastern Siatn*.
but, as the timber has to be taken west-
wards over the water-shed into tlie Me
Ping, drainage area, it was found neces-
sary to construct the following works:
(a) A tramway, from the final deli-
very point in the forests to the top of
the watershed, 3.12 miles or 4.9 kilome-
tres in length. This is a .75 metre
gauge tramway with 16 lb. rails well laid
on 8" x 5" x 4'9" sleepers, spaced 2' cen-
tre to centre and well ballasted with
rock metal. The gradients are very
and many deviations and cut-
tings have had to be made. The steep-
est ascent is 1 in 11 for 1,000 yards,
and the steepest descent is 1 in 15 for
233 yards, down which the loaded trucks
have to be lowered by means of a wire-
rope and brake-drum.
The loaded trucks are drawn by
elephants who work from the beginning
of the rains to February, but the work


is hard and the animals baye-often.tovjbe •
rested and fed on special, rations. „
livery depends on the number of ele-
phants employed; 201ogs a day, hauled
by 18 elephants, is an average day’s
work and 2,500 logs is an average sea.-,
son’s delivery.
(b) From the highest point on the
watershed at the end of the tramway, a
chute or timber-slide conveys * the logs
down the steep slopes.. This slide is
1,000 yards long, has an average gradir
ent of 1 in 4J and falls 659' in 3,000'.
It runs through 3 cuttings, the deepest
of which is about 14', and there are A
curves in its course.
This chute is trough-shaped in sec-
tion, which is approximately 3' 3". deep’
and 6' 6" broad across the top. Heavy
Cross-pieces or small logs about 12" in
diameter, slightly hollowed out, are sunk
into the ground at intervals on which
the floor of the chute, consisting of
lengths of jungle-wood about 8"-9" in
diameter, is laid. These lengths are scar-
fed together and fastened with a wooden
pin, which goes through both lengths
either into the ground or into-the cross-
piece below. Large guard logs are
placed on each side of the floor, being,
held in place by being tied with either
canes or chains to strong posts driven
into the ground outside them.
The chute ends on level groitnd, and
the downward passage of the logs is
stopped by coming into contact with the
ground beyond thexhute, where they
are rolled and dragged to one .side by
elephants. A telephone is installed be-
tween the top and bottom of the chute,
to control the despatch of logs from the
top, and to prevent accidents to ele-
phants engaged in clearing logs at the
.bottom of the chute. From this point,
the Jogs are, re-loaded by derricks on to
timber-trucks on the second section of
tramway.-
(*q) The second section of tramway,
of the same type as the hill section, is
4.6 miles or 7.3 kilometres long, and
runs along flat ground by the side of a
creek, then up another hill 1;500 yards
long, with-gradients of 1 in 15 to 1 in 17,
vfclta dep6t whence the logs are carted
4.5 miles to another short chute, down
which they travel .into the flo’ating'creek.
111. In the Eastern Me Ysm forests
.the East Asiatic* Company Ltd.’ have
recently constructed a* tramway from
the Me Sai creek to the east bank of the
Me Yom. This tramway has been
constructed, because the local irrigation
works across the lower portions of the
creek impede the passage of logs by
•water to the river, and also because the
number of logs to be dealt with is too
large for carting with ordinary local
carts.
• i
< Tliis is a 30'- gauge line, 11 miles
or 17.8 kilometres long, with 18 lb.
rails and 4" x 6" x 50" sleepers. The
line ptoses through flat country with
the exception of one section, consisting
of 'low hills through which extensive
cuttings have been made up to 29' in
.depth. . ■
The loaded trucks are drawn by
elephants, and the annual \ delivery
amounts to 0,000 logs in a season con-
sisting of 7 to 8 months.
In addition to the above, it may be
noted that The Bombay Burmah Trading
Corporation Ltd. are constructing a
tramway in the Me Li Forests of the
I East Me Ping leased areas, and La Com-


pagnie Est-Asiatique have
recently (1926) laid down a Decauville
tramline in the Me Ing Forests.
Another form of overland transport
with caterpillar tractors has been tried a
good deal in several forest localities,
but, for various reasons, these have not
proved to be a success, and have now
been almost abandoned.


CHAPTER VI.
Conversion and Export of Siamese Teak.
(A) Preliminary.
After measurement and payment of
Government dues at Paknampo, the teak
logs in the rafts are examined chiefly
for size, and a considerable percentage
of undersized or otherwise unsuitable
logs are sold on the spot to local dealers.
These logs supply the demands of the
local and up-country markets.
Rafts which have come down the
Me Yom or Me Nan usually proceed
down river without further alterations,
whereas rafts which have travelled down
the Me Ping and Me Wang are often
broken up and re-made into smaller
rafts, first, on account of their large size,
and secondly, on account of the difficult
passage they have experienced coming
down.
From Paknampo southwards no
rafts may contain more than 200 logs,
and the usual number per raft is from
150 to 175. This rule has been brought
into force chiefly to prevent unnecessary
damage to the fishing nets, floating
houses, and heavy boat traffic on the
lower reaches of the river.
This rafting is usually possible
from June to January inclusive, the
most favourable condition of the river
being when it is about middle height,
with enough water to render stranding
unlikely, and has a current which, while
ensuring rapid progress, is not so strong
as to make steering difficult.
The rafts proceed to the storage
grounds, which are situated at various
points from 15 to 40 miles north of
Bangkok on both banks of the Menam
Chao Phya. On arrival the rafts are
moored to the banks or to stakes firmly
driven into the bed of the stream.
The chief points in the selection of
storage grounds are :
(a) Sufficient water, even when
the river is at its lowest, for the logs
to float at high tide almost any day of
the year, so that they can be towed off
as required.
(h) Immunity from timber thieves.
This is usually achieved by employ-
ing a local landowner as guardian of the
rafts.
(c) Immunity from water-pests, the
chief of which is the teredo or ship-
worm, a small mollusc which attacks
timber in water with great rapacity.
In the Menam Chao Phya three
common kinds are recognized ; of which
two thrive in brackish water, and one in
fresh water.
The teredo living in brackish water
occurs in the river as far as 40 miles
north of Bangkok.
The most common is a small pear-
shaped mollusc, less than half an inch
long. It bores holes in the timber at
right angles to the grain of the wood,
holes which may be only the size of a
pin’s head on the outside of the log, but
which gradually increase in breadth as
the mollusc penetrates into the interior
of the log. It has the peculiarity of
becoming really destructive only when
logs are kept in fast-running water.
The second and most destructive
species has a long, yellowish body, and
bores a winding hole into the timber in
any direction.


The third variety of teredo is the
fresh-water kind which is less common
and less destructive, because it only at-
tacks the outsides of logs as a rule. It
is distinguishable by the small white
shells which it leaves at the mouths of
the bore-holes..
Another class of water-pest is the
so-called “ may-fly,” a larva with p, yel-
lowish body and large head. Its depre-
dations are also not so serious, being
shallow holes confined to the exterior
of logs.
While lying at the storage grounds,
tli? rafts are carefully examined by
experienced men from the timber firms,
and logs are graded into three classes,
as follows:
(I) squaring logs, or logs likely to
yield squares or baulks of timber.
(II) planking logs, or logs likely to
yield planks.
These are generally large logs with
holes or other defects.
(III) Rejections, i.e. logs which will
yield neither squares nor boards, nor
planks. Such logs, together with any
other logs rejected at the saw-mill
itself, are sold locally in Bangkok.
Nowadays it is a remarkable fact
that a large percentage of the total
amount of teak brought down is sold
either at Pakna.npo or Bangkok. It has
been calculated that is sold in this
manner, and some authorities put the
figure as high as 40 />. In Bangkok itself
such timber is usually sold to members
of a well-known colony of Malays, who
live on the river-side north of the town.
These middlemen re-sell the timber to a
large number of small local saw-mills,
or saw-sheds operated by hand-sawing,
owned and worked chiefly by Chinese.
In these the timber is sawn up, and sold
for all kinds of local uses.
While grading the logs at the stor-
age grounds, in some cases it is the
practice to re-make the rafts into differ-
ent classes, and then to float the rafts
separately to the saw-mills in Bangkok.
In other cases the logs are simply marked
according to their class, and the rafts
brought doWn to the mills as they are,
without further changes.
(B) Milling.
On account of its irregular shape
and uneven quality, the milling of teak
proceeds on different lines from that of
trees of more regular growth. It is
more difficult to saw up rough teak logs
in the most economical manner, since
each log has to be carefully examined
and a decision taken on its individual
merits. This naturally demands skill
and experience. But, on the other babel,
as teak is used for many purposes, great
and small, from ship-building to joinery,
conversions of any length and size can
be utilized ; and this eliminates much of
the wastage which would otherwise
occur.
The chief object of the more im-
portant teak-millers in Bangkok, who
are shippers as well as millers, is to pro-
duce as many and as large squares as
possible from the logs, and it is for this
object that their mills are primarily de-
signed. The reason for this is that most
of the important purchasers of Siamese
teak, such as large ship-building and
railway companies, prefer to purchase
the teak in this form, having found from
experience that, in their own mills and
workshops, they can produce from
squares the various finished sizes requir-


Teak Raft on its way down to Bangkok.


ed with the maximum economy. It is
true that this system involves payment
of freight charges on a certain amount
of timber which will eventually be cut
to waste, but, on the other hand, damage
in transit is avoided which might be in-
curred by the shipment of finished sizes.
Next to squares, the principal mill-
ers aim at producing planks, boards,, and
scantlings as large and as long as possi-
ble. Planks are pieces not less than 6"
in width and 2J" in thickness. Boards
are pieces not less than 6" in width and
of any thickness up to 2"; while the term
“scantlings” covers other small sizes of
timber. These are all produced both
from the slabs which remain over, after
the squares have been sawn from the
squaring logs, and also from large defec-
tive logs which cannot produce squares.
Milling practice varies in different
mills. In some it is the custom to con-
vert the timber down to such small sizes
as roofing shingles and railway keys. In
other mills, after the timber has yielded
all that it can in the shape of squares,
planks, boards and scantlings, the resi-
due of the timber is sold on the spot to
Malay middlemen, or to Chinese and
other smaller local millers.
Whatever wood is unsuitable for
further sale, or for conversion as tim-
ber, is sawn into lengths, made up in-
to bundles, and sold as fuel. Sawdust
and shavings are gathered up and burnt
as fuel in the saw-mill furnaces.
From the above it will be under-
stood that, whereas the percentage of
timber obtained from the round log
varies considerably according to the
particular practice in the saw-mill, the
actual wastage is very small indeed,
since both the refuse timber and fuel find
a ready market in Bangkok, and even
tlie sawdust has it uses.
-
The following may be taken as a
very general account of the process of
converting teak in the Ban gkok saw-
mills. The log is poled from the log-pond
to the bottom of a sloping slip-way.
There it is usually lifted by a gantry-
crane out of the water on to the slipway.
It is then hauled up by means of an end-
less chain mechanism. On the slip-wav
the log is carefully examined and spray-
ed with a jet of water to assist in this
examination. If the log needs to be sawn
up into shorter lengths, it passes on to a
platform, where it is cross-cut into
lengths by a mechanical cross-butting
saw ; otherwise, it is hauled straight up
the slip-way into the saw-mill.
Three types of saw are used, cir-
cular saws, frame-saws with two parallel
vertical saws, and band-saws. These
latter are a more or less modern innova-
tion in Bangkok, taking the place of the
larger circular saws, and have not been
put into general use yet. The advantages
of band-saws are:
(a) their superior cutting-power.
(b) the reduction of wastage, Owing
to the narrower cut or kerf of the saw.
(c) their capacity to saw up timber
of practically any size.
The disadvantage of using band-saws
is that they are operated at high tension
and speed, and are much more likely
to get out of order, especially when saw-
ing a timber as hard as teak, which is
classed as a moderately hard timber.
The most common method of squaring a
log is to saw off the four sides (or
slabs) on a rack-bench travelling in con-
tact with a revolving circular saw.


Sometimes, after the first or second slab
has been removed, the remaining slabs
are sawn off on the frame-saw. In the
case of crooked or curved logs, the
squaring of the log is invariably com-
pleted on the frame-saw.
The resultant square is then remov-
ed by means of a travelling gantry
crane, and is examined, classified, mea-
sured, numbered and recorded. If the
ends are very defective, they may be
sawn off by means of a butting-saw on
the spot. The square is then piled ac-
cording to its grade by means of a gantry
crane, and passes into stock until such
time as it is required for shipment.
Finally, at the time of shipment,
the square is brought up by rollers to
the butting-saw, which trims off the
ends ; it is then hammered with identifi-
cation, shipping and grading marks, and
so proceeds to its ultimate destination.
Planking logs may be sawn up into
boards and planks either on the circular
saws or on the frame-saw, according to
convenience and expediency. Boards
and planks, when ready, are measured,
classified, recorded, and piled by hand,
awaiting shipment.
Band-saws, when used, take the
place of the larger circular saws or
“ breaking down saws,” as they are
sometimes called.
After the conversion of logs into
squares, boards, and planks, the slabs
are conveyed by hand or by trolley to
the scantling benches, where they are
examined and sawn to the greatest width
and thickness, according to their indi-
vidual merits, on small circular saw-
benches, the resultant scantlings being
finally butted into lengths on the slab-
buttin-g saw. They are then piled by
hand, according to their grade, and pass
into stock.
As already mentioned, beyond this
point, milling practice varies. In some
mills conversion continues, to produce
such small articles as roofing shingles
and railway keys ; in other mills all re-
maining timber is sold on the spot to
local buyers. Fuel and sawdust have
already been dealt with.
C. Defects of Siamese Teak.
Owing to its irregular habit of
growth, and to the many vicissitudes
through which the tree has to pass dur-
ing its long life in the forest, teak is
always subject to a number of defects.
In this connection it is noteworthy
that the teak tree in Northern Siam has
to endure, every year of its life, ex-
treme conditions of temperature, clim-
ate, and life generally.
For three months of the year the
climate is liable to be one of intense
heat and drought, and during this period
the whole of the teak forests, with the
exception of the moister evergreen por-
tions, are swept from end to end by
forest fires. During the succeeding six
months there are constant, if intermit-
tent, downpours of rain, while the re-
maining three months of the year are
comparatively cool and, on occasion,
even cold.
Furthermore, the teak tree must al-
ways be girdled and killed before it is
extracted; the minimum period allowed
for this operation is two years, but some-
times the tree may stand in a perfectly
dead and dry condition for qfiite a num-
ber of years before it is felled. For


this reason, it sometimes happens that
trees are cracked and damaged during
felling l .
O
The defects, to which Siamese teak
is subject, may be divided on broad lines
into three classes ; first, those due to de-
fective growth ; secondly, those due to
rot of various kinds ; and thirdly, those
due to insects and animals.
These three classes of defects are
’’often intimately linked up with one an-
other.
Defects of growth may again be
broadly sub-divided into crooked growth,
branchy growth, and twisted grain.
Crooked growth gives rise to crook-
ed or curved logs, generally known as
“ crooks. If such pieces are of suit-
able shape and size, they may some-
dimes have considerable value for
special objects, such as boat-, and ship-
building, but in the great majoritv of
cases they constitute serious defects
which necessitate the log being cross-
butted into shorter lengths before con-
version.
Branchy growth gives rise to knots
in the timber, and such knots often be-
come rotten and penetrate through the
bole into the heart of the tree.
Twisted grain sometimes occurs,
but cannot be considered as a prominent
and serious defect in Siamese teak.
Perhaps the most prominent fea-
ture, which catches the observer’s eye
in looking over a pile of round teak logs,
is the number of hollows and holes of
various shapes and sizes, which dis-
figure the surface of the logs.
Most of such holes and hollows are
due to rot set up by the action of vari-
ous fungi, but in many cases the injury
originates through a variety of different
agencies, such as climate, fire, insects
and animals, and it is only subsequently
that rot sets in. Such holes and hollows,
if deep, are carefully investigated with
lengths of wire or pieces of bamboo,
to ascertain their depth and direction,
before the log is converted at the saw-
bench.
The most universal and, at the same
time, the most serious defect of Siamese
teak is that known as “bee-holes,”
produced by a moth called Buo-
mitus ceramicus , whose identity was
first determined in 1905.
This pest is known to occur in teak-
bearing areas throughout Burma, where
it does very great damage to the teak,
and it also occurs in Java, though with
much less serious results, but it is com-
pletely absent throughout the peninsular
teak forests of India.
In Burma its occurrence has been
noted for many years, the first direct
reference being in 1841; but the practi-
cal and intensive study of the pest was
started about the beginning of the pre-
sent century. In Java also it been
considerably studied in recent years.
To give some idea of the magnitude
of the damage done by this moth, it has
been estimated by competent authorities
in Burma that the actual loss in cash
may amount annually to four million
rupees, and that the annual output of
teak from Burma is reduced from 10%
to 15% thereby. In Siam also there is
no doubt that a great amount of damage
is done by this pest.
The following is a very brief de-
scription of the life of the insect, and the


manner in which it commits its depre-
dations, taken from the publications on
tbe Bee-hole Borer of Teak, published
by tbe Government of India.
The moth, Duomitus ceramicus , the
caterpillar of which attacks living
teak trees of all sizes from small two
year old saplings up to the largest trees,
is of a pale grizzled-brown colour, and
from 2J to 3 inches long. As far as is
known, it lays its eggs on the bark of
the living tree. The eggs hatch out
and young larvae emerge. These young
larvae begin their life by boring into,
and eating, the bark and bast of the teak
tree.
In time the young larva grows in
size, becomes larger and stronger, and
eventually develops into a strong cater-
pillar from 21 to 3 inches long, with a
brown head, a striped, pink and white
body, and powerful black jaws. It then
proceeds to bore and excavate inwards
and upwards into the bole of tbe tree a
tunnel, generally from 9 to 13 inches
long and from 1 to 2 inches in diameter.
The upper end of the tunnel is made
slightly enlarged and forms the pupal
chamber. The caterpillar pupates in-
this chamber and thus becomes a pupa
or chrysalis. This pupa, when mature,
works its way down the tunnel until it
protrudes from the external opening, on
the outside of the tree trunkj in due-
course the moth emerges from the pupal-
case, walks up the trunk of the tree and
eventually flies off.
One of the most unpleasant features
of the damage done by this insect is
that, owing to its habit of attacking
green teak trees throughout their life, a
large proportion of the tunnels are situ-
ated in the interior of the logs, and,
being completely healed over by callus-
in the process of time, can only be dis-
covered at the time when the log is being
sawn up. s
It is well-known that the damage
done varies greatly in different localities,
but the reasons for this are as yet
uncertain. The actual damage done to
individual logs, of course, varies greatly,
some logs being completely free from
damage, others slightly damaged, and
Others again completely riddled and
sometimes more or less ruined thereby.
As yet, unfortunately, no actual
methods of controlling and guarding
against this pest have been discovered,
but careful experiments are being car-
ried out under the Government of
Burma towards this object.
The only well-known facts about
the bee-hole borer in the teak forests of
Siam are first, that its occurrence coin-
cides everywhere with the presence of
teak, and secondly, that its effects are
considerably worse in some localities
than in others ; which agrees with the
experience gained in Burma.
Recently, the following data re-
garding this pest have been collected in
Bangkok and are given herewith.
1) In the largest teak saw-mill in
Bangkok 96 squares were examined, as
they came out from the saw-benches and
were being classified before passing into
stock, and all obvious bee-holes on their
surfaces were counted. These squares
came from all over Northern Siam, with
the exception of the Western or Salween
areas. The following results were
noted :
There were 5.9 bee-holes on the
average, per square.


The greatest number of bee-holes
counted on the surface of any one square
was 70.
88% of the squares had bee-holes,
easily visible on their external surfaces.
12% of the squares had no bee-holes
visible.
2) Another saw-mill ha& kindly
supplied the following figures :
In four teak rafts, containing 611
logs in all, 16,124 bee-lioles were count-
ed on the exterior of the round logs,
thus giving an average of 26.39 bee-
holes per log. Of these logs, 88.17%
had bee-holes easily visible on their
outer surfaces, and 11.83% had no such
bee-holes. These figures are given as
approximate estimates, their exactness
not being guaranteed.
3) Another Bangkok saw-mill has
stated that, every year, about 6% of
the total number of logs coming to
the mill are totally rejected on account
of bee-holes, and disposed of locally.
Damage done to teak logs by birds,
chiefly wood-peckers, is closely associa-
ted with the damage done by the bee-
hole borer. These birds dig holes in the
timber, while searching for the cater-
pillars of the bee-hole borer and also
for larvae of other boring insects. Such
holes may often be seen on teak logs in
Bangkok, and they often become much
enlarged and extended by rot setting in.
It has not yet been definitely decided
whether the activities of these birds are
to be regarded, on the whole, as bene-
ficial or injurious.
The injuries inflicted on teak logs
by various kinds of Teredo, while float-
ing down the southernmost reaches of
the Menam Chao Phya to Bangkok,
have already been described and neec
not be referred to again.
(D) Grading of Siamese Teak.
In the teak trade of Siam there are
no fixed standards for the grading oi
the timber, either for round logs oi
for conversions. Each exporting firm
fixes its own standards of quality for the
various grades which it sells.
Speaking generally, as a rule, ex-
porters fix two grades or qualities for
Europe squares, and three qualities for
squares destined to be sold in the
Indian or other Eastern markets. Grades
are fixed in a more or less similar fashion
for planks, boards, and smaller sizes.
All teak conversions destined for
the markets of Europe require to be of
very high quality, free or practically
free from all serious faults and blemish-
es. Nowadays, only a small percen-
tage of Siamese teak finds its way to
Europe. Next to European demands, it
is probable that the Japanese market de-
mands the highest standard of quality.
(E) Distribution of Siamese Teak
in the Markets of the World.
On leaving the saw-mills, teak
squares are made up into rafts and tow-
ed to the ship which is to convey them
to their destination ; other classes of
conversions are conveyed to the ship in
boats.
Up to about 15 years ago it was no
uncommon thing for complete cargoes
of teak to be shipped from Bangkok,
either by steamer or sailing vessel, to
the various Eastern markets and even
to Europe, but of recent years paft car-
goes have been the almost invariable
rule. With the exception of shipments

Shipments to Europe are usually
against sales previously made by
agents there, who sometimes deal with
consumers direct, but more commonly
through brokers. Shipments on con-
signment are comparatively rare. To
India, shipments on consignment are
more common than shipment against

on consignment are not uncommon, but
most shipments of squares to those

The following table shows the
quantity in tons of 50 cubic feet of
Siamese teak exported from Bangkok
to the markets of the world during the
18 years from B. E. 2452 (1909-1910)
to B. E. 2469 (1926-27), together with
the average annual prices.
The total amounts exported from
Bangkok are estimated to represent
about 55% of the total annual teak
production of Siam.
Export of Teak.


This table clearly shows the re-
markable changes which have occurred
during recent years in the export and
distribution of Siamese teak from Bang-
kok throughout the world.
Whereas in B. E. 2452 (1909-10)
19.11% of the total teak exports went
from Bangkok to Europe, 62.36% to
India and Ceylon, and only 15.49% to
Far Eastern markets, for the three years,
B. E. 2466 (1923-24) to B. E. 2468
1925-26), the average annual figures
have been 12.11% to Europe, 22.12% to
India and Ceylon, and 53.67% to Far
Eastern markets.
This change must be chiefly ascrib-
ed to the import duty of 15% ad valorem
imposed on Siamese teak by the
Indian Government during recent
years, and also, to some extent, to in-
creased demands from the Far East.
The future of Siamese teak certain-
ly appears to lie mainly in the markets
of China and Japan; unfortunately, in
recent years, the demand from China
has fluctuated according to the political
situation and to the degree of security
and stability prevailing in various parts
of that great Empire.
F. Characteristics of Teak in General,
and Siamese Teak in Particular,
Teak may be described as being the
finest moderately hard wood in the
world. It derives its great reputation
from its striking combination of all the
good qualities that a timber should pos-
sess and none of the bad qualities. It
can be used for all kinds of purposes,
and it stands , out pre-eminently as the
finest ship-builiing timber in the wqrld.
It is equally famous for all kinds of
constructional work, and is specially
well-known as a timber for the construc-
tion of railway carriages. In addition
to its many utilitarian qualities, it also
possesses great natural beauty.
The following is a general descrip-
tion of the timber. The wood is mode-
rately hard, and moderately heavy. It
is strongly and characteristically scent-
ed. It contains an oil which is easily
perceptible to the touch, which possess-
es highly preservative qualities and thus
contributes largely to the great durabili-
ty of the wood. The sapwood is white
and small, while the heart-wood is large,
dark golden-yellow in colour, turning
brown, dark-brown and finally almost
black with age. The annual rings in the
wood are clearly marked by one or more
lines of regularly arranged pores; these
annual rings are true rings. The medul-
lary rays are moderately broad, giving a
conspicuously handsome silver grain.
The pith is large and of quadrangular
shape.
It is well-known that teak varies
a good deal in colour, hardness
and general qualities, not only between
the different regions of the earth in
which it grows, but also in different lo-
calities of the same region. 'This cer-
tainly holds good for Siam. In general,
Siamese teak resembles Burmese teak,
but it exhibits local variations, depend-
ing chiefly on soil, elevation and latitude.
There is a wide-spread belief in
Siam, based on practical experience,
that the slow-grown timber produced
on the stony foot-hills and on the rocky
lower slopes of the mountains is harder,
stronger, and more durable than the
faster-grown timber produced in the
low-lying basin deposits.
In some parts of the teak region of
Siam, the local people have worked out


their own classifications of various
varieties of timber, but these have
never been recognized either by scienti-
fic authorities or by the timber mer-
chants. An example of this may be
given in the Chiengrai district in North-
Eastern Siam, where the local experts
distinguish the following varieties:—
‘ Mai Sak Fai ’ —producing ordinary
timber.
‘ Mai Sak Hin ’ —slow-grown timber
produced on foot-hills. Hard and heavy.
‘Mai Sak Dam’—slow-grown timber
produced on rocky hills. ‘‘ Hard, heavy,
and dark-brown in colour.
v- * ‘ Mai Sak Yuak fast-grown
produced on low-lying lands. Pale in.
colour and brittle.-
> i
‘Mai Sak Khai’—a light “Wood,,
.tallow-coloured.
s *
Siamese teak * trees occasionally
produce burrs, which yield a highly-
prized wood with a “bird’s-eye grain”
pattern. Some tbak logs, when sawn up,,
are found to yield timber with a beauti- .
fully figured or mottled pattern; such
.timber is usually known as “flowered. 4
teak”, and commands high prices for
special purposes, such as furniture and
.cabinet making.
