PREFATORY NOTE.
These short essays are published with a view to placing in the
hands of teachers and pupils concise accounts of the various
historical topics prescribed for study in Grade VII. They should
prove especially helpful in those schools where the teacher of that
grade is required to teach other grades as well.
It is not intended that the oral treatment of history shall be
discontinued, nor is it suggested that the teacher shall limit
the lesson to the matter contained in the essays. At the end of
each section, references are made to certain standard text books
from which the information supplied in the essays may be
supplemented.
In order to stimulate interest in the subject, a number of novels
have been recommended as suitable for the school library, but
it is to be clearly understood that the historical facts must be
taken from standard text books, rather than from novels.
it is not expected that children will commit to memory the
lists of rulers, important events and dates in Section XVI.
They are placed in convenient form for ready reference.
The author is indebted to Mr. J. H. Williams, 8.A., of the
Teachers’ College, for general assistance and for the lists of novels
suitable for the school library, and to Mr. J. A. Tillett, of the
Education Department, for a series of maps which should form
excellent adjuncts to the study of the various topics.

I.—THE ROMANS IN BRITAIN.
Two thousand years ago there lived in Britain, the land now
called England, a Celtic people known as the Britons. They
were not united as are the inhabitants of England to-day, but
were divided into tribes, over each of which ruled a chieftain.
They fought among themselves, and by their constant fighting
made it easier for their enemies to overcome them. These
enemies were not far distant, for across the narrow strip of water,
now called the English Channel, lay the country of the Gauls.
These had been conquered by the Romans, who were at that time
the most powerful people in Europe. The Romans took their name
from Rome, which was the chief city in all their great emnire.
Believing that the Gauls had been aided by the Britons they
now determined to punish them for the part that they had taken.
In the year 55 b.c., Julius Caesar, the greatest of the Roman
generals, landed with an army on the southern shore of Britain.
He soon found that his force was too small to conquer the country.
He returned to Gaul, but in the following year again attacked
Britain—this time with a larger army. On this occasion he
conquered the chiefs of the south, but his success was due partly
to the assistance which some of the Britons themselves had
given him. He commanded the people to pay a yearly tribute
to Rome and then recrossed the channel. For nearly a hundred
years the Britons were left to themselves. The tribute was
not paid, but they had been taught to fear the power of the
Roman armies, a lesson which they remembered for a long time.
In 43 a.d., the Romans again invaded the land. They did so
because some of the British chiefs had made attacks upon the
coast of Gaul. Now they came, not to demand tribute only, but
to turn the country into a Roman province. The southern part
of the island was conquered within the space of a few years,
but only as the result of hard fighting. On one occasion Boadicea,
who formerly had been a British queen, raised so great a re-
bellion that thousands of the Romans were slain before peace was
restored. With the Highlanders of the north, however, the Romans
continued the struggle without success. Then, to protect them-
selves from these wild people, who were called Caledonians, the
Romans built two great walls across the island, one of earth
between the Firths of Forth and Clyde, the other of stone
stretching from the Solway to the mouth of the River Tyne.


For more than three hundred and fifty years the Romans ruled
the country. They themselves were a much more highly civilized
people than were the Britons, who, therefore, learned much of
which they had been ignorant before. They saw great roads
built, along which the soldiers could march rapidly in time of
rebellion. Thus the old fighting days were forgotten and peace
remained in their place. Then came the traders and the mer-
chants to buy and sell the goods which the people produced.
Forests were cleared, swamps drained, and corn was planted.
So much was grown that hundreds of ships were required each
year to carry the produce away. Soon Britain was known as
the Granary of the North. Mines were worked and orchards
planted. Cities sprang up, within which were built temples,
baths, courthouses, and beautiful dwellings of stone, such as were
to be found in cities on the Continent of Europe. Within their
walls the Britons often imitated the polished ways of the Romans,
dressing as they dressed, learning the Latin tongue and accepting
their religion. In this way they learned for the first time of the
teachings of Christ, for many of the Romans themselves had been
converted to the Christian religion while yet they remained in
Britain. But the Romans never expected the Britons to pro-
tect themselves against their enemies. That was the work of
the Roman army in Britain, and within its ranks but few Britons
were included. Do not think, however, that they were freed
from military service, for British troops were used by their rulers
to maintain peace in other parts of the Empire. Many of the
soldiers who watched over Britain were not Romans. Within
that army were to be found men from Africa, Spain, Gaul, and
from other countries over which the Emperor ruled. Thus
the Britons learned to rely wholly on their conquerors for guidance
and protection. This was unfortunate, for in the absence of
the Romans they became a weak people. This they learned to
their cost in the year 410, when all the Roman soldiers were
recalled to protect their own great city against the attacks of
numerous powerful enemies.

II. —THE COMING OF THE ENGLISH.
The closing years of the Roman rule in Britain had been dis-
turbed by attacks made upon it by new enemies. From the north
came the Piets, who formerly had been called the Caledonians.
The Scots,* dwelling in the north of Ireland, crossed the sea and
plundered the western coast. From the east came swarms of
pirates who spread terror among those who dwelt along the
shores of the North Sea and the English Channel. The depar-
ture of the Romans only increased the danger, as now the Britons
had to protect themselves. Alone they were no match for their
enemies. No longer could the Roman walls keep out the northern
invaders. In despair they called upon some of the sea rovers
from the east to assist them.
These men were Jutes who had come from f Jutland, the north
of Denmark; According to fable, their leaders were Hengist
and Horsa, who arrived in the year 449. With their aid the
Britons were able to overcome the attacks of the Piets and Scots.
Then the Jutes, finding that the land was a good one, determined
to remain. Gradually they took possession of Kent and the Isle
of Wight, driving the Britons out before them. Then other
enemies arrived who were even more powerful than were the
Jutes. The Angles, who came from southern Denmark, attacked
nearly the whole of the eastern coast of Britain and slowly pushed
their way towards the west. Three great kingdoms they set
up, namely, Northumbria, Mercia, and East Anglia. South of
these lay the lands conquered by the Saxons who had come from
the north of Germany. Chief among these were the West Saxons,
who lived in Wessex. The other Saxon kingdoms were those of
Essex, Sussex, and Middlesex. Soon the conquerors ceased to
be known as Angles, Saxons, and Jutes; the common name of
“ English ” was given to them all. This is only another form of
the word Angle, the name of the tribe which had conquered the
greatest part of the land which now began to be called England
We must not think that the Britons had idly allowed their
lands to be taken from them. One hundred and fifty years after
the arrival of the Jutes the Britons still owned nearly all the

in North Germany.


western portion of England. In fact, the Welsh, as the Britons
were called by their enemies, were not really overcome until
centuries had passed. But those parts of the island that were
conquered were conquered thoroughly. For the English came,
not as did the Romans, to add fresh lands to an Empire ; they
came to conquer and to settle. The Romans allowed the Britons
to remain, because it was from them that money could be obtained
to support the arms of Rome and keep the country at peace.
Map, showing the original homes of the English,
The English, accustomed to war and plunder, took what they
could and slew or enslaved those who opposed them. The Welsh,
who had lived for so long a time under Roman rule, looked upon
them as savages, for they were heathens who worshipped gods
of war and thunder. Heaven to them was a place where people
enjoyed themselves by lighting constantly. They despised the
Christian religion, which the Welsh had accepted, and did their
best to stamp it out. In their homes beyond the sea they had
lived in the open country, farming their land and watching their

flocks. The cities of England did not please them ; they were
either destroyed or allowed to fall into rains. In this way perished
many of the great works which the Romans had introduced.
The roads decayed, the Latin language passed away, and England,
instead of being one country, ruled by one people, became divided
into many little kingdoms each with its own ruler. No longer
was the country at peace ; king fought with king for the mastery
of England. First, the Northumbrians proved themselves to be
the most powerful. Later, the Mercian rulers proclaimed them-
selves the overlords of England. Then, in the ninth century, the
West Saxon kings compelled all the others to look upon them
as their superiors. But the country was not united, for although
the King of Wessex might be the overlord of England, he ruled
over his own kingdom only. Not until the eleventh century
did England really become one country; then the work was
performed by a Norman and not by an Englishman.

III.—ALFRED AND THE SAXON KINGDOM.
While the West Saxons were still fighting to prove themselves
to be the strongest people in England a new peril threatened
the whole country. The English in their turn were now attacked
by sea rovers, who came from Norway and the north of Denmark.
These were the Danes. In many ways they resembled the
Angles, Saxons, and Jutes at the time of their landing in Britain.
They were fearless sailors and mighty warriors. In their little
ships they reached even the distant shores of Iceland and of
Greenland. But they were also very cruel, and, being heathens,
delighted in plundering the Christian monasteries and churches
which had been built in England. For a great change had come
over the English. No longer did they worship gods of war and
thunder. In the year 597 a Roman missionary named Augustine
had landed on the shores of Kent and had commenced the work
of converting the people. Thus, on their arrival, the Danes found
that the English were Christians. Soon they decided to settle in this
new country, which was so much more pleasant than was the cold
land they had left. The English of the north and east were quite
unable to check their advance. Soon the West Saxons alone
remained unconquered. If they fell, the Danes would be the
masters of the whole of England.
The kings of Wessex proved themselves to be much stronger
than had the lesser English rulers. Chief among these was Alfred;
who reigned from the year 871 to 901. In spite of all his efforts,
he was for a time compelled to take refuge in the marshes of
Athelney. Two interesting stories have been told about him
during this time of hiding. It is said that, while in disguise, he
was asked one day to mind some cakes that were cooking on
the hearth of the cow-herd’s little dwelling, in which he wag
hiding ; but his mind being filled with the thoughts of his king l
dom, he forgot the cakes, which were burned. So angry was the
cow-herd’s wife that she scolded him severely, little thinking
that he was the King of Wessex. The other story tells us that
Alfred one day came out from his hiding place and entered the
Danish camp, carrying with him his harp. There he delighted
the Danes with his sweet music, but at the same time learned
many things about the Danish army. These may be only fables,
but we know that in the year 878 he collected his forces again

and defeated his enemies. After the battle, the Danes, by the
treaty of Chippenham, agreed to live north bLn, line drawn from
London to Chester, to look upon Alfred as their overlord and to
accept the teachings of Christ. Later in his reign, when fresh
fighting occurred, the West Saxons were again victorious. Thus
before his death Alfred had established his overlordship over
England just as firmly as had the kings before him.
But Alfred was more than a warrior. We are told that in his
boyhood his mother presented'him with a beautiful book because
he studied so much more diligently than did his brothers. When
he became a man he wrote books for his people and encouraged
others to do the same. The “ Anglo-Saxon Chronicle” was begun
in his day, and from it we learn the history of the time. He
set up schools, and rebuilt the churches and monasteries which
the Danes had destroyed. So ignorant were many of the priests
that he looked for others who, by their better education, were
more fitted to take their places. 1 He collected the laws of his
land and set them in order so that they might be understood.
He then saw that they were carried out. By this means justice
could be had by everybody. He set on foot a new .army which
was much stronger than the old one. What is more important
he built a navy which defeated the Danes on the sea, and thus
saved England from much misery. Not only Was. the work
which he did great, but he himself was great. One writer has
said of him : “ His character is among the noblest and purest
in all history.” It is no wonder then that he has been known
since as Alfred the Great.
The greatness of his reign contrasts strangely with the weak-
ness of that of Ethelred the Unready, who lived one hundred
years later. His weak rule attracted fresh bands of Danes to
the country. Ethelred attempted to keep them off by giving them
money which his subjects were compelled to pay. This money
was called Danegeld. This and all his other methods failed.
The Danes pressed on, and after his death England came under
the rule of Danish kings for a period of twenty-six years.

IV. — THE NORMAN CONQUEST.
After the death of the last of the Danish kings who ruled in
England, the throne passed to Edward the Confessor. Although
King of the English he despised, rather than loved, his subjects.
From his early childhood he had lived in Normandy, which lay
on the other side of the English channel. The pirates from the
north had attacked other lands besides England in King Alfred’s
day. Some of them, sailing farther to the south, had conquered
the northern part of France. Here they were called Northmen or
Normans. Although barbarians at the time of their arrival,
they soon adopted the language, religion, and customs of the
French. This, blended with their native hardiness, placed them
foremost among the races of Europe. Civilization had not
advanced rapidly among the English, so it is not surprising that
Edward was displeased with what seemed to him to be their
rough ways. He invited his Norman friends to England, gave
them high positions, and even promised that his throne should
pass to their ruler, William, Duke of Normandy. He had no
authority to make this promise, for only the Witan, the group of
wi«e men who helped the King to govern, had the right to choose
his successor. William, however, maintained later on that this
promise gave him authority to claim the English throne.
On Edward’s death, in the year 1066, the Witan declared
Harold, the Earl of Wessex, to be the King of England. Un-
fortunately for Harold he had already taken an oath declaring
that he would support William’s claim to the throne. For
shortly before this time a ship in which he was sailing had been
wrecked on the coast of Normandy, and the Duke, holding him
as a prisoner, had allowed him to return only after he had made
this solemn promise. After hearing that Harold had accepted
the throne, William at once hastened his preparations for an
invasion of England.
Various causes now combined to weaken the English. The
great earls were jealous of their new king. They resented the
authority of one who had himself been but an earl. The English
fleet, tired of watching, was disbanded. Harold’s brother,
Tostig, who had been driven from the land because of his evil
deeds, now returned in company with the King of Norway and


a fleet of more than three hundred ships. Harold met his enemies
at Stamford Bridge. Both the leaders of the invading host
were slain and their army was crushed. Twenty-four ships
were sufficient to carry the remnant back to Norway, but the loss
on the side of the English had been great also. Three days later
William of Normandy landed in the south. With him came a
fleet of nearly* seven hundred ships. Harold hastened south-
wards, collected what troops he could, and drew up his army
on Senlac Hill, protecting his men by a deep trench and a line of
stakes driven firmly into the ground.
About nine in the morning the battle commenced. Again and
again the mail-clad knights of Normandy hurled themselves
against that row of stakes and the solid line of shields that stood
behind it. Again and again the crushing blows of the English
axes, wielded by powerful arms, drove them back in confusion.
For six hours the result was in doubt. Suddenly the Normans
received the order to retreat. The hastily collected troops of
the English, who formed the wings of Harold’s army, believing
victory to be nigh, dashed down the hill in pursuit, but the Nor-
mans soon turned, and having them now in the open, easily
overcame them. The ranks of the English were thinned. What
was worse, an arrow fired high into the air, so as to miss the wall
of shields, now pierced the eye of the English king. Still the
battle continued, but victory had passed to the Normans. In
the gathering darkness, the invader’s standard stood on the brow
of the hill where in the morning had floated the banner of Harold.
The battle had been decisive, and on Christmas Day, in the year
1066, William was crowned King of England in the famous
Abbey of Westminster. Revolts which broke out shortly after-
wards he put down with fire and sword. A new title was then
added to his name. After this he was known as “ William the
Conqueror.”
His next task was to govern the country. To keep the English
in subjection he confiscated their lands. Some he afterwards
returned, but much was given to his Norman followers. Great
castles were built all over the country. Within these strongholds
the Normans remained secure. But more important was the
manner in which William organized his army in accordance with
the Feudal system.- The king, as the owner of all the land of
England, gave certain areas to his greater nobles on condition
that in time of danger each of them should provide him with a
band of armed knights. To do this, these greater nobles gave
* Some early writers, give much greater numbers.


out portions of their land to lesser nobles, who then took oaths
to bring a required number of fighting men when called upon to
do so. Thus, in the time of revolt, the king could always call upon
an army to defend his cause. This system was common throughout
Europe, but William saw that it contained a weakness. For
the greater nobles might break their word and still call upon the
lesser nobles to bring their forces to fight against the king instead
of for him. To prevent this he compelled all the lesser nobles
also to take an oath by which they promised always to serve the
king first.
This system checked not only the English, but the Mermans
as well. Two other means he adopted to control the power of
his nobles. By giving to each of his followers a scattered estate,
he made it difficult for any one of them to collect his forces
secretly. In time of trouble also he called upon the English to
assist him. For the English soon learned that the oppression of
the king was light when compared with that of an uncontrolled
nobility. Thus they responded to his call, knowing that their
own safety depended largely upon the safety of the king.
To govern the country the king required money. This he
obtained by taxing his people. To prevent injustice, he ordered
his officers to enter in a great book the names of all the taxpayers
of England and the property that each possessed. The English,
who now realised that they were doomed to pay taxes, called it
the “ Domesday Book,” but we of a later period have good cause
to thank the king for leaving us so valuable a record of the people
of his day.
William the Conqueror was the greatest of the Norman Kings
who ruled over England. His son William, known as the Red
King, on account of his red hair, was one of the most brutal
sovereigns that England has had. With the aid of mercenary
troops he overcame all opposition. Men hid themselves in the
woods at his approach. He robbed the church of its revenues,
and when Anselm, the Archbishop of Canterbury, protested
against all the injustice that was being done, he was compelled
to leave the country. Few lamented when it was announced
that the king’s body had been found in the New Forest pierced
by an arrow. He was buried without funeral rites, and when
some years later the roof which covered his tomb fell in, few
wondered, when they recalled the evil deeds of his lifetime.
His brother, Henry 1., who succeeded him, was harsh to all
who opposed him. When his eldest brother, Robert, who had been
Duke of Normandy since the Conqueror’s death, attempted to


seize the throne of England, he was captured and kept a close
prisoner until his death. But while Henry was harsh he was also
just. Because of this he was called the Lion of Justice. He
pleased the English by marrying Matilda, a Scottish princess,
who was a descendant of Alfred the Great. Men had cause to
remember his firm rule in the days of his successor. He left no
male heir, for his only son had been drowned in the wreck of the
White Ship when attempting to cross from Normandy to England.
But before his death he gained from his nobles a promise that they
would accept his daughter Matilda as their queen. Only some
of them kept their word ; others supported the cause of Stephen,
who now became king.
A terrible civil war followed. The nobles built more castles,
within which they defied the king. Then they plundered and
robbed as they pleased. The English, no longer protected by a
strong ruler, about whom they could rally, suffered every form of
cruelty and injustice. Thus the rule of the last of the Normans
resulted in anarchy. Only when power had passed to Matilda’s
son, Henry 11., who was the first of the Angevin or Plantagenet
kings, was order restored.
A great change came into the lives of Englishmen as a result
of the Conquest. For many years they were held in contempt
by their conquerors. English ceased to be spoken by the upper
classes ; the French language took its place. The Norman castles
and churches brought before the English new forms of architecture.
But what is more important they saw the kingdom under the
sway of one ruler ; at last the idea of a united England impressed
itself upon their minds.

V. — THE CRUSADES.
While the Red King, William 11., was still ruling in England
the thoughts of all the Christians of Europe were suddenly directed
towards the Holy Land. Eleven hundred years before this
period Palestine, or the Holy Land as it was afterwards called,
formed a part of the Roman Empire. It was during the time
that the Romans ruled over the land that Christ was born in
Bethlehem and crucified in Jerusalem. The spread of Christianity
carried the names of these two places into distant lands. Soon
they were looked upon as being particularly sacred. Then
devout Christians began the practice of visiting those scenes
among which Christ had taught and suffered. These visits were
known as pilgrimages, and the persons who undertook them
were called pilgrims. There is no evidence to tell us exactly
when this custom commenced, but it was quite common before
the time of the departure of the Romans from Britain. Then,
in the seventh century, the Romans were driven from Palestine
by a people called the Arabs, who believed, not in the teachings
of Christ, but in those of Mohammed. Pilgrims, however, con-
tinued to pass to and from the Holy Land, for the new rulers
made no attempt to exclude them. But, in the eleventh century,
the Arabs were overcome by the Turks, who also were Moham-
medans. Then evil times fell upon those who sought to visit
those sacred shrines. They were robbed and murdered ; now
they went at the risk of their lives.
All Christendom listened with horror to the tales of Turkish
cruelties. Thus, when the Pope called upon all Christians to
arm in defence of the cause of their Lord, his words met with a
ready response. In their enthusiasm men forgot to reason.
Many, selling or giving away all that they had, set out for the
East, often without the necessary food or money, only to perish
by the way. Not only were adults aroused, but thousands of
French children followed a shepherd boy who promised to lead
them over the sea on foot. They fell into the hands of slave
dealers who sold them into Egypt. In Germany, a boy of the
city of Cologne gathered around him some twenty thousand other
children to go on a pilgrimage, but they never reached Palestine.
Many persons went because they were fond of adventure. For


more than two centuries these Crusaders, or followers of the
Cross, upon whose garments and armour was worked the sign of
the cross, continued to struggle against the Turks.
The Scene of the Crusades.
Some of the armies which set out were more carefully organized
and better equipped than others. These expeditions have since
been distinguished by numbers. Thus, what is known as the First
Crusade left Europe while the Red King was ruling in England.
This captured Jerusalem and established a Christian kingdom
in the Holy Land. But many crusaders had set out before this
time. A few years later the Second Crusade set forth to assist
the Christian warriors, who were being hard pressed by the Turks.
It was of no avail, for Saladin, the new leader of the Turks,
recaptured nearly all that the Crusaders had won.


In the Third Crusade our own king, Richard 1., played the most
important part. Unfortunately, with all his bravery, which
has given him the name of “ the Lionhearted,” he could not
refrain from quarrelling with the other rulers who shared the
task with him. On his arrival he found the Crusaders besieging
Acre. With his assistance the city soon fell. Then, noticing
that the Duke of Austria had planted his standard on the walls,
he ordered it to be thrown down and his own to be put in its
place. The enraged Austrian soon returned to his own dominions.
Soon after him went the King of France, with whom Richard
had been disputing almost from the day of their setting out.
The followers of these departed leaders, many of whom chose to
remain, naturally quarrelled with the English. Nevertheless, they
all recognised Richard as the greatest leader. In two severe battles
he defeated the Turks. Twice he came within twelve miles of
the walls of Jerusalem, only to find his force too weak to besiege
it. On the latter occasion his followers invited him to ascend
a hill from which he might at least see the city. Richard refused,
saying that if he could not conquer it he was not worthy to look
upon it. Shortly afterwards he made a treaty with Saladin,
by which pilgrims were allowed to visit the holy places. Then
he set sail for England. His ship was wrecked in the Adriatic,
and while attempting to cross Austria, in disguise, he was seized
by his old enemy the Duke of Austria and sold to the Emperor,
who kept him as a prisoner. It is said that he was discovered by a
minstrel, who, playing one day outside his prison walls, heard
the king singing the same tune. Only after the English had
paid the enormous sum of £lOO,OOO was the king released and
allowed to return.
Richard was not the only ruler of England who visited the Holy
Land. Edward 1., known as the greatest of the Plantagenets,
was engaged in the eighth or the last of the great Crusades at the
time of his accession to the throne. But all the efforts of the
Crusaders were in vain. The religious zeal which had been so
evident in the earlier enterprises against the enemy of the cross
was missing. The leaders thought more of the worldly profit
that they might gain. The great sea powers of Venice and
Genoa looked upon each Crusade as an opportunity to increase
their trade advantages. They demanded huge sums of money
for conveying the soldiers as well as a share of the lands that were
captured. The Christians, while in the Holy Land, quarrelled
among themselves, thinking more of their own gains than of the
cross.


The Turks pressed on, and in the year 1453 took the great
city of Constantinople itself. Only in the Great War of 1914-19
was the Holy Land reconquered, and then the success was due
partly to the efforts of our own Australian soldiers.

VI.—MAGNA CARTA.
On the death of Richard the Lionhearted, his brother John came
to the throne. Like the earlier Angevin kings, he ruled over
the western half of France as well as England. It was in these
continental dominions that Richard had spent the greater part
of his reign of ten years. For only seven months did he live in
England. John, although crowned king, found that many of
his nobles across the Channel preferred to have his nephew
Arthur, a boy of fifteen, as their king. Arthur was captured
and cruelly murdered. Many believe that John himself com-
mitted this terrible deed. Then the King of France gave his-
assistance to the discontented nobles. Soon, only the south-
western portion of France, named Gascony, remained to the-
English. Among the lands taken by France was Normandy.
The loss of so much territory naturally made John unpopular,,
but there were other reasons which soon caused his English
subjects to hate him. Only a year later he entered upon a.
quarrel with the Pope, who had appointed Stephen Langton to
be the Archbishop of Canterbury. John, who desired this office
for one of his favorites, refused to allow him to set foot in England.
The Pope then placed England under an interdict. By this all
public worship was forbidden ; the churches were closed and
the dead were buried without the customary prayers, To the
people of the time it seemed that the gate of heaven had been
closed against them. But John cared nothing about the souls
of his people ; he continued to defy the Pope, who, therefore,
excommunicated the king himself. By this punishment all
Christians were forbidden to have any communication with him.
But as John’s closest friends cared little for the teachings of
Christ, and as he was strong enough to compel his subjects to
pay him huge sums of money, he still persisted in his defiance.
Then the Pope called upon the King of France to invade the
country and take the crown. John saw clearly that his own
subjects, tired of his misrule, would give him little assistance
against so powerful an enemy. He gave way and swore to
admit Stephen Langton as the Archbishop of Canterbury.
Further, he declared himself to be the Pope’s vassal, and promised
to pay to the Roman See one thousand marks a year. In the
eyes of the world, England became a Papal State ; no longer
was it an independent kingdom.

Englishmen were disgusted. For years all classes of people
had suffered. From the church, the nobles and the common
people, huge sums of money had been extorted. Those who
refused to pay were imprisoned and even tortured. Those who
rebelled were driven from the country; their goods were taken,
and in some cases their families were allowed to starve. No
one was safe. Gradually, by the efforts of Stephen Langton,
all classes were united against the king. Then John was unable
to resist them. At Runnymede, in the year 1215, he placed his
seal to the Great Charter which the Barons presented to him.
This Charter, or as it is called in the Latin tongue, Magna
Carta, is one of the important documents upon which rest our
present liberties. There had been charters before this time,
but this one was of greater importance. No longer were kings
to exercise despotic rule over their subjects without an appeal
being made to this charter of liberties. Only by the law of the
land was a free man to be imprisoned or deprived of his goods.
From no one was justice to be withheld. Fresh taxes were to be
imposed only by the consent of the great council of barons.
The church was to be free and to exercise all its rights without
restraint. Towns were to enjoy freedom of trade.
Within a year John was dead, but the Charter continues to
this day. Just a word of warning is necessary. The barons
who wrung these liberties from the king were acting in their own
interests rather than in those of all the people of England. A
large proportion of the Englishmen of the time were really serfs
and not free. Their interests were not considered seriously by
the nobility, but as the years passed by the serfs gradually acquired
their freedom, and the gap which separated the nobles from the
common people gradually closed. Then all alike as freemen
could look to that Charter and claim the privileges which it set
forth as the rights of Englishmen.

VII.—THE GROWTH OF PARLIAMENT.
One of the most important clauses set forth in the Great
Charter was that which stated that no fresh taxes were to
be raised without the consent of the Great Council. A little
more than four hundred years later another important charter
of liberties, called the Petition of Right, was signed by King
Charles I. By this, taxes were to be imposed only with the
consent of Parliament, and this is the system which prevails
to-day. Why then was not the consent of Parliament required
in the reign of King John ? The answer is easily given—Parlia-
ment, as we know it, did not exist. The English of those days
were not governed as we are to-day.
Before the time of the Norman Conquest, the kings of England
ruled with the aid of the Witan, or the Assembly of the Wise.
In this were to be found bishops, great nobles, and the officers
of the king. Many of them were not learned in the sense that
an educated person is to-day. Some of them could neither read
nor write, but, because they gave the king advice, they were
called the Wise Men of the Kingdom. With their consent, new
laws were made, and it was they who elected the new king.
But if the king were a strong ruler he often paid no attention to
their advice, and then the wishes of his subjects were not con-
sidered at all.
After the Norman Conquest, the Great Council took the place
of the Witan. Magna Carta tells us that this consisted of arch-
bishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and the greater barons. It was
their duty to attend, and it was their advice which counted
with the king. Thus the common people played no part in the
government of the whole country. This could not continue for
ever ; the great change was brought about mainly by the poverty
of our kings.
From very early times, the king had been expected to live and
to govern chiefly by means of the money which he collected from
his own estates, which were scattered all over the country. Of
course, there were other sources of revenue, but this one was the
most important. Now, as king after king rewarded his followers
with gifts of land, these royal estates became smaller and smaller.
The cost of governing did not decrease and, therefore, as time
went by, kings found themselves short of money.
John had compelled his subjects to pay more by threat
and torture, but he also tried a more lawful method of raising


"money. Two years before signing Magna Carta, when in sore
straits, he called four knights from each shire to discuss matters
with him at Oxford. Unfortunately, we do not know whether
the assembly ever met. His son, Henry 111., after many years
of bad government, was put off the throne by a party of the
barons under the leadership of Simon de Montfort. Simon
then governed the country, but only a portion of it favoured his
cause. Thus he saw the need of calling upon all his followers
to support him. He recognised also that much of the wealth of
the country now lay with the dwellers in the cities of England.
To his Parliament, during the year 1265, therefore, were sum-
moned not only the great nobles, but also two knights from each
shire and two citizens from each city which supported his cause.
Within a year Simon was slain by his enemies and his system pi
government was neglected, for it is well to recall that he was
regarded by the king’s friends as an enemy to his country.
Thirty years later a still more famous Parliament met. The
king, Edward 1., was beset by many troubles. Scotland had
rebelled against him; the French were attacking his southern
coast; and a recent revolt in Wales had called for heavy expendi-
ture. Money was needed and in large quantities. To obtain it
Edward summoned the Parliament of the year 1295. This was
attended by the bishops, abbots, earls, and barons, together
with two knights from each shire, and two citizens from each
city. All who had to pay were either present or represented in
the gathering. This model was followed in later Parliaments,
and thus it has been called the “ Model Parliament.” It was
more important than Simon’s Parliament firstly, because
its members came from all parts of England ; and, secondly,
because it was the work of the king, who was the constitutional
ruler. Later on, the members divided into groups. The
great churchmen and the nobles separated themselves from
the knights and the citizens. From this division we can trace
the beginnings of the present House of Lords and House of
Commons.

VIII.—THE HUNDRED YEARS’ WAR.
One hundred and twenty years after the death of King John,
Englishmen still remembered that their kings had once ruled
over the western half of France. The possession of Gascony
recalled to them the greater empire of which their own land had
been but a part. Men dreamed of the restoration of that which
had been lost. The King of France, however, regarded Gascony
in quite a different light. While England retained this southern
portion of France he deemed his own domain was not complete.
He, therefore, longed for the day when the English would be
expelled from France for ever. Other causes now added to the
enmity which existed between the two countries. The French had
given assistance to the Scots who, under Eobert Bruce, had been
at war with England during the reign of Edward 11. The English,
also, by giving aid to the people of Flanders, had enabled them to
expel their count, who was a vassal of the King of France. In
doing this the English had considered their own trade interests,
for it was to Flanders that most of their wool went. Thus they
did not want to see the land of their best customer fall into the
hands of their greatest enemy. In the Channel also the sailors
of England and France were constantly fighting. Just at this
time the French king died, leaving no heir to succeed him. Then
our own sovereign, Edward 111., whose mother had been a sister
of the late French king, claimed the throne of France.
The ensuing struggle has been named the Hundred Years*
War, although, in reality, it lasted for a little longer (1338-
1453). The fighting throughout this long period was not con-
tinuous, but a state of war existed between the two enemies for
nearly the whole of the time.
In the year 1340, England secured her first great victory in a
sea fight off the Flemish Port of Sluys. The French fleet of
about 200 ships was destroyed and the control of the Channel
passed to England. The next twenty years was a period of
English successes. At Crecy, in the year 1346, their army of
20,000 engaged a French force of 70,000. Mounted knights still
formed the main part of the army of France as they had when
William the Conqueror landed in England. The English force
consisted of archers, supported by men-at-arms and armed knights,


who now generally fought on foot. The battle commenced
with the advance of a body of Italian crossbow-men, who were
included within the French force, but their crossbows were no
match for the long bows of England. Moreover, their weapons

were practically useless, for a shower had wet their bow strings.
Thus they were soon thrown into confusion. Then the French
knights charged upon the English lines, trampling under foot
the unfortunate Italians who lay in their way. The cloud of
arrows which met them caused them to stop. Fifteen times
they tried to penetrate the English ranks, but always without
success, for horse and rider alike went down before the well-
directed cloth-yard shafts. The victory for the English was
complete. Edward 111., who commanded the reserve, took
no active part in the battle for the victory had been secured
without the aid of the reserve. His son, the Black Prince, fought
in the thick of the fight. Once when he was hard pressed a
messenger implored the king to send him aid. Edward refused,
saying : “ Let the boy win his spurs.”
Ten years later, the Black Prince won a victory against greater
odds at Poitiers. While retreating with his little army of 7,000
men he was cut off by a French host of 40,000. Again it was a
victory for the English archers. The rapidity of their shooting
and the force of their arrows which pierced everything but
the best armour threw the enemy into confusion. The French
were utterly defeated and their king was taken prisoner.
In the year 1360, peace was proclaimed by the Treaty of
Bretigny. England received all the lands which lay south of the
River Loire, but Edward renounced his claim to the French
throne.
The peace was of short duration. The next fifty years were
marked by failures on the part of the English. Before Edward
111. died France had regained more than she had lost. All that
was left to the English was a few coastal towns. The Black
Prince had died before his father. During the reigns of the two
succeeding kings—Richard 11. and Henry IV. —the French
attacked the coasts of England, plundering the towns and
threatening invasion. Then the tide turned. The nobles of
France began to quarrel among themselves. The new English
king, Henry V., proved to be a great warrior. At Agincourt, in
the year 1415, with an army of 6,000 he gained a famous victory
over the French force of 30,000. The battle was fought on
ploughed land, soaked by recent rains. The heavily-armed
knights of France had the greatest difficulty in even moving.
Many of them stuck fast in the mud. Upon them the arrows
descended. Then, seeing their plight, the archers and the men-
at-arms dashed forward. No armour could withstand the blows of
the mallets and axes which the English wielded. The slaughter
c


among the French was terrible. A little later, the powerful Duke
of Burgundy rebelled against the French king and allied himself
with Henry, who now overcame all resistance. In the year 1420,
another treaty was signed by which Henry was to receive the
French crown on the death of the reigning King of France.
The remaining years of the war were full of English failures.
The French king outlived Henry, who was succeeeded by his
infant son, Henry VI. Thus the English lost a great leader.
The French, too, were suddenly inspired by a peasant girl named
Joan of Arc, who declared that she had been called by God to
save her country. Under her leadership the armies of France
proved invincible. Shortly afterwards she was captured by the
English, who burned her as a witch. But her influence had
caused the French to lay aside many of the quarrels which had
divided them. Their advance was made still more easy by the
weakness of the English, who were quarrelling among themselves.
Thus by the year 1453 the French had reconquered the whole
of France, except the town of Calais, which the English retained
for more than a hundred years longer.
The war wrought important changes in England itself. The
dream of an English Empire, which included much of France,
practically vanished. French ways became unpopular. The
French language, which had been spoken by the upper classes
of England since the days of the Conqueror, also became un-
popular. English became the common language of the English
people. Then, as time went by, men forgot the defears, but
memories of Crecy, Poitiers, and Agin court still lingered. It
is under the inspiration of traditions such as these that British
subjects of later days, by their toiling and fighting, have won for us
an Empire vaster than France, one within whose limits is included
nearly one quarter of the land area of the world.

IX.—THE EARLY TUDORS.
The Hundred Years’ War was hardly over before another
struggle broke out within England itself. The nobles were
divided, some of them fighting for the Duke of York against
others who supported the king, Henry VI. This struggle, later
known as the Wars of the Hoses, exerted a great influence on
English history. Henry Vlthe last of the Lancastrian sovereigns,
was murdered in the Tower of London. England then came
under the sway of Yorkist kings for a period of twenty-four years.
The last ruler of that line of monarchs was slain in the battle of
Bosworth, in the year 1485. The crown then passed to Henry
VII. He was the first of the Tudor sovereigns who occupied
the throne for nearly one hundred and twenty years. So im-
portant were the changes introduced during this period that it
is necessary that they should be remembered.
Henry VII. realized that the weakness of the Crown had been
due to the strength of the nobles and the poverty of the king.
These two faults he determined to remedy. The power of the
nobles lay largely in the support which they received from men
who wore their badges or liveries. These followers fought for
their lords in return for the protection and maintenance which they
received. Laws had been passed against the wearing of liveries,
but the nobles had been strong enough to defy them. The Wars
of the Roses had weakened the nobility, and now Henry estab-
lished a special court, so strong that it stood in no fear of the
nobles. Those who refused to obey the law were tried and
fined. To this court was given, at a later date, the name of the
Star Chamber. In addition to this, the nobles discovered that
their castles were no longer as safe as they had been, for the
king now possessed cannon with which he could batter their
walls. By these means the power of the barons was so reduced
that never after this do we hear of their defiance of the Crown,
as we did in Stephen’s reign or during the Wars of the Roses.
Henry’s success was due partly to the wealth which he was
rapidly acquiring. This he obtained in several ways, some of
which were not lawful. He demanded “ benevolences ” of his
people. He fined those who opposed him, instead of executing
■them. Wars he avoided, as they were expensive. On one
occasion he landed in France with an army, but the French


offered him a “ good round sum ”to return, and he did so. In
the hope of avoiding war with Scotland, he married his daughter
to the Scottish king. On another occasion he reduced the ruler
of Flanders to terms by simply cutting off all English trade with
his subjects. Thus, during his life he saved the enormous sum
of £1,800,000, equal to at least ten times that amount at the
present time. His wealth made him almost independent of
Parliament. It was no easy matter to wring privileges from a
wealthy ruler. In fact, Parliament was seldom summoned during
the Tudor period. The late civil wars had shown the people
of England how weak that body was when not supported by the
king. This is why they allowed these rulers to exercise almost
despotic power, for they recognized that peace remained only
while the king was strong. The Tudors, however, were not absolute
monarchs. They usually succeeded in forcing their wishes on
their Parliaments, but they were wise enough to give way when
it was expedient to do so. Their rule produced order, and thus
the Tudor period has been called a period of benevolent despotism.
It was during Henry the Seventh’s reign, in the year 1492,
that Christopher Columbus, sailing under the orders of the King
of Spain, discovered the West Indies. Shortly afterwards the
Spaniards made their way to America, where they founded
settlements. The importance of this discovery will be shown
in the study of Queen Elizabeth’s reign.
Henry VIII. entered upon his rule under favourable circum-
stances. The nobles were weak, the crown wealthy and popular.
Three important changes must be noticed during his reign.
The first is an advancement of education, due to the influence of
the Renascence, or the new birth of learning. In the year 1453, the
Turks had captured Constantinople, which had been the capital
of the Eastern Roman Empire* for more than 1,100 years. This
caused many of the learned men of that city to seek new homes.
They settled chiefly in Southern Europe, and immediately began
to teach those about them. Men were aroused; Greek and
Latin were eagerly studied.. The enthusiasm spread until it
reached England. The peaceful days of the first two Tudors
encouraged the movement. Schools were built, colleges founded,
and students flocked to attend the lectures that were delivered.
Others in their enthusiasm travelled all over Europe in their
search for knowledge. Thus the way was prepared for the
literary triumphs which gave such a lustre to the reign of the last
Tudor.
* See Map in Chapter V.


The second change was the reformation of the Church in
England. As men read more widely they became more critical.
The result was that they found fault with the church of their day.
The immediate cause of the Eeformation, however, was a quarrel
between the Pope and Henry VIII. The king desired a divorce
from his wife, but this the Pope was unwilling to grant. Henry,
who always resented opposition, then summoned a Parliament,
which declared the king to be the Supreme Head of the Church
of England, and this is the system which prevails at the present
time.
The third change was the foundation of the navy as it now
exists. Before this time there had been no permanent naval force.
Kings had the right to call upon some of their subjects to supply
ships and to serve on the sea just as they summoned their warriors
to fight on the land. Then when the term of service had been
completed the owners employed their vessels in other ways,
often on cruises of piracy. Henry VIII. established the practice
of setting aside a part of the revenue for the building and repairing
of ships-of-war. Thus the king had a permanent naval force
at his command. For many years, however, these alone were
not sufficient to defend the country. Only about one-fifth of
the ships that defeated the Spanish Armada belonged to Queen
Elizabeth. But the active part which Henry took explains why
be is often called the “ Founder of the British Navy.”

X. — THE ELIZABETHAN PERIOD.
A study of the various lines of English kings reveals the fact
that the reign of the last ruler in each case was usually a failure.
The evils which England endured during the days of Stephen
and Henry YI. provide illustrations. But this was not the case
with the Tudor sovereigns. The reign of Elizabeth (1558-1603)
was in many respects the most famous that England has experi-
enced, for it was a period of triumphs at home and victories
abroad. Whether in peace or in war, the Elizabethan era was one
of which Englishmen have cause to be proud.
Throughout the greater part of her reign England was at war
with Spain. This was due to various causes. The King of Spain
was a sincere Catholic, while Elizabeth, following the action of
her father, Henry VIII., defied the power of the Pope by pro-
claiming herself Supreme Head of the Church of England. But
there were other causes which affected the power of Spain directly.
These were concerned with trade and colonies, and they led to
much quarrelling and fighting before war was definitely declared.
The Spanish Empire included the Netherlands as well as a
great part of Central and Southern America. Her ships, while
trading with the Netherlands, passed through the English Channel.
Here they were often attacked and plundered by English sailors,
who regarded the Spaniards as their national enemies. They
did this without the express permission of their queen, and during
a time of peace. In her trade with her American colonies, Spain
was equally unfortunate. “No peace beyond the line ”* was a
very common saying at the time. All the Spanish colonies lay
beyond this line, which, passing through the present country of
Brazil, separated the territories of Portugal on the east from
* After the voyage of Columbus, in 1492, a dispute arose between Spain
and Portugal concerning colonies. To settle the matter they appealed to
the Pope, who drew a dividing line across the map. A year later this was
moved farther to the west until it took the position shown in our map.
Spain then claimed all that lay beyond this line. On the other side of the
world the Pope’s line passed near Cape York, the most northerly point
of Australia. Portugal, therefore, was entitled to claim possession of
Brazil, Africa, Asia, as well as the greater portions of Australia and the
East Indies.


those of Spain on the west. English sailors considered it no
wrong to attack Spanish ships in these western waters, even
although their rulers were at peace. In fact, however, the
fighting was not confined only to this area. These attacks were
made chiefly because of the wealth that could thus be obtained,
for the Spanish colonies were rich in mines. Drake, on one of
his voyages, had seen a pile of silver bars, which he guessed to be
seventy feet long, ten feet wide, and twelve feet high. From
time to time treasure like this was conveyed to Spain, and
Englishmen were quite ready to risk their lives to secure some of
it. The result was continual fighting in which the English
generally won.
There were other Englishmen who were anxious to secure
wealth by trading with the Spanish colonies. John Hawkins,
a man of Devon, discovered that the colonists were in need of
labourers to work their mines and plantations. He, therefore,
filled his ships with negroes, whom he collected on the coast of
Western Africa. By selling these to the Spanish settlers he
became a wealthy man, returning to England with a valuable
store of hides, sugar, ginger, and pearls. Other traders followed
his example. But the Spanish monarch considered that all
the produce of his colonies shouM go to Spain alone. He, there-
fore, forbade all but his own subjects to trade with his American
possessions. Englishmen disregarded this prohibition. Hawkins
himself set out again with a fleet of five vessels. On this
occasion he was not so lucky. He was attacked by a larger
Spanish fleet and returned with two ships only.
Other Englishmen were interested in establishing colonies in
America. Among these Sir Walter Raleigh took an important
place. His half-brother, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, who had planted
a settlement in Newfoundland, had been drowned when at-
tempting to return to England in the Squirrel, a vessel of ten tons.
Raleigh, who was a great favourite of Elizabeth, because of his
courtly ways, now attempted to establish the colony of Virginia.
Some two or three hundred settlers were conveyed thither; but
his efforts ended in failure because of the foolishness of the
colonists themselves. They showed little desire to work in their
new home. Many of them had gone only because they believed
that wealth was easily obtained in America. The clearing of
forests, the ploughing and sowing, did not appeal to them. More-
over, they threatened their very existence by provoking the
Indians. Many of them returned with Drake, who chanced to
visit the settlement; the others were never heard of again ;

probably they were massacred by the Indians. Those who
returned brought with them potatoes and tobacco, things quite
unknown to the ordinary Englishman of the time. An old story
tells us that on one occasion while Raleigh was smoking, his
servant, believing him to be on fire, threw water over him. In
spite of his failure to establish a colony, he was a very able man.
One writer has called him “ the most brilliant and many-sided
of the Devonshire heroes of the reign.” He had sailed to New-
foundland with Gilbert, in the year 1583. He took an active part
in crushing an Irish rebellion which occurred a little later. He was


one of the leaders of the fleet that defeated the Armada. His
fortunes changed with the death of Elizabeth. During the reign
of James 1., whom Raleigh disliked because of his desire for an
alliance with Spain, he was accused of plotting, and imprisoned
in the Tower of London for twelve years. During this period
he wrote a book called the “ History of the World.” Then he
was released to go in search of a gold mine in South America.
While engaged in this search he fought the Spaniards, which
James had forbidden him to do. The king’s displeasure was
increased when Raleigh returned without the promised gold.
Shortly afterwards he was beheaded. Thus his attempt at
colonizing was not the only work which made him famous.
It was, however, another of those causes which increased the
anger of the King of Spain, who feared the entry of the
English into what he considered to be his own dominions.
But, possibly, no one aroused the Spanish monarch more than
did Sir Francis Drake, who also was a man of Devon. He was
a cousin of Sir John Hawkins, and had accompanied him on
that disastrous voyage which has already been described.
Several later voyages he made to the West Indies. On one
occasion he landed on the Isthmus of Panama, attacked th*
mule train which conveyed the silver across that narrow strip
of land, secured his first glimpse of the Pacific Ocean by climbing
a high tree, plundered two hundred Spanish vessels, and then,
having lost his own two ships, returned with his booty in one
which he had captured. In the year 1577 he set out on his most
memorable voyage. His own ship, the Pelican , which he re-
named the Golden Hind, was only of one hundred tons. With it
started four other smaller vessels which failed to complete the
voyage. Passing down the eastern coast of South America, he
succeeded in making his way through the Straits of Magellan.
The Spaniards never dreamed that the English would attack
them in the Pacific Ocean. Their ships and towns were practi-
cally unprotected. Drake, therefore, took what he pleased.
Hearing that the great treasure ship which, each year, carried
to Panama all the wealth secured along the coast, was just ahead
of him, he hastened northwards and captured her. Throwing
his ballast overboard he filled the bottom of his ship with silver
bars instead. His next task was to return. He knew well that
the Spaniards would be lying in wait if he tried to pass the Straits
of Magellan again. He, therefore, resolved to attempt to sail
around the north of America instead, taking with him a pilot
and some charts which he had captured on the way. Finding
D


that the coast turned to the west he gave up the attempt. Then,
after refitting his vessel at a place near the present city of San
Francisco, he set out across the Pacific. His ship ran on a reef
near the island of Java, but fortunately she came off again.
Then, after crossing the Indian Ocean he rounded the Cape
of Good Hope, and reached Plymouth after an absence of three
years. The English were wild with enthusiasm. He was the
first of their race to circumnavigate the world. Elizabeth
knighted him in recognition of his daring.
At last the King of Spain determined to punish England for
all her misdeeds. He began to collect a great fleet; but while
his preparations were still incomplete Drake sailed into Cadiz
Harbour and burned thirty-seven of his ships. This act he
humorously described as “ Singeing the King of Spain’s beard.”
Next year, 1588, the Invincible Armada, as the Spaniards called
it, sailed for England. It consisted of one hundred and thirty
vessels, one-third of which were store ships, practically useless
in battle. Counting all the “ volunteer ” ships, the English
fleet totalled more than this number, but many of them were
little more than boats. It contained only from seventy to one
hundred that could effectively engage the Spaniards, but the
brunt of the fight fell on those which formed the standing navy,
about twenty-five in number. Drake at least was not alarmed ;
while playing a game of bowls he was informed that the Armada
was in sight, but: “he stooped and finished the game.” For a
week the two fleets fought in the Channel. The Spaniards, whose
ships were crammed with soldiers, desired to board their enemy’s
vessels ; but their ships could not sail as close to the wind as
could those of the English who, by keeping to windward,
succeeded in preventing them from coming alongside. At last,
sorely battered by the better artillery of their enemies and with
reduced numbers, the Spaniards retired into the Port of Calais.
From here they were driven by fire-ships and again attacked.
The wind continued to blow from the south ; the Spanish ships,
unable to sail against it, were driven northwards. The English
pursued them nearly as far as the Firth of Forth and then returned,
as many of their vessels were short of supplies. The Spaniards
sailed round the north of Scotland, but only fifty-three ships
succeeded in reaching Spain. Thus the attempt to punish
England ended in disaster. Elizabeth gave the credit of the
victory to the winds that strewed the coasts of Scotland and
Ireland with Spanish wrecks. Only nine vessels had been taken


or sunk by tbe English ; the others perished at the hands of the
elements. But it must not be forgotten that the Spaniards
had been defeated while in the Channel. The superior ships,
guns, and tactics of the English had availed more than mere
numbers.

Hostilities did not end here. Another notable engagement
occurred three years later. The Revenge, under Sir Richard
Grenville, had been sent out with a fleet to capture the Spanish
treasure ships. The Spaniards had been warned, and a fleet of
fifty-three now appeared off the Azores to defend the Spanish
wealth. The English retired, but Grenville remained to pick
up certain men that had been ashore. Even then he could have


escaped by sailing around the Spanish fleet, but he refused.
He tried, instead, to cut his way right through its centre. For
fifteen hours the battle raged. Grenville was mortally wounded.
If he had had his own way he would have blown his ship to pieces
rather than surrender her. The Revenge was the only English
warship taken throughout the reign.
The traditions that originated in Elizabeth’s day are con-
:emed not only with war. No other reign has witnessed
greater literary triumphs. This was the time of William Shake-
speare. Bom at Stratford-on-Avon, he spent much of his time
in London in company with other great writers. His plays and
poems were of such a high standard that people still regard him
as the greatest poet that ever lived. His genius is shown not
only by the high standard of his work, but by the amount which
he produced. Before his death he had completed nearly forty
plays. They include comedies, histories, and tragedies. Among
his best known works are “ The Tempest,” “As You Like It,”
“ Hamlet,” “ Macbeth,” “ Henry V.,” and “ Julius Caesar.”
The deeds of Drake, Raleigh, and Grenville will ever be remem-
bered by Englishmen, but the name of Shakespeare will live in
the memories of the learned of all races as long as time itself shall
last.

XL.—THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN KING AND
PARLIAMENT.
Elizabeth died in the year 1603. Her successor, James VI.
of Scotland, who now became James I. of England, entered upon
his rule under happy circumstances. No rival contested his right
to the throne ; the dread of a Spanish invasion had passed, and
in its place was a sense of security. Herein lay one of the causes
of the troubles which were to come later. So long as Englishmen
had lived under the fear of baronial or Spanish oppression they
had had little time to consider matters of government. Now,
in the absence of immediate danger, they were able to turn their
attention to other things. They began to think more of their
rights ; no longer were they willing to submit without question
to a benevolent despotism such as the Tudors had exercised.
Under these circumstances, successful rule could only be secured
by the exercise of tact on the part of the ruler. Unfortunately,
neither James I. nor Charles 1., whom we shall call the “ early
Stuarts,” was tactful. Thus, from the very beginning of their
rule can be traced the causes which ultimately led to revolution.
The Elizabethan period had been famous because of its naval
victories ; the early Stuart period was conspicuous because of
its failures in war. To the south of the Netherlands.lay a State
named the Palatinate. This had been invaded by Spanish troops,
and its Protestant ruler, Frederick, who was a son-in-law of
James, had been forced to flee. James first proposed a marriage
between his son Charles and the Spanish Infanta, in the hope
that the Palatinate would be returned, but the proposal failed.
Then, in the last year of his reign, he sent an expedition to recover
the lost territory. This never reached its destination, for sickness
and starvation carried off three-quarters of the force while it
was still in Holland. Charles continued the struggle. Hoping to
repeat the famous exploits of the Elizabethan heroes, he sent
a fleet to capture the Spanish treasure ships and sack Cadiz, but
it returned without accomplishing either. Then, foolishly enough,
he entered upon a war with France, which proved equally disas-
trous. Repeated failures are never welcome, least of all to a
people accustomed to successes. Here, then, is another reason
for the unpopularity of these rulers.


The question of religion was another important cause. Before
James’s arrival in England both the Catholics and the Puritans
had expected support for their religions ; the former because
Mary Queen of Scots, the mother of James, had been a Catholic ;
the~latter because Scotland had adopted the Presbyterian form
of worship. Both were disappointed, as the new king continued
the Church of England system which Elizabeth had established.
One important result followed. Some of the Puritans left the
country and founded colonies in America. The first of these,
who sailed in the Mayflower in the year 1620, are still known as
the Pilgrim Fathers. During the reign of Charles the discontent
increased. William Laud, the Archbishop of Canterbury, believed
in doing everything thoroughly. To omit or to alter the ceremonies
of the church was in his opinion a serious offence. The Puritans
disliked ceremonies, but Laud would not tolerate any opposition ;
those who offended him were punished in the Court of High
Commission, which had been established by Elizabeth to correct
abuses in the church. In the year 1639, he attempted to introduce
this system into Scotland. Then the Scots rebelled and invaded
England.
Other disputes were concerned with the government of the
country. Men questioned whether the king alone or the king and
Parliament combined should be the supreme power in the country.
Both James and Charles declared that they ruled by divine right.
If this were the case, no one was entitled to criticise their deeds.
Many Englishmen, particularly the Puritans, denied this divine
authority. The bishops upheld it, and therefore they were
doubly disliked. The importance of the question can be shown
by a consideration of the king’s advisers. In the selection of
their ministers, both James and Charles pleased themselves.
With the advice of these ministers, they spent the money which
parliament supplied for the government of the country. This
was no new system, but the repeated failures, already referred to,
caused Parliament to desire to attach the blame to somebody.
They aimed, therefore, at making ministers responsible if failures
occurred. This was resented by both kings as an attack on their
royal privileges. Thus, when the Commons impeached Charles’s
minister, the Duke of Buckingham, after the Cadiz disaster, the
king ended the proceedings by dissolving Parliament. Another
important adviser whom Charles supported was the Earl of
Strafford. Although a very able man he was no supporter of
government by Parliament. He believed that the people should
submit to anv form of rule which the king considered good for


them. Englishmen thought otherwise, and Strafford was hated.
Money matters led to continual disputes. Charles levied forced
loans. Parliament, thoroughly aroused, refused to grant any
money until the king had signed the Petition of Eight, which it
presented in the year 1628. By this petition taxation without
the consent of Parliament, imprisonment without a shown cause,
the billeting of troops in private houses, and the application of
martial law in time of peace, were declared unlawful. Charles
signed the document, broke his word shortly afterwards, -and
dissolved Parliament in the following year. Then, for eleven years
England had no Parliaments. Throughout this period the king
was compelled to raise money as best he could. He still had
an income from the Crown lands, but that was not sufficient.
He tried various ways, the most famous of which was his levy of
ship money. This was needed, as the navy was in an unsatis-
factory condition. But Englishmen protested that the tax was
levied without the consent of Parliament. John Hampden, a
Buckinghamshire squire, refused to pay it. The case was taken
before the king’s judges, who declared that the tax was legal,
and Hampden was forced- to pay.
Charles further embittered his subjects by the way in which
he punished them in the Court of the Star Chamber, which had
been established early in the Tudor period to check the power
of the nobles. In this court there was no jury, the absence of
which Englishmen resented.
The revolt in Scotland, due to Laud’s attempted introduction
of his system of worship, ended the so-called Eleven Years’
Tyranny. Money was needed ; Charles, therefore, summoned
a Parliament in 1640. This he dissolved within three weeks, as it
advised him to make peace with the Scots. Men, therefore, called
it the Short Parliament. Later in the year another was sum-
moned, which was not formally dissolved until the year 1660.
This, the Long Parliament, was one of the most famous in English
history. Its first work was to reduce the power of the king,
who, lacking money, was helpless. Strafford was executed;
Laud imprisoned, to meet his death later : the Courts of High
Commission and Star Chamber were abolished, and ship money
was declared illegal. The members resolved also that only with
their consent could this parliament be dissolved.
All this been done under the leadership of John Pym, a
squire from Somerset. His unbounded energy, as well as his
ability in speech and action, gained for him’ such a prominent


position that men nicknamed him, “ King Pym.” Like manj
of the other members, he was a Presbyterian. He retained his
influence until his death three years later.
Charles still occupied the throne, but now he brought on war
by a very tactless act. Believing that the Commons were about
to impeach his queen, who was a Catholic, he took a force of
soldiers to the House, entered, and attempted to arrest Pym,
Hampden, and three others, who, however, had escaped. The
Commons were aroused ; the king by entering in this way had
defied their privileges. Moreover, they saw that their leaders’
lives were in danger. A few months later the Great Civil War
commenced in the year 1642.
The king was supported by a majority of the Lords, but the
advantage, both in numbers and wealth, remained with Parlia-
ment. Nearly two-thirds of the total population of England
supported its cause. These, for the most part, lived to the east
of a line stretching from the River Humber to Southampton.
The fleet, also, by its support, prevented Charles from gaining
assistance elsewhere. At first the king was successful. He
gained an indecisive victory at Edgehill. Hampden was slain
in a skirmish on Chalgrove Field, near Oxford. Under these
circumstances, Pym looked to the Scots for aid. They consented
on the understanding that England should accept the Presby-
terian religion. With their aid, in the year 1644, the king’s
force was defeated at Marston Moor. A few months later the
Parliamentary army was reorganized and received the name of
the New Model. This took the field and completely defeated
the royal forces at Naseby in the year 1645. Within a few
months Charles surrendered to the Scots, who delivered him to
Parliament.
During the war, another man had risen to prominence. He
was Oliver Cromwell, a squire from Huntingdon. He had taken
an active part in the early work of the Long Parliament, but it
was his genius in war which secured him his reputation. His
well-drilled troop of “ honest, sober Christians ” soon earned for
themselves the name of “ Ironsides.” The successes at Marston
Moor and Naseby had been due chiefly to his efforts. In the
New Model he commanded all the cavalry, then the more im-
portant branch of the army. About three years later he destroyed
the army of the Scots, who now desired to restore Charles to his
throne, because he had promised that England should adopt the
Presbyterian religion as soon as he had regained his power. Not

only were the Scots defeated, but the Presbyterian members of
Parliament were expelled by the army. Then, early in the
following year (1649), Charles was tried and executed. A few
days later the House of Lords was abolished.
For four years England was ruled by the House of Commons,
but the real power in the land was the army. Only about ninety
members remained out of nearly five hundred that had been
elected in the year 1640. Men nicknamed these the 41 Rump.”
Revolts occurred both in Scotland and Ireland, but they were
put down by the army under Cromwell’s leadership. The soldiers
then quarrelled with the “ Rump.” Finally, in the year 1653,
Cromwell drove the members from the House and locked the
doors.
The army, however, had no wish to rule the country. It now
called together a body of earnest Puritans, generally called the
Saints, to take the place of the Rump. These men quarrelled
so fiercely among themselves and proved so unpractical that few
were sorry when they dissolved themselves five months later.
Then, in the last month of the year 1653, Cromwell was pro-
claimed Lord Protector. A few months later a Parliament was
elected, but it failed to work satisfactorily. A dispute arose
about the control of the army and the members were dismissed.
The discontent within the country then compelled Cromwell to
divide England into eleven military districts, over each of which
he placed a major-general, whose duty it was to maintain order.
To Englishmen this was little less than military rule. They
were tired of an army which was always at hand to enforce
obedience. In the year 1656, a second Parliament was elected.
The members offered the crown to Cromwell, who refused it,
partly because he recognized that the new title would be unpopular
with the army. Disputes followed, and this Parliament was
dissolved also On September 3rd, 1658, the anniversary of his
great victories over the Scots at Dunbar and Worcester, Cromwell
died.
A period of great confusion followed. Richard Cromwell, who
succeeded his father, quarrelled with the army leaders and
abdicated early in the following year. The army then recalled
the Rump, which had never formally dissolved itself. The
members wished to reduce the army; thus they were dissolved,
only to be restored later in the year. Then General Monk, who
had commanded the English army in Scotland for both Oliver
and his son, marched into England with his troops. No force
opposed him, for the army was now divided against itself.


Through his influence, the Rump dissolved itself, and a new
Parliament was elected. This body offered the crown to Prince
Charles, the son of Charles I. He entered London amid great
rejoicing on his birthday, May 29th, in the year 1660, and com-
menced to reign as Charles 11.

XII.—EXPANSION OF EMPIRE.
Introduction.
The year 1660 was famous, not only because of the return of
Charles II.: m ore important was the restoration of the old popular
government by King, Lords, and Commons. Charles, although
in many ways a bad man, was tactful enough to avoid serious
disputes with his Parliaments, and thus he ruled until his death,
in the year 1685. His brother, James 11., who succeeded him,
foolishly attempted to suspend and set aside laws which had been
passed by earlier Parliaments. Another rebellion followed, in
the year 1688, but James succeeded in escaping to France. War
soon followed, for Louis XIY., the French king, provided James
with troops with which he attempted unsuccessfully to conquer
Ireland. After James’s death, the English* throne was claimed
by his son, usually called the Old Pretender, who also received
French assistance. A fresh war with France commenced, and in
this Great Britain secured Gibraltar, Newfoundland, and Nova
Scotia -t
Other causes increased the illfeeling which existed between
the two countries. In India, the merchants of France and Great
Britain competed for the wealth of that great laud. In North
America, the colonists of the two countries wore constantly in
conflict. In the West Indies, a similar struggle was in progress.
Thus, the desire for trade and colonies was the cause of much
fighting between the two enemies. Another war broke out in
the year 1739. The French took Madras in India ; the British
captured a great fortress named Louisburg in North America,
but when peace was signed, in the year 1748, the two places were
exchanged.
In the year 1756, the two opponents entered upon the Seven
Years’ War. At first the British were very unsuccessful. But
failure changed to success when the conduct of the war was
entrusted to William Pitt, afterwards known as the Earl of
Chatham. He selected his admirals and generals because of
their ability. Many of them were young men who were filled
with enthusiasm . Careful plans of campaigns were arranged and
the necessary men and materials supplied. Victories now took
the place of defeats. When peace was signed, in the year 1763,
the power of Great Britain was greatly increased. The French

surrendered Canada , as well as their lands which lay to the east
of the River Mississippi. In India, their settlements were restored
to them on the condition that they should not fortify them.
Florida, certain islands in the West Indies, and the French colony
on the River Senegal in Northern Africa, were also added to the
British possessions.
Canada.
The struggle in Canada had been one of long duration. The
French had discovered the River St. Lawrence fifty years before
Raleigh attempted to found colonies in North America. Their
early settlement is associated with the name of Samuel Cham-
plain, who laid the foundation of the present city of Quebec in
the year 1608. Thus the French colonization of America began
about the same time as that of the English,* who first established
a permanent settlement in Virginia in the year 1607. But
while the British remained near the coast the French pushed
their way inland. They discovered the Great Lakes and the
Mississippi, which they followed to its mouth. All the land
which they traversed they claimed for France, but what is more
important, they supported their claim by building forts. Then,
having hemmed in the British, they desired to drive them out
of America. In this they were generally supported by the
Indians, with whom the French were much more friendly than
were the Brtiish. Had they received the aid of all the tribes
their task would have been easier. Fortunately for the British,
at an earlier date the French had aroused the anger of the
Iroquois, a very powerful group of tribes living to the south
of Lake Ontario.
Little peace existed in North America. From time to time
the British colonists attacked the settlements of the French, who,
with their Indian allies, raided the lands of the British. Then
in the Seven Years’ War Pitt determined to capture Quebec,
the chief fortress in Canada. For some years before this the
French, under their able governor, Montcalm, had secured some
successes. Three forces were now sent against Quebec. One,
setting out from Lake Ontario, was to advance down the river; the
second was to march northwards from the River Hudson; while
the third was to enter the mouth of the River St. Lawrence and
sail up to the city. General Wolfe, a young man, thirty-two years
of age, and one of Pitt’s favourite officers, was put in command
of this third force, which alone reached Quebec. With him were

a fleet and nine thousand soldiers. He attempted to take the
city by storm, but was repulsed, for the banks of the river were
high and crowned with fortifications. Moreover, Montcalm
had at his command a force of over fifteen thousand men. The
season wore on ; other attempts failed ; Wolfe, whose constitu-
tion, in spite of his bravery and determination, was a weak one,
began to feel the strain. The task seemed hopeless ; then he
determined on the plan of sending his army up a zig-zag path
which led to the top of the cliffs at a point less than two miles
above the city. The attempt was a desperate one, for a small
force at the summit could easily have prevented the ascent.
To distract the attention of the enemy the troops lower down
the river were ordered to make an attack on the city. Then, in
the darkness, the men were transferred from the ships, which lay
some miles up the river, to the boats. With muffled oars and
carried swiftly by the current, they rapidly approached the
landing place. The silence was oppressive ; to relieve the tension
of his mind, Wolfe quietly recited to those about him the famous
lines of Gray’s “ Elegy in a Country Churchyard,” remarking
when he had finished: “ I would rather be the author of that poem
than take Quebec.” Suddenly, the silence was broken by the
challenge of a sentry. Fortunately, in one of the boats was a
man who could speak the French language. His answers deceived
the watchers, who were expecting the arrival of some provision
boats, and the troops passed by in safety to land a little lower
down the stream. Twenty-four volunteers led the way to the top
and surprised the small force stationed there. The others
followed rapidly. By the morning about four thousand men
were ready for battle on the summit, which was named the
Heights of Abraham. Montcalm now decided to attack. His
troops advanced until they were within about thirty yards of
the British, Then they received two volleys, which broke their
lines. In the confusion which followed the British advanced
with levelled bayonets. Just at this moment Wolfe, already
twice wounded, was struck down by a bullet which pierced his
chest. He was told that the French were running. His face
lightened ; with a smile on his lips he uttered his last words:
“ Now I die contented.”
Montcalm, also, was mortally wounded in the battle. A few
days later the city surrendered. The French still held out in
Montreal, but this was captured in the following year. When
peace was proclaimed, in the year 1763, the whole of Canada passed
to the British.


India.
The sea route to the East was discovered by Vasco da Gama
(a Portuguese captain), who rounded the Cape of Good Hope in
the year 1497 The Portuguese then established trading stations
both in India and in the islands of the East Indies. Stories of
the wealth that they were obtaining soon reached England, but
India, showing places referred to in the text.
it was not until the reign of Elizabeth that Englishmen attempted
seriously to share in that wealth. In the year 1600, the East
India Company was formed in the City of London. In the
following year this company despatched its first fleet to the East.
The Portuguese did all that was in their power to exclude their


rivals, but the English persisted in spite of their opposition. At
first they directed their attention to the islands of the East Indies.
Valuable cargoes of pepper, cloves, nutmegs, and spices were
obtained. But from here they were driven by the Dutch, who
soon claimed not only a share, but also a monopoly of the trade.
Their heavily armed ships were more than a match for those of
the company, which now turned its attention in the direction of
India. The land at this time was under the rule of an Emperor
who lived at Delhi. He was often called the Mogul, Under
him were many lesser rulers who governed the various provinces
into which the country was divided. As time went by these
gradually shook off the power of the Emperor until some of them
became practically independent. Then the absence of a single
strong ruler, and the disputes which occurred within the land
itself, laid the country open to attacks by Europeans.
From the Mogul Emperor the company obtained the right to
establish a trading station at Surat. Others were afterwards
set up at Madras, Bombay, and at various other places. At
first the desire was for trade only ; the company had no intention
of conquering or ruling India.
It was the rivalry of the French which compelled the British
to adopt measures of war. In France, another company had been
established to trade with the East. Its chief station was Pondi-
cherry, which lay about one hundred miles to the south of Madras.
Here, in the years which preceded the Seven Years’ War, was
stationed a very able governor named Dupleix. Although his
duty was to trade, he soon formed the idea of adding India to the
French Empire. He first raised a native force, which was drilled
by French officers ; then the lack of a single strong ruler in the
land gave him his opportunity. When disputes arose within
the neighbouring provinces he adopted the plan of aiding one of
the rivals with his well drilled troops. By this means he over-
came the other and secured for himself privileges from the prince,
whom he had supported. In this way he soon acquired an influ-
ence over some of the most powerful rulers in southern India
Then the British realised that if they wished to retain their
places in India they would have to imitate the actions of their
enemies. The ruler of the long strip of land which contained
both Pondicherry and Madras had secured his authority by French
assistance. His right to rule was disputed by a native rival
whom the British therefore, supported. It was in the course
of this struggle that Robert Clive came into prominence by his
capture of Arcot, the capital of the disputed area.


Clive, in early life, had shown himself to be a boy of spirit. At
the age of six he had formed a reputation for himself, because of
his readiness to fight the other boys about him. He was a source
of trouble both to his parents and the neighbours. On one occasion
it is said he alarmed the villagers by climbing the church steeple
and seating himself on a stone spout which projected near its top.
Then, as he descended, his foot slipped, but, fortunately, the ivy
which he was holding supported his weight. At the age of
eighteen he became a clerk in the employ of the East India Com-
pany and was sent to Madras. He found no happiness in his new
position ; so despondent did he become that he attempted to
put an end to his own life, but, although he pulled the trigger twice,
his pistol did not fire. He soon decided to enter the army. Then,
in the year 1751, as stated above, he captured Arcot, and with a
force of two hundred and thirty men defended the city against
an army of ten thousand for fifty days, after which the enemy
retired. . Three years later Dupleix was recalled in disgrace ;
but the struggle did not end until the capture of Pondicherry
by General Eyre Coote, in the year 1761.
Meanwhile trouble had arisen in Bengal. In the first year of
the Seven Years’ War, Surajah Dowlah, the ruler of Bengal,
captured Calcutta because the British had refused to surrender
one of his relatives who had sought their protection. He then
locked one' hundred and forty-six Europeans, including one
woman, in a jail, eighteen feet long by fourteen feet wide, com-
monly called the “ Black Hole.” In the morning only twenty-
three of them, including the woman, were alive. Clive was
quickly despatched to Calcutta. He recaptured the city, and
shortly afterwards set out to punish Dowlah, who had also given
assistance to the French. With a force of about three thousand,
less than one-third of which were Europeans, he engaged Dow-
lah’s force of over fifty thousand at Plassey, in the year 1757.
Numbers counted for little in this battle ; some of the enemy
deserted to the British, and Clive gained a decisive victory with
a loss of twenty-three men. Dowlah was deposed and another
ruler was set up in his place. Shortly afterwards, Clive became
the Governor of dll the British settlements in India. This
position he retained until his return to England, in the year 1760.
He was now a very wealthy man ; in addition, he received the
title of Lord Clive. Five years later he was in India again. On
this occasion he distinguished himself by putting an end to the
corruption by which the officials of the company were enriching
themselves at the expense of the natives. Clive himself had


been guilty of similar action during bis earlier period in India.
Thus, when he returned to England, two years later, his enemies
in Parliament tried to impeach him. In this they failed, but the
attack weighed heavily on the mind of one whose health had been
undermined by many years of service in India. In his fiftieth
year he put an end to his life. In such circumstances closed the
career of him by whose efforts the foundation of British power
in India had been so firmly laid.

XIII.—THE STRUGGLE FOR WORLD POWER.
The enmity which existed between Great Britain and France
continued long after the conclusion of the Seven Years’ War..
Thirteen years later the British colonies in North America, which
bordered on the Atlantic Ocean, but not including Nova Scotia,
revolted, and, with French assistance, established their inde-
pendence. By the aid which she gave, France increased her
national debt, which was already a heavy one, while at the same
time she acquired little territory. The burden of this debt,
combined with much injustice from which the lower classes of
France had been suffering for a very long time, led to a revolution
in the year 1789. A republic was established ; the French king,
queen, and many of the nobles were executed. The lands of the
nobility, as well as those of the church, were confiscated. The
revolutionaries soon formed themselves into groups which fought
one with the other. They also called upon the other peoples of
Europe to imitate their actions and volunteered to aid them in
their struggle for liberty. This aroused the rulers of Europe,
who, one by one, declared war on France. But the French fought
with enthusiasm in defence of their newly acquired freedom, and
the invading armies were hurled back. Then, as is usual in such
stirring times as those were, the strongest man came to the top
TTis name was Napoleon Bonaparte.
Napoleon was born in Corsica, an island lying to the south of
France. From his earliest years he desired to be a soldier.
Among his chief delights as a boy were beating a drum and
wielding a sword. At the age of fifteen he became a cadet in a
military college in Paris. Here he worked so diligently that
after his training had been completed he gained early promotion
in the army. Four years after the outbreak of the Revolution
he was a general of a brigade. A writer of the time stated that
he was possessed of “ too much bravery.” The French leaders
soon recognised his military genius. The other great powers
of Europe allied their forces against the French, but under-
Napoleon’s leadership the armies of France swept away all opposi-
tion on land. Italians, Austrians, Spaniards, Prussians, Russians,
as well as others were defeated in battle. One of his brothers


became the Ring of Holland, another the King of Spain, another
the King of Westphalia, a district situated to the east of the
River Rhine, while his brother-in-law received the crown of
Naples. He himself was the King of Italy as well as the Emperor
of the French. The government of France lay practically in his
own hands, as the French Assembly had been driven from power.
Many of the obsolete laws of France were replaced by better
measures and the country was ruled firmly.
But there was one country which had not been defeated. It
lay across the narrow strip of water called the English Channel,
which was always guarded by a powerful fleet. Armies were
useless against ships of war ; French fleets were collected only
to be defeated ; the merchant vessels of France stayed in port
or were captured by the enemy. On one occasion Napoleon did
collect a large army on the northern coast of France in the hope
of conveying it to England, but the opportunity never presented
itself. At last, in anger, he forbade any British ship to enter
the ports of Europe. By this measure he hoped to ruin the trade
of Great Britain, upon which that country so largely depended.
But the peoples of Europe could not afford to lose the goods which
the British manufactured Into Germany and Holland as well
as into other countries the goods were conveyed secretly in spite
of the Emperor’s orders. The Russians practically defied his
commands. Napoleon, therefore, led an army to Moscow.
Although he defeated the Russians on the way, he found the city
on fire and all the stores of food that he needed so badly, removed.
A terrible fate awaited the army on its homeward march. The
Russians were always at hand to cut off stragglers. Starvation,
and the cold of a northern winter, settled upon the unfortunate
soldiers. Over six hundred thousand men entered Russia; less
than sixty thousand succeeded in escaping from it. The peoples
of Europe now saw their opportunity and their armies combined
again. Napoleon, after abdicating in the year 1814, was banished
to the Island of Elba,
Great Britain had played no small part in breaking the power
of this leader of the French. On the sea, particularly, bad her
power been revealed. Fortunately, there lived at this time an
admiral generally regarded as the most famous in British history.
This was Horatio Nelson, usually known as Lord Nelson. He
was born in Norfolk; his father was a clergyman. In his
thirteenth year he went to sea as a midshipman. Two years
later he sailed with an expedition to the Arctic. There he
distinguished himself by attempting to attack a polar bear


with the butt of his musket, because, as he afterwards said, he
desired to take its skin to his father. Fortunately, a gun, fired from
the ship, alarmed the animal before the boy was close enough
to receive any injury. At the age of twenty he was a captain.
His rapid promotion can be accounted for partly by his eagerness
to do things and by his habit of always doing them to the best
of his ability. The war with France gave him his opportunity.
He fought in the battle of St. Vincent in the year J 797, and the
victory was largely due to an act of disobedience on his part.
His genius detected a weakness in the method of attack. Without
orders, he left the British line and attacked one of the enemy’s
leading vessels, thus frustrating their plans. In the following
year Napoleon sailed with an army to Egypt. His intention
was to punish Great Britain by destroying her power in India. He
succeeded in evading the British fleet and in landing his force
on the Delta of the Eiver Nile. To protect their ships the
French then anchored them close to the shore, in the evening
Nelson entered the harbour with his fleet. After a desperate
battle only two out of the enemy’s thirteen ships succeeded in
escaping. Shortly afterwards a dispute arose with the Danes.
The British had adopted the plan of searching all ships to see
if they were carrying French goods. The Danes resented this.
Fearing that the Danish fleet would soon be used by the French, a
British squadron was sent to Copenhagen in the year 1801.
Nelson was second in command. The Danes anchored their
ships close to the batteries on the shore. After the battle had
raged for three hours the British commander, who was some
distance away, became alarmed and signalled the ships to retire.
Nelson refused ; placing the telescope to his right eye, the sight
of which had been destroyed in an earlier engagement, he declared
he could not see the signal. The battle continued and ended
in a victory for the British. In the year 1805, Napoleon
succeeded in securing a powerful fleet by combining those of
France and Spain. With this he hoped to clear the Channel,
which would enable his army to cross over to England., Again
be was doomed to disappointment. Off Cape Trafalgar his
thirty-three ships were met by Nelson’s fleet of twenty-seven.
The British commander himself sailed on the Victory. As his
ships approached the enemy he sent aloft his famous signal:
“ England expects every man to do his duty.” Then the fleets
engaged. A little more than an hour later Nelson was struck
by a musket ball. In spite of warning, he had dressed himself
in his admiral’s uniform, upon which were the various decorations


which he had won in former battles. This made him a good mark
for the enemy’s snipers, who were stationed high up in the rigging.
It was his last and greatest victory. Eighteen prizes were taken
in the battle. Four others escaped to be captured by other
British ships. Eleven of the enemy succeeded in reaching
Cadiz. Before the battle was over Nelson had died, but the fear
of a French invasion had passed.
On land also the British had played no mean part. Their
most famous general was Arthur Wellesley, afterwards known
as the Duke of Wellington. He was born in Ireland, educated
at Eton, and, like Napoleon, entered a military college. Later
he was sent to India, where he gained great distinction by defeating
the forces of some of the native rulers who were opposing the
power of Great Britain. Then, after Napoleon had conquered the
whole of the Spanish Peninsula, he was sent to Portugal in
command of a small force. The Spaniards and the Portuguese
proved but poor fighters. They often failed to support him in
his work. Although he gained victories, four years had passed
before he could enter France. So difficult was his position that
he was compelled to dig long lines of trenches into which his men
could retire when pressed by the enemy. But after the destruc-
tion of Napoleon’s army in Russia, many of the French troops
in Spain were withdrawn. Wellington then advanced across the
Pyrenees, and his entrance into France was one of the means
of making Napoleon abdicate in the year 1814.
A few months later Napoleon returned to France. The French
soldiers sent to capture him supported him instead. Thus he
reached Paris in safety. Then, for a period known as the
Hundred Days, he again ruled over the French. The other powers
of Europe at once combined their forces against him. Napoleon
succeeded in defeating the Prussians, but on June 18th, in the
year 1815, he fought his last battle, against the Duke of Wellington
at Waterloo. Throughout the day the British squares repulsed
the repeated attacks of the enemy. Late in the afternoon the
Prussian army under Blucher was seen to be advancing to the
assistance of the British. Napoleon then ordered his finest
troops, the Old Guard, to advance upon the British squares.
They were repulsed ; the French then fled and were pursued
by the Prussians. Again Napoleon abdicated. On this occasion
he was sent to the distant island of St. Helena, where he remained
until his death six years later. The French never forgot their
great leader. In the year 1840 his body was conveyed to Paris
and buried amid scenes of great popular enthusiasm.

XIV.—THE BRITISH DOMINIONS AND THEIR
HEROES.
Part I. —India.
Even while Clive was still in India (1765) the East India Com-
pany had acquired some control over the Government of the
country. The Mogul had granted to the company the right to
collect and administer the revenue of three of the northern pro-
vinces. The powers of the company continued to increase so
that by the middle of the nineteenth century practically the
whole of India was either directly or indirectly under the control
of the British. But the company alone no longer governed
the country ; it now shared that responsibility with the British
Government. This system continued until the year 3858, that
is, until after the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny. The whole
of the administration was then transferred to the British Govern-
ment.
Many causes combined to bring about the Indian Mutiny..
The introduction of Western ideas alarmed the natives. To
their simple minds the telegraph was a form of magic. More-
over, some of the native rulers had been dispossessed of their
territories. These were only too ready to plot for the restoration
of their former rights. The Mogul still lived in Delhi. His
power was gone ; he no longer ruled over India as his ancestor®
had done, but those who disliked the British and their ways
always hoped for a renewal of his former greatness. The minds
of the people were stirred also by an old prophecy that British
rule would end one hundred years after the battle of Plassey,.
which, it will be remembered, had been fought in the year 1757.
In addition to these things the native soldiers, called Sepoys,,
outnumbered the white troops by about eight to one. The
immediate cause of the mutiny, however, was the new kind of
Cartridge which was just at this time supplied to the sepoys..
A report soon spread that these cartridges were greased with a.
mixture of cow’s fat and pig’s lard. The cow was sacred to the
Hindoos, while the religion of the Mohammedans forbade them
to touch any part of the pig. The natives commonly believed
that in this way the British were attempting to destroy theifi
religions.


The mutiny broke out in the north ; the sepoys marched to
Delhi. There, a British lieutenant and eight companions,
after defending the powder magazine against hundreds of
assailants, perished by blowing it up, so as to prevent it from
falling into the enemy’s hands. The Mogul was then set up
as the ruler of India. The trouble soon spread along the Ganges
Valley; the British forces in Cawnpore and Lucknow were
shortly afterward besieged.
In Cawnpore, about two hundred and fifty fighting men
defended more than double their number of women, children,
and invalids. For eighteen days, behind their mud walls, they
repelled the attacks of thousands of native troops under the
•direction of a native prince named Nana Sahib. Then, when
their position was hopeless, they accepted Nana’s offer of a safe
conduct down the river. No sooner had they embarked than
fire was opened upon them from both banks. Only four of the
men succeeded in escaping ; the remaining women and children,
numbering more than two hundred, were imprisoned. A fortnight
later they were butchered and their bodies thrown into a well.
Meanwhile, the besieged in Lucknow, defended by about one
thousand whites and seven hundred loyal sepoys, held out against
hordes of assailants, numbering at times more than fifty thousand,
and supported by cannon directed by trained sepoy gunners.
For eighty-seven days the defenders repelled all attacks. The
commander of the garrison at Lucknow, Henry Lawrence, had
been killed during the second day of the siege. With his brother,
John, he, at an earlier date, governed the Indian province called
the Punjab. Their rule had been so just that the inhabitants,
called the Sikhs, who formerly had been the most dangerous
■enemies of the British, soon became their earnest supporters.
Sir John Lawrence still governed the Punjab. With the aid of
his Sikh soldiers, he soon disarmed the sepoys in his district, and
sent all the troops he could spare to Delhi. Months, however,
passed before the city was taken.
Meanwhile, help was marching to Lucknow. Sir Henry Have-
lock, with a force of only 1,500 men had attempted to save
Cawnpore. Like Cromwell, he was a man who prayed and taught
his men to pray also. Although he marched 126 miles in nine
days against opposition, he arrived too late. He succeeded in
defeating Nana Sahib and then set out for Lucknow. His force
alone was too small, but, happily, he was joined by another under
’Sir James Outram. Outram was Havelock’s superior officer,
but so proud was he of the effort that Havelock had made that he


now generously gave the command to him in order that he might
have the credit of relieving Lucknow. This force reached and
entered the city, after which it was itself besieged. Some months,
later fresh troops arrived. Then the garrison, as well as the
women and children, was removed. Unfortunately, this had hardly
been done before Havelock, who was now sixty-two years of age,
was struck down by sickness and died. Before this, Delhi had been,
recaptured, but the fighting in India did not come to an end
until the year 1859.
Now, in conclusion, let us look at some of the happier aspects
of this unfortunate outbreak. The rising, as its name shows,
was a mutiny rather than a rebellion. The people of India, as
a whole, did not rise against the rule of the British. Only in
a few of the northern provinces was the populace seriously
affected. The trouble was confined mainly to the army, but
even the whole of the army did not revolt. The troops at Madras
and Bombay remained loyal. With the aid of the Sikh soldiers
Delhi w r as captured and sepoys played an important part in the
defence of Lucknow. Some of the rebellious regiments even
protected their officers and helped them to escape. The majority
of the native princes took no part in the rising, while some of
them gave valuable assistance to the British.
One of the younger officers who served with distinction during
the suppression of the Mutiny was Frederick Roberts, afterwards
known as Lord Roberts. He was born in Cawnpore, and spent
many years of his life in India. In the capture of Delhi, he took
an active' part, and he was also present at the second relief of
Lucknow. Shortly afterwards, he distinguished himself by
attacking a body of mutineers and capturing a standard which
two of them were attempting to remove. One he cut down,
but the other, placing his gun close to Roberts’s body, pulled the
trigger. Fortunately, the weapon did not fire. For his bravery
on this occasion he was awarded the Victoria Cross. Twenty
years later, a dispute arose with the Afghans who, it was believed,
were plotting with the Russians. War was declared on
Afghanistan. In this campaign Roberts made himself famous
by his march to Kandahar, which was being besieged by the
natives. In twenty-two days his troops covered a distance of
three hundred and thirteen miles and then gained a victory over
the Afghans. A few years later he became Commander-in-Chief


of all the forces in India. The last campaign in which he shared
was the Boer War,* fought in South Africa. This commenced
in the year 1899. At first, the Boers, who lived in the Transvaal
and the Orange Free State, gained many successes. British
forces were besieged in Kimberley and Ladysmith, and Cape
Colony was invaded. But after the arrival of British reinforce-
ments, including volunteers from Canada, Australia, and New
Zealand, and after Lord Roberts had been put in charge, every-
thing was altered. The sieges were raised, the famous Boer
general Cronje and his force of five thousand were compelled
to surrender and the capitals of both of the revolting States
were captured. In the year 1900 Roberts returned to England,
where he received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament
and was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British army.
His successes in this war made his name known throughout the
Empire. He lived to see the commencement of the Great War,
but died in November of the year 1914.

* The Boer war originated in a dispute concerning the rights of Britishers
an the Transvaal. These Uitlanders, as they were called by the Boers,
outnumbered the Boers themselves and paid the greater part of the money
raised in the form of taxes. The Boer Government, under its President
/Paul Kruger), however, practically excluded them “ from having a vote
or any share in the political control of the country.”


Part 2. —Africa.
One of the many objects of interest which attract the traveller
who visits Cape Town is the famous monument erected in honour
of Cecil John Rhodes. It stands high on the side of a mountain
which overlooks the city. To reach it one must climb. Then,
standing at this height, the traveller views for miles the country
which was so profoundly influenced by him in memory of whom
the monument was erected.
Africa, showing British territory and places referred to in the text.
Shaded portions indicate British territory.


Cecil Rhodes was born in England. Like Nelson, he was the
son of a clergyman. It was his father’s desire that he should
enter the church, but ill-health compelled him, at the age of
sixteen, to leave England and visit his brother’s farm in Natal.
There his health was soon restored. Just at this time diamonds
were discovered in South Africa, and Rhodes, with his brother,
was among the successful diggers. He soon acquired wealth,
and later in life became the controller of many mines. When
only nineteen years of age he spent eight months in penetrating
far into the lands which lay to the north of Cape Colony. The
country through which he passed was barely occupied in spite
of its great wealth. He soon decided that this was a land which
ought to belong to the British Empire. But first he returned
to Oxford in the hope of continuing his education. Again his
health failed, and again he returned to South Africa ; but he
persisted, visiting Oxford from time to time, until later in life
he secured a degree. Meanwhile, his interest in the northern
regions which he had visited earlier in life was renewed by the fact
that the Boers were encroaching on them. Rhodes knew the value
of these regions, and urged the British Government to intervene.
At last a force was sent, and the Boers were compelled to with-
draw. Then rumours spread that the Dutch, the Germans, and
the Portuguese were attempting to secure concessions from the
great chief who claimed to rule over these territories. Rhodes
now formed the idea of establishing a company which should
occupy this part of Africa. Messengers were sent to the great
chief, the matter was discussed, and at last satisfactorily settled.
The British Government gave its consent, and in this way
Rhodesia was added to the British dominions. In the year
1900, Rhodes became Prime Minister of the Cape, but he resigned
shortly afterwards under rather unfortunate circumstances.
Some of the British in the Boer States had attempted to raise
a rebellion because of the harsh treatment that they were re-
ceiving. Rhodes took no part in the rising, but he had aided
in its preparation.
A little later, war broke out with the natives in Rhodesia.
There seemed no hope of ending the conflict, as the enemy held
an impregnable position in the hills. Moving bis tent to the
foot of these hills. Rhodes remained there for six weeks without
any protection. The natives were impressed ; they invited him
to attend a council held within their stronghold. He went
unarmed, and peace was arranged. In these same distant Matoppo
Hills, at his own request, he was buried on his death in the
year 1902.


Under the terms of his will, the greater part of his fortune is
now being put to good use. Year by year, from South Africa,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other of the British
possessions, as well as from the United States of America, the
Rhodes scholars, as they are called, go to Oxford to continue
their studies. There they are provided for by money which
Rhodes himself left for this special purpose.
Among the friends of Cecil Rhodes was another famous man
named Charles George Gordon, better known as General Gordon.
His ‘early training in England fitted him for a position in the
army. He saw active service against the Russians during the
Crimean War, which commenced in the year 1854. A little later,
he was sent to China. There, in charge of a small force called
the “ Ever Victorious Army,” he distinguished himself by his
justice as well as by capturing town after town. In return, the
Chinese Emperor* bestowed upon him his highest decoration,
namely, the Yellow Jacket. He also offered him a large sum of
money, but this was not accepted. Then, for some years, Gordon
remained in England. The poverty of many of the unfortunate
people in this country grieved him. He generously helped those
about him, and no one will ever know all his acts of kindness
to his poorer neighbours. Meanwhile, the Soudan, a country
lying to the south of Egypt, was in an unsatisfactory condition.
The Khedive, or ruler of Egypt, now determined to send an
expedition into the Soudan to check the slave-trading which
was only too common, and to open the country for commerce.
Gordon was asked to undertake the task, and soon set out. The
slave-trading was not abolished, as he failed to receive all the
assistance that he deserved from the Egyptian Government,
but measures were taken to check it. Then a rebellion broke
out. His own force was much smaller than that of the enemy.
There seemed to be little hope of putting down the rising, when,
suddenly, Gordon with only an interpreter, entered the rebels’
camp. This brave act so impressed the enemy that many of
them now deserted to his side. The remainder were then
* After peace had been made with China, in the year 1860, a British
army was left in the country to enforce the terms that had been decided
upon. Within China a rebellion had been in progress for some years. It
was in opposing these rebels that Gordon earned the gratitude of the Chinese
Emperor.


compelled to retreat. Shortly afterwards, he resigned his position
in the Soudan. After this he took service in many different parts
of the world, including China and Cape Colony.
Then, in the year 1881, trouble arose in the Egyptian dominions.
In Egypt itself a revolt occurred in which many Europeans were
killed. Great Britain then interfered ; the Khedive was restored,
while British advisers as well as a British army were left in the
country. In the Soudan, another insurrection broke out under
the leadership of one who called himself the “ Mahdi,” or successor
of Mohammed. A British force, sent to restore order, was
utterly destroyed. At last, the Egyptian Government decided
to abandon the Soudan and Gordon was sent to undertake the
work. He reached Khartum and succeeded in sending many
women and children into Egypt. Then the Mahdi’s forces
closed around the city. Although he had only one British
officer, and although he was of a different nationality from the
troops under his command, he now defended the city for months
against the Mahdi and his army. The siege commenced on
March 18th, 1884. Not until August did the British Govern-
ment decide to send assistance. Meanwhile, the besieged looked
for aid which never came. At last, on January 26th, the city
was captured, and Gordon slain. The British force arrived
two days later.
After the death of General Gordon, the Soudan was abandoned
for some years. But, under the guidance of the British advisers,
the Egyptian army became more efficient. At last, in the year
1896, with the aid of a British force, it set out once again to
capture the Soudan, which was suffering under the cruel rule of
the Mahdi’s successor. The expedition was placed under the
command of General (afterwards Lord) Kitchener, who, like
Wellington, had been born in Ireland. No risks were taken ;
the advance down the River Nile was made slowly and carefully.
At last, in the year 1898, after certain minor engagements, the
main force of the enemy was met at Omdurman. A complete
victory was secured, and Khartum fell shortly afterwards. The
victor’s name has since been associated with the capture of this
city: “ Kitchener of Khartum ” has become quite a common
expression. A little later, he was sent to South Africa to assist
Lord Roberts in his struggle with the Boers. After the departure
of Roberts, he became Commander-in-Chief of the forces in South
Africa and remained there until the conclusion of the war. Then,


for some years, he occupied the position of Commander-in-Chief
in India. After his departure from India Kitchener spent
several months visiting various parts of the British Empire.
He inspected their troops and gave the colonial authorities
advice in respect to military preparations. Among the places
that he visited was our own fair city of Adelaide. In the year
1911, he was sent to Egypt as chief British adviser to the Khedive.
Three years later, when the Great War began, he was entrusted
with the charge of the British operations, and under his super-
vision in less than a fortnight more than one hundred and fifty
thousand men were landed in France. He visited some of
the battlefields; the Australians saw him on Gallipoli. In
June of the year 1916, he set out on an important mission for
Russia. The cruiser Hampshire, in which he sailed, was destroyed
only a little while after the journey had begun. Some of the
ship’s company were saved, but Kitchener’s body has never
been recovered.

XV.—THE EMPIRE AND THE GREAT WAR.
The British Empire of to-day includes nearly one quarter of
the total land area of the globe. Within it are innumerable
islands studded here and there in the different oceans, as well as
larger areas such as Canada and Australia. It experiences every
form of climate, while its various parts produce all that is necessary
for human existence. The millions that live beneath its flag
are of different races, which differ also in their languages, religions
and customs. No common form of government exists within
its limits. The great dominions, comprising Canada, Australia,
South Africa, and New Zealand, enjoy responsible government. In
the Crown colonies, such as Ceylon, Hong Kong, and many others,
the influence of the British government is more or less directly
felt. Other parts of the Empire, e.g., North Borneo, are con-
trolled by British companies, while in the Protectorates, of which
British East Africa is an example, the native rule is interfered
with but slightly. At the first glance, it seems to be an empire
of differences with few ties to hold the various parts together.
A clever Frenchman named Turgot once stated that colonies
were like fruit, as soon as they became ripe they fell off. The
loss of the American colonies in the eighteenth century seemed
to prove this statement to be correct. In fact, there were many
people at one time who looked upon the colonies as mill-
stones tied about the neck of the Mother Country. It was
commonly believed that as time went by the remaining colonies
would follow the example of the United States. Fortunately,
there were others who did not hold this belief. They recognised
that the American revolt had been due partly to the mistakes
of British statesmen. By avoiding the errors of the past the
Empire exists as it is to-day.
What causes foreigners to wonder is the way in which the
self-governing dominions control their own affairs. This is not
the case in other empires, for in them the central powers keep
a much firmer hold on the Governments of the various parts.
But the British self-governing dominions are in many ways
independent. The laws passed in Great Britain have no effect in
Australia, for here we have responsible government. We can-
not declare war on another country, nor can we make peac*


if the Empire is at war, but, otherwise, we can do almost as we
wish. This is true also of the peoples in the other self-governing
dominions.
Before the outbreak of the Great War it seemed to many people
that this practical independence would soon lead to a breaking
up of the Empire. To avoid this, it was hoped that some common
form of government would be established which would control
all the different parts. Imperial conferences were held, attended
by representatives from all the great dominions, but, although
the members succeeded in agreeing on many important matters,
they never decided upon a common form of government. Thus,
when the war commenced, no system existed by which all the
parts of the Empire could be compelled to unite against the
enemy. Prior to this, there were people who believed that if Great
Britain went to war some or all the dominions would refrain from
assisting her. But this was not the case. Great Britain declared
war and the colonies came to her aid without compulsion. From
Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, India, and other
parts of the Empire, volunteers offered services, which were not
demanded. Thus, the Empire proved itself to' be united in spite
of the apparent weakness of the ties which held it together.
What causes produced this happy result ? The unjust German
invasion of Belgium naturally aroused the indignation of all to
whom the name of honour was dear. The thought of liberty
occupied men’s minds. Under British rule, the freedom of the
colonies had been encouraged and protected. Was it not right
that in this time of danger the colonies should show their grati-
tude for the kindnesses which they had received in the past 1
Tradition was not without effect in other ways also. The
victories of Drake, Wolfe, and Wellington, as well as of other
heroes, provided a common bond. The call of language and of
blood helped to unite still more firmly all those of British descent.
Loyalty to the King proved a compelling factor to all within
the Empire, whatever their nationality or their customs. In the
Sovereign they had one common head to whom they all could
rally. Lastly, the justice which Great Britain had meted out in the
past had not been in vain For although the book of British
History may here and there be stained by the record of acts
which men would willingly forget, it, nevertheless, contains whole
chapters which show that, under the British flag, the fallen
peoples of the world have been raised and the oppressed set free.
The horrors of the slave trade were removed primarily by the
intervention of Great Britain. The people of the Soudan,, once so


cruelly governed by the Mahdi, recognised the value of British
protection. At the outbreak of the war one of their chiefs
wrote to the British officer at Khartum the following words :
“ Under your flag, which protects many millions of other Moham-
medans, we are enjoying full liberty in the exercise of our teligious
duties as well as our daily work.” More striking is the statement
of the chief of the Somali, who live in Eastern Africa. His
words were : “ Day is as night and night is as day until we hear
that the English are victorious. God knows the right. He will
help the right.” While ties like these remain the unity of the
Empire is assured.

XVI.—THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.
The League of Nations is not the first league that nations
have formed. Long before the Romans came to Britain the
practice of forming leagues had been established, and many
have been formed since that time. But those leagues differed
from the present one in many ways. They included only a
few nations, and their purpose usually was to conquer weaker
nations or to protect themselves against those who were strong.
The present League contains more than three-fourths of the
population of the world, and it aims at preventing war as. much
as possible. These are not the only differences, for the League
of Nations deals with many things that were of no interest to
those of earlier times. To understand what the League is we
must study its aims and its work. Its aims are set down in the
Covenant of the League of Nations.
This Covenant was prepared in Paris in the year 1919 by a
committee of the delegates of those Powers who had assembled
there to discuss terras of peace with Germany and her allies. It
was then included in the four peace treaties —with Germany,
with Austria, with Hungary, and with Bulgaria—the first of
which was signed on January 10, 1920. The signing of that
treaty brought the League into existence. The Covenant is a
very important document. If it were printed in this book it
would fill more than ten of its pages. It deals with many things.
To separate these one from the other the whole is divided into
parts, each of which is called an Article. There are twenty-six
of these Articles. They tell us how nations can become members
of the League, how the League is to do its work, where it is to
hold its meetings, and many other things which wall be set down
a little later w r hen we are considering the aims of the League.
The League is the group of nations that have promised to band
themselves together and to carry out the aims of that Covenant.
.The League now contains fifty-six members. Many of these
were our allies in the Great War, but others, such as Germany,
Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria w'ere our enemies at that time.
Not all of the nations who supported us in that struggle are


members, for the United States of America and Russia have not
yet joined. Among the fifty-six nations are the great dominions
of the British Empire —Canada, Australia, South Africa, and
New Zealand —as well as India, each of which is a separate
member. None of these have been forced to enter the League.
Any self-governing nation that has not yet joined will readily
be admitted by the present members provided it is willing to do
what the Covenant requires. No one is forced to remain within
the League. Any member that has carried out its promises
may “ after two years’ notice of its intention so to do ” withdraw
from the League.*
A nation that refused to carry out its promises would, of
■course, cease to be a member of the League.
How do these nations work together ? Every year each has
the right to send representatives to Geneva, where the meetings
of Lhe League are held. These representatives form the Assembly
of the League. In this Assembly all kinds of matters are dis-
cussed —how much each nation is to pay to the League, what
new member is to be admitted, how slavery is to be abolished,
what measures will be taken to bring relief to those who suffer,
and many others. In many ways it resembles our own House
of Assembly which, as you have learned in your Civics lessons,
discusses the laws of the country. But our House of Assembly
does not govern the country. The task of controlling the schools,
the railways, the police, the lands, the mines, and all the other
things that the Government controls, is entrusted to a few
Ministers, who are the most influential men in Parliament at
the time, and who together make up the Cabinet or Ministry.
Within the League a system something like this exists, for it is
a smaller body, the Council, which directs the working of the
League, f
The Council contains only fourteen members. Five of these —
the British Empire, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan —are
the most influential members of the League, and have permanent
seats in the Council, The remainder are elected from among
* It is an unfortunate fact that Brazil and Spain have given notice that
they will withdraw from the League in 1928. Their proposed retirement is
not due to opposition to the aims of the League, but to the refusal of the
other members to grant them permanent seats in the Council.
f In the Assembly all nations are equal, for each is entitled to on® vote
-only when matters are being decided.


the other members by the Assembly, and hold their seats for a
stated number of years only.*
The Covenant states that the Council must meet at least once
a year. To do its work, however, it has had to meet more often.
Its task, we have said, is to direct the working of the League.
One of the important ways in which it does this is to discuss
and prepare matter which is afterwards laid before the Assembly
for its consideration. The Covenant gives to both the Council
and the Assembly the right to “ deal with any matter within
the sphere of action of the League or affecting the peace of the
world.” As their powers in this direction are equal, some disputes
may arise in the future. So far there has been little disagreement
the Council has undertaken the tasks which the Assembly has
suggested, and the Assembly has supported the action of the
Council.
Another important part of the League machinery is the Per-
manent Secretariat. This is a large staff of officials who do their
Work in Geneva. They send out the letters that summon the
members to their meetings, keep a record of all that is done*
despatch information to all parts of the world, and do many
other things as well. At the head of this Secretariat is an English-
man, Sir Eric Drummond. His assistants are men and women
from many different parts of the world.
Then there is the Permanent Court of International Justice.
The fifteen Judges who form this court were elected by the
Assembly in 1921. They come from various countries, including
the United States of America, and are elected for a term of nine
years. They meet at the Hague, in Holland, and have important
work to do, for the League is often faced by legal problems
which- they can consider, and nations just as individuals, some-
times—dispute. Before the Great War no permanent court
existed to which they could take their dispute for settlement,
but now this court gives them a chance of doing this and also
of avoiding war.
The Nations who make up the League are also members of
another great body called the International Labour Organization.
* Germany became a member of the League and of the Council in
September, 1926. Before that there were only four permanent seats.
The number of the elected members has since the beginning of the League
been increased from four to nine. Three of these in turn must present
themselves for re-election each year.


In many ways this resembles the League of Nations. It began
at the same time as the League.*
It has a great office called the International Labour Office, in
Geneva, and it holds annual conferences in the same city, but
there are differences. This great organization is allowed to admit
nations that are not members of the League, thus Germany
has been in it practically from its beginning, and the problems
that it discusses are those related to labour, such as hours of
work per day, wages, child labour, safety in factories, and many
others. But both are trying to reduce the number of disputes
that may arise, so both are working for the peace of the world.
What are the aims of those who belong to the League ? One
we have referred to more than once already. It is to preserve
peace as long as possible. This will not always be an easy task,
for disputes will arise in spite of the League. What the League
hopes to do is to prevent these disputing nations from rushing
hastily into war and thus perhaps beginning a much greater
war. Only a very few nations began the Great War in which
more than thirty afterwards played a part. To prevent this
hasty action the members promise that when they engage in a
dispute which may lead to war they will lay the cause of their
dispute before the Permanent Court, the Council, Assembly,
or some other body for its consideration, and not go to war
until three months after a decision has been given. J 1 they
accept that decision war will be avoided. If only one of them
accepts that decision it is promised the support of all the other
members. If one or more of the nations which are outside the
League threaten the peace of the world, it, or they, will be asked
to act as members of the League. Those that do will receive
the protection of the League. Against those that do not, the
Council has the right to “ take such measures and make such
recommendations as will prevent hostilities, and will result in
the settlement of the dispute.” In other ways also the League
hopes to preserve peace. Thus it aims at reducing “ national
armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety”
and requires its members to give a solemn promise that they will
not secretly increase the strength of their forces of war. By
Article 18 members are forbidden to make secret treaties. Many
of the troubles of the past have been caused by treaties of this
* There had been a conference before 1920, but legally .the International
Labour Organisation began with the signing of the first Peace Treaty,
some of whose clauses provided for its establishment.


kind. Nations were never sure that others had not made treaties
against them To prevent this evil practice, the members promise
that they will allow the Secretariat to keep and publish a copy
of every treaty they make.
But the League is interested in other matters also. It is very
much concerned in the welfare of millions of people who live in
areas that formerly belonged to Germany and her allies. The
majority of these are natives who dwell in islands to the north of
Australia and in different parts of Africa. The care of these
has been entrusted to certain members of the League. These
members are known as Mandatories, and the area that is entrusted
to each is called a Mandate. It is their duty to protect the
natives from injury and to help them to learn to govern themselves.
Every year the Mandatory must send to the Council a report of
what it has done. Australia is one of these. Her Mandate is
the area formerly known as German New Guinea and the islands
that lie off its coast.*
The League also recognises that there are millions of other
people whose lives ought to be happier than they are. Thus it
calls upon members to promise to endeavour to secure “ fair and
humane conditions of labour for men, women, and children,’
both in their own countries and in those with which they trade,
to check the traffic in opium and other dangerous drugs, to check
the manufacture of firearms by private individuals, to control
and prevent disease, and carry out many other duties. The
League certainly has many good aims, but has it done any good
since it was established ? Here is an answer to this question :
A number of international disputes have already been settled.
In 1920 Sweden and Finland claimed to control the Aaland
Islands, which are in the Baltic Sea. In 1921 Serbian
troops invaded Albania and burned villages. Two years later
the Italians bombarded and seized the Greek island of Corfu, and
in 1925 Greek troops invaded Bulgaria. Had there been no League
any of these disputes might have led to war, but they did
not. In each case the dispute was settled. The problem of
* Former German areas that are now Mandates are the Pelew, Caroline
Ladrone, and Marshall Islands (Japan) ; Western Samoa (New Zealand);
N.E. New Guinea and islands (Australia); S.W. Africa (Union of S. Africa);
Nauru, E. Africa, part of Togoland and the Cameroons (Great Britain):
part of Togoland and the Cameroons (France). Former Turkish areas
which are now Mandates are Syria (France); Palestine and Mesopotamia
(Great Britain). The Mandatories are printed in brackets.


reducing armaments has been entrusted to a body of men, called
a Commission. So far they have not solved that problem,
which is a very difficult one, but they are trying to do so. The
Permanent Court has played its part in solving other problems
of a legal character. The League by its assistance has enabled
hundreds of thousands of prisoners of war, left in different parts
of Europe, to return to their homes. When tens of thousands
of Greeks, who had been expelled from Asia Minor by the Turks,
w r ere faced by death from disease or starvation, the League
came to their assistance and later drew up a scheme for settling
them in the land of their own countrymen. It played an active
part in stamping out typhus in Poland in 1920.* It is
opposing the trade in opium, and is trying to suppress slavery,
which still exists in several countries. The work of the Inter-
national Labour Organization has had good results also. In
India hours of work have been reduced to sixty a week, the age
at which children can begin work in the mines raised from nine
to twelve years, and one whole day’s rest a week established.
Japan has promised that after three years have passed women
and children are not to be employed at night time, and China
has appointed factory inspectors.
All these reforms have not been gained without spending
money. Officials must be paid for the work they do, and money
must be spent in many other ways. The League alone costs
about £1,000,000 per annum. This may seem to be a big sum
of money, but if by spending it we can have peace, we are getting
it cheaply, for the last Great War cost the world thousands of
millions of pounds as well as several millions of lives. This
£1,000,000 is not paid by one nation ; the cost is shared by all
in such a way that those w r ho are wealthy pay more than those
w r ho have less wealth.f
One fact must always be remembered. The League will
continue to work as long as the members carry out their promises
and remain within it. It has no army or navy to enforce its
wishes. These are owned and controlled by the members who
make up the League. If force is required, and we hope it never
will be, it can only ask them to provide the necessary arms.
* The United States of America, although not a member of the League,
have helped in relief work of this kind.
f According to an agreement of 1925 Australia pays 27 units, Great
Britain 105, France 79, New Zealand 10, Albania, 1, &c. A unit equals
about £1,000. The entry of Germany will slightly alter these figures.


It passes no laws that must be obeyed by Australians or by the
people of any other member-nation. It can only suggest to-
the Governments of those nations measures that it thinks ought
to be passed. But such measures will have been discussed by
those w r ho are in the League, and they will be attempts to
maintain peace. In the same way the International Labour
Organization can lay before the various Governments suggestions
concerning conditions of labour, and ask them to accept them.
It cannot force them to carry out its wishes. If the Governments
ignore these suggestions, and if they fail to do what they have
promised to do, the League will, certainly fail and the world be
left with little protection against future war. But if they work
together to overcome the difficulties that lie in their way, and
strive to make the aims of the League realities, we can confidently
look forward to a time wffiich w T ill be safer and happier than that
in which we now live.
