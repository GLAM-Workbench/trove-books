949 Life and Literary Remains of Charles Reece Pemberton. With
remarks on his character and genius by W. J. Fox, 1843.
With note on blank sheet by Sir Henry Parkes. Pemberton,
who was the child of a middle-class family, ran away from
home and entered himself on a man-of-war in the early days
of the century. While the ship was on the American Coast he
again ran away, and for many years lived with the North
American Indians. During that timehe acquired the elocution
and the oratory of the wild men amongst whom he lived. He
returned to England in the thirties, and discarded the English
style of dress, wearing a loose green blouse with belt around
his waist and a wild looking cap. In this costume he appeared
before large English audiences, and represented some of
Shakespere’s characters, and recited the poems of Mrs. Hemans
and Alfred Tennyson, who were then beginning to be known,
with so remarkable ability as to attract large audiences. This
book of his Remains has long been out of print, and is
very difficult to obtain.

-12 American engraving—President Lincoln announcing to his Cabinet
his intention to issue a Proclamation liberating the Slaves.
“ Public sentiment, he thought, would sustain it; ” “ And,”
said Mr. Lincoln, in a low and reverent tone, “ I have promised
my God that I will do it.” These last words were hardly
heard by anyone but Mr. Chase, who sat nearest to him. Mr.
Chase inquired : “ Did I understand you correctly, Mr. Presi-
dent ?” Mr. Lincoln replied: “I made a solemn vow
before God that, if General Lee should be driven back from
Pennsylvania, I would crown the result by the declaration of
freedom to the Slaves ”

17 The Gathering of the Unions on Newhall Hill, Birmingham, on
7th May, 1832. The numbers at the meeting were variously
estimated from one hundred and fifty thousand to two hundred
and fifty thousand. It is estimated that not less than one
hundred thousand voices joined in singing the “Union Hymn”
God is our Guide ! From field, from wave,
From plough, from anvil and from loom
We come our country’s rights to save,
And speak a tyrant-faction’s doom.
And hark ! We raise from sea to sea
The sacred watchword —Liberty !
Miss Martineau, in her Thirty Years’ Peace, says: “It never
was so sung before, nor after : for now, a hundred thousand
voices pealed it forth in music which has never died away in
the hearts of those who heard it.” Afterwards the multitude
plighted their faith in the following words, repeating them
as given out by one of the leaders : —“ With unbroken faith,
through every peril and privation, we here devote ourselves
and our children to our country’s cause.” This was the first
great public meeting attended by Henry Parkes ; he pro-
cured this representation of it soon afterwards, and brought
it with him to Australia. A copy could hardly be obtained
for money now
