PREFACE.
For the Third Tear the Royal Kalendar and Guide
to Tasmania is placed by me before the Public.
Conscious that I have prepared, with much trouble, a
useful Book of reference for all Classes, and one which has
taken the trail of the path made by my friend the late Mr.
Wood, I am yet uncheered by the reflection that the task has
been in any way remunerative. The small nugget of public
spirit, however, which has not yet been crushed out of my
quartz by the heavy roller of time during a not inactive or
useless Public Service of more than a quarter of a century,
induces me once more to cast my little Book upon the waters,
in the belief that the return will be the same as for former
years, —in the hope that it may prove remunerative.
Improved in many points,—petty errors of former years
corrected, —perfectness of detail secured, —the Kalendar
largely added to and improved by many pages on
Astronomical subjects, with a view to supply a want long
felt in Tasmania, and for which I have to thank Mr. Prancis
Abbott, of the Private Observatory, Murray-street; —I hope
that the Royal Kalendar and Guide to Tasmania for
1860 will prove a safe Book of reference.
For the official portion I am indebted to the courtesy of
the Honorable Francis Smith, the Premier, and the
Honorable William Henty, the Colonial Secretary, at
whose open-sesame order the various public offices have
yielded to me every requisite information.

PRINCIPAL OCCURRENCES
IN REFERENCE TO
THE EPHEMERIS
FOR THE
YEAR 1860.
The spherical figure of the Earth, its diurnal revolution, and its obliquity to the plane
of the equator, together with its motion in an elliptic orbit, exposes every part of its
surface between 23J° north and south latitudes to the perpendicular influence of
the sun’s rays, to which is ascribed the unequal distribution of heat and light, with
the endless vicissitudes of seasons in different latitudes.
The Year is usually divided into four seasons of nearly equal duration— Spring,
Summer, Autumn, and Winter; but the climate of Tasmania is an exception to this
rule: we have four Spring months— July, August, September, and October ; and the
Island is without any months answering to the English Winter— December, January,
and February.
Our Spring quarter commences astronomically, in the southern hemisphere, on
the day on which the sun enters Libra, about the 24th of September : this period is
our Vernal Equinox.
The Summer begins on the day on which the sun enters Capricornus, about the
22nd of December : and this is our Summer Solstice.
Autumn quarter commences on the day on which the sun enters the first degree of
Aries, about the 21st of March; or more strictly, on the day when the distance of the
sun’s meridian altitude from the zenith, being on the increase, is at a mean between the
greatest and the least: this is our Autumnal Equinox.
Winter begins on the day on which the sun enters the first degree of Cancer, about
the 22nd of June ; or more strictly, on the day on which it has attained its greatest
northern declination or distance from the equator : and this is the Winter Solstice.

The divisions of the year adopted by the ancients differed very materially from
the Gregorian Kalendar, or that of the present day; the four seasons were of
unequal duration, but were all astronomically distinguished.
The year 5621 of the Jewish Era commences on September the 17th, 1860.
Ramadan (Month of Abstinence by the Turks) commences on March 24th, 1860.
The year 1277 of the Mohammedan Era commences on the 20th of July, 1860.'
The Jewish year 5620-21 C.M. 1860.
The Jewish year is luni-solar, and their calculations are founded on the lunar
cycle : every nineteenth year coming to the same date in the solar year.
The cycle contains 235 lunations, which they divide into 12 years of twelve months
each, —and 7 years, termed Embolismic , of 13 months.
The year is of three kinds -.—perfect, having 355 days, in which the months of
Chesvan and Kislev have each 30 days ; Common , of 354 days, when Chesvan has
29, and Kislev 30 days; and Imperfect, of 353 days, when both these months have
each 29 days.
Names of the Months.
Tishri
Chesvan
Kislev
Tebet

The Embolismic year is formed by the introduction of an intercalary month
immediately after Adar, which is called Ve-Adar, or the second Adar ; the first has
then 30, and the latter (intercalary) month only 29 days.
The Jewish Festivals, &c., are regulated by the first ecclesiastical month Nisan,
but the civil year commences in Tishri.

The Moon s Eibration is here supposed to
take place in the plane of her Orbitand
by the time of the greatest Libration of her
Apparent Disc is to be understood the instant
at which, to an observer at the centre of the
Earth, the variation of the Disc from its
mean state has attained its maximum.
The right-hand column indicates the
quadrant of the Moon’s Disc in which the
Libration takes place, and in which the
greatest change of the Moon’s surface will
become visible.

The mean daily motion of Saturn among the stars is only about 2', the 30th part
of a degree. At a mean rate, therefore, he is about 21 years in passing over one sign
of the Zodiac.
The rings are most open when the planet is in 19° of Gemini, or of Sagittarius;
and least so when in 19° of Pisces or Virgo.
The northern surface is turned towards the Earth during Saturn’s progress from
Virgo to Pisces, and the southern surface while he moves from Pisces to Virgo,
the period of revolution being nearly 30 years : we therefore see each side of the rings
alternately for about 15 years, or a little less.
EXPLANATION OF THE OCCURRENCES CONTAINED IN THE
EPHEMERIS.

For Latitude, 42° 52' 13" S.; Longitude, E.
147° 22' 24"
The contents of the Astronomical Ephemeris for the year 1860, as now written for
the Royal Kalendar, is altogether new in forming any part of a Tasmanian Almanac,
and has been compiled at the wish of a few Ladies, who have long had a desire to
possess some guide to the study of the Heavens reduced to the longitude, &c., of
the Colony.
The writer has therefore endeavoured to make the Ephemeris as elementary
as possible ; and where the columns are headed Greenwich mean time (for nautical
purposes), as in the case of longitude and latitude of the moon, &c., a rule is
given in the explanation that will enable any person to deduce for themselves the
rising and setting from the columns containing the meridian passage.
To find the mean time of transit under any other meridian, 'suppose 45° or 3 h.
west of Greenwich, on January 15th, 1860. The meridian being west of Greenwich,
the transit will take place after the Greenwich time of transit on the 15th ; therefore,
take the difference between the meridian passage on the 15th and 16th, which is


Oh. 51.7m. Then 24h. : Oh. 51.7m. :: 3 h. : 6.5m., which, added to the Greenwich
mean time of transit, gives 18ft. 41.0m. for the mean time of transit at 45° west of
Greenwich.
Had the assumed meridian been 3ft. to the east of Greenwich, then the
proportional part of the difference between the 14th and 15th must in this case have
been subtracted. The column containing the moon’s meridian passage, being used
in conjunction with a Table of semidiurnal Arcs, as given in Norie's Epitome, the
times of rising and setting of the Moon is obtained approximately : it is also useful
in finding the time of high water.

The columns on the first page of the Ephemeris, containing the rising, southing,
and setting of the planets, are only to be considered approximate : the meridian
passage being given for Greenwich mean time, the difference in longitude will in some
cases make a few seconds and in others a few minutes difference for the planet’s
motion during the 9h. 49m. 30s. of east longitude; hut when extreme accuracy is
required, the same rule may be applied as in the case of the moon by interpolation.
Take the difference of the times of the two consecutive transits, and consider this
difference as an acceleration or retardation of the meridian passage, while the planet
has passed over 24 h. of geographical longitude; take the proportional part of it,
due to the difference of meridians, bearing in mind that in east longitude the passage
precedes that of Greenwich, when times are accelerated, and follows it when
they are retarded ; and the contrary in west longitude.

It will be seen by these examples that the difference of time in the meridian
passage of the planets between Greenwich and Hobart Town is of small
amount.
The rising and setting of the planets for the Ephemeris have been reduced for 43°
east, the longitude of Hobart Town nearly, by semidiurnal and seminocturnal arches.
Ihe times thus deduced are only approximate; but they are sufficiently accurate for
the purpose required.
At the top of the left-hand page in each month are given Hobart Town times
at which several of the principal astronomical phenomena occur; such have only been
selected that take place during the sun’s absence. In conjunction with the
phenomena is a list of such constellations as pass the meridian at 9 o’clock in the
evening at their respective dates for each month : the same page also contains a column
showing the day of the year, which is useful in many calculations requiring the
number of days between different days in the year.


The columns on the right-hand page containing the sun’s right ascension and
declination are useful for determining time, or the latitude of the place. The next
column contains the mean time of the sun’s passage over the meridian, showing the
equation added or subtracted for each day to the decimal of a second.
The times of the rising and setting of the sun, lengths of day, duration of
twilight, Sfc., are given for Hobart Town only.
There are four different kinds of time used by Astronomers -.—sidereal time,
apparent time, mean solar time, and equinoctial time. The interval between the transit
of the first point of Aries across the meridian one day and its return to it the next
day is called a siderial day, which is divided into 24 equal parts or hours, and the hours
into minutes, &c. A siderial day contains 23 h. 56 m. 4 s. .0921 dec. This time, shown
by a clock, agrees with the transit of the stars across the meridian. The interval
between the transit of the sun across the meridian one day and his transit the next
day is called an apparent solar day, which is divided into hours, minutes, &c., of
apparent time. The solar day, hours, and minutes, are of different lengths, owing to
the unequal motion of the sun at different times of the year; astronomers therefore
have devised an imaginary time, called mean time, from an imaginary sun, which is
supposed to move uniformly in the equator. The interval of its crossing the
meridian on any two successive days is a mean solar day, whose hours, minutes, and
seconds will preserve the same length at all times of the year. Equinoctial time is
ascertained by the motion of the sun among the stars, determined by no local circum-
stances, but is the same at the same instant in every part of the globe. Time, then, is
a measure of angular motion. The clock gives the distances of the heavenly bodies
from the equinox, by observing the instant at which each passes the meridian, and
converting the interval into arcs at the rate of 15° to an hour : for the earth’s
surface being divided into 360 equal parts (by imaginary lines), which are called
degrees of longitude, and its daily revolution round its own axis being performed in
twenty-four hours, consequently in that period each of those degrees must come
successively opposite the sun ; and it must follow, then, that the time any one of
those lines passes the sun until the next passes must be just four minutes ; for
twenty-four hours being divided by 360, will give that quantity.
The rule for converting degrees, minutes, and seconds, into time, at the rate of
360° for twenty-four hours, is as follows:—say as 360°: 24/i., or as 15° : \h., any
given number of degrees, &c. : the time required.

Example.
Reduce 49° 14' 10" into time:—
Find in the 3rd column 40°, against which in the fourth h. m s
column is 2 40' 0
In the first column against 9° is 0 36 0
do— do—lo' is 0 0 40
“do do— Vis . 0 0 16
In thefifth column against 10" is 0 6
The time required 3 16 56.6
With the rule here laid down, anyone desirous may ascertain the exact time at
any of the adjoining colonies, and the difference in time between them and Hobart
Town or London.
It is hoped, from the explanations given, that no apology is necessary for dividing
the Ephemeris into two distinct parts : the one designed for Navigation being
adapted to the meridian of Greenwich; the other part, more suited to the
convenience of amateur astronomers, to the meridian of Hobart Town.
The writer, being much occupied in the duties of public and private business has
had some difficulty in devoting sufficient time to either revising the proof sheets or
correcting the press; errors may therefore have eluded his observation, to which
he earnestly solicits a notice, addressed to the publisher, of those either in omission
or commission, which any reader may happen to detect.

FEBRUARY.
Transplant in an open compartment a general crop of celery, in trenches •
plant some young cabbages, plants pretty thick, to come in for coleworts •
sow also some cabbage seeds in beds, which must be watered in dry weather. Con-
tinue to sow and transplant lettuce and endive ; keep beds of young and old asparagus
clear from weeds with the hand. Sow onions for winter and spring use, and examine
the beds of keeping and bulbous onions ; pull them as soon as the tops are decayed.
Gather seeds of all kinds as soon as ripe, as if left too long the seed will fall out of
the pods. Look to wall-trees, cut out useless shoots, and nail the others straight to
the wall. Keep all fruit-tree borders clear from weeds. Continue budding, and after
the bud is inserted tie a cabbage leaf over it to protect it from the rays of the sun.
Flower Garden—Sow polyanthus and auricula seed, and transplant perennial and
biennial plants in showery weather; mow grass walks and lawns, to keep up a neat
appearance.

MARCH.
Plant cabbages to come in for coleworts and heading; thin and weed
beds of spinach. Sow small salads of different kinds once a fortnight; hoe and thin
turnips— cut the weeds clean away with a sharp hoe, leaving the turnips six inches
apart. Make a plantation of strawberries at the end of the month, also prepare mush-
room beds. Flower Garden— Commence planting bulbs; keep the borders neat
by cutting off rambling shoots, dead flower-stems, weeds, and other litter. Put sticks
in weak growing plants; strike honeysuckle cuttings. Dig your potatoes, and
do so effectually; they become otherwise a troublesome weed. The seeds of
most biennials and perennials may now be sown.

Earth up all previously planted cabbages, also peas, beans, &c.; as they
advance in growth make another plantation of cauliflowers. Plant and sow more
lettuce and endive for succession ; earth up celery, being careful not to let any mould
touch the hearts; land up cardoons. Dig and trench up all vacant ground. May
now commence matting plantations of fruit- trees; plant raspberries; finish taking
up potatoes, Jerusalem artichokes, &c.; to save seed, transplant cabbage, parsnip,
beet, &e. Strawberries, to bear well, must have the runners cut off. Flower Gar-
den—Plant forest trees, both deciduous and evergreeen, in well pulverized ground •
propagate the same by cuttings and layers. Transplant also native trees and shrubs’
gather tree seeds, dig flower borders. Commence replanting your flower bulbs, care-

Take up all potatoes which are ripe, also heet-roots, carrots, parsnips, &c.
Sow in a warm border a first crop of early frame peas, and also a crop of dwarf grow-
ing mazagan beans ; continue to plant cabbage plants, for cabbaging and cole worts.
lie up endive and lettuce ; clean the beds of winter and spring onions. Make hot-
beds and commence forcing early asparagus, sow a small crop of carrots for early use;
dress the beds of rhubarb, artichokes, and asparagus—to the latter apply salt, if
attainable ; cover up the seakale to blanch. This is the best time to plant out fruit-
trees ; sow at this time seeds and nuts of plum, cherry, almond, medlar, apple, pear,
quince, walnut, &c.—these are, in Tasmania, usually sown much too late in the spring.
Flower Garden— Strike geraniums, China roses, &c. from cuttings ; part herbace-
ous plants ; finish planting Cape bulbs. The borders may be dug over this month.

AUGUST.
Plant seed potatoes of the early kinds ; sow salsafy and scorzonera, spinach,
peas, beans, broccoli, cauliflower, turnips, parsley, &c.; sow celery, potherbs,
kidney beans, &c. Transplant cabbages and savoys—graft your trees, plant out
suckers in rows. Flower Garden— Dig up and manure the flower borders where
the soil is poor, to give them a neat appearance during the spring. Sow annual flower
seeds if in seed beds ; select a border with a southern aspect, to prevent the effects
of the severe frosts, when they are coming up. Of ordinary flower plants which you
wish to strike from cuttings, you cannot delay beyond this month.

OCTOBER.
Sow turnips for a full summer crop, plant out pumpkins and vegetable
marrows, sow celery for a main crop, and in a rich plot of ground ; sow a full
crop of kidney beans and scarlet runners, sow broccoli to come in for winter use •
transplant cabbages, garlicks, shallots, and chives; sow American cresses, cardoons!
and lettuce; cut weeds. Thinning and binding must be attended to, particularly car-
rots, parsnips, and onions ; in thinning onions plant out those you have taken out,
they often become the best crop. Shelter your kidney beans and tender plants by
sticking honeysuckle boughs over them, the leaves of which do not easily drop off
Flower Garden-Sow mignionette and ten-week stocks ; and on a dry day cut up
all weeds ; turn geraniums, fuchsias, hydrangeas, and other plants out into borders.

DECEMBER.
Plant a full crop of savoys for winter and autumn use; transplant leeks,
sow more turnips, hoe and thin the crop of beet-root, sow small salading every
week, plant celery into trenches ; water every morning, before sunrise, in dry weather
all beds and newly planted articles—prune and train the summer shoots of fruit-trees.
Flower Garuen— Pay strict attention to the flowers that were sown in patches in
the borders, and where they are too thick, thin them about four or five ; cut out all
straggling shoots and keep the borders regularly hoed and raked. During this and
the preceding month allow no weeds to seed, and plants destroyed now will be the
means of saving much labour next month.


PHENOMENA, 1859.
During the past year, 1859, there has been a great paucity in new
discoveries made by Astronomers, when compared with the previous year
of 1858. hi ew Planets and Comets have either eluded observation, or
information has not yet reached us of such discoveries. We heard of but one
Comet, discovered by M. Temple at Venice in April last; but we learn, on the
other hand, that from 72,000 stars catalogued in the neighbourhood of the
Ecliptic by Mr. Cooper, 77 stars, which had been previously observed, had
disappeared. This remarkable fact has been confirmed by M. Cliacornac, who
has published 18 charts of Ecliptic stars.
We have, however, to record for the Southern Hemisphere one of the most
magnificent Auroras,* which, for extent and beauty, has never been surpassed,
either from the North or South Pole; and what makes this phenomenon more
valuable, it fulfilled all the conditions, in the opinion of the Joint Magnetic
Committee of the British Association and the Royal Society, as expressed in
their Report, which establishes the existence of a very extraordinary
periodicity of all the magnetic elements, and connects them directly with
the physical constitution of the Sun, and with the periodical greater or less
prevalence of spots on its surface : the maxima of fluctuation corresponding
with the maxima of the spots, and these again with the exhibition of the
Aurora. Professor Faraday has shown that effects similar to those he had
obtained by instrumental means, but infinitely greater in force, might be
produced by the action of the Globe as a magnet upon its own mass, in
consequence of its diurnal rotation : the Aurora would then be produced by a
discharge of electricity, thus urged towards the Poles, and endeavouring to
return above the earth to the Equatorial regions.

Epitome of the History of Tasmania.
On the 27tli January, 1804, H.M. Ship Calcutta, 18 guns, and 170 men, com-
manded by Captain Daniel Woodriff, R.N., and the hired transport Ocean,
600 tons, Capt. Matthews, sailed from Port Phillip with 100 convicts for
Tasmania, having a Military Guard of Royal Marines, with Lieutenants
Edward Lord, Sladen, and Johnson; 7 soldiers’ wives, and 16 prisoners’
wives: the whole being commanded by Colonel David Collins, of the Royal
Marines. The Rev. Robert Knopwood accompanied the party as Chaplain
Dr, E. P. Bromley, R.N., was Surgeon, Mr., Bowden, Assistant-Surgeon, Mr!
Prideaux Harris, Surveyor, and Mr. A. W. H. Humphrey, Mineralogist!
Just before leaving Port Phillip, Governor Collins issued a Garrison Order!
dated 31st Dec. 1803, in which he hurried the departure of the vessels from
“so unpromising and unproductive a country.” Mixed up with the pipe-clay
of parole and countersign, details of garrison duty and guard mounting,
the early straggles of the new Colony are quaintly and briefly, though painfully!
told in an old mouldy Garrison Order Book, which alone of all the
records of the Colony escaped the ruthless hands of two officers of the Govern-
ment, who, it is said, on the night of Governor Collins’ death, on 24th March,
1810, burned all the books and papers they could find, for purposes known to
themselves and One other. This book states that the vessels cast anchor in
Sullivan’s Cove on the 19th February, and on the 20th landed their cargoes
at “ the Camp,” where for some time scurvy to a great extent prevailed, while
flour was £ll2 a ton, and the Aborigines were troublesome. On the 3rd
May, 1804, a hostile collision took place between the Troops and Blacks
when 60 of the latter were shot. In 1805, the Aborigines attacked the Camp’
but were repulsed with the loss of 40 lives. Some idea may be formed of the
number of Aboriginal inhabitants from the fact that the Brown’s River tribe
alone consisted of upwards of 300 in 1806, while the Ben Lomond and Oyster
Bay tribes were each known to be much more numerous.
In 1807, the price of wheat was regulated by Garrison Order; and, while
armed sentinels mounted guard over the wheat-fields, the settlers were
limited to a price of £4 a bushel.
In 1808 the position of the Colony must have been fearful, for my friendly
Garrison Order Book states that in July “ all the wheat and maize were
exhausted, and barley had to be eaten,”—that “in August all the salt beef and
pork were gone, and kangaroo meat had to be .obtained,”—and “in October
all the barley was gone, and a pound and a half of rice was issued as the
weekly ration per man.” At this time the Settlement numbered about 400
souls, lhe only vessel that arrived was one from Bengal with sugar, which
was purchased and issued by the Government to the settlers in June, 1808.
Rnsoners slop clothing was issued to the settlers, who were permitted bv
Garrison order to pay their debts to the Crown in wheat at fifteen shillings
n Dusnei.
In 1809, the Troops in Sydney revolted, and, headed by their officers,
deposed Governor Bhgh, afterwards Commander of the Bounty • His
Excellency being sent down under guard to the Derwent in H.M. ship Porpoise
with which vessel all communication was forbidden by Garrison Order.
F


In 1810, the Colony was aided by an immigration of 1100 free settlers from
Norfolk Island, who were located on small farms about O’Brien’s Bridge,
New Norfolk, and Norfolk Plains. Prom this time up to 1817, the Colony
appears to have been almost in a stagnant condition; but in this year, the
Peninsular War being over, Colonel Sorell arrived as Governor, and many
half-pay and retired Officers of both services emigrated and obtained free grants
of land, and these became the pioneers of social, moral, and agricultural
progress in Tasmania.
The Government became the purchasers of some Bengalee cows and a few
sheep, and then sold them to the Settlers, taking promissory notes for the
sums, payable, either in money or kind, in three years. The Commissariat
Officer was also Queen’s Storekeeper; and everything, as the Yankee says,
“ from a needle to an anchor, or from a skein of thread to a cable,” was
sold from H.M. Stores. As late as 1819, the Commissary who then took charge,
D.A.C.-General Hull, had to look up three or four thousand pounds worth
of these little bills, and to call in the cows and sheep, with indifferent success.
At this time the merchants and settlers used to issue printed promissory
notes, varying in value from sixpence to a dollar —some printed by a witty
merchant in red ink sold very well; and the currency of the Colony
was almost entirely in this paper money, the circulation of which was at last
stopped by an Act of Council in September, 1826, which provided that any person
issuing a cheque or note under twenty shillings in value should be fined up
to £2O by any Justice of the Peace. It is not perhaps known that this Act
is still in force.
The following Table will concisely shew the rise of the Colony: —

The Island contains 14,482,892 acres of land. It is watered by numerous
rivers, which take their rise in the high country in the centre of the Island,
where are 13 lakes covering an area of a hundred and twelve thousand acres.
These rivers run to the sea on all sides, principally to the S.E. and N.W. of
the island, three of them being navigable by large vessels for 40 miles from
their sea-mouths.
Up to 31st December, 1858, there had been sold to settlers 91,298 acres for
£130,559, and Eree Grants had been made of 2,819,339; while 778,751 acres
were leased from the Crown for the purpose of depasturing sheep and cattle,
at an annual rental of £23,584.
Fixe millions of acres in the western part of the Island, having two Ports
and several large rivers, have been devoted by the Government for gratuitous
grant or lease to persons willing to settle thereon. Grants to be made of not
more than 640 acres or less than 50, provided the settler has £1 of capital for
every acre so granted, and resides on his land and cultivates a portion of it.
Leases of lots not more than 10,000 acres in extent, at a peppercorn rental,
the only condition being that 100 sheep or 20 head of cattle shall be depas-
tured on every 1000 acres, for not less than five months of each year; —the
leases to be for 10 years. On the 15th August, 1859, 2,144,520 acres had been
leased under these conditions, and 640 acres had been sold; while 158,800 acres
have been selected for purchase at 20s. an acre, under the 19th clause of the
Waste Lands Act.


Population. —The Population according to the Census, which was last
taken on 31st March, 1857, was as follows: —
Men, —Married 14,333
„ —Single 31,583
■ 15,916
Women, —Married 14,524
„ —Single 20,362
34,886
Troops with their families 690
81,492
Of the male population, 13,745 were under 14 years of age
Of the female population, 13,598 „ „ „
If to the total of 81,492 are added the births and arrivals, and the deaths
and departures are deducted, the total population on Ist January, 1859, appears
to have been 84,080 ; troops, with women and children, 340. The prisoner
population in Tasmania consisted of—•
Men under coercion 736
Women „ 78
Men at service or working at their trades 1117
Women „ „ „ 156
The Aborigines number 13 : they are placed at Oyster Cove, about 30
miles from Hobart Town, under the care of a married Medical Superintendent,
where they receive ample supplies of clothing, food, and tobacco. Their names

ot which £749,210 were from Great Britain. The Exports of 1858 were
£1,151,609, of which £429,263 were sent to Great Britain; and of the
balance, Grain to the value of £293,609, and Timber to the value of £llO,lOl
were exported, principally to the adjacent colonies. Amongst the exports of
x he year were £397,533 worth of Wool, and 251 ounces of Tasmanian Gold,
the produce of the mines at Fingal, valued at £BSO.
Timber Trees. —The woods of Tasmania are of great value for building
purposes, and many of them are capable of a fine polish, and are beautifully
veined, fitting them in a high degree for cabinet-work. The Tasmanian
woods received seven Prize Medals and five Certificates of Honor at the
Great Exhibition in London in 1851, and two Silver Medals and two Cer-
tificates of Honor at the Paris Exhibition of 1855. The principal descriptions
of timber are the Eucalyptus, or gum trees; the Acacia, or wattle trees • the
Huon and other pines; the sassafras, myrtle, &c., &c. Of these the Blue
Gum attains a maximum height of 350 feet, with a maximum girth of 102
feet: its specific gravity is 948-275, while the weight of a cubic foot is 57
pounds 4 ounces. The myrtle (fagus Cunningliamii) grows to a maximum
height of 200 feet, with a girth of 36 feet; the sassafras, 140 feet • cedar
| ee * 5 celery-topped pine, 150 feet; swamp gum, 300 feet; stringy bark’
300 feet, with a maximum girth of 72 feet.
the Colony for 1860 are estimated at
£300,239. Ihe debt ot the Colony on 30th September, 1859, was £295 660 •
pf which £113,700 had been incurred for Public Works; £31,980 for Roads
and Bridges; and £70,000 to pay arrears of the year 1856. Debentures
bearing 6 per cent, interest, have been issued for this debt, repayable in
instalments of not more than £25,000 a-year, for a period running over 30
years, and secured on the Land Fund and General Revenue.
GEOLOGY.
(Authorities.— Juices; StrslecJci; Milligan; Tally, sc.)
Tasmania may be said to be entirely occupied by a network of ridges, called
here -tiers, enclosing a multitude of small plains and valleys. In two or three
places thesummits of these ridges attain a height of 5,000 feet, while several
reach 4,000 feet. From the N.E. corner of Tasmania, the chain may on a
hue day be traced in winding and lengthened array across Bass’s Straits, by


the curved line of lofty and rugged islands that lead up to Wilson’s Promon-
tory in Victoria. From this point the chain strikes into the interior of New
South Wales, and attains its greatest elevation in Mount Kosciusko, 6,500
feet high.
In the N.B. comer of Tasmania, granitic and metamorphic rocks exist in
large masses, and in still larger force over its S.W. portion. They also show
themselves at three other positions in the centre and on the northern coast.
The rest of the Island seems to he formed of great intersecting ridges of
greenstone, enclosing plains or valleys of the palaeozoic formation. From no
points are the grandeur and infinite diversity of this mountain scenery better
viewed than from the lofty craggy battlements of Ben Lomond and Mount
Wellington, which, although 90 miles apart, may yet be seen from each other
by a good eye on a clear day.
The range towards St. Clair and the Frenchman’s Cap is topped for the
most part by hare and cloven summits of quartz rock and sienite. Mount
Wellington is composed of massive greenstone. In ascending this mountain
we first pass over white and yellow sandstones, nearly horizontal; then appear
shales and limestone, also horizontal, 2,500 feet above the level of the sea ;
then the capping of greenstone, at least 1,700 feet thick.
_ Sandstone of a firm solid nature, containing an enormous proportion of
silica, and beautifully white, appears close to the surface in the village of
Bellerive, and is largely quarried by Mr. Pitfield for exportation to Melbourne,
where it is used for fronts and pillars for public buildings. Limestone, of a dark
blue colour and richly interspersed with fossils, is quarried on Mr. Hull’s estate
at Tolosa, and the stone is carted to town and burned by Mr. Shoobridge, for the
market. Of these fossils, two specimens of stenopora, two of produeta, three
of fenestella, six of spirifer, two of pecten, and a caryophyllsea, are found.
Above New Norfolk much fossil wood is found, sometimes in large trees.
On High Plains the country is strewn with opalized wood and igneous rock,
of a character which leads one to suppose that it certainly has flowed as lava
in the open air. The coal formations appear at the Douglas River and Fin-
gal, at Spring Bay and the Schouten Island, at Port Arthur, at Adventure
Bay, Port Davey, Both well, Ouse River, Hamilton, Jerusalem, Mersey, Rich-
mond, New Town, and other places;—some of the formations being highly
bituminous, others anthracitic.
Granite is found on the Eldon Range, on Ben Lomond, and on the French-
man’s Cap Mountains.
Granular mica, tabular quartz, and feldspar are found on Flinder’s Island
and Cape Portland. Porphyritic granite is found on the Eldon Range.
Sienite is found on Flinder’s Island, Port Davey, St. Patrick’s Head, &e;
quartz rock, on the Meander and Mersey Rivers, Rocky Cape, Cape Grim,
and the head of the Derwent River. Serpentine is found in masses on the
Asbestos Hills; mica schist at Port Sorell and the Mersey; siliceous slate
on St. George’s River, Emu Bay, &c. Limestone is found in almost every
part of the Island; porphyry on the Foresters’ River, and at Waterhouse
and the River Nive; basalt and lava, at George Town, Ben Lomond, Lake
Arthur, Lake St. Clair, Mount Wellington, Hamilton, Tasman’s Peninsula.
Quartz rock with slate is found at Fingal, Frenchman’s Cap, Ringarooma,
River Inglis, &c., and it is from this matrix that the Gold is extracted at
Fingal, where two Quartz Crushing Companies have themselves,
and about 150 miners are at present emyloyed in Gold digging.

carriers, carters, butchers, &c., as may be raised in the district, and (as the Rural
Police rate will cease immediately on the proclamation of each Municipality) such
rate as may be considered necessary by the electors to be raised for Police purposes.

UNSETTLED LAND REGULATIONS.
021 Victoria, No. 34 .)
The following are the Regulations for the disposal of the Waste Lands of
the Crown in the Unsettled Districts, which lands extend from South Cape
to the River Arthur on the North-West Coast. Through this part of the
country flow the Arthur, Gordon, King, Huon, Florentine, Frankland, Hor-
ton, and Hellyer rivers; here are also Lakes Pedder and Pefrarch, and smaller
lakes, —while the extensive inlets of Port Davey and Macquarie Harbour, on
the West Coast, afford accommodation for large vessels. The valley of the
Florentine is described as likely to become the Dairy of Tasmania, in con-
sequence of the richness of its soil and the advantage it possesses of flowing
streams.
The Commissioner of Crown Lands, with the express authority in each
case of the Governor in Council, may contract in writing with any person
eligible under this section for the grant to him in fee simple, upon the per-
formance of the conditions to be specified in such contract, of any unsettled
lands, the quantity so to be contracted for not being less in each case than
fifty acres, nor more than six hundred and forty acres ; every such contract
to be made under such Regulations as may from time to time be made by the
Governor in Council, but in every case to be made in conformity with the
following requirements: —
The person applying for a grant under this section shall prove to the
satisfaction of the Commissioner that he is desirous of settling upon and
cultivating the land applied for, and that he is possessed of capital equal in
amount to one pound sterling for every acre of land applied for —live stock,
machinery, implements of husbandry, and other articles which may be appli-
cable to agricultural purposes or to sawing timber to be considered as capital.
Every such applicant shall make a solemn declaration before the Commis-
sioner, or some person deputed by him, that he has not, nor has any person
as trustee for him or on his behalf, entered into a contract for or obtained a
grant of any land under this section; and that he will not, until he has
obtained a grant of the land contracted for, assign or dispose of his interest
in the same without the consent in writing of the Commissioner.
And every such contract shall contain and embody as conditions prece-
dent to the issue of a grant, in addition to such stipulations and conditions
as may from time to time be provided by the Governor in Council, the con-
ditions following:—
That the person contracting for the land shall during a period of five


years from the date of the contract actually reside on some part of the land
contracted for.
That during the said period of five years the person contracting for such
land shall clear, fence, and bring into cultivation five acres at least for every
fifty acres contracted, or shall erect or set up thereon buildings or machinery
of the value of two hundred and fifty pounds for every such fifty acres.
In the event of such conditions not being fulfilled at the end of the said
period of five years, the Commissioner shall be entitled to resume possession
of the lands so contracted for; but in the case of a partial fulfilment of such
conditions, then the Governor in Council may, if he thinks fit so to do,
taking into consideration the circumstances of each case, either extend the
time for the fulfilment of such conditions, or make an immediate grant of a
portion of the lands so contracted for —the quantity to be so granted to be
regulated by the extent to which, in the judgment of the Governor in
Council, the conditions have been complied with, or the party may at any
time purchase the land or any portion of it at 10s. an acre.
It shall not be lawful for the person contracting for any such land to
assign or dispose of his interest in such land without the consent in writing
of the Commissioner, and any such assignment or disposition shall be void :
Provided that the contractor shall be entitled to appoint, by writing under
his hand, the person who, in the event of his death before the issue of the
grant, shall be entitled to elect, within one month after his decease, to
assume possession of the lands upon the same terms and conditions as those
under which the contractor was in possession of the same ; and in the event
sf the person so appointed by such contractor not electing to assume pos-
session of such lands, the Commissioner shall resume possession of the same,
and they shall revert to the Crown.
Upon the full performance of the conditions contained in any such con-
tract, but not otherwise, the Governor shall by deed of grant convey and
alienate in fee simple to the person with whom the contract was made, or in
the event of his death during the continuance of the contract to the person
so appointed by such deceased person as aforesaid, the land comprised in such
contract.
It shall be lawful for the Commissioner to let for a term of ten years at a
peppercorn rent any unsettled lands, in parcels not exceeding ten thousand
acres, upon the terms following :
The lessee of such lands shall enter into a covenant with the Commissioner,
in addition to any covenants required by the regulations which may from
time to time be issued by the Governor in Council, that the lessee will,
within one year after the commencement of such term, stock the land
demised with sheep or cattle, or both, in the proportion of one hundred sheep
or twenty head of cattle, or a proportionate number of each to every one
thousand acres of land demised; and that he will, during the continuance of
the term, keep such stock upon the land during at least five months of
every year of the said tenn.
Every such lease shall contain a proviso for re-entry by the Commissioner
in the event of non-compliance with the covenants of the lease.
Every such lease shall contain a proviso or authority for the determination
of the term granted, at any time after the expiration of the first two years
of the term, upon six months’ notice by the Commissioner or by the lessee ;
and that, in the event of the determination of the term by the lessee at any
time during the last three years of the same, he shall leave all improvements
effected by him on the land unimpaired ; and that in the event of the deter-
mination of the lease at any time during the tenn by the Commissioner
otherwise than for forfeiture by non-performance of the covenants, then that
the lessee shall be entitled to compensation for all fences and buildings


erected, and all drainage formed, and for all reasonable improvements effected
by such lessee; the amount of such compensation, in case of dispute, to he
settled by arbitration in the mode prescribed by The Lands Clauses Act for
the settlement of disputes by arbitration, one arbitrator to be chosen by the
lessee and one by the Commissioner.
Upon the non-performance of any of the covenants or conditions in any
such lease, or upon the expiration of any such notice, the lease shall be void
and the land shall revert to the Crown.
It shall not be lawful for the lessee to assign his interest in any such lease
without the consent in writing of the Commissioner; but every such assign-
ment without such consent shall be void, and the land shall thereupon revert
to the Crown.
It shall not be lawful for the Commissioner to contract with the same
person for a grant, or for the Governor to issue a grant, of more than one lot
or parcel of land, or to let to the same person more than one lot or parcel of
land under the provisions of this Act; and any contract, grant, or lease for a
second or subsequent lot or parcel of land otherwise than under The Tt aste
Lands Act shall be void, and the land comprised in such subsequent con-
tract, grant, or lease shall revert to the Crown.
Whenever under this Act land reverts to the Crown, the Commissioner
may enter and resume possession of the same without suit, and the same
shall he disposable as Unsettled Lands under this Act, or as Waste Lands of
the Crown.

Vital Statistics, 1859.
By E. SWARBRECK HALL, Medical Practitioner.
POPULATION.
By the Census of 31st March, 1857, the total population of Tasmania was
81,492. By computing the increase from “births ” and “arrivals ”in the
Island, against the “ deaths ” and “ departures,” the population on the 31st
December, 1858, was estimated at 84,420.
BIRTHS.
During the first quarter of 1859, the total births registered in Tasmania
were 769. In the corresponding quarter of 1858, there were 770. The
relative proportion of the births for the different registration districts, how-
ever, underwent considerable alterations. The births in the Hobart Town
district diminished by about 17 per cent, in the first quarter of 1859. Laun-
ceston had only four less births on the total number. The country districts,
on the whole, increased in the same proportion that the town districts
decreased. Some of the country districts had fewer births than in 1858; and
the increase principally occurred in Franklin, Clarence Plains, Deloraine,
Fingal, Kingston, Oatlands, and Port Sorell. The 769 births in the first
quarter of 1859 were abnormally divided between the sexes, only 364 being
males to 405 females. In 1858, the proportions were normal—39B males to
372 females, —the males preponderating in about the usual ratio.
In the second quarter of 1859, the births were 801, being 7 more than for
the corresponding quarter of 1858. Hobart Town district had for its share
267, or 39 more than in 1858, being within 5 of what it was below in the
preceding quarter. Launceston was, as in the previous quarter, a few below
the corresponding quarter of 1858. Morven and New Norfolk were the
country districts principally in excess over 1858; and Franklin, Clarence
Plains, Fingal, and particularly Deloraine, were those the most below : thus
nearly balancing the disproportion for the previous quarter. The males for
this quarter of 1859 were 421, the females 380. The male proportion was
therefore more than double the usual preponderance. In 1858 a like
disparity existed.
In the third quarter of 1859, 875 children were born—449 males, 426
females: being as nearly as possible the normal ratio of excess of males. In
the same quarter of 1858, the births were only 816, boys and girls being
nearly alike, or 410 of the first to 406 of the last. Of the 59 births in excess
of 1858, for this quarter, Hobart Town had only 6, Launceston had 24, and the
remainder fell principally to the share of Oatlands, Horton, Port Sorell,
Deloraine, Clarence Plains, Richmond, Glamorgan, Hamilton, and Ralph’s
Bay. Some of the country districts, on the other hand, had much fewer
births than in the corresponding quarter of 1858.
Much knowledge of the exact number of births occurring in each quarter
cannot be gleaned from these statements, because the period of registration
after birth varies so much. The absolute increase of the population by
registered births in the three first quarters of 1859 over that of the same
period of time in 1868 was 65. In Sydney, during the periods here compared,
the increase was 71. The total number of births registered in the first nine


months of 1859 is 2,445, or 1 birth per annum to every 27 of the population.
But had all the children bom alive during the period specified been registered,
it is indubitable that the total births would not be less than 3,000. In 1858,
there was a decrease of 108 births, in comparison with the registered births
in 1857.
DEATHS.
The summer quarter of Tasmania, the winter quarter of England, are the
most fatal to human life. Aridity and heat in the one, moisture and cold in
the other, are the predominant causes of the results in each.
In the first quarter of 1859, the deaths registered for Tasmania were 461,
245 of the number being males, 216 females. In the same quarter of 1858,
the deaths were 37 more, or 498. But the summer of 1858 was a very
unhealthy one, arising from a long continued drought. Diarrhoea and
dysentery —as is usual under such circumstances in Tasmania —prevailed
epidemically throughout the Island, and still more so in the Australian
Colonies. Infant life suffered to a great extent. On the other hand, in 1859,
a disease new to Tasmanian medical practitioners arose, and augmented the
mortality somewhat beyond what it would otherwise have been. Diphtheria,
the disease alluded to, broke out almost simultaneously in two country districts,
in January. The first deaths that can be ascribed to this type of throat
disease occurred in New Norfolk on the 17th, and in Oatlands on the 18th
of January. Two children, removed from the latter district while suffering
from the disease, died in Hobart Town in February. The origin of the disease
in Tasmania has not yet been traced out. There can be little doubt that it was
imported, but through what channel is so far unknown. The Hobart Town
share of the mortality for this quarter was 207, about four-ninths of the
whole, while the population of its registration district bears a much smaller
proportion than that of one-third to the whole Tasmanian population. In
1858, the deaths were 10 more. Launceston had only 86 deaths in 1859 to
108 in 1858, during this quarter.
In the second quarter of 1859, 324 deaths were registered—l 93 being
males, 131 females. Hobart Town had more than one-third of the whole, or
121; though it was still smaller than that of 1858 by 11. Launceston hacl
70 deaths, being 7 more than for the corresponding quarter of 1858. For all
Tasmania, this quarter’s deaths in 1858 were 348, or 24 more than that
of 1859.
The third, or winter quarter of Tasmania, is usually the least fatal to
human life. The deaths this quarter in 1859, however, were five more than
in the preceding quarter, or 329: 210 of them were males, and only 119
females : though it is a well-established fact that the female proportion of the
population is rapidly gaining upon the male, and daily diminishing the extreme
disparity of the sexes that formerly existed. The Hobart Town share of deaths
in this quarter is also very large, being 138, or more than two-fifths of the
whole : nevertheless it is still 34 fewer deaths than in the same quarter of
1858. Launceston had 61 deaths in 1859, to 65 in 1858. The whole island
in 1858 had 394 deaths in this quarter, or 65 more than in 1859. This
coupled with the fact that 65 more births were registered, shows the nine
first months of 1859 to have been more favourable to life than the same
period of 1858.
A minute analysis of the meteorological phenomena, during the periods
compared, gives satisfactory reasons for the improvement alluded to ; but the
details, though elaborated every month by me, are too prolix for general
interest. One thing is perfectly patent, that variations of temperature


merely, do not add so much to mortality in Tasmania, as has usually been
attributed to this phase of climatic influence in England. Atmospheric
pressure and movement seem to claim a greater share of sanative power
than have hitherto been awarded to them. Frequent and moderate showers
of rain are distinctly traced to have the most beneficial effects on health.
No doubt their efficacy in great measure is owing to the combined action of
chemical and mechanical forces : —chemically, by restoring electrical equi-
librium, generating ozone, and dissolving aerial impurities; and mechanically,
by precipitating noxious gases and dust from the air, and removing putrifying
vegetable and animal matter from the neighbourhood of our habitations.
Some of these effects could be easily produced by artificial means. In
Victoria and New South Wales, the intense power of the sun’s rays is
considered to add to the mortality, by inducing various brain diseases. These
diseases, however, are comparatively more prevalent and destructive in
Tasmania. It is a singular fact, that owing to the greater diaphaneity of
the atmosphere in Tasmania, solar intensity is higher in this island than
in the colonies nearer to the equator. The necessity, therefore, for protecting
the head is more urgent in Tasmania than it is in Victoria or New South
Wales. Light-coloured felt hats, with turban-like coverings, are sensible
summer head-dresses. But, while men adopt such shields, it is melancholy
to see how much even the youngest children are exposed without any pro-
tection at all for their heads. Numberless children are constantly perishing
from convulsions and brain diseases, which originate in this senseless
custom.
The aggregate mortality in Tasmania, for the first nine months of 1859 is
1114, or 126 less than the corresponding period of 1868. Assuming the total
population of Tasmania on the 30th June, 1859, to be 85,000 souls, the rate
of mortality for the whole island will be less than lO.j per thousand per
annum : or one death per annum in every 61 persons of the population. The
rate for all England and Wales is 22 to 23 per thousand, and that of the 64
healthiest districts, selected by the Registrar-General, and assumed to be the
natural standard of mortality, is 17 per thousand. Yet favourable a contrast
as this is for Tasmania, a more minute comparison will be still more advan-
tageous to our naturally salubrious island. By separating the high mortality
of Hobart Town and Launceston from the whole, and calculating rural deaths
to rural population, the rate of mortality is found to be about 11 \ per thousand
per annum, or 3| per thousand less than the district of Glendale in Nor-
thumberland: the healthiest registration district in England and Wales.
The city of Hobart Town and the town of Launceston exhibit a very different
and abnormal proportion. The purely urban rate per annum for Hobart Town
would be 27 per thousand, being equal to that of the notoriously unhealthy
town of Liverpool. Launceston rate was equally as great. The English
towns _ rate of deaths exceeds the rural rate by only about 6 per thousand;
while in Tasmania, the excess of the towns rate over the rural one is 15| per
thousand. A disparity, approaching to this, formerly existed between Ely
and its rural environs ; but the vigorous application of sanitary science has
reversed the comparison, Ely now having two per thousand less mortality
than its rural neighbourhood. Liverpool, too, by similar efforts, reduced its
mortality from 36 per thousand to 27 ; and in the single year of 1857 this
effected a saving of upwards of3ooo human lives. The municipal authorities,
both of Hobart Town and Launceston, have already done much to amend the
unsanitary condition of their respective towns, but the improvements are
still far short of what may be achieved by sanitary skill in places naturally
so propitious to health.

whom the Governor has granted the privilege of Franking; or unless they be
from a subordinate Officer to the Head of his Department; or from the Police
to the Head of any Department or to Police authorities. Therefore all Letters
or Packets from other parties, though addressed to officers entitled to frank,
must be prepaid by means of postage stamps, or be detained and dealt with as
Unstamped,” or “ Insufficiently Stamped,” letters or packets, as the case


may be, excepting only those which come under the exemptions from Postage

from England, India, the British Colonies, Foreign Countries, the Australias,

at the several Post Offices in the interior, free of all postage; and at Hobart
Town and Launceston they are delivered by means of the letter carriers, or
at the windows of their respective Post Offices, in like manner, free. This is
a reciprocal arrangement between Tasmania and England, and all the Aus-
tralian Colonies; provided the letters and packets be transmitted through
the Post Offices of the respective Countries or Colonies from which they may
be forwarded ; and provided also that they bear theib appeopeiate Postage
Stamps.
XII. — ln order to prevent disappointment, the particular attention of the
public is invited to the following instructions to Postmasters :—
The several Postmasters are required to take special care that all Letters
and Packets posted at their respective Offices hear Tasmanian Postage Stamps
to the full amount of the Postage Rates to which they may be liable by the
regulations, and that no Letter or Packet be allowed to pass free excepting
such as are correctly franked by parties duly authorized to frank letters and
packets on public service only, or such as come under one or other of the

marked to be so forwarded.
2. —Mails for California, New Zealand, Sandwich Islands, Sydney, Tahiti, and
Twofold Bay, are made up and forwarded by each trip of the steamer

Letters or Packets which are intended for the East or West Indies, and
other warm climates, or which in their transit must necessarily pass through
warm climates, should not be sealed with wax, unless it has been prepared
for the purpose. Considerable delay is frequently occasioned in the case of
mails received from England in consequence of the melting of the wax and
adhesion of the letters to each other; and, notwithstanding the greatest care
is taken in separating the letters, many are much damaged and torn : the
public are therefore recommended, in all cases, to use wafers in preference to
wax in securing their letters and packets, and to advise their correspondents
in England, India, &c., to pursue the same conrse.
XVII. —The Names of the Post Office or Mail Receiving House, to be
invariably inserted in the Address of Letters, <sfc.
The public are recommended to date their Letters from the Post Town or

packets, and to advise their correspondents to insert the same in the direction
of their correspondence, in order to ensure, as far as practicable, accuracy and
despatch in their transmission and delivery.

IMMIGRATION.
The Commissioners of Immigration (vide page 45) have issued the follow-
ing Regulations for persons desirous of introducing Servants or their Rela-
tives from Great Britain :
A person resident in Tasmania, who may wish to bring to the Colony any
person from Great Britain, will have to write to the Emigration Commis-
sioners, of whom the Colonial Secretary is Chairman ; and if he wishes to
bring out a family of a man and wife with all their children under 12 years
old, he will have to enclose £l5 in aid of the expense to which the Govern-
ment will he put in providing passages; if for a single female above 12 years
old, £5 ; for a single male above 12 years old, £lO. A Bounty Ticket will
then be issued to him, which he may send home to the person or persons he
may wish to introduce, who can then assign the Ticket to the Master of any
vessel sailing for Tasmania, in which he or they will he granted a passage, —
the Master receiving from the Government £l6 for each parent or adult above
12 years old, £8 for each child from 3 to 12 years old, and £4 for every
child under 3 years old. If any of the emigrants die on the voyage, half the
passage money will be forfeited by the Master. The emigrants will be
treated as steerage or intermediate passengers, and as such will be supplied
with medical comforts, provisions, and water, including fresh provisions and
vegetables. For fifteen days after arrival in the Tasmanian Port, the emi-
grants will be accommodated, provisioned, receive medical comforts, and be
landed at the expense of the Colonial Government.
The only condition on which the above gratuity is payable being that the
emigrants shall not avail themselves of the bounty of the Government and
leave the Colony of Tasmania within four years, without repaying the expense
to which the Government will have been put in introducing them.
In connection with the above subject, it may be mentioned that a
Servants’ Home has been established in Argyle-street, Hobart Town.
Lady Young is Patroness, and there is a Managing Committee of 14 ladies of
various religious denominations, one of whom visits the Home daily. Mrs.
T. J. Crouch is the Secretary of this Committee; and the Executive Com-
mittee consists of Archdeacon Davies and eight other Gentlemen, with F.
Mackie, Esq., as Treasurer, and T. J. Crouch, Esq., the Under Sheriff, as
Secretary. In the Some, servants find board, lodging, and washing, while
out of places, at extremely moderate charges, and every protection is
afforded to them by the resident matron of this benevolent Institution.

IRRIGATION.
His Excellency, Sir H. E. E. Young, C. 8., as Patron of the Northern
Agricultural Society, in his opening address brought prominently under the
notice of the members the very high economic importance of Irrigation;
seeing that its general adoption would considerably enhance the productive-
ness of grass lands, and land cultivated with grain crops. Sir Henry men-
tioned twelve lakes in the centre of the Island, at heights varying from 1800
to 4000 feet above the level of the sea, the waters of which flow northwards
and southwards, at a gentle descent, through extensive tracts of level country
These lakes are as follow Lake Arthur, area 15,000 acres; Lakes Sorell and
Crescent, 20,000; Great Lake, 50,000; Lake St. Clair, 10,000 acres, and very
deep; Lake Echo, 5000 acres; and six others of smaller dimensions, from
200 to 3000 acres : covering together more than 100,000 acres. These and
the river-shed of upwards of 1200 miles, point out the very great facilities
which exist m Tasmania for Irrigation. His Excellency drew attention to
two tracts of country in the Lake River Valley of 163,000 acres, all capable
of being placed under Irrigation; and in proof of the value of Irrigation to
grass lands, he cited If acres of Italian rye-grass at New Norfolk, which in
two years produced 84 tons of grass.
l 2


His Excellency is home out fully in his statements by the late Surveyor-
General, James Sprent, Esq., who, at a special meeting of the Tasmanian Royal
Society, summoned for the discussion of this subject, stated that from his
accurate knowledge of the country he was able to speak with authority ; and
he unhesitatingly gave it as his opinion—based upon extended experience—
that there was no country in the world more happily situated as regarded
water, which could be used cheaply and advantageously for Irrigation pur-
poses. At the same meeting was read a Report by the then Police Magistrate of
the County of Cumberland, (one of the most extensive and flourishing Dis-
tricts in the Island), —Mr. Hugh M. Hull,—who had personally examined
the water supply of that county : and his Report favourably mentioned the
results of Irrigation in the rich valley of Meadsfield, the residence of Edward
Nicholas, Esq., J.P.; and at Denistoun, Ratho, Logan, and Hunterston, the
estates of Messrs. Wood, Reid, J.P., McDowall, J.P.,andMaddocks, in the Both-
well District: and the Royal Society recorded its opinion of the desirableness of
initiating a comprehensive measure for turning to advantage the vast natural
capabilities of Tasmania for Irrigation.
PENSIONERS.
During the seven years from 1850 to 1856,526 military enrolled Pensioners
were introduced at the expense of the Crown into Tasmania, bringing with
them 427 wives and 667 children. Of the 526 men, 91 have died since,
leaving their widows and children in occupation of their allotments of land;
426 have been located on free allotments of land; and in the District ofWest-
bury alone 156 have been stationed, where the Government have built them
cottages, and where they form a valuable addition to the labouring popu-
lation. Prom a Return furnished to the Parliament by Major Russell, the
Staff Officer in command, it appears that “one woman and 17 pensioners’
“ children have become temporary burthens on the charity of the public in
“ the last 10 years, while the Establishment of the Pensioners disburses in
“ the Colony between eight and ten thousand pounds per annum of Imperial
“ Funds; and the introduction of these enrolled Pensioners and their
“ families into Tasmania must be looked upon in the light of a boon, rather
“ than as a source of regret and complaint.”

MASTER AND SERVANT LAW.
The Law in force in this Colony with regard to Masters and Servants i#
as follows:
All servants above 16 years of age are amenable to the Law; where they
are younger there is no remedy for masters,—while the servant has the
Court of Requests to apply to for enforcing, payment of wages. The husband
of a married woman, or parent of a child under 18, may terminate a service
by a month’s notice.
A month’s warning on either side is necessary before terminating a service,
unless otherwise specially agreed ; but it is generally understood, that a
servant hired by the week or day, is entitled to a week's or day’s notice.
A written agreement between master and servant is not absolutely
necessary.
Wages, unless otherwise agreed, are to be paid quarterly; and the
payment can be enforced before two Justices, and compensation awarded for
detention, at discretion of Justices.
Absence from service, disobedience of orders, drunkenness in the house,
wilful neglect or damage, renders a servant liable to a fine not more than
£lO, or forfeiture of a portion or all wages due.
Male servants drunk and riotous in the house may he given into custody,
and are liable to a fine up to £2O or imprisonment.
No female servant can he imprisoned under the Act for any offence.
111-treatment, or abusive, or improper language from a master or mistress
fineable up to £3O, payable at the discretion of the Bench to the servant.
The servant must always have a discharge, unless from services under 14
days. Masters hiring servants without discharge liable to a small penalty.
Penalty of £5O for knowingly hiring a neighbour’s servant without
permission.
This is the Act 19 Victoria, No. 28,

BEING himself a thorough practical Mechanical Dentist,
manufactures INCORRODIBLE MINERAL TEETH,
and every other article required in the practice of his profession,
which renders him completely independent of foreign supplies,
and enables him at all times to adapt his materials to the most
difficult and complicated cases and that by an entirely new
method, which does not require the extraction of stumps, or give
the slightest pain, and completely restores articulation and
mastication. , it, ..v
DECAYED TEETH stopped with pure gold —also with a new
cement, which does not discolor the teeth, and, being introduced
in a soft state, can he applied to the most delicate tooth, and,
hardening almost immediately, completely restores it to all its
former usefulness. , ,
CHILDREN’S TEETH.—J. S. would urge upon parents the
necessity of having their Children’s Teeth attended to m time. It
is a well-known fact, that the teeth of the native-born in these
Colonies decay at a most alarming rate ; but it is not so generally
known, that this national calamity may be almost entirely obviated
by timely precautions. . . .
TEETH EXTRACTED without any pain under the influence
of Chloroform. Mr. S. has had great experience in the use of this
agent, having administered it in thousands of cases.

Business of the Society.
Assurance on every contingency of human life.
Issue of Present, Deferred, and Reversionary Annuities.
Granting Endowments lor children and for old age.
Advantages of the Society.
All the profits of each branch belong to the members of
such branch. It is a colonial institution, on the model of
the mcst successful British Offices; whilst from the much
higher rate of interest it obtains on its investments, more
profitable returns are secured to its members than the best
European offices can afford. Thus, at the investigation of
March, 1854, all 'policies then entitled to participate were
increased by Sonus Additions, averaging considerably more
than three per cent, per annum on the sum assured, or about
three times those secured by the most liberal British joint
stock companies.
Bonuses may be applied to the extinction of future annual
premiums, or their value in cash may be handed to the
member.
Surrenders accepted on equitable terms.
General facilities with regard to voyaging, residence
abroad, &c.
Premiums payable yearly, half-yearly, or quarterly.
