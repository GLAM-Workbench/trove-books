PREFACE.
The following brief outline of the structure and composition
of the primary rocks, and the general geological character of
the Colony of Victoria ?illustrated by explanatory Sections,
and giving all the essential details of the nature of the golden
deposits ?has been prepared with the view of aiding those
who are engaged in making discoveries, and removing many
false impressions with reference to these interesting products
of the Mineral Kingdom. The Sections indicate the apparent
extent of the gold-bearing rocks, the different positions m
which the metal is found, and the system of extraction applied
by the diggers. The productive qualities of the different
rocks in metals, minerals, and gems, and their common aspect,
are explained, as well as many other points necessary for the
guidance of geological explorers.
Since the gold discovery, innumerable pamphlets have
been published in England for English emigrants, with the ,
avowed object of giving instructions to the gold seekers, and
some of these have emanated from quarters whence the most
valuable and authentic scientific and practical explanations
might have been expected ; but they are found totally inap-
plicable, and far from instructive as guides to the gold digger.
All such works are soon laid aside by miners and diggers, like
the numberless patent gold-washing machines sent hither to
be looked at as mere curiosities.


I consider it quite unnecessary to enter into the ordi-
nary properties of gold. Gold diggers need not be told that
yellow mica is not gold, or that yellow iron pyrites is a
mineral. They know well that gold is very heavy, and not
easily carried away by the water in washing off the sand and
clay; and that minerals are capable of being bruised into
powder, whereas a metal like be cut with a knife.
Therefore a very small amount of practical knowledge,
acquired in the gold-fields, is quite sufficient for such pur-
poses. Chemical examination is unnecessary to determine
the quality of gold veins and deposits. Pulverizing and
washing are found near enough for practical purposes. I have
often been able to ascertain the auriferous contents of quartz
and pyrites, within a few pennyweights per ton, by mere
bruising, washing, and looking at the residue. Assays, unless
the samples represent the true average of the entire gold-
bearing rock, are of no avail, however exact they may be* in
themselves; therefore I consider it unnecessary to dwell on
these details in a general sketch like this, which is intended
to give a more comprehensive view of the subject.

CHAP. I
ON THE MERIDIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE PRIMARY ROCKS.
The beautiful geometrical order which is observable in the
structure of the crystalline series, is a phenomenon almost un-
known to those who have only studied Geology through the
medium of books and ordinary lectures. It is m the field alone, j
amidst the gigantic bands of crystalline aggregation, that this
subject can be fully appreciated, or the simplicity and sublime j
order of the Mineral Kingdom be properly understood and
admired. The polarity of minerals causing the cleavage planes o
the primary rocks is not a trifling phenomenon confined to a
mere locality; on the contrary, it is a structure quite indepen-
dent of the direction of secondary chains, their branches, and e
sinuosity of their valleys; in a word, it is a phenomenon pro-
duced by a cause which has acted over the entire surface of our
globe, from the southern extremities of the two hemispheres to
North America and the confines of Europe and Asia. owe ,
for the present object a mere reference to the following conn lies
will be sufficient to show the universality of this men mna
structure.


South America. ?On the eastern flank of the Cordillera
between Chili and the Brazils, the granites, porphyries, and the
clay slates or schists, uniformly run north and south, in vertical
bands. The decomposition of the surface of the gold-bearing
slates interlaminated in the series, and the quartz seams, produce
the gold deposits of that region, both in situ (on the parent
rocks), and in the alluvial accumulations in the valleys and
plains below, which have been worked from time immemorial.
In New Granada the same physical conditions and polarity of
structure are observable across the Andes, from the Pacific
Ocean to the shores of the Atlantic. Again, in Panama,
Veiaguas, and Central America, the primary structure preserves
its general meridional order irrespective of the configuration of
the coast or the undulations of the mountains.
North America. In the states of Virginia, North and
South Carolina, Georgia, up to Canada and Nova Scotia, the
gold and all the primary rocks preserve the same order of
polarity. On the western flank of the great chain of the Sierra
Nevada, throughout the gold region of California, we find the
granites, porphyries, primary slates, &c., running uniformly on
edge in a north and south direction, from the valley of the
Sacramento to the summit of the ridges, on which the gold is
more or less deposited, and is from thence partially carried down
to the ravines?the gold having been produced by the dis-
integration of the quartzose slates, granites, and porphyries.
The whole geological formation of this gold region consists of a
series of clay and mica slates, interlaminated with quartz veins,
also chloride and hornblendic bands, with large ribs of granites and
porphyries bearing north and south, and these are more or less
covered by their own debris, in which the gold is found. The
gold-bearing bands are from thirty to fifty miles in width, and
extending to an indefinite length north and south. The valleys
intersecting these gold-bearing rocks are necessarily rich recep-
tacles, fed by the disintegrated elements of the auriferous
surface. Where the detritus and decomposing surface happen to
be on the elevated flats, and not exposed to much denudation,
the gold is found in situ, i. e., on the edge of the parent rock,
under the gravel, running in small bands north and south, in the
direction of the productive seams below.


Europe and Africa.- The same series of primary rocks,
and polarity of structure, are also observable on the flanks of the
Ural in Russia, and the various ridges of Siberia in Asia, and
likewise from the banks of the river Senegal to the mountains of
Abyssinia in Africa. _ � ~ ?
Australia. ?The phenomenon of the polarity of the pri-
mary structure is so striking in this part of the world that the
most superficial observer cannot help noticing it. Wherever
crystalline slates are exposed to view they are found on edge
n/d bearing north and south, and often continuing without the
least deviation tor hundreds of miles in that direction, but hidden
occasionally by layers of loam, sand, or other description of
sedimentary deposits. The sedimentary formations, which are so
numerous and thick in the northern hemisphere, are exceeding y
limited in the southern portion of Australia, and on y con
to a few patches of sandstone and clay bordering the coast,
hence the difficulty of observing the phenomenon of the, potaty
of the primary rocks in the northern, and the great facility fo
studying it, in flie magnitude of its extent and uniformity in the
southern hemisphere. No geologist who stnct y desmbes the

These primary slates run north and south to an indefinite

When we refer to the accompanying section across the
Colony of Victoria, the vertical and meridional structure of the
primary rocks is so apparent and so extensive, as not to require
further comment; and it is as strongly developed as in the chains
of the Ande* Every gold district in Victoria, where the primary
rocks are visible, exhibits this verticality of the cleavage planes
and polar direction; and I would strongly recommend those who
are engaged in geological pursuits, whether as labourers in the
science, seeking scientific truths, or employed in the field for
useful practical purposes, not to neglect this grand law of the
Mineral Kingdom. Indeed without a proper knowledge of this
phenomenon, taught in an extensive field of observation, it is im-
possible to give a clear, correct, and comprehensive description
of the primary rocks, or to furnish any useful and really practical
hints to those who are engaged in searching for and extracting
the mineral and metallic wealth from the fundamental crystalline
base.*

CHAP. 11.
ON THE GENERAL CHARACTER OP THE PRIMARY CRYSTALLINE
ROCKS, THE GREAT AMOUNT OP WATER WITH WHICH THEY ARB
CHEMICALLY COMBINED IN THEIR NATURAL STATE, AND THEIR
METALLIFEROUS QUALITIES.
The universal fact that first presents itself to our notice
when we examine these crystalline compounds is, that they con-
tain a very large proportion of water, chemically combined, and
are often found in depth as soft as clay. The superficial parts of
these rocks are the hardest and driest portions of the series. In
mines, and subterranean caverns in the primary rocks, mineral
springs and solutions, and the production of various crystals, are
as constant as the growth of vegetation; and these are found
forming according to the strength of the solvents and the
electro-chemical action present. The same composition always
crystallizes in the same geometrical form, unless the conditions
of the compound are altered. The animal and vegetable tribes
cease to continue the functions of life, and a complete disorgani-
zation takes place during their final decomposition. Their
respective laws of organization may be destroyed in embryo
by the crushing of the egg or bruising of the seed; but this is
not the case in the Mineral Kingdom-the crystals, being the
result of a constantly-acting principle, will appear again in a
their perfection, however often their elements may have been
separated. Nothing can destroy the active and reproductive
principles of the Mineral Kingdom. In the deep recesses of the
crystalline film the subtle power of polarity is present, constantly
permeating beneath the scene of vegetable and animal life, and a
never-ending process is going on, giving form to mineral matter
in all its variety, from the formation of a crystal to the aggre-
gation of crystals which constitute a continent. This continuous


electro-polar action, which causes the structure described in the
preceding chapter, is a powerful agent in modifying the physical
conditions of the surface, by its constant process of decomposing
and reproducing.
Those who fancy that there is some foundation for the
supposed igneous origin of the primary rocks should study the
subject more carefully. They will find that it is extremely
difficult to produce metallic crystals from fusion, much less
minerals, and those that are imperfectly formed are produced
when in the act of cooling and during very slow sublimation.
The siliceous, calcareous, aluminous crystals and salts, together
with other products of the Mineral Kingdom, are not only
daily formed in nature from aqueous solutions, but all substances
can be crystallized in the moist way by artificial means, but not
by fusion. The crystals of the primary rocks could not he
imitated by fusion under the most favourable circumstances?
their aqueous components and the pyramidal termination of
some of the siliceous crystals render such an assumption totally
inadmissible. The rocks called ancient lava, such as basalt,
greenstone trap, and other varieties of the hornblende series,
together with the isolated aggregation of ferruginous sands and
clays and vesicular masses often seen on the surface, are of the
aqueous compound, and have no more to do with the effects of
fire than the production of the rust on iron when exposed to the
changes of the weather. All the rocks, the most solid and
compact, lose a large portion of their weight when exposed to a
strong heat, and many decrepitate ; the weight thus lost is mere
water. Heat is often employed to expedite the process of crys-
tallization in artificial works ; hut it is not essential for the for-
mation of the crystal?the latter is formed much more perfectly,
crystallized by the slow action of natural operation. When
crystals form they combine with and retain a portion of the
liquid, not mechanically, but as an essential component, to which
their regularity of figure, their colour and transparency, are in
many instances referrible. Zeolytes lose from sto 18 per cent,
of water by heating; compound spar, about 40 per cent.; opals,
from 6to 18 per cent. ; schorl, from 7to 15 per cent.; Brazilian
topaz, 20 per cent.; common flint, 5 per cent.; red quartz, 3 per
cent.; felspar, from 3to 10 per cent. Indeed there is scarcely a


substance seen in the Mineral Kingdom but what is either
found in solution, or may be dissolved and recrystallized from
an aqueous alkaline menstruum. Quartz is not only found in
solution, but is easily dissolved in caustic alkali, and may be
obtained like glue, perfectly transparent, and possessing the
plastic properties of clay. According to the above observations,
which are founded on facts, the Mineral Kingdom, and the con-
stant changes which are going on in the rocks below, are more
under the influence of water than fire. The former is a com-
pound of elements in a quiescent state, whereas the latter is a
mere effect produced daring decomposition. Those who are so
fond of attributing every conical peak, inverted hollow cone, and
oxidated mass, to the effects of an incandescent eruption, should
reflect well on the above natural truths. There are about 175
active points called volcanoes, and only six of them which
become occasionally in a state of incandescence, producing lava
from the melted rocks. The majority of them are mere gigantic
mineral springs and muddy erruptions, and I would recommend
those who feel reluctant to abandon the untenable doctrine of
igneous rocks, to examine the characters of such volcanoes,
aqueous, gaseous, or igneous, as may be found within the limits
of their observation. It is said that the Colony of Victoria
contains many. To what class do they belong?
Felspar in general constitutes by far the largest part of
the granites and clay slates, and is the active agent of decompo-
sition; owing to its alkaline character, it is the principal agent by
which the silicates or compounds of quartz and metals are separated
in the laboratory of nature. The felspathic varieties of rocks are
found the richest for minerals in every part of the world. In
Chili, Peru, New Granada, Central America, Canada, and Nor-
way, metallic silver and copper are frequently found in the cleav-
age of the micaceous slate and laminated granite. I have also
seen flakes of gold in the clay-slates of South America, as well as
in the quartz. I have seen a large amount of crystalline efflor-
escence formed on the walls of ancient mines, and on the rocks
broken therefrom, and in the rubbish within, composed of iron
and gold, sufficiently rich to pay for re-working ; thus shewing
that the minerals and the metals in nature are, like the vegetable
kingdom, moist, and in a constant state of activity. Although


tbs action is invisible to those whose attention is confined to the
surface, and so slow as not to be perceptible, it is, nevertheless,
sufficiently active to provide for the wants of all generations,'
constantly forming and producing abundant minerals and metals
to supply the requirements of all ages.

which tend to produce these conditions, we have


gold or copper. On examination we find, if the battery possesses
but feeble power, crystalline metal will be deposited; if, how-
ever, we dilute this solution with twice, thrice, or four times its
bulk of water, the metallic deposit will assume a very different
aspect; it will then be aggregated in a flexible reguline deposit.
If this solution be further diluted, the metal will be deposited in
a fine dark powder. The experiment will show nearly the same
result m all kinds of metallic solutions. The above variable state
in which metals and minerals are produced by the battery is of
common occurrence in mineral veins and metalliferous deposits.
the current be very intense, causing the evolution of the hydro-
gen from the negative plate, it forms very fine dark powder un-
consolidated like sand, but if none evolves, the metal is generally
ormed in a crystalline state. Comparing these few experimental
tacts with those actually observed in our rocks, we find such a
striking coincidence as to compel us to conclude that the laws
and actions are identical, and in conformity to other operations
in the economy of nature.


CHAP. IV.
ON THE PRODUCTION OF GOLD, PLATINUM, THE OXIDE OF TIN,
ETC., ON THE SURFACE OP THE PRIMARY ROCKS, DURING
DECOMPOSITION.
Gold, platina, and other metals not subject to oxidation, are
principally found in the disintegrated surface of the metalliferous
crystalline rocks, such as granites, porphyries, and their respec-
tive slates. These metallic productions depend entirely on the
composition and structure of the rocks, and the chemical and
mechanical conditions of the surface, causing oxidation, disin-
tegration, and the consequent development and aggregation of
the containing metals.
The superficial productions, of gold and platina especially,
far exceed the product from veins, and are much purer in qua-
lity. Metals formed in mineral veins contain a large proportion
of alloy, whereas those found in deposits are comparatively free
from the baser metals, the latter being destroyed by the process
of oxidation. The rocks containing the precious metals and the
oxide of tin are much subject to superficial decomposition, and
thus their metallic contents .are liberated by a slow natural
process. This action is more or less constant in every region on
the face of the earth, hut in variable degrees, according to local
conditions, depending on the crystalline compounds and physical
operations, confined to no age, nor to any particular zone, and
totally independent of the character of the superincumbent fossil-
liferous beds which may be found in the districts.


I wish particularly to press this point on those who have
a desire to study the subject, so that they may estimate the real
value of the arguments which have been brought forward with
reference to the alleged discovery of gold deposits in Australia,
founded on palaeozoic data, or predictions grounded on fossilliferous
rocks. A knowledge of the meaning and leading hearings of
fossils is very important in connexion with sedimentary rocks, but
it is totally unavailable in all questions connected with the primary
rocks, and their containing metals and minerals. To state that
? gold is deposited in the newest tertiaries, or in connexion with
paleozoic rocks,? can have no definite meaning, and much less
any practical bearing on the subject. The less the primary series
are covered with sedimentary rocks, the more easily their
character can be determined; should they be the metalliferous,
or auriferous variety (which can only be determined by minera-
logical examination), and more or less decomposed and covered
by their quartzose debris, we have reason to expect gold deposits.
These superficial disintegrations are incessantly increasing the
thickness of the sands, clays, and pebbles. This change is con-
fined to no age, nor any given period in the history of the sedi-
mentary rocks; neither do such accumulations enclose fossils or
any organic substance by which the fossil geologist can deter-
mine their metallic qualities. Every gold digger knows well
that the description of fossilliferous rocks, with all the erudition
on the organic remains and the sequence of the beds on the one
hand, and the hypothetical igneous rocks on the other, avail
nothing, but rather tend to embarrass and bewilder those who
have not studied the primary rocks and their deposits in the field
of operation. It is this misinterpretation of natural phenomena,
and the consequent misapplication of the laws governing the
products of the Mineral Kingdom, that have brought the science
of Geology into disrepute and diggers.
The auriferous clay and mica slates generally enclose
nodules and veins of white and light red quartz, as described in
the accompanying Sections. These gold quartz veins are ex-
tremely deceptive to the uninitiated: being frequently found
glittering with gold on the surface, with occasional large masses
in cavities, and large flakes in the joints and fractions; yet at a
few fathoms in depth, in the compact quartz, they seldom pro-


duce sufficient gold to pay the cost of the mere blasting of the
rock. Yet these quartz veins contain a small proportion of gold
below, although invisible, which, when left to the natural pro-
cesses of decomposition and internal metallic aggregation,
produce rich superficial debris. A very interesting result, in
connection with this superficial action and the liberation and
aggregation of the precious metals from the containing rocks,
may be seen at the roots of great trees when in immediate con-
tact with quartzose bands?(see Section 2). Huntsmen and
herdsmen have been the discoverers of many of the silver mines
in South America, especially in Chili and Peru, by detecting
large masses of metallic silver attached to the roots of trees, and
sometimes growing in a somewhat arborescent form amongst the
scrub. The same kind of discoveries have been made in gold
regions, not alone in South America, Veraguas, and California, but
also in Victoria and New South Wales?large masses of gold
have been found aggregated near the roots of large trees and
strong grass, often in very singular forms, and evidently
indicating the influence of the roots in the formation and the
amount of gold drawn out of the rock below. I particularly
refer to those parts undisturbed by floods, where the gold is
found in situ, and not to the accumulations of gold occasioned by
masses of roots in valleys and other mechanical obstacles to the
running streams. The two effects are quite distinct I have
also seen gold formed on, and in the cavities of rocks, like small
ferns, presenting all the appearance of vegetable or coral growth,
with?this distinction, that instead of the fibrous branches and
leaves, the structure of the branches was of a crystalline charac-
ter. Hence, with these facts before us, we cannot refuse to
acknowledge the existence of this action in the minerals below,
even though the effect produced may be so slow as not to be
sensible during the life of an individual. The action of water,
as shewn in the second chapter, is so much connected with that
of oxygen, hydrogen, and of carbonic acid, that it is scarcely
possible to consider their effects apart in the crystalline rocks.
Before we can duly understand how the precious metals become
developed in masses near the roots of trees, we must know the
general character and state of the rocks and soil in situ. All
substances found in nature are capable of being held in aqueous


solutions, and are often found in that state. Gold is held in a
solution of caustic alkali, and sometimes saturating the quartz
and the cleavage of the slate. Silver is kept in solution by sul-
phate of iron. Caustic potash is also the natural menstruum of
siliceous substances. The hornblende and clay slates contain as
an ingredient protoxide of iron, and when they absorb the rain
or surface moisture, this oxide combines with the oxygen of the
water and liberates the hydrogen gas, which is a most active
agent in the production of metals in rocks, as well as on the
negative plate of an artificial battery. The above combined
protoxide becomes thus a peroxide of iron, and thus converts the
hard surfaces of these rocks into a friable brownish-red soil,
leaving at the bottom the substances unaffected by the changes.
Rocks in general are more or less ferruginous, and the salts of iron
lose their coherence on exposure to air, and crumble into powder
by the absorption of oxygen. Thus the disintegration of most
of the crystalline compounds is effected, owing to their ingre-
dients being susceptible of entering into union with oxygen: the
precious metals are gathered together, and the metallic sulphu-
rets transformed into soluble sulphates. Nearly all the primary
clay-slates consist of compounds of silica, alumina, potash, soda,
iron, and often magnesia and protoxide of manganese, with the
metals sparingly disseminated therein. Quartz decomposes by
the continuous action of a weak solution of carbonic acid, and
liberates its containing metals. The pipe clay is a silicate of
alumina, produced by the decomposition of the quartz and
felspar, and the potash washed out. What is vulgarly called
?burnt quartz,? is a conglomerate of the debris cemented
together by the solutions of the oxides of iron and silica. Indeed
all rocks containing silicates of alkaline bases, especially when
ferruginous, are incapable of resisting the continued solvent
action of carbonic acid dissolved in water, or the sucking action
of the roots of trees supplied with carbonaceous matter in a
moist state. Thus carbonate of soda is a most important sub-
stance to sprinkle in a poor soil to liberate the elements of the
crystalline rocks to feed the roots of plants: the required
nourishment is thus absorbed from the soil, and the metals and
other ingredients rejected by the roots are left behind like indi-
gestible substances. The metals in the primary rocks being


more or less in a semi-fluid state and combined with other
elements, especially the alkalies, remain in that state until dis-
turbed by neutralising agents, i. e., like the roots of plants,
taking up the potash and leaving the gold behind at the points
of separation, in masses, according to the richness of the ground
and the amount of alkali taken up by the trunk. In the same
manner the ferruginous rocks forming red caps on hills by the
decomposition of the iron, are favourable for the liberation and
development of the gold contained in auriferous slates. Hence the
red hills are favourable localities to the gold digger. It is scarcely
necessary to state that all the sands and clay, pure or mixed with
minerals and metals, are the result of decomposition, and are
subject to constant changes, and these changes not only perpetu-
ally liberate and develope the metals, but render the alkaline
bases and silicates soluble, to provide food for the vegetable
kingdom.
If we bruise, pulverise, and wash the most compact quartz
in the auriferous slates, we may detect gold in an impalpable
state ; in fact, it is frequently found as a component part of this
rock, imperceptibly disseminated therein. However, it is in the
small fissures and vacuities of the oxidated portions, that we find
the grain and massive gold. The superficial parts, commonly
called ? burnt and rotten quartz,? are the productive portions of
quartz veins?(see Section 2). Some quartz veins, impregnated
with iron pyrites?the latter decomposed into the peroxide, and
forming patches and cavities below the surface ?do produce rich
pockets of gold occasionally, but they are very rare and never
productive in quantity. The only gold veins worthy of notice,
and capable of affording an average remunerative product, are the
ferruginous or the auriferous pyrites, which are being worked
with great profit in the Brazils and New Granada. The gold
quartz veins seen in these Colonies are similar in character to
those examined in other countries ; the product of gold depend-
ing entirely on the amount of the oxidating surfaces, including
the cavities and joints. Some of them have been more or less
wrought near Mount Alexander, and have produced, as usual,
mere specimens; but their exploration in depth has been for very
good reasons relinquished. The gold-seeker finds it much more
profitable to work in the superficial debris , and seek the superior


and productive masses found on the quartz under the debris,
like those extraordinary metallic masses found at Balaarat.
A very interesting natural process of the development
of gold from the granite may be observed in various portions of
granitic ranges in all auriferous districts. I have frequently
examined and watched this phenomenon in several parts of the
Andes ?particularly on the hanks of the Rio Negro and on the
Isthmus of Panama. All the granites subject to decompose on
the surface in spherical exfoliation show this effect in a remark-
able manner. In examining a deep section of this kind of granite
we find the crystalline aggregation passing by an almost imper-
ceptible gradation into a concretionary globular structure, and
changing into the character of a coarse conglomerate on
approaching the surface; the respective nucleus of each crys-
talline ball, or centre of attraction, becoming denser and harder
than the parent rock by the gradual concentration of surrounding
silica, like the formation of flints in chalk, or silicate of lime.
During this process of transformation of the crystalline base we
find the spherical nodules towards the surface getting gradually
enveloped by a series of concentric exfoliations. In the divisions
of these spheres an efflorescence of ferruginous mineral is formed,
in which the gold becomes aggregated into grains. The above
compact round crystalline balls are called by the natives of South
America ? madres,? or the mothers of the gold, because they
haye found from experience that the debris of granite are not
productive of gold without them. The stony nuclei, as well as
the concentric exfolia, are completely deprived of their original
auriferous contents by this process of internal aggregation. After
these oxidated surfaces of the granites are brought down by the
torrents, and washed away from the foot or the ravines of such
mountains, the gold washers must remove to other localities, or
wait a few years until the slow process of Nature supplies them
with a fresh crop and accumulation, as they know that it would
be in vain to penetrate into the hard rock to extract its metallic
contents. The granite rocks do not produce large masses of
gold like the quartz and slate ; the precious metal resulting from
the decomposition of granites and porphyries is generally in
small flakes and minute grains, and principally found in remu-
nerative quantities in alluvial deposits, and seldom found in situ


like the slaty rocks. We may have a familiar illustration of the
above modus operandum going on in the Mineral Kingdom by
referring to the action of a plant, or the conducting power of tho
root in the soil. The seed, with its active principle, being tho
fixed point, causes activity in the surrounding moist elements ;
the plant increases in bulk, and becomes more powerful in pro-
portion to its development, until tho required elements are
abstracted from the soil and demand replenishing for the growth.
So it is with crystals ?they cause local attraction of similar
elements, and however slow and feeble this process may appear,
yet it becomes by degrees very powerful from the combination of
their respective cohesive forces, and especially if a solution of
carbonic acid and iron bo present. The different elements, after,
separation, will cause new combinations and arrangements till
they arrive at a comparatively quiescent state ; the whole of the
metallic contents of the rocks in proximity being abstracted stop
further accumulation. This is the case in many metalliferous
portions of the primary series ; they become inert like exhausted
soils, having all their nutritious elements drawn out. I have
found granites, porphyries, and clay slates, containing from one
to two dwts. of gold per ton, without the least apparent trace of
the metal to bo seen by mere inspection. When these rocks
decompose they necessarily liberate the metal, and this becomes
aggregated at various points, or precipitated according to. local
conditions, as observed in all the gold deposits. It may be well
to remind the reader that gold is never mineralized ; it is always
found in its metallic state ; therefore, gold ores or minerals are
improper terms. However, it is frequently found mechanically
combined with iron pyrites, and also alloyed with other metals.
I have already referred to the great purity of the gold
found in superficial deposits in rocks comparatively barren of
minerals, while the gold obtained from veins and in association
with minerals is always considerably below standard. It has
been stated that this arises from the effects of oxidation carrying
away the baser metals during the process of aggregation. I
shall now notice a very interesting fact respecting this action,
observed by me in some of the gold mines on the Andes. The
auriferous pyrites in that region contain from 5 dwts. to 3 ozs,
per ton, according to the depth. This pyrites is stamped into.


fine powder, and the gold extracted therefrom by washing and
various mechanical means ; the resulting product is a compound
of gold and silver, two of the former and one of the latter, called
electrum. This is the state in which all the gold is obtained
from the mine direct. The residue of the washing is a fine
pulverized pyrites, with all the free gold washed out, but by
assay still indicating the same contents of gold, bulk for bulk, as
the original mineral in its rough state. This product from the
washing is laid aside in great heaps, which in a few months are
decomposed, and free gold becomes not only visible, but also in
grains, rendering it profitable for re-washing, until the entire
heaps of pyrites are completely decomposed. Again, not alone
is the gold thus developed, but its quality is much purer?
a large proportion of the silver having disappeared. This is
easily explained. The pyrites (sulphuret of iron) soon decom-
poses when exposed to moisture and the heat of the sun?the
sulphuret is converted into a sulphate which is soluble ?and this
solution dissolves the silver during the gradual aggregation of
the golden particles. It is this action that has led the gold
washers of South America to'believe that the metal grew in the
residue, as they always found that by preserving such refuse for
a long time fresh crops of gold could be obtained.
Such are a few of the instances brought forward to show
that the products of the Mineral Kingdom are governed by laws
as beautiful and as constant as those controlling the Vegetable
world. The products of the rocks depend on their quality and
the intensity of the local chemical and mechanical actions, or the
amount of disintegration on the surface. This subject is fully
explained and illustrated in my work ? On Geology and Mag-
netism,? and is much too comprehensive to enter into in this
brief outline.


CHAP. V.
GOLD DEPOSITS.
The Colony presents fine examples of rich and extensive gold
deposits formed on the parent rocks, and a few real alluvial
deposits in valleys. Sections Nos. 2 and 3 show their general
character; on reference to which it will he observed that gold is
found firstly, on the surface of the bare rocks; secondly,
aggregated often at the roots of trees; thirdly, slightly covered
by clay, sand, and gravel; fourthly, under thick layers of
detritus, and in sizes varying from five grains to great masses,
resting and mixing on the hard edges of the slate and quartz ;
and fifthly, in the alluvial plains below. These are the different
conditions in which the gold is found, and will account for the
easy manner in which it is obtained in some places, and the hard
and deep sinking at others. Many parts may be exhausted as
rapidly as potatoe fields, and produce a large quantity of go
for a limited period, by means of a great number of diggers
spread over the surface, while other deposits are so deep, and
require so much sinking, like some parts in Balaarat, as to render
the operation as tedious as mining.
It will be observed that whatever number of layers may
be found in sinking through the superficial covering, such as
pipe clay, ferruginous conglomerate, and other seams, it is always
necessary to sink down to the very bottom, i. to the primary
rock, to prove the real value of the deposit. The decomposed
covering varies occasionally in appearance. In many parts o
Bendigo and Forest Creek it is composed of clay of various
colours, from pure white to yellow and red. The gold is some-
times found attached to masses of brown iron stone, and again
dispersed through the whole of the layers, commencing imme-


diately under the soil and increasing in quantity towards the
bottom. In some localities the covering is upwards of 100 feet
deep, consisting of dark loam, sand, gravel, clay, and ferruginous
conglomerate, with occasional loose masses of slate rocks and
quartz, and many pits are sunk without producing much gold;
whilst a few others drop large masses enclosed in the fractures
of the upper edges of the quartz bands and quartz nodules. It
is most essential to study well the geological structure and the
direction of the gold-bearing rocks, in connection with the
superficial configuration of the country, before sinking many
deep holes in such localities. In real alluvial deposits?that is,
those which have accumulated by means of streams carrying the
sand pebbles and the gold from the surfaces of the parent rocks
to the valleys?the rich parts ;�o not depend on the quality of
the rocks forming the base fflr*such deposits. The favourable
productive parts are necessarily found at the points presenting
the greatest resistance to the stream, such as ledges of rocks�
boulders, hollows in the bed, and the bends of the channel?
However, when such channels, creeks, or rivers, intersect gold-
bearing rocks transversely to the cleavage, it follows as a matter
of course that the deposits depend on two distinct causes, and
thus produce much greater enrichment. It is extremely inte-
resting to observe occasionally distinct gold-bearing bands,
running like gigantic ribbons for miles in a north and south
direction, traversing hills, valleys, and gullies, intersecting bends
0 rivers, without the slightest deviation in their meridional
course, and only varying in the product according to the hard-
ness, softness, and other local causes by which the development
of the precious metal is influenced. These gold-bearing bands
with their parallel unproductive bands, may be seen in Forest
Creek and its neighbouring creeks and gullies. The variable
productive rocks, with their superficial decomposed caps forming
white and red hills, from the silicate of alumina and potash, and
the ferruginous sand and clay already noticed, may be also seen
in Forest Creek and Bendigo, where they can be well studied.
Ihe felspathic granite commonly produces white pipe clay, & c .
at its flanks; but the gold thus obtained from the granite, in the
absence of slate, is of fine grain, and generally disseminated
through the clay.


CHAP. VI.
A BRIEF OUTLINE OP THE GEOLOGY OP VICTORIA AND NEW SOUTH
WALES, FOUNDED ON VARIOUS OBSERVATIONS ILLUSTRATED IN
SECTIONS, NOS. 1 AND 4, TRANSVERSELY TO THE MERIDIONAL
STRUCTURE.
Having in the first chapter described the phenomenon of the
polarity of cleavage, I will not enter further into this question,
hut simply give a description of the general character of the
series from west to east. There are no correct maps obtainable,
hut the accompanying illustrations are sufficiently near the truth
to serve the present purpose. Commencing at the river Glenelg,
near the western boundary of this Colony, we find that the
formation consists of sedimentary limestone, deposited on sand-
stone ; and these beds lap on the western flank of the Grampians.
The latter appear more or less granitic as far as the Pyrenees,
where the formation changes into meridional hands, and masses
of hornblende rocks, commonly called basalt ?(see Section No.
1). From the eastern flank of the Pyrenees, in the valley of
the Loddon, to the western declivity of Mount Alexander, the
auriferous clay-slates and quartz predominate, and are found
more or less productive in gold along their geneial meiidional
hearings, from the south of Balaarat and its neighbourhood to
the north of Bendigo and Korong. This great gold hand
appears to he the richest and the most extensive yet discovered
in Victoria. This meridional range is several miles in width,
consisting of a series of hands interlaminated with barren rocks.
Although this range is more or less auriferous throughout, yet
there are extensive barren spots on it, as well as rich localities,
depending on local conditions. I may also observe that many
ridges, such as the Jim Crow, and others, intersect this great


gold-bearing range, thus causing breaks, as it were, in the
continuity of its productive qualities. These variations are
observed locally as well as generally, irrespective of the quality
of the gold-bearing ground, and are dependent on the physical
conditions already explained.
It has been shown in the preceding chapters that the
bruised and decomposed surface of these clay slates and quartz
has produced the superincumbent beds of gravel and clay, with
the gold on the surface of the present rocks, and also supplying
the ravines and rivers with alluvial deposits. The gold is, as
already stated, occasionally found near the surface of the soil,
diffused through the clay and gravel; sometimes it lies princi-
pally below on the hard rock, in large masses, at various depths,
as described in Sections 2 and 3. Seams of pipe clay are found
in Balaarat, Mount Alexander district, and Bendigo, and are
often productive of fine gold, as well as the washing-stuff under-
neath. These white-clay beds are found in many of the gold
fields at every intermediate depth, and require in all localities to
be penetrated to the hard rock below to prove the value of the
ground. Interstratified with such seams are found also beds of
hard and red concrete of quartz and slate pebbles, which render
it troublesome to sink. These different conditions depend on
the causes dwelt on in the preceding chapters.
The deposits formed in the valleys by the detritus carried
down by floods are necessarily different, and are principally sand
and pebbles with small grain gold, but gradually increase in size
as we ascend and approach the source of supply, the large lumps
being always found on or near the parent rocks. These alluvial
deposits are, comparatively speaking, the exceptions in this
Colony, the gold being principally found in situ, in the debris of
the parent rock: hence, extensive auriferous sands in river
banks, or in alluvial plains of the low lands, are apparently
wanting, probably owing to the absence of great rivers and high
water sheds to supply them. Even the gullies intersecting the
flanks appear to be formed more from the softness and slow
decomposition of the rocks than the actual wearing of running
streams. The creeks and gullies running east and west, and
consequently across the slate, are generally richer than those
running north and south, in the direction of the cleavage, unless


the latter happens to be on a rich band. In sinking through the
debris in situ down to the rock, should it be found barren, the
? digger? drives to the east or the west, so as to intersect the
neighbouring bands, and when a productive one is discovered, as
it often happens, he works on it to the north and south along its
general bearing, as far as he may be allowed to go?(see Section
2). This is a very important principle to guide the diggers in
search of gold in situ , and will enable them often to judge the
whereabouts of the main rich bands, although thickly covered,
and will also direct them in the selection of spots for sinking,
when other portions of a locality are known. In the alluvial
deposits different rules must be applied, and founded on the
mechanical effects described in the preceding chapter. To the
south, in the Balaarat district, the auriferous rocks consist of
variegated clay slates, with hornblende and quartz veins inter-
laminated ; and these rocks run north and south, and with slight
interruptions, to the neighbourhood of Korong. The various
rich gullies, and the quartz veins in the narrow gullies, which
have produced the late extraordinary masses of gold, are within
this southern portion of the great band in question. Parallel to
this, and somewhat united on the east, is the Loddon, Camp-
bell?s, Fryer?s, and Forest Creeks? great band, which continues
in its course to the north of Bendigo, and is bounded on the east
by Mount Alexander granite. Clay slates on edge, running
north and south, and covered with small white quartz, iron
stone, and broken slate, ia the general aspect or superficial
appearance of all the gold districts ; therefore the same descnp-
tion serves.
Mount Alexander is a high but short granitic chain or
ridge, which is only slightly auriferous. Farther eastward,
towards the river Campaspe, another meridional band of slates is
visible, and is found more or less auriferous, in which are the
M?lvor diggings ?(see the great Section, No. 1). Between these
slates and the river Goulburn is a ferruginous granite and horn-
blende. The surface of these crystalline series is covered by
isolated masses of red and brown rocks, with clay and sand
reconsolidatcd into hard vesicular masses by the action of gases
and ferruginous matter, thus giving rise to the mistaken notion
of their being scoria}, produced by some imaginary volcanoes,


and the neighbouring peaks by a little theoretical embellishment
converted into ancient craters, to explain effects which we can
daily see going on before our eyes. The next in order is the
series of clay-slates, quartz, and granite veins of the Goulburn
meridional range, which is also found more or less auriferous.
Passing eastward we come to another band of granite extending
in width to the Broken river; from this river to the Ovens the
formation consists of ribs of granite, quartz veins, and clay-
slates, in conformity with the preceding series, i. e., on edge, and
running north and south. This formation is auriferous to the
flanks of the great Australian Alps, which is the next great band
in the series, and shown in the Section. This granitic chain is
found somewhat stanniferous, containing schorl and tin near the
Ovens, and is also auriferous in the valley of Mitta Mitta. The
distinction between the products of granites and slates has been
explained; and, as the oxide of tin resulting from the schorla-
ceous portions of the granite during decomposition is accumu-
lated in the manner already described, it is unnecessary to enter
further into the subject. On the eastern flank of the Australian
Alps rests the great sedimentary sandstone of this coast, extend-
ing from the south to the north of Moreton Bay, the western
part forming the Blue Mountain Chain, as shown in Section, No.
4. It is in this sedimentary sandstone that the Sydney coal
seams are found, and various thin layers of the same substance in
different parts of the Pacific coast. Such is the general character
of the primary rocks of Victoria: the northern part in the
valley of the Hume and the Murray being covered over by a
great thickness of loam and gravel, and on the south, along the
coast, irregularly lapped by arenaceous and argillaceous beds, en-
closing in some parts thin seams of coal and carbonaceous matter
with beds of lime.
On reference to the New South Wales Section, No. 4,
(which is on the same scale as the Victoria Section,) we find that
the auriferous rocks are of a similar character in meridional
structure and composition. The auriferous bands in New South
are very limited transversely, as compared to those of
Victoria, but the ranges have a much greater extension in north
and south direction, which must be duly considered in making
comparisons. The Summer Hill Creek produces gold from the

slate alone, but the upper part of the Turon appears to contain
alluvial gold from the intersecting granite. I beg reference to
the accompanying Section for further particulars on this head.
The north and south extension of the respective bands are not
yet ascertained.


CHAP. VII.
A FEW WORDS ON THE QUESTION OF FINDING DIAMONDS IN THE
AUSTRALIAN FORMATION.
These precious crystals are found principally in India and the
Brazils, in the detritus of quartz, more or less transparent, mixed
with fragments of mica, talcose slate, and brown iron. A
few crystals have been detected attached to the brown carbonates
and arseniates of iron, within drusy cavities filled with a substance
of a greenish hue, but very rarely found in the parent rock.
However, judging from the general character of the detritus in
which these gems are obtained, the primary geological formation
appears to be micaceous, and talcose laminated quartz and schist,
enclosing bands of brown iron ore and iron glance, in a highly
crystalline state. The debris of this slaty compound forms
deposits of friable and solid conglomerates, consisting chiefly of
ferruginous sand, enclosing fragments of yellow, bluish, and
transparent masses of quartz, in large and perfect crystals, schis-
tose jasper, amethyst, and grains of gold. Diamonds are rarely
found directly, even in searching the richest spots, because they
are generally enclosed in an earthy brown substance, or ferru-
ginous matter, which must be removed before they can be seen.
All diamond districts produce gold, and the gem is found under
similar circumstances in the deposits; but all gold districts do
not produce diamonds, although diamond deposits produce gold.
The diamond requires a different compound with carbon as well
as silica as an element, and is subject to a more perfect crystalline
action amongst the component ingredients. Such deposits contain
transparent pebbles and many precious crystals. In seeking for
diamonds it is necessary to have some knowledge of the laws of


crystallization. Minerals vary in form like the vegetable pro*
ductions, and we can determine what they are by their primary
shape. We have already seen and recognized in the great crys-
talline masses of the earth the action of polarity and chemical
affinity, giving to such rocks a general polar grain; so it is with
the individual crystals ?they are found in a definite and invari-
able form and composition. Quartz produces glittering and trans-
parent crystals if the crystalline action be slow, and these are
sometimes mistaken for diamonds by those who are not acquainted
with the subject. To avoid such mistakes it is only necessary
to state that diamonds never assume the form of a six-sided
prism, with six-sided pyramids at its ends, like quartz. The
crystals of diamonds are eight-sided?two four-sided pyramids
joined base to base, and frequently covered by a white and green
crust. It would be very imprudent to encourage the search for
mere diamonds alone, yet in connection with other products,
which may be more or less depended upon, it would be well not
to forget occasional examination in the districts containing the
above description of primary slates with perfect crystals. There
are localities which might be noticed, but it is not advisable to
do so at present. The diamond districts present a greater
amount of misery than the old gold-washing localities of America
and Africa.
It is difficult to conceive how scientific men should en-
courage the erroneous notion so prevalent respecting the vegeta-
ble origin of the diamond, when this gem is found crystallized
amongst other minerals in the primary rocks. The mere fact of
its being pure carbon is synonymous to quartz crystal being
silicon, and can have no reference to other compounds of carbon.
It is often loosely stated that it is a mere crystallized charcoal or
coke. These comparisons necessarily lead to incorrect ideas
respecting the origin of the diamond. We have already observed
that it is a pure crystal derived from the element of carbon in its
primary state, like all other crystals produced from the primary
elementary solutions in the fundamental base. We may as well
call a crystalline phosphate of lime, hone, or carbonate of lime,
shell, as to call a diamond a crystal of charcoal. The diamonds,
as stated above, are found like garnets, and other gems, in the
primary detritus, and not produced by means of the transforma-
D 2


tion through the medium of vegetation, as such comparisons lead
persons to infer. It is stated that diamonds have been detected
in the debris of the micaceous schist of New South Wales, and
that specimens have been sent to London. If this be a fact, it
will be very interesting to examine the locality in which they
were found.

CHAP. VIII.
THE COAL FORMATION OF VICTORIA.
As there has been so much said of late, in reference to the
discovery of available coal in Victoria, a few words on this
question may not be considered irrelevant. Coal seams are
formed in the secondary or sedimentary series, and the quantity
and quality depend on the period and extent of their develop-
ment. Hence it follows that countries barren of sedimentary
rocks can have no crystalline and available coal; whereas the
regions where such rocks are formed may contain this important
substance. The greatest coal fields are seen in the northern
hemisphere Europe and America; moderately within the
tropics, in the east and the west; and in a lesser degree in the
southern hemisphere.
It has already been stated that the sedimentary rocks of
Victoria are limited to the southern coast, with the exception of
the shingle and loam in the northern boundary; therefore, should
coal be found in this Colony, of any importance, it will be
discovered in the south formation. Several thin seams have
been described as seen in Western Port, Cape Otway, and in
various parts between Geelong and Portland; showing that if
any thick and workable coal exists it must be here, and can be
i easily detected by boring, inasmuch as the formation is compara-
tively soft, and only thinly developed as a coal formation. This
sedimentary clay-slate is deposited on the undulating surface of
the primary rocks, and only partially consolidated, and very
little affected by the ordinary ? faults.? Limestone formation
appears to have much influence in coal deposits. I have found
invariably that the coal seams of the calcareous basins were more


extensive, more uniform, and of better quality, than the seams
enclosed in the clay and arenaceous sedimentary rocks, without
calcareous beds. Those who seek for coal in this Colony must
not be guided by the great formations of England, but take those
of Van Diemen?s Land and New South Wales as the types.
Although fossils are of important assistance in deter-
mining on such formations in Europe, they are of little avail
here; and as the sedimentary rocks are so slight in this Colony,
the search for organic remains is unnecessary, as any important
seams which may exist are easily discovered. Numerous small
seams of coals are found in sandstones ?and clays, formed from
carbonaceous matter in solution, and crystallized in the sub-
division of the beds during consolidation, like water freezing in
joints. Therefore it must not be supposed that all the coal
seams are mere compressed wood, or decomposed vegetation.
Fern trees are the characteristic fossil flora of the principal coal
fields of the world, yet these impressions may be seen in many
formations of this division without coal being formed in any
available quantities. It is to be hoped that these few hints may
prove of some service to those who are looking for workable
coal seams in this Colony.

CHAP. IX.
MINES, OR MINERAL VEINS.
Much confusion is caused from the loose manner in which the
terms, mines, veins, lodes, &c,, are applied. These appellations
are often given to almost any kind of mineral or metalliferous
deposit in which the operation of extraction is carried on, how-
ever widely they may differ in character from the definition of
these terms in the ordinary mining sense. Mineral veins, in
which the system of mining is applied, are great vertical frac-
tures or joints, filled with mineral or the aggregation of metal-
liferous compounds, enclosed in compact and solid rocks. The
primary rocks most productive of metalliferous veins are the
felspathic granites and their superincumbent exfoliations, called
clay rocks; also the laminated granites (gneiss) and the mica-
ceous schists. There are likewise most important lead veins in
the sedimentary limestones. These internal productions of the
Mineral Kingdom are very different to the metallic deposits
alluded to in the preceding chapters, and require to be kept as
distinct as any other division in the economy of terrestrial physics.
Soon after my arrival in this Colony, after inspecting the gold
regions, and referring to all the reports received from the
different districts, I was led to the conclusion that it was not a
mining country ?that is, that the geological character of the
Colony, as far as it has been examined, does not present or
indicate the probable existence of mineral veins worthy of notice.
Subsequent examinations by many parties have confirmed this
inference. The geological productions of this Colony appear to
i ? ?
: jK-U- 1
be principally metallic : and those are confined to gold produced
on the surface of auriferous rocks during their decomposition.


However, as mineral veins are occasionally formed in
various spots in the most barren countries, and escape attention
during the excitement of the discovery of precious metals, I will
describe the character of the rocks in which mineral veins are
found in the primary series :
Gold. ?Always in the metallic state, combined with iron
pyrites in hornblendic porphyries, and compact clay-
slates with quartz, intersecting the series transversely,
i. e., from east to west. The north and south veins are
generally insignificant, and irregular in contents.
Silver. ?Sparingly metallic, and principally as a sulphuret?
in porphyritic and chloritic rocks, gneiss and schist?
but predominating in veins running north and south,
and seldom east and west; enclosed in the lamina of the
micaceous schist and quartz nodules.
Copper. ?This metal is often found in its metallic state in
large masses, also as an oxide and green carbonate (like
the Burra Burra in South Australia). However, the
greatest proportion obtained in the world is as a sulphu-
ret, and in large east and west fractures in felspathic
granites and compact clay-slates, and seldom in great
and productive quantities in north and south veins.
The local enrichment of these minerals depends on mechanical
and chemical causes, which cannot be entered into within the
limits of this short outline; therefore I must again refer to my
work on the subject to explain the apparent causes. The above
short sketch will, I trust, serve the purpose of persons who feel
an interest in the subject, as well as those engaged in explora-
tions. I may state, en passant , that the so-called copper ore,
supposed to have been discovered at the M?lvor (according to
the specimens sent to me) is the debris of the chloritic slate j
being of a pale green colour, I suppose it was mistaken for the
green carbonate of copper. This auriferous schistose range is not
the formation in which to expect auriferous veins, or lodes, or that
which will even produce superficial caps of the green carbonate.
There is nothing more injurious to the industry of a country, the
stability of its progress, and the economy of its wealth, than loose
and unfounded reports of its unlimited mineral and metallic pro-
ducts, thus gratifying momentary excitement at the expense of a


great waste of time, labour, and capital, which could have
been more profitably employed. All persons who have the per-
manent interest of a country at heart, and who have a desire to
_ . i -it ? 1 1
encourage this important branch of industry, should avoid quacks
and interested persons, and demand on all occasions the most
clear and substantial proof of all alleged discoveries before
giving them the least encouragement. Such reports have already
caused many to lose much valuable time, and especially the
industrious diggers. I would also strongly recommend that all
official reports on such subjects (which are ostensibly intended
for the practical use of those concerned), should be strictly con-
fined to the actual facts. The igneous rocks, volcanic and
imaginary eruptive matter, which too often embellish geological
reports, are like attributing all difficult and complicated pheno-
mena to the effects of electricity, the meaning of which is not
intended to be further explained; and therefore is an easy way of
getting out of those questions, to properly and satisfactorily eluci-
date which, requires a thorough knowledge of the subject. The
world is now getting too practical and too much enlightened to
allow such a mode of proceeding to be continued; therefore all
reports should be founded on the facts obtained in the fields of
observation, and be strictly confined to them. Those who are
so fond of the igneous principle of action, and look at all black,
red, and vesicular masses of isolated rocks through red spectacles,
and always bring forward the fiery element to cause such changes,
should study the hard honey-combed ferruginous crust (present-
ing the appearance of a slag) daily forming on the face of the
clay and sandstones, by the oscillating action of the sea and the
heat of the sun, on the beach at Brighton and other parts border-
ing Port Phillip Bay. This study would considerably modify
the notion of attributing so much effects to incandescent eruptions
or fiery volcanoes.


CHAP. X.
ON THE SUPERFICIAL APPEARANCE OF GOLD-PRODUCING
GROUND, ETC.
Barrenness, stunted vegetation, broken ridges, and continuous
hills of quartz, clay slate, and ferruginous gravel, are the chief
characteristics of gold-bearing rocks. The surface of such for-
mations is not only unavailable for extensive agricultural opera-
tions, but somewhat meagre for pastoral purposes, owing to the
absence of lime in the felspar, and the excess of iron and silica,
excepting in the soils of the bordering valleys. The surface of
the non-metallic sedimentary rocks, like those in the neighbour-
hood of Melbourne, Geelong, and the western districts, near the
southern coast, presents a very different aspect. The primary
elements in these parts of the Colony have been more or less
dissolved, and deposited in homogeneous layers in a fit state to
nourish the vegetable productions, and are very different to the
coarse ferruginous gravels of the gold fields. We must be there-
ore very cautious in estimating the value of the whole surface
of the higher parts of the primary rocks for agricultural pur-
poses. The thickness and quality of the soil, generally speaking
varies inversely as the richness of the ground is for metals (in
situ), therefore they are seldom found equally productive. I
have already stated that the greater portion of Victoria appears
to be more or less auriferous, from the Grampians to the Alps,
and uncovered by sedimentary rocks (except in some parts of
the flanks), very easily examined, not merely superficially but
geologically; and it would be for the interest of the Colony to
get a survey made as early as possible. This would be the
means of removing many uncertainties, and lead to the early
development of the actual resources of the country, and improve-
ments in inland communications.

CHAP. XI.
MAGNETIC MERIDIAN.
The term magnetic meridian has been applied to the line or
direction indicated by a magnetic needle freely and delicately
suspended on a centre. These lines seldom correspond to the
true meridian from pole to pole, and are perpetually varying in
their direction, not only from general causes but also from local
effects. They frequently differ in the angle of variation, even
in the same meridian, being often easterly in one place and
westerly in another. One of the lines of no variation is con-
sidered to cross the centre of Australia to the Indian Archi-
pelago ; but this cannot be depended upon, and I would strongly
recommend all those requiring the use of the compass for their
researches or guidance, on the ocean, in the interior of continents,
or in ascertaining the true bearing of the primary rocks, to
observe constantly the actual local variation. However deli-
cately needles may be balanced in England, or any other places
in the northern hemisphere, they become sluggish in their
vibrations when brought to the southern hemisphere, in conse-
quence of the tendency of the south end to drop, owing to
its proximity to the south pole and its consequent increased
influence ; therefore all needles require re-balancing?-the north
end must be made heavier by means of a little wax or any
other adhesive substance. The direction or bearing of the
structure of the primary rocks needs not such exactitude as is
required in the delineation of a coast; still it ought to approxi-
mate to the truth. Should the magnetic variation at the place of
observation happen to be on the contrary side to that supposed
by the observer, and laid down accordingly on a map, it would
lead to a very inconvenient error and to erroneous conclusions.
E 2


Surveys made solely by compasses and without the usual
checks for correcting the magnetic variations, cannot fail to
produce great confusion in the boundary lines between different
properties. All territorial surveys and maps should be strictly
made and laid down according to the direction of the true
meridian. I remember an instance in South America, where
the magnetic variation had varied from 6 deg. 30 min. to
8 deg. 30 min. east in the course of a few years, and where
certain new communications had to be made underground in
long-established mines, which, had they been made according to
the old maps and plans, would have led to a very expensive
error. This, however, was prevented by my taking new obser-
vations.
Numerous properties, as well as mines, would be brought
into endless litigation by the continual variation in the direction
of the magnetic needle, if places were constantly laid down and
measured from the local direction of the needle instead of the
true. The direction of the magnetic needle in England, about
250 years ago, was 11 deg. east of north; it is now about 24 deg.
west of north, and is constantly undergoing a slow oscillation.
Besides progressive changes, there are annual or periodical
movements and daily oscillations constantly taking place in all
parts of the world where magnetic observations have been made.
This subject is very important, and should be well con-
sidered in a new country like this, requiring a general survey
and the marking of the divisions of properties.* The surveys
should be made on base lines and triangulations, and the direc-
tion of the magnetic needle indicated at the period taken, and
that specified, and not taken for granted and marked according
to old observations.

ON THE TRANSITIONS AND CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE
PRIMARY ROCKS.
When granite predominates in crystalline flakes, suck as mica,
talc, &c., with a large proportion of fibreous felspar, it changes
from the crystalline into the slaty. This transition of the funda-
mental base into the laminated structure is so gradual as to
render it impossible to mark the line of change. It is like a
polar growth of the Mineral Kingdom, drawing out the primary
elements into a variety of meridional bands to an indefinite
extent. Hence, mica granite produces micaceous schist?talcose
granite, talcose schist?chloritic granite, chloritic slate?&c., &c. ;
and the other variety of granites, such as the hornblendic,
felspathic, quartzose, &c., produce corresponding rocks of different
structure. In consequence of this tendency of parallelism
amongst the ingredients, primary rocks are capable of being split
like trunks of trees, i. e., in a polar direction. The felspathic
granite, especially when supersaturated with potash and impreg-
nated with iron, seldom developes the slaty rocks so perfectly as
the micaceous. This granitic compound, generally speaking,
exfoliates along the undulating surface, changing into brown
compact clay-stone, coloured according to the quantity of the
peroxide of iron present, and often produces a large extent of
In latitude 40 deg. south, on the 2nd of June, 1852,1 drew the attention
of Captain Smith, of the Futtel Oheb, to this subject, and requested him to make
direct observation to prove it. The Nautical Almanack indicated a diameter of
dl mm. .Msec. The meridian altitude of the sun was 22 deg., and its actual
apparent diameter was found to be 32 min. 22 sec., being a difference of 48 sec
causing an error in calculating the longitude equal to six miles. The captain
became so convinced on this subject that he determined in future to be guided by
the variable diameter of the sun according to its angular position; and I would
recommend all others to do the same in taking observations in southern zones.

pipe-clay beds (silicate of alumina) on the flanks. During this
change, as already described, the metals become liberated, deve-
loped, and deposited, in quantity according to local conditions.
The north part of Mount Alexander, on the declivity towards
Bendigo, and between the branches of this ridge, exhibits these
variable changes where they may be studied with advantage.
The slates bounding Mount Alexander granite on the west and
east belong to granites situated further south; and it will be
observed, on careful inspection, that all the meridional slaty
bands, shown in Section No. 1, proceed from their respective
granitic bases, on which their character for productiveness or
poverty depends. Although the transitions northward are so
gradual as to be almost imperceptible, the demarcation of the
different bands transversely, i. e., east and west, are quite dis-
tinct, as seen on reference to the Section.
It is therefore most important, in examining the gold-
bearing bands, to obtain some idea of their starting points, and
their probable meridional extent, which can only be properly
and systematically done by tracing the degrees of the primary
transitions, or the molecular arrangement in the fundamental
compound to favor the liberation of its hidden treasures.


CHAP. XIII.
THE DIGGINGS AND THE DIGGERS,
It will be observed, in perusing tbe preceding chapters, that the
conditions under which the gold is found in these Colonies are
not by any means different to those of a similar character seen in
other countries. The only novelty observable in these gold
deposits is the system which has been adopted to extract the
metal. In a Colony like this, it may well be conceived that great
confusion must have been created when the sudden discovery of
extraordinary golden treasures, found deposited in the subsoil,
was announced, and more especially when the precious metal
was picked up like potatos in potato fields. The excitement
during the commencement of the scramble was almost uncon-
trollable, and considerable jealousy prevailed amongst diggers,
migrating adventurers, and others, with respect to grants of
ground for systematic workings by Companies. That period of
excitement and its glittering scenes, which disturbed the equa-
nimity and the social order of the community, and intoxicated
the minds of those hitherto unaccustomed to handle so much
metallic wealth, is passing fast away, and will be shortly a matter
of history. The great increase in the population, and the
immense surface over which the diggers are now spread will
prevent the repetition of such scenes. The majority of those
who have a desire to follow this pursuit as their vocation would
be happy to see a more permanent system of working introduced,
less oppressive and obnoxious than the license fee. By the
introduction of the system of grants and leases on fair terms, we
have the following advantages : *
Firstly ?It would give fixity of tenure to the digging popu-
lation, and thus enable them to claim the privilege of
voting, like the rest of the members of the state.


Secondly?Migrating adventurers, and persons who do not
come to the gold fields to work like other men, would be
kept in check hy those working on grants.
Thirdly?Respectable bodies could be formed at any time to
petition the Government or the Legislative Council to
redress all just grievances.
Fourthly?Permanent dwellings and cultivation would be
introduced, and the proceedings of the other branches of
industry would not be disturbed by any rich discoveries
made in any of the grants.
When the system of grants is established, and the dues levied on
'I 'frUTTHMuji m '
the products in proportion to the value of the ground, everything
goes on peaceably with but little trouble, and it tends to prevent,
or at least to alleviate, many of the distressing scenes observable
in gold countries.
Although the extraction of gold from superficial deposits,
when once discovered, does not require the art and ingenuity
necessary for mining, yet there are many localities that cannot
be worked properly and with advantage by single individuals, and
must be left as unavailable to the country unless they be operated
upon on a large scale by a combination of interests, i. e., by
bodies of men uniting together to carry on the operations in a
systematic 'and economical manner. Again, there are many
deposits, which after having once been broken up and the larger
masses taken out, cannot afterwards be re-worked, even on a large
scale, with profit, thus shewing the necessity of working the
ground properly in the first instance. This is the cause why
proprietors of metalliferous ground have such an objection to an
irregular picking system by irresponsible persons, and only grant
the ground to responsible parties (private or public) who will
extract the whole of the available metal in the first operation.
When such works are undertaken it is necessary to consider the
extent and depth of the gold deposit its approximate average
contents proved by trial pits, sunk at various points within given
limits?-the quantity of soil, sand, and clay to be extracted and
operated upon periodically to ensure profitable issue?and the
local means afforded to effect the object in view. These, together
with the conditions stipulated, are the primary points to be con-
sidered before commencing the work?that is, by hona fide


parties who take up ground with the intention of working it with
profit.
However, these questions may be left to the discrimina-
tion of the gold diggers; what we have principally to consider is
the present state of the diggings and the average earnings of the
diggers. At the commencement, when such large quantities of
gold could so easily be obtained, and when the diggers earned
on an average weekly from 1-J to 2 ounces of gold, and upwards,
with the chances of great prizes, all went on well ; but now, find-
ing that the refuse and the new fields scarcely produce half an
ounce per week on the present system of working, 30s. per month
is felt exceedingly oppressive by a very large majority. Although
such an extraordinary golden harvest, placed within reach of an
immense multitude, never occurred before in the history of the
world, yet similar events in lesser degree, spread over greater
periods, have taken place and are on record, together with their
natural effects and consequences, with their accompanying pre-
vailing abuses, which this metal tends to create in all ages and
in all countries where it is found most abundantly.
Much has been said respecting the value of the refuse left
on the gold fields by the diggers; but such valuations are often
made without the least judgment, and without taking into con-
sideration the number of times the ground might have been
worked over, and the state in which the gold is found in the
different localities, which require to be borne in mind in making
such estimates. Again, the real value of any given grant as a
remunerative speculation cannot be judged by the contents per
ton alone. I have known ground producing only a quarter of an
ounce per ton worked at a considerable profit; whilst other
places, containing upwards of two ounces per ton, were unable
to pay cost, in consequence of the different conditions of the
localities, the facility of working on a great scale by cheap means,
and the quantity of washing stuff at command. The former, with
the aid of water power and water for washing, could be worked
with economy and great dispatch, whereas the latter were rocky
and deficient in water.
The Colony of Victoria is exceedingly deficient in water
power, and also in the ordinary streams for washing purposes;
therefore in making comparisons with the washing stuff left


behind by the diggers in this Colony, and that seen in other
countries, more favourably supplied with water, &c., we must
duly consider the relative advantages, and not be led away by
loose valuations or by an apparent increase in the contents, with-
out reference to other most essential elements. I speak from
many years? experience in these matters, and have had the satis-
faction of carrying on works on a very large scale and of intro-
ducing machinery to render stuff profitable, that was previously
worked at a loss when it produced one ounce per ton, but subse-
quently made profits with only a product of half an ounce per
ton.
The diggers must be well aware that if the gold digging
and washing is to be continued in the old fields in a regular and
profitable manner, water must be obtained in sufficient quantity
either by pumping or damming, as near the scene of operation as
possible. Again, the stuff to be extracted and conveyed to the
washing places must be of sufficient amount to ensure an average
product to pay cost: and the stuff drawn up and transported by
the most efficient and cheapest power at command. Private
parties and public companies would not be justified in going to
the expense of providing the above means, without first obtaining
such grants as would encourage them to do so. The labour and
the risk are quite sufficient to incur in such undertakings, without
any other restrictions; therefore the sooner liberal grants are
made the better it will be, not only for the diggers, but also for
the community at large, and the permanent good of the Colony.


CHAP. XIV.
CONCLUSION.
A general detail of all the phenomena observed in metalliferous
formations, with the different systems of extraction, would be
much too voluminous to render such a work convenient and
within the reach of those who require instruction in the gold fields.
This small pamphlet is only intended to supply general informa-
tion and useful hints to the intelligent miners and diggers, aiding
them in their progress in the field of operations, and assisting
them in arranging and connecting the facts wdiich they may
glean from daily experience, so that they can be applied usefully
in this most important branch of industry. By carefully study-
ing the laws of the Mineral Kingdom in the Book of Nature,
which is daily opened before us in all parts of the world, we find
that it is as essential to know the order of structure, composition
of rocks, and chemical actions, as the nature of he tools we
employ in the various subterranean operations.
Gold digging unfortunately has been a somewhat debasing
and delusive pursuit, from the beginning of history down to the
present time : often pernicious to morals, destructive to social
ties and obligations, and provocative of the evil passions that
have a dwelling-place in the breast of man. There are happily
a few exceptions, and I believe a great number of these evils
may be corrected and avoided in all civilized countries by
judicious regulations. When gold fields are thrown open to
needy adventurers and criminals, on equal terms with the well-
disposed and industrious diggers, we need not be surprised at
such debasing and distressing scenes. Let us look forward with
hope that the gold fields of Victoria will shortly be brought to
a state that will serve as an example to other countries for order

and steady industry, and tlie workings carried on in such a
manner as will ensure a permanent product, remunerative to the
diggers and beneficial to the country at large.
I trust also that our minds will not he entirely absorbed in
the glittering metal, but sometimes think and contemplate the
order, the design, and object of the beautiful and rich produc-
tions which are provided for us?which impress upon us the
uniformity and unchangeable character of Nature?s laws, and
make us look up with solemn admiration to Nature?s Author.
The science of Geology, founded on the laws daily observed in
Nature, is a pleasing and gratifying study. It cannot he sur-
passed even by Astronomy; and must in the course of time
become elevated to that of the sublime in magnitude, utility,
and moral good.

her laws are the only things that have resisted the general movement. The rivers and the

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.
FIRST EDITION.
The book contains very valuable information, somewhat closely connected
with topics of great interest to this country It is quite beyond my ability
to give a fair analysis of this book; and I will conclude what I have to say by
recommending those who are practically acquainted with the mineral condition
of the country to peruse the chapter relating to the filling of veins. It seems
to me to throw out lights which might or might not fall in with their local
experience; but which would at all events afford matter for profitable inquiry
and comparisons, &c .?Sir Charles lemon, Bart., M.P., President of the Royal
Geological Society of Cornwall, in his Annual Address, 1844.
V Hitherto geological science has been designated as a vague and useless
doctrine by many of our practical miners ; and it is true that primary rocks,
with their mineral veins, have been left, by speculative geologists, as terra
incognita, in complete obscurity; but we are happy to observe a change for the
better?the science now is beginning to have a more useful and practical bear-
ing, and men are getting more anxious to learn it; and it is to be hoped that
with this combined influence and the diligent accumulations of new facts, such
a degree of certainty will be obtained as may enable them to predicate with
some confidence, not only questions connected with mineral deposits, but like-
wise all phenomena which it comprehends. We have been led to make these
observations on this interesting subject, in consequence of Mr. Hopkins's new
system of Geology, which, owing to its practical applications to mining, and
the satisfactory manner in which it accounts for all phenomena connected with
terrestrial physics, is becoming an established system with practical men. The
interest has been considerably enhanced of late, owing to the recent discoveries
made by the indefatigable Dr. Faraday, corroborating in a remarkable degree
Mr. Hopkins's general views, as explained in his work "?Mining Journal .
?The igneous theory?the doctrine of central fire?has for some time been
slowly yielding to other views. All the phaenomena attributed to fire may be
f reduced (according to Mr. Hopkins's system) by electro-magnetic currents,
t is difficult to imagine the existence of fires unsupplied with the oxygen of
the atmosphere Even the cause of the variation of the needle,
mysterious as it has hitherto appeared to be, may be referred to the relative
energies of the magnetic currents. The wasting away and degradation of the
land, which have often been viewed with alarm, are now shown to be compen-
sated for by a process tending to the renewal and perpetuation of the physical
universe. We look forward to the labours of Professor Faraday as destined to
throw further light on this interesting branch of science, in which he has already
done so much. According to Sir John Herschel, we are to look to electro-
dynamics for the vera causa of the Newtonian philosophy." Chambers'
Journal , August , 1847.
? It is the best and indeed the only principle hitherto propounded, which is
capable of accounting for the various and complicated pha3nomena of Geology,
in a clear and satisfactory manner, in this as well as in all other parts of the
world with which I am acquainted."? Extract from a letter received from a
geologist in Fern.
? It is an acknowledged fact by all miners that the Geology commonly taught
is of no avail to them, and even the character of the primary rocks and the
mineral veins is so imperfectly described, as to mislead those who study them
from the ordinary books and lectures on Geology. It is admitted also that the
only practical system of Geology applied to mining, and now used by mining
engineers, is ?Hopkins's Geology and Magnetism.'" ?Mining Gazette .
