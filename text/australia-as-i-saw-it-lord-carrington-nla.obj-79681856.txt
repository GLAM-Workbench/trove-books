SPECIAL GENERAL MEETING.
A special General Meeting of the Institute was held at Princes
Hall, Piccadilly, on Monday, January 26, 1891, the 103 rd
anniversary of European settlement in Australia. H.R.H. the
Prince of Wales, K.G., G.C.M.G., &c., President of the Institute,
presided.
Conspicuous among the decorations of the platform was the
Australian wattle blossom, bouquets of which were carried by many
of those present.
The Minutes of the last Ordinary General Meeting were con-
firmed.
The Pkesident : It affords me great pleasure, as President of
the Royal Colonial Institute, to take the Chair on this occasion,
and to introduce to you my noble friend Lord Carrington, who has
recently returned from being Governor of New South Wales, and I
have little doubt you will listen with great interest and pleasure to
the Paper he is about to read to you.
Lord Caiuungton then read his Paper on
AUSTRALIA AS I SAW IT.
It would perhaps be hardly possible for any man to presume to
address so representative and distinguished a gathering as this
without a certain amount of diffidence, and it seemed at first a very
open question whether I could accept the courteous invitation of the
Council of the Royal Colonial Institute; but when your Royal
Highness honoured me with the intimation that if a paper was read
you would consent to preside, and when out of compliment to the
Australian you selected January 26, the anniversary day of New
South Wales, it was impossible for me to hesitate for one instant.
The suggested title, ? Australia as I saw it,? only indicates my in-
dividual opinions, and I propose this evening to give in as plain
terms aa possible my impressions of that portion of Australia?New
South Wales?in which it was my good fortune for five happy years
to represent Her Majesty the Queen. It must, of course, be distinctly
understood that these impressions are mine and mine alone. I have
no wish to cram others with my own opinions, but only to explain
very simply the impressions that have forced themselves upon me


during my stay in the midst of a most favoured portion of the British
Empire.
Five years ago I landed in Sydney with my wife and my children,
hardly knowing a single soul by sight in the whole country.
My great desire was to be free from prejudice and open to im-
pressions. The impressions and ideas brought back from New South
Wales may be common to myself and to others. In my opinion
others do share them, but I will not venture to say so, because the
first thing that a Governor hears when he arrives is that Governors
must form the worst opinions on every subject, because they carry
their atmosphere about with them everywhere, and are even sup-
posed sometimes to convey in the same train the flags and decora-
tions with which they are to be welcomed the next morning.
However, I am not now the mouthpiece of others, and though I
will not pose as an ? isolated original,? I repeat again that you must
take me as only speaking for myself, and telling you my own ideas.
It is only the experience of five years ; many of those present have
known New South Wales much longer, and can probably give you
better information. Some of you may not agree with me, and some
may, perhaps, think my words too confident. If that is so, be
pleased to excuse me for that, and let me excuse myself on the
principle that ? The power of conversion is inherent in sharply-
defined doctrines,? and that plain speaking comes naturally to most
men.
I will now at once begin the subject on which I have to say a few
words, and give you my text, taken from a speech by H.E.H. the
President at a meeting of this Institute :
? We are, in fact, a vast English nation, and we should take great
care not to allow those who have gone forth from among us to
imagine that they have in the slightest degree ceased to belong to
the same community as ourselves.?
I trust that his Royal Highness will not think that he is going
to be brought into the difficulties of controversy. These words of
his express, better than it ever has been expressed, an opinion
common to every subject of the Queen. They are words which
should be remembered and cherished by us all, and handed down to
our children?s children.
But how the question is to be worked out is another story. A
short while ago English Englishmen were carried away by the
notion of Imperial Federation. It was a beautiful and a suggestive
proposal, and wise men hoped that, though it might be an ideal, it
was not a fancy. Nobody quite seemed to understand how it was to


bo done, but they said it must be done, because they expected it
might be done. There were suggestions of an Imperial Council to
decide great issues and of a Commercial Union or Zollverein be-
tween England and her Colonies. Now it is beginning to be seen
that there are some difficulties in the way. If an Imperial Council
is constituted, will the Colonies agree to be involved in European
wars, and pay their share, or are we going to give them representa-
tion, and thus take away the power at present centred in the Parlia-
ment of the United Kingdom without any compensatory taxation ?
How many of Her Majesty?s subjects are to be represented upon this
Council, and how shall the Franchise be determined ? Is India to
be admitted, or to have the door shut in her face for ever ? If the
door is not to be closed, and if population can be the only test, are
we to look forward to endless entanglement in practical difficulties
brought upon us according to the discretion of Asiatic races ? The
doctor, without consulting the patient as to his symptoms, or
looking at any books on the subject, concocted a pill, and seems to
have told the patient to swallow it, saying: ? There?s plenty of gilt
on it; I don?t know what it contains, or what it will do, or how it
will work, but it looks nice. Be quick and take it.?
Still, there remains the broad fact that we are people of the same
community. Those words, ?the same community,? form, as it were,
the base from which inquirers must start. The outline of the
contract lies before us. How is it to be filled up in this and in
future generations ?
The strength of the broad fact that we are people of the same
community is brought home to an Australian Governor almost at
once. There are people of the same kindred, speaking the same
language, following the same laws, accustomed to the same habits,
and with whom, as with ourselves, attachment to a Parliamentary
Government has become a part of the national policy.
Nevertheless, it was also noticeable that great differences existed.
A scattered population, according to European notions, in a vast
country; a small proportion of that population settled upon the soil;
freedom of mind and habits nurtured by more air, more sun, more
space ; influence centred in Sydney and in other of the larger towns,
but not-in the thinly-peopled country districts?all are striking
features of New South Wales. The most salient feature of all was
the power of growing and conscious strength.
It is almost needless to ask whether we wish to hold this splendid
country with us. We are eager to keep and aid it. How and by
what means the end can be gained is a question which is only to be


solved by time, by circumstances, by the current of external and
internal events.
Let us first consider this growing strength to which allusion has
been made, and then deal with its results. Do you suppose for one
single instant that this great country of Australia is going to remain
as she is, with a population of four and three-quarter millions, or
I*4 to the square mile ? It has been lately calculated that
Continental Europe supports now 156 persons per square mile,
including all kinds of land. Australasia is said to have 1,167,000
square miles of fertile land, excluding poorer grass runs. If this be
so, Australasia can support more than 182 millions of people, and if
her present rate of increase, estimated at thirty per cent, in ten
years, should continue, in less than ninety years her population
will be as large as the population of Great Britain at the present
time.
Statistics after dinner are as odious as a corked bottle of claret,
but I am obliged to ask you to swallow a little more.
Since 1861 the people of New South Wales have nearly quad-
rupled, and they really are increasing as fast as they can, as the
facts that the average number during the last ten years has been
four-and-a-half children per woman?married women?and that one
mother in every 116 gives birth to twins, may serve to prove.
The country is five times the size of England, and with a popula-
tion no denser than that of France could support forty-eight millions
of people.
Coal-fields have been found to exist over an area of 25,000 square
miles, as against about 4,000 square miles for the coal-fields of
Great Britain.
InlBB9 the value of wool exported exceeded ten-and-a-half millions,
the value of gold was nearly three-and-a-quarter millions, and it is
said that, though the nominal trade between Great Britain and New
South Wales amounted in 1889 to the large sum of nearly seventeen-
and-three-quarter millions out of a total Australasian trade of
146 millions, it is probable that the actual value of this trade was
considerably more than twenty-five millions.
In 1881 it was estimated that, according to population, the external
trade of the Colony was upwards of three times that of Canada,
nearly five times that of France, nearly eight times that of the
United States, more than sixteen times that of Austria, and more
than twenty-five times that of Russia, and its average already nearly
double that of the Mother Country.
It would be easy to go on giving statistics till twelve o?clock, but


what has been here merely glanced at must be taken as a suggestion
of the vast capability of this country.
In my farewell speech last October, I was able to state that the
revenue receipts of New South Wales in 1885 were seven-and-a-half
millions ; this year they are over nine millions. Five years ago
18,000 people were employed in mining, and the value of the output
was two-and-a-half millions. This year we have 28,000 miners,
with an output of nearly four-and-a-half millions. The total
trade was forty-and-a-half millions, it is now forty-six-and-a-quarter
millions. In shipping the total tonnage was four-and-one-eighth
million tons ; in 1890 it was five-and-a-quarter million tons ; and
while cattle have only increased half-a-million head, sheep have
increased from thirty-seven to fifty millions, half of the whole
number in the Australasian Colonies.
Further, the Colony has taken the great step of improving
internal communications by means of a penny postage, in spite of
the vast distances to be traversed. I can only hope that, when our
postal conventions with other countries will admit, the present rate
of 2 \d. may be further reduced to a penny.
Now let us consider the result of this rapidly-growing strength.
It is tempting to use the words of Henry James, the famous
American, when describing Hawthorne; ? A large juvenility is
stamped upon the face of things, and in the vividness of the present
the past, which died so young and had time to produce so little,
attracts but little attention.?
Men have been so occupied with ? the vividness of the present,?
with the importance of their own individual affairs, that public
opinion has not become so ? crystallised,? or so keen and sharp, as
in the Mother Country. But within the last ten years public opinion
has been advancing, like everything else, by leaps and bounds, and
is rapidly becoming a very strong ? juvenile ? indeed, with a will of its
own, and the Australian will is a question which has to be faced.
In old days there was a maxim, ? Spare the rod, spoil the child.?
The world has given that maxim up as essentially bad for our homes,
for our public schools, and for our army. Well, my suggestion is,
apply the latter principle to its full extent to Australia, tend her with
love and kindness, draw her to you, let her feel respect for you, but
leave her to find out her own way as far as possible. Don?t let us
have the French system of making the school walk two and two
with the master?s eye upon them. They will do much better by
themselves; even if they do sometimes have a little quarrel among
themselves, they will be all the better friends after. But suspicion


begets distrust, birching begets recklessness and finally contempt,
breach of promise destroys all feeling of reliance. Who can be
pleased at seeing sentences like this in an organ of public opinion ?
?Brisbane Courier, May 2, 1886: ? The unpleasant experiences
of Colonial diplomacy have, almost without exception, originated in
the crass incapacity of the Colonial Office to recognise that the
Australia of to-day is not the shackled infant of pre-representative
self-government.? And again: ? The main points of divergence
between Australia and England so far have been revolt against the
drastic dragooning of the gold-fields Government sought to be
enforced in 1854; the continuance of the transportation system ;
the refusal of the Victorian Government to permit the landing of
Irish informers ; the exclusion of Chinese ; the annexation of New
Guinea ; the approbation of Imperial representatives ; and the right
of vetoing the legislation affirmed by Parliamentary representatives.?
I think that this system should pass away like ? the old colonial
school?hard livers for the most part, somewhat reckless as a rule,?
of whom the Australian poet of rider and horse, Adam Lindsay
Gordon, tells, though the dash and the courage remain and men can
still say:?
?Tis merry ?mid the blaekwood, when we spy the station roofs,
To wheel the wild scmb cattle at the yard,
With a running fire of stockwhips and a fiery run of hoofs?
Oh! the hardest day is never then too hard.
The idea of the people seems to be, ? Hurrah for the sovereignty of
the Queen ?God bless her ! but be pleased not to put it in force ? to
cripple the free expansion of Australian self-governinginstitutions.? ?
What is to be done with the idea ? Follow it up, tend it in the
direction of maintaining love and respect for the old Mother
Country without any restraint by the proverbial apron-strings.
If it is often difficult under the modifying circumstances of the
moment to understand great political questions in perfect clearness,
the general effect and tendency may be frequently understood by an
unprejudiced observer. The idea of Nationalism?a very different
thing from Separation?is strongly growing and increasing in Aus-
tralia, and the course of history, as usual, will probably be closely
connected with ideas.
For a long time the idea has been but vague and floating in the
minds of men, but it has been strengthened by various events ?
pressure from without as in the Chinese question, relations with the
Mother Country as in the case of New Guinea?and every year adds


to its power. Evidence of the extent to which the idea of Nation-
alism is obtaining influence in Australia may be gathered from the
occurrences of recent years. Let me emphasise my position by facts?
by brief allusion to a difficulty solely caused by independent action
during the recerft disturbance with regard to the Chinese question
?a question which is practically an illustration of the points which
I am trying to lay before you, viz. (1) That Australia is determined
to be British. (2) That she does not desire interference with her
internal affairs. (3) That a national feeling is arising in Australia,
influenced by pressure from without, the policy of the Mother
Country, and the varying action of different Colonies. (4) That the
independent action of the different Colonies, without union amongst
themselves, must create difficulties.
In the early part of 1888 a strong feeling again burst forth
throughout the whole country that the introduction of Chinese to
Australia was assuming such dimensions as to become a menace to
the well-being of the people. On March 31, 1888, I forwarded a
telegram, at Sir Henry Parkes?s request, in which the state of feel-
ing was called to the attention of the Secretary of State. On April
14 he replied : ? Matter under consideration.? On the same date
an answer was sent; ? Telegram of April 14 received with satisfac-
tion.? On April 25 I sailed for Norfolk Island, with Lady Carring-
ton, on board H.M.S. Nelson, through the kindness of Admiral
Fairfax, and returned on May 16, to find the city in a state of some
excitement at the arrival of several ships with 200 or 300 China-
men on board. No steps had been taken by the Imperial Govern-
ment, and the delay was wrongly attributed to indifference and
want of interest. On Thursday, the 17th, the situation was con-
sidered so serious that a Chinese Restriction Bill was passed through
all its stages in one night and sent to the Legislative Council. Sir
Henry Parkes, in moving the second reading, went so far as to say :
? A few more masterly displays of indifference like this on the part
of the Secretary of State would do more than much more serious
occurrences to sap the loyalty of the Colonies. We began to feel
we were treated in an unworthy manner.? Although the public
refused to be convinced, individually I knew the Home Government
would stand by Australia, as they always have done, as soon as they
understood what Australia really wished to have, and I awaited an
explanation. It was given on June 8 by Lord Knutsford in the
House of Lords. He denied that the Imperial Government had
displayed any dilatoriness in dealing with communications from
Australia on the subject of Chinese emigration and explained why


nothing was done. ?In fact,? as Lord Knutsford justly observed,
? at the end of April we received a telegram from the Governor of
one of the Australian Colonies, asking us not to take any decision
with respect to negotiations with the Chinese Government until we
should have received despatches which had been forwarded. I
mention this to show that during April there was no delay on the
part of the Government, and no disinclination to act.? Lord
Knutsford thus clearly shows that the English Government Avere
anxious to do all that they could, and the deadlock caused by a
telegram of which Australia was ignorant was removed as speedily
as possible.
Such a difficulty as this would not perhaps occur again. The
mere increase of railways makes it more easy for Governors and
leading politicians to exchange views, and there is union springing
up between the Colonies. Events are all tending toAvards an
Australian Federation, and Australian ha\ T e already
taken steps to mould the idea into reality. Australian Nationalism
has received its latest development in the scheme of Sir Henry
Parkes, and on March 2, 1891, the leading statesmen will meet at
Sydney in Convention, sent by their OAvn Parliaments, to consider
for themselves lioav this great scheme can be carried into effect.
Sir Henry Parkes, in a letter to me, says : ?All the Australian
Colonies, with the exception of Western Australia, have appointed
their delegates, in all thirty-five, a list of whom I enclose. New
Zealand will, I believe, send three, and if Western Australia sends
the same number as the other Australias the Convention will con-
sist of forty-five members, all presumably chosen for their public
standing and ability. The list includes thirteen or fourteen
Premiers and ex-Premiers. Altogether, apart from the great object
of its meeting, it will be the most eminent gathering ever held in
Australia.? Sir Henry Parkes himself, the pioneer of this great
movement, will, I hope, be chosen to preside over the Convention,
In speaking of Sir Henry Parkes, one of the most eminent
statesmen who have ever served Her Majesty, I cannot refrain from
expressing my acknoAvlcdgments to him of the kindness and consti-
tutional support Avhich I have invariably received at his hands.
He combines courage with eloquence, can speak like a statesman,
and work like a slave. He is a man, as it were, born to lead and
shape the destinies of a groAving country, and to fight the battle of
a good cause, fighting often so hard that a spectator might scarcely
guess the kindness of heart and affection which he can slioav to
those whom he counts as his friends.


If the tendency of Australia towards Nationalism makes her more
confident in her strength and more alive to her interests, it need
not diminish or impair by one jot or one tittle the loyalty of
Australia to England. Australia knows the value of the connec-
tion, and will not lightly cast it aside; and England by common
sense should be able to influence the national feeling in her favour,
and not to irritate it against her. If I should seem to contend that
the part of England in the matter is small and insignificant, I
answer that it is, but that the size is not a measure of the importance.
Australia has been doing her share by commencing to work out her
federation. Once accomplish that, and the task of the Mother
Country should become even more easy. There would be little
practical work for the Mother Country to do, but Australia would
always desire to maintain the connection. To begin with, the
question of pocket-money cannot be dismissed as of no importance.
The largest proportion of the trade of Australia is with Great
Britain. The largest proportion of the public debt of Australia is
due to Great Britain, and if a split occurred Colonial bonds would
fall in London, and money would not be lent on such favourable
terms. Australia receives the benefit of an English Foreign Office
and an English Consular System. Apart from a point of such im-
mediate practical importance, Australia would remember that she
is in the closest alliance with the only country in the world which,
while she assists her Colonies to protect themselves, has never
asked, and never will ask, from them for a man or for a shilling for
her own defence. The Australians know that the Mother Country
would look upon a descent on the Australian shores in the same
way as they would upon a landing in Hampshire or in Kent; that
she would no more tolerate a hostile foreign flag flying within the
three-mile range before Sydney than in Southampton Water; and
that, backed by her, they need never fear any attack upon those
liberties which their fathers have handed down as a sacred trust for
all time. England, they know, will not be deterred from protecting
them at the dictation of any imperial council or on the demand of
any other Colony. They would, for instance, never refuse aid to
Australia because Canada did not see the absolute necessity of it.
And in the same way, though it is outside the bounds of possibility
that England and the United States should seriously quarrel over
the right to secure a lady?s sealskin jacket or a piece of boiled cod,
yet, if the necessity arose, England would not wait for the consent
of the Australasian group before she despatched the cruisers flying
the white flag into the Bay of Fundy or the Behring Sea.


But, though neither England nor Australia will suffer dictation,
both can exercise tact and common sense, not qualities to be
despised in the world. Very small questions are frequently very
important?just as, when a man educates a child, he generally
pays attention to the dotting of the i?s and the crossing of the t?s,
or they will never be dotted or crossed hereafter: ?
A pebble in the streamlet scant
May turn the course of many a river;
A dewdrop on the baby plant
May warp the giant oak for ever.
Though my general argument is that England should leave
Australia to herself, yet there are various matters on which small
discrepancies exist, which can and should be remedied either by
the English Government, or by the bodies of Englishmen with
whom the power may rest, in order that Australians may feel that
they are of the same community with ourselves.
A few instances in support of my argument may not be out of
place.
In regard to the matter of distinctions ?the opening up of the
same road to successful men throughout the community?why
should not a Colonial judge figure among the Judicial Committee
of the Privy Council ? Strong objections have been made to any
creation of Colonial Peers on the ground that it would tend towards
absenteeism, a great evil in any country; but why should not the
honours of the Peerage be given to the Chief Justices of Colonies,
not necessarily as Hereditary Peers, but Life Peers ? ?a position
which they could hold without necessarily being dragged from their
judicial chairs to sit in the House of Lords, but which yet would
give to them, if they visited London, an opportunity of meeting
their brethren of the Bench and the Peers of England upon an
equal footing. Our own House of Lords would be invigorated by
such an addition. Why should English Peers, baronets, and
knights, travelling in the Colonies, be addressed by their titles,
and gentlemen who are invariably in Australia written to and alluded
to as holding the distinction of Honourable be debarred in every
other part of the world from the use of such a title ? Why should
not some due rank in our tables of precedence be granted to the
Viceroys of India and Ireland, to the Governor-General of Canada, and
to Colonial Governors during their term of office, ex-colonial Bishops
and Judges, and other men who serve Her Majesty long and faith*
fully in distant portions of our community ? And why should not


some?of the statesmen who advise Her Majesty in respect to the
welfare of millions of her subjects, and of vast lands to which her
sovereignty extends, be considered worthy of becoming Privy Coun-
cillors to the Queen ?
In Algiers there used to be a Foreign Legion set apart and
exclusive?not French, not Algerian ; neither fish, flesh, nor fowl.
Are we not making a Foreign Legion of the Order of St. Michael
and St. George ? Why should not an Australian who has obtained
sufficient fame in his own country, a portion of our community,
though not within fifty miles of London, be entitled to aspire to
admission into a Colonial division of the Order of the Bath, and, if
he comes to England, find men wearing the same kind of Order
here, as a reward for good work done in this part of the community ?
It would, in reality, only be altering the colour of a ribbon, and
yet tend to greater unity.
It is possible that many more suggestions might be made upon
the same lines, and if some openings were made, it might be that
others would be desired. All the better: it would be evidence that
the right road was being taken, and it cannot do us any harm, and
may do a lot of good, if a trial is made with a few of such pebbles
or dewdrops, which may aid to turn the minds of those who are
moulding Australian Nationalism into certain belief and remem-
brance, whether they be men who have emigrated from the Mother
Country or new generations growing up who have never seen the
Mother Country, that we and they are of the same community.
Our Colonies naturally wish to have due measure dealt out to them
as members of the same community, without stoppages, on the same
principle which leads workmen to object to a Truck system.
A step which cannot be too highly praised has already been taken
in respect to a profession which is necessarily jealous of extending
its privileges to incapable men.
The College of Physicians and the College of Surgeons in England
admit men who have studied in many of the Colonial Universities,
including those of Melbourne, Adelaide, and Sydney, to present
themselves for their diplomas exactly as if they had carried out the
necessary curriculum of studies in England. If they pass they are
then entitled to be registered by the General Medical Council, and
have all the privileges of English medical men. I believe it is cor-
rect to say that the trust thus reposed in the Colonies has borne
good fruit, and that the men who have availed themselves of this
permission have as a rule proved themselves to be good men and
well and thoroughly educated.


Again, by the Medical Act of 1886, a person showing to the satis-
faction of the Registrar of the General Council that he holds some
recognised Colonial medical diploma granted to him in a British
possession to which the Act applies, and that he is of good charac-
ter, and that he is by law entitled to practise medicine, surgery, and
midwifery in such British possession, shall, on application and pay-
ment of a fee not exceeding �5, be entitled, without examination in
the United Kingdom, to be registered as a Colonial practitioner in
the United Kingdom. A recognised Colonial medical diploma is
stated to be such medical diploma as may be recognised for the time
being by the General Council as furnishing a sufficient guarantee of
the possession of the requisite professional knowledge.
The Act applies to any British possession which in the opinion
of Her Majesty, as shown in an Order in Council, affords to the
registered medical practitioners of the United Kingdom such privi-
leges of practising in the said British possession as to Her Majesty
may seem just.
Applications have been made under this Act from Ceylon, New
Soiith Wales, New Zealand, and Victoria, but not as yet from
South Australia. Colonists should recognise that they have to
take the first step in the matter, with every prospect of success.
This Act appears to me to be in itself strong evidence of the high
standard attained by our Colonists in the matter of education. That
is a subject so important that a few words, even if digressive, may
be given to it. It is very interesting to see how strong a desire
exists in our young Colonies to educate well and thoroughly. The
University of Sydney has large private endowments, five faculties
of arts, law, medicine, science, and engineering complete ; and five
colleges?the Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, Anglican, a Women?s
College in the course of formation, and a College for the training of
public-school teachers?affiliated to it, as well as a hospital, which
is part of the University Medical School.
Primary education is compulsory to the age of thirteen, and is
entirely in the hands of the State. The secondary schools are both
public and private. The best youths are drafted from the primary
to the secondary schools, and thence to the University, where they
are educated free, and given a maintenance of �SO a year. Primary
and secondary education is practically free, and the maxim ? Give
every man his chance ?is literally fulfilled. At the same time, in
the Medical Schools of the University of Sydney at least, an effort
has been made, which might reasonably be commended to the
notice of our own public schools and universities, to minimise the


evil of the ? cramming ? and ? examination system,? that bugbear
of English parents, who often see the chances of a son?s career
depending on good health during one particular week, or keeping
cool in the presence of an examiner whom he has never seen
before, and instinctively regards with the same dread as a child has
for the bogie man.
This danger is corrected in the University by allowing the results
of the class examinations, which are compulsory and are conducted
during the course by the teacher alone, to be taken into account in
the degree examinations ; by an interval of two years between the
first and second examinations; and while enforcing in every sub-
ject a practical or viva voce examination after the written paper,
making the teacher in every way co-ordinate with the associate
examiner. There is no separate examination for honours. Honours
depend on the high excellence of the student throughout his whole
career.
Passing from medicine I may, perhaps, venture to make a sug-
gestion with reference to another profession. It is, perhaps, a
dangerous thing for'a layman to advise as counsel, but I will follow
the advice of a celebrated lawyer to a young barrister as to the cor-
rect way of writing an opinion : ? My advice is this in legal form?
I3e short, be decided, and, if you can, be accurate.?
I am of opinion that since an Act was passed sixty-seven years
ago (8 & 4 Win. IV., c. 41, s. 30), enabling a judge of any Colonial
possession to be appointed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council, an Australian judge can still be eligible for such an
appointment, in spite of the fact that no Colonial judge has ever
been appointed.
If it is suggested that judges cannot be eligible unless appointed
by Ministers of Her Majesty, I answer that they are appointed by
Ministers of Her Majesty. Lawsuits frequently arise which involve
a consideration of Colonial land laws, and which Colonial judges
are peculiarly fitted to decide from their acquaintance with the land
legislation of the Colonies, and with the circumstances of Australian
life.
I am also strongly of opinion that it would be advisable to have
reciprocity between England and the Colonies in respect to practis-
ing at the bar.

It may be as well that in general consultation I should point out
that there are some difficulties. The Inns of Court would not like
to forego fees, but they are very rich, and the incursion would be
very small. The Colonists, I admit, ought to begin by giving
facilities to each other. There is reciprocity between New Zealand
and South Australia, but a New Zealand barrister cannot practise
in New South Wales, Victoria, or Queensland, unless he has been
admitted in New Zealand as a barrister only, and not also as a
solicitor; and a New Zealand solicitor cannot, by reason of not
having served articles, be admitted to practise in New South Wales,
Victoria, or Queensland. It is doubtful, even if articles have been
served, whether he would be admitted without serving further
articles and passing examinations. There are various other
angularities which should be looked to and knocked away.
Further extensions again might reasonably be made towards
allowing investment of trust funds in Colonial securities. No portion
of the public debt of New South Wales is due to war charges, and
very little to works of an entirely unproductive character. Sir Saul
Samuel, our Agent-General, says that the asset represented by
railways alone is of a value quite equal to the whole debt of the
Colony. The railways are now managed by a Commission quite
independent of political influence, three Commissioners being
appointed for the purpose, who are removable only by vote of both
Houses of Parliament. This is a guarantee that, as far as possible,
they will be worked with a due regard to the public interest; in
addition to which no lines can be constructed until they have passed
the inquiry of a Standing Committee of Members of both Houses of
Parliament appointed for the purpose. There are now 2,182 miles of
railways constructed at a cost of about �31,000,000, and yielding, after
paying the working expenses, about 3| per cent, per annum. In the
absence of navigable rivers, a network of railways over the Colony is
absolutely necessary for the settlement of people on the lands of
this grand country. The expenditure on these works has been
the means of providing homes for many thousands of the surplus
population of the Mother Country, and of promoting the large trade
which exists between this country and the Colony. It has been,
and is, the policy of the Government to construct these railways
more for the purpose of settling a population upon the lands of the
country than to make profit out of them, beyond providing for the
payment of the interest upon the capital borrowed for their con-
struction. Were these railways worked by a private Company
instead of by a Government they doubtless would be made to give


a larger return without imposing excessive charges for carriage.
After all, what is this debt ? It is indeed small compared with the
vast wealth of the Colony. Some of the Railway Companies in
England, having a length of lines less than those of New South
Wales, have a larger capital and are indebted to a much greater
extent than the Australian Colonies together; and yet we do not
hear any talk about the Railway Companies here over-borrowing.
Every shilling expended in the construction of railways and other
public works of a reproductive character in our Colonies is a boon
to the people of England, as well as an advantage to the Colonist.
The revenue of New South Wales is now nine millions and a
half; about �9 per head for every man, woman, and child in the
Colony, and yet the taxation is small as compared with other
countries. In 1870, New South Wales loans were floated in England,
bearing interest at the rate of five per cent., and were then sold at
a discount. Now the rate is three and a half per cent., and the
loans are sold at a premium, which shows the confidence that in-
vestors have in this class of security. In my opinion there is not
the slightest danger of Colonial Ministers in the future asking the
English public to lend them money unless they see their way clearly
to meet their engagements. It is their pride to maintain securities
in a good position, and they exercise as much care in the matter as
the Chancellor of the Exchequer with respect to Consols.
It may be asked what should be the position of the Governors of
the Colonies ? There seems to be an impression in England that the
Governor is only a mere figure-head and has got very little work to
do. But beyond any mere ornamental functions a Governor may
have and has opportunity for much, and often difficult, work. In
fact, I can hardly conceive a greater compliment to a man and to
his wife than to be selected and sent out to one of the great English-
speaking and self-governing communities, especially at the present
time to Australia, when the people seem to be entering upon a new
era of national life.
In my opinion a Governor should be the messenger of peace and
goodwill, and while loyal to the strict letter of the Constitution, he
should be in touch and harmony with the national aspirations and
the national rights of that particular Colony in which he has the
high distinction to represent Her Majesty the Queen.
His duties are not merely nominal. To quote Sir Henry Parkes?s
words: ? Those who think that the representative of sovereignty in
Australia has very little to do only betray their want of penetration
in regard to what men have to do who deal with the great public


affairs,? And as far as I can judge, Sir Henry Parkes exactly hit
off true Australian feeling with regard to the Queen?s representatives
when he wrote: ?One of the uppermost thoughts of the Colonist,
whatever his rank in society, is of the importance of everything
belonging to his Colony, including his own position in life and his
relations to the head of the Government, whom he prefers to regard
as the representative of his Sovereign rather than as Governor. He
is sensitive to a fault of any manifestation of English feeling which
may seem to belittle the conditions of his existence as a subject of
the Queen in a remote part of the Empire. In numberless cases
this deep-rooted sentiment exists in rough practical minds which
are quite unconscious of it, though it manifests itself to all around
them on the faintest provocation. With regard to the Governor, as
a rule he receives an amount of dutiful attention which the same
man would not have received in any other capacity. For the time
being he is felt to be the essential and the highest part of the fabric
of law and order. No name is above his?and his name is a symbol
of respect for authority, and of loyalty to the Throne and the Empire.
The people of one Colony cherish this sentiment towards the
Governor of every other Colony. The people of New South Wales
would feel acutely any slight or supposed slight offered to their
Governor in Victoria, and in like manner the people in Victoria
would feel any supposed indignity of a like nature in New South
Wales.? These are the words of Sir Henry Parkes, who has been
acquainted with many Governors.
As to the courtesy shown to a Governor when he is visiting other
Colonies, I have had practical experience. On visiting Sir William
Robinson during the Exhibition at Adelaide in South Australia, I
was received at a luncheon given by the members of the Ministry
to me, as the representative of the Queen, at which all the members
of both Houses were present. Again, before leaving New South
Wales I was invited to a banquet given in the Queen?s Hall,
Melbourne, by Sir James Mac�ain, President of the Legislative
Council, and by Sir Matthew Davies, the Speaker of the Legislative
Assembly, to meet all the leading citizens of Victoria, and in the
same way I was most kindly received in every part of New Zealand,
Tasmania, and in Brisbane, the capital of Queensland. Personally I
have not found ? that the great contexture of the mysterious whole is
held together by letters of office and instructions and suspending
clauses,? any more than the dignity of a Governor is enhanced by
being helped first to soup at his own table. It seems to me, now,
that the time is gone past when a Governor in the Colonies or in


India is supposed to be a man with a mission to entertain globe-
trotters, though there appears still to be an impression among some
people in England that Government House is the only safe home-
stead. A Governor should understand from the first that he has a
duty to perform to the whole of the people. His life is not to be
one of narrow seclusion, punctuated by a few State functions. He
ought to do his best to enter heartily into the life of the country.
In addition to his political duties he should try as far as lies in his
power to encourage art and literature, and to try to understand and
aid the industries of the country. There is one duty of a specially
grave character which few Governors are so fortunate as to escape
?the terrible responsibility of having to decide as final arbitrator
in cases where the question of life or death is involved. As the law
now stands under our Constitution, a Governor, much as he may
desire it, can in no way relieve himself of the responsibility of say-
ing whether or not the prerogative of mercy may be exercised.
Should the Governor have fair and reasonable grounds for believing
that the extreme sentence of the law should not be carried out,
notwithstanding the strongly expressed opinion of the Court, not-
withstanding the advice given him by the Executive Council, it
would be, beyond all doubt, his duty to interfere, and by the exercise
of the prerogative of the Crown to save the life of a prisoner.
Ministers, in such a case, of course, would have a right to resign,
and their resignations would be accepted. What effect this resigna-
tion might have on the position of the person administering the
government this is not the time nor place to discuss, but one thing
is certain ?the prisoner?s life would be spared.
On the Governor alone does the terrible responsibility rest.
The prerogative of mercy which belongs to the Sovereign, and
which during the present reign has been delegated to the Home
Secretary in England, is vested solely and absolutely in him. His
decision is irrevocable, and it is against all precedent for the
Secretary of State to express any opinion on such matters.
Sir, the strong feeling of loyalty to the Crown and to your
dynasty is powerful in Australia, in the nations, in classes, and in
individuals. I know some people fear that the Colonies only seek
to obtain-from us advantage : that when they can afford to cut the
cable the knife will speedily be opened. I know some people fear
that this feeling of nationhood or patriotism must develop dislike
to the old country. How do these fears accord with the kindly and
generous feeling always shown to officers and men of Her Majesty?s
Navy by all classes, with the last two expressions of public feeling


in Australia ? Six years ago England was engaged in a tribal war,
and New South Wales suddenly volunteered to send troops to her
assistance. The war itself was unpopular, the offer was illegal; some
people in Australia went so far as to call it ridiculous ; and there
certainly was no crisis which necessitated sending 800 men to the
assistance of a nation which, besides owning the mightiest navy
ever known, has 140,000 regular troops, a large army reserve,
130,000 militia and yeomanry, and 250,000 volunteers, a country
which could in case of real necessity put a million fighting men
(many of whom had gone through the ranks) in six weeks into the
field. It was in reality what is so well described in an article of
the Sydney Daily Telegraph, as an ? impulsive interference in the
struggles of the Empire.? Whatever objection the offer might be
open to on the score of illegality or absence of impelling need,
England took it in the spirit in which it was made ; and such was
the feeling aroused'that a refusal would have meant the downfall of
the Government of the day; and now that' William Bede Dailey,
the gifted Irish Australian, who struck the sympathetic chord, has
gone from us, Englishmen have erected a memorial to his memory
close to the resting-places of Wellington and of Nelson, in the crypt
of the great cathedral which stands in the midst of the greatest city
which the world has ever seen.
Again, the news came out that the dock labourers in London had
struck for a small advance. It was feared that, eventually, 250,000
men might be thrown out of work. Taking four to a family, this
means a population nearly equal to that of New South Wales.
Again, suddenly, there burst out another ?impulsive interference with
the struggles of the Empire,? and was at once subscribed.
It was not a question of Socialism or of class antagonism that
moved Australia ; it was simply an honest outburst of sympathy and
pity for starving men, women, and children of their own race
struggling for bare existence. And this pity and this practical sym-
pathy, in Australia as well as in England, gave these poor creatures
courage in their trouble, and, no doubt, saved scenes of rioting, dis-
order, and violence.
A few days later the telegraph brought the news that a former
Prime Minister of England had used these words: ?The issue of
this strike is pregnant with hope for the future improved condition
of all classes of labour.? Was not the reflection that this young
nation had in a great measure contributed to so splendid a result
worthy of being a source of pride to them as Australians ? It is
work such as this which lays deep and broad the foundation of that


national pride which springs from one?s country?s good deeds, and
which enables us to rise high above all the arguments of Separatists
and Imperialists. An old Colonial Governor?Sir John Young?
hoped that when separation came it would be a peaceful one. I hope
and I believe that it will never come at all. Canada is Canadian
born, and remains loyal to the Crown, Australia will become Aus-
tralian born, and that is no reason why she should not remain loyal
to the Crown.
The Constitution Acts, as I understand them, were intended to
give, and did give, the right of self-government as freely and as
fully as in England ; and during the last quarter of a century the
Australian Colonies have settled down into regularly constituted
communities, and have acquired all the sense of confidence in their
power to manage for themselves. They consider that the age of
tutelage is over. They will not admit for a moment that they are
not as fully politically educated as the average English voter, and
they ask that they should be under no more restraint or control by
the Governor, as to purely local affairs, than the people of England
are by the Crown. ? If they were placed under such restraint they
would feel that they are more limited in their local self-government
than their brethren are at home.
And this semi-independent connection puzzles some people, who
think it cannot possibly last. A well-known American writer and
lecturer, lately on tour through Australia, has stated his opinion
that ? Australian loyalty to the Crown is not worth sixpence.? Is
he quite certain that he has grasped the significance of the word as
we understand it ? If it means a belief that the best form of
government is a semi-absolute sovereignty, either by Prince or by
President, with an irresponsible and irremovable Cabinet; if it
means that the world can best be governed by Kings and by States-
men, and not by the people themselves ; if it means belief in the
Divine right of Kings (and, as in England, the necessity for a State
Church),?he may be right. It may not be worth sixpence. But
if the word ?loyalty? has, as I believe it has, a far finer and purer
significance; if loyalty to the Queen means, not only our devotion
to the illustrious lady who so worthily wears the Crown, but also
respect for law and order, liberty and justice ; if it means, while
we boast and glory of our common origin, that also we rely on our
collective individuality, which is our common strength, with the
knowledge that ?where England extends her sceptre she also
pledges the defence of her sword ; ? ?then, as surely as to-morrow
the sun will rise on the earth, so will the Great British Confedera-


tion, which is already three times as large as Europe, and which
three times over exceeds the United States of Northern America in
bulk, revenue, and population, remain one?united, loyal, and
invincible?for all time.
General Sir Henry Norman, G.C.8., G.C.M.G., C.1.E.: I have
the greatest pleasure in fulfilling the duty which has been assigned
to me, which is to move a vote of thanks to Lord Carrington for
the paper he has just read to us. In Lord Carrington?s presence
I feel that my language must be restrained; but this I will say ?
that you must recollect that what you have just heard is the experi-
ence of one who has spent several years in Australia, who identified
himself with the people, and who left amid the general regrets, not
only of New South Wales, but, I may say, of the whole of Australia.
It certainly has never fallen to my lot to witness a more touching
and impressive scene than the farewell banquet given to Lord
Carrington in the magnificent Centennial Hall at Sydney at the
end of last October?a banquet which was given by all classes of
the community, from the sturdy labourer who earns his living by
the strength of his arm to the leaders of the Opposition of the
Ministry of New South Wales. Those who gave the banquet, and the
hundreds of ladies Avho graced the galleries round thehall, alike showed
the affection they felt towards Lord Carrington and towards Lady
Carrington, who had so well aided all his endeavours to fulfil his
high position as the representative of her Majesty in New South
Wales. It must be recollected that this was only one of several
banquets given to Lord Carrington, among which one of the most
remarkable was that given in his honour by the heads of the tAVO
Houses of Parliament of Victoria, Avith which Colony he had
officially no connection, but Avhich desired to shoAV appreciation of
his services as Governor of the neighbouring province. Lord
Carrington, aided, as I have said, by Lady Carrington, did much to
cement the feeling of loyalty to the CroAvn Avhich exists in Australia,
to increase the attachment to the Mother Country, and to make
Australians even more proud of the achievements of our forefathers
?our common ancestors. Lord Carrington is one of Avhat I may
call a band of Governors Avho are still young enough to do good
public service in this country, and Avho, from their position, Avill pro-
bably be able to exercise considerable influence in shaping the policy
of the Mother Country towards the Colonies, and they will be
always actuated by a kindly feeling to the Colonies. I venture to


look upon this as a great advantage, both to the Colonies and to
the Mother Country. Lord Carrington?s views may, I feel sure
be accepted with the greatest possible confidence. He made him-
self well acquainted with the feelings of the people of New South
Wales. I have heard the remark made that Governors cannot know
much about the people they govern; but I cannot accept that dictum.
It seems to me that a Governor who has his heart in his work, as Lord
Carrington had, must know a very great deal about the wishes, the
feelings, and the aspirations of the people; for he is constantly in
communication, personal and confidential communication, with the
ministers of the day and more or less with the leaders of
the different political parties; he sees a great many people
? and converses with them at Government House, and he makes
tours through the whole of his territory, and thus knows many
persons who live at a distance from the capital. He learns, 100,
a great deal of the various phases of public feeling through the
Press. Lord Carrington has gone through all these experiences.
I may say that, speaking generally, I am in accord with what he
has said, and that you will do well, at all events, carefully to weigh
it. Before I conclude I should like, as one who has been a soldier
most of his life, to say a word about the defensive forces of
Australia. You have there what is now almost an army of very
efficient material. The men are of fine physique, very zealous, very
loyal, and I am quite convinced that this force will have to be taken
into account alike by those who wish well to England and those
who wish her ill, and this army is certain to increase as well as to
improve in efficiency. In conclusion, I ask you to accept the
motion which I have the honour to propose.
Sir Saul Samuel, K.C.M.G., C.8.: It is with great pleasure I
second the resolution proposed by Sir Henry Norman. The paper
read by Lord Carrington is one of deep interest to me as representa-
tive in this country of New South Wales ; and I am certain the people
of the Colony will be most gratified when they read in the Sydney
papers to-morrow morning that Lord Carrington, although absent,
has not forgotten them, and that he has taken the earliest opportunity
to show that he takes a deep interest in all that concerns New
South -Wales. Lord Carrington has achieved a great success as
the representative of her Majesty in that Colony. He has not only
succeeded as an able administrator, but he and Lady Carrington have
won, in an eminent degree, the love and aftection of the people.
Whilst they sympathised with the people in their troubles, on the
other hand they entered heartily into their pleasures. The Colonists
K 2


are thoroughly English and love sport, and they had in their
Governor a thorough sportsman. No matter what the troubles of
the people were, Lord and Lady Carrington were always ready to
show their sympathy with them. On the occasion of two terrible
colliery accidents, when men were entombed with slight hope of
their release, Lord Carrington was on the spot encouraging, by his
presence, the men who were engaged in the attempt to rescue their
fellow-workmen from almost certain death. Again, when a serious
hood occurred in the Colony, which inundated the town of Bourke, so
as to place the whole township almost under water, Lord and Lady
Carrington left Sydney for the scene of the catastrophe, a distance
of nearly seven hundred miles, and on their arrival at Bourke Lord
Carrington stimulated the men in every way within his power to
renewed exertions to dam back the water which was rapidly over-
flowing the banks of the river, threatening the whole town with
destruction. Lady Carrington at the same time did her best to
encourage and cheer in their trouble the women and children who
had been compelled to leave their homes and take temporary refuge
on the higher land. With these generous impulses, it is not sur-
prising that Lord and Lady Carrington should have endeared them-
selves to the people of the Colony. This is not an occasion to dis-
cuss the interesting paper which has been road to us, but I may be
permitted to say that I cordially concur in the views expressed by
Lord Carrington. He has spoken of the loyalty of the people of the
Colony. I can only repeat what I have before said, that the
Colonists are far more demonstrative in their loyalty than are the
people of the Mother Country. On the birthdays of our beloved
Queen and of our Royal President, the Colonists give themselves up
to rejoicing, making those anniversaries complete holidays. I wil
not detain you any longer, but must again express my thanks to
Lord Carrington for his most interesting and able paper.
The Pkesident : My?task is a very easy one. I have to put
before you the motion proposed by Sir Henry Norman and seconded
by Sir Saul Samuel, that a vote of thanks be given to the reader
of the paper. I feel sure this will be received with acclamation.
The motion was cordially approved, and Lord Carrington bowed
his acknowledgments.
Lord Knutsfoed, G.O.M.G. (Secretary of State for the
Colonies): Ido not rise for the purpose of discussing the very able
paper to which we have just listened, but I must protest against
one thing, and that was the emphasis which the noble lord gave to
the paragraph from the Brisbane Courier, attacking the Secretary


of State for the Colonies, and which he twice read out. (Laughter.)
Very few words are necessary to commend to you the vote entrusted
to me, viz. a vote of thanks to his Royal Highness for presiding
this evening. Perhaps no one is in a better position than the Secre-
tary of State for the Colonies for the time being to observe and
appreciate the interest and sympathy which his Royal Highness has
invariably taken in Colonial affairs. Nor has his Royal Highness
contented himself with a mere expression of these feelings. He has by
his good work given to them, if I may say so, ? a local habitation
and a name.? This you know from his work in connection with the
Imperial Institute, the creation of which, as well as the building up
and organisation of which are due to him. The interest and great
success of the Colonial and Indian Exhibition were mainly duo to
his watchful attention even to minor details; and again there is his
work in ( connection with this Royal Colonial Institute. I may also
remind you that his Royal Highness accepted the honorary
presidency of the successful exhibition in Victoria, and he attended
?which honorary presidents seldom do ?every important meeting
of the committee sitting in this country to look after the interests
of that exhibition. It is a great matter of satisfaction to me
personally that his Royal Highness Prince George has been
allowed by his Royal Highness to open to-morrow the exhibition in
Jamaica ?an exhibition which I hope and believe will be a great
success, and one which will tend largely to promote the interests
of our West Indian Colonies. I could say more, but Ido not think
his Royal Highness would desire to hear more, and I certainly have
said more than enough to justify, if any justification were needed,
your unanimous assent to this vote. I beg to propose a hearty vote
of thanks to his Royal Highness for presiding this evening.
Earl Granville, K.G. (a Vice-President of the Royal Colonial
Institute): It is not only a great honour, but it is a great pleasure
to me to second this resolution. And I feel the pleasure is not
altogether taken away by the insinuation that I am tarred with the
same brush?though not to the same extent ?as my noble friend
Lord Knutsford?(laughter)?who admits having some connection
with the Colonial Office. I have really little to add to what has
been said m support of this resolution. I am not quite sure that
his Royal Highness would contradict me when I say I think it
would be possible somewhat to exaggerate the self-sacrifice which
his Royal Highness has undergone in being here to-day. We know
the Prince of Wales?s public spirit and intelligence ; we know that
he has visited most of the important dependencies of the Crown ;


that he possesses a memory which never forgets those whom ho
has seen, or the tilings he has seen or those which he has heard ;
and we all must acknowledge the dignity, energy, and simplicity
with which he has thrown himself into those peculiar duties which
fall to his lot. If that is the case with regard. to the interest and
the pleasure which he feels in matters connected with the great
dependencies of the Empire, I think that must be especially the case
on this occasion. His Royal Highness, like ourselves, is present to
welcome Lord Carrington. His Royal Highness, was, I believe,
one of those who strongly encouraged one who is his personal
friend to undertake the great responsibility attaching to the repre-
sentative of the Sovereign in a distant Colony, and therefore I feel
that his Royal Highness must in an especial degree feel pleased at
being present on this occasion. Be that as it may, it does not affect
our sense of the geniality with which his Royal Highness comes
forward on all these occasions, and of which he has given some
proof this evening.
The vote was carried with great enthusiasm.
The President : The excessively kind manner in which Lord
Knutsford and Lord Granville have brought forward this vote of
thanks has deeply touched me, and I have also to return you my
very sincere thanks for the manner in which you have so kindly
received it. We have heard an interesting paper to-night, and wo
have since heard remarks from four distinguished gentlemen, andi
is difficult for me therefore to add much to what they have said. But
I am glad to have an opportunity, first of all, of welcoming an old
friend of nearly forty years? standing back from the government of
one of our most important Colonies, and at the same time of con-
gratulating him on the great success that has attended his five years?
administration of that Colony. In the address which he has given
us there is much interesting matter. There may be points open to
controversy, but it would be wrong, and unnecessary, for me to
touch upon them. I think we have this evening heard a good
account of that Colony. We know the great interest that Lord
Carrington has taken in it, how he has identified himself with its
people and with its institutions, and now he has brought home to
us the welcome intelligence that the important Colony is still in
touch with us, retaining its loyalty to the Crown and to the Mother
Country. Long may that feeling, ladies and gentlemen, exist!
Though we wish our Colonial possessions to be independent and
free, we are proud to think that they have not forgotten whence they
came, nor that the interests of those great Colonies are entirely
one with those of Great Britain.
