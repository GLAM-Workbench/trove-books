PREFACE.
MS^jpiozio
frs-nn
The following Abridgement of the Author’s Geography
and History of Oceania has been undertaken on the
recommendation of teachers and others interested in
Education. The interest excited by the original work,
the eulogiums passed by the Colonial Press, the
approbation of competent judges, and its increasing sale,
are sufficient proofs of its acceptahleness. To meet the
demand for copies, a second edition is in preparation, in
which the inaccuracies unavoidable in the first edition
will be rectified, and deficiencies supplied. That work,
however, though forming an excellent Class-book for
advanced pupils, and supplying to teachers a fund of
information, has been found too elaborate for junior
classes. In producing the present Manual, the Author
has endeavoured to respond to the numerous expressions
of opinion from various parts of the Australian Colonies
as to the desirableness of such an Abridgement. The
matter has been carefully revised, and the topography of
Victoria compiled chiefly from Venables’ School Map, just
published. The Author is under obligations to the
New Zealand Press, and to several gentlemen
personally acquainted with the Geography of the
respective Colonies, for their suggestions and valuable
information.

OCEANIA
Oceania, the fifth great division of the earth’s surface,
includes the numerous islands scattered over the great
ocean which extends from the south-eastern shores of
Asia to the western coast of America. It is separated
from Asia by the Str. of Malacca, the Chinese Sea, and
the Channel of Formgsa ; and from America, hy a broad
belt of ocean comparatively free of islands. It naturally
divides itself into three great sections: —Malaysia,
Australasia, and Polynesia;—the aggregate area of
which is estimated at upwards of 4,500,000 sq. m.
Race. — Dr. Latham, Cuvier, and other celebrated
ethnologists have reduced the five primary varieties of
mankind to three :—the Japetidse, embracing all the chief
nations of Europe and the various states and colonies
established by them ; the Atlantidse—the tribes of Africa,
Syria, and Arabia; and the Mongolidto—the nations of
Asia, Oceania, and America.
The Aboelgixal Races of Oceania exhibit two
types the Alai ay, or brown complexioned and straight-
haired race ; and the Negrito, of a sooty black colour,
with hair sometimes straight, in other cases frizzy or
even woolly.
The Negritos extend over New Guinea, Australia,
Tasmania, New Ireland, the islands between it and New
Caledonia, and, according to some, the Eijis,


The brown division occupy the rest of the Oceanic
area:—Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Moluccas, Polynesia, &c.
Each of these divisions falls into a great number of
subdivisions.
Hlalagsiit, or % %n\xfkp.
This division takes its name from the Malays, who ane
the principal inhabitants, and includes the archipelago
immediately adjoining the south-eastern coasts of Asia,
generally known as the East India Is. It lies betweem
lat. 12° 40' S. and 20° IST., and long. 95° and 134° Eh,

REMARKS.
Sumatra is 1,050 miles long, and is 3 times larger than England.
The chief exports are —rice, coffee, pepper and camphor. Off the south-
east coast are the islands of Banca and Billiton, held by the Dutch,
and possessing exceedingly rich tin mines.
Java extends 660 miles from W. to E., contains a population of
10,000,000, and in area is nearly equal to England. Exports ; —coffee,
rice, tea, sugar, cinnamon, pepper, and teat timber.
Boeneo’, 250 miles N. of Java, is about times larger than Gt. Britain,
Coal, iron, gold, diamonds, and other minerals, are abundant. On the
north-west coast of Borneo is the island of Lahuan, established as a
British colony in 1846, and possessing rich coal mines.
The Philippine Is., about 1,200 in number, were discovered by
Magellan 1521. Their aggregate area is twice that of England, and
the population amounts to nearly 4,000,000. Exports: —rice, sugar, and
tobacco.
The coasts of the Celebes and the other islands in the east of Malaysia
have pearl fisheries, and furnish the tripang or sea-slug, and edible birds’-
nests, both of which are much prized by the epicures of China.
The Moluccas produce spices, nutmegs, cloves, maize, &c.
The Dutch possess the whole of Java, the Moluccas, and the greater
part of Sumatra and the Celebes; the Spaniards, the greater part of the
Philippine group ; the Portuguese, a portion of the island of Timor ; and
the British, the peninsula of Malacca, and the islands of Singapore,
Labuan, and Prince of Wales.
Straits. — Str. of Malacca (50 miles wide), between
Sumatra and Malacca (a territory of about 1,000 sq. m.
belonging.to the British) ; Str. of Sunda (25 m.), between
Sumatra and Java ; Str. of Macassar (70 m.), between
Borneo and Celebes ; Molucca Passage, between the
Moluccas and Celebes.
Physical Peathees, Soil, ahd Climate,— The
islands are throughout of a mountainous nature, the
highest point being Mt, Ophir (13,050), in Sumatra;
and the archipelago is traversed by several lines of
volcanic action, which exhibits itself in the burning
craters of Luzon, Java, &c. There are few extensive
plains, abundance of jungle and unhealthy swamps, but
no arid deserts ; and, where not cultivated, the better
land is generally covered with forests of stupendous
trees, and with shrubs and aromatic plants of the most
luxuriant growth. Winds. —The north-east and south-
west monsoons IN’, of the Equator, and the south-east and
north-west monsoons S. of it; typhoons in the IN’.


Pp.oductions. —Malaysia is rich in every species of
tropical produce.
The indigenous Animals are —the elephant, rhino-
cerous, habyrousa, tapir, tiger, buffalo, bat, pongo,
ourang-outang and other quadrumana. Birds: Cassowary,
bird of paradise, parrot, parroquet, cockatoo. Beptiles :
Crocodile, pythou, and chameleon.
Vegetables. — Trees: Palms (cocoa-nut, sago, and
cabbage palms), camphor-tree, sandal-wood, and ebony-
trees, teak, bamboo, and upas-tree. The delicious
■Fruits are—the mango, guava, &c.
Minerals. —Gold, tin, antimony, copper, iron, coal,
diamonds, and other precious stones.
Population. —2o,ooo,ooo.
Eeligion. —The more advanced of the Malays,
especially those that live on the coasts, profess
Mahometanism, which was introduced in the fourteenth
century ; but the superstitions of the wilder tribes in the
interior very much resemble those of the Polynesians.
Ipolraesiit, or % J?mii!j Jib Ifslank
Polynesia includes the numerous groups of islands
scattered aver the Pacific Ocean within 30° on both sides
of the Equator, and between the meridional lines of
133° E. and 109° AV. long.
The following are the principal groups : —In the
'Northern Hemisphere :—The Carolines, including the
Pelew Is., in the AV ; the Marianne or Ladrone Is.,
of the Carolines; the Marshall and Gilbert Is.,
E. of the Carolines ; the Sandwich Is., ICE. of the
Marshall and Gilbert Is.; and the numerous reefs and
coral islands scattered over the Northern Pacific, and
designated Micronesia.


In the Southern Hemisphere :—The Fijia, in tlie AY.;
the Friendly Is., including the group of the Tonga Is.,
E. of the Fijis ; the Samoan, or Navigator’s Is., N. of
the Friendly Is.; Hervey or Cook’s Is., E. of the
Friendly Is. ; the Society Is., including the Georgian or
Tahitian and Austral Is., E. of Hervey’s group ; the
Low Is. or Dangerous Arch 0 ., including the Gatnbier or
Mangareva group, E. of the Society Is. ; the Marquesas,
N. of tlie Low Is.; Pitcairn’s 1., S.E. of the Low Is.; Easter
1., E. of Pitcairn’s I.
REMARKS.
These islands are divided into two classes as to their natural structure :
the mountainous, which are mostly of volcanic formation ; and the coral,
which are mostly low reefs, only raised a few feet above the level of the
sea. The mountainous islands are—the Sandwich, Ladrone, Society,
Marquesas, and some of the Pigi, Friendly, Samoan, and Hervey Is.
The Caroline Is., named after Charles 11. of Spain, form a vast
group lying nearly midway between Japan and Australia, and extending
E. and W. through a distance of 2,500 miles.
TheLADEONES, discovered by Magellan in 1521, and so called from
the thievish disposition of the natives, are situated about 500 miles N.
of the Carolines and 1,400 E. of the Philippine Is.
The Sandwich Is. (discovered by Capt. Cook, 1778), in consequence
of their proximity to the whaling grounds, and their geographical
position—the natural centre of the commerce between South America,
India, China, California, and Australia—form the most important group
of This group consists of ten volcanic islands, of which
Hawaii, Maui, Oahu, and Kauai are the principal. Hawaii, the death-
place of Capt. Cook, is remarkable for its towering volcanoes; Mouna
Roa, of which a terrible eruption took place in 1855, being 13,650 feet
high. Honolulu, in Oahu, is the capital, and possesses a spacious and
secure harbour, the resort of numerous whalers and merchant vessels.
The Tongan, or Friendly Group, discovered by Tasman in 1643,
and so named by Capt. Cook from the apparent friendliness of the natives,
and the Samoan or Navigator’s Group, so called from the superior canoes
which the natives used, and the dexterous way in which they managed
them, lie from 1,500 to 2,000 miles E. of Northern Australia.
The Hervey Is. were discovered by Capt. Cook 1773-7. Raratonga,
the largest, was the scene of the labours of the missionary Williams.
The Society, the Marquesas, the Georgian or Tahitian Is., and
several ot the adjoining groups, which are now subject to Prance, lie
still further east, and occupy a central position in the Pacific, about
1,300 miles S. of the Equator. Tahiti, or Otaheite, the first place in
Polynesia to which Christian missionaries were sent, is the largest, being
108 miles in circumference. It is a beautiful island, and, with its lofty
verdant mountains, presents a striking appearance from the sea.
Here the memorable mutiny of the Bounty took place in 1790.
The mutineers settled (1790) on Pitcairn’s 1., which formed the abode of
their descendants till their removal to Norfolk I. (1856).


The Soil is in general exceedingly fertile, and the
Climate delightful. Winds. —Land and sea breezes,
with occasional hurricanes.
Productions. —The indigenous quadrupeds are the
hog, dog, and rat; the ox and horse have been imported.
The Birds are numerous, consisting of poultry, pigeons,
turtle-doves, as well as parrots and other tropical genera.
Vegetable Products. —Bread-fruit, sugar-cane, cocoa-
nut, banana, pandanus, plantain, and a variety of tropical
fruits ; the taro, yam, batata, and other farinaceous roots.
Polynesia is deficient in minerals.
Australasia lies S.E. ’ of Malaysia, and consists of
the great island of Australia, or Hew Holland, with its
appendage Tasmania, and the belt of islands that lie H.,
H. E., and S.E. of it. The chief islands forming this
belt are Papua, or Hew Guinea, H. of Australia, and the
various groups of islands lying to the E. and S.E. of
Hew Guinea, viz.—Louisiade Archipelago, Hew Britain,
Admirality Is., Hew Ireland, Solomon’s Is., Queen
Charlotte’s Isles, Hew Hebrides, Hew Caledonia, Horfolk
I. Hew Zealand, Chatham Is., and Auckland Is.
Between the northern section of the belt and the coast
of Australia is the Coralline Sea.
Papua, about 1,300 miles in length, with an area of
260,000 sq. m., presents ranges of very high mountains
(chief summit, Mt. Stanley, 13,205), and is described as
a rich and magnificent country, containing in all pro-
bability, from its situation and appearance, the most
valuable vegetable products of the Malaysian Is.
The only quadrupeds known to exist on this island
are dogs, rats, and wild hogs; but the feathered race


are of great beauty and infinite variety. New Guinea
is the native place of the bird of paradise, the crown
pigeon, parrots, lories, and minas.
Of the other islands forming the northern section of
the belt, New Caledonia, recently taken possession of
by the French, is the largest, being 400 m. long, though
not more than 60 broad. They generally have mountains
of great height in the interior, many of them being
active volcanoes. The lower grounds are fertile; and
there are dogs, pigs, and fish, in abundance.
The Chatham Is., E., and the Auckland, Campbell, and
Macquarie Is., S. of New Zealand, are stations for the
South Sea fisheries of the elephant, seal, and whale.
The British possessions in Australasia are—Australia,
Tasmania, New Zealand, Chatham Is. (situated about
300 miles E. of New Zealand), Auckland Is. (about 180
miles S. of New Zealand), and Norfolk I. (about
900 m. _ N.E, of Sydney) : the whole comprising
a territorial area in the southern hemisphere nearly as
large as Europe.
Government. Since the year 1855, all the
Australian Colonies (with the exception of 'Western
Australia) have, under the sanction of the Queen and
the Imperial Parliament, enjoyed the privilege of self-
government in respect to local interests, upon a system
modelled as nearly as circumstances would admit upon
the plan of the British constitution.
In each colony the government is vested in a
Governor and his responsible ministers (forming the
Executive), and a Parliament consisting of a Legislative
Council and a Legislative Assembly.
In each there is a supreme court for the sole
administration of the laws ; there are also courts of
general and quarter sessions and courts of requests.
Juries sit both in civil and criminal cases.
In Western Australia the Government consists of
the Governor and the Executive and Legislative Councils ;
and in New Zealand, of a Governor, Legislative Council,
and House of Representatives. In the latter colony


each province has a Superintendent and a Provincial
Council. The Governor, Legislative Council, and House of
Representatives, legislate for the whole colony, with the
exception of matters of purely local interest, which are
left to the Provincial Councils. The principles of
responsible government are carried out as in England,
both in the general and the provincial governments.
The Chatham and Auckland Is. are under the
protection of the government of New Zealand, and
Norfolk I. under that of New South Wales.
Religion.— All the denominations of the Mother-
country are represented nearly in the same proportion as
at home ; the principal sects being—Episcopalians,
Roman Catholics, Presbyterians, Wesleyans, Baptists,
and Independents. All classes, of whatever creed, are
on an equality, and enjoy equal privileges ; and where
State-aid is granted, all are equally entitled to
participate.
Education".— Education has been for some years a
matter of primary consideration with the colonists.
Great efforts have been made to render the means of
mental improvement accessible to even the lowest classes
of society. Several colleges have been established; and
numerous excellent seminaries, including pri vate, national,
and denominational schools, are well attended. The
national and denominational schools receive Government
aid, and are under the direction of Boards, and the
supervision of Inspectors appointed by the Boards.
H us t cilia.
Australia, the largest island in the world, is bounded
on the W. and N.W. by the Indian Ocean ; on the N,"
by the Arafura Sea, G. of Carpentaria, and Torres Str, ;


on the E. by the Pacific Ocean ; and on the S. by Pass’s
Str. and the Pacific or, according to some, the Indian
Ocean. It lies between the parallels of 10° 45' and
38° 45' S. lat., and the meridians of 112° 20' and 153° 30'
E. long. Its greatest length (from E. to W.) is 2,227,
and its breadth (from C. York to Wilson’s Promontory)
1,680 geographical miles. Area, 2,690,810 sq. m.
The several colonies in Australia are —E. of the 141st
degree of E. longitude —Victoria, in the S.; New S. Wales,
N. of Victoria; and Queensland, N. of New South Wales.
The other colonies are—South Australia, W. of Victoria,
New South Wales, and the southern part of Queensland ;
and Western Australia, comprising all that portion of
the island W. of 129° E. long. In the undivided and
unsettled region, lying between Western Australia and
Queensland, and N. of the 26th parallel, settlements
were formed on Melville I. and Coburg Peninsula, but were
abandoned, chiefly on account of the unhealthiness of the
climate and the sterile character of the soil.
Pats and Guiles. — On the A r ., G. of Carpentaria,

on the W. coast, Dirk Hartog’s I,
The Barrier Keeps, on the N. and N.E. coasts of
Australia, form a vast submarine buttress which skirt the
shore, and, in the instance of the Great Barrier Keef,
extend from Breaksea Spit, in 21° 30' S. lat., to Bristow
I. on the coast of New Guinea, a distance of about 1,100
geographical miles. Numerous detached reefs extend
from Torres Str. to New Caledonia.
Peninsulas.— York Pen., E. of G. of Carpentaria;
Coburg Pen., N. of Arnhem Land ; Per on Pen., between
Ereycinet and Hamelin Harbours ; Eyria Pen., on the
W., and Yorke Pen. on the E. of Spencer’s G.
GREAT PHYSICAL FEATURES OF AUSTRALIA.
As far as the country is known, a long mountain chain
runs along the whole eastern coast, crossing Bass’s Str.
into Tasmania, and running under Torres Str. to the
shores of New Guinea, a distance of about 2,400 geo-
graphical miles ; its submarine continuation in Bass and
Torres’ Straits being indicated by a line of steep, rugged,
and often peaked islands.
Plains. — On the landward or western side of this
chain are great plains, declining gradually to the W., but
at first often broken by detached hills or groups of mts.
Still farther AY. appear immense desert plains, which
seem to extend from the sea-coast round the G. of Car-
pentaria on the N. to that of the Gt. Australian Bight
on the S., and to stretch along the N. AY. coast from
N.AY. Cape to Collier B.
As Minor Features may be mentioned—the spur 1
stretching westward through' Yictoria from the main
dividing range; the mt. chain of S. Australia, running N.


from C. Jervis to the singular horse-shoe-shaped depression
of L.Torrens; the high land of Western Australia running
N. from Pt. D’Entrecasteaux and King George’s Sound
to the neighbourhood of Shark B.; and the high land
which forms the coast from Collier’s B. to Wickham’s
Victoria IE, and seems to stretch in an E. and W. direc-
tion across the interior of Arnhem Land to the western
shores of the G. of Carpentaria.
Biters. — Draining the Landward Slope. —Towards the
S., the B. Murray and its numerous tributaries, dischar-
ging their waters into L. Victoria or Alexandrina ; further
north, the Victoria 8., which drains into Sturt’s Central
Desert, and in seasons of flood probably reaches L.
Torrens ; and several small rivers, which, on the N., run
into the S.E. portion of the Gr. of Carpentaria.
Draining the. Outer or Seaward Slope.—ln New South
Wales, the Hawkesbury, Hunter, Mailing, Macleay, and
Clarence; in Queensland, the Barnett, Eitzroy, and
Burdekin ; in Arnhem Land, the South Alligator, and
Wickham’s Victoria B. ; in Western Australia, the
G-ascoyne, Murchison, Swan, and Blackwood.
Lakes. —Australia is remarkably destitute of large
fresh-water lakes: L. Victoria, the principal, is merely a
brackish lagoon. There are, however, numerous small
salt lakes sprinkled over its southern portion.
Climate. —The climate of all the colonies and all the
coasts of Australia, is remarkable for its dryness and for
its long droughts. Though great rains fall occasionally,
they are irregular and partial. The only large rivers at
present known are those draining the western slope of
the Dividing Eange ; and of these the only one having a
permanent stream is the Murray, from the only mt.
summits (the Australian Alps) that are permanently
covered with snow. The climate of the whole territory,
however, is remarkably salubrious, excepting on the X.
and N.W. coasts, which partake of the unhealthiness of
a tropical region. The general direction of the winds
on the W., S.W., S., and S.E. coasts being from the sea,
the temperature is delightful. On the Blue Mountains


in New- South Wales, and on the Australian Alps in
Victoria, snow falls in winter, and it freezes there for
several months.
Soil. —The general character of the soil of the northern,
north-western, and central portions of Australia, is sterile
and arid. (For soil of the colonized districts, see N. S.
Wales, &c.)
PRODUCTIONS.
Quadrupeds. —With the exception of the native dog
or dingo, three species of bat, two mice, and one water-
rat, ail the mammals of Australia are either marsupial
(pouched), or monotrematous (a closely-allied form).
Of the former the principal are —the tiger-cat, native-cat,
kangaroo (forester, brush,and wallaby), wombat, opossum,
and bandicoot; to the latter belong the platypus, or
ornithorhynchus, and two species of porcupine.
Of Birds may be mentioned —the king-fisher, bee-eater,
and humming-bird; parrots, paroquets, cuckoos, and
cockatoos ; vulture, white eagle, falcon, and hawk; several
varieties of thrush (one of which is sometimes called the
“laughing jackass”), and wattle-bird ; swallows and goat-
suckers ; pheasants, quails, and pigeons; the cassowary
or emu ; bustard, curlew, ibis, herons, rails, snipes, and
spoon-bills; black swan, gannet, penguin, petrel, duck,
magpies, crow, bird of paradise, &c.
Fisn.—Fish are plentiful in the bays along the coast,
but are not so abundant in the rivers. The principal are—
of salt-water fish —schnapper, rock-cod, flat-head, taylor-
fish, mackerel, sole, and guardfish; of fresh-water —the
Murray cod, found in the li. Murray, and eels, caught in
the marshes and lagoons ; of Crustaceans —lobsters, crabs,
cray-fish, prawns, and shrimps ; of Molluscs —oysters,
muscles, cockles, periwinkles, whelks.
Seals and whales are found in the neighbouring seas, and
the dugong abounds in the bays and harbours of tropical
Australia.
The Beptiles consist of turtles, iguanas,
lizards, serpents, and frogs ; and the Insects , of butter-


flies, moths, beetles, locusts, mosquitos, scorpions, centi-
pedes, flies, ants, bees, and an insect called the gum-
grub.
The most valuable Trees are—the gum-trees, wattles,
the cedar or turpentine tree, she-oak, forest-oak,
sassafras, and the Norfolk Island pine.
HISTORY OF DISCOVERY.
The first attempt to explore this island is unquestionably
due to the Dutch, whose vessels, during the period
1016-22, discovered the west coast from 35° to 22°
S. lat., and (1627) 1000 m. of the S. coast, which they
named Nuyt’s Land. The English navigator, William
Dampier, in 1686, and again in 1699, explored the N.W.
coast. Capt. Cook, in 1770, explored the whole E. coast,
from C. Howe to C. York, not minutely entering into
the details of every part, but laying down a correct
general outline. To Capt. Elinders we owe the comple-
tion in detail of the coasts of Australia, with the exception
of the AY. and N.W. coasts, which he was prevented
from accomplishing by the loss of his ship. In 1837,
the anchorages and harbours in the immediate vicinity
of the Swan Eiver settlement were correctly laid down ;
and detailed charts of the coast from King George’s
Sound to Mellville Harbour were furnished by AYickham,
who was entrusted with the duty of conducting a minute
survey of all the Australian coast which Elinders had
left unsurveyed. He was succeeded in 1839 by Mr.
Stokes, who continued zealously employed in this important
duty until 1813.
Explorations in the Interior. —ln 1813, Mr.
Evans prosecuted two successful journeys across the
Blue Mts., to the distance of about 300 m. AY. of Sydney,
and discovered the Bathurst Plains, and again, in 1815,
traced the course of the Macquarie 115 miles from its
source. In 1816, Mr. Oxley extended the discoveries of
Evans, and (1823) surveyed the districts of Aloreton 8.,
Hervey 8., and Port Curtis. In 1821-5 explorations
were actively pursued to a like distance southward by


Messrs. Hovell and Hume, who passed over a most ex-
tensive range of country, from the junction of the Mur-
rumbidgee and Yass rivers to the north-western shore
of Port Phillip. In 1825, Allan Cunningham prosecuted
a successful exploration up the valley of the Hunter,
travelled (1827) over the beautiful table-land known as
the Liverpool Plains, traversed a fine grazing country
called Hew England, and discovered the verdant prairie-
lands of Darling Downs. Sturt, by his researches
(1828-31), discovered the Darling, and ascertained that,
instead of the Darling, Lachlan, and other streams, that
run to the westward, falling into a great inland sea or
extensive marsh, as was conjectured, their united waters
constitute a large river, which, under, the name of the
Murray, was found to turn to the southward, and empty
itself into an extensive estuary. About the same period,
several expeditions under Capt. Banister, Capt. Grey,
and others, were prosecuted in Western Australia. Sir
T. Mitchell surveyed (1832-6) the Darling and its tri-
butaries, and explored Australia Eelix (a part of Victoria).
Strzelecki made a successful journey on foot (1840-5)
through Hew South AVales and Tasmania to ascertain
their physical and geological character. In 1840, Eyre
travelled through the territory called Huyt’s Land, and
(1841) conducted an expedition towards the interior
from Spencer’s Gulf, when he discovered L. Torrens.
Capt. Sturt (1844-5-6), from Adelaide, penetrated due
north into the very centre of the island. In 1844, Dr.
Leichardt, a botanist, crossed overland from Moreton B.
to Port Essington; and (1846) Sir T, Mitchell, in his
search for a good practical line of road to the nearest
part of the Indian Ocean, to the westward of Torres Str.,
toward the Gr. of Carpentaria, discovered a river which he
named the Victoria. Mr. Cunningham, who accompanied
this expedition, fell into .the hands of the natives, by whom
he was barbarously murdered.
Mr. Kennedy, while prosecuting (1848) the survey of
that part of tropical Australia situated between C. York
and Buckingham 8,, was massacred by the natives ; and
Dr. Leichardt, in his attempt (1848) to penetrate to the


westward across the great desert to the settlement of
Swan River, also perished.
The principal expeditions that have since been under-
taken for exploring the interior are —the North
Australian expeditions of 1856-8, and Stuart’s (from S.
Australia), and the Victorian, under Burke, 1860.

Climate.— The climate is varied, but highly salubrious,
particularly in the inland districts.
Soil. —The character of the soil is very diverse, there
being lands of the very best, and others of the very
worst description ; but generally speaking, the lands
on the eastern streams are inferior in quality, both for
agriculture and pasture, to those on the western rivers—
the latter consisting of a rich black mould and dry soil,
covered with luxuriant herbage, on which the herds and
flocks of the settlers graze.


PRODUCTIONS.
Animals. —(For the indigenous animals, see
Austealia).
Imported Stock, Poultry, Sfc. —Horses, horned cattle,
sheep, pigs, goats, Timor ponies, camels ; domestic fowls
of every description, and various singing birds.
Vegetable. —The agricultural products are—wheat,
barley, oats, and rye, with hay, lucerne, and other kinds
of fodder for cattle and horses; and in the northern
districts —maize, tobacco, and cotton. The culinary vege-
tables are —potatoes, cabbages, carrots, parsnips, turnips,
onions, peas, beans, cauliflowers, lettuces, cucumbers,
pumpkins, artichoke, &c., besides sweet potatoes, yams,
and plantains.
Eeuits. — Peaches, apricots, nectarines, loquats, oranges,-
grapes, pears, plums, figs, pomegranates, raspberry,
strawberry, mulberries, and melons of all sorts, attain
the highest degree of maturity in the open air. Added
to these, the northern districts produce pine-apples,
bananas, almonds, guavas, lemons, citrons, and other
tropical fruits.
Minerals. —The principal mineral products are —gold,
coal, iron, and copper.
The real practical discovery of gold in Australia
was made by Mr. E. H. Hargraves, a N. S.
Wales colonist, who, having been for some time in
California, returned to the colony for the express
purpose of searching for gold, which he discovered in
the Bathurst district, west from Sydney, in the spring of
1851. The gold-fields are the Western (the most
productive), the Southern, and the Northerp. The
Western are—Sofala, Louisa Creek, Bathurst, Tamba-
roora, Mudgee, Orange, Stony Creek; the Southern—
Goulbourn, Tumberumba, Gundagai, and Meragle ; and
the Northern —Pocky Piver, Nundle, Tam worth, and
Timbarra. Sofala and Louisa Creek are the most
productive of the western, Braidwood and Tumut of the
Southern, and Nundle of the Northern. The quantity
of gold received by escort from the gold-fields (1859),
Was 287,797 oz., valued at £1,103,009. The gold is


found by washing the surface-detritus of the water-runs
and digging holes into the strata overlying the so-called
pipe-clay. Another source is the quartz-rock, which is now
crushed to extract the gold. Large masses of pure gold
are sometimes found embedded in the quartz.
The principal coal-bearing locality extends over the
Hunter K. basin, —the coal measures of that locality
occupying an area of at least 200 sq. m.
Iron abounds in various parts of the colony. Most
of the smaller streams and fossil-trees lately discovered
are stongly impregnated with it. The fields or rather
rocks of ironstone surrounding the Pitzroy iron-works
in the neighbourhood of Camden, about 70 m, distant
from Sydney, spread over a large area. The ore is of
such extrordinary richness that it can at once be
manufactured at the forge.
Copper is obtained in the mountain ranges around
Bathurst.
Freestone is obtained in the vicinity of Sydney, the
tract between the Blue Mts. and the coast being
occupied by extensive plains of sandstone, lying nearly
in.- a horizontal position ; whinstone or basalt, with
which the roads are metalled, from the Blue Mts. ;
beautiful grained marble (greatly in request for chimney-
pieces, &c.), in Argyle county; potters’ clay and rock
porcelain, N. of Sydney harbour.
| Ageicultuee.—The objects of culture are —wheat,
maize, hay, potatoes, oats, barley, vines, sorghum, imphee,
&c. The pastoral grounds are very extensive, especially
W. of the Dividing Eange: about 17,000,000 fbs. of
wool are annually obtained from the flocks.
The Manufactuees are in a flourishing condition;
the principal are —flour, sugar, tallow, wine and brandy,
woollens, tweeds, soap and candles, tobacco, butter and
cheese, leather, &c.
Towns famous for their woollen manufactures ;
Sydney, Parramatta, Penrith, and Hartley.
The whale and seal fisheries are also prosecuted.


Commence. —The chief Exports are —gold, Wool, coal,
live stock, grain, provisions, hides and leather, oil, timber,
tallow, and wine. Imports. —British manufactured goods,
sugar, tea, spirits, gold, hardware, grain, wool, wine,
tobacco, &c.
Principal Ports. —Sydney, Newcastle, and Eden.
P0pu1ati0n.— 336,572; troops allotted to New
South Wales, 906. '
Finance. — Eevenue (1859), £2,339,490 ; Expenditure,
£1,858,168 ; Public Debt, £3,519,530.
HISTORY.
After the separation of the United States from Gt.
Britain, it was determined to establish a colony for the
reception of British convicts on the eastern shore of
Australia. The first settlement was formed early in 1788,
on the south shore of Port Jackson, under Capt. Phillip
as Governor. The principal incidents in the history of
this colony are—the arrival, during the administration of
Capt. Hunter, of the New South Wales Corps, and of
capitalists and other free settlers from England; the
rebellion (1802) of the convicts stationed at Castlehill; and
the deposition of Capt. Bligh by the New South Wales
Corps. During the administration of Governor
Macquarie great progress was made : the population, free
and bond, increased ; public buildings were erected at the
expense of the British Government; roads were constructed
by means of convict labour ; government farms were
established ; and the Bathurst country explored. Under
his successor the liberty of the press was recognised; and
during the administration of Sir Geo. Gipps, the
proceedings of the Legislative Council were thrown open
to the public; an act for regulating the occupation of
Crown Lands knoivn as the Squatting Act was passed
(March 22nd, 1833), and transportation discontinued.
Early in 1841, a great public meeting was held in Sydney,
for the purpose ol adopting petitions to the Queen and
British Parliament for a representative Legislature. In
1842, two very important measures came into operation,—


the incorporation of the city of Sydney, and the adoption
of Wakefield’s system of bounty emigration. On the
Ist Jan., 1843, the Glovemor received the Constitutional
Act, by which a Legislative Council was constituted,
partly elective, partly non-elective.
During the same year, the colony experienced unusual
commercial embarrassment, and the value of cattle and
sheep was so depressed, that their conversion into tallow
by the “ boiling-down process” was had recourse to.
Tallow has since formed a staple article of export; and
during the last five years, extensive candle manufactories
have been established in all parts of the colony.
Early in 1850, the New South Wales Association for
preventing the revival of transportation was fortned, but
was merged (Jan. Ist, 1851) in the Australasian League.
On 12th Eeb. 1851, the Bathurst gold-field was dis-
covered ; and (1852) Her Majesty’s Government placed
at the disposal of the Glovernor and Legislature of New
South Wales (and also of Victoria) the fund arising from
license-fees and royalties on gold.
The other important features of this period are—the
introduction of the uniform twopenny-postage rate ; the
commencement of ocean steam communication with India
and Europe ; the incorporation, endowment, and inaugu-
ration of the University of Sydney, with its affiliated
Colleges and Grammar School; the turning of the first
sod of the Grt. Southern Eailway ; the laying of the first
stones of the sites of the Eitzroy Dry-dock and Sydney
Exchange ; and the establishment of the Sydney branch
of the Loyal Mint.
Under Sir W. Denison, new churches, schools, colleges,
scientific institutions, and various societies arose, indicating
the advance of the religious, educational, scientific, literary,
and social condition of the colony. Having been
promoted to the G-overnorship of Madras, he
was succeeded by Sir J. Young, previously
Governor of the lonian Islands.

Climate. —Victoria enjoys a cooler atmosphere and
a more regular fall of rain than New South Wales.
The rainy months are March and April, Sept, and
October. In autumn and winter the greater number of
winds are from the north quarter, and in spring and
summer from the south ; the hot winds generally
commence about the middle of November, and recur at
intervals throughout the summer, until about the middle
of March.
Soil. —The country generally may be described as
exceedingly fertile. To the W. of Port Phillip, a belt of
land, 200 miles in length, and of an average breadth of 25
miles, is admirably adapted for agriculture and vineyards,
yielding rich crops of wheat, oats, maize, &c.; while the
level districts N. and N.W. of the watershed consist
chiefly of sand or meagre clay-soil.
PRODUCTIONS.
The productions are similar to those of N. S. Wales,
Erom the situation of Victoria, the fruits and other
vegetable products are nearly restricted to those of
Europeangrowth. The Flora includes the wild geranium;
two lovely creepers—one not unlike the laburnum in
shape, the other resembling the double violet ; the
golden and silver wattle ; the brunonia ; the indigenous
hyacinth and musk-plant; the English pelargonium and
fuchsia; and the daisy, buttercup, and violet,

HISTORY.
Lieut. Murray, R.N., in Feb., 1802, first discovered
Port Phillip; and on the 10th Oct., 1803, Lieut.-Col.
Collins arrived from Britain with a body of convicts,
accompanied by a party of soldiers and free settlers,
but removed soon after to the Derwent. (See History
of Tasmania.)
In 1835, one Batman, at the head of a party from
Hobart Town, and J. P. Fawkner, at the head of the
Launceston Association, obtained by contract from the
aborigines extensive tracts on the shores of Port Phillip
and the banks of the Yarra. Sir It. Bourke, governor
of N. S. Wales, despatched (1836) Mr. Stewart, a
magistrate, to take possession of the territory in the
name of King William IV., and, subsequently, Capt.
Lonsdale, as Police Magistrate, with a party of soldiers
and convicts, and a few officials, when the settlement was
formally placed under British rule. The extraordinary
rise in the value of property, and the extravagant prices of
live stock, provisions, &c., which took place in the early
period of the colony consequent upon the great influx


of population, and the almost unprecedented extravagances
in business of the settlers, was followed in 1842 by a
general insolvency. The colony, however, still possessing
her true source of wealth in the rich agricultural and
pastoral lands, soon arrived at even a more flourishing con-
dition than it enjoyed before. A mere police establishment
was superseded (1839) by a local administration.
Melbourne was erected into a corporation Ist Dec.,
1842; and, June 1843, a partially representative
system of government came into existence. The “Orders
in Council” for regulating the sale and occupation of
Crown Lands were issued 9th March, 1847, by the
Imperial Government. The absorbing topics of 1848
were —the great politico-ecclesiastical question of
voluntaryism, the petition for the removal of Mr.
La Trobe from the office of Superintendent, the
nomination of candidates for the Legislative Assembly,
and the emigration and separation movements. Gold
was discovered in the province 1849; the Australian
League against transportation was inaugurated Ist Feb.,
1851; and the Ist July of the same year being the day
appointed by the home authorities for the act of
separation to take effect, Mr. La Trobe assumed the
title of Lieut.-Governor of Victoria. The Ballaarat
rebellion broke out 1854, and several skirmishes tool
place between the armed diggers and the 12th and 40tl
[Regiments. The first free parliament of Victoria was
opened 25th Nov., 1856. Among the results of the
new constitution may be mentioned—the consolidatior
of local self-government by erection of municipalities
the passing of the Crown Lands Bill, and the forma
discussion of the State-aid question.

equals the best soils of Australia, producing fruit rich
in flavour, and corn of a greater specific gravity than
that of England.
Productions.—The animal and vegetable produc-
tions are similar to those of the other colonies. The
Murray abounds in fish; the “Murray cod,” weighing
from 15 to 70 lbs., at one time formed a valuable export.
The native heaths and shrubs are surpassingly
beautiful.
Minerals.—Copper, lead, iron, gold ; precious and
ornamented stones —chalcedony, cornelian, jasper, opal,
&c.; also, asbestos and grammatite. The whole of the
Range running N. and S. through the settled district is
more or less metalliferous: copper is found there in great
abundance. Copper has also been discovered in York
Peninsula, and in the vicinity of Mt. Remarkable, near
the head of Spencer’s G.
Agriculture and Horticulture.—The objects of
cultivation are —wheat barley, oats, potatoes, hay, maize,
vines, fruits, &c. Numerous fruit-trees and some of the
choicest shrubs, timber-trees, and flowers, lately imported,
thrive admirably; the climate, however, owing to the
heat and long-continued droughts of summer, is not so
well adapted to the growth of succulent vegetables, bush-
fruit, or of chestnut, walnut, and plane-trees.
The Manufactures are —wine, leather, butter and
cheese, soap and candles, flour, &c.


Commerce. — Exports. —The principal are—wool,
bread-stuffs, grain, &c., copper and other minerals ; total
value (1859), £1,655,876. Imports.— The principal are—
sugar, tea, wool, live stock, drapery goods, hardware,
spirits, &c.; total value, £1,507,494.
Principal Ports. —Port Adelaide, Eobe, Elliot, and
Gloolwa,
Population. (1861), 127,000 (exclusive of the
military).
Army. —lmperial troops, 91; volunteer military force,
2,143 ; number of militia liable to serve, 14,330.
Finance. —The revenue for 1859 was £511,927 ;
expenditure, £620,756.
HISTORY.
Col. Light, who was sent out to suggest the site for the
capital, arrived in Aug. 1836, and after examining
Nepean Bay, Port Lincoln, and Encounter 8., decided
upon establishing the capital where it now stands.
Capt. Hindmarsh, the first governor, arrived at the
close of the same year, and proclaimed the colony on the
28th Dec, The short career of office of the first two
governors was characterized by numerous inconveniences ;
and the reckless and imprudent expenditure into which
Col. Crawler, the third governor, launched, resulted in an
almost universal bankruptcy, from which the colony was
saved only by the rigidly economical measures of his
successor, Capt. Grey, under whose administration the
expenditure was reduced to about one-sixth of what it
had been : agriculture was promoted, the colony rendered
not only self-supporting, but enabled to export grain,
wool, tallow, and beef; copper was discovered; and ever
since, with but a short interruption arising from the
more recent discovery of gold in the adjacent colonies, a
steady career of prosperity has since been reported.
Every year enlarges the area of land under cultivation ;
the wool exports are increasing in a most cheering
manner; and the mineral resources show no signs of
abatement. Great attention is now given to the drying
of fruit and the making of wine.

HISTORY.
In Aug. 1829, Capt. Stirling, whohadpreviouslyexplored
the coast, arrived at the proposed site of the new settle-
ment on the Swan It., to which he was appointed Lieut.-
Governor. The history of this colony up to the year
1850 contains little of interest, being merely that of a
disastrous early settlement, and of its subsequent struggle
for a bare existence, with a scanty population, and with
little capital to render available its natural resources.
So late as the year 1848, things had reached such a state
of general depression, that the colonists, to save them-
selves from absolute poverty, requested the Home
Government to make it a penal settlement. The
request was granted (1850), and ever since the colony
has been prospering.

The Climate of this district is hot during the summer
months, but is never subject to the extremes of cold or
hot winds.
Soil.— The soil of the basaltic plains and valleys is
very rich, and, were the country well-watered, might be
rendered very productive. The sandstone ranges are
comparatively sterile.
Productions. — Vegetable. —The pine-apple, banana,
guava, lemon, citron, cotton, sugar-cane, coffee, cocoa-nut,
are abundant; dye-woods, mulberry-trees, maize, wheat,

well suited to the cultivation of arrow-root, tobacco, and
indigo. The indigenous timber is of great value,
particularly the Moreton Bay pine and the bunya-bunya
tree.
Agriculture. —The country is more pastoral than
agricultural; around Moreton B. is an extensive squatting
district, occupied by some of the first and now most
wealthy settlers.
There are no Manufactures of importance. The
seal and dugong fishery is extensively prosecuted —the
dugong weighing from 200 to 700 lbs., and yielding from
2to 18 gallons of oil. Turtle also abound.

Geneeal View oe the Mountain and Elver
System. —The watershed of the country, as indicated by
the courses of the larger rivers, runs, generally speaking,
S.W. and H.E., the country on either side of it
gradually sloping towards the H.W. and S.E. Emerging
frem the sea* at C. Portland, the dividing range runs
S. by E. towards S. Patrick’s Hd. (2,227), Cornwall ,
then S.W. to L. Toom ; from L. Toom it proceeds
westwards towards St. Peter’s Pass, then northward,
dividing L. Sorell from L. Arthur, and arriving at Dry’s
Bluff (4,257), Westmoreland, makes a semicircular bend
in its course towards Western Bluff, or Mt. Humboldt
(5,520). Erom this point it runs S. and then S.E. till it
reaches S. Cape.
Its chief summits are —Table Mt. (3,596), Somerset;
Mt. Penny (3,782), Brady’s Look-out (4,497), Ironstone

* See Mountain System of Australia, page 10.


In its course it throws off spurs at all angles. The
first branches off at the source of the Eingarooma E. ;
the second stretches westward as far as George Town,
chief summit, Mt. Barrow, Dorset; and the third is
crowned by the elevations of Ben Nevis (3,910) and
Ben Lomond (5,002), Cornwall. Another spur separates
Spring Hill from the Clyde, chief summit, Wood’s Quoin
(3,033), Monmouth. At Dry’s Bluff a spur is thrown
off which encircles L. Arthur, crowned by Barren Tier
(3,889), Westmoreland ; and between Dry’s Bluff and
Western Bluff, one branches to the northward, chief
summit, Quamby’s Bluff, Westmoreland; and several
to the southward, which divide the lakes from the
tributaries of the Derwent.
At Western Bluff a spur is thrown off to the N.E.,
separating the Meander from the Mersey ; two to the N.,
the valleys between being drained by the Mersey, Forth,
and Leven, the chief summits —Black Bluff (4,381) and
Mt. Eolancl (4,047), Devon; one to the N.W. towards
C. Grim, called in different parts of its course the
Hampshire and Surrey Hills; several to the W. —one
stretching through Russell, separating Arthur E. from
Pieman’s E. ; another (the Eldon Eange), separating
Pieman’s E. from King’s E.
S. of L. St. Clair, two remarkable spurs are thrown
off: one which divides King’s E. from Gordon’s E., and
is crowned by the Frenchman’s Cap (4,756), Franklin ;

WATER SYSTEM.
Rivers Draining the South-Eastern Slope. —The Derwent
(120), rises in L. St. Clair, in Lincoln, flows S.E., sepa-
rating Buckingham from Cumberland and Monmouth,
and falls into Storm B.; it receives on its left the Hive
(35), the Ouse (60), the Clyde (50), and the Jordan (50) ;
and on its right, the Florentine (35). Little Swanport
E. (30), flows E. between Glamorgan and Pembroke,
into Oyster B. Prosser’s E. flows E. through Pembroke
into Prosser’s B. Coal E. (25), flows S. through
Monmouth, and falls into Pittwater. Huon E. (100),
rises in L. Edgar, flows eastward, separating Buckingham
from Arthur and Kent, and falls into D’Entrecasteaux
Channel.
Draining the North-Western Slope. —The E. Gordon
(90) rises in L. Eichmond, flows S.E. through Franklin,
then westward, separating Franklin from Arthur and
Montgomery, and falls into Macquarie Harbour. King’s
E. (50), from Lincoln, flows westward between Franklin
and Montagu, and falls into Macquarie Harbour.
Pieman’s E. (50), from the Eocky Mts., flows westward

S.E. In summer, hot winds are occasionally felt, but
neither so frequently, nor, when they do occur, are they
so intense, as in Australia.
Soil. —The soil is very varied : in some places a rich
alluvial mould ; in others, sandy and argillaceous.
PRODUCTIONS.
Animals. — Quadrupeds. —Kangaroo (forester, brush,
and wallaby), kangaroo-rat, bandicoot, opossum, and
wombat, native hyena or tiger, native devil, tiger-cat,
and native cat, —all marsupial; and the platypus and two
varieties of porcupine. The other mammals are—three
species of bat, two mice, and one water-rat. All the
common domesticated animals have been introduced;
and these, especially sheep and cattle, have thriven
amazingly.


Binds. —The feathered tribes of this island are
numerous; some of them are very handsome ; but few
can be considered melodious. The principal are—the
emu, eagle, six or seven varieties of hawk, three or four
species of owl, cockatoo (both black and white), parrots
of many varieties, wood-pigeon, snipe, quail, wild-duck,
teal, and black swan. Pelicans, cormorants, penguins,
gulls, and cranes, line the sea-shore and the margin of lakes
and rivers.
Insects. —Among insects are —moths, bottle-flies,
gnats, mosquitoes, a great variety of beetles, ants,
grasshoppers, tree-locusts, crickets, spider, mantis,
scorpions, centipedes, common flies, and other insects
well known in England. Bees have been introduced.
Reptiles. —The reptiles are —snakes (the most
common kinds being a large black snake, the diamond
snake, and a smaller brown sort, all armed with poison-
fangs), iguanas, frogs, and harmless lizards.
Fish. —Freshwater fish are limited to very few species;
of these the most in favour is the so-called herring, or
mullet, a small fish weighing four or five ounces, which
appears to be migratory, and is identical, or nearly so,
with the English smelt”. Eels of an immense size, a sort
of bream, barracouta, flatheads, king-fish, trumpeter,
flounders, gurnet, cod, salmon-trout, mullet, guard-fish,
plaice, perch, silver-fish, pike, blue-heads, and skates, are
the principal at present known and eaten. A fish found
in the bays and on the shores of the island, and supposed
to be a species of toad-fish, is a strong poison.
Large sharks, porpoises, and whales (black and sperm),
abound in all the Australian waters. The shell-fish are —
oysters, muscles, cockles, periwinkles, whelks, and mutton-
fish ; crustaceans, —prawns and crayfish. Coral and
sponges are also abundant.
Vegetable. — Trees. —The forests of Tasmania are
of unsurpassed grandeur. All the trees are evergreens ;
and some of them, particularly the wattles, put forth
very rich blossoms in spring. The most common kinds


include the peppermint, stringy-bark, iron-bark, and
different varieties of gum-trees.; the wattles, the dark
and pale varieties of lightwood ; and the forest-oak,
she-oak, &c.

them abundant: —Coal, iron, copper, lead, gold, black-
lead, limestone, granite, marble, and various other sorts
of building stone, are all found to a greater or less
extent. Coal abounds in the Jerusalem and South Esk
Basins, and is now worked at the Mersey, the Douglas
lE, Port Arthur, blew Town, and in the Schouten Is.
Limestone is found in almost every part of the island;
granite on High Tor (near the Eldon Eange), Ben
Lomond, Erenchman’s Cap, and many other places;
freestone, in theN., the centre, and the S. of the island;
and gold at Eingal, and in the channels of some of the
rivers. Marble also abounds.
Agriculture. —The objects of cultivation are—the
different sorts of grain (wheat, oats, barley), peas, beans,
grasses (English and Colonial), potatoes, turnips, onions,
mangold wurzel, &c.

HISTORY.
Tasmania was discovered (1642) by the Dutch navigator
Tasman, who named it Van Diemen’s Land, in honour
of Van Diemen, Governor-General of the Dutch posses-
sions in the East Indies, from whom he had received a
commission to explore Hew Holland, and to ascertain
how far it extended towards the Antarctic Circle. It
was afterwards visited in succession by the navigators
Marion (1772), Furneaux (1773), Cook, accompanied by
Clarke (1777), Cox (1789), Bligh (1788 and 1792),
Bruni D’Entrecasteaux, in the Recherche, accompanied
by Pluon Kermandee, in the Esperance (1792), and
Hayes (1794). This island was first taken possession of
by a party from Port Jackson, who arrived (10th August,
1803), and settled on the east bank of the Derwent at
Eisdon (Eestdown).
Port Phillip was discovered (1799) by Capt. Murray,
and occupied (1803) by a party of prisoners and a few
settlers under Lieut.-Governor Collins. The spot
selected being considered unsuitable, they removed to
Van Diemen’s Land, where they arrived in two divisions
on the 30th Jan. and 16th Feb., 1804, at Sullivan’s
Cove ; and the locality at Eisdon having been disapproved
of, they established their head-quarters on the spot where
Hobart Town now stands. On the 3rd May, 1804, and
again in 1805, hostile collisions took place between the
Troops and Blacks ; but, on both occasions, the latter
were repulsed with loss. Colonel Patterson, with a
second party from Sydney, formed a settlement at the


mouth of the Tamar (Port Dalrymple). York Town
was first selected, then George Town, and, finally,
Launceston was fixed on as the site of the Northern
capital.
The removal of the settlers from Norfolk 1., occupied
in 1788, took place in 1808. On their arrival from that
island they were located on small farms about O’Brien’s
Bridge, New Norfolk, and Norfolk Plains. During the
administration of Col. Davey, the ports wore opened for
commerce (June 1813) ; the whale fishery was extended;
the plough introduced; corn exported ; the foundation-
stone of St. David’s Church was laid (Feb. 1817) ; and
the first number of the Hobart Town Gazette and
Southern Reporter was published (June Ist, 1816), In
1817, the Peninsular war being over, Col. Sorell arrived
as Governor, accompanied by many half-pay and retired
officers, who, on their arrival, obtained free grants of
land.
During the reign of his successor, Col. Arthur, the
Yan Diemen’s Land Company was formed ; the press
liberated from all Government restrictions (1824) ;
several banks were established ; and the island (Dec.
1825) declared independent of New South Wales. The
erection of the New Wharf, the making of the Richmond
Road, and the planning of the Bridgewater Causeway,
and other material improvements, are marks of the
enterprise and skill of this Governor.
The doors of the Council Chamber were thrown open
to the public by Sir J. Franklin (1837) ; the Australian
Colonies Government Bill was passed (sth August,
1850), and under it a Legislative Council, consisting of
sixteen elected members, was constituted ; the Australian
League against transportation was formed in 1851; and
transportation of convicts to the shores of Tasmania was
abolished. The Constitutional Act, passed on Ist Nov.,
1854, by the Tasmanian Legislature, received the Queen’s
assent in 1855 ; and in 1856, a Legislative Council and
House of Assembly, both elective, were chosen.

NEW ZEALAND.
New Zealand is situated in the S. Pacific Ocean,
about 1,200 miles eastward of Tasmania, between the
parallels of 34° and 48° S. lat. and the meridians of 166°
and 179° E. long. It consists of two large islands, the
North and Middle, with a lesser one called Stewart’s 1.,
and numerous islets scattered round the coasts.
Extent.— The extreme length, from N. Cape to S.
Cape, exceeds 1,100 miles ; its breadth varies from 1 to
300 m., though 100 is the average. The Northern and
Middle Islands are separated by Cook’s Straits, from 30
to 100 m. in width ; and Stewart’s is separated from the
Middle Island by Eoveaux Strait, 15 m. wide.
Area. — The united area of the three islands is
upwards of 122,000 scp m. : the North Island containing
* Sir W. Denison was the first Governor-in-Chief, and received his commission
as such a year or two before he removed to New South Wales ; —up to this time
ail our Governors held commissions only as Lieutenant-Governors.

Straits. —Cook’s Str. separating the North and
Middle Is.; Eoveaux Str., between Middle I. and
Stewart’s I.


Mountain and Eiyek System. —The mountain ranges
run nearly parallel with the coast, generally from N.E.
to S.W. In the Northern I. these ranges vary from 500
to 1,500 ft. in height, until they reach the centre of the
island near Mt. Perongia (2,800), where the great
central Eangitoto chain commences, which, under the
name of Euahine (chief summits —Tongariro, 6,200, and
Euapehu, 9,195) is continued southward to Cook’s Str.
in two branches, the Tararua and the Eimutaka ranges.
The Puketoi and Maungaraki are coast-chains between
Cook’s Str. and Hawke B.
The mountains in the North I. do not form so con-
tinuous a chain, and, with the exception of a few
detached peaks, do not attain so great a height as those
in the Middle I. Tongariro, a volcano in active opera-
tion, and Euapehu, an extinct volcano, lie close to each
other, forming, with two or three lesser peaks, a
magnificent mountain group near the centre of the
island:—Mt. Egmont (8,270), in the W. of Taranaki;
Mt. Edgecumbe (2,575), S. of the Bay of Plenty ; Mt.
Ikaurangi (5,535), and Mt. Hardy (3,700), N.E. of
Mt. Edgecumbe.
The Middle Island has its northern shore skirted by a
high crescent-shaped range of mountains, throwing out
spurs towards the sea, and forming the sheltered harbours
with which that locality abounds. Erom this range
arise a great central range, which runs through the
island midway taking a direction to the E., and the
Southern Alps (chief summits —Mt. Cook, 13,000, and
Mt. Aspiring 9,135), which skirt the western coast.
The mts. in this island seem to form coast ridges similar
to those in the Northern Island, with a table-land in the
interior.

the S. of Canterbury ; L. Hawea and L. Wanaka
(1,036 ft. above the sea), in the N. of Otago ; Greenstone
L. ; S. of L. Wanaka ; Waiora L., E. of Greenstone L.


Climate, —The climate is pronounced genial, and
altogether remarkably healthy. It varies with the
latitude, and may be compared with the S. of France in
the N., and the S. of England in the S.
Soil. —Generally fertile ; but, owing to the light and
porous nature of the surface and subsoil, wet rapidly
drains and percolates away.
PRODUCTIONS.
Animals. —Mammals. — Indigenous. —One species of
bat, and in the neighbouring seas whales and seals.
Quadrupeds. — lntroduced. —Dog, cat, rat, mouse,
pig, horses, cattle, sheep, goats, and a few asses and
mules.

small singing-birds ; and several species of sea-birds, the
principal being the albatross, gannet, puffin or mutton-
bird. Introduced. —Canaries, bullfinches, and all sorts
of poultry ; also pea-fowd, guinea-fowl, &c.
Reptiles. — lndigenous. —Several species of lizards,
all perfectly harmless.

Zealand, are numerous ; the principal are —grasshoppers,
caterpillars, ants, centipedes, spiders, sand-flies, blow-
flies, and, in the native villages, abundance of vermin.
Introduced. —Bees.

coasts of Britain are—the conger-eel, sole, plaice, and
flounder. Of other sorts may be mentioned—the shark,
dog-fish, hapuka (an excellent fish of the cod kind,
weighing from 20 to 112 lbs.), moki (somewhat resem-
bling the dorey), kawai (resembling the mullet),


barracouta, warebo, and others. The rivers abound in
small fish, resembling the eel, grayling, white-bait,

Vegetable.— lndigenous * —The most common trees
of the forests are—the kauri, totara, puriri or New
Zealand oak. The forests also abound in ornamental
trees and shrubs: —tree-ferns, some of them with stems
from 40 to 60 ft. high ; many species of laurels, fuchsia-
trees ; and the beautiful mimosa, covered with clusters of
yellow flowers. Introduced : —Almost every vegetable
production known in England has been introduced with
invariable success. The oak, ash, horse-chesnut, Spanish-
chesnut, and some mimosas from New South "Wales, are the
principal timber-trees. Besides English fruits, flowers, and
garden vegetables, and European grains and grasses, there
have been introduced the kumeraf or sweet potatoe, a small
but delicious kind of yam called the taro, Spanish and
Portugese onions, mulberry, lemon, and orange trees,
the tobacco-plant, and Cape gooseberries.
The principal plants are —the Phormium tenax or New

HISTORY.
This country was first seen by the Dutch navigator
Tasman (13th Dec. 1642), but as he never landed, and
supposed it to form a part of a great southern continent,
the honour of its discovery belongs to Capt. Cook, who
sighted the land (6th Oct., 1769), and between that date
and 1777 circumnavigated and roughly surveyed the two
principal islands, landed at various places, and took formal
possession of the country for the King of Grt. Britain.
As early as 1793, the whaling ships of different nations
began to touch on the coast, and in 1814-15 the Bev. S.
Marsden, Colonial Chaplain of N. S. Wales, established
at the Bay of Islands a mission of the Church Missionary
Society, and appointed Mr. T. Kendal resident magistrate.
The first Wesleyan Mission was founded in 1823 at
Wangaroa, N. of the Bay of Islands ; and Dr. Selwyn,
who was appointed Bishop of New Zealand (17th Oct.,
1841), arrived (29th Oct., 1842) with a suite of
Clergyman, whom he had appointed to reside at
Wellington, Nelson, and New Plymouth. Two chiefs,
Hongi and Waikato, accompanied Mr. Kendal to
England in 1820, where they became acquainted with
Baron de Thierry, Erench by birth, whom they led to
entertain the hope of acquiring extensive territories and
rights of chieftainship in New Zealand. This circum-
stance laid the foundation of the attempt made by the
Erench Oovernment in 1840 to establish a penal
settlement in the Middle Island. Hongi had no sooner
returned, than he armed his own tribe and its allies with
the weapons he had received in England as presents, and
attacked the powerful tribes which inhabited the west


coast of the Northern Island; hence arose the native
wars which raged throughout both islands, almost
exterminating the aboriginal inhabitants. Such a state
of things required some remedy; and Mr. Busby was
accordingly appointed (1831) “ Resident Officer,” but
with no means at his disposal for maintaining authority,
so that the wars of the natives, in which the white
settlers joined, still continued, and European vices and
diseases were spread among the diminished native popula-
tion. In 1835, alarmed at the prospects of a French
occupation projected by Baron de Thierry, the leading
missionaries of New Zealand induced 35 chiefs to sign a
paper, by which they declared the independence of the
whole of New Zealand as one nation, and formed them-
selves into an independent state with the title of the
“ United Tribes of Ncav Zealand,” In 1837, a large
class of merchants and gentry in Git. Britain formed
a society called the New Zealand Company, and sent out
(1839) an expedition under Col. Wakefield, followed soon
after by a body of emigrants, who on their arrival formed
the settlement of Wellington. The example of the New
Zealand Company was followed by an association of
gentlemen connected with the Church of England, who,
in 1848, formed the Canterbury settlement; and the
same year the Otago settlement was planted by gentlemen
in connection with the Free Church of Scotland.
The precursors of a French penal settlement on Banks’
Peninsula sailed from France (Nov. 1839), but were
anticipated by Major Bunbury and Capt. Hobson. The
latter arrived in Jan. 1840, and having with great
difficulty obtained the sovereignty by treaty from the
natives, acted in several capacities as Consul, Lieut.-
G-overnor, and Glover nor, during the period extending
from Jan. 1840 to Sept. 1842. In consequence of his
illness,, the government was carried on from about a
month after his arrival until the accession of Governor
Fitzroy, Dec. 1843, by Lieut. Shortland, the civil staff
which he had brought with him from Sydney, and a Mr.
Clarke, a missionary cathechist who had been appointed


10th Sept., 1842
Dec., 1843
4th Sept., 1855
Protector of the Aborigines. Capt. Pitzroy administered
the affairs of the Colony in a very partial spirit until he
was recalled in consequence of his financial absurdities
and land-regulations. His vacillation and pusillanimity
towards the natives had provoked an aggressive warfare
on their part, in the course of which the British troops
sent from N. S. "Wales were disgracefully worsted, the
earliest British settlement at the Bay of Islands was
plundered and destroyed, and the out-settlers near
Wellington attacked and robbed with some loss of life by
parties of marauders directed by Kauperaha and Sangi-
haeta. His successor, Capt. Grey, began his career by
energetic measures for enforcing British law, and for
holding in check the rebellious natives throughout the
colony. In 1817 there were petty disturbances in
Wanganui, after the suppression of which peace was pre-
served until the breaking out (1859) of a revolt arising out
of land-questions between the Europeans and the natives.
The struggle then commenced still continues (1861),
although the natives have received a considerable check.
Capt. Grey also displayed unceasing activity in visitingthe
different settlements, and great anxiety to remedy in some
measure the evils which had accumulated under the mis-
management of his predecessors.
On the Ist Jan., 1818, Governor Grey proclaimed the
constitution granted to New Zealand (10th March), and
fixed as the boundary between Auckland and the
southern Provinces of the North I. the parallel of
39° 46'. During his absence in 1854, and again during
the period between his final departure and the arrival of
Col. Browne, the affairs of the Government were
administered lay Col. Wynyard.

Antarctica*
Of late years, several islands and extensive tracts of
land, supposed to form portions of a great Southern
Continent, have been found by British, French, and
American navigators: —Victoria Land, S. of New
Zealand; Adelia and Sabrina Land, S. of Australia ;
Kemp and Enderby Lands, S. of Madagascar ; and
Graham Land, about 600 miles S. of Terra del Euego ;
all on or near the Antarctic Circle ; South Shetland,
N., and South Orkney and South Georgian Is., N.N.E. of
Graham Land. In this division may he reckoned agroup of
small islands lying between the New Georgian Is. and
Africa, of which Tristan d’Aeunha is the largest;
Prince Edward Is., about 600 miles S.E. of the Cape of
Good Hope; Crqcet and Marion Is., E. of Prince
Edward Is. ; Kerguelen’s I. or Desolation Land, E. of
Marion Is.; Amsterdam and St. Paul’s Is., N.N.E. of
Kerguelen’s I.; Bishop and Clerk, Judge and Clerk, and
Macquarie Is., S. of the Auckland Is.
REMARKS.
These islands and the lands of Antarctica are generally volcanic; their
shores are frequented by the albatross and vast numbers of penguins ;
and seals and whales abound in the neighbouring seas. Victoria Land,
discovered in 1840, and named in honour of the Queen, contains Mount
Erebus, a volcano, 12,400 feet high. To the W. is the South Magnetic
Pole. The surface of Tristan d’Acunha is rocky, and rises in one point
above 8,000 feet high. Between this island and La Plata are the
deepest parts of the ocean yet known, soundings of 7,706 (8f miles)
and 8,300 fathoms (9-J- miles) being taken in 1852. Amsterdam is
remarkable for its hot springs, and a crater 1,000 yds. in diameter, into
which the sea has forced its way.
