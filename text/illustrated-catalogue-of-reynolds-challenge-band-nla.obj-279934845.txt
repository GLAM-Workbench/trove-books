REYNOLD’S BAND INSTRUMENTS.


F and Eb Tenor Cor (Mellophone)
This instrument has been greatly improved by
assimilating it in bore and proportions to the
French Horn, which instrument it resembles in
tone and form, excepting that it is played with
the right hand, and the fingering is the same as
the Tenor Horn.
The Tenor Cor in F is used as a substitute for
the French Horn in both Military Bands and Or-
chestras. The instrument can be played in a
Brass Band, in the key of Eb, by fitting the slide,
and can be played by any Horn Player.
No. 8 F and Eb Tenor Cor, New Model, 3 nickel-silver valves, light action, cardholder,
and silver-plated mouthpiece £7 10 0
French Homs
The French Horn is
the most sensitive and at
the same time the most
exquisitely toned of all
the brass instruments. In
the hands of an experi-
enced performer it is
capable of the most de-
lightful solo effects,
while as a harmony or
accompaniment instru-
ment none other can com-
pare with it, either in
richness of tonal quality
or in resonance. There-
fore, it follows as a mat-
ter of course that the
best and most perfect in-
trument obtainable is a
positive necessity to the
player who strives for a
reputation as a first-
class performer.
No. 9 French Horn, Orchestral Model, with F and Eb crooks and low pitch slide, 3 nickel-
silver valves, light action, silver-plated mouthpiece Brass . . £l2 10 0
