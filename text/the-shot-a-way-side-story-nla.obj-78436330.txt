THE SHOT.
BH! ye who live in Melbourne?s mushroom city,
Surrounded by life?s luxuries and dainties,
Give ear awhile unto my rustic ditty,
Which in some points, perhaps, a little quaint is.
And it it?s not? why, then the more?s tlje pity,
As it will shew the nine fair creatures aint his:
I mean the bard?s (that?s me?your most obedient),
Who dotes on every rhythmical ingredient.

? Some books are lies frae end to end,
And some great lies were never penned.
E?en ministers they hae been kenned,
In holy rapture,
A thumping whid at times to vend,
And nail?t wi? scripture.
But this that I am gaun to tell,
That ance upon a time befell,
Is just as true ?s the deil?s in hell
Or Dublin City.?
Burns.
Once on a time?l like that old beginning;
It brings to memory childhood?s happy days,"
Wiien round the homely hearth we squatted, spinning
All kinds of tales that children?s minds amaze.
'I hope my readers here will see my meaning;
It not, I pity their short-sighted gaze,
And nothing puts wrong understandings .Tighter
Than that between a reader and a writer.

? #
Once on a time, then?not so long ago
As people may imagine?there foregathered
A half-a-dozen fast young men or so
(For frolic they were similarly feathered),
Whose tides pecuniary were rather low,
As most of mortals have been, that have weathered
Years five and twenty, with their ebbs and flows,
Their laughing pleasures, and their tearful woes!
And where they met was at a house of call.
Or what the vulgar term a public-house,
Whose liquors are alike dispensed to all,
Provided they the wherewithal can rouse
From cherished purse; but should you fail to hawl
That tal?sman forth, God help you ! you may douse,
Or quench your thirst in some fair stream, or let
Your name be placed in Boniface?s debt!
The which is very awkward, for, you see,
?T is like a nest-egg to deluded hens:
Your next call ends with?" Put that down to me;?
And thus grows worse and worse, like rugged glens
The higher up you wander; or, to be
More lucid, like those green and treacherous fens
One sometimes meets, the further in the deeper I
And at the harvest tell me who?s the reaper!
I ?ll leave you that to ponder, and proceed
Straightway with this my tale. I said they met:
And, as philosophers have ay agreed,
When friend meets friend?t is right to have a ?wet.?
jt That word is rather commonplace indeed,
But then you know?t is hard neat words to get
In rhymes, because they ?re such a rambling tribe.?
1 meant to say, ?t is right they should imbibe.


There?s something in that word that sounds genteel,
Far more so than theyankee phrase, to ? liquor;??
Altho? it's getting colonised a deal,
I s pose because their clipper-ships are quicker
Than ours, which makes us naturally feel
Their land to be a phrase-concocting vicar '
To our maternal England, whose pretensions
Were never very mighty to inventions!
? Waiter, some wine !? they lustily cried out.
?T was brought?imbibed : again the bell wasruno-,
Another bottle to their human drought
Was sacrificed, and then each moistened tongue
Began to wag with droll?ry sans a doubt;
A.nd care for sweeter mirth aside was flung,
While wit stepped in, and garnished many a tale,
Like ready-money at a sheriff?s sale !
Once more upon the eve of waiter calling
They were, when lo! they found their funds were
A state of things particularly galling, [done;
And sure Jinale to the best of fun.
I ve known some noisy braggarts caterwauling,
Grow puny as the crack of a pop-gun
Through that same cause; the absence, sure, of money
Is a great drawback to the passim, funny!
?What?s to be done?? said one. ?Well, Ido n?t know,?
t Was breathed in concert from each neighbour lip,
When, at this juncture, round the corner, lo I
An old acquaintance hove in sight, and trip-
Ping at his side, a little child not mo?
Than three years old, and most decided chip
Of the old block, its dad. Here fortune?s face,
Once more propitious, smiled upon their case.


They greeted him with every kind of phrase
Betokening friendship?s steady fervent glow,
Altho? it?s fashionable, now-a-days.
To speak as if your words had birth in snow:
By half too artificial are the ways,
Or manners, of the present race, I trow.
I know some folks, who, wishing to be civil,
Will shake your hand, and wish you at the devil!
I say, I know some; yes, and many a smile
1 have at their expense, when left alone.
Poor shallow fools! they thijfc their lofty style
Is aristocracy?s most precious stone.
And then, their house! good Lord! I?d run a mile
Rather than stay a minute in ?t; each tone
You hear is pregnant with hypocrisy,
The which I ?ll see to when I?m M. L. C.
Excuse me, reader, if I sometimes stray
A little from my theme to pick a straw.
I Tu fond of writing in this rambling way,
Because I have both time and chance to draw
A moral now and then, which, I dare say,
Will tickle some folks, raijther on the raw.
As for my tale, I?m certain I could tell
It in a minute, but I do n?t choose : well,
?T will partly suit my purpose here to trace
A likeness of these young men?s timely friend :
His name, we ?ll say, w r as Gripfast; for his face
Pronounced the niggard to be his ascend-
Ant passion, which is frequently the case
With men whom nature ha? n?t had time to spend
To form their features tolerably snugly;
And he, in short, was execrably ugly !
A -
* f P- **#!


Olden he was; at least, when I say old,
He w#s upon the slippery side of forty.
He?d won a wife with less of self than gold;
For she was young and beautiful, but ?dortie.?
That last word?s Scotch, and means, inclined to scold.
Or fret, or chafe, or sulk, or ?or ?in short, the
Rhyme is awkward, and I can?t proceed:
You know my meaning! very well, agreed.
I managed that scrape tolerably well,
And now I ?ll have a care of future rhymes;
None but unlucky bards can guess or tell
The trouble simple words produce at times
I?d keep a dictionary at my el-
Bow, if it was n?t one of those sad crimes
The world would ne?er forgive in plodding poet!
So now, my muse, spread out your wings and go it!
I said, she fretted; ay, and many a night
He lay and listened to long curtain lectures,
Fraught with the cheerless and distressing plight
He ?d brought her to, with gold bespangled pictures.
? Would he were dead, and buried from my sight,"
Was one of her fond wishes, I conjecture;
While he, poor man 1 tho? these things were notorious,
Bore all with patience awfully uxorious!
XVIII.
They had been wed four years, or thereabout,
And who can tell the grievances he bore
During that time ? The appellation, ? lout,?
Rung in his ears each of the twenty-four
Hours of the day (but gents, who have the gout
Get used to it; and criminals will snore
The eve before they die); and he, convinced
Of what she told him, neither raved nor winced.
i' ?


?T is usual for parties, who have been
A burden or a help unto each other
So long, to alter the domestic scene
With noisy children, and she turned a mother:
Which placed her on a level with the Queen
Of merry England! or of any other
Fair lady of or low or lofty station,
Who adds to this terrestrial population!
And, consequently, he was quite elated,
Whatever she might, with the little maid;
For, ?t was a daughter?so it had been fated:
Altho? he?d rather had a son, he said.
But these things are ordained, th? initiated
Always assert, and, therefore, to upbraid
Dame chance would be, a sinful waste of wind.
And then, who knows what luck may be behind?
I always like to take things as they come,
Just as Ido these rhymes; because I?ve found
?T is folly on hope?s hacknied harp to strum;
For, just when you imagine that the sound
Is growing perfect, deafening discord tum-
Bles in ; and then I?m free to bet a pound
To half a farthing, that the joy half seen
Will end in anger, or, at best, chagrinel
So Gripfast said, ?Thank God!? and kissed the pledge
Of love, or what you will, with all the zest
Of fatherly affection. To the edge
Of his invention flew, then, for the best
And prettiest name that sits upon the ledge
Of christening chalice, cup. or bowl ?a pest
Upon?t! the proper name I ?ll never win;
T is where the parson dips his fingers in.


XXIII.
But with a sudden impulse seized, he cried,
? Perdition to all names of foreign sound !
They ?re but the evidence of low-born pride
In every vulgar, stuck-up family found:
My mother?s name, in mind half-deified,
Shall be the babe?s;? and, with a sudden bound,
He ope?d the door, and cried, ? My dearest pet,
The child?s name shall be?will be, Margaret! ??
XXIV.
In vain the lady said, ? T is vulgar, low,
Plebeian, common, banished from society.
How do you think that it will ever show
On paper? lauks! it speaks of inebriety ;
And half the common servant girls, 1 know,
Are Megs or Pegs, the name curtailed. Oh! fieatthee!
Think, think of something prettier and better,
Or else, for God?s sake! call her Margueretta !*?
But he was stubborn, stubborn as a mule,
And vow?d he?d have no foreign terminations ;
So, when the lady?s fury had grown cool,
The child received its grandma?s appellation,
Or name, perhaps is plainer; so, do n?t pull
That face, depictive of abomination.
Good Lord! a bard must sometimes stretch a point
To get a ryhrne, however out of joint!
XXVI.
But, tho? the child?s real name was Margaret,
She seldom got it from her lady mother;
She oftener called it u her most precious pet,?
? Darling, a jewel,? ? gem,? and every other
Endearing term that you e?er heard or met.
And when it learned to walk, she found another,
That pleased her vastly ; ?Popsy ? it was hight;
In nomenclature rather novel?quite !


XXVII.
?T was popsy this, and popsy that, all day,
Until it grew familiar to the ear
Of its paternal; thus, she gained the sway
At this particular crisis, it is clear:
For, frequently, half-earnest and half-play,
He?d cry out, ? Little popsy, darling, here !
Come to my arms, and feel the love that there is,
My own bewitching, pretty little heiress ! ?
XXVIII.
So much, then, for the baby?s nomenclature ;
It?s settled, surely, past all kind of question.
If not, just say so, and altho? it?s late, sure
I ?ll bring forth my last argument and best one,
Which is : ??t is not in any woman?s nature
(I do n?t care who she be, or vile or chaste one),
Who, having on an object set her heart,
But what she will attain it, or?a part!
XXIX.
Woman, vain man! altho? you boast a deal
Of your superior wisdom, and such trash!
Is still the better spoke in life?s great wheel;
Take it away, the whole will come down smash!
Just like ?I do n?t know what; indeed I feel
I?ve made too grand a philosophic dash ;
For what this stanza doth attempt to preach is,
Simply, that women always wear the breeches!
The word of every wife I?ve seen is law
To who?s absurdly termed her lord and master.
For, should he strive against her yoke to draw,
There?s always sure to be some sad disaster!
And see how men?s presumptive pride will thaw
Before their sweetheart?s transient frown; ay, faster
Than snow upon a sun-lit bank, by Jove!
Or lumps of ice put in a Yankee stove !


XXXI.
?The grey mare, therefore, is the better horse.?
But ?here I must give o?er this episode,
Because I ?m wandering from my story?s course
Along a rather dangerous kind of road!
T? is wonderful, the accumulative force
Of rhyme unbridled ; it would make a load
From what at first seemed nothing; thus I thought
This tale at first could in a page be got.
XXXII.
But see the difference! if that I had time
I?d count the lines, and pages, but, ah me!
I durst not pause, for fear this fit of rhyme
Should vanish, scared at curiosity.
So now, my muse, one sip of the sublime.
Or, as I see it?s labelled, ? Eau-de-vie !?
And then return well-pleased, like sage Jack Horner
To where old Gripfast turned the public?s corner.
XXXIII
But here it may be just as well to mention,
He had two weaknesses (most mortals have
One at the least): his first caused much contention,
Namely, that he was somewhat of a slave
To what is daily thrust on your attention,
By what is termed the ? press,? I mean, a crav-
ing after what it vainly strives to throttle,
That tiny imp of discord, called ? The Bottle I?
xxxiv.
And this one led to weakness number two,
Which was, too great a share of self-esteem.
A portion of it?s very good, ?t is true ;
Just like a glass of brandy; but I deem
Too much disgusting as a made-up stew
At an inn table ; plainly each extreme
Is loathsome; for, too much gains honor never,
And having none, but damns a man for ever!


XXXV.
So now I think his character is plainly
Depicted; if it?s not, the fault?s not mine.
I really hope I have not thus been vainly
Producing thoughts, and adding line to line.
If scs I ?ll tear the whole to pieces! mainly
To please myself. What?s that??a glass of wine!
With pleasure, sir, so let us bob together.
And now proceed, my gallant grey goose feather.
XXXVI.
If I remember right my story?s trail,
Gripfast was greeted by his thirsty friends,
Who, as yon may imagine, did n?t fail
To land him to laudation?s utmost ends:
For well they knew the right way to assail
Him ; and, just like a little lamb that wends
Its way to slaughter yard, he step?d within
The tidy parlor of the way-side inn.
XXXVII.
But tho? he?d had a glass of grog or two,
He was n?t drunk, but just a little jolly,
Like Burns?s topers, when ? we are nae fou,?
Burdened that song that murdered melancholy.
I. wish to goodness that I had a few
Of his ideas, and I?d show the folly,
The cant, hypocrisy, and sinful ways,
That most of people have got now-a-days!
But that?s impossible, because I?m but
A mediocre kind of half-bred poet,
Without the least sublimity: I ?m not
Troubled with sentimentalism, I know it,
Without being told : nor would I, for the glut
Of such just now is too alarming; lo ! it
Can be seen in every daily paper,
In verses, cutting every kind of caper!


XXXIX.
Odes, lyrics, lays of far less love than rubbish?
Sonorous (some say witty) stage addresses! .
And tradesmen, who are grovelling and grubbish,
Are fond of getting into rhyming messes!
The fact is, very addlepate and cubbish
Youth, is guilty of such like excesses:
So that I do not think it worth my while
*
To try the limping, lack-a-daisy style!
My Pegasus is no soft., ambling nag,
That?s fed on corn, and groomed to dazzling sheen,
Like what you see in dandy city drag,
Or bearing beauty over sylvan green !
?T is but a common stock-horse kind of fag,
Unpaced, ijntended, rough, but ? all serene.?
When need requires, and when the ?turf? can spare
A ?poet?s purse,? I ?ll try his metal there!
Meantime, lest this digressive kind of strain
Should tire your patience, gentle reader! merely
To please you. I will draw my running rein,
Altho? the pace is one I dote on dearly.
And so to fall into our story?s train,
Gripfast was not quite drunk, but very nearly,
When, at the table with his little daughter.
He sat beside those sons of rum and water!
? Solne wine!? he called ; and then upon his knee
He raised his child ?poor, prattling, little thing!
They were strange, rare friends that he chose for thee!
And much it grieves me of it here to sing.
But truth must out; like, buds upon the tree
At the returning smile of lusty spring.
And as my story hinges on this scene.
Dame delicacy must not intervene!
*? ,


XLIII.
? Behold! he said, ?my worthy friends, behold
The babe that heaven hath sent me in my age!
As it did unto Abraham of old,
According to the sacred volume?s page.
Is she not beautiful? worth all the gold
That ever tended avarice to assuage:? *
Look at her face, and say! did you e?er see
A prettier child than this upon my knee ?
XLIV.
?T is music when she prattles. List! My puss,
Come, tell the gentlemen the horsie?s name/.?
Popsy looked up, and, childlike, answered, ?Boose;?
A term so unpoetical and tame,
That caused one of his audience say, ?The deuce
With all such silly twaddle, by my fame !
For mischief .much I?ve seen, beyond all jesting,
Much prettier babes, and far more interesting! ?
? Sir,? answered Gripfast, wounded to the core,
? You?ve spoke disparagingly of my daiighter,
Thereby insulting me, the which before
I bear I ?ll suffer any kind of slaughter.
You low-born pack of scoundrels.? To the door
He staggered then, while in his arms he caught her,
His frightened babe, whose innocence had been
The cause of all this semi-warlike scene !
XLVI.
ï¿½
? Confusion! ? some of those behind exclaimed.
? The devil! ? said the ungallant Adonis ;
? How will we get his maudling anger tamed,
When that we know how cross his every bone is??
? Tush! ? said another, for invention famed ;
? This to some sport the grand foundation stone is ;
For,? ?drawing a pistol?? this I? 11 make him fire
At you??t is ball-less ?when you must expire,


XLVII.
?Or fall, and groan; leave all the rest to me.?
T will be tjie dearest shot he ever fired;
And o?er the fun we ?ll have a glorious spree! ?
Which having uttered, he at once retired.
And now, dear reader ! with permission, we
Will smoke a pipe; I fancy?t is required,
For, really, I (however you may feel)
Am struggling with perplexity a deal
XLVIII.
How to proceed, and nothing, I believe,
When in a fix, will get a man out better
Than a quiet smoke; most cares it can relieve
Of those who fill a throne, or galling fetter.
Do you from grief or torture seek reprieve
More certain than a crown?s forgiving letter ?
Just try a pipe, sure antidote of ills, ?
Like Doctor L. L. S ?s herbaceous pills !
XLIX.
A smartish fellow is that Doctor S
(He lives in Bourke Street East, ycleped ?great?);
Slender in form, but like a wattle lith;
And, but for lack of whiskers, would create
More stir among the modern leeches? kith,
I?m sure he?s worthy of a piece of plate!
So now, young men, please lay this hint to heart,
And get lists ready ; I will be my part!
Merit should always meet it?s due reward.
Do n?t think I?m selfish when I say this say,
Or that, in sweet perspective, I regard
A tribute to the author of this lay ! '
Perhaps, if it was offered me, in hard
Cash, or any such substantial -wav,
I might be tempted to accept the same;
But hang your stones, and monuments of fame !

18 THE SHOT.
LI.
They ?re only humbug; but a piece of plate,
Such as I hope this L. L. S. will get,
Could be converted (if it was one?s fate
To be hard-up for money) into net
Proceeds; a similar thing occurred of late,
To my own knowledge, only that the debt
For which?t was sold, was one you often see
Assisted by the Official Assignee!
?T is a fine haven, that Insolvent Court
For swindling rascals, and adventurous knaves,
Who, on the wings of paper-money, sport
Like porpoises upon the ? sad sea waves ! ?
If I?d my way, I?d have no such resort ;
Justice should have the meed it vainly craves!
Swindlers would feel the convicts? irons? weight
Instead of five pounds weekly from th? estate!
But hold! you jade ; ?I mean my gentle muse?
We ?re dabbling with political affairs :
And, as they always seem to me abstruse,
Creating only arguments, and cares,
We?d best return, and take another cruise
Among our more legitimate rhyming wares.
My pipe is out; so now for one straight run,
And then our tale, dear reader, will be done.
Gripfast was seated in another room,
Chewing the insult that he could n?t swallow,
And many a bitter thought, you may presume,
Rang, like a bell, within his brainpan?s hollow,
?The wretch,? he cried, ?his hide I?d like to groom
With a good wattle; drat the vulgar fellow!
I ?ll teach him thus to tell me to my face??
But here invention?s hero stormed the place.
i ' % A


'

?> '
Which choked some dread anath?ma at its birth.
h i iend Giipfast, said he, while his face pronounced
Most deep concern, ? I wonder what on earth
Induced that fool, who merits to be trounced.
With sheers to spoil our evening?s social mirth ?
If Ijwere y OU , I would n?t thus be bounced; '
I?d hsre revenge, and spoil his pretty figure; ?
At least, 1 d try twelve paces and hair-trigger I
" LVI.
? Right! ? answered Gripfast, stretching forth his hand;
? Get me a pistol, and I ?ll shoot him dead ! ?
And speedily fulfilled was this demand?
Loaded with powder and pretended lead.
Then like field-marshal-general, of some grand
Array of troops, he raised his groggy head,
And crying, ? Blood and thunder,? off he went,
On something close allied to murder bent.
He ope?d the room door where the cronies sat
Li deep amaze, suspense, or some such feeling,
Mingled, at times, with speculative chat,
And looks at windows, door, chairs, floor and
All fancied tho? none smelt the proper rat [ceilinï¿½-;
I hat on their vision shortly would be stealing.
I said, he ope?d the door, and, sad to tell,
Bang went the pistol, and the victim fell!
lviii.
He fell and groaned, like hero in a play ;
The rest yelled forth a cry of feigned ?alarm,
The ? Doctor,? was the order of the day,
And ? Seize the murderer, bind him?leg and arm.?
Gripfast a moment viewed the form that lay
Quivering like leaf within a whirlwind?s charm
Then cried, ?Oh God! not for the Koh-i-noor
Would I have had this man?s blood at my door!?

LIX.
But that repentant cry was all too late;
The deed was done, he thought beyond undoing,
And so, bewailing his unlucky fate,
He moved to an adjoining chamber, chewing
The cud of sins commited! Meanwhile, griat
Commotion in the tragic room was brewmg.
? Water, for Good?s sake,! Fetch the doctor, ï¿½uick!?
He would have fled ?but consternation?s spell
Was on him, and retained him in ?the.spot.
And, like all sinners, on his knees he fell,
Praying that heaven his many sins would blot
Out of it?s ledger. But?t were vain -to dwell
On all he uttered, and on all he thought;
For after each remorseful word or two,
He groaned, ?Alas! what other could I do?"
The doctor, who is doing all he can,
Says that the ball some fatal spot has neared,
And he must die; but that his earthly span
May be prolonged with stimulating drinks,
Such as a bottle of champagne, he thinks."

Again the schemer of the plot appeared.
? What news,"askedGriplast, ?of the wounded man?"
? Alas!? he said, ? the worst is to be feared!
LXII.
? Oh! ? answered Gripfast, groaning fit to freeze,
? Take him a case, if that will aught avail;
Let nought be wanting that will give him ease.
Poor fellow! ?t is a sad end to his tale!
And do n?t forget to tell thï¿½ waiter, please,
To charge the same to me.? |# V I will not fail,?
The schemer said, and then turned to depart,
Grief in his face, and pleasure in his heart.
