?Fleurette?
A ROMANCE
ROSE SEATON
/Bbelbourne:
E. W. COLE, Book Arcade


Zo m? flbotber.
STNTO mine altar garlanded with flowers,
Pluck?d from the silent Vale of Memory,
And bright with incense-flame of Love and Peace,
I bring my gift.
It may be some may smile, and some may frown,
Thinking the gift too mean, the theme too old,
The fancy dull;
Yet, by the Hope that feeds our Lamp of Life,
Casting a glamour o?er th? unequal path
We daily tread,
If one should think the work not done in vain,
Sweeter the incense and the flowers will grow
Upon the shrine.


FLEURETTE.
Canto.?l.
long days, after long days of toil
Sweet rest may come; after long days of strife
A holy calm; of grief, a steadfast joy.
All this may be. Yet, after weary days,
If we should reach the portal of the grave,
And find nor rest, nor calm, nor steadfast joy,
Only the bitter turmoil of the world,
The pain of vanished love, the struggling race
Clutching the skirt of Immortality;
If, ere the trembling hand can ope the door
That leads to the dim mansions of the dead,
A voice should pierce the spirit?s inmost sense,
? She hath done what she could,? then, all is well.
We need more faith. Behold our works are nought,
And rendered oft for hire or gratitude,
Or to be seen of men. The gift is great
But in proportion to the sacrifice,
And Gratitude is coy, and hides her face.
Why should we serve for thanks, or stay our hand
Because an angel sleeps?


They of the city often think how safe
From sin?s temptation must those people be
Who dwell in quiet hamlets far away.
How beautiful their lives ?mid pastures green,
With flowers, and birds, and sheep, and lowing kine.
And, passing through the village, summer-time,
They see the children playing in the hay,
The men at rest under the spreading trees,
The women chatting at a neighbour?s door,
And take a gleam of sunshine back again
To the dull office, and the crowded street,
And thoughts of peaceful, happy, country life.
Would this were really so! Would canker?d Care
Could turn his footsteps from the peasant?s cot!
Head stockman to the squire was Richard Bourne,
A man, honest and true as man can be,
Who holds his master?s welfare as his own,
And tends his beasts with faithful kindliness.
Type of the ? good old days ? was Richard Bourne,
Blest with a housewife careful and sedate,
Janet, whose worth glow?d in the cottage clean?
The long, low cottage, with its whitewashed walls,
And tiny casements diamond-window-paned;
With trellis?d porch, where the red rose and white.


Jasmine, and honeysuckle intertwin'd.
Amid a meadow far adown the lane,
Bord?ring the fair possessions of the squire,
The little cottage stood. By front and side
The well-stored garden bound it, and behind
The pasture lands stretched to the shallow brook,
That babbled merrily by banks of flowers,
Meadow-sweet, raeged-robin, and the blight
And blue foreet-me-not. There lived these twain
Happy in simple duty and in love.
One child was theirs, one daughter, for whose sake
The father strove to store his earnings up,
And the fond mother's subtle needle wrought
At aprons, caps, and quaint embroideries.
For Annie now was up in London-town,
A handmaid to the ladies of the Hall.
A bonnie, winsome lass and proud wflhal,
Who toss?d her head at all the country youth,
And scorned to dance at fair and festival.
At which the women-folk had much to say.
? She?ll want a special sweetheart made for her;
A stuck-up wench, who ne?er will come to good.
? Who ne?er will come to harm, the pretty maid!?
Janet and Richard oft in pride would say.


And, seated by the fire on winter nights,
Spoke of their Annie in the far-off town;
And conn?d her letters over one by one.
Then, in their simple way, they render?d thanks
To Heaven for all the blessings on them pour?d.
But, one still eve, when Christmas snow was white,
And all was joy and bustle at the Hall,
In expectation of the squire?s return,
Richard came reeling in with blood-shot eyes,
And Janet stared upon him, whispering low,
?What ails thee, Richard? Speak! what ails thee,
man ??
But he, speechless and grim, flung wide his arms
Athwart the table, writhing in his pain.
Then Janet loosed the kerchief from his neck,
And chafed his hands, and feared her man would die.
There came a gentle rapping at the door;
She open?d it, and, shrouded in her furs,
Sybil, the fairest lady of the Hall.
?Oh! Janet Bourne,? she said, a I could not rest
Knowing your grief.? And, coming in, she saw
The husband bow?d, and the wife?s puzzled face
Of ignorance. ?Oh! Janet, she is gone?


Annie is gone!? ? Gone!? said the mother, ? Gone!?
What do you mean? Gone ... Is my Annie dead??
And her long wail smote on the father's heart,
And up he rose, ? Not dead . . . nay . . . worse
than that.
Gone with a stranger ?fled to burning shame.?
? Nay, Richard Bourne, have patience,? Sybil said,
? Until we know the truth. Some girlish freak.
She will return. What . . . Annie, Annie Bourne,
That we have loved so long . . . no, Janet, no!
Thy mother?s heart will not permit the thought
That she has fled to shame.? So Sybil spoke,
And clasped the mother?s hand, who murmur?d low,
?Heaven bless thee, lady! she will come again.?
But the man hid his face within his hands,
Crying, ? I shall behold my child no more.?


Canto, 11.
FOND father, standing by the lowly grave
Of thy dead daughter, there is peace for thee
Peace, in the thought of pretty childish ways;
Peace, in remembrance of her maidenhood,
Her grace, her purity; and greater peace
That Death is not the end and goal of Life.
And Time brings sweeter peace, till in the house,
Empty and desolate, she fills her place,
Invisible, and present in thy love.
But, oh! fond father, to have lost thy child,
And know her living! Every day to see
The unasked question in the neighbours? eyes
To steel thyself against the pitying glance,
Until thy sorrow turns to bitterness,
Closing thy heart against the daughter frail,
Who left thy sheltering care for love less pure.
So winter fled, and summer came again,
But not one word of Annie. And the fields
Grew golden till the reapers gather?d in
The treasure for the happy Harvest Home.
And all the hedge-rows burnt with crimson glow
Of autumn berries, till the Christmastide.
But she came not again.


And Richard grew
A moody, silent man. and stern of face.
Only the sheep dog and the mild-eyed kine
Witness?d the strong man?s agony and tears.
And Janet stayed more constantly at home;
Yet, when the household wants took her abroad
Into the village, she would speak with hope
To Questioning gossip, ? She will come again.?
For villagers are not Samaritans
To bind the gaping wound. They love to stand
And argue on the probability
Of life and death unto some struggling wretch.
Wisdom in social matters is immense
In quiet hamlets, and Propriety,
Decorum, have their sacred altar-fires.
Yet many pitied Janet, showed her love;
While others thought she had made Annie vain.
? Young girls who toss the head think honest lads
As dirt beneath their feet. ? Pride must have falls.? ?
Then came dark days. A fatal accident
Laid Richard low, and, worn with grief and pain,
He died. Then Janet?s nephew, Robin, came
And lived with her in the low, whitewashed cot,
Filling the place of stockman to the squire.


For Robin, in his rough and peasant way,
Loved Annie Bourne, and secretly had longed
To win her for his bride, and in his heart
Linger?d the hope that she would come again.
So worked and waited with the faithful zeal
Of a dumb animal, who vainly longs
To hear the voice of his dead master call.
Again the roses blossom?d round the porch;
And the brown bees hummed in the garden-close;
Peace lay on meadow and on rippling stream;
The rooks had ended their long argument,
Save now and then some solemn orator
Could scarce resist one exclamation more;
Peace everywhere, for ?twas the time of prayer,
And in the ancient wooden-crested church
The benediction fell on kneeling folk.
Then, through the lane, touched with the holy calm,
Janet and Robin took their homeward way.
And there, within the porch, a child asleep.
A little baby girl, with lily face
Set in a glistening cloud of golden hair.
There, ?mid the roses, peacefully she slept.
The dainty petals of a crimson pride
Lay scatter?d on her breast, bending perchance
In homage to its Queen; its golden heart
Unnoticed left to wither on the stem.


And Janet stood and gazed in silent awe,
Until, as when a sleeper dreams that one
Long lov?d and lost is standing by the bed,
The child opened its lovely eyes and smiled.
And Janet clasp?d the baby to her breast,
Who show?d no fear, but coo?d and stroked her cheek,
And Robin look?d at Janet and the child,
But spoke no word, until his steadfast gaze
Caught Janet?s eager glance, then turned away .
But, ?Annie, Annie, Annie,? beat his heart.
And Robin went about through all the town,
But none had seen the bringer of the child.
Some said a gipsy had been seen about;
Others had seen a carriage swiftly borne
By dark and prancing steeds, but nothing more.
And e?en these stories came from idle folk
Loit?ring on benches at the alehouse door,
Who speak for no disinterested end.
And all the village came to see the child ?
The squire himself, the ladies of the Hall?
And Lady Sybil would have ta?en the child,
For love of its rare beauty, as her own.
But Janet said, ? Not so, the gift is mine,
Laid at my door, and I will guard it well.


And when they questioned what the name should be,
Then Janet show?d a little golden cross
Which hung suspended by a slender chain
Around the baby neck, bearing one side
The figure of the Crucified; the next,
Deep graved, the word, ? Fleurette.? Then Sybil told
The meaning of that word?? A little flower.?
So she was called Fleurette.


Canto.?in.
Dear Heart, wherein Love makes his holy shrine,
Thou canst not wander in the darken?d ways,
Where doubt, despair, and discontent abide.
What joy to linger by Adonis? side,
To see the love-blush mantle on his cheek,
To watch the love-light sparkle in his eyes,
To answer to the silver-fluted voice,
Making the springtime all a song of love!
Oh, wealth of summer days, fulness of joy!
Oh, dark and cruel winter, he is gone!
Yet, hie thee, gentle heart, into the fields,
The clouds are passing, and the sun is bright,
A faint perfume comes from the woodlands dim,
Where white flowers rise tinged with a purple stain,
There thou shalt welcome thy sweet love again.
Hark to the many-noted winged choir,
Chirping and twittering of Hope and Spring.
Go, find him, he is changed, but he is there.


And day by day lighter grew Janet?s heart,
Deeper her love towards the stranger child.
? She fills the void left by my Annie?s flight,
Yet robs her not, but keeps the fountain clear
And bubbling at the source, though it ne?er could fail.?
Yet never spoke she of that daughter lost.
And the child grew to maiden, evermore
Keeping the beauty of her lily face.
Thoughtful beyond her years, and oft enwrapt
In dreams of an enchanted land, whose light
Filled all her soul with song. Yet one desire
Threw down its shadow o?er her peaceful life,
The long, deep yearning for a mother?s love.
Hidden within her breast the secret lay,
Lest Janet?s heart should know another pain.
For though no word between the twain had passed,
And Robin, too, had silence kept, the tale,
Or something of it, to the child was known.
And from the mystery a dream she wove,
And pictured Annie in some distant land,
Until at last, a strain of harmony,
A long-forgotten air, melting her soul,
She left her fairy palace and returned.
But never could her fancy stray beyond


That blest return; and in the tiny room,
Kneeling beside the window ?neath the eaves,
She prayed that Janet?s hope might be fulfilled,
And her great longing satisfied at last.
Sometimes the kindly ladies of the Hall
Would let her linger in the gallery,
And spacious rooms enriched with works of art.
And Lady Sybil told the histories
Of the quaint Dames in stiff embroidery,
And gallant Knights in wondrous armour clad.
And sometimes play in the white drawing-room
Sweet harmonies in the dim twilight hour,
And sing the child songs of a foreign land,
Joyful and tender, with a soft refrain.
The fields were touched with the first hues of spring
When Cyril Fairlie saunter?d down the lane.
An artist-soul had he to recognise
True harmonies; an artist-hand to write
Those beauties down. And at the garden gate
Fleurette was standing, all her golden curls
Blown in a tangle by th? ungentle breeze.


And Cyril stared, and passed, and turned again
Once more to see the wonder at the gate,
And saw the lily face, the earnest eyes
Filled with a girlish, bashful admiration,
And raised his hat, and smiled, and passed along.


Canto? IV.
The woods are gay when birdlings nest again.
And the blue hyacinth a carpet spreads.
Happy the streamlet when amid the reeds
The brilliant dragon-flies like jewels flit.
And happy is the heart of guileless maid
When Love?s sweet eyes have rested on her face,
And hand in hand they wander in that realm
Where all the rest are shadows but themselves.
For many days he loiter?d at the inn,
And watched her pass adown the village street,
Then saunter?d by the cottage in the lane,
And, seeing Janet, asked her leave to paint
The porch, the rustic roof, the latticed pane.
And while he spoke, the maid came from the field,
Clad in a cotton gown of lilac hue,
Coarse apron, and far coarser country shoes;
But the great lustrous eyes, the rippling hair,
Made these poor things as nought.
And when she saw


The man, a crimson glow swept o?er her face,
As timidly she curtesied low to him.
Day after day he came and slowly wrought;
And once must Janet sit within the porch,
And then the maid. And all the time he talked
Of country life, of birds, legends of flowers,
And watched the lovely soul arise and grasp
The poetry of Nature and of Art.
And joying thus, because his quest was found,
Because the triumph of his art was near,
Full light of heart he grew, and all the power
Of his enchantment flashed to life again.
He spoke of beauty, and of old-time loves,
Antigone, Elaine, and Juliet,
Whose love withstood more than the fear of death,
The living horror of the charnel-house.
And the maid listen?d, all her heart aflame,
Even the yellow wildflower of the field
Took added beauty from the tale he told.


ftbe Cviol jflower.
White ?gainst the azure sky
Seamews are flying;
Low to the crested wave,
The winds are sighing.
The cliffs are bleak and bare
The castle towers in air,
Massive and strong.
Long has that castle stood,
Guarded by warriors good,
Renowned in song.
Now in the stately Hall
Its lord is standing.
A warrior stern is he
Of mien commanding.
Yet ever does he turn
Glances with pride that burn
To one beside;
A fair and lovely maid,
In garments rich arrayed,
Meet for a bride.


His only daughter, dear
Beyond all measure,
His chief delight, the heir
Of all his treasure.
Yet at his king?s decree
He must across the sea,
In armour dight.
So, lest his life be sped,
His child he fain would wed
To gallant knight.
Within her heart, not yet
Love?s song is ringing.
To maiden cheek and brow
No colour bringing.
She stands erect and proud
Among the lordly crowd,
With steadfast eye;
Yet to her father?s will,
Bows she submissive still
And cheerfully.


Around her throng nobles
In armour gleaming,
Young knights lovelorn, their eyes
With rapture beaming.
And presents gay they bear,
Rich stuffs and jewels rare,
That well may make,
Her smile upon the knight,
Rest for a moment bright,
For his gift?s sake.
So pass they one by one
Before the maiden,
Brave knight and stalwart lord,
With treasure laden;
Yet in her sunny face,
Ne?er can they find a trace
Their hope to move.
Nor yet may she refuse,
Out of that train to choose
One for her love.


At length, a noble knight,
In courtly vesture,
Advances to the dais
With lofty gesture;
No precious gift has he,
And low, but haughtily,
He bows the knee.
?Lady,? he cries, ?behold!
I have nor gem nor gold,
To offer thee.
? Scorn I t? esteem my love
As golden glitter,
Nathless I bear a gift
Both fair and fitter;
A flower rare and sweet,
I lay before thy feet,
Tended with care,
And safe through perils past,
Brought to these shores at last
From Eastern air.?


Within her hand, she clasps
The golden flower,
?Welcome, oh! knight, art thou,
Long in my bower
This beauteous gift shall live,
And thou, who thus canst give
Such tender care
To blossom frail and weak,
Ne?er shall my fond heart seek
Farther to rove.
? For thou art conqueror
By Love?s own glory,
And through our Kentish land,
Long shall this story
In loving hearts resound,
Till on the parched ground
Of cliff or nower,
Where?er this plant shall spring,
Love to its love shall bring.
The Criol flower.?


? Is always love so happy?? said the maid.
? Not so, dear child, for love is like a dream,
And oft the sleeper wakes to bitter tears.
But blest are they who keep through silent years
The fair unbroken image in their souls.
There is a castle towers upon a hill,
Shatter?d and lonely, where the wild birds build.
Over the ancient walls the ivy steals,
Binding them fast within its clasping arms.
But once that castle rang with martial shouts,
And of that olden time a legend runs.


ftbe of i�nmefcean.
?Mid the ruins old of the castle proud,
It is sweet to sit and rest,
And in fancy people the massive tower,
Where the jackdaws build their nest;
Where of old dwelt knights and ladies gay,
Whose names and deeds have now passed away.
There, ?neath the arch where the clematis twines,
I picture a lady stand.
Can you see the folds of her soft white robe,
And the golden cross in her hand?
No high-born ladye is fair, I ween,
As Blanche, the Lady of Ennisdean.
But the knights and nobles of high degree,
Who lay their love at her feet,
Go sighing and sad from the ladye?s bower,
Away from her presence sweet.
?She never will love,? they cry aloud;
? Heartless as faerie, and cold and proud.?


But the peasants worship the ladye?s smile,
And her voice so soft and low,
As they kiss the hem of her broider?d robe
When she passes to and fro,
Tending the hungry and poor who wait,
Daily for help at the castle gate.
Oh, Sir Hubert de Vere, so young and strong,
Why do you linger behind,
While your comrades flock to the Eastern land,
And solace in glory find?
Do you think that slothful ease will prove,
You worthy to claim a ladye?s love??
? Oh, Lady Blanche, what is fame to me,
If your love I may not gain?
Grant me your favour to wear in fight,
That when I return again,
Living or dying, the world may see,
I have ventured only for love of thee.?


But she turned away with a gesture proud,
Disdaining him word or sign.
So he mounted his steed and sallied forth
To conquer in Palestine.
Slowly he rode by the archway green,
For the love of the Lady of Ennisdean.
But under the archway the ladye stands,
Antf a cross she holds on high,
? Have you conquered Love, that you part so soon
And come not to say good-bye??
? Oh, Lady Blanche, to the far countree,
Lonely I journey for love of thee.?
?Oh, Hubert de Vere, not loveless and lone,
Thou bearest my heart away,
In token whereof this crosslet of gold,
I place in thy hand to-day.
Unloved, unwedded will I remain,
Until thou bringest this gift again.?


But the years flew by without word or sign,
Till at last a pilgrim told
Of fever and wounds and a captive?s death
In relentless Paynim hold.
? My pride and my love thy bane have been,
Low moaned the Lady of Ennisdean.
Sweet rose the incense, and masses were said,
Said for his spirit?s repose,
And on that ladye so lovely and bright
The gates of the convent closed.
Solace and calm o?er the soul doth move
Kneeling in prayer to the Cross-bound Love.
Oh, her locks are grey, that with gold once shone,
And her eyes are dimm?d with tears;
She dwells in the cloister, saintly and meek,
With a memory of tears;
Gone is the beauty and haughty mien
Of Blanche, the Lady of Ennisdean.


But still at the gate of the convent, calm
As of yore, goes up the cry
Of passionate love, from the poor whose pain,
Is soothed by her charity.
And ever the love of the sad and mean,
Is sweet to the Nun of Ennisdean.
At last, at the close of an evening grey,
A palmer, weary and old,
Put into the hand of the Lady Blanche
The longed-for circlet of gold.
? Peace to his soul,? she gently said.
? Peace to the living, Peace to the dead.?
And the palmer gazed long and tenderly
Into the face of the nun,
And he knew that the grace of Heaven was there,
And the strife of earth was done.
? Peace to his soul,? he gently said.
? Peace to the living, Peace to the dead.?


He ceased, and, for a little, all was still.
For to find peace is blessed. Would that I,
For to find peace is blessed. Would that I,
Praying, might have my prayer, or else, unwon,
Have faith to deem it best.? ? Tell me,? he cried,
? Dear maid, this mighty longing.? And forth sprung
Enwinged with hope the passionate desire
For the lost mother. And the story fell
With touching power, with deep intensity,
And Cyril?s heart was moved. ? Listen,? he said,
? When I have pictured thee, the fair Elaine,
Sitting before the shield of Lancelot,
That old-world story I have told to thee,
The golden cross shall glitter on thy breast,
And haply, in the myriads who come
To see the painting, one may know the charm,
The cunning workship of the antique chain,
And yield the clue. Then shall this toil become
A happiness.? ?No toil,? she cried, no toil.
Oh, the sweet days that you have linger?d here;
Oh, the great thoughts that fill my heart, my brain!
Ah, me! the darkness that will fall again
When you have gone.? Then paused and blushed.
and he,


Adept in hearts, was angry with himself.
?Ah, child! the shelter of this quiet bower
Has cast a ray of sunshine o?er my heart;
Its radiance will touch thee, fear thou not.
Man climbs the hill of Life, and finds it steep,
If his desire be fame. Ay, crooked ways,
And cruel, must he tread to win the crown.
Here, I am resting by a fountain cool,
A spring of crystal water undefiled.
I work because I love, because I must;
But not for wealth. Fame has a crown of flowers
Upon her steadfast forehead, and her lips
Are sweet with songs of youth. Not always thus!
I spent my time in idleness and sport,
I saw the best in literature and art,
And though I felt I could do something great,
I let the time go by in dulcet ease.?
Let those who love the struggle win the prize.?
But now I cry out, ? Shame upon myself!
What useless lumber cumbering the ground!
From this dull sleep a woman waken?d me.
A dark-brow?d siren, crown?d with nut-brown hair;
A dainty Queen of Song, through all the world
Known as Anita. At her word I saw


The hideous mockery of the life I led,
The talent laid aside, that should have gained
More lustre, being used for nobler ends.
The worth of high example, which the soul,
Untrammell?d by the meaner clogs of earth,
(Poverty, and the thousand ills it owns)
Can give, to cheer the feebler race along.
And a great longing grew, not to have lived
In vain, but to have wrought some thing of beauty,
Something pure and sweet, to glad the eyes of men.
For her sake first I strove, but still she frown?d,
And then through her sake to the higher range,
For God, and for mankind. Rich I am still
Ay, richer by my toil, and more in love.
In the far south, margin?d by woods of pine,
A homestead stands, where little children play,
Built and supported by those works of mine.
There year by year the sickly London babes
Grow into rosy girls and boys, who bless
Her name . . . Anita?s name. . . .
Not mine the merit, although mine the joy,
But mine the longing that can never cease
To claim this dainty singer for mine own.?


The swallow gently twitter?d from her nest;
Across the fields came Robin slowly home;
A tear fell softly on her folded hands,
And o?er her fell a sudden icy chill.
Then, up she rose, conscious that he was gone,
Conscious that mists were stealing o?er the land,
And deeper shadows o?er her summer day.
? Anita, make him blest,? she murmur?d low,
? Oh, my dear love . . . not mine, Anita . . . thine


Canto.?V.
Dark autumn days and snows of winter gone,
Spring peeps with radiant face thro? budding trees,
And finds a pleasure lost, a triumph won.
For there is pain in triumph, when the will
And nerves their tension lose, to rest from thought
Of added beauty, and to know, alas!
That what is done, is done, and stands for aye.
? Klaine before the shield of Lancelot.?
Such was the title of the masterpiece.
And many came to gaze and criticise,
And marvel at the beauty of the maid,
Till all were gone, and Cyril Fairlie sat,
Wearied, within his studio alone.
His thoughts Hew backward to the cottage white,
The gentle maiden and her fond desire,
And to his lips unbidden rose the song,
A plaintive air that she had often sung.
He paused, and, lo! a voice took up the note,
Filling the twilight hour with melody.


JEhe Xittle jflower.
I fade, I die,
Lying upon thy breast,
Most exquisite and fair,
My rapture unexpressed,
Save by the perfumed air.
Once in the summer sun, ?mid blossoms
I was the fairest, born to die for thee.
free,
I fade, I die,
And all forgotten quite
My loveliness will be;
Yet every petal white
Joyful expires for thee.
If thou hadst left me lonely on the tree,
Life had been long, but full of misery.


I fade, I die,
But in thy garden-bowers
Ever new forms will rise
To wither hapless flowers,
At glance of thy sweet eyes.
What is my love ? What is my life to thee,
That, dying, leaves not e?en a memory?
? Anita!? Cyril cried. ? Yes, I have come
To see your masterpiece. You sing my song,
Therefore you think of me.? ?Of you always,
Sweet singer; yet I do confess to-day
My thoughts were otherwhere.? ?Traitor at last!
? Not so.? ? But let me look upon your work,
This picture, which you say you paint for me,
This highest effort of your noble art,
Which grew, you tell me, only at my word.
Oh, God! the chain, the cross, my daughter?s face!
What is she here, in this great wilderness ?
A painter?s model! Oh, my little flower!
Speak, man! my heart will break.?
? She is not here.
No frost has touched your Fleurette. She is safe
In the white cot which shelter?d Annie Bourne.


? Thank God! Oh, Gyril, though you know my name,
My life is hidden from you. And I vowed
To tell you all. Listen. The hour is now.
I came to London, everything was new
And wonderful. Beauty and wealth I saw,
And all the power and pleasure that it brings.
And there was one came to the London house?
One, Gerald Hastings, handsome, fair, and rich.
And there were many fain Had won the man,
But he was cold, and weary of the whirl
Of women ever striving after wealth.
He longed to creep away and be at peace.
And so he look?d on me, a serving-maid,
And I ... he was a very God to me.
I was his wife, bound by a sacred oath
Never to hold communion with my friends.
Father and mother ?yea, those loving souls ?
I left to follow him. Ah! was I wrong?
Let the sweet maid within your picture speak,
Who died for love. ... We fled to Italy,
Leaving no trace. Swiftly the year flew by.
A little flower upon my bosom lay,
So fair, so very fair. My tears fell fast,
Thinking of those dear, loving ones at home.


Yet for my oath?s sake did I give no sign.
One day an old Italian master heard
Me sing a lullaby over the babe,
A song he loved for his dead daughter?s sake.
And day by day he came to teach me more.
But shadows cross?d our path. The loss of gold,
And worse?ay, worse?th? unhinging of the mind
Till the child grew a terror, and the wife . . .
Well, the wife stays for better or for worse.
And so I bade the old Italian take
The little child, home to our English land,
That Gerald ne?er might hear of it again.
Long time I waited on this death in life,
And, thanks to the old master, found a means
To gather wealth again. And the long days
Of toil and training past, the world received,
Anita, priestess at the shrine of song . . .
Anita, who has neither kith nor kin.
I laugh to read the story of my life.
An orange-seller, some declare, and some,
The left-hand scion of a princely race. ?
And ladies copy the ? Anita ? walk,
While gowns and trinkets, parasols and hats
Are styled ? Anita ? in the merchants? shops.


Offers of marriage come by frequent posts,
And music from the young ambitious souls
Who sigh to taste the hippocras of life.
The wine is bitter when the kindred soul
Has left the banquet, and our early loves
Are gone, or buried in a living tomb.
For now at Life?s great feast I sit alone,
Unbound by promise, for the man is dead
Yet faces that with love had greeted me,
I dare not meet again . . . never again v
?Oh, Annie Bourne, love is not dead! Within
The same white cottage, a fond mother waits,
And flower-clad porch re-echoes to the tread
Of maid, who yearns for unknown mother?s love.?
?Ah, friend, it is too late! How can I meet
The unspoken anguish of those vanish?d years,
Or how rejoin the broken chain, whose links
Have perish?d in the dark abyss of death?
I am not Annie Bourne, for she is dead.?
But Cyril answer?d, full of passion?s fire,
? Oh, not too late, love knoweth not that word!
Love waiteth, hoping, longing, loving still.
Oh! not too late, though through the mist of tears,
Lips meet, and hands clasp hands. Words are so cold,
And thought is full of fear, Love is divine,
?Tis the warm human presence makes it so.?


ZTFTER long years, after long years they meet,
The child and mother, mother and the child.
The story ceases, but the threads still run.
Gather them, if you will, and weave anew
For me, I have no heart to utter more,
Knowing, though hearts beat quick, yet faces keep
The cold mask of conventionality;
Knowing the tears that do not dare to fall,
But ice-bound glitter in their crystal lakes;
The trembling lips that part in mournful smiles;
The passionate cry that breaks into a laugh.
Go, nest the tropic bird in swallows? home,
Under the brown eaves in our northern land;
Or ask the brilliant butterfly to float,
Carelessly, on the cruel winter blast;
But seek not to unveil our English heart.
There lurk the passions known In other lands,
But crush?d and conquer?d with a stalwart will;
Hidden from sight of others, lest they charge
That soul with weakness, and with want of faith.
Then take the threads and weave them if you will,
But enter in that dwelling-place alone,
Where grief, and joy, and memory entwine,
The ground is sacred, I will stand without.
