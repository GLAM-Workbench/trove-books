The object of the founders of the College was to give thoroughly sound instruction
in the literary as well as the artistic branches of a lady’s education. In carrying out
the plan, care has been taken to secure the very best teachers; and, as a result,
the College now occupies an unrivalled position as a school for girls. To the
Matriculation Examinations during the past two years, 26 pupils have gone up,
and of these 25 have passed, 4 with credit, the total number from all schools in the
colony who have gained credit during these years having been only 17.
The school buildings are healthily situated, facing Fitzroy Gardens, with a view
of the Bay. Every attention is given to boarders; and as the house has been
specially erected for the purposes of a boarding-school, the accommodation is un-
usually good. A large garden and a gymnasium afford opportunity for exercise.
The 4th term begins October 5, but pupils are admitted at any time.

These Inks will be found the most suitable of all Inks or Fluids for use in AUS-
TRALIA, INDIA, CHINA, and other Hot Climates.
All other Inks contain Iron in one form or the other, which causes them to dry
up quickly, leaving a quantity of Thick Sediment, while they speedily corrode Steel
Pens. The Ink of Inks, being manufactured of Pure Carbons, without the use of
Iron in any form, will he found really Non-Corrosive, and free from sediment or

‘ The “ Ink of Inks” combines the ad-
vantages of a copying and ordinary
writing ink, as it can be used for both
purposes, and it does not corrode or clog
the pen in hot weather, which is a great
point in these colonies. The “Pen of
Pens,” we can assert from practical ex-
perience, is an excellent one.’—Akgus,
May 8, 1878.
‘ Mr. M. L. Hutchinson, of 15 Collins
Street, has forwarded us a sample of
Thacker’s Violet Black Writing Ink. It
is highly spoken of by some of the
.English papers, and appears to possess
fthe advantages claimed for it. We have
.also to acknowledge the receipt of some
•sample Pens manufactured by Thacker

suitable for almost every description of
writing.’—Melbourne Daily Tele-
geaph, May 3, 1878.
‘We have received samples of a new
ink and a new pen, introduced by Mr.
Hutchinson, of 15 Coliins-street West.
The ink is useful either for copying or

The pens are of such a shape as to pre-
vent the fingers from being soiled,
whilst they skim swiftly and easily over
the paper.’— Melbourne Age, May 4.

challenges comparison. We can only
say that if the pen we are writing

have rarely used a more comfortable pen,
and rarely seen finer ink.’ —The South-

PREFACE.
To help to awaken a deeper interest in the prosperity and
progress of the Colony, by diffusing information as to its capa-
bilities and requirements, is the main object contemplated by
the publication of this little book. Notwithstanding the draw-
backs incident to a new condition of things, we have reason to
be proud of our adopted home. A more genial climate, brighter
skies, or vaster resources are not to be met with on every shore.
A native-born, and therefore thoroughly Australian population
is growing up in our midst, and it is desirable that they should
be inspired with patriotic feeling, with warm attachment to the
land which has given them birth, and with a sterling interest in
all that pertains to its advancement.
We think, moreover, that the Colony is not so well known as
it ought to be in the Old Country. The Duke of Manchester,
in replying to the address of welcome presented to him by the
members of the Royal Colonial Institute, is reported to have
said ;—“ Those of us who have remained at home do not know
what you have accomplished. I should be glad if many would
make the journey I have done. They would learn to spread
your fame ; and my experience authorizes me to promise them a
most hearty welcome and unbounded hospitality.” There is
field for effort in making people in England better acquainted
with our history and resources.
It has been remarked that colonization is pre-eminently the
work of England, and that her sons—including, of course, the
Scotch and Irish—seem specially fitted by nature for the world’s
conquest. Not only so, but it is only in this way that com-
fortable homes can be provided for her thousands of surplus
population. Large portions of the world are yet to be possessed
and brought under the benign influence of civilization and
Christianity.
We have no desire to unsettle men who are doing well else-
where. Those who are comfortable at home had better remain


■where they are. And so, too, with those who have neither muscle,
nor enterprise, nor capital ; as a rule, the Colony is not the place
for them. But there are thousands of the right class in England
who are feeling that “ the land is not able to bear them.” They
are fain to step out into the wide world, and seek new homes on
some distant shore. But whither should they direct their
steps 1 This, with many, is a perplexing question. In the hope
of helping some of them in the solution of this question, this
small effort is put forth.
We do not seek to disparage other colonies. Canada grows
apace. New Zealand, though, like Victoria, meanwhile passing
through the cloud, has splendid resources, and has shown a
spirit of noble enterprise. New South Wales is full of vigour,
and, unless we start afresh, will leave us behind in the race.
South Australia and Queensland are “putting on strength.”
Tasmania is reviving. Western Australia, if slowly, is steadily
making way. Each one has its own special advantages, and
our desire is to see them all prosper. Ere long, it may be,
those on the Australian continent will become united in one
grand Dominion of the South, England’s youngest and fairest
daughter, presenting the embodiment of all that is great and
good in the noble Father-land, and a centre of enterprise, civi-
lization and progress to half a hemisphere.
The statistics we have given have been taken principally from
the last issue of the Victorian Year Book, compiled by H. H.
Hayter, Esq., Government Statist, and published under the
authority of the Government. Any available statistics that
have appeared more recently have also been taken advantage of.
The more important of these are brought up to within a few
weeks of publication.
The writer thankfully acknowledges his indebtedness to the
Victorian Year Book , the Argus and other Melbourne papers,
the Age Annual, and the Australian Handbook, for facts and
statements; and also to Mr. Hayter, Government Statist, Mr.
Ferres, Government Printer, and other gentlemen, who have
kindly afforded facilities in the matter of statistics.

OUR COLONY IN 1880.
CHAPTER I.
WHY WE WRITE.
The diffusion of correct information on the young colonies
of Australia is matter of importance. There is ample room
for it. Many people in the old countries are grossly ignorant
on the entire subject, and even among the intelligent classes
vague and grotesque ideas extensively prevail. This effort
is intended to be a small contribution towards the supply of
the desideratum. Our notes must necessarily be brief, and
will contemplate nothing more than the presentation of “ a
bird’s-eye view” of the leading interests and resources of
Victoria. Multum in parvo will be our motto. The
capabilities and pursuits of the colony —industrial, commer-
cial, pastoral and agricultural, as also its educational, social,
and religious condition, will be carefully epitomized. It
will be our endeavour to present only such information
as is thoroughly reliable. To lead, not to mislead, will be
our aim.
CHAPTER II.
FOR WHOM WE WRITE.
Speaking generally we write for those who desiderate
information. There are many among us whose knowledge
of the history and resources of our colony is extremely
limited. Our young people require to be educated as to the
capabilities of their native soil. The opening of our Inter-
national Exhibition will prove the occasion of a large influx
of strangers, not only from the neighbouring colonies but
also from more distant parts of the world, whereby oppor-
tunities for diffusing intelligence as to our position and
prospects will arise which it will be wise to embrace and
improve. But beyond these, there are large numbers of
B


people in the home country who, perchance, may be benefited,
and who in turn may benefit us, by being made. acquainted
with the facilities and advantages for settlement which
Victoria has to offer. This, we think, will appear from the
following considerations :
First; The population in England and other old-world
countries is overgrown. It is considerably in excess of the
natural capabilities of these countries. The result is over-
crowding, with its consequent and manifold evils. Elbowing
and jostling each other as they of necessity do in the
struggle for existence, it is not to be wondered at that
many should go to the wall. The weak and unbefriended
.are worsted in the fight. Failure, poverty, helplessness,
degradation, and despair are the inevitable results. This
is altogether an unnatural state of things —the more
especially when we consider that the world is so wide, and
that broad and fertile lands on many a shore invite
occupancy and promise abundant returns. We wish to
contribute, in a small way, to the relief of this overcrowding,
by directing faint and weary toilers in the struggle of life to
fresher fields of labour and newer homes.
Second : Emigration is one of the great facts of our times.
The number of emigrants from Great Britain to the different
colonies of Australia during the last eight years has
amounted to 245,490. During the same period, the
emigrants from Great Britain to British North America
have numbered 180,364; to the United States, 1,139,987 ;
and to other places, 113,098, The tide has of late been
deepening and widening in its flow. We would help in
directing a fair share of that emigration to these sunny
■shores.
Third ; There are many people in the old country who on
various grounds are entertaining the question, whether it
-would not improve their position and prospects to look for
a home in a new country. Some of these are perplexed by
the frequency with which they are without remunerative
employment, and the difficulty experienced in securing it.
Some have been losing ground in the struggle for existence
instead of gaining it. Others have large and increasing
families, and are weighed down by anxiety as to how they
-are to provide for them. Others are getting involved in
what may prove to be inextricable embarrassment, the black
2
Our Colony in 1880.


cloud of ruin settling down on their path. And others
again are animated by an honorable desire to better their
position in the world, and do not see how they can accom-
plish this amid the fierceness of the competition in business
life that characterises the crowded populations in the old
country. We would fain draw the attention of some of
these to a colony in which they may secure a new start in
life unencumbered by many of the difficulties which now
beset their way, and where the conditions of prosperity and
success are within the reach of all.
Fourth ; We have vast resources in this colony awaiting
development. The statistics of our wool and wine, our
wheat and gold, which are furnished elsewhere in this little
work, not only show what great things have been done
during “ the brief past ” of our history, but foreshadow yet
greater things to be accomplished in the future. Our
cereals may yet feed other nations. The markets of
England may ere long make unlimited demands on our
flocks and herds. Our wines are growing in popularity.
Our mines will yield gold for generations, perhaps centuries
to come. Other mineral wealth is stored in abundance in
our soil. What is wanted in order to the successful
development of these resources is capital and labour. Men
of enterprise, steady-going habits, persevering industry
and a little money to invest, could not find a more promising
field of operation perhaps in any country. We think it
desirable that this should be more widely known and better
understood among residents in the old country who would
like to better their position.
Fifth : More people are wanted for our colony. We are
but a handful. The natural rate of increase among our-
selves is utterly inadequate if we are to keep abreast of
other colonies in the race of progress. Through the keenness
of competition and the ambition to do business on a large
scale, the very limited field of population to be operated upon
is soon occupied to its utmost capacity, and the inevitable
consequence is stagnation. The ratio at which production
increases outruns that at which our consuming powers
increase. This is not as it ought to be in a young country.
It is said by some, “ Why bring others to the colony, while
there are numbers here already who are without employ-
ment 1” At first sight there appears to be some plausibility


about the question, but a moment’s consideration will show
that that plausibility is nothing more than seeming. And
at the outset it must be admitted that it looks very selfish
for any one who has come here to better his circumstances,
to prohibit others from following in his steps, from doing
simply what he himself has done. But we think the
following considerations deserve notice : —lst: In every
community of any extent there will always be some out of
employment. Some are incapable, some are fickle and
unsteady, others are simply idlers and loafers, and a few
who may be able-bodied and industrious will, through
business changes, occasional reverses, or recurring periods
of stagnation, be for a time without work. This is one of
the inevitable conditions of modern society. 2nd : This
state of things is neither prevented nor remedied by the
cessation of immigration. We have had the merest
sprinkling of people coming to the colony of late years, and
yet the cry of want of employment, instead of ceasing, has
only been growing more clamant. 3rd : The men who are
wanted, and who could easily be secured in the present condi-
tion of things in England, would, generally speaking, bring
with them more or less capital. They would circulate
money, consume commodities, and ere long employ labour ;
and would at once be an infusion of fresh energy into the
colony, and a stimulus to increased production. 4th : All
experience, as well as common sense and reason, teach
that a steady influx of people can alone be the making of a
young colony. The United States furnish an illustration of
this on a magnificent scale. Colonies that are wanting in
this increase, not only make no perceptible progress, but
quickly come to a standstill, and indeed generally retro-
grade. While we say these things, we are no advocates for
an indiscriminate or pauper immigration. But we say
again that we want an inflow of men of intelligence,
enterprise, and more or less capital to assist in the develop-
ment of our resources, and to make our colony what by
climate and resources it is fitted to be—the home of a
growingly prosperous and happy people. To assist in
bringing about this is one of the main objects of these pages.
These remarks will suffice to describe the classes for whom
more especially we write.


CHAPTER III.
AUSTRALIA.
The name is a family one, embracing a group of sister
colonies. These are New South "Wales, Victoria, South
Australia, Queensland, and "Western Australia. The territory
which is parcelled out among these may, from its large
dimensions, be styled a continent, or, from the fact of its
being entirely surrounded by water, it may be called an
island. It is sometimes described as an island-continent.
It contains close on three millions of square miles, being
about half the size of South America, or twenty-six times
the size of Great Britain and Ireland. It lies in the
southern hemisphere between 10° and 39° of latitude, and
113° and 154° of eastern longitude. Its boundaries are
the Indian Ocean on the west, the Pacific Ocean on the
east, Torres Strait on the north, and Bass’s Strait on the
South. Its greatest length from west to east is about 2500
miles, and its greatest width from north to south about
2000 miles. The distance between its nearest point and
England is calculated to be 11,000 miles. Its vast
interior, until within the last few years, was a terra
incognita. Recently, however, it has been becoming
better known. Since Burke and Wills crossed it in
1860, the work of exploration has gone steadily forward.
Large tracts have been found in the interior which are
almost waterless. Stony deserts also abound. Such
lands are meanwhile barren and worthless. At the same
time there are wide-spreading areas inland where the
soil is excellent, while the lands adjacent to the sea coast
are distinguished for richness and fertility. Probably four-
fifths of the entire island-continent may be considered as
suitable for pastoral or agricultural occupation. The first
settlement effected in Australia was located at Botany Bay,
New South Wales, in 1788.
CHAPTER IV.
DISCOVERY.
W ho was the earliest discoverer of Australia 1 The answer
to this question must he given with hesitancy. Fernandez
de Quiros, a Portuguese, claimed to have discovered a part
5
Our Colony in 1880.


of it in 1606. This, however, is doubted. Some Dutchmen
the same year descried the northern coast, while about the
same time Torres, who was in command of a part of a
Spanish expedition, sailed near to it, giving his name to the
Straits through which he passed. Various other discoveries
were made betwixt this time and 1770, when Captain Cook
explored a considerable portion of the east coast, took formal
possession, hoisted the British flag, and gave to the territory
the name of New South Wales. In 1802 Lieutenant John
Murray discovered Port Phillip Harbour, although, in so
far as mere dates go, Bass and Lieutenant Grant had
previously touched the southern coast. In the same year
Captain Flinders sailed up the Bay in the Investigator , and
helped greatly to fill up the outlines of the coast.
CHAPTER V.
VICTORIA.
With this colony in the Australian group these notes will
more particularly deal. Its story is worth telling. It is a
marvel even in an age of marvels. One of the youngest of
the southern colonies, in progress it has outvied them all.
Smallest in area of all the Australian group, it yet bulks
most largely in the eye of the world, in population, in
industrial interests, in commerce and in wealth. The
generation can scarcely be said to be past that saw its birth,
and yet it seems as though centuries were crowded into the
experiences and achievements of its natural life.
CHAPTER VI
POSITION AND SETTLEMENT,
Taking the map of Australia and glancing at its extreme
point on the south-east, you see a corner hounded on the
south by Bass’s Strait and on the north by New South
Wales, and exhibiting in shape somewhat of the appearance
of an irregular triangle. That is the colony of Victoria.
Its greatest length from east to west measures over 500
miles, and its extreme width from north to south 300 miles.
Its superficial area is a little over 55| millions of acres,
being only a very little less than the entire area of Great


Britain. The first attempt at settlement was made on the
shores of Western Port Bay in 1826, hut proved a failure.
After the lapse of some twelve months, the location was
abandoned. A more successful experiment was made in
1834 by the Messrs. Henty, of Tasmania. The locale of
their settlement was Portland Bay, in the western district.
On the richly-grassed lands adjacent to its shores, sheep and
cattle brought over from Tasmania were depastured, and in
this we have the commencement of that huge pastoral
interest, which, though the growth of less than half a
century, has made Victoria famous in other lands for its
wool-producing capabilities. In May, 1835, Mr. John
Batman landed with a party at Indented Heads, on the
west side of Hobson’s Bay (at that time known as Port
Phillip Bay), and thereafter sailed up the Yarra to the
neighbourhood of the small hill that bears his name (now
occupied with railway sheds), at the west end of Flinders-
sti-eet. On the 18th of October of the same year, Mr. John
Pascoe Fawkner landed with his household from Tasmania,
and formed a settlement on the site of what is now the city
of Melbourne. He is therefore entitled to the honour of
founding the magnificent metropolis of Victoria. Other
settlers followed in quick succession to try their fortunes in
the new and inviting country.
CHAPTER VII.
FIRST THINGS.
The first real settlement in the colony was, as we have seen,
effected at Portland by the Hentys, of Tasmania. The first
purchase of land was made by John Batman, who bargained
with the natives for an assignment of 600,000 acres, com-
prising the lands on which Melbourne and Geelong have
been built, and now probably worth over sixty millions
sterling, and for which he paid the natives certain miscel-
laneous articles, such as blankets, shirts, flour, knives, &c.,,
amounting to not more in value than £2OO a
truly splendid prize, which, however, slipped through Mr.
Batman’s fingers in consequence of the Home Government
declining to sanction it. The first house was built in Mel-
bourne in November, 1835. The first general store in the new


settlement was opened by Mr. Batman. The first public
house was kept by John Pascoe Fawkner. The first census
of the colony was taken in May, 1836, and showed a popu-
lation of 177 persons, 142 of whom were males and 35
females. The first regular Government was established on
the 29th September, 1836. The first resident magistrate
was Captain William Lonsdale, who was sent from Sydney
to occupy that position. The name of Melbourne was first
given to the embryo city by Governor Sir Richard Bourke,
of Sydney, in March, 1837. The first sale of Crown lands
was held on Ist June, 1837, when half-acre town lots
brought an average of £35. The General Post Office was
established in the same year. The first exports were made
in 1837, amounting to nearly £10,200, and consisting of
wool, tallow, and hides. The first newspaper was issued
in 1838, under the title of the Melbourne Advertiser. The
first Governor of Victoria was Charles Joseph Latrobe, Esq.,
who arrived from Sydney on the 30th September, 1839,
taking charge at that date of the Port Phillip District,
under the title of Superintendent, and becoming, on the
Ist July, 1851, Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria—Port
Phillip having been erected into an independent colony at
that date, under the name of Victoria. The first Supreme
Court met in April, 1841. The first Mayor of Mel-
bourne was elected in 1842. The first discovery of gold was
made in July, 1851. The first escort of gold came to
Melbourne in June, 1852. The first railway was com-
menced in 1853. The first Victorian Exhibition was opened
in October, 1854. The first telegram was transmitted in
March, 1855. The New Constitution was proclaimed in
Victoria in November, 1855. The Melbourne Public
Library was opened in 1856. The first Parliament was
opened in November, 1856. The first Premier was William
Clark Haines, Esq.
CHAPTER VIII.
HOW IT GREW.
The new country was well reported of. Sir Thomas
Mitchell, at the time Surveyor-General of New South
Wales, had gone down the Murray river, and had explored


COAST SCENERY.—PULPIT ROCK, CAPE SHANCK.




a considerable portion of tbe country stretching southwards
from it, and constituting the northern and western districts
of the colony. So charmed was he with what he saw, that
he gave to the new territory the somewhat pretentious name
of “ Australia Felix.” And, as the flattering tidings of its
capabilities travelled to surrounding regions and across the
wide ocean to England, many turned their attention towards
it. Stockmen, shepherds, and flock-owners came from New
South Wales and Tasmania, and immigrants from Great
Britain. High prices soon ruled; labour dear, provisions
dear, rents dear. Some idea of the state of things may be
formed from the fact that houses, or rather we ought to say
the merest huts, would bring a rental of £B, or <£lo a
month. The population, which in 1836 amounted to 224
persons, had in 1839 increased to nearly 4000. During the
same time sheep had increased nearly tenfold. The educa-
tional, social, and religious wants of the people were attended
to. The indispensable newspaper made its appearance, land
sales were held, schools to the number of four, with seventy-
eight scholars, were reported in 1839, while at the same time
sixplacesof worship had been established. In 1842 a Municipal
Corporation was created for Melbourne, and Henry Condell,
Esq., was chosen the first mayor. The rapidity with which
land cultivation was prosecuted may be seen in the fact,
that during the same year 13,000 acres were under crop.
In 1850 an event occurred which ushered in a new epoch in
the history of the colony. Hitherto, it had simply been a
part of New South Wales. A movement for separation had
been going on for some time, which had been ably advocated
and led by Mr. Edward Curr and Dr. Lang, and in November
of that year, success crowned it, by the erection of the
district of Port Phillip into an independent colony, bearing
the regal name of Victoria. At this date the population
had risen to upwards of 76,000 persons, while in the matter
of stock, horses had increased to the number of about 17,000,
cattle to the number of 350,000, and sheep to the number
of about 5J millions. Land had now been brought under
cultivation to the extent of 46,000 acres, while the exports
of the infant colony had attained the goodly value of
£755,326, and the revenue had risen to £229,388. And
then came the grand turning point. The year 1851 must
remain for ever memorable in Victorian history. This was


the commencement of “ the golden epoch.” The precious
metal had been found in various places during the two
previous years, but it was on the Ist September, 1851, that
the first licence to mine for gold was issued by the Govern-
ment. A new and strange excitement, well designated “ the
gold-fever,” set in, and in an incredibly short space of time
affected well-nigh the whole community. The influence of
this, as was to be expected, was felt not merely in the
colony, but unto the very ends of the earth. The land of
gold and sunshine became all at once a world’s wonder.
Even sober minds were dazzled with the dream of it. Men
of all nationalities flocked thither. It is scarcely to be
wondered at in these circumstances, that in 1854 the popu-
lation had risen to the goodly figure of 312,307 persons.
These were spread over extensive districts, forming town-
ships, and thus creating centres of population and industry.
The gold extracted from the various mines during the year
amounted in value to over nine millions and a half of
money. The large number of 83,410 individuals arrived in
the colony from other countries, conveyed by 2569 ships.
The imports for the same time amounted to over seventeen
and a half millions , and the exports to nearly twelve millions.
Land to the extent of 405,679 acres had been sold and
55,000 acres had been brought under cultivation. The
“ finds” of gold gradually diminishing, the people naturally
turned their attention to other sources of labour and wealth.
Farms were selected, and a steady process of settlement
on the lands set in. New industries sprung up. Commerce
opened up for itself suitable channels. Social comforts and
privileges rapidly increased. Benevolent institutions were-
founded. Schools were established, and churches were
built. During the year to which we have brought
down the history of the young colony, 152 different
kinds of factories were reported and 391 schools and 18T
places of public worship were established. In November,
1855, the New Constitution was proclaimed, and on
the 26th February following, the first Parliament under
it met. Another important step in the direction of progress
was taken in the introduction of railways. Then followed
the telegraph, the first line being constructed between
Melbourne and Williamstown. If we come down to 1862,
we find the population increased to considerably over half


a million. At this time, too, over 100 flour-mills were in
operation, and 650 manufactories of different kinds. The
quantity of land under crops amounted to 465,430 acres,
the horses numbered 86,067, the horned cattle 576,601,
the pigs 52,991, and the sheep 6,764,851, while schools had
increased to 989, and places of public worship to 1137.
As we come further down towards the present time we find
the law of consolidation steadily at work. The unnatural ex-
citement of the gold-fever gradually subsided, and society
sought its wonted levels, like the tossing billows when
the tempest has lulled. Things settled down into the
ordinary grooves of existence and progress. The tide of
immigration, instead of swelling, somewhat diminished,
and the development of the numerous internal resources
possessed by the colony awakened a wider interest and called
forth the energies of the people. “Advance Victoria”
became the watchword, and though numerous drawbacks
have had to be encountered, and even occasional apparent
retrogression, still through it all the colony has steadily risen,
and, notwithstanding even the recent severe crisis through
which it has been passing, it occupies this day a proud
position among the colonies of the world.
CHAPTER IX.
FACTS WHICH SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.
A few of the more prominent statistical facts will convey
to general readers some idea of the magnitude of the
interests which have been created in a colony, which
is as yet but 40 years old. It has a population of
902,944, and its revenue, according to the latest statistics,
amounted in value to over four and a half millions.
Its yield of gold amounted to over three millions of pounds
sterling or about one-fourth of what it produced in the
palmiest days of gold-digging. It possesses over nine millions
of sheep and over one million of horses. Its imports amounted
to over sixteen millions, and its exports to close on fifteen
millions. It has 1007 post offices, through which there
passed last year upwards of 22{- millions of letters, and over
10| millions of newspapers. It has 1052 miles of railway
in operation. It has 5404 miles of telegraph wire, along


which over one million of telegrams were dispatched during
the year. It possesses of manufactories and public works, ex-
clusive of flour mills, 2194. Its banks of issue have a paid-up
capital of nine millions. It has 184 Savings Banks, with
76,679 depositors, and one million and a half of balances.
It has 2815 churches and chapels, and 2256 schools, with
268,251 scholars. It has 72 waterworks for the storage and
supply of water for domestic, mining, and agricultural
purposes, containing a total storage capacity of close on
13,000,000,000 of gallons of water, and constructed at a
.cost of considerably over three and a half millions of money.
CHAPTER X.
THE CROWN LANDS.
The disposal of the public estate of Victoria, known
generally by the name of the “ Crown Lands,” has not been
conducted on a uniform system. Changes have taken place
from time to time. The mode at present in force is regu-
lated by an Act passed on December 29, 1869, and which
came into force on February 1, 1870. This Act was
amended by the Land Act of 1878, which came into
operation in the beginning of 1879. The Amending Act
expires with the current year.
Crown lands may be disposed of, or “ alienated,” as it is
technically described under the Act, within certain limita-
tions and under certain conditions, by auction, by licence, or
by lease.
The total area of Victoria is 56,446,720 acres.
Of this 23,000,000 acres consist of mallee scrub, mountain
ranges at present inaccessible or unavailable, lakes, lagoons,
&c.
The total accessible area is thus 33,446,720 acres.
Ihe lands alienated from the Crown, and otherwise
appropriated, up to December 31, 1879, amounted to
25,182,148 acx'es. This includes 7,071,717 acres alienated
up to December, 1864, with roads, &c., in connection
therewith to the extent of 353,591 acres; 3,526,023
acres under Land Act, 1865, with roads, &c., to the
extent of 176,301 acres; 11,196,834 acres under Land
Acts, 1869 and 1878, with roads, &c., to the extent of


559,842 acres; land embraced in cities, towns, &c.,
301,000 acres ; reserves in connection with pastoral occupa-
tion under 110th section, about 350,000 acres ; auriferous
lands, available only under section 49, about 1,008,240
acres; State forests, not included in unavailable mountain
ranges, 243,000 acres ; timber reserves do, 395,600 acres.
The estimated area of lands abandoned or forfeited to the
Crown amounts to 2,446,450 acres.
The approximate area available for selection on the Ist of
January, 1880, was 10,711,022 acres.
In 1879, under section 19 of the Act, 5726 applications
were approved, embracing 1,006,024 acres, giving to each
selection an average of 176 acres, with fees payable yearly on
the whole to the amount of £58,161 6 s., being a decrease on the
previous year to the extent of 1798 applications, 383,931
acres, 9 acres on the average to each selection, and £80,834
4s. of yearly fees.
In 1879, under section 49 of the Act, 887 applications
were approved, embracing 13,760 acres, giving an average
to each selection of 15 acres, with fees payable yearly on the
whole to the amount of £2387, being a decrease on the
previous year to the extent of 647 applications, 11,414 r
acres, 1 acre on the average to each, and £567 in the yearly
fees payable.
The total licences and leases revoked or declared expired
during the year numbered 2375. The lands resumed by the
Crown comprised 326,027 acres, and the Treasury profited
by revocations and forfeitures to the extent of £17,844 2s.
Sittings of Local Land Boards were held during the year
to the number of 424, at which applications for land and
other business, comprising in all 9942 subjects, were dealt
with.
Under section 20, Act 1869, applications to the number
of 4235 were dealt with, embracing 193,207 acres of pur-
chased land, 667,938 of leased, and 175,300 acres of land
leased and afterwards purchased.
Applications to convert leaseholds into freeholds under
section 20 of the Act 1869, to the number of 1294 were
approved, representing 192,436 acres, and improvements to
the value of £281,708.
The number of Crown grants under section 20, Act 1869,
of holdings varying in extent from 10 acres and under to


320 acres approved, amounted to 248, of which 136 were for
holdings under 50 acres, 25 for holdings over 300 and not
exceeding 320 acres, and the remaining 87 for holdings
varying from 50 to 300 acres.
The area of country lands sold at auction during the year
was about 51,817 acres, of which about 37,294 acres were
improved and subject to valuation, and 14,523 unimproved;
the area of town lands disposed of in the same way was
1607 a. Or. 5p.; and of suburban lands 3005 a. 3r. 22p.
The country lands realized £70,908 Bs. 9d., or an average
of £1 7s. 4d. per acre; the town lands, £73,484 18s. 10d.,
or an average of £45 14s. 6d. per acre ; and the suburban
lands £11,916 15s. 6d., or an average of £3 19s. 4d. per
acre.
CHAPTER XI
SHEEP FARMING AND WOOL PRODUCING.
Victoria has a name in the world for its wool producing
capabilities. For this it is indebted to the sheep farmer or
squatter. He was the earliest occupant of its broad plains,
the pioneer of settlement, the founder of its wealth, and for
years the most prominent man in its communities. With
his flocks he went out into the wilds, took up a large district
of country (called his “ run ”), lived a somewhat primitive
and rugged life, and was “ a shepherd king,” in his way.
Though of those who formed the first band of adventurous
settlers, comparatively few perhaps, accumulated wealth,
golden harvests were in store for their successors. The
natural law of increase among their flocks, favourable
seasons and good prices for wool helped to work out
this result for them. At the same time, generally
speaking, they were hard-working, pushing, self-reliant
and persevering men. The rapidity with which this
interest has grown may be understood from the simple
fact that while in 1837 the wool exported amounted to
175,081 lbs., valued at £11,639, last year the wool exports
amounted to £5,810,148.
The squatting runs have recently decreased somewhat in
number. This is attributable mainly to two causes. First,
selectors in going into the runs have naturally taken up the
best land to be found on them; and second, the assessment


•on what has been left has been felt in many instances to be
exorbitant, and the result has in some cases been, that the
leases have been fallen from and the runs abandoned. In
such cases the lands have been offered for grazing purposes
at an annual licensing fee. In 1878, the area of Crown
lands embraced by the pastoral interest amounted to
19,531,083 acres, divided into 768 runs. The average size
of these runs, exclusive of any purchased land connected
with them, was 25,431 acres. In 1879, the area had
decreased to 17,183,864 acres, and the number of runs to
701. In the matter of rental, the fee is ss. annually for
each head of horse or cattle, and Is. annually for each
sheep, the extent of this exaction being determined by the
quantity of stock which the land on each run is estimated to
be capable of depasturing. The rental payable for 1878
amounted to £122,142, or l£d. per acre, the amount actually
paid was £134,079, but this included arrears from
previous years. The rental paid for 1879 was £107,732.
The area held under pastoral licences was during
the year reduced by sales, selections, reservations, and
proclamations of commons, to the extent of 686,080
acres. Applications for the reduction of pastoral rent to
the number of 195 were considered during the year,
and reductions allowed to the amount of £9370 14s. Bd.
While the runs of the squatters have been largely infringed
upon by selectors, and in numerous instances absorbed or
ruined, a good deal is being done to increase the value of
the portion of them which they have secured by purchase
and which they now hold in the shape of freehold
grazing estates. Improvements in the breed of sheep,
in modes of depasturing, in guarding against disease,
in the production of better wool, in the storage of
water, in fencing, and in other matters, cannot fail to
increase the value of the land still occupied for sheep-farming;
while, in the extension of the railway system, and the open-
ing of traffic by steamers on the Murray, greater facilities
are afforded for cheap and rapid conveyance of the clip from
the stations to Melbourne, with the view to its being disposed
of or shipped to England.
In view of the expiry of the present squatting leases in
1880, proposals have been put before the public to the effect
that the runs should be divided, so that, instead of the


present number of large runs, there should be thrown open
for lease a greatly increased number of smaller runs, whereby
men of comparatively moderate means might be in a position
to take them up and occupy them. What may come of this
proposal remains to be seen. It has been said in its favour,
why should not men of small capital be afforded the chance
of entering on such a profitable pursuit ? On the other
hand, in the opinion of many well qualified to judge, small
runs such as those contemplated would not pay, and therefore
would not be worth the having.
A tax, known as the Land Tax, came into operation in
August, 1877, which affected very considerably the landed
interest. All estates exceeding in dimension 640 acres,
whether comprising one or more blocks of land not more
than five miles apart, and upon which a higher value is set
than .£2500, are levied upon at the rate of £1 ss. per cent,
upon their capital value, subject to the previous deduction
therefrom of £2500. The capital value of these estates is
determined by dividing them into four classes, and estimat-
ing their respective values according to the number of sheep
which they are able to carry thus :
Ist Class, carrying per acre 2or more sheep ... £4.
2nd Class, carrying to 2 acres 3 sheep ... ... £3.
3rd Class, carrying per acre 1 sheep ... ... £2.
4th Class, carrying less per acre than 1 sheep ... £l.
The following statistics exhibit the wonderful develop-
ment of the wool interest in the colony since its foundation; —
Value of wool exported in 1837 . . £11,639.
Do. 1847 ... 565,805.
Do. 1857 ... 1,335,642.
Do. 1867 ... 3,824,956.
Do. 1878 ... 5,810,148.*
As affording a glimpse of what enterprise is accomplishing
in connection with the improvement of breeds of sheep, it may
be mentioned that at the first sale of the Hon. Sir Samuel
Wilson’s stud sheep in October of last year, the large sum
of £IO,OOO was realized.
In the early days of the colony the life of the squatter was
necessarily a rough one. His condition was almost that of
exile. His location amid the vast plains was beyond the
bounds of civilized existence. His home was a rude

hut. Comforts were comparatively few. Savages hovered
about his haunts. His work was arduous. Drought
and fire and flood had to be battled with. Roads
there were none. The privileges of enlightened inter-
course, education, and Christianity were not available.
A man required to be hardy, enterprising, self-reliant, and
courageous if he would hold on successfully in such circum-
stances as these. And yet the life had its charms. There
was a wondrous freedom about it, a feeling of independence,
and a consciousness of power, while its monotony was occa-
sionally broken by wild and stirring adventure. There was,
moreover, the satisfaction of owning increasing flocks, and
the prospect of future competence and wealth. The colony
owes much to the brave and adventurous pioneers who first
stepped out into the wild, peopling it with peaceful flocks,
and laying the foundations of future civilization.
Greatly changed from all this, and that for the better, is
the condition of the squatter now. His home is the abode
of civilization and refinement; not only all the comforts,
but the luxuries and elegancies of life surround him. The
author of “ Under the Southern Cross ” thus describes a
squatter’s home as he found it, on a recent visit to our
colony :—“I was not a little surprised, when we arrived at
the end of our journey, to find myself before a large, well-
built, country house, surrounded by a tastefully laid out
garden, a fine sheet of water in an adjoining field, with
rowing boat thereon; a well-stocked orchard of three or four
acres in extent on one side ; a carriage drive, lined with
avenues of trees, on the other ; with many pigeons, cocks
and hens, turkeys, ducks and geese in the poultry yard;
and lastly, with swallows—apparently English swallows
—building their mud nests under the shelter of the
roof of the house. This was Langford. It might have
been a country-house in England so far as all the immediate
surroundings were concerned.” Further, “We also had
one of the best and largest billiard rooms I have seen
in a private house ; there was a small, but well-selected
library in another part of the house, while in the drawing-
room were to be found a good piano and a fair supply of
popular music. Indeed, the interior arrangements of the
house were in excellent taste, and every provision had been
made for the comfort of its occupants. When I mention
c


that water was laid on about the house, and that you could
get as luxurious a bath as you would find in a swell hotel
in London or Paris, it will give some idea how com-
pletely the arts of civilization have penetrated into the
Australian bush.”
Those who entered into squatting in the earlier days of
the colony had splendid chances. Many of them did so with
but very little capital. As a general rule the banks have
ever been ready to assist such with loans. Approved station
securities, and the next season’s wool clip have commanded
ready advances from wool-brokers and mercantile firms, and
in this way numerous stations have been worked successfully
when capital was but on a very limited scale. With almost
unlimited country from which to select in taking up their
runs, and a few hundred sheep to start with, the natural
increase of their flocks was so great, and the expenses of
working the station so relatively small, that, supposing they
were favoured with a few good seasons, and that wool
maintained a fair price, wealth would flow in upon them
like a steady tide and in no stinted measure. Many a man
who commenced sheep-farming in this way is now the
extensive landholder and the owner of princely wealth.
It may be asked, “ What advantages offer to those who
would try their fortunes in connexion with this pursuit
now V’ These cannot be expected to be what they once
were. Still, however, opportunities of entering on this
department of enterprise may be found. Stations are
frequently in the market, and, when capital can be com-
manded, may be purchased on reasonable terms. It may
be supposed by some that if a subdivision of the runs should
take place at the termination of the present leases, it will
be a comparatively easy matter for such as are in possession
of a little money, and who have a knowledge of sheep and
are not afraid of work, to make a start, but when the
comparatively worthless character of the land still re-
maining in the runs is taken into consideration, it is to
be feared that any such enterprise will be but a poor
one. If those who are anxious to try sheep-farming
on a large scale will make up their minds to go into the
vast interior, they will find scope to their heart’s content.
Within the bounds of those sister colonies which hold the
immense tracts of country lying to the north and north-
18

west of Victoria, there is room and verge enough for all
moderate ambition. Young men not afraid of “ roughing
it ” for a few years, endowed with resolution, energy, and
endurance, and who have a taste for the freedom and
independence of a squatter’s life, provided that they have
adequate capital .or sufficient backing to carry them through
initial difficulties or frequently recurring periods of drought,
may find in these “ fresh fields and pastures new ” a way to
honourable competence, when perchance they might search
for it in vain amid the fierce competition which characterises
every department of business in the great city.
CHAPTER XII.
LAND SELECTION AND AGRICULTURE.
The desire to have “ a homestead ” of one’s own is strong
in the hearts of many men. And this is quite natural. It
provides a safe mooring for a man, gives to him a feeling of
security, invests him with a substantial stake in the
colony, and enables him to rear his family in comfort. Be-
sides, it is as good for the community as for the individual,
that the people occupy the lands. By such occupation
a class is created which more than any other gives stability
and permanency to a colony. Every one acquainted with
recent European occurrences admits the marvellous recuper-
ative power displayed by France after its disastrous and
exhaustive defeat by Prussia. The ease with which it paid
the enormous indemnity demanded, and the rapidity with
which it regained a condition of financial prosperity, is one
of the most remarkable occurrences of the generation. And
to what is it attributed 1 Writers generally agree that it is
mainly due to its numerous yeoman class—its small free-
holders, comprising seven millions of independent farmers
who own their own little homesteads. A writer recently
remarked in one of the journals of the day, that in France,
and also in the United States, “ the cultivating proprietors
are the foundation and the sheet anchor of society. Should
every other class be restless and anarchical, their stability
may be depended upon and will be sufficient.” What doth
hinder that this country should have such a class as its back


bone and stay 1 The home country has its thousands of
small tenant farmers who cannot pay their rents, and its
crowds of men willing to work for whom work cannot be
found ; while here, millions of acres of Crown lands await
selection, and invite occupancy.
How can a man obtain a farm in Victoria 1 What is the
condition of the agricultural interest, and what its prospects ?
These and like questions are no doubt of interest to some
into whose hands this little work may fall. The following
facts and considerations will, we hope, furnish a satisfactory
answer.
First : The approximate area available for selection, with
right of purchase, is, according to the Government statistics
just issued, 10,711,022 acres. These figures do not include
lands that are unsuitable for cultivation.
Second : A man may, under the present Land Act, select
an area not exceeding 320 acres. This he will hold under
licence for six years. During that period he must observe
the following conditions. Ist: He must reside upon it at
least five years, and fence it in. 2nd : He must cultivate
one acre out of every ten and effect general improvements to
the value of 20s. per acre. 3rd :He must pay rent at the
rate of Is. per acre per annum, which rent will be credited
to him as part payment of the principal. If at the end of
the six years he has complied with these conditions, and
obtains a certificate to this effect from the Board of Land and
Works, he can have a choice of either of two courses. The
one is, purchasing his selection by paying the balance of the
purchase money. He has already paid 6s. per acre, i.e., Is. of
rental per acre each year during the six years of his occupancy
which have run, and by paying the remaining 14s. per acre
he can complete the purchase. The other course is the con-
version of his licence into a lease extending over fourteen
years, at an annual rental of Is. per acre. This will be
credited to him as part payment of the fee-simple, and on
the expiry of his lease, the land becomes his freehold.
These constitute the main features of the Act under which
selection takes place.
Third : There is a non-residence clause under which land
may be taken up. That is, those who select are not bound
to reside on their selections. In such cases the rent is
double, viz., 2s. per acre, and the price to be paid for the


land is double also, viz., £2 per acre. It is provided also
that improvements must be made during the six years’
licence to the value of £2 per acre, and that one half of
these improvements must be made before the expiration
of the third year. The extent to which such licences
can be issued during any one year is limited to 200,000
acres.
Fourth : Land may be purchased from the Crown. The
Act provides for its sale by auction at the upset price of £1
per acre, or such higher sum as the Governor may direct.
The amount to be disposed of thus any given year may not
exceed 200,000 acres.
Statistics of agriculture are carefully collected and com-
piled by the Government. Municipal bodies are charged
with the work, and are required to furnish to the Govern-
ment Statist, from year to year, under direction of the
Governor-in-Council, correct information on the subject to
the best of their knowledge and belief.
The statistics for the year ending March 31st, 1880,
were published in May. The information which they fur-
nish is the most recent available. Absolute accuracy is not
claimed for them in consequence of certain small mishaps
which occurred in one or two districts in connexion with
the collection of them. At the same time Mr. H. H.
Hayter, the Government Statist, gives it as his opinion
that when the final returns come in from the districts
referred to, the figures will be but slightly affected. They
may therefore be taken as affording an approximately
correct view of the results of farming operations in the
colony.
From these statistics we glean the following :—Number
of holdings, not including stations to which no purchased
land is attached, 49,025. Extent of land in occupation:
freehold, 8,919,023 acres; rented, 1,627,611 acres. Selected
land (purchase not completed), 6,068,283 acres. Land
under tillage, 1,687,400 acres.
The following figures will shew the extent of tillage, the
varieties of crop, the gross produce, and the average yield
per acre.
Grain Crops.—Wheat: Acres under crop, 707,738 ; total
yield, 9,407,503 bushels; average per acre, 13.3 bushels.
Oats: Acres, 167,721 ; yield, 4,024,962 bushels; average,


24.0 bushels. Barley: Acres, 43,208 ; yield, 1,065,759-
Maize : Acres, 2451 ; yield, 61,922 bushels. Rye : Acres,.
1243; yield, 18,479 bushels. Pease and Beans: Acres,
21,454; yield, 574,815 bushels.
Root Crops.*—Potatoes : Acres, 41,600 ; yield, 167,986 :
tons; average 4.0 tons. Turnips: Acres, 193; yield, 20,73 :
tons. Mangel Wurzel: Acres, 1026; yield, 14,894 tons.
Beet, Carrots, Parsnips, &c. : Acres, 375; yield, 2510 tons.
Onions: Acres, 1040 ; yield, 7347 tons.
Hay.—Acres, 201,169 ; yield, 291,781 tons. Green
Forages : Acres, 4310 Permanent Artificial Grasses :
Acres, 303,165. Grass Seeds: Acres, 2291 ; yield, 33,439
bushels.
Minor Crops.—Chicory : Acres, 392 ; yield, 1764 tons.
Hops: Acres, 260 ; yield, 2528 cwt. Tobaccof : Acres,
531; yield, 1297 cwt. Vines: Acres, 4285; yield,
106,185 cwt.
Other Crops.—Acres, 398. Gardens.—Acres, 12,841.
Orchards. —Acres, 7464. Land in Fallow.—Acres, 162,245.
These figures tell of progress. The increase in the number of
holdings for the year is 1975. Of purchased land, in freehold
there is a decrease of 4912 acres, and in rented an increase of
112,715 acres. Of selected land (purchase not complete)
there is an increase of 605,711 acres. The total area in
occupation shows an increase of 713,514 acres. Of land
under tillage there is an increase of 78,122 acres.
The areas under tillage of all the grain crops, with the one
exception of rye, were in excess of those of the previous
year. The area under oats shows an increase to the extent
of 33,293 acres; barley, 20,337 acres ; wheat, 16,116 acres ;
pease and beans, 6301 acres; maize, 512 acres; potatoes,
5073 acres ; hay, 28,370 acres.
As regards the quantity of produce raised, the statistics
are most satisfactory. A few minor crops excepted, the
yields as compared not only with those of last year, but
with those of any previous year, exhibit a large increase.
The yield of wheat is by far the largest yet recorded in the
statistics of the colony. Oats yielded nearly double the
quantity of the previous year. Barley yielded more than
double. Potatoes and hay show a large increase, as also the
of those in market and kitchen gardens.
fThe tobacco crop is reported to have failed in most districts.


minor root crops. Products of a less ordinary description
in like manner show good results. Chicory has more than
trebled, and hops more than doubled. The quantity of wine
manufactured was increased by 163,810 gallons, notwith-
standing that the area under vines had diminished to the
extent of 149 acres. There was a small decrease in rye
and grass seed, and a somewhat serious one in tobacco,
in consequence of the failure of the crop in most
districts.
The average yield per acre of the principal crops may
also be regarded as satisfactory. Wheat is perhaps some-
what disappointing. While greatly exceeding that of the
harvest of 1878-9, which largely failed, it is about equal to
the average given of the yields of the past ten years. The
Government Statist explains that the averages have been
effected by the low yields in certain districts of the country.
Any one can understand how local differences or failure may
disturb general calculations. Thus, for instance, in Gunbower
the average was as low as 7.67 bushels, while in Tambo (a
smaller area) it was 30.39 bushels. Taking one district with
another, the average shown, viz., 13.3, may be regarded as
very fair. Looking at the other principal crops there is not
only a great increase in the average yield over that of the
previous year, but it is higher than any that has been shewn
for the last ten years. The average of oats is bushels
per acre higher than that of last year, and over two
bushels more than the average of 1876, the highest recorded
during the previous nine years. Potatoes and hay also
show a good increase in the average yields per acre over the
previous year.
Referring again to the figures representing the gross
produce of wheat, viz., 9,407,503 bushels, it is worthy of
notice that we have reached the stage at which a market
must be sought for surplus stocks outside the colony. After
retaining a sufficient quantity as seed for sowing afresh,
and providing amply for our own wants, it is calculated
that at least 3,000,000 of bushels may be available for
export, representing, say, the sum of half a million
sterling.
The development of the agricultural interest in the colony
has been of a very marked character. This will appear
from a comparison of the statistics for the year ending 31st

table exhibits these statistics at the dates referred to :
It will be noticed that while the population has not
doubled itself during the twenty years referred to, the
number of holdings has increased by nearly four to one, the
area under cultivation by more than four and a half acres to
one, and the land occupied as gardens and orchards by con-
siderably more than three acres to one. The gross produce
of wheat has increased over four-fold, that of potatoes
over three-fold, that of oats nearly two-fold, that of hay
more than two-fold, while the yield of the vintage has been
multiplied by over forty times. This is most gratifying.
Such magnificent results speak well for the natural capabili-
ties of our soil, and the energy, skill, and industry of the
agriculturists who have settled down upon it ; and are
fitted to awaken in us, at once, a spirit of devout thankful-
ness to Him who has endowed our favoured land with such
amplitude of beneficent resources, and a sentiment of hope-
fulness as to its future.
From statistics published in June we learn that the fol-
lowing selections were made for the period from the Ist
January to 31st May, 1880 :
Under Section 19 of the Land Act, 1869, as amended by
the Land Act, 1878, applications were granted to the
number of 1840, embracing an area of 329,226 acres.
Under Section 11, Land Act, 1878 (non-residence), appli-
cations were granted to the number of 36, embracing an
area of 6001 acres. Under Section 8, Land Act, 1878
(surrenders), applications were approved to the number of
173, embracing an area of 40,198 acres. Under Section 3,
Land Act, 1880, applications were approved to the number
of 403, embracing an area of 96,962 acres. Under Section

A digest of the reports of land officers on the working of
the Land Act, 1869, in their respective districts, has been
issued as an appendix to the report on proceedings taken
under the provisions of the Act for the past year, and
which has been recently issued by the Minister of Lands
and Agriculture. It deals with the workings of Sections 19
and 49 of the Act, the use made of land granted or leased
under Section 20, and offers general remarks. We glean from
it the following information: —Selections are mostly hond-fde
in character. Both sections of the Act are working satis-
factorily. Conditions of licence, as a rule, have been
complied with. In various districts selection progresses
steadily. Under Section 49 a great number of selections
have been made near Berwick, and at Macedon, by gentle-
men in business in Melbourne, with a view to the erection
of summer residences. As to the land granted or leased
under Section 20, comparatively few transfers or sales have
been effected; the general use to which it is put is that of
grazing, with a little cultivation here and there, where it is
fit for it, and in various districts settlement has all the
appearance of permanency. Among those who have turned
their attention to sheep, the feeling seems to be growing
that larger areas ought to be made available, as 320 acres
of perhaps inferior land is altogether too circumscribed, and
it would prove no more costly to look after 640 acres, with
its complement of sheep.
Various important questions in connection with the
farming interest require attention. In this little work we
can only refer to one or two in passing. There are diffi-
culties to be contended with in various districts, in order
to the removal or mitigation of which Government aid is
requested. In some districts railway transit is urgently
wanted. The selector who is distant 30 or 40 miles from
a railway station, and who has to traverse roads which are
almost impassable at certain seasons of the year, struggles
on in the endeavour to found his permanent home amid
disadvantages of a most disheartening character. In some
localities, especially in the Wimmera and some other
districts, the rabbits are so numerous and desti’uctive that
they threaten to devour every green thing. Water storage,

in the shape of artidcial dams and reservoirs, especially in
districts where the climate is arid and drought is almost
chronic, is a pressing want. In these and other matters the
farmers are entitled to prompt consideration at the hands
of the Government. They are striving manfully in helping
themselves ; but they are entitled to help in circumstances
which lie beyond their control. They are the hope of the
colony. In the future they will prove its “ backbone and
stay.” They are capitalists in the best sense of the term,
for their capital is in their home and its surroundings. It
is to be borne in mind that they constitute in round
numbers a body of landholders to the extent of 50,000,
representing, with their families, some 200,000 individuals
or more, all of whom have a veritable stake in the colony,
and who may, therefore, be supposed to be interested
in the stability of its institutions, and in everything
that contributes to its true progress. There must be
among these a large body of men, intelligent, self-denying,
stout-hearted, industrious, and persevering ; and as they,
with their own hands, win from the arid plain or the forest
jungle what at first is but the rough home, but will in
process of time shape itself into the trim and orderly farm,
all true home-feelings will grow and strengthen in them,
and there will be developed in the midst of us a rural life
akin to that which has contributed so largely to the happi-
ness and prosperity of England, and which at the same
time will help materially to supply to the body politic a
consolidating and steadying power, greatly needed in a
young country, and will thus constitute one of the most
important factors in the permanency of its organisations,
and the progress of its communities. It is to be hoped,
therefore, that whatever timely help will contribute to this
desirable end, will not he withheld.
The question may be asked, What are the prospects of
selectors at the present time 1 ? In individual cases, just
as in every other department of industry, they must vary
considerably, and only a general answer can therefore be
given. Judging from the digests of the reports of the land
officers on the working of the Act to which we have already
referred, these prospects may be pronounced favourable.
Difficulties are being steadily surmounted ; natural defi-
ciences such as want of water are being supplied by wells,
26

tanks, dams, and the like; facilities for transfer of stock and
produce are increasing ; last year’s harvest was abundant;
thus far, the next promises well, and a spirit of hopefulness
prevails. A special reporter for the Argus, evidently
thoroughly competent, has been making a tour of inspection
through important agricultural districts, and furnishing a
large amount of interesting information on the subject. In
his report on the Benalla district he says, “ two-thirds of
the selectors are carrying on under circumstances which may
be regarded as satisfactory.” A great want on the part of
not a few selectors is inadequate capital. They are
“ unprepared to cope with a bad season or the loss of animals
through disease or cold weather.” It is to be feared that
many through this want, and through other causes, such as
almost impassable roads, mistakes in the selection of soil,
bad seasons, and the like, must either succumb, or maintain
the struggle with fearful odds against them, poverty and
wretchedness, meanwhile, at least, falling heavily to their
lot. The reporter says further, in reference to this district,
“ Wherever a man has begun with adequate capital, he was
found doing well; his land was carefully tilled, the fences
good, the stock numerous and healthy.” In the Wimmera
district, the reporter found many of the selectors struggling
manfully amid disheartening circumstances. He remarks
that “ among them there must be a fine body of stout-
hearted colonists.” One cannot but admire the spirit and
energy displayed in such an instance as the following :
“ It is remarkable what a great deal one man can do if he is
industrious and steady. Driving along the road leading
through the parish of Lowan to the Clear lake, we noticed
a selection containing 50 acres of land which had been under
crop last season, and thirty more being got ready for the
next. The occupant had only been on the ground since
October, 1878, or a period of eighteen months. Nearly the
whole of his selection was enclosed with log-fencing. He
had built a mud house and stables, and between the dwell-
ing place and the road there was a garden containing a
dozen or more varieties of chrysanthemums. All the im-
provements were the work of his own hands. His first crop
had hardly paid expenses, but he was looking forward to a
good return next December. He had got as much work
done as many other selectors would have taken three or four


years to perform. His capital at starting was small, and in
order to keep the house going he had been obliged to take
occasional employment from longer established neighbours,
regarding £2 a week as very fair wages.” In various parts
of the district he found that the ■ rabbits existed in over-
whelming numbers, constituting a veritable pest and plague,
and carrying devastation far and wide. Unless the district
is to be abandoned to them, it is indispensable that adequate
measures be devised for their extermination. It appears
that the opinion prevails in the district referred to, that 320
acres constitute too small a holding to support a family in
comfort. The selectors seem to be turning this view to
practical account. He says, “ Those who have overcome
the difficulties of the licensing period, and have obtained a
lease clear of incumbrance —usually men of moderate means
at starting—are trying to buy out their neighbours; and
neighbours whose sons and daughters have attained the age
of eighteen are selling their original holdings of 320 acres
to take up larger areas in new localities. Men who have
made a little money under the system of family selection
are increasing their property by purchase. Others, finding
that small selections are always saleable, gladly give up
possession, using the £SOO or £6OO their land sells for as
capital to enter upon fresh and larger ventures.” The land
officer for the district reports that settlement proceeds satis-
factorily, that the selectors appear contented, and are in
many instances practical farmers. A writer who has
recently been making a tour through the Mirboo country in
Gipps Land, referring to Calignee, to the south of Traralgon,
says, “There are signs of extreme fertility on every hand.
There are plenty of settlers around, in fact the land is
almost all taken up. These hardy and enterprising individ-
uals all look satisfied with their prospects. They wear the
smile of the lucky, and look the personification of confident
prosperity. r I here seems to be no difficulty in discovering
the best method of dealing with the land, nor do men seem
any longer to be terrified by reason of the greatness of the
timber, or the denseness of the undergrowth. They enter
into the work of clearing with zeal and energy, and find,
after all, that by a little sagacious management, the task is
neither so formidable nor expensive as has been hitherto
supposed and reported.”
28
Our Colony in 1880.


The Argus in a leading article thus disposes of the
question—“ how those who have already selected in Victoria
have prospered.” “ Having recently sent a special reporter
amongst this class, we are in a position to answer the
question. Men who have taken up farms with little or no
money have had to live in a very wretched way, and even
now their future is not assured. But all those who have
gone to work with adequate capital appear to be prospering
in a commercial sense, while surrounded by all the comforts
and many of the luxuries of life. We think that the
English tenant farmer in search of a new field for his
energies and treasure might do a great deal worse than try
his chances amongst the selectors of Victoria.”
In the cultivation of wheat a stage has been reached by
the farmers of the colony, at which, after the utmost con-
suming capacity of the people has been supplied, a consider-
able surplus remains to be disposed of. Naturally, the
area under wheat may be expected to -widen. The question
arises, how is the surplus to be disposed of ? Where can a
suitable market be found for it? Will it pay? These
questions are full alike of interest and importance. But we
do not deem it wise to speculate about them. Expectations
in such matters are often confounded. Novel conditions
arise in the circumstances of communities and nations, and
that, too, with startling rapidity, it may be, which stultify
the calculations of even the shrewdest economist. Who
would have supposed a few years ago that our surplus stock
of sheep and cattle was about to find a market in England ?
With other nations requiring to be fed, with the ocean as
a highway to every shore, with ever-multiplying speed in
locomotion, and with the enterprise and energy of a young
colony there cannot be much extravagance in the expec-
tation that “ ways and means” will in due time appear for
the profitable disposal of whatever cereals Victoria may be
able to produce. No great fear need, we think, be enter-
tained on this question.
As this little book may perchance find its way into the
homes of some of our farmers, or into the hands of some
who may contemplate settling down on the virgin soil, we
are inclined to give a place here to the following programme
reported as having been adopted as “ a creed” at a conven-
tion of agriculturists in Canada. Though the wisdom of
29
Our Colony in 1880.


small farms in this colony will he questioned, yet the
shrewdness and comprehensiveness of the general maxims
which it embodies will be acknowledged by all. It may be
useful to some, but especially would it be well to instil its
teachings into the minds of the young people in our rural
homes : —“ We believe in small farms and thorough culti-
vation ; we believe that the soil lives to eat, as well as the
owner, and ought, therefore, to be well manured ; we
believe in going to the bottom of things, and, therefore,
deep ploughing, and enough of it, all the better if it be a
subsoil plough; we believe in large crops which leave the
land better than they found it, making both the farm
and the farmer rich at once ; we believe that every farm
should own a good farmer; we believe that the fertiliser of
any soil is a spirit of industry, enterprise, and intelligence;
without these, lime, gypsum, and guano would be of little
use; we believe in good fences, good farmhouses, good
orchards, and good children enough to gather the fruit ; we
believe in a clean kitchen, a neat wife in it, a clean cup-
board, a clean dairy, and a clear conscience ; we believe
that to ask a man’s advice is not stooping, but of much
benefit; we believe that to keep a place for everything, and
everything in its place, saves many a step, and is pretty
sure to lead to good tools and to keeping them in order ; we
believe that kindness to stock, like good shelter, is saving of
fodder ; we believe that it is a good thing to keep an eye
on experiments, and note all, good and bad ; we believe
that it is a good rule to sell grain when it is ready ; we
believe in producing the best butter and cheese, and
marketing it when it is ready.”
In closing this chapter, we would say a few words as to
the prospects of such as may contemplate emigration from
the home country with the view of settling on the lands in
the colony. We would not have them to imagine that they
will at once step into ease and affluence. Considerable
hardship may for a time fall to their lot. Adverse contin-
gencies may have to be struggled with. Much laborious
work will be necessary. The land must be judiciously
selected, fenced, and cleared, and the homestead must
be built. Besides, bad seasons occur here as else-
where. On the other hand, there is a climate which
is acknowledged to be one of the finest in the world,


and an abundance of fertile soil ready for occupancy.
Natural difficulties, moreover, are being lessened or over-
come. In tbe opinion of many a proper system of irri-
gation would secure for tbe soil a productiveness scarcely to
be outrivalled. This important question has of late been
exciting much attention. A scheme for internal canaliza-
tion and irrigation on a national scale has been for some
time before the public, but whether or not it is practicable
remains to be seen. We think we may safely say then,
that men in the home country—and especially young men
—who have been accustomed to agriculture, and who have
a little capital, without knowing very well what to do with
it, might do worse than consider the facilities afforded for
settlement on the lands in Victoria. If not afraid of hard
work, self-reliant, enduring, actuated by an honorable ambi-
tion to reclaim a location from the forest or the wild, and to
build up a home which he can call his own, and where he
can rear a family in honest independence, willing to lay
aside old prejudices and accommodate himself to a new order
of things ; then, Victoria has to offer to such a man the
privilege of selecting land to the extent of 320 acres on the
conditions already detailed by us, with a salubrious and
enjoyable climate, the protection of law and order, free
education for his children, the blessings of Christianity, all
the advantages of an extending civilisation, and the fair-
prospect of winning such an independence as will enable
him to “ crown a youth of labour with an age of ease.”
CHAPTER XIII
VINE CULTURE AND WINE MAKING.
At a comparatively early date in the history of the colony
we find that here and there attention was being directed to
the cultivation of the vine. This was to be expected.
Climate and soil would seem favourable to the growth of
the grape. As far back as thirty-five years ago, vineyards
were planted in the neighbourhood of Geelong. That but
small progress attended the enterprise was not to be
wondered at. Knowledge of vine-culture, of adaptation of
different sorts to different soils, of the processes of wine


making and other matters was but limited on the part of
some who tried their hand at grape-production.
The suitability of our climate and soil to the growth of
the vine is now sufficiently established. Excellent grapes
are grown, and wine of good quality is made. Though
perhaps, in the circumstances not to be wondered at, yet it
is matter of regret, that wines of poor quality have been
sent into the home market, inasmuch as a prejudice was
thereby created which has hindered in no small degree the
development of the wine trade. This prejudice is now,
however, in a fair way of being overcome. Eminent
authorities have pronounced favourably of numerous
samples of colonial wines, defects in manufacture are being
steadily remedied, and there is a reasonable prospect of
some of our wines entering into successful competition with
wines of established reputation from the vineyards of
Europe.
A considerable amount of capital is now invested in this
industry. In the districts of the Murray, the Goulburn,
the Upper Yarra ; at Castlemaine, Sandhurst, Sunbury, and
elsewhere, vineyards of some magnitude have been planted.
During the year ending the 31st March, 1880, there were
in the County of Bogong, 1222 acres under vines, from
which were gathered 33,071 cwt. of grapes, of which
30,313 cwt. manufactured, 199,224 gallons of wine and 470
gallons of brandy. The figures for the County of Bendigo
were 534 acres, 15,458 cwt. grapes, 9878 cwt. manufac-
tured, 60,777 gallons of wine ; County of Bourke, 422 acres,
6975 cwt. grapes, 1351 cwt. manufactured, 35,843 gallons
of wine; County of Grant, 444 acres, 6348 cwt. grapes,
5548 cwt. manufactured, 36,090 gallons of wine ; County of
Evelyn, 439 acres, 14,696 cwt. grapes, 14,325 cwt.
manufactured, 89,632 gallons of wine and 1500 gallons of
brandy; County of Talbot, 290 acres, 7300 cwt. grapes,
6128 cwt. manufactured, 38,177 gallons of wine and 27
gallons of brandy. The returns from the other counties
were smaller. The total for the colony was, under vines
4285 acres, 106,185 cwt. grapes gathered, 89,890 cwt.
manufactured, 574,143 gallons of wine and 3284 gallons
of brandy.
The area under vines was less than that of the preceding
year by 149 acres. This is accounted for mainly through


THE UNION BANK OF AUSTRALIA LIMITED,

the destruction of vines that have been attacked by
phylloxera , oidium, or other diseases. Vigorous measures
were recently adopted by the Government for the purpose
of stamping out the great vine plague. Though no satis-
factory remedy has yet been discovered for the dreaded
phylloxera , which has wrought such desolation among the
vineyards of France and elsewhere, yet much knowledge
has been acquired as to the vines best suited for resisting
the attacks of the fatal pest, and it is to be hoped that
great care will henceforth be exercised in making a proper
selection for planting.
While there was a decrease in the area under vines to
the extent already noted, the quantity of wine and brandy
manufactured exceeded that of the previous year by 165,533
gallons.
Areas adapted for vine-culture, are to be found pretty
widely distributed throughout the colony. They exhibit
considerable variety in climate, soil, and exposure. The
opinion prevails, that areas lying to the north of the
Dividing Range are best adapted to the formation of vine-
yards, inasmuch as the mountains that form it act as a
barrier to the cold and heavy gales which frequently blow
from the sea in the months of winter and spring, and help
materially to modify their chilling influences. At the same
time it is to be admitted, that excellent wines have been
produced to the south of the Range, as for instance some of
the wines of Sunbury, Yering, and Geelong. In the
reports on Colonial wines, published under authority of the
Government, Dr. Bleasdale gives it as his opinion, that the
wines produced south of the Dividing Range bear some
resemblance to the French and German wines, while those
produced to the north of it resemble more the wines of
Spain.
The present will probably be regarded by many as a
favourable time for the extension of vine-culture in the
colony. And that on the following grounds:—lst: The
wines of the colony have of late been securing a name for
themselves in the markets of the world. Honorable men-
tion has been made of them in connexion with National
Exhibitions, alongside of the established wines of Europe.
2nd : The failure and destruction of vineyards covering

D
33

Europe, through the ravages of phylloxera , must of neces-
sity greatly diminish the wine supply from these districts,
and furnish opportunities for the introduction of wines from
other quarters. 3rd : The extensive failure of ordinary
farm crops in 1878, has induced the conviction in the minds
of many, that it might be wise in the farmer to grow
others, on which to some extent he might fall back in such
seasons, so that he might be able the more successfully to
weather the visitation of adversity. It is thought that
among these the culture of the vine should have a prominent
place. The requisite knowledge for doing this can no
longer be regarded as difficult of acquisition. 4th; There are
many in the colony who have been engaged in vine-culture
for years, the fruits of whose experience can be obtained,
and besides, a number of skilled workmen have been brought
from the vineyards of Europe, and are now scattered
throughout the colony.
Hitherto, the consumption of colonial wines by the
colonists themselves has been on a comparatively limited
scale. At the same time, it is to be noticed that it is
reported to be steadily increasing. What would be the
effect of their coming into general use, we do not profess
to determine. Some authorities maintain that wine-pro-
ducing and wine-drinking countries are invariably dis-
tinguished for the sobriety and cheerfulness of their
populations. If this be true, it is greatly to be desired
that the beer and brandy at present so extensively con-
sumed, and the consumption of which is producing an
appalling amount of moral ruin in every community, should
be supplanted by light, pleasant, and refreshing home-made
wines. We are not, however, in a position to venture a
positive opinion on the subject. But this is sufficiently
apparent, that Victoria is fitted by natural capabilities for
becoming an extensive wine-producing country.
CHAPTER XIII.
OTHER AND MINOR CROPS.
In addition to the ordinary crops grown by the farmer,
there are others of lesser note which have been tried with a
fair amount of success, A little more attention to them,


and enlarged experience in their cultivation, will probably
make them important and profitable adjuncts to the more
general operations of the farm. We can only notice a few
of the more valuable and special among them :
The Mulberry.— The Morus alba, or white mulberry, on
whose leaves the silkworm feeds, grows and thrives in the
climate of Victoria. The silkworm itself has been success-
fully reared. This industry is only in its infancy, but so
far as it has been tried, the results are encouraging. In
connexion with experiments in the neighbourhood of Mel-
bourne and elsewhere for a number of years, healthy worms
have been brought to maturity, and silk of good quality
produced. The process is a comparatively simple one, and
the details of it are easily mastered, and as an adjunct to
ordinary farming, the younger, and especially the female
members of a family, might find it an easy and profitable
occupation. The number of mulberry trees now being
grown for the feeding and rearing of silkworms amounts to
12,460, covering 18 acres of ground.
The Olive.— The climate of Victoria is well suited to its
growth. The number of acres reported to be under olives
is 20, but we have no available information as to what crop
has been taken from these. The olive is valuable for its
oil, which is used as an article of food, and also for medicinal
purposes.
The Tobacco Plant. —This has been grown successfully.
Care requires to be exercised in the selection of suitable
soil for it. The leaf of several kinds that have been tried
has been found to produce excellent cigars. The number of
acres under tobacco is 1,936, but the yield last year was
small in consequence of extensive failure in the crop.
Dui'ing the previous year it amounted to 15,662 cwt.
The Hop. —This plant, which was at one time so much
dreaded that the English Parliament was petitioned to
prevent its use in the making of beer, because it was “ a
wicked weed,” spoiling the flavour of the drink, and
imperilling the health of the people, is now well known as
being of the greatest value in the manufacture of that
beverage. Its bitter principle possesses tonic qualities,
and these give to bitter beer its chief medicinal value. The
hop has been grown successfully in Gippsland. The
number of acres covered by it is 203, and the yield in 1878
35
Our Colony in 1880.


was 130,816 lbs. of hops. The following statement made in con-
nection with an agency established for the sale of hops in Mel-
bourne, will show how steadily the production of this crop
has increased : —“ Two years ago the company received
about 100 bales of hops for sale ; last year the quantity
had increased to nearly 300 bales ; and this year the crop
amounts to 558 bales, of the value of nearly .£IO,OOO.
Gippsland promises to be the great hop-growing district of
the colony. Those grown near Bairnsdale are said to com-
pare favourably in colour, strength, and aroma with the best
imported samples.”
Arrowroot.— The value of this as furnishing a simple,
nutritious, and easily digestible food for children and
invalids, is universally recognized. The large quantity of
400,000 lbs. is annually imported into Great Britain. The
number of acres under arrowroot is 4, and the yield,
according to the latest statistics, was 67 cwt.
In addition to these, opium poppies, flax, osiers, teazles,
medicinal herbs, and various others have already been
grown in different parts of the colony.
The Government Botanist has repeatedly called attention
to the fact that a large proportion of the most valuable and
useful plants grown in mild and warm climates might be
successfully cultivated in Victoria. Among these may be
mentioned the tea plant, which is but little affected either
by the scorching heat of the summer north wind or the
occasional frosts that descend on the lower levels; the date
palm, which constitutes a principal source of wealth in
Egypt, Persia, and Arabia, and whose fruit may be said to
feed nations; and rice, which in like manner constitutes the
staple article of food to millions of people. We are told
that rice would luxuriate on every part of the great Aus-
tralian continent where irrigation could be secured, and
that the hardy mountain rice of China and Japan would be
quite independent of such irrigation, especially in the milder
and moister districts of Gipps Land. It might be a boon to
the colony if test plantations could be established, so that
the agriculturist could be certain of safe counsel and guid-
ance in the introduction of new vegetable growths.
In addition to the land occupied as farms, there were,
according to the latest returns, 12,841 acres occupied as
gardens, and 7464 acres as orchards. We are not aware


BALLÁARAT.




that any return has been made as to the nature of the crops
cultivated, or the extent of the yield. We may be per-
mitted here, to venture the suggestion that even a very
small holding may in a climate like ours be pro6tably util-
ized. The market gardens cultivated by the Chinese in the
midst of us afford some illustration of this. With irriga-
tion, proper manuring, and industry, a great deal may be
done. A new field of industiy, which would give health-
ful and remunerative employment to numerous families,
might be opened up on a considerable scale by the introduc-
tion of a greater variety of the numerous useful plants
which are known to thrive in genial climates like that of
Victoria. Small allotments would suffice for this, and in
the case of families, the younger members might in this way,
for a time, find useful employment. In the appendix to
the “ Report of the proceedings taken under the provisions
of the Land Act’’for last year, there is mention made of one
start in a new direction. The land officer for the district
of Alexandra says, “ A selector had tried bee-farming, with
encouraging results ; it is reported he sold, last year, about
three tons of honey at s|d. per lb.” An illustration of
what can be done by small cultivators is given in a recent
magazine article on “ The Fruits of Territorialism,” from
the pen of the Rev, Mr. Zinke. He says, “In the market
gardens near Paris 6000 people are employed. The land
they cultivate lets for from <£36 to £4B per acre, when pro-
vided with wells and tanks. Besides these, a garden of
about an acre and a half requires a plant of nearly £5OO in
glass, mats, frames, tools, baskets, &c. The marshy and
boggy land round Amiens, that has been reclaimed for gar-
dening, lets at from £9 to £l2 an acre, and sells for from
£2OO to £240 an acre. In the returns for 1873 we are told
that in France 1,250,000 acres are devoted to gardening.
Their small cultivators keep poultry on the same scale and
with the same success. They supply the whole of Europe
with dried fruit; and they might go far in the same direc-
tion, were transport possible, with respect to eggs and
poultry and vegetables. The reason of all this is simply
that in France the land is largely divided, and cultivated for
the most part by the man who owns it. That is the domin-
ant fact which gives the whole agriculture of the country
its power and character.”

CHAPTER XIV.
THE GOLD FIELDS AND GOLD MINING.
Victoria has had its golden era. The story of it has many
a time been told. Our narrative of it will therefore be
brief. The existence of gold in the soil became known at
an early date. Whispers of its being found were heard
here and there. On the mountain spurs, or in the beds of
creeks, tiny morsels of the glittering metal were picked up
by solitary men. In January, 1849, something more
definite came to light. A well-authenticated rumor spread,
that a shepherd had found it in the ranges of the Pyrenees.
Then came other reliable rumours. In 1850, the Hon.
William Campbell was reported to have found it at Clunes.
In quick succession came reports of its discovery at Lexton,
at Anderson’s Creek, in the quartz rocks of the Pyrenees,
at Mount Alexander, at Buninyong, and at Ballarat. The
Government did not look favourably on the discovery.
They would rather that the reports of it had not been made
public. Their policy was one of obstruction to gold-seeking.
But in vain did they throw “ the wet blanket” on the
kindling flame. The excitement grew apace. The tide
which had set in, rose rapidly, threatening to sweep all
before it • and constrained to give way, the Government
issued the first licence to mine for gold on the Ist of Sep-
tember, 1851. Immediately on this, the colony became a
scene of the wildest excitement. Gold here, there, yonder,
everywhere ; who could resist the dazzling prize ! A moral
epidemic set in. Rightly was it called the “gold fever.” In
a very little while the people were “ drunk with gold.”
“ Off to the diggings” was the cry. The little world of
Melbourne was “ turned upside down.” Workman and
master, clerk and shopman, mechanic and merchant, young
men and old men, teacher and even preacher, under the
influence of the mania, for the time forsook their posts, their
families and their homes, and hurried on in one indis-
criminate rush to the various localities in which, according
to rumor, golden harvests were being gathered. It is scarcely
to be wondered at that in these circumstances society should
have become sadly disorganized, and that for a time reck-
lessness, demoralization, and lawlessness should have widely
prevailed. But out of transitory evil, under the over-ruling


hand of Providence, came permanent good. The eyes of
thousands in the crowded cities of the old country were
turned towards the golden land, and the dazzling magnet
drew rapidly to these shores a population which, but for it,
never had come hither, and whereby the lands were taken
possession of, communities formed, free and enlightened in-
stitutions organized, and the foundations laid of what
promises to become, at no very remote date, a great
Empire.
The finds of gold, in the earlier days of its story, seem as
though they were fabulous. And yet the statements we are
now about to make are well authenticated facts. Men work-
ing in their own claims have made as much as £2O per week,
and that for several years in succession. A single digger
has washed £I2OO worth of gold from a bucket full of soil.
Out of one claim in the alluvium at the Red Hill the owner took
£30,000. Onetubfullof wash-dirtat a famoussinking at Bal-
larat, yielded to “ The Blacksmith Party,” gold to the value of
£2325. The party took out of the same claim £24,000
worth of gold. The Band of Hope Company took gold to
the value of £60,000 out of their lead in forty-four days.
The result of the quartz crushings during one year by the
Port Phillip and Colonial Gold Mining Company, at Clunes,
amounted in value to £BO,OOO. The yield of ten days’ work
in the Morning Star claim was £40,000 worth of gold.
Single nuggets have been unearthed which constituted in
themselves a fortune. The welcome found at Ballarat was
disposed of in Melbourne for £9,325. The Blanche Barkly,
found at Kingower, and sent to London, proved when
melted down to be of the value of £6,935 12s. 9d. The
Welcome Stranger, found by two men near Dunolly, in
1869, yielded £9,534 worth of gold. These are only a
few instances out of hundreds that might be given of rich
nuggets and princely yields, from alluvial and quartz claims
throughout the colony.
The following statistics relative to the gold mines of Vic-
toria are taken from the Year-Book for 1878-79.
The number of persons engaged in gold-mining in 1878
amounted to 36,636. The quantity of gold raised amounted
to 775,272 oz., which, at £4 per oz., gives a gross value of
over three millions sterling. About 65 per cent, of this is
estimated to have been obtained from the quartz reefs, and


-35 per cent, from the alluvial deposits. Divided among
the miners employed in extracting it, it gives £B3 per man
for the year. The entire quantity of gold obtained between
the commencement of the diggings in 1851 and 1878,
amounts to 48 millions of ounces, which, at £4 per oz , gives a
total value of over 192 millions of money. The extent of
auriferous ground worked upon during the year was
estimated at 1,290 square miles. In quartz mining at
Stawell, shafts have been sunk to a depth of over 2,000
feet. During the year, 1,036 steam engines were employed
in connexion with the mines, with a horse-power of 22,711.
Since the foregoing paragraph was written we have
received the summary of gold-mining statistics issued by
the Government for the quarter which ended on the 31st
March, 1880. The total number of miners is given as
37,193. The approximate value of mining plant is given
as £1,857,298, and the number of distinct quartz reefs
actually proved to be auriferous is set down as 3,595, At
the Scotchman’s Reef, Ararat, quartz had been got at the
depth of 1,120 feet, and at the Scotchman’s Flat, at the
depth of 1,200 feet. The largest quantity of quartz crushed
during the quarter was 14,523 tons from the Clunes reef,
belonging to the Port Phillip Company. The largest
average yield of gold per ton was 5 oz. 13 dwt. 1 gr. from
the Church Hill reef, belonging to the Union Company, in
the Amherst division of the district of Maryborough. The
deepest shaft is that of the Magdala Company, Ararat,
which has reached a depth of 2,333 feet, and where they
are still sinking. The total quantities of gold got during
the quarter were as follows;—Alluvial, 66,174 oz. 1 dwt.;
quartz, 113,775 oz. 11 dwt; total, 179,949 oz. 12 dwt.,
which, at £4 per oz., gives a gross value of £719,796.
The following are a few of the more important crushings
of quartz, and the yield therefrom during the quarter. The
Band of Hope and Albion Consols Company crushed 3,243
tons, which yielded 4,071 oz. of gold. The Port Phillip
Tributers crushed 12,254 tons, the yield being 3,611 oz.
1 dwt. The South Clunes Tributers crushed 7,704 tons,
the yield being 2,209 oz. 19 dwt. The Band of Hope
crushed 3,413 tons, the yield being 1,446 oz. 16 dwt. 18 gr.
The Egerton Limited crushed 7,502 tons, the yield being
2,813 oz. 14 dwt, 12 gr. The Black Horse United crushed

4,124 tons, the yield being 2,060 oz. The Garden Gully
United crushed 4,015 tons, the yield being 5,921 oz. The
New Chum United crushed 1,807 tons, the yield being
2,776 oz. 18 dwt. The Beehive crushed 3,900 tons, the
yield being 1,140 oz. 10 dwt. The Great Extended
Hustler’s crushed 2,142 tons, the yield being 1,362 oz,
17 dwt. The Victoria Consols crushed 3,130 tons, the
yield being 2,598 oz. 19 dwt. 12 gr. The New Era crushed
6,226 tons, the yield being 1,532 oz. 4 dwt.
The following are the largest average yields of gold per
ton of quartz reported during the quarter : —Strath Creek,
12 oz. ; Jackass Reef, 10 oz. 7 dwt. ; Doyle’s Reef, Reedy
Creek, 10 oz. ; Church Hill Reef, 5 oz. 13 dwt. 1.04 gr.
The average yield from the total crushings in the mining
districts was 9 dwts. -
The following are a few of the more important yields
from washdirt, puddled or sluiced in various districts,
during the quarter. Ah Kay and party, Spring Gully,
obtained 70 oz. of gold from 6,000 tons of washdirt.
Parsons, Tonkin and Co., Murdering Flat, obtained 100 oz,
from 3,000 tons. Mein’s Freehold, Guilford, obtained
686 oz. 5 dwt. from 4,680 tons. The Ironstone Hill Co.,
Taradale South, obtained 458 oz. 1 dwt. 12 gr. from 1,500
tons. The Confluence Company, Malmsbury, obtained 400
o«. 12 dwt. 12 gr. from 2,000 tons. 250 Chinese, in the
Hepburn district, obtained 600 oz. from 2,000 tons. 146
Europeans in the Warrandyte district, obtained 1,000 oz,
from 10,000 tons.
The question naturally arises, what is the probable future
of gold-mining in the colony ? To speak with anything like
confidence in reply to this question might be hazardous.
And yet, at the same time, from the knowledge afforded us
by the past, we may venture one or two rational deductions.
First; Like all other industries, mining has been suffering
from the depression of the times. This depression may
however, be expected gradually to pass away. With a
general revival of business, there will come a revival of this
industry also. More money will be invested, fresh trials
will be made, and new life and activity will pervade the en-
terprise.
Second: There have not been wanting of late, signs
oLnew hopefulness, and considerable improvement. Splen-

did yields have been reported from the alluvial sinkings of
the Working Miners’ Company at Homebush, in the Mary-
borough mining district. The deep alluvial claims at Beau-
fort also, have been yielding so largely that a mining revival
has set in in the district, and a number of new companies
have been formed. The accounts from Sandhurst have been
good. The following report, recently taken from one of
the newspapers, gives an encouraging statement relative
to mining matters there :—“ The claims giving the largest
returns just now are the United Hustler’s and Redan, and
the Garden Gully United. The former had for their last
fortnight’s woi'k, 1,315 oz. of gold, and the latter 1,086 oz.,
but there are many other claims yielding from 100 oz. to
500 oz. per fortnight. The last yield of the Hustler’s and
Redan Company was from only 139 tons of quartz, and it
provided funds for a 2s. dividend per share, besides leaving
.£SOO towards another dividend. The quartz was of such a
rich character that the boxes had to be frequently relieved
of the amalgam.” Similarly encouraging accounts come from
Ballarat. The local representative of the Argus writes
thus : —“ To say that Ballarat quartz-mining is at present
only in its infancy, might be set down by many people as an
exaggeration, but it would not be going beyond the truth to
say that it is only as yet in its boyhood, for although many
quartz reefs have been tried during the last quarter of acentury,
and many have proved rich where they were tried, there has
been no great systematic opening into these reefs like what
is now taking place on the Sebastopol belt of lodes, with an
amount of success that no one would have believed possible
about twelve months ago. Even after the Band and Albion
Consols Company made the splendid discovery that has re-
stored the drooping confidence of the shareholders, many
people feared it would prove ‘ only a patch,’ instead of which
a number of the new claims that have since been taken up
on that belt of reefs have found good payable stone in large
quantities, and a few of them have already paid dividends.
Hitherto this belt of reefs has been supposed to consist of
two main lodes only—the Township, or eastern, and the
Cemetery, or western, with their various branches and
feeders ; but very recently no less than three new companies
have been formed to work claims on a more easterly lode still,
known as Captain Finn’s reef, from near the surface of


which, it is said, very rich stone was taken by some of the
early miners, before crushing batteries had woke up the
echoes of Ballarat with their discordant music, and if on
being prospected, this reef should prove to carry payable
gold down with it, as others do, another large tract of hitherto
neglected ground will be opened to the speculator and the
miner. On the line of continuation of the Indicator lode,
too, at a place near Sailors’ Gully, some remarkably rich
stone has been struck by a small co-operative party of
miners, which shows that rich stone is not confined to the
Sebastopol reefs alone, as the locality referred to is on a line
of reefs at least two miles to the east of the Sebastopol line.
The co-operative party referred to, nuggeted out 80. oz of
coarse gold in one forenoon, while the Queen Company, on
the same line, but about three miles further north, nug-
geted out 105 oz. on the following day at 500 feet below the
surface, so that patience and energy seem to be all that is
wanted to restore Ballarat to a position approaching to that
which it held in the heyday of its alluvial prosperity.” More
recently still, viz., from the Argus Summary for Europe, of
date the Bth of July, we take the following ;—“ The mining
news from Ballarat during the past fortnight has been of an
exceedingly satisfactory character, and more important than
any that has been published for a long time past. A few
weeks ago a lead of washdirt was struck, which was named
the Hurdsfield, and a number of companies were formed to
work various pieces of ground in the neighbourhood, in the
hope of finding the run of washdirt. Several of these com-
panies have already struck it, and it has proved extremely
rich. On the Ist inst. the East Hurdsfield Company had
144 oz. of gold for the day’s washing up. The Central Hurds-
field Company was said to be washing equally well, and the
Hurdsfield Freehold Company had 223 oz. from the one
machine, and one tubful of dirt. On the next morning, the
latter company was said to have obtained 130 oz. from four
candle-boxes of washdirt. On Friday last the Hurdsfield
Company reported a yield of 583 oz. What astonishes most
people on Ballarat is the extent of this immensely rich field
of washdirt, for though it cannot be expected to cover any
great area, yet no limit has yet been proved ; and an impres-
sion is beginning to prevail that the early diggers, who fol-
lowed the deep beds of the golden gutters only, and
43
Our Colony in 1880.


who in those days knew nothing of reef-washes, may have
left immensely rich beds of high-lying washdirt behind
them, and that there is just a chance that a great deal of
the area on which the city of Ballarat now stands may again
become the theatre of the wild excitement of a quarter of a
century ago. This, of course, is mere conjecture, but it is
taking so firm a hold of some people’s minds that claims
along the course of the Golden-point and Gravel-pits and
other old gutters are being taken up right into the centre of
the city.” We meet with the following statement, also, in
a paragraph relative to the Ballarat gold-field : “ Not at any
time during the last quarter of a century—not even during
the Sir William Don and Webster-street rushes—was there
such rich gold, quartz and alluvial, raised as was the case
during the month of June.” While in some districts the
yield of gold is, meanwhile, decreasing, and in others min-
ing matters are dull and flat, yet in a considerable number
of localities steady work goes on with good results, and here
and there, as indicated in the extracts which we have given,
prospects are of a cheering character.
Third : Very considerable saving in the working of the
mines may from time to time be anticipated through im-
provements in the machinery employed. One illustration
in this direction may be suggested. In some districts, as,
for instance, the Stawell, one important item of expenditure
is caused by the great depth of the mines, and the hardness
of the rocks requiring to be pierced. May not a less expen-
sive mode of operation on the rocks and quartz be found 1
Such has, indeed, already been found. We refer to the
American rock-borer. The result of the experiments with
this at Sandhurst shows that it does the work more econ-
omically than the old system of hand-drilling. When it is
introduced elsewhere, good results may be reported from
mines which, under the present system, cannot be made to
pay. In how many other directions may not savings be
effected 1 In the machinery employed in the manufacture
of woollen fabrics, in England and Scotland, during the last
fifty years, by the introduction of improvements from time
to time, the saving that has been effected is something
astounding. Why may it not be so also in gold-mining 1
According to some, as we have seen, it is yet in its infancy.
Fourth: Fresh gold-fields maybe opened up in the future. It

is scarcely supposable that in a colony, a large proportion
of which is known to be more or less auriferous, all the pay-
able deposits of gold should have been discovered within the
brief limits of a generation. Greater likelihood would seem
to invest the belief, that in the future, sooner or later, fresh
beds of gold, both in the alluvial soil and in the quartz rock,
but especially in the latter, may be brought to light, from
which will be reaped harvests of the precious metal, as
brilliant, it may be, as any that are recorded in the past.
Finally : There is room for great improvement in the spirit
and system which have hitherto characterised the mining
enterprise. It ought to be prosecuted like any other indus-
try, economically, steadily, enduringly. Seasons of sudden
excitement, amounting to “ a mania,” with their inevitable
accompaniment of rash investments, “ splendid ventures,”
dishonest trickery in raising the value of shares, gambling
in scrip and consequent ruin to hundreds, ought to be sedu-
lously avoided. A writer in the Argus who had a large ex-
perience on one of the leading gold-fields of the colony,
says :—“ A s regards mining generally, people are so much
actuated by impulse, that it is almost incredible to what ex-
tremes of mania or panic they may go. One example I may
mention from my own knowledge—viz., that in 1859 a
great mania existed in Bendigo for mining companies, which
ended in an unfortunate panic, inflicting much loss and ruin-
ing a good many people, but it is a fact that the ground of
the exploded companies was afterwards worked successfully
in almost every case.” The same writer also remarks : —“lt
is not too much to say that the field for real mining is al-
most unlimited and practically endless in Victoria—but that
that industry has been prejudiced and neglected through
the impatience, stupidity, and extravagance of those invest-
ing in mining companies. It is time that an earnest atten-
tion were given to this matter, as no doubt this is, par excel-
lence, a mining country, second to none in the world. If
merchants and others would support and look after their
interests in mines as they do in other businesses, the returns
of gold would be very much increased yearly, in place of
gradually diminishing year by year. Careless speculation
in scrip is scarcely more injurious to the interests of mining,
and the interests of the country generally, than a state of
apathy which allows much valuable property to be laid aside
45

and neglected.” That gold-mining when legitimately fol-
lowed pays, that it might be made to pay a great deal better,
that it has given to hundreds of successful business men
their first start in the way of independence or fortune, that
it will prove in the future a source of prosperity to com-
munities, and of maintenance and competence to tens of
thousands individually, seems to be the conclusion warranted
alike by past experience and present prospects.
CHAPTER XV.
METALS AND MINERALS OTHER THAN GOLD.
Mining for metals and minerals other than gold is prose-
cuted on a comparatively small scale. According to the
estimate of the mining department, the quantities of these
raised during the seven years ending 1878 were in value as
follows: —Silver, <£31,885; fin, £343,775; copper, £44,640 t ;
antimony, <£153,169 ; lead, <£4,892; iron, <£2,916;
coal, <£13,505 ; lignite, <£2,367 ; kaolin, £7,444; flagging,
<£45,768 ; slates, £940; gypsum, £5; magnesite, £l2;
ores, mineral earthy clays, and unenumerated, £4,802 ; dia-
monds, £lO7 ; sapphires, &c., £630; total, £656,857.
According to statistics recently issued, at the close of
1879, miners to the number of 190 were occupied in these
departments of mining, and were distributed as follows :
mining for tin, 4 ; for copper, 87 ; for antimony, 84 ; for
ironstone, 30 ; for limestone, 8; for coal, 18 ; for slate and
flag, 26 ; for kaolin, 5 ; and for lignite, 8.
The following were the quantities of these metals and
minerals raised during 1879 : —Silver; the total yield was
23,729 oz. 1 dwt. Of this 48 oz. 6 dwt. were separated
from gold obtained in the St. Arnaud district, and 23,680
oz. 15 dwt. were separated from gold smelted at the Mel-
bourne Mint. No silver ore was raised during the year.
The silver exported amounted to 2,082 oz. Tin; 24 tons
of tin ore and black sand were raised, of which 5 tons were
smelted, yielding 70 per cent, of tin, and 34 tons 10 cwt.
were exported. Copper ; 3,862 tons were raised, and 4,228
tons 6 cwt. were smelted, from which 388 tons 15 cwt.
1 qr. 7 lbs. of regulus were obtained. Of copper, 335 tons
19 cwt. were exported, and of regulus, 225 tons 15 cwt.


Antimony ; 495 tons 15 cwt. 3 qrs. 14 lbs. of ore were
raised, and 169 tons 16 cwt. 2 qr. 12 lbs. were smelted,
from which 68 tons 10 cwt. of regulus were obtained, and
153 tons of ore, and 245 tons 17 cwt. of regains were ex-
ported. Lead ;no ore was raised. Iron ; 120 tons were
raised, from which 52 tons of metal were obtained by smelt-
ing. Gypsum ; 6 tons were raised. Coal; none raised.
Lignite; 1,353 tons 12 cwt. were raised. Flags; 2,102
tons 13 cwt. 2 qr. were quarried.
CHAPTER XVI.
MANUFACTURES.
During the heat of the gold excitement, it was not to be
expected that men would settle down to the industries of
ordinary life. Gold, with people generally, is the end sought
after by these industries, and so long as the gold could be
taken directly from the soil, the quieter and more circuitous
course was not to be thought of. But as that excitement
subsided, the propriety of attempting the establishment of
colonial manufactures began to awaken attention. Was
there a field for them? Would the establishment of them
be likely to prove a profitable investment? What kind of
manufactures afforded a fair chance of success ? Could
skilled hands be found to work them ? These questions
were earnestly discussed. It is indeed true that a beginning
had been made before the discovery of gold absorbed all but
universal attention, for we find in the statistics of the colony
for 1851, that exclusive of flour mills, 56 manufactures and
works were reported as in operation ; but it is only since the
gold excitement considerably abated that there has been a
steady development of manufacturing industries. Last year
the number of factories in the colony with the exclusion
already referred to, was returned at 2,194. We shall pre-
sent in epitom6 an enumeration of the principal of these;
taking our statistics from the Victorian Year Book, so as to
approximate as closely as possible to the facts of the case.
Textile Fabrics. —During 1878-9, there were 9 woollen
factories, all worked by steam power, employing 817 hands,
and turning out for the year over a million yards of tweed,
and other kinds of woollen fabrics, valued at £188,502.

total approximate value of these establishments is estimated
at about £6,800,000. During the last ten years, the number
of manufacturing establishments in the colony have in-
creased from 1,314 to 2,343 ; the number of hands
employed in them from 16,612 to 33,278; and the
approximate value of lands, buildings, machinery and plant
from £3,329,605, to £6,798,636.
CHAPTER XVII.
POPULATION, PROFESSIONS, AND PROPERTIES.
No census of the people has been taken since 1871. The
statistics available, must therefore be regarded merely as
approximate ; at the same time, as they have been carefully
compiled, they may be accepted as substantially correct.
The population at last issue of the Victorian Year Book
was 879,442, and the preponderance of males over females
amounted to 77,190. The increase during the year was
18,655, made up of an excess of births over deaths to the
extent of 13,879, and an excess of arrivals over departures
to the extent of 4,776.
The proportion of the sexes has stood for the last six
years at 119 males to 100 females.
E


It is worthy of note that among the population are num-
bered 3,872 persons of 75 years of age and upwards.
Of the population as thus given, 468,719 are Victorian
born, 317,153 are from Great Britain, and the remainder
from British possessions and other foreign countries.
On 31st December last the population was estimated at
899,333.
In the matter of professions or occupations, the largest
distributions are as follows :—125,755 persons are devoted
to pastoral and agricultural pursuits and others subsidiary to
these; 37,425 to mining and subsidiary work ; 49,795 to such
occupations as those of contractors, artizans, and mechanics;
12,367 to trade; 16,697 to dealing in food; 31,804 to
labouring work ; 14,436 to the professions strictly so-called;
4,915 to Government work; the remainder being distributed
among various other occupations.
The population of Victoria is much denser than that of
the other colonies. While New South Wales gives 2,130
persons to the square mile, and New Zealand gives 3,964,
Victoria gives 9,760. The amplitude of the field presented
by Victoria for the reception of immigrants will appear
from the consideration that Great Britain and Ireland give
30 times the number that Victoria gives to the square mile,
viz., 280 individuals.
The arrivals in the colony during the year, including child-
ren and infants, amounted to 42,268, and the departures from
the colony, to 37,492, giving an excess in favor of the
former of 4,776. Excluding children and infants from the
calculation, an excess in favor of immigration is shown to
the extent of 4,965 persons. The only assisted immigration
recorded during the year, was that of 18 warrant passengers
from the United Kingdom.
There were 59 cities, towns, and boroughs in Victoria,
and 114 shires. These bodies exist under the Local
Government Act, and are called municipalities. Under
the former class there were 89,731 dwellings, and a revenue
of £453,665 ; under the latter, 91,230 dwellings, and a
revenue of £455,593. During the four years previous the
total increase in the value of rateable property amounted
to £4,563,211 in cities, towns, and boroughs, and to

MARRIAGES, BIRTHS, AND DEATHS.
A few of the more prominent facts brought to light by the
vital statistics of the colony may be read with interest.
The number of marriages celebrated in the colony during
the year amounted to 5,092. This gives within a fraction of
7 per 1000 of the mean population. The following some-
what curious items of information crop up. Marriages are
more numerous in Autumn and Spring than in Summer and
Winter. About four-fifths of all the marriages are between
bachelors and spinsters. The next most numerous class
during the last three years have been between widowers
and spinsters. The least numerous class comprises those
between widowers and widows. Last year a divorced
couple were re-married. It is not uncommon for persons
whose wives or husbands have not been heard of for seven
years to marry again. Such cannot be prosecuted for
bigamy, but the issue of the marriages is illegitimate, and
should the missing partner turn up, the marriage is null and
void. Among the marriages of last year were 4 aboriginal
males to 4 aboriginal females. Of Chinamen, 13 were re
turned as having married females, all of whom, with the
exception of 2 were born in Victoria. The ceremony may
be performed, either by ministers of religion who must be
registered so as to be legally qualified for doing so, or by
lay registrars appointed for the purpose. During last year
rather more than 92 per cent, were celebrated by registered
clergymen, while 8 per cent, were celebrated according to
the latter form. Celebration in this way appears to be on
the increase. Those who were unable to write their names
in the marriage documents, and who consequently signed
with a mark, amounted to a mean of 4'71 in every 100
married. In England and Wales, those who signed with a
mark during the year 1876, amounted to 19.2 per 100.
There has been marked progress in this respect in Victoria.
This will be apparent from the fact that the mean number
of those who signed with a mark during the years between
1853 and 1872 was 14-95, and even so late as 1873, was
8-26. The largest proportion of those who signed with
marks last year belonged to the Roman Catholic denomina


tiou, and the smallest to the Jews. The youngest bride-
groom married during the last year was aged 17, and the
youngest bride 14. The number of minors, that is, of those
who had not attained the full age of 21 years, who were
married during the year amounted to 150 males and 1,481
females. More females marry under age in Victoria than
in England and Wales, in proportion to the total numbers
marrying, and fewer males.
The birth rate last year was a fraction over 33 in every
1000 of the population, being a little less than the average of
England and Scotland, but considerably higher than that of
France and Ireland. The proportion of males to females
was 107.2 boys to 100 girls. The births exceeded the
deaths by 13,879.
The chances of life in the colony must be regarded as
good. The death rate, estimated by statistics extending
over a period of 11 years, shows an average of 15.25 per
1000 of the mean population. This compares favorably
with the death rate in European countries generally. Dxiring
1876 it amounted to 22.1 per 1000 inEnglandand Scotland,
to 24.5 in France, and to 27.4 in Prussia. In the United
Kingdom the mortality is greatest during the winter season,
but in the colony the mortality is greatest during the summer,
the cold proving more fatal in the one case, and the heat in
the other. Among the deaths registered in 1878 there were
217 octogenarians, and of these 17 had numbered over 90
years, and two had passed the age of 100. It is, we believe,
a prevailing impression that the infant mortality of the
colony is somewhat alarmingly high. There can be little
doubt that the summer heat, especially when excessive, is
trying to mere infants; at the same time exaggerated
notions are entertained about it. The average mortality of
London among infants under twelve months, extending over
a period of several years, was 16.1 to every 100 births ; in
Melbourne the average over a period of years was 16.90.
In England and Wales it is greater than in Victoria, and in
Scotland also there is a perceptible excess. The malady
that proves most fatal in the case of children is diarrhoea,
and in the case of aged people, heart disease ; while among
the younger class of adults typhoid proves particularly
deadly—about 400 deaths annually being traceable to this
cause. The strong and the feeble alike are attacked by it.

At the same time it is to be noticed that, according to
eminent medical authority, the ravages of this malady may,
by proper care and watchfulness, in a large measure be
kept under control. The mortality through this cause has
been considerably reduced of late years in England and
Wales. We are assured by Dr. Farr and other competent
men, that the specific germs of enteric fever are propagated
mainly through water, milk, foul clothes and the like, and
it follows that by strict attention to water and milk supply,
and by carefulness in washing or destroying the clothing in
which such germs may lurk, and by other like precautions,
this disease may be greatly mitigated in its ravages, if
indeed, not altogether suppressed. When speaking of
typhoid fever we do not include typhus, as a distinction is
now made in England between fevers of the typhoid type
and typhus, and indeed it is held by some whose opinion is
entitled to deference, that, up to the present time, no real
typhus exists in Yictoi’ia. Of all diseases prevailing in the
colony, phthisis may be set down as being on the average the
most extensively fatal. For a few years measles and
scarlatina took the lead, but an abatement of these has put
phthisis, meanwhile, at the head of the list. The death rate
from this cause is higher in Melbourne and suburbs than in
the country towns and districts, but not so high as it is in
London.
CHAPTER XIX.
LIABILITIES, INCOME, AND EXPENDITURE.
The public debt in Victoria, as given in the Year Book,
amounted to X 17,022,065. This does not include the last
loan, amounting to £3,000,000, which was floated in
London during last year. Among the purposes for
which the debt has been contracted from time to time,
may be mentioned : —Railway Construction, involving an
expenditure of £13,515,885 ; Provincial Water Supply,
Graving Dock, and other public works, £2,343,407 ; and
State-school buildings, £600,000. The proportionate
indebtedness of every individual, male and female, young
and old, in the colony, at the date referred to, was £l9 12s.
lnterest is paid at the rate of 6 per cent, on over 9


millions of it ; 5 per cent, on close on 2\ millions, and 4
per cent, on over oj? millions. Six-sevenths of the interest
on the entire Government loans is paid in London, and the
remainder in Melbourne. The annual interest amounts to
a charge of £1 Os. 7|d. per head of the entire population.
The revenue for the year amounted to £4,485,412.
Recoups, i.e., the recovery of monies advanced from the
revenue in previous years, are set down as <£19,001 addi-
tional. The leading sources of revenue are : —The Customs,
which yielded £1,487,448 ; the Railways, £1,202,280 ; the
Land Sales (including rents, counting towards purchase
money), £756,674 ; Post and Telegraph Department,
£239,002 ; Rents of Crown Lands (not counting towards
purchase money), £186,337 ; Fines, Fees, and Forfeiture-!
(exclusive of Land Act Penalties), £119,632 ; Water
Supply, £104,819 ; Interest and Exchange, £78,080 ; and
Duties on Estates of Deceased Persons, £72,500. The
remaining heads of revenue are of smaller note in point of
income, such as Land Tax, Mint Charges, Excise, Ports and
Harbours, Business Licenses, Duties on Bank Notes,
Penalties under Land Act, Public Works (exclusive of
railways and water supply), Rents (ordinary), Reimburse-
ments in Aid, and Miscellaneous receipts.
The expenditure for the year amounted to £4,634,349.
The leading heads of expenditure were —Interest, £920,911 ;
Railways, £616,207 ; Public Works, £562,505 ; Public
Instruction, Science, &c., £519,175; Postal and Telegraphic
Department, £376,091 ; Charitable Institutions, Medical,
&c,, £281,509 ; Judicial and Legal, £171,065 ; Crown
Lands and Survey, £150,248. The remaining heads of ex-
penditure involve smaller amounts.
Other items of expenditure, which do not constitute
a charge on the general revenue, but are provided
for by means of loans, and the expenditure of the Harbour
Trust, are treated in separate accounts, and embrace the
following purposes ;—Water Supply, Public Buildings, Rail-
ways, State School Buildings, Alfred Graving Dock, De-
fences, Maintenance and Improvement of Port of Melbourne,
embracing a total of £1,063,891.
The expenditure was greater than the revenue by
£129,936 6s. Id.
The local bodies of the colony, comprising the Munich


palities and the Harbour Trust, have their own separate
system of finance, a few facts connected with which may
be perused with interest. The revenue of the Municipalities
for the year amounted to £909,258. This revenue accrued
from rates, tolls, licenses, market dues, and other sources,
and included an endowment from the Government of
£269,830. Under certain conditions, the Government
grant is paid to cities, towns, and boroughs in the proportion
of £l, and to shires in the proportion of £2 for every £1
of general rates collected. A considerable falling off in the
revenue of municipalities took place during the year, as
compared with the previous year, but this is to be accounted
for mainly by the fact of the final abolition of tolls, which
took place on the Ist January of that year, and which the
increased rates proved inadequate to meet.
The Municipal expenditure during the year amounted to
£983,333, embracing salaries paid to officials, public works,
and other objects.
The receipts of the Melbourne Harbour Trust amounted
to £86,746, of which the principal item was wharfage rates;
and the expenditure amounted to £92,136, of which the
principal item consisted in outlay on plant, and the forma-
tion and maintenance of wharves and approaches. The
special survey of Sir John Goode involved an expenditure of
£4,635.
CHAPTER XX.
GOLD AND ITS ACCUMULATION.
The gold issued from the Melbourne Mint amounted to
2,171,000 sovereigns, and the bullion to the value of £14,640.
The coin exported from the colony during the year exceeded
what was issued from the mint by £228,741. About three-
fourths of the gold received at the Mint was raised in
Victoria, and the remainder was furnished by New Zealand,
the other Australasian colonies, and Natal. N o other coin
save gold is issued from it. During the five previous financial
years the Mint has been worked at a loss to the country
of £26,000.
The notes in circulation in connection with the various
banks amounted to £1,281,134, while the deposits


bearing interest amounted to <£11,604,003, and the deposits
not bearing interest to £4,602,578. The capital stock paid
up amounted to <£9,188,653, the average rate of interest per
annum paid to shareholders, to a fraction over 11 per
cent., and the amount of reserved profits, after declaring
dividend, to £2,950,743. The rates paid on monies depo-
sited for a period of twelve months, ranged from 5 to 64 per
cent. More than three-fifths of the deposits were interest-
bearing.
There were 184 savings banks in existence. In
connection with these there were 76,697 depositors, having
balances to the extent of £1,510,273. or an average of £l9
13s. lOd. per each depositor. The rate of interest paid by
savings banks for monies deposited in them is limited to 4
per cent. There has been a steady increase in the number
of depositors from year to year.
There were 62 building societies in the colony, with
21,404 members. The income of the entire number for the
year amounted to £1,097,475, and the money advanced
during the same period amounted to £703,932. Their
assets exceeded their liabilities by £375,315, and they held
money on deposit to the extent of £703,463.
CHAPTER XXL
IMPORTS AND EXPORTS.
Like other communities, Victoria has been suffering through
a somewhat lengthened period of stagnation in business. In
some departments of trade and commerce there has been
retrogression, in others there has been no adequate progress.
The consuming power of the people has suffered diminution,
enterprise has been checked, and business generally has been
at a standstill. We do not intend to discuss the causes that
have led to this, in this little work. Opinions may possibly
differ, and leave our readers to draw their own conclu-
sions. All we would say is, that it is to be hoped that our
leaders will strive to get rid of mere party bias, and in the
light of indisputable and grave facts, so counsel and legislate
for the future, as that industrial enterprise will be wisely
directed, and a fair field secured for the development of our

unquestionably great resources. The colony will not fail
to prosper if it be not hindered by unwise measures.
The declared value of the total imports of the colony for the
year was <£16,161,880, and of the exports, £14,925,707 ;
thus giving as the entire value of the external trade of the
colony the sum of £31,087,587. It is to be noticed that in
this sum there is included the value of the wool brought
from the neighbouring colonies to Melbourne for the con-
venience of shipment. The excess of imports over exports
was £1,236,173.
These figures show a decrease in the value of imports
from the preceding year, to the extent of £200,424, and
in the value of exports to the extent of £231,980.
The imports and exports per head amounted to £35 15s.
sd. In 1876 they were given as £8 135., for the United
Kingdom, and £4 11s. 6d. for Canada.
Since the above was written, returns have been laid before
Parliament, showing the total value of all imports for the
period 1872-79. They show an increase during the last two
years in wool, specie and gold bullion, to the extent of
£1,222,238, but it is to be borne in mind that these imports
were mainly for transit to foreign countries ; whereas in the
imports used or consumed in the colony, they show, for the
same time a decrease to the extent of £2,173,225. A
decrease is shown in the total of exports for the same time
to the extent of £3,199,229, this, however, being accounted
for on the two items of wool and gold. Among the exports
whose value has increased during the last two years, may be
mentioned butter, cheese, ham, bacon, &c., which were nearly
doubled ; flour, grain, and pulse, which rose from £32,263
to £140,558 ; fruits, jams, and preserves, which were more
than doubled; and timber, which rose from £17,323 to
£25,372. Agricultural implements, machinery, furniture,
candles, bags, &c., have shown a decline.
The tariff at present ruling in Victoria, is the result of a
Bill which after passing the two Houses of Legislature, re-
ceived the Governor’s assent on the 17th December, 1879.
It enacts that certain duties shall be chargeable on specific
articles on their importation into the colony by land or sea,
in lieu of those formerly charged. The day fixed for the
tariff coming into operation, except as to articles against
which another date was affixed was the 30th July, 1879.


CHAPTER XXII.
SHIPPING, RAILWAYS, TELEGRAPH LINES AND POST
OFFICES.
The number of vessels which entered Victorian Ports during
the year was 2,119, of which 1,140 were steamers, and 979
sailing vessels. The total tonnage of these was 951,750 tons,
and the entire crews numbered 43,082. Of these vessels
1,664 entered the port of Melbourne, 209 that of Echuca,
75 that of Geelong, 21 that of Warrnambool, and 13 that of
Belfast, (Port Fairy) ; while the vessels leaving from these
ports were:—from Melbourne, 1,660, from Echuca, 215,fr0m
Geelong, 75, from Warrnambool, 44, and from Belfast, 10.
At the close of the year there were 1052 miles of railway
open. These were constructed at a cost of £14,419,824.
Additional lines to the extent of 140 miles were authorized
or in course of construction. The passengers who travelled
by railway during the year amounted to 8,004,646, being
an increase over the previous year of 666,720. The goods
conveyed, including live-stock, amounted to 1,188,835 tons,
or a decrease on the previous year of 63,976 tons. In work-
ing the traffic, 148 locomotive engines were employed, 231
passenger vehicles, and 2763 goods waggons and other con-
veyances. The working expenses amounted to £625,699
and the receipts to £1,216,675. The interest payable on
the capital yearly amounts to £732,218, The passenger
rate per mile amounts to 2d. first class, and l|d. second
class. The Melbourne and Hobson’s Bay Company’s lines
are not included in these statistics. These have recently,
however, become the property of the Government, so that
all the railways are now in their hands.
During the year 30 additional telegraph officeswere opened,
and 204 miles of wire added to the lines. The number of
telegrams sent amounted to 1,003,654, and the revenue
therefrom to £60,287, giving an increase over the former
year of 5 per cent.
There were 64 additional post offices opened during the
year. The total number of letters transmitted amounted to
22,324,921, showing an increase over the previous year of
6f per cent. The gross postal revenue amounted to £191,515,
giving an increase over the previous year of 4|- per cent.


CHAPTER XXIII.
LABOUR, WAGES, AND PRICES.
The labour market lias been suffering considerable depression
of late. Capitalists have been reluctant to invest their
monies in productive undertakings, numerous business houses
have had to curtail their operations, house-building has sus-
tained a severe check, numbers of tradesmen are unemployed,
and works have been started by the Government for the
purpose of affording temporary relief to the laboring classes.
Such seasons seem to overtake both old and young com-
munities periodically, but the depression in Victoria has
been considerably aggravated by the unsettled and unsettling
aspect of political matters. Signs of improvement have
recently been apparent, and it is to be hoped that ere long
the colony will enter on a new period of progress.
During the year there were 71,954: males and 31,566
females employed on farms and stations. This gives
an increase in females of 1,102, but a decrease in males of
446 as compared with the previous year.
There were 32,278 employed in connection with manu-
factories and other works, showing an increase over the
previous year of 590.
There were 22,504 engaged in alluvial mining, and 14,132
in quartz mining, of which numbers 26,998 were of Euro-
pean extraction and 9,638 of Chinese. In addition there
were 557 engaged in mining for other minerals than gold.
We have no means of knowing the number of general
labourers distributed throughout the colony. In the last
census papers 15,289 persons were enumerated under that
designation.
Wages have been somewhat steady for a considerable
time past. Generally speaking they are higher in country
districts than in Melbourne. The recognized working day
for artisans and general labourers is eight hours. Our
limited space prevents us from entering into full and minute
details as to wages. The following statements will give
some idea of the average rates which have for some time
been ruling in various departments of labour :
Ploughmen from 18s to 225. 6d. per week with rations.
Farm labourers from 15s. to 20s. with rations. Shepherds


from <£3o to £SO per annum, with rations, Stockkeepers from
£4O to £55 with rations. Hutkeepers, £2B with rations.
Masons, carpenters, bricklayers, plasterers, and slaters,
10s. per day; coachbuilders, bi’assfinishers, coppersmiths,
and the iron trade from £2 ss. to £3 12s. per week. Tin-
smiths from £2 to £3 per week. Plumbers, £3 per week.
Painters and glaziers, 9s. per day. Saddlers from 255. to
£2 15s. per week. Tanners and curriers from £2 to £3 10s.
per week. Tailors from £2 to £3 per week. Drapers,
carpet-salesmen, and upholsterers from £2 10s. to £4 per
week. Jewellers from £2 15s. to £3 15s. per week. Watch-
makers from £3 10s. to £5 per week. Printers, Is. per
1000. Lithographers and binders from £2 10s. to £3 15s.
per week.
Gardeners from 15s. to 255. per week. Labourers from
ss. to 7s. per day. Grooms from 30s. to 40s. per week.
Coachmen from 355. to 50s. per week.
Married couples (without family) for home stations, from
£6O to £9O per annum, with board and lodging. Married
couple (with family) from £4O to £SO per annum. Men
cooks on farms and stations from £45 to £55 per annum.
General servants from £25 to £35 per annum. Female
cooks from £35 to £6O per annum. Nursemaids from £25
to £35 per annum. Housemaids from £3O to £35 per
annum. Laundresses from £3O to £35 per annum.
Milliners from 355. to £3 10s. per week. Needlewomen and
-dressmakers from 15s. to 20s. per week. Tailoresses from
£1 to £1 15s. per week.
The prices that rule in Melbourne at present are remark-
ably moderate, and now that production increases at a
greater ratio than population, it may be reasonably expected
that they will be low in the future. Groceries, tobacco,
coal, &c., are, as might be expected, higher in country dis-
tricts than in the metropolis; but, on the other hand,
farm produce, firewood, &c., are considerably lower. The
following are the prices of a few of the more common articles
cf household use : —Flour, l|d. per lb. ; bread (41b. loaf), sd.
to 6d. ; butter, 6d. to Is. per lb. ; cheese (colonial), 6d. to
lOd. per lb. ; milk, 4d. to 6d. per quart; tea, Is. 3d. to 3s.
per lb.; coffee, Is. Id. to Is. lOd. per lb.; sugar, 3d. to 4|d.
per lb.; rice, 3d to 4d. per lb.; tobacco, 3s. to 6s. per lb. ;
salt, Id. per lb.; bacon, 7d. to Is. per lb. ; ham, lOd. to Is.

per lb. ; eggs, 9d. to lid. per doz. ; potatoes, Ld. per lb. j
cabbages, 6d. to Is. per doz.; cauliflowers, 6dto 2s. per doz ;
turnips and carrots, Id. per bunch y lettuces, 6d. to 9d. per
doz. ; green peas, Id. to. 4d. per lb. ; ale 9d. to Is. per
bottle; brandy, 3s. 6d. to 6s. 6d. per bottle ; whiskey, 3s.
to 3s. 9d. per bottle ; port wine, 2s. 6d. to 6s. per bottle ;
claret, 2s. 6d. to 6s. per bottle.
CHAPTER XXIV.
CRIMINAL ARRESTS, COMMITMENTS, AND CONVICTIONS.
The number of persons taken into custody by the police
during the year amounted to 25,544. Of these 7,448 were
discharged by magistrates, 17,438 were summarily convicted
or held to bail, and 658 were committed for trial. Of those
committed for trial, to whom must be added 106 remaining
over from the previous year, 458 were convicted and sen-
tenced.
Commitments for offences of a serious nature have of late
years been diminishing.
The number of females arrested was considerably less than
one-third the number of males.
Of the numbers arrested over 15 years of age, one-fourth,
viz., 6,235 could read and write well, and a little over one-
seventh, viz., 3,696 could not read. The former included
those who had received a good education.
The largest number of persons taken into custody were
from Ireland. Though the natives of England and Wales in
the population, exceed by close on 70,000 the natives of Ire-
land, the ai’rests during the year among the latter exceeded
those among the former by 770. The offences for which the
Irish were arrested were, however, of a less serious character
than those for which the natives of England and Wales were
arrested, as shown by the fact that the number of the latter
actually committed for trial was, in proportion to the popu-
lation, greater than that of the former. The arrests and
commitments among the Scottish portion of the population,
were proportionately smaller than those among the English.
The number of Victorians arrested and committed was
smaller than that of any other nationality. In connection


with this fact, the statement is to he borne in mind that a
large proportion of children is included in them. Next to the
Victorians, honorable mention must be made of the Chinese.
No execution took place during the year. There has been
only one other year since the separation of the colony from
New South Wales of which this can be said.
CHAPTER XXV.
CONSTITUTION AND GOVERNMENT.
Victoria is an independent Colony. Though in connection
with the British Empire, it possesses a political Constitu-
tion of its own. This Constitution was proclaimed on the
23rd November, 1855, at which date it assumed the reins
of responsible government.
The Government is modelled upon that of England.
There is a Governor, representing the authority of the
Queen ; a Legislative Assembly, answering to the House of
Commons ; and a Legislative Council, answering to the
House of Lords, There is also an Executive Council, con-
sisting of the Governor and members of the Ministry for
the time being.
The Legislative Council consists of thirty members, elec-
ted by six provinces, each province returning five members.
The electors in these provinces on 30th April, 1880, num-
bered 32,772. The members are elected for ten years, one
member for each province retiring every two years. The
qualification for membership is the possession of property
of the value of £2,500, or the annual value of £250. The
qualification for voting is :—lst. The possession or occu-
pation of freehold or leasehold property of the rateable
value of not less than £5O per annum ; or 2nd., joint
ownership or occupation of sufficient value to give to each
person concerned in it the foregoing qualification ; or 3rd,
holders of mortgages on property of like value ; or 4th,
certain professions, viz, : University students or graduates,
ministers of religion, members of the legal and medical pro-
fession, schoolmasters, and military and naval officers.
The Legislative Assembly consists of 86 members, re-
turned by 55 electoral districts, and is triennial in its


duration. The number of electors, according to the latest
return, was 200,701. The qualifications for membership
are the same as the qualifications for voting. They are as
follow:—Every male person of 21 years of age, who is not
subject to any legal incapacity, and who is a naturalised or
denizen subject of the Queen, and has resided in Victoria
twelve months previous to the first day of January or of
July in any year, or has been naturalized or made denizen
at least three years, is entitled to a vote, provided (1)
that he resides in an electoral district; or (2) owns lands or
tenements of the clear value of £5O, or of the clear yearly
value of £5 ; or (3) is upon the roll of ratepaying electors.
Ratepayers are enrolled as electors for the district in which
their property is situated. Others must take out an elector’s
right by application to the registrars appointed for granting
them.
The qualifications for voting are so trifling that the
system may be pronounced to be one of universal suffrage.
The plan of voting is by ballot. During the former Ministry
of which the Hon. Graham Berry was Chief Secretary,
the members of Parliament were paid the sum of £3OO per
annum, professedly as a reimbursement of expenses incurred
in attending to their legislative duties. This provision
is not, however, part of the Constitution Act, and may
therefore, at any time be withdrawn or continued. Impor-
tant changes in the constitution of the Legislative Council
have for some considerable time been under consideration, but
as yet no definite measure has been finally determined on.
While it is to be acknowledged that among our legislators
there are men of patriotic spirit, administrative ability, and
statesman-like speech, it is matter of regret that the tone of
the Legislative Assembly has not of late been such as could
have been desired. Party spirit has frequently run high, and
honourable members have indulged in language unbecoming
the calmness and dignity that should rule in the highest
deliberative body in the land. Not that Victoria is by any
means singular in this respect. Even the House of Commons
has occasionally its “scenes.” Probably, while human
nature remains what it is, there will always be found some
in the “ seats of honour” who at times fail to control
themselves, and can scarcely be controlled by others. At
the same time, it is greatly to be desired that the men who


make laws to govern the community should maintain in
themselves the spirit of self-control, and in all their dis-
cussions and debates exhibit towards each other that gentle-
manliness of demeanour, and courteousness of language
which will command the respect and esteem of the people.
A mighty influence for good would then go forth from our
august Legislative Chambers. But, otherwise, what is to
be hoped for ? If disorder prevail in high places, need we
wonder that rowdyism should reign in our streets. In this
respect, at least, the upper and under currents will not flow
in opposite directions.
CHAPTER XXVI.
RELIGION AND OUR CHURCHES.
Victoria has been from the first a Christian colony. Its
founders brought with them the religion of their childhood
and of their fathers, and have laid the foundations of it deep
and strong in the new land. In this they have acted wisely
and well. It has been said truly, that the Bible is the
secret and source of England’s greatness, and if another, and
perchance a greater England is to be built up under sunnier
skies in this Southern Hemisphere, religion must constitute
the main strength and stay of the growing empire. There
is no truth of deeper import than what is expressed in the
following sentiment taken from a recent leading article in
the columns of the Argus newspaper : —“ Apart from the
fact that in Jesus of Nazareth myriads of the human
family have found personal comfort and strength, hope in
the darkest hour of trial, and consolation in the time of
nature’s direst extremity, nearly everything that is
valuable in our social relations is due to the influence His
life and teachings have exercised upon our race.”
The 53rd clause in the Constitution Act provided, that
with a view to the advancement of the Christian religion in
the colony, the sum of £50,000 should be set apart annually
by the Government from the general revenue to aid in the
maintenance of ministers of religion, and the erection of
buildings for public worship, and that the apportionment of
said sum to each denomination should be made according to
the number of its members at the preceding census. This

grant was simply a free gift to such denominations as
chose to accept it, but did not in any wise involve the right
on the part of the State to interfere in the administration of
the internal affairs of the Church. The provision was repealed
by an Act of the Legislature of the colony, which received
the Royal Assent on the 6th January, 1871, and which
took effect on and after the 31st December, 1875. Since
then, no State assistance to the churches has been given.
The most perfect religious liberty and equality exist in
the colony. There being no church established by law, the
State knows no one denomination more than another, but
accords its protection alike to the rights of all. Every man
has the fullest freedom to worship Cod according to his own
conscience, without any civil disability attaching thereto.
An important work has already been done in planting
congregations, building churches, and organising religious
agencies. Accommodation has been provided for 420,051
worshippers, or about one-half of the entire population.
According to the latest statistics, the Church of England
has 485 places of worship with 161 ministers, the Presby-
terian Church 677 places with 156 ministers, the Wesleyan
Church* 828 places with 140 ministers, the Roman Catholic
Church 454 places with 94 priests, the Independent Church
93 places with 48 ministers, the Baptist Church 78 places
with 40 ministers, the Bible Christians 101 with 16 ministers.
In addition to these there are the Evangelical Lutheran
Church, the Welsh Calvinists, the Church of Christ, the
Jews, and other sects not named, with about 100 churches
among them, and 48 ministers. The number of religious
services held by the various churches during the year are
set down approximately at 226,343,
In the department of Sabbath school work a praiseworthy
activity prevails throughout the colony. The Wesleyans
have 489 schools with 4,920 teachers and 31,524 scholars,
the Presbyterians 326 schools with 2,642 teachers and
27,046 scholars, the Church of England 295 schools with
2,550 teachers and 21,913 scholars, the Roman Catholics
229 schools with 1,146 teachers and 18,114 scholars, the
*This designation includes the various offshoots of the Wesleyan Church. From
another source we learn the United Free Methodists have 33 churches, the Primitive
Methodists 13, and several missions; also that there are the Catholic Apostolic
Church, the Unitarian Church, the Society of Friends, the New Church, and the
Christian Brethren.
F
65
Our Colony in 1880.


Independents 59 schools with 790 teachers and 5,873
scholars, the Baptists 52 schools with 478 teachers and
5,388 scholars. The smaller denominations already
enumerated have also their fair proportion of schools. The
average number of scholars in attendance at the Sabbath
schools of the colony is set down as 116,142.
It is worthy of note that little or no religious animosity
deserving the name has yet been awoke in the community, i
Any rivalry apparent among the sects is more of a harmless 1
and stimulating nature than provocative of rancour and \
battle. Of controversy between them in the matter of their
respective and characteristic teachings, there is a total lack, ;
but whether conducive to progress or otherwise, we do not j
take it xxpon us to say.
That the Christian religion is a great power for good in ;
the colony, no unprejudiced observer will deny. The evi- j
dences of this are ample and varied. The churches of all
denominations are, generally speaking, attended by good '
congregations. Ordinances are sustained by the voluntary
offerings of the people. Clergymen, as a rule, are fairly re- \
munerated, and in some instances munificently so. Evan-
gelistic work among those who have lapsed into 'carelessness i
and godlessness is prosecuted with self-denial and endurance,
and in many instances by gratuitous labour. The Church,
by the employment of suitable missionaries, is seeking to '
enlighten the Chinese and the Aborigines with the view of
gathering them into the Christian fold. All the great in-
stitutions of philanthropy, such as hospitals, asylums, ;
reformatories, and refuges, are indebted largely to the ad-
herents of the church for their maintenance. Not only ;
sympathy, but its practical exhibition in prompt and gen-
erous aid in cases of misfortune and calamity is readily
called forth by any humane and Christian appeal. Numerous
reformatory agencies are being vigorously prosecuted for the
reclamation of the erring and the fallen. Noble bands of
men and women are devoting themselves to the religious
instruction and godly upbringing of the young in the Sabbath
schools. Christian conferences on questions of vital im-
portance to spiritual life are held frequently and command
a large amount of attention. Young men’s Christian
associations abound, and display no small activity. The
Bible has its place in nearly every dwelling. The Sabbath


is probably as well kept as in any other Christian country.
Nor is the church, though engrossed with the work of exten-
sion and consolidation within its own immediate territory,
forgetful of those who are without “ the light of life” in
heathen lands. Missionaries are sent forth and sustained
by it in various islands of the southern seas, where as yet
“ the darkness that may be felt ” reigns. This is the out-
come of the benign faith of Christianity, and must be
admitted to furnish convincing evidence that religion is a
reality in the colony, and that it is putting forth an immense
power for good among the people. Anyone who in the face
of it can aver that “ the old religion is dying out,” is simply
not to be reasoned with.
At the same time, fidelity to truth requires us to state
that there is a back-ground to this picture. And it is to be
regretted that it is not only not in harmony with it, but
presents a somewhat severe contrast. It may be indeed that
it is just what is to be met with in greater or lesser promi-
nence in all Christian communities. Frivolity, extravagance,
mammon-worship, dissipation, squalor, and irreligion, are
all influential factors in the morale of Victorian society.
Within the pale of the professedly Christian portion of it,
there is room for improvement. The spirit of worldliness
has crept in and extensively prevails. The gifts that are
laid upon the altar for the evangelization of those that are
without, and the diffusion of “ the truth that saves ” in the
abodes of heathenism, are not on a scale of commensurate
liberality. Especially is this apparent when we take into
consideration the luxurious style of living which prevails
and the lavish munificence which is displayed in supporting
those places and institutions whose principal object is to
cater for the entertainment and amusement of the people.
There is a lack of that spiritual vitality which makes pro-
fessing Christians “ living sacrifices ” in the sublime under-
taking of saving a world, and churches centres of mightiest
and holiest influences in the regeneration of society. A mere
negative theology, with its moral and spiritual inertia, has
here and there found favor in the religious community.
Outspoken infidelity is no strange thing in our midst.
Masses of the people in the centres of population are
living outside of all Christian influences. In the far inland
and thinly populated districts there are numbers who seldom


if ever hear the good news of salvation proclaimed. But,
while this is true, it is probably just what in present cir-
cumstances is to be expected. There is no reason why any
one should sit down and bewail it with unavailing lamenta-
tions. It is better, surely, that Christian men and women
should be thankful for what has already been accomplished
and is being done now, under the blessing of God ; and that,
drinking more deeply into the Master’s spirit, and drawing
closer the bonds of a common brotherhood, and breathing a
diviner charity, they should go forward in the work of
society’s regeneration,
“With all their banners bravely held,
And all their armour flashing high.”
for the world knows no grander undertaking, and never in
any struggle was ultimate triumph so sure.
CHAPTER XXVII.
EDUCATION AND OUR SCHOOLS.
The advantages of education meet with universal recogni-
tion in the colony. A great deal has already been done
with the view of securing their realisation. Well-organised
schools are plentiful, and have been brought within reach
of nearly every small cluster of families. The promptitude
and liberality which have been displayed in providing the
means and opportunities of education for even remote and
sparsely populated districts deserve honourable mention.
The present system of public instruction is under the
control of the Government, and is regulated by an Act of
the Legislature, which came into operation on the Ist of
January, 1873, and w r as supplemented by a short Amending
Act in 1876.
These Acts, among other things, provide as follows: —
That secular instruction only shall be given by the
teachers in State-school buildings. That four hours at
least shall be occupied during each school day in the imparta-
tion of such instruction —two before noon and two after
noon, these being in each case consecutive. That children
of not less than six, nor more than fifteen years, shall be
required, unless there is some reasonable excuse, such as
illness, distance, or instx-uction received elsewhere, to attend


school for a period of thirty school days during each quarter.
That the parent of any child who neglects to send such
child to school may he summoned by any properly
authorised person before a justice, and on conviction of such
offence may be subjected to a fine not exceeding five shillings
for a first offence, and twenty shillings for every succeeding
offence, or in default to imprisonment for a term not ex-
ceeding seven days. That all children attending school
shall receive free instruction in reading, writing, arithmetic,
grammar, geography, drill, and needlework (for girls),
while for instruction in other and higher branches, fees are
chargeable on a prescribed scale. That no child shall
cease attending school till he or she has obtained a certificate
from an inspector of schools, certifying to his or her educa-
tion up to the standard required, viz. : ability to read any
ordinary printed matter fluently, to write neatly from dicta-
tion with correct spelling, and to work sums in arithmetic
up to the four compound rules, including reduction. That
the Government build the schools, and appoint and pay the
teachers. That Boards of Advice be constituted to assist
in the management of the schools, said boards to be elected
by the ratepayers, to hold office for three years, and to per-
form their work as honorary service.
From the summary now given of leading provisions of
the Act, it will be seen that the present educational system
possesses three distinguishing features. Ist. It is secular.
Religious instruction is prohibited during the prescribed
school hours. 2nd. It is free. No fee is charged for the
ordinary branches of an English education, and all who
choose may avail themselves of it. 3rd. It is compulsory.
Children within certain school ages are required to attend
the State schools unless it can be shown that they are
being properly taught elsewhere. All must be educated up
to a certain standard.
Since the present Act came into operation, seven years
ago, the day schools in connection with the State have in-
creased by 408, and the number of children enrolled by
79,393. The night schools have increased by 207, and the
pupils enrolled by 15,721. The number of schools at the
date of last returns was 1,664, with 231,169 on the rolls, and
an average attendance of 116,608, and a staff of 3,906 in-
structors. The attendance during the year shows a higher


average than that of any preceding year, the increase being
per cent, on the attendance of 1877, The ages of the
children in the State schools were :—Under 6 years, 25,432 ;
from 6 to 15 years, 149,585 ; 15 years and upwards,
14,438. The instruction of each child in average attendance
during the year, in the day schools, cost £3 15s. lid., and
in the night schools, £\ 12s. 2|d. There are 40 persons in
the possession of State school exhibitions, and who are
prosecuting their studies at the higher schools and colleges,
or at the University. New schoolhouses to the number of
154, providing accommodation for 15,193 children, were
completed during the year, and, in addition, 13 schoolhouses
were enlarged to the extent of accommodation for 1,668
children. The expenditure for the year amounted to
£594,147, being a decrease, as compared with the previous
year, of £83,171, nearly all of which was on school buildings,
and which, it may be expected, will further lessen from year
to year.
In addition to the State schools, there were 686 private
schools in operation during the year, with an aggregate of
scholars on the roll of 40,462. Notwithstanding the intro-
duction of free education in connection with the State
system, the number of scholars in attendance on the private
schools shows an increase of nearly 13,000 as compared with
what it was at the time when the present Act came into
operation. Of private schools there were 190 in operation
during the year in connection with the Homan Catholic
Church, with 583 teachers and 24,934 scholars; 62 in con-
nection with the Church of England, with 242 teachers and
2,055 scholars; only a few in connection with the other
denominations, and 320 not stated to be connected with any
denomination, with 795 teachers and 9,012 scholars.
In favor of the working of the State school system thus
far, a good deal may be said. The blessings of education
have been brought within the reach of all. Commodious,
well-appointed, and in numerous instances, elegant schools
have been erected all over the populated districts of the
colony. The teachers are thoroughly qualified and fairly
remunerated. The instruction given, is, so far as it goes,
of excellent character and quality. Through the appoint-
ment of truant officers, careless parents are being compelled
to do their duty. The result of seven years’ trial is, that it


has given a fair amount of satisfaction to the general com-
munity, and there is an expressed desire that it should con-
tinue as it is.
On the other hand, it is to be admitted that there are
considerable sections of the community who take objections
to it. The expense at which it is maintained is held to be
far too lavish for such a young colony. It is feared by
some that the large numbers of children that are congre-
gated in many of the schools is an unwise arrangement, and
that drawing together as they naturally do in considerable
groups in the streets and by the waysides,, they become ex-
posed to demoralizing influences. Exception is taken to the
system of tuition, as being too formal or mechanical in its
character, whereby, in many instances, there is a lack of that
vitality, freedom, and enthusiasm which should animate
the teacher, and a good deal of mere cramming and conse-
quent deficiency of intellectual expansion on the part of the
pupil. In one respect at least it has as yet failed. When
the system was under discussion prior to its establishment,
one cogent plea put forth on its behalf was, that it would
reach the neglected classes commonly called “the gutter
children.” This, however, it has hitherto failed to accom-
plish, and either its administration must be amended, or
fresh legislation must be obtained, if this most desirable end
is to be secured.
It is too early, probably, to pass a decided judgment on
the influence which the system is exercising in the develop-
ment and formation of character. Some are of opinion that
it will prove defective in this respect, through the absence of
the religious element. An effort has been made by ministers
of various denominations to supplement this lack of religious
teaching by meeting with those children who were willing
to remain after school hours, and imparting to them scrip-
tural lessons. The effort cannot be said to be successful.
Taking into consideration the fact that the children can only
be taught thus in the mass, that many of them must be
eager to get to their homes or their play, and that ministers
generally speaking are tasked to the utmost of their time
and energy with their own special work, it is not to be
wondered at that this laudable effort has to a large extent
proved a failure. It is now generally conceded that it im-
plies an unnatural demand, alike on the part of the ministers


and children, and being unnatural, its successful continuance
is likely to prove impracticable.
The secular character of the Act has of late become a
battle-ground on which no small strife rages. Tixe secularist
is, of course, satisfied with the Act as it is, and demands
that no finger shall be laid upon it. A section of the re-
ligious community, principally those who hold that it is
incompetent for the State to teach religion in any shape or
form, fall in with the secularists. Others hold that religious
instruction should be given to the children after school hours
by voluntary service on the part of ministers of the gospel,
or, should this be unattainable, by a body of men salaried
by the churches for doing the work. A third party, com-
prising a large proportion of the three leading Protestant
denominations—the Church of England, the Presbyterian,
and the Wesleyan—hold and maintain that scriptural
lessons ought to be introduced into the daily work of the
school. And a fourth party, the Roman Catholic, with
perhaps a few exceptions, hold, not only that there can be
no true education unless religion form a part of it, but that
religion, as they understand it, can only be imparted to their
children by teachers of their own faith and under the super-
vision of their own church, and therefore demand that they
should have control of their own schools, and that either a
separate grant proportioned to their number should be made
to them with a view to this end, or that payment by results,
under Government inspection, should be made to their
schools. What the outcome of this struggle will be, the
future alone can show. At the same time it seems not im-
probable that the Act, ere long, may undergo some modifi-
cations, and that scriptural instruction in some shape or
form may find a place in the daily routine of the State
schools. Meanwhile, as one good result of the discussion
which is going on, the necessity of increased activity in con-
nection with the work of Sabbath schools has been forced
on the attention of the churches, and it is to be hoped that
through this instrumentality, the lack of religious
instruction in the State schools may be to some extent com-
pensated for.

CHAPTER XXVIII.
THE HIGHER EDUCATION.
The Melbourne University was established in January,
1853. It has an annual endowment of £9,000, pay-
able out of the general revenue. It has a Council
of 20 members, with a chancellor and vice-chancellor,
elected by them from their own number; also a
Senate, presided over by a warden. A University hall, to
be called the “ Wilson Hall,” so named in consequence of
the munificent gift of £30,000 towards it by the Honoimable
Sir Samuel Wilson, M.L.C., is at present in course of erec-
tion. Its stjde is that of the perpendicular Gothic, its length
140 ft., its breadth 47ft., its walls 45ft. in height, and the
apex of its roof 84ft. high. Its cost will exceed £40,000,
but towards this, in addition to the £30,000 already men-
tioned, there is £7,000 of accrued interest thereon since
the gift was bestowed. Since the University was opened,
1,213 students have matriculated. The matriculations last
year amounted to 114, as against 103 of the previous year.
The income amounted to £18,136, and the expenditure to
£15,293. The subjects taught embrace mathematics, classics,
logic, history, natural science, chemistry, law, anatomy, me-
dicine, engineering, and branches of law and mining ; and
the professors are men of ability and reputation.
In connexion with the University grounds, sites have
been reserved for the erection of affiliated Colleges by the
leading religious denominations. Trinity College has been
erected by the Church of England ; and Ormond College,
named after Francis Ormond, Esq., who has contributed
towards it the munificent sum of £12,500, is in course of erec-
tion, and will be opened in November of the current year.
In the department of Education there is a Training Insti-
tution, with Associated Training Schools for teachers, in
which during the first six months of last year there were 156
teachers in training, 90 of whom were in the associated
schools, and 66 in the central institution.
The Melbourne Grammar School, connected with the
Church of England, has 10 masters and 226 pupils ; the
Scotch College, in connection with the Presbyterian Church,
has 12 masters ancl 342 pupils j Wesley College, in con


nection with the Wesleyan Church, has 11 masters and
216 scholars ; St. Patrick’s College, in connection with the
Roman Catholic Church, has 7 masters and 75 scholars.
There are various exhibitions in connection with these col-
leges, averaging from <£2l up to <£lo, and tenable for one
or more years. In addition to the colleges enumerated, and
all of which are in Melbourne and suburbs, there is a
Presbyterian College, and also a Church of England
Grammar School at Geelong, a Roman Catholic College at
Kew, two colleges at Ballarat (the Grenville and the
Scotch), two colleges at Hamilton, one of which (the
Alexandra) is for ladies ; and a High School at Sandhurst.
There is also a Ladies’ College at Melbourne, in connection
with the Presbyterian Church. In addition to these, there
are numerous private grammar schools in the colony,
some of which have a large attendance of pupils, and
are conducted with distinguished ability.
Schools of Mines and Industries have been established at
Sandhurst and Ballarat. Mathematics, mechanics, mining,,
geology, mineralogy, chemistry, metallurgy, surveying,
architectural drawing, and other useful branches are taught.
Competent lecturers are provided ; and laboratories, with
suitable apparatus, museums, and libraries are attached to
the schools. Schools of design have been established at
20 places in the colony for the promotion of technological
and industrial instruction. The number of pupils on the
rolls at our latest dates was 1,671. Exhibitions of the works,
of the pupils are held in Melbourne and other localities.
CHAPTER XXIX.
THE PRESS AND OUR LITERATURE.
Not the least interesting or remarkable history which our
colony furnishes is the history of the Press. Considering
the ardour with which men have been pursuing material
interests, it is matter of agreeable surprise, if not of
wonder, that it has exhibited such rapid development through-
out the colony. It is but forty-two years since John P.
Fawkner, with the help of an old printing-press and a few
types, gave to the then little world of Melbourne its first
newspaper, the Melbourne Advertiser, the first nine numbers
74
Our Colony in 1880.


of which were issued in manuscript. From that small seed
of Victorian literature there has sprung within the limits of
little more than a generation a goodly tree, whose branches
have out-spread themselves till they have filled the land.
Melbourne has four daily papers, the Argus, the Age, the
Telegraph and the Herald. Three of these lay upon our tables
every morning London telegrams with the news of the
world. To say that they are conducted with distinguished
ability is but the simple truth. In spirit, in the intellectual
power displayed in their leading articles, in the variety and
careful compilation of their intelligence columns, in their
material and workmanship, they take rank successfully with
the dailies of the leading cities of the home country. Of
weekly issues of general newspapers there are the Austral-
asian, the Leader, the Weekly Times, Punch, Saturday
Night , the Advocate, the Spectator, and the Southern Gross.
The Advocate is the organ of the Roman Catholics, and the
Spectator is the organ of the Wesleyan Church. The
Southern Cross is a religious paper, non-political, and un-
denominational. There are two illustrated papers, the Austra-
lian News (monthly) and the Sketcher (fortnightly). The
principal suburbs of the city have also their local papers.
Ballarat has its three daily papers—the Ballarat Star,
Courier, and Evening Post; and also a weekly, the Miner.
Geelong has its three dailies and a weekly—the Geelong
Advertiser, Geelong Times, and Evening Star, and the News
of the Week. Sandhurst has its three dailies—the Bendigo
Advertiser, Independent, and Evening News. Several other
towns, such asCastlemaineand Stawell, have their daily papers;
others again have their tri-weekly or bi-weekly issues; while
there is scarcely a district with a population of a few hundreds
but what possesses its local weekly paper. Some of the Ballarat
and other daily papers which we have named suffer no
discredit by comparison with their metropolitan compeers;
and of the weeklies and others—which we would gladly
catalogue so far as they are known to us, were it not that
our space is too limited to admit of our doing so—we may
safely say that, generally speaking, they are most readable
productions, exhibiting a variety and comprehensiveness in
the mental pabulum which they give to the public, and a
spirit and talent in “ editorials ” which are most creditable
to our young communities, and which enable them to com-
75

pare favourably with the country newspapers of England
and America.
Recently an effort was made to establish a serial literature
of a higher and more substantial character than what is
furnished in the cheap and popular magazines. It seemed
as though the field were altogether too limited for such an
enterprise. A fair amount of success appears, however, to
have crowned it. Three Reviews, the Melbourne, the
Victorian, and the Imperial are now issued. Many of the
contributions are from able and experienced pens; the
subjects discussed are extensive and varied in range and
character ; the “ burning questions ” of the day come in for
a fair share of ventilation and debate ; and occasionally a
license is allowed, in the expression of opinions antagonistic
to established and venerated beliefs, which jars somewhat
harshly on the religious sentiment of the community.
The leading ecclesiastical bodies contribute their quota to
the religious literature of the times. As we have already
seen, the Roman Catholics and W esleyans have their weekly
papers. The Church of England Messenger, as its name indi-
cates, is the organ of the Episcopalians, The Presbyterian
Review, which has been issued for many years in the interests
of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria, recently ceased to
appear, and a new journal is announced as its successor,
under the title of The Monthly Messenger and Missionary
Record of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria. The
Congregationalists have their Independent, the Baptists their
Freeman, and the Jews their Herald. In addition to these
denominational issues may be named the Australian Medical
Journal, the Australian Journal, the Australian Jurist, the
Banking Record, the Temperance News, the Schoolmaster,
the Australasian Trade Review, the Harbinger of Light,
Bradshaw's Guide, and the A. B. G. Travellers' Railway
and Road Guide. There are still some others, with the
correct titles of which we are not acquainted.
The Government issues a Gazette, and a Hansard con-
taining the parliamentary debates. Several works of a
national character and of high excellence have also been issued
by it from time to time.
Important service has likewise been rendered to the cause
of knowledge and literature in the publication of books by
the Victorian press. Works in the departments of medical

science, political economy, and natural history; essays in
general literature; treatises on theology; biographies; novels,
tales and sketches ; translations from the classics; books of
travel and geography; collections of original poetry ; school
books, and others, have all been issued as the product of
colonial pens, and have met with more or less favour at the
hands of the public. To enumerate either the titles of the
works referred to or the names of the authors would require
a great deal more space than we can command. Colonial
authors have much to contend with in the rapidity and
abundance with which the riches of European and American
literature are poured into our bookshops and libraries, but a
creditable beginning has been made, and, no doubt, in pro-
cess of time the colonies will have a literature peculiarly
their own.
The influence exercised by the press of the colony is admit-
tedly great. The newspaper especially goes into almost every
household. Probably in many cases it is the only literature
of the family. Its pages are eagerly scanned, and its para-
graphs furnish the most popular themes of conversation.
It has its infirmities—like everything human—in the shape
of language occasionally too strong to be commendable, and
party .bias too pronounced to be useful, but its general
tone and influence is for good. If, now and again, or here
and there, expression be given to opinions which grate
somewhat harshly on the ears of the Christian portion of the
community, it is to be borne in mind that while society is
constituted as it is, this is just what may be expected, and
that in this respect we are no worse possibly than other
civilized and Christian lands. If the religious section of
society were alive to the real importance of the press, and
prepared to make a proper use of it, even this, to a large ex-
tent, might be prevented. It is reason for thankfulness that
throughout the colony, with rare exceptions, its attitude to
Christianity is that of respectful deference, even when not of
cordial advocacy. In the department of morals, it renders
valuable service. Meanness and hypocrisy are exposed.
Injustice and wrong-doing receive their meed of condemna-
tion. Bribery and corruption, even in high places, are
not spared. The poor man gets a prompt hearing of his
cause. Instances of manliness, bravery and patriotism
meet with ready and warm acknowledgment. It is ever


prompt in calling forth the sympathy and generosity of the
public on behalf of cases of special distress and suffering.
The grand questions of education, freedom, progress, brother-
hood, and charity meet with eloquent exposition and advocacy
at its hands. Thankful for the past, we are hopeful of the
future. As one function of the press is to gather up the
opinions that are floating in society on all sides and mirror
them to the public gaze, we believe that, just as Christianity
more extensively and effectually permeates the community
with its elevating influences, even so will the press generally
charge itself with a more direct and special advocacy of a
faith that alone can sweeten the bitternesses of life, make
society contented, happy and prosperous, and give develop-
ment, stability and honorable position to a growing empire.
Meanwhile it is doing good service in seeking to inspire the
young with the spirit of manliness and patriotism, in fight-
ing the battles of true freedom, in purifying the streams of
business and social intercourse, and in fostering a healthful
political life in the community.
CHAPTER XXX.
RECREATION AND AMUSEMENT.
A recent visitor to our shores writes thus:—“ The
Australians are perhaps the most sport-loving people in
existence.” He goes on to say that the result of a cricket-
match played by our champions in England awakens a
wider and profounder interest than the deliberations of a
European Congress, on which perchance the fate of a people
may hang. He remarks that cricket, football, and athletic
sports generally are elevated to the position of fine arts, and
he fears that they are prosecuted “ with a good deal more
devotion than are painting, sculpture or literature.”
It will probably be admitted by the candid onlooker that
there is too much truth in these remarks on our national
proclivities. Pastime and play certainly enter largely into
the progi'amme of every-day life. So far, all this is well.
No man of ordinary intelligence will fail to admit that
relaxation and diversion are indispensable in order to the
maintenance alike of mental vigour and physical elasticity
and strength. Without them the wheels of life get clogged,


the mind sinks into a rut of one-sided ideas and morbid
sentiment, and a nightmare of irksomeness and ennui
settles down on the existence. At the same time there is
“ a golden mean.” There may be too much of even a good
thing. A dignitary of the Church has recently been lifting
a warning voice on this point. He thinks that a large
portion of the young men of the colony are too much given
to play. Of this, mere idling is the result. Then comes a
step lower, and that is crime. It is to be feared that not a
few aimless lives among our young men are traceable to
this source. It is to be hoped that the leaders and guardians
of our youth will study a wise adjustment between the
respective claims of study and play, business and recreation.
While it is proper that the mind should frequently unbend
from severe thought lest the strain upon it should become
too great, and that the physical powers should be exercised
amid the exhilarating influences of air and sunshine, in
order to their development and in vigor ation, it is no less
proper, but indeed more so, that the graver and grander
aspects of existence should not be lost sight of by the young,
that some truly noble life-purpose should be awoke in them,
and that supreme questions of duty and moral endeavour
should receive their commensurate portion of time and
energy.
The penchant of the Victorians for horse-racing is well
known. The standing plea for it is that it improves the
breed of horses. The Flemington Course, which is situated
some three miles from the city, has been laid out with great
care, and we understand that as much as close on <£6ooo
has been expended on improvements in connection, with it in
a single year. Its grand stand is regarded as being very
fine. The red-letter day is that of the Melbourne Cup. It
is computed that as many as 80,000 people have thronged
the grounds on that occasion. Melbourne is never so full
as at that time. Visitors come from all parts of the country,
and in considerable numbers from the neighbouring colonies.
The city seems as though it literally emptied itself, as the
endless lines of carriages and the vast tide of human beings
hurry on to the rendezvous. The scene is reported to be
unique and imposing, a galaxy of wealth, fashion, and
beauty, such as cannot be seen elsewhere in the colonies,
and which, perhaps, is scarcely out-rivalled in Europe. It


is not to be supposed, however, that no protest goes forth
against it. There are many who, on conscientious grounds,
record their disapproval of it. It is no part, however, of
our present purpose to discuss the morale of the question;
we are simply chronicling facts. At the same time, we may
say that it is well known, and ought to be deeply regretted,
that betting and swindling enter very largely into the order
of the day. This is one of the dark sides of the picture.
Many a home is desolated and many a heart made sick and
sore as the result of Melbourne Cup day.
Next to this, as a public recreation and amusement, comes
Cricket. In Melbourne, and all its suburbs, numerous
reserves have been enclosed for this popular game, some of
which are beautifully laid out and carefully kept. The
grounds of the Melbourne Cricket Club, with their grand-
stand, are said to be scarcely surpassed in excellence any-
where. Immense crowds of people congregate in them on
the occasion of important matches. Colleges, townships,
business-houses, and schools have their cricket clubs. What
was written in reference to the game on the occasion of a re-
vival of it more than a century ago in England, may be quoted
of it now : “ Gentlemen fell to batting and bowling as if for
life or death. The game was taken upon all sides. It was
one equally adapted for poor and rich ; better still, it was
one in which rich and poor could share. All over the
land the old game, never very popular before, came into
vogue, and reigned supreme.” The improved locomotion of
our day has given a wonderful impetus to the game.
Instead of a county eleven of England travelling some
twenty or thirty miles in their own caravan to try their skill
with some neighbouring club, as was the case in former
days; through the railway and the steamer the broadest
seas and continents are crossed, and the most celebrated
amateur and professional players in England, America, and
Australia meet on their respective soils, and engage in
contests which draw upon them the eyes of the world.
How worthily “ our boys ” have comported themselves on
English soil, and with what “ flying colours ” they have
come off from many a field, is a well known household tale.
The game of Football, which by common consent is some-
what rough in its character and is the source of not
unfrequent accidents, is played during the winter months.

Such popularity attaches to it that it is no uncommon sight to
see many thousands of people assembled to witness a match
between leading clubs. The rules observed in the game are
those of the Victorian Football Association. La Crosse, a
game of Indian origin, and which is now the national game of
the “New Dominion,” is also played. The name is derived
from the implement used in it, which is a long stick,
generally made of hickory, one end terminating in an
ornamental curve like a crosse, or bishop’s crozier, with a
piece of stout net-work in which the ball is caught, and
with which it is struck or thrown.
Boating and yachting; bowling, bicycling, croquet and
lawn-tennis; gymnastics and other recreative amusements
have all their share of popularity. Coursing for hares has
been common of late years. The Melbourne hunt has also
its regular “meet” during the winter months. Lovers of
the gun and rod are numerous, and find scope for the gratifi-
cation of their taste. Public holidays are frequent, and
on these occasions every available spot for miles around
Melbourne seems to be occupied with well-dressed and well-
provisioned pic-nic parties, and innocent fun and frolic are
the order of the day. Nor is there any lack of in-door
amusement. The Waxworks, the concert rooms, and the
theatres are largely patronised; the two latter, it is to be
feared, rather much so for the comfort of many a home and
for the morals of the general community. If athletic
games and gymnastic exercises give agility, strength, and
endurance to the human form, and enable men to make the
best of their intellectual powers, then surely “ the coming
race” in Victoria may be expected to prove no mean one
either in mental or physical prowess.
CHAPTER XXXI.
OUR CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS.
A glance at our leading charitable institutions will be useful
in showing to what extent the spirit of philanthropy lives
and operates among the people. It will be encouraging to
find that amid the levity, pleasure-seeking, and worldliness
that so extensively prevail in society, the great heart of our
common humanity beats soundly, and the infirmities, mis-

fortunes, and manifold sorrows that fall to the lot of not a
few, readily call forth a genuine sympathy, and a prompt
and generous helping hand. The following table exhibits
the more important items of information pertaining to such
institutions :
The general hospitals are conducted after the most ap-
proved style. The Melbourne Hospital will, we believe,
compare favourably with the hospitals of almost any city
in the world. The average cost of each inmate for the year
was £55.
In the Blind Asylum various industrial occupations are
taught. Ten of the inmates recently discharged are re-
ported to be now maintaining themselves by their own
work. During the year the sum of £892 was realised for
basketware, brushware, nets, and mats manufactured in the
institution.
The inmates of the Victorian Deaf and Dumb Institution
are also instructed in various profitable industries. Samples
of boots and shoes made by the apprentices, and forwarded
to the Paris Exhibition, were awarded a bronze medal, and
three of the female inmates obtained first-class certificates


for needle and fancy work at the Juvenile Exhibition of
Ballarat.
A system of boarding-out has been in operation in con-
nection with the Industrial schools for some time. Children,
from the time they are weaned up to the time when they
are able to earn their own living, are committed to the care
of foster-parents, who are paid by the Government five
shillings per week for each child. The welfare of such chil-
dren is looked after by honorary committees who make re-
ports to the Department.
Out of the various female refuges seven inmates were
married during the year, and 216 were either restored to
friends or placed in situations.
Besides the public charitable institutions which have been
enumerated, and which are partly supported by the Govern-
ment, there are various others which properly come under
the designation, the most of which receive no regular Gov-
ernment subsidies.
There is an Inebriate Retreat, into which forty patients
were received during the year, and from which thirty-nine
were discharged.
Thirty-seven societies, whose object is the relief of the
poor and sick in the community, furnished returns for the
year. Deserving cases to the number of 9,568 were dealt
with and assisted, and the total expenditure amounted to
£13,201.
Thirty-four friendly societies were reported, with a mem-
bership of 45,661 and an income of £161,880.
In addition to these, may be mentioned the Melbourne
Sailors’ Home, the Melbourne Home and Governesses’ In-
stitute, and various free dispensaries.
CHAPTER XXXII.
OUR CLIMATE.
The climate of Victoria is acknowledged to be good.
Taken as a whole it is probably one of the finest in the
world. Like everything mundane it has of course its draw-
backs. The dust-storm which occasionally occurs is not
pleasant. The hot-wind, with the thermometer standing at
83
Our Colony in 1880.


100°, oi’ it may be on an exceptionally trying day at 110° in
the shade, is certainly exhausting. But the former is soon
over, and the latter generally terminates the second day,
often indeed the first, by a change of wind, which brings
with it a delicious and refreshing coolness. The Victorian
who has spent a summer in England will probably aver
that he has met with days as exhausting as the hot
days of this colony. The explanation may be that while
the heat in Victoria is a dry stimulating heat, that of
England is moist and depressing. There are many days
during the year which are exquisite in their loveliness, when
only a few snowy-looking clouds hang about the horizon,
and the sky is brightly blue, and soft breezes breathe a
delicious freshness, and the sun floods land and sea with
beauty—days which once experienced will live in the
memory like a vision of brightness, though a man should
wander in other and far-off lands.
The seasons are, of course, reversed as compared with the
northern hemisphere. Spring comes in with September.
During the day the atmosphere is mild, the sun showing
considerable power, while the evenings are often chilly.
Frequent showers may be looked for this month. During
the following month the first touch of the hot-wind may be
expected. December, January, and February are counted
the summer months. The greatest heat occurs towards the
end of January, or the beginning of February. The grass
being withered and parched, bush-fires occur most fre-
quently at this time. With March the autumn season sets
in, and June inaugurates the Victorian winter. July is the
coldest month, the mean temperature being 48°. Though
in the higher altitudes a little frost and ice may frequently
be seen, and snow may cover the mountain ranges, in
Melbourne the temperature seldom falls below freezing point,
and any crust of ice that is formed quickly disappears before
the morning sun. With the exception of the. occasional
very hot days in summer, which are certainly severe
to many constitutions, the seasons are admitted to be very
beautiful. Spring, winter and autumn are probably not
surpassed in any climate, a large portion of the days being
cloudless, the sun’s rays pleasantly warm, yet tempered with
cool and refreshing breezes. The suddenness of the atmos-
pheric changes is felt by some to be trying, but a little care


in the matter of suitable clothing, in the case of people
generally, may obviate any unpleasant effects from this
source. Droughts have hitherto been of periodical occurrence,
and frequently disastrous to -the stock-holder ; but through
the sinking of wells and the storage of water, this in good
measure is being provided against. The following points
may be noted on the subject now under consideration :
Ist. The general conditions of a good climate are present.
The air is light, dry and exhilarating. There is
abundance of sunshine. The severity of northern winters,
the bitter east-winds and chilling fogs of England,
and the humid heats of India are absent. It would
be difficult to find anywhere in the world a climate
numbering a larger proportion of days throughout
the year during which out-door labour may be prosecuted,
and open-air sports engaged in without interruption. 2nd.
The statistics of mortality are favourable. In 1878 the
deaths per 1000 of the mean population amounted to 14.62.
Or if the mean of eleven years be taken it gives 15.25. The
mean of the same eleven years in England gives 22.1,
leaving the balance very largely in favour of Victoria.
3rd. As yet the colony has been free from those malignant
epidemics which constitute the more dreaded scourges of
humanity. We have heard of cases of typhus, but they
are isolated and rare. ' Asiatic Cholera, that occasionally
commits such ravages in Eastern Europe, and now and again
makes a swoop on England, has not visited us in epidemic
form. No plague with deadly breath has come to us on the
wings of the wind. Yellow-fever, that fatal pest that lurks
in the very air of Central and South American States, is
unknown. Probably the hot-wind, which in some respects
is disagreeable enough, may have the salutary mission
assigned to it of neutralising or absorbing the atmospheric
conditions on which the existence and propagation of these
maladies depend. There can be no doubt that it is
a scavenger in its way, and this may be one of the boons
it confers. 4th. The circumstances of the people have
in numerous instances been unfavourable to the health of
the community. The construction of dwellings characterised
by nothing so much as a rude simplicity and the absence
of every condition of comfort; an unnaturally fast style of
living; the toleration of nuisances in the neighbourhood of


teeming populations; bad water and bad food; defective
drainage in townships ; and a disregard of many of the
observances which are indispensable in order to the mainten-
ance of vigor of frame, have too extensively prevailed in the
past. That in these circumstances the general health of the
people should have been so good, speaks well for the
salubrity of our climate. sth. What has been said in favour
of the climate is substantiated by observation and experience.
Visitors amongst us speak favourably of the physical
development of our rising youth. To the ordinary observer
the average Victorian will not fail to display evidence
of vigorous health, as seen in a steady flow of good spirits,
manliness of frame, decision and promptitude of action, energy
in enterprise, and endurance in toil. The world knows pretty
well by this time what young Victoria can do in the
cricket-field—where the keen eye, the cool head, the lithe
movement and the athletic frame are prime factors in the
contest. England and America can alike bear witness to
their prowess.
There is one question in connection with climate which is
frequently asked, and which is invested with a special
interest to a numerous class in the home country. Is
Victoria, viewed climatically, entitled to be regarded as a
health-resort for persons suffering from pulmonary affections 1
It is to be regretted that we cannot answer this question with-
out admitting that conflicting opinions have been expressed
in reference to it. The frequent and rapid changes to which
our temperature is liable, the exhausting character of our
hot-winds and the dust-storms which occasionally prevail,
taken in connection with the previous discomforts of a
lengthened sea voyage and the depression of mind which
naturally overtakes an invalid under a sense of loneliness,
when in a land of strangers, far from the soothing ministra-
tions of home, are held to be adverse to the prospect of
recovery. There can be little doubt that a sense of friend-
lessness must prove, in many instances, a serious drawback.
On the other hand it is maintained that a lengthened sea
voyage, through genial latitudes, in a well appointed vessel,
and with medical comforts, is in itself, generally speaking,
advantageous ; while the soft, dry, warm temperature of
our atmosphere, and the cheering and exhilarating brightness
of our weather, especially in inland and upland districts,


such as are to be found in the region of the Murray, cannot
fail to prove, if anything will, of a beneficial character.
Apart from the medical question, on which we are not
competent to give an opinion, we may remark that a
general impression prevails in the public mind that the
climate is favourable to patients of the consumptive class.
There are comparatively few in the community who will not
tell us that within the range of their acquaintance there are
one or more of the class referred to, who have come to the
colony and been greatly improved in doing so. A medical
gentleman of standing and ability in the city of Edinburgh
informed the writer on the occasion of a recent visit to
Scotland, that whenever a young man in the incipient stage
of pulmonary disease came into his hands, he advised him to
lose no time in proceeding to Victoria ; that he had sent out
a considerable number during the last few years, and that
so far as his knowledge of the cases extended, he believed
that the experiment had been eminently successful. It too
often happens that consumptive patients struggle on for
years under medical treatment in the home country, and
only make up their minds to seek a milder climate when
every curative system and agent has failed, and the malady
has reached its hopeless stage ; and what in these circum-
stances can be expected, save that death may be awaiting
them either during the sea voyage or shortly their
arrival on a strange shore. In the interests of humanity
we feel constrained to say that any change to a milder
clime, that in such cases may be thought of, cannot be under-
taken too soon. To come early may prove most beneficial;
to come late is likely to prove a fruitless, it may be a cruel
policy. The earliest symptoms of the malady should be
regarded as the notes of a warning bell. Our climate then,
on the whole, must be pronounced to be healthful, exhilarat-
ing and enjoyable. Men of “ the wandering foot,” who
have inhaled the breezes on almost every shore, have given
it as their opinion that in its bearing on physical comforts
and mental activity and enjoyment, it approaches as near
to perfection as anything can be expected to do in a world
where imperfection has left its impress on everything.


CHAPTER XXXIII.
SOME PHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE COLONY.
V ictoria is divided into two unequal parts by an extensive
mountain range. This runs in an easterly and westerly
direction at about 60 miles from the sea-coast. The name it
receives is the Dividing Range, and it exercises an important
influence on the climate of the colony. To the north of it,
the heaviest rains come from the north ; to the south of it,
the heaviest come from the south. The principal rivers
have their source among its spurs, or in its bosom. Its
highest peak is about 7,000 feet above the sea-level. There
are other ranges, such as the Pyrenees, the Grampian, the
Dandenong, the Sierra, the Putter, &c., the highest peak of
which averages from 5,000 to over 6,000 feet. One feature
of some distinction is, the existence of what are called
Bald Hills, viz., round elevations without trees, and whose
slopes in numerous instances are being cultivated as vine-
yards and orchards.
Victoria cannot boast of much in the way of rivers. The
principal is the Murray, which constitutes the boundary
line between it and New South Wales on its north and
north-east extremities. This river has a course of 1,400
miles, and a large portion of it is navigable. The Goulburn
has a course of 230 miles, the Loddon of 150, the Yarra of
90, and several others of from 100 to 200 miles. Many of
the creeks or smaller streams dwindle down to a mere chain
of water holes in summer, and some dry up altogether.
Severe losses have not unfrequently resulted from this, to
owners of stock, but such a calamity is now being gradually
provided against by the water storages elsewhere referred
to.
Lakes are abundant, but generally speaking with com-
paratively little depth of water in them. In some of them
the water is salt, in others fresh. Lake Victoria covers an
area of 58,240 acres; Lake Corangamite, 48,640 acres; Lake
Wellington, 46,080 acres; and Lake Hindmarsh, 25,840
acres. Native salt in crystals is to be found in great abundance
on the shores of some of them. Several of the fresh water
lakes, such as Burrumbeet are well-stocked with perch and
English trout.
Victoria is divided into four districts, Gippsland, the


CASTLEMAINE.
WATTS RIVER FERNSHAW.




Murray, the Wimxnera, and the Loddon. These districts are
divided into thirty seven counties.
Gippsland comprehends about one-fifth of the whole
territory of Victoria. It contains vast mountain-ranges, on
some of which snow lies for a considerable portion of the
year. Its lakes are the most extensive in the colony, and
supply a fine field for the operation of the sportsman alike
for gun and rod. Its rivers are truly noble, and the angler
may find fly-fishing in them to his heart’s content. Much
of the soil is rich and fertile, and admirably fitted for
farming and cattle-grazing. In the north-west portions of
the district, quartz reefs abound, and some of them are
furnishing good yields to those who work them. Its
mineral resources are varied and extensive. In addition to
gold and silver, copper, iron, tin, and lead abound ; also
coal, limestone, and marble. Both climate and soil are
well-fitted for the growth of hops and tobacco. The orange
and the lime also thrive in the district. Sale, which is its
chief town, is a place of considerable importance, and is now
connected with Melbourne by railway. So soon as branch
lines have been constructed and roads made, it cannot fail
to attract a large and prosperous population. As a resort
for the denizens of the metropolis, it will become growingly
popular. Its romantic scenery and health-giving breezes
will ensure this. It is the Switzerland or Scotland of
Victoria—“ stern and wild the “ land of the mountain
and the flood.”
The Murray district occupies the north-eastern portion of
the colony. Mountainous tracts, thickly timbered, abound
throughout it. Immense plains of grass land, principally
occupied by squatters and farmers, spread out in the
north-east. Gold is plentiful in the Omeo, the Ovens, the
Buckland, and the Wood’s Point districts, _ and mining is
extensively carried on. Wheat is grown in some places,
and vine and tobacco culture receive considerable atten-
tion. The Nox-th-Eastern Railway affords rapid and easy
transit for produce and stock to the markets.
The Wimmera district which occupies the whole of the
North-Western portion of the colony is chiefly pastoral.
The plains are generally sandy, and but thinly grassed,
though here and there the selector finds suitable agricultural
soils. The country is generally flat, though in the southern


portion of it, there are some mountainous tracts. The
creeks dry up in summer, and drought not unfrequently
prevails, but the settlers are now digging wells, and at the
depth of about 100 feet, or a little more, they generally find
abundance of good water.
The Loddon district takes its name from the river that
runs through it. Like the Wimmera it is chiefly pastoral in
its character. Agriculture is followed successfully in some
parts of it, and in its southern portion there are numerous-
gold-fields from which large quantities of gold have been
taken, and in some of which, such as Bendigo, mining is
being systematically followed with good results.
In geological formation, the lower Silurian shows largely
in the Murray and Loddon districts, with surface drift of
recent date. In the Wimmera district, the pleiocene tertiary
prevails with dykes of granite and porphyry, while in Gipps-
land, the geological formations are principally volcanic. In
the south the carbonaceous prevails, with indications belong-
ing to the coal strata of England, In many districts the
granite and trap rock crop out in extensive beds.
The soil of the colony presents considerable variety.
Along the river flats it is rich and fertile, through the
deposits of ages made by the winter floods. Wheat and
other cereals grow there luxuriantly. About 36,000 square
miles of rich loamy soil, generally light, are to be found
along the river flats, on the wide inland plains thinly
grassed and timbered, and in belts by the sea-coast. In
hilly districts, where iron and stringy bark prevail, some
28.000 square miles of sandy loam and clay, light and
poor, are to be met with. Of rich black and chocolate-
coloured soils, well-known for their fertility, and stretching
through broad open plains where the monotony is broken
by hills lightly timbered, and frequently very.stony on the
surface, there are 12,000 square miles. There are 8,000
square miles of light sandy soils on thickly timbered
mountain ranges and well-grassed hilly country. There are
3.000 square miles of rich sandy loams and grassy downs
where thick forests abound. The comparative value of
these soils for purposes of cultivation have been classified
thus ;—lst. Alluvial soils, and black and vegetable moulds.
2nd. Black or chocolate-coloured volcanic soils. 3rd. The
poorer loams. 4th. Light and sandy soils of granite origin.


sth. Clays and adhesive loams, and those containing large
admixtures of sand. The most of English products grow
well on one or other of these soils, and numerous others
which are indigenous to warmer climates.
CHAPTER XXXIV.
ITEMS OF NATURAL HISTORY.
The colony is well timbered. Extensive forests abound.
What William Howitt calls “ the everlasting gumtree ”
the Eucalyptus tribe—is to be met with nearly everywhere.
Some of these trees grow to enormous dimensions. They
are said to be the tallest in the world. In some of the
ranges not far from Melbourne, they have been measured
considerably over 400 feet. We have seen it stated that a
fallen one at Healesville measured 480 feet, or within nine
inches of the height of the Great Pyramid of Egypt. The
Sequoia gigantea of California is said to average 275 feet, and
the highest estimate of them given by Bigelow is, we think,
about 470 feet. The red-gum is hard, compact, and
durable, and is extensively used for engineering pui’poses.
It resists the perforations of the teredo navalis, that little
borer of the sea that proves so destructive to piles and
planks, and is said to be as durable or well-nigh so, as the
jarrah wood of Western Australia. The blue gum is also
valuable, and is used in a variety of profitable ways. There are
twenty-seven varieties of the gum, and some of them, notably
the blue gum, are known to possess important sanatory and
medicinal properties. Resinous secretions abound in them,
hence their common name. Valuable oils are taken from
them, and some of them exude saccharine juices, containing
nutritive and medicinal qualities. They grow rapidly, and
possess strong absorbing and drying powers. They have
been in great demand of late years, and have been exten-
sively exported to Algeria, California, Mexico, and other
places. It is now an ascertained fact, that when planted in
marshy regions, where fever-engendering miasms abound,
they exercise a wonderfully corrective influence. They
also possess the quality of inducing rain. It is said that
large tracts of land in Algeria that were formerly arid
wastes are becoming rapidly transformed into fertile


districts through the frequency of rains, since the blue gum
was extensively planted through them. The Acacias, of
which upwards of one hundred varieties are known (one
popularly called the wattle tree), and which present a very
pretty appearance when clothed in their yellow bloom, yield
a bark which is found to be very useful for tanning pur-
poses. The ironbark is difficult to work in its dry state,
being of a very hard nature, but is well-fitted for wheel-
spokes, as also for various purposes in ship-building. The
stringy-bark splits freely, and is used largely for post and
rails, shingles, palings, and the like. Good whip handles
and tobacco pipes are made from the myall. Ferns abound,
especially in the glens of the mountain ranges, and are
frequently found of large dimensions. Single fronds may
be found measuring over six feet in length, and it is stated
that exceptional trees have been met with that have mea-
sured seventy, and, in one instance at least, eighty feet in
height. Numerous other varieties of timber are gradually
being turned to profitable use, and will, without doubt,
some day become very valuable.
Among the indigenous animals found in the colony, the
kangaroo is the most noteworthy, being in point of size
larger than any other, and in former times very numerous.
In the earlier days of the colony, it gave much trouble to
the squatter by devouring the grasses on his runs, which
would otherwise have carried a large quantity of additional
stock; but through frequent raids made upon it with dog
and rifle, its numbers have been greatly diminished, and
indeed it has been driven back from the more settled
districts, and is only to be met with in the denser forests
and ranges. Like numerous other animals in the colony,
it belongs to the marsupial order, that is, it is pos-
sessed of a natural pouch in which it carries about its
young. Among other animals may be mentioned the native
bear, a dozing, sluggish, harmless creature, so called from its
resemblance to the bear of colder regions; the bandicoot, a
small creature, somewhat pig-looking in head and snout;
the opossum, much valued by the natives for food, and out of
whose skin, warm and handsome rugs are made; the native
cat, a pretty little creature, but of destructive tendencies ;
the wombat ; the native hedge-hog; and the platypus or
duck-bill, but better known as the water-mole, a mammal of

somewhat singular form and qualities. This latter was for a
long time supposed to be fabled, and when the first preserved
and stuffed specimen was taken to England, naturalists were
inclined to regard it as the fabrication of some ingenious
Barnum. The animal has a bill like that of a duck, short
legs, five toes on each of its feet, both fore and hind,
and a broad, flat tail, nearly half the length of the body.
Its toes are furnished with claws, wherewith it makes long
burrows in river banks, while at the same time they have a
connecting membrane, which fits it for swimming. It lives
principally in the water, and finds its food in the mud. It
is quick and active, and difficult to shoot, in consequence of
the rapidity with which it goes under the water, when the
sportsman is taking his aim. Bats are numerous, the
largest of which is called the flying fox, and the smallest,
the flying mouse, and all of them are nocturnal in their
appearances and habits, and are very destructive to gardens
and orchards. The feathered tribe is remarkable for its
variety, and in some instances for beauty and brilliance of
plumage. The cockatoo, the parrot, and the parroquet
abound, many of them displaying the rarest combination of
exquisite colouring in their feathers. The eagle, the hawk,
and the owl are to be found. The magpie, with its musical
cry “at blush of dawn” abounds. The great kingfisher,
commonly called the laughing jackass, making the bush
echo at morn and eve, with its strange laughter-like hootings,
is to be met with in nearly every locality. The emu, the
largest biped in the colony, is now driven back to the great
plains. So also, the wild turkey, pigeons, quails, and native
pheasants are widely distributed. Among aquatic birds,
which are very numerous, may be mentioned the black
swan, a large and graceful creature; the native companion,
the teal, the water-hen, and others too numerous to name.
Leeches swarm in the creeks and lagoons. Snakes are to
be found in most parts of the colony, and some of them are
highly venomous. Asa general rule they get out of a mans
way as quickly as they can, and unless intercepted or at-
tacked, they do not attempt to strike any one. The insect
world is sufficiently prolific. Locusts in some districts occa-
sionally do considerable damage to gardens or green crops.
Ants are numerous, some of them, especially the bull-ant,
being of large size. The mosquito is well known as making


itself rather familiar with the “ new arrival. ” Spiders of
various kinds and sizes, embracing the centipede and taran-
tula, are numerous. Native bees abound. It may be safely
averred that in the insect life of the colony, the entomolo-
gist will find a field of research at once extensive, varied,
and interesting.
The rivers and creeks of the colony, and the seas which
wash its shores, contain a good many varieties of the finny
tribe, and some of these in great abundance. Among them
maybe mentioned the bream, the mullet,the cod, the whiting,
the schnapper, the garfish, the grayling, the perch, and others.
Good sport can be had with the rod, especially in the Gipps-
land rivers, where the fish take the fly voraciously, and are
of good size and strength. Crustaceans too, are plentiful,
and oysters of most excellent quality are obtainable in any
quantity in New South Wales.
Of late years many well-known English animals have
been introduced into the colony, and have readily become
acclimatized. Among these may be named the deer, the
hare, and the rabbit; the latter of which has become a posi-
tive nuisance in various districts, in consequence of the
almost incredible rapidity with which it has multiplied, and
the havoc it works on forms and stations. The deer, which
were located in the Wimmera districts, have shown a won-
derful increase, and are now to be met with in large herds
in the Grampian Ranges, and other localities. The Angora
goat, so much valued for its long silky hair, has also been
introduced. Among birds may be named the pheasant, the
partridge, and the quail, dear to the sportsman ; and various
English song-birds, such as the lark, the thrush, and the
blackbird. They seem generally to take kindly to the sunny
skies and the soft breezes of their new home. The English
trout has also been successfully acclimatized. They are to
be found in considerable abundance in Jackson’s Creek, the
Moorabool, the Watts, and other creeks and streams, and
are occasionally taken with the rod from 11b. up to 41b. or
51b. weight. In lakes Learmonth and Burrumbeet they are
to be met with of very large size, some of them weighing
151 b., or even more. Good sport will doubtless await the
angler in time to come.


CHAPTER XXXV.
MELBOURNE; AND ITS PLACES OF PUBLIC INTEREST.
Several distinguished visitors who have come to our shores
have pronounced Melbourne to be “ a splendid city.” Pro-
bably, it will be generally admitted that the epithet is no
exaggeration. The first impression that lays hold of the
stranger as he sets foot in our metropolis, is commonly that
of profound astonishment. He is not prepared by his pre-
conceived notions for what he sees. Making a little
allowance for “ gush,” the reported expression of an
American gentleman in Sydney, a few months ago, repre-
sents somewhat correctly the surprise almost universally
experienced by visitors from other lands when first they
tread our streets. “ Sir,” said he, to the person to whom
he was speaking, “ I guess, I’m in fairy land. What
have you been doing sir, this long time, that you
have not let us know what you are 1 Our people sir have
no notion of you at home—that’s a fact.” Though only
forty-two years old, Melbourne has attained to goodly
dimensions, and is already the seat of great institutions in
education, literature, industry, commerce, benevolence, and
religion. Its growth in that brief time from the rude
home of the savage, to the position of a city which can vie
in magnificence with cities in older countries whose up-
building has been the work of centuries, must be to any
thoughtful mind a marvel. Its streets are spacious,
crossing each other at right angles, and admirably kept.
Its shops are elegant, and stocked with everything that
wealth or fashion can desire ; its warehouses are massive
and costly ; its banks and insurance offices would be admired
in any city in the world; its colleges, schools, and churches
are numerous, and, in some instances, handsome, and
imposing ; and its suburban villas with their beautiful sur-
roundings, stretching away for miles in different directions,
exhibit at once the taste and wealth of its people. In these
respects, Melbourne is we believe, without a rival in any
British colony. Without disparaging any of the capitals of
the sister colonies, it may, we think, be pronounced the
Queen City of Australasia. As this little book may fall into
the hands of visitors from other shores, we shall briefly
enumerate the principal objects of interest in the city, so


that it may be a guide to them in their sight-seeing, as well
as present a bird’s eye view of the metropolis to those to
whom perchance it may be forwarded in the Home country.
The Parliament Houses.— These constitute an immense
pile of buildings of elaborate and magnificent design, the
ornamental front of which is in course of erection. They
contain two chambers ; that of the Legislative Council, and
that of the Legislative Assembly, both of which are
imposing and elegant; the former being strikingly beautiful
in its decorations. The order of the former is the Corinthian,
and of the latter, the Homan lonic. The Library and
Reading Rooms are of tasteful proportions, commodious,
and richly furnished, and cover an area of 124 feet by 70 feet.
A chaste and beautiful entrance hall has recently been com-
pleted at a cost of £36,000. The permanent front of the Par-
liament Buildings is at present in course of erection, the
style of which is to be the Roman Doric, with a Dome 215
feet in height, and at an estimated cost of £200,000.
Government Buildings.— ln close proximity to the Par-
liament Houses there have been erected the Treasury
Buildings, including the Governor’s Official Residence, the
Executive Council Chamber, the Chief Secretary’s Depart-
ment, the Commissioners of Audit Offices, and various other
offices at a cost of over £90,000; the Hew Public Offices,
within the Treasury Reserve, containing accommodation for
the several departments of the Treasury, Public Instruction,
Crown Lands, Public Works, Mining, Police, and Water
Supply, at a cost of over £150,000; and the Government
Printing Offices, at which the State papers and the Govern-
ment Gazette are printed and published.
The Town Hall.— This structure has been called
“ the Civic Palace ” of the metropolis. It is every way
worthy of the designation. In external appearance it is
well-proportioned, massive, and imposing. Its hall for
public assemblies is 175 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 65 feet
in height, with galleries around three sides, and an
orchestra in the remaining one, which can accommodate
about 500 performers. The grand organ said to be the fifth
in point of size in the world, and which cost £7,000, is a
noble instrument, and when its tones are drawn forth under
the skilful hand of the able organist of our city, they can
hardly fail to call forth the admiration of every lover of

“ the divine art.” The hall can accommodate from 3,000 to
4,000 people, and is the scene of many a brilliant assemblage.
Its Council Chamber, the walls of which are hung with full
length portraits in oil of those who have occupied the
Mayoral chair, is a substantial and elegant room. The
building contains numerous handsome apartments affording
ample accommodation for the transaction of the various
departments of city business, and the due observance of
public civic ceremonies. The cost of the entire structure
was close upon £lOO,OOO.
The Public Library. —This is one of the most interesting
sights of the metropolis. It is truly a noble building, and
would do credit to any of the world’s capitals. Its large
room is 240 feet in length, 50 feet in breadth, and 34 feet
in height. Its design is tasteful and imposing, and its
finish exquisite. It has accommodation for 600 readers, and
contains 100,000 volumes, embracing every department of
literature, and most of which are substantially bound. The
number of readers during the year averages a quarter of a
million. There has been expended on books the sum of
£69,874, and the buildings have cost £111,603. There is
an adequate staff of clerks and librarians, and every
facility is afforded for the consultation of any book that
may be desired. Melbourne owes a debt of lasting gratitude
to His Honor Sir Eedmond Barry, K.C.M.G., for the pos-
session and prosperity of this noble institution. The
library is open daily on ordinary week days, from 10 am.
to 10 p.m., and is free to all who choose to take advantage
of it.
The National Gallery.— This includes a gallery of
pictures and a gallery of statues. In the arrangements of
the picture gallery much taste has been displayed. The
collection is varied and excellent, embracing copies of
paintings of the great masters and numerous original works.
The copies are generally well executed, and many of the
original works display not a little of the taste and skill of
the true artist. They are all worth inspection. Several
valuable new oil paintings have recently been added to the
collection. The statuary gallery is enriched with numerous
well-executed casts of the most celebrated pieces of ancient and
modern sculpture, carefully selected from the best European
sources, and copies of the Elgin marbles from the British
H


Museum. Through, the liberality of the Hon. W. J. Clarke
four marble statues by the late Mr. Summers have recently
been added to the gallery. The subjects are—the Queen ;
His Royal Highness the late Prince Consort; His Royal
Highness the Prince of Wales ; and Her Royal Highness
the Princess of Wales.
The National Museum. —The specimens entered in the
register now number 43,812, all of which are labelled and
classified for public use in the cases, and in addition to these
there are some thousands of Entomological and Mineralogical
specimens also labelled and arranged, though not yet entered
in the catalogues. The Museum was visited by 98,149 per-
sons during the year.
The University. —This building occupies one of the
most commanding sites in the city. The reserve land
around it embraces 100 acres, and provides sites for affiliated
theological colleges in connection with the various religious
denominations. Puller details respecting the University
will be found in the chapter on “ The Higher Education.”
The Royal Mint. —This is an extensive pile of buildings
forming a square, with a frontage to William-street of 313
feet. The entire process of gold-coining can here be seen.
The machinery is very beautiful, some of it being of the
most delicate construction. Scientific skill and ingenious
combination are to be seen in no ordinary degree in the
arrangements and appliances of the various works. The
gold received at the Mint last year amounted to 569,932 oz.
The New Law Courts. —This structure, which is in
course of erection in William-street, will, when completed,
constitute a magnificent pile of buildings. The plan is that
of a quadrangle, and the centre will be surmounted by a
dome 137 feet in height, and which will constitute one of
the most prominent features of the city. There are to be
130 rooms, and accommodation is to be provided for the
Supreme Court, the County Court, the Insolvent Court, the
Equity Court, and for the various offices of the Crown Law
Department. The structure is expected to cost somewhat
over £300,000.
The General Post Office. —This is a massive block of
buildings in the very busiest part of the city—the corner of
Bourke and Elizabeth streets. It is surmounted by a sub-
stantial tower, with a magnificent clock and chimes, and an


ample and imposing colonnade runs along the two sides
facing the streets already named. Connected with it are
the Post Office Savings Bank, the Money Order Office, and
the Telegraph Department.
The Melbourne Hospital. —This is an admirable
institution. Its wards are roomy, well ventilated, and most
cleanly. Attached to it is a gai’den, well stocked with
flowering shrubs, and intersected with shady walks, where
patients who are on the way to convalescence can breathe
the fresh air and take gentle recreation. The Hospital has
a resident staff of four medical officers, and an honorary
staff of four physicians, four assistant physicians, and eight
surgeons. All the most recent hospital improvements have
been introduced into it. The number of cases treated in it
last year amounted to 4,191.
The International Exhibition. — This structure is on
a scale of magnitude which could scarcely have been expected
in a colony and city so young as ours. The style of archi-
tecture is Italian, and in its general form the building bears
some resemblance to a cathedral, with nave and transept,
and a dome rising from the centre. The length of the
building from east to west, inside the doorways, is 500 feet.
A balcony runs right round the main building 20ft. wide,
with picture galleries east and west 30ft. wide. The main
walls are of bluestone, and those from which the dome is
started are nearly 6ft. thick. The dome itself is a massive
and elegant piece of work. The fact that it took 2,000
bricks to lay one tier gives some idea of its magnitude.
The total height from the ground to the flag-staff surmount-
ing the dome is about 250 ft. A promenade, protected by a
handsome parapet, suri'ounds the dome, from which a most
magnificent panoramic view of Melbourne and suburbs can
be obtained. It was first intended that the Exhibition
should consist only of a large central hall, with one
machinery annexe, the estimated cost being £60,000.
Subsequently it was decided to erect a second annexe at an
additional cost of £9,000 ; but in consequence of the extra-
ordinary demand for space by European and American
exhibitors, extension after extension was found necessary,
and from an Exhibition representing a total cost of about
£90,000, the undertaking assumed the proportions of one
of those great displays of art and industry which are now


periodically held in the leading capital cities of the world.
The main building and two machinery halls are permanent,
and will always be available for exhibition purposes. Large
as these buildings are, they represent only one-fourth of the
entire area of the Exhibition. The total area of the main
building and machinery halls is about 350,000 ft., to which
must be added the temporary buildings which form the
industrial part of the Exhibition. Altogether the superficial
area of the floor space provided amounts to over one million
square feet. The main avenue, which starts from the end
of the transept of the permanent building, forms a magnifi-
cent arcade of over 800 ft. in length, and, as the view is
terminated by an open fernery, the vista is a most charming
one. The total cost of the Exhibition to the colony may
be set down at £325,000, of which £250,000 has been
expended on buildings and other works. In addition to
this amount, large sums have been spent by France, Ger-
many, Austria, and other nations in extending and improv-
ing the space placed at their disposal. The total value of
the exhibits contained in the Exhibition has been estimated
at four and a half millions sterling. The design of the
colossal structure is by Messrs. Reid and Barnes, the well-
known architects.
Among other places well worth a visit may be mentioned
the Botanical Gardens, picturesquely situated on the banks
of the Yarra, exquisitely laid out, diversified with wood
and water, with lawns and flowerbeds, and many a winding
walk, and exhibiting rare and choice shrubs and flowers
from every clime; the Acclimatisation and Zoological
Society’s Gardens in the Royal Park, with its already
extensive collection of wild animals, reptiles, beautiful birds,
and select plants eligible for industrial culture in the colony ;
the Horticultural Society’s Gardens; Fitzroy Gardens;
the Flagstaff Gardens; the University Gardens; Albert
Park and Studley Park; the Alfred Hospital and Benevo-
lent Asylum; Government House and the Observatory;
the Burke and Wills Monument; the Technological Museum;
the Athenaeum ; the Emerald Hill Town Hall; the Prahran
Public Library; the Lunatic Asylums; the Blind Asylum and
Deaf and Dumb Institution; Pentridge Stockade; the
Industrial Schools; the Sailors’ Home; the Melbourne
Cemetery ; the Orphan Asylum at Brighton and Orphanage

at Emerald Hill; the Boyal, Victoria, and Eastern
Arcades in Bourke-street; the Alfred Graving Dock ; the
Collins-street banks ; several of the more elegant churches,
and a number of the more massive wool and soft-goods
warehouses. A visit to these places will help to give some
idea of the wealth and enterprise of the city.
Along the beautiful shores of Hobson’s Bay, and within
easy distance of Melbourne, there are numerous places of
interest, to which the dwellers in the city resort for change
and recreation. The most of them can be reached in the course
of a few hours by railway or steamer. We may name St.
Kilda, with its beautiful residences, its fine Esplanade, and
well-appointed bathing houses; Williamstown,with its graving
dock, its commodious pier, its patent slips and ship-building
yards; Brighton, with its handsome villas and breezy
beach; Mordialloc, a favourite resort of picnic parties;
Frankston, at the foot of Mount Eliza ; Dromana, Morn-
ington, Sorrento, and other spots, popular as watering
places ; and Queenscliff, at the entrance to the Bay, much
frequented for sea-bathing and its health-giving breezes.
CHAPTER XXXVI.
BALLARAT, SANDHURST, AND GEELONG
Ballarat is second in importance only to Melbourne. Its
situation is good, and it is much admired by strangers who
visit it. Standing on an elevation of nearly 1500 feet
above the sea-level, it possesses a cooler atmosphere than
low-lying districts. Snow falls occasionally in winter. It
has nearly 90 miles of made streets, and upwards of 160
miles of footpaths. Its population is about 48,000. Its
principal street is one of which its citizens may well be
proud. Spacious, well-made, ornamented with rows of
beautiful trees, lined with noble buildings and elegantly
furnished shops, it would be an ornament to any city.
Among its numerous public buildings may be mentioned its
commodious Hospital, its Benevolent Asylum, its Free
Public Library with 10,000 volumes, its City Hall, its
three town halls, its three theatres, its municipal Council
Chamber, its Mechanics’ Institute with library of 12,000
volumes, its numerous banks and insurance companies, its
101
Our Colony in 1880.


colleges and grammar-schools, and its forty churches. It
possesses a woollen manufactory, several flour mills, a
number of iron foundries, a soap work, a pottery, and
various other works, and some 300 inns and hotels. It has a
School of Mines which has attained to some celebrity,
law courts, post, telegraph, and money offices, and
a savings’ bank. It publishes three daily newspapers
and one weekly. Ballarat owes its rise and progress
to its gold-yielding soil. It is questionable if in the
world it has any rival in this respect. Its alluvial diggings
yielded in its early days fabulous quantities of gold.
Many a brilliant fortune was taken from them. The
world-famed “ Welcome Nugget” was obtained from one
of them, and the “Nil Desperandum” from another, at
a depth of 180 and 9 feet respectively. The “ Blacksmith’s
Party” took out from one small claim £24,000 worth
of gold, and another claim in the Gravel Pits lead, known
as the Italian’s, yielded to the first party working in it
£2OOO per man in seven weeks. As the yield from the
alluvial sinkings showed signs of failing, a source of yet
greater wealth was found to exist in the quartz deposits.
According to the latest statistics which we are in
possession of 8,862 persons were engaged in working
the mines, and the extent of ground operated upon
embraced 157 square miles. Ballarat has also rich agri-
cultural surroundings. Last year 42,537 acres were
under tillage in the district, of which 5,828 acres were
under wheat and yielded 92,140 bushels. On the Ercildoun
estate, in the neighbourhood, the property of the Honorable
Sir Samuel Wilson, wool is grown, which for fineness of
quality can carry off the palm against the world. The
citizens of Ballarat are well known for their public
spirit and advanced intelligence. Liberal, patriotic, and
progressive, they exercise an important influence in the
colony on all the leading questions of the day. Recently
a juvenile exhibition on a large scale proved a great
success. Ballarat is divided into East and West, each
of which has its municipality, with mayor and councillors.
It was erected into a city in 1874. Though it has
suffered for a considerable time through depression in
the gold-mining interest, recently marked signs of a
revival have become apparent. In the outskirts of the


city a sheet of water known as Lake Wendouree is much
frequented for boating purposes, and also affords good
sport for the angler, being well stocked with trout and perch.
Sandhurst, known in former times as Bendigo, takes
rank as a leading city in Victoria. Some indeed, claim
for it the position which is more generally accorded to
Ballarat, that of being second only to Melbourne. Situated
in the centre of a rich gold-field, it has gradually risen
to importance and wealth. Probably it may now be
regarded as the premier gold-field of the colony. In its
earlier days a large amount of the precious metal was taken
from its alluvial diggings, but it is only since its quartz-reefs
were opened up that some idea of its marvellous richness
in gold deposits has been obtained. Like the other gold-
fields of the colony, it suffered a lengthened period of
depression, but of late a spirit of greater hopefulness has
pervaded it. Those who are best qualified to give an
opinion, tell us that its quartz ranges contain almost
inexhaustible supplies of gold, and that they will furnish fields
of profitable industry for generations, if not centuries, to
come. Mining operations are carried on over an extent of
country embracing 141 square miles. The value of the
mining plant is estimated at nearly <£500,000. There are
between 6000 and 7000 miners employed, with 225 steam-
engines and an aggregate horse-power of over 4000. Com-
paratively little puddling now exists. In addition to
mining, there are numerous other industries successfully
prosecuted, such as iron-foundries, tanneries, potteries,
works for brick and tile making, and coach-building.
Besides farming in the surrounding country, vine-growing
is carried on with good results, and excellent wines have
been made in the district. The municipality contains a
population of 26,929, with rateable property to the value
of £1,843,690. It possesses about one hundred miles of
streets, of which the principal one, called Pall Mall, is
much admired. On one side of it are the principal places
of business —banks, shops, and stores —many of them being
large and imposing structures of brick and stone; and on
the other side is Bosalind Park, a place much frequented by
the people for purposes of recreation. Among the
reserves of the city, special mention may be made of the
Botanical Gardens, which are laid out with great taste, and


contain many rare and beautiful shrubs, and also collections
of birds and animals from other countries. There are some
twenty churches, and the usual proportion of State-schools.
It owns three newspapers: the Bendigo Advertiser , which
has a weekly as well as a daily issue ; the Bendigo Inde-
pendent and the Bendigo Evening News. It has the
advantage of an abundant supply of water from the Crusoe,
the Big Hill, and the Spring Gully reservoirs. Its
charitable and religious institutions receive a considerate
and generous support, and a prompt interest is ever
manifested by its population in the educational, social, and
political movements of the day.
Geelong is prettily situated. The ground on which it
is built stretching backwards from the Bay is gently
acclivitous, and after reaching a considerable elevation falls
again towards the Barwon River on its south side. Its
streets are well laid out and formed, and its shops and
stores are substantial and attractive. It possesses numerous
churches, banks, and public buildings, many of which are
most creditable structures. Special mention may be made of
its spacious Town Hall, its Hospital, and Benevolent
Asylum, its Mechanics’ Institute with library of nearly
12,000 volumes, its Clock-Tower, and its College. In matters
intellectual it is well-appointed. In addition to the library
already referred to, it has its Free Library, its three news-
papers ably conducted, its Grammar School and College
sustaining high reputations, and its numerous State schools.
Many substantial and elegant private residences adorn the
town and suburbs. The first woollen manufactory in the
colony was established here, and received the Government
premium of £1,500. There are now four factories at work;
two of which are the property of private individuals, and
the other two of public companies. The principal manufac-
ture turned out by them is tweeds, which are in good

CHAPTER XXXVII.
A WANING AND A COMING RACE—THE ABORIGINES
AND THE CHINESE.
We deem it proper to devote a brief chapter to these two
races—the former having been the original occupants of the
soil, and the latter by their presence and numbers presenting
a difficulty at the present hour which is calling forth no
small discussion throughout the colony. At the time when
the colony was taken possession of by the white man, it is
estimated that the aboriginal population amounted to about
5000. They were a wandering people, having no settled
location, hunting for food through the forests and by the
river tracts. It not unfrequently happened that they
received anything but justice at the hands of the early
settlers. No doubt they were troublesome, and this is
scarcely to be wondered at, considering that their favourite
hunting grounds were taken from them by the strong hand
of the new comers. Ignorant and revengeful, they occa-
sionally plundered the settler or murdered some of his
shepherds, and in these circumstances self-defence prompted
strong and severe measures. Yet, if we may credit reports,
they were often treated brutally, shot down as if they
had been wild dogs. But more foi’midable instruments of
evil than the rifle were brought to bear upon them by the
settler. These were the “ fire waters,” and the vices and
concomitant evil diseases of the white man, which swept
them away as a flood. According to the Society for the
Protection of the Aborigines, the number of blacks in Vic-
toria in 1863, amounted to 1,098. According to a census
taken by the Board in 1877, the number was reduced to
1,067. Government provided certain stations for them
where they find comfortable homes, and are supplied with


clothing and provisions, with education and religious
ordinances, and are taught the arts of industry and agricul-
ture. The sum of £6,758 was expended in providing com-
forts and privileges for them between the Ist January,
1876, and June 30th, 1877. The aboriginal frequently
displays a good physique. If somewhat deficient in strength,
he is lithe and agile in movement. He can run and swim
with expertness, and can climb a tree with cat-like
aptitude. His sight and hearing are remarkably keen. He
makes an excellent cricketer, and can follow a track with
the accuracy of a bloodhound. One of his weapons, the
boomerang, is the offspring of no mean intellectual ability.
He can throw it so that it will gyrate round the out-
spreading branches of a lofty tree, and return again to his
feet. On special tribal occasions he has been wont to resort
to the corrobboree, or grand war-dance and song, a ceremony
in which several hundreds would frequently take part, and
which, as the various groups of actors, grotesquely painted,
came forward and performed their mystic evolutions to
strange wild music under the light of the moon, or a
huge bonfire kindled for the occasion, presented a spec-
tacle of weird and unearthly character. The group
of natives that is shown in one of the illustra-
tions is thus described by Brough Smyth in his work
on the Aborigines : —“ The woman in mourning and the
woman and child are natives of the Western district
(Hopkin’s River) ; the girl with the raised scars on her
breast and shoulders, the boy to the left of the central
figure, and the man and woman immediately below, belong
to the River Yarra Yarra district. The last-named—Wonga,
the principal man of the Yarra tribe, and his wife—are two
well-known natives. Wonga has a mild disposition, and
is always gentle and courteous. He is a good speaker, and
has much influence with his people. The man to the right
of the central figure is Nathaniel, generally regarded as
highly intelligent. He was educated at Lake Hindmarsh
Station. The man holding a spear is Whyate, a black from
the Western coast. He is a native of a type that is by
no means common. The central figure shows a native in
ordinary attire.” Two questions naturally arise in reference
to this hitherto steadily waning race. Ist. Are the
Aborigines capable of being brought within the pale of


civilization ? This may now safely be answered in the
affirmative. There is no intellectual obstacle in the way.
The children are apt at receiving instruction. We have
ample testimony on this point furnished in the statements
of the Rev. Mr. Hagenauer and other missionaries who
have labored among them for yeai's. Numbers of them
have received the gospel, and some after doing so have made
themselves active and useful in church work. One female
has been accustomed to preside with gracefulness and
efficiency at the harmonium in connection with the church
services. 2nd. What is likely to be their final destiny as a
race ? Will they melt away before the civilization of the
white man ? The process of deterioration and destruction
seems to have sustained at least a temporary arrest through
the provision that has been made by the Government for
their preservation and comfort, and through the con-
servative influences of Christianity; but whether they will
be able to reach any useful and progressive position in
society, or to exist without the constant supervision and
care of others, remains to be seen. Everything should be
done for them that Christianity and civilization can devise,
but taking even this into account, it is difficult to get rid of
the fear that at no very distant date they may become an
extinct race.
The presence of the Chinese ever and again becomes a
disturbing element in the community. Incidental occur-
rences have been made the occasion of late of giving to it
fresh prominence. What is the attitude which we should
assume towards our Mongolian brethren ? Are we to offer
facilities for their coming amongst us like any other people,
or are we to adopt such restrictive measures as will virtually
forbid them from setting foot on our soil 1 There is one
point on which we think all must be agreed. No wrong
must be done to those who are already in the midst of us.
They have been allowed to come to the colony, and they are
entitled to be treated fairly, honourably, and kindly. The
imposition of special disabilities without any adequate
reason were un-English and un-Christian. The full benefit
of our civilization and Christianity should be accorded to
them. But what should be our policy towards the nation
from which they come 1 Any day our yellow-visaged
friends might come down upon us in a full flood-tide of


immigration. Shall we open our gates to them as hereto-
fore ? A good deal can be said in their favour. They are
quiet, industrious, and inoffensive. They are excellent
market-gardeners. In some districts the people are almost
entirely dependent upon them for vegetables. They are the
principal tobacco-growers in the Murray district. They are
kind to their own poor. The wealthier among them give
generously to our public charities. Not a little of what is
said against them is too much like stone-throwing by those
who live in glass houses. They gamble ! But can white
men cast the first stone at them on this score ? They are
opium-smokers ! But what of our drunkards, who reel in
cur streets reeking with the fumes of the debauch, loading
the air with their blasphemy, while wife and children are
famine-stricken in desolate homes. They are monsters of
immorality, very incarnations of wickedness ! But are there
no foul spots in our own community—dark with unmention-
able crimes ? Then surely we ought to know better than they.
But while simple justice demands of us that we speak
thus, the question still remains, does the presence of the
Mongolian constitute a desirable factor in the development
of our national life 1 Will he help to make or unmake the
structure of our civilization and morals? We are afraid
the verdict will not be in his favour ? In many respects our
yellow-visaged brother is not a desirable colonist. Recently
a strong hostility has been evoked against him, on the
ground that living as he does at a comparatively small
cost, he can afford to sell his labour cheaply, and by
working for smaller wages and gradually finding his way
into various departments of industry, he threatens to take
the bread from the working man and his family. A cry of
this kind is very apt to be exaggerated. Whatever might
happen in the future, were the Chinese coming in upon
us in large numbers,'we can hardly think that meanwhile
there is much ground for apprehension, inasmuch as the
entire number of the Chinese resident in Melbourne and
suburbs is, according to estimate, not more than between
500 and 600, while the great majority of these are store-
keepers, hawkers of fancy goods, fish, and vegetables, or
engaged in other ways, and probably little more than one-
tenth of them working as tradesmen. But there are other
nnd yet graver considerations to be taken into account.


The Chinaman does not come among us with the view of
making for himself a permanent home. His object is to
get a little gold, and be off again to the “ Flowery Land.”
He is thus merely a bird of passage. He does not bring
his wife with him, and consequently his domestic habits can
hardly be expected to be commendable. In things sanatory
he is sadly at fault. He does not take on with any
readiness our habits of civilization, but sticks to his pig-tail,
his outre dress, and his mean and overcrowded hovel with
striking tenacity. His moral code, on many points, is at
variance with that of civilized communities. Unless con-
stantly and narrowly watched, he would speedily demoralize
a large portion of the young people in our community by
his gambling schemes. He is moreover an idolater. There
are exceptions among them of course in these matters, but
we speak of the Chinese in the general. And taking these
things into consideration; on the broad ground of keeping
our young national life as fresh and pure as possible, and
building up a civilization on the English model, and handing
down to generations to come a worthy fabric of morality
and religion, it seems as though it would be sound policy
not to encourage an influx of our Mongolian friends. If
the door be kept open, they may come upon us like a deluge
of waters, and finally possess the land. As for those who
are already in our midst, let us treat them justly and
kindly, and try by Christianly persuasion to bring them into
our beliefs and ways. At the same time acting under the
influence of the primal and supreme law of self-preservation,
it may be well to discourage, by some legislative measure of
a restrictive character, the introduction into our community
of any great number of the dwellers in the Celestial empire.
And probably this can be most satisfactorily effected by our
Government acting in concert with the Governments of the
adjacent colonies in dealing with the acknowledged difficulty.
CHAPTER XXXVIII.
PROBLEMS :
IN HYGIENE, MORALS, SOCIAL ORDER, AND PROGRESS.
Numerous questions intimately associated with the well-
being and prosperity of our city and colony claim attention.


Most of them have been under discussion from time to
time, hut still await solution. Men of wise heads and
patriotic enterprise are wanted to bring them to a practical
outcome. We can only epitomize a few of what seem to
us to be the more pressing.
Health of the Community.— No social question can be
invested with a deeper interest than this one. And cer-
tainly there is room for sanatory improvement. The water
supply of our populous city demands prompt and effective
action. We have been wont to be proud of the Yan Yean
reservoir, one of the finest artificial collections of water in
the world, and which has cost us, first and last, with its
appendages, the goodly sum of somewhere about a million
of money. But the water has undergone deterioration.
Though flowing down from the Plenty Ranges in “ perfect
purity and brightness,” it becomes contaminated in its
passage through flats and marshes of lower levels, and carries
with it into the reservoir large quantities of clay and vege-
table matter, which give to it such discolouration as make
it anything but pleasant to the eye as a drinking fluid.
Opinions may differ as to whether it is actually injurious to
the system, although it is to be noticed that able chemists
and medical authorities have sounded the note of warning.
But what is wanted is a remedy, and that at any cost. The
consumers are entitled to pure sweet water for their houses
and their tables, the more especially as they pay so hand-
somely for their supply. It is not for us to say whether it
is to be obtained by some process of purification, or by
tapping the streams higher up the ranges, before they
come into contact with deteriorating elements; it is enough to
know that the present supply is objectionable, and that a pure
supply is to be had. Competent engineering is not far to seek.
It may be a question whether it is not advisable at the
present crisis to transfer the water supply to a Metropolitan
Board of Works, to be created by the local municipal
bodies interested in it. It is more immediately the concern
of the citizens of Melbourne and suburbs than of the
Government. Besides the Ministry will have quite enough
work on their hands irrespective of this. Something
should be done, and done quickly. Another work of mag-
nitude and urgency, as bearing on the health of the public,
is a proper system of sewage for the metropolis. For a


quarter of a century the Melbourne press have ever and
again been warning the citizens on this matter. The
present condition of things is a standing menace to the
health of the people. In 1878 the deaths in Melbourne and
suburbs amounted to 20.12 in every 1000 of the population,
while in the country districts they amounted to only 8.87 in
every 1000. Making due allowance for the numbers of
patients who come from the country to our hospitals and
charitable institutions, and for those who outside these in-
stitutions come for medical attendance and nursing when
seriously ill, may it not be safely averred that an
important element in the greater mortality of the me-
tropolis is our defective drainage ? The present Mayor of
Melbourne, George Meares, Esq., has with commendable
spirit and generosity offered a premium of 200 guineas
for the best scheme of sewage for the city. It may be
reasonably expected that in these days of able engineering
a suitable scheme will be forthcoming. It is to be hoped
that when obtained, it will not be consigned to the dust
and oblivion of the shelf. At any cost it should be executed.
The men who give reality to an approved design will be
entitled to be held in grateful remembrance by the dwellers
in the great city for genex-ations to come. Another import-
ant element in the health of the metropolis, and which,
while helping to beautify it, would afford the comfort of
grateful shade when the sun’s rays strike fiercely on our hot
summer days, would be the planting of suitable trees on the
verge of our footpaths. A beginning has been made in this
respect, but only a beginning, and it is to be hoped that
there will not be much longer delay in carrying out to
completion this desirable work. Much, too, requires to be
done in the way of removing old, filthy little hovels, the
remnants of primitive and ruder times in our history,
existing in various districts of the city, and which are not
only eye-sores, but in many instances hot-beds of corruption
and disease, and are totally unfit for occupancy by human
beings. Something has been done in this direction in the
past, but a great deal more remains to be accomplished.
The salubrity of the low-lying and marshy districts of the
colony might be greatly improved by a judicious planting
of the Eucalyptus globulus. Its febrifugal attributes are
well known. It is said that in parts of Algeria and Corsica


endemic fevers have been stamped out through its introduc-
tion. Even the Roman Campagna, the home of malaria and
fever, is undergoing a salutary change through its presence.
We read that the Eucalyptus has been planted in the
cloisters of the monastery of “TreFontaine,” where tradition
says St. Paul met his death ; and that whereas formerly, life
in that monastery meant death to the monks, fever has now
disappeared, and the spot has become salubrious and habit-
able. From fever-smitten districts in various other countries
similar testimony comes as to the health-giving influence of
this remarkable tree. But, like many other things in this
world, being within easy reach of us we think comparatively
little of it.
The Unemployed.— That there should be considerable
numbers of able-bodied men unable to find employment in
a colony like this must be regarded as an abnormal state of
things. The opposite ought to be true. If things were as
they should be, labour would be absorbed as quickly as it
landed on these shores. The anomaly, however, exists and
must be dealt with. Men who are able and willing to work,
and who cannot find work to do, are entitled to sympathy
and a measure of relief. In times of unusual pressure and
distress, such as have prevailed of late, it is expedient that
Government should step forward, and, if possible, tide the
unemployed through the crisis, by providing labour for them in
connection with works of a productive character. But great
discrimination should be employed in doing so. None but
those really entitled to relief in this form ought to
receive it. It is well known that not a few idle, good-for-
nothing hangers-on are ever ready to swell the clamour for
work. The wages paid on relief works should be simply
relief wages. Unless this be observed, the private
employers of labour will be placed at a disadvantage. It
is well-known that men throw up their work in the country,
and come to Melbourne when there is a prospect of
obtaining employment from the Government, and good wages.
The measure, moreover, should only be of a temporary
character. The system is not without its dangers. It
threatens to take root as a permanent institution. It
can hardly fail to engender dissatisfaction among the rate-
payers whose purses must pay for its support. Other
classes will also begin to look for it, and it will be difficult

to show why Government should not provide situations
for clerks, shopmen, and others when out of employment,
as well as for labourers. It puts a power into the hands of
the Government, which may be used wrongly, and implies
functions which properly do not belong to them. But worst
of all, it will exercise a pauperising influence on the labouring
classes themselves, sapping their independence and self-
reliance, and thus destroying in them all true manliness of
feeling. Is there any remedy for this state of things 1 We
would suggest that the idea should be discountenanced that
it is any proper part of the functions of the Government to
provide work for the unemployed, save in the extreme case
referred to ; that working men should exercise economy in
good times, and cultivate a manly independence of spirit;
that cordial relations should be maintained between capital
and labour, and that the principal of co-operation might be
more extensively taken advantage of. In some of the
immediately following paragraphs, we refer to these matters
more fully.
Thrift. —In the cultivation of thrift on the part of the
individual and the family, a key may be found to the
solution of much of the difficulty connected with the unem-
ployed. If the working man attend to this when he has
plenty to do, it will enable him to meet seasons of depres-
sion without the humiliation of having to apply for “ the
Government dole ” when they come. The secret of inde-
pendence wrapped up in the wise little epigram—
“ An honest man will live on what he has,
A prudent man on less.”
needs to be better understood. “ From hand to mouth ”
is too much the order of the day, in the mode of living.
Whatever, in the shape of wages, comes into the family,
quickly goes out again. Micawber’s philosophy may be
admitted, but is not acted upon; income, 20s; outlay,
19s. 6d.—result, happiness. Income, 20s. ; outlay, 20s.
6d.—result, misery. There are three considerations which,
if people could only be got to understand and act upon,
would revolutionize for good the condition of a large
portion of society. Ist. It is a wrong thing in itself
for a man to neglect the acquisition of habits of thrift.
Wastefulness is a vice. 2nd. It is a wrong thing for a man
to make no provision for the future. The rainy day will
I


come, and when it comes, what then 1 3rd. It is a wrong
thing that the thrifty portion of the community should be
called upon to support those who have brought themselves
to poverty and wretchedness through their neglect of thrift;
in other words, through their extravagance and wastefulness.
There is such a thing as honest poverty, the result of adverse
circumstances which lie beyond a man’s control, and this
when known will ever meet with ready sympathy and
succour ; but at the same time it must be admitted that a
large amount of the destitution that prevails has arisen
from preventable causes, and is therefore self-imposed. It
ought to be an acknowledged principle that every intelligent
member of society should make such provision against times
of depression, sickness, and age, as would keep him from
straits of poverty ; and surely in a colony like this, where
wages are good and opportunities of success are plentiful,
and where, moreover, all classes of the people spend money
most lavishly on the pleasures and luxuries of life, it lies
within the reach of nearly everyone at one time or another
to make the provision referred to. So strong has feeling on
this subject become in the home country of late, that it has
been seriously proposed that Government should undertake
the work of securing provision for the people’s future ; in
other words, that it should take so much of every man’s
income, especially while under age and without burdens, as
would in the course of time constitute provision for him
against a day of need. Lord Derby, while not pronouncing
for or against such a scheme, remarked that thirty years
ago the idea of compulsory education would have seemed
quite as impracticable as that of compulsory insurance. A
little thrift, when work is plentiful, would enable the work-
ing man to meet the season when work is scarce, in the
spirit of manly independence.
Labour and Capital.— The want of a proper under-
standing between capital and labour is a fruitful source of
mischief. These two great forces of society are regarded by
many as though they were antagonistic. Capital is fre-
quently spoken of as if it were the enemy of the working
classes. This is a favourite theme of the demagogue, and,
though not accepted by the more intelligent among the work-
ing men, yet it goes down with a certain class. The following
things ought to be well considered. Ist. Capital has sprung


from labour. All capital is the fruit of labour in the past.
Labour husbanded to-day becomes capital to-morrow. 2nd.
Every working man may become a capitalist. Every shil-
ling he saves, every pound he puts into the savings-bank,
goes to the formation of capital. The labourer may, if he
choose, become in this way the employer of labour. 3rd.
Capital is the grand promoter of industry. Wherever it
exists and is employed, labour must be in demand. 4th.
The withdrawal of capital is the greatest calamity that can
befall the working classes, for it is the ruin of laboui’. That
capital may be used wrongly is true; but to drive it away
or to ruin it, is to destroy the goose that lays the golden
eggs. sth. Capital and labour are mutually dependent.
Capital without labour is helpless ; labour would find no
field without capital. Their interests are essentially one;
they feed each other. It follows, then, that the outcry that
is made by some against capital is a mischievous mistake.
If a country is to have prosperity, working-men and em-
ployers must understand each other; their interests are
bound up in the same bundle. Instead of hindering each
other, they should be mutually helpful. Where this is not
the case, the social fabric speedily gets shaken.
Co-operation. —The principle of co-operation, or, in
other words, a system of united effort for production or
distribution in connection with industrial and commercial
pursuits, is one which, if better understood, could not fail
to lead to important social results. Numerous societies,
based upon it, in England and elsewhere, have met with
the most marked success. The co-operative store is simply
the business of a joint-stock co-partnery, consisting of, it
may be, several hundreds of individuals, who are at once
the proprietors and the customers of the concern. The
profits are therefore their own. The goods, which are
generally of excellent quality, are purchased on ad-
vantageous terms, and sold to the members at such a price
as will cover working expenses and leave a small margin of
profit. By excellence in goods, cheapness, ready-money
sales, and economy in management, many of these societies
are exceedingly prosperous. One, which commenced in
Rochdale in 1844, with a capital of less than £3O, realized
in profits in 1872 the large sum of £33,640. Co-operative
societies are not unknown in the colony. Their increase


and extension is merely a question of time. The idea has
frequently been thrown out of late that the principle which
they embody might, especially in the department of pro-
duction, be brought to bear with good results, on at least two
of our leading industries. We refer to farming and mining.
Why might not fifty diggers who are working in proximity
to each other, or fifty farmers in some newly settled district,
go to work upon the principle 1 If cotton fabrics and other
materials can be produced upon it in England with satis-
factory profits, why may not crops be taken from the lands
and gold from the soil in this colony on a like principle and
with like results 1 With careful management, great things
might be done. Economy would take the place of wasteful
outlay ; capital would be conserved ; labour would be ju-
diciously distributed; works in irrigation and the like would
be undertaken, which are now neglected; individual
energies, which are flagging under accumulating difficulties,
would be relieved and encouraged ; and districts, which are
now languishing, would revive and prosper. General
success would mean individual comfort and prosperity as
well.
Irrigation. —Though there has been considerable talk
on this subject of late years, its importance to our
colony is not sufficiently understood. If it were, something
more effectual would be done. One of the great wants of
the colony at this hour is a national system of irrigation.
In the southern districts of Europe, irrigation is carried
out on an extensive scale, and is the source of enormous
wealth. Along the banks of the Po alone, over one and a
half millions of acres are under irrigation, and the lands
in consequence bring an increased rental to the amount of
£850,000. A comprehensive system for Victoria would be
worth almost any amount of outlay. The colony would
then be comparatively safe against droughts. The scorching
effects of the hot wind would be largely neutralized. Vast
plains now completely worthless would soon be transformed
into luxuriant pastures. Treeless wastes would become
valuable water meadows. Thriving farms and richly-pro-
ducing market gardens would abound, where now we see
bare soil or stunted scrub. In these days of great schemes,
when estuaries are bridged, and Mont Cenis tunnelled, and
Egypt canalized, the irrigation of Victoria must surely be

practicable. The only proposal of note yet put forward is
the North-Western Canal Company’s Scheme. According
to the calculation of the promoters, the value of wheat-growing
land along the route of the canal would be increased from £3
to £3O per acre. It appears that Mr. Gordon, the Govern-
ment engineer, has reported unfavourably as to the practi-
cability of the scheme. What we would say is, that a
comprehensive and practicable measure should be considered
and determined on with as little delay as possible, and that
the Government should either undertake the work itself, or
afford every facility for a company doing so. With our
sunny clime and such a system, Victoria might become one
of the gardens of the world.
Federation. —The idea of uniting the various colonies
of the Australian group in one empire is gradually taking
hold of the public mind. It is engaging the attention of
not a few of our best thinkers, and is steadily coming to
the front as one of the “ burning ” questions of the day.
There is very little to be said against the proposal, and a
great deal to be said in its favour. Naturally they seem
fitted to be one nation. No impassable mountain ranges, or
broad inland seas divide them. The same may be said of
them viewed ethnically. The people in the different colonies
are one and the same; speaking one language, observing
the same customs, actuated by the same beliefs, and bound
together by common interests and aims. Their present
position of isolation and individual independence has its
manifold evils. Petty jealousies spring from it. It offers
temptations to rivalry, not always of a healthful or
economic character. The maintenance of their respective
governmental institutions involves an expenditure utterly
disproportionate to their populations. As they are, they
are severally of comparatively small account in the category
of nations. Federation would mean the opposite of all
this. We should at once assume the position of a respect-
able embryo empire. Vexatious intercolonial tariffs would
be removed. A system of uniform laws would be established.
An immense saving would be effected in the maintenance
and administration of government. Greater facilities
would be afforded for opening up for settlement immense
districts of country, as yet comparatively unknown.
National undertakings would be carried out on a grander


scale. Our powers of self-defence would be largely increased,
and we should be able to put forth a weightier influence
for good in the scale of nations. Disunited, the various
colonies will remain feeble; federated, they would become
growingly strong. On local, natural, social, national, and
religious grounds, it must, we think, be pronounced ex-
pedient that they should be consolidated into one Australian
nation. That there are obstacles in the way, connected
with free-trade and protection, the selection of the metro-
polis and other matters, must be admitted, but if these were
left over till the greater question were settled, probably no
great difficulty would be experienced in adjusting them.
Intemperance.— There is one evil prevalent amongst us
that is fitted to awaken deep concern in the bosom of every
well-wisher to our community. We mean drunkenness.
Not that it stands alone. Gambling is leading many
a young man down to ruin. The “ social evil” is a foul cancer
in our community. But drunkenness—too closely allied
to both—claims the pre-eminence. Statistics show that as
a cognizable offence it is increasing at a greater ratio than
other offences. In 1873, of the total number of arrests, one
in every 2.22 was for drunkenness, but in 1878 it had in-
creased to one in every 2.16. Notwithstanding that arrests
for this offence are seldom made unless it is accompanied
with disorderly conduct, in 1878 they amounted to 11,825.
In a number of cases the same individual would be re-
peatedly arrested, but supposing that each arrest represented
a distinct person the number taken into custody for drunk-
enness would amount to one in every seventy-three of the
population. But after making every allowance in this respect,
the evil.must be admitted to be one of frightful magnitude.
Figures give but a faint conception of it. Thousands of
men and women are the victims of this vice who never
come within the cognizance of the civil law. No condition
of life is proof against it. A large proportion of our
poverty and crime is directly traceable to it. In-
sanity is a frequent development of it. Gould the
veil be lifted so that one could see the cruelty it is in-
flicting on innocent children, the desolation it is working in
otherwise happy homes, the hearts it is breaking, the young of
both sexes whom it is plunging in ruin, every right-minded
man and woman would stand aghast and appalled at the


sight. Shall this moral plague be permitted to continue its
ravages 1 Who will stand between the living and the dead,
that it may be stayed 1 The question is, bow shall it be
done 1 Remedies enough are proposed. Prohibitory laws ;
regulation of public-houses on the now famous Gothenburg
system ; Good Templarism ; extension of coffee taverns ;
recreation and amusements for the working classes, and the
like. The most of these have something good and praise-
worthy in them. The Gothenburg system, which provides
that licenses shall be sold not to individuals but to
companies, under condition that all profits, after de-
ducting five per cent, on the working capital, shall
go for the benefit of the community at large, and
which forbids sale on credit, and requires that food
be sold in every public house, has been adopted by forty-
six different towns in Sweden, and is said to be accom-
plishing a great reformation. Within eleven years the
licenses were reduced in Gothenburg by one-half. That the
traffic is fraught with danger to the community, and that it
is wrong for a man to draw profits from the vices of his
fellows, are principles which are becoming extensively
conceded. The way, therefore, is becoming more open
for the limitation and suppression of the evil by the strong
hand of legislative enactment. But, perhaps, of all the
remedies proposed, the simplest, most rational, and most
effective is the principle of personal abstinence from that
which is the producing cause of all the mischief. Moral
suasion being the mode of its propagation, it is least
of all objectionable. It may be said that it has had a long
trial, but has failed to accomplish its object. The answer
is, that people generally have not tried it. As far as it is
honestly tried, it must be a success. If people do not drink
that which intoxicates, they cannot become drunkards.
Were the leaders of society to adopt it, it would soon prevail.
It is steadily and effectually revolutionising the practices of
society in England and America, and banishing intoxicating
drinks as beverages from the table. Let the young who
have nothing to unlearn be trained in the practice of
abstinence, and let those who take it in moderation exercise
a little self-denial for the general good, and the work may
be said to be accomplished. Through the removal of
temptations, the altered tone of society, and the general


abstinence that would prevail, not a few who are now the
unhappy victims of the evil, would be encouraged to
emancipate themselves from its bondage, and this great curse
of modem society would be removed. But each one to his
own convictions, and those who cannot go thus far will, we
think, at least admit that it becomes them as good members
of society to lend in some way a helping hand in uprooting
this deadly Upas tree from our young community.
The Coming Generation. —That there is some serious
defect in the up-bringing of the young people of the
colony is only too painfully apparent. Happily we can
testify that many of our growing youth will compare favour-
ably with the young people in the great cities in older
countries, but at the same time, the fact of which we now
speak is a disquieting one. The papers keep telling us
from day to day that young men are in the habit of meeting
in groups during the evenings, in the crowded thorough-
fares, and at the street corners throughout the city and
suburbs, obstructing the footpaths, insulting respectable
passers-by, behaving rudely to females, and when opportunity
offers, opposing the police in their endeavours to maintain
order, and check evil-doing. “ Larrikinism,” which is the
term by which this style of conduct is known, is “ larking”
carried beyond all innocent or permissible limits. It
appears to be principally confined to the metropolis, and is
mainly traceable to idle habits, and the too free use of
stimulants, such as beer and brandy. There is but a step
between it and actual crime, and the mischief-making
larrikin of to-day runs the risk of being the criminal of
to-morrow. His Honor Sir Redmond Barry, than whom
there could be no more impartial witness, at the recent
session of the Central Court, remarked in his place as judge,
while passing sentence on two young men, that during
the session the bulk of the prisoners were young fellows,
who had seemingly been well educated, and had been put
to respectable trades, and that it said little for the influence
that education was exercising on the rising youth of the
colony that he was called upon from day to day to pass
sentence on young men like those who were at the time
before him. Judge Cope, another competent authority, in
recently passing sentence on a youth, convicted of stealing
two letters belonging to the General Post Office, and who

it appeared had passed with great credit several scholastic
examinations, remarked that he had often observed how
sadly wanting in good breeding many yonng men who
were well instructed in book learning appeared to be, and
that every sessions of late several such had been brought
before him, charged with criminal offences. Here then we
have an evil deeply to be deplored, and which demands the
adoption of prompt and wise remedial measures. Such
measures may be sought in the following directions ;
Ist. Home influences. Parental restraint and discipline
prudently exercised, would have a salutary influence in
checking the evil. This, it is believed, is much neglected.
In many instances too, home might be made much more
attractive. Numbers of young people spend their time
principally on the streets. 2nd. Improved education. Judge
Cope, in the case referred to, remarked that mere book
learning was inadequate to the formation of moral character.
It has been said that a man may be over-instructed, and
yet under-educated. It has been noticed of late years that
a large proportion of the criminals in the New England
States of America have been highly-educated persons. And
this will suggest the question to many, whether there may
not be a fatal defect in our present State school system.
The principal plea for the State undertaking a system of
free and compulsory education was, that it was wiser to
prevent crime than to punish it. Is the system proving
adequate to this % Will it ever do so, unless young people
be instructed in the love of truth, and honor and goodness,
by being taught their duty to their Creator and their
fellow-men 1 If, as Montaigne has said, the business of
education is fo regulate a man’s steps, how shall this be
accomplished without moral and religious training 1 3rd.
Ameliorating social agencies. The increase of suitable
places of resort for young men, such as Coffee Taverns, pro-
vided with unintoxicating beverages, suitable reading rooms
and libraries, innocent games and musical attractions, would
help materially as a corrective. 4th. Interference of the
law. Gangs of young men in the streets should be dispersed,
or made to move on. The punishment inflicted for dis-
orderly and riotous conduct might be made more deterrent
than it frequently is. sth. Female influence. It is a pity
that the influence of woman in deciding the morals of a


people is not better understood. In an article in a recent
number of Chambers' Journal, the remark is made: “If
English women would keep the young men of our towns
and villages waiting for wives until they gave up swearing
and drinking, a very wholesome reformation would soon be
effected among the godless and coarse youths of the country.”
Woman could not have a better or a nobler mission than
that of exercising by spotless example and by industrious,
quiet, homely ways, a refining and purifying influence on
the young men of our colony.
CHAPTER XXXIX.
A FINE COUNTRY FOR THE WORKING MAN ! IS IT ?
Is Victoria “ a fine country for the working-man V’ We
have heard a great deal about this of late. If we may
judge from the past, it has been anything but a bad one for
him. He has had many opportunities of making his way.
The avenues to competence and position have all stood
open and proved easy of access. Thousands of working-
men, who landed on these shores with little else of worldly
goods save what they stood up in, have, in the course of a,
few years, acquired property, attained to independence, and
risen to positions of influence in the community. But times
are changed. Gold is not to be picked up as in former
days. Money does not change hands with the lavish
thoughtlessness with which it was wont to do. Ad-
ventitious chances for getting on are not so frequently
turning up. Things move in more settled grooves, and
therefore independence and fortune must be sought for
with patience, labour, and endurance. All this is for the
better, in many respects. Fortunes made in a day were,
generally speaking, just about as rapidly squandered again.
Wealth acquired more gradually is likely to be more care-
fully retained.
The working-man who comes to the colony with the view
of bettering his position may possibly experience dis-
appointment for a time. This is hardly to be wondered at,
as he comes to a new state of things. He may find that
he has something to unlearn. He will also have a good deal
to learn. It is frequently difficult to get a start. A little


patience may need to be exercised. But the idea of failure
should never for a moment be entertained. He ought,
moreover, to be ready for anything that offers. That man
proves the most successful colonist who keeps wide-awake,
watching for opportunities, not over particular as to
the style of work to which he will turn his hand,
if only it be honest, ever ready to seize any tide that
may come to his feet. The writer has in his eye, at the
present moment, several successful colonists of his ac-
quaintance, each of whom has risen to position and wealth
by following a widely different calling from what he
was accustomed to follow in the old country. What is
true of these is true of hundreds of the prospei’oua men of
Victoria.
It is a difficult matter, generally speaking, for any one in
the home-country to step aside from the calling to which
he has been brought up. As a rule, he must stick to that.
He is looked upon ■as not being fit for anything else. If
an empty place occurs in some other line, it is of com-
paratively little use for him to attempt to step into it.
Besides, there are plenty seeking after it whose training
specially fits them for filling it. It is different here. If a
man chooses to quit the calling to which he has been
accustomed and take up another, he can have no difficulty
in doing so, provided that he keeps his eyes open, and his
hands ready, and is gifted with a fair share of adaptiveness.
The opportunity will come, he will be waiting to seize it, and
will at once find himself a step up the ladder.
If the advantages of the working-man in England and in
the colony be put into the scale, we think the balance will
be found in favour of the latter, on the following points :
Ist. Hours of labor. They are shorter in the colony than in
England. 2nd. Conditions of toil. The climate being
more genial, affords greater comfort in out-door work.
3rd. Wages. These are considerably higher. The Duke of
Manchester, in a recent speech at Hamilton, said ; —“ In
these colonies, as for wages, the working-men could earn
almost as much in a day in Victoria as many of them got in a
week in the old country.” 4th. Living. The working-man
lives better in Victoria than he did in England. Beef and
mutton, instead of being a rarity, are on his table at
almost every meal. Butter, cheese, almost every variety


of vegetable, and good fruit are indulged in by him.
sth. Dress. His family dress as well as those of res-
pectable tradesmen in the old country. 6th. Education,
His children get this free, in common with the children of
all classes of the community, and by paying a little, as
many a working-man does, he can secure for them the
higher education as well. 7 th. Status and promotion.
The intelligent, well-doing working-man secures the esteem
of all classes of the community. He take his place and
exerts his influence in public movements. The way is
open to him to rise. He occasionally finds his way into the
Parliament of his country. Bth. Children’s prospects.
Young people who choose to learn a trade, and who are in-
dustrious, well-behaved, and economical, have little or no
difficulty in getting a start in business in comparatively
early life. It is no uncommon thing for the sons of working-
men to enter the mercantile establishment, or the bank, or
to follow one of the learned professions. They are to be
found in large numbers among the merchants, squatters,
and leading public men of the day.
While we say these things, we are stating simply what
we believe to be the truth. We do not mean to tell any or
every working man in England that he ought to come here.
The Rev. Thomas Jones, late “ poet preacher,” of Melbourne,
is reported to have said, at a meeting of welcome on his return
to his beloved Wales ; “ The country is England over again,
and many of you working men could do a very much worse
thing than go there.” We quite agree with him, but at the
same time all that we contemplate is placing such facts
before working-men, who are making inquiry as to the
colony, as will help them to form correct opinions on the
matter.
One thing we do not hesitate to say, and that is, that there
are some people who ought not to come to the colony. Un-
practical and impracticable men, who live in a world of their
own creation, a dream-land of theories and fancies; men
who have failed in everything they have tried; “ waiters
on Providence,” alias “ do-nothings fast-living youths, of
whom nothing could be made at home, and who are simply
incorrigible idlers and spendthrifts; men devoid of adapt-
ability, who can only walk in old grooves, and who shut
their eyes to everything strange or new ; spiritless and

aimless men ; for all such we apprehend the best thing is to
stay where they are. The colony is not a place for them.
But on the other hand, men who are actuated by an
honourable ambition to get on in the world, and improve
the circumstances and prospects of their families ; men who
are not afraid of a little roughness at first, or of hard toil;
men who can suit themselves to new conditions of things,
and take advantage of them; men who are inspired by
feelings of manly independence ; men who have some in-
dividuality to develope ; to all such this and the adjacent
colonies present fields of enterprise, advancement, and use-
fulness, probably equal to any to be found in the world.

sons. The proportion in England is one to every 1,854. The
greater proportion in this colony to that of England is ex-
plained according to Dr. Paley by the fact that a number of
inoffensive patients of weak minds are admitted to the
asylums here from hospitals or who in England would be
dealt with as paupers, and sent to the poor house.

Our Colony in 1880.


CHAPTER XLI.
SUNDRY FACTS OF INTEREST.
The colony has had thirteen Governors and Acting-
Governors, including the present. Since it became an
independent colony the average time during which the
Governors have held office, prior to Lord Normanby, is
four years and four months.
Since the introduction of responsible government, nine-
teen ministries have held office. The average duration of
ministries, prior to the installation of the second Graham
Berry Ministry, was about one year and three months.
The eleventh Parliament was opened on the 27th July,
1880.
The total military establishment, exclusive of the staff,
as given in the Year Book, was 3,806. The total number
of rifles in use was 3,027, and of guns 141. The Martini-
Henry is the rifle in general use.
The Victorian naval forces consist of the war-ships Cer-
berus and Nelson, and the steam-sloop Victoria : and also
of a Naval Reserve, a small fee being given as a retainer
to the men who form it. The forces numbered in officers
and men, including boys, 424, with 53 guns and 530 small
arms.
The military and naval expenditure amounted to
£121,266 4s. 5d., of which £34,289 2s. sd. went towards
defences in connexion with Sir W, Jervois’ report. During
the last twenty-four years £2,327,394 have been expended
in connexion with the defences of the colony.
State annuities, amounting in the aggregate to £33,242,
were being drawn by 193 persons One gentleman has
been drawing £IOOO a-year for the last twenty-seven years.
The colony occupies only a six-hundredth part of the
esut'bh’s surface, and contains, a seventeen-hundredth of its
population.
Aliens residing in Victoria, on taking the oath of
allegiance to Her Majesty, may receive letters of natural-
ization. During the year letters were granted to 72
persons, of whom 43 were Germans.
The proportion of members of Parliament to the popu-
lation as about 1 to every 10,000 persons ; the proportion


ill England is only 1 to every 50,013. Were the pro-
portion to population that obtains in England applied in
Victoria, we should have only 16 members. Out of every
7 males, over 21 years of ago, 5 hold electoral rights.
Six-sevenths of the interest on the public debt of the
colony is payable in London, and one-seventh in Melbourne.
Since 1851 over two millions have been expended on
immigration.
Exclusive of the money expended by local bodies on
public works, roads, etc., the large sum of thirty-five
millions sterling has been expended on railways, roads,
bridges, water-supply, and other works, by the Government,
during the past twenty-eight years.
During the year, 25 persons died through sunstroke,
0 through snake and insect bite, and 87 committed
suicide.
Probates and letters of administration in connexion with
the estates of deceased persons have been issued during
foui'teen years to the amount of close on twenty-five
millions sterling. The average value of each estate in
connexion with which they were granted in 1878 was
.£2,177,
The number of insolvencies during the year amounted to
1,007, with liabilities to the extent of £1,665,485, and assets
to the extent of £1,204,051.
Of the number taken into custody for drunkenness during
the year, about 6,500 were Protestants, 5,000 Roman
Catholics, 11 Jews, and 17 Pagans.
The, value of the crops raised during the year ending 31st
March 1879 , was close on five millions sterling.
The gross value of pastoral produce during 1878-9
amounted to considerably over eight and a quarter millions
sterling.
Improvements in the introduction of machinery, the
erection of buildings, and other works, have been effected
on farms and stations to the value of nearly seventeen
millions sterling.
Since 1854 patents for inventions have been applied for
to the number of 2,628.
Copyrights in connexion with literary works, not including
dramatic and musical, have been registered to the extent of
681.


The London Bankers' Magazine, in a recent issue, stated
that while the deposits in the Bank of England do not reach
quite £ls a head of the population, in Australia they reach
£2O per head.
At a distribution of prizes in one of the State schools,
Major Smith, the Minister of Public Instruction, stated
that since 1851 there had been expended on public schools
£5,549,410 ; on the Melbourne Public Library, £280,316 :
on the University, £339,000 ; on public libraries (exclusive
of the Melbourne Library) and mechanics’ institutes,
£72,339 ; on National Museum, £47,932 ; and on colleges
and grammar schools, £39,998 ; making a grand total of
£6,328,995.
Mr. Ellery, in an address at the annual conversazione of
the Royal Society, stated that the statistics furnished by
Baron von Mueller, Government Botanist, showed that up
to the present time there have been recorded, as pertaining
to the flora of Australia, about 7,000 dicotyledonous, 1,600
monocotyledonous, and 1,900 acotyledonous species. Also
that the register of the National Museum of Natural
History in the University grounds records 44,600 speci-
mens completely classed and labelled.
It is estimated that after making an allowance of meat
for consumption by the population of Australia, there would
remain, according to present statistics, an annual surplus of
90,750 tons for exportation to Europe, which would re-
quire for its conveyance 302 steamers carrying 300 tons
each.
Steps were recently taken for the formation of a company
to work the coal-bearing sections at Cape Patterson, known
as Bury’s or Davis’s section, and which comprises 640 acres.
The Government awarded the sum of £I,OOO for the dis-
covery of two seams of coal in this section, one 4ft., and the
other 3ft. 6in. thick. R. C. Selwyn, Esq, Government
Geologist, reports the quantity of coal in this section to
amount to 3,400,000 tons per mile. The coal is said to be
of excellent quality, equal to the best coals from Newcastle,
N.S.W. It is stated that so soon as a railway of some
eight miles in length can be constructed, the company will
be able to deliver the coal in Melbourne at £1 per ton.
A juvenile exhibition was held in Melbourne during last
year, at which over 20,000 exhibits were displayed, and


which was visited by 170,000 persons. Prizes were given
to the extent of £1,500.
The sum of £30,000 was raised for the relief of the
famine in India, £4,000 for the relief of the famine in
China, and over £30,000 for the relief of the famine in
Ireland.
CHAPTER XLII.
OUR FUTURE : POSSIBLE AND PROBABLE!
Our “brief past” has been a story of wondrous develop-
ment; what shall be our future! Not being gifted with
prescience, we cannot tell; yet we may, on data within the
knowledge of our experience, venture to suggest. We
know some things that we do possess ; we know the cumu-
lative power and grasp of young communities; we know
the tenor and tendencies of men, and influences, and events ;
and from these we may argue a little, modestly and with
reserve it ought to be, and yet hopefully withal.
We have a climate that will stand favourable comparison
with the climate of any colony in the world ; we have soil
capable of yielding the principal products alike of temperate
and tropical regions ; we have broad lands waiting for the
plough and the spade ; we have vast plains on which com-
munities may settle which shall yet become hives of industry,
social comfort, and public usefulness; we have resources of
mineral and pastoral wealth ; we have the institutions and
agencies of education, political life, the press, the church,
and approved chax-ities ; we have an intelligent, industrious,
enterprising, and persevering people : we have all this,
and with this, what grand possibilities may lie in our
futux-e !
Our soil will continue to give up its gold. Mixxixxg has
settled down ixxto a steady industry, axxd improvements in
xxxachinery will be made from tixxxe to time. Axxd there is
every reasoxx to believe that xxxaxxy a bxilliant discovery will
be nxade ixx the future. The following announcement, taken
froxxx the Ballarat Courier a few days ago, looks like old times
come back again, axxd affordsagiimpseof the capabilities of our
axxriferous fields: —“ Nearly half a ton of gold was sexxt by oxxe
of the local banking institutions to the head office in Mel


bourne yesterday. The gold was principally the product of
the Hurdsfield mines, but a portion of it was from other
mines, and a little came from Stawell. It looks something
like remunerative mining to see nearly £IOO,OOO worth of
gold sent away in one parcel.” In our great wool-growing
interest we see steady development and progress. Mr.
William Armstrong, well known for his long-wool Lincoln
and Leicester sheep, has been trying the experiment of a
double clip, or shearing twice a year. We understand that
a heavier result is likely to be obtained from the two shear-
ings than from the one shearing of last year. In regard to
the quality of the wool, which was the principal object con
templated by the experiment, we believe his anticipations
have been fully realised. Of course, the long-wool breeds
alone have been experimented upon. At the annual show
of the Australian Sheepbreeders’ Association, held at the
close of August last, His Excellency the Governor is
reported to have said that he had had many opportunities
of seeing the best sheep produced in the colonies, and so far
as his judgment went, he had never seen better sheep than
those exhibited at this year’s show ; and Sir Samuel Wilson
is reported to have said that he had never seen such sheep
as were then exhibited, and that he believed that they
would continue to improve in the future as they had done
in the past, and that what were now looked upon as high-
class sheep would, in twenty years time, be regarded as
only moderate animals. There is no more interesting or
remarkable story of development in recent times than what
is furnished in the growth and expansion of the pastoral
industry. In the Australasian colonies the number of sheep
last year amounted to 61,066,100, while the experts of wool
reached a grand total of 316,293,3871 b., the value of which
may be set down as over sixteen millions of pounds sterling.
When these colonies shall have become one dominion, as
may be hoped for at no distant day, and the far interior
shall be made easily and speedily accessible by steam and
rail, it may be expected that peaceful woolly flocks will
roam and thrive through vast territories that now constitute
but “ a lone land;” and this greatest of our industries will
assume dimensions of which at present we have but small
conception. In the department of agriculture there is
abundant scope. Modes of farming will be improved. The


co-operative system, when better understood, will be brought
to bear on districts where capital is limited, and enterprise
consequently hindered. The burden now lying on many of
the implements of farming will be lessened or removed.
Labour will become cheaper, and that not to the detriment
of the condition of the labourer himself. Stock will be fed
with a view to the home market, which will soon be acces-
sible through the refrigerating process. Through proper
systems of water conservation, lands which are now occupied
will be greatly increased in fertility, while many districts
now arid and unproductive, will, like similar ones in Italy,
Portugal, Egypt and elsewhere, which, in their natural
state, seem to be little else than desert sand, be transformed
into fruitful farms and gardens. Other forms of vegetable
growth will be introduced. There is a wide field for the
selection of plants for naturalization, with a view to indus-
trial culture. Mr. Theodore Piesse, of the firm of Piesse
and Lubin, lately invited attention to the fact that those
particular flowers which are of greatest value in the manu-
facture of perfumery grow luxuriantly under Australian
skies. Dr. Schomburgh, of Adelaide, and Baron Yon
Mueller, our own Government Botanist, have called atten-
tion to the suitableness of our climate and soil for flower
farming. The English perfumery manufacturers are almost
entirely dependent upon Continental growers, and could our
gardeners and farmers, who have some knowledge of the
matter, be induced to enter upon it with spirit, the sphere
of capital and labour would be considerably widened, and
our export trade would soon exhibit a sensible expansion.
Why should not the rose-fields of Roumelia, the thyme and
rosemary gardens of Nimes, and the perfumery farms which
have been such a source of industrial wealth to the south
of Europe, be reproduced here. We saw it recently stated
that one enterprising farmer in a northern district had been
so successful in growing canary seed that he had put fifty
acres under crop this year, with every prospect of a good
return. This is in the right direction. When the principle
is better understood that plant culture should he regulated by
fitness of sod and climate, we shall enter on a new era of
tillage. According as soil is suitable, the mulberry and olive,
rice and arrowroot, the date palm and the tea plant, the
lemon and orange, the osier and the cork tree, and others


of like character will cover our plains, and prove a source
of employment and profit to thousands.
While discussing prospects of the future, special mention
must be made of the impetus that will be given to our export
trade through the discovery of the refrigerating process.
When the Strathleven arrived at London with her cargo of
frozen meat, and succeeded in turning it out sweet, sound,
and toothsome, a great question was solved. The broad
pastures of the Australian continent, practically, at least
for generations to come, may be said to be illimitable in
their capabilities for the production of beef and mutton,
while to millions in England these articles of food are at
present positive luxuries ; but the experiment of the Strath-
leven has shown how the superabundance of the one may
be made to supply the lack of the other. Jt is satisfactory
to be told by competent authorities that, while the exporta-
tion of frozen meat to England will remunerate the exporter,
at the same time it will not affect our resoui'ces here to such
an extent as to raise the market price of meat. One influ-
ential company has already been formed in Melbourne for
the purpose of prosecuting the enterprise, and it is to be
hoped that all necessary precautions will be adopted both as
to the quality of the meat and the method of preparing it
for transportation, so that the embryo trade may not be
crippled or injured, by mistakes that would alarm timid
investors here, or create prejudices at home. It would
appear that other articles of food besides beef and mutton
are to be embraced in the new mode of export. It is an-
nounced that arrangements are being made in London for
the importation of butter and vegetables by the same pro-
cess. The Farmer, which ought to be a reliable authority,
says that these articles can be taken across the seas in such
a condition that when thawed they will prove as sound and
good as any that can be obtained in the market in England.
In harmony with the expansion of the pastoral, agricul-
tural and other industries of which we have been speaking,
will be the development of manufactures. Those which have
already been established will be extended in their operations,
while others will be originated as circumstances may require.
A good deal has already been done in this direction. It
may be reasonably expected that the Exhibition will supply
no small stimulus to further effort. Our artizans, our

capitalists, and our men of enterprise will take note of the
objects of foreign manufacture which are specially suited to
our climate and our requirements, and in due time many of
them will be imitated, or, it may be, improved upon here.
And may we not anticipate that at no distant future, the
five colonies at least on our great Australian continent,
instead of struggling on in their isolated individuality, will
lay aside their little jealousies, and drawn to each other by
common interests, common aims, and common brotherhood,
unite in the formation of one grand empire ; possibly to be
represented in the great Parliament of its Fatherland, and
which will open for itself new channels of trade and com-
merce with the thousand islands which cluster in adjacent
seas, and with the remoter nations of America, China, and
Japan.
There is, however, one factor in our future prosperity,
whose presence is indispensable. That is a steady inflow of
population. Without this our progress must be in very
limited measure. In one sense, this is almost everything,
inasmuch as the other principal conditions of expansion
and wealth already exist among us. Thinking heads and
brawny arms alone can build up the fabric of our national
prosperity and greatness. Every new comer is at once a
producer and a consumer. There can be no more selfish or
short-sighted policy tlian that of discouraging capital and
labour from coming to our shores. It simply means losing
our position as “premier colony,” and being left behind in
the race of young nations. Let reasonable facilities be given
so as to induce the right class of people to come to us from
Great Britain and other old world countries, and the depres-
sion which has so long hung over us will pass away, the
throbbings of a new life will be felt in our community,
a fresh impulse will be given to all our material interests,
and an epoch of higher progress will dawn.
And in what may be called the yet higher interests of the
colony than those we have been speaking of, we may, we
think, anticipate steady progress. The intellectual, moral,
and religious forces that are at work warrant this. Defects
in our educational system will be remedied, and the forma-
tion of character by moral and religious training will be
conceded its legitimate place. The forwardness, abruptness,
and assumption which have been complained of as charac


teristic of numbers of our young people in the past will be
supplanted by becoming diffidence, polite breeding, and
deferential respectfulness towards superiors and seniors. In
the training of our young women, the true end of education
will acquire growing prominence. They will be taught that
life has higher aims than mere pleasure-taking or personal
display, and that cultivation of good qualities of heart and
homely virtues will make them far moi’e truly attractive
than mere smartness of style, or superficiality of attainment.
While receiving the advantages of high intellectual culture,
it will not be forgotten that woman’s noblest distinction
is to be found in the domain of the affections ; that she
awakens reverence and chivalry by the unselfishness and
sympathy of her disposition, the sweetness and purity of
her character, and the goodness and gentleness of her ways ;
and that her truest mission, whether in the capacity of
daughter, wife, or mother, is that of making home the abode
of refinement, comfort, and happiness; thus exhibiting
through life the beautiful realization of the words of the
late Canon Kingsley :
Be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever ;
Do noble things, not dream them all day long ;
So making life, death, and that vast forever,
One grand, sweet song.
The vulgar love of fashionable display with its consequent
extravagance and dissipation—the natural result of sudden
wealth—will give place to a simpler and chaster style of
living, and to more of a benevolent regard for the well-
being of others, and the world’s progress. The reckless
speculation and doubtful practices which have been charac-
teristic of certain departments of business in the past will
gradually disappear, as a healthier moral tone prevails in the
community ; and probity, honour, and good faith will assert
their right to rule in the operations of commercial life. The
fountains of our literature, philanthropy, charity, and social
progress will become purified by the greater infusion of single-
ness of purpose, and that “ good-will towards men,” which
is taught by a heaven-descended faith. The horizon of the
spiritual, now somewhat overcast, will become brighter and
more serene. Out of confusion will come order. Agnosticism,
materialism, “ intellectual-all-in-all”-ism, new theories of life,
and certain “ tendencies” in “ modern thought,” may by the
138

novelty of their speculations, and the boldness of their assump-
tions find audience for a time, but being totally inadequate
to supply food for the hungering soul of humanity, their
proffered delicacies will turn to “ dead sea apples” on the
lips. As for true science, there can be only one issue, and
that the confirmation of the Christian faith. Christianity
will go forward leavening all society with its refining and
ennobling influences, for “a little leaven leaveneth the
whole lump,” The antagonistic forces that now threaten it
are shallow and self-exhausting, and the cycle of them,
though dark meanwhile, and to some minds ominous of
direst evil, will soon be run ; but the forces of Christianity
are exhaustless and cumulative evermore, and will yet flood
our land and the world with sunshine, joy, and beauty.
It may be said that this is word-painting —a sketch,
couleur de rose. Granted. Yet it is our opinion and
expectation. We claim nothing more for it. But if
progress mean anything at all, and if the world be
destined to go forward, what we have said is all in the
legitimate and reasonable line of its advancement. We
have a faith, and it is at least a pleasant one. We believe
that a harvest-time will come after all the sowing that is
going on. We believe that evil will be worsted in the
fight. We believe that truth and goodness will win the
day. We believe that halcyon times await the world after
the strife and the storm. Only let all good men be
faithful and true, toiling on cheerily in dependence on an
arm before which all other strength is weakness. That is
all. The rest will follow.

AMONG the recent improvem3nts of Melbourne Street Architecture
may be noted the Building erected in
COLLINS STREET EAST,
OPPOSITE THE BANK OP VICTORIA.
One of these is the Shop occupied by
Mr. MULLEN, the Well-known Bookseller.
It is 109 ft. x 21ft. x 14ft. high, and behind it is a special apartment, 28ft, x
14ft, x 13ft. high, devoted to educational works. Above this is a book store
of similar size. Mr. Mullen’s premises are so arranged that in the cold 'wintry
weather his custom-
ers can be warmed
and cheered by the
fires, which may now
daily be seen burn-
ing brightly in his
extensive library. At
the remote end is
the Circulating Li-
brary, the well-
known “ Melbourne
Mudie’s.” The book-
shelves are faced
with polished kauri
pine, crowned by a
Grecian cornice of
the same material,
and these and other
fittings, contrasting
with the generally
dark covers of the
books, give a bright
and pleasing look to
the whole. Over the
library is a large sky-
light, which gives an
appearance of lofti-
ness to the premises.
The east wall is co-
vered with well-filled
shelves of books,
classified and so ar-
ranged as to invite
the attention and in-
terest of the book-
hunter. The sta-
tionery department
forms a feature on
the west side, adjoin-
ing the library, while
the centre is filled up
with glass cases con-
taining handsomely-
bound books and
other articles de
luxe. At the end of
the shop a short
staircase leads the
visitor to the educa-
tional department,
where college and
school books are kept,
as well as an as-
sortment of books
in the various con-
tinental languages.
In this room also is
the counting-house,

I
so arranged as to overlook the whole premises. Over the educational
department is a store for reserve sU.'ck, which is conveyed thither by
means of an American hoist, a simple machine, now coming into general use
in Melbourne. A cellar below runs under the whole length of the premises,
and affords ample room for opening consignments of goods, and for storing
the library duplicates. These are sent upstairs by means of ingeniously-
contrived lifts, which deposit their burdens under the counters above. A
post pillar-box is erected near the entrance of the shop. This is cleared by
the post-office pillar-men five times a day. It has proved a great con-
venience to visitors to Melbourne.— Sketclier .
