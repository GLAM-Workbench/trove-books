Since 1916, when McPher-
son’s Pty. Ltd., commenced
the manufacture of Lathes,
over 6,000 Lathes have
been made in sizes ranging
from 5 inch centres to
Brake Lathes, 19 tons in
weight.
From time to time, the
Works have been enlarged
to cope with the wider
range of sizes undertaken.
Four acres have been set
aside for present and
future operations. High-
grade Machine Tool Plant
is continually being in-
stalled in accordance with
modern Lathe manufacture
practice.
We appreciate the co-
operation and advice ten-
dered by users, as we are
thus enabled to design and
build Macson Lathes
with due regard for actual
Australian requirements.

works in conjunction with
the cross feed screw. The
attachment can be quickly
set for varying tapers. An
end clamp makes it possible
to turn tapers at any desired
position within the capacity
of the lathe.

Although the application to different size
lathes differs slightly, generally it is as
shown below. On Cone Head lathes the
pump is driven from the counter shaft.

In the case of large
lathes the motors are
mounted on a cast iron
pedestal with a sup-
porting arm to the
lathe bed.
Where practicable motor drives are
mounted in the rear of the lathe beds,
in a planed facing and in such a way
that adjustment of the motor drive can
be made if required.
Guards are placed over driving chain
or "V" belt drive, and friction clutch
controls brought to the front of the
headstock conveniently placed for the

Tested by Works Manager
TESTING MACSON LATHES
Each lathe is put under a running test
before leaving the Works. The test is
carefully checked by a senior Works
official. The three main tests are:—
Turning Test.—A flanged testing
barrel with flanged end is attached
to the faceplate and no support is
given from the tailstock centre.
After the cuts have been taken the
barrel is checked with a micro-
meter and a recheck is made with
a dial indicator. The error is
marked on the test sheet.
Facing Test.—A plain test plate is
attached to the faceplate and cuts taken
across the plate. A straightedge test is
then made and a recheck made across
the straightedge (not shown in illustra-
tion) with the dial indicator.
Height of Centres. —A hardened steel bung is
placed in the spindle hole and a hardened
hollowed punch is inserted in the tailstock barrel.
An allowance of .001 is between the diameter of
the hole in the bung and the punch, and when
the punch is brought up to the bung a test card
is inserted and a wad is cut out showing that
the height of the centres are within this
tolerance.
