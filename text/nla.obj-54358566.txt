Win. Bridges respectfully intimates to his patrons and the public that he has secured the above
central and extensive premises, where he exhibits his Haydon Collections, concentrated into
One (baud Display of over Tliree Hundred Works of Art by tlie Old masters
and many Prize and Hold Medal Pictures by some of the Greatest Academ-
icians of Europe —forming the Most Instructive and Costly Private Collection
In the Southern Hemisphere.
Wm. Bridges opened the first Picture Gallery in Victoria, and has devoted over twenty-eight
years and expended a fortune collecting those rare treasures. The liberal patronage accorded in the
new premises is daily increasing, a result which encourages Mr. Bridges to hope that intending sub-
scribers will at once secure tickets in his Art Union, and enable him to publish an early day for the
drawing, as notified, three days after remaining tickets are sold. The shareholders’ interests are amply
protected by insurance to the amount of £lO,OOO, secured by Mr. Bridges on his property now in the
Haydon Gallery of the ascertained aggregate value of £50,000. It is with the utmost deference that
Mr. Bridges reminds the public that he has paid thousands of pounds for advertising this present Art
Union, together with other necessarily heavy expenses, involving a tax far in excess of any profits or
benefits that may reasonably be expected to accrue, owing to the protracted, yet unavoidable, delay of
over three years.
Tlie Prizes in Bridges’ legal Bona fide Art Union consist of Sixty-three
Pictures, pronounced by able experts to be most rare and valuable, and full value for £lO,OOO.
FIFTY PRIZES IN 10,000 SHARES OF £1 EACH.
If Prize Winners desire to sell, the following amounts are guaranteed after the drawing:—Two at
£lOOO each, two at £5OO each, four at £250 each, two at £l5O each, six at £lOO each, eight at £5O
each, six at £3O each, and twenty at £2O each.
For Tickets, Prospectuses, and full information apply to the Head OlHce, Art Exhibition,
37 COLLIIS STREET EAST (opposite Bank of Victoria), MELBOURNE.
March, 1884. letters promptly answered. WM. BRIDGES, PROPRIETOR.
Kg” William Bridges has spent more money for the encouragement and advancement of
Art in Victoria than any other man. His integrity has stood the test of slanderous attack, and he still
defies insinuating imputations, and invites the strictest scrutiny.

COGNAC DISTILLER?, 7ARRA BANE.
The following is the Analysis of Dr. Kit'hland respecting Spirits the produce
of the above Distillery
Medical School Laboratory, University, 9th May, 1882.
At the request of JOHN CURTAIN, Esq., Cogndc Distillery, Yarra Bank, I have examined a
considerable number of samples of Whisky, Rum, Brandy and Gin, taken at random from the
bonded Warehouse of the Cognac Distillery by my assistant. Some twelve (12) Imperial pints were
used for the purpose of detecting “fusel oil” or other noxious materials if such were present. From
the results obtained by me, I find that the various spirits have been well rectified and are fully
prepared. They are free from “ fusel oil ” and are sound and wholesome.
JOHN DRUMMOND KIRKLAND, M.8., Ch.B., Analytical Chemist.
The flattering opinions expressed by members of the Tariff Commission on their visit of inspec-
tion to my Distillery (vide daily papers 6th April last), together with the above analysis, will show
the merchants, grocers, and hotelkeepers that the spirits I make are not only pure and wholesome,
but of such flavour as to be favourably compared with the best imported brands.
A call at the Distillery, where samples and prices may be had, will well repay the trouble.

WILLIAMS’S
Improved Hop and Wool Press.
No invention has given greater satisfaction than these
little machines, they are much valued by Sheep Farmers,
Selectors, and Hop Growers. In every show, where
exhibited, this press carried
FIRST HONOURS AGAINST ALL COMERS.
Out of a large number sold during the last two years we
have not received one single complaint, but on the con-
trary, several letters have reached us testifying to their
efficiency. The following is but one sample of letters
to hand:—
Experimental Farm, Cashel, 7/2/84,
To Mr. Price Williams. Sir, —I have great pleasure in stating that the
Patent Woolpress, purchased from you this season by the above Farm, has given
entire satisfaction; it is very simple in construction, portable, can be shifted to
any position, it is powerful and easily worked, can be handled with a man and
boy, and makes capital bales. This little Machine fills a great want which was
hitherto much felt by Farmers and small wool sheds; it is really a useful article,
and supplied at a reasonable price. All that have seen it at work admire its
simplicity, it only wants to be better known and you are certain to have great
demand for them. Yours faithfully,
M. HERDMAN, Manager.

IMPROVED HAY PRESS
This Machine is invaluable to Hay growers on a large
scale. Hitherto hydraulic presses were the only machines
used for hay pressing, but owing to their heavy cost farmers
usually sold their hay to dealers at a great disadvantage.
Two (2) men with Williams’s Press can reduce a truss of hay
to one-third its original size without scarcely any loss of
time, and when thus prepared the producer can export his
own crop as well as the dealer.
The cost is most reasonable.
