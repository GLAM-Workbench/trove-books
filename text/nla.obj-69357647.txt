PREFACE.
It appears that our Institution was founded at Knarsborough
Castle, in England, on the 29th October, 1745, under the title
of Royal Foresters, by which name it continued until, at a
Grand Convention of Delegates, held at Rochdale, in August,
1834, it was changed, and is now known as the Ancient Order
of Foresters. Our Institution was founded for the purpose of
assisting each other at times when, but for the helping hand of
cur Brethren, woe might sojourn for a much longer period in our
dwellings. For this and other ends we associate and are bound
by a solemn tie to act towards, and alleviate the sufferings of,
each other as Brethren. To cheer and protect the unfortunate,
to sympathise with and aid those whom accident or disease may
overtake, and to dry the cheeks of the mourner, are among the
leading objects of Forestry. To provide against the calamities
just adverted to, is, though great, not the only benefit resulting
from our associated Brotherhood, Besides uniting to render less
trying the vicissitudes of human existence, we assemble to pro-
mote the social happiness of our Brethren, and relieve our minds
from the pressure of care by temperate interchange of ideas.
A good Forester is a man who, jealous of his rights as a citizen,
maintains them in a temperate, manly, and decorous manner.
Knowing his duties, he performs them well, and pays a ready
and willing obedience to his country?s laws?neither cringing or
servile on the one hand, nor wild and factious on the other. In
his private character as a father, son, or husband, he fulfils all
claims with scrupulous fidelity.
Benevolence and friendship are our objects?justice and
morality our characteristics.


FORESTRY AND ITS PRINCIPLES.
That ?Unity is Strength? is by all men confessed
We in this Order should be so impressed,
Being bound by ties, from which, if borne in mind,
Many an aching heart will comfort find!
To sympathize?to aid a brother?s cause?
Is one of Forestry?s great moral laws;
Brothers in need our sympathy require,
Or, being sick, our kindlier thoughts inspire?
To cheer the couch, to ease each pressing care
From wife and child, which on them oft-times bear
When by disease a brother is bow?d down,
Or grim death knocks, and straightway claims his own
The husband dead!?the wife of help bereft!
Perchance some nurseling in her charge is left
To grow in years, without a father?s care,
With widow?d mother the world's frowns to share;
?Tis then a Forester his duty knows?
To help alleviate the mourners? woes.
If by misfortune brothers be oppressed,
Our duty?s still to help our own distressed.
In doing this?our duty?bear in mind.
To give is right, if with it we be kind;
Simply to give from an o?erflowing store,
Is charity indeed, but nothing more;
With rich or poor, to help without pretence,
In all exemplifies Benevolence !
Unity, Sympathy, Benevolence, combined
Another sentiment will call to mind?
One that at all times in our midst should dwell,
And every unkind feeling there dispel,
We each propose?our own ideas suggest?
Our own ideas are not always the best
With patience hear, then, each their thoughts unfol
Nor form your judgment till each tale is told
Bear and forbear will realise the word,
That peace to us will give and bring CONCORD
These sentiments at heart, let each resort
Oft to his own or any other COURT,
To learn, to teach, that no one may deny
We do to all as we would be done by.
These sentiments of our noble Institution are addressed to the
Brothers of the U.M.D.
theirs, very truly in the bonds of the Order,
F. T.e PLASTEIEB,
March 23kd, 1862, District Secretary.


GENERAL LAWS
OP THE
UNITED MELBOURNE DISTRICT
OF THE
(DrEur of Jforrsins
FEIENDLY SOCIETY.
Amended and Adopted at District Meetings held on the 21st,
22nd, 24th, 25th, and 26th August, 1874-
All governments and societies of men do, in the process of long time,
gather an irregularity, and wear away much of their primitive institution.
And, therefore, the true wisdom of all ages hath been to review, at fit
periods, those errors, defects, or excesses that have insensibly crept into the
public administration; to brush the dust off the wheels, and to oil them
again; or, if it be found advisable, to choose a set of new ones. And this
reformation is the most easily, and with the least disturbance, to be effected
by the society itself, no single man being forbidden by any magistrate to
mend his own manners, and much more, all societies having the liberty to
bring themselves within compass.?Andrew Marybl,
