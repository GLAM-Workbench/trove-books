THE COAL RESOURCES OF QUEENSLAND.
There is probably no part of the world where the coal
deposits are developed so extensively and uninterruptedly
as on the eastern side of the continent of Australia. It
is only recently that this fact has been ascertained,
and outside Australia it is scarcely at all known. One
cause of this is that the eastern side of the continent is
divided between two colonies, the Governments of which
work independently of each other. Moreover, the colony
of Queensland is not by any means completely explored
in its northern portions, and even where explored geo-
graphically the geological formation has often long re-
mained hidden. However, within the last few years the
colonists of Queensland have done much to ascertain
the mineral riches of a great portion of the territory.
This has resulted in the discovery of many large and
valuable fields of coal. These discoveries have been so
recent that they have hardly had time to become gene-
rally known, or if they had they could not have failed to
command attention. The colony is so near to the Indian
and Chinese ports, as well as those of the Pacific Islands
within the tropics, that it is sure to secure an extensive
coal trade Avhen its resources are known. This pamphlet
is therefore published in order to supply the requisite
information.
Pirst of all it may be necessary to point out what
the carboniferous resources of Australia are, in order to


show that the extent and uniformity of its coal-beds are
probably unrivalled in the world.
Geology. ?lt is well known that the main mountain
chain of Australia is on the eastern side of the continent.
At the north and south ends of this cordillera there is
scarcely more than two or three miles between it and
the Pacific Ocean. Towards the centre of the continent,
or about the tropical line, the dividing range sweeps
inland, leaving an immense area of river plains 200 or
300 miles wide intervening between the continental
plateau and the sea. It may be generally stated that on
the area of river plains, whether wide or narrow, coal is
found. It does occur, or signs of it occur, on the plateau,
or on the western slopes of the interior, but sometimes
not of good quality or in payable quantity. Thus prac-
tically, as far as it is known, the whole of the interior of
Australia is destitute of coal, and this applies to the
south side of the continent, such as the colony of Victoria
or South Australia.
Even where the strip of river plain between the
mountains and the sea is very narrow, there is still space
enough for the coal deposits to be rich and abundant.
Thus, at Bulli and the Illawarra country generally, the
mountain range comes within three or four miles of the
sea, and yet in the intervening narrow area very rich
coal-mines are developed. So also at the mouth of the
Hunter, where the celebrated Newcastle basin, with its
numerous collieries worked by various companies, is
found. It is also true, however, that, the more extensive
the area of plains between the mountains and the sea,
the larger the area within which coal is likely to be


found. Thus, in the basin of the Brisbane River, which
is also bordered by other extensive river basins, the coal
deposits are largely developed. What may be called the
Moreton Bay area, comprising many thousand square
miles, may safely be said to be one mass of coal deposits.
It is in this that the celebrated Ipswich collieries are
found, to which reference will presently be made. Again,
in the basin of the Fitzroy River, near B.ockhampton,
comprising that of the Dawson and Mackenzie Rivers,
there are constant indications of coal, though the locality
has not been tested, being much covered by as yet virgin
forests or scrubs.
From this it appears evident that Queensland is
likely to be more abundantly supplied with coal than
any other part of Australia, since no colony has so much
of that country within her limits in which coal is mani-
fested. The area of plain between the mountain system
and the sea is much wider and more continuous. Here-
after other coal districts will be specified besides those
mentioned, such as the Burrum River, the Burnett
basin, the Don, Bowen River, Endeavour River, &c.
History. ?When coal was discovered in New South
Wales in 1795, it did not excite much attention. Steam
navigation was unknown, nor was gas in use, and, as for
fuel, wood was more serviceable and easily procured.
Even much later in colonial history the carboniferous
riches of the colony were unheeded. In fact, it is within
only the last twenty years that the mines of New South
Wales have been extensively worked. There were many
causes for this, but one certainly was a prevailing
impression that the coal of Australia was a much newer


and younger coal than that of the true carboniferous
deposits of Europe, and that it was poor in quality and
would very soon he worked out. This arose from a
mistake by which all the coal fossils were regarded as of
one age. Specimens from widely distant localities and
very different deposits were mingled together, and natu-
rally pronounced to he of one formation by those who
examined them. Then again, the science of paleo-
botany was in its infancy. Many fossils now known to
have a wide range were then believed to be restricted to
newer and poor coal formations. Thus the deposits of
Australia were not regarded hopefully. However, as
they were explored, the plain facts established their cha-
racter. They are now extensively worked and have a
high reputation. Each year sees new collieries opened,
and each year announces new discoveries. Practically
there is no limit to the supply. The coal trade of New
South Wales is now one of the most important branches
of its commerce, many hundred thousand tons being
exported annually. At present also the colonies reap
another advantage from their coal resources. Ocean
steamers trade direct from Great Britain and other parts
of Europe and America, and postal subsidies are reduced
to a minimum, while the continuance of any subsidy
cannot he of long duration. This is owing to the fact
that steamers can coal in Australia as well and as
cheaply as in Europe.
Age of Australian Coal. ?The age of the coal in
Australia was for a long time a subject of dispute,
and this uncertainty was owing, as already stated, partly
to the mingling of specimens from different localities,


and partly from the imperfect state of paleo-hotanical
science. The matter may, however, he considered now
to he set at rest. One of those who have done much to
clear up the obscurity of the subject has been Dr.
O. Feistmantel, of the Indian Geological Survey, who
has shown pretty conclusively that some of our coal
deposits, the newest, are of Jurassic age, while others
extend through all the lower formations down to the
lower Carboniferous. Aided by Dr. Eeistmantel?s re-
searches, as well as by a personal inspection of all our
coal-fields, during which large numbers of new fossils
were collected, I have just concluded a thorough ex-
amination of the coal flora. The result has been to place
the Jurassic age of some of the beds in a much more
certain light. Moreover, intimate relations have been
discovered between the Indian coal-beds and those of
this continent. Genera, such as Ftilophyllum , which
have hitherto never been found out of India, have been
discovered in Queensland with other forms of JEquisetum
and Fhyllotheca , which belong to the Jurassic deposits
of Europe and Asia. In New South Wales the older
coals of Newcastle and Illawarra are of Permian and
Triassic age. They are overlaid by a thick sandstone
formation full of plant remains of Jurassic age. This
also contains many beds of shale, or impure coal of vege-
table origin, hut no coal of commercial value. The same
formation is abundantly represented in the colony of
Victoria, at Cape Otway, near Geelong,-and in Western
Victoria. Small and insignificant seams of coal occur,
hut never of sufficient thickness to he workable. In
Queensland the same formation covers the greater part


of the basin of the Brisbane Elver, and contains some of
the best coal-seams of the colony, including the abundant
carboniferous deposits of the Ipswich basin.
Prom this it will he seen how erroneous are those
conclusions which are formed on the experience of one
or more districts. As the Jurassic terrestrial formations
in many places in New South Wales and Victoria are
barren of coal, it has been concluded that coal in the
same beds need never he looked for. The beds in India
and Queensland are striking instances to the contrary.
I shall now proceed to notice rather more in detail
the various coal deposits of this colony.
IPSWICH BASIN.
The whole of the interior between the coast at
Moreton Bay and the dividing range consists of Oolitic
coal measures lying unconformahly upon highly inclined
paleozoic rocks, and covered by volcanic rocks in a few
places and by eolian sandstones in others. Moreton
Bay itself, with much of the low-lying shores and man-
grove islands, consist principally of alluvial deposits
brought down in the course of ages by the many streams
which here empty upon the coast. The deposits thus
accumulated are enormous, and they have modified in
a remarkable degree the geography of the coast; but
that these strata of alluvium rest principally on the
coal there can be no doubt. At Cape Moreton the
headland shows a good section of the coal-bearing
sandstones, having the usual dip of about II degrees.
The coal is met with in many places around Moreton
Bay and at a great number of localities inland. It


is not improbable that the whole of this area will be
found to contain coal, and being so close to the sea
must have hereafter an immense influence on the com-
merce of the country. At Ipswich, on the Bremer
Biver a little west of its junction with the Brisbane
Biver, about twenty-four miles from Brisbane, the
outcrops of seams of coal are numerous and rich, and
this locality has been in consequence the principal
centre of the coal-mining operations from an early period
in the history of the colony. The seams lie on each
side of the river valley, and at no great distance from
the bed of the stream. They have been disturbed by a
few faults, though the downward or upward shifting is
never more than a few feet. There is also a volcanic
dyke and an outflow of doleritic lava which seems to
mark a clear line of division between the coal deposits
on one side of the river and the other. Though the coal
varies somewhat in particular seams and at certain
collieries, it has a generally uniform character. It is a
bright bituminous coal, with veins of brighter lustre
running irregularly through it. It does not soil the
fingers nearly so much as some of the Newcastle coals,
and there is less of the mother-of-coal or mineral char-
coal between the bituminous seams. It ignites very
easily and burns freely, giving an oily dame and yielding
much black smoke. The percentage of ash is about an
average of 10, sometimes as low as 6. It is usually brittle
and breaks into cubical masses. The variations from
these characters will be given in speaking of the parti-
cular collieries. As a general rule it cokes well, and is
much esteemed both for gas and steam, being largely used


for both purposes in the colony. I do not propose to
deal in detail with all the collieries, hut shall mention
those which have the principal value and interest.
They may he divided into two groups, those which are
on the north and those which are on the south bank of
the Bremer Eiver.
Watertown Mine. ?-This is a colliery which is
being worked by two or three shafts, all on the north
side of the Bremer and very close to its hanks, and
where it is navigable for small craft. There is a shaft
upon the Garden seam which is about 7 feet thick and
crops out upon the surface. It has a dip of usually
1 in 5, south 15 to 20 degrees east. The coal
has a short fracture, breaks into small cubes, soils the
Angers, and is full of bright bituminous streaks. Since
the opening of this mine about 150,000 tons of coal
have been raised from different seams, all of which has
been used for steam purposes.
Of the coal from this mine Mr. A. C. Gregory,
Government Geologist, late Surveyor-General, reports:
?? The coal is a fairly hard coal, cokes well, and is a
good steam coal. The following is the analysis : Fixed
carbon 62, volatile hydrocarbons 25'2, ash 12 , 8.?
Above the seam there is about feet of splendid fire-
clay, which will no doubt be utilised in the course of
time.
The seams connected with the Watertown Coal-field
are the Edina, Eclipse, Tivoli, and Old Tivoli, which
will he referred to presently. The Bell seam, which is
about a mile from the Garden seam and belonging to the
same proprietor (Mr. Moffatt), is about 3-J feet thick.


It seems a more compact coal than the last, and is a
first-class coal for steam, gas, and coking. It is worked
by a drive like the Garden seam, about 200 yards long
and dipping 16 degrees, which is the dip of the seam, the
direction being south 15 degrees east. There is supposed
to be a fault between this seam and the Garden seam.
A seam which crops out near the latter, and which has
thinned out, may be the same. Its true position is sup-
posed to be 150 feet below the Garden seam. A new
drive has been made on an outcrop (supposed) of the
Garden seam about quarter of a mile from the
pit referred to last. It is extremely good coal, with
scarcely any partings in the seam. As far as the drive
has gone, which is about 30 yards, the coal is rapidly
improving.
On this property there is a large coking kiln which
has been in operation some eight years, and during
which some 4,000 or 5,000 tons of coke have been turned
out. The coke is made from the very fine slack and
dust. It is of splendid quality, and is exported to Rock-
hampton, Maryborough, and even Melbourne to the iron
foundries. It sells in Brisbane at about �1 17s. 6d. per
ton. The kilns are about half-a-mile away from the
Bell seam on an old drive which is not now worked, as
the coal was not found so good for coking as that
obtained from the newer shaft.
Bossend. ?The Rossend Mine (Lindsay?s) adjoins
this property. It is worked by one shaft to the extent of
about 20 tons daily, on what is supposed to be the Bell
seam. The proprietor has got the railway contract this
year for the supply of the Southern and Western Line,


at Bs. per ton. He derives his coal, however, from a
seam on the south side of the river, which will be
described further on.
The Tivoli Mine (Gulland?s), which, according to
Mr. Gregory, is a mine on the outcrop of the upper
seam, is a mass of coal some 5 or 6 feet thick. It is
bright and bituminous though brittle, and, like most of
the coal hereabouts, breaks, when much handled, into
small cubical pieces. It makes an excellent coke. Mr.
Gregory?s analysis gives specific gravity 1*35, volatile
hydrocarbons 27?, fixed carbon 66*, ash 7 per cent.
Tivoli. ?The Tivoli was until lately extensively
worked, as its proprietor had the railway contract, and
was able, by a short tramway with a steep incline and
shoot, to load all the lighters on the river. He has now
the contract for the Australasian Steam Navigation
Company, and finds it more convenient to work on
another seam on the south side of the river. On the
Tivoli Mine there is one shaft and three seams, and at
present it turns out about 50 tons daily. The Eclipse
Mine works on one seam of the old or original Tivoli,
and turns out about 20 tons a day.
j Eastwood. ?One very small mine may he added to
the above enumeration of those on the north side of the
river. This is the Eastwood Mine, hut at present it can
scarcely be said to he working, as it only turns out some
3or 4 tons daily. The seam is about 7 feet thick,
hut there are several thin hands of shale all having a
dip of 7 degrees to the south-east. The coal is bright
and bituminous but very brittle. The specific gravity,
according to Gregory?s analysis, is I*4o, volatile hydro-


carbons 25, fixed carbon 63, ash 12 per cent. It makes
an excellent coke. There is an outcrop of this seam in
the gully under the railway bridge, and it is below that
on the Old Tivoli by about 100 feet.
Northern Seams. Without entering more into
detail with regard to the collieries on the north side of
the Bremer, it may be stated generally that there are
probably five different seams at present worked. These
are ?1, Garden coal; 2, Edina coal ; 3, Tivoli ; 4, Old
Tivoli; 5, Bell coal. No geological survey has been made
in detail, and therefore no data can be given as to the
distances of these seams from one another. The faults
appear to be few and slight. The coal of these various
seams is of a uniform quality. It is easily ignited, burns
freely, and the amount of fixed carbon varies but little.
The average of many different analyses gives fixed carbon
60, volatile hydrocarbons 28, ash 8, water 1| per cent.
Practically it seems as if the supply was unlimited, and
all the conditions favour its being brought to market at
a cheap rate. The collieries are all less than a mile from
a navigable river. The dip of the seams is slight, so that
they are all worked by tunnels, thus enabling the coal to
be brought to grass at a small expense. The thickness
of the seams is just such as will be profitable without
requiring that expensive timbering which very thick
seams demand. There is no water to contend with, and
finally the slack coal can be all utilised for coke.
It may be added that the coal has been extensively
used for steam and gas purposes, and testimonials are
before me from a large number of masters and engineers
of steam vessels all speaking highly of the fuel, and some


preferring it to any other. Prom the engineers of the
Gasworks in Brisbane there is a statement that in a trial
of 71 tons the average was 9,286 cubic feet of gas
per ton, while in Ipswich the average was a little higher.
The coke weighed out nearly 13 cwt. per ton used.
Pounders of iron, with brass and locomotive engineers,
give equally valuable testimonials in its favour, while as
a house coal it is largely used.
Southern Seams. ?On the south side of the river
there are many workings on seams which appear to be
identical with those of the north, but nothing certain on
this point can be alleged, as no geological survey has
been made. There is a fault in the valley of the river
and a volcanic dyke. There is an undulating tract of
basalt, having a length of four miles south-west from the
Bremer River, and a breadth of two miles from Bundanba
Creek to the boundary of the town of Ipswich. The
carboniferous strata pass under the outflow, and they arc
sometimes considerably distorted for a short distance.
The basalt is a dolerite with olivine, magnetite, and
microliths of felspar. I need only mention some of the
principal workings for coal.
Thomas's Mine. ?Pormerly the main supply of
Ipswich coal was from the Redbank coal seam, about
eight miles east of Ipswich. The seam is nearly hori-
zontal with a slight southerly dip, from 3 to 6 feet thick,
and several bands of shale. The coal is brittle. At the
Six-mile Creek, on the Ipswich road, says Mr. Gregory,
there is a disturbance in the coal strata, the seams cropping
out at an angle of 30 to 40 degrees. This, however, is
only local, and the general disposition is nearly horizontal


until Bunclanba Creek is reached, where there is an anti-
clinal which brings the coal to the surface with a northern
and southerly dip. At this point the seam was worked; a
strong coal in a seam of 6 feet width, from 4 to 5
feet of which were available. To the south the seam
dips again for about a mile, according to Mr. Gregory?s
survey. It then rises again at an angle of 30, the out-
crop crossing the road on section 252, showing again 100
yards further south in a horizontal position with a thick-
ness of 6 feet, the outcrop on the face of the hill for a
quarter of a mile being very convenient to the railway
line. About a mile south and west of this outcrop a line
seam of coal is worked by Mr. Thomas, at Aberdare. It
is 8 to 10 feet thick, but giving about 5 feet of workable
coal, excellent for steam purposes; the percentage of
fixed carbon, volatile hydrocarbons, and ash being-
on an average respectively 63,'30, and 10. It cokes
fairly. The output from this mine is about 3,000 tons a
month, employing sixty miners. This colliery supplies
some Government contracts, the British India Mail
Company, the Melbourne S.S. Company, besides local
consumption.
New Chum Shaft. ?At Bundanba there is a colliery
worked by a pit (New Chum shaft), the property of
Mr. Gulland, who has the contract for supplying the
Australasian Steam Navigation Company. The shaft is
about 220 feet deep, tapping two seams, the lower one of
which only is worked. The latter shows in all about 27
feet of carbonaceous matter, but of this 4 feet to 4 feet
8 inches is good clean coal without any partings or shale.
The dip is about lin 9 a little east of south. About 120


tons arc daily produced from this mine. It is a good,
firm, shining coal, with much mother-of-coal in the part-
ings ; yet it does not soil the fingers as much as other coals
on this field. It is entirely sold for steam purposes with
the exception of the slack, which finds a ready market for
smiths? work. The shaft has been working about eleven
months. Mr. Gulland has other properties on both
sides of the river, and he calculates, from the report of
Mr. R. Henderson, Mining Engineer, that he has over
4,000,000 tons of coal available for mining purposes.
Lindsay's. ?The Braeside shaft is a mine of Mr.
Lindsay?s rather over a mile from the New Chum. It
is worked for the railway contract as already mentioned.
The workings are a drive along the seam which is 3 feet
thick. The coal is very similar to the last. The drive
is 280 yards long, and is provided with a tram on which
30 tons per diem are raised. There is another shaft close
by, 60 yards deep, on a second seam of a superior coal.
Of this 20 ions are raised daily.
Brisbane River. ?About two miles north-west of the
Old Tivoli Mine a large coal-seam is exposed on the bank
of the Brisbane River just above the Rocky Crossing. This
is a very thick seam, hut full of hands of shale extending
in all to 30 feet. Owing to the existence of better seams
in the neighbourhood, it is not worked, hut no doubt in
the course of time it will he better explored.
Southern Coal-fields. ?All around Pine Mountain
and Peak Mountain, and for a distance of many miles to
the south and west, there are outcrops of coal which are
still in need of exploration, and will hereafter consider-
ably add to the coal resources of Queensland.


Walloon Coal. ?About six miles west of Ipswich
and thirty miles from Brisbane is the Walloon Colliery.
The proprietary of the mine is Mr. J. Callaghan and Co.,
but a company is now being formed in England to work
the seams. These are three in number. The first crops
out on the surface with a dip to the south-west of
lin 9. The seam is remarkably compact, with about de-
fect of coal. The second seam is 50 feet below, with
5 feet 6 inches of good coal. A third seam is found 40
feet deeper, with a seam of about 5 feet thick. This coal
differs completely from all the other seams found around
Ipswich. It is perfectly clean and compact and does
not soil the hands. It is not brittle, so that there is little
or no slack in the handling. It has a smooth, bright,
jet-like lustre, with bright bituminous streaks. As a gas
coal it has no equal in the colony, and also as a house-
hold coal. It burns so freely that it may prove very
valuable as an oil coal. The average of a number of
proximate analyses would give a percentage of 50 fixed
carbons, 40 hydrocarbons, 6 of ash, 4 per cent, for loss,
moisture, and other ingredients. Some specimens do not
coke well; others yield about 50 per cent., bright and
well swollen up. At present there are about fifteen men
employed in the pit, but the extensive preparations that
have been made will necessitate the employment of a
great many more hands.
Materials for a tramway for coal-waggons have been
laid down. This tramway leads from the mouth of the
pit to the Walloon railway terminus, the distance being
about half-a-mile. When these operations have been
finished the promoters expect to raise at least 55


tons a day. The waggons are drawn from the pit by
means of a 12 h.p. standing engine, and run along iron
rails. A pump of sufficient power is erected on the
works, and only three hours? pumping daily is requisite
to keep the mine free from the influx of water.
The seam is worked by a drive which runs in a
south-westerly direction for about 132 yards, with a
dip of about lin 7. Three sets of levels are being
driven into the seam. The coal at this point is but about
70 feet directly under the surface. The drive at the
present opens into three levels, the lowest of which is
about 75 feet from the surface. At this level a mag-
nificent seam of coal, 5 feet thick on the clear, is met
with, and is intersected with a layer of fire-clay of about
3 inches in thickness.
The difference of the character of this coal from any
other led me to suspect that there might be a difference
in age from that of the Ipswich seams. But the fossils
are the same?namely, Thinnfeldia odontop ter aides
(Morris). I found here also a great abundance of a
fossil JEquisf'tum ( E. rotiferum , nobis ) which I have not
observed elsewhere. The species appears to be new,
but closely allied to one found in the Bajmahal coal-
beds of India, and in the oolitic coal of Scarborough
in Yorkshire.
Hose wood. ?Tour miles further west coal has been
found near the Bosewood Station. The seam is of
excellent quality but only 1-| feet thick.
Gatton. ?Ten miles south of Gatton, which is sixty
miles by rail from Brisbane, a fine seam of coal crops
out on Blackfellow?s Creek. This, according to Mr.


Gregory, contains about 9 feet of workable coal,
which is horizontal and offers great facilities for work-
ing. The coal is a hard cannel coal of a specific gravity
of 1*29. Its analysis showed fixed carbon 36, volatile
hydrocarbons 47, ash 17 per cent. At Flagstone Creek,
at the foot of the Main Range and six miles from
Toowoomba, a seam of a similar character, but smaller,
is found.
COAL ON THE PLATEAU.
The Main Range is, generally speaking, a volcanic
plateau lying on the coal measures, with eolian sand-
stones often intercalated between. Wherever the vol-
canic rock is interrupted, the coal formation crops out
over many hundreds of square miles. In sinking wells,
when the upper stratum of basalt is pierced, seams of
coal of varying thickness and quality have been cut.
The list of such localities would be too lengthy, but I
extract from Mr. Gregory?s report those portions
describing richer deposits on the Darling Downs :
? Six miles W.S.W. from Cambooya Railway Station, in the bed of
Hodgson?s Creek, large blocks of coal, some exceeding 1 cwt., have
been drifted out of the waterholes ; and the carboniferous shales and
soft sandstones are largely exposed on the west side of the creek,
extending nearly ten miles to the south-west.
? The coal is found along the channel of the creek for a distance
of two miles, in a condition which indicates that it has only been
moved a few yards from the original seam, so that there is little doubt
of the existence of a good seam, workable at a small depth on the
bank of the creek.
?This coal is of excellent quality, being hard, and capable of
standing carriage and exposure to wet without injury. It does not
make good coke. Specific gravity, T33 ; volatile in coking, 45 ; fixed
carbon, 42; ash, 13 per cent. ,
? Clifton. ?The Clifton Coal Mine is situate two miles beyond the
Clifton Railway Station, close to the east side of the line. Two shafts


have been sunk, and a bed of coal 4 to 5 feet thick is worked at a
depth of 60 feet; a second seam of 2 feet at 80 feet, and a third of 1\
feet at 100 feet, have been cut in the principal shaft.
? The upper seam, which is the one worked, produces good coal,
varying from bright bituminous to dead black oil coal, all being very
hard and tough, so that it bears carriage without breaking. It
produces a high percentage of gas or oil, according to the mode of
treatment.
? Specific gravity, T26 to T35; volatile in coking, 48; fixed
carbon, 42 ; ash, 10 per cent.
? The second seam is better suited for coke, as it cokes in heating.
?The lower seam is very hard oil coal. Specific gravity, T32 ;
volatile in coking, 47; fixed carbon, 37; ash, 16 per cent.
? Situate in an extensive tract of open, nearly level country, the
strata seem to have but little inclination, but the general dip seems to
be a little to the west. To the eastward the coal rocks are covered by
basalt, the edge of which is between the two shafts of the mine, the
eastern one being sunk through a considerable thickness of hard blue
metal; and at the junction of the igneous and coal rocks a bed of
earth was found containing fragments of fossil wood, with the leaves
and seed-vessels of plants, belonging to a period much more recent
than the coal strata.
? Owing to the porous character of the basalt, the mine is much
troubled with water, and the roof being of soft shale, much timber is
required to secure the workings ; but these difficulties will probably
decrease as the workings progress on the rise of the seam, the present
workings being nearly in the lowest part of the plain.
? Coal has been found in Clifton Creek, to the north-west of the
Clifton Mine ; also in a well sunk through basalt at the head station,
while the carboniferous sandstones and shales are largely developed to
the south-west.
? Allora. ?Coal was worked near Allora, about two miles east
from the Hendon Railway Station, and the coal supplied for use in
the locomotives on the Warwick Railway. The seam was not more
than 2 feet thick, and has been abandoned.
? The town of Warwick is situated on an outcrop of the carboni-
ferous sandstone, containing great quantities of fossil wood, changed
mostly to iron ore; and to the east and north of the town the soft
shales indicate the probability of coal existing at a small depth, small
fragments of it being found five miles to the south-east of the town,
also in a well on the Agricultural Reserve.?


It should he mentioned that the Clifton Mine is
not now worked, owing to the difficulties and expense of
transit, hut when a market is opened up from the
present railway to deep water on the south side of
Brisbane, to which reference will be made presently, all
these difficulties will be overcome. I may further add,
that as far as I can gather, the basins on the plateau arc
geologically older than those of Ipswich. Those fossils
I have identified are of Lias age ?notably, the well-
known Otozamites mcmdeslohi. This is found very
widely distributed in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and
always in Liassic deposits.
Mr. Gregory adds :
? And on Farm Creek, fourteen miles east from "Warwick, the
outcrop of a large scam has been worked for the supply of the steam
mills.
? The general character of the coals found between Walloon and
Warwick is that of cannel coal; it does not cake in coking, gives a
large percentage of gas,'or oil and paraffin, according to its treatment
at a high or low temperature. Its hardness renders it very suitable
for export. It burns very freely, and leaves a soft white ash. From
the small proportion of fixed carbon, and its not caking, it does not
produce good coke, but a charred coal, which, however, burns well;
consequently it is not well adapted for blast furnaces, though well
suited for reverberatory furnaces. As a steam coal, it is best suited
for stationary or marine engines, the strong steam blast of locomo-
tives being apt to blow it through the tubes. It is a very high class
household coal.
? In the Ipswich division the coals are bituminous, coking well;
the proportion of gas being small and the fixed carbon large, they are
suited for forges and blast furnaces, and are good steam coal when not
broken too small.?
Statistics. ?Before leaving the subject of the coal
formations connected with the port of Brisbane, a few
statistics will be useful to show the present state of the
coal trade :

Quantity of Coal raised in the West Moreton District during

Year 1880 - - 56,552 tons.

This output is, of course, quite inadequate to the
quantity which is in demand, as the following return
will show ;

Ports of Queensland during year ended 30th September, 1882.
Besides this, in 1882 fifty-six vessels, representing
a tonnage of 27,994 tons, left the port of Brisbane to load
coals at Newcastle, in New South Wales. This they

would not do if there had been any convenience for
loading with coal at Brisbane, a defect which will be
remedied in a few months. The Government have
nearly finished the construction of a railway which
branches from the Ipswich line to the south side of the
river Brisbane. By this means the trucks can be brought
to deep water, where vessels of the heaviest tonnage can
load by shoots from the wharf. Private enterprise must
of course �;ive effect to this work ; and there can be no
doubt that as soon as some of the projected coal com-
panies are floated very few vessels will leave the port of
Brisbane without coaling, and the supply will easily
equal the demand.
NORTHERN COAL-FIELDS.
Burrum Uiver. ?Between the Mary River and the
Purnett the coal formation reappears, and several most
valuable seams of coal crop out on the Burrum River,
about eighteen ? miles a little west of north from Mary-
borough. This is a basin which undoubtedly will prove
as valuable to the colony as that on the Bremer. The
Government have constructed a railway from Mary-
borough to Howard, the central township on the Burrum
River. In the course of time it may be expected that
this coal will command a large share of the Pacific
trade.
The principal colliery is that of the Queensland
Land and Coal Company, an English association, the
managing director of which is Mr. J. Hurley. This
colliery has one shaft 10 feet square, which cuts what is
called the Beaufort seam. This shows 3 feet 8 inches


of good hard coal, excellent for fuel, steam, and other
purposes. The mine was worked by a drive on the
outcrop previous to the formation of the company, hut
this is not now used. An expenditure of �17,000 has
already been made in developing the property; besides
this, a complete rolling-stock, steam saw-mill, brick-
making machine, have been put on the ground, ren-
dering the mine equal to an output of 500 tons a day.
The works are the largest in the colony, and the com-
pany has orders at present to the extent of 3,000 tons
per month.
In this colliery there are three seams. The first
1 foot 18 inches of good clear coal, with other smaller
hands. Then there is 70 feet of shale with fossil plants,
shells, and fish in abundance, which are at present under
examination to determine their age. Then comes the
Beaufort seam. Sixty feet below this is what is called
the Hartley seam, which is supposed to be the best, but
is not now worked, as the Beaufort, at a higher level,
is more than sufficient for present requirements. The
dip of all the seams is north, and the angle between 11
and 12 degrees. On the area of land belonging to the
company there is calculated to he about four to five
million tons of the Beaufort seam available.
There are two coal mines on the south side of the
Burrum River?Walsh?s, with two good seams, and
Torban Lea, with one seam of very good coal producing
about 500 or 600 tons a week.
Burnett River. ?Sixty miles north of the Mary is
the Burnett Hiver. Hie town of Bundaberg is situated
on this river. At about eighteen miles from the mouth,


close beside the railway, there are five or six seams of
coal cropping out. The coal is of that compact character
which has been described as peculiar to the seams at
Walloon. It is very valuable, but as yet none of the
coal is worked. The railway consumption is so small,
and there is no other market available; but no doubt
such a valuable deposit must soon come into use. The
road from the coast to the coal seams is perfectly
level, and fifteen miles of it is already accomplished by
railway.
Lawson and Mackenzie Rivers. ?Two of the prin-
cipal tributaries of the Titzroy River (on. which Rock-
hampton is built) flow through a coal basin of the same
age as the rich Newcastle seams of New South Wales.
This is the basin of the Mackenzie and Dawson Rivers,
forming an immense area of many thousand square
miles. In many places beds of carbonaceous sandstone
crop out, full of the common coal fossils of Newcastle,
New South Wales, such as Glossopteris browniana,
Sphenopteris plumosa , &c. These are never mingled
with any characteristic fossils of the Ipswich coal basin,
such as TJiinnfeldia odontopteroides, Alethopteris aus-
tralis, Podozamites distans, &c. No boring has yet
been attempted, but I have no doubt that seams of
very valuable coal may be expected where the fossils
occur. Cracow Creek, on the Dawson, and Weelwon-
dongera Creek, on the Nogoa, are both places which
might be advantageously tested.
Rlackwater. ?At a short distance beyond Black-
water, on the Central Railway, 120 miles west of Rock-
hampton, a seam of coal was found in cutting through


an embankment. It was a very sulphurous coal, but
if boring were persevered in other seams of good coal
would surely be found. The requirements of the Central
Railway must soon solve this problem.
Drummond Range. ?At the Drummond Range,
between Withersfield and Bogantungan, an anticlinal
axis of a formation is crossed which, by its fossil plants
( Lepidodendron, Calamities), &c., most certainly belongs
to the lower carboniferous of Europe. In New South
Wales coal has not been found in connection with this
formation, but it should be tested in this colony, for it
may prove to be the most valuable of all our coal
deposits. The locality is about 216 miles west of Rock-
hampton.
Bowen River. ?Many large seams of coal of paleo-
zoic age have been found on the Bowen River, but none
of them have been found available, owing to the curious
fact that repeated intercalations of volcanic matter has
destroyed the seams; others, however, may yet be found
out of reach of the volcanic influences.
Townsville . ?On the railway line, between Towns-
ville and Charters Towers, indications of coal have been
met with. The existence of seams, their extent and
value, is still a matter of investigation.
Baimer River . ?Coal has been known in the neigh-
bourhood of the Palmer River since 1872. The seams
are small but of excellent quality, and, according to
Mr. Jack, between the ages of Carboniferous and
Permian.
Endeavour River. ?An impure coal has been found
on some of the tributaries of the Endeavour River,


about thirty miles from Cooktown. There is a large
development of the carboniferous rocks in this locality,
and many impure coal seams. As the country becomes
better explored, better seams may be expected. A good
coal-field in this locality would have the most important
influence on the India and China trade.
In conclusion, it may be said that as Queensland is
only partially explored?and, geologically, scarcely ex-
plored beneath surface except on the gold and tin mines
?its mineral riches are yet but little known. Notwith-
standing this the fact that the coal formations cover so
vast an extent of the territory, and so many valuable
coal-fields having been discovered, makes me confident
in predicting that its resources in coal are enormous?
are equal, if not superior, to any other colony, and will
raise her shores to be in the end the grand coal em-
porium of the Southern Hemisphere.
