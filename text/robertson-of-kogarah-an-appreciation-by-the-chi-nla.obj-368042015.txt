“ROBERTSON OF KOGARAH”
An Appreciation
(By “The Chiel”)
In the days of my mental and spiri-
tual adolescence the man who made
the strongest appeal to my awakening
imagination was “Robertson of Brigh-
ton,” the greatest preacher in the es-
timation of competent judges, the
Anglican Church has ever produced.
Some years before the time of which
I am thinking Robertson with all the
marks and scars of his conflict on him
had passed into the presence of the
King, but the white track behind the
vessel was still upon the waters.
The interest in his complex persona-
lity had been stimulated and enlarg-
ed by the appearance of Stopford
Brook’s illuminating “Life and Let-
ters,” and the publication of volume
after volume of his unique sermons
and lectures. Much water has pass-
ed under the bridge since then and
now/ at the beginning of a blithe
old age, I find myself, by the good
providence of God, after an adventu-
rous life of many and diverse activi-
ties, in this and other lands, in regu-
lar and thankful attendance upon the
stimulating, and in every way help-
ful ministry of Robertson, of Koga-
rah.
Confessedly it is a long call, chro-
nologically and geographically, from
Robertson of Brighton to Robertson
of Kogarah. And yet separated by
the widest differences of time, train-
ing, temperament and location the
two men, the one an Episcopalian by
inheritance and conviction, the other
in his prepossessions and sympathies
a widely cultured Presbyterian of the
modern type., from the standpoint of
their preaching quality, have many
thing in common. The motive and
regulative impulses which colored and
Moulded the life and ministry of Ro-
bertson of Brighton are equally il-
lustrative of the life and ministry of
Robertson of Kogarah. There is the
same keen and penetrating insight,
the same clarity and felicity of ex-
pression, the same unfaltering insis-


tence upon the imperative of duty, nestly progressive spirits in common
the same implicit belief in the soul with the wearied of heart, the unsatis-
bf good in things evil, the same im-
patience with hollowness and insin-
cerity, the same lofty disregard of
merely carping criticism, the same
patient endurance of physical infir-
mity, the same heroic acceptance of
the divine purpose and, the same holy
loving, and reverent fear of God.
11.
There the resemblance ceases for
in almost every other respect the two
men are the direct antithesis of each
other. ,
Robertson of Brighton was not a
preacher by choice,' but by compul-
sion of circumstance, and there were
times when his contempt of the pro-
phetic office became almost an obses-
sion, Herein lies the tragedy of his
life;—
Not so with Robertson of Kogarah.
He is preacher born and made, part-
ly due to inherited tendencies, partly
to the sleepless and persistent culti-
vation of the germs implanted in him.
I can never imagine him writing as
Robertson of Brighton once said:—
“I wish I did not hate preaching
so much; but the degradation of be-
ing a Brighton preacher is almost in-
tolerable. I cannot dig; to beg I am
ashamed; but I think there is not a
hardworking artisan whose work does
not seem to me that of a worthier
and higher being than myself. I do
not depreciate spiritual work, —I
hold it higher than secular—all I
say and feel is, that by change of
times the pulpit has lost its place.”
Robertson of Kogarah, I repeat,
could never have written that. He
is a preacher by deliberate choice. He
loves preaching—the pulpit is to him
a throne. As a regular and increa-
singly eager attendant upon his mi-
nistry I wish to bear thankful testi-
mony in every degree of emphasis,
to the fact not “that by the change
of times the pulpit has lost its place,”
but to the fact that even in the un-
settled conditions of our time the
Christian pulpit has still its place and
function. The prophet, “the seer
whose vision penetrates far into the
uriapparent,” whose supreme office
it is to reveal and interpret the en-
during tenderness of God to man,
can still move and touch human
hearts and lives to divinest issues.
Here we find the explanation of the
ever growing company of the ear-
fled of soul who turn to him from
week to week for the revealing word,
the healing touch, the forgiving whis-
per, the message of comfort and
sympathy—and never in vain. His
delivery is singularly free from affec-
tation and is marked by deep and
thrilling earnestness. The rich vi-
brant voice, with its subtle tones and
inflections, is not the least of his
endowments. Every address is in-
stinct with life, and palpitating with
spiritual energy.
In his ordinary ministry he con-
vincingly illustrates the truth of Dr.
Parker’s great affirmation—“he prea-
ches to all time who preaches to bro-
ken hearts.” The love of preaching”
said one who knew as few men know
the reality of which he spoke, is to
a minister what genius is to a poet.
The poet sings for the same reason
as the birds of the forest sing: the
genius of song is in his nature —ne-
cessity is laid upon his spirit. Place
him alone upon a solitary island,
amid the wild waves of the stormy
ocean, and he will speak in numbers
there, where no human ear can hear:
his voice shall mingle and harmonise
with the sounds of nature, and angels
passing that way shall know that a
banished poet dwells there. So here
the true preacher preaches not for
gain, not for fame, and not merely to
glorify Christ and to save men from
sin; but also for his intense love of
the work!” And Robertson of Koga-
rah like all “The great and real prea-
chers of the past is impelled, con-
strained, and pressed forward in his
noble career by the power of this
love.”
Ecclesiastically Mr. Robertson is a
Presbyterian (with all the implica-
tions) though I once heard him con-
fess; “if I were not a Presbyterian I
would be an Anglican. I love the
grand old Church of England with its
splendid symbolic teaching, the very
atmosphere of its buildings, its ma-
jectic, ordered and reverent wor-
ship.”
Within the limits of the Presby-
terian Order his esthetic tendencies
find legitimate expression. Hence
the versatility and freshness, the
beauty and tenderness of his prayers;
indeed of every impressive devotional
exercise by which he leads his people


into the throne room of the Al- voice, its best interpreter, is one of
mighty. When Dr. Monro Gibson at the greatest gifts of God. When
a great public meeting in London
some years ago, with simulated mo-
desty,- described himself as a “humble
Presbyterian Minister.” Dr. Parker,
who was the next speaker, with his
almost ebullient humour, could not
resist the temptation to say in his in-
imitable way,” when my friend, Dr.
Monro Gibson, described himself as a
humble Presbyterian Minister I said
to my soul, said I, “Turn aside and
see this great sight, a humble Presby-
terian Minister.” My friend, the
subject of this sketch, is much too
honest to expose himself to that gen-
ial rebuke. To occupy an assured
position in the hierarchy of the
Church of his birth and choice is, in
his reasoned judgment, the highest
ecclesiastical distinction to which a
mortal may aspire—the apotheosis of
all human achievement.
Mr. Robertson’s genius as an or-
ganiser finds its evidence in the be-
wildering number and variety of the
activities under his inspiration and
control. The intimations are conclu-
sive proof that both minister and
people are fully awake to the claims
and urgencies of the young church of
adolescence. Apart from the Sun-
day School, with its efficient staff and
modern equipment, there are several
societies devoted apparently to the
liberation and development of per-
sonality. We older people do not in-
terfere with the management of these
movements, but heartily wish them
Godspeed.
The writer craves the privilege at
this point to express his personal in-
debtedness —and incidentally the ap-
preciation of the inarticulate portion
of the congregation—to the well ba--
lanced choir which, under the skil-
ful and magnetic direction of -Mr.
Gore, leads us so effectively in the
Service, of Song. Its independent
and exquisitely rendered morning
and evening messages (as the Mini-
ster aptly calls them) have an im-
mediate spiritual impact, and create
an atmosphere for the reception of
the spoken word. Be it understood
that my use of the word “Choir” is
inclusive of the Organist, the sustain-
ed quality of whose work is deserving
of special mention.
The greatest mystery of all art,
perhaps, is music, and the singing
used in the service of the Sanctuary,
whose walls are truth and whose al-
tar is sacrifice, or for definite‘spiri-
tual ends : ,‘it becomes a great re'ligidus
ministry, qualifying all who- engage in
it for membership in “the Choir- invi-
sible of those immortal souls who live
again “in lives made better by their
presence.” n.revv)
An appreciation of Mr. Robert-
son’s ministry would be manifestly
incomplete without a reference, how-
ever brief, to its aggressive spirit as
represented by the many and busy ac-
tivities associated with his branch
Church at Langlea. Here, as in the
parent church, are many educative
and recreative organisations, splen-
didly officered, which in their totality
are making a worthy contribution to
the cause and Kingdom of Christ.
That a body of workers so badly do-
miciled—so “cribbed, cabined and
confined”—should have made so deep
and wide an impression uopn the life
of the district awakens an emotion
compounded of thankfulness and sur-
prise. And still the door of oppor-
tunity stands open an insistent chal-
lenge to the self-denying consecrated
spirit of the workers; and some of
us are looking to the immediate fu-
ture for larger and better things.
Of Mr. Robertson’s work as pastor,
the range and quality of his methods,
I am not competent to speak. Into
that sacred domain no stranger may
penetrate. Much may be inferred
from the active love and sympathy
which unites minister and people.
And I should not be greatly surpris-
ed to learn that his domiciliary mini-
strations are as fervently appreciat-
ed as his public utterances.
J* VL
Theolically an evangelical of the
evangelicals, the redeeming activity
of ? God in Christ is central to all his
thought and teaching. This is the
master light of his seeing. “I have
only one theme” he can cay with
Phillips Brooks, “the Divine love of
the human Saviour.” The mysteries
of pyschology and the subtitles of the
mentaTlife have little or no place in
his scheme of teaching. The empha-
sis is always upon the tragic fact of
sin in the foreground of every human
life, and the infinite sufficiency, for


retrieval and renewal, of the soli- touches life at every point and ans-
tary salvation by Jesus Christ.
“CHRIST DIED FOR OUR SINS
ACCORDING TO THE SCRIP-
TURES.” To the interpretative ex-
position of this theme, — in all its
lights, shades angles—he brings
a richly stored mind, the breadth of a
philosopher and the fervour of an
Evangelist. The mystery of
suffering may give him oc-
casional pause, but he falls
back triumphantly upon Browning’s
great conviction that the acknow-
ledgement of God in Christ answers
all questions whether in the world or
out of it. It may be the divine
wounds are needful to our health.
“God spreads His darkness over us
He may show us His wealth of stars.”
The disciplinary processes of life are
working towards wise and beneficient
ends. Suffering is a sharp instru-
ment the great master sculptor uses
for the shaping of life and bringing
it into conformity with Himself. It
is well not to despise the chastening
of the Almighty. “My son faint
not when thou are rebuked of Him.”
Even Christ the Captain of our Sal-
vation was made perfect through
suffering. There is no mistaking the
sincerity, the intensity of Mr. Ro-
bertson’s concern for all to whom has
been entrusted the Ministry of suf-
fering. When he quotes, as he some-
times does, with appropriate fervour,
Wordsworth’s haunting line” the still,
sad music of humanity,” one feels
instinctively that his skill in the in-
terpretation of life’s undertones is
the fruit of long and familiar inter-
course with the Angel whose name is
Pain.
His Genius for sympathy may be
part of his original equipment, but
it has certainly been intesively train-
ed, perfected in the hard school of
experience.
His attitude to the Bible does not
excite speculation. I have found it
difficult to detect from his teaching
that by inclination he learns
to any hard or fixed theory
of inspiration—verbal, plenary,
partial; but his attitude to
the Book itself is not open to
mistake. He finds in it the record
of a progressive revelation culmina-
ting in Christ. It speaks with a liv-
ing voice to our deepest needs. It
wers it with infinite meanings. To
him, as to Van Dyke and all men of
his temper and school, it is the living
word of the living God, spoken eter-
nally to the living soul. It is the
Father’s message to His children
through all time and everywhere.
Quite recently he made a declaration
to the effect (I cannot reproduce his
exact words) that as an honest man
he must have some regard to the light
of these last days, but there is no
need for panic or alarm. “It will
all come right again if we are faith-
ful.”
I am glad to hear that on the ter-
mination of his fifth year of service
amongst them his people loaded him
with many substantial tokens of their
unabated confidence and esteem. Nor
did they forget the energetic and de-
voted partner of his life, who by
dividing his burdens, doubles his use-
fulness. “I don’t know,” I remem-
ber my favourite minister in the old
land saying, “what we ministers would
do without our wives. I don’t know
what I should do without my wife,
but I never tell her so because disci-
pline must be earnestly
pray that the sixth year of his mini-
stry may be one consolidation
and enlargement in every sphere.
“God blesses still the generous
thought,
And still the fitting word He speeds.
And truth at His requiring taught
He quickens into deeds.”
Thomas Jones, the celebrated poet
preacher, in his address on the “Im-
portance of Preaching” to the Vic-
torian Congregational Union, con-
cludes an arresting discussion of the
vital and everlasting difference be-
tween priest and prophet with an
affirmation and an exhortation which
I pass on to the many Presbyterians
throughout the far flung parish of
Kogarah:—
“The less the world has to do with
priests as such, the better it will be
for the world, but if you can find
a prophet sent from God, a real spiri-
tual “Seer,” the best thing you can
do is to attend to his preaching and
obey his word.” The prophet is not
far to seek.

THREE DOORS
Three doors there are in the temple
Where men go up to pray,
And they that wait at the outer gate
May enter by either way.
There are some that pray by asking;
They lie on the Master's breast,
And, shunning the strife of the lower
life,
They utter their cry of rest.
There are some that pray by seeking;
They doubt where their reason
fails;
But their mind’s despair is the ancient
prayer
To touch the print of the nails.
There are some that pray by knock-
ing;
They put their strength to the
wheel,
For they have not time for thoughts
sublime
They can only act what they feel.
Father, give each his answer—
Each in his kindred way;
Adapt Thy light to his form of night
And grant him his needed day.
Give to the yearning spirits,
That only Thy rest desire,
The power to bask in the peace they
ask,
And feel the warmth of Thy fire.
Give to the soul that seeketh,
’Mid cloud and doubt and storm.
The glad surprise of the straining
eyes
To see on the waves Thy form.
Give to the heart that knocketh
At the doors of earthly care
The strength to tread in the pathway
spread
By the flowers Thou hast planted
there.
Then, in the common temple,
There shall worship, hand in hand,
The lives that man’s heart would
hold apart \.
As unfit to dwell in one land.
For the middle wall shall be broken
And the light expand its ray,
When the burdened of brain and
the soother of pain
Shall be ranked with the men that
pray.
—Dr. George Matheion.
