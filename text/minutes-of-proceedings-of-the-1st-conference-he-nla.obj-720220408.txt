R. L. J. Ellery, Esq., was called to the Chair.
The Conference commenced at 2.30 p.m.
1. The Chairman stated that in accordance with the understanding between the members
at the close of the Conference held at Sydney in November 1879, that it was desirable to hold
a second Conference in Melbourne early in 1881, he had addressed the following letter to the
Hon. the Chief Secretary of Victoria :

g l u ) Observatory, Melbourne, March 17th, 1881.
In November 1879 the New South Wales Government invited the different colonial meteorologists to meet in
Sydney and hold a Conference with a view of bringing about a more satisfactory intercolonial weather telegram system,
and to decide upon the best means of improving our knowledge of Australian Meteorology generally. This Conference
was held, and among other matters it was decided if possible to hold a similar conference in Melbourne about twelve
months later for a similar purpose. I now find that the gentlemen representing this science in New Zealand, New South
Wales, and South Australia will be able to attend in Melbourne about the middle of April. I have now the honor therefore
to enquire if you approve of such a Conference being held here, and if so whether you will cause an invitation to be sent to
the Governments of New South Wales, South Australia, and New Zealand, asking that their respective astronomers or
chief meteorologists may be authorized to attend such a Conference about the second or third week in April. I would
also respectfully suggest that the Governments of Tasmania, Western Australia, and Queensland be invited to send
representatives.
I have the honor to be, Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
ROB. L. J. ELLERY,
The Honorable the Chief Secretary, Melbourne. Govt. Astronomer.
The Minister approved of the proposal to hold a Conference, and at once invited the various
colonies to send representatives. Replies from New South Wales, South Australia, and New
Zealand agreeing to do so were received. Telegrams were also received from Queensland and
Western Australia to the effect that those colonies were unable to send representatives. The
following message from the Government of Tasmania was also received :
“To Chief Secretary , Victoria.
“We have no such officer as the one mentioned in your telegram. This Government cannot send delegates to
proposed Conference, but concurs generally in objects sought to be obtained, and if Conference is held will communicate
their view's to the Chairman by letter or memorandum.
“2/4/81. WM. MOORE.”
The only colonies, therefore, represented at this Conference are New South Wales, South
Australia, New Zealand, and Victoria. The Chairman also stated that the Government had
placed the services of a shorthand writer at the disposal of the Conference.
It was then resolved that the Government be thanked for their consent to grant
services of a shorthand writer.
2. The Chairman reported that the following resolutions were adopted by the Conference
held at Sydney in November 1879 :
I. That, in view of the great importance which a better knowledge of the movement and
origin of strong gales and storms on our coast lines and neighboring seas is to the
shipping and commercial interest generally, it is desirable to secure, as far as possible,
co-operation in all the Australasian colonies for the investigation of storms, as well as
for agricultural and general climatological purposes.
A 2


11. That, with the view of giving effect to the foregoing resolution, similar observations and
the same form of publication should, as far as possible, be adopted throughout the
colonies.
111. That, in order effectively to carry out the objects of the Conference, as affirmed in the
foregoing resolutions, it is desirable to establish first-class meteorological stations
in certain well-selected positions in the several Australasian colonies, including New
Zealand, in addition to those existing.
7 o
IV. That the definition of the work of a first-class station, given in the preface to the New
Zealand Meteorological Report for 1873, be adopted, viz. :
“ The observations taken are limited to those for determining atmospheric pressure,
maximum and minimum daily temperature of atmosphere, and of insolation and
radiation, the average daily amount of moisture, the rainfall and number of rainy
days, the force and direction of wind, and amount and character of cloud.”
V. That the instruments at each first-class station consist of a mercurial barometer, of
either the standard or Board of Trade form ; thermometers of new or approved
patterns compared with standards as frequently as possible ; rain-gauges of eight
inches collecting diameter ; and wind-gauges of any approved form. The local hours
of observation to be 9 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m. Beaufort’s scale of wind to be adopted.
The observations to be recorded in equivalents and pressure.
VI. That it is very desirable to obtain the co-operation of the Government of Tasmania,
and to persuade them to establish a station at the public expense at Hobart Town.
VII. That it is desirable to secure the co-operation of the Governments of Western
Australia, New Zealand, and Tasmania in the system of weather telegrams, which
now embraces the colonies of South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, and
Queensland.
VIII. That, in the opinion of this Conference, it is desirable that weather telegrams and
forecasts shall, in all cases, depend upon the observations used for general meteoro-
logical and climatological statistics, and be under the direction of the head of the
meteorological department in each colony.
IX. That this Conference, having been informed that the Eastern Extension Telegraph
Company will charge half rates for the transmission of weather reports through the
cable connecting Australia and Tasmania, and probably also the cable to New Zealand,
recommend that the cost of such reports be defrayed by the participating colonies in
equal proportions ; and that, in the opinion of this Conference, such cost need not
exceed in the aggregate £350 per annum.
X. That, in the opinion of the Conference, this expenditure is justified by the extreme
importance to the shipping interest of early information of the approach of dangerous
easterly and westerly gales.
XI. That the several Governments be requested to cause precedence to be given to the
regular weather telegrams and special storm reports.
XII. That, in the opinion of this Conference, there should be established in each of the
colonies, upon a high mountain peak, a meteorological observatory for the special
study of winds and other meteorological phenomena ; and that the most desirable
positions for them would be the following:—
South Australia ... Mount Lofty About 2,500 feet above sea-level.
New South Wales ... Kiandra „ 4,600 „ „
New Zealand Tauhara Taupo ... „ 4,600 „ „
Ditto Mount Herbert ... „ 4,000 „ „
Tasmania Mount Wellington ... „ 4,000 „ „
Victoria... ... ... Mount Macedon ... „ 3,500 „ „
XIII. That the revision of the present telegraph weather code be referred to Messrs. Russell
and Ellery, with a view to its simplification and extension.
XIV. That the interchange of weather statistics, in carrying out the suggestions of this
Conference, between the different Australasian stations should be in the form of a
diagram ; and that this should not interfere with the printing ot statistics by the
different colonies in any way they like.
XV. (1.) That the monthly graphic records for interchange consist of curves, showing
barometer, velocity and direction of wind, temperature, humidity, rainfall, with
remarks upon weather, especially with reference to storms and atmospheric disturb-
ances, and that specific forms be prepared and distributed to the co-operating colonies.
(2.) That the mean humidity curve be derived from the means of maximum and
minimum of wet and dry bulb thermometers.
(3.) The barometer curve to be constructed from barographic records, so as to depict
the turning points. . .
(4.) The temperature curve to represent maximum and minimum and mean lor each
day.
(5.) The velocity and direction of the wind to be deduced from the anemometer.


XVI. That in the transmission of telegrams the reports be generalized from the local
weather reports.
For New Zealand the following subdivision into districts is recommended for
convenience of reporting :
A ... N.E. aspect ... North Cape to East Cape.
B ... N.W. aspect ... Cape Maria to West Cape (exclusive of Cook Straits).
C ... S. aspect ... West Cape to Moeraki.
D ... S.E. aspect ... Moeraki to East Cape (exclusive of Cook Straits).
E ... Cook Straits ... Comprising Wanganui, Wellington, Cape Campbell,
and Cape Farewell, Nelson.
A code to be framed to express the weather in each of the above aspects in general
terms, according to the judgment of the reporter, thus :
Aspect. Wind and Weather. Rain. Sea.
No remark, to indicate absence of phenomena.
XVII. That the telegrams furnished to Melbourne by Tasmania should conform with
those between the Australian colonies.
(1). That weather telegrams from the Australian colonies shall comprise
1. Barometer reduced to 32° and sea-level.
2. Dry bulb,
3. Humidity,
4. Maximum and minimum,
5. Direction and velocity of wind,
6. State of weather,
7. Rainfall,
8. Sea disturbances,
with a synoptical report of the weather generally.
(2.) And that within New Zealand the same system should be adopted.
XIX. That the extreme importance of the weather system proposed be strongly urged upon
e Queensland Covernment, with a view to obtain their more active co-operation.
XX. That Australia be divided into six meteorological areas for transmission of reports to
New Zealand, viz. Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales,

5. Under Resolution 111. : Changes in the department have led to a reduction of the first-
class stations from eighteen to three, which he thought to be quite a sufficient number to afford
all the data required for complete meteorological statistics, especially as it is contemplated to
furnish these stations with complete sets of continuous self-recording apparatus. The number of
second-class stations has, however, been largely increased, and their equipment very much improved.
6. Under Resolution VII. : The New Zealand Government are favorably disposed m
regard to the co-operation requested, and to provide the means suggested by the Conference, but
the matter has not yet been brought before Parliament, the proposition being considered somewhat
indefinite. _ . . , ,
7. Under Resolution VIII. : Correspondence was read and handed m relative to the
changes that had been made in the relations of the Meteorological and Weather Departments of
New Zealand, partly in accordance with the recommendation of the Conference, and partly on
account of certain changes in the direction of retrenchment. Since 1874 there has been a Weather
Signal Department under the charge of Captain Edwin, quite distinct from the Meteorological
Department, which furnished the statistics. The papers handed in by Dr. Hector, and marked A,
showed that he had recommended the reference to Captain Edwin of the Report mafie by the
Sydney Conference, for report—(l.) As to how far the suggestions could be given effect to by
his department. (2.) As to preventing duplication of observations by combining the work ot the
two departments. And (3.) As to preserving the reports on which the weather signals are founded}
in order that the conclusions may be reviewed in the future. In Captain Edwin’s reply, he drew
attention to the expense involved in sending the daily synoptical report; to certain phenomena,
indicating that, in his opinion, the meteorological connection between Australia and New Zealand
is not so close as might be reasonably supposed ; to the probability that information trom
Queensland would be more useful to New Zealand than that from other colonies ; to Mount reel
as a site for a mountain station, and to the doubt whether the results from only one such station
would be worth the expense ; and to the desirableness of assimilating the system of registration
to that used in the United Kingdom ; he stated his preference for a direct statement (in weather
warnings sent to New Zealand) of the position and route of any storm centre affecting that
with an example; lie considered that certain suggestions in regiffa to telegrapllnc
messages were not necessary ; that, while high tides are now predicted m New Zealand, additional
information would improve these warnings, and that tide-gauges would collect valuable data
Attached to this paper were notes thereon by Mr. Ellery and Mr. Kussell. Mr. E'ep'remaike
that the cost of telegrams would be hut a trivial sum to each colony, say £9O or £lOO, and would
be reduced by the joining of other colonies ; that the weather telegrams should not be complicated
by any deductions regarding a single locality, though early intimation of any greatdisturmnco,
if added to the ordinary telegram from the colony where it originated, would he very valuable.
The suggestions as to telegraphic messages, considered by Captain Edwin unnecessary, wou
secure promptitude in telegraph offices. The tide-gauges were not for prediction but to
furnish knowledge concerning abnormal tides, or disturbances of normal ones. Mr. Kussell
expressed in his remarks the same view as Mr. Ellery did concerning the expense of telegrams
otoerved that the Conference, having unanimously resolved m favor of cablegrams between
Australia and New Zealand, it was very desirable to test the proposition ; remarked that it was
proposed to send information from Queensland; and pointed out that the messages' P r »P^

matter which might not be correct, though it might, if of great importance, as

8. Dr. Hector then handed in certain papers on the subject of amalgamating ana
reorganizing the Weather Forecast and Meteorological Departments of New Zealand The corre-
snondence showed that on the sth of April 1880 Dr. Hector addressed to the Honorable the
Colonial Secretary a letter pointing out that a saving might be effected, and drawing attention to
the fact that in 1867 and on several occasions since he had suggested a complete reorgam

reliable for those purposes even where (as in Great Britain) observations had been made careful }
for over fifty years ; while the latter, requiring no special training of observers, demanded of
forecasting officer skill and despatch, while it gave daily value for the daily expenditure.
a °Tn order to explain to the Conference the method on which Captain Edwin conducted the
Signal Department, Dr. Hector laid before the Conference a copy of Captain Edwin s papei
communicated to the New Zealand Institute on the Principles of Weather Forecast in New
Zealand, with a sheet showing the succession of weather as recorded m that colony,, plotted on is
principle for a period of six months from January to June 1880 He explained that Captain
Edwin’s method was in the main the same as that adopted by the Meteorological Council of Great
Britain, although it involved the acceptance of certain hypotheses which are not yet generally
received. Since the beginning of the year, the Weather Signal Department having been placed
under the charge of Dr. Hector as Meteorological Director, the method of observing, recording,
and reporting has been modified so as to agree with the wishes of the Conference.
10 Thirty-seven reporting- stations are now fitted with complete instruments, and supply
information at 9 a.m. of every day as to the wind, pressure, temperature, humidity, and
general weather. These telegrams are grouped according to the aspects decided on by the Con-
ference viz.: (A) north-east; (B) north-west; (C) southern; (D) south-eastern ; and (E) Cook s
Straits From the data thus obtained and from telegrams when found necessary, an isobaric map
is constructed each day, and a general report for each of the above aspects is prepared, below which
the forecast for each aspect is written in such a way as, if correct, would agree with the report lor
the following day, and warnings are issued when necessary to any part of the coast where danger-
ous winds are apprehended. The data thus obtained will be used as second-class station returns
for statistical purposes. , . . . i 1
11. Dr. Hector submitted these isobaric maps and the data upon which they were founded
for the months of February and March, during which the new system was in operation, and stated
as the result of his experience that it afforded the most satisfactory method of tracing and recording
the changes of weather, and distinguishing the characteristics of a season.
12. The correspondence had resulted in arrangements for the future, whereby one or all
of the three first-class stations should be gradually so improved as to approximate in their equip-
ment to that of the central or observatory stations in Australia, while, in addition to the thirty-seven
second-class stations, a large number of third-class or rainfall stations are being established.
These last will be kept by lighthouse-keepers (where not in telegraphic communication), by pilots,
by harbormasters, and by other Government officers, and by amateurs. At these stations
temperature, rain, wind, and weather observations are made.
13. Valuable meteorological observations are received from Fiji, and were published in
Dr. Hectors last report for the years 1877, 1878, and 1879. An additional first-class station has
been established at the Chatham Islands, and has been in operation since January 1879. The
results for that year having been published in the report just mentioned, a copy thereof was laid
upon the table, and attention was drawn to the fact that it contained daily readings for the
three stations at Auckland, Wellington, and Dunedin for pressure, wind, and rainfall for a period
of three years, accompanied by curves which showed a very remarkable agreement of the atmo-
spheric disturbances throughout that range of latitude, which is equal to a distance of 800 miles.
Dr. Hector also submitted the daily observations for 1880, made at the Wellington station, and
the monthly abstracts from all stations for the same year.
14. Under Resolution IX. : It was reported that the Government of New Zealand had
agreed to bear, for the present, the cost of any necessary cablegrams, but desired, before bringing
the matter before Parliament, that the Conference should express more clearly what they consider
to be the particular value of those cablegrams, and what their probable cost, and what arrange-
ments in regard to payment are suggested to give effect to the recommendation.
15. Under Resolution XI. : All weather warnings and the reports from stations are for-
warded with the greatest celerity, and no difficulty is experienced in New Zealand from delay
of weather telegrams, a result largely due to the interest which the Superintendent of Telegraphs,
Dr. Lemon, takes in the subject.
16. Under Resolution XII.: No steps have been taken to get a high-level station ; the
establishment is not at present able to cope with this work, and it is doubtful whether, for some
time to come, a vote can be got to make it so. Observations are, however, taken at Taupo, at an
altitude of 1,200 feet, in the centre of the North Island, and Bealey (2,140 feet), in the centre of
the South Island.
17. Under Resolution XIII. : The present agreement with Mr. Russell is, that cablegrams
shall be sent only for any remarkable phases of weather in New Zealand, and that they shall
indicate excessive pressure or abnormal differences in pressure within the New Zealand area.
18. Under Resolution XIV. : A form of diagram was submitted, in which the meteorological
statistics have for some years been displayed at the Wellington Station, and in which they are
to be communicated to Sydney, from the beginning of the present year, from Auckland, Wel-
lington, and Dunedin.
19. Under Resolution XVI. : The classification and grouping of the weather reports has
been strictly adapted to this recommendation, but, in practice, the arrangement is not found to
be the most convenient, so that the definition of the aspects may probably be revised with
advantage.
20. Under Resolution XVIII.: The requirements of this resolution have been met, with
respect to New Zealand, and a synoptical report of the weather generally for the colony is
published in the evening papers each day.


Re I solu , tion XXV - : Several tide-gauges have been procured, but at present they
are utilized for the local requirements of harbor boards, and are not yet available for general
investigations sncli as are contemplated by the Conference.
i\r n w ?f arraLl & that data should be obtained from Sydney, Adelaide, New Zealand, and
Melbourne, for the months of January, February, and March, with a view of testing the applica-
bility to Australia of the system of weather forecasts adopted in the northern hemisphere.
The Conference adjourned to to-morrow at Ten o'clock a.m.

Mr. Ellery, in the Chair ;
Dr. Hector, Mr. Todd.
Mr. Russell,
The Conference met at the Observatory at Ten o’clock a.m.
23. Resolved : —XXVIII. That the paragraphs of the Report shall be numbered with
consecutive Arabic numerals.
24. Resolved:—XXlX. That the resolutions and important points shall be numbered
consecutively with Roman numerals.
Report by Mr. Russell.
25. Mr. Russell reported, in accordance with Resolution XXVII., as follows : —Under
Resolution 11. : Had extended the range of the weather map by taking in new stations established
in agreement with report; had published daily a barometer curve including all the coast stations, as
this was a method which appeared to convey to the public better than could be done by figures the
passage of barometric depressions. He desired to call the attention of the members of the Con-
ference to the fact that this curve pointed to the insufficiency of the present telegrams because
they did not give turning points of the barometer ; hence some depressions appeared to pass from
Euda in two days, and others in one day. This, no doubt, was owing to the fact that the 9 a.m.
observations were taken to represent the turning points. He submitted copies of the weather map
printed daily at Sydney and distributed gratis.
26. Under Resolution 111. : Additional stations (first-class) have been established at
Kiaudra, Menindie, Hay, and Wollongong, making altogether twenty-nine in New South Wales,
see list in Appendix No. 1 ; besides these reports were received from 9 first class private stations,
from 72 thermometer and rain stations, and from 100 rain stations, making the total 210 stations.
27. Under Resolution VII. : Had been unable to secure active co-operation from the
Government of Queensland in the weather system.
28. Under Resolution VIII.: Had continued to make the same observations serve for
weather signal purposes and statistics.
29. Under Resolution IX.: Submitted a letter from the Superintendent of the New
Zealand Cable showing the liberal rates at which the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company
are prepared to transmit weather telegrams. He was authorized to say that the Government of
New South Wales would share the cost of the proposed weather cablegrams to the extent of
Seventy-five pounds per annum, which w T as probably more than would be required.
30. Under Resolution XII.: A mountain station has been established on Kiandra, 4,600 feet
above sea.
31. Under Resolution XVIII. : Had regularly sent, but had not received synoptical
reports.
32. Under Resolutions XXII. and XXIII.: These resolutions had been conformed to.
33. Mr. Ellery, referring to the letter read by Mr. Russell (cf. par. 29) remarked that in
1877 he received a letter from the Superintendent of the Tasmanian cable, stating that cable
messages from Tasmania would be transmitted at half the ordinary rate, inclusive of the address
and signature. In 1880 he had asked that this concession might be extended, and had received
a reply to the effect that if more than one message was required each way daily an endeavour
would be made to induce the directors to extend the concession to a second message.
Report by Mr. Todd.
34. Mr. Todd, in accordance with Resolution XXVII., reported as follows : —Under
Resolution I. : That he would hereafter lay before the Conference the form of weather bulletin
posted at the Adelaide Telegraph Office, at the Exchange, and at Port Adelaide.
35. Under Resolution 11. : That nothing had been done, since the Sydney Conference had
not arrived at any decision as to the form to be adopted, leaving it open to each director to
publish the results of his own observations for his own purposes in his own way. A copy of the
observations for January 1879 was put in, to show the form in which the observations for South






Australia had been published ; also a copy of the weather map taking in the whole of Australia
and New Zealand upon which it is proposed to lay down isobars.
36. Under Resolution 111. : That, as the outcome of the last Conference, a vote has been
obtained from Parliament for providing the Observatory at Adelaide with self-recording instru-
ments, namely—a barograph, thermograph, anemometer, and ombrograph. Had deferred ordering
the anemometer, knowing that Mr. Ellery was making one on an improved principle ; and it was
probable that a similar instrument would be adopted at the Adelaide Observatory.
37. Under Resolution IY. : That the following are the first-class stations (as defined at the
Sydney Conference) in South Australia Adelaide, Cape Northumberland, Cape Borda, Alice
Springs, Port Darwin, Eucla, Mount Gambier, Robe, Strathalbyn, and Kapunda. Barometer
stations have been established at Streaky Bay, Port Augusta, and Daly Waters. There are
thermometer stations at Goolwa, Mount Barker, and Clare. At Cape Northumberland, Cape
Borda, Alice Springs, and Port Darwin, observations are taken every three hours, day and night.
At the other stations observations are taken generally at 9 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m. ; but at some
of them at 9 a.m., 12, 3 p.m., 6 p.m., and 9 p.m. It is intended to establish additional barometrical
stations, and to make them first-class stations. The proposed first-class stations are Streaky Bay,
Port Augusta, Farina, and The Peak. In addition to the stations named, there are nearly 200
rainfall stations throughout South Australia.
38. Under Resolution Y. : That barometers of Fortin’s construction are used, not the
Board of Trade form.
39. Under Resolution VII. : That it had been left to him to secure the co-operation of
Western Australia, which he had accomplished by the kind courtesy of the Honorable Mr. Fraser,
Surveyor-General. That recently observations had been made at 7.30 a.m., in order that the
report might reach the eastern colonies early enough to be included in their daily reports.
40. Under Resolution IX. : That lie was able to say that the South Australian Govern-
ment would bear its share of the expense of the cable weather telegrams.
41. Under Resolution XI.: That in the South Australian Telegraph Department precedence
is given to all weather telegrams before everything else, but that the same rule did not appear
to apply to the other Australian colonies.
42. Under Resolution XII.: That no action had been taken, but desired to mention, en
passant , that Alice Springs station is at an elevation of 2,100 feet above sea-level.
43 ; Under Resolution XVIII. : That the daily weather telegrams are not precisely con-
sistent with the resolution, the Sydney Observatory, for instance, sending the humidity, whilst
from Melbourne were sent the readings of the wet and dry bulb thermometers. The synoptic
reports are not regularly received.
44. Under Resolution XX. : That South Australia has been divided into the tropical
and extra-tropical districts, the stations in the tropics being Port Darwin, Daly Waters, Powell’s
Creek, Tennent’s Creek, and Alice Springs.
45. Under Resolutions XXII. and XXIII. : That the resolutions are strictly carried out.
. Under Resolution XXI\ . : Ilmt experiments with swinging thermometers had been
carried out, the results of which would be presented to this Conference at a future meeting.
U. Under Resolution XXY. : That he had not yet succeeded in getting records of self-
registering tide-gauges.
48. That the meteorological statistics had always been in his hands.
Report by Mr. Ellery.
49. Mr. Ellery, in accordance with Resolution XXVII., reported as follows Under
resolution 11. : ihat he had not changed the mode of publication for the reason that nothing had
been definitely decided on by the Sydney Conference.
Under Resolution III.: Ihat there are now in Victoria the following first-class stations.
V 1Z -1» 1 9? pe otwa T? Wilson’s Promontory, Gabo Island, Sandhurst, Ballarat,
and Echuca. That Mount Macedon and Omeo are about being made first-class stations. Ecliuca
is the only first-class station established since the last Conference, any extension of the system
during that time, beside the alterations mentioned, being confined to third-class stations.
51. Under Resolution VII.: That soon after the last Conference he hadrequested the Victorian
Government to place him m communication with the Tasmanian Government in order to secure
then co-operation m the scheme. Through some misunderstanding, the application was not made to

authorities to join in the Australian scheme. The Government had been again directly invited to
send a delegate to the Conference, but in the telegram produced they stated that they could not
although they concurred in the objects sought to be attained by the Conference, and
promised to communicate with the chairman by letter or memorandum. The Honorable the Chief
feecretary of Victoria had been requested to convey to them the information that the Conference

had no doubt that the co-operation of Tasmania would in a very short time be secured.

to the Government, attention being drawn to this paragraph, with a request that precedence and


promptitude be accorded to weather telegrams. A perceptible improvement had taken place

upon the extreme south-west point of Mount Macedon, at an altitude of 3,500 feet, for the erection
of a self-registering anemograph, which would be in charge of an observer who, about 100 ee
lower, has a barometer, thermometers, and all the appliances of a first-class station. This would
be worked as a first-class station in about a month, with a continuous registration of the direction
of the wind The form of anemometer to be used will be a direction-vane with pressure-plate.
55: Under Resolution XIII. : That Mr. Russell, subsequent to the last Conference,
communicated to Mr. Ellery some proposed improvements in or additions to the code, but the
matter had not yet been discussed. . TT . , .
56 Under Resolutions XIV. and XV. : That nothing had been done m Victoria.
57. Under Resolution XVIII. : That the recommendation as to weather telegrams was
carried out in the telegrams from this station to the other colonies, except that the readings ol dry
and wet bulbs were sent instead of the dry bulb and humidity. Xo synoptical report is sent .
from this station to other colonies, and none is received. A long time ago two or three came, and
then they ceased. , . , .
■ 58. Under Resolution XXL: That nothing has been done in this colony m regard to the
use of a colored paper for weather telegrams.
59. Under Resolution XXII. : That the recommendation has been carried out
60. Under Resolution XXIV. : That he will hereafter report on Nos. 1,2, 3,5, and 6.
61. Under Resolution XXV. : That enquiries had been made as to the best spot in which
to place a tide-gauge on the south coast of Australia. That Gabo Island had been recommended
iis the besi position on the south-east coast, and Portland as another site. It was desired to have
Wilson’s tory made- a stat ion, but there was no place for it. He hoped to get one or two
of these tide-gauges erected in the course of the next eight or nine months.
Definition of First-class Station.
62. Resolved, on the - on of Mr. Russell, XXX. : That, instead of the definition in
Resolution IV.. the Congress adopt the definition of the stations given at the V ienna Congress,
and contained in the introduction to the Instructions for the use of Meteorological Instruments.
The Conference adjourned to Monday next, the 25 th April, at 10 o'clock a.m.

MONDAY, 25th APRIL 1881.
Present:
Mr. Ellery, in the Chair ;
Dr. Hector, Mi*- Todd.
Mr. Russell,
The Conference met at the Observatory at 10 o’clock a.m.
The minutes of the meetings held on Thursday and Friday last were read and confirmed.
65. Mr. Todd laid before the Conference the following suggestions to be discussed here-
after, viz.:— ,
(a 1 That with a view to the observations being referred to one uniform standard, a com-
' nlete’set of standard instruments be purchased for circulation between *he four chief
stations—viz (Melbourne, Sydney, Wellington, and Adelaide-the cost to be divided
between the four colonies’represented at this Conference. The instruments to comprise
barometer thermometer, max. solar thermometer, anemometer, and ram gauge.
OH 7SSe several instruments to be reduced to the readings of the standards
L‘) That although absolute uniformity in the form of publication of meteorological statistics
is not considered essential, whatever form is adopted should give ,
Barometer reduced to 32* and sea-level, at least at one of the hours agreed upon
aTSst Conference (9 a.m. ; 3 p.m. -,’9 p.m.) and the principal turning points,
also reduced, with the times of their occurrence.
jo. The temp, of the air at the same hour or hours, also max. and mi .
’ should be read at 9 p.m., and the min. at 9 a.m.
y . Wet bulb ther. readings at same hour or hours, or humidity,
a Amount and character of cloud, and upper current of cirri, or hi 0 h cloud.
1 ,«.rM .. 9 mm. It would be better .to ~,d the
SS. ,t“im. olid » p.m, end dietinguieh between mgh „d I .
(d) The chief stations at Melbourne, Sydney, Wellington, and M^Crsof
W foreo-oing, should give max. solar ther.; mm. on grass and wool, hours ot sunslune ,
ozone, 9An. and 9 p.m.; evaporation, read off at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m.


( e ) In addition to this, Melbourne, Sydney, Wellington, and Adelaide should publish
' hourly readings of barograph (reduced to 32° and sea-level), thermograph, and
( f) SgS Resolution XIV., passed at the previous Conference, that curve sheets, with
synoptic reports on weather, should be exchanged monthly; it is recommended that
these curves should show barometrical pressure at sea-level, temp, ol an, relative
humidity, dir. and force of velocity of wind, and rainfall; and that the synopsis should
be in sufficient detail to trace storms and other atmospheric disturbances. There
should be a sufficient number of stations selected in each colony to supply data tor
forming isobaric maps for every day. ... * i n _ „
(a) The adopted mean temp, to be deduced from the min., 9 a.m., max., and Jp.m.
' ' readings ; and at the four principal stations this mean should be compared with the
(h) Exposure of thermometer to be uniform, or, if that cannot be effected, the four principal
V J stations, or one of them, should mount thermometers on eacli plan adopted by the
other colonies, and compare the readings on each kind of stand with the readings ot a
rotatory thermometer in the shade. . „
(i) The dry and wet bulb thermograph readings should be compared with the readings ot
the standard or ordinary dry and wet bulb thermometers at 9 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m.;
and the readings of the thermograph should be referred to those ot the ordinary dry and
wet, or the correction supplied.
(k) The readings of the barograph should also be compared with the readings ot the
standard barometer at the same hours, and the differences given if not applied. #
(/) Rain gauges to be of one uniform pattern and size of receiving surface, viz., 8" m
diameter, and the mouth of receiver to be 1 foot above the surface of the ground, in
such a position as to be wholly unsheltered in all directions.
(m) Atmometer.—The form adopted at Adelaide is recommended. This consists of an
outer tank of brick cemented, 4 feet square, internal measurement; and an inner tank
of slate or marble, 3 feet square ; both tanks being filled with water to the same level.
The amount of evaporation is read off by means of a float carrying a graduated rod and
vernier, divided o*ol inch. .
hi) Observations to be taken at Melbourne, Sydney, \\ ellington, and Adelaide, at Oh. 43m.,
Gr. m. t., or 7h. 35m., Washington, in compliance with the request of the late
Brigadier-General, A. J. Myer, Chief Signal Officer, U.S.
Reports on Resolution XXIV.
66. Dr. Hector reported that he had experiments in progress upon the velocity and pressure
of the wind, and upon solar thermometers, but they were not sufficiently advanced to be reported
upon. Experiments had also been made with the swinging thermometer.
67. Mr. Todd reported that he also had made experiments on the subjects referred to
members, but that they were not sufficiently advanced to be reported. He found that the swinging
thermometers agreed very closely with the thermometers upon the stand, but were always lower
than those upon the old Greenwich stand, which had been in use for so many years. For shade
temperature he had for a number of years adopted two modes of mounting thermometers. In
one case the instruments were mounted on a modified form of Greenwich stand, which was always
kept turned with its back to the sun. The instruments are about 5 feet 6 inches above the ground,
and are protected from rain by a wooden shade. His experience did not lead him to think that
this is the best mode of mounting thermometers. The best plan he considered was a shed with
an open louvre roof, which will effectually screen the stand (which should be simply a skeleton
frame) and instruments from the sun, and yet leave free access to currents of air. This is
the other method adopted at Adelaide, and is well shown in a photograph submitted to the
Conference — [put in].
The shed is octagon shaped, 10 feet wide, the louvre roof being supported by eight stout
posts at a height (at the eaves) of about 7 feet 6 inches above the ground. The shed is floored
and the whole painted white. The skeleton frame, on which the thermometers are mounted,
revolves on a wooden standard and has a sloping back of well oiled and painted canvas.
Comparing the results of the two methods it is found that the mean temperatures on the
stand and in the shed, as well as those at 6 p.m. and 9 p.m., and the minima are nearly
identical, whilst the mid-day readings and maxima are higher on the stand. The maximum
reading in the summer on the stand is often 3° or 4° higher than in the shed. The difference is
less in the winter.
Taking the year through the temperature on the stand exceeds that in the shed at different
hours in the day by the following quantities :

Shade Temperature.
68. Mr. Russell reported that he had made experiments with the Greenwich stand that had
to be turned twice a day. With another, in which the exterior was composed of louvres, and the
interior a box in which perfectly free and carefully arranged ventilation was provided for, at the
same time that no radiation from the ground could affect the thermometers, and found that, if the
south side of the box was removed, it gave a temperature the same as the shed ; but, if the south
side or door was shut, the temperature was thereby raised two degrees. Had found that
thermometers placed on the south side of a wall with a box to protect them from morning and
evening sun, gave same mean temperature as shed.
69. That he had made a series of comparisons between a swung thermometer and a ther-
mometer in the shed with the following results :
Mean difference ... ... 0 - 2 Swung thermometer being highest.
Morning 10.5 a.m. —Greatest difference ... ... 2*3 Swung highest.
Evening 10.30 p.m.—Greatest difference ... ... o'6 Swung lowest.
Swung in sun sometimes as much as 3‘7 higher than swung in shade.
70. That to determine the difference of humidity as obtained from max. and min. ther-
mometers, and from the three daily observations of wet and dry bulb thermometers, he had made
the following comparisons of observations taken in July 1880 and January 1881, the result
showing a difference of 4*l° in July and 2*6° in January between the two methods.

Evaporation.
71. Having for the past ten years carried on observations with three forms of evaporators,
he thought the condensed results might he of interest to the members of the Conference. He
mentioned that observations with the glass evaporator were begun at Sydney Observatory in lob ,
but it was not until 1871 that the other two forms were placed beside it for the purpose oi
comparison. It was simply because the glass instrument was the one in use, that it was assume
to be the standard for comparison, and not for any advantage in form .or substance which it mig 1
be supposed to possess. The tin one had been adopted for use in the country, because its cost was
little, and the large one was started because it seemed to put the water into the condition winch
obtains in an ordinary open reservoir. The following details will form a sufficient description o
these instruments:—
Ho. I.—A o-lass vessel, standing on the ground, 8 in. high and 8 in. in diameter, in
which the water is usually about 6 in. deep ; it is read by a vernier scale attached
to a point which is every morning made to touch the water, by screw motion.


No. 2.—A tin vessel, painted white, standing on the ground, 12 in. high and 8 in. in
diameter, in which the water is usually about 8 in. deep ; the amount of evapo-
ration is ascertained by weighing it every morning.
No. 3. —Is a galvanized iron vessel, sunk into the ground 2 ft. 4 in.; it is 2 ft, 6 in.
deep, and 4 ft, in diameter. In it is a small float, to the top of which is attached
a light vertical rod passing through two guides ; this is graduated to tenths of an
inch, and read to of an inch by means of a microscope fixed on a firm
support; the edge of the vessel is only 2 in. above the ground, to prevent surface
water from running into it; and the grass is allowed to grow level with the top,
to prevent rain splashing in, and sun-heat on the metal outside.
72. The table herewith shows the result from each evaporator, together with temperature,
humidity, wind, and rainfall, for ten years, 1871 to 1880. It will be observed that the tin one
shows the greatest amount, the glass second, and the large one least, on the average for ten years;
but it is worth noting that in 1876, when the velocity of wind greatly exceeded other years, the
tin one gave the evaporation only 7 per cent, above the average, the large one 20, and the glass
28 per cent.
Observations on the temperature of the water in the evaporators show that the glass one is
most affected by the sun, the tin next, and the large one least.
73. In the course of the experiments the question arose whether more or less evaporation
took place during the day as compared with the night. The day was divided at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m.,
and the observations confined to the glass and large evaporators ; and it was found that the glass
one gave 42 per cent, more during the day than during night, and the large one 18 per cent, more
during day than night, and it sometimes happened that it was more during the night than during
the day. The result of these observations may be expressed in another way : Comparing the two,
the large one gave 13 per cent, less than the glass one during the day, and 23 per cent, more
during the night, which seems to prove that the heat absorbed by the large one during the day
was given off in vapour during the night, and not by radiation from the sides, as in the
glass one.

T 75. Another question presented itself, and was answered by several months’ observation
It was—What ratio does evaporation in the shade bear to that in the sun ? The shade chosen was
the thermometer-shed, where the air has free access, but there is complete protection from the
sun Ihe mean result of the measures was that 26 per cent, less evaporation took place in the
sae “ tllan * n tae &l ass evaporator in the sun, or comparing it with the large one, the result in
shade was 9 per cent, more than in the large one ; but, as the shade evaporator was placed 3 feet
above the ground, where the air would probably be drier than on the surface of the ground, where
it ailects the large evaporator, it is probable that a small evaporator in the shade would give about
the same result as one 4 feet over and sunk into the ground.

Shade Temperature and Thermometer Sheds.
and best EI j e JZ reported as , fol I lows Experiments with regard to true shade temperature,
shed ’ made h ere early in 1880. The thermometer stands
1 evioualym use at the Melbourne Observatory were—a Lawson’s stand, and, for a short time,
in March COrreCted f ° F tW ° months » Januai T and February, when observations were not taken. Large evaporators started


a modified Stevenson’s stand. Prior to 1865 a form of Lawson stand, movable about a central
column, so as to place its back to the sun three times a day, was exclusively used, but this was
done away with in favor of an ordinary fixed stand, of the same form, in 1865.
78. Occasional experiments with a swing thermometer had shown that, on hot days, m
which a rapid change of temperature had occurred in the afternoon, the thermometers always
indicated a higher temperature than that indicated by a thermometer swung in the air, and
vice versa after°a cold night, showing that the stand itself retained a temperature different to that
of the air a considerable time after an actual fall or rise of shade temperature ; and further
experiments showed that, in the ordinary small stands used for thermometer exposure, the
temperature of the material or the stand itself always lagged behind that of the air.,
79. In a Stephenson’s stand, made for one of the country stations (with vertical instead of
horizontal louvres), the indications were half-way between the Lawson stand thermometers and
the swin o, thermometer. It was evident, therefore, that, if we assume a correct thermometer
swun°* in’ the open air will give true shade temperature, thermometers shaded in the ordinary
wooden stands (Lawson’s or Stevenson’s) do not always do so ; and also that the mass ot
material in the stand, want of free traverse of the air through all its parts, its slow conductivity,
and its proximity to the thermometers themselves, were probably the chief causes. It therefore
appeared that the required shelter should be formed of some better and more rapid conductor than
wood, that the mass of material used should be as small as possible, and that the circulation ot
air around every part of this mass should be as free as possible; also that the thermometers
themselves should be as far as convenient from at least the more massive or worst conducting
portions of the stand, and thus free from the retarding effects of radiation. .
80. Actin-'- upon this, trials were made with shades constructed of zinc and galvanized
iron and it was soon found that under such shades the thermometers followed the swing thermo-
meter very closely, and when a sufficient and thoroughly open air space was allowed between the
sheets of a double screen of this material, and when no side screens were interposed, the swing
and fixed thermometers always read alike, even when the temperature of the air was over 100,
i the sun temperature 150°. Trials were made by day and at night, m both cloudy and cleai
wea th< r, and the indications were always within a fraction of a degree of that of the swing ther-
mometer while thermometers in the other stands differed from it frequently two or three degrees,

ill March 1880', which has been used ever since for shading the thermometers, and has given every
satisfaction ; and whenever an occasional trial with the swing thermometer has been made, t e
thermometers tixed it have always agreed very closely indeed. Sometmes, after: a-verycold
night they haw slmwn a slightly higher temperature (sometimes fully half a degree) than the
S JL„ thermometer, which is perhaps due t<> the ground beneath the shelter being less cooled by
raflijti luring the night. The shed itself consists of six uprights of wood fixed in the ground
carrying l dongle roof of galvanized iron, with low gables north and south and
west The ana covered is 12 feet by 12 feet; height of ridge above

the apex of the gable to within 4 feet 6 inches of the ground. The three other sides are fully open

exposed to the air in all directions, are out of the reach of driving ram. A photograph appended

The best method of measuring the velocity and pressure of the mind.
84. 1 have made numerous experiments in these directions since the
fssisz
to obtain to maximum velocities m high wind,,which cor
85. It was necessary, some months ago to thoroughly repair, therefore took
anemograph, as nearly twenty years’ wear had made it mal P t( V tion of the
the opportunity of introducing some
S r as U nowled tlfeffect of'securing a beautifully silent and smooth motion,
combined with equal sensitiveness. _ ,i;ff prpn i f rom the old form and the record sheet much
large,’, l“| ,‘X lo“™ • *» .Ml .1 the


wind covers 4i inches wide, and the velocity 5 inches for oO miles motion. An hour s movement
of the record proper equals about Jof an inch. The velocity pen—a glass one, charged with
aniline ink—fall shack to zero every hour by means of a clutch on the velocity-shaft, which is
released by an electro-magnet every hour, the conflict for which is made by the clock. Should the
velocity exceed 50 miles an hour, the pen moves a lever at the end of its Tange and makes con-
tact, allowing the pen to fall hack to zero at the completion of the fifty miles. This acts exceed-
ing well, and the pen commences its new curve the instant it has fallen hack to zero.
87. In order to facilitate measurements for short intervals during strong winds tlieie is a
second electro-magnet, which gives the pen an upward movement, when m action, forming a short
off-set on the velocity curve. By inserting a plug the clock actuates this electro-magnet every
minute ; the velocity curve is thus divided by cross marks every minute, and an easy way ot
obtaining the velocitv for short intervals is thus supplied. . „ „
88. The direction record is given by spring pencils on a pair of endless chains running over
two rollers, a cam plate throwing the pencils, not in position for registering, out of action. Ihe
more open scale of the record sheet, and return of the velocity pencil to zero every hour, enables
the sheets to be much more easily read off, furnishes more precise results, and the minute marks
on the curve made when the second electro-magnet is connected promises to be a very useful
addition for occasional requirements. ~. ~, .
89. There still seems to be some question as to the exact ratio 01 the rotation ot the cups to
the velocity of the wind in Robinson’s anemometer, as it is stated that this varies with the
length of the arms and size of the cups. It appears to me, therefore, very desirable to adopt some
method by which the results of the several anemometers in Australia shall be comparable. VV ltii
this in view I have lately made some experiments with Hagemann s vacuum anemometer, described
in the Journal of the Meteorological Society for October 1879, because it appears probable that
exactly similar conditions can be easily secured at each observatory for such an instrument,
which, moreover, has the advantage of being simple and cheap in construction, [he conditions
necessary are, that the height above buildings or trees, or like disturbing causes, and the size and
shape of the orifice of the top of the vertical tube, shall be similar in each case ; and perhaps
it may be also desirable to have the capacity of the floating air chamber nearly similar.
90. I have had placed on the Observatory a light mast carrying a £-inch gas-pipe, about
25 feet above the main roof, terminating in a nozzle similar to that described by Hagemann,
having an aperture of about 3 or 4 millimeters diameter. The pipe leads to a gasometer
arrangement in a chamber below, where a dial and index shows the amount of exhaustion in
the floating chamber of the gasometer, or in other words the velocity of the wind, according to
the law referred to in Hagemann’s paper. .
91. This apparatus has now been at work some weeks, and lias furnished very satisfactory
results ; the movements of the index are steady, making gentle sweeps around the dial with the
lighter winds,and bold and rapid ones in the strong gusts of a high wind. The steadiness of its
action will render making it self-registering an easy task.
From observations made with a dial roughly graduated to millimeters water pressure and
miles per hour, its indications appear to agree very closely with the Robinson anemograph, but of
course all the rapid variations of velocity lost in the Robinson are plainly observable in this
apparatus. I am so well satisfied with this form of anemometer that I have had constructed a
more perfect dial and index movement and carefully made spring than at first used, and propose
to make it self-registering by means of a lever marking on a drum covered with smoked paper.
Shade Temperature.
92. In regard to the experiments on shade temperature, Mr. Ellery mentioned that, during
the erection of the shed, experiments were made with side screens, which made a very great
difference in the readings, the thermometer, as soon as the current of air was stopped, showing an
elevation of temperature to the extent of 4° or s°.
Swinging Thermometers.
93. Dr. Hector enquired whether in swinging thermometers the shape of the bulb had been
observed to modify the results. Mr. Ellery replied that he had found that the shoulder bulbs
always registered too low when swung, although, when placed upon the stand, they read
correctly.
94. Dr. Hector remarked that this coincided with his experience, and had led him to
discard the shoulder bulb, for the form in which the bulb was of the same diameter with the
stem.
Evaporation.
95. Mr. Ellery stated that he had for many years adopted only one system of measuring
spontaneous evaporation, namely, that of a tank level with the surface of the ground. The height
of the surface in this tank was measured every morning at 9 a.m.
Black Bulb Thermometers.
96. Some years ago he made experiments upon black bulb thermometers, the results of
which were given in a paper read before the Royal Society of Victoria, and showed that, while the
* This apparatus has since been completed and is found to work extremely well. The pressure or velocity of gusts of wind
is easily measured off from the smoked paper curves, while a mean curve will give the velocity for any period.—R. L. J.


thermometer registered correctly up to about 125° or 130°, at temperatures over 125°, even with
the best instruments, variations appeared amounting sometimes to 16°. The experiments were
made in a room by means of dark radiation from a heated copper surface, within about three feet
of which the thermometers were placed.
9/. Dr. Hector enquired whether, after such an experiment, the thermometer returned to
its normal registration. Mr. Ellery replied in the affirmative : the instruments acted quite
correctly when placed in hot water; the variations appeared to result from variations in the
diathermancy of the glass. His opinion was, that not the slightest confidence was to be placed
m black bulb thermometers at temperatures over about 130°.
98. Dr. Hector stated that he had found that after 130° had been reached these thermo-
meters radiated heat from the back at a very different rate from that at lower temperatures. He
considered that the back should always be in contact with a substance of the same nature and
the same color. When the back was covered with a white cambric handkerchief, he obtained
higher readings than when any other material was used, while contact with black substances, such
as black wool, gave quite different results. The highest readings had always been got when
white substances were used, though these were not reflecting substances. It would appear that
after attaining a certain temperature the material of the instrument was altered in its power of
dispersive radiation ; in other words the curve of dispersive radiation did not coincide with the
curve of absorptive radiation.
99. Mr. Ellery suggested that the difficulty might be got over by using a bulb, one half of
which was blackened and the other half left bright.
I" 1 '. Mr. Todd said that, in comparing a thermometer whose bulb was lampblacked with
one whose bulb was of black glass, he found that the greatest difference appeared between them
when the sun suddenly shone out upon them. The lampblacked thermometer then showed
sometimes as much as 13° higher than the black glass.
101. Mr. Russell said that he had observed similar facts to those reported by Mr. Todd.
He remarked that the difficulty with the black bulb was to know the exact amount of vacuum
in the tube. Those instruments which he had lately got were provided with an electric contact
to test the vacuum.
102. Mr. Ellery said that the electric indications of the nature of the vacuum varied with
the purity of the air and other circumstances, and that probably observers would have to revert
to Pouillet’s or some other of the old forms.
Anemometer.
103. Mr. Russell suggested that, pending the solution of the best method of determining
the velocity of the wind, the form of hand anemometer now laid upon the table by him should
be used at first-class stations. He had ordered twelve of these instruments from London, at a
cost of fifteen shillings each. He explained the mode of using the anemometer, which was to be
held in the hand, and gave the velocity and pressure of the wind for two minutes at each
experiment.
Discussion ensued.
104. Moved—That the Conference recommend that, pending their final decision as to the
method of ascertaining the velocity of the wind, observers at second-class stations should use Mr.
Russell's hand form of Robinson’s anemometer.
The decision on this motion was deferred.
Cable arrangements andfinancial matters connected therewith.
105. Moved by Dr. Hector, seconded by Mr. Todd, and resolved —XXXII. That all accounts
for weather cablegrams be rendered to Mr. Russell and be paid by him.
Synoptical Telegrams.
106. The consideration of this subject was deferred, to be resumed in connection with the
subject of isobaric analysis to be brought forward by Dr. Hector.
Time at which Observations are to be made in the various Colonies.
107. Mr. Todd, in introducing the subject, said that he considered it desirable to take the
observations at the same hour by local time, but that in order to get out the results in time to be
of service to the general public, especially to persons interested in shipping, they should be taken
earlier than at present —say at eight o’clock a.m. If this were done, South Australia would
receive Sydney and Melbourne observations at 9 a.m., and the eastern colonies would receive South
Australian observations about 9.30.
108. Mr. Russell considered that no alteration in the present system was practicable.
109. Dr. Hector said that evening observations were far preferable for weather prediction
purposes to observations taken at 9 a.m.
110. Mr. Russell suggested that if 9 a.m. observations were transmitted with the 9 p.m.
observations of the previous evening predictions could fairly be made for the one day.
111. Mr. Todd moved, and it was resolved —XXXIII. That no alteration be made at
present in the time at which observations are to be made. A standing footnote to be made that
the observations taken in Western Australia are made at 7.30 a.m. local time.


Form of Telegrams from Tasmania.
112 Resolved—XXXlY. That weather telegrams from Tasmania shall be similar to those
received from Cape Otway, Portland, &c., and shall be transmitted in this form to Adelaide and
Sydney.
Form of Telegrams to Nero Zealand—Adoption of Isobaric Analysis.
113. Dr. Hector submitted the outline of a telegraphic code based on the is°banc andysis,
and pointed out that the whole system depended upon the assumption that the deductions which
had led to the adoption of the isobaric system in the Northern hemispher,3 were apphcaWe to these
colonies and with sufficient accuracy, to our present observing stations. He considered tliat tne
work done in New Zealand since 1877 had completely established that proposition. He saw no
benefit in any other system that could not be secured by the one he proposed, which would confer
this one in addition, namely, that the members of this Conference would use the terms now used
by meteorologists at home, those terms having been hitherto avoided in order to P!: ev ®“t any
appearance of attachment, on the part of the members, to certain theories. The method of curves
hitherto adopted was well adapted for the study of storms after the disturbances had passed over,
but did not show where the centres of storms passed, the observing stations not being movable to
follow the centres which moved very irregularly. The geographical curves used by the Sydney
Observatory were very useful, but he did not think that they gave a true idea of the grades of the
atmospheric disturbances. He moved that it was desirable to use the isobaric method of repre-
senting the weather upon our coasts. J . , tt u a L;n n .i A
114. Mr. Russell concurred with Dr. Hector s remarks as to isobars. He had not hitherto
adopted them, because he had felt that the observatories were not sufficiently numerous to enable
us to trace the lines ; but as the number of stations was being increased from time to time, and as
New Zealand and Tasmania were now probably about to join in the scheme, he would be very glad
to adopt the isobaric system. . ..
115 Dr Hector pointed out that the use of isobars would prevent the need for communicating
so many instrumental readings for weather purposes as are now sent, since, if a centre was mentioned
and the grade given for particular winds, the general character of the weather would be a matter
of almost necessary inference. He had no doubt, however, that for other purposes those readings
would be desirable. , , _ . . . ~ . v „
116. Mr. Todd was in favor of the isobaric method, and had been carrying it out lor some
time in connection with the intercolonial system of weather telegraphy, but had not published the
results, feeling that they rested upon insufficient data, owing to the fewness of barometric stations.
117. Mr. Ellery said that seventeen years ago work was done at the Melbourne Observatory
in drawing curves from logs of ships and tracing out the isobars. This was continued for neaily
two years° but had been given up as perfectly useless, since there were no observations to be
combined with those made at the Observatory, except such as were got at sea. . The work was
only given up because there were not a sufficient number of observing stations in Australia to
carry on the system. He thought it could now be carried out, and therefore supported the
motion. . . ~
118. Resolved unanimously—XXXV. That the isobaric system ot analysis of the weather
reports as in use in America and Europe, be adopted throughout Australasia on the basis of the
instructions contained in the pamphlet by Mr. Ley, published by the Meteorological Council of
Great Britain. .
119. Dr. Hector, as a basis for suggestions, had taken the study of two months isobaric
charts, which he produced. He had not been able to. find any critical place for New Zealand, the
atmospheric relations of different parts of that colony being so varied that no one place would
give the means in Australia of carrying the isobars through New Zealand : in other words, the
range of pressure within the New Zealand area was greater than the great range between the
centre and the outside of a disturbance. Thus a disturbance, which ranged from the Leeuwin to
Melbourne, might be so distorted as to be all existent within the small area of New Zealand. He
thought, therefore, that it would be best to give the highest and lowest pressures in New Zealand.
These islands, lie right athwart of all the disturbances that pass over them, which, as a rule,
follow the east coast line, under its lee from south to north. If, therefore, the extremes of
pressure each day were telegraphed when a well-defined centre of disturbance was shown passing
any of the aspects (but only in those cases where the grade might be considered as a source of
dangerous winds) ; if, for instance, a depression was making off Foveaux Straits, i.e ., off aspect
D, and if the depression had a light grade for N.W. winds, that information might be of great
use to Australia, since such depressions have frequently been observed to bring in a change to
strong wind from the S.W., and this might be the beginning of a very large depression, whose
diameter might exceed a thousand miles. Thus, if the grade were given, Australia might form
some idea of the weather to be expected along its east coast. He did not see that in any other
way the telegrams from New Zealand would as yet be of immediate use except for purposes of
study. Another point to be mentioned was, that when these disturbances —which often form a
consecutive series—had heavy N.W. grades, the series is inclined to the meridian at a different
angle from those previously mentioned. These points were not yet completely settled, but he
thought it would be necessary to indicate when a depression existed with a grade above o*o2 for
every fifteen miles of horizontal distance.
120. The general weather and all remarks would be referred to aspects as decided at the
last Conference. When in his report he said that these aspects were not satisfactory, he did not
No. 99. B


mean to imply that he had yet sufficient knowledge to say how they should be amended. As an
instance, he mentioned Bealey, the central station in the South Island, which is considered to be
in aspect D, but experience has shown that it ought to be regarded as in the West Coast aspect,
and not that of the East Coast, although it is upon the east side of the mountains. If at any
time he had to change the definition of an aspect, he would give notice of it, and explain the
reason.
121. He proposed to give the cyclonic weather for north or south winds, and what aspect
they are in, and the anti-cyclonics, which are of great interest, since, for some unknown reason, in
summer, when they should have low pressure, a high pressure occurred over the land.
122. Dr. Hector then submitted a double-entry code, prepared to exhibit the aspects of the
New Zealand coast, and the cyclones, anti-cyclones, &c.
123. Mr. Russell considered that what was wanted was to give such information as would
be useful to the public. It might not appear to be of much interest to the Sydney public to
know the general weather in New Zealand, but in reality it was of interest to business men and
all connected with shipping. Particulars would therefore be extremely valuable.
124. Mr. Ellery agreed with this view, and considered that a little extension of the cypher
code for New Zealand would give all that was required.
125. Mr. Russell thought that the telegrams should show the general state of the weather,
and the particular state, if such existed. He thought that the synoptical view of the weather in
each colony should be compiled by the chief officer of that colony.
126. Further discussion ensued, after which the principle of the form for synoptical
telegrams from New Zealand to Australia was adopted.
The Conference adjourned to to-morrow at 10 o'clock a.m .
ROB. L. J. ELLERY.
26/4/81.
TUESDAY, 26th APRIL 1881.
Present:
Mr. Ellery, in the Chair ;
Dr. Hector, | Mr. Russell,
Mr. Todd.
The Conference met at the Observatory at Ten o’clock a.m.
The minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.
Form of Telegrams from New Zealand to Australia , and vice versa.
The discussion on this subject was resumed.
127. Dr. Hector, in submitting a form of code, said that he had divided Australia into
districts somewhat similar to those into which New Zealand had been divided.
128. He proposed that, under the column headed “ Over the Land,” Australia should be
divided into the West Central and East Central districts ; the word “ General ” being used when
the phenomena reported were common to the whole. He proposed that the name of each station
should be only one word, thus—for “ Alice Springs ” the word u Alice ” alone should be used.
Reports should be sent from only one station in each district, unless some unusual phenomenon
appeared at one of the others, in which case its importance would justify the cost of reporting it
in full. The western section extended across the continent from Darwin to Adelaide, including as
its principal stations Darwin, Alice, and Adelaide. He suggested that Alice should be the station
selected for the Central District. The Eastern District he proposed should take a similar range
in longitude, its stations being Ravenswood, Bourke, Deniliquin, and Melbourne. The section
through Darwin and Adelaide he regarded as the plain country. That from Ravenswood to
Melbourne would embrace the country westward from the foot of the mountain range.
129. Mr. Todd observed that Darwin would report the tropical rains.
130. Dr. Hector considered that that would be very valuable information, as the weather
would probably be found to be to some extent controlled by these rains.
131. Mr. Todd remarked that the monsoon rains this year did not extend further than
twelve miles south of Tennent’s Creek.
132. After some discussion, Gunnedah, Tamworth, Bathurst, and Melbourne were selected
as the stations for the Eastern district, Bathurst to be the reporting station.
Dr. Hector proceeded further to explain the draft code, pointing out that the station
selected to report was underlined and proposed to be printed in italic letter.
133. The coast he had divided into aspects. Aspect A would be the promontory from
Perth to Israelite Bay (Weld), including the stations Perth and Albany, the latter to be the
reporting station ; aspect B was proposed to extend from Israelite Bay to Cape Borda, including
Eucla, Borda being the reporting station ; aspect C, from Cape Borda to Cape Otway, would include
Robe, Cape Northumberland, Portland, and Cape Otway, Portland to be the reporting station ;
aspect D comprised Tasmania, Hobart being its station ; aspect E, he suggested, should extend
from Cape Otway to Gabo Island, including Georgetown, Wilson’s Promontory and Gabo being
its reporting stations; aspect F to include Jervis Bay, Sydney (reporting station), Newcastle, and
Macquarie ; and aspect G should comprise Brisbane (reporting station), Rockhampton, and


Bowen. For exceptional phenomena, he considered that ordinary words should be used, and the
particular station be referred to by name if necessary. He moved that the decision of the Sydney
Conference relative to the division of Australia into aspects should be amended according to the
schedule handed in, as follows : , ~ p T
134. Mr. Russell considered that the arrangement made at the Sydney Conference, by
which each colony or aspect sent an account of its own weather, was better than that proposed.
135. Resolved—XXXVl. That the coastal aspects proposed by Dr. Hector be adopted.
136. Upon the proposition to adopt Dr. Hector’s division of inland Australia, Mr. Todd
proposed as an amendment that Port Darwin should be made a separate aspect, to be named the
North Coast aspect, it having a climate peculiar to itself and quite distinct from that of Central
Australia, as represented by Alice Springs ; also, that, instead of East Central and West Central,
the inland portion of the continent be divided into “ Central Australia ” and the “ Riverine
District.” 1 . i . , ,
137. Mr. Russell considered that storm centres were the most important phenomena to be
watched and that for this purpose the lines of barometers in the South Australian stations, on
the overland telegraph line, should be taken, and similar lines through the other colonies.
138. Dr. Hector explained that in laying out the proposed divisions he had looked upon
Australia as a large plain country, with a range of mountains on its eastern border. He had,
therefore, divided it into a Western and an Eastern district; the former being the whole of the
plain country, and the latter the country at the western face of the range. The deductions
regarding changes of weather arising in the south-east would be made by the coastal aspects
on the east coast, while changes passing to the south of Australia (which are of the greatest
importance to New Zealand) would be inferred from the successive coastal aspects along the south
coast of the continent.
139. Resolved —XXXVII. That the interior of Australia be divided into East Central and
West Central.
140. Resolved —XXXVIII. That the specimen code prepared by Dr. Hector be adopted
provisionally.
141. On the motion of Mr. Russell, it was resolved—XXXlX. That the daily telegrams
exchanged within Australia shall include the time of turning points of the barometer and shift
of wind.
142. On the motion of Mr. Todd, it was resolved —XL. That the members of the Con-
ference undertake to impress upon their respective Governments the need for promptitude in the
despatch of weather telegrams, and the desirableness of using colored paper for the forms on
which these messages are written.
Alterations in Code .
143. Mr. Ellery pointed out that the code had been found to be not quite perfect, but he
had no doubt that the American word method adopted in Australia was preferable to the figure
code, in which opinion all the members concurred.
144. Mr. Russell suggested that the present extensive table for direction and force of the
wind might be advantageously reduced to sixteen or even to eight words, since the clerks would
soon learn by heart so short a code, and there would be no need of constant reference to the
printed code.
145. Dr. Hector pointed out that, though as few as four points might be sufficient for
merely keeping a general record of the weather, yet, for the purposes of isobaric analysis, the
information should be as minute as possible.
146. Resolved:—XLl. The present form of the code in Table IV. be altered, as suggested
by Mr. Russell, and that the selection of code words be left to Mr. Ellery.
147. Dr. Hector suggested that every code word should consist of two syllables.
148. Mr. Russell recommended that in any reprint of the code, the sheet form should be
adopted.
Mode of carrying out Resolution XIV.
149. Mr. Russell submitted the form of diagram used in New South Wales. Mr. Ellery
stated that he now published no diagrams. Mr. Todd was of opinion that if the barometer
temperature, direction and force of wind, and rainfall records appeared on the diagram it would be
sufficient.
150. On the motion of Mr. Russell, it was resolved: XLII. That in carrying out
Resolution XIV. diagrams be used, in the form now submitted, on which shall be represented the
barometer, temperature, direction and force of wind, and rainfall curves. That the following shall
be the weather diagram stations, viz.:—Alice Springs, Brisbane, Albany, Adelaide, Sydney,
Melbourne, Hobart, Auckland, Wellington, and Dunedin ; and, provisionally, that the stations
shall appear upon the diagram in the order above named.
Co-operation of all Australasian Colonies.
151. On the motion of Mr. Todd, it was resolved:—XLlll. That the Government of New
South Wales be asked to move the Government of Queensland to co-operate in the meteorological
scheme of Australia, and to furnish to the Sydney Observatory daily telegrams from Brisbane,
Rockhampton, Cooktown, Normantown, and Cloncurrie.
152. In the discussion on this motion the members unanimously expressed their sense of
the great importance attached to the co-operation of Queensland,


153. Moved by Mr. Russell, seconded by Mr. Todd, and unanimously resolved : —XLIV.
That in the opinion of this Conference the results obtained under the present weather telegram
system prove that storm centres pass from west to east over Australia and New Zealand at such a
rate as permits of important telegraphic warning being given of approaching gales ; and that it
is of very great importance so to extend and complete this system, that it may include all
Australia and New Zealand.
154. In the discussion upon the above resolution, Mr. Russell, Mr. Todd, and Dr. Hector
detailed minutely numerous and well-marked instances of the facts upon which the resolution was
based. ( Vide Appendix No. 2.)
155. On the motion of Dr. Hector, it was resolved unanimously XLV. That additional
barometer stations be established in the interior of Australia, with the view of tracing the latitude
of passing storm centres.
156. On the motion of Mr. Todd, it was resolved XLVI. That the Government of New
South Wales be requested to communicate with the Government of New Caledonia, and that the
Government of New Zealand be requested to communicate with the Government of Fiji, in order
to obtain regular observations from those countries.
157. Dr. Hector stated that Mr. Holmes, a resident of Fiji, an able observer, had been
furnished by the Government of New Zealand with a complete set of instruments, and had
supplied statistics regularly since 1872, which had all been published.
158. Mr. Russell said that he had sent instruments to New Caledonia, with a request that
observations might be regularly sent to him, but that these had ceased to be received after the
first two months.
Daily Weather Map .
159. Mr. Russell proposed that a map, including Australia and New Zealand, be adopted
for plotting the information upon for daily publication.
Mr. Ellery submitted a specimen map.
160. Dr. Hector said that it was necessary that upon any map used for this purpose the
gaps in the mountains should be marked. .
161. Mr. Russell remarked that in New South Wales there was a meteorological pass ot
very great importance, which was a low place in the mountains at the head of the valley cut by
the Hunter River ; and stated that he could often see the storms coming from the other side o±
the range long before they reached Sydney. These disturbances came along the valleys, and
passed out upon the coast at Port Macquarie. VTT7TT an wi, u
16 9 On the motion of Mr. Russell, it was resolved:—XLVll. That the weather map be
upon the "scale of the map submitted by Mr. Ellery; that the projection to be used shall be
Mercator’s; that the direction of the wind be indicated by arrows ; and that the map shall include
New Zealand, Fiji, New Caledonia, and Batavia, &c. . „ ,
163. It was agreed that Mr. Ellery should have proof maps struck off, which should be
sent to the delegates,°in order that each may put in the principal features of his colony.
Tide Gauges.
164. On the motion of Mr. Ellery, it was resolved XLVIII. That self-registering tide
causes be established at the Semaphore, Guichen Bay, and Victor Harbor, in South Australia ; at
Portland and Gabo Island in Victoria ; in New South V ales, one at Clarence River in addition
to those now in use at Sydney and Newcastle ; at Brisbane in Queensland ; and at Pinkaro, the Bay
of Islands, Lyttleton Heads, Otago Heads, Peyseugar Point, and New Plymouth, m New Zealand
165 Resolved XLIX. That Messrs. Ellery and Russell be requested to report upon the
best form for, and the cost of, a tide gauge, to be adopted ; the report to be forwarded to each
member of the Conference as soon as the enquiry is completed.
Standard Instruments.
166. On the motion of Mr. Todd, it was resolved L. That, with a view to the observations
beine- referred to one uniform standard, a complete set of standard instruments be purchased fo
AS between the four chief stations-viz., Melbourne, WeUington, and
the cost to be divided between the four colonies represented at this Conference. The instiument
to comprise —Barometer, thermometer, max. solar thermometer, and anemometer.
P 167. At the suggestion of Mr. Russell, it was agreed that the results of companson shoul
be sent on with the instruments.
Conditions of Observation.
168. On the motion of Mr. Ellery, it was resolved-LI. That following «f
used for ordinary registration ; and the anemometer to be exposed near to, and upon the same
levei with, ti M r fi TolumovSTlhat all readings of the several instruments in use be reduced to a
common standard^ rat ion rf wag deferred unti l the results of the experiments should
be known.


Form of Statistics.
170. On the motion of Mr. Todd, it was resolved—Lll. That although absolute uniformity
in the form of publication of meteorological statistics is not considered essential, whatever form is
adopted should give—
a. Barometer reduced to 32° and sea-level at least at one of the hours agreed upon at
the last Conference (9 a.m., 3 p.m., # 9 p.m.), and the principal turning points
(also reduced), with the times of their occurrence. . ,
b. The temperature of the air at the same hour or hours, also the maximum and
minimum.
c. Wet bulb thermometer readings at same hour or hours, or the humidity.
d. Amount and character of cloud, and upper current of cirri or high cloud.
e. Direction and force or velocity of wind.
f. Rain during previous 24 hours, recorded at 9 a.m.
171. It was agreed that 9 a.m. local time should be adopted as the common epoch of these
discussion on the above resolutions Mr. Russell asked Mr. Ellery whether
in his experience so many as one per cent, of cases occurred where the maximum temperature of
the day occurred in the morning before 9 a.m. Mr. Ellery having replied in the affirmative,
Mr Russell expressed a doubt whether the cases were numerous enough to make their record of
any value, and his conviction that that value would never compensate for the disadvantage of
heating the thermometers with a lamp at night when reading them.
°173. The suggestion contained in Mr. Todd’s notice of motion ( vide par. 65 c /3) that a
maximum reading be taken at 9 p.m. was therefore rejected. .
174. On the motion of Mr. Todd, it was resolved LIII. That the chief stations at
Melbourne, Sydney, Wellington, and Adelaide should, in addition to the foregoing, give maximum
solar thermometer, and minimum on grass, hours of sunshine, and the evaporation read off at 9
a.m. and 9 p.m.
Ozone.
175. On the proposition contained in Mr. Todd’s notice of motion, that ozone observations
be made at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., Dr. Hector moved, Mr. Russell seconded, and it was unanimously
resolved—LlV. That, on account of the uncertainty of the tests adopted to detect ozone, the
continuance of observations on ozone be optional with each director.
Hourly Readings at Principal Stations.
176. Mr. Todd moved, That in addition to the observations already resolved on, Melbourne,
Sydney, Wellington, and Adelaide should publish hourly readings of barograph (reduced to 32°
and sea-level), thermograph, and anemograph. The motion was negatived.
Curve Sheets and Synopses.
177. On the motion of Mr. Todd, it was resolved—LV. That (carrying out Resolution
XIV. passed at the previous Conference) curve sheets with synoptic reports on weather should be
exchanged monthly : it is recommended that these curves should show barometrical pressure at
sea-level, temperature of air, direction and force or velocity of wind, and rainfall, and that the
synopsis should be in sufficient detail to trace storms and other atmospheric disturbances. There
should be a sufficient number of stations selected in each colony to supply data for forming
isobaric maps for every day.
Adopted Mean Temperature.
178. Mr. Todd moved, That the adopted mean temperature should be deduced from the
min., the 9 a.m., the max., and the 9 p.m. readings, and that at the four principal stations this
mean should be compared with the hourly means.
179. Mr. Ellery, in reply to a question, stated that at his Observatory the mean was
arrived at by taking the mean of all the observations of the day, and applying to it a correction
deduced from the hourly observations.
180. Mr. Russell preferred to have the max. and min. observations without any correction.
181. Mr. Todd concurred with Mr. Russell, and explained that he read his min. at 9 a.m.
and max. at 9 p.m. It of course occasionally happened in the summer that a lower temperature
than the min. recorded at 9 a.m. was reached at a later hour during the same day when a
southerly wind set in after a hot wind.
182. Dr. Hector considered that it would be sufficient to take as the mean for the day the
mean of the max. and min., as the thermograph gave all the intermediate variations. He much
preferred morning readings to those taken in the evening.
183. In deference to a general consensus of opinion, Mr. Todd consented to omit the
recommendation of using the 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. readings in deducing mean temperature.
184. Whereupon it was resolved —LVI. That the adopted mean temperature be deduced
from the max. and min. of the day read at 9 a.m., and at the four principal stations this mean
should be compared with the hourly means obtained from the thermograph.


Exposure of Thermometers.
185. Mr. Todd moved, That the exposure of thermometers be uniform, or, if that cannot be
effected, the four principal stations, or one of them, should mount thermometers on each plan
adopted by the other colonies and compare the readings on each kind of stand with the readings
of a rotatory thermometer in the shade.
186. Mr. Russell suggested that this would not be necessary if a thermometer were sent
round for comparison.
187. Mr. Ellery remarked that the proposal might be referred for a report to be brought
up with the further experiments to be made with swing thermometers, and the motion was post-
poned accordingly.
Dry and Wet Bulb Thermometers.
188. Mr. Todd moved, That the dry and wet bulb thermograph readings should be com-
pared with the readings of the standard or ordinary dry and wet bulb thermometers at 9 a.m.,
3 p.m., and 9 p.m., and the readings of the thermograph should be referred to those of the
ordinary dry and wet, or the corrections supplied. He suggested that this might be left to each
person who had a thermograph.
189. Mr. Russell enquired what was to be done with the thermograph registrations—were
they published ?
Mr. Ellery and Mr. Todd replied that theirs were not.
Dr. Hector said that he had never taken any.
190. The motion was negatived.
Rain Gauges.
191. On the motion of Mr. Todd, it was resolved— LVII. That rain gauges be of one
uniform pattern and size of receiving surface, viz., 8" in diameter, and that the height of the
mouth of the receiver above the surface of the ground be stated in the published observations.
192. In the discussion upon this resolution, Dr. Hector mentioned that he was in the habit
of causing a small mound of earth to be raised, into which the rain gauge was sunk up to within
6 iuclies of the lip.
193. Mr. Ellery disapproved of the artificial knoll.
Atmometer.
194. Mr. Todd moved, That the form of atmometer adopted at Adelaide be recommended.
This consists of an outer tank of brick cemented, 4 feet square internal measurement, and an
mu, r tank' of slate or marble, 3 feet square or 3 feet in diameter, both tanks being filled with
rto the same level. The amount of evaporation is read off by means of a float carrying a
graduated rod and vernier divided into o*ol inch.
195. Resolved—LVlll. That the consideration of the best form of evaporator be deferred
to the next meeting of the Conference.
Form for Reports on Stations.
196. Mr. Russell said it had been remitted to him to prepare some form in which the
members should furnish a description of their stations. He produced form providing for—(L) A
ription of the instruments in use at the Observatory, or on stations containing recording
instruments ; (2.) The names and positions of stations having barometers and thermometers, &c.;
and (3.) The number of stations having rain gauges, or rain gauges and thermometers.
197. Resolved—LlX. That the form of return prepared by Mr. Russell for reporting
stations and their equipment be adopted.
Defective Max. and Min. Thermometers.
198 Mr Todd drew the attention of the Conference to a common defect in maximum
thermometers received from Messrs. Negretti and Zambra. When these mstruments were put into
the ordinary approximately horizontal position the column of mercury ran down two three
degrees, from the expansion of the air near the bend of the tube. , i i a( j f oun( j
“""SS* S,‘ElSjSd th.t h. formerly hod much trouble with .the* but it W
never occurred since he had obtained them through the Kew authorities. nearlv all were
201. Mr. Todd remarked that he got most of Ins in the Wause of tKstaTce
similarly defective. To return them was practically impossible, partly because ot the d
and Mter'kte&rttr'discuS ft wlfagreed that it would be best to draw the attention
of the of the Board of Trade to the facts, m order that the evil might
be remedied.


Estimates of Force , fc., of Wind. — Anemometer.
203. Mr. Russell again drew attention to the question whether the present mode of
estimating the velocity of the wind where there was no anemometer should be continued, or
whether some better means should be adopted.
204. Dr. Hector considered that, for ordinary weather-reporting stations, the estimates
were sufficient.
205. Mr. Todd placed very little reliance upon estimates, but feared that, at most of the
stations, the instrument devised by Mr. Russell would be of little use, since the officer would
seldom take the trouble to go out of the shelter of the building. At light-houses and such places
he would be quite prepared to place a Robinson’s anemometer, and have it registered.
206. Mr. Ellery said he proposed to try Mr. Russell’s form of Robinson’s anemometer at
some of the light houses on the coast, in order to test its value for measuring velocity of the wind.
The Conference then adjourned to to-morrow , at 10 o'clock.
ROB. L. J. ELLERY.
27/4/81.
WEDNESDAY, 27th APRIL 1881.
Present:
Mr. Ellery, in the Chair ;
Dr. Hector, Mr. Todd.
Mr. Russell,
The Conference met at the Observatory at Ten o’clock a.m.
The minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.
Co-operation of Tasmania.
207. Mr. Ellery drew attention to the fact that the communication from the Tasmanian
Government, which the Conference had been informed would be made before the meetings
terminated, had not yet been received.
208. On the motion of Dr. Hector, it was unanimously resolved : —LX. That the evidence
before the Conference shows the paramount importance of obtaining the co-operation of Tasmania
Australian meteorology ; and the Conference therefore requests Mr. Ellery, the representative
of Victoria, to continue the steps he has already taken to secure the practical co-operation of that
Government as soon as possible.
Weather Maps.
209. The method of securing perfect uniformity in the maps was discussed and agreed
upon. r
Rain Gauges.
r Mr. Bussell stated that it had come to his knowledge that ram gauges were offered
,? r sa T®’ /J 11 / Y ei ’ e , actually sold, which had an error of as much as ten per cent.; and that he
thought it desirable to point out to all persons interested in rain measurement the necessity for
having accurate means of measurement. On his motion it was resolved:—
-11. LXI. That this Conference, in view of the importance of and general interest taken
observers t 0 use none but certified eight-inch rain gauges ;
h * h ember of tbe Confer e n ce undertakes to certify to the accuracy of rain gauges
Sliding Scale for Reducing Barometrical Observations.
212. Mr. Russell stated that during the past few months he had devised a slidino- scale for
reducing barometrical observations for weather purposes, a copy of which he submitted In his
experience it had to a great extent obviated the risk of error in reduction. Its use could'be taken
kLwtT ° nl J- a f6 c mmutes ’ instruction being required even by a person who had no
knowledge of the ordinary forms of computation. A calculation had to be made for each station
and from its result a curve was plotted ; this curve varied with the altitude. ’
serve fo/ail SUggeSted that a senes of diagrams might be constructed which should
use it watw’ a f e « d that . tbe suggestion was practicable, but had found that, for actual
could be easityseen. PUte for each statlon and plot it with its name upon the scale so that it
the scale! 5 ' EUery enquired Whether the index error of each barometer was indicated upon


216. Mr. Russell replied that he had introduced that element, so that the diagram gave
the reading corrected for index temperature and altitude.
217. Mr. Todd stated that he had for each station a small card, upon which all the
corrections were included for index error, altitude, and reduction to 32°.
218. Mr. Russell said that in constructing the diagrams computations were made for
40° and 80°.
219. Mr. Ellery said that in his opinion the method would he found as valuable as
Mr. Russell’s hygrometric sheet had been, and the other members of the Conference agreed in
approving of Mr. Russell’s plan.
Report .
220. Dr. Hector moved, and it was unanimously resolved—LXll. That the foregoing
minutes be adopted as the Report of the Conference, and that the Chairman be requested to report
them to the Government of Victoria, with a request that copies of them may be transmitted to
the other colonies. ,
221. A vote of thanks to Mr. Ellery for his services as Chairman, and tor the accommoda-
tion afforded to the Conference at the Observatory, was passed unanimously.
The Conference then terminated.

APPENDIX No. 2. —( Vide paragraph 154.)
The following extract from the Adelaide Meteorological Report for the month of May 1879 was put
in by Mr. Todd, and affords evidence of the easterly progressive motion of atmospheric disturbances :
The mean barometer was about o'o6 inch to o*o7 below the average of the previous twenty-two years. It ranged high
—or above 30 —during the first half of the month, or till the 17th, attaining a maximum (30*485) at Adelaide on the 9th ;
and was below 30 from the 17th to the 29th, reaching a minimum (29*482) on the evening of the 20th, or 29*358 at Cape
Borda on the morning of the 21st. The high pressure prevailed over the centre of Australia till the 17th, and the records
of other colonies, as well as ships’ logs, show that this area of high pressure extended not only over the whole of Australia,
but far to the westward in the Indian Ocean, probably even to longitude 70° east, as vessels from the westward report high
barometer, one stating that it stood as high as 30*400 for fourteen days during the first half of May. It was broken by a
depression between the 10th and 12th at Eucla, where, however, it was only slight, not going below 30*1 ; but more marked
to the eastward, at Cape Northumberland, where the barometer fell from 30*45 on the 9th to 29*78 at midnight of the 12th
and 13th ; the depression was also slightly felt at Alice Springs, in the centre of the continent. The prominent baro-
metrical feature of the month was the large depression, which commenced generally on the 15th, setting in from the west-
ward. Thus Perth, on the west coast, reports a fall of about one-quarter of an inch between the 12th and 13th. but at
Cape" Borda the downward tendency did not commence till noon of the 15th, and Tasmania on the 16th. By ships’ reports,
the centre of this depression appears to have passed about 200 miles south of Cape Leuwin on the 19th. The minimum
pressure at Perth occurred also on the 19th, 29*381 ; Eucla, 29*34, at 3h. p.m. on the 20th ; Cape Borda, 29*358, at 3h. a.m.
on the 21st ; Cape Northumberland, 29*401, at 3h. p.m. on the same day ; and Ilobart, 29*05, about midnight on 21st and
22nd. It reached New Zealand on the 25th, the barometer at Auckland falling to 29*497 ; Wellington, 29*290; and
Dunedin, 29*293.
On the south coast this depression was preceded by rains between the 13th and 14th, the wind being from the 8.
along the coast as far as Cape Otway, and S.E. and southerly with high seas to Cape Howe, to the north of which along the east
coast the winds were W. and S.W., with a relatively low barometer, being four-tenths lower there than at Kangaroo Island.
On the 15th the S.E. winds reached along the south coast from Wilson’s Promontory to Kangaroo Island, with clouded skies,
whilst at Encla it was N.N.E. and overcast, under the influence of the advancing depression. On the east coast the winds
were S. and S.E., the weather being generally clouded from Sydney round to Eucla, the barometer showing a rise of two-
tenths at Cape Howe. On the 16th the wind was still from N.N.E. at Eucla, with falling barometer, but S.E. and easterly
along south coast from Wilson’s Promontory to Cape Borda, and southerly with heavy seas and rain on east coast ;
barometer steady then at Eucla. On the 17th wind stilt N.N.E. at Eucla, E. and S.E. along south coast from Cape Howe to
Kangaroo Island, and southerly -with high seas and falling barometer on east coast, accompanied with rain. On the 19th
the wind was from N. and N.E. in South Australia and along south coast to Melbourne ; but on the east coast the general
direction was westerly, with falling barometer and clear skies. On the 20th the wind was N.N.E. from Eucla throughout
South Australia to Cape Otway, and westerly on east coast, the sky being clouded in South Australia and Victoria, also in
the interior of New South Wales and along east coast. The north winds are maintained on the south coast, veering to the
N.W. on the 22nd. Westerly through Bass’s Straits and east coast on the 22nd and 23rd.
In connection with the extended area of high pressure prevailing during the first half of the month, and the
subsequent large depression, the progress of which we have just traced, it may be well to call attention to a cyclonic
disturbance to the west and south of the Mauritius, reported by Mr. Meldrun, as it seems not improbable that the
disturbance just referred to here originated in the Indian Ocean, to the north of that island.
The following is extracted from the Monthly Notices of the Meteorological Society, Mauritius, 17th June 1879
page 105:
“ Barometric depression of 25tli April to 10th May 1879 :—The mean height of the barometer on the 25th April was
“30*103 inches, from which it gradually fell to 30*043 on the 29th. On the 30th April and Ist May it recovered a little,
“ but in the evening of the Ist it began to go down again, and continued falling till the sth, on which day its mean height
“ was 29*895. It then began to rise, and on the 10th was at 30*033. The highest reading (corrected and reduced) was 30*146
“ at 9 a.m. on the 25th April, and the lowest, 29*862, at 3 p.m. on the 4th May.
“ From the 25th to the 29th April the wind veered from S.E. to E. On the 30th it backed to S.E. X E., and then
“ veered to N.E. on the 3rd May; was light and variable on the 4th, from N.N.W. to W. on the sth and 6th, from W. to
“ S.W. on the 7th, from W.S.W. on the Bth and 9th, and from the S. on the 10th.
“ On the night of the 3rd to the 4th May there was a thunderstorm, and also some thunder and lightning throughout
“ the 4th. From 9 a.m. of the 3rd to 9 a.m. on the 4tli, 3*75 inches of rain fell at the Observatory.
“ These atmospheric disturbances indicated the existence of heavy weather away to the southward and westward,
“ and it is now known that on the 6th May two vessels, the Maria Elizabeth and the Wagrien , were dismasted in about
“ latitude 29° S. and longitude 53° E.”
This last position, it will be seen, is about 420 miles E.S.E. of the locality given by the ship Windsor Castle on the
4th, in the following jiaragraph, which would show the storm to have had a progressive motion of about 210 miles per day
in an E.S.E. direction.
The ship Windsor Castle , from Port Pirie, in South Australia, to Antwerp, appears to have felt the full force of this
storm on 4th May, in latitude 27° 10', longitude 45° 45' east, or about 200 miles south of Madagascar. The captain reports
as follows: —
“Left Port Pirie roads (South Australia) on 13th March; passed Cape Borda on the 19tli. Had light S.E. trades
“across the Indian Ocean to latitude 27° 10’ S., longitude 45° 45' E., when, on 4th May, was overtaken by a cyclone, which
“ came on at the N. and veered by the W. to S.E. During this gale, and for several hours before its commencement, a
“ mountainous sea was running from S.W. Had for four days previous hot sultry weather, with light variable winds. In
“ the height of the storm the vessel was forced over on her beam-ends, and everything moveable on deck washed overboard;
“ two harness casks full of beef and pork, which were lashed under the topgallant forecastle for present use, were washed
“adrift, and their contents went overboard; the carpenter’s tool chest, which was lashed iu the same place as the cask,
“ was stove in and some of the tools washed overboard ; the lialf-deck and galley doors stove in, and one of the iron posts
“ wrenched off its hinges; the gig was floated out of her chocks and dashed against the lifeboat, both boats received
“ damage *, the force-pump was washed about the main deck and broken.”
On the 18th of May the barque Elizabeth reports experiencing a storm in 118° E., lat. 39° S., the barometer falling
to 28*9 inches.
The clipper ship Oberon, from England, on the same day, in long. 115° E., lat. 39° S., liad a violent S.E. gale, the
barometer falling to 21*16 on the 19th, having evidently sailed into the S.W. quadrant of the storm.
*“ ie harque Alice Mary , from Port Louis, on the 18th, in long. 114° E., lat. 37° S., reports the wind to have veered
to S.E., blowing a heavy gale with high confused sea. Fierce gale on the 19th, and the ship was hove-to from the 20th to
the 23rd.
The central depression passed therefore from the meridian of Cape Leuwin to Ilobart in about 60 hours, more or
less, and had a mean velocity of about 26 miles an hour ; but the velocity increased as the disturbance advanced
eastward, as between Cape Leuwin and Eucla it moved at about the rate of 570 miles a day, 650 per day between Eucla
and Cape Northumberland, and 960 miles per day between Cape Northumberland and Tasmania ; this increased velocity iu
neighbourhood of Tasmania may be accounted for by the supposition that the area of low pressure then lying to the
B.E. of Cape Howe in a great measure lessened the resisting medium in front. The storm off Madagascar had a velocity
ot about 2io a day, and assuming a gradually increased velocity to a mean of about 300 miles a day between the 6th and
b - nDg tbe i eu ™ ? n the 18th or 19th * Tt seems not improbable, therefore, that the storms were identical,
fi t laying passed southwards between Madagascar and the mainland of Africa, it recurved to the eastward, traversing
le lan Ocean to Australia, on the south side of the area of high pressure, which, however, did not move bodily off the
continent to the eastward, but gradually contracted and was dissipated ; thus we find on the 10th that the isobar of 30*4,
ic on lie 9th embraced an area of about 800,000 square miles, extending from Melbourne to beyond Eucla, with an
SvllVn?; 1 - / r(^T N ’ S V°lr ab , oUt 500 miles , was restricted to an area of only some 20,000 square miles over the
