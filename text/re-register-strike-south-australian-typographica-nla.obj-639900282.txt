The following extracts from a letter received from the Secretary
of the A. T. Union , Melbourne , are printed for general information :
“An attempt was made some time ago to force the
hands at both the Age and the Argus to sign an agreement
to give a fortnight’s notice, but the Society ruled that it
was impolitic, and the companionships steadily refused to do
so, when the matter was allowed to drop. . . . There
is very little chance of getting any hands from here. All
the men that are willing to work are at present engaged.
The Government will shortly require some thirty or forty
hands for the rolls, and the New Evening Paper, which
comes out on the Ist of January, about the same number,
and where they are to be got we are at present unawares.
Trade was never better all over Australia than it
is at present....We can confidently say that you
will be well supported by all the Societies as well as the
Union.”
The original of the above and a letter from New South Wales
can be seen at the Society's Office.
