POWER REQUIREMENTS AND RESOURCES
OF NEW SOUTH WALES.
By WILLIAM GORINI, M. Inst. C.E., M.I.E.E., M.A.I.E.E.,
Chief Electrical Engineer, Department of Public Works,
New South Wales Government.
This paper is divided into three parts. In Part I an in-
quiry is made as to the present total power in use in the State,
and an attempt is made to forecast the extent to which power
may reasonably be anticipated to be required in the immediate
future. In Part 11. will be found a discussion of the resources
available for meeting the anticipated demand; and in Part
111., the author has attempted to indicate in what manner these
resources should be developed in order best to provide for the
requirements so as to supply power at the lowest rates, and
in such a manner as to invite the establishment of new indus-
tries in New South Wales.
Each of these inquiries opens up a wide branch of discus-
sion, and the author has found difficulty in confining the paper
within reasonable limits whilst dealing thoroughly with each
matter deserving consideration.
PART I.—POWER REQUIREMENTS OF N.S.W.
It will be convenient to discuss this subject under four
headings, subjecting each in turn to such analysis as will show
the probable growth within a period, which the author, for the


purpose of discussion, lias set at 15 years, i.e., until 1930.
These headings are as follows;
A. —Manufacturing Industries.
B. —Towns Supply.
C. —Rural Supply.
D. —Locomotion.
As regards the first two headings, in attempting to fore-
cast the future requirements, there has been considerable pro-
gress up to the present date, of which a careful scrutiny en-
ables valuable deductions to be drawn as regards the future.
As to the second heading, i.e.. Towns Supply, the development
in New South Wales has been insignificant compared with
what has been done in other parts of the world, and with
what might have been expected in this State; whilst Rural
Supply is in a still more backward position.
Increased demand in respect of each class of operation is
bound to arise,, a number of factors conducing thereto. First
amongst these is the increasing tendency to apply power to
many classes of operation hitherto carried out by manual
labour, due partly to the spread of education opening the eyes
of the man in the street to the fact that mechanical power is
msily and cheaply applied, partly to the fact that electrical
supply has contributed greatly to that ease of application and
to the low price of power, and last, but by no means least, to
the absolute necessity, owing to the continual rise in rates
of wages, of minimising the use of human labour and employ-
ing power-driven machinery wherever possible. If the popu-
lation remained steady, these factors alone would cause an
augmented demand; but it is clear that the evergrowing popu-
lation of the State will cause an acceleration of the rate of
increase, which will be still further accentuated as manu-
factures new to this State, are, as they doubtless will be.
added to those already in operation. This is apart from the
possibility of the discovery of new mining fields which may
add to the requirements to an extent that cannot be fore-
cast. For these reasons it may be expected that the curve
of total demand for power will, at least for the next few de-
cades, rise at an ever increasing rate. Some idea of what


lhat rate will be may be arrived at by individual examination
•of the various classes of operations.
A.—MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES.
These are referred to under two sub-headings.
(i.) Industries Requiring Mechanical Power.
All the world over, excepting where water has been
used from time immemorial as a source of power, the
steam engine since its introduction more than a century ago,
for long formed the chief means of providing that motive
power which is essential in the majority of the industrial arts
and manufactures. Towards the close of the last century,
the gas engine asserted its claim for consideration, and very
little later the electric motor, coupled with the facilities af-
forded by electrical transmission, so proved its convenience
for the final application of power, that therb is now no
field of industrial enterprise where the electric motor is
not competing successfully against the older forms of prime
mover, this term being used in its broadest sense, relative to
the factory, to indicate any mechanism whereby any form of
latent or potential energy is changed into the energy of
motion for industrial purposes.
As above hinted, New South Wales has been notoriously
backward in connection with electrical applications, but the
State Statistical Register shows that since the beginning of the
present century a notable advance has been made, and elec-
tricity now bids fair to take its proper place in manufactur-
ing in Nbav South Wales just as it has so established itself
in other parts of the World.
The following figures, deduced from the State Statistical
Register show the average horse power in the State in use for
industrial manufactures of all classes, excepting, of course,
electrical power stations, from the beginning of this century.
The earlier records available are not in each case presented
in the same form. Consequently, years in which some figures
are missing or are otherwise confusing have been omitted,
and only those Where the statistics are directly comparable
have been included in this tdble.

The results as regards Columns 6,7, and 8, are presented
in the form of curves in Figure 1. These curves show inter
alia
That as might be expected from the considerations set
forth above, the curve of total power has a decided
upward tendency. Dividing the period from 1901
to 1913 into three intervals of four years each, the
increases for the successive intervals are: 10,648,
22,511, and 45,954 H.P. respectively.
That whereas at the beginning of the century the H.P.
suplied from other forms of prime mover was 112
times that suplied by electric motors, at the close of
1913 this ratio had been reduced from 112 to 2\.
That whilst the total H.P. (average used) had increased
3.12 times during this period, that supplied by elec-
tric motors had increased 108.7 times, as against
only 2.2 times for other forms of prime mover.
That whereas the electric motor curve shows an ac-
celerating upward tendency, the non-electric curve

reached a point of inflection in 1911, since when the
rate of increase shows retardation to have com-
menced, and the curve may be expected to fall
after a few years to a point where it will probably
remain fairly steady for some time, representing
the power taken by those industries for which di-
rect application of steam engines has been proved
to form at least one satisfactory solution of the
driving problems involved, after which it is possible
that it may slowly rise again.
In Figure 2. the same results are plotted to a
flatter scale, and the curves are continued in an upward direc-
tion until 1930. Two methods suggested themselves for con-
tinuing these curves; one the strictly synthetic method of
attempting to evaluate the respective influences of increase
of mechanical application, initiation of new industries, rise
of wages; and growth of population; a difficult though inter-
esting task, and though considered not adopted by the author;
the other, to find the equation to a curve approximating to
that plotted and then to simply continue it. This latter
is a short cut and has been adopted; but an attempt to apply
the former method serves to strengthen the results arrived
at.
The nett result is that for the next 15 years the increased
power demand for stationary industrial uses may be antici-
pated to amount for the whole of the State to a total of
197,500 11. P.. i.e., 381,000 H.P. in addition to that in use in
1913.
Of this total, 416,000 H.P. may be anticipated to be sup-
plied electrically, and the balance, 81,500 H.P., may be re-
garded as non-electric.
Allowing for diversity factor and losses, the 416,000-h.p.
will require 300,000 k.w., and will use, with a load factor of 23
per cent.. 600 million units per annum.
(ii.) Industries Requiring Power for Electro-Chemical
or Electro-Thermic Processes.
Consideration of the contributing factors referred to above
leads the author to include in this total the use of power in
industries new to the State though it is quite within the range


of ppssib,ility, tlutt anything up tq one half the figure sug-
gested for 1930 wav be required for electrochemical and elec-
trqthermic processes alone, in which ease that total would
be’ largely increased. r f l he chief products of these pro-
cesses gre calcium carbide, alkalies, and sundry allied pro-
ducts, and as regards electrp.-metallurgy, copper, high-grade
steel and aluminium.
Calcium Carbide.—ln 1904 the imports, less exports of cal-
cium carbide, into the Commonwealth, were 45,866 cwt.. valued
at £40,174. Nine years later, in 1913, these figures had grown
to 285,408 cwts., valued at £182.774.
In 1906 the autho'r reported to the Queensland Government
on a proposal to use the Barron Falls for the manufacture of
carbide. The scheme at that time fell through, and thus the
introduction of a new industry, which would have* been not
only the means of providing work for a large number of opera-
tives, but also a most lucrative venture for the manufacturing
company, and greatly to the benefit of Queensland, was for the
time being lost to Australia.
There is no reason why all the carbide used in Australia
should net be made in N.S.W.. and though the extended supply
of electric power advocated by the author later in this paper
might somewhat lessen the demand in future, yet for isolated
positions in the immense areas of the State which no power dis-
tribution scheme designed on present-day lines can hope to
reach, there will still exist a demand for acetylene lighting,
apart from the other uses to which carbide may be put, and
apart too from the manufacture of calcium cyanamide (“nitro-
lim’-), an article of considerable manorial value prepared
from calcium carbide, with of nitrogen avail-
able in a form easily assimilable by plant life.
The author visited carbide works at Avesta, in Sweden,
where also other most interesting electro-chemical and purely
chemical processes were in operation; also the carborundum
works at Niagara, but time did not permit of his availing him-
self of the kind permission granted by Dr. S. Eyde to inspect
the electro-chemical works at Rjukan, in Norway, where the
largest power station in Europe, totalling 145,000 11. P., sup-
plies woyks, wh,ere, amongst other things, nitrogen is extracted
frpjn the atmosphere by the Birkeland process.


Alkalies.—The electrical manufacture pf alkalies, particu-
larly caustic soda, chlorate of potash, and Caustic potash, is an-
other industry extensively carried on in various localities where
cheap power is available. The latest Commonwealth re-
turns for caustic soda show imports less exports to be
97,309 cwts.. valued at £55,102.
Copper.—Turning to electro-metallurgy, copper-retining is
already in operation at Lithgow and Port Kembla, and will
greatly increase if Australia becomes more self-contained as
time progresses, which is the more probable, seeing that the
practice of relying chiefly upon Germany for refining
is likely to be altered in the future.
Iron and Steel. — Lron-smeltiug and refining, and the manu-
facture of the higher grades of steel, are also processes in actual
commercial use at the present day. The author saw 7 working las:
year at Trollhiittan. the experimental blast furnace constructed
by the Swedish Jernkontoret, or Society of Ironmasters.
These works have since been acquired by a company, and are
used for preparing the highest class of iron wdiich is employed
for the manufacture of special steels. The furnace uses
about 2,040 k.w. and turns out over 20 tons of pig iron per
diem. The author also saw 7 at Avork a Stassano furnace at
Dunstan. near NeAvcastle-on-Tyne. producing from steel scrap
5 tons of high-class steel p.d.; two Ileroult furnaces, one
basic and one acid, at K. Lindenherg’s Steel Works, near
Diisseldorf, turning out about 3 and 10 to 12 tons p.d. respec-
tively; and finally, a Girod furnace at Krupp’s Works at
Essen, and also at the same place (not working at the time
of his visit) a Frick furnace.
Although the author was convinced that there 1 was a con-
siderable field for the electric, furnace 1 for steel-refining in
Australia it was only recently in conversation with Air. B. J.
Smart. B.Sc.. Testing Engineer of the Public Works Depart-
ment, that he re-aliseal Imw the ore's available in Australia lenel
themselves especially te> electric treatment. Mr. Smart states
that the 1 character of e>res, coke*, anel e>ther necessary mater-
ials 5 which as so far knenvn form the main source of the iron
supplies of Australia, is such as to prohibit the manufacture
of high-grade acid, eepen-hearth steel such as is required for
railway tyres, axles, boiler plates, guns, etc., the percentage


of phosphorus being such that it is necessary to remove this
by the basic process, the resulting product being better
adapted for the production of structural steel, rails, &e. He
states that by remelting basic steel on an acid bottom in an
electric furnace, say of the Heroult type, there is no doubt
that from results actually tried out, the steel produced is
equal to the best acid steel. Mr. Smart is of opinion that
the Germans have already been driven to some such course
in the manufacture of guns, owing to a shortage of acid
ores, and that a similar course may eventually be followed in
thU country.
It is clear that as development of the iron and steel re-
cources of the Commonwealth progresses, there will be a
greater need of the special classes of steel referred to, and
seeing that New South Wales has led the way in this industry,
the power requirements of the State in this direction are evi-
dently considerable.
Aluminium.—As regards aluminium, the author unsuccess-
fully attempted to obtain access to works in Scotland. Germany,
Prance, and America, where this metal is electrically prepared.
Though the principles are well known, it appears that trade
secrets, learnt as the result of experience, are jealously
guarded, with the result that every application to view was
answered by a polite invitation to visit the hydro-electric
works, regretting at the same time the inability to permit ac-
ces to the aluminium factory itself. Reference to the “Min-
eral Resources of New South Wales,” by Mr. E. F. Pittman,
Government Geologist and Under Secretary for Mines, shows
that there are extensive deposits of bauxite in the State, and
although cryolite, which it is understood is necessary for the
manufacture, is not obtainable here, neither is it so far as
one can learn in the other countries of the world where al-
uriiinium is manufactured, so that in each case it has to be
imported. At page 214 of the work cited. Mr. Pittman states:
“It is satisfactory to know that the ores from which it is chiefly
made in other countries occur in abundance in New South Wales.
. . . There can be little doubt that the aluminium-smelting
industry will be established in this part of the world before
long.” On this account it seems that it needs only com-
mercial enterprise, coupled with cheap electrical power, to
enable tbe manufacture to be started in N.S.W.


The author saw the hydro-electric works at Kinloch-
leven, where 50,000 H.P. are developed for this industry by
the British Aluminium Co., and the outside of the aluminium
works themselves both there and at Uauffenburg, on the
Rhine, and at Niagara, where again many thousands of horse
power are used in the production of this metal.
On this large subject of electro-chemical and electro-
thermic industries the author has collected more data than
it is possible to present in this paper. Enough has been said,
however, to show that a supply of cheap electric power is one
of the requirements of the State in this connection; and that
given this cheap power in a convenient, locality new industries
will be started for which tens of thousands of horse power
will be required.
B.—TOWNS SUPPLY
The extremely backward position not only of New South
Wales but of all Australia, as regards the electric lighting
of the smaller towns, has frequently been a matter of won-
der to the author. More than 20 years ago, in other countries
of the world, such as England, Switerzland, and the United
States, there were small towns on a par with the country
towns of this State supplied with electricity for lighting and
power. The reason of the forwardness of these countries
is not only, as in Switzerland, that water power is abundant
and cheap, for cheap fuel here counterbalances this consid-
eration, and if the price is necessarily higher, generally speak-
ing, the easier conditions of life here permit of a higher price
being paid.
One must go further to satisfactorily explain the back-
wardness of New South Wales. It is suggested that the
proximity of manufacturing centres with suitable machinery,
obtainable at short notice, together with object-lessons in the
immediate neighbourhood, afforded by paying undertakings,
sufficient to satisfy the more enterprising members of the
community, may largely account for the forward state of the
industry in the countries referred to. Unfortunately, the
corresponding object-lessons in New South Wales were in the
past, with few exceptions, only glaring examples of failure
of electricity supply, and if the causes of these failures be
sought, in most cases it will be found that the reason must be


laid at the door of bad engineering, together with a lack
of appreciation of the commercial considerations involyed.
In the majority of instances, the local authorities or com-
panies were badly advised, and it was attempted to make
street lighting pay apart from a correctly designed distributing
system for private consumers. Examples have come under
the author’s notice, where in place of a proper reticulation
a few miles of copper wire have been hung in the streets
without regard to the density of loading or the provision of
sufficient feeders and the calculation of drop, with the result
that the voltage on the consumer’s premises has varied from
240 at the power station down to 200 or less at the far end
of the mains. It is evident that in such cases the original
design lias not been entrusted to the care of a competent con-
sulting engineer. Cases have occurred where the consultant has
lamely asked a municipal authority what private lighting he
must provide for. The author emphatically submits that it is
the duty of the advising engineer to tell municipal authorities
what they need to provide for and not to ask them. In
most cases where a plant has been properly laid down ab
initio, and the mains system carefully designed to cater for
private lighting, financial success has resulted.
In addition to the set back in this State owing to failure
of certain early plant, the lack of any effective legislation en-
abling local authorities or companies to proceed on established
lines with regard to the borrowing of capital and the acquir-
ing of rights, has further militated against progress. The Local
Government Act truly permits borrowing under certain condi-
tions. one of which is that interest and repayment of loan funds
must be paid out of a special loan rate; and it is not allowed
for the profits of the undertaking to be applied towards pay-
ment of interest and loan repayments. The new Local Govern-
ment Bill now before Parliament will, if it passes,
remove this disability, and where in any district people want a
supply of electricity, they will have it in their power to obtain it.
The general initiation of town lighting in the past in this
State has for the foregoing reasons been too slow, too un-
satisfactory to permit of any comparative statement covering
past progress, for it is practically only within the last three
or four years that any progress at all has been made, and

As regards the last two items, the corresponding figures per head of population for the
two undertakings with winch the author was connected in Tasmania, were
Oannceston (water-
power) 100 units sold and 83
3 watts, and Oevonport (steam driven), 1903 fi
gnres, 39 units sold
apd.47'5 watts. Ttie estimate
s given below are thus seen to be conservative.
speaking generally, omitting reference to the larger centres of
population, prior to 1910, there were only a few antiquated
pia.pts in existence. Consequently, no attempt is here made
to present progress in the past ffom the beginning of the
century as under the first heading above, but a table is give'll
showing the progress made since their inception or rehabili-
tation of those municipal country town supply systems which
have been established on a sound basis.
As mentioned by our President, in his introductory ad-
dress. Victoria is ahead of New South Wales with 73 country
towns as against this State’s 40. On the population basis,
Tasmania's 0 country towns quoted by Mr. Myers, as against
our 40, with ten times the number of inhabitants,' is further
evidence of the backwardness of the Mother State.
As regards future requirements, it is surely not unreas-
onable to expect that every self-respecting community of say
I,OQO inhabitants and upwards will within the next 15, years
demand and obtain a supply of electric light. Of such com-
munities there were at the end of 1913 in New South Wales
no less than 113, with an aggregate population of 350.840, and
allowing for the anticipated increase of population as
from the Government Statistician's Returns, the number
which may be anticipated in 1930 is .170, with a population in
the aggregate of 500,000. requiring for lighting and small
power purposes, exclusive of the manufacturing industries.


■dealt with under heading A. above, 15,000,000 units per an-
num, with a maximum load of 15,000 k.w., or allowing for
where the requirements under heading A. overlap those under
this section, a total of 30,000,000 units per annum, with a
maximum demand of 20,000 k.w.
C.—RURAL SUPPLY.
The question of the use of electricity for rural supply has
been touched upon in the last two presidential addresses.
The extensive use of power in country districts for farm :
ing and other operations is a matter of great importance to
the State, owing to the high cost of labour and the necessity
above referred to of introducing labour-saving devices where-
ever possible.
In the past such use has been limited to those purposes to
which on the one hand traction engines, and on the other
stationary gas, oil and petrol engines can be adapted. If
electrical power could be made available on a comprehensive
scale in the country districts, its advent would give a great
impetus to the substitution of power-using contrivances for
all agricultural operations. This was recognised at an early
stage of the Murrurnbidgee Irrigation Scheme by the late
Commissioner, Mr. L. A. B. Wade, M. Inst. C. 8., with whom
the author was in collaboration during the earlier work car-
ried out by the Public Works Department prior to the creation
of the Commission in January, 1913, and later he acted as ad-
viser to the Commissioner in connection with the initial plant,
the transmission line between the plant and the new township
of Leeton, and the reticulation of the township. The com-
paratively low voltage of 2,000 was adopted on account of the
urgency of the work at its inception, a suitable generating
set of this voltage being available, but it was intended from
the outset to raise the pressure as soon as a comprehensive
scheme for supply to the area were adopted.
As to the reticulation, it is noteworthy that the poles and
wires are kept as far as possible in back lanes, half-way between
the streets; and the transmission line also deserves notice as
being, as far as the author is aware, the first instance of a
flexible steel pole transmission line in Australia.
The question of supplying the a'-ea surrounding Leeton
was under consideration, and a preliminary extension in one


direction had been run and a comprehensive report furnished
on the subject of extended supply when the author left the
State for England, &c., whereupon the responsibility for the
care of the undertaking was transferred to Dr. J. P. Y. Mad-
sen, from whom the author is glad to hear of the continued
success of the scheme.
General Farming Operations.—During his tour, the author
made inquiries as to actual cases of electrical energy distributed
on a large scale for agricultural purposes; and not only learnt of
large areas in Northern Europe so supplied, but was able to visit
two farms electrically equipped and a central station supplying
a considerable tract of country. This station was near Liibeck,
of 10,300 k.w. capacity obtained from steam turbo-generators,
blast furnace gas and coal being used for fuel. The energy
was distributed in four different directions at 30,000 volts
over lines of
co-operative associations buy from the supply company at
30,000 volts, and transform at 700 substations to 11,000, dis-
tributing at this pressure over 1140 miles of mains. Of these
five, the Grevesmiihletn Association, with a maximum load of
500 k.w., used in 1912/13, 608,700 units, paying therefor
£2,888 on a sliding scale (from 1.2 d. to 0.92 d. per unit), trans-
forming at 96 substations, mostly on individual farms, of
which the owners were shareholders in the association, and
retailing 527,703 units to the members at a flat rate of 2.4 d.
per unit, including all distribution charges. At the farm
visited were 11 motors, totalling H.P., varying in power
from 40 down to H.P., employed for threshing, chaff-cutting,
workshop use, grain drying, and sundry other similar opera-
tions.
Ploughing.—Enquiries with regard to electric ploughing
elicited some interesting data. Figures were supplied which,
substituting Australian wages and allowing the plant to cost 50
per cent, higher here, amount to from 4/6 to 12/6 per acre,
according as the depth of furrow varies from 4in. to 14in. These
figures allow for interest and amortisation, and for repairs and
renewals on a liberal scale with electrical energy charged at
1.5 d. per unit. The power required is at the rate of from 40
to 70 watts, per acre, and thq energy from 12 to 27 units per
acrf *' according to the depth of furrow.


Shearing.—Comparing the cost of electricity with oil as
the means for furnishing power for shearing, a 16 8.11. P. oil-
engine will suffice for shearing 180,000 sheep, with a six weeks'
season, at a cost of £BO, including all charges as above. An
electric motor will do the same work with electricity at 1.5 d.
per unit for £36. the power required being at the rate of about
80 watts per thousand sheep, and the energy used about 24
units per thousand sheep. If, then, the 40 million sheep of
the State were sheared electrically, some 3.200 k.w. would be
required, and the energy used would be in the neighbourhood
of one million units. The load factor is necessarily low, but
when taken in conjunction with other rural uses, sheep-shear-
ing would help to fill up the gaps caused by the cessation of
other agricultural or pastoral operations, so as to maintain an
•even load curve.
Dairy Work.—The author visited a dairy farm of 200 cows
in Limburg, in Holland, where 44-h.p. was in use for milking,
refrigerating, butter-making, etc., a considerable portion of the
work being carried out electrically. There are approximately
•650 dairy factories in N.S.W., the majority of which use any-
thing between 4 and 24-h.p. each; 6,500 k.w. would be required
for this purpose, with a total consumption of three million units
per annum.
IRRIGATION.
Tallis again is a possible list' which must he kept in
view. Irrigation by means of electric pumping from a large
Station has transformed whole tracts of country in Califor-
nia from desert into orchard land of high value.
Whilst these various uses will undoubtedly in the future
•cause a great and increasing demand for electrical power, some
idea of the extent of which may be gathered from the above con-
siderations, in order to forecast the probable requirements the
best plan is to adopt some conservative figdfe on which to
hazard a guess.
Taking the cultivated area of the State as 3,000,000 acres
and allowing 1 k.w. to every 100 acfeS, if & gehefal power
supply were available to-day, there would be a demand of
50,000 k.w., and in 15 years’ time this should, for the reasons
given in the prefatory remarks dbove, be more than doubled,
or should at least reach 100,000 k.w., with an annual consumption
of 100,000,000 units.

Owing to the intermittent character of the agricultural
work the load factor is unusually low in this case, but com-
bined with a town supply the average load factor is reason-
ably high, and seeing that each rural district has its adjacent
country town or towns, the catering for the requirements of
these two classes of demand will eventually need to be con-
sidered together in detail for each area supplied. This ques-
tion is further dealt with under Part 111.
D.—LOCOMOTION.
This subject naturally divides itself under three headings :
X) Tramways.
(ii.) Urban and Suburban Railways.
(iil.) Main Line Railways.
(i.) Tramways: —
Our Past President, Mr. 0. AY. Brain. M.lnst.H.K..
lias kindly supplied figures relative to the growth of the New-
South Wales Government tramways since 1900. from w-hieh the
following table has been prepared:—
It will be seen that the rapidity of the growth was great-
est from 1909 to 1913. and that it has since somewhat dropped
The electrification of the Newcastle trams will shortly be
ebtnplefed. and probably new systems will be started in other


towns of the State, with perhaps some inter-urban lines be-
tween adjacent towns suitably situated —such, for example, as
the coastal towns from Port Kembla northward—yet the pos-
sible competition of self-contained motor-driven vehicles, whe-
ther petrol or electric, such as caused unforeseen interference
with the London County Council’s tramway receipts must not be
overlooked. And further, the city and suburban railways will
relieve tram traffic and retard the increase which would other-
wise occur. However, it may be assumed that the increase will
be at least half as much as the average increase from 1901 to
1914. thus making a total for 1930 of say 35.000 k.w. and 145
millions of units.
(ii.) Urban and Suburban Railways: —
.Air. J. C. Bradfield. ALE.. ALInst.C.E.. Chief Engineer for
Aletropolitan Railway Construction, has kindly supplied fig-
ures with respect to this subject.
For the complete electrification of the Suburban Railways,
viz., the existing railways as far as Parramatta, Hornsby,
Bankstown, and Oatley, and for the proposed City Railway and
Eastern, AVestern, and Northern Suburbs Railways, 130,000 k.w.
will be required.
Air. Roger T. Smith, in his paper on “Some Railway Con-
ditions Governing Electrification,” read before the Institution
of Electrical Engineers in February, 1914, gives the average
load factor of such a railway as from 45 to 55 per cent.; but
taking the more moderate figure of 23 per cent., the annual
energy requirements for these railways will be 260 millions of
units. ■
It is not anticipated that this electrification will be com-
plete until 1920 or later. The growth beyond these dates will
depend upon the growth of Sydney. Doubtless other Suburban
Railways will be electrified in the neighbourhood of Newcastle,
and possibly of other important centres, so that by 1930 it is
not unreasonable to* anticipate that 150,000 kilowatts will be at
work, using a total of 300 million units.
(iii.) Main Line Railways: —
The conditions under which railway electrification for main
line traffic is feasible have, so far as Great Britain, is concerned,


been ably dealt with by Mr. Roger Smith in the paper just
quoted. I] is conclusions are that, whereas for reasons now well
understood, for urban and suburban traffic, electrification is an
absolute necessity, the electric locomotive has yet to be desig-
ned capable of competing with the steam locomotive under
British main line conditions, with a draw-bar pull of say 7,500
te IO.OOOIbs. at speeds in excess of 40 or 45 miles per hour. He
does not question that such a locomotive can be designed, but he
points out that the low cost of the best English coal (12/6 per
ton) is one of the factors making against main line electrification
in Great Britain. For goods traffic, on the other hand, he re-
capitulates the advantages of the electric locomotive, showing
how essentially it suits this class of traffic.
The arguments in favour of goods traffic apply with still
greater force in this country, where in many cases the grades
are greater than in Great Britain, and heavy loads require to
be hauled for great distances; but as regards passenger traffic,
New South Wales conditions are different to British, for on
the one hand few of our trains exceed speeds of 40 or 50 miles
an hour, and on the other hand, owfing to the great distances, the
cost of haulage brings the price of coal at inland centres for
locomotive use to a very high figure; and if central stations
deriving their power from either water or from local coal, per-
haps not suited for locomotive burning, were to provide elec-
trical energy at fairly low rates, many of the interior railways
of the State, especially those in hilly countries, could be worked
at a cost considerably below that of steam traction.
As this subject is to a large extent problematical, the
author does not include any forecast of the amount of electri-
cal energy likely to be used for this purpose during the period
under consideration.
As indicating the extent to which power is used for the
railways of the State at the present time, Mr. E. E. Lucy,
M.l.Mech.E., Chief Mechanical Engineer of the State Govern-
ment Railways, has kindly furnished the author with the fol-
lowing information. The total tractive power of the main line
locomotives (that is, exclusive of those used for suburban pas-
senger train service) in use at any ©ne time, is 21,729,8941b5.
This rhay be taken as equivalent to a total of 605,256 b.h.p. The
consumption of coal for these services during the year ending
December 1914 was, for main line passenger locomotives,

estimated yearly increase of traffic is stated to be 8 per cent, on
the previous year’s business. Assuming this rate of increase
to continue till 1930, the total power would be equiva-
lent to 2,205.000 b.b.p.. and the coal for the two classes of ser-
vice as follows:
Tons op Coal fok 1930.

Goods . . . . . . 1.596.580
Total . . 2.365.860
Integrating the coal which would be used from 1916 to 1930
inclusive, the sum is 21 -8 million tons. Owing to the relative
economy of fuel, a large part of this would be saved for each
part of the main line electrified.

Summarising now the anticipated demand for electrical
power and energy, we have as follows for the probable require-
ments for 1980:

and Power Supply Corporation. Mr. Guy Allbut, City Electri-
cal Engineer of Newcastle, and a number of the town clerks
and managers connected with the various electric supply sta-
tions throughout the State, have favoured the author with data
dealing with the growth of their respective undertakings, which
show the very rapid rise in the demand since the commence-
ment of the century. They' agree in the main with the figures
shown in tin* Statistical Register, which are set down in the
following table: —
These figures, including the totals from Table 4, are plot-
ted in Figure 3, the intervening years between 1913 and 1930
being filled in by a dotted line, showing approximately in what
way, from year to year, th.e curves may be expected to rise,
though it is to be noted that the irregularities which may be
expected from three to five years hence, from the sudden in-
creases, owing to the electrification of the city and suburban
railways, are smoothed out.
From these curves it may be seen that the following are
the figures, so far as obtainable, for successive periods of five
years each from the beginning of the century to the current
year, and thence estimated to 1930: —


The forecast for the five years from 1915 to 1920 thus
shows a probable increase of 106,000 k.w., with an output of
312 million units. Preparation for this increase needs to be
taken in hand immediately.
If all the units under the curve from 1916-30 inclusive were
provided by the most efficient steam-plant obtainable, allowing
the extreme figure of 1,000 units per ton of coal, no less a quan-
tity than 14.3 millions of tons would be used for this purpose.
Adding the 21.8 million tons for main line passenger and
goods locomotives, it is seen that the total coal that may
be expected to be used for power purposes, if all the power
is so derived for the years 1916 to 1930, is 36.1 millions of
tons. Whether part of these coal resources may be saved
by the substitution of water power is amongst the subjects
discussed in the next part of this paper.
PART II.—POWER RESOURCES OF NEW SOUTH
WALES.
Turning next to the Power Resources of the State, these
are limited in the main to two only:—Coal and Water.
Certainly there are supplies of wood in some parts of the
country which can be either burnt in boilers or carbonised, and
the charcoal used for suction gas-engines. For small powers,
in the absence of a comprehensive power supply scheme, suc-
tion gas derived from charcoal is one of the cheapest sources
of power available; but the supply is limited, and the inevitable
result of starting works, especially if of any magnitude, depen-
dent upon wood, is that the available supplies in the neigh-
bourhood are quickly exhausted, with the’ consequence that
wood has to be drawn from greater and greater distances, in-
volving a rapid increase of price. Further, when the cost of
labour is taken into consideration, suction gas-plant in small
units could not, in general, successfully compete with that de-
rived from a comprehensive system of supply, such as suggested
in this paper.
Of natural gas, in the Pittsburg sense of the term, there is
none. Kerosene shale of very high quality exists, and if the
Federal Customs Tariff were so proportioned as to allow of
the successful commercial development of this mineral, and if
railway freights for the resulting fuel were reduced, it is


possible that a fair quantity of comparatively cheap crude oil
would be marketed at a price low enough to allow for power
from engines of the Diesel type to compete with steam. But
the known deposits of kerosene shale are extremely limited
when compared with the vastness of the coal fields of the
State, and at present the industry is unfortunately practically
at a standstill. Crude petroleum, as a native product, is un-
known in this State, and therefore, omitting consideration of
those natural resources which are common to most parts of
the globe, the heat of the sun and the motion of the tides and
wind, and the proposed use of sewer gas, as to which the author
has no reliable data, there remain but the two chief sources of
power mentioned to consider.
A. —COAL.
Available Coal in New South Wales.—Mr. E. P. Pitt-
man. in his “Coal Resources of N.5.W.,” gives estimates
showing Ihe total coal in the State, within a. depth of 4,000
feet, to be probably.in excess of 117,000 million tons. The
annual coal production of the State was 10VL> million tons in
1013: figures for lf)12 from Imperial Returns are as follows:
Country. .Millions of Tons. (Metric).
Cnited States 484.9
Great Britain 264.6
Germany 255.8
Austria-Hungary 51.7
France 41.1
Russia 31.3
Belgium 23.0
Total for the World (nearly) . . . . 1.250
Thus, if the production of the State were increased 100
times, so as to equal the world’s production, there would be still
about 100 years’ supply within 4.000 feet of the surface.
It must be recognised that at present the mining com-
panies are of necessity utilising the best and most easily
won of this store. Competition demands that the best coal
available be offered at the lowest price. There are many
difficulties involved in the use of inferior qualities, and indeed
in the mining of some of the better classes, where Nature
has been so prodigal of her resources as to provide a 30ft.

seam. The majority of the problems presented will pro-
bably be left for posterity to solve. With increasing wages
and increasing distance from the surface, the cost of winning
will surely rise; hut at the same time we may look forward
to more economical methods of use. so that a corresponding
rise in the price of power does not necessarily follow. The
methods of utilisation will he touched upon in Part 111 of
this paper.
Locality of Coal Measures.—Figure 4 shows the State of
New South AVales with the positions of the coal measures indi-
cated thereon, reproduced from a map) included by Air. Pitt-
man in his work on the ‘‘Coal Resources of N.S.W.” quoted
above. The dark line shows the out-crop of the Greta coal mea-
sures, largely worked in the Maitland district; the area marked
by cross-hatching sloping from left downwards to right
indicates the Permo-Carboniferous coal measures which
form the hulk of the coal, supply of New South Walee
coalfields; and the cross-hatching sloping in the opposite direc-
tion si ows the localities where the upper or Triassic coal mea-
sures are found.
It must not be supposed that over the whole of the areas
shown there is workable coal. In many places it is too deep
for working to be contemplated at the present time. In other
places the coal is of poor quality, or spoilt by faults, volcanic
dykes or other accidents of the past. The Triassic coals are
not at present worked for commercial use, the quality being
inferior.
Calorific Value and Price.—The average calorific value
and the current price of coal in large quantities from the various
coalfields is as follows:
The coal from one of the Newcastle mines is as high as
14.000 h.Th.i;.
The coal from the Greta coal measures, of an average
B.Th.r.. of 10.000 to IH.MOO. is not included in the above table,


FIG. 4

The poorer (‘lasses of coal referred to will assume greater
importance as the price of the better class, for the reasons
referred to above, increases. Moreover, it is quite within the
range of possibility, even of probability, that these coals will
be worked, and their latent energy extracted by burning at the
pit mouth, the usable proportion of energy being thence trans-
mitted electrically to the localities where power is required, and
sold at a price which could not be touched if the added cost
of railway haulage were one of the factors deciding the selling
price. This matter is further referred to in Part 111.
B.—WATER POWER.
The popular idea of the value of water power as costing
nothing is probably absent from the minds of members of this
Association.
It need scarcely be pointed out that there are few water
power developments in which the cost of the hydraulic work
is not so heavy that it becomes a question whether the interest
on capital cost will not more than counterbalance the ad-
vantages of machinery needing less attendance and upkeep
generally, ami requiring no fuel. The question as to whether
water power is worth developing is almost entirely a finan-
cial matter, the considerations governing the decision being
the relative cost of power derived from water and from any
other competing source at the point where used. Assuming
coal to be the competitor, tin* cost depends largely upon the
quality, the distance from the coalfield, and the cost of
freight or of power transmission therefrom.
The words “almost entirely” have been used above ad-
visedly for the following reason. If in any locality the price
as above determined were so nearly balanced that a slight
preponderance one way or the other in the calculated cost
is within the limit of probable error of the calculation, the
decision should be in favour of water power. For the choice
lies between, on the one hand, making use of kinetic energy,
derived from water raised by the sun and drawn down by
gravitation, which would otherwise be absolutely wasted in
heat, noise, and roek erosion, and on the other, of using up part
of the national store of bottled energy in the form of coal, which
once used can never be replaced ; on this account those with


whom the decision lies are morally responsible to conserve,
as far as lies in their power, a great national asset, and to
make available for use to as great an extent as possible,
another national asset, which, like time, if not used is lost
for ever.
Cotter River.—A concrete example, now outside the limits
of the State, will serve as an illustration. One of the most favour-
able schemes examined by the author since his conned ion with
the Public Works Department was that first suggested, he be-
lieves, by Air. E. AT. de Burgh, M.lnst.C.E. (now Chief
Engineer for Water Supply and Sewerage in the Public
Works Department), of a combined water supply and hydro-
electric power scheme from the Cotter River for the Federal
Capital.
One of the proposals previously reported on in connec-
tion with the water supply involved a high level dam from
the Cotter River, with a pipe-line delivering water by gravi-
tation to the capital, and a suggestion had been made that this
pipe-line might be broken at two or three intervals where
power stations would be situated. At this stage, as the
result of All-, de Burgh’s recommendation, the author was in-
structed to examine and report on the possibilities, and after a
careful investigation he advocated a dam somewhat higher up
the Cotter River than the one previously proposed for the gravi-
tation scheme, a race or fiuming thence with inverted syphon
over an intervening gap for a distance of 20 miles to the sum-
mit of Alt. Macdonald, whence a fall of 880 feet is available
to the Murrumbidgee River. See Figure 5.
At the time of this investigation, only twelve months’
river gaugings were available, so that the water supply was
at least doubtful; but from the gaugings recently published
by the Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission, it is
evident that in the worst year that has occurred since (1912)
the amount of conservation proposed by the author would
have been sufficient to provide all the power and domestic
water necessary for a population of at least 80,000. The needs
of a population in excess of 50,000, however, have not up to
the present been considered, and in what follows this figure
has been taken, the number of units per annum, and the
maximum demand being based upon the latest returns for

the City of Launceston, Tasmania, where the author was City
Electrical Engineer for a number of years. The figures for
Launceston are far in excess of the corresponding figures for
any other city or town in the Commonwealth, or indeed, of
any town of similar size in the United Kingdom, and are pro-
bably also considerably greater than what will be used per
head of population at the Federal Capital, but allowance is
made for the free use of electricity for heating, cooking, and
other domestic purposes in the smokeless city, which a pre-
vious Minister for Home Affairs pictured as the future capital
of Australia.
The author’s proposals consist of a 150 ft. dam at R.L.,
2400 on the Cotter River, with draw-off at R.L. 2460, whence
a race and pipe-fine with a total fall of 65 feet, 20 miles long,
terminating at a balance reservoir on the summit of Mt. Mac-
donald with top water level 2390, whence a pipe-line in dupli-
cate would lead down the hillside to the Murrumbidgee, the
reduced level of which, at this point, is 1504, giving a total
working head, after allowing for pipe friction and keeping
the station well above flood level, of 830 feet. The water supply
for the Capital would also be provided from the same reservoir.
A preliminary report embodying these proposals was com-
municated to the Federal Authorities, which, however, received
criticism at the hands of one of their technical advisers, who,
in spite of some pains taken to explain the point, did not
appear to understand the function of the balance reservoir,
and seemed to think that it was essential to a hydro-electric
scheme for the maximum demand to be maintained contin-
uously. At this stage the work was taken over from the Pub-
lic Works Department by the Federal Home Affairs Depart-
ment.
Since then the author understands that a steam power
plant has been erected in the Federal Capital area, primarily
to be used as a tool of construction, and that it is proposed
to transmit power thence to a reservoir, to be formed by
damming the Cotter River near its junction with the Mur-
rumbidgee, and to use electrically-driven pumps for furnish-
ing the water supply, thence to a service reservoir in the
vicinity of Canberra. It is to be hoped that this is only a
temporary measure, possibly intended to serve later as a


steam standby when the hydro-electric scheme is complete.
If it were otherwise, comparative estimates of a steam supply
at Canberra with electric pumping, and the gravitation
scheme advocated by the author for the hydro-electric supply,
show that the cost of water and electrical energy for the former
would be 4.6 d. per 1.000 gallons, and 0.98 d. per unit respec-
tively ; and for the latter, 3.4 d. per 1,000 gallons, and 0.57 d. per
unit, it being understood that the exact division of the charges
between water supply and power is necessarily, to a large extent,
empirical.
If the initial expense be an objection to the hydro-electric
scheme, it may be urged in reply that the work can be car-
ried out in three divisions as the population increasets. By
suitably damming two small feeders from the Brindabella
Mountain, some 7% miles from Mt. Macdonald, that end of the
race could be first constructed, and the water and electric
supply would be sufficient for an initial population of from
ten to fifteen thousand. As the population grew, the race
would be extended back to a small dam above the main dam
site, which would be so designed as to help in the construction
of the main dam when that might become necessary, and later,
as the need for the larger reservoir became apparent the
main dam could be constructed and brought into operation.
To emphasise the opinion expressed at the commencement
of this sub-section that the national supplies should be con-
served as far as possible, twenty years’ working of the com-
plete steam scheme for 50,000 people would result hi the
waste of 310,000 tons of coal, with the doubtful benefit of a
smaller capital expenditure, accompanied by higher prices to be
paid both for wafer and electric energy.
Investigation of State Water Power. —One may argue from
the example of the Cotter, that there are within the State
water powers which it will pay to develop; and it is evidently
a matter of national importance that the resources of the State
in this respect should be ascertained.
By the direction of the Honourable Arthur Griffith, then
Minister for Public Works, examination was made by the author
as far back as 1911 of the Tumburumba. Buddong. and Gilmore
Creeks, and in 1912 of the Shoalhaven River, the investigation
being more complete in this instance.


The examination of other streams lias followed, and last
year the Premier, the Hon. W. A. Holman, directed that a
systematic preliminary investigation should be made of the
whole of the water-power resources of the State. The author
has been entrusted with this investigation, and is carrying it
out on the following lines.
Accepting 250 miles as the present commercial limit of
power transmission, it is intended that all likely water powers
within this distance from the principal localities where power
is used shall be examined in the, order of their importance for
the purpose in view'.
The preliminary examination will be principally with map
and aneroid, followed by a clinometer, and, if necessary, a com-
pass survey of those portions of the river-bed showing promise
of satisfactory power development. In respect of each of the
favourable positions thus indicated, the catchment areas above
such positions and probable run-off, the estimated how. and the
available power. will be catalogued, and suitable sites for gaug-
ing having been determined, gauging stations will, where pos-
sible, be established, and arrangements made for the regular
reading of the gauge-boards.
When such preliminary examinations have indicated the
most favourable wmter pow f er for development in respect of any
power-using centre, definite estimates will be prepared, so that
by comparison with similar estimates for pow'er derived from
coal, it will be knowm wdiether the development of any one
water power is commercially feasible. Further, if not so feas-
ible, it will be clear to what price coal must rise in order to
.justify the development of the water power in question, and. if
feasible, the cost for any manhfacturing industry dependent
upon cheap power will be knowm with considerable accuracy
In general, two classes of water pow'er have to be examined,
viz., those w T here there is a small volume of w'ater with a large
fall, and those wdiere the fall is small and the volume large.
Xo examples exist in the State of a large volume and rapid fall
combined.

if conservation dams were constructed for irriga-
tion or other purposes, it would possibly pay to

Since instructions were received, a commencement has been
made, and an interim report on the Tumut River has been pre-
sented. and reports on other rivers are in course of prepara-
tion ; progress, however, being necessarily slow because of the
fewness of officers on account of the war.
A complete reference'to the water-power resources of the
State must necessarily wait until this investigation is finished.
The following figures have been taken from reports which
have been furnished in the past for the water continuously avail-
able. the working head, and the consequent available continu-
ous power, and total energy per annum respectively:—
AVith aBO per cent, load factor. 100.000 k.w. is seen to be
available from these few streams.


The possibility of shortage of water during drought years
is one objection often raised against water-power schemes. This
objection disappears if the hydro-electric stations are tied in
with a general power scheme, including coal stations. Even
were it not so, industries dependent upon cheap power would
certainly be no worse off in times of drought than the farmer
or sheep-owner who risks enormous sums year after year on the
chance of good rainfall, and who. if he allowed similar objec-
tions to rule, would excuse himself from ploughing and sow-
ing. or from other preparatory work, on account of the possi-
bility of drought interfering with his profits. In America, some
of the water-power companies make both full year contracts,
and at a lower tariff. 10 months’ contracts, reserving the right
to cut off. in case of a shortage of w v ater. to the extent of two
months during the year.
If the power of the few streams mentioned above were
developed and tied in with a general power scheme for the
State, the 33,000 k.w. available continuously would, making
full allowance for losses, provide 252 million units each year,
thus saving the coal resources to the extent of about a
quarter of a million tons per annum.
The figures for the Snowy River are to be taken as ten-
tative only, the present investigation not being completed. If
developed to its full extent, the available power will probably
be more than three times that shown, making the k.w. available
and the units pm- annum double those given in the last sentence.
Again, if the Shoalhaven River alone were developed
and connected with the Sydney Tramways and Municipal
Supply Systems, being worked continuously so as to utilise
all the available water in normal seasons, the investigation
already carried out shows that it would be possible for the
two systems to be supplied with power for considerably
less than a farthing a unit, and for all three power sta-
tions, Ultimo, White Bay and Pyrmont, to be closed down
during the night shift so that only morning and afternoon
shifts would have to be worked.
PART III.-ADAPTATION OF THE POWER RESOURCES
OF THE STATE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS.
Consideration of the requirements set forth in Part I. of
this paper, added to the constantly increasing inquiries for


power for pumping, for water supply, for sewage disposal, and
for lighting and manufacturing purposes from various parts of
the State, emphatically suggest the question as to whether the
catering for these requirements should, as in the past, be spas-
modic by means of small eleetric plants dotted about the coun-
try. in which case the cost of the energy supplied is unduly
high, oi- whether a well-considered, comprehensive scheme
should be initiated, so designed as to be capable of expansion,
with a view to ultimately providing, as far as possible, for all
the requirements anticipated.
That the 2’esourees of the State are ample for such a com-
prehensive scheme has been sufficiently shown in Part 11. The
author now wishes to definitely submit for discussion the con-
sideration of the propriety of establishing a system or systems
of power stations in suitable positions, interconnected where
practicable by means of transmission mains, serving, firstly,
those districts, including the larger cities and the South Coast,
which are more particularly devoted to manufacturing indus-
tries; secondly, the larger towns; and thirdly, the intervening
agricultural and pastoral areas. Such a scheme is partially
suggested in the map of New South Wales (Figure 4), already
referred to. where a power station is shown on each of the
northern, southern, and western coal areas, with water power
stations in some of the positions referred to in Part 11.
Assuming for such a system electrical transmission as a pos-
tulate—how to use to best advantage the available power re-
sources; whether the coal should be borne to the locality where
power is required or burnt at the mine; whether it should be
burnt under boilers or distilled and the gas used under boil-
ers or burnt direct in gas-engines; if used for steam raising,
the best class of prime-mover to adopt; if distilled, whether the
coke should be saved or consumed in the production of gas;
how best to develop a wafer power, the most economical stor-
age, the correct location and dimensions of race or pipe line,
the manner of linking in with a general power system; and
finally, the influence of the electrical system and of the cost
of transmission on the solution of the problems involved—all
these are questions each of which might be made the subject
of a paper by itself, and consequently it is only possible in this
review to touch lightly on the bearing of the more important
of these on the matters under consideration.

A. —DEVELOPMENT OF THE COAL RESOURCES OF THE STATE FOR
POWER PRODUCTION.
The ultimate price to be paid for energy derived from
coal in the wholesale quantities that will surely be used in the
future, will as surely depend upon the efficiency and the cost
of the means used for extracting the energy from the coal. In-
timately connected with this question of efficiency is the amount
of energy derivable from a given quantity of coal, and the paral-
lel question as to whether it will cost more to forward the
■energy by rail in its bottled-up form or to transmit it elec-
trically.
(i.)—Overall Steam Power Station Efficiencies.
The efficiency of steam-boilers at present in general use does
not ordinarily exceed 80 per cent. Using boilers of this efficiency,
and the best steam turbines of large size of ordinary construc-
tion. in a large power station with coal of 14,500 B.Th.U. per
lb., the actual consumption under favourable conditions is as
low as 1 -81bs. per unit sent out. With coal obtainable in New
South Wales of calorific value of 11,500 B.Th.U., the best con-
sumption obtainable, under present conditions is probably not
less than 2 -241bs. per unit sent out, whence is derived the figure
of 3.000 units per ton of coal used in Part I. of this paper.
Taking 1 k.w. hour as equivalent to 3,413 B.Th.U., it is seen
that the overall efficiency of the power station under these con-
ditions is 3413/25760, or 33% per cent.
The increased efficiency already attained with the Ljungs-
trbm Turbine, and the possible added efficiency from Mr. W.
U. R. Emmet’s Mercury Turbine, may result in a considerable
bettering of these figures in the future; and if gas-fired boilers
on the surface combustion principle are used, a still further
increase of efficiency is likely.
For the several cases referred to, the overall power station
efficiencies and the available units per ton of coal of average
calorific value of 3 3.500 B.Th.U. per lb., are as follows: —


The last ease is not entirely analogous with the others, since
it assumes that the fuel is delivered to the power station in the
form of gas instead of coal.
(ii.)—Gas Engines.
Tests of large gas-engines have shown 1 k.w. hour to be
produced with an expenditure of 10.900 B.Th.U. in the gas
used, which averaged about 500 B.Th.U. per cubic foot. Allow-
ing for these results to represent test conditions, and adding
10 per cent, for losses in normal everyday working, the B.Th.U.
per k.w. hour sent out would amount to 12,000. giving an effi-
ciency of 8418/12.000. or 28 4 per cent. Thus, in present day
practice, the large gas-engine is more than twice as efficient as
the steam-engine, and without improvement it would still be
40 per cent, better even if the improved economy promised by
the surface combustion boiler and mercury turbine became an
accomplished fact.
The present difficulty as regards the gas-engine is its enor-
mous size for a given output. Whereas steam turbines of
85.000 k.w. capacity in a single unit are at work, and up to
100.000 k.w. contemplated, 5,000 k.w. is about the largest gas-
engine plant that is manufactured, and this involves duplicate
tandem double-acting horizontal sets requiring excessive door
space. This type has its home in Belgium and Germany. Bri-
tish makers are now manufacturing high-speed gas-engines,
which are more promising; but at present these are unobtain-
able beyond 1.500 8.U.8.. though there is considerable likeli-
hood of this size being exceeded as the demand arises for them.
The repairs on the large slow-speed horizontal sets are ex-
cessive. but nevertheless at a mine visited by the author in
South AVales. where coke-oven gas was used for driving these
engines, the Chief Engineer informed him that after making
all allowances for excessive depreciation and high cost of re-
pairs. the superior efficiency of the gas-engine was such that
the price per unit developed was considerably cheaper than if
the gas had been used under boilers for supplying steam to the
most efficient steam turbines obtainable.
On the other hand, in the Newcastle district, where coke-
oven gas is largely used for power, the practice, so far as the
Newcastle Electric Supply Co. is concerned, is to burn the gas.


and, where available, to utilise waste heat under boilers, the
steam turbine in this instance being preferred to the gas-engine
in spite of its lower efficiency.
If a successful gas turbine is at any time placed on the
market, the chief hope for it lies less in the increase of range
of temperature (which is an essential feature of the superiority
of the steam turbine over the reciprocating steam-engine), but
rather in the possibility of the eventual provision of large high-
speed units comparable with the present development of the
steam turbine, and combining the advantages of absence of
cylinder lubrication with the need for less attendance and smal-
ler expenditure on overhauling than the gas-engines at present
on the market.
This question is intimately connected with that of the
utilisation of coke-oven gas, to which attention may next be
directed.
(iii.) — Coke Oven Gas.
Knowing something of the developments on the North East
Coast of England, prior to his visit home the author had taken
note of the total amount of coke manufactured in the State,
and he spent some time prosecuting inquiries as to the possi-
bilities of commercially developing this side of the industry
in New South Wales.
304,800 tons of coke were manufactured last year
in New South Wales, of which 252,409 were made on the south-
ern coalfields. At the new iron and steel works belonging to
the Broken Hill Proprietary, Ltd., at Port Waratah, 66 by-
product ovens have been erected, and other examples of by-
product recovery exist in the northern district; but so far as
the south is concerned,with one exception, viz., the Corrimal mine,
the whole of the coke-oven gas is wasted, and in no case is any
attempt made to recover the valuable by-products. If coke-
ovens were erected on a suitable site, with plant for the recov-
ery of ammonia and tar, and possibly benzine, toluol, cyanide,
and other by-products, the whole of the South Coast coke could
be produced therefrom, and in addition, there would be avail-
able from the gas no less than 140 million units, which, if the
industry be regarded as a whole, and the by-products be sold
at market rates, could be supplied for less than a farthing per
unit delivered. It need scarcely be pointed out that ammonia


is being increasingly required for refrigeration, that sulphate
of ammonia is a valuable fertiliser, and though more would be
produced than is required at present in this country, its ex-
port would add to the material wealth of the State; that the
large quantity of tar resulting would enable a supply to be
furnished at low rates for improving the roads of the State;
and that there is likely to be a large demand for toluol for the
manufacture of tri-nitro-toluol (T.N.T.), if, as seems probable,
Australia relies upon herself for her future supplies of ex-
plosives.
The figures given above are the result of careful consid-
eration of the facts, and are based on actual quotations for
coke-ovens and subsidiary plant, with liberal estimates for
generating machinery, transmission line, transformers, and
switchgear, the detail of which, however, is too considerable to
allow of inclusion in this paper. Suffice it to say that the
aulhor visited three works in Great Britain and three in Ger-
many where coke-oven gas was being successfully used for
driving large gas-engine units for the generation of electricity,
and one in England and one in Germany where the gas was
burnt under boilers for supplying steam turbines, in addition
to a further plant in America where blast furnace gas was
used for large gas-engines. The total horse-power of the three
gas-engine stations in England was 8,300. and of the three in
Germany. 47.300. The gas-engines in the three German sta-
tions and in one in the British were of the slow-speed hori-
zontal type, the horse-power of individual units being up to
5.000. In the other two British stations, high-speed vertical
gas-engines were employed, the largest seen being of 1.000
B.n.p.
Confidential figures were supplied to the author by seve-
ral British coke-oven owners, showing conclusively the great
profits which are being made from this industry. This is evi-
denced by the increasing number of coke ovens with recovery
plants which are being employed in all parts of the world.
The four chief firms supplying these plants within recent years
constructed, up to and including the year 1913, no less than
6,540 ovens in Great Britain and Ireland, of which 2,662 were
constructed since the year 1908. One firm alone had con-
structed. from 1902-1912 inclusive, 5,088 ovens in Germany,
1.507 in the United States, and 1.370 in England.


B.—UTILISATION OF THE WATER POWER RESOURCES OF THE
STATE.
When one considers the best method of making use of
those water powers which lend themselves to easy development,
and of tying them in with a general system of supply for any
large district of the State, seeing that rainfall is not constant, it
is clear that if the hydroelectric stations are to be self-contained
conservation is necessary, and it becomes a question whether
the high initial capital expense of such conservation is justi-
fied, or whether the necessary reserve to tide over periods of
shortage should be provided in the shape of additional genera-
tors in the coal power stations. Each case arising will require
separate investigation, and it will be found in most cases that
a compromise between these two extremes is the more economi-
cal course to adopt, the amount of conservation being sufficient
to maintain the river flow at its usual average for the six sum-
mer months of the year, leaving exceptional years to be pro-
vided for by steam plant; or contracts may be arranged, as is
frequent in America, so that consumers will take the risk of
shortage, say once in ten years, and have the power at the
lowest possible rate.
If, however, power stations are provided in connection with
water conservation for irrigation purposes, such as the Burrin-
juck scheme, it must be remembered that in ordinary years the
reservoir will only be drawn upon for irrigation purposes for
perhaps five or six months out of the twelve; but in those
years when there is a shortage of water, the greatest demand
will be made upon the conserved waters, so that the irrigation
reservoir power stations would in such case be, during the
time of drought, working up to their maximum capacity, thus
relieving the other power stations, and reducing the amount of
reserve required in coal power stations.
Again, seeing that the hydraulic works which form so great
a proportion of hydro-electric developments in the general case
have already been constructed, the capital cost of the electric
development of the available power in such a case is unusually
low. This in itself warrants generating plant being laid down
on the distinct understanding that it shall only be used inter-
mittently, and as it would be known several days beforehand
when such an irrigation water power station would stop work
for the season, arrangements could be concluded in advance for

transference of electrical staff from the water power to the
auxiliary coal power station, so that the necessity for a com-
plete duplicate staff would be avoided.
Points in the Development of a Water Power.
The question as to what proportion of the maximum fall
available shall be utilised, and the amount of storage which
shall be provided, requires special investigation in each case.
It is usually false policy to take advantage of only part of the
head on account of lower capital cost, with the possibility of
having to erect a power station at a lower level at a later date.
As regards tin' height of off-take from dam. when an open canal
is used, it is in general economical to sacrifice part of the
storage in order to gain additional head, the economical height,
ceteris paribus, being usually somewhere above the position
where the ratio of increase of head to total head with off-let
at bottom of dam is equal to the ratio of loss of storage capa-
city to total storage at off-let chosen. This is a point to which
the author has not seen attention called previously, and ex-
amples have come under Ids notice where, owing to its not be-
ing attended to. increased cost has been incurred. The smaller
water flow, and consequent smaller canal and pipes, favour the
highest location, and the canals are generally more cheaply con-
structed at the higher levels.
Before leaving this subject, it may be pointed out that, if
expensive damming is avoided in favour of tying in with coal
power stations, the necessary construction of transmission line
systems is an additional argument in favour of the latter be-
ing placed at convenient positions adjacent to the mine. This
leads to the next subject to be considered.
C.—ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION V. RAILWAY HAULAGE.
(i.)—INFLUENCE OF TRANSMISSION LINE DESIGN.
In New South Wales wooden poles of good lasting quality
are obtainable at reasonable prices, and where they are so and
otherwise are necessarily spaced close together, and where white
ants are not specially to be provided against, their use is ad-
visable. The author has adopted the design shown in Figure
6 for a number of lines. The cost of such a line, to-day. using


4-chain spacing and 7/14 wire, may be roughly put at £250 per
mile, though in at least one ease the cost has been little more
than half this figure.
To meet the requirements of a country where white ants
abound, and where in some districts suitable timber is be-
coming prohibitive in price, the advantage of a steel line with
supports at less frequent intervals and requiring fewer in-
sulators is very considerable, and in providing for future re-
quirements the economy frequently resulting from the use of
flexible poles should be borne in mind.
Flexible Poles.—The use of flexible poles was first emphati-
cally advocated by Mr. Guido Semenza. now of Milan, in a
paper communicated to the Am. Inst. E.E.. in 1904 (q.v. Proc.
Am. Inst. E.E.. Yol. XXIII.. p. 147), wherein it was shown
that the cost of a transmission line can be very materially re-
duced by designing the poles according to the direction of the
stresses. The wind stresses being at right angles to the direc-
tion of the line, the poles should be stiffer in that direction
than longitudinally. Mr. Semenza ? s suggestions have been car-
ried into practice in the design of many subsequent transmis-
sion lines, amongst which is now that connecting Leeton
with Yanco, where there are towers every half mile, the inter-
vening supports being flexible poles of approximately half
the weight of the towers, spaced about 450 ft. apart. There
is in such a line a saving over one with towers for all sup-
ports of approximately 5/12ths of the cost of supports and
foundations. Figure 7 shows both types of support in use
at Leeton. The cost of this line, with 7/14 wire and insula-
tors for 6,600 volts, was about £2,000 for four miles. Figure
8 shows a flexible pole in Sweden, the standard span for which
was 492 feet, every seventh support being a tower.
(ii.) —Large v. Small Power Stations.
It is to be observed that the higher the class of coal and
the more efficient the means of extracting the energy, the more
effective is the argument in favour of railway haulage of coal
as against electrical transmission. But, on the other hand, the
energy can only be efficiently extracted in large power stations,
and consequently, when a large power station has been con-

structed within reasonable distance of a town, it is in general
cheaper to make use of power from this station than to con-
struct a . separate small station.
Although in Part 11. of this paper suction gas has been
dismissed, as not to be seriously taken into consideration for
large stations, yet it has a legitimate application for small
power stations, in that for districts where coal is say 20/- per
ton, and where, owing to the small spze and the consequent want
of economy of the power station so few as say 250 units only
per. ton are obtainable (the cost per unit for fuel alone being
nearly Id.), with suction gas, using wood at say 12 - per cord,
this cost will be reduced to l/6th of a penny. Thus, in isolated
districts far from a coalfield where wood is abundant and
cheap, there will be a field for suction gas for some time to come.
But whether the comparison be made with suction gas or
steam, if there be a power station within reasonable distance,
the proportionately large cost of stores, and more particularly
of labour, compared with the output from such small power
stations, will render the cost excessive compared with the price
arrived at by adding to the cost of generating at the large
station the cost of transmission of the power. The excessive
cost of labour and stores at the small power station will inevit-
ably bring the generating cost up to 2y 2 d. or 3d. per unit under
the most favourable circumstances.
(iii.) — Influence of Electrical System of Transmission,
high-tension Continuous Current.
Reference is due here to the Thury system of high-tension
continuous current transmission, which has been described by
Mr. J. S. Highfield in three papers read before the Institution
of Electrical Engineers (Proc. 1.E.E., Vol. 38, page 471; Vol.
49, page 848; Vol. 51, page 640), in one of which he has de-
finitely asserted that in certain cases he has found the cost of
underground mains for the Thury system not to exceed the
cost of a three-phase overhead system of similar capacity.
During his recent tour the author made a special point of
inspecting the system in operation, first in London at the Met-
ropolitan Electric Supply Co.’s Willesden Works, and later Mr.
Thury himself was good enough to meet him at St. Maurice and


show him over the power station there supplying power to Lau-
sanne, and later took him to the St. Bridoire station, which is
connected in series on the Lyon-Moutiers line. The beautiful
simplicity of the system, the ease of regulation, together with
the absence of those complications which characterise the three-
phase system, cannot fail to excite admiration.
As regards overhead construction, Figure 9 is an illustra-
tion of the St. Maurice-Lausanne line, and parts of the Lyons-
Moutiers line, transmitting 8,400 k.w. at 100,000 volts, are of
similar construction; but in the city of Lyons a single core
aluminium cable of 0 -23 square inch, with paper insula-
tor, lead-covered and armoured, is used underground, the only
instance in the world of so high a pressure being used on an
underground cable. Mr. Thury kindly gave the author the
original map from which Figure 10 has been prepared, which
shows the position of the high-tension continuous current trans-
mission mains supplying Lyons, together with the alternating
current lines and network that are used in conjunction there-
with.
This method of transmission is not, of course, to be used
indiscriminately; but there are instances in this State where
its use would tend to considerable economy. It is indicated in
cases where a definite and regular amount of power is to be
transmitted from an auxiliary station, so that the line may be
worked to its full capacity, or nearly so. and the conductors
and insulators thus provided be made use of to their full ex-
tent; and on account of the low cost of underground mains and
the high pressures allowable, for bringing large quantities of
energy into cities where overhead mains are objectionable, and
where otherwise one would be limited to moderate pressures.
(iv.)—Actual Cases. Use of Inferior Coals. Advantage
of Interconnection.
The author has had occasion to investigate several cases in
which it has been proved beyond doubt that electrical trans-
mission is cheaper than haulage by rail. Not only is this so
in transmitting very large quantities of energy in bulk, say for
the supply of the metropolis from the southern coalfields, but
also for more moderate powers there are towns situated a few
miles back from the sea coast to which the direct line is .very


much shorter than the route taken by the railway; and in such
case the advantage of electric transmission is still more strongly
evident.
If the inferior coals of the State of lower calorific value
than those assumed in these investigations be utilised, which in
a number of instances the author is assured by Mr. A. A. Atkin-
son is perfectly feasible, the difference in cost and the superior
advantage of electrical transmission as against railway haulage
is still further accentuated.
Apart from the question of carriage of coal, an additional
reason for electrical transmission is that it makes possible the
utilisation of the water power of the State to the fullest avail-
able extent, and permits of interconnection of power stations
so as to work each for the minimum hours per diem necessary,
and thus in the most economical manner enabling the price
per unit to the public to be the minimum possible.
D. —EXAMPLES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES
During his tour the author visited a large number of power
stations, including many of the chief ones in Great Britain, and
many on the Continent and in America. Reference is made
below, however, only to those inspected which have a distinct
bearing on the subject of power supply in bulk. These are as
follows:
(i.) —Company-Owned Schemes.
Great Britain.—The Newcastle system includes the two
large power stations of Carville and Dunstan, and four smaller
coal-fired power stations, the six totalling 87,000 k.w., together
with 11 waste heat, coke-oven gas, blast-furnace gas, and ex-
haust steam stations, totalling 34,000 k.w., making a grand
total of 121,000 k.w., distributed over an area of 1,400 square
miles, amongst the power users being all the principal Tyne-
side engineering and ship building works, with about 200,000
h.p. connected; whilst for municipal purposes and lighting, bulk
supplies are furnished to Middlesbrough (which resulted in a
municipal undertaking, with an annual loss being changed into
one with an increasing annual surplus), Tynemouth, and seve-
ral urban areas in Northumberland and Durham. As regards
traction, power is supplied for the electrical operation of three
suburban lines and part of the main line of the North-Eastern


Railway, and a number of tramways on the Tyneside and at
Sunderland; and finally, electro-chemical and thermic indus-
tries are in operation for steel refining, the manufacture of
soda, alundum, and other electro-metallurgical and electro-ther-
mic products.
The utilisation of waste heat has resulted in remarkably
low prices being available, the lowest of which the author heard
being 0.123 d. per unit for a supply for electro-metallurgical pur-
poses, used practically constantly all the year round. This is
equivalent to about £3/6/- per E.H.P. per annum, and is al-
most as low as any figure charged elsewhere, except for water
power under the most favourable circumstances, and is a strik-
ing example of what may be done with coal.
The Clyde Valley power scheme similarly serves the. chief
ship-building and engineering works on the Clyde; 27.000 k.w.
are in use at two large power stations, supplying over an area
of 750 square miles. For a full description of this plant, which
has some unique and most interesting features, Mr. D. A. Starr’s
paper should be consulted (v. Proc. 1.E.E., 1912, Vol. 49. page
781, et seq.).
The South Wales Power Comp.any supplies from a single
power station of 10,500 k.w., situated a little to the north of
Cardiff, a total connection of 21,600 h.p., the surrounding mines
and mining villages being the principal consumers. This com-
pany not only supplies in bulk, but also owns distributing sys-
tems in several small towns and villages; and it is noteworthy
that overhead aluminium mains are used exclusively for the
purpose, over 200 miles being in regular operation. The price
charged is £5/10/- per E.11.P. of maximum demand per annum
+ o*lsd. per unit.
The North Wales power scheme utilises water power from
Snowden; the principal customers are various quarries in North
Wales, including the noted Penrhyn and Llanberis slate quar-
ries, together with bulk supplies to several towns. The mains
extend a distance of 65 y 2 miles; the total power is 6.000 k.w.,
the pressure 10,000 and 20.000 volts, and the area supplied 300
square miles.
The Cornwall Power Co.’s only power station is at Hayle.
The load is scattered, power being transmitted east beyond Red-
ruth, south to Penzance, and west as far as Botallack, the ex-


FIG. 10
LYON-MOUTIERS TRANSMISSION


treme distance being about 22 miles; 8,800 k.w. are in use, and
the transmission pressure is 10,000 volts. The prices charged
are from £4 to £7 per k.w. of maximum demand, plus y 2 d. per
unit.
Sweden. —The South Swedish Power Co. has four power
stations, totalling 20,000 k.w., and supplies a large district
from Engleholm to Trolleborg. Fifty-one million units were
sold in 1913, the average price being 0.3 d. per unit.
German3 r . —At the two mines visited near Aix-la-Chapelle,
belonging to the Eschweiler Bergwerks Verein, were some of the
large gas engines supplied with coke-oven gas referred to
above in Part 11. In October, 1913, the gas-engines, totalling
14,200’h.p.* produced 3,746 million k.w. hours, at a cost pf
0-26 d. per unit, largely used for mining purposes, but partly
sold as bulk supply for all use.
The Rheinisch-Wesphalisches Station at Essen was one of
four totalling 127,500 k.w., belonging to the company which
supplies the whole of the provinces of Rhineland and West-
phalia, about 2,200 square miles, with a total connection of
225.000 k.w., the tariff being 3.6 d. per unit for light, and 1.7 d.
for power, with rebates up to 25 per cent, for large consumers.
Both the Bonifacius and Prinz Regent Mines visited, in the
neighbourhood of Essen, had gas-engine stations, the former of
6.000 k.w. and the latter 16,000 k.w. They supply power for
their own uses, including winding machinery, and sell for local
tramways at 0 6d. per unit, surplus energy being sold to the
Rheinisch-Wesphalisches Electrizitats Gesellschaft at 0 3d. per
unit, or in case of need they buy from this company at an en-
hanced price.
These gas-engine stations are all in connection with coke
ovens, having complete recovery plants, benzol, and toluol be-
ing amongst the valuable by-products.
The Lauchhammer transmission is noteworthy in that the
fuel used is peat, and the power is transmitted at 110,000 volts
(the highest pressure in use in Europe) to Groditz (20 miles)
and to Riesa (31 miles), where two of the company’s works
are respectively situated.
Power stations visited at Wyhlen and Rheinfelden, and
another in construction at Lauffenburg on the Rhine, just across
the boundary from Switzerland, are controlled by German


banks, who construct new works and get them on to a paying
footing before fonning subsidiary companies to take them over
and work them, a method of financing new schemes which has
its advantages, but which is unknown in Australia.
Switzerland.—The Loentsch Station, with 1,180 feet head
of water, supplies 25,000 k.w., is tied in with another station of
14.000 k.w. at Beznau, and transmits at 45,000 volts a maximum
distance of 85 miles to the Canton of Aargau and a number of
large manufacturing cities.
Robbia and Campo Cologne are in Italian Switzerland, the
Robbia Power Station being notable on account of the high head,
no less than 1.968 feet being used for.driving the turbines. This,
with the stations at Campo Cologno and at Malero, in Northern
Italy, are fine examples of water power work.
Italy.—Malero Power Station, in conjunction with the two
stations just referred to in Switzerland, and a number of others
in Northern Italy, supplies the Societa Lombarda per Distri-
buzione di Euergia Elettrica. whose system is indicated on the
map of Northern Italy (Figure 11), which also shows how very
dense is the network supplying the country to the north-east of
Milan. The prices charged over this area are for lighting from
4d. to 6d., for power to small users 2d. to 4d., whilst for bulk
supply to large customers from %d. to Id. is charged. Mr.
Semenza, whom the author met at Milan, and who kindly fur-
nished this map, stated that 30 years ago this district was as
noted for its poverty as it is now for the well-being of its in-
habitants, the improvements being entirely due to the people
being now provided with an abundant and cheap supply of
power.
United States. —Keokuk Power Station is designed to be the
largest in the world. It is intended ultimately that 230,000
k.w. shall be lodged under one roof. Plant to half this capacity
is already at work, and power is transmitted 144 miles to St.
Louis. The station is a fine example of work of the highest
class.
In the neighbourhood of Denver steam and water power
stations are tied together. As a contrast to Keokuk, the Boul-
der Water Power Station was an example of how 100,000 volts
may be handled in an inexpensive and rough-and-ready fashion,
though all essential requirements had been cared for.

HYDRO ELECTRIC DEVELOPMENT


(iii) — State and Municipally=Owned Schemes.
Sweden.—At Trollhattan the government have 72,000 k.w.
developed, and sell in the immediate neighbourhood 18,000 k.w.
for the electrical smelting of Australian zinc ores, 8,000 k.w.
for iron smelting and 6.000 k.w. for the manufacture of ferro-
silicon, a fixed price of from £2/10/- to £2/16/- per k.w. year
being charged. Power is also transmitted to- Gothenburg at
50,000 volts, where the bulk charges are £2/16/- per k.w. year,
based on the four maximum weekly readings, plus 0.07 d. per
unit; 120 million units were supplied from Trollhattan in 1912.
At Elfkarleby, North of Stockholm, the government is de-
veloping 65,000 h.p., the works when visited being under con-
struction.
Holland. —The State Coal Mines at Heerlen, in Holland,
are extremely interesting, especially on account of the care
taken in providing for the comfort of the workmen, who change
completely and bathe in well-appointed bathrooms before pro-
ceeding to their homes. The coal used being all washed im-
mediately on arrival at the surface, the whole of the surface
works are remarkable for their cleanliness. At two of the mines
power to the extent of 7,680 k.w. is developed by steam turbines.
After providing for the needs of the mines, including electric
winding, surplus energy is sold to the Societe de Distributions
Electriques de Limburg at £2 per k.w. and 0 .24d. per unit. One
of the three directors of the State Mines expressed to the author
his opinion that the interposition of the distributing company
was a distinct drawback to an otherwise satisfactory" State ven-
ture. The output for 1913 was about 10 million units.
At Nymegen is a station owned by the municipality", which
supplies parts of the three provinces of Limburg, N. Brabant,
and S. Gelderland. 9,000 k.w. being in use, and the charges
varying from £4/8/- to £3 per k.w., plus 0 sd. per unit. Dis-
tribution and transformer charges are added for distant sup-
ply. Coal is relatively dear here, being nearly £1 per ton;
but wages are low, compared with what is paid in Australia.
Germany.—The State Coal Mines near Gladbeck were in-
teresting for the use of waste heat from coke-ovens for raising
steam, and of exhaust steam from winding engines for low-pres-
sure turbines. The usual by-products were being collected.


Switzerland.—The Albula Station belonging to the Zurich
municipalities was a beautiful example of well-designed work,
20,000 k.w. being transmitted 90 miles at 40,000 volts.
Canada: Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario.
This paper would be incomplete without reference to the opera-
tions of this Commission, the most notable example of State
enterprise in the direction referred to yet attempted in the
world's history.
The Commission, which-started operations in 1908, has its
headquarters in Toronto, and the author had an opportunity of
seeing- something of its work at both ends of the transmission
line, and of discussing with the Chief Engineer and various
members of his staff a number of points connected with the
undertaking which have a relation to the subject here treated.
The accompanying map, Figure 12, shows the network in
use last year. Power is bought at Niagara from the Elec-
trical Development Co. of Ontario, and delivered thence over a
large portion of the province of Ontario, the contract being for
100,000 h.p. at £2/3/- per h.p. year.
The Commission has a special Municipal Department, whose
work is thus explained in the 1914 Report, page 83: —
“The .Municipal Department is employed to secure the
necessary information for the preparation of estimates on the
cost of supplying power to those districts desiring it, through
dat<j collected by surveys of the districts and investigations of
the possible power demands. These investigations are made,
and estimates submitted, at the request of the municipalities
desiring power. After a contract for a supply of power has
been made between the municipality and the Commission, the
latter acts as consulting engineer when so requested, and is ex-
pected to prepare engineering plans, specifications, call for ten-
ders, and supervise the erection of the necessary material and
apparatus. Later, after power is delivered, this department aids
the municipality in building up its power load by acting as a
power solicitor, and advising the town and consumers regard-
ing the amount of power necessary and the proper electrical
equipment.
“The standardisation of apparatus, unification of rates, and
the inauguration of standard accounting systems are also under


FIG. 12

TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS

HYDRRO-ELECTRIC POWER COMMISSION
OF
ONTARIO


the direct supervision of the Municipal Department, which igi
also expected to give advice on questions of an electrical nature
at the request of any municipality in the province.”
In 1913 no less than 52 municipalities were served at rates
varying from £3 to £8 per h.p. per year for power, the smallest
township served having a population of only 400 inhabitants.
The rates devised by the Commission for charging individual
consumers are interesting. For domestic lighting they include
a charge of 2d. per month per 100 square feet of floor area,
counting all the rooms in the house, whether they are lighted
or not, plus a charge varying from 1 y 2 d. to 3d. per k.w. hour.
Commercial rates vary from 3d. to 6d. per unit for the first
thirty hours’ use per month of the installed capacity, and for
each unit thereafter from to 2y 2 d. in most instances (in
two instances to 3d., and in once instance 5d.). Discounts of
from 10 per cent, to 25 per cent, are allowed for prompt pay-
ment. For street lighting, the municipalities are charged from
£1 to £3 per annum for ordinary lamps of from 60 to 100 watts,
and proportionately higher charges for larger incandescent
lamps or arc lamps. The rates charged to the municipalities,
and framed by the Commission to be charged by the munici-
pality to the consumer, are dependent upon the cost of the trans-
mission mains and distributing system in the individual cases.
Apart from the 52 municipalities actually supplied, investi-
gations were in progress in 1913 with reference to the supply
of more than 100 other municipalities, townships, or districts,
many of which were, no doubt, supplied during 1914.
With regard to rural supply, the following is quoted from
the 1914 Report, page 186:
“A rural distribution system for the use of farms and
small villages has been commenced in ten different townships.
In some cases where they are of any size the business is handled
by the township. In other cases the nearest town handles the
work until the system grows, when it is taken over by the town-
ship. This arrangement has proved very satisfactory, since it
enables a number of demonstration farms to be established in
various parts of the country, and gives the rest of the town-
ship an opportunity of seeing electric light and power in opera-
tion on the farm. Much useful information has been gained on
these farms for determining the most suitable installation of


motors and machinery for the average farmer’s use, and in ar-
riving at the proper system of charge for different kinds of
service. ’ ’
The most suitable general equipment is also detailed in the
.Report, and recommendations are given as regards the most
economical method of using power. Near Toronto there are no
less than 200 farmers connected with the mains.
An interesting detail as regards the transmission mains is
that the Commission has been using aluminium cable provided
with a central steel core, which enables aluminium to be used
on long spans with considerably less sags than would otherwise
be possible.
The Commission has been stoutly criticised, especially from
New York. It possesses unusual parliamentary powers, which,
doubtless, might be capable of-abuse; but it appears to have
justified its existence, and the operations have been so success-
ful that-the Chairman of the Commission, long known as the
Honourable Adam Beck, who was chiefly instrumental in bring-
ing the scheme into being, has recently received the honour of
knighthood.
E.—SOLUTION OF THE POWER SUPPLY PROBLEM IN
NEW SOUTH WALES.
Dr. Ferranti has recently said that electricity supply is a
matter of national economy, and that properly carried out to
its logical issue, it is the greatest labour-saving factor with which
we have any prospect of dealing.
In Part I. of this paper it has been shown that the antici-
pated requirements within the next five years of the State are
■an increase of 106,000 k.w., and 312 millions of units per an-
num. In Part 11. it is proved that the coal and water power
resources of the State are ample for all requirements, and in
Part 111. an attempt has been made to indicate the best method
•of proceeding to provide for the State’s requirements.
The analysis of the problem leads one to the inevitable con-
clusion that the initial step to be taken in the solution of the
power problem to-day is the establishment of a large power sta-
tion on the southern coalfield, in conjunction with coke-ovens,
and recovery plant for tar, ammonia, and possibly benzol, to-
luol, and cyanide, this station to be tied in with a water-power


station established on the Shoalhaven or Snowy Rivers, and with
other stations in connection with established water supply and
irrigation schemes, and with the existing large power stations
in Sydney.
Coming to the question of ownership, the tendency in Aus-
tralia has been for such schemes to be nationally owned; and
it would seem probable that under existing conditions the ven-
ture is not one such as a private company would undertake. So
many industries have been nationalised that power supply would
appear to be a perfectly legitimate undertaking for the State
to carry on, at least as much for the well-being of the people
as some of the enterprises already started. The difficulty of a
company establishing works in connection with the Water Con-
servation Commission's reservoir at Burrinjuck, and say the
Metropolitan Board's Water Supply from Cataract, and of
working in with a hydro-electric scheme from the Shoalhaven
or Snowy Rivers, tied in with coal-power stations on the South
Coast or elsewhere, including coke-ovens, would be far greater
than for the Government to undertake this work themselves,
earmarking the water powers forthwith, and developing them as
the need for such development arose.
Consequently, the author submits that it is quite within the
bounds of legitimate State enterprise for this important matter
to be taken up by the Government, and as the demand is in-
creasing at such a considerable rate, it needs to be taken in hand
at once. There is no doubt that the conclusion of the war will
find Australia very much more self-contained in the future than
in the past in respect of all those supplies which her natural
resources enable her to produce, and in the economic struggle
for existence the universal provision of cheap power will be one
of the factors enabling her to succeed in that struggle.
CONCLUSION.
The paper has been long in view'. It is over four years
since the Honourable Arthur Griffith, then Minister for Public
Works, authorised its preparation; and to him the author’s
thanks are specially due, both for this and for enabling him
to visit other countries of the world to see for himself the power
developments that are there taking place. During the earlier
work involved, the author-would acknowledge cordially the as


sistance rendered by Mr. W. J. Hanna, then Under-Secretary
for Public Works, in placing the records of the Public Works
Department at his disposal.
The author’s thanks are also due to the present Minister
for Public Works, the Honourable J. H. Gann, and to the Direc-
tor-General of Public Works, Mr. J. Davis, M.lnst.C.E., for fa-
cilities afforded him in the preparation of the paper and the
accompanying drawings and photographs, and the preparation of
the blocks; to Mr. E. F. Pittman, A.R.S.M., Govt. Geologist and
Under Secretary for Mines, for permission to make use of the
map from his “Coal Resources of New South Wales”; to Mr.
A. A. Atkinson, Chief Inspector of Coal Mines, for assistance
with that portion of the paper dealing with the coal resources
of the State; and to those gentlemen, mostly members of this
Association, whose names are mentioned in the text as having
contributed facts of which the- author has made l free use, and
but for whose kindly co-operation the paper would have been
incomplete. Lastly, the author wishes to thank the officers of
his own staff who have assisted him, arid particularly Mr. J. J.
Richardson, A.M.1.E.E., who has not spared himself in helping
with the calculations and checking the results arrived at.
During the years that the author has been studying the
subject, the questions involved have been coming more and more
to the front, until the time seems now ripe for a full discus-
sion by those members of the profession whose occupation es-
pecially brings them face to face with the problems involved.
It is in this sense and with this object that the paper is pre-
sented.
