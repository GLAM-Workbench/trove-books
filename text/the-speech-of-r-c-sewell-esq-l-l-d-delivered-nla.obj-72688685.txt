DELIVERED
AT MELBOURNE ON Ist JULY, 1859,
IN DEFENCE OF
GEORGE CHAMBERLAIN,

CHARGED WITH SHOOTING, WITH INTENT TO MURDER

To the Reader, ?As I write tliese lines, two men are
suffering the last penalty of the law, at the Central Gaoh
Melbourne.
Whether it is a Christian and social duty, or whether it
is politic in a State to cut off from the world of life, and rush
into the spiritual realm, such members of a community as are
found by Courts of Law to be violators of its welfare, this is
no place to discuss; but there are so many points of interest
associated with the prosecution, conviction, and execution of
Chamberlain and Armstrong, that I have esteemed it my
duty to secure a more widely spread, and a more lasting
impression, from the eloquent address of Dr. Sewell, in
defence of these unfortunate men, than its mere delivery
could produce.
I am the more urged to do so by the recognition in our
community, of men who manifest so much of charity and
kindly sympathy with sorrow, as to shelter and defend the
despised and degraded of the people.

July 12, 1859.


SPEECH.
Dr. Sewell :?? May it please your Honor and Gentle-
men of the Jury: You will easily believe me when I say,
that I rise to address you on the part of those two unhappy men
who stand at the bar with feelings of no ordinary anxiety?
feelings, to which no ordinary language will enable me to
give expression; tremblingly alive to the fatal consequences
which an adverse verdict must necessarily entail on my clients ;
and not less so lest my own physical powers?already taxed
to the utmost, and my mental powers?already greatly
fatigued, should fail in my endeavours to lay before you
the facts of the case, so as to do justice to their interests. There
is, however, in the opening of the case, one duty which falls on
me ?-and which Xam delighted to discharge?it is to express to
His Honor, and yourselves, and to the Counsel for the Crown,
my grateful thanks for the personal kindness and attention I
have received during this trial. My words can only barely
convey them, ?can only imperfectly convey ?how much I
feel. From my heart, I thank you for the kindness you have
shown me to-day, and which gives me the support of which I
stand in urgent need. And further, whatever may be the
antecedents thrown around this case?whatever may be
the public opinion respecting it ?however these unhappy men
may have been prejudged ; and I fear, it is but too true that
in the minds of many they have been prejudged, ?yet in your
persons, I trust and I believe that I have found twelve men,
patient, conscientious, and discriminating ?anxious to recognise
and fulfil the duties of a Jury?who have come here to-day to
decide upon the whole truth, and nothing but the truth ?not to
be led away by any foregone conclusion ?not to be hurried away
by a popular cry ?not to be influenced by a popular frenzy,
howling, as it were, for the blood of these unhappy men, (and
such I may say has been the character of the public outcry against
them) ; but conscientiously discharging their duty as we all
hope to be dealt with at the Last Judgment, when we shall
have to answer for our own doings this day. It is indeed a
solemn responsibility imposed on fallible men who have
to decide on the life or death of a fellow being. And
Gentlemen, in dealing with the case before you, you must not,
you cannot lose sight of this, that the struggle of to-day, is


one of life or death. The prisoners are charged with a
Capital offence the Attempt to commit Murder. In ordinary
cases of prosecutions of this kind, there are many counts added,
which leave it open to juries to take a more modified view of the
offence, if proved to have been committed. But in this case the
Crown have, in their information, narrowed their charge, to
the charge of shooting with intent to u kill and murder,? ?in
other words, the prisoners stand here on a charge equally
capital to that of Wilful Murder. And if your verdict goes
against them, Gentlemen, the law will demand their lives, for
the atonement of the crime.
I alluded just now to the peculiar circumstances under which
this case had come before the Court. The Solicitor-General
indeed has also referred to the proceedings on the former trial.
And I do so because, under ordinary circumstances, Gentlemen,
X do not believe this case would have ever come before you
for trial. After an acquittal on a former charge?a charge
essentially in all its main facts, identical with the present ?and
which had been investigated before twelve men, who after a
most patient, careful, and conscientious consideration, pro-
nounced a verdict of Not Guilty. I say, that except under
circumstances of the most extraordinary kind, I do not
believe that the case would ever have been brought before
you again. The prisoners have already been acquitted on
that charge?and therefore, Morally speaking, I might ask for
an acquittal on this. Legally speaking, I cannot. Morally,
Gentlemen, 1 have a right to ask you to acquit the prisoners.
And I pray you bear with me while I remind you of matters
which have had considerable influence in inducing this second
prosecution. It is notorious that political and party feeling has
laid hold of the result of the last trial, and kept alive an excite-
ment which in the ordinary course of proceedings in Courts of
Justice, would have died away. I believe this case would never
have been revived, if political animosity had not laid hold of the
result of the first trial, as affording most improper and most
unjust grounds for attacking the present Government. My
learned friend the Solicitor-General will, I trust, believe me
sincere in expressing my conviction that he has had individu-
ally no part nor share in the matter. The whole country
was roused by party feeling, and by political invectives of
a considerable portion of the Press. It became a popular
cry. Had that not occurred, I believe these proceedings
would never have arisen again. I believe my learned friend
the Solicitor-General has too high a sense of justice?too high
a respect for justice? to have brought this case before the Court
a second time, alter a dispassionate Jury had disposed of the case
once. His own humanity?his own sense of constitutional jus-


tree ?would have revolted from such a course of conduct. He
cannot have lost sight of the legal maxim, ? Nemo dehet his
vexari pro eadem causa.? (No one is to be twice harassed
for the same cause.) But as it is, he was himself bound to
proceed this second trine ?I do not blame him. But in the
name of humanity I do blame those, who, by exciting popular
outcry, have led to these proceedings. I solemnly do deprecate
the conduct of those who have abused the freedom of the Press?
who have made the proceedings of a Court of Justice the
ground on which to prefer a charge against the Government?
who, for the sake of political, and party motives, have invoked
for a second time the criminal judicature of the country,
either to satiate a thirst for blood, or gratify political hate. In
your hands, Gentlemen, I believe I am perfectly safe from any
such evil influence. Yet I cannot altogether divest myself of
all anxiety. lam a man like you, and in common with your-
selves, well know how easily men?s minds imbibe impressions?
how readily we are persuaded,?and how difficult it is to
disabuse ourselves of first impressions. I know that there is
not one of you but must have heard of the circumstances, ?
the wild rumours in reference to those men, and the frightful
atrocities attributed to them. You too may have heard from
time to time, these men spoken of as guilty as the murderers.
And Gentlemen, I do not impute to you any frailty that does
not belong to human nature, when I ask you, whether before
entering that box, you had not some secret prepossession as to
the nature and merits of this case. And, Gentlemen, pardon my
inability to repress an anxious feeling on the point, even while
I bear my unfeigned testimony to the calm and conscientious
way in which you have hitherto listened to the case. Unbidden
thoughts suggest themselves, notwithstanding, I have the grati-
fication of knowing that one of you, Gentlemen, with feelings
that do him honor as a man and a citizen, suggested whether
he ought to have been on this trial, ?he having been one of
the Jury on the former trial; believing that those conscientious
feelings, which actuated him, pervade you all.
I will not dwell on such a topic, but having made these few
observations, will apply myself to the case itself. And I will
do so as briefly as I can. The lateness of the hour warns me
not to tresspass on your time, on this, the second day of trial.
Gratitude for the consideration you have already shown me,
forbids me to unnecessarily weary men, already severely taxed,
and to keep you from your homes, from which you have been
too long severed. And feeling this, I will endeavour to state
the facts on which I rest the defence of the Prisoners?nothing
extenuating?stripping the case of all extraneous matter with
which it has been encumbered. ?And then having combatted


the hypotheses, and disposed of the minute and, as it seems to
me, unimportant, facts, with which the Crown has thought it
necessary to bolster up a case, otherwise unsupported, except
by the most unsatisfactory and insufficient evidence, I hope to
bring your minds to the conviction that it is impossible for men
dealing honestly between the Crown and the prisoners, to
pronounce any verdict than that of Not Guilty.
I might regret there is not here, as in the sister country at
home, Scotland, ?a verdict of Not Proven. I feel satisfied
that in many cases, a verdict of Not Proven would relieve Juries?
minds from the serious responsibility they have to deal with in
doubtful cases. But it is not so here ?and you are bound by
the law of this land to find a verdict of Guilty, or Not Guilty.
If the Crown fails to make out a case against the prisoners,
they are entitled to a verdict of Not Guilty. My learned
friend put it to you in his opening, that if you had any sub-
stantial doubt as to the prisoners? guilt, you are bound to give
them the benefit of it. No doubt you are. On the other
hand, I, as the counsel for the accused, tell you if you
find a clear and connected case, supported by clear and
decisive testimony?unbroken in its chain, and consistent in all
its parts ?if the case is irreconcileable with any other conclu-
sion than their guilt?then, doubtless, you must deal according
to those facts. And according to these facts, as men of
ordinary sense, you will give your verdict accordingly, and that
verdict will be Guilty. But before you come to this conclusion, I
have yet one other caution to give you. You have heard a mass
of evidence given, much of which has no real bearing on the case
?lt is thrown to you in a mass. But you are not therefore to
allow your minds to be prejudiced. The very quantity of
matter presented, to you may give rise to suspicion in your
minds, but you are not for that reason to find men Guilty?
You must have a certainty , and such a certainty, that when you
lay your head on your pillow to-night, you will do so with
the feeling that in giving your verdict this day, you have been
actuated by dispassionate considerations which have led you to
one and one only conclusion. For if you doubt between two
conclusions the prisoners are entitled to your verdict. To find
them Guilty, you must be satisfied there exists no reasonable
ground for your coming to any other conclusion.
And, Gentlemen, there is yet another point arising out of the
nature of the offence with which these unhappy men are
charged, to which I must call your attention. That there has
been a most fearful tragedy we must all admit. But would it
not be a more dreadful thing if a more fearful tragedy took
place, and two more lives were to be sacrificed by the solemn
proceedings of a Court of Law. You are here to-day to


vindicate Criminal Justice and uphold the peace of society.
But while anxious to do that which the law requires of you?
to punish with all the severity which the law requires, those by
whom blood has been shed, ?does it not strike you as very
possible that the very enormity of that offence may, by exciting
your indignation and arousing your feelings, tend in some re-
spect to lead you to entertain unjust, and yet not wilful, im-
pressions, as to the guilt of the parties associated with the
crime?to induce you to confound the Criminal and the Crime?
and because a crime has been committed, to visit the accused
with punishment. When your only real and legitimate object
was to punish crime. And let me not be mistaken in these
observatious. My only object has been to guard you from being
influenced by feelings. The legal decision as to the guilt of
these men is that which is intrusted to you, and I am assured
you will fairly give your verdict on this trial, on this and this
alone.
And now to the facts of the case. Beyond all doubt
a fearful tragedy has been committed. Our best feelings
have been pained and outraged, that in the open day the blood
of our fellow men should be shed by armed assassins. Of that
there is no doubt. But you cannot stop there. You have to
say from the facts before you, are the prisoners the men who
did it ? Let me ask you in the first place how they come before
you. Up to the time of the commission of this bloody and
inhuman act, they were of very good character. It is even
admitted that one of them had been trusted with money to a
large amount, and even without security, so good had been his
repute; and the other had had an opportunity of appropriating
to himself that very plunder which is said to have been the in-
centive to the offence with which he is charged, and had re-
stored it to the very man whose life he is said to have taken.
It will be said no doubt by the Crown, this is mere character?
the most fallacious, and least satisfactory of all proof. But
this is not the correct view. In all cases you must take character
not merely as having some bearing on a doubtful case, but as an
essential part of it. It is at least a strong presumption in favor
of the prisoners that up to the period of this offence, they have
been living as industrious members of society, and with char-
acters unimpeached. And when you have to deal with a case
like this, depending solely on presumption, (for the Solicitor-
General admits he has no direct proof,) it is a very important
consideration that the previous conduct and habits of the ac-
cused are such as would render it improbable that they would
be guilty of the crime charged against them. So that you
have in the first place a presumption in favor of the accused.
In the next place, how stands the evidence ? My learned


friend opened the case to you at considerable length. He went
into a large mass of details, many of them really having no
bearing in the matter, except so far as they effect the credibility
of two men, whose testimony, from their own admission, I assert
to be worthless, and on whose statement he calls on you to find
these parties guilty. But I repeat to you, that you are not
to find men guilty on mere presumption , but on proof.
Let us try how far such proof has been presented to you or
not, I mean circumstantial, for the Solicitor-General admitted
he had no direct proof. In the first place the evidence failed to
show that either of the prisoners were aware that the late Mr.
Green was to proceed to Melbourne at a certain time with gold.
In the opening, that fact was stated unequivocally, at least as
regards Armstrong, but certainly the evidence failed to bear it
out. The evidence proved that Armstrong came to Mr.
Deakins, with a message that Mr. Green was coming to his
place at Swift?s Creek, on the Monday. But Mr. Deakins does
not appear to have the slightest knowledge that Green?s
coming had anything to do with the gold, until after he saw him.
All that he knew was, that Mr. Green was coming to
balance some unsettled accounts. And Armstrong returns
to Day?s Hotel on Monday. Armstrong remains there, in that
belief, that night. He is out on his own business during the next
day. Chamberlain is also out on his own business. Mr. Green
starts on Tuesday about six o?clock, for the purpose of going to
Melbourne. On the road they are met by the prisoner
Chamberlain; by a man who is called Sydney Penny ; and
a third party who is not identified. By and by, you will find
how important that will be in reference to a part of the evi-
dence of the Crown ?I mean the proceedings of Tuesday even-
ing. Mr. Green the deceased, is accompanied by Green the
Policeman, ?by Day, and by Miss Mutter. Chamberlain was
known to all?at all events, Green the Policeman at that time
knew Chamberlain, and he well knew Armstrong. He identifies
Chamberlain and the man Penny, but it does not appear he
spoke to the third party. Now, what was there at that time to
hinder these parties from committing the offence with which they
are charged ? Supposing, as was afterwards suggested, and has
been suggested during this trial, they had gone out for the
purpose of committing this offence on Tuesday Afternoon, where
was there anything in the world 1 o prevent them committing it
then? There was absolutely nothing in the world. And, in
this you have, I think, a strong circumstance in favor of
Chamberlain, ?of his having no criminal intent of committing
this robbery and murder, for by his conduct he evidently
courted identification. He goes up to Miss Mutter and speaks
to her, thus ensuring his identification. Is there the remotest


probability that with such intent as that suggested, he would
go up to her and shake hands with her, before passing on ? 1
confess to you that this extraordinary feature in the case,
meeting us in the outset, affords grounds for a strong pre-
sumption in his favor. It is perfectly irreconcileable with the
preconcerted scheme which the Crown have suggested to you
on the part of Chamberlain.
The party proceeds. Where at that time their destination
was, appears uncertain, perhaps their ultimate destination
was to be Swift?s Creek, but at all events, they do not
get there that night. On Tuesday night Chamberlain and
Armstrong return to Mr. Day?s Hotel. As to their con-
duct there what are the facts? You have had in the
course of the evidence brought before you, the evidence
of a person ramed Miss Muir, who comes before you and
deposes to a conversation which is said to have taken place on
Monday Evening, in which Armstrong and Chamberlain were
speaking of a person using the word ? he?, and then she after-
wards turned it to Green ?her first evidence being as to the
words used. ?? We do not know what time he is going to start?,
and on the last occasion?? We do not know what time Mr.
Green is going to start?. Now, in one sense, the statement or
the discrepancy is not very material ?in another, it is of the
highest importance. As to the transactions of Monday it is not
very important whether the word ?Green? was used or not, as
he did not start till six o'clock in the Afternoon of Tuesday ,
and at that time the Prisoners were about their own business. It
is so far important because it shakes the whole of the witnesses?
testimony. If a witness for the Crown comes into the witness
box a second time, after having given evidence before, and after
the case has assumed a peculiar aspect, such as this has done
if memory varies as to the material facts?or being refreshed,
if a witness speaks positively of things of which, on the first oc-
casion, only an imperfect impression existed ?what reliance can
be placed on such a statement? And if testimony be broken
down in one part ?if it is incredible as to one part, how can you
believe it as to the residue? There is indeed another conversa-
tion spoken to by Miss Muir, to which I shall have to advert ?
at present I pass on. What happened then ? They go to
bed, and something is then said about sleeping in the same
room. Gentlemen, I do not know if at that particular time,
any particular object was to be gained by their sleeping
together ?what was the object I cannot understand. At all
events Chamberlain does not object, to sleep with a third
person. And what does the third person, called McCrae prove?
Why, what he puts before you is not enough whereon to found
a mere conjecture. Taking the statement of Miss Muir, that


the prisoners were engaged to go out early the next morning
to look for some horses on the Omeo Plains, is there anything
so extraordinary in their wishing to sleep in the same room,
or even the same bed ? Is it anything extraordinary in this
colony for two mates to sleep in the same bed? That is the
way to put it to you. I say it is an ordinary arrangement
in this Colony. I do not mean to say that Miss Muir has
intentionally misrepresented facts, or against her present be-
lief. But it is certainly singular that the only point of her
evidence which bears the semblance of materiality was entirely
omitted on the first trial, and when the whole of her knowledge
of the matter would be comparatively fresh in her recollection.
What Miss Muir?s conversations with her sister, or with others,
since the former trial, may have had in altering her memory,
I cannot say?but the fact is, that such a change, and one put
forward as a material one, has taken place, and is not satisfac-
torily explained.
Again, it is put to you by the Solicitor General in his opening
as a false statement on the part of the Prisoners, that on
Tuesday Night, they had been on the Omeo Plains, whereas, in
truth they had been in an opposite direction. But if you re-
member Miss Muir fixes this conversation on Armstrong, and
not on Chamberlain, and Armstrong clearly was not at the
meeting on Tuesday night?and there is nothing in her statement
inconsistent with truth.
And further, Gentlemen, can you, from facts so simple, so
easily explained, infer that there was at this time any evil con-
spiracy or combination between them ? It appears their con-
versation was overheard by a person in the next room. But
if they had such objects as those imputed to them, why not
have selected some place where they could have discussed
their plans in silence ? On the contrary, the whole of the
case shows that there was not the slightest concealment from
beginning to end. But I again pass on.
The next day they start ?at what time is not known. But
this we do know, that from Day?s House, Livingston, up to Swift?s
Creek, is something like 17 or 18 miles. How was ?the start
on the part of Mr. Green to be made up ? But, Gentlemen,
you have this additional fact. There are different tracks on
the way, and I want to know by what instinct was it
on the part of the Prisoners, that they should know where to
meet these gentlemen ? What reason had they for supposing
the party had not in the first place gone on to Swift?s Creek, or
stopped at some other house at Tongio ? And, if the party
stopped anywhere on the Tuesday Night before reaching Swift?s
Creek, how could the Prisoners know the time of starting in
the morning ? How are they to know what side of the river


they would take. Here is a party having 14 miles start, and
yet the Prisoners are to know where to find them. It appears
to me, but you are to judge, that if this was a scheme, it was
the most impracticable and ill-concocted scheme I ever heard
of in my life.
Again, Gentlemen, was there any other person who knew, Mr
Green dealt in gold? Were the Prisoners the only persons
who knew it, or were there other persons who knew it?
It appears it was generally known. But if this be so,
there is an additional reason why you should require evidence
to fix the guilty parties, and to lead to their identification.
Now, is there such evidence, or rather, as regards the Prisoners,
do not the facts disprove their complicity ? Let us see what does
take place in the open day-light. Mr. Green, the constable
Green ?of whose courage?whose coolness, and whose determin-
ation and self-sacrifice, I can hardly speak of in terms suffic-
iently eulogistic?a man who by his conduct has earned the
thanks of the whole community, and the admiration of every
true and courageous man ?he is there, and is shot at a
distance of between 4 and 5 yards ?and, strange to say, he
cannot speak to the party by whom he is shot. His answer on
that point is, that the man had something over his eyes. Then
he is asked, can you speak to his height, his size, or anything
which would distinguish the man ? It is proved that he knew
well both Chamberlain and Armstrong?but he does not say
one single word that would distinguish Chamberlain from any
other human being in the world. The same with Armstrong.
And Mr. Deakins and Miss Mutter were there?they too knew
both the accused. On the previous day Miss Mutter had shaken
hands with Chamberlain. But she says nothing that would
identify him as one of the party. Mr. Deakins is in the same
position. In fact, not one single human being recognises the
men, nor even suggests there was a similarity between them. You
are told a great deal about circumstantial evidence, but I ask you
how you can get over this (so to speak) positive negative testimony
?negative proof ? Here are three persons having a full oppor-
tunity of recognising the persons who made the attack; and not
one ventures to suggest even a resemblance. It is clear that Green
could never have lost his control or self-possession, because
he can speak of the color of the man?s coat, and other peculi-
arities of his assailant ?and yet he says nothing in the world to
point to the identification of those two persons.
If the case stood there alone, there would be an end of it.
But then you are pressed with what my learned friend the
Solicitor General calls circumstantial evidence. Now, beyond
all doubt, where circumstances hang together so as to form one
unbroken chain?where all the several links are deposed to by


Credible witnesses, the proof is the more reliable, according to the
minuteness of the facts, and the greater number of the parties
who depose to them. In other words, in a case of circum-
stantial evidence, the greater the number of persons who speak
to circumstances, the greater and more cogent is the proof.
Because it may be easy to find one man to perjure himself, but
the commission of a crime, and such a crime as perjury, by a
number of witnesses, the majority of whom probably could
have no personal interest in the case, is hardly within the
scope of probabilities. But let us see what this additional
evidence is. You are told, on the Bth of this month the Prisoners
are seen at the house of a person named Toak. You are told
this likewise, that the horses of a person of the name of
Davies are stolen close to Day?s Hotel. Gentlemen, does
it not strike you that this is an extraordinary fact? that if on
the sth persons who are known to have had horses before
of their own, and perfectly distinct from Davies? horses, if they
are the persons who committed this robbery and murder?that
they should have returned to the scene of their crime in order
to steal those horses ! And yet they did, for that has been
proved. Would they not have fled in an opposite direction?
Had they committed the crime imputed to them is it likely they
would have gone back to the spot the most likely where they were
to be known ? Do you think they would not have immediately
carried out the intention imputed to them in another part of the
evidence, of going GOOmiles, and of leavingawidedistancebetween
themselves and their pursuers? Would they not have immediately
carried out their intention of going overland to Sydney ? But
instead of flying with all possible expedition, whilst an oppor-
tunity exists, they are there doubling back upon the scene of
their guilt. And for what purpose? Why for the purpose of
an additional and unprofitable offence ?to steal horses. That
they stole those horses there is no doubt ?but that is the strongest
possible proof that they are perfectly innocent of the present
charge.
The next fact that is put in evidence to prove the complicity
of the prisoners, is the finding of a strap behind a tree;
and about that you have heard a great deal of evidence : and a
great deal of stress has been put on it. Now let us see what
the facts are. In the .first place Green told you he found the
strap behind the tree from which the man stepped who shot him.
Supposing Mr. Green did find it there, it might have been strong
evidence that the person who fired that shot had left it. I asked
him how he fixed that tree. His answer was: ?It was to his
right,? and then he oidy observed it on his return. Now, I
think, Gentlemen, you would be at a great loss if, in
the bush, you went away some distance from a spot, you


were required to come back, and then fix on any one tree. It is
familiar to every bushman that there is nothing so difficult
for a man in the bush as to attempt to track his way by
trees, unless they are particularly marked. The witness was
asked, ? How do you know the tree ?did you take particular
notice of the tree ?what was there to distinguish it from
others ?? And he says?? it was near where Mr. Green?s body
was lying.? He was then asked : ?did you see Green shot?? Ans.?
?No?. ?How did you go away? ? Ans.?? I went away across the
river and came back by a different way?. Now, I want to know
how, under those circumstances, any man could possibly fix
any one tree? Recollect the glance was momentary ?he is
alarmed and wounded. I want to know, in a moment of dis-
traction and terror, what means he had of observing that tree.
But unless, Gentlemen, you fix that tree, there is an end of the
strap, so far as it can affect this case. Of the identification of
the strap I shall have to speak hereafter.
Now we will go on, and we find that the Prisoners are said
to make their appearance at a place called Toak?s. Now, with
regard to the evidence of those two men, Toak and McMahon,
Ido not know which is the least credible. Gentlemen, I do
not believe any of it, nof do I believe you do. Ido not believe,
if you were obliged to rest your verdict on their evidence
alone, you would believe them for a moment. You would
rather arrive at the conclusion that those persons came here
with a concocted story against these Prisoners, with a view
to put on them an offence, of which at least Toak knows them
to be guiltless. Now, first of all, what is the connection
between them? What does McMahon say? He says?? he had
known Toak only by dealing with him; and on the Bth of
January, for the first time, he was asked to come and take
care of Toak?s store?. Now, Toak, when he is recalled
tells you this is not the first time McMahon had taken charge
of the store. Which of the two is telling the truth? McMahon
or Toak? Or are they neither telling the truth ? As to Toak,
you heard him?you saw him here, trembling, nervous, and
hesitating to give an answer to any question of importance.
It was clear he was thinking how to shape a tale to suit his
purpose. Is he to be believed when he says?? That McMahon
was formerly entrusted with his store ?; and is McMahon to be
believed when he says ?? That this was the first time ?; or do
you think that both of them got together and concocted this
story out of court, and forgot it when they came into court ?
In fact this is evidenced by the inconsistencies of their answers.
Again, where was McMahon on the 7th January? He says
?? I was at Gibbo?s Creek?. I asked McMahon, do you re-
collect my asking you on a former occasion where Toak was,


and you could not tell ? Ans.??Yes?. Where was he? Ans.
?? He was at'Gibbo Creek making a road?. Now, Gentle-
men, you may remember I pressed him.?l put this question:
? On the last trial, when I asked you the same question, did
you not say you could not recollect?]!? When I said ? How
did you come to make that answer ? He replied?? Oh, you
put the questions to me so rapidly?. Now, Gentlemen, if
ever there was a man who?displayed, in a glaring degree,
the cunning in fencing with questions ascribed to the lower
orders of his countrymen, he is that man. You heard
him?you saw him. I could not ?'get a direct answer from
him, In fact, it may be said, I could get no answer.
In a similar way I asked Toak where he was on the sth, 6th and
7th, he said, ?I was making *a road one day??he could not
say which. On the [former trial, he, like McMahon, could not
tell where he was on either day. Now by a wonderous
coincidence, he too like McMahon, bethinks him of the road for
the first time. But he disremembers, to use his own words, the
interview about the road which McMahon spoke to, but on the
contrary puts McMahon at a different place altogether. And
how long did it take ? ? About 3or 4 hours.? Now where
were these men on the sth, 6th and 7th ? How do
they account for themselves ? Taking these circumstances
together, and you have a strong proof that McMahon
and Toak were acting together for some mysterious pur-
pose. Let us trace their connection still more closely, and,
after hearing Toak?s evidence, I do not think you can have
a doubt as to what that purpose was. How comes McMahon
at Toak?s house all that time ? What was he doing ? Toak
says, ? Looking after the horses, and waiting for the Police.?
But McMahon comes and tells you on the Tuesday night he was
lying in bed. Further, what is the effect of evidence as detailed
by them. In the first place you have the prisoners coming to
Toak?s house with their saddles on the Bth. They remain there
that night and the next day. Now where was the difficulty
Gentlemen, of their going away during this time ? Toak
returns, and the prisoners return the same night.?And then
we have that precious piece of documentary evidence which was
produced at the r former trial and disbelieved, and which I believe
you will regard as spurious, more particularly when you come to
see the way in which it was said to be concocted. Toak and
McMahon gave entirely] different statements as �to where they
were sitting at the time the documents in'| question are
said to be written. McMahon tells you there was a
Receipt written and read over, and he heard it ?and Toak tells
you that the only document read was not a Receipt, but a
statement read by ( Chamberlain t to \ Armstrong, and that he


read in a low voice , so that nobody else could hear him. And
nobody else would hear him. Let me ask you Gentlemen, in a case
of this kind, when witnesses come with a tale, evidently
preconcerted, and you see them almost at the outset so help-
lessly breaking down from internal inconsistency, I ask you
if you can believe them? But what is Toak?s personal
claim to credibility ? He will not tell you how many gaols he
has been in, in England, or in this Colony. Who is he ?
What is he? What have been his antecedents? He will
answer no question at all about it. Then you have heard the
story of Ballaarat Harry. You have heard the story of the man
who goes up with his mate into the bush, ?leaves him there ?
comes back with his horse, and with his gun I believe, and with
the man?s dog?who has been charged with the murder?and
who will give you no account at all of such a very suspi-
cious transaction. Do you think that that man whose
career has been so infamous, and who is shown to have
been placed in cucumstances which have already brought him
under the recognition of the criminal law, as suspected of a
murder?do you believe there is any villany in the world before
which he would shrink? Taking even his own statement as having
had those men at his house striving to aid them in escaping from
criminal justice?taking from them under color of a sale what he
must have known was ill-gotten goods?an accomplice in every
sense of the word.?l shall ask you in what way you can look at
evidence of that kind ? I ask you Gentlemen, putting
aside all the internal proof of the falsehood of this man?s state-
ment, can you believe him, even from what has fallen from his
own lips as to his own character ? Could you find a verdict on
such testimony even in a Civil case, much more where the blood of
a fellow creature awaits your decision ? But you must believe it
before you can find the prisoners Guilty. For if you do not be-
lieve Toak, the whole of this case must fall to the ground?
It rests on Toak, and him only?l know it will be attempted to
bolster up his evidence, by saying that there are collateral mat-
ters, on which he is corroborated. And with reference to this
I tell you that Toak stands as the accomplice, both in the crime
horse-stealing, and in that of murder?and in order to convict
parties, on the evidence of an acccomplice, it is not enough for
the Crown to corroborate him on collateral facts, unconnected
with the charge, the corroboration, in order to be efficacious,
must be as to facts bearing directly on the charge, and the con-
nection of the prisoners. .Again I should like to know how
Toak came by that wonderful intuitive knowledge of
all the details relating to the charge in question, if he
was not a party himself. By what wonderful intuition
was it that he should ask the prisoners how they came
to tomahawk Green. Where could Toak learn that ? He,


it is said, might have heard it at Mrs. Day?s. It is said she
told him, but where is Mrs. Day ? If she had given him a full
detail of all the facts, it would have been easy to bring her here.
But all he says is, I heard of the murder , and they were sus-
pected. How comes he to say, ? you have tomahawked Mr.
Green.? If he were not a party how could he know that a
tomahaAvk had been used ? or if he knew this from Mrs. Day,
it was of the highest importance to show that Mrs. Day had told
him of the occurrence. This might have been corroborated,
but it is wanting. You have heard the evidence of the other
conversations which that man Toak gave. You have heard with
what difficulty the story was wrung from him?how he wavered
?hesitated?doubted, and contradicted himself. Even the
efforts of my learned friend Mr. Brewer, to obtain his evi-
dence, Avas in effect, like draAving a tooth from him. It
was only when he was absolutely compelled, that he could be
made to give an answer. But further, how far, is the statement
given by Toak of the connection with Chamuerlain. is proved to
be a fabrication. He makes Chamberlain state what never
occurred. He says that Chamberlain told him, ? that three of
them Avere about to rob Mr. Green on the afternoon of the 4th,
only Sydney Penny shied off.? Is that true?or is is not
directly at variance with the evidence given by Green,
namely, that Chamberlain so far from wishing to rob them,
made up to them at that time, and shook hands with them,
and made himself perfectly known to them? Further, what
conclusion can you draAv from his own conduct. You have his
evidence, that he received, and harbored the persons, knowing
them to be guilty of horse-stealing?robbery and murder. His
first question is about the horses, then what about the gold ? ?lt
was suggested that he was acting under the influence of fear,
Avas afraid. At first he says he Avas ?and then that he was
not, ?He is asked if he then he was a little afraid?
and then he says he does not know exactly the purport
of those questions. But this you learn, that he was there
for several days, supplying these men not only with the
means of subsistence, whilst there, but afterwards, and when
he certainly could have had no fear from them, supplying
them Avith flour to support them during their flight?even ac-
cording to his own evidence, when there was no longer any
occasion for doing so, and when, if he had been honest, he could
have fetched the police?you have him going three miles into
the bush for the express purpose of enabling them to pursue
their flight. All this is very strange, if Toak had no selfish
object in view. You have heard from Mr. Davis about the
reward. Do you think Toak had an eye to that reward ? Do
you think Toak having, at least, known a good deal about
the matter, would be very reluctant to shift the burden on


other shoulders than his own? Nay more, would he not he
very glad to get rid of the men who gave him the orders for
the horses, for which he never gave any other consideration, than
the aid and assistance rendered to them as an accessory to their
guilt. As to Toak?a man steeped to the lips in crime?do you
think he would hesitate to commit such an act ? Do you
think the accused of the murder of Ballaarat Harry would shrink
from human life? Do you think that when he has every-
thing to gain, he would not be the first to put on those
men the charge he has endeavoured to fix on them. Gen-
tlemen, you have heard his account of the writing, and which he
says was written by Chamberlain. When you consider the
character of the man who gives this evidence, and the admission
of the other witnesses who speak to that letter being very unlike
Chamberlain?s usual hand writing, does it not strike you that the
writing is, with at least equal probability, that of some person,
who has imitated him partly. We do not know exactly when
this was done. But this we do know, that although you have had
witness after witness called here and sworn, in order to prove
the hand writing to be that of Chamberlain, ?the persons
who came to speak most distinctly and accurately to the
hand writing,?every one said in reference to the receipts,
they believed the signatures to be Chamberlain?s, but as to
the body of this document, they thought it might be, but they
all said they would not swear to it.?nay further, that
it was not like it. There is only one man Crimp, who
swears with certainty to that document. Now all the
witnesses who were examined on the first trial, said dis-
tinctly, ?If that is Chamberlain?s hand writing, it is not his
usual hand writing.? But gentlemen, do you think that that
party then disguised his hand writing, when in point of
fact he was writing, if he wrote at all a private memoran-
dum to a man named Paynter, on a subject which, must be
accompanied by the authenticity of his own hand writing.
Davis and Day, who speak about the hand writing. �I
allude to the hand writing of the letter, for that is the only
thing I care about here?they both say it is unlike Chamberlain?s
general hand writing. Let us see who else speaks to the letter.
We have persons called here who ought have been called at the
first trial, ?persons who are brought here to bolster up a crimi-
nal case which failed in the first instance. In the first place, a
man comes here, who, it turns out only saw him write once in
his life, and he then wrote a fair copy of some Racing Rules. And
I have only to point out to you, how different a fair copy is from
a man?s ordinary hand writing. And then Crimp comes and says
he took a butcher?s bill, and because he gets a butcher?s bill,-
this gentleman makes himself familiar with the ? K?s ? and
*? P?s.? of the writer. When did this man Crimp even make


such an examination before ? Did he ever do so before this trial ?
I can quite understand Gentlemen, when a witness finds a paper
attached to documents, some of which bear all the appear-
ance of coming from Chamberlain, that he may say, I know his
hand writing, and from the general resemblance, a first
impression and assume it as the fact. But here a witness from
having observed two letters in a butcher?s bill, undertakes to
swear to this document. Gentlemen, it is not what the man
swears, but do you believe him ? Is there any one else who
recognises this hand writing : Oh yes, there is one swears it is
very similar hand writing, but how he makes his ? P?s? and
? K?s,? he could not tell. But this testimony is distinctly at
variance from the others?he says it is perfectly like, while others
say it is perfectly unlike. Deakin and Davis say it is unlike.
Gentlemen, can you say, with the conflicting testimony which
the crown has brought to day, ?We have not doubts about that
writing ? ? And if you have doubts, there is an end to the case,
for there is not a tittle of evidence beyond that document, to fix
that man with this crime.
But again, assuming, Gentlemen, for one moment, that it is
even Chamberlain?s hand writing, is there no way of reconciling
that with his perfect innocence of this transaction ? You will
recollect according to his own confession, Chamberlain, at the
time he went to this place, had been guilty of horse-stealing, and
believed there would be a hot pursuit for him, he told McMahon
he had seen Toak, and he had directed him to Gibbo?s Creek.?
Toak denies this ?which is true ? Ido not understand how the
prisoners ever reached Toak?s, unless it was that they had seen Mr.
Toak. In fact, did they meet, or is there reason to believe they
did ? What was Toak?s object in going to Livingstone ? Toak?s
evidence is that he went in the first place that morning to Day?s
for the purpose of carrying a bag of flour. Why should he have
gone 35 miles ? Why could he not have gone down to the Store
below ? What was his object, when he could have got it at the
Store below? You will observe there is not a word about any
sugar in his story. When Toak comes back ?according to his
version, he brings a bag of flour weighing 2 cwt. on his horse,
?a distance of 30 or 40 miles, but what time he leaves you
don?t know. Then McMahon comes and says he brings back
flour and sugar, and something else. Is not this additional vari-
ance, a proof of fabricating a tale, the object of which is to shift
from themselves a very unpleasant suspicion. It is not for me
* to tell you now in what degree these inconsistencies are material.
It is sufficient to point out to you they are palpable. I might
perhaps very properly appeal to the Book which is never spoken
of in Courts of Justice, but with reverence?l allude to the
Bible.?You will recollect the Jewish maiden accused of adultery
by the Elders. And the very proof of their falsehood was, a dis-


trepancy when they came to speak of a particular tree. I might
appeal to a still more solemn occasion, in which there were many
called to speak to a conversation in which they could not agree.
Now I want to know where I am to draw the line. Up to what
point are men to be believed. Where does falsehood end and
truth begin ?
But, if you cannot believe McMahon and Toak from first to
last, there is an end of the case against these prisoners. But
to revert to my argument. Should you be of opinion, that this
document has been traced satisfactorily to Chamberlain, is it the
first instance that a young man has been made the dupe of
old and experienced villains ? Is it at all improbable
from what we have heard, that Toak wishing to make a plant,
told the prisoners: you are suspected of the murder; you had
better devise something to get rid of the suspicion. Do the con-
tents of this letter render such a motive at all improbable ?
And is it improbable they should have fallen into the trap ?what
say the great writers on evidence ? I am reading from Stark?s
book of evidence, (Dr. Sewell read from Stark on evidence,
p. 73, the passage begins, ? The presumption of a person
accused of crime is to be with great caution, &c.?) If that
is so, how much stronger is the case I have put to day. Thank
God for the prisoners? sake, Green is living; and Green?s is
the testimony on which I shall ask you to day, whether the pre-
sumption does not evidently point the other way, and in their
favor. But a great deal has been said in this case about the
straps, by way of corroboration. Now I think on reflection,
you will put those straps entirely on one side. I have already
spoken as to the finding?now as to their identification. You
heard the evidence of the man Cross to day. And you heard that
that he identified the strap by a particular mark. And you will
recollect this, Gentlemen, first there were two straps, then three
straps; and can you make any thing out of them ? We have a
witness who says they were sold as a pair, and yet they are not a
pair; and then you are told that he might have sold 100 like these
within the previous six months. Is there, therefore, any evidence
at all to induce you to believe that that is the strap Cross sold a
month before to Armstrong. How can you by any possibility of
means fix that as the one sold to Armstrong. Recollect they
don?t swear at all to the straps found in the swag. Then we
come to the arms they have. A great deal has been made of
the guns. Is it at all singular for men accustomed to a bush
life when travelling, to carry guns with them ? Do you not con-
stantly see men coming in, or leaving Melbourne with guns,
and as to men travelling about the bush, how many draymen,
carry guns, or rather I might almost have said, in some
parts do not carry guns ? But more particularly, when men are
going to choose a location, is there anything unnatural in their


carrying guns. Again, certain guns and cartridges and shot are
produced ?for what purpose beyond a little melo-dramatic effect,
I cannot suggest. They do not even correspond in their com-
ponent parts. I mean the cartridges traced to the prisoners, and
the slugs with which Green was wounded. If they mean to say
that the cartridges fired on the sth, were of the same descrip-
tion as the shot found on the Bth, how does it happen that
Green?s coat was not riddled with shot ? It must have been,
were that the case, so that the suggestion really appears to me
absurd. As to comparing one charge of shot with another, they
might just as well go and take a handful of peas out of a barrel
and identify them. The next point with which they try to
strengthen their ca : e is : While the pursuing party are going over
the plain, a man with delirium tremens escaped. This is put as
a corroboration of Toak?s evidence, but in fact proves nothing?
Where was Toak that day? Is it at all impossible he might
have been there himself, and seen the whole proceedings him-
self. Even supposing it is perfectly true, those parties had said
we have seen a constable with a person who had delirium tremens,
on the Bth, how does that in any way corroborate the offence on
the sth ? If it does not in some way corroborate the offence of
*
the sth, it has no significance whatever.
Gentlemen, I might dissect the evidence still more minutely,
but time warns me that I must soon close the case. With the
serious responsibility that rests on my shoulders, I should be
grieved if I had lost sight of one argument which the case
would admit of, while at the same time I am anxious not to
weary you?l have already told you, that unless you believe the
evidence of Toak and McMahon, there is nothing to effect the
prisoners. Their having guns on the 10th, has nothing to do with
the transaction of the sth. In order to find them guilty, you
must believe not merely that that document was signed by Cham-
berlain, but you must believe that Toak speaks the truth to you,
when he comes and details the circumstances detailed to him by
the prisoner.
You must believe Toak, or acquit my clients. A few more
words and I have done. I do most solemnly appeal to you
on behalf of the men who are now standing, I may say, on
the brink of the grave, (because, if your verdict goes against
them, that will be their fate) ?on behalf of men who have
been already tried substantially for the same offence, and
on whom a jury of their countrymen has passed a verdict of
acquittal,?on behalf of men who are friendless and penni-
less, who have no means of defence except such as chance
throws in their way?of men, young, and entering into
life, who are now standing before you in the full vigor
of health and energy of youth?men who stand charged for this
serious offence, on the evidence and oaths of men, so degraded


as Toak, so unworthy as McMahon?of men, I say, whose inno-
cence is not impugned by any evidence but theirs.?l pray you
most seriously and solemnly to weigh the case long and anxiously
before you pronounce a verdict against these two ill-fated men.
If your verdict is against them?they die, and that word
involves the most awful considertions. To die ?Do you
know what death is ? You may have stood before the
death-bed of the good and resigned, and hopeful Christian,
whose parting hour has been a depart ure from this life,
into what you may fairly hope and believe will be happiness?
you may have witnessed the last moments of expiring life
soothed by affection, and consoled by the offices of the church,
and all that can contribute to console the living and the dying.
Yet with all that, the hour of death is a very fearful and terri-
ble thing to all. But what must it be to the wretched inmate
of the convict?s cell?condemned to die, with the absorbing and
awful conviction, that the moments between life and death, time
and eternity, are numbered.?Pass in imagination from the Court
to the Condemned Cell; Picture the last few hours of life :
Fancy the remorse and agonizing feelings that will arise when
reviewing his past life ; ?all his sins rising like ghastly spectres
before him, haunting the moments of waking horror, or scarcely
less horrible slumber, until the last, when he must meet his
God ? unhouselled, unannealed, with all his sins upon his head,?
?it may be unrepentant, or relying on such repentance only
as the coudemned cell, and the remorse, and fear, and anguish
of a few short hours would suggest. Fancy him taken thence
into the horrid chamber of Death?with all its ghastly details?
then comes the last pang of mortal anguish ?the last struggle
of expiring life?and the soul of a sinner stands naked and
trembling before his God. That is the fate. Gentlemen, which
hangs on your lips; I pray you solemnly ; I pray you to weigh
it well this night. It weighs heavily with me now, for fear I
should have in any way failed by neglect or omission, to have
done my duty towards these men. And that the fearful
position of these men weighs heavily on you, I read in those
earnest glances you are now casting at me. That it must
press heavily on his Honor, I know full well; for his must be
the most painful duty of all. Gentlemen, you will do your duty
to your country ?to those prisoners?and to yourselves ?a duty
which will make our own heart?s peace with itself, and the
discharge of which, when you come and reflect on this day?s work,
will enable you to t.ay, we have done what we have done con-
scientiously. I believe you will say you cannot conscientiously
on such evidence as this find the prisoners Guilty. You wifi
not, you dare not lay their blood on your heads, ?you will, you
must acquit them. I pray the Great God to light you to
that decision which is just and right, whatever that may


be, to lead and guide you to that verdict which the full
justice of the case requires. Gentlemen, I have done.?
The Solicitor-General having addressed the Jury in reply,
Mr. Justice Pohlman summed up, and the Jury retired at half-
past eleven o?clock to consider their verdict, and at twelve
o?clock returned into Court with a verdict of ? Guilty ? against
both prisoners.
The Associate asked Chamberlain if he had any thing to say
why sentence of death should not be passed upon him.
Chamberlain spoke as follows: I do not know that I have
anything to say. The Judge who tried me, in summing up,
spoke fair, and acted fair throughout the piece. If the deposi-
tions were compared, it would be plainly seen that those gentle-
men who gave evidence against me have been guilty of false
swearing or perjury, or what you choose to call it. I hope
those gentlemen who write for the papers will have the kind-
ness to say that I thank Dr. Sewell and Mr. Frank Stephen for
what they haue done in my defence. They undertook my de-
fence without being asked, and they have acted as friends to
mankind throughout the piece. I have not thanked them, but
I hope they will take this as thanks. I am content to die ac-
cording to the verdict of the Jury against me, and according to
the laws of my country. It is one great comfort to me that I
go before my Maker with a clear conscience.
Armstrong having been called upon in like manner with
Chamberlain, replied that he had nothing to say.
His Honor having passed sentenced of death upon both
prisoners in the proper form.
Chamberlain said he hoped he would be allowed pen and ink
to write to his friends.
His Honor said that every attention would be paid to him. A
Minister of religion would attend him, and he would have every
thing allowed him that was consonant with his position.
Chamberlain then said: I hope the public will not think me
guilty of bravado. I know the position in which I stand; I
am aware that I am on the brink of the grave, and that is no
time for bravado.
