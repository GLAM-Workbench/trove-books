Who Rides To-day?
Bending neck to bit and bridle
Pace the war steeds in their pride;
Who will fill the empty saddles ?
Who will for Australia ride ?
Who rides to-day, for Empire rides,
Where Duty leads the way —
Where brothers fight and die for us—
Who rides, who rides to-day ?
Will you mount for heroes fallen ?
For your soul’s sake in this war?
There are Southern horses waiting
On the crimson fields afar.
They are waiting dumb, expectant,
Jingling rein and tossing head,
For the men who’ll charge for Freedom
In the saddles of the dead.
Hark, the bugle call resounding
From across the Ocean wide —
Take the steed that waits a soldier,
And for dear Australia ride,
— E. Beaufils Lamb
Eastertide.
April, 1917.
