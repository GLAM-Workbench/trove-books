Some Statistics Concerning
CRICKET
CASUALTIES
(Showing Batsmen struck by Bowlers
in Test Matches between England and
II 1 rilll '"stralia )


FOREWORD.
The Australian Broadcasting Commis-
sion is publishing this booklet because it
feels that the question of “leg theory”
and/or “bodyline” bowling is one which
has at the present time genuine interest
for the Australian public and because
the Commission has at its disposal in-
formation which bears directly ,on the
question, which shows at a glance the
number of injuries occasioned to bats-
men by bowlers in all Test Cricket
Matches played between England and
Australia since the year 1876 and which
is otherwise available to very few fol-
lowers of the great national game of
cricket in either country.
This booklet expresses no opinion on
the merits of the present issue, nor on
the question of responsibility for the in-
juries enumerated, nor even on the desir-
ability of having batsmen struck by bowl-
ers; it merely sets out briefly and im-
partially the time, place and nature of
injuries to batsmen of either country
and the names of the batsmen and bowler
involved, allowing the simple facts to
speak—if capable of speech—for them-
selves.


INTRODUCTION.
It is well recognized that few outdoor
games are unattended by a certain
amount of risk of physical injury to
the players. There are, indeed, those
who hold the opinion that an element of
danger is a valuable element, in that it
strengthens the moral fibre of the play-
ers, even as the exercising of their mus-
cles develops their physique. Be that
as it may, the popularity of boxing, of
wrestling, of hunting and of the various
codes of football prove conclusively that
risk of some personal injury to the play-
ers is no bar to the playing or the watch-
ing of a game.
Cricket has never been generally re-
garded as a game which exposes its
players to grave risks of physical hurt
and the tabulation of the injuries suf-
fered by batsmen in Test Matches played
between England and Australia, although
most of them have been slight, may well
cause surprise to many readers. Yet
cricketers have for generations recog-
nized the possibilities of injury and have
cheerfully accepted that risk; from which
one may perhaps assume that they will
go on doing so for many years to come.
From the following statistics it will
be seen that between the years 1877 and
1933 (inclusive) English and Australian


batsmen have in Test Matches alone been
struck no fewer than 203 times by the
deliveries of opposing bowlers (exclud-
ing, of course, blows on the leg-pads
which they have worn). This total of in-
juries is spread over a total of 69
matches in which at least one such in-
jury was sustained, which gives an aver-
age of slightly under three such injuries
per match, although there were many
matches in which no batsman was struck.
Of these, 118 were sustained by Austra-
lians and 85 by Englishmen; and it is
noticeable that an alarming increase has
been shown in the last three seasons,
particularly in the case of Australians,
since they have been struck 40 times, as
compared with 14 in the preceding four
seasons and only twice in the four years
before that. England, too, has had some
increase of casualties, her records show-
ing respectively 18, 12, and 15 for the
same periods as compared with consider-
ably smaller totals in the earlier years.
In all, 48 Australian and 38 English
batsmen have been struck, Sutcliffe
(England) heading the list with 18 blows
and Woodfull (Australia) following with
11; Hobbs (England) 8, Ponsford (Aus-
tralia) and Woolley (England) 7, and
Fingleton (Australia) 6 follow in that
order, from which also it will be seen
that such occurrences have been more
frequent of recent years than they were
before.
Finally, of the bowlers who have de-
livered the balls which caused these in-
juries, Larwood (England) heads the


list, his total being 34; J. M. Gregory
(Australia) follows with 20, then Wall
(Australia) and F. R. Foster (England)
with 13 and T. Richardson (England)
with 10. It is notable that Hammond
(England) has struck batsmen six times,
whereas E. A. McDonald, who has been
coupled with Gregory as a bowler dan-
gerous to batsmen, has only the same
number opposite his name, while two
other famous Australian fast bowlers, A.
Cotter and E. Jones, have struck bats-
men in Test Matches only five and three
times respectively.

ducked to a ball from -Larwood, and re-
