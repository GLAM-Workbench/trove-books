stands the punishment of ex-
cavator loading; available with a
rock body capable of carrying
27,000 lbs. and an earth body to
carry 30,000 lbs. A 128-b.h.p.
diesel engine assures ample
power. Constant mesh-helical
gears engaged by hydraulic clutches allow instant change under any conditions
or speed. Mechanical tipping gear raises the body in 10 secs. Features include
4-wheel tandem rear drive, reversible driving controls. Four speeds In either
direction gives unequalled performance on short-haul shuttle operation.
The Aveling-Barford cu.
yd. (6 ton) Diesel Shuttle
Dumper follows the same
general designs but has single
rear axle drive, reversible driv-
ing controls, a full speed range
both forward and reverse, giving
excellent short-haul time cycles,
and suiting very rough, loose
or greasy ground conditions.
Instantaneous hopper tipping
and re-setting ensure rapid turn-around.
The Aveling-Barford 1 cu. yd.
Dumper is an economical and
handy machine for the rapid
conveyance of bricks, sand, con-
crete, earth, etc., on building
sites and similar locations. The
three-wheel design gives great
manoeuvrability, and this 1-yd.
Dumper withstands the gruel-
ling work inseparable, from
operation under i or f cu. yd. excavator. A wide wheel track of 5' and a low
centre of gravity give stability and safety of operation on uneven ground.

EQUIPMENT NOTES

GENERAL STATEMENT RELATIVE TO
EARTH MOVING EQUIPMENT
It is Impossible to make a definite rule relative to the type of equipment to
use on earth-moving jobs. There are certain jobs on which one type of
equipment mi/ work as well and as economically as another.
It will be noted in the following recommendations that there is an overlapping
as to the optimum distance of moving dirt for Which the various equipment
is best adapted. In the last analysis, the equipment which will do the job
at the lowest cost should be selected. This will be influenced by a number
of factors, and a few that should be particularly considered are as follows;
What will be the investment for equal capacity on various types of
equipment?
What will be the labor and operating cost with the type of equipment
being considered as compared to other types of equipment?
Are the men of the organization, orthe men available, capable ofoperating
the equipment being considered?
If the equipment will not be worn out during the life of the project for
which it is purchased, will the equipment be adapted to the type of
work which will be performed in the future!
Can the equipment be broker down and diversified so that it will do a
number of operations? Will it be possible to use certain of the
equipment when a small amount of dirt is to be moved, or will it
be a one-piece, expensive unit which would necessitate the entire
unit working, regardless of the amount of work to be done, such as
finishing and clearing preparatory to working the main job or working
small jobs?
The remarks made on the succeeding pages are intended to point out
as nearly as possible the type of work that certain equipment is
particularly fitted for performing.
The cheapest way to handle dirt where soil conditions will permit is with
self-loading equipment, in that it eliminates the loading costs. Self-loading
equipment cannot be operated in rocky soils, in soils with stumps and roots
unless the soil has been grubbed, or in conditions where the bottom of the
borrow pit will have seep water or be below the water line. Self-loading
equipment cannot be successfully loaded or will not dump and clean itself
with any degree of satisfaction where the borrow pit and soil is soft and
sticky. In certain hard soils it is necessary to scarify the soil prior to loading
with self-loading equipment. This is particularly true on the larger type
self-loading scrapers.
BRITISH STANDARD MACHINERY CO. LTD.


FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE EARTH
MOVING ESTIMATES
There are many variable factors that affect any dirt-moving estimate. Certain
of these factors are under the control of the contractor, foreman or operators;
many of them are factors over which they have no control —factors which
may make any data submitted unreliable on a certain job. A few of these
factors are as follows:
1. Type of soil, top and sub-soil.
(a) Physical characteristics.
(b) How it will pack.
(c) How it may slump.
(d) How the sub-soil may sink.
2. Weather conditions.
3. Amount of dirt wasted.
4. Proper selection of equipment for the job.
5. Condition of equipment.
6. Efficiency of operators.
7. Experience and supervising ability of the foreman and general super-
intendent.
8. Efficiency and co-operation of entire organization.
9. Proper knowledge by the entire organization of how to do the type
of work being performed.
10. Rigidity of specifications and inspections.
The performance information given on the following pages is an actual com-
posite of time studies, engineers’ data and contractors’ data, based on concrete,
specific jobs, and is an average that can be readily duplicated by the average
efficient contractor.
The performance figures given are for pay dirt, based on actual operations
overlong periods,and in most cases on data obtained from engineering records.
It is a frequent practice to take the number of loads hauled for an hour or a
short period of time and multiply this by the manufacturers' rating, and in
many cases the heaped rating. Obviously, figures arrived at by this method are
approximate, as pay dirt will only average from sixty-five to eighty-five per
cent, of the heaped measurement, depending upon the soil type and moisture
content, etc. The average dirt moved per hour, if determined from the total
for a week, month or the entire job, will be considerably lower than a figure
based on a selected hour or day when the entire organization may be striving
for a record.
In studying any earth-moving job, the following should be considered:
1. The type of equipment to be used.
2. The quantity of equipment required.
3. Margin to allow for adverse weather.
4. What the equipment investment will be.
5. Cost to do the job (preferably broken down, based on work units,
such as cubic yards of earth moved).
ALL CARE HAS BEEN TAKEN BUT NO IS ACCEPTED

FRESNOS
(Including 2-Wheel Rotary Scoops)
Fresnos are suitable for use in soils where there is no sheet rock or where
the size of the rocks will permit them to pass fully into the fresno mouth
opening. A fresno will haul more dirt per pound (£) of investment and
at a lower cost than any other equipment in distances adapted to its operation.
Fresnos are commonly used for cutting down grades, making fills, doing
medium fine grading, making channel changes, building small dams, excavating
for small lakes and reservoirs, excavating for basements, grading and filling
around buildings and other landscape operations. Fresnos are ideally adapted
and commonly used for removing overburden, stripping gravel pits, and for
supplying gravel and sand to portable washing and screening plants. Fresnos
are ideally adapted to short earth-moving and excavating operations under
conditions where the location of the material is such as to permit the operation
of a crawler tractor. Roughly, fresnos are adapted to the most economical
handling of dirt hauls from nothing up to a maximum of 200 or 300 feet each
way, but longer leads are economical if working downhill or when “slot-
scooping.”

CARRYALL SCRAPERS
*SAFE AVERAGE PERFORMANCES. —Based on job data and field obser-
vations in both America and Australia, these figures should be easily equalled
or exceeded with average conditions, average operators, average dirt and
average weather. The figures are in PAY-YARDS, and are safe for estimating
purposes, according to users’ reports. The use of these figures is far more
practical than theoretical formulae.
fHIGH EFFICIENCY PERFORMANCES. —These figures have been equalled
and exceeded with good conditions, good operators and efficient management.
Some equal a “S 3 minute hour.” For estimating purposes, however, users
are recommended to use the smaller figures, irrespective of the make of
tractor and scraper. (Actually the Britstand Scraper will move approx. 10%
more dirt per hour than some other makes of scrapers, as the bowl shape and
the hinged push-out floor reduce loading and unloading time and absorb less
power.) Average operator efficiency over long periods can be taken as
equal to “40- to 4S-minute hour,’’ which will make clear our reasons for
depreciating figures on a 55- or 60-minute hour.
BRITISH STANDARD MACHINERY CO. LTD.


CALCULATIONS
(SCRAPERS)
Most jobs involve numerous materials, e.g., a layer of top-soil followed
by a layer of common earth, followed by sub-soil comprising clay and/or
sand. Moreover, a large portion is usually a MIXTURE of one or more of
the above. The thickness of each layer usually varies through the Job.
Seasonal changes in moisture content also affect the volume-change. Some
materials will boil freely: others, like sand, cannot be heaped in the scraper
bowl.
Thus any calculation of the number of scraper-loads that will require to
be moved can only be approximate, and the time required will also vary
according to (I) the condition of the tractors, (2) the enthusiasm and efficiency
of the operators (two quite separate matters), (3) weather conditions,
(4) moisture content, (5) fineness of the material, (6) amount of dirt wasted,
(7) rigidity of inspectors and specifications.
The theoretical formula in PAY-LOADS per HOUR is, of course:—
CxSxEx6o
T
where C = heaped Scraper Capacity (in cu. yds.).
S = Co-efficient of Slump (i.e., Top Soil 87%, Earth 80%,
Light Clay 70%. etc).
E = Efficiency of Operation.
T = Cycle Time (in minutes).
Because of the numerous variables, particularly in S & T, and —over long
periods —-in E, it is far more practical to work on the tables shown on the
previous pages, which are based on hundreds of job studies. We emphasise
the desirability of using the smaller figures in each case. Peak performances
make good advertising information, but they are dangerous standards for
use in making safe estimates, in figuring probable costs, or the time and
number of machines necessary to shift a given yardage.

DOZERS
On side hill work, in levelling dumps or transferring dirt on short hauls,
particularly where the cuts and fills are close together and balanced, and
for handling boulders and blasted rock without loading, a bulldozer or trail-
builder will handle dirt cheaper than any other type of equipment. Bull-
dozers and trailbuilders are particularly adapted to moving dirt distances
of from nothing to 200 to 300 feet.
These are very conservative estimates based on good solid and level
grades. Working between windows on a dump will increase the capacity.
The type of soil, amount of dirt wasted, efficiency of operators, organization
of the dump, waggon or shovel operators will influence these figures.
For “60 minute hour” high efficiency theoretical output, add 50%, as the
following figures are equivalent to a “40 minute hour.”

EARTH MOVING CALCULATIONS
CAPACITY RATING OF DOZER BLADES
Athough it is correct to assess a Dozer Blade ON A GIVEN JOB to be moving
so many cubic yards of material per trip, it is barely feasible to allocate a
fixed capacity rating FOR GENERAL PURPOSES lr the way that it car be
done with a Scoop.
A Scoop bowl has a relatively definite capacity. The amount of material
shifted by a Dozer Blade varies two or three times as widely because it is
more greatly influenced by the physical characteristics of the material doted,
the surface over which the material is being moved, the gradient, etc. Ever
if we only consider the nature of the material, this statement becomes plain
when it is remembered that in dry sand a Dozer blade may shift 40% less
than in clay, whereas Scoop output will only drop approximately 10% to 20%.
CALCULATIONS
Most jobs involve numerous materials, e.g., a layer of top-soil, followed by
a layer of common earth, followed by sub-soil comprising clay andyor sand.
Moreover, a large portion Is usually a mixture of one or more of the above.
The thickness of each layer usually varies throughout the job. Seasonal
changes in moisture content also affect the volume-change. Some materials
will boil freely: others, like sand, will not.
Thus, any calculation of the number of dozer cycles required to move a given
volume of earth can only be approximate, and the time required will further
vary according to (I) the condition of the tractors, (2) the enthusiasm and
efficiency of the operators (two quite separate matters), (3) weather con-
ditions, (4) moisture content, (5) fineness of the material, (6) amount of
dirt washed, (7) rigidity of inspectors and specifications.
The theoretical formula forcalculating output in PAY-YARDS per HOUR is:—
C x S x E x 60
T
Where:
C = Loose Volume moved per trip (in cu. yds.}.
S = Co-efficient of slump (i.e. Top-soil 87%, Earth 80%, Light Clay 70%,
Heavy Clay 66.6%. Rock 50%).
E = Efficiency of operation. Use 70% (i.e. a "42 minute hour") for
safety under average conditions.
T = Cycle Time (in minutes).
BRITISH STANDARD MACHINERY CO. LTD.


The Cycle Time “T,” as applied to dozing, contains elements dependent
on the type of dozing work. Low gear speed should be used when moving the
load. Low reverse or high reverse will be used when backing up for the
next load, dependent on grade and ground conditions. »
On heavy dozing, Full low gear speed may not be attained if the soil contains
large roods, boulders, etc., or if ground conditions will cause track slip. The
“Efficiency" factor of the formula will absorb these losses.
TO CALCULATE CYCLE TlME—example:
1. Straight “Out and'Back” or Shuttle Dozing.
Assume distance 100 ft.,
Time Out, Low Gear 100
at 1.7 m.p.h. (149 A/min.) = = .67 mins.
149
Add Gear Shift = .15 mins.
Time Back. High Reverse 100
at 3.64 m.p.h. (320ft./min.) = = .313 mins.
320
Add Gear Shift = .15 mins.
Total Cycle Time “T” = 1.283 mins.
2. “Cut & Swing" Dozing Cycle Time “T” is usually taken as totalling
.75 to .90 mins.
3. Back Filling such as dozing back into a trench from one side, Cycle
Time “T” is usually taken as totalling .65 to .80 mins.
4. Side Casting. Refer instead to capacity schedules.
Because of the numerous variables, particularly in C. &. S., and —over long
periods—in E, it is far more practical to work on the actual tables shown
on other pages, which are based on hundreds of job studies. Peak perform-
ances make good advertising information, but they are dangerous standards
for use in making safe estimates, in figuring probable costs, or the time and
number of machines necessary to shift a given yardage.

SHEEPSFOOT ROLLERS
Sheepsfoot Rollers are suitable for use in soil free from sheet rock, or where
the size of the stones will permit them to pass freely between the sheep’s feet.
A Sheepsfoot Roller will compact an earth fill at lower cost and do better work
than any other mechanical method of compacting the fill. Sheepsfoot Rollers
are suited for compacting the floor of reservoirs, putting down clay seals in
reservoirs, core trenches, etc., compacting railway and highway fills and
embankments, levee banks, aerodrome runways, etc.
When the dirt is spread in shallow layers and rolled and re-rolled with Sheeps-
foot tampers, the result is a firm, closely compacted fill that will not settle if
it has been properly tamped.
Material being compacted should be watered to ensure proper moisture
content for maximum compaction, water added being suitably controlled.
Material to be compacted can be initially spread by various methods, such
as by graders, dozers, scoops, motor trucks, etc; provided, where scoops
or trucks are used, that the material is of suitably free flowing nature for
adequate control of initial depth of the loose layer. Opti mum tractor speed
for the use of Sheepsfoot Rollers is approximately 2.5 m.p.h.
SAFE AVERAGE PERFORMANCES
Based on job data and field observations, the above figures should easily be
equalled or exceeded with average conditions, average operators, average dirt
and average weather. Since operator fatigue is less than when controlling
scrapers or other equipment, the use of a “•45-minute” hour is conservative.
For “60-minute” hour theoretical outputs ADD 33% to the above figures.
Note. —For tandem operation, multiply the above figures by the number
of rows of rollers in tandem, since the term “tandem” does not necessarily
imply only two sets of rollers.

SOIL CHARACTERISTICS
Experienced engineers know that pay yardage is influenced by the degree
to which ary given type of soil swells or shrinks, and this varies widely.
Talcing, for example, “good common earth,” or “clean sand,” or “clay,”
the size of the particles will govern the voids (or air-space between particles),
and the moisture content will vary according to weather, drainage, etc.
Thus, 100 cu. yds. of “good common earth” in place may, when loosened,
occupy 125 to 143 cu. yds. in the scoop or scraper. After compaction it
will be only 35 to 95 cu. yds.
The extent to which any particular material will swell and shrink can only
be accurately determined by laboratory tests of samples taken from the
site, and making allowance for varying moisture content.
For estimating purposes, the following averages taken from hundreds of
jobs in Australia and elsewhere will be a reasonable guide.
Thus, a 12.5 yd. scraper (heaped rating) working in common earth, would
only be carrying 10 pay-yards (excavated from the solid). Scraper capacity,
converted to pay-yards, is therefore shown below:—

RIPPERS AND ROOTERS
Rippers and Rooters enable considerable economies in the breaking up of materials prior
to dozing, scooping, etc., and also in breaking or clearing out roots, etc., in land clearing.
Field observations show that the use of a Ripper or Rooter prior to scooping shows a highly
payable increase in daily scoop yardage. As an example, a 12-yd. scoop working on a 7’5C-ft.
haul, will move an additional 150 cu. yds. in 8 hours after the ground is properly ripped
before scooping. Under some conditions or on shorter hauls, this figure is considerably
increased.
Another primary benefit is the reduced strain and wear on Tractors, Trailbuilders and
Scoops, saving In fuel consumption and better heaped loads.
The accompany! ng tables will enable convenient esti mating of Ripper and Rooter outpu ts.
Any estimate based solely on the overall width between ripper tynes will be inaccurate,
due to the fact that varying types of earth and roclc will shatter to a greater or lesser
distance outside the rooter tynes. (The distance left between runs will vary with these
conditions, although 18" would appear to be a safe figure for calculating purposes.) in
other words, there is no fixed relationship between “width over tynes” and “ripping
width.” It is therefore necessary for the experienced engineer to assess this factor before
using the schedule. If, for example, the width over tynes of the ripper is 4ft, and it is
considered that the material to be ripped will pulverize satisfactorily to a distance of 6"
beyond the centre of the outer tynes, then the ripping width for those conditions would
be sft., but would, however, vary inversely to the moisture content.
Speed range from 1 to 1,7 m.p.h. is covered by the schedule. Where tractor speeds
exceed the latter figure it will, in most cases, be found more economical to scoop without
ripping.
The figures shown represent a 40-minute hour for output in the solid (i.e., prior to rip-
ping). This 40-minute hour should allow for losses because of (I) “efficiency of opera-
tion” and (2) time lost in turning, etc. Against this, figures may increase because of
(a) extra margin between runs resulting in greater effective cutting width and (b) added
volume after loosening and scooping (see “Soil Characteristics’’ on Rage 47).
Compared to performance data for ’dozer or scoops, the yardage figures in this table
may seem at first glance to be unduly high. It should be remembered, however, that
one ripper or rooter will break enough material to keep 3 to 6 tractors and scrapers
employed. Contractors’ data reveals that I hour of ripping may yield sufficient loosened
dirt to keep a scoop (hauled by the same tractor, or its equivalent in h.p.) em ployed from
4 up to 15 hours, depending on conditions. Hard earth and rock and similar difficult
aggregate will increase ripping time.
In very hard going it may be necessary to rip and then to cross-rip. In this case the outpu t
figures corresponding to the particular ripping width and depth and tractor speed should
be halved to make allowance for this double work.

EQUIPMENT COMBINATIONS
Considerable losses have been experienced by users through receiving wrong
information as to the size of scraper or other plant item that a giver size
tractor can haul. Allowance must be made for a variety of working con-
ditions over the life of both the tractor and the drawn equipment, and the
tractor should be able to comfortably haul the drawn machine after the
tractor has become a little worn and is no longer capable of its full power
output.
The ratings given are therefore conservative, and intended to assure the
lowest dirt-moving costs over the longest period. The ratings are suited
for various makes of tractors and equipment, and STRUCK CAPACITY of
scrapers is emphasized, since heaped ratings vary widely. Tractor ratings
are in terms of maximum draw-bar H.P. (of which the S.A.E. rating is the
usual 75%).
indicates the preferred combination.
a possible but inferior combination.
N.B.—Above recommendations are not based on the use of a pusher
tractor. Individual recommendations should be obtained for same.

WAGGON DRAFT REQUIREMENTS
The drawbar power required to move loads will vary in accordance with
speed, grades and ground conditions. The drawbar load should not exceed
75% of maximum drawbar pull (rated pull) of tractor in second gear.
Waggon Draft —Pay Load at 2| m.p.h. (4.023 kilometres per hour).
Pounds and Kilograms per Ton Load (907.2 kilograms).
DRAWBAR HORSE-POWER
To figure draw-bar horse-power (use either of the below formulae): —
Drawbar H.P. = Pounds pull X speed in miles per hour
375
Drawbar H.P. = Speed in miles per hour X pounds pull X .00266
To figure drawbar load:—
Drawbar pounds pull = Drawbar pull rating in horse-power X 375
Speed in miles per hour
To determine tractor load: —
Rated pounds pull In operating speed
Draft per unit of drawn equipment
BRITISH STANDARD MACHINERY CO. LTD,


DRAWBAR POWER
REQUIREMENTS ON GRADES
To calculate the drawbar power requirements on grade, it is necessary to
add 20 pounds per ton of gross weight (drawn equipment plus tractor plus
load) for each per cert, of grade.
Example;—To haul a 10-ton load up a 12% grade it is necessary to add the
effort required to move this load over level terrain to the effort required
to lift both equipment and load to a height equalling the per cent, of grade—in
this instance, 12 feet.
Calculations, then, are as follows: —
L = Pay load in tons ( = 10 tons).
P= Pounds required per ton on level (refer page 39 Assume un plowed
earth = 75)
T = Total equipment weight in tons (assume 8 tons)
G = Per cent, of grade (=l2)
First compute the pull required over level terrain, which is pay load X pounds
required per ton:
i.e., L X P = 10 X 75 =750 lbs. drawbar pull on level.
Add the pull required on grade, which is 20 pounds per ton of gross load.
(Pay load plus drawn equipment plus tractor) x per cent, of grade,
i.e., 20 x (L + T) x G
20 x 18 x 13 = 4320
Add power required on level 750
Total = 5070 lbs. drawbar pull.
To Determine Effective Tractor Drawbar Pull on Grades
Tractor drawbar pull on level — 1% of the weight of the tractor load for
each 1% of grade.
To Determine Drawbar Pull of Load on Grades
Drawbar pull of unit on level + 1% of gross weight of load for each 1% of
grade.
To Determine Tractor Capacity on Grades
Tractor drawbar pull on level —1% of weight for each 1% of grade,
Draft per unit on level +■ 1% of gross weight for that unit of equipment
for each 1% of grade.

RELATION BETWEEN. MILES PER HOUR AND FEET PER MINUTE, DISTANCE TRAVELED, AND TIME.
TO Use: If tractor speed is known in miles per hour and you desire to know its speed In feet per minute,
find point on seals "A" representing the speed an miles per hour and read off directly against it
on seals "B" its equivalent in feet per minute.
If it is necessary to find time consumed by tractor to travel a certain distance given In feet,
find corresponding point on seals "D1" connect with point on "A" (representing speed) extend line
and where it intersects "D2" read off minutes. If distance is given in miles use seals "C1" and "C2".
BRITISH STANDARD MACHINERY CO, LTD.


RELATION BETWEEN WEIGHT Of TRACTOR IN POUNDS, LOSS DUE TO GRADE IN POUNDS, AND % OF GRADE
To Use: Find on seals "A" point that corresponds to weight of tractor or aggregate. Find
on seals ”C" point that corresponds to grade in question, connect these points with
straight line. Where the lino intersects seals "B" read off loss due to grade.-
Subtract this loss from pounds pull at drawbar of that speed tractor is to he used
at. The remainder is the available Pull.

WIRE ROPE
LAY. —Of the types of wire rope used in earthmoving and logging equip-
ment, Regular or Ordinary lay and Lang lay are the more usual.
Regular lay wire rope has the wires in each Strang laid in contrary direction
to the lay of the strands themselves, whereas Lang lay has the wires laid in
the some direction as the strands. Lang lay rope resists both abrasion and
bending fatigue longer, but is a more “snaky” rope.
GALVANISED VERSUS BLACK ROPES.— Galvanised ropes are intended
for use as standing rigging, including stays, anchor ropes, etc. They are not
suited for logging winches or P.C.U. work.
GAUGE OF WIRE AND NUMBER OF WIRES.— The heavier the gauge
of individual wires in the strands the stronger will be the complete wire rope,
but it will be less flexible. Similarly, the less strands the stronger the rope.
Thus, awire rope I]' circ. 6/19 is appreciably stronger than a \\" circ. 6/24;
again, 6/19 will be stronger but less flexible than 8/19. (Wire rope size is
specified in the trade by “circumference,” not “diameter,” although the use
of “diameter” is more usual by earth-moving authorities.)
6/19 indicates 6 strands of 19 wires per strand.
8/24 indicates 8 strands of 24 wires per strand.
The sire of the wi res within the
strand may vary, thus 6/19 wire
rope may com prise 9 wires en-
closingafurther9 wires around
a further one wire (total 19
wires) and indicated as 5/19
wire rope, 9/9/1, or may have
I2wi res over 5 wires over one
wire (total again 19 wires) and
specified as 6/19 wire rope,
12/5/1.
These two different ropes (although both I| 7 circ. 5/19) would be suited to
different applications.
HEMP-CORE AND WIRE-CORE. —Primary purpose of the core of each
strand and of the main core of the complete wire rope is togive a foundation
to keep the individual wires and strands equally spaced. In “hemp-cored”
ropes it is made of resilient oil impregnated hemp and also serves as a vehicle
for lubrication. In “wire-cored” ropes the hemp central core is replaced by
an independent wire strand I.W.R.C. wire rope (“Independent Wire-rope
Core”) is slightly stronger than “hemp-cored” rope and is essential to resist
the crushing load when passing over the small sheaves used in earth moving

equipment. I.W.R.C. ropes are dangerous tor logging work and have caused
fatalities, being very “whippy” or “springy.” Hence wire rope with a hemp
main core is essential for safe logging, but should NOT contain hemp in the
individual strands or excessive crushing will result.
QUALITY. —Wire of various qualities is available, the higher quality giving
greater strength without increase in the size of the complete wire rope, e.g.,
best plow steel, special improved plain steel, etc."
SIZE. —See “Modern Dirt Moving Methods for Scrapers and Rooters”
(Page 55) or “Dozer Operation” (Page 52). Whilst less important on an open
drum such as a logging winch, correct wire rope diameter is vital for maximum
life when running in sheaves such as on P.C.U.’s or cable-controlled earth-
moving equipment. Sheave grooves are precision made to accommodate
the correct size cable.
*For logging work 9/9/1 —if procurable—is considered stronger and more
suitable than for Example 12/6/1.
SIMPSON’S RULE FOR AREA COMPUTATION
Divide base into any. even number of equal parts, and measure
length of perpendiculars or ordinates through each division.
If S equals sum of lengths of first (f) and last (I) ordinates;
E equals sum of lengths of intermediate even ordinates; N equals
sum of lengths of intermediate odd ordinates; d equals common
distance between ordinates; then

SAFE BEARING PRESSURES ON
FOUNDATIONS
The following table sets out safe loads on ordinary foundations where the
foundation material has not been loosened and where it has lateral support,
as in trenches.
Where the foundation material is a thin stratum overlying weaker material
—for example, a band of shale on clay—the pressure should not exceed the
loading which the weaker material will carry.
Adequate tests of the foundations should be made for important structures.
SLOPES OF BATTERS OF EMBANKMENTS
The angles of repose relate rather to laboratory conditions with controlled
grading and moisture contents, and are not applicable to field conditions.
The batters are shown by ratio of base to height of slope, and are applicable
for earthworks exposed to all weather conditions.

LIGHTING OF NIGHT WORK
(INCANDESCENT GLOBES)
Intermediate sizes can be calculated by taking pro-rata, figures, e.g., if the
available power is 40% more than the nearest size shown, then the area
that can be lighted will be 40% greater.
Figures are based on the constant output of the generating set, not the tem-
porary peak rating, and presume proper distribution of the lights.
NOTE. —The above figures are based on the use of ordinary incandescent
globes with reasonable reflectors. Where mercury vapour, sodium vapour,
arc lights, etc., are used, the total area that can he lighted will increase as
follows:
Mercury Vapour .. 2 x above areas.
Sodium Vapour .. 3 x above areas.
Arc Lights .. .. Efficiency varies according to the carbons used, etc,
but a safe conservative basis is: J x above areas.

SOME COMMON HINTS ON CONCRETE
AGGREGATES
The main requirements in the selection of material to be added to cement
to form concrete is that it must be clean and inert. Concrete, however,
cannot be stronger than the material with which it is made, nor will it be
more durable or weatherproof.
If concrete is to be strong and everlasting to keep out weather, and to be
fire resistant, it must be made of materials that have these properties. If
concrete is to be light in weight, light-weight aggregates must be used. If
a concrete is wanted that will reduce the passage through it of heat and
cold, an.aggregate and mixture that will produce a concrete with this specia
property must be used.
The aggregate must, therefore, be selected to give the kind of concrete
required.
Apart from being sure that the aggregate selected is the best procurable to
produce the kind of concrete required, the most important point to remember
about aggregates is that they must be CLEAN and uniform in size.
DIFFERENT TYPES OF AGGREGATES
In this country, the most common aggregates used in the making of con-
crete are: River gravel or crushed basalt, commonly known as blue metal,
together with river or pit sand. In constructional work the requirements
are strength, durability and water-tightness. These properties are present
in the above materials, and a specification for constructional work would
probably specify either of them as the aggregate to be used; concrete made
with these materials weighs about 140 lbs. per cubic ft.
Concrete for work of minor importance can be made with such materials as
broken bricks, broken sandstone, clinker and breeze, but again we emphasise
the fact that the resulting concrete will be only as strong and durable as
the materials of which it Is composed.
Concrete with special properties, such as insulation, light weight, etc., can
be made from pumice, foamed slag, sawdust and wood-wool, but caution
must be used in the use of these materials, which is really a specialised process
and should be left to people specialising in concrete of such nature.
USUAL PROPORTIONS
For ordinary work concrete in the proportion of I part of cement, 2 parts
of sand, and 4 parts of coarse aggregate is suitable. For work that must
be watertight, or where extra strength is required, the mix should be 1 part
cement, IJ parts sand, and 3 parts of coarse aggregate. For work of minor
importance, a mix of I part of cement to 3 parts sand and 6 parts.of coarse
aggregate is sufficient. Richer or leaner mixtures may be specified, but the
three mixes mentioned are suitable for all normal purposes.

STRENGTHS OF DIFFERENT PROPORTIONS
In ordinary good-class concrete, the following strengths may be expected
with different proportions of cement to aggregates, assuming the materials
and processes are the same in all cases. The figures are the crushing strengths
at 28 days after placing the concrete made with ordinary Portland cement,
ballast and sand :
Where special precautions are taken to control the quality of concrete,
these strengths can be considerably exceeded.
THE USE OF WATER IN CONCRETE
A good rule to follow is to use no more water than is necessary to place
and compact the concrete in position.
In foundations and floor slabs, a stiff mix may be used and rammed into position.
In thin walls, columns and beams, or where there is closely spaced reinforce-
ments, a wetter mix is necessary to enable it to be properly consolidated,
but it must be remembered that the more water,that is added the weaker
will be the concrete unless the cement content is increased.
How seriously the strength of concrete is affected by difference in water
content is shown by the following results of crushing tests on cubes made
with ordinary Portland cement and varying quantities of water:
It will be seen that when the water was doubled, the strength was reduced
two-fifths, or nearly half. More than half the cement in the wettest mix
could have been saved, because concrete of the same strength could have
been made with half as much cement if the water content had been halved.
In other words, for every pound of water left out of the wet mixture a pound
of cement would have been saved without reducing the strength of the
concrete.
Another reason why excess water makes weak concrete is that all the mixing
water ultimately dries out and its place is occupied by air, with the consequent
lack of density.

VIBRATOR PRACTICE AND
USAGE
AS RECOMMENDED FOR “ALLAN” TYPES P.F. AND E.F
INTERNAL VIBRATORS
The following recommendations are to be taken as a rough guide only, as
so man/ factors vary, due to local conditions on the site.
MIX
If a fairly wet mix is normally used, it is advisable to reduce the water content
,when the Vibrator is used. We do not recommend a slump of more than
2", or in special cases up to 3". This reduction in the water content results
in a higher quality concrete if the proportions of the aggregate remains
unaltered. If an improvement in quality is not desirable, a leaner mix may
be used. The sand content can also be somewhat reduced.
FORMS
It is not necessary to alter the type or size of the forms usually used, as the
Internal Vibrator does not displace the form work at all. It is advisable, how-
ever, to have the forms tight, so that there is no seepage of mortar —for this
reason forms made from tongued and grooved timber are preferable.
PLACING THE CONCRETE
The thickness of the layer should not, as a general rule, greatly exceed the
length of the vibrating unit in use, as it is not possible for the air to escape
if large masses of concrete are placed at one time. If possible, every batch
of concrete should be placed in its final position and should be vibrated in
its place. Vibration should not normally be used to move the concrete
from one place to another. If it is necessary to fill the concrete from one side
only, the Vibrator could be used to distribute the concrete, but this should
only be done as long as absolutely necessary. It is better to give every batch
of concrete in its final place the same amount of useful vibration.
VIBRATING TIME
This depends on several factors, such as the size and shape of the aggregate,
the proportions, the water content, the thickness of the batch, the rein-
forcement, etc. Generally speaking, however, we would recommend that
with our size “S” General-Purpose Vibrating Unit, provided the slump is
not more than 2", vibration should be carried out for 20 to 30 seconds at each
place, and this should be quite sufficient. The maximum consolidation is
obtained when the majority of the air is expelled, and this is indicated when
a little mortar appears at the sides and on the top. Further vibration at this

stage is quite unnecessary and does not improve the concrete, and if pro-
longed vibration is used, might cause a tendency to separation.
METHOD OF WORKING
The efficiency of these Vibrators is very high. The area affected by the
vibration depends on the local conditions and on the site of the unit. The
three different sizes of units have different ranges, viz., the effective range
of the “S” 2£" diam. vibrating unit is approximately 36" diam. It is therefore
quite sufficient to place this Vibrator in the concrete about every 2ft. apart.
It is not difficult to find the effective range of the Vibrator providing a stiff
mix is used. If the Vibrator is inserted into the concrete a certain area
round the unit becomes fluid and gives under pressure of the foot, whereas
outside the range of the Vibrator the concrete does not yield under pressure
even if the vibration is distinctly felt. The Vibrator should be inserted to the
full depth of each layer and withdrawn slowly, so that the hole caused by
the Vibrator is filled up with concrete by the vibration. Another method
is to pull the Vibrator slowly at about an angle of 45 deg. in such a manner
that the whole of the concrete obtains the necessary amount of vibration.
The use of this method, of course, depends on the placing of the reinforcement.
We particularly wish to stress that the P.F, and E.F. Vibrators are internal
types and for use in the concrete mass itself. They must not be used to
vibrate moulds or forms, nor to vibrate the reinforcement, and should be
kept away from direct contact with moulds or reinforcement as much as
possible. If the Vibrator is held against the reinforcement it is liable to
damage the machine, and there is, of course, a possibility of displacing the
rods. It is necessary, however, to vibrate as closely as possible to the mould
or form in order to expel air bu bbles and thus give the con crete a good fi n ish.
INTERCHANGE OF VIBRATING UNITS
The three sizes can be easily interchanged. Size “S” 2j" diam. x 17" long
unit is recommended for all general purposes. Size “R” l-j" diam. x 19"
ong unit is available for thin sections and close reinforcement. Sire “T”
3-i-" diam. x 12" long unit is best for mass concrete.
ADVANTAGES
Since high-frequency vibration makes It possible to place and consolidate a
concrete with low water/cement ratio, and a stiffen and harsher consistency,
there is marked improvement in:
Compressive Strength. —Bond between layers of concrete.
Flexural Strength. —Bond between concrete and reinforcement.
Density. —Shrinkage.
Uniformity. —Resistance to freezing and thawing.
Impermeability. —Resistance to chemical attack.
Absorption. —Resistance to sea erosion.
