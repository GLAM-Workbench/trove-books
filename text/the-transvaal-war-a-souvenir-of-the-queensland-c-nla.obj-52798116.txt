From Queensland to South Africa.
"SOLDIERS OF THE QUEEN."
N EVENT unparalleled in the history of Queensland was celebrated on Wednesday, the
ist of November, 1899, when the first detachment of troops ever raised in the colony for
act -> v e service left Brisbane in the steamer “ Cornwall ”to take part in the Imperial
liybjLfj campaign in South Africa against the Boers of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State.
As soon as it became apparent that war must be declared between England and the
£ Boers, the Premier of Queensland (the Hnn. J. R. Dickson), Parliament being then in
recess, took the responsibility upon himself of offering the services of a small body of mounted troops
from the colony's Defence Force. The offer was graciously accepted, with the proviso that the troops
must leave for the scat of war not later than the end of October, and pending Parliamentary sanction
steps were at once taken to prepare for the equipment and transport of a contingent of 250 Mounted
Infantry. The Legislature having, after some delay, passed the necessary vote, a camp was formed
at Meeandah, near the Government w r harves at Pinkenba, into which volunteers were passed for
medical inspection, those whose services were accepted being retained in the camp for organisation.
A few days sufficed to obtain the number of men required, and preparations were hurried forward for
the embarkation on the steamer “Cornwall” (Captain Barter, R.N.R.), which had been chartered by
the Government for the purpose. The contingent consists of 14 officers and 25C rank and file, with
about 300 horses, in command of Lieut.-Colonel P. R. Ricardo, Q.M.1., who takes the rank of Major
for the time being, the Imperial Government having stipulated that no officer of higher rank should
be sent with the troops.
Sunday,the 29th of October, was fixed uponasthe day of departure, butit soon became apparent
that the preparations could not be completed in the short time available. Finally the event was post-
poned to Wednesday afternoon, which gave an opportunity for compliance with the generally expressed
public desire that a special parade and review should be held. The ceremonial took place on Satur-
day afternoon, the 28th of October, and the occasion was one to be long remembered by residents of
Brisbane. The main streets, which were decorated with flags and greenery, were thronged by many
thousands of people; and as the contingent rode through Queen and George Streets to the Domain
they were greeted with enthusiastic cheers all along the line of route. Arrived at the Domain, the
troops were reviewed by his Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor (Sir Samuel Griffith), after which
they returned to camp, to issue again an houror two later to attend a grand banquet in the Exhibition
Building, given in their honour by the citizens of Brisbane. The scene at the banquet was
unparalleled j the guests were received with a spontaneous outburst of enthusiasm, and the large
audience, as the band and the great organ struck up the popular air “Soldiers of the Queen,” joined
in by singing the words with all the vigour of which they were capable.
Sunday was a day of days in the camp, thousands seizing the opportunity to have a last chat with
their friends among the contingent. Work was out of the question, and after “church parade” the
troops were dismissed and allowed a free hour or two. On Monday morning, however, the stern
business of preparation was resumed with energy, and soon after mid-day on Wednesday the last horse
had been shipped, and the contingent marched down to the wharf and on board the “Cornwall” amid
the cheers of the immense crowd who had assembled to see the last of “our boys.” The farewell was
inspiring yet affecting. All Brisbane seemed to have gathered at the river side, and as the men filed
across the gangway the vast concourse, accompanied by the : military bands, sang with the heartiest
accord “Soldiers of the Queen.” As long as the boat lay alongside the wharf the bands continued
to play various martial airs, and when the “Cornwall” moved out into the stream the sweet strains of
“Auld Lang Syne”brought moisture to many of the eager eyes that watched the departure of Queens-
land’s modest contribution to the great Imperial Army which is to uphold in South Africa the honour
and supremacy of the nation on whose territory the sun never sets.
