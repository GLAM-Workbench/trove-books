foreword
The history of St. John’s, Avoca, herein given is as com-
plete as existing records will allow. Great care has been taken
to use only authentic information. I trust that the reading of
it will give as much pleasure as the writing gave. I wish to
thank the “Avoca Mail” for the use of their files and others
for the supplying of information. My thanks are also due to
Mr. A. G. Lalor for reading the manuscript.

History of the Parish of Avoca
m HE early history of the Church in Avoca is bound up
I with that of the Diocese of Melbourne and has its
I setting in the gold-digging days when the history of
J L the State was being written by the pioneers. Bishop
Charles Perry visited the Township at the invitation
of the settlers. They asked that services might be commenced
and this the Bishop promised, providing the residents did their
part. They were to build a Vicarage and also a Church, and
when this was done a Priest would be sent to them. On the
26th of June, 1856, the block of land in High Street, next to
the “Free Press” Office, was granted by purchase for church
building purposes. The title deeds are now in the possession
of Mrs. Walters of Homebush, and it is interesting to note
that they were signed by Major General Edward McArthur as
Senior Military Officer commanding the Land Forces in the
Colony of Victoria.
Upon this land the first Church was built in the year
1857, and the Reverend W. Mcjennett was called to the cure
of souls. A picture of this Church is to be found below. As a
result of the inexperience of the early settlers in the matter of
building, the Church only stood for a matter of eleven years.
The roof was too heavy for the walls and it was soon con-

demned for the purposes of public worship. Prior to this a
Vicarage had also been built on the banks of the Avoca River.
At this time the dwelling places of the settlers were simply
calico tents. It was in 1856 that Avoca had its second gold
rush, and in 1859 the surrounding districts were expanding
for the same reason. In the next four years the gold was not
so easily found and as a consequence the rushes in other parts
took away many people, amongst whom were the black sheep
who followed the gleam of gold. In Avoca habits became
more ordinary and settled, and soon what was a goldfield of
no mean order was gradually changed into an agricultural
district. With these changes came the Borough Council, and
it is interesting to note that Mr. Wm. Goodshaw, one of the
pioneers of St. John’s Church, was also a member of the
Council. By 1866 the population had dropped to 2000 and
with this drop came further difficulties in the way of building
a new Church. Archdeacon Stretch, of Geelong, was a fre-

REV. E. K. YEATMAN, M.A., 1865-1876.
quent visitor to the Parish in the early days. In 1867 definite
steps were taken towards the erection of a permanent Church.
Liberal sums were subscribed locally for that purpose, and the
first of a series of tea-meetings was held on the 2nd of March.
Archdeacon Stretch was present and he made a sterling appeal
for assistance in the new cause and pleaded for systematic
giving. He gave a slogan which he said was of Wesleyan
origin : “Repentance, justification by faith ; a penny a week
and a shilling a quarter.” The ladies assisting at this time,
and their names are mentioned that we might know who the
earl}- churchworkers were, were Mesdamcs Woodward, Sweet,
Reed. Worsley, Griffiths, Yeatman, Smith, Allanson, Ogilby,
Constable, Carr, Manson, and the Misses Carr. An interesting
part of this meeting was the display of plans and specifications
of the new- Church building.
On April sth, 1867, Bishop Perry made his second visit to
Avoca. It was on this date that Confirmation was first admin-
istered in this Parish.
At this time the Press was severely criticising the lax
feeling of Church people towards the question of the new
building. Bishco Perry addressed the congregation in the
Shire Hall. After giving a summary of the history of the
Church in Victoria during the nineteen years of his Episco-
pate, and contrasting the work in England and Australia, he
spoke about the position in Avoca. He said he had kept his

promise of some ten or twelve years ago and had sent a clergy-
man to them, and they had built their parsonage and school,
but their promise to build a Church had not been fulfilled. He
thought the evidence of the increased wealth and prosperity
since his first visit was not finding its parallel in the life of
the Church. He considered that Avoca would be entitled to
£l5O per year for two years from the Government grant in
aid. Mr. Ogilby responded on behalf of the congregation and
he said that he hoped that the method adopted of showing
their appreciation of the Bishop’s visit would take the form of
more substantial financial assistance in the future.
The “ Avoca Mail ” of the 4th of May, 1867, has an inter-
esting announcement to the effect that a very handsome silver
Communion set, ordered and procured from England by the
Committee of St. John’s Church, Avoca. is on view at Mr.
C. K. Pearson’s in High Street. The service is of the Camden
pattern and is of chaste design and high artistic finish, and is
well worthy of the inspection of those interested in the pro-
gress of art in the Old Country.
On the 28th of September the Vestry passed a resolution
advocating the erection of a new Church at a cost of £IOOO.
The work of preparation was put in hand immediately, for on
the 19th of October Mr. Terry, the architect, exhibited fresh
plans before the members of the Church. These were
approved of, and it was decided to have specifications drawn

up and tenders called. The first site mentioned for the Church
was that upon which the temporary school house then stood.
Tenders for the setting down of the foundations were
advertised on the 18th of April, 1868. On the 20th of June
Messrs. Wm. Goodshaw, Leonard Worsley and John Wilt-
shire ware appointed trustees of the land set apart and pur-
chased *r Church of England purposes, in the place of Mr.
G. A. Amos (deceased) and Mr. G. W. Wise, who had re-
signed. This land is that at present held and upon which the
Church now stands. Tenders were also called for the building
of the Chancel and Vestry, but nothing was done in the matter
at that time.
A bazaar was held on the 23rd of November. All the
shops in the town were closed that day. The stall-holders
were: Mesdames Yeatman, G. Wise, Holland, Sweet, Reed,
Gazzard, and McMahon, the Misses K. and M. Wise, Maun-
ders, Holland, and Knott; also Mesdames Travenna, Kiehl,
Misses Trevithick, E. Trevenna, Reed, and Hart. In opening
proceedings, Mr. Ogilbv said the building fund to date stood
at £3OO. For the three days £175 was made clear, and this
brought the building fund up to £475. The beginning of the
difficulties of the Church are noticed when on the 13th of


REV. W. H. GEER, 1896-1904.
EEV. C. J. T. MARTIN, 1904-1910.
March, 1869, the Vestry reluctantly announced that they
would not in future be able to guarantee the same amount of
stipend as formerly. On the Ist of May tenders were again
called for the erection in whole or in part of the Church. On
the 31st of July the “ Mail ” had the following note: “ We are
glad to notice that the trustees of the Church of England are
giving tangible proof of their determination to erect a struc-
ture worthy of the theme and the needs of the times. Already
the foundation stones of the new Church are being laid, and
in the course of six months it is expected that the whole build-
ing will be completed. The sum in hand to meet the contracts
is little short of £SOO. This will be supplemented by a like
sum from the Church Building Fund. The whole cost of the
building will exceed £1.200, but there need be no fear enter-
tained that the whole will not be collected. The Church when
finished will be a very handsome structure; the site, a gentle
eminence behind the Wesleyan Church, is a most admirable
one, far superior to that one upon which the building now
used for Church purposes is erected.”
Che foundation stone was laid on the 21st of October.
1869. The following is an extract from the current Press:
“ The old building familiarly known as the Church of England
has for a long time been all but condemned; indeed, it has
been considered unsafe for public use. From time to time
absolutely necessary repairs and improvements have been


carried out. The realisation of hopes now crowns the labours
of several years. The old Church had been in existence for
about thirteen years and was built of brick, the clay being
taken from a pit on the Fiddlers’ Creek Road. Its weakness
was want of support in the walls and too wide and heavy a
roof. From the inside, because of these things, the appearance
was far from comfortable.”
Previous to commencing the ceremony of the day a short
service was held in the existing Church building, which
included the Litany and some appropriate hymns, after which
the congregation and several of the inhabitants and visitors
proceeded to the new site and ranged themselves round the
apparatus fixed for the laying of the stone.
’There is no definite indication of where the stone is to be
found, for no inscription was placed upon it. But a considera-
tion of certain facts and a careful examination of the
foundations leave little doubt as to the actual location of the
stone. In the newspaper accounts of the ceremony it says:
“The foundation or corner stone was laid.” An examination
of the four corner stones reveals that three corners have their
base made up of three or more stones forming the square; the
fourth, however, is one stone about 4 feet square. From this
it seems safe to assume that the corner stone or foundation
stone is that to be seen on the south-west extremity of the
Church, on the right of the main entrance.

CANON S. O. SEWARD, 1926-1930.
After the Reverend E. K. Yeatman had offered up prayer
suitable for the occasion, the Venerable Archdeacon Crawford
proceeded with the ceremony. In a cavity of the stone was
placed a large glass jar, in which was deposited the memorial
scroll, engrossed on parchment, which was previously read by
L. Worsley, Esq., and was to the following effect: —
“ In the Name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy
Ghost.” The Foundation Stone of this Church, to be called The
Church of St. John the Divine, in the Parish of Avoca, in the
Diocese of Melbourne, in the Colony of Victoria, was laid by
the Venerable Archdeacon Crawford, M.A., of Trinity College,
Dublin, Archdeacon of Castlemaine, on the twenty-first day
of October, in the year of Our Lord One thousand eight
hundred and sixty-nine, being the thirty-third year of the
reign of Her Most Gracious Majesty of Great Britain and
Ireland. His Excellency, Sir John Henry Thomas Manners

The Archdeacon then declared the stone to be well and
truly laid, and applied the level, mortar, and trowel, striking
the stone three times in the true emblematic fashion.
Mr. Leslie Ogilby, of Avoca, and Mr. Scott, of Amherst,
then addressed the gathering.

The Archdeacon, using metaphors, compared Religion
with the building of a sacred edifice, God is the Architect,
the Ministers of Religion are the contractors, and all those
who labour in the great cause are the workmen. The Rever-
end E. K. Yeatman spoke in unmistakable terms of the diffi-
culties with which they had to contend in the carrying out of
the object that day attained.
The day was concluded by the holding of a concert in the
Shire Hall in the evening.
The gross results of the bazaar held on the 13th of
November amounted to £275.
The Bishop of Melbourne made his third visit to Avoca
on the 17th of April, 1870, and again administered the Sacra-
ment of Confirmation,
On the 21st of May the first instalment of £277/19/- was
received from the State Aid Fund towards Church Building.
The grant of £3OO from the Church Loan Fund is also said to
be assured, so this would leave the amount required to pay
building contracts at £145. It was hoped that this amount
would soon be raised.
On the 17th of September Mr. John Bacon was appointed
to represent the Church of England on the School Board in
connection with the Common Schools.
During the year 1870 spirited correspondence appeared in
the local papers debating the truth and error of the Anglican

Doctrine of Apostolic Succession. This was carried on by
the Reverend E. K. Yeatman and Mr. Nicholson of the
Methodist Church. The matter only terminated when Mr.
Nicholson was transferred elsewhere.
Another bazaar was held from the Ist to the 4th of
November, and the following is a press report of the proceed-
ings^
“ It is well known that many and great difficulties have
beset the building of this Church from a variety of causes,
impossible to foresee and not a little disheartening; but
through the untiring perseverance of the Reverend E. K.
Yeatman, aided by the constant efforts of the Committee and
the ladies, the good end may be said to be now' achieved, for
the amount taken has been considerable, and considering the
almost unparalleled dullness of trade and the depression in
mining matters hereabout, we may add astonishing.
“ Prominent among the lady workers were Mesdames
Yeatman, Worsley, Paton, Holland, Sweet, Allanson, Smith,
Whitley, Bostock, and Atkinson, and the Misses Bacon,
Reed, MacDonald, Mann, M. Wise, M. Trevenna, Woods,
Hart, Varley, and Stowe. Mr. Carr, P.M., who had promised
to open the bazaar, was unavoidably absent. This duty was
performed by the Vicar, assisted by Mr. Cooke. The total
takings for the four days amounted to £177/16/1, and as the
expenses only amounted to £l9/1/7, the nett profits were
£l5B/14/6.”


GIRLS’ FRIENDLY SOCIETY, 1931.
In 1871 a Sunday School Library was commenced and
many useful books distributed among the children.
On the 22nd of April a meeting was held at Homebush
to arrange for the erection of a united Anglican and Presby-
terian Church at Homebush. Messrs. Pyman, Fitch, and
Burns were appointed to represent the Anglican congrega-
tion there. The sum of £75 collected by Miss Agnew was
handed to this Committee.
So many Chinese were living in the district that a Chinese
Catechist was appointed to assist the Vicar in his work, and
at various times converts were brought into the Church and
admitted publicly. Mr. Matthew Ah Get was the Catechist.
A Mission Chapel was opened at the rear of Wise’s store at
Percy dale.
An interesting matter was dealt with by the Vestry on
the 12th of August, 1871, when special arrangements had to
be made to provide for the guarantee of the Vicar’s stipend,
owing to the fact that State aid to religious bodies was shortly
to be discontinued.
Tenders were called for the fencing of the Church grounds
and the opening date of the Church was fixed for Sunday,
December 3rd, 1871. Again we reprint an extract from the
“ Avoca Mail ” :
“ The old Church of England—popularly so called—had
been for a long time considered unsafe, as well as being in-
sufficient in its accommodation; and hence the Reverend E. K.


INTERIOR OF ST. JOHN'S CHURCH.
Yeatman, the Incumbent, made up his mind that there should
be a new building; and how well he and the Trustees, and,
indeed, all concerned, have carried out their by no means easy
task, many know, but every one should know as well who
takes an interest in the matter; and who does not? A grant of
land was obtained, comprising two acres, and exertions set on
foot in the most energetic manner to bring about the desired
end. The ladies, as is always the case, lent their ready sym-
pathy to the good and righteous cause, and bazaars were held,
subscriptions set on foot, and now, after a lapse of a compara-
tively short time, the good end has been achieved. Finis
coronat opus, and we have a handsome structure pleasing to
the eye in its purely Gothic proportions, the first service in
which will be held on Sunday, 3rd of December, the Venerable
the Archdeacon of Castlemaine officiating; and on Monday a
tea-meeting will be held in the Shire Hall, which all are invited
to attend for the good of the Church fund. This is a pleas-
ing epoch in Avoca’s history, and speaks more plainly of its
ethical —that, is, moral—pregress than all the statistics relat-
ing to the population or gold returns could supply. While
speaking thus in favour of the work itself, it is right we should
give some details which cannot fail to prove interesting. The
foundation stone, as previously mentioned, was laid by the
Archdeacon of Castlemaine. The Trustees were Messrs. J.
Batchelor, W. Goodshaw, L. Worsley, and J. Wiltshire. The
plans and working drawings were prepared by Leonard Terry,


ST. JOHN’S LADIES’ GUILD, 1931.
Esq., of Melbourne, the architect in connection with the
Episcopalian Church Establishment in the Colony. On receipt
of these, tenders were called for, and the work now completed
commenced on an admirable site overlooking the town from
the eastward, giving to the structure a bold and commanding
appearance. As we have said, the Church building now com-
pleted is excellent in its workmanship throughout. The con-
tractors for the foundations were Messrs. Lang, Opie and
McDonald; those for the brickwork, Messrs. Green Bros.; for
the roofing and carpenters’ work, Mr. W. Atkinson; for
the internal fittings, Mr. Classen; and to the skilful hands of
Mr. Kitchen has been entrusted the decorative part of the
work —all the above being of Avoca. The building is 60 feet
long by a width of 28 feet; the height from floor to inside
ridge of the roof being 40 feet, the pitch of the roof springing
from 16 feet. The sittings are capable of accommodating 200
persons. We were particularly struck with the beauty of Mr.
Classen’s fittings, as well as their substantial character; and
the pulpit, reading desk, communion railings and panels are
really admirable—better workmanship could not be seen in any
other part of the world, and that is saying a great deal. The
fittings are of Richmond River cedar, a wood of peculiar beauty
and richness of grain, while designs are alike plain and strik-
ing to the eye. The altar railing in quartre foiled panels, with
its delicate colouring of dark blue and gold, is in pleasing and
proper contrast with wood-work. This pretty style of quartre
foile is shown also on the panels of the pulpit and reading


desk, with an appropriate depth of moulding. The west win-
dow is in divisions of lancet shape, and is fitted with stained
glass in beautiful kaleidoscopic panes, and the side windows
are of frosted glass, traced with a small intersecting diamond
pattern. There is a campanile on the western gable for two
bells. It is intended to erect a Chancel and Vestry in the
course of time. The cost of the building as it at present
stands is £1,900. It should be also mentioned that Mr. J.
Griffiths, Engineer of the Avoca Shire, has from time to time
kindly made honorary inspections of the works. The Church
is dedicated to the patronage of St. John the Divine. Services
were held in the morning, afternoon and evening, the Arch-
deacon preaching in the morning and evening and the Vicar in
the afternoon. A hymn specially written by Mr. C. F. Weston
was sung by the choir. The hymn is as follows:
A house, O Lord, we raise
And dedicate to Thee,
A house for prayer and praise
To Thy great majesty;
To Thee Who giveth all, we give
A house in which Thy Name may live.
Accept our offering, Lord,
Within this Temple dwell
A God by all adored,
Who doeth all things well;
Accept the gift we humbly make,
Accept it for the Saviour’s sake.
Be it the constant aim
Of all who worship here
To glorify Thy Name
And Thy commands revere,
With holy works and songs of praise
To all the measure of their days.
Thy blessing now afford
The work our hands have wrought,
Give profit to Thy Word
When in this Temple taught,
And lead us all, O God of Love,
To worship in Thy realms above.”
The actual service of dedication and opening is left to our
imagination.
The next day a tea-meeting was held in the Shire Hall,
and this was followed by a concert. A massed choir from all
denominations, under the able baton of Miss Varley, added
greatly to the enjoyment of the evening, the first anthem being
very appropriately chosen was “ Praise Ye the Lord.” The


chairman said this was the happiest moment of his life, and
he felt very deeply the real sympathy and help given by all
denominations. Everything had been successful in connection
with the new Church and the efforts of the well-wishers of it
had been blessed in a most remarkable manner. Mr. Grainger
then sang “ The Pilgrim Fathers.” This was followed by the
anthem, “ The Lord is in His Holy Temple.” The Reverend
George Mathers, of the Presbyterian Church, then addressed
those assembled. The anthem, “ Blessed are the People,” was
also sung. The Reverend Ralph Brown, of the Methodist
Church, said he wished the work of the Church of England
“ God speed.” He referred to the common foe of all the
Churches as that to be met by the artillery of the Episcopal-
ian Church, the infantry of the Presbyterians with its solid
squares, and the cavalry of the Methodists. All would fight
under the same standard. Mr. Ah Get, the Chinese Mission-
ary, told the story of his conversion to Christianity. Other
speakers were the Reverend Radcliffe of Lake Learmonth,
Reverend Povnder of Dunollv, Mr. Goodshaw, Mr. W. M.
Wise, and Mr. Cooke. £65 was set aside to augment the
Building Fund as a result of that day’s effort.
The first organ used in the Church was purchased at a
cost of £SO, and the whole of this money was raised by the
men through concert parties and organised by Mr. Bryant.
During the Incumbency of the Reverend J. A. Ball the
debt on the Church was reduced to £25. The Reverend C. W.
Houlbrook, M.A., of Cambridge, relieved Mr. Ball for a few
months. The debt was finally liquidated in the year 1881.
In 1876 the Reverend Joseph C. Clampett was locum
tenens for five months and during that time he endeared him-
self to all. An illuminated address was presented to him
prior to his leaving for the Goulburn Diocese.
Mr. T. C. Sproston, who came to Avoca in the year 1858,
was for many years a Lay Reader in the Parish and took
services in the outlying districts. He was also a member of
the Vestry, which position he filled till his death in 1899. The
scroll which runs the whole length of the Church beneath the
roof was painted by Mr. Sproston’s father, the Reverend
George Sproston, Vicar of Trimdom, England.
A branch of the Girls’ Friendly Society was started in
Avoca in the year 1884 with Mrs. H. W. Carter and Miss
Bacon as Associates, Miss Bacon also being secretary until
her death in 1894.
In 1876 Mr. Magee trenched the ground on either side of
the Church and planted trees free of cost.
The Reverend E. K. Yeatman resigned this year, and the
Vestry, on behalf of the parishioners, presented him with
some articles of silver plate. The Rev. J. Norton followed


Mr. Yeatman, but only remained in the Parish for a few
months. The Reverend J. A. Ball subsequently took his place
in 1877.
In the year 1881 the old Common School was purchased
from the Education Department at a nominal price of £5 and
the land for £sl. The old Church which had been the place
of worship of the early settlers was sold to Mr. Gilbert for
£IOO in the year 1881.
In recognition of the services of Mr. Goodshaw to the
Church, extending over many years, Archdeacon Julius, on
behalf of the congregation of St. John’s, made him a presen-
tation when he left the district in 1889.
Further additions were made to the Church in 1890 in the
form of a vestry.
The Church was finally consecrated by Bishop Thornton,
of Ballarat, on the 18th of October, 1893. In addressing the
churchpeople the Bishop took as his text the words from Gen.
xxviii., verses 21 and 22, “ The Lord shall be my God, and
this stone which I have set up for a pillar will be God’s
House.” The Reverend J. A. Ball was at that time Vicar.
Amongst the visitors were the Reverends C. Harris, S.
McGeorge, H. F. Barker and A. Brown.
Mr. Ball took his departure for Casterton in the year
1894 and was followed by the Reverend J. E. May, who only
stayed a few months. In 1896 the Reverend W. H. Geer was
instituted as Vicar. Mr. Geer was one of the pioneer Priests
of the Ballarat Diocese, giving thirty years of faithful minis-
try.
On the 29th of August, 1900, the Church lost by death one
of the most earnest of Church workers in the person of Miss
Sweet. For twenty years she presided at the organ. Some
time later a memorial window was placed in the Church to
her memory. Two years later Mr. M. M. Wise died, and he
was greatly missed. In 1904 Mrs. Sweet entered into her rest
after forty years of beautiful service as Sunday School teacher
and choir member.
Mr. Geer left Avoca for Mildura on the 15th of March,
1904, and was followed by the Reverend C. J. T. Martin,
whose work at Redbank will ever stand as a memorial to his
labours.
The second organ to be used in the Church was pur-
chased for £2B in 1904.
Before the days of electric light the Church was lit up by
acetylene gas, the installation of which cost £36/10/-, the
work being done by Mr. Hempseed.
The early Vicars of the Parish lived in a Vicarage on the
western banks of the Avoca River, but in 1917 it was con-
sidered that a change should be made that they may reside
closer to the House of God. During the Incumbency of the


ST. JOHN’S VESTRY, 1931.
Reverend Canon Reynolds the present house was purchased
and the old one sold.
A Central Council was formed in the year 1918, consist-
ing of representatives from all parts of the Parish.
Amongst the active workers in the Church of the past we
must mention Mr. J. Spelman, who consistently gave his time
in Sunday School teaching and Lay Reading over many years.
Also mention must be made of Mr. Magee, and Mr. J.
Chambers, who is at present in Melbourne and is kindly
working very hard in making a success of the Diamond
Jubilee. The Reverend Geo. Downton, whose work as a
Missionary in New Guinea will long be remembered, was
brought up in this Church.
One whose photo is shown herewith and is with us still
is Mr. A. G. Lalor. It is impossible to say how much he has
done in connection with the Church that he loves, but for
thirty-one years he has been a member of the Vestry and
almost all that time a Churchwarden. He holds the record as


far as Lay Reading is concerned, extending over the thirty-
one years. Mr. A. M. Comins spent thirty-six years in the
Sunday School, many of those years being Superintendent.

office, but amongst those who have served lengthy terms as
Secretary or Treasurer are: Wm. Goodshaw, M. M. Wise,
W. P. Gilbert, F. J. Sweet, F. G. Wise, J. Chambers, E. C.
Dottle, and A. G. Lalor. Mr. H. B. Worthington is the Sec-
retary at the present time. Mr. W. H. Carter was Secretary,
Lay Reader and Sunday School Superintendent for man)'
years.
Memorials which have been placed in the Church include
the stained glass window depicting St. Cecilia, subscribed for
by the congregation to perpetuate the memory of Nellie Sweet,
for twenty-two years organist. The beautiful reredos, a
memorial to the soldiers who served in the Great War, was
erected at the east end of the Church and is supplemented by
an honour board at the west end given by Mr. Downton. The
hymn board is also to the memory of Miss Sweet. The psalm
board was erected to the memory of Mr. Wm. Whitley from
a bequest left by him. The stained glass window depicting
the Good Shepherd was placed in position by the family of
the late Mr. and Mrs. Francis Sweet in memory of their father
and mother. The credence table was given by Mr. H. F.
Classen in memory of his wife. A mural tablet on the south
wall erected to the memory of Mr. and Mrs. Sproston by
the family. The alms dish was given in the memory of Mr.
T. Pym, who was killed during the Great War. The sanctuary
carpet was given by the G.F.S. The altar vases were given by


the Communicants’ Guild. The altar cross was a gift from
Mr. J. Deeble. The lectern was the gift of Mr. H. F. Classen.
The altar cruets were given by Mrs. T. Smith. The gates at
the entrance to the Church grounds were erected to.the mem-

The present Vestry is made up of the following: —Dr.
Colquhoun, Messrs. James Clarke, Robt. Kave, A. Kaye, L.
Barker, H. J. Chapman, H. B. Worthington, W. Morris. S.
Sproston, A. Astburv, J. Shaw, A. G. Ealor. Mr. A. G. Lalor
is the Vicar’s Warden and Messrs. A. Kaye and Robt. Kaye
are the Wardens representing the congregation.
Mr. and Mrs. Fitch were the first to be married in the new
Church, and Miss Goodshaw was the first to be baptised.
No history of St. John’s would be complete without
special mention being made of the care and love that Mr. H. F.
Classen has lavished upon it. For many years he has taken a
keen interest in the interior fittings and at times adding there-
to, taking care to preserve those things so well made by his
father.
Miss Mackereth is at present working on a very beautiful
crochet edging for the fair linen cloth. This work has required
about 4000 hours to complete and proves to be a work of art.
There are two organisations at present in existence that
have earned the appreciation of all Church people. The first
is the Ladies’ Guild, who meet once a month and during the
last few years have added considerably to the finances of the
Church as well as acting as hostesses and sponsors of definite
Church movements from time to time. Mrs. Lalor (Presi-
dent), Mrs. Shaw (Treasurer), and Mrs. Worthington
(Secretary) are prominent in this work and numerous others
gladly give their assistance. The Girls’ Friendly Society is
doing good work amongst the girls. They, too, have been of
material assistance to the Vestry. Miss Hempseed is the
Secretary, and is assisted by Mesdames Shaw, Lalor, Worth-
ington, Kaye and Clarke.
Miss Isaacs is the present organist and is assisted by Miss
Beryl Walker.
Moonambel
The first Church services were held in a galvanised build-
ing standing near the existing site. The building was also
used as a school. It had an earth floor. In 1878 the present
building was erected, the contract price being £7O/11/6 for
the woodwork, £44/10/- for the brick and stonework, and
£25/11/- for the painting. The old building was sold to Mr.
Balmer for £ls/10/-. The Church was opened by the Bishop
of Ballarat on March the 9th, 1879. A bazaar held in 1880 on

behalf of the building fund realised £7B/8/8. Twelve seats
were purchased at a cost of 30/- each. The bricks used in the
construction of the building were given by Mr. Dal. Adams,
who was at that time Secretary and Treasurer. The first
Committee was comprised of the following: Messrs. T. Crick,
Junr., E. G. Glover, R. I. Wilson, I. Borbidge, I. T. B. Wills.
The first organ was purchased at a cost of £2B. Mr. D.
Williams was elected to the Committee in 1886. Mr. Murdoch
occupied the position of Secretary upon the resignation of Mr.
Beaumont in 1887. In the same year Messrs. Miles, Bonsor,
Holmes and Bannister were appointed to the Committee.
Messrs. Greene and Borbidge were made members of the
Committee in the following year. Amongst the ladies who
assisted in Church matters in the early days were Mesdames
Greens, Murdoch, Howard, Wiseman, the Misses Ada and
Emily Stockman and S. Greene. Many enjoyable and in-
structive evenings have been held in the Church, when
illustrated lectures of great interest were given by Archdeacon
Julius, Archdeacon Tucker, and the Reverend J. E. F. May.
Tea-meetings were important social functions and, indeed,
were of material assistance to Church funds. The following
served on Committees in various vears: Messrs. C. Coughlan,
E. H. Noske, G. Peacock, S. Anderson, D. Forbes, J. Worth-
ington, W. Crick, Geo. Dunnell, Henry Moyle, T. Ward, A.
Williams, and F. Date. Miss Moyle has been organist for the


past twenty-six years and has given much faithful service in
the great cause. Mesdames Stewart and Dunnell have spent
many years in the Sunday School. Former organists were
Mrs. Madson and Mrs. Knight. The Jubilee celebrations,
held about three years ago, were attended by over 250 people.
The following gifts have been made to the Church, many of
of them being memorials: Communion service, presented by
Mrs. Stockman in memory of her husband, Mr. H. T. Stock-
man ; altar, presented by Mrs. Stockman in memory of her
daughter, Mrs. Chas. Murdoch, as was also the brass altar
cross; reredos, presented by Mrs. E. Moyle and Mrs. A. L.

plates were given by the Ladies’ Guild; the missal stand and
sanctuary chair were Jubilee gifts; the oak hymn board was
presented by Mr. H. F. Classen; the organ stool was presented
by Mr. and Mrs. A. Worthington. Mr. J. Kofoed has for
many years been Secretary of the Church and is still doing
good work.
Elmhurst
In 1871 the only services held at Elmhurst were those
provided by the Presbyterian Church, and were held in a
wooden building on the banks of the Wimmera River on the
property of Mr. Ransom. The building was also used as a
school for some years. About the year 1879 a movement was
made among the residents to have a Church erected for the
combined worship of the Anglicans and Presbyterians. Sub-
stantial help was given by the late Dr. Williamson. In due
course the necessary funds were subscribed and the contract
was let to Skellett Bros, of Glenpatrick, under the supervision
of Mr. William Atkinson of Avoca. The first Anglican Min-
ister to officiate was the Reverend Phillip Holman, who was
the Vicar at Ararat for fifty years. lie was assisted by the
Reverend Mr. McCormack. The Reverend Geo. McMurray
followed Mr. McCormack. The following Priests supplied
services at various times: The Reverend McGeorge, the Rev-
erend Davis, the Reverend Beveridge, the Reverend Noltenius,
and the Reverend M. C. James, now Bishop of St. Arnaud.


ELMHURST CHURCH.
After many years attached to the Ararat Parish it was trans-
ferred to the Avoca Parish. In the year 1880 the late Dr.
Williamson had erected the stained glass window in the
sanctuary in memory of his father and mother, who were in
possession of DeCameron Station for many years and who
were always liberal supporters of the Church. The reading
desk is a memorial to the memory of the Venerable Arch-
deacon Peacock, who at one time was Curate at Ararat. The
first Sunday School was opened and carried on by Messrs.
Jas. and John Wise, the former being Superintendent for
twenty-four years. Right from the opening of the Church
the foundation stone of which was laid in 1882, Mr. Jas. Wise
was Secretary of the Church, in all a period of something like
thirty years. Mr. W. Kaye is the present Secretary, and Mrs.
Kaye Organist.
Amphitheatre
The Church was built as a Presbyterian Church in 1862,
and it was not till the year 1865 that the Anglicans were in-
vited to hold Divine Service there. During those sixty-six
years the spirit of unity manifested between the two congre-
gations is a matter for congratulation and joy. Nearly thirty

years ago Mr. H. Spiers out of his own money had built the
Sunday School, where much good work has been done by
many teachers. It is to be noted that Mr. T. Ennis spent
thirty-four years as Superintendent in the school and his son,
William, has taken up the work laid down by his father. The
Quayle family and the Spiers have been well represented
among the workers throughout the history of the Church.
The stable was built out of funds provided for that purpose
by Mr. J. Webster. Thirty years ago the building had to be
extended another 12 feet to provide for the growing congrega-
tion. Mrs. Howell presided over the organ for ten years
and only gave it up owing to ill-health. Mrs. Joseph Quayle,
Mrs. Annie Spiers, Mrs. C. W. Quayle, Mrs. Ennis, Mrs. Le
Levre and Miss Howell have also proved themselves to be
faithful organists. Mr. Le Levre is at present Sunday School
Superintendent and is doing splendid work among the chil-
dren. The communion table was a gift from the Howell
family and in memory of Mrs. Lusby. The hymn board is
also a memorial to Mrs. Lusby and is the gift of her husband,
Mr. Jack Lusby. The communion service was provided by
several members of the congregation shortly after the Church
was erected.


ST. PAUL’S CHURCH, REDBANK—OPENING DAY.
Redbank
The first recollections of Church life in Redbank is con-
nected with spring carts that regularly plied their way
between Redbank and Monambel on Sunday mornings that
their occupants might attend Divine Service. The first Angli-
can services were held in the Methodist Church and afterwards
in the Mechanics’ Institute. Nearly twenty-five years ago
the first move towards building a Church was made during
the Vicariate of the Reverend C. J. T. Martin. The land was
purchased from Mr. Gibson, who at some time previous had
been a school-teacher in the district. He sold the land for £3,
this being half its value at that time. To start the work the
Streeter family cut the blocks and delivered them on the
ground. A great deal of work was done by working bees.
Some of those who helped in the work are still attending the
Church, amongst whom are the Burges, Streeters, Coates,
Egans, Hills and Potters. Mr. YV. Wolf carted out most of
the timber free of charge. Mr. J. Willett was the contractor.
The contract price of £175 would in these days be considered
as very low. It seems as though the Reverend C. J. T. Martin
was providentially sent here at this time. Not only did he
draw the plans and supervise the whole of the work of the
building, but he also made the furniture for the sanctuary, in-


HOLY TRINITY CHURCH, TANWOOD.
eluding altar, prayer desk, communion rails and lectern; he
provided the material required for this purpose. The frontals
and hangings were the work of Mrs. Martin. The two chairs
and the organ stool were given by Mr. Streeter. The first
Bible was presented by the British and Foreign Bible Society.
The Church was opened on Wednesday, the 16th of December,
1908, by the Venerable Archdeacon Tucker of Ballarat, who
has just recently resigned from the office of Dean of Ballarat.
To the joy of all concerned the building was opened free of
debt. Tea was supplied after the service in the Church
grounds, and the day closed with a social in the Mechanics’
Institute. Since that time an altar cross has been presented
by Messrs. A. and T. Burge, and bookmarkers by Mr. C.
Scott. A Bible was presented by the congregation through
Mr. Martin to Mr. John Egan, the first Church Secretary, for
the very fine work that he did in connection with the Church.
Mr. F. 11. Egan, his son, carried on the work and the secre-
taryship is still in the Egan family. The following have taken
a keen interest in Church work at Redbank at various times:
Messrs. Biney, G. Voss, Glenister, John Egan, Fleming, C. H.
Smith, Joseph Romey, Coates, Hall, and Mesdames Roe and
Hipwell. The following have held the position of organist:
Mrs. Taylor, Mrs. Dyall, Miss Roe, Miss R. Burge, Mrs. J.


Romey, Mrs. Gus. Potter, Mrs. Streeter, Miss E. Burge, Miss
Miss F. Burge and Miss Barnes. It is hoped before long to
complete the Church building by adding a vestry and sanctu-
ary.
Tanwood
This Church was at one time in use at the gold diggings
at Percydale, but when the population dwindled it was moved
to its present site. This was done in the time when Canon
Reynolds was Vicar. Messrs. A. and D. Williams have proved
themselves earnest workers in the cause there, along with
Mrs. Anderson and Messrs. Miles, Hardy, Streeter, Argal,
Morris and Barnes. Mr. Argal, assisted by Miss Williams,
has done much good work in the Sunday School. Miss
Williams has furnished the altar with altar linen of her own
work.
