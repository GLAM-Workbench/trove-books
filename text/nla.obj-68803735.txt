THE GEOLOGY,
During a former residence in this country, I
was induced to visit Hunter?s River, to which my
journey was made by sea, and from which I re-
turned in the same way; but the vessel being
forced to put into Broken Bay, I walked across to
Port Jackson.
The line ot coast presents in general an aspect
of bold perpendicular cliffs of sand-stone, lying in
horizontal strata. These cliffs, however, are oc-
casionally interrupted by sandy beaches, behind
which the country is low and flat, the high land
appearing to retire considerably. On a near in-
spection, these spaces, now occupied by sandy
beaches, seem, at no very remote period, to have
formed the entrance of bays and arms of the sea.
In many places they are even now so partially
filled up, that we still find extensive salt-water


lagoons, separated from the ocean only by a bank
of sand, through which the water yet occasionally
forces a passage. The strata of sand-stone consist
of beds lying one upon the other in the most regular
manner, so that they have evidently never under-
gone any deviation from their original relative
situation. It is true that the beds are not in-
variably strictly horizontal, but this arises perhaps
from a gentle yielding of the substrata. Some of
these beds, although perfectly horizontal, and of
regular thickness, consist of thin laminae, which
incline at a considerable angle to the north-east.
This sand-stone may generally be called silicious.
It is rarely argillaceous, chiefly in this state over
coal: it is then soft and very decomposeable. Among
the coal metals we occasionally meet thin beds of
what may be called calcareous sand-stone.
The country immediately to the south of Hunter?s
River is (as is well known) an extensive coal-field.
The cliff's on the sea-shore present a most interest-
r
ing section of the coal-field strata. There in one
*>
day more information may be obtained, than in
other places in many years. I traced the strata
for nine miles, when they abruptly terminated by


suddenly bending downwards, and sinking below
the level of the sea. From this place a long
sandy beach and low land extend to the entrance
of Lake Macquarie (called also Read?s Mistake).
The south head of Lake Macquarie rises into high
cliffs, in which the coal strata again present them-
selves. Dr. Hutton would have given much for a
single day?s walk along this shore. Here we see
at one glance the progress of some of the most
interesting operations of nature ?the work of many
ages. It appears as if the crust of the earth had
been broken, and a bold and regular section forced
upwards, and presented to our examination. Be-
tween the coal-beds we find strata of sand-stone
and beds of slate-clay with vegetable impressions;
sometimes (but more rarely) indurated clay-stone.
Embedded in these strata, there is found abund-
ance of argillaceous iron ore. This is occasionally
cellular and in layers; but for the most part it
?
appears in the form of petrifactions of trees and
branches, irregularly dispersed. Near the southern
termination of the coal-field (that is, where I have
mentioned its sinking beneath the level of the sea),
two large beds gradually approach, and at length


meet. They do not, however, incorporate, but run
parallel; and at this place there is a mass of highly
indurated pudding-stone, which reaches from the
surface of the coal to the top of the clilf. The
coal-cliff' abruptly terminates at the entrance of
Hunter?s River, then forming what is called coal-
head. On the north side of the river, a sandy
beach and low land extend to the vicinity of Port
Stevens.
The coal is decidedly of vegetable origin: the
fibre of the wood is often quite distinct.
The vegetable impressions in the slate-clay under
and over the coal are no less worthy of an at-
tentive consideration. I have seen some of these
subterranean plants in full flower, so that a skilful
botanist might ascertain even their species. I
think that I have been able distinctly to recognise
the leaf of the zamia spiralis.
Upon the whole, what I now advance consists of
mere hints, thrown out to induce some adequately
scientific person fully to investigate this very curi-
ous and untrodden field.
I afterwards found, by examining the ravines,
that the sand-stone strata extended from the sea-


coast to the river Nepean on the west. In many
of these ravines I found indications of coal, viz.
coal-field schistus with vegetable impressions, argil-
laceous iron ore, the same calcareous stone formerly
indicated, and even fragments of coal. Through
that extent of country, the sand-stone seems to
spread like a level platform; and although the
country rises in hills and ridges, these seem to
consist of a mass of clay, the surface of which has
been worn into inequalities by the action of water.
Consequently the higher portions, which contain
most of the original soil, are more fertile than the
bottoms of the valleys, unless these have been
covered by alluvial depositions. This clay is ge-
nerally at the surface red, and impregnated with
iron: in some places, however, it is white and
saponaceous, appearing under the form of beautiful
pipe-clay ; and I have seen this white clay contain
nodules of calcareous stones resembling stalactites,
and evidently formed by aqueous deposition. At
the depth of a few feet it generally assumes the
appearance of schistus, impregnated with sulphate
of alumina and sulphate of iron.
Beyond the Nepean River the sand-stone strata


are forced upwards, and extend from north to south,
forming the range of hills known in the colony
by the name of the Blue Mountains. Towards
the north shore, these mountains are sterile and
rugged. Towards the south, however, the sand-
stone is in many places covered or displaced by
whinstone, which sometimes assumes the form of
common, at other times of porphyritic, trapp. In
the latter state it shows itself throughout the ver-
dant, well-watered, and very desirable pastoral di-
strict of Argyleshire. In this county, wherever the
soil lies upon sand-stone, we find it consisting of
the common Australian clay. Over the whin-
stone, again, it invariably consists of light black
mould. On advancing further to the south, both
granite and primitive lime-stone are found. I have
however seen neither, and am therefore unable to
speak more fully on the subject.
As I have lately had an opportunity of examining
some parts of the coast, as far south as Mount
Dromedary, I shall annex a short account of such
further observations as I have been able to make.
It was Lieutenant Johnston?s and my first in-
tention to have entered Shoal Haven River. We


found it, however, opening into the sea through a
sandy beach, and with a chain of breakers across
the entrance, in the same manner as when it was
examined several years ago by Mr. Oxley. We
therefore stood towards the little haven three miles
to the southward. A low sandy beach extends
from the river to Shoal Haven. There is, however,
a high rocky point on the south side of the en-
trance; and this protects the little passage from
the southerly winds, and prevents it from being
filled up.
This high land extends some miles along the
coast, and is at length terminated by a shoal lagoon.
It consists of sand-stone lying upon indurated blue
slate-clay, covered with the usual Australian soil.
I almost think it was originally a barrier island
to an extensive bay behind, now occupied by low
alluvial land. At high water this place seems at
first of some consideration, being rather extensive,
and presenting many arms. At other times it
seems merely a collection of mud banks, the tops
of which are covered with mangroves, and with
shallow channels. At the top of one of the arms,
it is separated from Shoal Haven River by a narrow


isthmus, not two hundred and fifty yards broad,
and across this we hauled the boat to examine the
river.
The land at the back of Shoal Haven, and south
of the river, is low and swampy, so as in some
places to be incapable of producing trees. There
is, however, a more elevated border along the im-
mediate bank of the river. Behind this it sinks
into a lagoon, which seems, at no distant period, to
have been the bed, or at least a channel or branch,
of the river, then opening into Shoal Haven. In-
deed even now it is hardly elevated above the level
of the sea at high water. At a distance of about
eight miles from the sea, the shores of the river
become high, and consist of perpendicular sand-
stone cliffs. This appeared to be the original
mouth, which formerly discharged itself into a large
bay, sheltered by an island. This bay is now filled
up, and presents the appearance of low alluvial
land, swamps, and lagoons.
We went up the river more than twenty miles,
when we were stopped by a long rapid. At this
place the river might be about one hundred and
fifty yards wide, and was flowing perhaps double


that distance over small, rounded, water-worn stones,
which it hardly covered. The tide flows thus far,
which may be considered the termination of the
inland navigation. For some distance below, the
alternate projecting points consist of alluvial land.
They are, however, of small extent, often bounded
behind by the steep precipices, which formed the
ancient shore of the river, and seem, from the marks
left by the floods, exposed to dangerous inundations.
I ascended one of the cliffs near this place. The
sandstone was little compact, hardly fit for the pur-
poses of building, and although it did not entirely
resemble pudding-stone, still it consisted of, or at
least contained, the fragments of older rocks, viz.
lumps of quartz, fragments of primitive clay-slate,
&c. Here I collected some alum, almost pure,
which had oozed from the crevices of the strata.
At the season of the year when we visited Shoal
Haven River (January), we found the water hardly
fresh, a few miles below the rapid, and indeed the
upper part of the river more resembled a long
lagoon than any thing else, having little current,
and a very inconsiderable rise and fall of tide.


Not finding a convenient watering-place in Shoal
Haven, we put into Jervis?s Bay, and anchored
under the shelter of Bowen Island, where we readily
supplied ourselves. I found that the heads of Jer-
vis?s Bay and Bowen Island consisted of the same
horizontal strata of sand-stone observed in other
places. However, as we entered late in the even-
ing, and went out early next morning, I had hardly
an opportunity of making further observations at
that time.
On leaving Jervis?s Bay we proceeded to the
southward, and in the course of the forenoon en-
tered with our boat a small opening beyond the
deep bay, south of St. George?s Head. We found
the entrance defended by a reef, under which small
craft might receive shelter. At this time there
was a depth of four feet at low water over the bar.
The inlet runs in a northerly direction, and ter-
minates at the distance of about five miles, in a
large salt lagoon, which lies to the south and west
of Jervis?s Bay. The shores of the inlet are ge-
nerally low, and are either sandy or swampy. Near
the lagoon, however, on the western side, there is


forest land. The creek, through its whole extent,
seems separated from the sea merely by a sandy
flat of recent formation.
The same afternoon we attempted to enter an
opening to the north of a point of land, lying
nearly east of the Pigeon House, and which was
described to us by the natives as the entrance of a
river. We were glad, however, to return in safety,
without effecting our purpose, after having the boat
nearly filled in attempting to pass the bar. After
this we proceeded direct to Bateman Bay, which
we entered in the evening, and came to an anchor
late at night under Snapper Island. Next day I
proceeded up the river Clyde, in company with
Lieutenant Johnston, its discoverer. The general
appearance of the river agrees very well with his
description. He was, however, surprised to find it
quite salt, in situations where he had found, on his
former visit, about a month before, excellent fresh
water. (It was then very rainy weather.) At a
short distance below' what he calls the first rapid,
the river was fresh, and most likely will continue
so about that place at all seasons. At this place,
however, the navigation ceases, and we could only


proceed a few miles further in the boat at high
water. Thus far the direction of the river is
northerly, with an inclination to west: the fresh-
water run, however, comes chiefly from the south-
ward. Throughout, the river winds in a beautiful
manner among the hills, which slope gradually to
the water?s edge. These hills are moderately
wooded. The white gum (eucalyptus )is
the most prevalent. Generally the soil is rather
barren, and is covered with low ferns, prickly
shrubs, and a kind of dwarf palm, called hurra-
wang by the natives (zamia spiralis). As we ad-
vance up the river, the alternate projecting points,
on either side, consist of rich alluvial soil, but are
of small extent. The general course, as I have
said, of the river, or rather inlet, is northerly with
an inclination to west, and it ceases to be navi-
gable about ten miles south of the hill called the
Pigeon House. None of the supposed branches
are of any moment, being merely salt-water inlets,
which terminate at a short distance among man-
groves. It is barely possible that some of them may
have a small run of fresh water at their heads.
t
Fresh water is scarce at the lower part of the river.


Indeed we found merely one small spring, and that
was not only indifferent, but below high-water
mark. The river itself is free from shoals, but is
rendered comparatively useless, from a bank at the
entrance, over which there is only ten feet of water.
Snapper Island may afford shelter for a few small
vessels.
At the spot where the river ceases to be navi-
gable, (accompanied by Mr. Hume and Thomas
Davison) I took a journey of four days into the
interior, with a view to examine the country. Ge-
nerally we found it very hilly, consisting of steep
ridges, divided by narrow valleys, so narrow indeed
that they frequently ought rather to be called
ravines. They are, however, very rich, and ge-
nerally well watered, overgrown with tall ferns
(Alices), fern trees (alsophila australis), palms (co-
rypha australis, and seaforthia elegans), stately
mimosas, and magnificent flooded gums (eucalyptus
). The sides of the hills are too steep for
the plough, but the soil is well adapted to the cul-
ture of the vine. We did not find a piece of good
pasture, or what is called good forest land, in the
whole district.


The geological character of the country is dif-
ferent from those parts of New South Wales which
1 had formerly examined. The only rock consists
of a kind of coarse argillaceous schistus, containing
mica, of various appearances, resembling, at Snap-
per Island, imperfect clay-slate, but in most other
places assuming the appearance of grey wacke. It
lies in a vertical position, and the strata extend from
south-west to north-east. I found that it equally
traverses the bed of the river and the summit of
lofty ridges, and contains innumerable veins of
quartz of all dimensions. On travelling towards
the westward, we found the ridges gradually to
ascend, and at length the summits were topt with
sand-stone. v My visit did not admit of accurate
observation; but so far as I was able to judge,
these ridges seemed first to rise to the level of, and
then to rest like abutments against, the table-land
of Argyleshire. On descending, which we did by
following the course of a ravine, we again found
the old rock; but although it still followed the
same line of bearing, its character appeared to
change. It was hardened into compact clay-stone,
and the veins were more twisted, as if it had been


)ftened by the action of intense heat, and in many
places the quartz assumed the form of agate or rock
flint. Following the course of the ravine, it brought
us to a small river ten or twelve miles west ot the
Pigeon House, in the bed of which we found masses
resembling clay, porphyry, and jasper. This river
led us to the foot of the Pigeon House, which we
ascended. There is first a steep ridge, formed of
the schistus already mentioned, but more abound-
ing in mica?(indeed I found some specimens of
almost pure mica slate). At the top of the ridge
there is a lofty terrace of pudding-stone. The
country upon this assumes the form of table-land,
and the soil is a poor clay, covered with stunted
bushes. The cone of the Pigeon House rises upon
this plain. It consists of horizontal sand-stone,
and the dome, which crowns the whole, consists of
enormous masses of the same material. At the
foot of the cone we found a run of water. Actual
observation can alone determine the point, but I
considered from appearances that we had here at-
tained the level of Argyleshire. On descending
from the Pigeon House, we again crossed the river
1 have before mentioned, now become a considerable


stream, and flowing slowly to the eastward through
a rich valley; but at this place it seemed affected
by the tides. From hence we regained the Clyde,
and rejoined our vessel.
On leaving Bateman Bay, we proceeded with the
vessel about twenty miles to the southward; and
on our return attempted to enter an opening which
is indicated in the chart about seven or eight miles
to the southward of the bay. Here, however, was
such a fall of tide, as rendered it at that time to-
tally impracticable. We therefore landed outside
on a point, and walked across, when we found the
water extending among the hills in the shape of a
salt lagoon. We passed a night at anchor under
the small island at the entrance of Bateman Bay,
which is capable of affording shelter to small ves-
sels from easterly winds.
The outer island of Bateman Bay is of the same
formation as Snapper Island, consisting of an im-
perfect clay-slate of a blue colour with white layers.
These white layers are generally in a state of de-
composition, but the blue part is highly indurated,
and the strata are twisted in all directions; so that
it is impossible to describe them. They appear


as if they had been exposed to intense heat. The
shores of the bay, on the contrary, consist of a soft
red clay-stone, lying, as was said, in a vertical
position, which gradually gets more indurated as
we advance up the river, and at length assumes
the form of grey-wacke slate.
Our progress was delayed by southerly winds,
and I had a better opportunity of examining the
appearance of the coast on our return than before.
We now succeeded in entering the mouth of the
river which we had crossed at the foot of the
Pigeon-house. The banks are alluvial, beyond
which there is some tolerable forest-land. We
could only proceed upwards for about four or five
miles, when our further progress was stopped by
large trees lying across the bed of the river. Were
these impediments removed, I think it would be
navigable for boats to the foot of the mountain.
About four miles to the northward we entered
another opening. Most of the prominent inlets
along the coast are on the north side of rocky
points. This, however, was on the south side of
a point of whinstone. The entrance was very
shallow; but at a distance of several miles, we


%
found deep water surrounded by high land, show-
ing us the process of filling up an ancient harbour.
A few miles to the northward of Bateman Bay,
the vertical strata disappear, and are succeeded by
horizontal sand-stone, which continues with inter-
ruptions to Jervis?s Bay. These interruptions con-
sist of long sandy branches and projecting points
of whin. I landed on several places, under the
shelter of those points, and walked for miles along
the shore. I found the country uniformly fertile
and well-watered, wherever the basis consisted of
this rock. I was not inclined at the time to at-
? ?�
tribute this formation to a volcanic origin, even
although I found plenty of pumice-stone lying
upon the beach, because as this had evidently been
thrown up by the water, it might have floated
from New Zealand; but, on further reflection, I
cannot help thinking that these points are of ig-
nious formation, or rather that the matter of which
they are formed has been projected from under the
sand-stone in a liquid state.
We again entered Jervis?s Bay, where we were
detained several days by unfavourable winds, so
that I had an opportunity of examining many


parts of it. Although it receives no rivers, we
found fresh water in abundance at the driest sea-
son of the year. On the north side, the soil is
low, sandy, or swampy, and in many other places
indifferent. I found however good land, both forest
and alluvial. The access to the bay is safe and
easy; and although it is not such a magnificent
harbour as Port Jackson, still it affords good shelter
and safe anchorage, and is superior to many of the
best frequented ports in the world. The port of
Cadiz, which has been renowned from the earliest
ages, is not to be compared to it; and in the pro-
gress of colonization, there is no doubt it will here-
after be the seat of an important settlement.
I shall now conclude with a few general ob-
servations, chiefly arising from the foregoing facts.
Ist. The extent of country, to which I have
adverted, is bounded on the west by a range of
high land, generally at some distance from the sea-
shore, which, however, advances to the very coast
to the southward of Port Hacking, when it forms
what is called the Five Island or Illawarra Moun-
tain; but which, on reaching the northern bank of
Shoal Haven River, again recedes to the westward.


2d. This range bounds the waters or rivers which
fall into the sea on the eastern coast.
3d. These rivers do not flow direct to the coast,
but a great part of their course is parallel with it,
running to the north?witness the Clyde*, Pigeon-
house, Nepean, and George?s River. Has this
course any connexion with the extensive vertical
strata which I found extending to, the north-east
at Bateman Bay, and which seem to form the basis
of the country ?
4th. The rivers seem progressively to increase
in magnitude as we advance northerly; thus, Clyde,
Pigeon-house, Shoal Haven, Nepean, Hunter?s
River, and, I believe, the Hastings may be added
to the climax t. George?s River, indeed, which is
hemmed in by the Nepean, is less than Shoal Ha-
ven ; but its course is also northerly.
5 th. A clay soil, having little attraction for
moisture, is the general characteristic of this part
of the country. The absence of springs depends
upon the impermeable quality of the soil; and the
* The salt water inlet of the Clyde runs northerly, but the
fresh water runs chiefly from the southward.

scarcity of running water is caused equally by this,
and by the shape of the country.
6th. One of the most celebrated English agri-
culturists has remarked that the softest fleeces are
produced from sheep depasturing on a clay soil.
This not only corresponds with the past experience
of New Holland, but gives great hopes for the
future.
Much has been written about the geography of
plants. Equal attention ought to be given to the
soils which they delight to inhabit. This is not
the place for such discussions. Still, as being in-
timately connected with my present subject, and
so important, that there can be no successful culti-
vation of exportable commodities in this colony
without attention to it, I cannot conclude without
adverting to it.
The plants produced on our clay soil contain
generally little or no alkaline salt, perhaps because
/
it does not exist in the soil. Tobacco abounds in
alkaline salt. It is not therefore proper for such
soils, and, although the plant will vegetate in them,
its quality must be inferior. The clay soil is
equally unfitted for the vine, because the roots will


penetrate to the aluminous schistus, which will
either poison the plant, or communicate an inferior
flavour to the grape. Again, the vine will grow
luxuriantly in the mere alluvial soil, and the fruit
will be large, but the juices watery. The truth of
these remarks is beautifully exemplified by this
country in a state of nature, where in the midst of
iron-bound gum-tree forests, we meet with circum-
scribed spaces, in which plants of a different de-
scription are growing with tropical luxuriance.
%
As this country is so peculiar, and has so many
i
apparent disadvantages in the midst of some seem-
ing advantages, it becomes our duty to improve
the latter, and to obviate the former. It is there-
fore perhaps happy that its colonization has been
deferred until the present time, when the sum of
human knowledge, both moral and physical, is so
extended, that these attempts may be made upon
just and rational principles, the result of which
may be expected to be very different from such as
originate in mere experiment, or (what is still
worse) from such as are the offspring of a false
theory.
