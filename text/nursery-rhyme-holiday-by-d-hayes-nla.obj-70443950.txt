?I?M THE MAN-IN-THE-MOON. I WANT TO KNOW THE WAY
TO NORWICH.?
lay in bed cuddling her newest baby doll. She
should have been asleep, but the moon was shining
brightly through the window.
It had been her fifth birthday, and five, thought Susan,
is an important age nearly old enough to go to school. Sud-
denly she heard someone say, "Pardon me, can you tell me the
the way to Norwich??
Susan sat up in bed and asked who was there.
"I?m the Man-in-the-Moon, and want to know the way
to Norwich,? said the voice.
"I?m sorry, but I don?t know where it is,? replied Susan.


"And/' asked the Moon,
?Why does the cow jump over the moon.''
Why doesn't it walk below ? 4
And why does the dish run away with the spoon ?
That's what I'd like to know?" .
44 Well," said Susan, 44 That?s what they always do in the
Nursery Rhyme Book.?
?But why do they do it?" said the Moon, still puzzled.
44 That?s what I?d like to knowt May I sit on the window-
sill for awhile and think?"
44 Certainly," said Susan, 44 but don't fall off."
?Of course I won't," and the Moon sounded cross; ?I?m not
like Humpty-Dumpty.?
?Who is talking about me?" called a cracked voice from
outside in the garden.
?I am," said the Moon, turning to look. ?You?re Humpty-
Dumpty who had a great fall, aren?t you ?"
?But I?ll soon be all right," was the answer. 44 I?m just
waiting for the King?s horses and the King's men to put me
together again."
Then the Moon began to sing,
?Humpty-Dumpty has fallen again,
But soon he'll be feeling quite well,
For all the King?s horses and all the King?s men
Will push him back into his shell."
??No, no!??cried Susan. ?The Nursery Rhyme book says
all the King?s horses and all the King?s men could not put
Humpty-Dumpty together again."

?YOU?RE HUMPTY-DUMPTY WHO HAD A GREAT FALL,
AREN?T YOU??
?What! Never at all?" sobbed Humpty-Dumpty.
?Well,? said Susan, doubtfully, ?if they used a spoon
perhaps they could. But eggs are very flippy things, you know.?
?Nobody has ever called me ?flippy' before,? sobbed Humpty,
?and I do want to go back into my nice white shell.?
The Moon gave an impatient grunt. ?You see, Susan,?
he said, ?Little Boy Blue, Jack Horner and Mother Hubbard,
are all unhappy. They talk to me at night when you're asleep.?
?What do they want?? asked Susan.
?I don't know,? said the Moon,
?Little Jack Horner there in the corner,
Why does he sit all day ?
If he were really a very good boy
He?d run outside and play.?


?But I AM a good boy/' cried Jack Horner, coming out
from the corner where he had been eating his Christmas pie.
He was a funny little fellow dressed in bright red trousers
with a blue coat. He also had a peaked hat of green.
?I'm tired of sitting still, that's all. I?m fed up!?? he said.
?With Christmas pie??? teased the Moon.
?I want to run outside and play? answered Jack Horner.
?Well,? said Susan, why don?t you?? At these words Jack
Horner stared in astonishment. Then he gave a cry of delight.
?Good! And can Miss Muffet come with me? She?s tired
of sitting still too,? he said.
When Miss Muffet heard her name she stood up, with her
bowl of curds and whey in her hand.
?Can I really go, Susan? Really, truly?? she asked.
Susan nodded and smiled. ?Yes, if you wish to go.
The Moon was just helping them out of the window when
he stopped in surprise.
?Ho, ho! Look who?s coming in now. Wait a minute, Miss
Muffet,? and he leaned out and pulled in two very tired-looking
people. Susan immediately recognised them.
?Why, Jack and Jill! Where have you been?? she asked.
?Up the hill and down the hill,? whispered two weary
little voices.
?But why do you make so many trips?? asked the Moon.
?Because we?ve always done it,? said Jack and Jill.

?THEY TALK TO ME AT NIGHT WHEN YOU?RE ASLEEP."


The Moon then sang a little song,
?When Jack and Jill go up the hill
They get tired as tired can be,
If they have fetched two buckets of water
Why do they want to fetch three??
?In the Nursery Rhyme Book,? said Susan, ?they always
go up the hill and Jack falls down and breaks his crown and
Jill comes tumbling after.?
?My poor head does ache,? said Jack.
?You're lucky,? Jill said to Miss Muffet, ?you can sit down
all day.?
?But I want to run about,? said Miss Muffet.
?So do I,? said Jack Horner.
?You see, Susan,? said the Moon, ?they are not contented.
They all want to do something different.?
Susan began to feel sorry for them.
?We want to do something, different,? cried the four
together.
?What you need,? said Susan,"is a holiday.?
?Aholiday?? they echoed. ?What is a holiday??
?Doing something different, something nice, for a change,?
she told them. ?If all the other Nursery Rhyme people want
a holiday it will be a big job for me.?
?Never mind,? said the Moon, ?I'll help you.?
?Well,? said Susan, ?these four are easy to fix. Jack and Jill
want to sit still, and Jack Horner and Miss Muffet want to
run about!?

?CAN MISS MUFFET COME WITH ME?? HE ASKED
?Goody-goody!" cried the two Jacks and Jill and Muffie.
Susan laughed happily. "Go on, Jill, sit down there on that
tuffet and eat Muffle's curds and whey. That's right. And you.
Muffie, take hold of the bucket and go off with Jack Horner.
You can run up and down the hill and get as many buckets of
water as you like."
The Moon held out his hand and helped Miss Muffet and
Jack Horner through the window. In a few minutes they could
be heard laughing and talking as they ran about joyfully, while
a voice outside began to sing.
?Boys and girls come out to play,
The moon doth shine as bright as day.?
Already Jill sat on the tuffet. Jack, with the Christmas, pie
on his knees pulled out a plum, and said, ?What a good boy
am II"

?Xhere you are Susan,? said the Moon. You ve made four
people happy. That?s a good start.?
?I wonder who?ll be next,? said Susan, and a dozen voices
cried together, ?Me! Me! Me!?
A crowd of little people ran towards her across the bedroom
carpet. There were Boy Blue, Bo Peep, Mother Hubbard, Simple
Simon, and lots of others.
?Tin the first,? said the Old-Woman-Who-Lived-in-a-Shoc.
?If you please, Susan, I really should be first because I have so
many children. Unless I can get another home for them I don t
know what to do.?
?You have a very big family, ?began Susan ... but the Old
Woman commenced singing,
?MY POOR HEAD ACHES,? SAID JACK


?Oh, dearie me, what shall I do?
So many children all in one shoe;
Some dressed in pink, some wearing blue,
All their clothes old, nothing is new.
If I had a shilling I?d buy a warm coat,
And I'd very much rather live in a boat.?
Why,? asked Susan, ?do you want to live in a boat ??
- ?So that the children can learn to swim,? the Old Woman
replied. ?A shoe is a very dusty kind of house to live in, not at
all pretty either.?
?Perhaps the Noah's Ark is empty,? suggested the Moon.
?Yes, it is!? cried Susan joyfully. ?The animals have gone
to the Zoo to live.?
?Then into the Ark she goes!? cried the Moon.
?Mee-to! Mee-to!? whined a voice which reminded Susan
of her tabby cat when it was hungry.
?I don?t want any cats in the Ark,? said the Old Woman,
?especially a cat with a fiddle.?
?I'll play you a merry tune,? purred the cat.
?No, you can't go,? said Susan. ?Cats don't like water, and
the Ark is a boat, you know. It floats on water.?
?I want to float,? meowed the Cat, ?truuul-y I do
truuuuly I do!? ,
?Nonsense!? answered Susan.
?I'll bring my friend the Cow,? continued the Cat. ?She's
a very clever Cow. She jumps over the Moon, and will give
you lots of nice milk. And I'll bring the Dish and the Spoon,
too, if you'll let me come.?
?Now that?s an idea,? said the Old Woman. ?Another dish
and spoon would be very handy.?
?I'll play with the children,? continued the Cat; ?I love
children.?


?I?M THE FIRST," SAID THE OLD-WOMAN-WHO-UVED-IN-A-SHOE
So it was settled, and they were just collecting all the
children for the Ark when they heard a little dog barking. It
was such a happy, laughing kind of bark that the Moon said
in a sing-song voice.
?The little dog laughed to see such sport. ..?
The Old Woman looked at the little dog for a moment, then
said, ?All right, you can come if you don't tease the Cat. . . .
Along you go, all of you."
When they had all gone Susan smiled up at the Moon and
said, ?Aren?t they funny ? Such lots and lots of children, too!"
?Dear me," sighed the Moon, ?I forgot to ask her the way
to'Norwich.?"
?Ask Simple Simon! He might not be as silly as he looks,"
said Susan.
?I?m not silly at all," said Simple Simon. ?Just because J
wanted to buy something from the pieman and had no penny,
everybody thinks I?m silly. I know a lot of things that


clever people don?t think of.
"Maybe,? said the Moon, "but I bet you don?t know the
way to Norwich.?
"I just do!? answered Simple Simon, and puffed out his
chest and tried to look important. He was so thin and so tall
that it only made him look funnier than ever.
"You turn to the left, then to the right, then to the left,
then to the right ... .? began Simon.
"But Simon,? said Susan, "where do you start from??
"It doesn?t matter where you start from. You turn to the
left then right, then left, then right...? went on Simon.
"Oh, stop!? said the Moon. "That?s nonsense.?
"Who told you to go that way, Simon?? asked Susan.
"The pieman. And he should know,? answered Simon. "He
is a clever business man and sells pies. I met him going to the
Fair. And I said, 'Where is the Fair?' and he said, ?At Norwich'.
? I?LL?VLf v -YOU A MERRY TUNE,? PURRED THE CAT


?I MET THE PIEMAN GOING TO THE FAIR/?
So I walked along the road a long way until I met some soldiers.
And I asked them the way to Norwich, and they said Left-
right-left-right-left-right'." *
At that Susan laughed and laughed. Oh, Simon .. . You
ARE simple! That's the way soldiers march."
The Moon looked disappointed. ?Til never find out," he
sighed.
?I?m sorry," said Simon, for he really wanted to help. Then
he saw Mother Hubbard and called out to her, "Please Mother
Hubbard! Do you know the way to Norwich?"
An old woman dressed in a long frock, apron and a frilly
cap came towards them, leaning on a stick.
"Good evening sir," she said respectfully to the Moon. Then
she bobbed and curtsied to Susan, "And to you, Miss.... Yes, to
be sure, I know the way to Norwich. My dog and I were there
only yesterday."


?Can you go there by candle light?? asked Simple Simon.
?Hush,? whispered Susan. ?You forget the Moon does not
like candlelight.?
Mother Hubbard began to trace a road with her stick on
the carpet, and spoke in sing-song voice,
?You walk in the night and run in the day.
It?s over the hills and far away,?
?And I would like to live there,? she sighed.
?I?ve heard it is a very nice place,? said the Moon, ?but why
do you want to live there ??
?There is a lovely butcher's shop at Norwich!? answered
Mother Hubbard. ?My dog could have a big bone every day.
The cupboard would never be bare if I lived at Norwich. I?m
so tired of going to the cupboard and finding it bare.
?You see, Susan,? said the Moon, ?even Mother Hubbard
is tired of doing the same thing every day.?
?YES, TO BE SURE, I KNOW THE WAY TO NORWICH."


uji' 7 i \ *'?^^^^ V
?GOOD-BYE, MR. MOON. WE?RE OFF TO NORWICH.?
?She also wants a holiday/? said Susan, "same as the others.?
"Can't I have a holiday, too?? asked Simple Simon. "Mr.
Moon, does it cost much money to buy a butcher?s shop ??
"I'm sure I don?t know. I imagine it would cost quite a
lot,? answered the Moon. " Have you any money, Mother
Hubbard ??
"No, no .. . nothing. My cupboard is bare,? answered
Mother Hubbard. "Have you any money, Simple Simon ??
" Indeed I haven?t any! ? replied Simon sadly. Then suddenly
he had an idea, a wonderful idea, and he jumped about on one
leg while he told them.
"We?ll look after the butcher?s shop at Norwich, and he can
have a holiday and do something different. . . . Then we?ll all
be happy,? said Simon.
"That?s a marvellous idea,? said Susan, in admiration.
"It is so,? said the tyloon, slowly nodding his head.
"No time to lose,? said Mother Hubbard. "I'm off right
away.?


?Wait a bit/' said Simon. ?I'm coming."
?We did not think of taking you too!" said the Moon.
?That's not fair," said Simon. ?I thought of the idea!"
?All right then, you can come," said Mother Hubbard.
?Perhaps you'll help in the shop, cut up the mutton chops
and make the sausages. Good-bye Susan, good-bye Mr. Moon
we re off to Norwich."
?Just a minute, Mother Hubbard," said the Moon. ?Not
quite so fast, please. You forget that I want to go to Norwich,
and you're the only person who can show me. But also remem-
ber that it's very dark at night unless I?m shining. If I light the
way for you, will you show me where to go ?"
?Gladly," said Mother Hubbard. ?That's a fair bargain.
You must walk in the night and run in the day. It's over the
hills and far away."
?Oh, Mr. Moon, arc you leaving me?" said Susan, sadly.
?Yes, my dear, it?s time for me to go. I'll come and visit you
again to-morrow night.
?And we'll have another talk?" asked Susan.
?We shall! Now, good night, my dear," answered the Moon.
?Good-night," Susan replied,yawning. ?I'm getting a little
tired. Good-night Mother Hubbard. Good-night Simon. It's
been such fun talking to you all."
?Good-night," Susan," they called together, ?Good night!"
and their voices grew fainter as they moved farther away.
The room was now quite dark, and Susan was almost
asleep. But she heard voices faintly singing outside,
?Boys and girls come out to play,
The Moon doth shine as bright as day."
