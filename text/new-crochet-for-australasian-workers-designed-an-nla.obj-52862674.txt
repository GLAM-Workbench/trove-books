INTRODUCTION.
The patterns in this book are in three styles of crochet:
( a) those worked in the usual way, to be afterwards sewn to
the material: (b) linen crochet patterns, worked directly on the
linen bv an original method: and (c) filet crochet patterns,
chieflv with Australian motifs. Some of the designs are suit-
able for personal wear, but the object of this collection is the
artistic decoration of the home.
No trouble has been spared to make the descriptions very
clear, and to give such aid by diagram, etc., as to bring even
the more elaborate designs within the reach of careful ama-
teurs, particularly those in the far-away parts of the Com-
monwealth and New Zealand. With those readers in view, no
designs requiring transfers are included, and only such cot-
tons and linen are needed as are obtainable in Australasia.
SOME GENERAL HINTS.
Use Good Cotton.—Kvans' Roar’s Head and Ardern's Cot-
tons can be relied on for strength and evenness. The former is
put up in balls (of standard sizes) and also on reels, of
which the numbers do not coincide with those of the balls. For
example, No. 12 on reels equals No. 16 on balls ; No. 16 equals
No. 24; No. 20 equals No. 28; and No. 24 is rather finer than
No. 36; No. 30 equals No. 50, and No. 36 is about equal to
No. 60.
For very fine work, use Manloves Irish Lace Thread or
Roar's Head Carrickmacross cotton. Again the numbers are
not identical: No. 42 of Manlove's being about equal to No.
120 of Roar's Plead.
Mercine Brillante No. 12 and D.M.C. Coton Perle No. 12
are good medium-sized mercerised cottons. Pearsall’s Quad-
rant Mercerised Cotton is a new make, in all sizes from No. 1
to 150, and is a beautifully even quality to work with.
Cork-handled crochet-hooks are generally the best and most
easy to hold.
Work closely and evenly, particularly in linen crochet pat-
terns, where the lace has to fit within its linen boundaries.
Fasten off securely and invisibly, with several casting-oil
stitches at the back of the work.
Work the parts within brackets as often as indicated.
The first washing and pressing of crochet are important.
Press it ( without washing) as soon as finished in this way. Pin
it down, wrong side up, and well-stretched on the ironing blan-
ket, pull out all points, and pin each separately, if necessary.
Re very careful to get each part into its right shape. Lay a piece
of wet calico over the lace, press with a hot iron, and, while
still steaming, press, till dry, on the lace itself. Remove the
pins, and give a final pressing to take out the marks of them.

the hook, draw it through the ch, thread over hook again, draw
it through both loops on needle.
Fig. 4. Treble (tr).
With a loop on the
needle, put thread
over the hook, put
the hook into a stitch,
and draw the thread
through that stitch—
Fig. 4. —Treble (tr).
this gives three loops on the needle —put the thread over the
hook again, draw through 2 loops, thread over once more, draw
through the remaining two loops.
Fig. 5.—Half-treble (h-tr).
Fig. 6.—Double-treble (d-tr).
Fig. 2. Chain (ch).
—Make a slip-knot on
the needle, put the cot-
ton over hook, and draw
it through the loop.
Fig. 5. Half-Treble
(h-tr). —Work as
for a treble, but in-
stead of working off
the stitches two by
two, work off all
three together.
Fig. 6. Double-
Treble (d-tr). —Put
the thread over the
needle twice, then put
the hook into a stitch,
thread over hook,
draw the thread through the stitch (there will then be
four loops on the needle), thread over hook, draw through
two loops, thread over, draw through two, thread over, draw
through two, thread over, draw through last two.
Fig. 7. Long-Treble
(1-tr). —P u t the
thread three times
over the needle then
draw a loop through
as for double-treble,
and work off the five
loops two at a time.
S 1 i p-stitches (sl.st)
Fig. 7. —Long Treble (1-tr). and Slip-
stitches (sl.st).
are worked on six of the 1-tr. Put needle through the stitch,
thread over hook, draw through both the loops on the needle
at once. Slip-stitches and single crochet are the same stitch,
and are often used for joining.
Fig. 8. —Picot (p).
In the example there are two chains

Fig. 8. Picot (p).
—Make five ch, or
any given number,
then sl.st into the fifth

fourth. Picots are
sometimes made with

closely. In the exam-
ple the last three are
not yet drawn up.

together in this way, including the final chain that draws them
together.

little loop of 3 ch serves instead of the ring, and the next Mal-
tese loop is worked into it.

needle beside the loop that made the last
ch, another d-tr in same stitch, keeping the
last also on the needle, thread over and
draw through a.l at once, and make a chain
to close it tightly. This chain will count
as the first of the five of the next Maltese
loop. Any length of stitch from tr to
1-tr can be used for these loops, the begin-
ning chain being, of course, proportionately
lengthened. They may also be worked
without the preliminary chain, and may con-
tain more than three stitches. Throughout
this book, Maltese loops, or Maltese tr or

6, turn ; 7 ch, tr in ring (4 ch, tr in ring) twice , dc in last p
of beading, turn; (1 dc, 6 tr, 1 dc into loop), 3 times (the last
dc is to be taken into the sth of the 7 ch that forms the loop),

2nd of the 4 ch that attach the rose to the beading, 2 ch, 2
rows of beading, 2 ch, d-tr to end of last petal, 2 ch, 16 rows
of beading. Now make the next half-rose, beginning with
10 ch. When a sufficient length is worked, take a row of
loops right along, working into the petals of the roses (al-
ways into the 3rd stitch from the ends of the petals) and into
the picots of the beading between the roses. Begin this row of
loops with [a dc into the middle one of the 5 picots, 5 ch. tr in
next p, 5 ch, d-tr in next, 4 ch, d-tr in petal, 7 ch, tr in same
petal, 7 ch, tr into next petal, 9 ch. tr in same petal, 7 ch, tr in
3rd petal, 7 ch, d-tr in same petal, 4 ch, d-tr in p, 5 ch. tr in
next p, 5 ch, dc in middle p]. Repeat part in brackets all along.
The next row' is of tiny loops of 2 ch, dc into loop all along.
Begin with a dc just before the middle picot, 2 loops of 2 ch
into the loop after the middle p, 3 into the 2nd loop, 2 into
3rd loop. 4 into 4th loop, 4 into sth loop, 5 into the 6th, 4
into the 7th and Bth, 2 into the 9th, 3 into the 10th, and 2
into the 11th.
Fig. 17. —Insertion.
Work another piece of beading and roses, but in doing
the last row of tiny loops on the 2nd piece join it to the first
piece. It wall be seen that the rose of one piece fits into the
hollow curve of the other. The join is made by w'orking the
same number of loops into the 2nd piece, but instead of
working the 2 ch at once, 1 ch is made, dc into a little loop
of Ist piece, 1 ch, dc into loop of 2nd piece, taking them one
by one all the way along. Join on the cotton with a dc into
the loop before the middle p, 1 ch, dc into the 2nd loop of the
4 that arc above the middle petal of ist piece, 1 ch, dc into
loop after the micidle p, 1 ch, dc into 3rd tiny loop, 1 ch, an


other dc into same loop of 2nd piece. Continue thus all
along. Should at any time the work be found to be a loop
out of place, which would prevent the halves from fitting pro-
perly, omit a loop on one side to put them even again.

Bth Round. — (6 spaces, increase at corners) 4 times.
pth Round. —All trebles, putting 2 into each space, and 1 on
each tr; increase at corners. There should be 49 tr on each
side.
joth Round. —Like last, each side containing 55 tr. Finish
off the first square.
Next work the 2nd square until 1+ sides remain to be
done. At the corner work 1 of the 3 ch. join to first square
at the second corner past the fastening off; 1 ch, 3 tr into the
same hole, 6 tr on the side. Now you work in the open lace
at the same time as you work the last row down the side of
the square.
Ist Row. —6 ch, join to Ist square at 9th tr, turn.
2nd Row. —B dc on loop, sl.st to top of last tr (always),

first of the last 7 tr), 5 ch, dc into loop close to the d-tr of the
last row, 2 ch, dc into next loop close to the same d-tr (this
makes a little hole just above the d-tr), 5 ch, 1 d-tr into side
of square where last joining is, and 1 tr into same square 7
stitches further along the side.
Note now that d-trebles are always taken into the little
holes of previous row, and little holes of 2 ch are always made
over the d-trebs of last row.
6th Rozv. —2 ch, dc into loop of 5 ch, 5 ch, d-tr into hole,
5 ch, hole of 2 ch above next d-tr, sl.st over 3 ch, 7 tr on side.

otherwise exactly like last 2 rows.
Next, increase at the corner hole, and finish the last half-
side and fasten off.
Join all the eight squares in this way. In order to join
the first and last squares, pull out the last half-row of trebles in
the first square, and work them in again, with the filling, using
si.st over the trebs of the lower half of side. If, by chance, you
have joined the squares so that this half-side is not in the
proper place, just join on the cotton at the 9th stitch, and sl.st
all the way down the side instead of working trebles.
The last row of this last piece of filling will end just be-
fore the corner; sl.st to corner, 4 ch for a d-tr, 7 more ch for
a loop. Now work the pattern right round with loops of 7
ch, taking a d-tr into each corner. At the end of round, in mak-
ing the last 7 ch after the hole, put a picot in it thus: 4 ch,
picot of 4 ch, 3 ch, dc into the 4th stitch of beginning loop,
2 ch, dc into loop. At the end of this round, treat the picot
as a hole, and so the work will go round and round without
having to join the rounds. In the 2nd round make the loops
of 6 ch. In the 3rd and 4th rounds, of 5 ch, and in the sth, of

last lower corner, join to the 8 ch loop of other medallion,
4 ch, 3 dc into corner loop, 1 ch, 3 dc into next loop of 2nd
medallion, 1 ch, 3 dc into next loop of Ist medallion; work
to and fro to top and fasten off.
For the centre, work loops of 5 ch, dc into loop all round,
taking one of the dc into the stitch that joins the medallions.
In the next round, 5 tr into each loop (none between), fol-
lowed by a row of 1 ch, miss 1, tr in next. In the final round
put 2 tr into 3 holes, 1 into the 4th, and repeat all round.
Fasten off. Cut a linen centre the right size, buttonhole it
round, and sew to the lace. The rest of the pattern is worked
in one round. Begin at the top of the open lace, where it joins
the tr. There should be 4 holes along the top, not counting
those that touch the tr.

working dc on the tr till the open lace is reached.


II. —Australian Linen-Crochet
Designs.
Introduction.
“ Linen Crochet ” is a name originated by the writer for
her method of crocheting directly on linen or canvas with-
out either sewing or buttonholing; it will be found to give a
beautifully even, strong, neat finish, resembling buttonholing
and hemstitching combined, and to be much more quickly
worked than either.
To prepare the linen where a straight edge is to be used,
always cut a turning of about half an inch. Draw two threads
half an inch from the edge, leave about ten threads undrawn
inside these, and draw two more (see Fig. 35, where can-
vas is employed instead of linen to make the lines show more
distinctly). Next fold the linen exactly between the drawn
lines, and right side out, so as to bring the two open lines to-
gether (see Fig. 36), and work double crochet evenly into the
open lines and over the solid edge. This is the foundation of
all linen-crochet work; but where lines are curved or not on
the straight edge of the linen, the latter is merely turned back,
and double-crochet worked as evenly as possible without drawn
threads.
When a side, or any convenient portion is done, the turn-
ing is to be cut away at the back, very close to the dc, and
the next side turned down. Five or six dc into the same
place at the corner will make a neat, strong turn.
Occasionally the linen is worked completely round with
this plain dc; but more often the crochet design, or portion
of it, is joined in or worked at the same time by turning
back on the dc worked to add what is necessary, and then con-
tinuing with the foundation for the next section.
If there are threads to be drawn, “ Old Bleach,” or some
other “ round weave ” linen should be used. If, however, you
are working without drawn threads, and the linen is at all
stiff, you can cut the linen with only one-eighth inch turning;
fold it back and crochet into the single linen, and right over
the narrow fold. This work can be done with any cotton, but
the mercerised threads give the softest finish.
To cut out the paper patterns for the linen from the
diagrams, exactness is essential. Draw the pattern on firm
paper, according to the measurements given, cutting along the
heavy line. Lay this pattern upon the wrong side of
the linen, and outline it lightly on the linen with a lead
pencil. Next take a fairly close running along the pen-
cil line, so that the pattern appears on the right side in
running stitches. Cut away the linen half an inch out-
side this line for a turning, and the linen is ready to be
worked into. Where the
folded linen is on the bias,
it is advisable to take an-
other running one-eighth
of an inch from the edge
through both thicknesses
of the linen to hold it in
place, and prevent it from
stretching while the dc is
being worked into it. Snip
the turnings wherever
necessary to make the
linen lie flat.
In most linen-crochet
patterns the double-
crochet worked on the
linen is done by measure-
Fig. 33. —Showing how to draw the
threads of the linen.
ment, the rest by number
of stitches. Since, however, a given number of stitches should,
if even, always cover the same space, it follows that 6 stitches
on the linen will be equal to a quarter of an inch, 12 stitches
to half an inch, approximately. Now, if you want to use a
coarser or finer cotton than that here described, see how
much space your six double-crochet will cover, and use that
space as a measurement instead of the quarter-inch, etc. I
would strongly advise anyone substituting cottons and needles
to work a complete pattern in their chosen material to see
that all is right before they go on. Novices had much better
get the materials mentioned here before experimenting in other
sizes of cotton.

edge of linen (sec introduction) with a p of 5 ch after each

This stitch can also
be used to ornament
the surface of linen.
It will then be
worked like a little
tuck, and will serve
to contract a centre
of linen that is too
large for the lace
(sec Fig. 52).

3rd and top rows. Between the points work only 5 dc on
the foundation, join to the medallion, 5 more dc on foundation,
then the 42 dc for next point.
For the insertion draw the threads half an inch from the

2 ch, and 2 dc, and at the middle loop by 6ch and 6 dc. These
bars may be lengthened or shortened, if necessary, to make
work fit evenly. The places to which the joins are made can
be seen in design.

Cut the linen away
from the back of the
lower edge, before preparing the foundation of the upper edge,
which is worked in the same way.
Figs. 46, 47, and 48. Round Centre-Piece of Wheels. —
Use Quadrant Mercine Xo. 50, or Mercine Brillante No. 12,
and a No. 5 hook. The picots are of 5 ch without sl.sts.
To Make the Wheels, see Fig. 25, where the first ray
of the adjoining wheel is shown attached.
To Join the Wheels (see diagram Fig. 47). The Ist ray,
shown by the single ray in Fig. 25, and distinguished by a
double line in Fig. 47, is always joined to the 3rd ray of
other wheels, and this 3rd ray is always the one following the
two rays that have only 2 picots. The first 10 ch should be
si.stitched to the end of the 3rd ray at its outer edge, then, after
the two rows of dc are worked, another join is made to the same


ray at its inner edge, before working the sl.sts and picots.
Thus, the inside curve of any ray is always in a line with
the outside curve of the one it is attached to, and no wheel
joins another by more than one ray.
Using the diagram Fig. 47 as a guide, join together 8
groups of 7 wheels each into semicircles. Then work the circlets
(Nos. 8 to 12 inclusive) in this order. Work No. 8 free, join No.
9to No. 8, and also to No. 2. Join No. to to Nos. 9, 1 and 2,
Join No. 11 to Nos. 10, 6, and 7, both of next semicircle, join
No. 12 to Nos. 11, 8,6, and No. 13 to Nos. 1. 10, 11, and 7.

Fig. 48. —Diagram showing how to cut the linen for Fig. 46.
Cut out the pattern of the linen according to diagram Fig.
48, following the instructions on page 22. Turn back the
linen along the line of running at the top of one of the points,
and work two inches of foundation dc.
At end of side turn, and work 4 loops of 12 ch each into
the dc, putting the loops half an inch apart. Turn, 4 dc, p,
8 dc, p, 4 dc into 3 loops, and fill only half of the 4th loop,
with 4 dc, p, 4 dc, turn; work 3 loops of 12 ch into those be-
low, turn; fill 2\ ; turn; work 2 loops of T 2 ch into those be-

but in the last row make only 3 picots
at the 4th, 9th, and 14th stitches, join
the middle picot to the end of the
2nd ray of the 6th wheel, and work
5 more tr into the loop of 8 ch. Fill
the next loop with 10 tr, and after
doing 4 tr of the succeeding loop
make another ray, and join to i
the next wheel. In doing the J
top ray, put Btr into the loop, M
and miss only 6 of them in m,
making the ray.
When all the crochet is
worked upon this two inches
of linen, cut away the waste
linen at the back, and fold
down the next side in the
same way, carrying the tack-
ing down into the angle and
up to the top of following
side. It will be necessary to
slit the linen at the angle to
make it lie flat.
To turn the corner, put 3 or
6 stitches into the same place, and
then work half an inch on the
linen. 6 ch, join to the 2nd ray
of next wheel (sec illustration),
turn; put 6 dc on the chain; work
another half inch on the linen, and join
to the ist ray of same wheel.
Angle Filling. Work down to the angle,
take several dc neatly to turn the corner strongly,
and work three-eighths of an inch up the next side.
Work a loop of 12 ch. join to linen of other side

at three-eighths of an inch from corner, and fi I this
loop exactly as the ones at top of point. Work three-
eighths on linen and put 2 loops across. Fill these and work
on in the same way till the sth row gives you 5 loops. In fill-
ing these 5 loops, there are other loops and joinings to be
made, thus :
Fill half of the Ist loop, join by a tr between the picots
of next ray of Ist wheel (see illustration). Fill the rest of
the loop and half of the next one; turn, 12 ch, into the ist
loop close beside the tr; fill half of this loop, and join with a
tr into the next picot of next ray, and then put another tr into
the end picot of following ray (i.e., of next wheel). Finish
the loop, and also the 2nd loop of sth row, fill half of the
3rd loop, join with a tr between the picots of next ray, finish
this loop, fill the 4th and half of the sth, turn ; 12 ch into middle
of 4th loop, 12 ch into middle of 3rd loop, turn. Fill half a
loop, join to next picot of next ray, with a dc, finish this loop
and fill half the following one. join to next picot of next ray;
finish loop and put 1 dc into the sth loop before joining with
a tr to the ist picot of next ray. Then finish this last loop,
and work half an inch on the linen. Work 6 ch to the 2nd
ray of 7th wheel. Then work dc to top of point. Cut away
the waste linen behind what you have just done, and turn down
the top of the next point, turning the corner as before with
5 or 6 dc in the same place. Work a fancy stitch on the linen
three-quarters of an inch from the edge.

with a needle and thread about an eighth of an inch from the
folded edge, to prevent sagging. In crocheting round the
squares, join to the medallions with a treble at the corners
and middle of sides. Three little points like those in lodging
41 arc to be worked on the linen between the medallions. The
linen, in the centre will most likely be found to be rather full
when the edge is finished. Draw a circle three-quarters of
an inch from the foundation, fold back, and pinch the linen
along this line, and work dc with picots at each sth stitch all
round (see Fig. 37).

For the outer edge, work dc into each tr, putting in the
loops at the places shown in design. The little loops of 8
ch, si.st into top of last dc, 12 dc, into the 8 ch, are worked op-
posite the Bth and gth rings, the 2nd of each pair being stopped
at the 6th of the 12 dc to make the outer loop of 15 ch, sl.st
into first little loop, 3 dc, 2 h-tr, 15 tr, 2 h-tr, 3 dc; then put
the other 6dc into the small loop. The other pairs are op-
posite the nth and 12th and 14th and 15th rings. The single
loops between these are of 12 ch, 3 dc, 2 h-tr, 12 tr, 2 h-tr, 3
dc. The dc on this outer row only extends to where the
chain across is seen.
Next prepare linen centre according to the diagram. Fig.
55, and the directions given on page 22. Turn back the linen
at the marked line, snipping the turning liberally at the curves,
and work close dc all round. Next work a row of 12 ch loops
all round, putting 21 into the deep curves, and 5 on each half
of the outer circle curves, si. stitching about 12 stitches in the
middle of each of these ends. Next fill all these loops with
4 dc, p, 8 dc, p, 4 dc, joining to the lace with little bars of 2
ch and 2 dc in the middle of each; while the bars to the scrolls
beside the circles and the central ornament are of 4 ch, with
2 dc, p, 2 dc upon them.

put an extra loop on the wing before turning at the end. There
should be 16 holes along the top, all told, and the last row
should be on a line with the 4th hole of the wing.
The loops at the top of this piece are all the same —i.e., 12
ch, covered with 2 dc, I h-tr, 12 tr, 1 h-tr, 2 dc, and are worked
at the same time as the holes are filled with trebles. Work 5
tr into each of 3 holes, turn; make the Ist loop over 10 tr«,

To Join the Linen and Lace. —Cut
an exact circle of linen 14J inches in
diameter. Fold down, and run a tiny
hem of one-eighth inch. Space and
mark the linen into 8 equal parts,
tacking the double loops loosely at
the marks with half an inch between
them. Next mark 1 inch on each side
of these, and the next half inch far-
ther along on each side. The spaces
remaining are divided into 3 equal
portions of nearly | of an inch each.
Now work dc over the hem closely and
evenly, joining to the lace at the first
of the double loops with 1 ch, 2 dc in
middle of loop, 1 dc over the ch, J an
inch on linen, join to 2nd loop, I inch
on linen, join to wing opposite bottom
hole, i inch on linen, join to wing
at 6th st of wing, % inch on linen, 6
ch, join to lace at 6th st of open
part, 6 dc on ch, f inch on linen, 6
ch, join to other side of motif. Con-
tinue all round, making the joins to
correspond. If the linen should seem
rather large for the lace, as may hap-
pen with some workers, draw a circle
about 2 inches from the edge, pinch
up the linen, and work a row of
Fig. 37, taking the dc about an eighth
of an inch into the double linen.

Figs. 57, 58, and 59. Border—ln this pattern the whole
of the edging is worked upon the linen along with the founda-
tion. Use Mercine Brillante No. 12, Boar’s Head (reels) No.
24, or Quadrant Mercine No. 50. and allow 4J inches for
each repeat, with 2 inches extra for the corners and turnings.
It is advisable to allow a inch or two more, in case of slight
mismeasurements.
Pig. 57a.—Design for Supper-Cloth.
Prepare the linen on two sides, which are at right angles to
one another, according to the directions on page 22, leaving
the other two sides undrawn until the work reaches them.
Next, take a slip of paper or tape, marked and measured
as in the diagram (Fig. 59), and, placing it along your linen
edge exactly as shown in the diagram, mark the linen lightly
Fig. 59.—Diagram showing how to mark the linen edge of Fig. 57.


with a pencil between the two lines, but nearest to the outs:de
one. Now turn back the linen exactly between the two lines
so as to bring them together. Into these drawn lines, and
over the folded linen, the dc is to be worked, the pattern
being at the same time worked as the different dots are reached.
These clots, by the way, will now be at the back of the work;
Fig 58. —Detail of Fig. 57.
they can be easily seen by bending the linen forward, and,
placed there, will not mar the front of the work.
The Pattern. —Having folded and marked the linen as de-
scribed, join on the cotton at the first mark and work dc along
the linen for one and a half inches : i.e., as far as the Jth mark.
The Trefoil. —8 ch, turn, miss 4, sl.st into sth and 6th dc,
turn ; 3 dc into loop, 12 ch, take needle out of the work, insert
it into the top of the last dc made, draw the loop through, into
new loop put 2 dc, a half-tr, 10 tr, 2 h-tr, 2 dc ; 4 dc in lower
loop ; 15 ch; make another loop in same way, putting 14 tr
into it instead of 10; 4 dc in lower loop, another petal like the
first, 2 dc in lower loop, and then work three-quarters of an inch
on linen—i.e., to next mark.
The Ribbons. —9 ch, turn 2 tr into
sth and 6th tr of nearest petal, 11
ch, 2 tr into 7th and Bth of middie
petal, 11 ch, 2 tr into 3rd petal, 9
ch, sl.st to the edge at the 3rd mark
(which is now covered by the dc, and,
if not discoverable, use the measure
to find the place. Turn. Into Ist
loop, 12 dc, 2 on the tr, 14 into next,
2 on tr, 14 on 3rd. 2 on tr, 12 on last.
Now work 4 dc on the linen (nearly
to the next mark), turn; 1 ch, tr in
Ist dc of ribbon (1 ch, miss 1, tr in
next) 13 times; (1 ch, tr in next) 5
times; (T ch, miss 1, tr in next) 13
times, 1 ch, miss 4 of the dc on the
linen, and sl.st to the sth; turn and
put 2 dc into each hole all round the
ribbon.
Continue on the linen to the 10th
mark, where work another trefoil,
and fill in this pattern the same as
the last till the 4th hole of the last
row of the ribbon is filled, then work
the spray as follows :
The Spray. —6 ch. join at 4th tr
to Ist ribbon; turn; 8 dc on loop, fill
2 holes of ribbon; turn; 1 tr into Ist, 2nd, and 3rd dc of cross-
bar, 2 into each of the 4th and sth, 1 into each of the 6th, 7th,
and Bth (10 in all) ; join to corresponding part of ribbon.
The First Leaf. —21 ch, join to ribbon at 14th tr from the
bottom: turn; 25 dc on loop, sl.st to Ist tr of crossbar; turn;
4 dc, 17 tr, 4 dc, sl.st to next dc of ribbon, turn; 4 sl.st (picot
of 5 ch, 3 dc) 7 times, 4 dc on crossbar.


The Plotter. —24 eh, make a ring of the last 15, 3 eh, 4 tr into
ring; join to 2nd picot, 6 tr into ring, 8 eh, turn; miss 3 tr,
sl.st into 4th, turn; 2 dc, I h-tr, 4 tr, 5 oh, 4 tr, 1 h-tr, 2 dc, all
into the loop of 8 eh, 6 tr into ring; make another loop, 6 tr
into ring, make a third loop, 6 tr into ring, join round, sl.st
to 3rd of the 9 eh of stem, and over the remaining 6 put 6 dc.
Now slipstitch over the remaining tr of the crossbar, and fill
the holes of the 2nd ribbon till the 14th from the bottom is
done. Now work the 2nd leaf.
Second Leaf. —21 eh, join to ribbon at the dc nearest to the
crossbar, 25 dc over the chain, 1 dc into ribbon, turn; 4 dc, 17
tr, 4 dc into last row, sl.st to Ist and 2nd tr of crossbar, turn;
(3 dc, p) 7 times, joining the 2nd picot to the ring of the flower,
to match the other side fi.e., at the 4th tr from bottom). Fin-
ish the leaf with 4 sl.st, finish also the ribbon, and work 1 dc on
the linen.
The Solitary Floivcr. —Work it exactly like the other flower,
joining it to the ribbon at the 4th tr. Next work on the linen
till the place for the next trefoil is reached. Do not forget
to join the next ribbon to the solitary flower.
The Corner is easily managed. After the last ribbon of the
side is done, put 2 dc on the linen, and make a leaf like the
others, joining it to the ribbon at the 10th tr. Work 3 or 4
more dc on the linen, then draw the threads for the next side
close to the last stitch. Cut away the strip of waste linen
at the back of what you have just worked, right along to the
end of the linen. Fold down the next side neatly, and work 4
dc all into the same little hole at the corner, spreading them
along to the point. Next work a flower, then 4 more dc into
the same hole, and, leaving the other leaf unworked, go on with
the first trefoil and ribbon of this side. At the 10th tr of the
last row of the ribbon make the second leaf to match the first.
The Insertion. —When the outer edging is all worked, meas
ufe a half-inch of plain linen all round, and draw 2 threads,
cutting them where they meet at the corners. A quarter of
an inch inside these, draw two more. Fold back the linen as
before, and work with the edging towards you. Using the
work of the edging as a guide, begin at the corner with dc on
the linen, and put a trefoil exactly opposite the one on the edge.
Next, work dc till opposite the inside edge of the ribbon.
Do 10 ch, join to the middle of nearest petal; 13 dc on the chain,
4 dc on linen, 1 ch, tr in Ist dc of ribbon-end (1 ch, miss 1, tr
in next) 3 times; 1 ch, miss t, h-tr in next, 1 ch, miss 1, dc in
next 3; sl.st to petal, turn; 3 sl.st on the dc, then 2 dc into
each hole.
Now work to the next trefoil, and, when the Ist petal is half
done, stop to put in the 2nd ribbon-end, by working 10 ch, and
joining to the linen at the sth dc past the other ribbon-end, or
so as to make a line with the ribbon on the edging; turn; 13
dc over the chain, 1 sl.st into the petal of trefoil, turn; 3 dc, 1
ch, miss 1, h-tr in next (1 ch, miss 1, tr in next) 4 times, join
to the dc on linen and turn, filling the holes with 2 dc, and
putting sl.st on the last 3 dc. Now continue the trefoil and
work the whole round in the same way.
When this round is finished, cut awav the linen underneath
carefully and close to the crochet, thus taking out the central
piece of linen altogether. Draw the thread of two sides as
before, rather less than half an inch from the edge.
Begin at the inner crossing lines, and work quarter of an
inch on the linen, 6 oh, join to end of ribbon, turn, 6 dc on the
chain; then g dc on the linen: 15 ch, make a ring of 12 of
them, 3 ch, 8 tr into the ring; join to ribbon at 4th hole, 8 tr
in ring, join to next ribbon, 8 tr in ring, join round, sl.st to
the last dc on linen, work g more on the linen and make an-
other bar. Half an inch farther on, the middle petal of trefoil
is joined in. The idea is to work this row so that the bars
and rings are quite straight, and therefore care must be taken
to examine the work frequently to see that a too rigid adherence
to the measurements is not dragging the pattern.

adapted for a blind border, and with a wider insertion. Use
coarse cream or ecru cotton, either Ivory Cotton No. 16, or
Crochet Cotton No. 8, and work upon two strips of Congress
canvas on which the drawn lines are 8 threads apart. The
upper strip is for a casing for the rod, and is to be sewn at its
upper edge to the blind.
For the crochet of the edging, follow the directions given
in Fig. 57. taking the dc stitches into the canvas 2 threads apart,
and working by number of stitches instead of bv measurement-


Fig. 60.—Lace for Blind.
28 dc on the canvas, now work the trefoil; 1.5 dc on
canvas; begin the ribbon; 4 dc on canvas; work the
outer row of ribbon; 3 dc on canvas to be between the
ribbons; 24 more dc on canvas; work next trefoil rib-
bon, etc., 3 dc on canvas; work the solitary flower;
then 28 dc on canvas before the next trefoil.
The upper edge of this strip of canvas is the same, but with
the petals left off the solitary flower, and with the trefoils placed
opposite the ends of the ribbons below.
Next work dc along the lower edge of upper strip of can-
vas, joining to the insertion as you work. At the top of the
ribbon the joins are of 2 trebles, 6 stitches apart —these come
at the 15th tr, from the bottom of ribbon— 15 dc on canvas, 7
ch, join to ribbon at the 10th tr from the bottom; 7 dc on the
chain; 6 dc on the canvas, 6 ch to middle of ring, 6 dc on ch,
6 dc on canvas, 7 ch, tr to next ribbon, 7 dc on ch, 15 dc on
canvas, tr into ribbon at the 15th from bottom, 6 dc on canvas,
then the 2nd treble into the ribbon. Repeat all along. Make
a tassel in the usual way, and crochet a cap for it. Make a
ring of about 2 inches of chain, fill it with dc, not too closely;
work round and round with dc into the back thread, you will
find it form a little cup, with the right side of the crochet in-
side. Work 2 rounds plain, then 5 rounds, missing each 7th
Ist; 3 rounds, missing each sth; 2 rounds, missing each
3rd Then miss every 2nd st till only 2 remain. Draw
the thread through the loop, and leave the cotton long
enough to make the cord when folded into 4 strands.
Attach 2 long lengths of cotton to the top of
the tassel; pass these through the hole at top of cap,
and plait the 6 threads in twos into a sufficiently long
cord.
Figs. 61 and 62. Irish Crochet Doyley.—Cut out the linen
carefully by the diagram, big. 62, according to the directions
on page 22. Use Manlove's Irish Lace Thread No. 42, or
Boar’s Head Cotton No. 120. Work dc closely and neatly
round the scallops. Work two each of Figs. 19, 20, and 23,
and one each of 21 and 22. Then join on the cotton at the
tip of a point of the linen, and work 7 double-picot-loops (dpi. )
thus; 2 ch, p, 3 ch, p, 2 ch. These loops are to be spaced evenly
down one side of the angle, leaving about the space of a loop
at the bottom; 2 ch, p, 2 ch, 1 tr midway into the bottom space,
tr also into same place in next side, 2 ch, p, 2 ch into the 2nd
side, and 7 dpi. up to the top of this side, turn; 16 dpi. into
loops of last row, the last one being made with a tr. turn ; 4

petal, h-loop into the 6th loop,
h-loop into next petal, h-loop
into 7th loop, 1 ch, p, tr into
bottom loop, 1 ch, dc in next
loop. Now work 8 half-loops
to and fro between motif and
filling, leaving 4 loops un-
worked, then work round the
top of the motif with 9 dpi.,
h-loop into the nearest un-
joined loop of side, turn; 10
dpi. over the motif, h-loop into
nearest free loop, turn; 10
loops round top of motif, h-
loop into nearest free loop,
turn; 11 loops of 8 ch without
p round the top of motif, the
last being taken into the near-
est free loop of side, turn; 10
dc into each of 11 loops, turn;
1 dc into each dc, putting a
p on the middle of each loop,
half-loop and 1 tr into nearest
free loop, turn; (single-picot-
loop—spl.—of 2 ch, p, 5 ch,

spl. into dc after picot) 11
times, half-loop into the near-
est free loop, spl. and a tr into
last free loop, turn; spl. into
each spl. all the way round,
1 into the end loop of Ist row,
and 1 into the tip of linen
point. Work down the next
and other angles in the same
way.
As it is necessary to have all
holes as nearly as possible the
Fig. 61. —Irish Crochet Doyley.


same size, it is permissible to alter the number of stitches in
any loop, or to substitute any stitch—say, a tr for a dc, or vice
versa, a spl. or a h-loop for a dpi. if the w 7 ork appears to need
such variation. In working round motifs that vary as much
as these do in outline, it is impossible to give the exact number
of stitches required for every little angle and curve; but the
directions here given will be found very nearly right for all.
To sum up : Work 2 rows of dpi. on the linen, then join in the
motif with half-loops; then 3 rows of dpi, over the motif, taking-
in the side loops one at a time at each turn: then the horse-shoe,
and 2 rows ot spl. above it, taking in the last of the free side
loops. Outside of all comes a round of loops of 8 ch, into
which the edging-. Fig. 38, is to be worked.

Xo. 12. Roar's Head Crochet Cotton Xo. 30. or Quadrant
Mercine Crochet Cotton X T o. 50. and a fine hook, Xo. 6.
Make four of the Motifs, Fig. 28. Next prepare a square
of Old Bleach linen, according to the directions on page 22, and
so as to have the outer drawn threads 44 inches across. Then
work dc evenly and closely along the outer edges, joiir’ng in
the motifs as you work. When half an inch is done, work
4 ch, si.st to motif between 3rd and 4th groups of tr, 4dc on
4 ch, work an inch on linen, attach to motif at end of last hole
of middle row of holes, one inch on linen, attach to motif, one
inch on linen, attach to motif with 4 ch, as before, half an
inch on linen: cut away the waste half-inch turning at back
of work; fold down next side of linen, and put 6 or 7 stitches
into the corner. Work the other sides in the same way.
For the Small Ornament. —Work a centre like the others,
attaching it to a corner of the linen before filling the 10th hole
with tr. t hen fill the last 3 holes, join round, and with a
tr attach to the right-hand motif at the 4th group of tr; 2 sl.st
on circle, 12 ch, join to motif at 3rd group of tr, 3 dc, 2 h-tr,
9 tr, 2 h-tr, 5 dc all into loop; 3 sl.st on circle, another loop of
12 ch, taken into the last tr of the first loop, 5 sl.st on circle,
loop of 25 ch taken into the last made sl.st; into 'this loop
put 5 dc, 3 h-tr ( join to side-loop with a tr taken into the last
tr) , 7 tr, 12 d-tr, 7 tr, 3 h-tr, 5 dc; 10 sl.st on circle, 2 ch, then
sl.st on next motif from the 15th to 27th tr, counting from the
little bar; 12 ch, join to circle, fill this loop as far as the last
tr, 12 ch, miss 2 of circle, sl.st into 3rd, fill this loop, joining to
central loop ; then finish the end loop and fasten off.
The Inner Edge of Linen Square. —A quarter of an inch
from the drawn threads draw 7 two more all round, and a quar-
ter inch within these draw two. The central part of linen,
which is afterwards to be cut away, can be slit for ease in
working. Begin at middle of a side. Work dc to corner,
and 8 dc of next side. 8 ch, sl.st to Bth st across the corner.
12 dc on chain, 1 on linen, 12 dc on 12 dc, 2 sl.st on side, 6
loops of 3 ch into each 2nd st across the corner, 2 dc on side,
6 loops of 3 ch into the last row, 3 ch, miss 2 of side, sl.st on
next 2 dc, 8 loops of 3 ch, 3 dc on side, 9 loops of 3 ch, then
put 3 dc into each loop, and work along rest of the side, and
8 stitches of the next side, where another corner is to be
made. Cut away the central waste linen along the drawn
threads at back of work.


The centre is merely like
the centre of the motif, with
a 4th petal in place of the
bar. It is attached to the cor-
ners at the loop between the
petals, and to the side at the
one in the middle of the
petals.
Fig. 6t. Sachet. —Use fine
cotton for this: Boar's Head
No. T2o, or Quadrant Mercine
Crochet No. 150. Work 4
motifs, Fig. 28. Then take a
piece of linen gi inches square,
draw the threads half an inch
from edge, and again a quar-
ter of an inch inside these. In
beginning the work, lay down
a motif at one corner, and
trace lightly with a pencil a
line rather less than a quarter
of an inch from the lace (see
design). Make the other cor-
ners exactly like it. Next
work dc along the drawn-
thread side to the pencil line.
Turn down the linen along
this pencil line, slitting it to
make it lie flat; work dc round
the curve, joining to the motif
with little bars of 4 ch, cov-
ered with 4 dc at every sth
or 6th st. There should be
9 bars to each half-motif.
When these are all attached,
work little loops of 3 ch into
each 3rd st all round the
piece, motifs and all; then put
a final row' of 3 tr, p, 3 tr
into tst hole, 1 dc into next.
Fig. 63. —Square Doylesy.


Make two of these doy-
leys exactly alike. Lay them
down face to face. Sew
them together with neat
back-stitch or stem-stitch,
along the sides of a square
drawn from the middles of
the sides. Then fold the
upper motifs towards the
centre, when your sachet is
complete.
Fig. 65. Scroll Runner. —
Cut a strip of linen 9 inches
wide (this allows half-inch
turning each side), and draw
the double threads along
each side, making the linen
part of runner 8 inches wide.
Next cut a square of paper
with 4i in. sides. Fold it
cornerwise and cut in half.
Lay the half on the linen,
with the wide side along the
outer drawn thread and
draw the angle lightly with a
pencil. An inch and a half
farther along the inner
drawn thread place the
paper again, and trace the
next angle. Continue for the
number of angles required.
Then place the paper at mid-
dle of the ends, so as to leave
a bar of linen li in. wide
between it and the end
angles. See that the angles
of opposite sides of the run-
ner are exactly opposite to
one another.
Fig. 64.—Sachet.


Work as many scrolls and circles, Fig. 26, as you require.
Then work the motif, Fig. 27, joining the Ist and last rings to
the scrolls, as shown in design, with bars of 6 ch, covered with
4 dc, p, 4 dc. Next work dc on the linen, joining to the ring mo-
tifs with bars of 4 ch, and a dc in the middle. Work i | inches
on the linen of the angle, turn; 4 loops of 12 ch, turn; 4 dc,
p, 4 dc into Ist loop, join to scroll with 4 ch, 4 dc on 4 ch,
4 dc, p, 4 dc in same loop. Fill the next loop, joining to the
scroll with 3 ch, and following one with 2 ch, and the last with
a dc. Then work down to the corner, following the directions
on page 27 for the loops across the angle, and joining in
the scroll with dc for the middle loops and tr for the end ones;
4 loops on linen, joined to match those of the other side, com-
plete this row. The small end motifs have 10 little rings and
no picoted loops beneath them. 3 ch with 3 dc upon it forms
the join at the ends and a dc makes the middle join.

III. —Filet-Crochet.
General Directions.
Any cross-stitch or filet lace pattern can be copied in crochet,
and this style of crochet is therefore called Filet Crochet. You
have simply to count the number of squares across the piece
to be copied, and make three times as many chain as there are
squares, with five more to turn, if the edge of the next row be-
gins with an open space, or with three more to turn if the edge
of the next row begins with a solid block or cross-stitch.
In the close or more “ solid ’’ parts of the pattern, each cross
of the cross-stitch is represented by three trebles or a "block;"
each open square by a “ space ’’ also formed of three stitches,
2 ch, miss 2, Itr in the next. In Fig. 67 the two lower rows
are of “ spaces ’’ and the two upper ones are of mixed spaces
and blocks. In beginning
a piece of lace, three chain
must be made for each
block and for each space.
If a space be followed
by a block, there will be 4
tr together, of which the
first belongs to the space,
the other three to the
Fig. 67.—Blocks and Spaces.
block. (Sec Fig. 67.) If two block's follow a space,
there will be 7 tr together, of which the first belongs to the
space, and the other six to the two blocks. The groups of
trebles, therefore, always have three times as many stitches as
there are crosses, and one in addition.
Another fancy network
is called “ lacet ” filling.
Each lacet fills exactly 2
spaces. The Open Lacet
(Fig. 68a) is made by work-
ing 5 ch, miss 5, tr in the
6th; and the Close Lacet
(Fig. 68b), by working j

close lacet (b) lower.
ch, miss 2, dc in 3rd, 3 ch, miss 2, tr in next. These lacets either
follow one another alternately, and with close lacets worked on
open ones, and vice versa in the following rows (see Fig. 69) :
or else are worked in one row of open lacets, with the next row
of close lacets (see Fig. 70). Where there is only room for half
a lacet, a space is put. Where you want the solid pattern to
stand out very sharply against a lacet filling, it is best to work
spaces all round the solid parts, and between them and the lacet
filling, because the lacet filling gives a rather broken outline. The
cushion cover on the
frontispiece has this
“ space" edge to the
trebles. I t wa s
worked by a young
girl of fifteen (Miss
E. Alexander. Mr.
Barker, S.A.) from,
the chart. The
Fig. 69. —Facet Filling.
rows of lacets must be kept in a line right across the pattern;
that is, the lacet filling on the far side of a solid row of trebles
must be continued exactly as if it had been an unbroken row
of lacets. Both top threads of trebles are to be worked into.
When working blocks over spaces, the first two trebles may be
taken into the hole, but the third must be taken into the fol-
lowing treble.
In most of the
filet patterns that
follow. the cross-
stitch design is
given at the end of
the book, and can be
worked from with
the aid of these gen-
eral directions.
Fig. 70.—Facet Filling.
Filet crochet (being the easiest form of crochet) is the most
suitable style for beginners to attempt. I add a few hints for
the inexperienced. Hold the cotton fairly tight; work with the
needle slanting obliquely, so that in working trebles, etc., the last
loop on the needle is not drawn up loosely, which spoils the
outlines of the solid parts of the work. Above all, do not let
the size of the spaces vary at different parts of the pattern.


Fig. 71. —Trefoil Insertion.
Fig. 71. Trefoil Insertion. —Work this the short way,
the width of the open spaces only, and add the rows of
trebles at the edge afterwards: 33 chain for 11 spaces, then
5 more to turn. Work a row of spaces by taking a treble into
the Bth chain from the needle, then 2 ch, miss 2, treble in next,
till the 11 spaces arc made; turn with 5 ch, tr into the second
treble of last row. Then make another space, 2 blocks, 3 spaces, 2
blocks, and 2 spaces. Follow the pattern till you have enough in-
sertion made for the side. Begin the next side by working on the
side of the last 11 spaces of the first side. Take care that you
work on the edge that faces the direction in which the inser-
tion is to go. The dotted line shows the turning row of
spaces at end of side; and these are the spaces into which the
first row of next side is worked. When all the insertion is
made thus far. work round the edge by putting 3 trebles into
each space.
In the example, the insertion is attached to the linen by the
“ Linen Crochet ” method; but it can be sewn to a buttonholed
edge of linen in the old way.
As the new wav is a great improvement on the old, I shall
describe it fully in Fig. 72b.
For the Narrow Crochet Trimming, either work
Fig. 37 or the trimming as shown. Pinch up the
linen along a straight line, and work dc stitches
about an eighth of an inch apart, with 2 ch be-
tween them. In the next row, work a dc into first
little loop of 2 ch, and 2 tr, p, 2 tr, into the second,
alternately, all along.

Fig. 72b. Method of Crocheting Linen and Filet Lace To-
gether.—Prepare the linen by drawing threads accord-
ing to the directions on page 22. Work 3dc on the linen, 1
tr into a tr of the filet, 3 dc on linen, 1 tr over next space
of filet. If the filet has an outer row of trebles, miss 2 trebles,
and put the tr into the third. It is best to do the thread draw-
ing one side at a time, in order to have the linen an exact fit
for the lace.
Fig. 73. Edging.
(See also Fig. 72.) —
This pretty little edg-
ing is worked the
long way on linen or
on filet insertion. To
work it on linen, pre-
pare the linen as de-
Fig. 73. —Edging.
scribed on page 22.
Then work 30 dc on the linen, turn with 5 ch, and make
10 spaces, turn; 3 dc into Ist sp, p, 3 dc into 7 sp, turn; 2
sp, 2 bl, 2 sp, turn; 3 dc into Ist sp, p, 3 dc into next sp, 1 dc
into each tr, turn, 2 spaces on the 2 blocks, turn, 3 dc into
Ist sp, p, 5 dc into 2nd sp, (3 dc, p, 5 dc on the 2 spaces below)
twice, 21 dc on linen with a p after each 3rd, except the last,
then 30 more dc for the next point.
Fig. 74. Fern Insertion.—This is easily copied from the
illustration. Begin with 51 ch, Itr into 4th from needle.
Fig. 74. —Fern Insertion.
Fig. 75. Trefoil Edging to Match Insertion (Fig. 71). —
Begin at row marked A on the chart with 63 chain, turn;
treble into the 4th, 2 more trebles. This forms the block at
the top. For the pattern work from Ato B (inclusive), then
go back to C for as many repeats as the side requires.
Fig. 75.—Trefoil Edging. (See chart.)


To work the corner continue from R to D. turning the
rows at the line of spaces, through which the dotted line runs.
Then work on to E, decreasing at both edges till only I block
is left. Fasten off. For the next side, join on the cotton at
F, and work the first row of the pattern into the row of spaces,
with the dotted line. This is a simpler mode of working a
corner than mitring, and can be used by those unable to man-
age the mitred corner.
To increase by 2 blocks. —Work 9 ch, miss 3, 6 tr in 6
ch, 4tron 4 tr (for the following block). To increase by 1
block, 6 ch, miss 3, 3 tr on 3 ch, 4 tr on 4 tr (for the following
block).
Fig. 76. Lettered Insertion for Bread-Cloth. —65 ch,
tr into Bth, ig more spaces, turn with 5 ch. When the
lettering is worked, put 3 tr into each hole along the
edges and 9 into the corner holes. Second Row of Border. —
18 ch, turn, miss 3 tr, 2 dc on next 2, 4 dc, p, 5 dc on loop,
turn; (10 ch, miss 3, 2 dc, then into loop 4 dc, p, 5 dc). Repeat
part in brackets all round, -working the last bar over the final
10 ch, and the beginning of the 18 ch together. Third Row. —
4tr in each loop. This insertion is intended for a linen cloth
to protect the loaf from flies and dust, when on the table. Fig.
Fig. 76. —Letter Insertion for Bread-Cloth. (See alphabet charts.)
73, or one of the deeper edgings, can be worked on the edge
of the linen. A similar insertion, bearing name or initials in
the middle part of a simple pattern, such as Fig. 74, or Fig.
72, is suitable for towel-ends. The chart shows how to work
the insertion, while the rest of the alphabet is also shown in
a cross-stitch chart, so that any name or initial can be worked
as an inset for any article of table or bed linen.
Fig. 77. Handkerchief Sachet. —The triangles for this
sachet can also be used as insets for tea-cloths, etc. Make
176 ch, turn, 1 tr into the Bth from needle, then 56 more-
spaces. The rows decrease by one space at each end; at
each turn, therefore, sl.st over the 2 ch and 1 tr of the nearest
space, work 5 ch, and put 1 tr into the following tr. At the
end of the row simply leave 1 space unworked.
In working the tails of the dragon-flies and the body of the
butterfly, the decrease in the width is more gradual than would
be the case if whole blocks were omitted at once. Not'ce that
the spaces on each side of the dragon-fly's tail are a little larger
than the others. To effect this, when working the fourteenth
row of the dragon-fly put an extra chain instead of the tr in
the space just before the blocks, and work 8 tr for the body;
then put an extra chain into the space on the other side of the
8 tr. In the 18th, 19th, and 20th
rows, there are 4 chain in the
adjacent spaces and 6 tr in the
tail. In the 21st row the missed
spaces are put in again, and 1
block worked in the middle. These
alterations are shown on the chart
by lines beside the middle block.
In the body of the butterfly,
from the 4th to the Bth rows, and
again in the 10th and nth, the
space consists of I ch only, the
other chain being replaced by an
extra treble on each side of the
body.


Fig. 77.—Handkerchief Sachet. (See charts.)
In all these pieces after the last row (which contains only
one space), work a row of 4 ch, dc into each space down the
sides. Along the top work 3 dc into each space, and 4 dc into
each loop at the sides. The next row is 5 ch, miss 5 dc, 2 tr
in next, and the last row is 5 dc into each loop, and 1 into the
second only of each two treble.
Fig. 78. Corner Inset for a Tray-Cloth, Bed-Spread, etc. —
This emu design is one of a set of corner-pieces for a supper-
cloth or bed-spread. For table linen, use a fine cotton, such as
Boar’s Head No. 36 (on reels), or Ardern’s No. 60; while for
a bed-spread, Boar’s Head No. 16 (on reels) or Ardern's No.
20 or 24 will be suitable. Only the emu is shown worked, the
other three pieces—the swan, the kangaroo, and the kooka-
burra —will be found among the charts at the end of the
book. There also is an Iguana Insertion, with an edge to match
these pieces, and this can be used to connect the corners, if
desired.
Begin the emu corner at the outermost row of spaces be-
hind the bird. Make 123 ch, miss 3, 6 tr, for 2 blocks, 31
spaces, 1 bl, 7 sp, 1 bl: turn with 3 ch, and work a simi.ar
row, but with only I bl at the end ; 9 ch to increase by 2 blocks.
Follow the pattern, making 10 of these increases, then, keep-
ing the wmrk at that width, turn this upper edge always with
5 ch for a space.
Fig. 78.—Corner Inset for Tray-Cloth or Bed-Spread. (See chan.)


Next work the openwork band on the beginning row, omit-
ting the topmost block; and if you arc working the Iguana In-
sertion, without breaking off continue with this piece, and
into the far side of it work the openwork band of the next cor-
ner. Work the corner next, and fasten off at the end of this
piece, beginning again with the open band worked into the
row of spaces, and continuing into the Iguana
Insertion. In this way you work right round,
joining the last row to the first corner with
a needle.
This openwork band is done with 2 ch
for the spaces and 4 tr worked into these
spaces for the blocks. This alters the shape
of the blocks and spaces a little, and gives
variety.
To join the linen and lace together, the
linen crochet method will be much the neat-
est and easiest, but any other method can be
used. I would advise that the crochet be
shrunk first, by wetting it in clean water, or
by washing it if it has become soiled in work-
ing. Press it carefully, while damp, under a
cloth after having pulled it into exact shape
and proportion.
Fit the linen inside the insertion. Draw
the threads all round (see page 22), and,
while working the double crochet round the
linen, take a treble at every third stitch into
the insertion, thus adding an extra row of
spaces to the lace (see Fig. 72). At the
corners, fold back the linen, work dc on the
bias, catching in the little corners as they come.

Worked in blocks, spaces, open and close
lacets. Begin the side at A with 100 ch, work
the pattern to Bi, then go to B2—which is
Bi in another position—and work to Bi, as
many times as the side has patterns, finishing
the side at Bi. On the 100 ch, put a tr
into the 4th and the. following 6 stitches, 5 spaces, 25
blocks. Turn with 3 ch, miss 1 tr, 6 tr, n close and open
lacets alternately,. 1 sp, 1 hi, 4 sp, 2 bl. , Begin the 3rd and all
other increasing rows by working 9 ch, miss 3, tr in 6 ch, and
one on the first tr of last row. Decrease by slip-stitching
over 2 bl. (See Fig. 100, page 61.)
To Mitre a Corner (see Figs. 79b and 80). —Work the last
row of a side (Bi) and in the next row omit the two top blocks,
turn at the dotted line, and work the following row' to the
bottom. In this way follow' the key, turning back at the
dotted line. When Cis reached, sl.st over the 2 blocks to X.
Make 9 ch to D, turn and work 2 blocks on the 9 ch, sl.st be-
tween the two spaces of first half, marked S and T, 3 more
. sl.st up the side of T. Turn back and work 2 blocks over
the former ones. Increase again, w'ork 2 blocks and 3
spaces, and for the 4th space do 2 ch, sl.st between
next pair of spaces of Ist half, then up to the
. point, and turn, working back with 4 sp and

Work the other half to match, beginning at the bottom, and
taking the stitches deeply enough to avoid making holes. Do
not fasten off, but work round the piece with dc, putting 4 dc
into each corner hole, 2 into each of the others, and 2 on the
side of each tr at the bottom. Second Round. —(8 ch, miss 6,

This brings the loops to the corner of the top six spaces; (8
ch, miss 4) 3 times, 8 ch, miss 6, 4 ch, dc in middle of petal;
4 ch, miss 6, 8 ch, miss 6; (8 ch, miss 4) 3 times; (8 ch, miss

in 3rd dc before the picot, draw loop through, 4 dc, 5 ch, 4 dc,
5 ch, 4dc into top loop, 2 more dc in same loop below. Work
alternate loops like this last one, and into the two middle loops
of petal put 4dc only. Fasten off.
The alternate petals are worked in exactly the same way,
except that lacet filling is worked instead of the square mesh.
The key shows pattern clearly.

is afterwards edged with dc, 8 into corner holes, 3 into all other
holes. A triple picot is worked in the middle of the corner holes
of smaller point. A part of the edge is shown without this row.
Worked in rather coarse cotton, such as Boar’s Head No. 16 on
reels, or 24 on
balls, this edging
makes a handsome

treble into Bth from needle, 13 more spaces, then 1 bl, 6 spaces, 1
bl, 5 spaces, 1 bl, 4 spaces. This makes row A. If no repeats of
the pattern are wanted, work straight on from A to F. But if
you wish to repeat the pattern —and there are two repeats in
the supper-cloth illustrated—work from A to C, then go back,
but omit the rows A to B inclusive, and work the rows D to
E inclusive instead of them, continuing with the row that fol-
lows B. Always pass over from C to D for as many re-
peats as are wanted, and only work the rows C to F when the
side is to be finished. In other words, Ato B only begins the
rows, and Cto F only finishes them. The remainder repeats
the pattern.
For the 2nd side, work the row A into the upper edge of the
end of Ist side, and continue for as many patterns as required.
Finish the row in the same way, and work the row A into side
of 2nd side to begin the 3rd side. Join the linen and lace by the
method described in Fig. 72b, and work Fig. 73 as an edging.

Work a row of 41 open lacets, then a row of close lacets. It
will be necessary to follow both the illustration and the key in
order to separate the fillings. Work the whole of the
part given in the chart, then turn the chart upside down
and work from the row marked by asterisks back to the
first row. The squares in the key, which show a black
dot, are to be worked as spaces in order to give a sharp
outline to the pattern. Finish with a row of close lacets, and
fasten off. Join on the cotton to the end of the beginning chain,
and work a row of open lacets along the two sides and the top
finishing at the other end of the first row. Continue, bv work-

is worked with a fine needle in Evans' Boar's Head Cotton
No. 30 (on reels), the equivalent of No. 50 on balls, or in
Quadrant Mercine No. 150, and in this size 'makes a cover fif-
teen inches across the bottom and nine and a half inches in
depth at the middle. Each side requires two reels.
Begin at the bottom with 420 chain. Miss 3. and work-
-139 blocks of three
trebles each, or 41 7
trebles. There are. there-
fore, three trebles for each
cross of the cross-stitch.
Turn with 3 ch, and work
2 blocks and the rest of
the row of spaces of 2
ch, miss 2, treble in next,
except at the end of the
row, where 2 more blocks
tire made.
In the third row the
design begins, and is
worked in blocks and
spaces till the fourteenth
row, where the central
lacet filling begins. This
filling is not shown on the
chart, as to represent it
would make the pattern
confusing, and the picture
show's how the lacet row's
begin, and it is merely a
matter of keeping the
lacets —one row open
lacets, and the next close
lacets, one above the
other. This lacet filling is broken by a column of spaces,
3 spaces wdcle, up the middle. If preferred, the same filling
as in the border can be used in the middle.
To decrease the row's, sl.st over 4, 3 ch, tr in same stitch
and in the following 2 tr; then work a block in the following
space.

On page 48 is a corner of Emu design (Fig. 78), and on
page 53 a Eyre Bird inset (Figs. 82 and 107). These two, with
Cockatoo (88), Iguana (101), Kookaburra (105,) Kangaroo
(106), Swan (108), and Border (89), are motifs for a bed-
spread or supper-cloth, and a suggestion for their arrangement
is offered on page 68. They may, of course, be used in other
ways. The working of one or two is given, and the keys to the
others are easy to follow.
Fig. 88. Cockatoo Border. —This border, when worked
with Boar's Head No. 16 (on reels), measures eleven inches in
depth. To work, make a chain of 187 stitches. Work a treble
into the 4th stitch, 6 more tr (this makes tw r o crosses, or
blocks ”), 1 " space ” of 2 ch, miss 2, tr in next, (a “ block ” of
3 tr, 1 “ space ") 4 times, then 4 blocks together—i.e., 13 tr
in a group, of which the first belongs to the previous space.
Then follow 33 spaces, 2 blocks, a space, a block, a space, a
block, a space and 7 blocks. Along the top always turn with
3 ch, miss the first tr, and work 3 tr into the next 3. In the
next and following rows the alternate blocks and spaces form-
ing the open pattern of the scrolls are worked a little differently
from those forming the edges of the scrolls and the cockatoo.
I give the exact working of the next two rows to start the
pattern properly.
2nd Row. —3 ch to turn, miss 1, 3 tr, (2 ch, miss 2, tr in
next) 4 times, 4 tr, 2 ch, miss 4, (4 tr into space of 2 ch, 2
ch) 3 times, miss 3 tr, 4 tr on 4 tr, (2 tr into space, 1 tr on tr)
twice, 30 spaces over spaces, 2 tr into space, 4 tr on 4 tr, 2

1 tr on tr) twice, 6 tr on tr, 2 ch, (4 tr into space, 2 ch) 3
times, 3 tr into next space, 4 tr on tr, 4 spaces, 1 bl.
A single space forms the eye of the bird, but this can be
enlarged by treating it as an eyelet-hole and overcasting round
it tightly with a sewing-needle.
To increase by two blocks at the bottom, work 9 ch, tr in
the 4th and following 3 ch stitches, and another on the first
tr of the nearest block. To increase by 1 block, work 6 ch, and
put trebles into the 4th, sth, and 6th.
For a bedspread, use Boar’s Head Cotton No. 20 or 24 (on
balls) or No. 16 (on reels). For a tray-cloth or supper-cloth,
use No. 36 (on reels) or Quadrant Mercine No. 150.

Fig. in. Daisy-Wreath Doyley.—Though thrown out of
its place in Section Number 11., the pretty little doyley shown
on the opposite page is well worth inserting here. To make it
use Boar’s Head Crochet Cotton No. 24, on reels; or Quadrant
Mercine No. 80. Make and join the flowers first. Ring of 10 ch,
21 dc into ring, join round; (3 ch, miss 2, dc in next) 7 times;
then into each loop put 1 dc, 4 ch, 2 d-tr, p of 5 ch, 2 d-tr, 4
ch, 1 dc. Fasten off. The middle flower that joins the
wreaths will be seen to have 8 points. For this, make a ring
of 12 ch, 24 dc in ring, and 8 points like the others. For the
number and arrangement of the flowers consult the il-
lustration.
The Central Filling. —Begin by working a tr between the
first 4 ch and the first d-tr of a daisy point; 4 ch, tr into the
same point between the last d-tr and the last 4 ch, 4 ch, d-tr
into the stitch joining 2 daisies together. Repeat all round
with loops of 4ch (30 loops in all). In the first round, join
the round; but in all the following ones, work round and round.
znd Round. —6 ch, tr in Ist loop, 3 ch, tr in following loops.
31 loops in all, the last being taken into the first.
3rd Round. — (2 loops of 3 ch, 1 loop of 2 ch) repeat.
4th Round. —All loops of 2 ch.
§fh Round. —All loops of 2 ch, but miss every third loop.
6th Round. —All loops of 2 ch, miss every 2nd loop, but not
the same loop as was missed in previous round.
jth Round.- —2 dc in each loop with a p between the loops.
Cut a seven-sided piece of paper, with each side of if inches.
(The easiest way is to draw a circle 4 inches in diameter, and
divide the circumference into seven equal parts. Curve the
sides very slightly. Press your lace, and lay this paper pat-
tern inside. The picots of central daisy in each wreath should
just touch the middle of each curved side. Increase or de-
crease the pattern to fit the lace, and cut out in linen half an
inch larger all round. Mark the outline of the paper on the
linen, and turn the latter back at the line. Before beginning,
lay the linen inside the lace, and put a light pencil mark where
the joins are to be made —i.e., at the picots and the places
opposite the joined daisies. Now work dc on the folded linen,
joining in the middle picots with a dc and the other picots
with 2 ch, on which work back with 2 dc, work the other joins
with 4 ch, join to the lace, 4 dc on the 4 ch; the joins between
the wreaths at the corners of the linen being of 6 ch instead
of 4.
At these last or corner joins before the 6 ch put 2 dc into
the linen at the same spot, cut away the turning on the worked
side, then work the join, fold down the next side, put 2 more
dc in the same place, and continue.

Treatment,” posted free.
The first essential in hair treatment is to avoid all
quacks and their nostrums. They will make the most
extravagant promises to get your money.
One extremely silly man said his preparation pro-
duced three inches of hair on a head which had been
bald for many years, in five weeks. Another said his
preparation was only used for two months, and the lady’s
hair had grown fully eight inches. These extravagant
statements prove conclusively that the makers of the
nostrums know nothing about the growth of hair.
It is not necessary for you, however, to make experi-
ments in the care of your hair. Thirty-seven years of
study of scalp diseases and hair troubles are behind
every bottle I supply, and I know every scalp disease,
and its effect on the growth of the hair. My prepara-
tions have the support of the discriminating public and
of members of the medical profession.
One of the leading Melbourne doctors says:—“If there
Is anything that will make your hair grow, Mr. Holland’s
preparations will. I have watched their wonderful effect
for years, and I have proved them to be of the most
genuine character.”
Dr. A., of Inglewood, writes: —“ Your Parasene treat-
ment suits my scalp and hair splendidly.”
Dr. F., of Melbourne, says;—“ I have come to you for
my scalp trouble, because I know you have made these
diseases a life’s study.”

Australian Designs in Fancy-Work.
A New Idea in Transfers.
With the idea of showing the value and beauty of Aus-
tralian flora in fancy-work, “ Everylady’s Journal ” has had
a number of designs drawn by expert artists and fancy-workers.
Altogether, over seventy designs have been prepared, cover-
ing every possible article that can be decorated by a fancy-
worker —from a handkerchief to a bed-spread.
In these designs the simple clematis-leaf, the wild-rose, the
Christmas-bush, the Swainson-pea, the kangaroo-apple, the
wild-raspberry, the she-oak, the flannel-flower, the nardoo, the
waratah, the eucalyptus, the wattle-blossom, the tea-tree, and
the lilly-pilly are used, as well as popular flowers like the daisy,
the forget-me-not, and the poppy.
A new idea in selling these transfer designs had also been
adopted, for, in addition to offering them singly at fixed prices,
they are collected into groups called “Outfitseach Outfit con-
taining eight or nine transfers, and costing half-a-crown. This,
of course, reduces the price of the transfers very considerably.
A typical Transfer Outfit contains, for example, the follow-
ing items:
Strip of two yards Eyelet Scalloping (i in.).
Strip of 52 inches Tea-tree Border.
Large Oval Table-Centre, or Tray-Cloth.
12 x 12 sheet of Violet Sprays and Baskets.
9x9 sheet of Daisy Groups.
Eyelet-work design in Christmas-Bush, for blouse, camisole,
nightdress, etc., with extra sprays for sleeves.
12 x 12 sheet of Good Luck Symbols (each about 5 inches
square).
Design for Cosy.
Photo Frame, 13 in. x 11 in.
The total cost of these bought singly (or similar ones
bought in any shop) would be about 6/1-, but the entire set,
as an Outfit costs but 2/6.
The whole of the eight “Outfits’ - are drawn up, and shown in
a catalogue which also contains scores of fashion and stencil
designs, and is published by T. Shaw Fitchett, 376 Swanston
Street, Melbourne. It may be obtained by sending a penny
stamp to the address given.
Each set of transfers comprising an “Outfit” is enclosed in
a large envelope, on the back of which will be found some
useful hints for the fancy-worker regarding stitches to use,
and colours of flowers, etc., in the design.
Some of the designs would do admirably for pen-painting,
an art which has come into vogue recently, and is a very popu-
lar one.
Any of the designs may be had stamped on linen ready for
working.
As all fancy-workers know, transfer designs are sold accord-
ing to size, and, if retailed singly, “ Everylady’s Journal ” ex-
clusive Transfers will cost about the same as ordinary transfers,
though in originality of design and in quality they stand alone.
But by grouping the designs into “ Outfits ” of nine transfers
each, “ Everylady’s Journal ” is able to place these exclusive
designs in the hands of fancy-workers at less than half the usual
price.
Perhaps you are not requiring the whole Outfit. In that
case any of these exclusive Transfers may be bought singly. Of
course, there can be no uniform price for single transfers, as
the price varies according to the size and originality of de-
sign. Under each illustrated Outfit in the Catalogue, however,
will be found listed the price of each individual transfer. To
order either whole Outfit or Single Transfer, use order form in
Catalogue, stating clearly number of Outfit or Transfer required.
On the next pages we give a few typical designs selected
from the “ Outfits.” Any of these will be posted at the prices
mentioned there. Send orders to the same address.

New Australian Stencil Designs.
How to Stencil.
Stencilling has become enormously popular of late years,
and whilst it is a revival of a very old form of decorative art,
the new designs are, on the whole, a long way in advance of
the old, stiff patterns that one associates with stencilling.
For example, on this and the opposite page are some ex-
amples from a big range of Australian designs that have been
specially made for “Everylady’s Journal.” (Full description
of the whole set, and how to use them, will be found in “ Every-
lady’s ” Fashion Catalogue, which will be sent free on receipt
of a stamp to cover postage by T. Shaw Fitchett, 376 Swan-
ston Street, Melbourne.)

includes the following items: One stencil-cutting knife, three
short-bristle brushes, four sheets of stencil-paper, four Australian
designs ready for cutting, one small design already cut, four

ton’s oil-colours. (It is well to supplement this set with a good

high-grade Stencil Outfit for 12/6 post free to any address
in Australia. Simply write “ Send Stencil Outfit as described

“RED C. OIL”
RELIEVES CONSTIPATION NATURALLY.
A woman —sick unto death with con-
stipation and auto-intoxication —came to
a great London surgeon. He operated—
cut away part of her intestines and
Joined up the ends. Result —sores ban-
ished, Nature’s functions restored —a
well and happy woman.
Operations are for the few, so the
same, great surgeon experimented till he
found that a purified mineral oil, used in-
ternally, would do what no other oil will
do-r-act as a lubricant and remove waste
products without acting as a purgative
and weakening the natural digestive
fluids. In other words, he found a natural
and safe treatment for constipation—
something new and entirely different
from harmful purgatives.
In response to a great demand, a tested
brand of purified mineral oil for internal
use has been placed on the market here
under the title of “ Red C. Oil ” (formerly
known as “ Red C. Paraffin ”), and is now
on sale by chemists and storekeepers.
Insist on “ Red C. Oil ” always to be sure
of purity and results. Substitutes may
not be sufficiently pure for internal use.
Properly taken, “ Red C. Oil ” is the
finest and most natural remedy for con-
stipation and its allied ills. Unlike other
oils, it is not difficult to take. “ Red C.
Oil ” is not a food —is not a “ cure-all ” —
nothing but a purified internal lubricant
that lubricates a defective drainage sys-
tem till it becomes effective.
“ Red C. Oil ” may be taken safely by
children and adults. Already thousands
of people In Australasia are using it as
the natural and effective remedy for con-
stipation—a blessing to thousands of suf-
ferers who have been slaves to harmful
purgatives. “ Red C. Oil ” has been
analysed by the well-known analyst, Mr.

for testing, as a result of which I am able
to declare it to be a pure mineral oil,
which is not inflammable, is not a food,
but is a purified internal lubricant, and
thus a natural remedy for constipation.”
Every sufferer from constipation or its
evil results—every person who wants to
break the habit of harmful purgatives—
every man or woman who wishes to add
to life by becoming permanently health-
ier—every mother who knows the vital
need of regularity in her children —should
