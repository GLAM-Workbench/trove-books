GOT HER (Ffl
/■• — ~ " vSilnfQjfc jfl§

HOW THE
F course you remember that rhyme about the Old
Woman who lived in a Shoe with all her many children.
But have you ever wondered how the Old Woman got
that shoe; for it must have been a very big shoe —much
bigger than yours or mine —if all those children could fit into it.
Well, once upon a time the Old Woman and all her children
lived in a green and white cottage, with a little red dog kennel at
the door. Of course there was a dog in the kennel; a little brown
curly dog. And they had a cat too a black cat with one white
paw. You know, he was the pussy cat who went to London to see
the queen.
And they had a pig also; a fat, pink, grumping pig: and a cow
a big black cow: and seven sheep, six white and one black.
Now the Old Woman and all her children and their brown
curly dog and their black cat and their pink pig and their big
black cow, and the seven sheep were all very happy together in
the green and white cottage, until one day the horrible North Wind
came along and just blew the green and white cottage and the
red dog kennel right away.
The Old Woman and all her many children and the dog and
the cat and the pig and the cow and the sheep hunted everywhere
for the kennel and the green and white cottage. They looked
behind bushes, under hedges, and some of the children even climbed
up the trees, to see if the cottage had stuck in the branches. But no;
not a sign of the green and white cottage or the red dog-kennel
did they ever see again.
Now the Old Woman was very upset for they
had nowhere to live. They had no beds to sleep
in and they had no pans to cook their meals.
They hadn't even a door-mat to wipe their feet
on; and the brown curly dog hadn't a bone; for

The giant took a knife from his pocket and cut a doorway
and windows in the shoe.


TALES OF THE SHOE
you see all those important things
had been blown away with the
green and white cottage. So the
Old Woman decided that they
should set out and find another
home to live in.
She lined the children in twos,
with herself and the curly brown
dog and the black cat with one
white paw in the lead, and the
big black cow and the fat pink grumping pig at the end, and the
seven sheep in the middle. And off they set to find another house.
Well, they hadn't gone very far along the road, when they met a
giant. Now giants are like boys and girls. There are big boys and little
boys, and big girls and little girls; so there are big giants and little giants.
And this giant was one of the big giants.
In fact he was the biggest of all the big giants; so big that the
Old Woman and her children could not see his head, because it
was right up amongst the clouds. And the giant did not see the
Old Woman and her children or the brown curly dog or the black
cat with cne white paw, or the fat pink grumping pig or the big
black cow or the seven sheep, for he was crying bitterly and hopping
around holding one foot in the air.
The Old Woman touched the giant's knee. That was as high
as she could reach and even then she had to stand on tiptoe. So
you can imagine just what a big giant he was. But the giant did
not feel the touch.
Then the brown curly dog, who was cold and hungry and wanted
a bone, bit the giant on the ankle, but the giant brushed him aside
as he sobbed: "I didn't know that flies could bite so hard." At the
same time he looked down and saw
the brown curly dog and the Old Woman
and all her children and the black cat
with the one white paw and the big
black cow and the fat pink grumping
pig and the seven sheep.

"Would you please let us pass?" said the Old Woman. "We're
in a hurry to find a new house."
The giant bent down, so that he could hear her and the Old
Woman asked him again. Then he said very politely. "I'm very
sorry. But before you go on your way, would you please take this
big splinter out of my toe? It is most uncomfortable."
"Of course, of course," said the Old Woman, who had a very
kind heart. So she took a hat-pin out of her hat and soon had the
splinter out of the giant's toe.
"Ah! that's better," sighed the big giant. "Now I think I'll just
put my slipper on instead of my shoe as my toe is still a little tender."
And out of his pocket he took an enormous pair of slippers. He
put one back in his pocket again and the other on the foot which
had had the splinter in it.
"Don't forget your other shoe," said the Old Woman.
"Oh, what about you having that for a house," said the giant
good-naturedly. "I'm sure it's big enough to hold you all. Just a
little present because you were kind to me. But wait a minute."
And the biggest of all the big giants sat down on the road and took
a big shining knife out of his pocket.


TALES OF THE SHOE
At this all the children were frightened and began to run away,
but the giant roared with laughter. "Fancy being frightened of me.
Giants don't hurt people." And he set to work with his knife and
cut two windows and a door in one side of the shoe, and you know
it was strange, but as the giant worked on that shoe, it grew bigger
and still bigger.
At last the giant sat back and looked at it carefully. "You 11
need a fire to cook your meals," he said thoughtfully, then, "here,
my pipe will do." And taking his big clay pipe from his pocket he
placed it in one corner of the Shoe House with the stem upwards
just like a real chimney.
"There you are," he said, putting the big shining knife in his
pocket, "If you make a garden around that, you'll have the finest
house in the land."
The Old Woman curtsied and said: "Thank you kindly giant,"
while the children joined hands and danced around their new home
singing merrily. And the brown curly dog and the black cat with
one white paw and the fat pink grumping pig and the big black cow
and the seven sheep all joined in the chorus.
And that's how the Old Woman got her Shoe!


\wiit
TERRIBLE thing had happened. The king had lost his ring.
It was such a special ring too; a Happiness Ring. As long
as the king wore the Happiness Ring on his little finger,
he and the queen and everyone else in the land, were
just as happy as could be
But now he had lost it; and every one was unhappy. He did not
know where he had lost it. He could not remember losing it and
could not think how he had lost it. But he had.
So the people were searching every-where in the land, for the
king had said he would give ten bright silver shillings to anyone
who found the Happiness Ring again.
Now Little Jack Horner heard Little Boy Blue, Jack and Jill and
Bo Peep and all the other Shoe Children saying they wished they
could find the king's ring. He heard them say that they would look
high and low for it. So Little Jack Horner made up his mind that
he would find it all by himself.
He did not really know how he would do it; but he knew that
he would. Anyway, for a beginning, he started out along the road
away from the Shoe. Then he remembered that he must look high
and look low, so he peered behind all the low bushes and climbed
into every tree that he met. And he hunted in all the bird's nests
too, because the ring might have been there. But it wasn't.
As he was searching through a bird's nest in a high tree, he
looked up into the sky and saw something. At first he thought it
was a bird; but as he watched, the something came nearer and nearer,
And then Little Jack Horner knew what it was. It was Witch Itclrev
Snitch riding on her broomstick, with her green eyed, black cat
Hunkeldooper riding behind her.

Little Jack Horner saw the witch and her green eyed cat
fly past on the magic broomstick.


TALES OF THE SHOE
Witch Itchey Snitch was the last of all the witches. Little Jack
Horner had heard all about her from the other Shoe Children, but
this was the first time he had ever seen her himself. So he looked
and looked at Witch Itchey Snitch and her green eyed, black cat
Hunkledooper as they flew past his tree on the broomstick.
Soon the witch guided the broomstick down to the ground and
she and Hunkledooper stepped off. Then Witch Itchey Snitch
stamped her foot three times and . . . the broomstick turned into
a house. Such a funny little house it was; like a webbly sort of
mushroom, with a little chimney which looked as if it would fall
off at any minute. But it didn't. Then Witch Itchey Snitch stamped
her other foot three times. At once a garden grew around the funny
little house. And just near the house was a plum tree covered with
big, fat juicy plums.
Jack then saw Witch Itchey Snitch take something from her
pocket; something which glittered in the sunshine. He knew at
once what it was: it was the king's Happiness Ring. Reaching into
the plum tree the witch hid the ring in one of the plums. Then she
and Hunkledooper went inside the funny little house.
Now Jack Horner had to do something and do it quickly, before
Witch Itchey Snitch came out again. Quickly, Oh! so quickly, he
slipped down from his tree and dashed across to the plum tree.
But now he could not remember in which plum Witch Itchey
Snitch had hidden the Happiness Ring. Oh dear! Oh dear! what
would he do? There wasn't time to cut all the plums open with
his little knife, for the witch might come out at any moment. So
Little Jack Horner took out his handkerchief, spread it on the ground
and put in as many plums as he could carry. Then he tied them
up and ran off, just as he heard the cottage door open and Witch
Itchey Snitch call after him
Little Jack Horner didn't wait He just
ran and ran and ran. So Witch Itchey Snitch
quickly stamped her foot three times and
turned her cottage back into a broomstick.
Then, leaving the little garden, she and her
green eyed cat Hunkledooper flew after Little
Jack Horner.
Oh! dear, Oh dear! how Little Jack Horner
ran. He ran until at last he came to the Shoe
House. Inside he dashed and shut the door.

"Goodness me, what's the matter, Jack Horner? asked the Old
Woman when she saw him panting so hard. "It s Witch
said Jack, almost beginning to cry. "Is it indeed? said the Old Woman.
"Well I'll attend to Witch Itchy Snitch," and she picked Jack Ho
up and put him in his little bed just as there came a loud knocking
at the door
When the Old Woman opened it, there stood Witch Itchey
Snitch looking, Oh! so angry, and her green eyed cat Hunkledooper
by her side saying; "Meaou, meaou."
Witch Itchey Snitch started to speak, but she was in such a
hurry and so very, very cross that all her words were muddlied
together and the Old Woman could not understand a thing she
said. But she did not want to listen anyway.
She said: "So you're Witch Itchey Snitch. Well, I hear you are
very clever. Now what about turning yourself and your cat into
; nto —" the Old Woman was thinking hard and then said quickly,
"-into soap bubbles." "Huh," said Witch Itchey Snitch.
"I don't suppose you can do it," said the Old Woman. "Oh, can't
P" replied the witch. And she stamped her foot three times and
umed hers If and her cat into soap There they floated
together in front of the door of the Shoe; a big soap bubble and a
little soap bubble.
Then, in a twinkling of an eye, the Old Woman took a pin
from her apron and pricked the two soap bubbles. And you know
what happens to soap bubbles when you prick them. They jus
vanish altogether. Well, that is what happened to Witch Itchey
Snitch and her green eyed cat Hunkledooper
"Now you won't chase little boys
any more," said the Old Woman, going
back into the Shoe House.
When she reached the kitchen she
found the handkerchief full of plums,
"lust the things for Christmas pies,
she said. "I'll bake a nice little one for
each of the children." She set to work
and baked ever so many Christmas
plum pies, one for each of the Shoe
Children.

Now the next morning was Christmas morning, and of course the
children had lots and lots of fun with all their presents. And at breakfast
time the Old Woman gave them each a little Christmas pie.
Little Jack Horner at once went and sat in a corner to eat his
pie. He put in a thumb and pulled out a plum and there, in that
very plum, was the king's Happiness Ring.
What excitement there was in the Shoe House when they heard
the story. The Old Woman and all the children at once went with
Little Jack Horner to see the king and give him back his ring. The
Old Woman also told the king all about Witch Itchey Snitch and
her green eyed cat Hunkledooper and how they had finished up.
At that the king laughed heartily and gave Little Jack Horner
his ten bright silver shillings, and a party, a wonderful party, for
all the Shoe Children.

OOR Wee Willie Winkie. His is a very sad story indeed
D And this is how it began.
One corner of the Shoe House was the bed-corner.
And this bed-corner was full of little green beds with gay
striped counterpanes. There was a different name written at the
top of each bed, because you see, there were so many children and
so many beds, that if they had no names on, they would certainly
have got all mixed up.
Now one lovely morning Wee Willie Winkie got up early, dressed
himself, then folded his white night-gown and red night-cap and
placed them neatly under his pillow.
The Shoe Children all wore night-gowns, because the Old Woman
never had time to make pyjamas. They took too long. And they
all wore night-caps, because night-caps were fashionable. Anyway
Wee Willie Winkie put his night-gown and night-cap under his
pillow and then he went out into the garden to look at the day.
It was the nicest kind of day he had seen for a long time, with
skippity-hoppity breezes and warm sunshine all over. It was such a
"just-right" sort of day that Wee Willie Winkie made up his mind
that he would not go to school. And he didn't. He went playing
in the wood.
But he had not been playing for very long, when the Old Woman,
who had come to look for acorns for her fat
grumping pig, found him. She was very cross
with the little boy for not going to school and
took him home to bed to stay there all day and
all night because he had been a naughty boy.
But Wee Willie Winkie didn't stay there
all night. Oh no! As soon as the Old Woman


The little goblins took Wee Willie Winkie by the hand
and they all danced happily together.


TALES OF THE SHOE JJt<&L
and all the other Shoe Children
were quite fast asleep, he took
a lantern down from the wall
of the Shoe House and, still
wearing his white night-gown
and red night-cap went back
to the wood to play.
A great big yellow moon
was shining in the sky and
Willie Winkie thought every-
thing looked much nicer than
during the day, when tne sun
was shining. As he wandered
through the wood, he suddenly
heard music; goblin music.
Willie Winkie followed
the sweet sound of the goblin
music. He crept closer and
closer, until at last he came upon a crowd of red-capped goblins
dancing and singing, whilst two green-capped goblins were making
music for the dancing with little violins tucked under their pointy
chins. Wee Willie Winkie watched and watched those red-capped
goblins dancing. In fact he watched them so much, that he forgot
to keep out of sight. And the goblins saw him!
Instantly the music stopped and the little men formed a ring
and danced around him. Then they took his hand and he danced
with them, as happily and lightly as a floating leaf. Wee Willie
Winkie just loved it.
But after a long time of merry dancing he said: "Now I must
go home and get back to bed before the others wake up." But the
rgd-capped goblins laughed and joining hands danced around him
in a ring singing;
"When once you've danced in a goblin ring
To the sound of our goblin music's strain.
You must stay with us and dance and sing,
And never at all go home again."
Then they seized his hands and took him deeper into the wood;
showing him all sorts of wonderful treasures. For days Wee Willie
stayed with the red-capped goblins and was quite happy, but at last
he began to think of the Shoe House again, and the Old Woman

who was always so kind to him, and of all the little green beds
with their gay striped counterpanes. He wanted to go back so much
that the goblins said he might, so that night Wee Willie Winkie
put on his little red night-cap, took his lantern, said good-bye to
the red-capped goblins and went back to the Shoe House.
He peeped through the window and saw all the children just
cuddling down in the little green beds under the gay-striped count-
erpanes and he saw that there was some one asleep in his bed. His
name had been rubbed out and somebody else's written there. He
could not read what it was, but it began with a "P". Sadly the
little boy turned away from the Shoe House. He knew that it was
no use going in, because there was no bed for him to sleep in.
Then suddenly he had an idea. He would go and peep in all the
houses and see if he could find an empty bed. And so he set off.
At every door he shouted "Are the children all in bed, it's past
eight o'clock?" And the fathers and mothers shouted back: "Yes
all the children are in bed." For they knew at once that it was
Wee Willie Winkie. They also knew that the Old Woman had
given his bed to another little boy, because she had thought that
Wee Willie Winkie was never coming home again.
Then Willie Winkie peeped in at the windows and looked at all
the children's beds to see if there was an empty one for him. But
no-where could he find one. So he went back to live with the goblins
and stayed with them all day long.
But every night he comes with his little lantern and wearing
his white night-gown and his
little red night-cap, and calls
through the lock: "Are the
children all in bed?" And
then he peers through the
window, just to see if there's
an empty bed. For little boys
don't like living with goblins
for ever and ever.

LITTLE MIS? MOPPET
O you remember the time when Little Miss Muffet was
frightened by the spider? I knew you would. But did
you know that Humpty Dumpty was to blame for the
whole affair? Well he was. Here is how it all happened.
Not far away from the Shoe House there was a queer crooked
little house with funny blue star-shaped windows. And in this queer
crooked little house lived a wizard. A real magic wizard!
Now this wizard was round and fat and wore a blue dressing
gown and yellow floppety slippers. And he was always very, very
busy doing all the things that real wizards do, such as stirring funny
smells in a big pot on the fire or reading things out of big fat books.
Humpty Dumpty could have told you a lot of things that the
wizard did, for he was a terribly curious little boy and was always
pressing his little snub nose against the glass of the blue star-shaped
windows and peering into the crooked little house. This of course
made the wizard very, very angry, for he simply hated people staring
at him. And, anyway, it was very rude of Humpty Dumpty. Every
day the wizard would open the door of his queer crooked little house
and chase Humpty Dumpty along the road. But he couldn't catch
him, for he was too fat to run far
One morning the wizard made up his
mind that he would catch that curious little
lad from the Shoe House, and he would
teach him a lesson he would never forget.
So the wizard hid himself in an old apple
tree, which grew just outside the queer
crooked little house. And just as Humpty
Dumpty pressed his little snub nose against
the glass of the blue star-shaped window,
the wizard jumped down from the old apple
tree, and caught him.


TALES OF THE SHOE
Humpty Dumpty was very frightened, especially when the wizard
chuckled in a horrible, wicked voice: "I've got you at last and now
I'm going to turn you into the biggest, blackest and hairyest spider
that ever was." And so he did.!
Poor Humpty Dumpty! He found himself with eight long, black
hairy legs and such a funny spidery sort of feeling all over.
The wizard chuckled gleefully, and said; "Now you'll stay a spider
until some one says a kind word to you. But nobodv likes spiders.
So no one will say a kind word to you and you'll be a spider for
ever and ever." And the wizard chuckled and chuckled as he went
floppety, floppety flop in his yellow slippers back to his queer
crooked little cottage.
Poor Humpty Dumpty! It was so funny trying to walk with eight
legs and feeling all so spidery too, but somehow or other he managed
to get along the road, feeling sorrier and sorrier for himself.
The first person he met was an old man, who prodded at him
with his stick saying; "Spiders eh! Spiders! Terrible things." And
Humpty Dumpty scurried away on his eight long hairy legs, before
the old man could prod at him with his walking stick again.
Next along the road he
met a great big black crow; a
big black crow who loved
eating spiders. Humpty
Dumpty just managed to get
away in time and then found
himself in a quiet wood. He
climbed into a tree feeling the
most miserable little boy, or
perhaps it should be spider,
in the whole world.
Then he saw someone
coming through the woods. It
was Little Miss Muffet carrying
her blue bowl, full of curds and
whey, and wearing her best
red apron.

When she saw the black spider, Little Miss Muffet dropped her bowl
and ran home as fast as she could.


TALES OF THE SHOE
Now Humpty Dumpty was
pleased, for he felt certain that Little
Miss Muffet would speak a kind
word that would let him turn back
to himself again. The little girl sat
down on a tuffet —that is a soft
clump of grass under the very
tree in which Humpty Dumpty was
sitting and she began to eat her
curds and whey.
So, very carefully, Humpty Dumpty lowered himself down by a
long thread, just like all spiders do, until he came quite close to
Little Miss Muffet's ear and then he said: "Hullo, Little Miss Muffet."
But before he could say another word, Little Miss Muffet uttered
a loud scream, dropped her blue bowl of curds and whey and dashed
off home, crying all the time, for never, never before had she seen
such a big black hairy spider.
Poor Humpty Dumpty! Would nobody say a kind word to him?
Slowly he followed Little Miss Muffet who had run all the way
back to the Shoe House.
Now the Old Woman who lived in the Shoe was sitting at the
door darning the children's socks. When she saw Little Miss Muffet
crying so much, she put down her darning basket and taking the
little girl on her knee, asked her why she was unhappy. Little Miss
Muffet told the Old Woman all about the big black spider and then
the Old oman said: Come now. Don t worry about it any more.
I'll give you another bowl of curds and whey. But if ever you meet
that big spider again, speak kindly to him, for how would you like
to be a big black spider and have all the little girls frightened of you?"
The Old Woman then brought another bowl of curds and whey.
But Miss Muffet did not go back to the woods. She stayed in the
garden of the Shoe House. And so it happened that Humpty
Dumpty peered around the garden gate and saw her. He thought
he would try once more to see if Little Miss Muffet would speak a
kind word to him, so he went a-hopping, a-hopping, a-hopping, until
he came close beside her.
Little Miss Muffet was terribly frightened at the sight of the big
black spider again, for of course she didn't know that it was really

Humpty Dumpty and she was just about to run away, when she
remembered what the Old Woman had told her about being kind
to the spider. So she said in a weak little voice; Hullo! spider.
And even before she had finished saying the words the spider
changed into Humpty Dumpty again.
"I'm so glad you spoke to me, Little Miss Muffet," said Humpty
Dumpty with a happy sigh, "or I should have had to stay a spidei
for ever and ever."
Then he told her all about the wizard in the queer crooked
little house and finished up with: "I'll never peer through a wizards
window again, 'cos you never know what he might change you into.
"And I'll always speak kindly to black spiders," said Little Miss
Muffet, "'cos you never know what they might be." Little Miss
Muffet and Humpty Dumpty then ran all the way up the garden
path to the Shoe House and told the Old Woman and the children
all about Humpty Dumpty's adventure.
