TO THE
CHRISTIAN PUBLIC
VICTORIA.
CHEISTIAN EEIENDS—In putting this
little book before you, to give you a short
history of our Prison-gate Brigades and our
Eescued Sisters’ Homes—what they are, what
they have done, what they are doing, and what, by
God’s grace, we hope to accomplish—l submit it in the
hope that, while you are reading its pages, hundreds of
hearts, themselves unseared by life-experiences, will
beat in harmony with other hundreds of hearts which
are rejoicing—that hundreds of eyes will drop the tears
of gratitude to God which fathers’ and mothers’ eyes
are shedding—that hundreds of knees will bend in
thankfulness to God, as are the knees of many parents
for prodigal sons and daughters rescued from lives of
sin and shame, and established upon the paths of virtue
and peace, and, best of all, having given their hearts to
Him, realise in Jesus an all-forgiving, an all-satisfying,
a personal Saviour—to the very uttermost.
There are those, alas! in the community who wiU not
believe in the probability of a change of heart; who
think that a life of crime once entered upon—the path
of vice once trodden—virtue and honesty are for ever
abandoned, but such pay little heed to the words of our
blessed Master, and to the evidences which surround
them of the truth of His words.
That the change of heart and purpose cm be brought
about we have evidence in the records of our Prison-
gate Brigades and Eescued Sisters’ Homes, to a perusal
of which I would direct attention.


It is not only a Christian duty, but sound policy, to
facilitate, as much as possible, the return of those who
have fallen, to a condition of self-respect, and of habits
of honest industry (the caution being, of course,
used to prevent abuse.)
In this manner, the occasional inequalities which must
inevitably occur under the most perfect administration
of the criminal law, may be in some degree mitigated,
and it is no small cause of satisfaction to have made, at
least, every possible effort to save those of whom hope
is entertained, from drifting hack into the vortex of
misery, sin, and shame.
But, thank Q-od, we have a ground of satisfaction
greater than that arising from having made an effort—
we have before us an accomplished fact, the truth of
which is vouched for by many well-known, living illus-
trations, that men and women, however depraved, how-
ever sunk, have been, and can be, by the grace of God,
changed in heart, mind, and purpose, and made reputable
members of society, instead of being driven again and
again to prey upon their fellows.
Every means whereby this change can be effected —
that is, every organisation adopting the only means which
is effectual —commends itself to the public interest, and
the only effectual means of bringing about the change
of which we have spoken, is—the getting Jesus Christ
in the heart.
To this end is our discipline directed. Under all
circumstances, and in all cases, do we impress on our
brothers and sisters that it is the love of God which
prompts our exertions, excites our sympathies, and
urges us on to the effort to do them good; and, when
once this is realised, their hearts are open to good im-
pressions, the seed of the Gospel finds good ground,
and springs up and bears fruit, not alone to the salva-
tion of the individual, but naturally exercises a very
beneficial infiuence upon former companions and old
associates.
But unless discharged prisoners and reclaimed women
are enabled to support themselves by honest industry.

they will assuredly make society support them, either as
thieves or as prisoners; and, while doing so, they will
corrupt, as well as injure, the innocent, and hence the
reformation of those who prey upon society is as im-
portant to the honest as to the criminals themselves.
The idea that the reformation of convicted criminals
or abandoned, women is hope)ess can only be charac-
terised as absurd. In the history of the colony there
is abundant evidence that criminals who have warred
against society for more than half their lives have, by
the grace of (>od, seen the error of their ways, and ara
giving abundant evidence of changed lives, while many
comfortable homes are now presided over by smiling
matrons who, not many years ago, were the profligate
occupants of dens of vice in the city or the Chinese
camp —yet the grace of G-od has brought about the
apparently hopeless change. Oh, Christian friends!
never lose sight of the assurance, “ With God all
things are possible.”
Since the establishment of our Brigade, there have
been assisted over 2500 persons (males), and of these
many are known to have led honest lives since,
having given evidence of a determination so far
carried out as to give assurance of victory ; and out of
over 1000 of our sisters who have been received, large
numbers are doing well.
With such facts before us, and such evidence as has
been supplied by the gaolers, the police, and the
Inspector-General of Penal Establishments, we are not
egotistical in claiming your practical sympathy for this
work. Egotism has no part in it—the egotist would
shrink appalled from contact with the scenes and
persons with whom we are brought face to face—’tis
God, and God alone, working in and through His
instruments, weak in themselves, but strong in the
power of the Holy Spirit, urging on to victory and
success.
Yours faithfully in Him,
JAMES BAEKEE,
Majob.


THE LIVING THIEF.
[Lines suggested through reading in the Wab Cry the account
of the conversion of an Australian thief who had spent forty
years of his life in gaol.]
“ Give me a chance 1” the old man cries,
With broken heart and tearful eyes ;
“ My time on earth will soon be done,
My wretched life will soon be gone.”
“ Give me a chance, I am sincere,
I won’t deceive you, do not fear ;
In gaol I do not want to die”—
This was his heartfelt, anxious cry.
The man of God, with loving heart.
In this man’s sorrows took a part ;
Friends gave the chance the old man craved.
And by this means the man was saved.
He lost his wild and hunted look.
When children sweetly to him spoke ;
He did to Army meetings come.
And said it seemed to him like home.
The chance he asked the Saviour gave.
For such a one Christ died to save ;
The old man knew his sins forgiven,
And in a month went home to heaven.
Oh, matchless grace I for all men free.
It saved the thief and it saves me ;
God’s love to man no tongue can tell.
It reaches to the verge of hell.
TO THIS HXSTHESSEH.
The Rescue Branch of the Salvation Army invites parents,
relations, and friends, in any part of the world, interested in any
woman or girl who is known, or feared to be, living in
immorality, or is in danger of coming under the control of
immoral persons, to write, stating full particulars, with names,
dates, and addresses of all concerned, and, if possible, a photograph
of the person in whom the interest is taken.
All letters, whether from these persons, or from such women or
girls themselves, will be regarded as strictly confidential. They
may'be written in any language, and should be addressed

H Summara nf
OF THB
PRISON-GATE BRIGADES
RESCUED SISTERS’ HOMES
■VIOTOHLI.A..
NE of the most important features in connection
with our work in Australasia, and that portion
of it which evokes the most wide-spread sym-
pathy, is to be found under the general head of
“ Rescue Worknot that we assume “ rescue”
to be confined to the criminal and vicious
alone, but that the term best conveys, in a
word, the nature of our operations in relation
to discharged prisoners of the Crown, profes-
sional courtesans, the victims of the seducer’s
arts, &c., &c.
This “ Rescue Work” was undertaken by
Major Barker very soon after his arrival in
Victoria, and has been continued with the
most satisfactory results, the number of those
reclaimed being so great as, gauged by other experiences, seems
incredible.
The movement was first started by Major Barker, on the Bth
December, 1883, when a small house was taken in Carlton for
THE PRISON-GATE BRIGADE.
But necessity soon arose for a larger house, and a move was
made to Lonsdale-street, Melbourne, where the operations of the
Brigade assumed such dimensions, that another move was neces-
sitated. This was made into


The old Detective Office,
at the corner of Flinders-lane and Kussell-street, where the
Brigade still remains, Captain G. Spicer being in charge.
It may here be observed, as showing the peculiarities of this
work, that, while former prisoners of the Crown are engaged in
the “Eescue Work,” the present Home of the Brigade is in a
house which wias formerly a terror to evil-doers—viz., the Detec-
tive Office; while our Home for Rescued Sisters, in Geelong, is in
the house formerly used as a hotel, attached to the theatre, the
theatre itself being our barracks.
The total number of men who have been met at the gaol gates
by the officers of our Melbourne Brigade is 2022,’“ and of this
number over 300 have been in residence for longer or shorter
periods, extending over three months, and of the whole number
who have been in residence, many are known to be doing well.
The average cost of maintenance per man, exclusive of rent,
gas, and similar charges, is not more than
IDs. per Week.
No idleness is permitted in the Home, and the inmates are put
to a variety of employments, such as Wab Cry selling, firewood
cutting, cleaning, shoe-making, tailoring, grooming, &c., and all
the inmates cheerfully turn their hands to any work given them.
The Home—indeed, all our Homes, for the same principle is
carried out in each—is in great favour with
Employers of Eabour,
and the difficulty is, not to find employment for the inmates, but
to find persons to fill the vacancies which employers are anxious
to fill with our people.
The number of inmates at present (June, 1886) in the
Melbourne Home is nineteen, and this is about the average ; but
this by no means represents the amount of relief afforded, for
our books show that since 1884 no less than
54,962 Meals and 19,018 Beds
have been provided for the destitute.
The average sale of the War Cry by inmates has been 1000.
Of late there has been a falling off, but this is accounted for by
the fact that, our corps having multiplied, so War Cry brigades
have multiplied, cutting off the sales by our brigadiers.
Of the men who have gone forth, some are now officers in the
Salvation Army; one is engaged as a florist; several are gardeners,
shoemakers, tailors, grooms, and so on; others, whose education
has fitted them for more responsible positions, are engaged as
storemen and clerks.
Of those who have stood longest, and proved their sincerity,
may be mentioned :—Lieutenant Tom. Foley, who renders help
these figures have largely increased since this book went into the
printers hands.—J. B.


in the Prison-gate Brigade and special night work, who, also,
with Captain Spicer, is to be found every morning at the gaol
gates and at the Detective Office, to receive any one desirous of
leading a better life ; Judd, also a lieutenant; Moody, sergeant-
major ; Block, employed by a publishing firm, well-known in
Great Britain as well as in the colonies; Jimmy Owens and
Jimmy Marshal, noted pick-pockets in London at one time, and
many others.
Our rules are strict, but not oppressive. Implicit obedience
to them is enforced ; but there is nothing whatever of the prison
about our Homes. Certain hours and conditions being observed,
the inmates are as free as air.
A real brotherhood exists among the inmates (especially among
those who are saved), and among all peace and quietness prevail.
There are some half-dozen re-vmions in each year, at which
the Major—with some superior officers of the Army—is present;
and at these gatherings there are not only all the immediate
inmates, but all the former inmates who are within reach are
invited, and cheerfully attend. A notable guest at these
gatherings is Dr. Singleton (widely-known as a philanthropist),
who has given us a hall in one of the worst slums of the city.
This hall has twice had to be enlarged, so great has been the
improvement in the attendance. The meetings here are led by
the oflicer in charge and members of the Brigade, and are held
every night, the same as in other barracks of the Army, and no
inmate of the Home, who is capable of attending, is permitted to
absent himself.
High eulogy has been passed upon this work by the Govern-
ment and the Press ; but perhaps no higher encomium could be
expressed than the following, from the Annual Report of the
Inspector-General of Penal Establishments, W. G. Brett, Esq.
He says : — Further valuable external aid in reclaiming and
assisting the inmates of prisons on regaining liberty has been
supplemented by the praiseworthy help of the Prison-Oate Brigade,
under the auspices of the Salvation Army.”
The work of the Prison-gate Brigade has not been confined to
Melbourne, however, for branches of the Brigade have been
opened in the three large centres of
Ballarat, Sandhurst, and Castlemalne.
These branches were established about the middle of 1885, and
are conducted under the same system as the parent Home in
Melbourne.
At Ballarat over 250 men have been met by our officer at the
gaol. Many are converted, and seventy-five are in situa-
tions, while 12,885 meals and 3243 beds have been supplied.
The most cordial sympathy has been shown by the people, and
an active co-operation has been given to the officer in charge.
Lieutenant Doherty,


But. if there has been a warm sympathy for the Prison-gate
Brigade,
THE RESCUED SISTERS’ HOMES
have not been behind, either in sympathy or in success. In
Victoria not only are the ordinary avenues of vice open to the
tread of frail womanhood, but
Chinese Camps
abound in the environs of all the large towns, where a loathsome
debauchery is carried on. Palatial brothels, middle-class brothels,
low-class brothels, and then the Chinese den, the opium pipe,
death, and, in too many cases, hell.
To stem this torrent of iniquity. Major Barker organised the
Sisters* Rescue Srigrade,
and, night after night, he and his co-toilers in the sea of infamy
are out seeking, in the slime of sin and despair, to snatch a
goodly pearl.
Our first Home was established in Carlton in January, 1884,
and was then transferred to Fitzroy, a further move having since
been made to Brunswick, where extensive premises have been
secured.
Something more than twelve months ago necessity arose for
opening
A Syphilis Ward,
and our No. 111. Home, for this special purpose, was opened, so that
there are now three Homes in Victoria—namely, one at Bruns-
wick, one at Fitzroy, and one at Geelong.
The Home in Gore-street, Fitzroy (since transferred to Bruns-
wick), was opened in February, 1884, as the
Female Prison-grate Brigrade,
and, since then, 699 have been received into the Home.
Captain and Mrs. Rash are in charge, with lieutenants, and every
day an Officer attends at the Oaol Oates to receive any one who
is desirous of leading a better life. At present there are twenty
women and three children in the Home. The discipline, as far
as may be, is the same in all our Homes, and the results are
equally gratifying.
The average number in No. I. Home is twenty; but meals
and beds are supplied to outside seekers of relief to the average
of 105 persons per week, and the average cost of keeping the
Home in full swing does not exceed £ll per week, including fire,
drapery, gas, &c.
The demand for girls for domestic service is greater than the
supply, and, even as is the case with our Male Brigade, so the
inmates of our Female Homes are in request by employers of
labour.


< The number of girls upon whom the Christian discipline of the
Homes has had a reclaiming effect is most encouraging, and the
matrons are in constant receipt of grateful letters from former
inmates.
OUR GEELONG HOME
Was opened on the 7th March, 1884, for the purpose, not only of
receiving discharged female prisoners, but as an outlet for our
crowded Home in Fitzroy, and it has proved a great success.
The number of women and girls received has been nearly 300, of
whom there are now in the Home (June, 1886) eighteen, seven
have returned to their husbands, twenty-five are in good situac
tions, known to be doing well, three have been married, and
four restored to their friends. This Home is, in a great measure,
self-supporting, for, of the total cash income of £575 12s. IOJd.,
only £240 2s. 3d. was contributed by Head-quarters, the balance
being contributed locally, and, latterly, it has been nearly self-
supporting. The average cost per head of the inmates, including
all charges, has been only £2l per annum. Mrs. Orr, sen., matron,
is ably assisted by her daughter.
OUR NO. 111. HOME
in Gore-street, Fitzroy, was specially opened for the treatment of
syphilitic patients. Many dear girls are rescued from their lives
of shame, but are tainted with this dire disease, and require
special treatment. For this purpose our branch Home was
established on the 3rd March, 1885, and since then the number of
inmates received has been fifty-five. The average number in
residence is fourteen, at a cost per head of 14s. Id. per week,
including medicine and attendance. Owing to the nature of the
case, the doctor’s bills are heavy, reaching as high as £lO5 for
the year. Yet the collections received by the girls themselves,
when convalescent, are most liberal, £lBO having been obtained
in this way, and it is remarkable that the percentage of these
girls who remain firm in the path of virtue, when reclaimed, is
very encouraging. In addition to the above sum, they have
obtained presents of furniture for the Home. Captain (Miss)
Carter is in charge.
Jesus once said —“ He that is without sin among you, let him
first cast a stone.” —John viii., 7,
For G-od so loved the world that He gave His only begotten
Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but
have everlasting life. —John iii. 16. ;


What the Late Postmaster-General Thinks
of our Work.
Postmaster-General’s Office,
Melbourne, August 28, 1886.
Mt Dear Sir,—
In response to your circular, received to-day, asking _ for assist
ance in your general spiritual work, I have much pleasure in at once
complying with your request, and beg to enclose you a cheque for
£5 55., with an expression, at the same time, of the most he arty wishes
for still further success in your efforts. As to your meeting on Monday
night, I would just like to say that the Salvation Army has found
granite rock on which to build surely in dealing with drunkards. _ To
preach a cold morality to men over-mastered by a passion for drink ;
to tell them of its evil consequences who know these consequences in
their own wretched lives and ruined homes—this method of dealing
with drunkards is like trying to stop a raging torrent with a straw.
The victims of drink know far better about its evil effects than the
respectable moralists who preach to them. But the method of the
Salvation Army to deal with drunkards as men who have souls to be
saved, and who cast out the devil of drink by the Spirit of God—this
is indeed building upon a rock. Men know the misery of drink, and
yet prefer drunkenness ; as a man once told me, he would pass a mile
of cups of tea and coffee to get one glass of brandy at the end. But
to teach men to love God with their whole hearts, and to realise His
love for us by communion with Him—this is to open their eyes to a
new world of happiness, and to fill those hearts with an enthusiasm
for God and man which bums up the dross of passion, and puts in the
place of a base physical craving a spiritual joy which expels that
baseness. The Spirit of God is a vital force, whereas mere morality
is a simple calculation of self-interest which breaks down the moment
a moral man is unwise. You teach men to rely on the wisdom and
strength of God instead of their own, and in that reliance comes a
perfect peace in place of unrest, and a perfect joy instead of wretched-
ness and misery. Men may be slow to recognise this truth, but they
will recognise it in the end. The Salvation Army is in favour, and
justly so, with many because of its good works among the outcast and
unfortunate; but it is because of its strong, definite faith, and its
high standard of religious teaching that the Army has been so suc-
cessful, and to burn that lesson into our hearts is to render the Church
and the world the noblest service. Again wishing you every success
I am,
Yours very sincerely.
JAMES CAMPBELL.

Letters from Chief Commissioner of Police.

Melbourne, 19th February, 1886.
Sir,—
In reply to your communication of this date, I feel that the
publicity which the Press has given to your general proceedings with
the Salvation Army in this colony, renders any formal statement of
recognition of such from my hand really unnecessary.
With respect, however, specially to the “ Prison-Gate Brigade
organisation, of which you are so prominent a member, I cannot hesi-
tate to testify to your unwearied exertions and their beneficial result.
My opinion of that organisation is fully given in the letter which I
addressed to the Hon. the Chief Secretary on the sth June last, and
of which I enclose a copy; and the commendation which I there
express regarding the Brigade as a body applies most fully to you as
the leader and energetic member.
I have the honour to be. Sir,
Your most obedient servant.

Chief Commissioner of Police.
J. Barker, Esq., Salvation Army, 75 Exhibition-street, City.
[Copt.]
Police Department,
Chief Commissioner’s OflSce,
Melbourne, sth June, 1885.
Sir,—
Referring to the conversation which I recently had with you
regarding the operations of the Prison-Gate Brigade in this City, I
beg to state that inquiries which I have made convince me that the
organisation in question is rendering very considerable service to the
community.
The Superintendent of Metropolitan Police, and the divisional
officers under his command, are unanimous in their testimony on
behalf of the Brigade.
Among the cases of reformation attributed to the exertions of the
Brigade, is one of a noted burglar and thief long experienced in crime,
but who was induced by tbe Brigade officers to change his life, and
for a very considerable period he has given evidence that such change
is likelv to be permanent. In another instance, a criminal has been
induced to confess a robbery, and by his admission to aid the cause of
justice, though his own conviction and imprisonment were a necessary
and an obvious result.
A thief of many years’ practice and apparently hardened, has been
induced to forego ms evil courses, and for a year past has rendered
good service in the ranks of the Brigade.


Two young men, who were thieves from boyhood, have also been
brought under the influence of this philanthropic organisation, and
seem likely to remain creditable members of the community. Many
other cases of like nature are known to exist, including many females
formerly following disreputable and dishonest pursuits. It cannot be
denied that in some instances the apparently reformed characters
lapse into evil courses; but, making due allowance for cases of this
kind, it is beyond doubt that the Brigade succeeds in permanently
reclaiming very many persons.
From their mode of approaching the persons they wish to succour
and from the circumstance that they have a suitable home into which
they can at once receive the persons they wish to benefit, the members
of the Brigade are more successful as reclaiming agents than any
other society, however well-intentioned. Whilst many benevolent
associations in this city are undoubtedly doing good work amongst
criminals (and one society specially devotes itself with much success
to the aid of discharged prisoners), I am of opinion that the Prison-
Gate Brigade succeeds in reaching a large class of unfortunates whose
depravity defies the ordinary measures of the charitably and humanely
disposed.
I have the honour to be. Sir,
Your most obedient servant.

valuable external aid in reclaiming and assisting the inmates of

OUR NIGHT WORK.
(By Commissioner Howard.)
Seldom has the curtain, which veils from the general eye the
awful vice and degradation in which so many live, been so drawn
aside as to allow of so much being seen in a little time as during
one night’s visit.
Major Barker, Lieutenant Foley, and I, left home to visit a
poor girl, who, we heard, was dying in a house of sin, in a low
quarter of Melbourne.
But before going to the house where the object of our visit lay,
we were called into another house, only two doors off, where we'
found one whose life of shame had come to an end at the age of
twenty-three, ;the victim of her own and others’ vices. As we
looked upon the cold, marble face —so young, and yet so old—and
heard how she was the child of respectable parents, and had lived,
and suffered, and died, with none but her companions in sin to help
and comfort, our were indeed saddened.
Amid words of abuse from some, and words of gratitude from
most, we passed into the next house but one, to find another
victim in
The last Agronles of Death,
only twenty-six years of age, dying within three miles of her own
mother’s house, and yet an outcast from society. Before she passed
away, we to her of God’s love to the fallen.
Pressed down with the awful sense that the very atmosphere
was charged with moral pestilence, we enter a house—alas 1 one
of many—where opium-smoking, and gambling, and lust, and
drink chase each other as the hours fly by. Among others we
find one who, three years ago, was a virtuous wife, but was
beguiled until she is found herding with 'harlots and Chinamen.
The opium habit has so grown upon her that the awful gnawing
and craving is consuming her very vitals, and opium she must
have, or go mad. She told us that it was not until she had con-
sumed 2s. or 2s. 6d. worth that the craving was satisfied—satisfied
only to return with increased power. I watched her as she lay
upon that pallet waiting whilst a young Chinaman prepared the
dreadful drug by the blaze of the lamp. Her eyes grew brighter
as they were fixed upon the poison—her cheeks fiushed—her
nerves seemed to quiver until she
Seized the Opium-pipe,
placed it to her lips, and never removed it till all was consumed.
We urged, begged her to leave this life, but tbe spell was too
powerful. I saw this same girl some time after, talked with her
then, but oh, how changed now I Unless saved by a miracle, in
three months she will sink into the grave. Lord, have mercy on
her soul, and on those men who have dragged her to such depths 1


From house to house, or rather, from den to den, we went, only
to find the same blighting curse prevailing.
One poor girl, who had just come down from the country, we
found in a Chinaman’s house, and induced her to come away with
us, much to the mortification of the three men, who regarded her
as their lawful prey, and who followed us with their curses.
Leaving her at the office, we continued our round,
Xiooklngr upon Scenes which cannot b
Recorded
except on the memory of the beholder. Words of warning were
spoken here, entreaty there, and so did kind words prevail that
we were generally regarded as friends of the outcast. Oh, what
unlocking of hearts, what stories of deception on the part of
villainous men, who had led these poor creatures to take the
first step to ruin. Alas, that upon the woman should come the
great shame and penalty. As one said to me, “ Ah, Major there’s
forgiveness for the man, but none for the woman.”
We were listening to one such, when, behind us came a woman,
who, seeing us, and knowing who we were, appealed to us for
help. She said, “ Look at my poor face; can you do nothing for
me ?” A jealous woman had battered her face until her eye&ow
was laid open, and the blood streaming down her made her a
most pitiable object. We took her to a tap, and with her hand-
kerchief bathed her face, afterwards taking her to the hospital to
have the poor face attended to.
As we were leaving the street, one with whom we had spoken
previously called out and asked us if we would take her. We
instructed her to go round to the office, where we met her, and
putting her with the other rescued girl in a cab, we drove to our
Sisters’ Home, where we left those whom God had helped us to
pluck as brands from the burning.
But why do we write this description of scenes so sad and
revolting? We have been accused of indelicacy because we
speak of them. But sin in any form, beautiful or hideous, is the
Blot upon God’s Universe.
The Salvation Army has set itself, with God’s blessing, to sweep
away the awful leprosy. The Lord has helped us and will help
us, and we want the prayers and help of His people. To rescue
such as those spoken of we have purchased “ Our new Home,”
and we believe that scores and hundreds who are now steeped in
vice will be brought to the Saviour, and restored to lives of
virtue and respectability, many of whom will, in turn, go out with
salvation to others.
We are much in need of funds to maintain our Homes. Come up
to the help of the Lord —to the help of the Lord against the
mighty.


THE FALLEN MAGDALEN.
In Capernaum city, long ago,
Jesus sat down to dine;
The house was Simon’s, a Pharisee —
He belonged to that lordly line.
A poor, fallen one, ensnared by sin,
Saw Jesus there, and she ventured in.
She had brought a box full of ointment rare.
To anoint His blessed feet;
Washed them and wiped them with her tears and hair,
While the Master sat at meat.
She was weeping over shame and sin.
And the outcast one was taken in.
When the Pharisee saw what she had done.
He thought a prophet would know
The touch of an unclean, fallen one—
Christ knew, and He told Him so :
“ You gave Me no water when I came here.
But this woman has given Me many a tear.”
Christ turned to the woman, who, weeping, stood,
x\nd said, “ Thy sins I forgive I*^
Her tears were dried with His smile of love.
For a new life she could live.
Christ’s heart for the fallen still doth beat,
Magxtalens still are washing His feet.
TRAINED FOR A THIEF AND BURGLAR.
A RECENT convert said, from the age of twelve to that of twenty-five
he was in training for a thief and burglar, and has had many
narrow escapes when on thieving expeditions. He once robbed
a garden and house. He entered by the window, stepped over a
man asleep in bed, passed on to the room where the booty was,
secured the gun belonging to the old gentleman, who lay asleep
in bed. Then he collared the valuables, intending to have
despatched any who might have opposed. Besides all this.
He had Sold Three Homes up
in drunken sprees, and had been all but frozen to death some-
times. He once hid a chopper away on purpose to murder his
wife, so completely was he possessed by the devil. He says he
ought to have been damned years ago ; he got upon his knees on
purpose to curse God. At last he was led, out of curiosity, to go
and see this Army that people were talking about. Everything
that was said and done took hold of him, and for over a week he
went about as though deranged, so deep was his soul convicted.
At last, overcome, at the mercy-seat he found peace and pardon.


OUR SANDHURST RESCUE WORK.
(By the Matbon.)
“ Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him,” is a sure anchor
for the Christian worker.
At last our faithful God has given us our hearts’ desire, and
there is one little recognised spot in the city of Sandhurst, where
The Homeless Wanderer,
the degraded outcast, the sorrow-crushed soul, may find a loving
word of sympathy —a helping hand towards a better life —a
stepping-stone to reformation. May the Lord, who despises not
the day of feeble things, make it a centre from which shall
radiate sunshine, and comfort, and real practical help to many a
storm-tossed soul.
Our work, for the last four months, has been of a motley de-
scription. It has not lain so much among the recognised outcasts
of society, although even in that time those who have grown old
in sin have been won over.
One poor soul had pawned everything she possessed, and
had brought herself to such a state of privation that she deter-
mined to end it all in
A Grave }
but the beacon-light of the Salvation Army Rescue Work fiashed
across her despairing mind. She came, and was taken in—fed,
comforted, and saved. That woman has been in a highly-
respectable situation for months —to all appearance a respectable,
Christian woman to-day.
Would to God, however, that our social skeletons were confined
to the few notorious streets that are shunned by respectable
society as plague-spots. We read with horror of some terrible
visitation of God, such as the London Plague, and think of those
so afflicted with the deepest sympathy. But, alas I no Asiatic
cholera was ever so widespread or so malignant in its effects as
are the terrible sins which are destroying the happiness of thou-
sands of families in this present day.
It is a sad fact that thousands of our young people are lapsing
from the path of virtue every day, and those who are watchmen
in what has been aptly styled “ The Dark Vineyard,” need to be
Argus-eyed in their vigilance,
A lady at the head of one of the Melbourne Rescue Institu-
tions told me a few days ago that within the last three months
she had placed 58 cases in the Lying-in Hospital, and that last
year she entered 149. Significant fact I
The work in connection with our local lying-in ward has
been exciting our most earnest efforts. Girls who have fled
20


from their parents, and, through other circumstances, have been;
without homes, have been kept till they could be placed in this
institution; and vigorous endeavours to prevent them taking
another step down the ladder of vice have been made.
One of the saddest outlooks of this phase of the rescue work,
is the terrible destruction of
Infant Xilfe
which is the inevitable result of these outrages of the Divine
law. In the case of most of the girls that issue from these
institutions, the child is tom from the mother’s breast—who
takes a situation as wet-nurse, or general servant, and puts her
own child out to nurse. To be deprived of its natural aliment
is almost certain death to the unfortunate infant. A few short
weeks, and for them life’s fitful fever is over. ” And a happy
release,” some will say; but, oh! to sit and watch the little
form —the convulsive dying struggles of one of these
innocent victims 1 It brings us fece to face with the mysterioua
conflict of human sin and wrong and God’s apparent silence*
But the day is coming when God will avenge His slaughtered'
innocents upon the selfish, cruel breakers of His laws 1 When
we contemplate such wrongs, we see the excellence of God’s
holy laws in the marriage institution, where the father is the
protector and the bread-winner, and the mother the life-giver
and tender, watchful guardian.
The dream of our life has been to save some of the neglected
waifs of society. Our hearts have gone out to this work with
an intensity which it is hard to express. God has put the crown
of His approval upon this desire also, and has given us the
immortal honour of taking from homes of want, temptation and
danger four children, in four months, and has helped us to place
them in happy Christian homes.
We praise God for the indications of our future life-work.
We would rather plod along amid toils and disappointments, in
the pursuit of such a noble purpose, than amass the wealth of a
millionaire I

A BALLARAT PRESS TESTIMONY.
STARTLING FACTS.
“Some queer characters are brought together at the dinner-table
in the quarters of the Salvation Army Prison-Gate Brigade
Home, in Barkly-street, Ballarat East. At the head of the table
there sits a strange-looking man, who, the genial lieutenant in
charge tells the visitor, is a converted infidel. He is a real
blood-and-fire Christian now, and he says that, when an infidel,
believing in no hereafter, he was always wretched, for, from the
nature of his belief, there was no such thing as hope in his heart,
but now, he adds, he looks forward to a future state, and even
were this illusory it can do him no harm.
A handsome young fellow avoids the gaze of the visitor, and
does not like to be seen in such a position. He has been a gay
dog in the metropolis, and is the son of a leading doctor in one
of the principal cities of England. He came out here for the
benefit of his health, and had enough money given him to carry
him home again, but he went in for luxuries in Melbourne, and
had a jolly time of it, until he found he had spent all his money,
and was left penniless and friendless in a large city, thousands of
miles from home. He got to Geelong, where a person advised
him to seek the Salvation Army Home in Ballarat, which he did,
and he was taken in. The doctor has been advised that all his
money is gone, and the young fellow is waiting for some more to
arrive to take him home again.
Whosoever will may Come.
There is a middle-aged man sitting next to the doctor’s son, and
his manner and conversation also tell of education and of better
■days. He was a banker once, and retired from the bank in a good
position, owning shares in his bank and others. He wanted to
increase his fortune, and speculated with ill success. Annoyed at
losing about half his fortune, he gambled, and was struck heavily.
In a few months he was left with only a hundred or two, and
then he started to drink, to make him forget his troubles. He
soon spent all his money in drink, and ran up a bill for about
£5O more. Then his suits of clothes went for a few drinks, and
one article, which he sold to a second-hand dealer for a glass of
whisky, may be seen hanging in the window marked,
<7s. 6d., Cheap.*
He got into the horrors, and was admitted into the Home in this
condition. The unfortunate man was in a fearful state for about
a week ; but judicious treatment soon put him right, and he
looks respectable now. His relatives at home are in a good
position, and some money will arrive shortly, out of which the
hotel-keeper’s bill will be paid.


There is an old, benevolent-looking man who stands at the
table, and bears an air of some importance. He is the cook of
the establishment. Had the Home not existed, he would have
spent most of his time, very likely, in the gaol, for he was a
vagrant, and had no means of living. At the age of the old
fellow, once a vagrant generally means
Always a Vagrant,
for, with each additional conviction before the magistrates, it
requires less evidence to send him back to gaol again.
There are othei-s at the dinner-table, all partaking of a most
substantial meal; but none of these have a very interesting
history. It must not be supposed that all these inmates live
their time in idleness. They are kept
Constantly Employed
if employment can be got for them; or, if not, they sell War
Crys in the streets, or do work about the house. The work is
of an interesting character, and Lieutenant Dogherty and his
wife appear the right people to undertake it.”

the never-weary-to-help-to-rescue lost ones, who is also treasurer

RESCUED AND SENT TO HER MOTHER
IN ENGLAND.
Mbs. Orb, matron of our Geelong Home, said, at one of our
meetings, “ This is a mighty work, my friends. What the law
has been unable to accomplish, what physical and corporal
Eunishment had been powerless to effect, the love of Jesus has
rought about. One woman, whose fall had been very sudden
and very sad, when found in Little Bourke-street by our Night
Brigade, was on the verge of the grave. She was taken to the
Fitzroy Home, and thence sent to Geelong, where Jesus set her
right, and she was then
Sent Home to Eng^land
to her father and mother, from whom a letter of thanks has
been received. Oh, mothers, who have daughters I Oh, fathers I
how had she fallen so low ? That was a mystery not yet to be
revealed, but she was restored. This religion is a mighty thing—
salvation worked out by God. The facts show what the Salvation
Army religion is, the results speak for themselves, and if the
people wished to see and examine on their own account, they
could come and see for themselves. The great majority of the
girls were giving great satisfaction.


OUR OFFICERS AT WORK.
“ And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.” Bless the
Lord for such an assurance. What a comfort such a promise is
to many of us who have had to pass through the dark hours of
affliction. Many an hour in the silent night we weep .in sym-
pathy with some of our sisters. The Lord knows their troubles,
and His ear is open to their cry. One dear young woman we
were speaking to was quite broken down. What with her deep
mourning, and her handsome face, her appearance was a very
sorrowful one. Cruelly neglected by her husband, she was
broken-hearted. When we asked her to come home with us, she
said, “I have a little baby waiting for me in its cradle at home”—
and what a bitter cry I Well, that took place at about two
o’clock in the morning. Comrades, pray for that dear sister.
Another dear one, left with two dear children to support, was
only too willing to give up her sinful life, but saw no other way
to support them. 0 Lord, help her 1
Two other women, dressed up fit for
The liord Mayor’s Carriagre,
said—“ God bless the hallelujah lasses, and the Salvation Army !”
They seemed to think they were too bad, and we too good. Lord,
help them 1 We pointed them to the Saviour. They seemed
thoroughly broken down. The Lord bless these women. We
have met with very little opposition from them. They are only
too willing, as a rule, to listen to us, but, 0 Lord, Thou knowest
that the burden of our cry is, “ Save them I”
Another girl, sixteen years of age, only that night commenced
a life of sin. Her excuse was, that her father had beaten her,
and turned her out of doors. She seemed thoroughly determined
to do wrong, and no praying and persuasion on our part could
induce her to do otherwise.
Many of these girls gladly listen to us, when we talk to them;
and a great number have taken our circulars ; but, 0 Lord, we
look to Thee, whence cometh our help. Save these dear sisters 1
Comrades, pray incessantly to God. Souls are perishing. Put
your shoulders to the wheel. If you cannot turn out and do the
work, assist us with your prayers, that the devil may be defeated,
and their precious souls may be won for Jesus. Lord, hasten the
time 1 0 Lord our God, in Thee do we trust. Lord, bless our
work, and make us more faithful in the future.

JESUS IS HERE.
I WAS thinking of the time, not long ago, when I felt the most
closely knit to the Lord Jesus. There is a two-storied house near
our Little Bourke-street barracks, which looks as if it was built
of brown mud. A poor, unfortunate woman has told me it is the
worst house in Melbourne. Well, I was going to the barracks,
in the evening, when the mistress of that house came out to me
and exclaimed, “ For God’s sake, come inside ! I have got a
woman dying on my hands.” I went inside, and saw three poor
girls sleeping off their debauches. Two of them were on one
sofa, mixed up like pigs, the legs of one flung over the head of
the sofa. Then I went up the rickety stairs, and saw the dying
woman. She had quite
Recently Come out of Prison,
after doing a month for her outrageous conduct; but, see I there
was no one to visit her except the salvation soldier—no clergy-
man, and she had no money for a doctor. What a scene of
squalor was that I Many a dog would hardly lie down in it.
The window had been blown in bodily by the wind the night
before, and there it lay, so that the sufferer might almost as well
be outside. The meeting of our Little Bourke-street soldiers
began. Every word of the singing, and a great deal of the
speaking and praying, could be heard at this woman’s bedside,
and thrilled through the whole dwelling. A week of anguish
had so brought down the poor creature that no one could recog-
nise her as the buxom woman who had defied us all to fight.
Now so wasted I Her cheeks sunk in, her eyes hollowed, and
lookine like coals, her legs drawn up in the bed through her
perpetual agony, and the gnawing of death at her stomach. She
had taken no nourishment for three days and nights, and had not
slept for as long, because of the orgies which went on continually
in the house. There she lay, groaning with every breath, Jesus
was in the room with us. I could feel His presence as keenly as
the breath of the air through the window. Somebody said the
woman was a Catholic, but in Christ Jesus there is neither Jew
nor Greek, barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free. I got gruel
and oranges, and had the satisfaction of hearing afterwards that
this food was the first that rested on her stomach for three days 1
Any one would Bring- her Beer.
or even brandy, but now she loathed the idea of alcohol. Never
did the voice of woman sound sweeter in my ear than did hers,
as I heard her muttering to know if I was still there. She went
to the Hospital, and quickly died.
Earnestness begets earnestness, and the world admires and
believes in it.


SOME MOTHER’S CHILD.
“ Oh, where is my wandering girl to-night ?”
Was the lonely mother’s cry —
She had hoped and prayed for the child’s

She kneels, and prays, and asks her God

But her Saviour loves her more ;
And if she’ll come to her home, or her God,

GLIMPSES OF RESCUE WORK.
(By a Soldibb.)
As a soldier in Little Bourke-street, I have seen a good deal of
the Kescue operations among men and women, and of the back
slums. I will here summarise cases of which I have written
more in detail in past numbers of the Wab Cby, and add some
that are fresh.
The Salvationist is welcome everywhere, and, among the recol-
lections I have penned, is one of being summoned to a leprous
tenement, called the worst house in Melbourne, for its reputation
of low debauchery and thieving. For two hours I was at the
bedside—upstairs—of a miserable woman, groaning in continual
pain, and she died two days afterwards in the Melbourne
Hospital. She was ebbing away when I knelt by her, and yet
had been unable to sleep or eat for several days and nights
through the orgies in the house.
My knowledge of the Prison-gate Brigade has made me always
enthusiastic in its cause, proud to number among my friends
many new life began with meeting the Salvation Army
officer at the gaol-gates. I believe I know forty men who have
been transformed from criminals into Christians by the Salvation
Army, and perhaps 100 more of so-called low characters have, to
my knowledge, been improved to a greater or less extent, infused
with respectability, sobriety, and morality, all implying a vast
reduction in the sum of evil that is wrought in our city.
A married woman, whose extreme poverty led her to earn a
livelihood by working in the low houses about Romeo-lane,
Juliet-terrace, and such localities, caused me to be sent foe
on various occasions of sickness or death. She summoned me
one Sunday night from our Temperance Hall meeting to a house
of evil surroundings, to pray over a poor, little, illegitimate
infant, who was dead. The house was up one of the low alleys.
There lay the infant in its coffin, and a motley company of
mourners, including the poor, young mother, joined fervently in
the prayer which I offered from the depths of my soul.
Perhaps the most cutting and painful of my experiences was
going to see a young girl, only eighteen years old—a victim of
Chinese vice. An abominable Chinaman, stupefied with opiuim
lay on a sofa in the bedroom where the girl was lying ill in bed.
She was maintained in a degree of luxury, which only made me
shudder the more, as I was informed that the doctor only gave
her six weeks to live.
One night I met Major Barker on his Little Bourke-street
rounds, and ha advised me to look into a house at the top of
Punch’sjane. There I found a wretched young woman dead,
md, although she had only been gone a few hours, the stench
was BO horrid that copious chloride of lime spread about could


not destroy it. A number of her female companions were present,
all the male bullies having fled in terror. A woman requested
me to pray, which I did, for those present, with all sympathy,
and the next day I went to the funeral, the burial being % the
Salvation Army. I will never forget the solemn time when
Adjutant Veal called on me to kneel upon the new grave, and
offer a prayer, with six weeping, so-called lost sisters around.
I specially call to mind one meeting, conducted by Commis-
sioner Howard and Major Barker, in the Prison-Gate Brigade
Home, formerly the Detective Office. A reformed burglar, after
many months of Christian experience, rose with joy in his face,
and exclaimed “What a change 1 What a change, my brothers,
since I was brought here by the detectives, and afterwards got
my sentence of eight years I” I remember, too, when another
burglar, of nearly forty years’ gaol experience, lay sick at the
Home, expecting his call from this world, and how he spoke to
me radiantly of the love of Jesus, He was not taken, but
another comrade, dear old Watson, was, and the last time I saw
him he had just arrived at the door of the Home, staggering
under a side of mutton, in a sack, a lady having given it to
him, in St. Kilda, and, weak as he was, he wouldn’t be beaten
in carrying it home.
A woman, who haunted our Little Bourke-street meetings,
seemed to me as utterly lost as a human creature could be on
earth. I recollect talking with her, in the street, when she was
a horrid object, in rags, with her head all bandaged up, and her
eyes frightfully blackened, through an assault. Yet I see her
now, transformed, as by a miracle, into quite a lady-like-looking
agent of the Salvation Army, visiting the sick in the Hospital,
and pointing them to the Saviour.
WHO WILL HELP?
Christians, awake I we have been sleeping long enough ; but
let us now arouse to a sense of our duties as children of the King.
Look at the hundreds in our beautiful city who are living a life
of infamy and shame? We must rescue them, or they will
perish. Oh, let us each remember that these dear ones are our
sisters 1 Lord, fill us with a love for the souls of these dear ones !
Dear comrades, your hearts would be touched could you but hear
The many Distressingr Tales of these Sear
Women I
When we speak to them about the precious blood of Jesus clean-
sing them from all sin, they seem to think they are too vile ; but,
praise God 1 we have His assurance, “He came not to call the
righteous, but. sinners, to repentance!” Thank the Lord!
Victory has been ours.


WHAT "APEMAHTUS” THINKS
OUR RESCUE WORK.
middle class brethren may not be unaware that in the
“ lower classes” there are three pretty distinct divisions.
For convenience sake, I shall call these (1) the working-
man, (2) the unemployed, and (3) the criminals. By the
working-man, I mean the comfortable, intelligent artisan
or manual labourer ; the man of trades unions, strikes
and eight hours; the man who is so happy in Victoria that
this fair colony was not untruly called his '‘paradise.” By
the “ unemployed” I mean that class who are ever in a state
of semi-pauperism ; the class who fill our benevolent asylums,
immigrant homes, and poor-houses ; the class who supply the
loafers and beggars of the city. This class is, happily, much less
numerous here than at home. The third class covers criminals,
prostitutes, and the children of such. Now these three classes
interchange ; but the move is chiefiy downwards. And though
it is rather hard to draw the line, it is very easy to detect the
sinking. Most criminals were once honest, most prostitutes were
once chaste, most loafers were once decent and comfortable
labourers. Concerning the passage from working-man to unem-
ployed, Ido not particularly write at this present time. That is
a question of political economy, of socialism, of riots, and of
hunger. But from the “ unemployed” to the “ criminals” there
are three doors —viz., childhood, gaol, and prostitution. Now, at
these doors the Army stands and fights, tooth and nail, to divert,
if not reverse, the current.
They strive to give all another chance; they aim at restoring fallen
women and gaol-birds to self-respect and honest and cleanly
lives. Let us give honour to whom honour is due. I have had
the pleasure of seeing letters from Messrs. Brett, Chomley, and
Berry, bearing witness to the great work the Army has accom-
plished.
Before giving a detailed account of this work, I should like to
remark on some peculiarities that have been brought under my
notice. The Army, so lam told, are allowed to hold services in
The Melbourne G-aol,
and unhesitating testimony is borne to the good effect of these
meetings. And ,yet they are not allowed to minister to the
Prisoners at Pentridgre!
Why, in the name of logic and common sense ? If their work is
bad, put it down in the Gaol; if good in the Gaol, surely encourage
it at Pentridgre.


GIVING ANOTHER CHANCE.
A strange difference has been pointed out to me, by the Army
officials, between the success of the prison work here and at home.
In England,
Once a Criminal, always a Criminal.
Try how they may, the Army cannot get employers to trust a
man who has been in gaol. The middle class are brutal, heart-
less, suspicious, sceptical of any reform. Here it is very different.
The Army bears witness to the fact that it has been nobly
seconded and aided by all kinds of employers, both big and small.
A gaol-bird here, of whom there is any hope, can always get
another chance. His secret is kept, his acts and habits are
watched and cared for ; he meets mercy and consideration at the
hands of the respectable community. Higher praise of this
colony I have never heard, and the men who thus act may surely,
as Christ said, expect mercy for mercy.
But to figures and facts. “Since the establishment of the
Prison-gate Brigade there have been assisted over 2,500 persons
(male), and of these many are known to have led honest
lives since, and of over 1000 women who have been received,
many have done, and are now doing well.” A wonderful record 1
Truly may the same writer add, “It is not only a Christian
duty, but sound policy, to facilitate as much as possible the
return of those who have fallen to a condition of self-respect and
of habits of honest industry—the utmost caution being, of course,
used to prevent abuse.”
THE PRISONERS’ HOME,
The head-quarters of the Prison Brigade (with a strange irony)
is pitched in the
Old Detective Office,
at the comer of Flinders-lane and Russell-street, So, too, for the
“ Sister’s Home” at Geelong; they have got hold of an old hotel for
their Home. Each man in the Prison Brigade costs about 10s.
per week, and is made to work hard at “ Wae Cey selling, fire-
wood cutting, cleaning, shoemaking, tailoring, «&c.” The “ Home”
is a great favourite with employers, and, in fact, there are more
offers of labour than men. The average number of inmates at
the Home is about twenty. Since 1884 about
55,000 Meals and 20,000 Beds
have been provided for destitute persons. The prisoners
have been passed off into all trades. The brigade has now ex-
tended its operations to Ballarat, Sandhurst, and
Castlemaine.
The “ Rescued Sisters ” have three homes —at Brunswick, Fitzroy,
and at Geelong. At the Fitzroy Home, now removed to Bruns-
wick, about 700 have been received, and many are saved


from a vicious life. The Geelong Home has received about 300,
and the Fitzroy Home (a home for medical treatment) about fifty-
five. All these homes have been liberally supported, the Geelong
Home especially being locally provided with the greater part
of its funds.
These works are works of mercy, if ever any work was. It is
needless to say that they deserve support. It is equally needless
to say that the blessing of the Most High must be on the society
that does such work.
For us, then, the respectable middle class, who can but wonder,
let us not abuse the Army, but, for the sake of this work at least,
help it with money and good words. —Melbourne DaH/y Telegraph,
WHO CARES FOR THE HOMELESS
• LADS ?
Notwithstanding the provision made in Australia for the
education of the children, it is a notorious fact that here, as else-
where, there is still a large class of so-called gutter-children.
Are the homeless and friendless ones to be left to grow into the
future criminals of Australia ? Is not proven tion better than cure 1
The Salvation Army has been looking at this question for
months past, but, on account of the pressure of the work, nothing
permanent could be undertaken. The Lord has, however, cast
this matter upon our hands.
Several Homeless Ones
are now being cared for, and we shall have to add another Home
to our list, and receive some more of those whom we know to be
destitute.
We have asked, “ Who cares for the homeless lads ?” We know
that Jesus does —that He wants His stewards to care for them, and
to get them saved. He said, “ Whoso receiveth one such little
child receiveth Me.” Thus as we take these
Friendless and Homeless
ones into our Home, and bid them welcome, we shall receive, in
fuller measure, the presence and blessing of Jesus.
Whereunto will such a Home grow? God knows. How will it
be supported ? God knows. We have received the cases already
in our hands as from God, and believe that He, by them, bids us
go forward. Therefore, we go forward.
We ask the prayers of all our soldiers and friends upon this
undertaking, and, as it is God’s work, we claim also their help.
It is the same old story of sympathy with Jesus which we desire

A THANKFUL ONE.
Akd Jesus, stooping down, wrote on the ground. . . • And
when He had lifted up Himself, He said, ‘ He that is without
sin, let him first cast a stone at her.’ ” Hallelujah I Our hearts
swell with gratitude to God for His saving and sanctifying power,
not only in our own hearts, but in the hearts of some of the dear
girls in our Homes,
One sister says (to use her own words) : —“ lam a miracle of
grace. I was a drunkard for fifteen years. I was a good customer
to the publican. I did not want to speak when I went in. The
tnisttess knew what I wanted when I put the billy-can on the
counter. She used to “ tick” it up, and if my husband did not give
me enough to pay the score, I used to do something desperate.
One day 1 pawned his ladder and tools; another time, I put all
my nice ducks into a bag, carried them to the publican, and told
tny husband the Chinamen stole them. What a mercy lam out
of hell! I cannot tell you the many narrow escapes I have had
from an untimely end. Once, while under the influence of drink,
my crinoline took fire, and everything was burnt off me save
my waist-bands. I had sense enough left, through the wonderful
mercy of God, to throw a woollen rug over my head, so was saved
from a horrible death. Another time, after indulging in drink,
1 was crossing a paddock to Moonee Ponds, when a wild bull
tossed me up in the air. The ground being soft, I was not hurt.
I frightened him by throwing my boot at him, while I scrambled
over the fence. I went on in my wild career until I was brought
to the Home, where I have found peace and pardon through
Jesus’ precious blood.”

A RESCUED GIRL’S STORY.
Out all night on London Bridge—Very near Com-
mitting Suicide—Sleeping on the Wet Grass—
Rescued and Saved 1
WANT to write a little about myself—of what I have been
||m and of what lam now, and how, by the power of God, and
through the Salvation Army, I have been saved from a
terrible fate, with an awful hell at the end of it; and I hope
that my story may show some who read it how merciful and
gracious the Lord is, and that none are too bad to obtain Hia
forgiveness.
Before I got saved I was everything that was bad. I used to
drink, and curse, and swear, and go to fairs, theatres, and music-
halls of every kind. Since I was fifteen 1 have led a sinful life,
and often, through my own bad conduct, I have had nowhere to
go to at night, and have slept anywhere 1 could creep into with-
out being seen by the police, once even passing the night on
London Bridge.
At one time, when I was in great trouble, I went to a lady I
had heard of at Camberwell, who belonged to the Young
Women’s Christian Association, and asked her to help me. She
wanted to know where I lived, but I could not tell her that, as T
had then no home ; but she kindly took me in for a week, when
I was taken ill, and had to go to the hospital. After being there
a long time, I had a nice place found for me by another lady,
where a chance was given me to do better ; but I was only there
nine months, for I wanted to do as I liked, and so I left it, and
went elsewhere.
While I was in this second situation, the thought came over
me once that I would go to the Salvation Army, so as I was near
the Grecian Theatre, I went in there while Captain Stonehill
was leading the meeting. Something he said made me go down
to the penitent-form and weep bitter tears of sorrow for my
wicked life. I rose, thinking I was saved, and for four months
continued to keep steady ; but then the devil got me in his power
again, and back I went to my old life, worse than ever.
It is always easy to go down-hill, and, though il had many
chances given me of doing better, I went steadily on the road
to hell.
I changed about from one situation to another, until, in my
last place, I led my mistress such a life that she could not put
up with me any longer. After going out one day for a holiday,
and coming home drunk, she gave me notice to leave —refusing,
of course, to give me a character. I took lodgings then, and
did as I liked. But my money was soon gone, and what was I
to do then ? No one who was at all respectable would look at
me. I could get no work because no one would speak for me.


and I then began to feel what a lost, ruined, and miserable
sinner I was, and to think that there was no hope for such a one
as I was.
One night, in July, I went to London Bridge, and stood
looking at the water, thinking I must throw myself in and end
my misery. I might have done so, had not a respectable
working man stopped me and spoken to me; but, though he
offered to take me home with him, saying that his wife would
give me some breakfast, I did not go. I turned away from the
river, however, and thought no more of throwing myself in.
A few days after, having no money to pay for a bed in
a lodging-house, I wandered down to the river Lea, and slept
on the grass by a ditch till the morning. When I awoke,
the sun was shining beautifully, though I felt very cold from
lying on the bare earth, with nothing over me; and I was wet
all over with dew.
I had had nothing to eat for three days—nothing but drink—
and I felt very weak and ill.
Later on in the day, I was coming along near the Congress
Hall, when I heard the Army band playing.
Jesus saves me now I
Oh, how I wanted salvation 1 I turned and went into the hall
with them, and that night I got saved.
At first I thought what I heard was too good for a miserable
thing like me ; but God spoke to my hard heart, and washed all
my sins away in the precious blood of Jesus. As long as I live I
shall never forget the peace and joy that filled my soul when I
realised that my past life was all forgiven, and that I was clean
in the sight of God.
A dear sister belonging to the Army took me home with her
that day, and I stayed at her house three weeks, after which she
took me to the Rescue Home which I shall love as long as I live
for the kindness and care I received there. The time spent in
the Home has been the happiest part of my life, and though I
have left it now to go to a situation, I shall never forget it, nor
shall I cease to feel grateful for the goodness of God, which led
me there.
I have been saved eight months now, and I am still pressing
on to win the crown which Jesus has promised to those who
“ overcome.” My one desire is to live for Him, and to work for
Him, and to bring other poor sinners to His feet.—English Cry
pnovE inEi: ai¥i> try me !
Do not find all the dark spots in a man’s life—do not be so ready
to tell a man his case is hopeless—because, having tried to be
good, he failed ; but let us, as Christian men and women, have
hope of every man’s soul, remembering Him who said, “ Blessed
are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.”

OuE Night Beigade at "Woek.


FINDING THE LOST IN LONDON.
(By “Mahlah.”)
“ I HAVE been in a good school, and feel better than ever.”
Thus spoke R J on the momingof her release from
prison. Kneeling by Mrs. Bramwell Booth’s side in the little
sitting-room of the Rescue Home, she told her that she had
learned, during her imprisonment, much that was for her good.
She was glad she had gone there, and was now willing to go to
service, or do any work that was given her.
It was a curious coincidence, but in the very prison where
Rebecca was confined were a number of brothel-keepers, who had
received their convictions under the working of the very Act
which Rebecca had helped to get through Parliament.
Every Englishman’s house is his castle, but, thanks be to God,
the brothel-keeper’s house is no longer his (or her) castle. The
Act is working marvellously on this undercurrent of society.
The door of the brothel is now opened wide by the iron hand of
the law, and the keeper and her company obliged to be on the
move continually.
The following is a story from the Salvation Army Rescue
Homes, which goes to show the state of things as they stand :
” Last week an anonymous letter was sent to Mrs. Bramwell,
stating that a young girl, A E , lived at a certain address,
and was leading a bad life, which she was anxious to leave. Her
friends, knowing the Salvation Army took such an interest in
these cases, had, at the same time as they put the matter in the
hands of the police, applied to the Rescue Home, and it was
requested that an answer as to the result of the inquiries would
be inserted in one of the daily papers.
“ Efforts were quickly put forth for the recovery of the lost
girl. Mrs. R ,in charge of the receiving house, went to
the address given, asked for the girl by name, and was flatly told
that no such person was known there.
“ Mrs. R walked home, praying for guidance in the matter,
and, while doing so, there flashed across her mind the fact that
a girl, recently in the Home, had come from the same neigbour-
hood as A E was said to reside in. She resolved to ask
this girl whether she knew A E , and was astonished by
the reply,
“ ‘ Oh, yes ; she was my companion. We left home and started
this bad life together. Do try and save her 1’
“ Further inquiry assured Mrs. R that A—— E was
in the house which she had visited, and had been told that no
one of the name was known there.
“ What was to be done ? It was decided that an officer con-
nected with the Inquiry Department (an ex-policeman) should
go, dressed as a gentleman, and inquire for the girl.


“He did so, asking for her by the same name, A B ,
and was readily admitted and shown into the parlour, while the
girl was called down to meet him.
“ She came into the room—a pretty young girl, in a
silk dress of the latest fashion.
“ ‘ I do not remember having seen you before, sir,’ she said, as
she took a seat at his side.
“ ‘ Probably not; but you see me now, and I see you,’ was his
answer, and the officer, having assured himself that this was the
girl he was seeking, threw oflE disguise, and told her his errand—
viz., that of rescuing her from her life of shame.
“ She listened attentively to all he said, and he went away.
The girl’s mother was communicated with, and taken to the
house. The keeper dare not shut the door against her, as she
could have done previous to the passing of the new Act, and
in a few minutes the mother and daughter were clasped in each
other’s embrace—the parent weeping over her rescued child,
and the poor girl clinging to the loving arms she had never
expected would clasp her again ; while the woman of the house
hurried out of the room with an unlawful visitor, whose pipe and
grog were left standing on the table.”
In the last few weeks, in answer to the applications of dis-
tressed friends, seven out of nine poor girls lost, in some cases
for years past, have been found and restored to their friends
through the agency of the Rescue Home, often the clue to the
whereabouts of the lost ones being so very faint and indefinite as
to seem to afford little hope of their recovery.
Some of the saddest stories in the history of human suflFering
come to the knowledge of the Rescue Home officers.
Only last week two broken-hearted mothers came together
from the other end of. London, each with the story of a little
daughter lost, one at the age of thirteen, and the other fifteen
years. Poor mothers, they still clung to the hope of seeing again
their loved ones, and had been praying, they said, “ that the
Lord would raise up some of His own people, who would take
the matter up as it had never been before.”
Thank God, it is being taken up by earnest and devoted
womanhood I May their eflPorts for the rescue of their fallen
sisters receive His continual blessing, and result in a mighty
harvest of souls at the great day I
No Respecter of Persons. —“ When Jesus had lifted Him-
self up, and saw none but the woman. He said unto her,
‘ Woman, where are those thine accusers ? Hath no man con-
demned thee?’ She said, ‘No man. Lord.’ Jesus said unto her,
‘ Neither do I condemn thee; go and sin no more.’ ” “ Let the
wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts;
and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon
him j and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.”


A Farewell Letter from the Chief
Secretary.
Chief Secretary’s Office,
15th February, 1886.
Dear Sib, —
As I am on the point of resigning my office as Chief Secretary,.
I take the opportumty of leaving on record my appreciation of your
services and those of your colleagues of the Salvation Army in
matters relating to the reform of criminals, the social regeneration
of fallen women, and similar matters.
I have the testimony of the police and the officers of the Penal
Department as to the efficacy of your exertions in this good cause,
and I therefore thank you warmly for the good you have been able
to achieve, and would encourage you to still further increase your
influence in the same direction.
I have watched with interest the growth of your organisation, and
the wide-spread influence you are exercising over the waifs and
strays of society, and cordially wish you continued success in your
labours, which not only redound to the benefit of those aided, but
add to the comfort and well-being of large sections of the
community.
Trusting you may continue to receive support and assistance
commensurate with the magnitude of the evils to be overcome,
I remain.
Sincerely yours,
GRAHAM BERRY.
To Major Barker, Salvation Army, Melbourne.
A HEARTY WELCOME.
Souls are here cared for and led the right way,
All are made welcome, come whosoe’er may ;
Xiet not the great weight of your sins hold you back—
Vilest of outcasts are now en our track.
All are entreated to share in our joy—
That true peace of mind that knows no alloy.
Invited are all, no matter their state.
On their answers depends their ultimate fate.
Now then is the time, your election make sure.
Accept once for all the salvation cure.
Reject not the warning that’s given to-day,
Make haste to the Fountain, be cleansed while you may—
Tea, then for the Salvation Army you’ll pray I

3Vt E M O R. Y
OP OUR DEAR BROTHER,
FRANK DAVIS
(Happy Dick),
Again the angel Death has called
A loved one from our side,
To leave this world of sin and woe.
In heaven to reside.
He once was far away from God,
A stranger to His love.
But God, for Christ’s sake, pardoned him;
He’s gone to heaven above.
For, like the prodigal of old.
He saw his sinful ways.
And, trusting in our blessed Lord,
Repented of past days.
The days he spent in early life
In wickedness and sin.
When bound by chains with Satan’s wiles,
And all was dark within.
But when he found that blessed peace,
Down at the mercy-seat.
He lovingly proclaimed the news
To sinners in the street.
He ever at his post was found.
Fighting for Christ, the Lord,
Warning the sinner faithfully,
And preaching God’s own Word,
And now he’s gone, we miss him sore;
We loved him very dear ;
We’re comforted to know he’s gone
To heaven, though we are here.
But on that last great day we’ll meet
In heaven to part no more.
Where all is peace and happiness.
On Canaan’s blissful shore.
He long will be remembered
By all who knew him here.
And, by the help of God, we soon
Shall meet him over there.
He’s left the Prison-Gate Brigade
To join our Lord’s Own Guard,
He’s won the prize, and now he’s gained
In heaven his sweet reward.


OUR COMRADES IN HEAVEN.
Brother J. Watson entered the Prison-Grate Brigade
Home on 4th February, 1884. He had been a most notorious
drunkard, had been convicted many times for drunkenness, and
served many short sentences in
The Melbourne Gaol,
but, when taken into our Home, and brought under religious
influence, he was soon conquered by the mighty power of God’s
love, and lived an exemplary Christian life, showing very plainly
that he had been “ bom again.”
From the day that he professed to have given his heart to God
he was always a very energetic worker in God’s vineyard. His
delight was in spreading salvation through the Wae Cey.
He used to say, “ I am no hand at preaching, but, thank
Ged I I can sell the Wae Cey 1” and he would travel miles,
early and late, all round the suburbs, until he was better known
than the postman or policeman. Being a coloured man, it
made him more remarkable, especially when dressed in his
soldier’s coat.
There was one thing that spoke well of his character as a
Christian. He won many friends, who came and saw him during
his illness ; and he had
A God Bless You
for everybody. Neither would he give up his work till he was
fairly compelled. “ Bless the Lord 1” he would say, “He has
given me strength to sell 300 these two days I” and, when
really not able to go, he would get fretful for fear his customers
would not get the Wae Cey.
Not only was he zealous in that respect, but, on holidays, he
would be round soliciting donations for the Home, in which he
was always very successful; and, for the short time that he lived
to show his light, he will be remembered by many.
Never did a drop of that fiery liquid pass his lips after he pro-
fessed conversion. Pipe and tobacco were all laid aside for Him
who bought him with His blood—who made him a child of God.
He loved to work for the Home, and in all his prayers “ Lord,
bless our Home I” had a place. Although he was not perfect,
still he grew in grace, and pressed forward toward the prize of
his high calling; and as he gradually grew weaker day by day, he
calmly and peacefully resigned himself to the will of God; and,
as the end drew near, he longed to depart and be with Christ.
He spent the last few days in the Melbourne Hospital, where
loving friends ministered unto him up to the last hour. His last
words were, “It is well with my soul.” Well might it be said,
“ This is a brand plucked from the burning.” He realised what he
had been drawn from, and used to say, “ God bless the Major for


taking such a miserable, drunken wretch as I was in hand, and
leading me to Jesus.” “ Happy day, when Jesus washed my sin»
away 1” was his favourite song. He died on the 13th April, 1885,
aged fifty-five, after being in the Home for one year and two
months. He was the first to be buried from the Prison-gate
Brigade Home.
This man once held a good position, and had three shops, but
family troubles drove him to drink. His property went, and he
himself was reduced to a mere wreck—his strong constitution
broken down. Little wonder that, his eyes being opened to the
mercy and grace of God, he spent the remnant of his strength in
His service.
One other good thing we can say of him—he well earned the
kindness shown him, by diligent labour, and, to the last he was
found “not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the
Lord.”
Gone, but not Forgrotten.
Frank Davis (otherwise “ Dick the Devil ”) entered our
Home 12th April, 1885, gave his heart to God on the Sunday
morning—the same day—in the Little Bourke-street hall. Major
Barker leading the meeting. Never shall we forget the influence
the power of God had on this man. A strong, strapping,
muscular, thick-set man, with a fearfully determined look, as he
listened to the testimonies that fell from the lips of the different
soldiers who had been saved from lives of sin similar to that he
had led, and then the change when he was spoken to by the
Major. He readily availed himself of the invitation to come to
Jesus —the sinner’s Friend—and down at the penitent-form he
cried aloud for God’s mercy, the big tears rolling down his
cheeks, and his whole frame electrified by the contending
emotions within. After half-an-hour’s struggle he arose a saved
man, knowing and feeling that God, for Christ’s sake, had
pardoned all his sins. Those in the hall who knew him—and
they were many—looked surprised ; they thought him the last
they would have expected to yield to the Divine influence, but,
glory be to God 1 His love is not as man’s love, and His ways not
as man’s ways 1
By his old associates this man was called, “ Dick, the Devil,”
so desperate was his character ; but here was the lion changed to
a lamb—the “ devil ”to a saint I From the day of his conversion
to the day of his last illness, he was an untiring worker in the
Lord’s vineyard—in and out of barracks— Wab Cby selling, or in
any good work his hand found to do. For weeks after his con-
version, hefeamestly sought after the blessing of iholiness, and in
a short time, while listening to Mrs. Commissioner Howard
speaking, he received the sanctifying power of the Holy Ghost,
and gladly testified thereto.
His old companions listened to his testimonies, first with
wonder, then with awe, but never with ridicule, for they knew


the man; and on one by one conviction forced itself, till, by
“ Dick’s” example and exhortation, many were led to the foot of
the Cross.
He was assiduous in the perusal of the Bible, and acquired a
Scriptural knowledge only to be attained by those who fervently
desire the aid and guidance of the Holy Spirit.
During his stay in the Home, his industry contributed to its
support £1 per week ; and, when working for himself, he always
contributed of his means.
His early training at his mother’s knee had been good, and his
impressions then obtained were never thoroughly eradicated.
His death was a brilliant example of how a Christian can die,
and his funeral, which was conducted with the ceremony cus-
tomary in the Salvation Army, will long continue in the memory
of the numerous throng who followed him to the grave.
“G-one to be with Jesus.”
Thomas Elliott. —The circumstances attending the death
and funeral of Thomas Elliott, who, though he died within the
walls of the gaol, is yet accounted one of our Prison-Gate Brigade,
afford pleasing evidence of the power and willingness of God to
save to the uttermost, and at the latest moment of life. And
they also seem to emphasise- If emphasis were desired—the
advisableness of affording eveiy facility for taking the Gospel of
the Lord Jesus Christ within the walls of our prisons.
Furthermore, they make clear the fact that culture is no
preventive of vice, for, the heart of man being desperately
wicked, neither culture, nor pride of birth, precept, nor example
can avail against the machinations of the Evil One, unless the
shield and buckler of Jesus be put on, with the helmet of
salvation.
Tom Elliott was a man of high literary attainments—had been
a schoolmaster, serving the State in one of the most honourable
and ennobling of its offices. But the demon of drink took
possession of him. Wife and children were forgotten, old
associations of respectability cast aside, and Tom Elliott found
himself within a cell in Melbourne gaol, literally without Christ
and without hope.
“All! Truth, thy triumphs ceased awhile,
And Hope, tliy sister, ceased with thee to smile,’
But, praise God! only for a while. After much effort, the late
Chief Secretary, Sir Graham Berry, and Inspector-General
Brett, were induced to give Major Barker permission to visit the
gaol, and there he found Elliott, racked with fears for the future,
conscious of dire offence against an outraged God—oblivious of
the promise, “ Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as
snow.”
Yet, blessed be God 1 the mercy shown the dying thief was not
withheld from the erring man in the prison cell. The words of
41


comfort spoken by the Major, which fell at first on listless ears,
were taken by the Holy Ghost, Attention was first excited, then
riveted ; the glorious messages of peace and love unspeakable were
comprehended, and Tom Elliott cried aloud for joy, that he had
found a Saviour who saves to the very uttermost.
And so he passed away 1 Breathing his acceptance of the
salvation purchased on Calvary, he went to the Saviour who gave
His life for his ransom.
We removed the earthly remains of our brother to the Prison-
Gate Brigade Home, and thence, surrounded by loving hearts,
his remains were conveyed to their last resting-place. Thank
God for such a Saviour I Thank God for rulers who permit us to
speak of that Saviour to the despairing denizens of our prison
cells I The sympathy of the Army did not end with Elliott’s
death and burial. The widow and orphans were affectionately
cared for in sickness and in health, and they, and such as they,
are still objects of watchful to the officers of the Army.
MAGISTERIAL HELP.
In the earlier stages of our work there was —and, indeed, still
is—a lack of sympathy on the part of many of the justices for
our general work. Our methods were objected to, and so forth.
But recently, at Sandhurst, a girl (only about sixteen years of
age, and of illegitimate birth) was brought before the magistrates
by a decrepid old man, who stated that she had been placed in
his charge by her uncle. She had left him and gone to live with
a Chinese. It appeared that she had been living an immoral
life for some time past. As she was sixteen years of age, the
magistrates reluctantly told the old man “ they could do nothing
for him ; but perhaps the Rescued Sisters’ Home authorities
may be able to do some good in the matter.” Our matron at
once took her in hand, and she is now in one of our Homes.
The police, too, have rendered us good service in this behalf,
and many a poor wanderer has been directed to our Homes by an
officer of police; and Mr. Hill, the City Court visitor, helps us
materially.
Such was the case in Kyneton, in April last. There a poor
girl was found by the local sergeant of police, amid the filth
and squalor of a Chinese hovel. She was only twenty years of
age, and lived by immorality. The sergeant’s sympathies were
aroused. He sent for our captain, enlisted his aid, and the
poor girl was rescued and brought to Melbourne, where she
was met by one of our staff, and forwarded to our Home in
Brunswick.
She is still an inmate of our Home, “clothed and in her right
mind,” and gives evidence of appreciation of not only the
earthly efforts made in her behalf, but of the higher and nobler
duty which calls her to the Master’s side.


OUR RESCUE WORK
In this colony the work in connection with the Rescued Sisters’
Homes and Prison-gate Brigade is progressing satisfactorily.
Homes for rescued sisters have been established at Christchurch,
Wellington, and Dunedin, while at Auckland there is an excellent
Prison-gate Brigade Home, under Captain Little. Here is a late
report from the
PRISON-GATE BRIGADE HOME, AUCKLAND.
“Number of meals given, 208; beds supplied, 46; persons
admitted, 10 ; discharged, 7 ; still in the Home, 11.
“ The Salvation Army Prison-gate Brigade is still continuing
with success its work of social Feform and benevolence. It does
not confine its labours to the city, as the following illustration
shows : —On Saturday morning last a Mount Roskill settler called
on Captain Little, the officer in charge, informing him that on his
road into town he had seen an old man lying in the fern, helpless
and exhausted, who apparently had been lying there all through
the previous night in the storm. Captain Little went out to the
locality indicated, and found the old man as stated, who was
perfectly blue with exposure. He stated that he was nearly
seventy years of age, had first arrived in Tauranga some months
ago, and had been wandering over the country ever since, being
unable to get work, though willing, both owing to his age and
want of strength. Captain Little brought him to the Home, and
tended and nourished him as long as he could ; and intends seeing
the secretary of the Charitable Aid Board or the Relieving
Officer, with a view of obtaining the old man’s admission to the
Old Men’s Refuge, as he has no relatives in the colony.’’
Captain Little says :—“ lam glad to say a good work has and
is being done in this Home. Many who have been in it, and are
now away, send me letters of thanks for the spiritual good they
received while in the Home. One young man, after serving a
sentence of two years in prison, and doing the devil’s dirty work
for over twenty years, was met at the prison-gate, taken to our
Home, spoken to and prayed with, and in a few days was found
at the penitent-form of our Parnell corps, seeking pardon, and
found peace to his soul. I got him a situation in the country,
and he writes to say he wishes Captain Wilson and others to
know he is still holding on to God, praying, and believing, and
receiving; also, urging his companions to make a start for
heaven.”
Good discipline is maintained in this Home, and, in addition
t« the meals noted above, outdoor relief is given to many poor
families.


DUNEDIN RESCUED SISTERS’ HOME.
Does God Answer Pbayee?
The matron writes :—“A little time back, a poor young lassie
was brought to my house. She was out of a situation, she said,
and had no money. On asking a few questions, I found she had
left her home, and was in Dunedin without friends of the right
stamp. The poor girl, lam afraid, had made friends of the
wrong kind, I got her mother’s address, and she left, promising
to come again at a given time, By-and-bye I heard from her
mother, who sent money for her passage home, and a real
motherly letter, giving her poor, erring daughter a welcome
home, and her mother’s love and blessing. In the meantime the
girl failed me, and I could not find her, I was grieved for her,
and asked the Lord Jesus to direct me to the lost One, Just
then a girl came to the door, to tell me one of our soldiers had
found this young lassie, and had*her at her own house, I thanked
God for the speedy answer to my prayer. She is now with* her
mother, God bless her, and help her to live a new life 1 Since
the Rescue Home was commenced here in Dunedin, we have had
letters from fathers, mothers, and husbands, asking us to try and
rescue their loved ones. We must thank the policemen for the
ready way they have helped us to find those whom we were
searching for,”
A Blessed Sight,
Adjutant Graham writes “ While visiting the Home yester-
day on business, I was just in time to see one of the girls taking
leave of the Home (where she had been about four months), and
going to a situation. She was called into the officers’ private
room, where she received a few kind, motherly words of advice,
and was strongly urged to
Live for Jesus,
and seek His help in her every-day work; and, after kneeling
together, and each of us praying for our outgoing sister (she also
praying herself, for she had learned to love Jesus since entering
the Home), a loving word of parting, and a mother’s kiss were
given her, and off she started, looking as pleasant, clean, and
happy as it was possible for any one to be. Immediately she had
gone, I remarked to the captain in charge that that case alone
was a source of comfort and reward for all the effort, expense,
and worry she had had,”
CHRISTCHURCH RESCUED SISTERS’
HOME,
The last report gives four girls as having recently gone to good
situations, while many of those in the Home have become truly
converted to God, and are now living changed lives.


WELLINGTON RESCUED SISTERS’ HOME.
In this Home there are usually from ten to fifteen girls, some
of whom are restored to their parents, while others go to live in
respectable families.
In Wellington, as in the other towns named, the public are
■exceedingly kind, and provisions, clothing, &c., are freely sent to
these Homes.
South; AusxnAuiA.
The Rescue Work in this colony is at present confined to
Adelaide, in which city some very encouraging cases have been
dealt with.
RESCUED SISTERS’ HOME, NORWOOD.
The matron writes :—“ We have had very interesting meetings
in our Home since last report, and
All but one are Saved 1
Our dear Adjutant, his father, Mrs. Dean, and some of the staff
have been with us. After tea we had a glorious meeting. Our
lasses spoke well, and told of the wonderful change God had
wrought in their souls. We were all able to hold sweet com-
munion with God, and from the beginning to the end of the
meeting we felt that God was with us ; and our hearts were filled
to overflowing as we listened to the testimonies of those who had
been rescued from sin and shame by God and
THE SALVATION ARMY.
Saturday, 22nd May, was a dear lass’s birthday. We will give
you her testimony— ‘ This is the happiest birthday I have ever
spent. I am twenty-four years old, and for' years past I have
either been in gaol, drunk, or going to drown myself ; but, praise
God ! to-day lam savea and happy. May God help me to prove
faithful to the end I’ ”
A LAWYER’S OPINION OF THE SALVATION ARMY
IN MELBOURNE.
Whilst travelling in the train from Hawthorn a short time
since, a gentleman whom I have known for some years, and who
is also the owner of some property in Hawthorn, said: —“ A
lawyer, well-known at the City Police Court, speaking to his
landlord, being in arrears with his rent, said, ‘ It’s no use denying
the fact, having proved to my cost, since the Salvation Army have
started their work on the streets of Melbourne, I have lost about
half my usual practice in defending the poor girls who roam our
streets nightly soliciting prostitution.’ " What a grand testimony
to the good work our Army is doing, under the command of
Jesus 1 It speaks volumes in itself,


NEWS FROM THE RESCUED.
From the banks of the Murray gratifying news reaches us of the
estimation in which our sisters, who have been sent from our
Homes, are held. One who was sent to Yielima, has proved herself
such a good girl, and has given such satisfaction, that not only
are her employers highly pleased, but their neighbours have
asked that they, too, may be supplied with a faithful help from
our Homes. At a recent cottage-meeting, held at Yielima, our
Brother Carroll states that the young girl above alluded to
testified to the possession of the great blessing, and she showed
that she felt what she spoke of. Hallelujah I
“ SINNERS JESUS CAME TO SAVE !”
What a repulsive-looking creature. Yes; but behind so much
sin there’s a soul for whom Christ died. He cares for such—His
heart yearns over them ; yea, if they will but come, the sin can be
washed away, and the “ best robe put on.” Let us hasten to tell
them so; for, behold, though a great way oflF, the father sees
them still, and, calling his friends and relations together, he
crieth out, “ Rejoice with me. for I have found that which was
lost. I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over
one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just
persons that need no repentance.”


ON THE STREETS.
SOMEBODY’S CHILD! WHOSE?
With eyelids heavy and red,
With glance which boldly meets
Each passer-by, a woman walks—
A woman upon the streets.
Tramp, tramp, tramp.
With heavy heart, forlorn,
A woman walks beneath the lamp
Who wishes she’d never been born.
Once a fair child was she.
So tiny, quick, and bright;
A mother’s joy, a father’s pride.
My God I how awful the blight I
With eyelids heavy and red.
With glance which boldly meets
Each-passer by, now a woman she walks—
A woman upon the streets.
Oh, Christ I can nought be done
To save this soul forlorn.
Of Thy sister who walks in the madding streets.
Who wishes she’d never been born ?
Lord, go with me to-night.
Thy feet have been weary and worn ;
Thou knowest the sin. Thou knowest the blight.
Thou lovest this woman forlorn.
Give me the power to draw
This soul from sin and shame—
From the madding streets, from the din and roar,
Oh, call Thy child by name I
Lord, here am I, send me
To do Thy will, 0 God I
To seek the lost and set them free
From sin and the devil’s rod.
Good News. —“ And the King shall answer and say unto them :
‘ Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of
the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.’ ”
Matthew XXV. 40.


A WONDERFUL TESTIMONY.
And Jesus said unto her —Thy sins, which were many, are all forgiven thee ;
go in peace, and sin no more I
“ I HAD kind parents. When I was twelve years of age, my
father died. He was much respected. I well remember every
shop in the place was closed the day he was buried. But, against
my dear mother’s wishes, at the age of fifteen I was engaged as
barmaid in a hotel. For some time I kept myself respectable;
but I took another situation, where I got high wages; and nay
duties were to serve in the bar, and dance of an evening. While
there, I was induced by a gentleman of position to reside in one
of the suburbs, where he could visit me. He kept me in silks
and jewellery, also a carriage whenever I required it, and a ser-
vant to attend me. But, with all these luxuries, I was very
miserable, and often had a bottle of brandy to drown my con-
science when I thought of my dear mother. One day, while
walking towards the beach, I saw an accident; a lady was thrown
out of a buggy, and severely hurt. This led me to think seriously
of my wicked life. If anything happened to me.
What would become of my Soul f
I left all the grandeur behind me, and went far away up the
country, where I got on very well for a short time, until I got
acquainted with a man who made me an offer of marriage. I
thought he was respectable and kind, and that he would make
me a good husband. We were married by a Wesleyan minister ;
and for some months I was happy and comfortable, and used to
attend at church, although not saved. But one day, to my great
dismay, letters came from England, and I discovered that my
husband had a wife and two young children at home. My heart
was broken. I packed up my clothes and left him. He followed
me, and tried hard to get me back ; but I would not go. I came
to Melbourne, and for a time was on the stage as ballet dancer.
Sometimes I drank too much ; and one day, feeling very miser-
able, and that 1 had nothing to live for, I got three penny-worth
of sugar of lead, and swallowed it; but, being an over-dose, my
life was spared. But I felt I was
A Nuisance to Evebybody,
and, after a while, again attempted suicide by jumping into the
river; but, having a black silk dress on, a man near the boat-
house saw me floating on the water, and came and rescued me
from a watery grave, and an awful hell. I could relate many
instances of God’s mercy and forbearance towards me. I praise
Him to-day that ever I came to the Brunswick Home. I had a
bard struggle to leave my old companions ; but two of God’s
servants, from the Salvation Army Rescue Brigade asked me to
come. I feel afraid to look back on my past life. I can only
look to my dear Saviour, who ‘ came not to call the righteous,
but sinners to repentance.’ ”


“THE ARGUS” ON THE PRISON-GATE
BRIGADE.
The ABGfus of 13th February, 1885, containa a very intereating
article on the above subject, and from it we quote the following:—
“ Those who are induced to join the Prison-gate Brigade are at
once put in a position to live without resort to crime. Situations
are procured for a large proportion of them, and some, who display
special aptitude for the work, become valuable salaried officers.
It has been found, I am told, that Prisoners’ Aid Societies, such
as those in operation in Great Britain, are not so effective as the
plan pursued by the Salvation Army.
THE SALVATION ARMY PLAN
is for an officer who has himself been a criminal to meet the
discharged prisoner at the prison gate. Telling him his own
experiences, and how he has been benefited by the aid of the
Army, he easily enrols in the Prison-gate Brigade a new recruit,
who has sympathetic surroundings from the first. By-and-bye
the recruit, if there is any promising material in him, reaches a
respectable position, from which vicious associates are powerless
to draw him. In its management of the Prison-gate Brigade,
the Salvation Army holds out a helping hand to the fallen in a
manner which has very reasonable prospects of resulting in a
marked diminution of crime.”
A ROYAL INVITATION.
We have a Home of refuge.
And fain would have it known
To every fallen sister
In city and in town
Would any poor, deceived one
Forsake her life of sin.
She may be sure we’ll give her
A joyful welcome in.
No bolts or bars shall bind her.
She shall right happy be.
And a mother’s love enjoy.
With tender sympathy.
We’ll point her to the Saviour,
Who seeks to save the lost.
And came down to redeem her.
Although His life it cost.
Then come, poor, burdened sister.
Oh, longer don’t delay.
For this is the accepted time.
And this salvation’s day.


A LETTER FROM A FRIEND.
RETHREN IN CHRIST—We who are one in Christ—saved
by faith in the same Redeemer —kept by the same Divine-
power of God —cleansed and purified by the power of the
same Holy Spirit—hope to be more and more like Jesus here,
and to be with and enjoy Him for ever.
When at your barracks (the old Detective Office) recently,
seeing one of your comrades, who was in a dying state, but rejoic-
ing in hope of eternal glory, I promised to write to the whole
Brigade a few words of advice and encouragement.
Your true friend. Major Barker, who formed the Brigade, and
well deserves the name of the prisoners’ friend, has, for some
months, accompanied me to the Melbourne Gaol on Saturday
afternoons, where we have 100 women (Protestants) in one Bible
class, and about the same number of men in another. The power
of the Holy Spirit seems to rest on every meeting. Many hold up
their hands, in order to be prayed for. Several tell from time to
time, that they have rest and peace of heart through Jesus Christ.
The deep attention and hearty singing of Sankey’s hymns, and
the great desire manifested to obtain tracts, periodicals, hymn
books, and portions of Scripture are increasing more and more,
and many of the men will, we expect, join the Brigade when free
men.
I cannot advise you more practically than by telling you thaf*
I have travelled on the same road, and, ever since, have been
preserved and kept by grace. My blessed Lord found me in a
state of despair and dread of being lost for ever, in October, 1827,.
I had previously, like some of you, tried to save myself, in vain.
He showed me God’s love in the gift of eternal life, through
Christ’s atoning blood, shed for sinners. On this I rested, and
found perfect peace.
My joy was so great when I experienced deliverance and for-
giveness, and my sense of gratitude to Him for His wondrous love
and mercy so overwhelming that I consecrated all I had and was
to Him.
I resolved to keep short accounts with my God—so when I said)
or did wrong I went at once and confessed it, asking forgiveness,
and went on my way rejoicing and more watchful.
I also resolved, by God’s help, to attend to whatever duty pre-
sented itself—never to let pleasure or amusement draw me from
it, even if the duty was arduous, and required self-denial.
I also resolved to spend my life in being useful to others. This
text often struck me, “ He that hath to him shall be given, and
he shall have more abundantly”—that is, improve a little grace,
and it will become greater ; be faithful in a little, and then you
will be faithful in much.


I also always felt a loving pity for backsliders. I saw maDy-
Christian people pass them by, “on the other side.” God
inclined my heart, early in my heavenly career, to seek them,
and bring them again to the Fountain. Some hundreds of these
I found in their misery and wretchedness. Some had taken
offence ; some were unkindly treated, as they thought; some fell
into sin by drink, or other besetting sin.
Now, dear fellow-soldiers, “be kindly affectioned one to
another,” and, “ if a brother be overtaken in a fault, restore such
a one in the spirit of meekness.” Remember, you may be
tempted aud fall yourself, if not watchful and prayerful. “ Love
thinketh no evil.”,
I have found the greatest comfort in reading and meditating
on the Holy Scriptures. The steady, regular practice of this,,
together with committing choice portions of the Bible, and also
of special hymns to memory, has proved a blessing to me.
Should you ever have families, build up a family altar, where
the sacrifice of prayer and praise will be offered up night and
morning, and your little ones taught strict obedience to their
parents, and to love their dear Saviour.
Thus sanctified wholly (in spirit, soul, and body), and loving
God your Saviour with an undivided heart, you will be able,
under all circumstances, to “rejoice evermore, pray without
ceasing, and in everything give thanks.”
I am now nearing my eightieth year, and soon may be called
home. Till then, however, by God’s grace, all shall be for Jesus
only.
I have constantly visited gaols and watch-houses for over fifty-
five years, and seen large numbers savingly converted in them,
especially in Newgate, Dublin, and Pentridge penal
which last I visited more than thirty years ago, and had a large
Bible class in the open air, after I had conducted two meetings
of from 400 to 500 prisoners.
When I left, a saved prisoner continued it, and now one of
them has two large Bible classes, and many of the men are
saved.
The men long for Major Barker’s again visiting them, if
possible, weekly, or even monthly. I was with him there on
one occasion, and am sure that, if he was permitted to hold
similar meetings, even once a month, much good would result,
not’only to these men. but their families ; and the public would
also be greatly benefited by the conversion of law-breakers, so
that, “ he who stole would steal no more,” but prove a blessing to
society instead of a curse; and the Government would thus be
saved much of the present large outlay in prosecuting and
punishing them.
I firmly believe the reasons advanced against the visits of
Major Barker, or any other judicious layman, are groundless
and mistaken, and gladly would accompany my friend and

brother in Christ in his compassionate, unselfish efforts to bring-
the glad tidings of salvation to these men.
We wish, dear brethren, that each of you, with us, may so-
spend our one short life—so usefully, and earnestly, and faith-
fully—that, when the Master calls us, we may hear Him say,
“ Well done 1 good and faithful servant; enter thou into the joy
of thy Lord 1”
I have seen many of you in the prisons who are now happy,
useful, Christian men, in various parts of Melbourne and
suburbs, and have been at some remarkable gatherings for
testimony in your barracks, where I have been warmly welcomed
by “ forty or more thieves,” redeemed by the precious blood of
Christ.
Let us pray for one another, bear with one another, and live in
love to all, and the God of peace shall be with us till we cross
the Jordan, enter the pearly gates, and “ see the King in His
beauty cast our crowns at His feet, and “ crown Him Lord of
all I” with millions of the redeemed, out of every nation, kindred,
and tongue.
Yoar friend and brother in Christ,
John Singleton.
Ormiston House, Grey-street, East Melbourne.
June, 1886.
ENCOURAGING TESTIMONY.
The Hon. James Balfour, M.L.C., writing to Major Barker on
the Prison-gate Brigade and Rescue Work, says : —“ I think the
work you are carrying on in these two departments is most
valuable and effective, looked at both from a charitable point of
view, and a statesman’s. I believe you have agents who get
access to the outcast and dangerous classes in a way no other
organisation does, and I consider your own methods, your own
active work most successful with them.”
Another well-known M.P., Wm. Shiels, Esq., writes Major
Barker, inter alia :—“ The work that your Prison-gate Brigade
does is a noble and successful one, and commands my heartiest
sympathy.”
Speaking at Ballarat a short time since. Commissioner Howard
stated that “ two years since there was not a Prison-gate Brigade
or a Rescued Sisters’ Home in the world, connected with the
Salvation Army, outside Victoria; but so pleased was the General
with the progress made in this colony, that he determined to
organise branches of this work in every country in which the
Salvation Army banner waves. Already New Zealand, New
South Wales, and South Australia have followed the example of
Victoria ; and in the mother country successful efforts have been
made to establish kindred institutions.”


OUR NIGHT BRIGADE.
Alone in a crowd! Such is often the bitter experience of
earth’s forlorn ones. But such will not be the position of any
among the countless multitude before the throne I We who
have been solitary on earth will find that God has set us in His
family, so He will give us our own place in the “ Family Home,”
and full share in the family affections. Thus, in our heavenly
home, perfect love will cast out all fear. There will be the
deepest reverence, but it will be conjoined with holy boldness
and prostrate adoration, yet accompanied by undoubted love and
profound humility, ever blended with a trust that knows not the
shadow of a doubt. Bless God for that I Hallelujah I In our
night work we meet with many such as these —heart-sick, weary,
and forlorn : those who would gladly put an end to their exist-
ence if it were not for the terrible hereafter. We are very thank-
ful that God Almighty has used us to do so much work, and has
made us the humble instruments of winning souls for Him ; but
Wb often Cby in Bitterness
for the iniquity and sin we see around us—men and women who
are selling their bodies and souls to the devil, for our hearts go
out as much to one as the other ; they are all somebody’s loved
•ones. We have lifted our Master up, these past three years, to
many a heavy-laden one; and, thank God I we have seen many a
wet eye—hearts broken and sad. Oh, mothers, we ask you to-
day, “ How are you bringing up your little ones ? Have you
brought them to Jesus 7 if not, what are you thinking of doing
with them 7” You may not be aware, but take care you are not
selling them, body and soul, to Satan. Bring them to Jesus now,
while they are in the flush of youth, and you will have your
reward in this world and in that which is to come. It is lament-
able to see the sin and misery there is in our
CHINESE CAMPS,
many of these places being crowded out with young girls of
tender age, who should be under a mother’s care, but who to-day
*re old in sin, revelling in recklessness and vice. God help those
parents I for they will each have to render an account to
Almighty God for these dear children He has given to them, and
we, who profess to be serving King Jesus, our Master, if we be
not up and doing.
“ Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have
mercy upon him, and to our God, for He will abundantly
pardon.” —lsaiah Iv. 7.


“THE ARGUS” ON THE RESCUED
SISTERS’ HOMES.
The Abgus of 6th February, 1885, gives a lengthy and very
excellent article relating to the above. We subjoin the following
extracts:—
“ The Salvation Army is to be highly commended for what it
has done with the means at its command. The great secret of
the success of the Salvation Army with outcast women is the
Genuine Sympathy
its officers show for them, and the ready companionship they
enable them to meet with. There is no dwelling in a serene
altitude of proper virtue. They always address their hearers ai
being of like passions with themselves. The leaders being gene-
rally men of tact and of some magnetic personality, they rapidly
gain a strong influence for good over theii protSgds.
“ Mrs. Major Barker and the wives of other officers of the
Salvation Army have endeavoured to deal with such cases by
taking the unfortunates into their own service, where they have
won them over by
Humane Treatment.
For the helpless, homeless creatures to be found in the dens of
Little Bourke-street and other quarters of the city, the Salvation
Army is stretching out a hand to save that which would other-
wise be lost. While the Army does efficiently this work of moral
scavenging, it is a matter of small moment whether their philan-
thropic aims are surrounded by an emotional form of religion or
not.”
VOWING AND PAYING.
A South Brighton friend writes :—“ Some time ago I was in
distress of mind on account of some business trouble, and I took
it to the Lord in prayer, promising that if He would help me out
of the difficulties I would give to Major Barker the sum of £5
towards the Salvation Army, to be spent in what part of the
work he thought most needful. The Lord did help me out of the
difficulties, and here is the £s.'’ Thanks.
LEFT-OFF CLOTHING.
In our meetings and at Headquarters we are continually having
men and women converted who are quite destitute and in want
of clothing, and we have had to buy clothing for them in several
instances ; and, as this puts us to considerable expense, we shall
be glad if any of the Lord’s servants, having spare clothing of
any kind, will forward parcels to Major Barker, Headquarters,
75 Exhibition-street, Melbourne.


SYDNEY RESCUED SISTERS’ HOME.
A PEW months ago a young woman who had been left to battle
with the world alone (her husband having forsaken her), placed
her two children in homes, and then found herself without a
shelter. Like many more, she tried to drown her sorrow in the
intoxicating cup, but was still wretched. Praise God 1 she
applied for admission, and was received into the Home, where
she soon
Found a Friend in Jesus,
who forgave her sins and bade her go in peace. While an inmate
here, we rejoiced to see the change in her, both bodily and spirit-
ually. Always ready and willing, whatever she did was done
with a single eye to God’s glory. Soon we were enabled to send
her forth, having found a home for her in a Christian family,
where she has been ever since, faithfully performing her duties,
and proving a good soldier in one of our corps. She has con-
tinually pleaded with God for her husband’s salvation; and,
Hallelujah I her faith has been honoured, for
He came to her Saviour,
and has found that there is no friend like Jesus ! Praise the
dear Lord ! they are re-united, bound together now by the cords
of God’s holy love ; and our earnest prayer is that they may he
enabled to live such pure lives that their children may be trained
as soldiers for our King I
INTELLIGENCE FROM LONDON.
Mrs. Bramwell Booth said, at an Auxiliary Meeting in London
the other day, that, “ since the time the Army commenced rescue
work there were at least 200 girls, of whom they could speak with
confidence, who had been rescued, and were leading virtuous
lives.”
There are now eighteen or nineteen men in the home of the
Prison-gate Brigade, London, and all saved, and working for
their living. Some of them never worked till they came to the
Salvation Army.
“ Seek ye the Lord while He may be found ! Call ye upon
Him while He is near 1”
“ I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish,
neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand.” —John x. 28.
“ Fear not, for I have redeemed thee ; I have called thee by
thy name—thou art mine.” —lsaiah xliii. 1.

OUR CLOSING APPEAL.
The readers of the foregoing pages will have seen
what is our object —our scope—our desire —and will
also have noted that the most careful and economical
supervision is exercised over the expenditure of all
our Homes.
Notwithstanding the most careful economy, however,
the drain on our resources has increased, and we are
forced to appeal still further to the sympathies of those
whom God has blessed.
Many of our poor sisters who are rescued from an
opium den or brothel are quite unfit for work for some
little time. Note, dear friend, the sum of 10s per
week —£2 per month—from your abundance would help
to keep one of these. The sum of £5O would keep two
for a whole year.
We must not forget, however, that we have special
attendance and medicine needed for our No. 8 Home,
in xchich our wants are, of course, proportionately
greater. Help, to restore body and soul, we therefore
ask.
Much need constantly arises in our Homes for a
supply of clean linen, and many ladies can well spare
some garments to clothe our destitute sisters. For help
of this kind too, we urgently appeal.
Our Prison-Gate Brigade is constantly receiving
men who. for ten, twenty, and even fifty years, have been
expiating their offences by imprisonment. They come


to us needing almost every article of clothing, and our
resources are sorely straitened to 'provide them with
covering.
In mahing this appeal, Ido so with a full sense oj
the responsibility I undertake —a full sense of the deep
gratitude which I already owe to the generous public.
Both Mrs. Barker and myself are unable to express our
grateful appreciation of the unlimited kindness with
which the people of this colony have responded to our
every appeal for aid; but we know that the spring of
human kindness is still flowing, and that we need only
set our wants before the people and they will besupplied.
We know that there have been failures in our efforts
—many of them, perhaps—but we know, too, that there
