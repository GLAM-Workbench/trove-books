THE LATEST NEWS!
Composed and set to Music by John Ploughman.
And dedicated to Joe BuaeiiSA.
Tbe latest news, the only news,
That floats upon the breeze just now,
Is what befel poor Isabel, ?
But how to tell I scarce know how.
A jovial spark, call'd Billy B 1,
This fragile fair one did espy ;
Of Beauty's power there is no doubt,
And Cupids magnet caught his eye.
Of children he has lots at home,
A wife ?as pure and kind as heaven, ?
It matter'd not, this man would roam
As though by famine he were driven.
At length a baby came to light,
And for its Father look?d around ;
Says F Ito G ?b?n, honor bright I
George C 's the man, I?ll bet a pouni
If no t ?let W h, with anxious care,
Make strict enquiry in the Town,
Some information from the Mayor
I fancy would be worth a crown.
'Tis said ?but p'rhaps the tale's not true,
H?b ?y and H?c ?t lent a hand ;
Some truths lie hid?but this I know,
(Men dearly love the contraband.)
Be as it may, an oath is sworn,
That William gave so rude a shock,
That every tendril, rent and torn,
Collaps'd just like a half tide rock.
To contradict this precious oath
Some well-known gents are summon'd to
Do that which most men would be loth, ?
(Declare her favors are not few.)
This I have heard ?but don't believe
Such men exist, let W?tc ?b search,?
Death to the wretch without reprieve,
Who'll kiss and tell, says Geordy B h.
But when Old Times ?and Woodcock 6
On Wednesday next decide the case,
Take my advice, be there to see
This Mars and Juno face to face !
Hobart Town ,
27 th November , 1870.
