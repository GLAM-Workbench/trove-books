THE TWINS
YOU must have heard of the famous two
(A boy and a girl the age of you]
Who thrilled with excitement down the spine
Whenever they saw a danger sign ;
Their parents went by the name of Minns,
But they were known as the Redhead Twins !


1^


rn¥
THE HOME
THEY lived in a house at Regent’s Park
(A fact in itself of no great remark)
With a shining knocker outside the door
And an aspidistra on every floor ;
It bottled them up like a pair of djinns-
They had to escape, those fiery Twins !

THE IDEA
ONE day they read of a handsome prize
For any pilot who flew the skies
And crossed the Tropic of Capricorn
(Provided that he was British born) ;
A chance for heroes and heroines
Which quite appealed to our daring Twins !




THE REGENT
FROM morning till night the tireless twain
Ransacked the Park for an aeroplane,
And then by magic their troubles cleared,
For who but the Regent himself appeared ;
(He dates back further than crinolines,
But he brought a ’plane for those lucky Twins!)




THE START
HE helped them in with a courtly bow
And said, ‘ You’d better be starting now
You’ve got a spanner, some nuts and bolts,
A battery charged with a thousand volts,
And plenty of gas in your petrol tins—
So now be off with you, Redhead Twins !




k
PARIS
ACROSS the Channel they looped the loop
. And came to France in a single swoop ;
Then swept through the arch of the Eiffel Tower
At nearly five hundred miles an hour ;
(If this is the way their trip begins,
What will they do next, these madcap Twins ?)




VESUVIUS
THEIR carburetter commenced to fuss
When they were over Ve-su-vi-us,
Which opened its mouth as they went by,
And spouted 6 The Last Days of Pom-pe-ii 5 ;
It nearly swallowed them for their sins,
Those petrol-soaked, inflammable Twins !




ATLAS MOUNTAINS
THEY found the way, with a few mishaps,
To the Atlas Mountains of charts and maps,
And saw the Giant who, under a curse,
Supports on his back the Universe ;
He taught them the compass’s outs-and-ins,
And re-directed the straying Twins !




>1^
GOLD COAST
THEY skirted the Gold and Ivory Coasts
Where the younger elephants bathe in hosts,
And frisky lion-cubs splash the seas,
And monkeys dive from the tallest trees ;
A good, long swim with their kiths and kins
Was what they needed, those dusty Twins !

-IM>
ORANGE RIVER
AND then they came, when the day was hot
l To the Orange River, a luscious spot
Quite undiscovered by ocean ships,
For it flows with oranges, rind and pips ;
They ate the river and left the skins —
A rare repast for the hungry Twins !




TABLE MOUNTAIN
ON Table Mountain they caused alarm
By floating into an ostrich farm ;
The ostriches scattered on every hand
And buried their faces in the sand,
And, while they were poised on trembling pins,
Their plumes were plucked by the ready Twins !




SOUTHERN CROSS
*
*
*
THEY were now in the Southern Hemisphere
That seems to be upside-down from here ;
Above was Cape Horn, where the wild waves toss,
Below in the sky was the Southern Cross ;
And the fish had wings and the birds had fins—
Which was quite a surprise for the startled Twins !

SOUTH POLE
AT last on the fields of ice they found
„ The tall South Pole, with a circle round ;
(It runs through the earth, to avoid the bend,
And comes out again at the Northern end ;)
There was nobody there but some stray
pen-gums,
Whose waistcoats greatly impressed the Twins !

NEW ZEALAND
THEN on to New Zealand’s sheep-covered
crests,
Where most of the lambs wear Wolsey vests ;
The flocks were lined up thousands deep,
But they picked out a gay little piebald sheep
From the blacks, the whites, the fats and the thins,
And it joined the crew of the friendly Twins !




AUSTRALIA
WITHOUT any warning they landed right
In the jaws of the Great Australian Bight ;
Around them a laughing jackass flew,
And the three ran a race with a kangaroo,
While a tribe of black-fellows with their c gins 5
Threw boomerangs to amuse the Twins !




BORNEO
THEY dared not linger in Borneo —
The Wild Man there was a bore, you know ;
He watched them coming, a toothsome sight
Which quickly whetted his appetite ;
So, heating a pot with hungry grins,
He lay in wait for the tasty Twins !


7 m


RISING SUN
THEY sped to the Land of the Rising Sun
Who rises later than any one ;
At first he bathes in the Eastern Sea,
Then spends an hour over morning tea
Like the best mikados and mandarins ;
He was much too slow for those hurried Twins

SANDWICH ISLANDS
ACROSS the Pacific they flew for miles,
L To have a snack at the Sandwich Isles,
That tropical spot where the native sups
On cocoanut milk in brown-shell cups
And buttered bread-fruit hot from the bins—
They left the Islands, quite well-fed Twins !




SALT LAKE CITY
THEN, feeling in need of a con-di-ment,
To Salt Lake City with speed they went
But crafty Mormons, their ends to gain,
Spread salt on the tail of the aeroplane,
Which twisted and turned with terrible spins
And nearly upset the airsick Twins !


I '


CANADA
AT Medicine Hat a sight they saw,
An Indian chief, complete with squaw ;
His hair was black, and his skin was red,
And feathers grew out of the back of his head
He was shod in a pair of moccasins—
And he tried to scalp those terrified Twins !

NEW YORK
THEY had a peep at the Wall Street types
Who foxtrot under the Stars and Stripes ;
The fierce American Bulls and Bears
Were chasing after the millionaires
In that hustling town where the best man wins,
But they took off their hats to the visiting Twins !

EMERALD ISLE
SO home, by way of the Emerald Isle,
Which winked at them with a roguish smile ;
The news of the distance they had flown
Was noised abroad by the Blarney Stone,
And all the O’s (whether Neils or Flynns)
Were dancing a jig to welcome the Twins !




SCOTLAND
THE Bluebells of Scotland sang their praise
As they hovered over the banks and braes ;
To catch a glimpse of them, Lowland Scots
Cheerfully tied their necks in knots,
And even Highlanders wrenched their chins
In looking up at the Heavenly Twins !




THE PRIZE
THE Regent met them in London Town,
Presented them each with half-a-crown,
And said they could keep the aeroplane,
In case they flew round the world again ;
So they brought renown to the name of Minns,
That pair of aces, the Redhead Twins !
