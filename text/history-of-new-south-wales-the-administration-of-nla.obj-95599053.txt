HISTORY OF NEW SOUTH WALES.
The Administration of Brisbane and Darling.
Sir Thomas Brisbane’s administration lasted from ist December, 1821, to
Ist of December, 1825, during which period the immigration of free settlers
was encouraged, costly Government farms were broken up, and unremunera-
tive public works were abandoned. Despite the excellence of his character,
his administration, towards the close of his career, became unpopular from a
variety of causes which eventually led to his recall. Although there was no
reason to question his motives, his financial measures were unfortunate.
Under previous Governors surplus grain was purchased from the farms at the
current price of the day. but Brisbane adopted the ordinary contract system,
and invited tenders for the quantity required by the Government at the lowest
price. Unskilled in the advantages of open competition, the farmers glutted
the market, and wheat fell from 10s. to 3s. qd., a price out of pro-
portion to its cost of production and the expense of carriage to market.
Formerly the Government bought all the farmers produce, and as there was
no export trade or outlet for surplus breadstuffs, great quantities were thrown
to the pigs, and recklessly wasted. The idea that there was a superabundance
of grain in the market by the temporary glut was soon dissipated, for, as the
next season advanced, there was a scarcity, arising out of the reckless waste,
and the prices rose from 3s. qd. to 4s. id. a bushel. The suffering to the
public by the high price of bread was laid to Brisbane’s account, and it was
said so serious a change in the old custom of trade required care and time.
Abstractedly Brisbane was right, but practically he was wrong, for such reforms
require slow growth. He was the first to officially countenance the “ Holey
Dollar” system, and subsequently to establish a colonial currency, which
raised the pound sterling fully 25 per cent, under which system he paid debts
contracted in sterling currency with colonial money, a revival of the system
which depreciated the circulating medium then obsolete in the United
Kingdom. The financial embarrassment which followed this act combined
with an offensive reply to some Presbyterians who had applied for assistance
to build a Presbyterian church, and Brisbane’s constant attention to philo-
sophical pursuits instead of the affairs of State, led to his recall. It is a
singular fact that on the eve of his departure he raised himself in the
estimation of those who had advocated his recall by attending a farewell


banquet at Parramatta. It appears that a select number of persons known by
the name of “Aristocrats,” “ Exclusionists,” and “Pure Merinos,” invited
him to a public dinner to his honor. The class known as “Emancipists,”
also invited him to a banquet, and unwilling to attend both demonstrations he
endeavoured to conciliate the conflicting parties by suggesting that six of the
leading Emancipists should be invited to the public dinner of the first-named
class. The committee of the Exclusionists announced “ the painful necessity
of declining any further preparation for the honor of His Excellency’s
company,” and the other party not only banqueted the Governor, but
presented him with adulatory addresses. He returned to Scotland and
fitted up astronomical and magnetical observatories theie. He succeeded
Sir Walter Scott as President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and founded
two gold medals for scientific merit, one in the award of the Royal Society and
the other in that of the Society of Arts. He was the intimate friend of
Sir Ralph Abercromby, under whom he fought as a colonel in the West Indies,
in 1796, and of the Duke of Wellington, to whom he owed his appointment
as Governor of the colony, and under whom, as a Brigadier-General, he
distinguished himself in Spain, in 1812. He died in the year iB6O, a
distinguished scientist and soldier.
The seventh Governor of this colony in succession to General Brisbane
was Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Darling. He arrived in Sydney, with his wife
and family, in the Castle Forbes , on December 18, 1825, and relieved Colonel
(afterwards General) Stewart, of Bathurst, from his position as Acting-Governor
during an interregnum of eighteen days, an honor which formed one of the
boasts of that old soldier, and a standing joke of the Western district for the
rest of his life. Darling had been an old military officer employed by the
Horse Guards, and obtained his appointment from his skill in military matters.
His character as a strict and severe disciplinarian, a man of forms and
precedents, a red-tape formalist and a man of system and routine had preceded
him, hence the populace on his landing, contrary to the practice customary on
such auspicious occasions, refrained from cheering. The worst fears of the
colonists were soon confirmed by his somewhat strange and eventful actions.
Indeed, after the first few months of his advent, his administration was a
perfect storm. Owing to Brisbane’s want of business habits the various
departments were in a state of the utmost confusion. His first act was to
reorganise the Civil Service, which at once precipitated him into conflict with
many of his officials. Nothing daunted, he laboured hard to secure order and
regularity. He substituted a system of checks and counter checks, and used
such a multiplication of requisitions and forms, that the remedy was as bad as
the disease, if not more corrupt and dilatory. His habits were painfully exact.


methodical and arbitrary; yet so industrious that he took infinite trouble over
minor details to the neglect of larger and more important affairs. He
obstinately evaded the control of the official and Nominee Council, and his
efforts to purge the service of the Emancipist element, introduced by
Macquarie and continued by Brisbane, raised around him a host of enemies.
In his efforts to cleanse the Augean stable, he was ably supported by the then
newly appointed Colonial Secretary (the late Hon. Alexander Macleay), who
had formerly been Secretary to the Transport Board, during the war with France,
and was one of the founders of the Linnean Society. But their antagonistic
position to a large class of the community and their peculiar favor for the
Exclusives, led to a social war more bitter than any ferment that had pre-
viously prevailed.
Darling had not long been in office when he came into violent antagonism
with the press, and he ultimately put upon it a censorship which savoured of
tyranny. It appears that the small Executive Council formed in 1824 to consult
with Brisbane on colonial matters was in 1829 enlarged to fifteen members
with powers to make laws for the colony. It was certainly a step in advance
•of the old Executive Council, forming as it did a check upon the Governor,
who had been an absolute despot. As its proceedings were strictly secret (the
members being sworn to divulge nothing) and they could be completely
nullified by the Governor, who had an absolute veto, it was, to say the least,
but a very unsatisfactory form of legislature. Yet it was of some service to the
•colony, for it prevented Darling from strangling “ the liberty of the press”
granted by his predecessor, who did not believe in an Algerine system of
government. Darling, it would seem, was exceedingly wrath at the manner
his policy of military discipline was assailed in the columns of the “ Monitor
and “ Australian” newspapers, and in order to curb “ the licentiousness of the
press,” he laid before the Council on 26th April, 1827, two acts, one to regulate
the publication of newspapers, and the other to impose a duty of fourpence on
each paper published. The Council passed both statutes, but Chief Justice
Forbes foiled Darling's attempt to “ gag the press” by refusing to certify under
the Constitution Act that the stamp duty on newspapers was not repugnant to
the laws of England, hence the publication of the second act was declared
premature, and its operations suspended. As the newspapers continued
without mercy to attack the Governor and his advisers, the new libel law was
put in force with great rigour, and Dr. Warded and Mr. Hayes (editors of the
Australian), and Mr. E. S. Hall (editor of the Monitor ), for bringing the
King’s representivive into hatred and contempt, were prosecuted civilly and
-criminally, each of them being heavily fined and imprisoned. The newspaper
war lasted four years, and while the papers named severely criticised the acts


of Darling, the official organ, The Sydney Gazette, with intemperate zeat
praised the Governor in a fulsome and extravagant manner. Throughout this-
newspaper crusade Darling’s chief adviser was Archdeacon Scott (who had
been a wine merchant and secretary to Commissioner Bigge), and so great
was his zeal in the Governor’s cause that he caused Mr. Hall’s pew in
St. James’ Church to be “decked over” in consequence of the
Monitor characterising him as “ not a man of peace.
When (Darling assumed the government of the colony he found the
colonists had been infected with the mania for joint stock companies that
pervaded England. The extraordinary success that had attended the pastoral
pursuits of McArthur and a few others brought an influx of men of capital
into the colony to embark in grazing. The colony was described, in glowing
terms, as “ well calculated for the growth of timber, wheat, tobacco, hemp,, flax,
and fruits, amongst which are the olive, grape, fig, mulberry, guava, almond,,
peach, citron, and orange.” Under Darling the agents of the Australiaa
Agricultural Company commenced operations on such a colossal scale, and
with such brilliant expectations, that everyone seemed eager to enter into
speculations in stock. The rise in the price of stock made many old settlers
wealthy, while the value of labour rose in a corresponding degree. Such was
the extragavant speculation in sheep and cattle that we are told “ the soldier
unbuckled his belt to become a keeper of sheep, and the priest forsook his-
altar to become a herdsman of cattle.” Dr. Lang, as an eye witness, says
“ This mania evinced itself in impelling whomsoever it seized to the cattle
market; and as my own residence in Sydney at that period was in the:
immediate vicinity of that busy scene, I had frequent oppoilunities of
observing the congregated patients, and abundant reason to wonder how the
matter would end—for barristers and attorneys, military officers of every rank,
and civilians of every department, clergymen and medical men, merchants,,
settlers, and dealers in general, were there seen promiscuously mingled
together, outbidding each other in the most determined manner, either in their
own person or by proxy, for the purchase of every wretched sheep, scarecrow
horse, or buffalo cow that was offered for sale.” The price of live stock rose
two hundred per cent., and “ The company with the long pocket” was the
toast of the day. This bucolic spirit was followed by extravagance in houses,,
furniture, equipages, and dress. A drought of three years ensued, and a most
disastrous financial crash followed. The reaction was so sudden that the
value of cattle fell from pounds to shillings. Unfortunately, the exciting rush
for pastoral riches had retarded agriculture, consequently the financial
difficulty was aggravated by large sums of money being sent out of the colony
to procure breadstuffs.


The widespread distress consequent on the great speculative excitement
and the severe drought compelled the graziers to search for better watered
country towards the interior, which Oxley had represented as interminable
swamps, or an inland sea. Darling, to elucidate the geographical problem of
“an inland sea” as well as open up new country, organised an exploring
expedition under the command of Captain Charles Sturt, an officer of the 39th
Regiment, an enthusiast in the cause of Australian discovery. Sturt,
accompanied by Hamilton Hume, Staff-Surgeon M‘Leod, two soldiers, and
eight others, left Sydney on November 10th, 1828, and on February 4th, 1829,
discovered a salt-water river, which Sturt named the Darling. This discovery
set aside the opinions of Oxley that the Castlereagh and Macquarie were
tributaries of the Brisbane River that flowed into Moreton Bay, but it did not
solve the problem of an inland sea. Pleased with Sturt’s good fortune in the
way of exploration. Darling sent him on a second expedition to penetrate the
south-west interior by means of the Murrumbidgee. In this expedition he
was accompanied by Mr. (afterwards Sir) George M‘Leay, son of the Colonial
Secretary, Mr. Fraser, colonial botanist, and Messrs. Harris, Hopkinson,
Clayton, Mulholland, and Macnamara. In January, 1830, they embarked in a
boat on the Murrumbidgee (which receives the waters of the Macquarie and
the Darling), and followed it down to its junction with the Murray. In spite
of hardships and dangers from snags, sandbanks, and hostile savages, they
entered Lake Alexandrina, in South Australia. On February 23rd the seacoast
was reached at Encounter Bay.
After a month of incredible toil they re-entered the Darling and succeeded
in reaching the Murrumbidgee, travelling up stream.
When the party reached Sydney on the 2 sthMay, their pull in a boat of 2000
miles was deserved characterisedly as one of the most remarkable feats ever
recorded. In consideration of these services the Parliament of South Australia
voted Captain Sturt, who had become blind, a pension of an act of
liberality without precedent in this or the colony of Victoria. In June, 1869,
Sturt died at Cheltenham, England, and it was well said of him : “ He never
strove for what the vulgarly-ambitious call fame ; he was a most modest,
simple-minded, and retiring gentleman, and the world passed him by shouting
out praises to more boisterous heroes and worthies of a rougher cast. Brave
as a paladin, gentle as a girl, this man went into the wilderness, and by his
genius and valour laid the foundation of a new Flnglish state which is rapidly
growing into greatness. Had he won an Indian battle —no matter by his own
strategy or by the sheer dogged courage of his troops —he would have received
a peerage. He discovered the River Murray—the Australian ‘ Nile’ —he
opened up the whole interior of Australia to English settlement and enterprise.


and he dies untitled, undecorated, unrewarded, a simple gentleman retired
from the army, like a hundred'others who doze away the quiet evening of their
lives at a provincial watering place.” He dispelled the theory previously held
of the existence of an inland sea, and discovered the iviississipi of Australia,
which he named after Sir George Murray, then Secretary of State for the
■Colonies. It is a singular coincidence that it was subsequently ascertained
that the natives called that noble stream Murrewa, a name resembling much
the one given to it by Sturt.
The published account of Sturt's travels, beautifully illustrated, are
•commended to all readers. They may be seen at the Sydney Mechanics’
School of Arts.
While the financial crisis was imminent and the political and social
contests between Darling and the colonists about restricting the liberty of the
Press was on foot, an act of personal despotism by Darling raised a perfect
ferment, not only in the colony, but in England. It stands out as the land-
mark in the history of Australia, indicating the termination of a Governor's
power to outrage justice and constitutional rights. According to the official
papers the facts of the case may be thus summarised.
In the second year of Darling’s rule two soldiers of the 57th Regiment,
named respectively Sudds and Patrick Thompson, thinking the lot of prisoners
preferable to their own, determined to quit the regiment. Thompson was a well
conducted man with a small bank-account, but Sudds was wild and reckless.
Noticing that many of the convicts were settled on snug farms, established in
good businesses, and that many had become wealthy merchants and station-
holders, Sudds suggested to Thompson that they could easily procure their
discharge from the regiment by becoming petty larcenists. Other means of
procuring their discharge being out of the question, this method now seemed
the only feasible one to open the way to the desired object.
Accordingly they deliberately went to a clothier’s shop in George-street,
Sydney, and openly stole a piece of cloth. As was expected they were caught,
convicted, and sentenced to seven years' transportation to one of the northern
settlements. During the trial the motive appeared which led to the commission
of the offence. In extenuation of the offence it w r as asserted that the liberty and
comfort of the military were much inferior to the ticket-of-leave men and
•emancipists, and several other soldiers had committed similar offences to escape
the irksome military service. When this was reported to Darling he determined
to quell with an iron hand the wide-spread discontent among the military. He
feared the consequences of the bad example set by the offenders, which
endangered the discipline of the troops. He determined to deter others from
similar deeds and convince the military that the commission of an offence to


become felons would not enable them to obtain superior food, comforts, and
the prospects of a criminal. Accordingly he took Sudds and Thompson out of
the civil power, and issued a general order to the effect that they were to work in
chains on the roads for the full term of their sentence, after which they were to
return to their service in the regiment. In order to make his mandate more im-
pressive, he had the men taken from the gaol to the Barrack Square, and in the
presence of the garrison formed a hollow square, and had their altered sentence
read aloud. The culprits were then stripped of their clothing, iron collars with
long projecting spikes were rivetted round their necks and fetters and chains put
upon their legs. They were then marched back to gaol, the military band
.en route playing “ The Rogue’s March.” The manacles were made to the
express order of Darling, and proved veritable instruments of torture. “ The
projecting irons,” says Thompson, “ would not allow me to stretch at full
length on my back —I could only sleep on my sides, by contracting my legs.
I could not stand upright with my irons on —the chains were too short. Sudd’s
•collar was too small for his neck.” The tragical results of the treat-
ment ended in the death of Sudds in a few days after the drumming
out, and in' Thompson becoming a confirmed lunatic. All the time
of the sentence Sudds was suffering from an affection of the liver
and his death was hastened by his being overcome with shame, grief,
.and disappointment as well as the oppression of his chains. A great outcry
was raised in the colony to the consternation of all concerned, and when an
•enquiry was held the irons could not be found. The enemies of Darling
found in the case “ the inestimable benefit of a grievance, and Mr. W. C.
Wentworth, “ the chief leader of the colonial liberals,” drew up a foimal
impeachment of Darling which was delivered to the Governor at Government
House by an attorney. As Darling treated the impeachment with contempt,
Wentworth vowed he “ would never lose sight of so great a criminal until he
had brought him to justice .” The Sydney Gazette defended Darling’s act,
while the two independent journals, the Monitor and Australian castigated
the Governor and his friends with great violence. In truth the colony
afterwards became divided into two parties, and until the close of Darling’s
administration a system of bureaucracy and military despotism existed.
Although Wentworth did not carry out his threat “ to follow Governor Darling
to the gallows,” he exerted his utmost to have the proceedings brought before
the House of Commons.
Darling was recalled to England in 1831, and in 1832 Sir Maurice O'Connell
made efforts to procure the appointment of a Parliamentary Committee to
•enquire into his conduct, but without success, and it was not until 1835 that an
investigation took place, when Darling was “ honorably acquitted” in the


absence of evidence to substantiate the impeachment. He left the shores of
the colony in October, 1831. No demonstration of respect was shown by the
populace at his leaving, except that a number of officials attended at Government
House and escorted him to the wharf.
THE STUDY OF ENGLISH.
The study of English is analogous to a voyage of exploration through a country
where there is much to fascinate and charm, and moie to instruct. Let us
trace the analogy. First, there is the necessity of reaching the shore of this
land through which the journey is to be made. To what in the study of
English does this phase of travel correspond ? Clearly to the drudgery
experienced by the child at school in the rudimentary stage of learning, when
no interest has yet been awakened in the mind that has to be forced at first
along the track over which it afterwards runs so easily. The vis inertiae of
the mind has to be overcome just as much as that of concrete matter; and
when overcome is not exposed to half as many extraneous forces as those
which combine their influence to arrest the motion of a physical body. The
mind will not stop when once fairly started on its journey until breath leaves
the body. This is the first stage on the way and it must be traversed despite
the tedium and dulness it entails. What is the second stage in this journey ?
We are past the preliminary portion ; we have made a fair start and are now
in full possession of the opportunities to which our progress has led us. On
each side are scenes in which we may take the keenest delight if we will but
observe them. Landscapes of surpassing grandeur stretch away before us as-
we gaze. Rivers rich with historic memories wind through the fair land before
us, and their banks are crowned with ruined castles and flourishing towns. In
some places time has not exacted its accustomed tribute, and a tower remains
as a monument of the achievements of which human power is capable.
Mountains, delightful valleys, leafy woods, and grassy plains, trees, flowers, and
animals in endless variety, are open to our view if we will but see them. It is
for this we have travelled and subjected ourselves to inconvenience and
discomfort. We can now enjoy the fruit of our labour.
One traveller will, on his journey, be always in a hurry, ever eager to
push on his way with despatch lest anything should escape his notice, never
content to rest in one place for any time, but always thinking there must be
something beyond which it is his duty to see, in reality missing nearly every
beauty from solicitude not to lose sight of any ; thinking more of his object
than its attainment. He is like the Chinese Emperor that was taken to hear
