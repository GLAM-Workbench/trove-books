CASE-HARDENED
DIES.
GUIDES.
These Tools have a world-wide reputation, and have proved in thousands of hands all that is claimed for them.
They finish the work at one cut, making a screw equal to the best lathe work, no burr being raised above the true size.
The dies (having all the strength and reliability of solid dies), are not solid, but are adjustable for wear, so as to keep the exact
size of the taps, notwithstanding long use, and to allow nuts and bolts for different purposes to be made to fit together tightly or
loosely, as may be desired. When used up they can be replaced, the stock, collets, etc., remaining good.
The collets holding the dies have guides for starting bolts true, but when desirable to cut close under the heads of bolts
the face side of the die is used.

JjWAHIS is a strictly high-grade tool for work within range of
its capacity—strong, stiff, and well built. The dies are
adjustable, and can be opened and the tube or bolt withdrawn
without the tedious operation of turning backwards, thus effecting
a great saving in time. The dies are in the best cutting position
with the least possible friction on the back, ensuring clean cut
thread, and when screwing tubes, with less risk of splitting the
tube. The vice travels by rack and pinion close up to the screwing
head, thus allowing very short pieces to be screwed ; the sliding
jaws are worked by right and left hand steel screw. There are two
speeds, obtained simply by changing the handle from one shaft to
the other.
We supply the above machine for screwing pipes and bolts.

TyJjY far the easiest working machine we know. A boy can easily screw 3in.
and 4in, pipe by hand. Has sliding die-head, with adjustable releasing
dies and powerful cut gearing. Users of this tool are perfectly astonished, and
delighted as well, at the excellent service it gives them.
With ample strength they combine lightness, and are perfectly portable, so
that even the larger machine can be carried out on outside work like any other
tool, and all delay and expense arising from carting the pipe backward and
forward from the shop is avoided.

HIGHLY IMPROVED POWERFUL BOLT-SCREWING
MACHINE.
With Releasing Motion for instantly opening the Dies without

y|ijr«HlS is a very fine tool for screwing bolts, Whitworth thread, up to 2in.
U diameter (screws tubes also up to 2in.). The die head is arranged
similar to Brown's Patent, with releasing Motion for instantly opening and
withdrawing the dies whilst the machine is running, by which the time taken
in stopping and reversing the machine, and running the dies back, is saved.
The dies are adjustable, to compensate for wear. The bolt is screwed at once
over, and they open while they are revolving, and therefore leave no mark on
the thread. When dull, the dies can be sharpened on an ordinary grindstone,
like a chasing tool. The machine has large 3 speed pulley, each cone Sin. wide,
and heavy countershaft, and complete with screw keys, one set dies for each
size, etc. Machine taps for tapping nuts, with tap holders, etc., can be supplied
at extra price Also Master taps with rimers, etc., tor re-cutting the dies.

THE FOOTPRINT PATENT ADJUSTABLE STEEL PIPE TONGS OR WRENCHES,
Will fit Nuts, Studs, or Unions of any Section.
HEY can be used with one hand. When once tills wrench has taken
* hold it grips automatically. These tools consist of a forged steel hook
or centre-piece, and a lower jaw or frame made of steel, folded over and
properly secured by rivets, forming a box on which the hook is free to oscillate
about the joint pin. It has teeth in both j a ws, consequently it does not slip
half way round the pipe before it bites, but takes an instantaneous griji.
13 S made entirely of bar steel. The reversible Jaws are drop forged, and hardened to a saw temper. When teeth become
| dull the jaws can be reversed, thus making it practically a new tool.
tjA The pressure of the teeth is in a lino tangent to the circumference of the pipe, which, combined with the encircling grip
of the chain, absolutely prevents crushing. It has a quick grip and never slips. The chain is easily and quickly adapted
to the work, and while it will not drop out or unhitch while in use, it can be instantly released.
It is specially adapted for use in limited spaces, as in corners, against the wall, between floors, or in trenches. Each
number will fit a range of sizes equal to six pairs of ordinary tongs.

CHAMPION TOOL HOLDERS.
JRU FEW of the distinct advantages claimed are: It has a good support under the cutting edge of the tool, which makes the tool
last twice as long as any other make, by the material not mashing dorm so quickly under the continual strain of the cut. It
makes a much heavier cut, allows using the ends of tire cutters closelj’, and prevents the cutter from chattering.

WELL’S INCANDESCENT
OIL LAMP.
1,500 C.P.
The Simplest and
WELLS’ UNBREAKABLE
OIL GAS LAMPS.
PtRODUCE a light equal to many gas jets,
from -kerosene, without smoke or
smell. They are invaluable for out-
door work, as they form a cheap portable
light. Use good oil—kerosene, petroleum, or
parrafin will do —not naphtha, as the burner is
too powerful for the latter, and causes it to
jump. Keep the burner clean, also remove
the screws every few weeks, and clean out any
deposit in the passages, and take out the
gauze at the end of the large tube, unroll it
any that may have accumulated in the tube.
A jumping light is caused either by a dirty
burner or by the gauze in end of tube being
too loose—this latter must be quite tight.

WELLS’ INCANDESCENT
OIL LAMP.
GIVES A LIGHT OF 1,500 C.P.
IKriO skilled labour required, simply follow iustruc-
sions given with outfit. The light given by
the Wells’ Incandescent Oil Lamp is very
brilliant, and does not flicker or throw a hard black
shadow. The system provides a portable substitute
for electric light or gas giving a better light at a far
smaller original cost, and at a less heavy upkeep.
Petroleum oil is forced under pressure from the
tank to the burner, where it is converted into oil
gas ; after having passed through a mixing chamber,
the gas is burnt in two large incandescent mantles.
The oil is carried in very small diameter tubes, and
as the gas is only generated before it is burnt,
there is no risk of explosion. A working charge of 4
gallons oil gives 1000 (Vl\ for 42 hours.

from the container on top into the vaporizer, being soaked up by the oil purifiers,
where it is reduced to gas. The lamp gives a most intense light, which burns very
steadily—2so eandle power on a consumption of about 2/sth pint oil per hour.

THE “DREADNOUGHT” PATENT MILLING FILE.
British Manufacture.
The Greatest Labour-saving Tool ever Invented.
The Simplest and Most Radical Improvement in Files ever Conceived.
i||| r £ HE “ DREADNOUGHT ” Patent Milling File lias semi-circular teeth, cut specially deep, and it is claimed that the formation
of the tooth is scientifically correct, not only in theory, but also in practice; this is manifest by comparing the filings,
which with the “ DREADNOUGHT ” Patent Milling File are of the nature and shape of turnings or shavings produced by a
modern lathe or milling machine.
The invention is so revolutionary that no real comparison can be made between the “ DREADNOUGHT ” Milling File and
that of the ordinary pattern, as the former, although a hand tool, does practically machine work. In fact, we claim that the
“ DREADNOUGHT” would be more accurately described as a HAND MILLING TOOL rather than a file.
The “ DREADNOUGHT ” Patent Milling File culs equally -Hell soft and tool steel, cast and wrought iron, hronze, and all
other hard metals, and is the only file that will cut copper, brass, lead, aluminium, Babbitt and other soft metals without
clogging. It is also invaluable as a Wood and Farriers’ Rasp. Owing to the shape of the teeth, it is self-cleaning, an immense
advantage, especially on soft metals, no wire or scratch brush being required.
The “ DREADNOUGHT ” Milling File cuts from 200 to 500 per cent. /aster than an ordinary file of best quality, in addition
to which the cutting edge is maintained equal to that of from four to ten of the ordinary pattern, according to the material it is
Section of 14-inch

teeth.
used upon. It also possesess the peculiar property of leaving the surface SMOOTH, and having all the
advantages of a Bastard File, it nevertheless does the work as neatly as if finished with a smooth file,
thereby lessening the time to finish the work in hand. Owing to its semi-circular teeth, it cannot possibly
slip or chase, and works equally well on a greased surface.
While at first cost the “ DREADNOUGHT ” Milling File may appear expensive, the enormous
amount of work it will do, its extremely long life, makes it infinitely the cheapest file on the market. It
is manufactured from the highest quality Sheffield Tool Steel obtainable, and is hardened by a special
process, which assists its enormous
cutting capacity to be utilized to the fullest extent,
using less pressure than with an ordinary file.
In OPERATION file slowly,
The “ DREADNOUGHT ’
” Milling File is made both in regular and fine cuts. Regular cut, 9
teeth to inch ; fine cut, 12 teeth to inch.

To Lift.— Screw up the stop valve and work the lever until the weight is raised to the height required.
To Lower.— Unscrew the stop valve when the water (or other fluid) will return from the top of the ram to
the cistern.
When the Jack is in use slacken the small screw in head one turn to admit air, and screw it up after using to
prevent loss of water. When the water comes out at the small hole behind the claw, the Jack is at the
full height of lift.
Keep the ram cleaned and well oiled.

WESTON’S DIFFERENTIAL PULLEY BLOCKS.
TSJULLEY Blocks have now become a necessity in all Machine and Boilermakers’ Shops, Ship Yards, Factories,
~ &o. We wish particularly to draw attention to the fact that all our Chain Pulley Blocks are thoroughly
tested by raising and lowering dead weights (just as in actual use) to full load test.
These Blocks are self-sustaining with the load suspended.
Guides are fitted to prevent the twisting of the chains.
Tire underside of the crosshead is so formed as to act as a chain guard, which saves several inches in head room.
Blocks are arranged for 10 feet lift, but can be fitted with chain to lift any height at extra cost for additional
chain used.
In sizes beyond 40 cwt. lift we advise the use, for general pu r po3es, of the Geared Blocks, in preference
to the Weston.

Tj.\ the IMPROVED SCREW Pulley Block the worm is of very coarse pitch, cut by special machinery to fit
exactly the radius of the wheel, causing the load to rise with great speed.
One man can lift any weight with far greater ease, and very much quicker than with the ordinary Pulley
Blocks.
The Block is self-sustaining, there is no back slip, but self-acting dead stop ; there are no jerks, and the
load can be adjusted to a mathematical nicety, better than with any other Pulley Block.
It will wear longer than any other block, for an experience of many years has shown the makers where
and how to put the wearing parts in.
Each block is tested to 50 per cent, above the nominal power it is sold for, which means, that an
IMPROVED SCREW Pulley Block which has stood 3 tons test, is sold as a 2-T on Block, and not as 3 tons,
which is the common practice.

THE “MORK PATENT” WORM GEARED PULLEY
BLOCK WITH QUICK RETURN.
THE MOST IMPROVED OF ALL WORM GEARED BLOCKS, UNSURPASSED FOR
SIMPLICITY OF CONSTRUCTION, QUALITY OF WORKMANSHIP,
AND MATERIAL AND EFFICIENCY.
TjJ»VERY user of Pulley Blocks is familiar with the advantages of the Worm Geared Block over the differ-
~r4\ ential Blocks, etc., but all systems of Worm Geared Blocks which have hitherto been on the market
have the same drawback, viz.:—That after the load has been raised or lowered the empty hook has
always to be brought back again by the same slow process of pulling the hand chain.

ADVANTAGES OF
The Block has all the advantages of an
any position.
up-to-date Worm Geared Block. The load may be sustained in
By pulling the lever, the worm is thrown out of gear and the empty hook descends by its own weight.
When loads are being lowered instead of raised the empty hook may bo raised again quickly to fhe required
height by simply pulling the loose end of the load chain.
The time saved amounts to practically 50 per cent., not to mention saving of material.
There is no danger whatever in using these blocks, as the load chain is fixed to the frame, and the lever
cannot act when the block is loaded. As the load chain is suspended from the frame and on the opposite side
of the lever, even a small load prevents the frame from being raised by any pull likely to be put on the rope.
When the empty hook is to be lowered or raised, always pull the rope with the left hand, and hold the loose
end of the load chain firmly by the right,

PATENT DOUBLE LIFT SAFETY HOIST,
SELF-SUSTAINING
SACK HOIST.
WITH FRICTION CONUS.
HE chief feature of this
Hoist is that it is self-
sustaining,and requires no brake.
It is very quick in action. There
is a hook at each end of the
chain. Each hoist and chain is
tested by the makers, before
leaving the works, to full test
/?S?>NE man, with ordinary exertion, can lift the weight, and
by hooking up the end of the chain and using a single
sheave block in the loop thus formed, double the weight may be
lifted. The chief advantage of this Hoist is that it is self-sus-
taining. If the hand rope be let go the load will not run down.
Lad by raising and lowering ; but remain suspended. The lowering is effected by pulling the
j rope on the other side of the wheel. The chain has two hooks,
dead weights. the one descending wliile the other ascends, so that when one
hook has arrived at the top of the Lift, the other will be at the
bottom ready for a fresh load ; thus no time is lost in running
up and down the empty hook. We stock these in the following

They arc very durable and simple in construction, and can be hung to a little pulley running

PARKINSON’S PATENT PERFECT VICE
combiae all the advantages ot the Continuous-Screw Vice,
cl with the quickness and economy of the Sudden-Grip Vice, giving at
the same time increased gripping power.
As a Sudden-Grip Vice, the travelling jaw can he moved or lid with
one hand any required distance, so as to be instantly brought into contact
with the work to be held, and the jaw further closed upon it to any extent
by the Screw as in the ordinary Vice.
Tho Screw travels with the Front Jaw, the Nut D has its upper portion
cut away, and is made of sufficient length to give ample strength and dura-
bility. Both Nut and Screw are formed with “Buttress Thread ”in such
a manner that when gripping they interlock each other, giving great power
and security to the grip, with little friction, and consequent ease to the
workman.

THE UNIVERSAL WOOD-WORKERS’ VICE.
UNIVERSAL pattern makers’ or wood workers’ Vices mark the line of a
cl new achievement in mechanical appliances. They have placed the standard of
excellence and versatile adaptation so high that they are almost worthy the dignity
of classification into a new species of tool. A peculiar
characteristic of these Vices is their celerity in'jumping about
into a great variety of incongruous positions, presenting the
work always in an attitude to the workman that ho can
operate with comfort.
The pattern makers’ vice has six pairs of jaws, so that
it is adapted to grasp any kind of work without regard to
irregularity of form. The workman who has the use of one
of those vices is as thoroughly equipped as though he had
access to a dozen different vices in as many different positions,
without being obstructed and encumbered with the presence
of a lot of useless tools.

The gears are cut and finished on special machinery, and are of the spur and helical variety.
Spiral Gears which transmit motion by sliding contact, with consequent friction and
wear, are not used in this blower. The undue wear of such gears is bound to require
early replacement.
As cut shows, gears are held in a rigid cast iron box frame, and cannot possibly get out of
alignment. The bearings are extra long, and are bored and reamed to gauge in the solid stock.
No brass boxes to wear, throwing gears out of line or requiring adjustment. Gears run in oil in a
dust-proof case, which can bo removed without disturbing the mechanism. Gears are broad and
strong, with large properly formed teeth. Blower is adjustable for height, and fan casing will
deliver blast in any direction.
When once oiled, blower remains in perfect running condition for months.

draft is the principle.
On turning the crank of the powerful No. 200 Blower attached to those
forges, all smoke and gases from the fire arc drawn into the cast iron exhaust
hood by means of the draft produced by a connection to fan case. The larger
portion of the gases escape up the stack by reason of the natural and induced
draft, while a part is returned'to tuyero'th rough fan. A separate connection
direct from blast pipe into stack strengthens the natural draft, and is used when
the fire is being started.

destructive friction occurs.
BALL BEARING DRILLS.
STYLE No. 91, Tor hand and power.
No. 91 is same as No. 90, but fitted with fast and loose pulleys for power.
Section of Spindle Head shows the perfect Ball Bearing arrangement for disconnecting the
Automatic Self Feed from the Lever Feed.
The point of greatest friction in a drill is in the Spindle Head, between the rapidly revolving
drill spindle with its upward thrust, and the slowly turning feed screw with its equal pressure
downward. Hero we place a set of ball bearings and not behind the feed screw as in ordinary
drills. In the No. 90 Drill a second set is placed under the Fly Wheel.
The Buffalo No. 90 Ball Bearing Drill also has machine cut gears which insure perfect
running with no friction loss. Is provided with back gears to give speed changes and is fitted
with Automatic Self Feed and Lever Feed with quick return which is self locking. The bearings
are bored and reamed in the solid metal and are of unusually large diameter and length.

PUNCHING AND SHEARING MACHINES FOR STOVE AND OVEN
MAKERS AND SHEET IRON WORKERS, BLACKSMITHS, Etc.
a RON of a thickness greater than stated herein should not be punched, even when the stroke of the punch admits it, or when
. it is intended to make holes of a smaller diameter, for the increasing strength of the material exceeds the demand of the
punch in a much higher degree than it is diminished by punching smaller diameters, without considering that the durability of
the die with which iron is to be punched of greater thickness than its diameter, is, as a matter of course, very limited.
The work is easier, and the moveable parts are better preserved, when the latter are frequently oiled. It is advisable to oil
the dies and knives often during the work, as they thereby act easier, and are preserved from a too rapid wear, and by keeping
the dies, matrices, and knives in good condition, the tvork is better, and the durability of the punches greater.
