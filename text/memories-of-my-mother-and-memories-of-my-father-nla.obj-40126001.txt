“Memories of
TN my home at Apollo Bay, I have a
picture which shows a girl in her
wedding dress—an old-fashioned dress
of white muslin with blue ribbons that
cost about 12 shillings; made with the
girl’s own hands. You’d like that
picture; everyone who sees it asks
questions. There is something direct
and appealing in the clear blue eyes,
and the wide forehead, above which
are coils of plaited brown hair . . . my
Mother.
My earliest recollections are dim,
but when I was only three years old
I recall lying desperately ill. Mother
was standing beside my cot. The
doctor —so I was told years afterwards
—had just said to her, “I must not
keep the truth from you; the boy will
not live through the night.”
But Mother would not let me die;
some strength, some confidence in her
power to keep me—her faith went out
from her and was given me—and my
long convalescence began in that little
cottage in a crowded Sydney suburb,
with nothing to be seen from the
window but a brick wall, a fig tree,
and a strip of sky.
Of my early school days my mem-
ory is clear. Then it was my Mother
guided me into certain habits of mind
which were the foundation of my
character. Always at evening, just
before I went to sleep, she would en-
courage me to recount many of the
day’s events. We would talk together
quietly of the happy worth-while in-
cidents, to which, although I did not
realise it then, she would very firmly
yet gently and understandingly turn
my thoughts. Always I fell asleep,
my mind filled with those pictures of
which she approved.
Of tugs towing strings of barges
piled high with golden sugarcane;
troops of naked boys swimming out
into midstream to shout and sport in
the wash from a passing steamer;
islands which seemed to be floating
gardens with creepers and flowering
vines trailing on the tide; a flight of
swans or a line of wild geese stringing
out across the evening sky; fish jump-

ing; of sunsets and clouds and their
reflection on the wide river’s surface;
of forests, and bullock teams pulling
logs to the ship’s side; of rainbows
and green hills, and waving fields of
corn.
I could not, she told me, store up
too many such pictures; could not
dream about them too often, they (
were all around me everywhere did I
but recognise them, place them so
they would come at call to the screen
of my memory. If a boy’s mind form-
ed the habit of collecting sunny, bril-
liant pictures, then there was no room
for dark, disquieting records.
As I grew older I added the habit
of wagging it from school to the list
of my misdeeds. Now this must have
worried Mother, but she expressed the
most concern about how I spent my
time, and who was with me. I’d own
up to my absence from school and
tell her about putting my clothes on
a board and swimming over to an is-
land in midstream and then spending
the day in the forest there. The won-
der was, she told me in after years,
not that I played truant, but that I
ever bothered to go to school when all
the exciting, adventurous, joyous
places called a boy to come and play
and be strong and happy.
I do not wish to give the impression
that Mother was careless about my
education; I am just remembering her
understanding love for a little boy
who did not fit into a hard school-
master’s scheme of education.
In those days my chum was a red-
headed boy named Arthur Burgess.
We tied for bottom place at Grafton
Grammar School. .Arthur’s mother,
who was an artist, also had her own
ideas about school. We never had to
tell her how remote from schoolmas-
ters we had spent the day. She un-
derstood. She would put her arms
round us both, draw us to her, and
laugh. I still hear that voice with the
laughter in it, saying, “Never mind,
there’s lots more to do when you grow
up than just grub for money”


“MEMORIES OF MY MOTHER”
Whatever fault or merit there was
in the happy, tolerant way our moth-
ers allowed us to grow up, in the case
of Arthur Burgess it gave the world
a great marine painter whose pictures
hang in the principal galleries of Eur-
ope. I have some myself—reproduc-
tions at a few shillings each, of course.
‘When I was eleven I tried to run
away to sea in a French barque that
came up the river. When about 30
miles downstream my father came
aboard —he had followed in a launch.
The captain handed me over, and I
was taken home in disgrace.
My dear Mother! For a long time
that evening we talked. “And why,”
she began, “Why did you want to leave
me?” I told her because she was so
poor and needed such a lot of things,
and I wanted to be the captain of a
ship and come home with a cargo of
silk dresses, gold ornaments, and roast
turkeys, and wine, and lots of money
for her. And I went on to tell her
what a right sort of ship was the Es-
perance de Saint Malo, with a captain
who spoke French, a mate who could
—and did—knock a man down with
his fists, and of Italian sailors aboard
with rings in their ears and knives in
their belts; and the negro cook, and
another negro, a young boy with curly
black hair; and how kind they all
were to me and said, for certain I’d
make a good sailor.
To all of this my mother listened
She approved the ship, the sailors, the
captain, the work and everything con-
nected with the sea. It was all lovely,
and a fine life for me. Of course I
must be a sailor. Of course.
“But tell me,” she continued, “tell
me, where will you sail to when you
are captain and get all these nice
things for me?” I didn’t quite know.
China or America I thought. “Yes,
and when I sailed my ship to China,
what course would I steer?” I didn’t
know that either. . . Soon she convinc-
ed me that, without education, I’d
never get my ship safely any-
where. And she told me simply
and clearly that a year or two
at a good school would help
me; teach me how to navigate my
ship, how to buy the right things, and
how to trade. Would I postpone my
trip to China—and America —and . . •
and, go to a boarding school; some in-
land town; Goulburn, say.
We looked at a map and traced the
steamers’ course past all the capes
and bays into Sydney harbour, and
then an inland journey by train. On
the map she pointed out a river at
Goulburn; and it might be a big
river; like the Orara, or the Nym-
boyda, even as big as the Clarence. I
must write and tell her all about it.
Thus she tried to plan my future-
set me on a new course—to give me
an incentive to get some education. I
had come to an important crisis in my
life, and with no alarm or worry to
me, this new direction had been so
speedily, and yet so lovingly and un-
selfishly been chosen. It all involved
great sacrifices on her part, financial
and otherwise. She feared and hated
this separation. But her love was
reaching out ahead of me. Her care
would guard me to the utmost of her
strength in unselfish planning; and
the only reward she asked was, that
I’d love her and think sometimes of
her.
The days before parting for school
were made happy. My mother’s tears
and pain were hidden. She gave me
hardly a word of advice, and only one
promise was drawn from me—at the
close of each day I would think of
her. When I’d declare stoutly, “Oh
Mother, I’ll always be thinking of you.”
She would smile, and say, “But I
don’t expect that . Ten minutes each
evening will be enough. Boys have so
many other things to do. I will be
thinking of you always, but mothers
are different.”
But I think she knew then, as for
certain she knew later in my life, her
confidence in me, bound me to her
with ties growing stronger through
the years.
The two days’ passage by sea to
Sydney was altogether different from
what I expected and dreamed about.
I saw none of the capes and bays
marked on the atlas—nothing but the
lead-coloured, heaving water,


“MEMORIES OF MY MOTHER”
Sydney Harbour was an ugly rain-
swept place, but the train, with solid
earth around me, restored my hopes,
though the river at Goulburn —marked
so plainly on the map—turned out to
be a silly little thing full of stones.
That winter there was a heavy fall
of snow; the white plains, flocks of
sheep, apple orchards, and all the
countryside so different from the river
valley up North. I began to like my
new life—and I had my mother’s let-
ters. It was a real joy writing to such
an understanding mother, telling her
of all the wonderful new series of
pictures I was storing in my mind
when I thought of her; for I was keep-
ing my promise to devote ten minutes,
just before I went to sleep, to think-
ing of her. In truth I was thinking
of her far bftener than I promised,
for I was sadly homesick. And, be-
cause I knew it would please her, I
actually won a lot of prizes.
Those were wonderful years. On
holidays I saw much of that moun-
tainous country around Kosciusko, and
where Canberra now stands. One pic-
ture I recall often. The home I stay-
ed in was built on a mountain top
overlooking Araluen Valley. Many
mornings everything below us was
hidden under a sheet of cloud which
the rising sun turned into a lake—an
expanse of pure white. In those days
mining claims were being worked in
the valley. About seven in the morn-
ing the boilers would be lighted to
get up steam for the day’s work. The
hot air rising from these fires would
dissipate the fog immediately above,
and make holes in the ceiling.
While we watched from the moun-
tain top, circular holes would appear,
and patches of field and stretches of
river come into view as though super-
human hands had simultaneously
started to paint pictures at different
spots on the mighty canvas spread
below. As the hour advanced, these
isolated pictures widened and expand-
ed until they became masterpieces of
colour and form, part of the design,
painted as you watched, to remain
there in the sunlight a complete pic-
ture.
Of all this, and similar beauty, I an
wrote about to Mother, sharing it with ) in
her as in the days of my childhood.-
My adolescence merged into man-
hood; a wife, friends, the occupations
and interests associated with a busy
life now predominated; but through
it all was woven a surer knowledge of
my mother’s understanding love, and,
although in no way did I depend upon
her, nothing ever replaced her. When
I was over 40 I needed her again. I
came to another crisis, when her
voice, and her presence steadied me
and helped me greatly.
My letters to her could not be writ-
ten because I’d met with an accident
which endangered my sight. She made
a long journey to find out for herself
about my trouble.
Well, it’s not cheerful to lay in a
dark room while specialists try for
weeks to save your sight. I need not
weary you with any details about my
accident and recovery.
My mother came and nursed me
again. She reiterated her confidence
in me; and it speeded my recovery to
hear her magnifying the little ser-
vices I had rendered her. She brush-
ed aside all the care and sacrifice I
had been responsible for her enduring.
When rather wistfully I would say,
“Here I am, still adding to your anx-
ieties, still unable to stand alone, still
wanting my mother,” she told me a
mother always wished it to be so.
She reminded me of giving her my
first week’s pay. (Yes, I thought, she
devoted it to buying me a present
later.) Of sending home to her a
share in the first gold I found. (Yes,
a far bigger part I kept and spent un-
wisely.) Of the long hours I worked
in badly ventilated mines and mills
so I could send her a few extra shill-
ings. Well, yes, I thought, Ido recall
making a few trifling contributions to
her happiness, but what miserable,
small things beside her contributions
and work for my happiness. But she
would laugh and assure me I had
been a good son, and she never had
a moment’s anxiety about me.
That kindly untruth! Oh, you
mothers. How do you hypnotise your-
selves into believing your ducklings
are swans? But without this belief
us, the world would soon become


“MEMORIES OF MY MOTHER”
utterly and completely base. So con-
tinue being blind to our faults, main-
tain your love for us, so larger patches
of worthiness may grow in our hearts.
None of us are so unworthy as not to
have a few unselfish thoughts center-
ing round you.
The world we men have made for
mothers, is a baser, uglier world than
you would plan for us. Perhaps we
will ask you to come and give us more
of your help in reshaping this clumsy
effort which must appall you.
Your intuition, your mother’s love,
is a safer guide, a surer base to build
upon, than the wisdom of Parliaments
composed . too largely of grown-up
boys—selfish, wanton boys, who miss a
mother’s guiding hand.


“Memories of My Father”
was a bank manager, prob-
ably the most incompetent man
ever In charge of a country branch.
The fact that he had a large family
saved him from dismissal many
times, but finally he was fired; then,
after a long period of anxiety, re-
e'mployed at 25 per cent, of his for-
mer salary, which pay was barely
sufficient to maintain himself, let
alone his wife and a house full of
young children. With business ability
80 per cent, below par, he was a de-
plorable failure as a money maker.
He was a lovable parent for all
that. I have never met any man, in
any walk of life, who lived closer to
the Golden Rule than my old Dad.
None of my brothers and sisters—
now grown to middle age—can ever
recall Father saying anything unkind
or bitter about anyone.
When arrested for a shortage of
over £lOOO in his treasury cash, and
the evidence against him seemed
serious, he did not blame anybody.
The money was gone. He admitted
responsibility, though declaring he
knew nothing about the theft. Later,
when his accountant admitted to hav-
ing substituted an equal weight of
base coin in the sealed bags of sove-
reigns, Father blamed himself. “My
boy,” he said to me at the time, “if I
hadn’t been so easy that young man
wouldn’t have been tempted to steal
all those sovereigns. It’s my own
fault—l should have opened those
bags and made sure the gold was
there.”
When the bank’s auditor and the
police found the gold hidden under a
railway culvert, with only about £2OO
short, Father made up the shortage,
although he had been dismissed, and
£2OO took practically all the assets
he possessed.
Now don’t get the impression Father
was a half-wit. Far from it. He
was unfitted for modern business.
He would have made a good sea-
captain, or probably an earnest, suc-
cessful clergyman or priest. I have
heard few better public speakers and
none with a kindlier, crisper humor.
In Australian historical records, toy
Father’s name will have an abiding
place. His voyages across the Paci-
fic, when he and Captain Bloomfield
were both youngsters, rank as out-
standing feats of seamanship, and
were hazardous undertakings. John
Young was one of the pluckiest
sailors whs ever steered a small craft
out of Port Jackson. He and Bloom-
field fitted out a tiny schooner of
under 30 tons, sailed her with a cargo
of grain to San Francisco —they ar-
rived, they sold the cargo, and sailed
home.
Two men, alone, in the ’4o’s—those
days of uncharted seas.
Strangely enough, Father could
never be induced to talk of this feat.
It troubled him noticeably to have it
mentioned. It was a page he in-
sisted on turning down and forgetting.
In my early life I learned that to
question him about ’Frisco, and some
of the Islands they called at on the
way across the Pacific, was to cause
him pain. Once he said to me, “My
boy, I hope you’ll never see the things
I have seen, and I hope when you
read of them someday you will be
able to judge fairly.”
That voyage, and their return, was
the turning point in Father’s life.
His reaction from the wild days was
to turn to a deep Interest in religion.
Some years back I came across an
account of those voyages and the
months spent in ’Frisco. Candidly,
it is a grim picture. That riotous port
was then the gateway to the newly-
discovered goldfields of California.
Among other details was an account
of the miles of deep mud leading
away from the wharves. Of the con-
gestion of ships; the shortage of
water-side labor; the piles of cargo
dumped higgle-plggely in the weather
to rot uncovered. Tierces of tobacco,
bales of merchandise, cases of food-
stuff, clothing—thousands of tons of
valuable cargo being used to pave the
roads to the ship’s side. They used
the incoming freight much as we
used logs to corduroy, the tniles of
mud we called roads in the horse and
buggy days.


“MEMORIES OF MY FATHER”
There are other pictures in this
diary of the forties —other doings in
port and on the islands they visited
on the way across. All good stuff to
read. My Father’s young manhood
was spent bravely and adventurously.
On many Sundays, when I was a
boy, I drove in a buggy with Father
to near-by towns, where as a lay-
reader he conducted divine service.
When he preached the churches
could not hold the congregations; peo-
ple grouped outside doorways and
under open windows. He spoke with
a natural fluency. He used no notes
and preached with compelling sim-
plicity. Some Sundays he would
preach in Grafton Cathedral, and
here, too, seating accommodation was
often inadequate.
He told me, in after years, that
memorising thousands of lines of
Shakespeare was the secret of his
appeal as a preacher. But I saw not
the least resemblance in my Father’s
gentle style to the sonorous dialogues
of Shakespeare’s characters. I do
know he taught me, over a period of
years, to memorise a great part of
Shakespeare, though this educational
exercise has not, so far, led me into
any ecclesiastical work.
In his declining years, Father
ceased all his preaching, because, he
explained, only a man’s best years
should be given to interpreting The
Master’s life and message. He could
not, he thought, do justice to such a
theme when over 70.
“So you now devote your declin-
ing abilities «to political speeches,” I
commented to him. This was sub-
stantially correct.
One of his last public appearances
was as chairman for his lifelong
friend, George Reid. I did not hear
this speech. My brother sent me an
account, amplifying the newspaper
reports. His letter read as follows; —
“Dad got up, and as usual the noise
subsided. The old boy’s eyes twink-
led, and he came straight to the point.
‘Ladies and gentlemen; I’ll waste no
time; ten minutes is enough for any
speaker, certainly long enough for a
political speech. George Reid is the
one exception. Reid Is more than a
politician—he is a humorist.
“ ‘lf I were preaching a sermon — 1
giving a lesson from The Master’s
life —a reading of Christ’s message,
ah! that deserves a longer period, a
fuller speech; but politics! dear me,
no. No political speech is worth
listening to for more than ten min-
utes.’ ”
“Then he called upon Reid, who
spoke for nearly two hours!”
Father was close to 80 when he
made that, I think, his last public
speech. Some years la'ter he passed
away in his sleep, a happy smile upon
his fine old English face.
One of the most vivid pictures I
retain of Dad is a night of flood on
the Clarence River. It was a record
flood. For days the river rose and
rose. Water was now four feet deep
in the town of South Grafton, and
still rising. All that day business
premises were being cleared of goods.
Those who lived in two-storied houses
moved their gear to the top floor.
In our home—the bank premises—
vouchers, stationery, books and many
other things were stacked on the
bank counter and higher places. The
piano was placed on the dining-room
table. A flood of more than three
feet deep inside the bank building
was an impossibility, everybody
thought. The tall bank safes were
all on specially built stands to keep
valuables above flood level.
After much laborious preparation,
about 10 p.m., our household was
safely installed in the upstair rooms.
All hands were soon in bed, the boys
eagerly anticipating tomorrow’s fun.
At about 3 a.m. Father woke me.
He was obviously worried. Lanterns
were moving about. A boat was un-
loading people on the balcony. My
first thoughts were that the house
bad subsided 10 feet into the water;
but no, it wasn’t that —the flood had
risen another 10 feet. While we
slept, the Orara came down a banker
and piled up this record flood.
The banking chamber and all the
rooms below were full. The water
was over the doors and windows.
There was trouble. All those stacks
of vouchers, books and records, the
safes, the parchment deeds, and a
lot more—all under water.


“MEMORIES OF MY FATHER”
Dad was a strong swimmer, and
he’d taught me to swim.
“Come on, my boy,’.’ he said, “we’ll
do our best to save some deeds and
papers.”
He put some matches in a bottle,
then made up a packet of candles;
wrapped all In some waterproof cloth.
We were, he cautioned me, going to
dive through the doorways, get a
light in the banking chamber, and see
what could be done.
Down stairs we started. Only two
steps, and into the black flood waters.
This area was not quite dark as the
lamp was burning on the top land-
ing. We swam to where a door led
into the banking chamber. Father
told me to follow him, and dived. I
dived after him and came up in what
I knew must be his office. It was
inky, black dark. The ceiling was
almost touching our heads as we
swam in pea soup littered with a lot
of strange objects floating in a
tangle of disorder. By some process
I did not understand, Father got a
match from the bottle and lit a
candle. The light was feeble. Then
another candle was lit rather more
easily. The water was warm though
the air was foul, there being only
18 inches of space between the water
and the ceiling. Doorways and win-
dows were below flood level.
We did our best for maybe an hour.
It was next to hopeless. In that
closelypacked floating mass of bund-
les of papers, furniture and oddments,
it would have been a day’s work to
pick out the valuable documents. We
salvaged a few essential records. The
rest had to remain under water, or
in a sodden mass for another day or
two until the flood subsided.
Some weeks later the board of
directors wrote and blamed Father
for gross incompetence. He should,
they told him, have foreseen this
flood and taken the bank’s papers and
valuables upstairs. This was onlv
half correct. No business man in
Grafton had made preparation other
than what my Father had. Nobody
dreamed of such a flood.
Then the directors wrote to say
Father should have broken through
the top floors and ceilings and re-
trieved much floating material; which
was the sort of thing that directors,
300 miles away from floods, would
think of.
Anyhow the top floor was wanted.
My Mother was there with a baby
brother only three days old. There
were a lot of other children and
mothers taking refuge. There were
dogs and cats, birds In cages. More
than 20 people huddled in wet dis-
comfort in two rooms and a balcony.
More people kept arriving. All these
had to be fed, dried and cared for
somehow. Ours was one of the few
two-storied houses; single storey
homes were visible only as rooftops
if that!
Pull up floors so as to save some
vouchers and documents? Be hanged!
The three-day-old baby might fall
into the hole in the floor and be lost.
Father thought this a more serious
risk than the loss of mere papers
and records.
So did Mother.
Of course Father was disrated to
a tiny branch near Sydney, where,
as told you, he carelessly allowed his
accountant to get away with over
£lOOO. This was the end of his
business career.
He spent another 10 years doing
petty routine work in the basement
of head office. Then, as his sons
grew up, he retired. Five of his boys
were out and about on the goldfields
of West Australia, so his last years
were spent in a pleasant house set
amid flowers and lawns in the garden
suburb of Beecroft. He was the jol-
liest, most contented old chap who
ever planted some Phlox Drummondi
or wrote a letter to the editor of a
daily paper.
I have inherited much of my
Father’s incompetence round money
matters. I’ve wasted many small
sums of money in silly investments;
but there is one wild-cat spending of
£5O which I recall with satisfaction.
When Father retired, the bank
gave him £5O. A lump sum of
fifty. This angered me; so on my
first holiday home from the West I
bought 50 of this bank’s shares to
give my Father a vote and allow him
to tick off the directors who had dis-
rated him,


“MEMORIES OF MY FATHER”
I registered the shares in Dad’s
name, sent him to the general meet-
ing and outlined a speech which he
made from the body of the hall.
Here is the speech:—
“Mr. Chairman: I know this is the
second reconstruction of this institu-
tion. It may recover. It may not.
I know, too, that I was given £5O on
retiring after 40 years’ service. I
want to return that money. I feel I
should. So, I have invested it in
your shares, which we all know are
not likely to pay dividends in my
lifetime —if ever.”
You’d need to know Father’s style
—the quiet tones into which he could
put such meaning—to understand the
effect of that statement.
It was the one revengeful act of
Father’s life. I am to blame. Those
were my salad days.
It was a stupid way to waste
money.
How much better to have printed
some of Fathers’ sermons, or given
his warm, human, understanding let-
ters to his sons; or to give the world
copies of the diary he wrote as a
hoy coming out from England in the
“Woodlark” in 1836. A boy’s impres-
sion of that long voyage. The diary
of a farmer’s son, who, 100 years ago,
with 11 brothers and sisters, sailed
across the world to find living room
in this new and brighter land.
