ANALYSIS OF THE
MARITIME TRADE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM,
1889-9 L.
The following tables have been compiled for tbe purpose of
extracting from tbe annual volume of the “ Trade of tbe United
Kingdom with Foreign Countries and British Possessions,” laid
periodically before Parliament, much valuable information which
lies buried therein for want of analysis and collation. It seemed
likely that the results might throw light npon some of the
questions now under discussion in connection with commercial
legislation, and the time for publishing them seemed appropriate
on the occasion of the recent Congress of Delegates from British
and Colonial Chambers of Commerce, but it was not found possible
to complete them in time for that meeting. They will, however,
be available for consideration whenever any proposals mooted in
that congress shall be brought forward for serious discussion.
The chief object aimed at has been to bring into view in a
condensed form: —
The Trade with each country.
“ Balance of trade ” (so called) with each.
Composition of the imports : food, raw materials, &c.
Composition of the exports.
Proportions and tendencies of colonial and foreign trade.
Competition of foreign with British manufactures.
Value of the transit trade.
Maintenance of supplies of food and raw materials.
Operation of a preferential duty throughout the empire.
General review of trade beyond seas, 1854-71.
The principal tables relate to the year 1889, which was the
latest for which the returns were published when the present com-
pilation was commenced. The returns for 1890 and 1891 have
since been published ; but independently of the labour of a fresh
compilation, there is a good reason for adhering to the year 1889,
inasmuch as the trade of the United Kingdom was then in a
normal and flourishing condition, undisturbed by the financial
crises and revolutions in South America, and by the prospect of tariff
changes in the United States, which have affected the trade of
subsequent years. Trade had recovered from the depression of the
years 1884-88, and had again reached a point from which it may
be hoped it will not permanently recede. It affords, therefore, a
good, or rather the best, starting point for similar comparisons in
future years.

1. Epitome of trade with each country.
The first table, No. I,* is too voluminous to be embodied in this
review ; it is therefore inserted as an Appendix. But a specimen
is given to show its nature, and some of the principal lessons to
be derived from it will be noted here. The table contains a
synopsis, in the most concise form, of the trade of each country
with the United Kingdom, showing the total value of imports and
exports, the separate value of British and of foreign and colonial
exports, and the percentage proportion of the principal articles of
import and export, enumerating all those which contributed as
much as 2 per cent, to the aggregate trade (import and export
respectively) of the country. Out of the 108 countries enumerated
in the customs returns, 28, relating chiefly to small dependencies of
foreign countries, have been omitted, as the amount of their trade,
either import or export, is less than half-a-million £ in the year,
and is too small to call for notice.
The following are specimens of two countries at the opposite
ends of the scale: the contrast between them is well marked :

An analysis of this table in the Appendix produces some note-
worthy results. The first is the very small number of articles
which any single country contributes in a considerable quantity to
its trade with the United Kingdom. Of the 77 countries of which
the imports are shown in the table, only 13 contributed more than
five articles to an extent above 2 per cent, of the aggregate value.
f 8 countries contributed only 1 principal article of import.
| 16 „ 2 principal articles of import.
The contribution to the export trade is less contracted, but is
still very small. Of the 78 countries of which- the exports are
shown, 34 took not more than 5 principal articles, and only 5 took
more than 10. Thus —
The following epitome contains an enumeration of the countries
entering into each of the above classes, which, although somewhat
voluminous, will be found to abound in interesting details which
will repay examination :
The figures preceding the name of each country indicate the
class in which it stands as regards the other branch of trade,
imports or exports respectively.
The percentage proportion of the first of the principal articles
in each country is inserted, from which the comparative import-
ance of the other articles may be seen at a glance. The exact pro-
portion of each is stated in the Appendix.

and a smaller proportion of any single article. The principal
countries of Europe, the United States, and most of our principal
colonies, figure among the countries at the top of the preceding
lists, both of imports and exports.
A very significant feature of the above table is that the mass
of imports from almost every country consists of food and raw
materials. The only exceptions are silk goods, 2'B per cent, from
China, and 4'B per cent, from Japan; iron manufactures, 5 pci 1
cent, from Sweden ; woollen goods, 4 per cent, from Turkey;
woollens, 5'5 per cent, from Germany; woollen, silk, cotton,
leather, and iron goods, in all 26T per cent., from Holland; 437
per cent, of the same, and glass, from Belgium ; and 40 - 7 per cent,
of the same, and brass and bronze wares, from France. The
imports from Holland and Belgium are doubtless to a considerable
extent of French, German, and Swiss origin.
It would scarcely be profitable to specify the number of enume-
rated articles which enter into the trade of each country, but of
which less than 2 per cent, of the aggregate enters into the
account; but it may be mentioned as an example of a largely
developed trade, that, in the case of France, while 13 articles make
up 67 per cent, of the imports, 95 enumerated articles and B'3
per cent, of unenumerated articles make up the balance of 83 per
cent.; and that while 9 principal articles make up 62 per cent,
of the exports, 49 enumerated articles of British produce and
manufacture, and 53 articles of enumerated foreign and colonial
produce, with 6'4 per cent, of unenumerated articles in the two
classes, make up the balance of 38 per cent.
The most notable features of the export trade were —

China.

Those to which apparel was sent were all British possessions—
Cape of Good Hope, Natal, South Australia, West Australia,
Tasmania, Newfoundland, Falkland Islands.
Those to which woollen yarn and goods were sent were
Germany and France ; machinery to Spain; wheat and flour to
the Channel Islands.
3°. All the countries to which more than 9 principal articles
were sent wore British possessions; which fact points to the
conclusion, that the colonies take a larger variety of miscellaneous
British manufactures than foreign countries, including a. number
of what may he called domestic manufactures, with which most
civilised countries supply themselves, and of which most young or
semi-civilised countries have not yet acquired the use. The rapid
diminution of this source of demand under the operation of the
protective tariffs adopted in so many leading colonies may he safely
predicted. The latest proof of this is contained in the “ Times ”
of 19th August: “ The Treasurer of Queensland also stated that
it was his intention to increase the customs duties, with the view
both of enhancing the revenues and of encouraging local industries.”
“ Increased duties would he imposed on beer , hoots, hops, cheese,
dried fruits, picldes, flour, wheat, tobacco and malt.” The value of
the four articles in italics above, which were exported to Queensland
in 1891 can be stated: they amounted to 10 per cent, of the total
exports to that colony.
In almost every case of countries taking more than seven articles,
the proportion of the chief one or two articles was comparatively
small.
2. Countries showing an excess of Imports or Exports.
The next table, No. 2, shows to what extent, and in respect to
what countries, the value of imports exceeds that of exports:—
The difference in the proportion of exports to foreign countries
and British possessions respectively is slightly less than 8 per cent,
2°. Of the 28 enumerated British possessions, 16 rank in the
class of “ imports in excess,” and 12 in that of “exports in excess.”
Ceylon stands at the head of the former class. Of the 36 enumerated
foreign countries, 24 rank in the former and 12 in the latter class.
3°. Most of the European countries are included in the first
class. The exceptions are Germany, European Turkey, and Italy.

goes far to counterbalance the excess of Imports from the old.

3. Analysis of Imports.
Table No. 3 exhibits an analysis of the import trade of the
United Kingdom, under the separate heads of food, raw materials,
manufactured articles, and miscellaneous, with the proportion of
each class imported from foreign countries and British possessions
respectively, in the year 1889.
The following are the principal results : —
1°. Of the total imports —
178'0 million £ = 4P7 per cent., consisted of food.

2°. Comparing the proportions of imports received from
foreign countries and from British possessions :
Of the total amount (427'2 million £) —
330 - l min. £ = 77"3 per cent., came from foreign countries.
97"1 „ = 22"7 „ British possessions.
Of articles of food (178 million £) —
148 8 min. £ = 83'6 per cent., came from foreign countries.
29'2 „ = 16'4 „ British possessions.
In this class rice, tea, and spices, were supplied in larger
quantities by British possessions than by foreign countries.
Of raw materials (181"4 million £) —
116'3 min. £ = 64‘1 per cent, came from foreign countries.
651 „ =35 9 „ British possessions.
In this class sheep’s wool and jute were supplied in larger
quantities by British possessions than by foreign countries,
and constituted more than half (53-3 per cent.) of the total
value imported from the former. But nearly one-half of these
two articles (49 4 per cent.) was re-exported in the same year.

The above figures will afford a means of judging how far the
imposition of a preferential duty in the United Kingdom is likely
to enable the British possessions to supply the wants of the former
within a measurable distance of time, and without a sensible
enhancement of prices to the consumer.

4. Analysis of Exports.
The next table, No. 4, is a somewhat similar analysis of the
exports of British and Irish produce and manufactures.
It has already been shown* that cotton goods and yarn head
the list of exports to 43 out of 77 countries. This table shows
that they form 28’3 per cent of the total value of exports.
It will further be seen —
I°. That 5 articles, cotton goods and yarns, iron and steel
manufactures, woollen goods and yarn, machinery, and coal form
62’9 per cent, of the total value of exports.
2°. That only 6 others, viz., linen goods and yarn, apparel, jute
goods and yarn, hardwares, silk goods and thrown silk, and sheep’s
wool contribute from IT to 2’6 per cent, each to the aggregate.
3°. That the remaining 44 enumerated articles contribute
each less than 1 per cent., viz., from 09 down to o*2 per cent, to
the aggregate.
The table distinguishes the articles of which a larger proportion
is exported to British possessions than to foreign countries. They
are 16 out of the total number of 62; but with the exception of
apparel, which forms 2 per cent, of the aggregate, and haber-
dashery, beer and ale, leather manufactures and paper, which
contribute each from O’7 to o’9 of the aggregate, they do not
contribute more than o’s per cent, each, and are therefore of minor
importance.
This table supplies a measure of the extent to which each
manufacture and article of native produce contributes to the
export trade of the United Kingdom, and also of the extent by
which the trade of this country may be affected by the imposition
of duties on particular articles in other countries.

* The articles marked with an asterisk in the last column

The following table, No. 5, furnishes a view of the amount of
foreign manufactures of each kind imported and retained for con-
sumption, after deducting the amount re-exported in the same year.
By comparing these with the amount of the same articles of British
manufacture exported in the same year, it can be seen which
articles may be assumed to enter into competition with British
manufactures, and to what extent they compete.
Thus, at the head of the table are articles of which either
no amount of British manufacture was exported, or so small an
amount that it was not enumerated in the printed returns. These
. are lace, toys, watches, manufactured cork, artificial flowers, beads,


manufactured tin, and manufactures of hair. To these may ho
added zinc manufactures, as the value of British exported was so
small. The total value of these 9 articles imported and retained
for consumption was little more than 3 million £, out of a total
importation of 427 million £, or less than 1 per cent.
The next category, in which the exportation of British manu-
factured goods, was less than the importation of foreign, seems to
embrace those articles —11 in number —in which the competition
with the British manufacturer is most severe. They are refined
sugar, dye stuffs (aniline, &c.), spirits, silk manufactures, certain
descriptions of paper, musical instruments, clocks, skins and furs
manufactured, leather dressed and japanned, matches and glass
manufactures. The total value of these was 28 million £, which
is 6’6 per cent, of the total importation. The total exportation of
British goods in this category was 7 million £, or 25 per cent, of
the foreign importation.
The excess of foreign importation varied from tenfold in the
case of refined sugar, to 41 per cent, in the case of glass manufac-
tures. In the case of silk manufactures, which is the most
important item in the category, the excess was more than fourfold.
The above 20 articles, furnishing 31 million £ of imports,
formed exactly one-half of the total value of manufactured goods
imported in the same year, which is shown in Table 3 to have been
62 million £.
In the case of leather manufactures (boots, shoes aud gloves),
and manufactured cocoa, the imports and exports about balanced
one another.
Among the remaining articles, the proportion of foreign imports
rapidly decreases. The three most important items are (a) woollen
yarn and manufactures, (6) iron and steel manufactures, and (c)
cotton yarn and manufactures. Of the first (a) the foreign
importations amounted to million £, while the British exporta-
tion amounted to 25| million £, the proportion of foreign being-
-45 per cent. Of the second ( b ) the foreign importation was
3 million £, and the British exportation million £, the propor-
tion of the former being under 11 per cent. Of the third (c) the
foreign importation was 2 million £, the British exportation 7Of mil-
lion £, the proportion of the former being under o'3 per cent.
The table concludes with a list of 20 articles, of which none is
enumerated as having been imported from abroad, and the export
of which amounted to 39 million £. The principal of these are
machinery, apparel and slops, hardwares, jute manufactures, rail-
way carriages, and beer and ale.
It must be borne in mind in examining this table, that the
importation of any foreign manufactured articl does not neces-


of the same articles of British Manufacture Exported from the
United Kingdom in the Year 1889.

sarily imply competition with British manufactures. The produc-
tion of many is unsuited to this country, and the exclusion, or
enhancement of the price, of the foreign article would only
deprive the British consumer of the free use or enjoyment of it.

6. Value of the Transit

esent full
details with
The next six tables, Nos. 6 to 11, present full details with
regard to the transit trade, the principal articles of which it con-
sists, the countries to which the goods were exported, and, in the
case of transhipment, the countries from which they were imported.
Table No. 6, brings into view the proportion of imports which
are re-exported, and the amount left for consumption, also the


proportion which the export of British merchandise bears to the
latter, bringing the account down to the latest date.
It shows —
I°. That the proportion of imports re-exported averaged 16 per
cent, in 1885-89, and that in the last two years it has been
decreasing.
2°. That the proportion of Britsh merchandise exported to
the amonnt of imports retained for consumption, averaged in
1885-89 7T3 per cent.; that it rose greatly in 1890, and fell
greatly in 1891, but the average of the two years tallies almost
exactly with the average of the preceding five years.
3°. That a remarkable advance was made in each branch of
trade in the year 1889, and has been fairly maintained to the close
of 1891. Comparing the three years 1889-91 with the three pre-
ceding years 1886-88 —
The total imports have increased 15"7 per cent.
The imports left for consumption have increased 17‘7 „
The exports of British goods have increased .... 12"9 ~
4°. The import and consumption columns show-a large increase
in 1891 ; the columns of British exports and of re-exports show
a large decrease, for which doubtless the derangement of the
labour market is largely responsible. Cargoes arriving must be
unloaded, if a market for them is open; but at the same time it
must be noted that the tonnage of ships entering with cargoes,
which increased by 500,000 in 1890, decreased by 900,000 in 1891.
Cargoes for warehouse or transhipment were diverted, and dis-
charged at foreign ports. The difficulty and increased cost of
shipment had a serious effect upon the export trade.

There has not been much variation in the total annual value of
foreign and colonial merchandise re-exported during the last ten
years, except in the years of depression 1885-87 and in 1891. The
proportion sent to foreign countries and to British possessions has
remained about the same, averaging respectively in the ten years
88’5 and ITS per cent.

lie-exported to Foreign Countries and British Possessions respec-
tivety in each Year, 1882-91.
Value of Merchandise Ec-exported.
Table No. 8 shows the value of the principal articles re-exported
in each of the last three years, and, for the sake of comparison, the
value of each re-exported in 1854 has been added. An examina-
tion of the list will show how greatly this country is interested in
the intermediate transport of so large a volume of merchandise, —in
the possession of so large a depot of articles of primary importance,
consisting chiefly of food and raw materials, available for home
consumption whenever required, —and in the retention of the means
of interchange with other countries upon which we depend for
supplies essential even to our national existence.
To endanger the continuance of these advantages by the
reimposition of a customs system of bonding imports, which
would be the necessary accompaniment of a general tariff on
imports, with a preferential duty in favour of the colonies, would
appear to be a suicidal policy.
The list of articles, headed by sheep’s wool, shows how largely
the colonies are interested in the maintenance of this country as
the chief depot of the world; and it requires little foresight to
perceive how easily it may, under provocation or attempts at

Table N”o. 9. — Value of Foreign and Colonial Produce sent to each
Principal Country in the Years 1854 and 1889-91.
In connection with the preceding tables must be taken into
account the value of merchandise imported from, and transhipped
to, foreign ports, which is not included in the returns of imports
and exports. It has averaged above 10 million £in the last five
years, having risen to 12| million £ in 1880 and 1881, hut it has
not increased since 1854 in the same ratio as re-exports.

In connection -with the subject of re-exportation the following
table, No. 11, shows the quantities of raw cotton and sheep’s wool
imported and re-exported in the years 1885-90.
On the average of 1885-89, one-seventh (14’5 per cent.) of the
raw cotton imported was re-exported, and more than one-half
(53 per cent.) of the sheep’s wool. This table illustrates two points :
I°, The value of this transit trade to the shipping of this country,
and 2°, the fact that we have advanced far beyond our means of
consuming in the United Kingdom the only important article of
Australian export. Sheep’s wool formed more than two-thirds (70
per cent.) of the total imports from Australia in 1889. The only
other import of importance was Metals (Silver Ore, Tin, Lead, and
Copper), amounting to 9’4 per cent.

compared with that of cargoes outwards, which is just 50 per
cent., is another notable fact, to be easily accounted for by the vast
quantity of coal exported —bulky and low priced —compared with
the majority of other articles. The large exportation of metals and
machinery has also probably contributed to the result. It is safe
to infer, from the general uniformity of the annual averages in these
two columns, that they afford a sufficiently correct index of the
fluctuations in the price of the general mass of imports and exports.
Table No. 12. — Average Value per Ton of Imports and Exports in
and from the United Kingdom in the Years 1887-91.


It is also worthy of remark that the tonnage of vessels clearing
with cargoes exceeded that of vessels entering with cargoes by
nearly 5 million tons, as much as 14 per cent. The difference is
mainly accounted for by a difference of more than 4 millions in
the tonnage of vessels arriving in ballast over that of vessels
clearing in ballast. The balance probably consists of old vessels
broken up and of new vessels built for, or bought by, foreigners.
The proportion of vessels entering in ballast in 1890 was 21 per
cent., and of vessels clearing in ballast 9'5 per cent. Of the entries
there was only 1 per cent, difference between the proportions of
British and foreign vessels, but of the clearances 29T of British
were in ballast, and 16'0 of foreign.
It is obvious that this method of measuring the average value
of imports and exports at different periods can only be applied
to an insular country like the United Kingdom, where all foreign
trade must be carried on by sea, and therefore a similar comparison
cannot be applied to most other countries. But Germany affords
a somewhat similar means of comparison, as the customs returns of
that country furnish the quantity of all articles of import and
export in tons as well as in value (marcs.)
The following table, Ko. 18, gives a comparative view of these
returns for Germany and the United Kingdom in the years 1880-91.
It does not afford any means of comparing values between the two
countries, but it shows the increase or decrease in each year in
each country, and the differences in this respect between the two
countries. It also shows the differences in the relative values of
imports and exports in each. The results are sufficiently striking.
1. On the average of 1880-81 compared with that of 1890-91,
the average value of imports fell in Germany 27‘7 per cent., and
in the United Kingdom, 10’3 per cent. On the other hand the
average value of exports in Germany fell between those two periods
only 5‘5 per cent.; in the United Kingdom it fell 16‘5 per cent.
2. The difference between the values per ton of imports and
exports in Germany in 1880-91 averaged 3 per cent.; in the United
Kingdom 35 per cent. Coal is the chief factor in causing this
immense difference. There is no means of separating it for the
purpose of this comparison.
3, In Germany the average value per ton of imports exceeded
that of expoits during the first two years, 1880-81, by 10’3 per
cent., but it decreased throughout the period, until in the last two
years, 1890-91, it fell short of that of exports by 17'1 per cent.
In the United Kingdom, on the contrary, in 1880-81 it exceeded
the value of exports by 34‘5 per cent., and owing to the lesser
decrease in the value of imports, the proportion had not fallen
below 33*1 per cent, in 1890-91.

In connection with the preceding, the next table, Ho. 14, which
shows the
average value per
ton of the imports and exports to and
from each country, illustrates the extreme differences in
the value
of the trade with different
countries to the shipowner and the
merchant respectively. A cargo from Peru
averages 50£. a ton,
but the tonnage employed is
small; a cargo from Norway averages
2 1. 18s. per ton, hut the tonnage conveying it is more than 60-fold
Table No. 13. —Comparison of the Increase or Decrease of the Average Value of
Imports and Exports in Germany and the United Kingdom respectively, in
the Years 1880-91.
greater than that coming from Peru. So in exports, a ton of
exports to China averages 68Z. in value, and a ton to Denmark
only 21. 165.; but the tonnage conveying the latter is 11-fold
greater. In each division of the table a column has been added to
indicate the difference in each country between the average value
of imports and exports. This comparison shows that in the trade
with most countries the average value of cargoes imported into
the United Kingdom is double, or more than double the value of
cargoes exported; in the case of Denmark sevenfold more. The
exceptions are China, British North America, and Greece, in which
the average value of the imports exceeds that of the exports; and
Turkey, Spain, Norway, and the Channel Islands, in which the
value does not greatly differ. In the classification of the countries
it was found necessary to follow the arrangement of countries
adopted in the Board of Trade monthly accounts relating to Trade
and Navigation.

The magnitude and importance of the exportation of cotton
manufactures has been shown in Table No. 4 (p. 24). Table No. 15,
next following, shows the notable fact that on the average of the


five years 1886-90, we imported and consumed raw cotton to the
value of 36 million £, and after supplying, say 36 millions of the
inhabitants of these islands with cotton goods manufactured there-
from, we exported cotton manufactures (including twist) to the
value of 71 million £, or almost double the value of the raw
material worked up in our factories.

In connection with this the following table, No. 17, shows
the probably unsuspected fact that the proportion of wheat and
wheat flour imported from the United States, instead of increasing
countries are great, and in 1891 the proportion of the importation
from the United States increased considerably, to nearly 80 per
cent. (79’4). The export of cotton manufactures remained about
the same, 71’4 per cent.
Another article of paramount importance in the import trade
with the United States is the article of corn and flour. The
amount and proportion of this, and of raw cotton, in comparison
with all other articles in the same trade, are shown in the following
table, No. 16 :
For the five years 1885-89, the average imports from the United
States consisted of —
100 -o
Nearly three-fifths of the whole consisted of the above two
articles.
Table No. 16. —Value and Percentage Proportion of Imports from
of late years has materially decreased. The great falling off in the
importation of maize from the United States since 1880, and the
violent fluctuations shown in the same table, indicate the effects
both of an increasing home demand in that country, and of largely
fluctuating harvests.


Table No. 17.— Quantities of Wheat and of Wheat Flour in
Equivalent of Grain, and of Maize, Imported into the United
Kingdom from all Countries, and from the United States
separately, and Proportion
of the latter to the former, in each
of the Years 1876-91
The following table, No.
18, which shows the quantities of wheat
and wheat flour imported into
the United Kingdom during the last
sixteen years from each of the principal wheat producing countries
of the world, will furnish a complete view of the present sources
of supply, under a natural and unrestricted regime of free admis-
sion, and data on which to form a correct judgment as to the
probability of their being materially influenced by the adoption of
any artificial methods to divert them.
On the average of the years 1876-91, with free access to our
ports, the United States supplied more than half of the wheat and
wheat flour imported, the British possessions less than a fifth,
Russia a seventh (but up to 1888 only a ninth), and all other
countries rather more than a seventh. British North America
supplied less in the last five years of the period than in the first
five. Its proportion to the supply from the United States averaged
9 per cent., and was a fourth less in the last than in the first five
years.

Upon such data, it may fairly be asked, by what means, within
what time, and for what period, would the imposition of a prefer-
ential or discriminating
y duty of
5 per
cent., or less
than 2s. a
quarter, have an effect upon
the relative production and exporta-
tion
of foreign
and colonial competing countries,
taking into
account the elements of population as affecting the means of
production,
geographical position as affecting the cost of transport,
and the other existing
circumstances in
lluencing the facilities of
commercial intercourse ?
Analysis of the Maritime Trade

United States as regards the supply of the two staple articles of
food and raw material, it remains to add two tables; No. 19 show-

United Kingdom with the rest of the world, and No. 20 showing
that for many years past, with two exceptions, viz., 1886 and
1888, the import trade with the States has increased both slowly
and moderately, and that the export trade during the same period,
with one exception, viz., 1891, has increased steadily, and in at
least an equal proportion.
It will be seen that the import trade with the States has
fluctuated between one-fifth and one-fourth of the total import
trade, and that the export trade has averaged one-seventh.
Table No. 20 shows the progress of our trade, import and
export, with the United States since 1854, omitting the years
affected by the civil war in that country 1861-65.
It will be seen that from 1876 to 1890 there has been a greater
proportionate increase in the exports than in the imports. The
large decrease in 1891 has been owing to two causes —the operation
of the KcKinley Tariff and the stimulus which the prospect of its
enactment gave to the exports in the two preceding years.
In the last seven years, with the exception of 1891, the value of
exports has equalled, or surpassed that of imports, exclusive of
raw cotton, grain and flour.*

9. Serious Objection
In the discussion of the
duty in all parts of
to a Preferential Duty.
proposals for imposing a preferential
the British
Empire in favour of imports from
all other parts of that empire, there is a very important considera-
tion, which appears to have been generally overlooked, viz., the
inconvenience, expense, and intolerable delay that would be imposed
upon commerce by the revival in England, and the universal
adoption elsewhere, not only of a duty upon every article, but of a
discriminating duty upon every article, which would necessitate
the revival of the system of certificates of origin.
The present generation of merchants, in the United Kingdom
at least, is happily unacquainted with the operation of this system.
Its abolition in these islands has contributed largely to the expan-
sion of the trade of the empire. Its re-imposition here, and its
universal introduction into every part of the empire, considering the
immense increase of trade at the present day, would strike a blow
at the freedom of commerce, which would go far to counteract any
advantage arising from the proposed difference in the rate of duty.
The expense, too, of collecting a customs duty under such a
system is a serious objection to its adoption. The data for making
a precise comparison between the cost of collecting customs duties
in the United Kingdom before and after the tariff changes in 1845
and 1860 are not available, but a return, printed in the “ Thirty-
sixth report of the Commissioners of H.M.’s Customs ” will give
some idea of the difference.
In 1861-62, just after the last complete change, a staff of 5,335
officers was employed, at a charge for effective service of 753,103 Z.
in collecting a gross customs revenue of 23'9 million £, and in


handling and passing imports and exports to the value of 393
million £. In 1891-92 a staff of 4,230 officers (1,100 less)
was employed at a charge of 711,2902. (41,8132. less) in col-
lecting a revenue of about the same amount, 232 million £, and
in handling and passing imports and exports to the estimated value,
at greatly reduced prices, of 744 million £, or nearly double the
amount in value, and probably half as much again in bulk.
Some idea of the increase of labour may be formed from the
following statements: —
In 1891 the number of entries passed for goods imported into
the United Kingdom was 1,843,829.* Of these 153,348, or only
B'3 per cent., were for goods chargeable with duty. If the for-
malities required by the examination for proof of origin were
applied to the remaining nine-tenths of the whole number, and
those required by the calculation and levy of duties were applied
to the portion of them coming from foreign countries (77'8 per
cent.), of which considerably more than one-half are passed at the
two ports of London and Liverpool alone, a still inadequate concep-
tion may be formed of the additional labour and delay in the receipt
of customs. But this takes no account of the more than correspond-
ing trouble and expense in every merchant’s counting house.
In 1861-62 the average cost of passing goods valued at that
time at 1 million £ was 1,99 72., say 2,0002.; the average cost in
1891-92 of passing 1 million £, at present reduced prices, was
9552., less than half. If allowance were made for the increase of
bulk, it would not be too much to say that the present cost of the
customs establishment compared with the work done is one-third
of what it was thirty years ago. Some part of this reduction is
certainly due to improved administration in this department, but it
is beyond doubt that a return to the old system of universal duties
combined with a universal discriminating rate of duty, would
increase the cost of the customs establishment of this country
alone by a sum of between 250,0002. and 500,0002. a year, which,
however, would prove a lesser evil than the hindrances and losses
which it would inflict on commercial intercourse.
10. Trade with British Possessions.
The following table, Ko. 21, exhibits a comparison of the export
trade to foreign countries and British possessions respectively in
the last six years.
It shows that while the total exports to foreign countries
between 1886 and 1891 increased by 28'7 million £ or 15’4 per
cent., the corresponding increase to British possessions amounted
to 3'B million £or 4’6 per cent. In like manner while the exports

exactly half as many.

of British produce and manufactures to foreign countries increased
hy 24"4 million £, or 17'8 per cent., the corresponding increase to
British possessions was 6‘9 million £, or 9T per cent.
Table No. 21. — Comparative amount and increase of Total and
British Exports from the United Kingdom to Foreign Countries
and British Possessions respectively, in the Years 1886-91.
The proportion also of British to total exports shipped to
foreign countries, made a substantial advance between the begin-
ning and end of the period, while the same to British possessions
Avas less than 1 per cent. The larger proportion of exports of
British goods to the colonies, averaging 92T per cent., may be
atti’ibuted to two causes. The United Kingdom is the largest and
most convenient entrepot for the produce of the whole world, and a
large portion of the loans raised in England by British possessions
is shipped to them in the shape of British goods.
11. Trade of Australian Colonies.
The following comparison (in Table 22) of the trade of Australia,
and of each of the colonies within its area in the years 1885 and
1889, the first being the year analysed in the Sequel to the
11 Synopsis of the tariffs and trade of the British Empire,” and
the second being the last year for Avhich the full information is
furnished in the colonial Abstract of the Board of Trade, displays
some noteworthy results.

2. The changes in the several colonies were as follows :
The differences between New South Wales and Victoria in the
two years, the large increase both of imports and exports in South
Australia, the large increase of exports from Queensland, and the
absence of progress in Tasmania, are points worthy of notice.
3. The relative proportions at the two periods of the different
branches of trade also call for notice. The proportions of both
the import and export trades with the United Kingdom has fallen
off, while those of the inter-Australian and foreign trades have
increased. The trade with other British possessions is very small,
and has not increased.
Total Trade of Australian Colonies.
4. It will be seen that on the mean of the two years the import
trade of Australia with foreign countries amounted only to 105
per cent., and the export trade with the same to 9'4 per cent.
The increase between the two years in the import trade, in which
alone the United Kingdom is concerned, was little more than
1 per cent. These figures have a bearing upon the question of the
advantage to be gained by the United Kingdom from the imposi-
tion of a discriminating duty in its favour in Australia.
5. The large and increasing proportions of the inter-Australian
trade suggest the inquiry which the accounts do not satisfy, as to
the double entry of a certain portion of goods which are imported
from abroad into one Australian colony, and are re-exported to
another, figuring thus as imports in two colonies, and as exports,
but only in transit, in one. This is conspicuously the case in the
trade of Western Australia, which draws a large portion of its
imports from or through New South Wales or Victoria.

A previous remark upon the slight proportion and slow
growth of the trade of Australia with foreign countries applies to
most other colonies. In 1885—the figures are not at hand for
1889—the proportion of imports from foreign countries into all
the British Possessions was 23'7 per cent, of the whole. Canada
was an exception on account of its geographical connection with
the United States. Its imports from the United Kingdom in 1885
were 48 - 3 per cent, of the whole, and they fell to 38‘5 per cent, in
1889; its imports from foreign countries were 57‘4 per cent, in
1885, and about 60 per cent, in 1889. But it seems alike impolitic
and fruitless to interpose any extraneous obstacle to the freest
possible communication between the two countries.
12. Further Remarks on a Preferential Duty.
The following statement shows all the articles, in the produc-
tion of which, according to the import returns of 1889, each
British Possession is chiefly interested. It will be seen that if
food and raw materials are to be excluded from the operation of a
preferential duty, the colonies have no interest in the imposition
of such a duty. It has been shown in Table Ko. 3, that they
have an infinitesimal interest in the imposition of such a duty on
manufactured goods. One-third of the articles already command
the home market, and would derive no benefit from a preferential
duty in their favour. A column has been added to show the per-
centage proportion of each article imported in 1889 from all the
British Possessions.
The value of the following 26 articles imported in 1889 was
million £ from foreign countries, and 71| million £, or just
one half, from British Possessions. The aggregate of the two,
217 million £, was nearly half of the total imports, 427 million £.

At least three rates have been proposed by different advocates
of a preferential duty on foreign imports, viz., 2,5, and 10 per
cent. The following calculation, founded on Table 3, at p. 21, will
show the amount that would be levied on foreign imports into the
United Kingdom at each rate, based on the importation of 1889 :
The equivalent offered for this by the imposition of correspond-
ing rates on foreign imports throughout the whole of the British
Possessions, calculated upon their importation in 1885, as shown in
the author’s “ Synopsis of Tariffs and Trade of the British Empire,”
would be —
If food and raw materials should be exempt, the duty on tbe
remainder would be out of all proportion to the cost of collection
and the interruption to trade, and would in most cases have no
other effect than to enhance prices to the consumer.
There is another effect of the imposition of a general preferen-
tial duty, which does not appear to have been considered. It will
strike equally countries with friendly and unfriendly tariffs ; or a
system of discrimination, or in other words, retaliation, must be
established from the outset, with results which, it is easy to foresee,
would be destructive to the trade of this country.


13. Review of Trade of United Kingdom, 1854-91.
This review would be incomplete without some reference to
the shipping trade of the United Kingdom, the national import-
ance and value of which in its manifold ramifications does not fall
short of that of the import and export trades; without which,
indeed, these trades could not exist, and upon the growth and
prosperity of which must mainly depend the extension and profit-
able prosecution of the external trade of the country. But it
would extend the present review too widely to attempt a similar
analysis of the shipping returns.
Very full information with regard to the shipping trade has
been given in the exhaustive paper read before the Royal Statis-
tical Society in May last by Mr. John Glover, which was printed
in the June number of the Journal of that Society. On the present
occasion it seems sufficient to give a summary of entrances and
clearances in connection with the declared value of imports and
exports up to date in the form adopted in the “ Sequel to the
Synopsis of the Tariffs and Trade of the British Empire,”
circulated by the Council of the Imperial Federation League in
1889, together with the tables of curves which illustrate those
returns, also brought up to the close of 1891.
The only comparison which will be drawn from these, and with,
which the present analysis will be concluded, is that of the average
of the last three years with that of the corresponding years in each
of the preceding decades, embracing both the shipping and com-
merce of each period.

The great difference in the apparent rate of growth of tonnage
and value in the last two decades may be partly accounted for by
the heavy fall in the prices of merchandise during these years, and
by the rapid growth of the passenger traffic, stimulated by the
establishment of several competing lines of large and swift
steamers running between the United Kingdom and various
countries, especially North America.
