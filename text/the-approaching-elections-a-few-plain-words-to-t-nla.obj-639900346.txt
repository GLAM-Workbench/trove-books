THE APPROACHING ELECTIONS.
A Few Plain Words to the Women Electors of South Australia.
BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.
[From the S.A. Register , 24th March, 1896.]
Many of us did not expect the vote, not a
few of us did not desire it, but now we have
got it we are pressed on all sides to use it.
Most of us no doubt will vote on the same side
as our husbands, fathers, and brothers, but
there is a limit to this amiable course. If our
male relatives, for party purposes, ask us to
vote for men whose moral character or
political platform we disapprove of, we ought
not to do so. If we elect bad men to Parliament
we will have a bad Government. If we elect good
and able men we will have a good Govern-
ment. I say good and able, because a man
may be respectable and agreeable, and yet
may be so ignorant that lie does not know
what is best for the conn try, or he may be so
persuadable that crafty politicians may twist
him round their fingers for their own purposes.
I know that the choice will be limited to
four or five, and that in many districts there
may be no man offering who is a heaven-born
legislator. This is why I want to enlarge the
districts and give a wider choice to all electors.
But generally speaking there will be two men
whom you prefer to the others. There is at the
present time a very distinct difference between
the two main parties, and those who have
given thought to politics will have no difficulty
in making a choice. Those who think the
colony has gone too far on democratic lines
will vote for the Conservative candidates,
even though they may not agree with all the
platform of the National Defence League.
Those whose interests and sympathies lie with
labour will vote for Labour candidates when
they offer, and for Radical or Democratic
candidates favourable to labour when no
direct representative is in the field. The
temperance advocates —the W.C.T.U. and
their friends—will give support to candidates
who promise aid to their cause. But many
voters, especially among the women, have no
strong opinions or convictions, and they can be
persuaded to promise their votes to any one
who takes the trouble to canvass them. This is
Partly because they are pleased to be solicited,
ut chiefly because they do not feel the
importance of the duty of voting intelligently.
I am not surprised at the apathy and indif-
ference of so many of my sisters. They have
been kept out of politics, and considered it was
no business of theirs. Even when the suffrage
was given it seemed at first sight that
it would only increase the number
of votes at the poll, but would in
no way change or modify the results.
I should much like if the given
to women were of a different colour, so that we
might see how far this is true. If women took
to heart their responsibilities we ought to see
some change. In the first place character
should count for more than it has done in the
East. Women do not want to be represented
y drunkards, libertines, gamblers, or poli-
tical adventurers. And character should em-
brace more than this. Political consistency
and integrity are indispensable in a representa-
tive. And, as in old days, there were men
who devoured widows’ houses and for a pre-
tence made long prayers, so now there are
men who occupy Church pews and support
the Churches who are greedy and grasp-
ing and cruel in their business transactions.
These men are as little to be trusted as men of
open bad character, for their own interests
are always foremost with them, whereas we
women want laws to be for the good of all.
Do not vote for any man, however respectable
and clever, whose politics you disapprove of.
His cleverness will enable him to do more
mischief to the cause which ought to be yours
than if he were stupid. In the second place,
women who are the housekeepers ought to
support economy in the housekeeping of the
State. Our lives are a constant war with
dirt and with waste. We want a clean and a
wisely economical Government. We should
set our faces against reckless borrowing, which
causes heavier taxation. Every candidate, of
course, professes economy, but when any re-
trenchment is proposed by a Ministry
the opposite party says that this par-
ticular retrenchment is cruel, unjust,
and unwise. If the retrenchment
touches a relative or a personal friend, if it
affects our district or our class, it is opposed
from whatever quarter it may come. Now,
let us women put fair play and common sense
into the national housekeeping.
As to the act of voting, that is simple
enough. Mark with a cross the candidates
you prefer in the squares opposite their names.
Do nothing more. Do not sign your name .
If only one man seems to you worth voting for
mark only his name.
In order to vote intelligently you must learn
exactly what each candidate intends to do,
and you must enquire into his past political
history. If he has been false to his promises
do not trust him. After the election is over
you must watch the conduct of the represen-
tatives of your district in Parliament whether
you voted for them or not. We do not need
our members to be always making speeches,
but we want them to support right measures
in a right way, and to be able to give a reason
when needed for their actions. We have no
right to expect our local members to subscribe
to local objects. This is a growing evil
in South Australia. We have no right
to ask him to push our local interests
at the expense of other districts, or at the cost
of the whole province of South Australia. He
ought to be able to further our honest interests
and to call attention to any grievances we may
have. But he is our representative, not our
slave. He is not merely the representative of
a district, but a member of the South Aus-
tralian Parliament, charged with the interests
of the whole community.
The eyes of the world are upon us, and we
owe it to ourselves and to South Australia to
use the vote conscientiously.
