NOW, MY BELOVED COUNTRY. 1


NOW, MY BELOVED COUNTRY.'
To - Governor Phillip,
Founder of the Australian Nation
Now, my Beloved Country, now's the time
To clear from your mind the offending image
Of the 'robber hero' you have praised too long,
Your admiration giving countenance
To brash defiance of the Law and Order,
By which alone young nations may survive
For a full burgeoning of all their powers.
Youth has excuse, enlightened age has none
For praise of rash and reckless bravado,
That took no care but for its own acclaim
And turned to jest the ruin in its wake,
So, noW, perceptive grown, come, see this truth
And pay your tribute where 'tis rightly due -
To Phillip, noble author of your being,
Allotted in the Universal Plan
A place and task unique in history.
To him your praise, who, day by direful day,
From his own strength,strengthened nigh-broken men,
Driven by lack of tools to hew and dig -
And haul by hand, under a burning sum,
Mighty, age-old and deep-entrenched trees
For sheltering roof, and, for their sustenance,
To grow a shrivelled seed in alien soil;
Stranger to cultivation, hardened 'gainst yield.
Wild, night by night, kept solitary watch
O'er the supplies, lest black marauders range,
And, when crops failed and waited ships came not,
Gave bread from his own table, wine from his store,
That all should share alike in the 'Starving Time'::
That all should share alike in time of need,
That all should equal stand before the Law,
These were his laws, woven by his strong hand
Into the pattern of your destiny.
To him who steadfast stood and held his course -
Though all foretold a doom inevitable,
Unless they fled these lone, rejecting shores -
And made of Hope his Lode Star, Faith his Guide,
And steered his stricken craft into the years,
When rich flocks grazed and wheat grew flourishing
And the sound of children's laughter was oft heard
In this far, wild corner of creation,
Turning his dream of nationhood to fact:
Then, as your Flag unfurls and volleys fire
And toasts are drunk, remember him, Australia,
Remember him, to whose rare fortitude
And rarer vision, you owe your heritage,
Your present grandeur and your future might,
And proclaim him your National Hero to the world
In your full splendour of maturity.'
