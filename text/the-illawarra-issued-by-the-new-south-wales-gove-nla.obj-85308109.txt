I THE ILLA WARE A. |
The journey to Wollongong (44 miles) the nearest
, I railway station to Port Kembla, traverses a pic- | J
1 j turesque route comparable only to the world- Id
i|| famous line along the Mediterranean littoral jpj
|-j through France and Italy. The wonderful growth T
\,| of its sub-tropical vegetation has earned for the SI
district the sobriquet of the “ Garden of New South Ij
v.j Wales.” The' coastal belt is well defined. The B
ocean forms its eastern boundary, and the range ||
] of hills which form the mighty eastern walls of the |k;
% tablelands hem it in on the west. This stretch of
|| country for the most part contains areas of rich |,
n land eminently suitable for dairying, ' which forms |"
1 its staple industry. It is also rich in coal measures, T
y and from Helensburgh (27 miles) to Dapto (56 J|
j miles) at many points, notably at Clifton, Bulli, ®|
Woonona, Corrimal, and Wollongong, the tower- ■
ing poppet-heads or tunnel mouths whose swiftly-
Sj revolving winding gear betoken the busy life under |K‘
ground. Coke ovens belching forth fumes and gases
|| show what proportions the industry has attained.

Geologically the;, journey is most interesting. §
Before Clifton is reached the three formations S|
which are grouped under the “ Trias,” are crossed.
y Sydney lies nearly in the middle of these trias, j |
which are arranged somewhat in the shape of ' I
pj saucers. The uppermost consists of a layer of ||'
,3 shales, which are thickest near Wianamatta Creek,
T near Rooty Hill. Hence it is called, the Wiana- ihj
% matta shale. Below is the huge saucer more than jj
1,000 feet thick, consisting of various sandstones, ,
M known as the Hawkesbury Sandstones. Below j |
■i 1 these} occur the chocolate shales of the Narrabeen
||! series, which appear near Bulli. The lower tiers in C|
31 the-pile of saucers consist of various beds inter- '»
S” spersed with cogd seams, the whole constituting |Gj
the coal measures of the Great Basin, or as it is
| more scientifically termed, the geo-syncline. Prac- |S
I ttcally the whole way from Sydney to Otford (30 1
| miles), the train passes through Hawkesbury sand- ,j |
G stone.' At St. Peters (3 miles) the bluish tinge of
the Wianamatta shales are seen. At any part of |‘|j
|Jj the journey the line • passes over coal seams.. At tli
S Sydney the coal “ saucer ” would be tapped about
i'i 3,000- feet down. At Helensburgh it is only 800 |j]
fji feet below the surface, while at Coal Cliff, Clifton,
ij Bulli, and other places it outcrops at the side of t j
Gj the hill. Round about Helensburgh the traveller f
sees the outcrop of Narrabeen shales, which are ||

'■j redder than the Wianamatta shales seen at St. jhj
vl Peters. The country near Bull! has been sub- t||
H jected to great volcanic outbursts in past ages, ft:

On emerging from the tunnel at Otford the sand- y
tf stones are left behind, the traveller is struck with fv
the difference in vegetation. Instead of stunted |^|
ferns and heath with a poor sandy soil, there is yl
now a stretch of clayey soil much more fertile, as g|
evidenced by the luxuriant grass and prodigal :
lij growth of shrubs and ferns and cabbage-tree palms. , T
This difference is primarily due. to the fact that
If the outcrop of Narrabeen shales has been reached.
Of the native trees which grow so luxuriantly in I f
11 this district, the most striking is the Illawarra Flame k 1
Tree (Brachychiton acerifolius, A. Cunn., : Sterculia), jg
fe so called from the brilliant red color of its flowers. O
It is common to the Illawarra; but is distributed H
along the. extreme length of the coast. Its leaves ft;
E\ -are tri-lobed and of a glaucous colour —milky green.
For a short period, just at this season of the year,
it is deciduous, and this is the flowering period.
When in full bloom, the tree presents a magnificent
sight, the rich, warm colour strongly contrasting : f


I ~,...,.. «. ._—_ _—


with the dark foliage of the forest. The tree is I
|-;j| almost invariably found on the fringes of the scrubs. p
Another common coast tree is the Turpentine— ' K
Metrosideros glomulifera, (Syncarpia. laurifolia). |T
' 1 This tree is readily recognised by its dark, rough jT
iy bark, and tall growth, towering above all other j^l
trees. 11
The Cabbage-tree Palms (Livistona australis) — f |
of which there are many splendid specimens in the
V neighbourhood of Stanwell Park— re seen all along ml
if| the coast. This peculiar tree shoots up a long, 3
:k branchless stem, at the top of which is a cluster of bj]
IT large, broad leaves, resembling, a huge cabbage—
I j hence its name.
Another beautiful coastal palm is the Bangalow—
i 1 Archontophxnm Cunninghamiana (Seaforthia ele- 111;
K gans) which grows plentifully in the rich, moist
K lands. The leaves of this palm are broad and many «
pointed, of a dark green hue, with a glossy surface, l||
ill ' and unlike the cabbage-tree-palm, they spread out
A in large, graceful clusters, the underneath ones lit
trailing on the ground.
From Otford tunnel, just about a mile in length, j ]
|kj the line traverses the foot of the hills close by the A;
tj margent of the sea. !®

Through the tunnel the train rushes at great l|
speed on a down grade, and there suddenly bursts ||
|| upon the traveller a wonderful panorama of ocean, K
® mountain, forest, and plain. The Illawarra moun- .jy
R tains tower abruptly almost from the surf, a little : : g
K to the south, beautiful farming lands spread out p
|ij like a vast map, and the seaward vision is lost over p
V the Pacific’s blue rollers. Immediately at the foot, F|
and in a golden sweep to the southward, extend »
jjjl beaches which link together an endless chain of [i|]
,S| bold coastal promontories. Splashed upon the ,||
misty blue of the distance may be seen on a bright ■ |T
• day the Five Islands, off Wollongong. 5
The Illawmrra is one of the State’s most popular K
]'| tourist districts, and large numbers of city and : g
W country residents annually spend their holidays at H
the many delightful places by the ocean side. 1 1
The two great industries are coal-mining and ||
dairying. The first coal discovered in the State jp
1| was at Clifton by Bass and Flinders in 1796. These g
S(fi two early explorers found black lumps of slaty- pj
||j looking stone rounded to shingle by the waves.
As a general rule the coal in the South Coast d
districts is obtained by “ driving ”or tunnelling p
j [ into the hillside, and not by deep shafts as at New- jl
[C[ castle and Maitland. The coal is of good quality, Ij
and is especially suitable for boilers and furnaces. ||

® A large quantity of South. Coast Coal is used by jjl
1", the Railways and coastal steamers. In many cases
y the mine mouth is situated some distance up the '
i | hillside, and the loaded trucks run by gravitation
| to the ship’s side at the end of the ocean jetty.
k\ The annual output reaches 1,929,000 tons, valued
S at
A large percentage of the miners in this district
own their own tenements, many of which are
pi surrounded by tastefully laid-out and well-kept
A garden plots.
Though the coal-mining industry is the greatest
source of wealth from this district, dairying and
yl agricultural pursuits are largely followed. The
Ssj South Coast is the home of the dairying industry,
T| and for years before the industry was carried to
p| the North Coast district, which has since shown
j such phenomenal results, the rich farm lands of
1 1 the South Coast were the only source of the State’s
j: j butter, cheese, and ham production. The breeds in
p the South Coast have won splendid reputations,
id and on the Coolangatta Estate, below Wollongong,
late Sir John Hay established a fine herd of
71 Ayrshire cattle, the greatest prize-takers in Aus-
tralia Dairy factories are in active operation in
f v many centres in this district, from which comes
daily a large quantity of fresh milk for the needs


I| of the metropolis. These, factories are owned by K
® the farmers on a co-operative basis, and the result
|| of the system is not merely economy, by the pro- i
I duction of butter of uniform quality and general
fi excellence. The annual output of butter from the S]
|j| South Coast is nearly 10,000,000 lb.
IT Wollongong, population 4,125, is one of the jll
g| most important South Coast Towns. It lies in a j||
S gently sloping ridge, which runs out to a bluff and
S| forms the southern side of its harbour. The Port fi
M has been greatly improved and enlarged by the-
construction of a breakwater, at the end of which p
111 is a lighthouse. The bold eminence of Mount Keira, p
Sj 1,500 feet high, and clothed with dense foliage from
j|| base to summit stands sentinel over the town, [w|
p About 600 feet up the mountain is the entrance to W|
p a coal mine, and on various vantage points may be !■
S seen the eyries of the mining population. All U
round the- foothills are hundreds of well-kept |k
W farms, through which the winding railway may be. .
W traced for some miles. On Mullet Creek, close at |, I
hand, are the works of the Smelting Company of Aus- p
tralia, the largest of its kind in the continent. S
Large quantities of ore are treated here for all the W
States. Recently the large Electrolytic Copper ■}
1 Smelting Works have been established, which will a
P materially enhance Wollongong’s industrial and U
commercial importance.
