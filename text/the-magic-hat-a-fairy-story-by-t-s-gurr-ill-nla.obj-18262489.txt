LD Franz kept the little music shop close to
the bridge. He made and sold fiddles and
flutes and pipes, and other sweet sounding
instruments, but it was his pipes that made him
famous. He often worked in the shop window, spec-
tacles balanced on his nose, and his bald head, fringed
with white hair, covered by an old felt hat. Many little
boys, and girls, too, for the matter of that, dabbed their
little noses against the window pane to have a good
look at his cheery kindly face and his deft fingers.


ClBs'! ‘
Sometimes, the old man would try one of his
pipes, and then everyone in the ancient street
clustered round the shop to listen. If the tune
was a merry jig, the lads and lasses would
trip to it right merrily, and the finches in the
linden trees whistle and chirp blithely as
though spring had just come over the hill.

Little Hans, son of the widow who sewed
from morn till night and always went to bed
tired, and sometimes hungry, was a great
favourite of old Franz. He knew how to
j
hold his tongue and not fidget when
Franz was absorbed in his work.
& '■>
As he grew older, Hans was
given odd jobs to do and
promised to become
quite clever at
fashioning pipes.
The lads and lasses would
dance in the streets.


£/tt/e Hans was a great favourite of old Franz .
He also learned to play one, but he did not practise
as he should have done, which was a great grief to
the Master, as old Franz was called.
One sad day—Hans was then about thirteen—dear
old Franz died. They found him in his chair, a violin in
his lap and a smile on his face, as if he were listening
to a choir of angels. The townsfolk felt sure he would
leave a great deal of money to Hans. So, when a
parcel wrapped in an old cloth and addressed to*his
young friend was delivered, everyone was anxious to
know what it contained. Hans’ mother excitedly ripped
the parcel open, and drew out of it the old felt hat
that the gentle Franz used to wear.


-y*
“The old dodderer!” she screamed, beside herself
with rage. “Is this his idea of a joke?” She picked up
the old hat and threw it out of the kitchen window
into the backyard.
Hans, who had curly, golden hair and eyes as
blue as forget-me-nots, had wept all day, and his
Mother’s outburst made him sob louder than ever.
When darkness fell, he found the old hat and thrust
it in the bottom of his clothes chest. For many days
Hans grieved for his old friend, until his Mother bade
him make an end of it and look round for some-
thing to do.
Hans was not the only one
who grieved. Many poor
people, especially children, lost
a great friend, too. Old Franz
left no money. He
never had much
at any time
because he gave
away nearly all
he earned.
Hans grew tall
He did not practise as
he should have done.


A big parcel arrived for Hans. 1
and strong and made a living as a wood cutter.
He loved working in the forest, and driving his
cartload of wood to town every evening. Sometimes
on a sunny day, he would sit down on the bank
of a stream and play the pipe old Franz had
given him. He played simple tunes, and those not
very well. \ou see, he had not practised as he should
have done.
One day as he played, the wind blew up suddenly
and swept his hat into the stream where it was lost.
Next morning, he remembered Franz’s hat, and
rummaged in his clothes chest till he found it. From


the moment he put it on a great change came over
him. Beautiful melodies flooded his brain, and the
old Master’s face beamed at him from everywhere.
Hans recalled many delightful memories of him as
he worked that day.
At noon while he rested for lunch, he brought
out his pipe and began to play, and the forest echoed
with the sweetest music that had ever stirred it. Birds
swarmed around him and added their songs to the
flood of melody.
It so happened that just at that time an elderly,
but very dignified man dressed in black velvet and
wearing a large purple hat with a white plume, rode
by on a magnificent grey horse. He was Pestro
Maestro, a courtier, and the King’s chief musician.
Charmed by the music, the elderly gentleman leaped
off his horse and peeped through the bushes. Perhaps
in the dim past, Pan played as sweetly in the sylvan
glades of Greece. As Pestro listened to the plaintive
notes, his life passed through his // //

their kindly acts. He also remembered one, as all of
us do, lost either through death or separation, with
whom he could have lived exquisitely.
Suddenly the music changed, and there came
tripping through the air, notes that rose and fell in a
veritable cascade of delightful sound. In a moment,
the years fell away from the old courtier and he had
the heart of a child. His was the happiness of a bud
bursting into a rose, of a fledgling on its first confident
flight, of a young mother first kissing her new-born
babe, of a child lying on its back among sweet smelling
grass, watching white clouds leisurely sweeping across
a blue sky. Then he saw Hans and eagerly came forward.
“I have never heard anyone play the pipe more

clothes chest.

sweetly,” the old courtier said. “You must come
<ZJ
to the Capital and join my orchestra. I am
Pestro, the King’s musician.”
Now Hans had heard Franz speak of Pestro
and how beloved he was by the King. So with-
out further ado, he unharnessed his horse from
the cart, and mounting it, followed Pestro to
the Capital.
Here he was given a room in a lodging house
in the city, while his benefactor made arrange-
ments to present him to the King. Pestro could
not speak too highly of Hans’ talent.
There is a great treat awaiting your
Majesty,” he said. “This lad’s music not only
enchants the ear but charms away all cares.”

Little birds added their songs to the melody.


"Well,” said the King, "if his music cures my
indigestion, I shall place around his neck a chain of
gold that will weigh down his shoulders.”
Great preparations were made for Hans’ first
appearance before the King. It was to be a great
night, and Pestro saw to it that Hans was clad in
a costume of pale blue with rich silken hose, and
shoes with bejewelled buckles. His hair was curled
and brushed till it shone like spun gold. Hans, swelling
with pride and exultation, bundled his old clothes
and hat together and flung them under his bed.
Pestro himself introduced him to the noble
assembly and both the
King and Queen,
pleased with Hans’
attractive appearance,
smiled kindly at the
rather nervous
stripling. Pestro’s
orchestra opened the
concert and then the
great moment came

for Hans to play the
medley of tunes that had
enchanted old Pestro in
the forest.
A great silence fell as
Hans rose. At first he seemed very nervous and
Pestro looked troubled, while the King raised his
eyebrows and started- to drum with his fingers on
the arm of his great chair. Soon afterwards Hans
gained courage and played, not only with confidence,
but with great conceit. But the music was not that
of an artist, but a very uncertain amateur. The King’s
face was now terrible to see. He looked as if someone
had just given him a dose of castor oil. His expression
changed from kindliness to surprise, and from
surprise to the great anger of a man who has been
fooled and held up to ridicule. His patience quickly
became exhausted.
“Silence,” he shouted. Then in a voice all could
hear he said, “Arrest that would-be jester and his
dupe Pestro. Cast them into prison.”
With the announcement of that sentence the
royal concert broke up In confusion.


■' 7 *
“You must come and play for the King”
At first the King ordered both Pestro and Hans
to be immediately executed, but later he relented-and
commanded that Pestro should be given twelve
months in which to teach Hans to play as well as he
had asserted he could. If he failed, both were to die.
From dawn to dark Pestro did his utmost to
teach his pupil, but Hans, despondent and listless in
his cell, was in no mood to learn. Instead, his mind
drifted to the forest where he cut wood and was
really very happy indeed.

The year passed swiftly, as it does when a prisoner-
counts each day that remains for him to live.
J
The King, in a merciful frame of mind, remem-
bering Hans was but a peasant, sent for him and
asked him if he could now live up to the reputation
Pestro had given him. Hans raised his downcast and
tear-filled eyes to the King.
“1 would not have courage, Sire, to play again
before you. lam no musician and did not ask to
come here. There is nothing in this world I want
more than to return to my birthplace and be a wood-
cutter.”
With these words
he knelt before the
King and lifted his
shackled hands
imploringly. The
King spoke to one of
his Counsellors
“Release this youth at
once, and send him to his
birthplace.”
% '
At first he seemed very
nervous.


They were arrested.
As Hans was hurried away the Counsellor asked
“And what of Pestro?”
The King’s eyes smouldered with anger.
“Let him die at the appointed time,” he said.
So the prison guards released Hans from his cell
and led him to the prison’s outer gate, and there a


warder called him fool and kicked him. Hans had
sought permission to bid Pestro farewell, but was
refused.
Hans returned to the lodging house, and the
keeper of it, a pleasant, buxom woman, welcomed him
back and showed him into his old room. Everyone
in the Capital knew about Hans and Pestro, and
thought the King had treated both very harshly.
“You are lucky to escape with your life,” she said.
Pestro did his utmost to teach him


Poor old Pestro is not so fortunate. He will die to-
morrow at midday on the last chime of the clock.”
At this news Hans burst into tears and would
not be comforted.
Take my advice, the kindly lodging house
keeper said. Put on your peasant attire you wore
when you came here and leave the city as soon as
night falls. Kings often change their minds. I looked
»
after the bundle you left under the bed, wondering
if you would call for it some day.”
Hans did as he was advised, and with his pipe
in his pocket and Franz’s
old hat on his head, he
said farewell to the kindly
woman and left the city
after sundown. To be
free, to go where it
pleased him, filled his
heart with delight, but
“1 am no musician and did not
ask to come here, ” said Hans.

to sleep under a great oak tree that overlooked the
city, instead of in a dark rat-haunted cell, was the very
height of bliss. He fell asleep when the stars peeped
out of the sky, and it was broad daylight when
he woke.
He ate a light meal carried in his grip, and in
sheer gladness of heart pulled out his pipe and placed
it to his lips. To his great delight, the miracle again
happened. He played with the exquisite perfection
which had attracted old Pestro. Something else
also dawned on him for the first time. The virtue lay
in the old hat left
him by Franz.
With that dis-

another thought. If he could gain an audience with
the King, he might prevail upon him to pardon Pestro.
From the country round, the peasants swarmed
all roads leading to the Capital, jogging along in carts
or on horseback, but mostly on foot. It was market
day, but also one that promised extra excitement; for
the news had spread far and wide that at midday the


axe would fall on the neck of Pestro, and the great
square would be packed with people to see him die.
The hearts of most were heavy, for Pestro had given
them music that lightened their burdens and filled
their drab lives with romance. It was Hans who had
failed him; they thought he should have died and not
old Pestro who had never harmed anyone.
Hans swung along .the country road exerting

axe fell. It was too beautiful a day for anyone to
have to die. The music of his pipe had filled him
with ecstacy. He remembered all Pestro’s kindly
efforts to teach him while they were both in prison,
and how poorly he had responded. Now he was
fortunate to possess the secret to give Pestro his
release if he could only see the King in time.
It was half past eleven when Hans reached the
city gates, one of a great concourse of people stream-
ing towards the great square, their eyes fixed on the

tcill scaffold, built so that all could get a clear view.
The King, from the balcony of his palace, watched
his subjects streaming into his Capital, and every
time he thought of old Pestro his eyes became misty
and his heart extremely sad. He was very reluctant
to pardon Pestro at this late hour. He never liked
reversing any of his decrees, but he hoped that some-
thing he did not care what would happen and
give him an excuse to stay the execution. Just at
that moment, Hans, who saw it was hopeless to reach
the palace in time, acted on a sudden impulse and
began to play his pipe.


Hans exerted himself to the (J\ %
utmost to reach the Capital. 1
Hans exerted himself to the
utmost to reach the Capital.
Hans was still some distance away, but above the
murmur of the mob the King heard the blithe, trilling
and intoxicating notes of the pipe, clearing the air of
the pervading gloom and making each breath he took
like a draught of champagne.
The King straightened himself up. He saw some-
one marching a few yards ahead of a crowd of people,
leading them to the palace gates. As that stream of
people came nearer, he saw that they did not march
soberly as men should march on a day of sorrow, hut

leaped and danced like merry people at high
carnival. The joyous music surged to his ears and
he called one of his Counsellors.
"My eyes may deceive me, but is not that mad
and merry piper, leading that host of people, the one
lately released from prison?”
I cannot say, Sire,’ came the reply, “but I shall
make enquiries.”
In the meantime, send a swift courier and stop
the execution,” commanded the King, with a glance
at the clock tower.
Old Pestro mounted the scaffold and looked
down on that great sea of faces, most of them
streaming with tears. His eyes also wandered
to the clock tower and he saw that he had but
five minutes to live. Then he and those watch-
ing him saw a horseman dash madly up the
street preceded by another who shouted,

"Make way for the King’s messenger!”, in
between the sharp and strident blare of his
trumpet. Nearer and nearer the minute hand
crept to twelve, then a great voice shouted, "Stay
the execution by the King’s command!”
At that moment Hans was led before the

“It seems, rascal,” said the King, that you

can play when you like. I confess I have never
heard more enchanting music. Pestro was right.
He had never failed me before and I should have
trusted him in your case. It was your obstinacy
that made me cast him into prison and sentence
him to death. Now he is reprieved, you will take
his place on the scaffold.”
"Spare me, Sire,” Hans pleaded, his face
deathly pale.
“Take him away!” the King shouted in his

wrath. I shall teach him to make sport of a King.”
Hans knelt at the King’s feet and begged for
mercy
Listen, Sire, and let me tell you the whole story.
It is a strange one, but it is true. After you have
heard it you will spare me as you have spared my
benefactor, Pestro.”
The King, with patience, heard Hans to
end. Then his stern face broke into a smile.

"You are forgiven, Hans

my people glad. When you wear that old hat, out of
your pipe comes not merely sweet sound, but the
love of all that is worthwhile and good.”
The King watched Hans leave the palace
grounds. Outside the gates he began to play once
more. One moment the pipe carolled like a lark in
the sky, then the voices of cherubin seemed to come
down to earth and sadness and gloom were swept
away as mists disperse before a gentle breeze. The
King’s eyes gleamed and his pulse quickened. Every-
one about him had this same urge to be a child at
heart and dance and be merry.

y As soon as Pestro was
released, cheering crowds followed him to his
home. A day of sadness had been changed by
the King’s clemency to one of rejoicing. Hans’
face was set towards the country. There he felt he
would know most happiness. As he led a great
following of people to the sound of his pipe towards
the mam gate of the city, he and Pestro met face
to face.
There was no need to explain anything to the


fj
Maestro. He had heard the story of the Magic Hat
already. As Hans knelt before him Pestro said, “I
greet you, King’s Musician,” and helped him to
his feet.
It was a proud name to bear, the King s
Musician. Hans was soon beloved by all the
King’s subjects. He wandered from village to
to village over the
beautiful countryside. Here
he played at a wedding,
there at a christening.
But there was never an
evening that he did not

THE END
“Stop the execution!”
commanded the King.
