CORRESPONDENCE, &c., &c.,
IN THE MATTER OP
?COLE?S WHARF.?




The following correspondence is published with a
view of placing in a collected iorm the whole oi the
letters between myself and the various members of
the past and present Governments ot this colony
relative to the Wharfage Abolition Act and my
claim to be exempt from the charge of dues under
the present Wharfage Act.
The correspondence dates as far back as 25th
September, 1852; on that date I received an intima-
tion from the Colonial Secretary that I had no longer
the right to make any charge for goods landed on
my wharf, although for ten years pnoi I had used
the property as a landing; place for goods, and
collected dues from all parties choosing to use it as
The correspondence has been continued from time
to time up to 27th January, 1865, to try, on my part,
to effect a remedy of the injustice; and I had hoped
that when the necessity arose for the re-imposition of
wharfage dues, I would have been placed in a similai
position to that I occupied prior to the passing of
the Abolition Act in 1852. ,
On the 13th April, 1864, I petitioned the Legis-
lative Assembly?a copy of which will be found in
page 20; in support of the same I made the
following statement before a Committee of the
House, 4th May following:?
� On the 31st August, 1832, an Act was passed in Sydney, under
which wharfage rates were levied on all goods landed at the King?s
Wharf, Sydney, as per Schedule F, the owners of private sufferance
wharves receiving wharfage on such goods as were landed at their pre-
mises.


This Act was subsequently extended to all the public wharves
throughout the Colony of New South Wales, within the area of
which Melbourne was then included.
I was at that time residing at Melbourne, and noticing the en-
couragement given for the formation of private sufferance wharves
throughout New South Wales, I determined to follow the example
of the residents in Sydney, and to construct a wharf in Melbourne
upon the same principle as had already been done in the older
city.
On the 14th August, 1841, I purchased from the Crown a
water-side frontage to the Yarra Yarra, being 132 feet by 332 feet,
at the rate of �lOOO per acre, since known as Cole?s Wharf,
with a view of obtaining a sufferance similar to that granted to
the Sydney wharves, trusting for remuneration to the continuance
of the Act then in force, by which I should be entitled to
receive all the wharfage for goods landed on my ground.
The land, at the time of the purchase, was a tea-tree swamp, at
high tides covered with water.
I applied for and obtained a sufferance 18th February, 1842.
I was further encouraged to make a dock, 120 feet long, 42 feet
wide; and also formed a wharf, covering 4464 superficial feet,
with a good platform, on which goods could be landed in safety;
and I also built a wall nine feet high all round, as required by
the Government.
These works were considered a great boon by the mercantile
community, who gladly availed themselves of the accommodation
thus offered.
In 1843, the 7th Victoria No, 12 was passed by the Legislature
of New South Wales, taking from the private sufferance wharves
� (one third) of the rates previously charged by the proprietors ;
the Government before this time had made no charge upon goods
landed at the private wharves.
I was thus deprived of one-third of an income derived from
rates paid me for affording that accommodation to the public of
this Colony which was still unprovided for by the Government of
New South Wales, Port Phillip being then part of New South
Wales.
This reduction of my income so soon after so great an expendi-
ture I felt severely in the disasterous times of 1843.
In 1844, the Bth Victoria No. 16 was passed, and rates were
levied on all goods shipped from the Colony, a portion of which I
received.
In 1852, Wharfage Rates were abolished by Act of Parliament
passed by the Government of Victoria, thereby rendering all my
past labor and expenditure useless. *and depriving of its value a
wharf which had been constructed on the faith of continuance of the


law in force when the Government of New South Wales sold the
land to me, and which law in part exists still in New South
Wales.
It is thought by many that I have already received compensa-
tion for my losses, such however is not the case, as I have never
received one penny in consideration of Cole?s Wharf having been
rendered almost valueless by the passing of the Act abolishing
Wharfage Rates.
In November, 1851, the lease of the right to collect wharfage
rates for twelve months at the Queen?s Wharf was bought by me
under heavy bonds at public auction, but before the termination
of my lease wharfage rates were abolished, and for the unexpired
portion of the lease I was paid by the Government, hence the mis-
conception that I was paid for my losses on Cole?s Wharf.
With this statement I leave my case in your hands, feeling
assured that, wharfage rates being again imposed by Act of Par-
liament, I am entitled to a considerable portion of them, as far as
my wharf is concerned.
(Signed) ? GEORGE WARD COLE.?
And in reply to certain questions put to me by
the Committee, I gave the following replies: ?
What was the gross income of the said wharf during 1853
and 1854 ? ?My income during these years was derived from three
sources, viz.: 1. My wharf proper, consisting of the piling frontage
to the Yarra, dock, and platform accommodation. 2. My stores
and sheds, erected on part of the allotment, 3. My lighters and
steamers. My income for my wharf proper during 1853 and 1854
was nil, as I could not make any charge for the use of this accom-
modation since the abolition of the wharfage rate in 1852.
Under what conditions were the general public allowed to use
your wharf during the years 1853 and 1854, as contra-distinguished
from the goods lightered by yourself I?l1 ?I did not admit the general
public the use of my wharf after the abolition of the wharfage dues;
the letter from the Colonial Secretary distinctly states it would be
illegal for me to make any charge for goods landed upon my wharf.
1 was, and am, in the position of a man, being in the possession of
a tenement, prevented by Act of Parliament from receiving a rental
for the use of it.
What income did you receive during 1853 and 1854 for the
use of your wharf, irrespective of lighterage I ?l did not receive any
income from my wharf proper, the dues having been abolished in
1852.
It will be apparent that, under the Wharfage Act
now in force, I am chargeable at the rate of 3s. per


ton on any goods I may desire to land on my own
property. Even if the goods belong to myself,
which I respectfully urge is an injustice that could
not have been contemplated by the Legislature at
the time of the passing of the Act.
My position, as the proprietor of a private wharf,
is very different to that of the Hobson?s Bay Rail-
way Company claiming the same exemption; for
whilst the latter was projected and constructed
between the time of the abolition and re-imposition
of the Wharfage Acts, and their land a free grant
from the country, I purchased my property from the
Crown, at the rate of �IOOO per acre, for the avowed
purpose of making a landing place of it, at a time
when an Act was in force exempting such Rom dues.
I have thought it necessary to attach to the cor-
respondence a copy of Counsel?s speech on my
behalf before the Committee alluded to, as it con-
tains a very clear and impartial statement of the
whole case, and will not accompany the minutes of
evidence and report of the Select Committee on
? the claims of private wharves? that will be
brought up for the consideration of the Legislative
Assembly on the 3rd March next.

That at the time such permission was granted certain rate* w P m
payable upon all goods landed on the Queen?s Wharf which rates
have been continued fiom time to time\ virtu7S\ertl I c ?


some of which are now in force, and which Acts entitled the
occupier of sufferance wharves to make similar charges on goods
landed thereat as then made upon goods landed at the Queen?s
Wharf.
That, calculating upon the continuance of the privilege conferred
by such Acts upon the proprietors of sufferance wharves, your peti-
tioner incurred a very considerable expense in satisfying the require-
ments of the Government, as expressed in a letter addressed to him
by the Honorable Secretary for the Colony of New South Wales, a
copy of which is appended hereto.
That a large expense was incurred by your petitioner in satisfying
these requirements, by converting the ground on which his wharf was
built from a mere swamp into a substantial embankment, opening a
dock of considerable depth and extent, and constructing about four
thousand feet of wharf frontage of the most solid description, on
which goods could be landed dry, and remain protected by enclosed
walls of nine feet in height and substantially built upon a solid
foundation, formed at a vast expense-in swampy ground, on which it
was exceedingly difficult to raise any solid structure.
That your petitioner erected stores and sheds for the reception of
goods when landed from the lighters discharging at the dock con
structed by your petitioner, and also a shed and offices at the head of
the. wharf for the use of the officers of Her Majesty?s Customs.
That a very great public benefit has resulted from your petitioner?s
outlay, which amounting to several thousand pounds was incurred in
the belief that the privileges of a sufferance wharf would always be
retained by your petitioner ; the wharf of your petitioner having
been constructed when the Queen?s Wharf consisted of nothing more
than the natural banks of the river Yarra, and was then and is at
certain seasons in a most muddy condition and exceedingly ill-suited
for the landing of goods.
That your petitioner has perceived that a Bill is now before your
Honorable House, having for its object the consolidation and amend-
ment of the laws relating to ports, harbours, and shipping in the
Colony of Victoria, and among other things, the Repeal of the Acts
of Council, Bth Victoria No. 6, 10th Victoria No. 11, and 14th
Victoria No. 15, which gives Her Majesty?s Officers of Customs the
right to levy wharfage rates upon goods landed at the Queen?s Wharf,
and by the repeal of these Acts your petitioner will be disabled from
charging the wharfage rates upon goods which, as the owner of a
sufferance Avharf, he has been hitherto entitled to do by virtue of the
Acts in question, and his obtaining a right to which was the con-
sideration of his constructing the very important and expensive works
to which he has referred.
That, even were your petitioner allowed to charge wharfage rates
as heretofore, should the Bill now before your honorable House pass
into law, that in the absence of any charge by the Commissioner of


Customs for wharfage dues being made upon goods landed on the
Queen's Wharf, your petitioner will be subjected to competition by
the Government, against which it will be vain for him to contend;
thus varying most prejudicially to your petitioner the terms upon
which your petitioner underook the works he has constructed, and
which have hitherto been of great public benefit.
That your petitioner is a lessee from the Crown of all the wharfage
rates granted by the Acts of Council hereinbefore-mentioned, or some
of them, for a term which will not expire until the thirty-first day of
December next.
That your petitioner, while admitting that the repeal of the Acts
in question ought to take place if the public good require it, humbly
submits that he is entitled to a compensation for the loss he may
sustain by being deprived of the advantages which formed the con-
sideration of his constructing the Sufferance Wharf of which he is now
the proprietor.
Your petitioner, therefore, humbly prays that your honorable
House will, in the event of the Bill now before your honorable House
being read a second time, refer the petition to a select committee to
inquire into and state what compensation your petitioner ought to
receive, should the Bill pass into a law ; and that your petitioner
may attend before such committee, and be heard by counsel in
support of the matters of his petition.
And your petitioner will ever pray.

Sir?l am directed by His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor
to refer you to an Act recently passed by the Legislative Council of
this colony, and assented to by His Excellency, for the purpose of
amending the law relating to Ports, Harbors, <tc., which, among
other provisions, abolishes the rates payable for wharfage ; and as
this Act comes into operation from the Ist of October next, it will
of course be illegal for you to levy any wharfage dues subsequent to
the 30th of this month, either as the proprietor of a Sufferance
Wharf, or as the lessee of the public one. I have, &c,

Melbourne, 29tli September. 1852.
Sm?l have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of the 25th inst., informing me you were directed by His Excellency
the Lieutenant-Governor to refer me to an Act recently passed by
the Legislative Council and assented to by His Excellency, relating
to Ports, Harbors, Ac., which, amongst the provisions, abolishes the
rates payable for wharfage, and that as this Act would come into ope-
ration from the Ist of October next, it would of course be illegal for
me to levy any wharfage dues subsequent to the 30th of this month,
either as the proprietor of a Sufferance Wharf or the lessee of a
public one.
With the greatest respect for the opinion of His Excellency, I beg
leave to suggest that having purchased, by auction, the wharfage
to be levied at the Queen?s Wharf, until the 31st December next,
under lease from Her Majesty?s Government, I cannot understand
upon what principle I am to be deprived of that which I purchased
with a knowledge that if my bargain had been a losing one I should
have to pay the rent monthly, for the due payment of which, a war-
rant of attorney was executed, as well as security for the due per-
formance of my part of the contract.
I acknowledge from the change of times my bargain has hitherto
proved a beneficial one, and I suppose if it is to be cancelled with-
out my free will, that at all events I am to be remunerated for the
loss I shall sustain by its being determined, and that I shall receive
as much from the Honorable the Legislative Council, or the Govern-
ment, as I could obtain from a fellow-subject, against whom, if I
pressed my claim as lessee of the wharf, the laws of my country
would give me all dues that might be my right to the 31st December,
or an equivalent in money.
With regard to your statement that it will be illegal after the Ist
October to take wharfage dues at my wharf, I of course presume
you contemplated, by the term dues, such only as are enforced under
an Act of Council.
I purchased from the Crown the land on which my -wharf has
been constructed by me at an enormous outlay, and claim to be
entitled to make any charge I may think proper to any persons
availing themselves of its advantages, leaving it of course to the
parties themselves to decide whether they will or will not accept
the accommodation I offer on the terms at which I may be willing
to afford it.
Having now expressed my views regarding my right to the wharf
as private property, I beg you will be pleased to state, for His
Excellency?s information, that having the intention of selling my
wharf premises, I think it right to offer them to Her Majesty?s


Government in tlie first place, feeling quite assured that if it were
sold to one or more parties, the value would in all probability be
enhanced, and the purchase rendered more difficult in the event of
the wharf being required for the public service.

Sir?l have, since the receipt of the letter you did me the honor

the subject of the sale by me to the Government of the property
known as ? Cole?s Wharf,? for the purpose of enabling me to act up
to the intimation given to me ?that a distinct offer from me would
be taken into consideration by the Executive.
I have now to state that I am willing to sell the property in ques-
tion, covering an acre and fourteen perches, for the sum of sixty
thousand pounds (�60,000), and in making this offer I beg to state
that the expenditure upon the px-operty has been very large, that the
convenience it offers for landing and embarking goods is very consi-
derable, and yields to me a very large income, and that by further
outlay greatly increased facilities could be given for the landing and
storing goods, which would carry with them proportionate profits.

Melbourne, 21st January, 1853.
Sir ?Having already had the honor of acknowledging the receipt
of your letter of the sth October last, 52 | 4171, I now beg leave to
refer to the 2nd paragraph respecting ray lease of the Wharfage
Rates to the 31st December last, and intimating as follows -That
His Excellency had every disposition to act just and rightly by you,
but as you have brought your claim before the Legislctive Council,
His Excellency awaits the decision of that body as to the course
which it would recommend in the matter.
In reply, I would respectfully submit that there must be some
misapprehension as to the prayer of my petition to the Council, as I
intended that prayer for compensation to be for injury sustained to
my private wharf by the abolition of wharfage, not for a moment
supposing that my lease would be interfered with, and my alluding
to the remainder of the time of the lease of wharfage rates, was to
show that I held it until 31st December.
Considering, as I still do, it was a claim I was justly entitled to
under the agreement, I therefore bog leave you will submit to His
Excellency my claim for the rates that Avould have been collected
had they not been abolished, and in order to arrive at a proper and
just conclusion I have had a calculation made from the actual en-
tries at the Custom House, for the three months due of the lease, by
the Custom House agents, as follows :
In the month of October ... <�lo4l 10 2

eight pounds one shilling and five pence, which sum I trust His Ex-
cellency will cause to be paid me, as, in order to keep the claim dis-
tinct I have, according to the lease, paid into Her Majesty?s Treasury
every month the rent due, �B9 3s. 4d. With reference to my peti-
tion to the Council for compensation for my private wharf, I beg you
will acquaint His Excellency that I have abandoned such claim, and
have the honor to be, &c., &c.,

Melbourne, sth July, 1853.
Sir ?I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favor
of yesterday?s date, informing me his Excellency the Lieutenant-
Governor had no doubt of the reasonableness of the claim made by
me for compensation for the loss sustained by me by the abolition


of the wharfage dues, which were under lease to me, and that he
suggested that its amount should be determined by persons deputed
for that purpose, who should furnish a report for his Excellency?s
guidance in placing a sum upon the estimates for submission to the
Legislative Council, with which body it would then rest to deter-
mine whether such should be admitted wholly or in part.
I can have no objection whatever to concur in any arrangement
that may be considered desirable for ascertaining the extent of com-
pensation to which I am in fairness entitled, but would suggest that
the amount should be ascertained by the Collector of Customs as
acting on the behalf of the Government and myself.
I shall be quite satisfied with any result that he may arrive at.
I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient servant,

Sir ?By desire of the Lieutenant-Governor, I do myself the
honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the sth instant,
wherein you state, in answer to mine of the 4th idem, in which I
informed you relative to your claim upon the Government, for loss
of wharfage due, &c., that His Excellency had suggested that the
amount of compensation to ?be awarded should be determined by
persons deputed for that purpose, who should furnish a report for
His Excellency?s guidance in placing a sum upon the estimates for

Sir ?Referring to your communication dated 14th July last,
transmitting sundry documents relative to a claim for compensation
by Captain Cole, for loss of wharfage dues, accompanied by an


authority from his Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor empowering
me to act on behalf of the Government and Captain Cole in the
adjustment thereof, I have the honor to report, for the information
of His Excellency, that upon a strict examination of Captain Cole?s
claim for compensation for loss of wharfage rates from Ist October
to 31st December, 1852, I find that the total wharfage for all goods
landed at the port for that period would have amounted to �4625
13s. 6d., and that from the best evidence I can procure the amount
of wharfage dues at the private Sufferance Wharves, and which the
proprietors had the power to collect may be fairly estimated at one
fourth of the whole, viz. :?�1156 Bs. 4|d., which, deducted from
the former amount, leaves the sum of �3469 ss. l|d., and which I
consider justly due to Captain Cole. I have, &c., &c.,

Sir ?In answer to your letter of this date, I have the honor to
inform you that the Auditor-General has received the Lieutenant-
Governor?s authority to prepare a warrant in your favor for the
amount of compensation awarded you by the Legislative Council in
consideration of the loss you suffered by the abolition of the
wharfage rates, viz., the sum of three thousand four hundred and
sixty-nine pounds five shillings and one penny (�3469 ss. Id.).
I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient servant,
(By order) LEWIS GILLIES, Accountant.
Cole?s Wharf, Melbourne, Ist October, 1858.
Sir?l have the honor to bring under your notice the circum-
stances under which I am the proprietor of the property known as
?Cole?s Wharf,? on the river Yarra Yarra, and the manner in which
the interests of the Government may be effected by the way in which
I may now dispose of it.
The land in question was conveyed to me by a Crown Grant in
the year 1842, in which power is reserved to the Government to
resume it at any time when required for the public service. The
compensation to be granted to me for the value thereof to be
assessed by two valuators, mutually chosen, and an umpire of then-
selection.
Up to this time the property has been in my own occupation, but
being now about to retire from business, I have it in contemplation
to let or dispose of it, and have overtures made to me, and am in
treaty with parties who desire to take the Wharf premises on a long
lease. Their object is to erect on the property buildings of a very


expensive character for manufactories or a foundry, for which the
river frontage affords peculiar facilities, and which, in the event of
the Government resuming the lands, would be an important item in
the valuation, while for the purpose for which I presume it would
be required by the Government, viz., the command of the entire
bank of the river for a general wharf, they would form an obstruc-
tion rather than an advantage.
Previous to entering into any arrangement, therefore, for the
leasing of the property in a way which would so largely and, to
the Government, so needlessly increase its value, I deem it right
to bring the matter before you, and to solicit your early considera-
tion of the question.
If it should be in the contemplation of the Government to exercise
their right of reclamation, I would venture to submit that a great
saving would be effected by their doing so before any further ex-
penditure is made upon the property, and I may add that in order
to facilitate such an arrangement, I am willing to take payment of
such sum as the valuators may award in the debentures of the
Government, at their market value.
I would further submit that, as in the Crown Grant, by which
I hold the property, it is described as ? bounded on the north by
? Flinders-street, which at this point is three chains and ninety-two
? links wide,? about 275 feet, and as at present the street in question
is only made to a width of 99 ft. 1 in., the remainder being unoc-
cupied ground, it would be competent to myself or my assigns to
claim the stipulated frontage to Flinders-street, and to object to the
erection of buildings on the intervening space, while on the other
hand the space in question would probably realise, as a site for
warehouses, &c., a larger amount than would have to be paid for
the river frontages.
I shall be happy to afford any further information on the subject
that may be required, either personally or by letter.
I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient servant,
GEORGE WARD COLE.
To the Honorable C. Gavan Duffy,
President of the Board of Land and Works, Melbourne.
Cole?s Wharf, Melbourne, 10th Jannary, 1859.
Sir ?ln reference to my letter of the Ist of October, 1858, to
the Hon. C. Gavan Duffy, your predecessor, suggesting to the
Government the resumption of these premises, in the terms of my
grant.
I take the liberty of handing you herewith a lithograph plan of
the storing allotments now laid out for lease by the Government;
and I have added to this plan, in order to point out to you the


portion of Flinders-street which was laid out for storing allotments,
extending from Spencer-street to the eastern line of my allotments,
and in my representation to the Surveyor-General, Captain Clark,
that in my grant all the portion of the plan marked by me in red
was clearly specified as Flinders street;. and also that in April,
1846, 1 think this street was proclaimed as being 3 chains 97 links
wide, and that the allotments in the division marked D were also
belonging to Flinders-street; the plans were withdrawn.
The position of the place marked in red, i.e., 396 feet from Spen-
cer-street by 159 feet from my northern boundary, is that which
the Government would receive by resuming possession of the wharf ;
and I have taken leave thus to bring the subject to your notice,
trusting that the information may be useful to the Government in
its consideration; and I beg respectfully to urge that for nearly
three months I have refrained from dealing with the property in
order that the Government might, should it be deemed desirable, at
once to resume possession of the allotment without having to pay
more compensation for improvements contemplated upon it.
I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient servant,
GEORGE WARD COLE.
To the Honorable G. S. Wagg Horne,
Commissioner of Public Works.
Cole?s Wharf, Melbourne, July 15, 1862.
Sir ?I have the honor to enclose copies of my letters under date
the Ist October, 1858, and 10th January, 1859, addressed to the
President of the Board of Land and Works and the Hon. the Com-
missioner of Public Works respectively, showing the advantage that
would accrue to the Government in the event of their deciding to
exercise their right of resuming possession of my land, known as
? Cole?s Wharf,? in accordance with the Crown Grant of the same
issued to me.
To these communications I had not the honor of receiving any
reply. I presume, therefore, that, at the time, it was not the
intention of the Government to exercise their right and resume
possession.
Since the date of my last communication, above alluded to, I
have leased the premises for a term of years, which expired on the
20th ultimo. I am, therefore,-now in a position to re-open the
matter again (prior to re-leasing them), with a view of knowing
whether, at the present time, the Government have it in contempla-
tion resuming the possession of the land.
I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient servant,
(Signed) GEORGE WARD COLE.
The Honorable John O?Shanassy,
Chief Secretary.


Chief Secretary?s Office,
Melbourne, 29th July, 1862.
Sir ?Your letter of the 15th July, relative to the land known
as ? Cole?s Wharf,? having been referred to the Honorable the
President of the Board of Land and Works, I am directed to
inform you he does not consider that the advantages to be derived
from the re-purchase of the wharf would be equivalent to the
probable cost of the proposed transaction. I have to be, sir, your
most obedient servant,
(Signed) J. MOORE.
The Honorable George W. Cole, M.P.,
Cole?s Wharf, Melbourne.
Melbourne, 9th March, 1864.
To the Hon. Commissioner op Trade and Customs,
Melbourne.
Sir?As the question of again levying a Wharfage rate in
Melbourne is now before the Houses of Parliament, I have the
honor to address you relative to the position I occupy as owner of
the wharf named ? Cole?s Wharf,? and beg the favor of your giving
the matter your consideration.
On the 14th August, 1841, I purchased from the Crown a water-
side frontage to the Yarra Yarra, being 132 ft. x 332 ft., at the
rate of �lOOO per acre.
This piece of land was at that time a mere swamp. I converted
it into a wharf; made the present spacious doc-*.., warehouses, and
offices j also enclosed the whole with high walls. The Government
then granted me a sufferance.
I need hardly tell you that the labor and expenses of these works
were enormous. . , ,
The public wharf accommodation was at that time most limited,
the Queen?s Wharf being merely the natural banks of the river.
The formation, therefore, of Cole?s Wharf by me was generally con-
sidered a great benefit to the public.
When I purchased this land, and made it into a wharf, and
erected substantial buildings upon it, certain wharfage rates were
payable on all goods landed on all wharfs, both public and
sufferance. I received the rates on those goods which were landed
on ? Cole?s Wharf.? The collection of these dues was the source I
looked to from which I was to have reimbursed myself for the labor
and capital I had employed in making wharf. In 1802,
wharfage rates were abolished by Act of Parliament, thereby ren-


dering all my past labor and expenditure useless, and depriving of
its value a wharf which had been constructed on the faith of the
continuance of the law in force when the Government sold the land
and I erected the buildings, and which law exists still in JSe\.
South Wales. .
It is thought by many that I have already received compensation
for my losses. Such, however, is not the case, as I have never
received one penny in consideration of ? Cole?s Wharf having been
rendered almost valueless by the passing of the act abolishing
wharfage rates.
In November, 1851, the lease of the right to collect wharfage
rates for twelve months in 1852, at the Queens Wharf, was sold
to me under heavy bonds at public auction, but before the termi-
nation of my lease the rates were abolished, and for the unexpired
portion of this lease I was paid by the Government, yet nothing did
I receive for my far greater losses on Cole?s Wharf.
I would also call your attention to an instance in which another
private wharf obtained compensation, viz., Hughes, which was
leased to Mr. Hughes by the Government at Is. per acre, under con-
ditions respecting buildings, but with the right to collect wharfage
rates. After Mr. Hughes had erected the buildings, it was found
he could not legally demand wharfage rates without a special act
authorising him to do so, this act the Legislation refusing to pass,
Mr. Hughes received compensation of about <�25,000 for not
obtaining the privilege, but I, from whom the same privilege was
withdrawn, received nothing,
After reading the above, I think you will consider that my case
deserves attention, and that I am entitled, should the new Wharfage
Act become law, to some of the advantages I formerly received as
owner of a Sufferance Wharf, and thus allow me to receive some
return for all the expense I had been put to in making my Wharf
at a time when it was greatly needed by the public.
In the event of it not being thought advisable to allow me a
portion of the rates, or if the rates are not established, I would call
your attention to the conditions under which I bought the property,
viz., that the Government may repurchase it at a sum to be fixed by
arbitration.
I should be glad if the Government would exercise this power,
and thus relieve me, in some measure, from the heavy liability
incurred, in expending my money on works rendered valueless by
circumstances over which I had no control.
I would respectfully point out that, irrespective of any claim I
may have for public consideration, the purchase of this land would
be of great value to the colony. This and the neighboring Wharf
would give the Government uninterrupted possession of the river-
frontage to the Fails, whilst my wharf contains certain buildings


thereon, well adapted for the use of the Customs as Queen?s Ware-
houses, into which dutiable or suspected cargoes might be stored or
discharged.
As also it is in contemplation, at some future period, to connect
the Wharfs and .Railways at Spencer-street, and* thus at once convey
into the interior the merchandise brought up the river, the posses-
sion of my premises would be most valuable for the undertaking,
as it would give a large and valuable space fronting Flinders-street,
which is at this point of great width, viz., 3 chains 97 links.
The purchase of this land would, therefore, not only be helping
the writer, but would secure an important property for the use of
the colony.
I must apologise for thus entering so minutely and at such great
length upon the subject, but the importance of it to me must be
my excuse. Trusting, therefore, that this appeal for compensation,
and for the purchase of the property, will be favorably considered
by you and your colleagues, I have the honor to remain, sir, yours
very truly,
(Signed) G. W. COLE.

To the Honorable the Speaker and Members of the Legislative
Assembly of the Colony of Victoria in Parliament Assembled.
The Petition of the Hon. George Ward Cole, of the City of
Melbourne, in the Colony of Victoria, Merchant,
Shbweth ?That your petitioner is the proprietor of the private
sufferance wharf, known as Cole?s Wharf.
That your petitioner has observed with alarm that your Honorable
House has passed a Bill authorising the collection of a wharfage
rate on any Wharves whether public or private.
That, inasmuch as such wharfage rate is ostensibly imposed for
the purpose of keeping in repair Public Wharves, your petitioner
protests against any such charge being imposed.
His wharf, the ground upon which the same is erected, and the
cost and maintenance for upwards of twenty years past, have been
paid for by your petitioner, during which time it has been used for
such purpose, interfere or challenge.
Your petitioner prays that your Honorable House will take this
petition into your consideration, and order him such relief as to your
Honorable House may seem best.
(Signed) GEORGE WARD COLE.

The following six Letters have passed since the enactment of
the present Wharfage Bill, and after the decision of the Select
Committee of the House of Assembly appointed to report on the
?Claims of the Owners of Private Wharves??had been arrived at.
Cole?s Wharf, 14th June, 1864.
Sir ?I have the honor to bring before the notice of the Govern-
ment the serious inconvenience entailed upon me by the uncertainty
in which I am placed respecting my wharf, and trust that I may be
informed whether it is the intention of the Government to carry out
the report of the select Committee appointed by Parliament to re-
port upon claims of owners of private wharves, dated 27th May,
1864.
I beg respectfully to call your attention to the following recom-
mendation of the report, viz., ? That the public convenience would
be served by the Government exercising the right of resumption,
under the powers contained in the Crown grants of the sold lands,
known as Cole?s and Raleigh?s wharves.?
Trusting the Government will give the subject a favorable consi-
deration, I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,
GEORGE WARD COLE.
To the Honorable J. G. Francis,
Commissioner of Trade and Customs.
Department of Trade and Customs,
Melbourne, 22nd June, 1864.
Sir ?I am directed by the Honorable the Commissioner of
Trade and Customs to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the
14th instant, requesting to be informed whether Government intend
to carry out the report of the select Committee on private wharves,
dated 27th May last ; and in reply, lam to point out to you that
the report in question has never been considered by Parliament, and
therefore that the Government has no authority or power to comply
with your request. I am, however, to add, that it is perfectly open
to you to submit your property to Government at a reasonable price,
and that if concurrently a similar proposition were made as to
Raleigh?s Wharf, the Commissioner would submit to his colleagues


the expediency of providing for the purchase on the estimates for
1865, conditional always that the Government consider it desirable
to buy on the terms required. I have the honor to be, sir, your
obedient servant,
J. CHATFIELD TYLER.
Cole?s Wharf, 10th November, 1864.
Sir ?I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Tyler?s
letter of the 22nd June, 1864, in reply to mine of the 14th June,
requesting to be informed whether the Government intended to
carry out the report of the Select Committee on Private Wharves,
dated 27th May last; and in reply he states : ?? lam to point out
to you that the report in question has never been considered by Par-
liament, and therefore the Government has no authority or power to
comply with your request. I am, however, further to add that it is
perfectly open to you to submit your property to Government at a
reasonable price, and if concurrently a similar proposition were made
as to Raleigh?s Wharf, the Commissioner would submit to his col-
leagues the expediency of providing for the purchase on the Esti-
mates of 1865, conditional always the Government consider it desir-
able to buy on the terms required.?
In reply, I beg to say that I have communicated the contents of
his letter to the proprietors of Raleigh?s Wharf, who will no doubt
communicate with you on the subject.
As regards my wharf, I respectfully urge that I may not be asked
to sell at a price named by .myself, but that the value of the property
be ascertained by arbitration, as provided for in the Crown grant,
and as recommended by the Committee alluded to.
I cannot allow the present opportunity to pass without again
pointing out the injustice I am suffering by not being placed in a
similar position to that I occupied under the Wharfage Acts, 3
William IV. No. 6, 4 Victoria No. 4, 7 Victoria No. 12, 8 Victo-
ria No. 16, now that the necessity has arisen for the re-imposition
of a wharfage rate. I am at present chargeable with a wharfage
rate on goods belonging to myself, although landed at my own
wharf, upon which the Government has not expended anything, in
either its construction or repairs. I have the honor to be, sir, your
obedient servant,
GEORGE WARD COLE.

Sir?l am directed by the Honorable the Commissioner of Trade
and Customs to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th
instant, and in reply to state the Government can only regret that
you did not name such a reasonable sum as would have induced
Mr. Francis to recommend his colleagues to place on the estimates
for 1865 the necessary funds for the purchase of your property. I
have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,

Melbourne, Iffth January, 1865.
Sir ?I have the honor to bring under your notice that I have
decided to offer my wharf premises at public auction, in accordance
with the annexed advertisement, and X take the liberty of drawing
your attention to the injury I am suffering under the present
Wharfage Act, by not being exempt from dues on goods landed
thereat, as was the case under 3 William IV. No. 6, &c., Ac., at
the time I became purchaser of the land known as Cole?s Wharf.
In my letter to the Honorable the Commissioner of Trade and
Customs, under date 10th November last, relative to the purchase
of the wharf by arbitration, as provided for in the Crown Grant of
the land in question, I concluded as follows :?? I cannot allow the
present opportunity to pass without again pointing out the injustice
I am suffering by not being placed in a similar position to that I
occupied under the Wharfage Acts?3 William IV. No. 6, 4 Vic.
No. 4, 7 Vic. No. 12, 8 Vic. No. 16 ; and now the necessity has
arisen for the re-imposition of a wharfage rate, I am at present
chargeable with a wharfage rate on goods belonging to myself,
although landed at my own wharf, upon which the Government has
not expended anything in either its construction or repairs.?
I most respectfully urge that you. will bring my case under the
consideration of the Government, so that measures may be brought
before Parliament to exempt my wharf from dues now chargeable
on goods landed there, and thus enable me to realise from its sale
a price I ought to get had the present Wharfage Act provided for
exemption of charge, as was done in previous Acts of a similar
character. I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,
GEORGE WARD COLE.

to this department, requesting that measures might be taken to
exempt your wharf from dues now charged on goods landed there, I
have the honor to acquaint you, in reply, by direction of the Honor-
able the Commissioner of Trade and Customs, that the law does
not permit your request being acceded to. I have the honor to be,

MR. HOLROYD?S SPEECH
BEFORE THE
StM Craraattee of ik JtosmWs
ON THE CLAIMS OF
PRIVATE WHARVES.
Wednesday , May, 1864.
Members Present ;
Mr. LALOR in the Chair
Mr. ANDERSON
Mr. BERRY
Mr. FRANCIS
Mr. McMahon
Mr. Holroyd.?
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, ?I have the honor to appear
before you in support of the Petitions which have been pre-
sented to the Legislative Assembly, one by Mr. George Ward
Cole, the other by the Bank of Australasia, as the owners of
the private wharves known as Cole?s Wharf, and Raleigh?s
Wharf ; and at the outset I wish to impress upon the Committee
the character in which I appear before them, and the way in
which I wish to present the case of my clients. I have had
through the kindness of the Committee, an opportunity of
hearing some of the discussion which took place with reference
to the claim of the Hobson?s Bay Railway Company ? and
although my clients and the Hobson?s Bay Railway Company
may have some common ground to stand upon, yet at the same
time, we are not by any means in the same position. Gentle-


men 1 do not wish to appear before the Committee as endea-
vouring to enforce upon them any abstract right neither do 1
wish to enter, further than I can possibly avoid it, into any
discussion of questions of political economy. Those gentlemen,
are your province, and not mine. Ido not wish to duwj�s
whether it is or is not for the public advantage that the
Government should enter into competition with private indivi-
duals. Neither do I wish to assert that my clients are entitled
absolutely and as a right to a compensation, if they are injured
by any act of the Legislature which the Legislature conceive to
be for the public good. But I wish merely to take up that
which I think is a recognised position, both in England and
here that when measures are passed which the Legislature
conceives to be for the public good, those measures should be
passed with as little injury as possible to private individuals ;
and that if anything can be done to prevent any injury that is
likely to befall private individuals, in consequence ol the act ot
the Legislature, the Legislature will favourably entertain any
application for that purpose.
Gentlemen, the case of my two clients is very much the same.
There are some slight differences, but generally they are the same ;
and I will begin first with the case of Mr. Cole. In August,
1841 Mr Cole purchased at a Crown Land sale a frontage to the
river Yarra of 132 feet, having also a similar frontage to Flmders-
street by a depth of 332 feet. The land purchased was about
an acre in extent, and the price paid was at the rate of
�IOOO per acre. You are well aware, gentlemen, of the con-
dition at that time of the river, and of the banks of the
river. They were then in their natural state, and liable to be
flooded as we saw them this year, and there was no
wharf accommodation upon them I believe at that time
there existed what has been called the Queens Wharf with
a frontage of about 150 feet, in a very miserable condition,
and quite unfit for the purpose for which it was supposed to be
adapted. At that time there was an Act in existence, the 4th
Victoria No. 4, passed in 1840, which repealed the former Act,
but merely with reference to the amount of rates. By the 4th
section of that Act, wharfage rates were imposed on all goods
landed at the Queen?s Wharf at Sydney, or at any other public
wharf within New South Wales. At the same tune there was
a system in existence, by which sufferances were granted to per-
sons who erected, or were the owners of private wharves, I hose
sufferances entitled the owners of the wharves to receive goods
which were landed there, and they were enabled to charge rates.
I ought not properly to call them rates, because they were in-
tended for the benefit of the owners themselves, but they
were enabled to charge certain sums of money upon the


goods landed, which were equal in amount to the rates
charged by the Government at the public wharves, and those
rates went into the pockets of the private owners, and
were a direct encouragement to persons who wished to
afford accommodation to the public. Mr. Cole was one
of the persons who obtained such a sufferance. The sufferance
was granted to him, I think, in 1842. There are certain letters
which I will submit to the Committee which will show you the
dates, gentlemen, and also show the conditions on which the
sufferance was obtained. In the sufferance itself there was
contained a condition that Mr. Cole should erect a wall nine feet
in height round the whole premises, and of course it was an
understood thing that the wharf was to be used for the conve-
nience of the public and for public purposes, and that it was to
be to a certain extent a public wharf, except that the monies
collected there went into the pocket of the private owner instead
of into the pocket of the Government. Mr. Cole complied with
the conditions contained in his sufferance. He erected a wall
nine feet high round the whole of the premises, and he also did
what was necessary to provide dock and wharfage accommoda-
tion at that part of the river. He executed a dock, the dimen-
sions of which were 122 feet by 42 feet. He also constructed
a landing place on piles, and a platform of about 4000 feet
in extent, if I am rightly informed, and at the same time he
erected sheds and warehouses for the purposes of storing goods;
and he also erected, at the head of his wharf, a shed and
warehouse for the special accommodation of the officers of
Customs. In Mr. Cole?s Crown Grant, I may mention here,
before I pass on, there was contained a clause which empowered
the Crown to resume the land at any time, if they required it for
the improvement of the town, or for any public purposes; and
in that case a valuation was to be made of the land, and buildings
upon it, in the manner pointed out in the Crown Grant itself, by
arbitration; and the Government was to pay the value of the
land and buildings. When I come to the case of Raleigh?s
Wharf, as I may mention here, it will be perceived
that all these Crown Grants are exactly similar. They
all contain this sort of reservation to the Crown, and
that reservation appears to have contemplated that, at
some future time, a case like the present would arise,
and that it might be necessary for the Government to take into
its own hands the whole of the frontage of the river near the
city. This went on for some time, Mr. Cole having built his
wharf, and erected his premises. The public made use of them,
and goods for a long time were landed, for there was no other
accommodation to compete with him. Those who could not use
his Wharf were obliged to use the 150 feet of the Queen?s
c 2


Wharf, or use the river banks, which I believe they did when
the banks were not covered with water. Mr. Cole went on
landing* the g*oods and receiving* the rates until the end of the
following year, and on the Bth of December, 1843, another
Act was passed, the 7th Victoria, No. 12, the 14th section of
which provides for goods landed on public wharves, and that
contains a proviso that one-third of those rates should be
payable on private wharves. As this proviso is expressed, it is
?that goods landed at any private sufferance wharf should be
only charged one-third of the rate, but it is clear from the rest
of the Act that it is intended that one-third of the whole rate
should go to the Government, the owner being allowed to
levy the same rate as the Government. A further alteration
was made on the 20th of December, 1844, when the Bth
Victoria, No. 16, was passed, by which the rates to be levied
at public wharves were reduced to two-thirds of those in the
schedule to the former Act, and the rates that were to go to
the Government from the sufferance wharves were still to
remain at one-third, therefore, in point of fact the Government
got half the rates that were actually levied under the Bth
Victoria, No. 16, and the private owner got the other half.
That Act continued in force until after the separation of the
colony, and I shall be able to inform the Committee, I think, of
the amount of money which was received for wharfage alone,
both by Mr. Cole and Mr. Raleigh, and his predecessor at
Raleigh?s Wharf, for most of the years up to 1852, when the rates
were abolished. In September, 1852, an Act was passed, which
came into operation on the Ist of October, 1863, the 16th Victoria,
No. 12, the first section of which repealed the previous Acts, of
which I have been speaking*. The effect of that, therefore, was
to abolish the wharfage rates. Against that Bill Mr. Cole
petitioned, and he was also heard against the Bill at the Bar of
the House. His petition was not successful. Neither does it
appear that the arguments of his counsel produced that effect
which he desired. It is in connection with this Act that I shall
have to refer to a suggestion that has been raised by a portion of
the evidence taken before the Committee in this matter, as to a
certain letter which may require possibly some explanation. This
petition having been presented, and counsel having been heard,
the Bill was passed through the House very hastily. A Com-
mittee, I believe, was to have been moved for by Mr. Westgarth,
but it never was moved for, and the Act was passed very hurriedly;
and it may have been in consequence of that, that the investiga-
tion that was desired, both by Mr. Cole and Mr. Raleigh, who
also petitioned, did not actually take place. At this time, also,
in December, 1852, when the Act abolishing the rates was passed,
Mr. Cole was the lessee, having purchased the lease at public


auction, of the rates collected at the Queen?s Wharf. His lease
had then three months to run, and he applied, in consequence of
the abolition of the rates, to the Government for compensation
in respect of that lease. That compensation, I may mention
shortly here, was granted to him, on the award of Mr. Cassell,
the Collector of Customs, who was appointed to consider the
question, to the amount of upwards of �3,000. Mr. Cole then
proposed to the Government with respect to his own private
wharf that they should purchase it, and he offered to sell it to
them at that time for �60,000; and the Committee will observe
the vast difference between the amount awarded in respect of
rates collected as the lessee of the Queen?s Wharf and the pro-
position made by Mr. Cole to the Government for the purchase
of his premises. A great deal of correspondence took place
between the Government and Captain Cole immediately after
the passing l of this Act, and some of those letters I shall present
to the Committee, but one of them I must refer to at greater
length. It has been already read to the Committee, but it is
the letter to which I have referred as possibly requiring some
explanation. It is dated the 21st of January, 1853. The
award of Mr. Cassell with respect to the lease was made on the
6th of September, 1853. Mr. Cole?s letter is addressed to the
Colonial Secretary, is dated the 21st of January, 1853, and is
to the following effect : ? u Sir, ?Having already had the honor
of acknowledging the receipt of your letter of sth October last,
52/4171, I now beg leave to refer to the second paragraph,
respecting my lease of the Wharfage rates to the 31st December
last, and intimating as follows : ? 1 That His Excellency has
every disposition to act justly and rightly by you, but as you
have brought your claim before the Legislative Council, His
Excellency awaits the decision of that body as to the course
which it would recommend in the matter.? In reply, I would
respectfully submit that there must be some misapprehension as
to the prayer of my petition to the Council, as I intended that
prayer for compensation to be for injury sustained to my private
Wharf by the abolition of Wharfage, not for a moment sup-
posing that my lease would be interfered with, and my alluding
to the remainder of the term of the. lease of Wharfage Rates
was to show that I held it until the 31st December, considering,
as I still do, it was a claim I was justly entitled to under the
agreement. I, therefore, beg you will submit to His Excellency
my claim for the rates that would have been collected had they
not been abolished; and, in order to arrive at a proper and just
conclusion of remuneration, I have had a calculation made from
actual entries at the Custom House for the three months due
of the lease, by the Custom House agents, as follows.? Then
there is a calculation which I will not trouble the Committee


with, and then he ends his letter ??With reference to my
petition to the Council for compensation for my private wharf,
I beg- you will acquaint His Excellency that I have abandoned
such claim.? I may observe that if I were contending, not as
I am here before this Committee who have to guard the public
interests, and at the same time act as judges between Mr. Cole
and the public, and consider whether this is a claim which they
can recommend to the House to adopt; but if I were con-
tending here with an opponent who insisted upon all manner of
technical objections, I do not think that an observation of that
kind, or even an agreement to abandon a claim of this kind,
would have any effect in law whatever. I am merely now
stating what is the legal operation of such a clause in my
opinion. There is no consideration for such an agreement,
unless indeed it be suggested that this abandonment of the claim
in respect of the wharfage rates was put forward with the view
of inducing the Government to accede to a proposition with
respect to the lease. I think I shall make it clear that that is
highly improbable, and in fact that there is no foundation for
such a suggestion. I believe that the two matters were totally
unconnected with each other; but, irrespective of that, certainly
if this were really a legal question between two adversaries, each
one wishing to take every possible advantage of the other, Ido
not think my opponent, in such a case, would be able to take
any advantage of an agreement to abandon a claim simply stated
without any consideration whatever for it. But this letter is
susceptible of a very easy explanation. As I have said, the Act
was passed in some haste. Subsequently to the passing of the
Act, Mr. Cole made a proposition to the Government to sell to
them the whole of his premises for �60,000. That claim had
at the time this letter was written been rejected. Mr. Cole was
under the impression amongst other things, that it would have
been extremely difficult for him to press his claim vigorously
upon the Government at that moment. He was also, as I shall
show to the Committee, very busily engaged in other matters
of great importance. Mr. Cole was the owner of a steamer, the
? City of Melbourne,? the first screw steamer I believe that was
ever built in this part of the world. That steamer, at the time
at which this letter was written, had been cast away, and no
one knew where, and Mr. Cole -was exceedingly busy ; and almost
his whole time and attention at that period were devoted to
endeavouring to ascertain what had become of this steamer, and
also to induce the Government to take measures to assist him,
and to help him in that search. That was a position which I
submit to the Committee affords a very reasonable explanation
of what this letter amounts to, that is to say, to saying?at this
moment Ido not wish to press this claim. That, however, was


not the only reason, and I should not be dealing fairly with the
Committee if I did not state all the reasons. It is possible that,
if the great press of business arising from the gold diggings and
his anxiety from the loss of his vessel had not existed, Mr. Cole
might have thought twice before he wrote this letter, in which
he says the claim was abandoned. But, there were two
other reasons for his doing so, and one of these is a
reason, which, I think, should rather dispose the Com-
mittee to regard the present claim with favour, and
it was this, that there was at that time a prospect that Mr.
Cole might be in other ways amply remunerated. People, I
believe, thought that the sudden rush of prosperity which
had come upon the colony by the discovery of gold, would
last for ever, and Mr. Cole was somewhat of the same impression,
and consequently he expected, as of course would be the case,
that every vessel that used his wharf would be an advantage to
him in this respect ?that it would enable him to use his lighters
and steamers, and make profits in other ways besides the rates.
The rates were by no means the largest portion of his profit; the
possession of the wharf enabled him to make profit in
other ways, and he was in hopes, and had some expectation
that that profit would continue at any rate lor a very considerable
time. There was also another circumstance which induced him
to be less anxious in pressing his claim upon the House at a time
when he had reason to suppose he might have very little chance
of succeeding, and that was that the question of the re-imposition
of Wharfage Bates, in which the private wharfingers would
have the same advantages as they had before, was one which
had been already mooted, and was extremely likely to
be carried into effect. It was a very reasonable expectation
that if the rates were re-imposed, and that when they are
re-imposed the private owners would have, as before, a
share of them. That that was a reasonable expectation,
appears by what was actually done. In 1854 a Bill was
introduced for the purpose of re-imposing Wharfage
Rates. That Bill was ultimately lost by a majority of
one; but before that Bill was lost, the question had been
discussed as to whether the owners of private wharves were
entitled to any portion of the- rates, supposing they had
been re-established. It had been debated, and that was
carried by a very considerable majority. It was carried by
a majority that the owners of private wharves should be entitled
to one-half of the rates, if they were re-imposed. Indeed there
was very little difference of opinion that some compensation
should be given to them ; but in consequence of circumstances
connected with the claim of Mr. Hughes, the whole Bill was
ultimately rejected by a majority of one, and consequently


the promised compensation fell to the ground. I may observe,
that at that time, when this subsequent Bill was passed, and in
all subsequent negotiations?for there have been many such?
Mr. Cole has made many subsequent offers to the Government
for the sale of his wharf; at that time, and in these subsequent
negotiations, no one ever considered that this expression, ? I
have abandoned such claim,? was intended to mean that Mr.
Cole had for all time given up his right to come before the
House, and to ask either for a certain share of the rates
or for some other compensation. What we are coming
before you now to ask, gentlemen, is not a sum of money.
We are asking for such relief as the Committee shall
think proper to recommend to Parliament, and as may be fair and
just. That relief, as I have suggested, would be by the Govern-
ment purchasing Cole?s and Raleigh?s Wharves under the pro-
visions in the Crown grant. This Bill is already passed, but it
might have been, or even now it might be, if the Committee
recommended to Parliament that it would be fair, that private
owners should have a portion of the rates ; but neither of these
things are a claim of so much money for compensation, and
what Mr. Cole abandons in this letter, as it seems to me, is the
claim which he was at that moment endeavouring to press upon
the Legislative Council. His offer for sale had been rejected at
the time. He knew that he could not press that with success
any further, for the Government had point blank rejected it.
But he says, ?This particular thing which I am actually pressing,
I abandon?l give up. I shall not weary you further with
discussing this matter, you need not take this further into con-
sideration, for I shall take no further steps upon it at this
moment.? It was a measure of prudence, a measure also
partly caused by the pressure of business upon himself, and
partly by a meritorious motive, that of not wishing to be eager
to press a claim upon the House, as to which, if we were to go
into abstract rights, the right would be equally as just, whether
he had other means of realising a large fortune, or whether,
but for the collection of those rates, he would be impoverished;
if it was legitimate one way, it would be the other. But,
at the same time, it was a meritorious thing in him to say,
? Having an expectation that I shall succeed in realising a
large profit by other means, I will not press this claim at this
time.? But that expectation, gentlemen, has been disap-
pointed ; and I think it is a circumstance which you may take
into your favourable consideration, that at the time when there
was every reason to suppose a claim in some shape or other would
have been favourably entertained?not that he could have pressed
that particular claim at that particular moment successfully
?but if he had kept this out of his title, and in a few years


had come forward with some other claim vigorously, he mighthave
got something ; yet, being in expectation of deriving profit from
other sources, he said, ? I will not press it.? The motives were mixed
undoubtedly; it was not altogether a consideration of the public
interests, nor yet entirely a motive personal to himself, but it
was a mixed motive, partly because his mind was occupied with
very distressing and harassing circumstances arising from the
loss of his steamer; partly because he was occupied with very
heavy business; partly because the time was unpropitious for
urging that particular claim upon the Legislative Council, and
partly because it was not necessary to urge the claim for com-
pensation when there was a probability of his being remunerated
from other sources. But if I were to leave it altogether unnoticed, it
might be supposed that this letter was an inducement to the Govern-
ment to grant Mr. Cole some compensation in respect of his lease.
I think, however, a moment?s consideration would show that that
could not be so. The claim which he had been pressing upon
the Government was for the sale of his Wharf at �60,000. The
amount of Wharfage Rates that he had collected in the nine
months from the commencement of 1852 to the time when the
Wharfage Rates were abolished, was upwards of �3,000, �3,480
odd?that is for nine months?and the expenditure which he
had then incurred upon his premises at Cole?s Wharf, amounted
to the sum of something like �BO,OOO, not for building the Wharf
alone, but for everything. Now, if rates were ever re-imposed, and
he were not allowed to charge any further rates, the depreciation
in the value of that property would have been something enor-
mous, and therefore a claim for �3,000 contested could never
have entered into a man?s mind in competition with this very
much larger claim. He had reasonable expectation that if he sold
the wharf he might get �60,000. Of course, as I have said, the
whole sources of profit were not simply derived from wharfage
rates, but from other accidental advantages, depending upon the
fact of Ids being the grantee of the sufferance; but, at the same
time, the depreciation in the value of the property would amount
to several thousand pounds, at least half what he offered it to
the Government for, and such a little sum as �3OOO
never could have stood in his mind for a moment,
in competition with a claim of �30,000. It is true as matter of
fact, it appears in this letter that the two subjects, that of his
private wharf and the lease, were before the writer?s mind at the
time. There has been a confusion in the mind of the Govern-
ment as to some previous offers of Mr. Cole, and he wished to dis-
tinguish them. He does distinguish them, and then at the end of
the letter he says, ??With respect to one of these questions, do not
trouble yourselves any further about it now, for that is gone.? I
submit, therefore, to the consideration of the Committee, thatif they


think Mr. Cole is entitled to compensation on other grounds, the
occurrence of these few words in this letter is not a reason why
they should refuse it to him.
Nor, gentlemen, has Mr. Cole been by any means negligent in
pressing his claims upon the attention of the Government. Ido
not mean to say that he has pressed them with over great care or
earnestness, but he has certainly called the attention of the
successive Governments of the colony to the circumstance that he
had a Wharf, that he had been deprived of certain advantages
which, at the time he constructed that Wharf and expended his
money, he was led to expect would accrue from it, and that
therefore he had a fair right to come before the Government and
ask them to purchase his Wharf. He applies to Mr. Duffy?
he applies to Mr. Horne?and he applies to Mr. O?Shanassy, and
he makes them all the offer of the Wharf. To two of those
letters he receives no answer. That addressed to Mr. Duffy was
not answered, for Mr. Duffy quitted the Ministry?his successor,
Mr. Horne, made no reply. The reply, at the time that Mr.
O?Shanassy was at the head of the Government, was that the
Government did not at that time consider that the advantages to
them from the purchase of the premises would be equal to the
price asked for them.
Mr. Anderson: Did they ever offer to refer it to arbitration ?
Mr. Holroyd: Mr. Cole points out in these letters that the
Crown Grant provides a mode by which the value was to be
arrived at. The Crown Grant itself provides for referring it to
arbitration, and in almost all these letters the Crown Grant is
referred to as containing provisions under which the land may be
sold ; and it is under the provisions of that Grant that he offers
the Wharf to the Government. In the first place he names a
particular sum, but in the other case I do not think he names
any sum; but in all cases he refers to the Crown Grant as
containing the ultimate mode by which the value is to be arrived
at, that is to say, by arbitration.
Gentlemen?At the time the Bill for the re-imposition of
Wharfage Kates was rejected, there were certain Minutes
of Mr. La Trobe and Sir Charles Hotham with respect
to this subject, which I should like to read to the
Committee to show the opinions entertained at that time. One
is a portion of a speech of Mr. La Trobe with respect to the rejec-
tion of the Bill for the re-imposition of Wharfage Rates, delivered
on the 12th April, 1854. It is the 17th clause in his speech,
in which he says: ?? I regret, however, that it has been held
advisable to reject the Bill for the levying of Wharfage Rates,
which I had introduced upon the urgent representations of the
commercial community. While that rejection limits
for the present the means of increasing the facilities for the


commerce of the colony, which are so earnestly called for,
every exertion shall be made by the Government to pie-
pare a comprehensive scheme for yonr consideration at a
future day.? The Bill, as His Excellency states here,
nas been Introduced at the urgent recommendation of the
commercial community, and there had been very little
difference of opinion as to this point, that if the Bill was passed,
the private wharfingers should be remunerated by having one-
half of the rates. There is also a Minute of Sir Charles
Hotham?s, dated the 23rd of November, 1854, and in the 13th
section of that Minute, his Excellency was recommending a
Harbour Trust, and he says, ?The Lieutenant-Governor is of
opinion that the banks of the Yarra Yarra, from the Breakwater
to a certain point to be determined upon, should be included
in this arrangement, the present sufferance wharves being
resumed, and compensation given to the proprietors as opportu-
nities and the state of the funds may permit, such compensation
forming a charge, if possible, on the trust, so that a moderate
and uniform rate of wharfage on goods and tonnage on vessels
may be charged, which would ensure the property being kept in
efficient repair, and at the same time promote the interests and
convenience of the trade of the port.? Now, it is obvious that
those representations were representations which would be afloat
amongst the commercial community, and therefore Mr. Cole had
reasonable ground for supposing, a year before, that such reimpo-
sition of rates was likely, from the opinion which was entertained
respecting those claims. And if those claims were good then, they
are, as I urge upon you, gentlemen, equally good now, although
some time has elapsed. Still, no damage has been done to the State
by the lapse of time?no wrong, or harm, or injury has accrued
to the State by the fact that these claims have not hitherto been
satisfied. There seems to have been in many quarters, even in
Parliament, a strong disposition to admit these claims Circum-
stances seem to have arisen, by reason of which these claims have
not been satisfied. But they still exist, and they would now
even come with stronger force; for if they were just and have
been kept in abeyance, there would be some ground to take into
consideration the delay itself, which has been incurred in render-
ing redress; although I do not at all rely upon that, because as
I say the Parliament themselves are the persons to consider what
is fair. lam not urging this as a question of abstract right, but
as something which, as the guardians of the conscience of Parlia-
ment here, the Committee may fairly recommend them to do, as
a wise act, an act consistent with the principles of political
economy which they admit, and as one which commends itself
to their notion of justice.
Gentlemen, I will now refer to the case of Raleigh?s Wharf,


which is in many respects the same, and I will give you a
short statement of the history of that. There were two Crown
grants in that case; one granted to a Mr. Skene Craig, and
the other to a Mr. Dobson, for rather more than half an acre
each, in February, 1842, at the time when the whole of
the rates on private wharves were reserved by the private
owners for their own benefit. In the following month of
March, 1842, Mr. Craig conveyed his allotment to Mr.
Dobson; and in August, 1845, Mr. Dobson sold the property
to Mr. Joseph Raleigh; and in 1856 it came into the hands of
the Petitioners, the Bank of Australasia, from the Trustees of
Mr. Raleigh. It came into their hands in the first instance
as a security, and ultimately they were obliged to purchase it.
The Bank paid for it altogether, after deducting the rent they
have received since their purchase, a sum of upwards of
�30,000. They have received rents I think to the amount of
�4,000, but the sum they have actually paid amounts to
�30,000, allowing for the rents which they have received. Mr.
Dobson was the first person who received the grant of a
sufferance, and he stood in precisely the same position as Mr.
Cole. The sufferance was granted to him on the same
conditions. He built his wall round the premises, and erected
his wharves; and Mr. Joseph Raleigh, the succeeding owner,
also constructed a road from the wharf at his own expense.
The Crown grants also in the case of Raleigh?s wharf contained
the same conditions for resumption on purchase. Mr. Raleigh,
at the time of the Act of 1852, was a petitioner like Mr, Cole,
although he does not seem to have entered into the negotiations
with the Government which were entered into by the former
gentleman. Mr. Raleigh was a petitioner at that time, and
he has never renounced his claim. It appears that for three
years after 1866, Raleigh?s Wharf was let. From December,
1856, to August, 1857, it was leased to Mr, Throckmorton, at
the rate of �7OO per annum.
Chairman: Did that include the plant, the lighters, vessels,
and things, or only the building ?
Mr Holroyd: I am instructed, sir, that it was for the wharf
only. From September, 1857, to 1858, in one year the price
rose considerably. It was �2,000 per annum for that year, and
from September, 1858, up to about 1860, the price per annum
was �750. lam speaking of Raleigh?s Wharf now. I believe
Cole?s Wharf was also leased; I think it was leased in 1869, about
January, but lam not sure as to the exact month. Mr. Cole
also leased to Mr. Throckmorton for three years at the rate of
�2,000 per annum, by a lease which expired in 1861, Mr. Throck-
morton refused to renew, because then he was able to obtain
the accommodation he required at the Queen?s Wharf, free


of expense The actual amount of net wharfage which was
received was as follows-.-From 1847 to 1862, the average
amount of net wharfage for those five years received by Mr.
Cole at his private wharf, as his share of the rates, was
�1386 165., from 1847 to the commencement of 1852;
but from the Ist of January, 1852, to the Ist of October, 1852,
the net amount received was �3OOO and upwards. I have not
the exact amount of Mr. Raleigh?s average, but it was something
less than Mr. Cole?s. From 1847 to 1852, the average was
about +?loo less than Mr. Cole?s, and from the Ist of January to
the IsTof October, 1852, the net amount received by him was
�3164 8s 2d It will therefore be seen by the Committee, as is
obvious from these figures, that the wharfage rates were abolished
iust at the time they were becoming valuable and when they
might have produced to the owner a large fortune. In nine
months of 1852 the amount received was nearly three times
what it was in any previous year, so that as far as the interests
of my clients are concerned, the very worst-moment was selected
that could have been for the abolition of these wharfage rates
There was another gentleman who had a wharf here, and the
Government considered the claim of that other gentleman some
years ago, although his was a prospective claim, or a claim
rather for advantages entirely prospective and ours was a claim
for the loss of advantages which we had actually enjoyed for
some years. That is the case of Mr. Hughes In 1853, Mr
D. A. Hughes applied on behalf of the Peninsular and Oriental
Company to the Government for accommodation for the pur-
poses of the Company. He applied to the Government fora
orant of land; the Government were not disposed to make a
o-rant of land, and a considerable negotiation took place upon
that subiect, the ultimate result of which was, that the Govern-
ment consented to grant to a Mr. William Hughes I may say,
as a kind of Trustee for the Company-! shall explain the pro-
visions of that agreement?a lease for 21 years, at the rate of Is.
per annum, of the ground now known as Hughes Wharf and
it was a part of the terms of that agreement for a lease that Mr.
Hughes should be at liberty to levy certain sums of money upon
all goods landed at his wharf. .The rate to be levied was to be
fixed by two arbitrators or valuers?one appointed by Mr.
Huo-hes himself, and the other by the Government, or by an
umpire if they differed. The conditions imposed upon him were
that he should complete the wharf for the accommodation of the
public within three years. It had been a part of the proposition
of the Peninsular and Oriental Company that they should obtain
wharfage accommodation and the ground for making it entire y
for their own purposes. The Government desired that it should
be open for all the public. It was what may be called by a sort


of contradiction?a private-public wharf; it was to be used by
all the public, but the private owner was to get the benefit of
the rates there levied. If the Peninsular and Oriental Company
chose within one year to adopt this agreement that had been
made with Mr. William Hughes, they were to be at liberty to
do so, and then they were to stand in his place. The condi-
tions imposed upon Mr. William Hughes were?the completion
of the wharf in three years, and the outlay of a sum of �lOOO
upon it within six months. In a little less than a year we find
this agreement broken up, and Mr. Hughes allowed compensa-
te the amount of �25,000 for advantages which he had enjoyed
certainly for a very short time. It was discovered almost
immediately that the Government had no power to grant a lease
of land in this way, and it was very much debated whether the
levying of rates by the authority of the Governor was justifiable,
and the consequence was that the agreement for a lease fell to
the ground, and could not be carried out. Then it was that Mr.
Hughes claims were submitted to arbitration, and an award was
made, by which he received a sum of �26,000 in cash. He had,
it appears, completed his wharf to a certain extent, sufiicient to
open it considerably within the stipulated time. The only stipu-
lation was that he should expend �lOOO within six months. He
pressed on the work; he was not called upon to do so. The
Government in that case certainly dealt very fairly and liberally
so far as he was concerned, and did not throw it into his
teeth that this expense would have been avoided if he
had not been so anxious to complete his work before it
was necessary; but they took it into account, and gave him com-
pensation for everything he had done, and that compensation
to the fullest and most ample extent ?that was Mr. Hughes?s
case. In his case of course there would have been no means of
resuming possession, the land only having been promised to be
leased to him, and our case is different to his. However he
claimed compensation and got it.
Mr. Anderson : It would necessarily have fallen in at the end
of the lease.
Mr. Holroyd: Yes, Sir.
Chairman : Without any compensation ?
Mr. Holroyd : Yes, Sir.
Chairman: Did Mr. Dobson purchase by auction ?
Mr. Holroyd: Yes, Sir. Craig and Dobson each purchased
half, and then Craig sold to Dobson the next land to his own
and then, two years afterwards, Mr. Raleigh became the owner!
Mr. Dobson did part of the construction of the Wharf, and Mr.
Raleigh further improved it. In point of fact, in principle there
is no difference in the two cases, they rest upon the same
footing.


There is another case which I may mention to the Committee.
I shall put in evidence a statement with reference to this
Hughes? Wharf, and I need not, therefore, trouble the Committee
farther with it, those being the main points which I have already
mentioned. But there is another case in England, upon the
question of compensation, which, as it is rather a striking one,
and affords an illustration of the extent to which that
doctrine has been carried at home, I may mention to the
Committee. That was the case of the West India Docks.
The West India Dock Act was passed on the 12th ot July, 1/yy,
and by that Act, for the purpose of giving encouragement to the
Company started to construct those docks, all goods arriving
from the West Indies were to be landed at those docks for twenty-
one years. They had a monopoly of the West India trade for
twenty-one years. But there were in that neighbourhood a
great many private wharves, and a great many other persons
who might have been injured by that monopoly?persons
employed at those other wharves?the owners of lighters and
owners of storehouses, and even porters and persons of that
description employed in carrying the goods ; and all those persons
were taken into consideration by the Legislature in passing that
Act, and all those persons were to be compensated for any injury
done to them.
Chairman: ere the Company to compensate them '
Mr. Holroyd: No, sir; I think not. The Act is the 39th
George 111. (Local and Personal). Cap. 69, and the 121 st section,
provides: ? Whereas, by reason, or in consequence of certain
parts of the works, improvements and regulations intended by
this Act, some of the said present legal quays, and of the other
quays or wharfs commonly called Public Foreign Sufferance
wharfs??those are the first persons they take into considera-
tion, the services of sufferance wharves and certain warehouses,
docks, and divers other tenements and hereditaments now in or
adjoining the said port, some of which warehouses are known
by the name of up-town warehouses, and used for the recep-
tion of West India produce, and other goods landed, may perhaps
become less valuable,??they provide even against the possible
contingency ?** mny perhnps beQome less vnlunblej by menns of
the trade or business of the same respectively being in part
diverted, than the same respectively are at present, and divers
owners and occupiers of, and other persons interested in or
employed upon the business of such legal quays and sufferance
wharf, warehouses, docks, and other tenements and hereditaments,
may thereby sustain loss or damage, and the yearly and other
receipts of the Governors of Christ s Hospital, in the City of
London, for or on account of car-rooms, or figures for using three
carts within the said city and the liberties thereof, may also


thereby happen to be lessened,??it is all a supposed case??Be
ff� re f 6nacte s that in case such legal quays
and sufferance wharves, wharehouses, docks, and other tene-
ments and hereditaments, or any of them, shall by rea-
son of the said intended works, or any of them bp
rendered less valuable by reason or means of the trade thereof
being diverted therefrom than they respectively were before the
passing of this Act, or any owners or occupiers of the same lee-al
quays and sufferance wharfs, warehouses, docks, and other tene-
ments and hereditaments, or any tackle, house-porters ticket
porters, or free carmen of the Citl of London, oroTh person o
persons interested m or employed ?p?n the thereof
respectively, shall by reason of any of the same works suffer loss
or damage, or the yearly or other receipts or income of the
Governors of Christ?s Hospital aforesaid/or of their successors
for or on account of car-rooms, shall, by reason of any of the
same works happen to be lessened or diminished, the said
commissioners to be appointed as hereinafter is mentioned
or managing the business of the compensations authorised
fnbp r mT d i/ 6 m f ade them > do and shall make, or cause
to be made, such just and liberal compensation or satisfaction, by
purchase, or by employment, or otherwise, to the owners and
occupiers of and the tackle, house, porters, ticket porters, free
carmen, and other persons interested in or employed upoi the
same legal quays and sufferance wharves, warehouses, docks and
other tenements and hereditaments, so rendered less valuable
respectively and to the Governors of Christ?s Hospital aforesaid
or their successors, for the injury, loss, damage, which such
owners, occupiers, porters carmen, and other persons and
Governors respectively shall have thereby suffered or sustained,
as shall be agreed on between the said Commissioners and such
respective owners, occupiers, and other persons interested or
employed as aforesaid, or between the said Commissioners and
Governors so far as relates to the said car-rooms.? So that
they appear in that provision for compensation really to have
taken into consideration every possible person that could be
injured by the works.
Mr. Anderson ; How were the Commissioners to get the funds ?
Chairman: I think that is immaterial, because the Govern-

Sir i bnt 1 beliere lam ��>wt in saying
that the Crown did pay the compensation, and did not impose
it upon the Company in that instance.
Gentlemen, I think I have now laid before you the case of the
Petitioners as it stands, and I might almost conclude as I began
y saying that it is a case in which we submit our claim


as one which you may fairly recommend to Parliament as
just, but not as insisting that if Parliament think that the
public benefit requires the sacrifice of the individual interest,
the individual interest should not succumb. We all know the
maxim which is familiar to me as a lawyer, and familiar to the
Committee, as a maxim of political economy, that solus populi
supremo lex , and in olden times that maxim was carried out very
strictly, that the public good over-rides the good of the
individual, and if it is necessary, the individual must suffer.
The State where that maxim first prevailed carried it out to the
strictest extent; for in former days when the Romans resumed
the public lands upon which the people had improperly squatted,
and been allowed to squat for a great length of time, those
lands were resumed without any compensation to individuals,
and the resumption produced the great agrarian outrages which
are matter of history. But it has never been the custom of the
English?and, I think, the same principle is admitted here?it
has never been the custom in England to carry out that maxim
to that extent. It has always been acknowledged and admitted
as the maxim that must ultimately govern; but, at the same
time, if private individuals can be saved from harm, it has
always been the disposition of the Legislature to save them, and
afford them either compensation, or to give such other redress,
or so to shape their actions that as little injury as possible should
be done while acting for the public good. And it is upon these
grounds that I come before you now. It may be said that we
are late, and if it were wished to treat us technically it might
be urged that this particular Act which has now been passed
does not, in point of fact, inflict upon us any greater injury
than we have sustained before?that we have been wronged
already, and that we are coming now before the Committee to
urge claims in consequence of injuries inflicted upon us before
the Act which is under consideration. But to that I have
one answer, and that is that this is our opportunity ?our oppor-
tunity of urging our claims upon the House ?claims never
abandoned, and which have been urged before. The passing of a
Wharfage Bill affords us a convenient and fair opportunity, even
if we suffer nothing by this Bill, of bringing forward again
those claims that we say have never died away. It is open to this
Committee to report upon those claims, and it is open to them,
I apprehend, to state to the House that those claims have
existed for a long time, and it is but justice that they should
now be taken into consideration. As 1 come before, you, there-
fore, gentlemen, it matters not whether this is an old or a new
claim, or whether the Bill under discussion has caused the
injury out of which the claim arises, or whether that injury was
inflicted before, but it is just the moment when we ought to


bring- it under notice, it is just the moment when the subject
can be taken into fair consideration?it is a convenient oppor-
tunity, and of that opportunity we avail ourselves.
At the same time, gentlemen, I do not think it can be said
that this Act may not prejudicially affect the owners of private
wharves. And if the Committee are not disposed to accede to
the view in which I have presented the claims of my client
before they might be induced to make a report to the effect that,
in case the Wharfage Rate, which is to be levied at all wharves,
even at the wharves of private owners, supposing they are not
purchased by the Government, that in case that Wharfage
Rate should be subsequently appropriated to improving the
public wharves, the claims of the private owners should be open
to consideration then. It is very true that this Act contains no
clause of appropriation, though it is equally notorious and a
matter of common sense to suppose, even if there were no noto-
riety in the matter, that the Wharfage Rates should he applied
to the repair and extension of wharves. It is a consequence
devoutly to be hoped and wished for, and as to the propriety of
which most persons will be agreed.
Mr. Anderson: Only a portion of the wharfage rates will be
so applied.
Mr. Holroyd: Then some portion of the rates will be devoted
to the extension of these wharves. No doubt it is a tax upon
the. importation of goods, and no doubt the consumer pays it;
but still the fact remains, that if that money is employed, or any
portion of that money is ultimately employed in the construction
of public wharves, that does do an injury to the owners of private
wharves. I think it is impossible to deny that, and if the Commit-
tee should not think that we are entitled to relief on other grounds
then I would submit that it is fairly open to them to make that
a part of their report, and say, that in the event of such appro-
priation being made, an injustice will be done to my clients. And
the Committee will remember that we cannot possibly be heard
against an appropriation. Now is our time or never. We have
no chance of being heard against an appropriation. We can be
heard here upon this Act, or upon matters with which this Act
is necessarily connected, but we have no chance of being heard
against an appropriation; and if we neglected this opportunity,
I think we might fairly be accused of negligence and laches in
presenting our claims.
And it may be, too, gentlemen, that the actual levying of rates
does inflict more hardship upon the owners of private wharves,
even although no part of the money is employed in the mainte-
nance of public wharves. If things were left as they were, and
neither the Government nor private owners could levy any rate,
and I may observe, that I shall have to bring before the Com-


mittee a letter, dated in 1852, by which Mr. Cole was informed,,
and the same observation would apply to Raleigh?s Wharf, that
he could not legally levy any sum of money at all upon goods
landed at his wharf?not only that there were to be no rates
charged on any wharves, and therefore, that he could not levy
rates as he did before, but that he could not charge anything?
that rates having been abolished nothing could be charged on
goods landed ?that was the intimation which he received from
the Government.
Mr Anderson : The Committee have that letter, and we have
Mr. Cole?s answer, and the fact that he utterly disregarded what
was a perfectly illegal notice.
Mr. Holroyd: I was not aware, Sir, that that was before the
Committee. Now, supposing that a portion of the money
is appropriated to the construction and maintenance of Govern-
ment wharves, there may be an injury to the private proprietor.
Where no rate is levied, if he chooses to charge a sum for the
use of his wharf while Government charge nothing, it is obvious
that the Government wharf, as the fact is now at this present
day, is preferred. Of that there is no question. But, at the same
time, supposing that he chooses to turn his Wharf to some
other purpose, to employ it for some other use. Suppose he
chooses to become an importer, and land goods at his own
Wharf, then his Wharf becomes a great convenience to him,
and there is one mode by which he can employ his Wharf. He
has got it; it is already erected; circumstances have happened
by which, by the act of the Government of the Colony, the
profit which he was led to expect he would continue to derive
from that Wharf, the Rates which were to be his reward for the
expenditure incurred, are cut off from him. He then says ?? I
have this Wharf, that has cost me so much money, upon my
hands. I will turn importer. I will land my goods at my own
Wharf, and make use of it, and I shall not be obliged to go to
the Government Wharves.? It is very much better for this
gentleman in that case that matters should remain as they are,
and that no rate should be levied. If they levy a rate at his
Wharf, they are in fact preventing him from using it to the
same advantage if he turns his Wharf to another purpose, as,
for example, to a purpose of the -kind I have pointed out. It
would also be better for him that things should remain as they
were, because if no rates are levied, it may turn out difficult for
the Government to maintain that competition which they now
maintain against these private wharves. It is highly probable
that the funds now applied to the Government Wharves may
fail, and it is said they will not apply more funds to the
extension of these wharves. But suppose this wharfage rate is
levied, and the Government get funds by which it is put into


their power at any time to increase the competition against the
owners of private wharves. That is a grievance which does give
power to crush the owners of private wharves, and therefore it
is better as matter of fact that things should remain as they
were before the present Act was passed, and the owners of
private wharves would in that case be in a better position than
they are now, after the passing of that Act.
Gentlemen, I have said nothing yet as to the value of these
particular properties, and I should be glad to add a few words
as to that:?Now, if the Government think of buying these
wharves, the value is to be determined under the Crown grant
by arbitration; but it has been suggested that if that course is
adopted these wharves having been for some time past exposed
to the competition of the Government, have been rendered com-
paratively valueless for the purpose for which they were intended,
and, therefore, the sum to be paid for their purchase would be
extremely small. But that is not quite the correct view of the
case, and for this reason. The value of the wharf for the
purpose for which it was originally designed is undoubtedly
excessively depreciated. Ido not, however, think we ought to
suffer from that, considering by what means that depreciation
has been effected?that it has been depreciated by the act of
the very parties who have had it in their power to purchase at
any moment, and that of itself is a very material point in the
discussion of this case. The parties having the power to resume
this land when they choose, on giving three months? notice,
presuming that the land is to be devoted to the construction
of wharves, that there are rates in existence, and a sufferance is
to be granted to the owner of this land to enable him to receive
these rates, gradually reduce them and bring them down to
nothing, so that the very parties who have it in their power to
purchase the property leave it in their power to reduce the
value of the property to nothing. The obvious unfairness of
that strikes one in a moment. But it so happens in this
particular case that the evil is in some degree obviated;
because, though for no purpose so valuable as it was formerly,
still it has a very considerable value, for it might be devoted
to other purposes, and an arbitrator, in valuing* the property,
would take those other purposes into consideration. Undoubtedly
the value of the river frontage must be very great at all times;
although it is lying perfectly idle, there is a prospective value in
it, and the time undoubtedly will come, if Victoria continues to
prosper as she has hitherto done, or even proceeds in the ordinary
jog-trot of the olden nations, the time will come when that land
must become of very great value; and that time is not far to
look forward to. The ground may be devoted to a vast variety
of other purposes besides that of a wharf; it may be


converted to the purpose of a manufactory ; it may be used for
foundries; and negotiations for that purpose have been going-
on years ago. Moreover, ships have been built alongside that
wharf, and that may he done again; and the possession of the
wharf enables a person to employ his lighters and steamers,
and there are many other sources of income and revenue besides
the actual amount?of the Wharfage Rates. Moreover, the value
to the Government is a thing which would be considered by the
arbitrators. When they come to a question of arbitration the
value depends upon the worth the two sides put upon it. The
arbitrators would consider, just as in the valuation of land
wanted by a Railway Company, the worth of the land to the
person that had got it as well as the worth of the land to the
person who desired to get it, and they would put those two
things together.
Mr. Anderson: The one is a compulsory sale, and the other
is not.
Mr. Holroyd: Undoubtedly, sir, but I am now looking upon
the sale almost as in effect compulsory, because the moment the
Government admit the principle that it is right to buy, that is
a thing independent of the price. If the Committee could re-
commend the purchase to the Legislature.
Mr. Anderson: If you do not frighten us too much.
Mr. Holroyd: I show that I have sufficient confidence in the
Committee, not to be afraid to discuss the whole of the circum-
stances and the views we entertain in this case, because I think
the case is one independent of value. Cases might, of course,
occur in which the value would be so enormous that the country
could not afford to pay it, and then necessity would compel them
to postpone the purchase; but the justice or not of the claim is
independent of the actual value which will have to be paid. I
have spoken of the value to Mr. Cole. I will now speak of the
value to the Government in the advantage which they will
derive from the purchase of this property. Taking the line of
the river bank, there is first Cole?s Wharf, then Raleigh s Wharf,
then Hughes? Wharf, and then the Dock, which lies pretty
much about the centre of those three, then there comes the
Australian Wharf below that; and by the purchase of these
private wharves the Government would obtain an uninterrupted
line of communication from the Gas Works to the Railway;
and it is obvious that the whole being collected into one hand,
the value would be enormously increased. The Government
could lay out the land then exactly as they pleased; instead of
having half a dozen small wharves, they could make one great
one connected in all its parts. We all know that they have now
one part of the establishment here and another part there. In-
stead of that, the facilities for construction and arrangement are


enormously increased by having- the whole connected tog-ether.
And also the profits to be derived increase in proportion. If
there is no other place to g-o to, of course while the Government
are the owners of these wharves everything must come to them.
It might be that in self-defence, the owners of private wharves,
with the hope of getting some other advantages, would endea-
vour to attract, by all sorts of devices, in order to get the
shipping away from the wharves in the possession of the Govern-
ment, and that might be prevented by the Government getting
the whole into their own hands. For instance, the Government
might draw traffic for the Government railways, a portion of
which might be diverted through the private wharves. We cannot
say what would happen in the future if the ships were to go to
other wharves than Government wharves, and having the
whole frontage, the Government could do what they pleased
with it A time will no doubt come when it will be very de-
sirable and convenient to the Government to lease these wharves,
just as it may be desirable and convenient for the Government to
lease the railways ; and if that time does come, it will give the
Government a very great advantage to be the possessors then of
the whole of the river frontage?an enormous advantage, be-
cause directly it passes into the hands of a private company,
those advantages which I have spoken of before are increased
tenfold, with respect to having the whole of the business in their
own hands. If there were two or three rival companies, the
price which would be given would, I daresay, be very different.
If the wharves were let in different portions, the price which
would be paid by two or three rival companies or firms would
be very different from that which one could afford to give.
Now, if the Government have the whole, they can let it in half,
or get just enough competition to get an advantageous price
for themselves, or, if they can get an advantageous offer for
the whole, they can let the whole; or, they can adapt them-
selves, in point of fact, to the market, and I think it is obvious,
therefore, that very great advantages would result from their
having the whole line of Wharfage accommodation in their
hands.
Gentlemen, ?Before I conclude, I wish just to notice to the
Committee a small calculation which has been made as to
what the Government might realise, supposing they were to
think fit to purchase Cole?s and Raleigh?s Wharves. Just
for the purpose of taking a sum, supposing- the Government
expended in the purchase of these Wharves the sum of
�50,000, that would represent, even at 8 per cent., which
is a high rate, �4,000 a year, or �3,000 a year at 6 per
cent. If two vessels of 100 tons each were to discharge there
daily, the income, at 3s. a ton, would be about �IO,BOO


h year, and I do not think that is a high estimate to put
Et Mr. Holroyd: No, sir; that does not necessarily follow. If so,
then the Committee are giving- me a very strong case, because
they are showing what immense injury this must do to the owners
of private wharves. Here are these unhappy owners of private
wharves the Government, as the hon. Chairman now suggests,
use our wharf, get�lo,Boo a year from it, and we get nothing, and
they do not pay us anything for it. When I make this calculation,
I make it in the view that the private Wharfinger would still he
able to continue to exist with the Bill passed into law; but if it
is to be assumed that the Government gets everything, and he
gets nothing, my case then becomes Very strong indeed, and it
shows this clearly, that we have been very deeply injured by
some mejins or other, but that we are about to be more deeply
injured still.
Gentlemen, I need not trouble you with any further remarks. 1
wished just to mention that compensation to the Committee, ana
having done so, I will now leave the subject with them.
