Moresby?s Discoveries in Eastern New Guinea.
Y. ?Discoveries in Eastern New Guinea, hy Captain Moresby and
the Officers of H.M.S. Basilisk. By Captain J. Moresby, r.n.
[. Read , February 22nd, 1875.]
In November, 1873, a Paper of mine, giving a brief outline of
H.M.S. Basilisk's work in New Guinea, was read before yon by
your esteemed Secretary, Mr. Markham.* Since then I was sent
in command of an expedition to substantiate and follow up that
work; and this Paper will give you, I trust, a summary of the
results accumulated during these two cruises.
I confess I am amazed to think that the very outline of the
third largest island in the world should have been unknown till
now, and the navigation between its north-east coast and
Australia invested with such imaginary dangers as to prevent
communication between these shores.
I will first now endeavour to show you what I have accom-
plished, in conjunction with my able assistants, Lieutenant L.
Dawson, Admiralty Surveyor, Lieutenant Sydney Smith, Navi-
gating-Lieutenant Mourilyan, and the other officers of the ship ;
and secondly, give you 'the information we have been able to
gather concerning the natives.
In brief, then, we have proved that East New Guinea ends
not in a wedge, as hitherto imagined, but in a huge fork, the
lower prong of which is cut up into an archipelago of islands.
Between these new islands and the peninsula which forms the
northern prong a sheet of water lies, about 45 miles deep and
12 to 18 in breadth, named by me Milne Bay.
This new archipelago consists of about sixty islands, large and
small. Of these the largest, Moresby Island, is about 36 miles
in circumference ; Basilisk Island nearly as large ; Hayter and
Heath Islands somewhat smaller; many of the remainder being
from 4 to 12 miles in circumference, and inhabited. These
islands are mostly lofty and volcanic, and richly wooded.
Moresby Island, a fair type of the rest, rises boldly from the
sea to a height of 1600 feet, rich in fruit-bearing and timber-
trees, whose dark tropic green is relieved by the various earth-
tints of the cultivated and terraced land, and the lighter greens
of yam and taro. Here and there the eye rests on great grassy
slopes that look like English meadows ready for the scythe;
but a giant scythe, indeed, would be needed to cut them, for
this grass is 12 feet high. We found it very difficult to make
our way through to reach a good look-out from above, and the
only plan that succeeded was for the leading man of the party
to throw himself bodily forward and press the grass down with

bis dead weight. We relieved each other frequently at this
duty, but still found it exhausting and most unpleasant, as we
bled all over from the sharp grass. On the shore are scattered
the most singular dome-shaped grassy hillocks, which made for
us natural surveying stations. At the water-line the shore is
broken into fine deep-water bays, some five of which are good
harbours. Villages cluster to the edge of the calm waters, and
here and there a coral-reef runs out, from which the dusky
fishers ply their task.
I would I had the power to tell you of the glorious panorama
which greeted us from the top of Glenton Island, the summit of
which we had cleared with immense labour from its giant
forest-trees, that the tiny theodolite might sweep an horizon
never before gazed on by our race. Six hundred feet below us,,
almost as the plumb drops, the light waves curled on a snowy
coral-beach. To the west the wooded peaks of Moresby Island
closed the view; but on every other side island after island floated
on the bosom of an intense blue sea, some volcanic, lofty, and
rugged, others coralline, low, white, and covered with graceful
trees, with every variety of form and tint, of light and shadow,
in the nearest ones, whilst those beyond faded out as they dis-
tanced into dim shapes, faint clouds ?very dreams of islands?
giving one a sense of the profusion of creative power that was
almost overwhelming.
The BasilisJc has had the honour of fixing the position and
laying down the coast-line of the D?Entrecasteaux group.
These islands were seen from a distance by D?Entrecasteaux
94 ago, as he sailed in search of La Perouse; but he
never visited them, and he saw them on the east side only.
We have proved them to consist principally of three large
islands, separated by narrow straits from each other and the
mainland of New Guinea ; and as their first surveyor and visitor,
I have taken leave to name the islands Normanby, Eergusson,
and Goodenough; and called the straits Ward Hunt, Goschen,
DaAvson, and Moresby. These islands extend north and south
about 90 miles, and afford harbours and anchorages.
With?,your permission, I will give you a slight account of
this survey. Lieutenant Mourilyan and I, with an engineer
and seven men, started on March 7th in our steam-pinnace,
with a whale-boat in tow, loaded with fuel and provisions for a
week. We left the ship in Dawson Straits, and steaming to the
westward we passed close under the high volcanic mountains of
Eergusson Island which bound the strait to the north. The
shore that we coasted was dotted with villages high on the hills,
peeping through the sombre tropical green. We could see that
our appearance caused great excitement amongst the natives.


who must have thought us gods moving rapidly on the water
without exerting an effort. They raced for miles along the
beach inviting us to land (but we could not accept their invita-
tation), shouting their cry of surprise, ? Hos-ee! hoo-ee! ?
Turning the western point of Fergusson Island, we found our-
selves at the entrance of a fine strait separating Fergusson
from Goodenough Island. Both these islands, with their forests
topped by bare grey peaks, are grandly picturesque objects,
Mount Goodenough rising magnificently to a height of nearly
8000 feet. The sides of this great mountain are cultivated in
patches to a height of about 2000 feet; gradually its woods
give place to barrenness, and its summits stand bare and
knife-edged against the sky. Mountain torrents dash down its
ravines and flash out at times from their dark-green setting,
like molten silver.
Night now closing, we sought to anchor between a small islet
and the shore; our draught of water was but 12 or 14 inches,
and yet we could obtain no anchorage; the channel was full of
mushroom-coral, which rose like great pillars from a depth of
20 to 30 fathoms to within 3 or 4 inches of the surface, so close
together that after many a weary trial, off the entrance of lovely
coves and delicious-looking bays, we had to seek a precarious
anchorage in 20 fathoms? water outside these coral pillars, on
which a dangerous surf was breaking.
The natives then crowded alongside us : but we were weary
and wanted to have our evening meal in peace, to obtain which
we blew the steam-whistle, and their consternation was absurd
in the extreme; they seized their paddles and glided off into
the darkness. All night long the near village clamoured like
a frightened rookery, and our look-out men were frequently
startled during the night by natives stealing out on the reef to
within a few feet of us. At last some sleep being needful, I
caused a rifle to be fired to seaward, and this secured us some
quiet. Next day we failed for want of fuel to completely cir-
cumnavigate Goodenough Island. We landed on it and found
it the home of the megapode and a variety of exquisitely-
plumaged birds, unknown to us; also of parrots and lories.
Passing back to Fergusson Island, we landed at a large village
in Moresby Straits. Strangely enough, for we saw no such
thing elsewhere, the men hid themselves, and an old lady,
with a very pleasant face, paddled off to us in a catamaran; we
gave her strips of red cloth, and she became quite friendly.
When we landed the married women alone advanced to us, the
men appearing, but keeping back in evident timidity ; but the
presents distributed amongst the women soon brought the men
about us, all anxious to exchange their stone-axes for our rusty


iron-hoop. So entire was my confidence in the peaceable dis-
position of these people that, accompanied only by a seaman, I
visited their inland plantations, and found large enclosures well
fenced in with bamboo, producing tropical fruits, yams, sweet
potatoes, Indian corn and sugar-cane. The sago-palm grows
most abundantly here; and the natives mash the sago in im-
mense troughs, which I at first took to be worn-out canoes. We
nil enjoyed this food, and used it largely.
. The g��d feeling of these natives deserves particular men-
tion : they had never seen the BasilisJc, and knew nothing of
our possessing superior arms. We were only ten men amongst
hundreds, and they knew that we carried iron-hoop on our per-
sons, a thing of priceless value in their eyes; but not only did
they respect our position, but they helped us over obstacles,
showing us the best paths, and took care of our clothes when
we bathed in their cool streams. Here, a mile from the beach,
I saw large masses of coral-rock cropping up at perhaps 100
feet above the sea-level in close vicinity to volcanic cliffs.
There was a singular absence of coral-formation on the north
side of Fergusson Island; and the beach and bottom of the
sea, formed of black volcanic sand sloping gradually into deep
water, offered many valuable anchorages. Ho natives lived on
this part of the island, and we could not find any fish in the
bays, but a wallaby was shot near the beach. We discovered
here a number of boiling mineral-springs, strongly alkaline;
they united themselves in one large rivulet, which offered any
degree of temperature to our bathers. Other hot springs may
exist here at the bottom of the sea, which would account for
the absence of fish in the bays. In the sand and mud thrown
out by these springs we found very small specimens of rubies
and amethysts, evidently chippings from larger stones.
Our return to the ship was very arduous work; we had
heavy weather and were out of coals, but by burning wood and
greased coal-bags we succeeded in getting back.
Now, with regard to the great Louisiade reefs, I must
say a few words. Our work here has proved that these reefs,
hitherto deemed an impenetrable barrier between Australia
and North-East New Guinea, present, in reality, a wide
open gateway, through which ships may safely pass from the
one to the other, and enter on a shorter course to China.
Previous to this discovery three routes lay open between Aus-
tralia and China. Of these the shortest, or New Ireland pas-
sage, lan inside the Solomon Islands, and leaving the Louisiade
Archipelago to the west, went between New Britain and New
Ireland, and so on to China. Our new route lies to the west,
instead of the east of the Louisiade reefs, and shortens the dis-


tauce by about 300 miles, without, to my knowledge, increasing
the danger. Eventually the trade with China will be carried
on by steamers, and this, the shortest route, will doubtless be
the route. Near Teste Island the Louisiade reefs sink from the
surface to a depth of 10 or 12 fathoms, and so continue for more
than 100 miles to the west.
To the immediate west of Teste Island -ships bound by this
new route pass over this sunken barrier; and here Nature has
placed such striking landmarks that a land-fall can be un-
mistakably made. Teste Island is easily recognisable. Its
peaks rise to a height of 300 feet, and look like islands at a
distance. Four miles to its west stands Bell Rock, a great
dome-shaped mass of rock, rising perpendicularly from the sea
to a height of 500 feet, wooded over wherever a crevice affords
room for a tree ou grow, and marking well the entrance to the
new route: it may be passed by a vessel within a stone?s throw.
Thence, as the ship passes between Moresby Island and Engi-
neer?s Group, not a reef lies in the way. To the north-west of
Slade Island the passage lies between two reefs about 2 miles
apart, and a passage of 4 miles? breadth leads to the point of
exit between Cape Yentenat and a reef which I have named
Gallows Eeef. The channel here is 2 miles wide; and Gallows
Reef being awash, and marked by two tree-covered islets, affords
sailing-marks which remove all danger to the navigator.
Another useful gift which the Basilisk has been able to pre-
sent to the mariner and the merchant has been the discovery
of harbours on these once inhospitable coasts. I cannot trouble
you with a description of these many new harbours, but will
speak of a few.
1. Robert Hall Sound, South New Guinea, in lat. 8� 50's.,
long. 146� 35' e., is well marked by Yule Island at its entrance.
I have a great belief in the future of this noble sheet of water,
seen from seaward by Captain Owen Stanley?s survey, but never
entered till now, by a passage we have found off the south-east
end of Yule Island. A good, safe, clear channel leads in, and
the harbour is perfectly protected, and land-locked with deep
water, for hundreds of ships to lie safely. Its shores are low,
swampy, and mangrove-covered, and probably unhealthy; but
Yule Island, near which ships would anchor, is high and healthy
ground.' At the head of the harbour Hilda River issues, navi-
gable for steam-launches, but too rapid for row-boats to ascend,
destined in time to bear the valuable woods and many products
Avhich here await the advent of commerce downwards on its
rapid bosom.
2. Port Moresby is a safe, commodious, double haven, lying
CO miles to the east of Robert Hall Sound, at the point where


the swampy coast first gives place to coral, white sand and shells.
Truly this harbour was ? the desire of our eyesand when,
after much search in open boats, we discovered this harbour
from Jane Island, we were very joyful. Then the great anxiety
arose as to whether we could find a good entrance ; and for two
days more we sounded in our little galley and cutter, far away
from the ship, inside the great barrier-reef, to find an entrance.
Suddenly I dropped my lead 50 fathoms down, and finding no
bottom, knew that the entrance was found. Two days after we
took the ship in. The outer harbour of Port Moresby is an
extensive bay, surrounded by open, grassy, round-topped hills,
thinly timbered with the Australian gum-tree, whilst rich
tropical valleys lie between. There are several large native
villages on its shores. Jane Islet, about SMO5 M 0 feet high, lofty
and precipitous, wooded and cultivated, stands in the centre of
the outer harbour, and if fortified would render it impregnable.
The eastern waters are a mass of coral-reefs; but the western
are clear, and just the right depth?9 to 12 fathoms for
anchoring. A fine, clear passage leads to the inner, Fairfax
Harbour; and in this inner broad sheet of water, shut round
by high land, the Basilisk anchored in 5 fathoms. On its
southern side from the hill under which she lay a considerable
quantity of gold-quartz was taken, specimens of which are here
for your inspection. We were too busy surveying to prosecute
this discovery; but, as I have before stated, the aspect of the
land, and character of the masses of granite-quartz cropping up,
lead me to think that gold will be surely found there. This
port, from its healthy situation, has already been selected as the
principal station of the London Missionary Society.
3. Pitt Bay is a fine harbour, and easily entered ; it lies at
the gateway of the New Australo-Chinese route at the east end
of Moresby Island, embosomed by lofty hills. Hereafter the
power holding Pitt Bay will possess the key of the route. At
Pitt Bay we took one piece of gold-bearing quartz from the bed
of a stream, but though we searched diligently, we could not
find a second.
4. Traitors? Bay, on the north coast of Eastern New Guinea,
in lat. B�, and long. 148� e., offers shelter to ships trading on
that coast, and possesses a navigable river with a gentle current.
This river discharges itself outside the anchorage, over a bar
that proved impracticable to our boats. I regret much that I
had not time to survey this river, for it seemed to me to lead
far up into the country, and I hope some future explorer will
follow it up. It needs no words of mine to show you how im-
portant it is that this great country should be opened up by
water-communication. ? J


Running Survey of the North-East Coast. ?Oar last work was
the running survey of the unknown coast of North-East New
Guinea.
On April 27th we joyfully turned the Basilisk's head west-
ward, for every mile was now a step towards home.
The first striking difference between these northern and the
southern shores of New Guinea is that here there is no outlying
barrier-reef, and the shores, instead of shelving outwards, are
steep to. The mountains here generally run down to the sea,
then follows a shore-reef, from which the plumb-line may be
thrown into 50 fathoms of water.
The coast-line is but little broken up, and affords few harbours
and anchorages. Speaking generally, from East Cape to Cape
Cretin the coast-line may be spoken of as a series of bold head-
lands, running out 20 or 30 miles to seaward, with deep bays
between; this configuration increased our work threefold.
The great Owen Stanley Range may be said to terminate
at the head of Milne Bay, but one of its spurs, named by
me ? Stirling Range,? runs at a diminished elevation through
the narrow peninsula which terminates at East Cape. This
henceforth important promontory on the world?s map has no
great feature to attract attention. The peninsula has gra-
dually narrowed to half a mile in width. The Stirling Range
has ceased, and been succeeded by a low, undulating forest-
country, sprinkled with villages, when suddenly an abrupt
double-topped hill springs to a height of 300 feet. There is a
village at its foot, half-hidden in groves of bread-fruit and coco-
nut trees. Its summits were crowned with tropical forest when
first we saw them; but these noble trees fell to our axes, as we
made this a theodolite station. A narrow boat-channel sepa-
rates the cape from two low coral islets, and 10 miles further to
the eastward, on the opposite shores of Goschen Straits, rises the
dark, frowning mass of Mount Prevost, on Normanby Island.
This, then, is the East Cape, and real eastern terminating
point of New Guinea. From East Cape to Cape Moresby, as
the crow flies, the distance is about 130 miles, with a depth of
500 to 600 fathoms, and muddy bottom at about 2 miles from
the shore. Villages abound here; and the valleys between
the hills, and not seen from the sea, are richly cultivated.
Between Cape Ducie and Cape Frere the forest ceases, and
is succeeded by an openly wooded level plateau full of villages,
backed 2 miles inward by a range of abrupt grassy hills, bare of
wood, each defined by a belt of sharp brushwood at its base,
crowding down hill upon hill with such a curious effect as to
remind us strongly of the plate in Black?s Atlas of all the
mountains in the world. Above the height of 2000 feet the


forest springs up again, and covers still higher peaks to the
very top, to a height of 6000 or 7000 feet.
Cape Frere is a noble headland, dropping its huge buffalo-
headed mass about 2000 feet almost perpendicularly to the
deep-blue sea, and the EasilisJc looked a mere cockboat in the
huge shadow, as almost scraping her sides against the beetling
mass she stood in to seek for an anchorage in Bartle Bay!
This bay?at the head of which an extensive tract of compara-
tively low land, marked by terraced plateaus, between which a
considerable stream debouched through a dark sandy beach-
seemed to afford the certainty of a good safe anchorage for the
night; but we were doomed to disappointment?nowhere within
a cable?s length of the beach would 80-fathom line reach the
bottom. At last we let go anchor in 49 fathoms (which is
deeper than the water of the English mid-channel'), our stern
just swinging clear of the beach. The soil about Bartle Bay is
*eiy rich, and runs back in a series of clear-terraced elevations
to a lofty inland range of mountains. The river which issues
at the head of the bay has ploughed deeply through these
terraces, so that its banks are exposed for a section of from 10
to 30 feet in height; they are composed of smooth water-worn
stones, imbedded in a light gravelly soil. We searched but
could find no gold here, nor was any trace seen by us of the
precious metal on the north coast of New Guinea.
From Bartle Bay into the bight of Goodenough Bay, a
distance of some 30 miles, the bold and fertile coast runs in a
w.n.w. direction. There are some fine waterfalls at the head
of this bay, flashing down the dark-green mountain-sides, and
so much river-water is here discharged that the surface of the
sea is quite fresh. The canoes about here are smaller; and
quite a different language prevails from that at East Cape!
From the bottom of Goodenough Bay the land turns abruptly
in an e.n.e. direction, and so runs boldly out to sea for 30 miles
in a rich forest-covered promontory, which ends in grassy slopes
marking Gape Moresby, off which are small outlying islands,
surrounded by coral-reefs. From this point, looking across Ward
Hunt Straits, we could still see Mdunt Goodenough rearing its
stupendous mass.
From Cape Moresby the land trends w.n.w. for 45 miles to
the bight of Collingwood Bay, the shores of which are low and
densely wooded, and the depth of water decreased to 50 fathoms
at 2 miles from the shore. From this point the natives became
suspicious and unfriendly, and we experienced much difficulty
in communicating with them. In Collingwood Bay we cut a
large quantity of firewood from the tall, fir-like trees which
generally ornamented the points of land. The land now runs


north-east for 45 miles till it forms a noble promontory, and
terminates in Mounts Victory and Trafalgar, 3000 feet high,
and Cape Nelson ?names which I rejoiced to write for perhaps
the last time on the map of the world. The natives here fled
at our approach; and we observed that, although belonging to
the light-coloured race, they differed in appearance from the
natives of East Cape, and wore their hair in long, thin, ugly
ringlets.
Cape Ward Hunt lies 40 miles to the westward of Cape
Nelson; the deep bay between I have named 41 Dyke Acland.?
Its low wooded shores, with the formation so characteristic
of this coast, suddenly turn to the north-east and form a
bold wooded promontory. Eight miles to the westward of Cape
Ward Hunt is Traitors? Bay. Here I had occasion to fire ray
first and only shot in self-defence. Three of our officers had
strayed away from a wooding-party, when from the ship we
observed a party of 70 or 80 warriors laud from their canoes,
fully dressed in feathers and war-paint, stealing on them. Sub-
Lieutenant Shortland and I jumped into the dingy with some
spare rifles, and gained the beach just in time to put our ship-
mates on their guard and give them the rifles. Hoping to
maintain friendly relations, I advanced alone, armed with a rifle,
but holding my arms over my head, towards the bush where the
natives were lurking, quite concealed from our view. Suddenly
they sprang from the bush to the open beach, and formed in
two regular lines, 10 yards in my front: the first line armed
with spears, which they held quivering to throw, whilst they
moved with a short quick step from side to side to distract our
aim, guarding themselves with shields; the second line was armed
with clubs. For some seconds I forbore to fire, hoping still to
preserve the peace. Finding this hopeless, and that in another
second I should be the target for fifty spears, I fired with a
snap-shot at the leading savage; the bullet pierced his shield
and spun him round on his heel, but glancing off, did not
wound him. Immediately the whole body of warriors turned
in consternation at the sound of firearms, then heard by them
for the first time, and ran for the canoes. We followed till we
drove them on board, firing a few shots over their heads.
Passing Cape Ward Hunt we came upon the position assigned
in the charts to ?Riche Island,? so named after the naturalist
of D?Entrecasteaux?s expedition 94 years since. No trace of
any such island now exists. It is probable that D?Entrecas-
teaux, at a great distance, saw the high land about Cape Ward
Hunt, which would then appear as islands, and thus he noted it
on his chart.
Huon Gulf lies between Cape Ward Hunt and Cape Cretin,
YOL. XLY. M


and is the last of the great bays which distinctively mark the
north-east coast of New Guinea. Its shores are well populated,
and the natives were friendly. For the first time in New
Guinea we observed tappa-cloth used; they wore it round their
waists, and made into high conical caps, which gave them all
the appearance of Indian Parsees. Its shores are covered with
a rich vegetation ; and especially beautiful are the slopes of the
Rawlinson Range, teeming with palms and tree-ferns, and well
inhabited. From Cape Cretin to Astrolabe Gulf, a distance of
120 miles, the land trends nearly due east and west, without a
break; the coast-line is backed up by the great Finisterre
Mountains, the two highest peaks of which, standing facing each
other, I have named Mount Gladstone and Mount Disraeli.
At Astrolabe Gulf our survey terminated; but off the northern
shores of New Guinea we took a series of deep-sea soundings,
finding from 1500 to 2000 fathoms 25 miles from the shore, a
depth probably unequalled in any part of the world in such
close proximity to the land.
The Basilisk passed from Astrolabe Gulf towards Lesson
Island, an active cone-shaped volcano discharging large volumes
of steam and smoke. It is densely populated, and the cultiva-
tion at its base appears very rich. The natives, a fine-lookino-
race, crowded alongside the ship, eager to barter all they po�
sessed for scrap-iron. Their hair is worn in a preposterous
manner, confined behind in a conical case projecting 12 or 14
inches, as a horn from the back of the head. Off Garnet Island
the Basilisk passed through a large body of brackish water,
forcing itself seaward and bringing with it vast numbers of
gigantic uprooted trees. From this fact I conclude that a river
of large dimensions must exist in the neighbourhood of Cane
Della Torre.
Time will not permit me to say more. On June 2nd we
reached the Dutch Spice Island of Amboyna, having thus suc-
cessfully completed the survey of the last unknown coast of the
habitable world.
The meteorology of Eastern New Guinea appears to be dif-
ferent from that previously supposed. The north-west monsoon
blows from November till March, accompanied by occasional
westerly gales, with fine weather intervals. The south-east
monsoon, which follows, we never found to blow continuously
up to the time of our leaving the coast in May, for we expe-
rienced light variable winds and calms; whilst on the northern
shores of Eastern New Guinea the south-east monsoon appears
to be altogether arrested by the lofty Owen Stanley Range, the
summits of which, during the month of May, were observed
with heavy clouds, leading us to believe that the monsoon was


blowing strongly on the southern shores of the peninsula, whilst
we on its northern side were sailing in calm and waveless
waters.
The barometer showed little or no fluctuation, remaining
steady between 29*80� and 29*90�; the thermometer in the
shade varying from 83� to 86�. The tides varied in rise and
fall from 8 to 12 feet.
The Natives. ?Having now, as far as time would permit,
treated the geographical part of my subject, I will speak of the
native race which inhabits the newly-discovered portion of New
Guinea. You are already aware that varieties of race exist in
this great island. You know of the black Papuan who inhabits
the south coast of New Guinea, apparently from Cape Yalsch
to Cape Possession in the Gulf of Papua. A recent Italian ex-
plorer has lately informed you of the existence of a hitherto
unknown race, named Arfaks, inhabiting the mountainous parts
of north-western New Guinea ; and to these we must add the
pure Malay race, which, coming from the isles of the Malayan
Archipelago, has driven inland the aborigines of the north-west
coast, and settled in their stead, as a third type of man. This
last is, as you are. aware, a semi-civilised Mahometan race, pro-
fessing Dutch allegiance. Leaving these people, I will intro-
duce to you a fourth ?our now first visited race of Malays.
This race is distinctly Malayan; but differs from the pure
Malay, being smaller in stature, coarser in feature, thicker
lipped, with less hair on the face, being, in fact, almost beard-
less. The hair of the head is also more frizzled, though this
may result from a different dressing. These men have high
-cheek-bones like the pure Malay; their noses are inclined to be
aquiline, and sometimes very well formed ; their eyes are dark
and beautiful, with good eyebrows. Amongst them we met
many men with light hair, and what struck us as a particularly
Jewish cast of feature. They rise to a height of from 5 feet 4
to 5 feet 8 inches, are sinewy, though not muscular, slight,
graceful, and eel-like in the pliability of their bodies. This
race abuts on the black Papuan, somewhere in the vicinity of
Cape Possession; but Ido not believe that a fixed line ot de-
marcation exists, for in Robert Hall Sound both types of race
were present, and the natives varied here amongst themselves
in colour, stature, and cast of feature. A mixture of habits also
obtained at this point, which confirmed the idea of a fusion of
race here. Some chewed the betel-nut Malay-wise, whilst
others rejected it; some wore the Papuan adornment of the
great bill of the hornbeak as horns on the head. All were
destitute of the ornaments made of human bone generally worn
by our newly-found Malay race, whilst they one and all decked
m 2


themselves with flowers and berries as this race does, but the
Papuan never, to our knowledge.
1 his new race, which presents some slight varieties in itself,
appears to inhabit the whole of the eastern peninsula of New
Guinea in its northern and southern shores, from about 148� of
longitude, to East Cape, which is in 150� 53' East longitude, and
also the newly-discovered archipelago of islands adjacent. I
approached these people with caution, knowing that no seamen
had ever willingly ventured near their shores, and kept prepared
for attack; but veiled my precautions, showed no distrust, and
went freely amongst them. Had I been so unhappy as to have
needed firearms, I should have used them with full effect, be-
lieving this to be the truest mercy; fortunately these kindly
people were soon won, and greeted us everywhere with a won-
dering welcome. Nearing shore I always caused a seaman to
stand upright in the bows of the boat, with both arms extended
in sign of peace ; and we landed two or three only at first, with
no arms but the revolvers hid in our breasts, making gestures of
friendship. Soon they smiled, and made responses to our signs
diew nearer and touched our white skins, turning up our sleeves
and trousers to see if this amazing white colour held all through j
and we gave them gifts and soon got to bartering, in which they
showed great honesty. The young women, some of whom were
really pretty and graceful, were particularly curious about us;
but if we ventured to touch their dark shapely limbs, they fled
away with a start and a scream, and seldom returned. These
natives are not devoid of principle, I am sure. I once attempted
to baiter an axe with a boy for a handsome shell-necklace he
wore. He made signs that the necklace was not his, and refused
to trade; his companions urged him vehemently, even try in o* to
force it off his neck, and at last so far prevailed that he took
the axe from my hand and half-unfastened the necklace. Con-
science pricked him, and he hurriedly thrust back the axe, and
making signs that he would go and get leave from the owner to
sell it, he paddled off in spite of the jeers of his friends.
When the Basilisk first discovered Moresby Island, and cast
anchor in Hoop-Iron Bay, we could see the natives on shore
rushing frantically about: finally a fleet of canoes, containing
men only, came off and hovered about us, showing no arms, but
wearing bird-of-paradise plumes, and handsome shell-disks on
the side of the head. These disks they shifted to their hips
when once convinced of our pacific intentions. I have a heart-
felt pleasure in stating that all our subsequent intercourse with
these people was marked with good feeling and kindliness on
both sides. Their single evil propensity seems to be a love of
pilfering; and it was amusing to see their skill in hiding small


articles in the large orifice they made in the lobe of the ear, or
between the tight ligatures they wear as belts and armlets, and
their skin. They steal skilfully also. Having adroitly knocked
some nails or an instrument off the carpenter?s bench, or
secretly unscrewed a nut, they would walk over the side, con-
cealing it under the hollow of the foot. I thought it wise to
overlook these small delinquencies; but on one occasion they
went a step too far. H.M.S. Sandfly (under my orders), when
lying in Possession Bay, had sent a boat on shore with four men
for water, and the natives had stolen their water-barricoes and
boat?s crutches, and all the iron-hoop they had about them. I
directed Lieutenant Powell to lay an ambush and seize some
natives; and two were secured accordingly, after a long struggle,
in which their smooth skin and supple limbs eluded the at-
tempts of our strong seamen. They were taken on board the
Sandfly and kindly treated, but evidently expected instant death.
Their wives and friends came off weeping, and offering presents
to buy them off*. The natives deserted the ship, and kept close
to the shore in their canoes ready for flight into the bush : how-
ever, I went amongst them in a dingy, and succeeded in making
them understand that our prisoners should be liberated on the
restoration of the stolen .property. On the second day the
articles were brought back, and we released the men, to the in-
tense delight of their friends, who then sent a large hog on
board the Sandfly to show their A few days after-
wards our carpenters, working over the ships side, missed a saw,
but before we could take any step, we beheld a large canoe
coming off in which an old man stood holding up the saw, and on
reaching us he returned it, and expressed his anger at the theft.
I incline to the belief that these people have not any re-
ligious feelings. They certainly have no external form of show-
ing such, or we should have observed it; for with the same
limited opportunities of observation we distinguished many ob-
servances as distinctly religious at all the other South Sea Is-
lands visited by us. For instance, at the New Hebrides there
was an organised system of devil-worship, with duly-appointed
priests and rites : idols also were everywhere to be found. Here,
however, no idols were to be seen. Occasionally grotesque nude
figures were painted in red and white ochre on the ends of the
houses, but for ornament only. One action only seemed to have
a religious tendency, namely, their universal custom of bringing
a village dog and dashing its brains out in our presence, alter
which ceremony they showed perfect friendliness. We noticed,
also, that in every village an old woman, much bedizened with
ornaments and ropes of shell-necklaces, seemed to hold a certain
sort of authority.


They bury their dead in a respectful manner in the ground,,
and build small thatched huts over them, on which coco-nuts
were hung. These coco-nuts, hung plentifully in the villages
and even tar out on the reefs, may have been votive-offerings.
In some few cases these burial-huts are rudely carved and fenced
in with a bamboo palisade, as if the resting-places of chiefs; but
we saw no sign of chieftainship amongst the liviug.
These Malays must be considered a more civilised race than
the Papuan ; they possess the art of pottery, still unknown to
the Papuans. In every village women may be seen moulding
the clay, whilst others tend the wood-fires in which the globed
jars are baking. They are also better cooks; for they boil their
food, as well as roast and bake it like the Papuans: and I have
frequently enjoyed the vegetable porridge they make of yams,
taro, and mangrove fruit stewed in these bowls, with coco-nut
shred finely over.
As fishers they far exceed the Papuans in art: the latter fish
only with hook and line and the barbed spear, whilst our new
friends make fishing-nets of various sorts with great skill; one,
like the English seine, made with the fibre of a small nettle-like
plant; another is what I call a ? trap-net,? and consists of a netted
bag, with the mouth kept open by a bamboo-spring. It is let
down with the bait in the bottom, the mouth open. The
fisher, cm feeling a fish, pulls a string which closes the bag and
draws it up with his prey.
The Papuans have but one kind of canoe, dug out of a single
tree and balanced by heavy out-riggers; but these people have
several kinds of canoes, of which the trading-canoe is best,
having topsides laced on with split bamboo, strengthened by
strong knees inside, supporting a sort of half-deck, under which
they stow their goods. They are most ingenious basket-makers,
and make strong good-looking baskets to fit one inside the other
in a nest: they also make capital woven-bags for carrying their
property; and they make light rope and strong cord from
various vegetable fibres, that would not disgrace an English
rope-yard.
Their weapons consist of stone tomahawks, clubs, and axes,
and of spears, and heavy wooden swords and hair-slings; and
that these weapons are not very effectively used Lieutenant
Deeds, of the Basilisk, had ocular proof, as he witnessed a fight
between the Slade islanders and those of East Cape and Moresby
Island, whilst detached on a surveying cruise. The combined
warriors of East Cape and Moresby Island approached Slade
Island in some twenty canoes, containing about thirty men each,
but remained thirty yards off shore, throwing spears and sling-
ing stones at the Slade Islanders, w 7 ho waded out to meet them.


and returned the compliment. They maintained this respectful
distance for two hours, when they drew off and nobody seemed
wounded, such was their skill in dodging these missiles. VV e
rarely saw a wounded man amongst these people, and but few
enemies? skulls ornamented the outsides of their houses.
Their houses and those of the Papuans do not differ ma-
terially. They are built on poles, sometimes 12 or 14 feet from
the ground, and consist of one large tunnel-shaped room, well
thatched over. A pole, with notched steps, leads from the
ground to a small landing-place or verandah, behind which is
the small opening leading into the interior. This verandah is
the favourite lounging-place of the family; and their imp e-
ments of war, fishing, and labour, are carefully hung round on
the inside walls. . . . ,
They are rude but successful cultivators of the ground, using
stone mattocks for turning up the soil to a small depth, prepara-
tory to planting their yams and taro. Their food is very plenti-
ful, and consists of fish, yams, taro, fruits, and pork on great
occasions, with abundance of the delicious crabs which abound
here and they do not make any kind of intoxicating drink.
This?plenitude of food may have some influence in checking a
desire for cannibalism, which certainly does not prevail laigely
amongst them ; though from the fact that we saw some of them
wearing bracelets of human jawbones, and necklaces made ot
the spinal vertebrae, which had evidently been subjected to the
action of heat, coupled with some signs they made us, we sus-
pected that cannibalism was not wholly unknown to them.
These people are affectionate to their children . they make
toys especially models of canoes and small spears, to amuse
them and encourage them to have pets. > The little ones were
constantly to be seen petting little pigs with which they ran oft
at our approach, lest we should barter for them. They had also
multitudes of tame parrots, lories, cassowaries, and kept several
varieties of the marsupial cuscus in cages. In some cases the
parents were willing to barter their children for our iron axes.
They did not (like most savages) keep their wives in the
background, but allowed them to meet us freely and have a
voice in the trading. On one occasion a husband was heartily
belaboured by his wife with a paddle on the head and shoulders,
because he did not barter satisfactorily, and his friends, instead
of interfering for his relief, only shouted with merriment. He
did not retaliate, but looked foolish. Nevertheless, the lot of
the women here is to do all the heavy labour, whilst the men
fight or fish, as in all other savage communities.
The men are but slightly tattooed, but the women tattoo all
over, sometimes in graceful patterns. The men paint grotesquely

with ochres, and sometimes shave the head, and paint it, and
the whole body to match, of a shining black, with charcoal and
coco-nut oil. The women crop their hair short, the men wear
theirs long and frizzed, and all disfigure their mouths with
chewing the betel-nut, except the younger women. The men
wear a waistcloth only, the women the usual South Sea garment
the short grass petticoat or ? ti-ti.?
A New Guinea exquisite, lithe, dark, and graceful, with shell-
anklets, making his small feet seem still smaller, is not an un-
picturesque object. His waist is braced in with many turns of
black cord, the outside of which is plaited in with gold-coloured
strawy his neck is bright with a red shell-necklace, from which
a boar?s tusk depends, and from the tight ligatures and brace-
lets on his arms the graceful pandanus-leaf flows far behind
curiously embroidered. Bright red flowers and berries adorn
his hair, and his face is frequently painted red at one side and
black and white at the other. *
The only maladies we perceived amongst them were ele-
phantiasis, ulcers, leprosy, and other skin-diseases ; otherwise
they were vigorous and healthy.
In conclusion, I am anxious to take this opportunity of ex-
pressing my grateful sense of the exertions made by the officers
of H.M.S. Basilisk during both our New Guinea Surveys. Their
work was continuous, arduous, and frequently exhausting, from
circumstances of climate, exposure, deprivation of comforts, and
physical efforts of all sorts. No one thought of rest; all felt
that a really stupendous task had to be accomplished within the
limits of a comparatively short time, and laboured heartily to
achieve it. J
I think we all felt that English hands only ought to finish
the work of Cook and Dampier in this quarter of the globe, and
that it was well to establish for England a right on these shores,
knowing that such a right will become of importance in the?
u ture.
Having been long in Australia, we naturally felt a growing
interest in the future of the great Australian Colonies, and were
struck with the importance of keeping them unhampered by any
complications that might result from the establishment of foreign
settlements within so short a distance of Cape York.
To this end we desired to ascertain if harbours existed on the
coast easy of access and possessing strategic advantages. Our
secondary desire was to throw the riches of New Guinea open to
Australian effort, and so lead to the mutually helpful union
which Nature intends between the sister islands of Australia
and New Guinea. Providence has crowned our efforts with
success, and time, which tests all things, will, I know, prove our
