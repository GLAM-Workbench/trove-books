The remarkable progress of the institution always connected
with the above date is attracting very considerable attention in
the community. It shows in a marked degree the prosperity of
those who have cast their lot in this colony. It also paints in
strong color a leading characteristic of the Australian of to-day?
the strong practical common sense which at once recognised the
advantages which are the growth of Forethought. In a
country where sturdy independence is the first law of communal
existence it is not surprising that the first step towards securing
it should be so popular. To have capital?to have saved it ?
is to be independent, to be above the need of ? assistance ? and
complimentary ?favors;? to stand on firm ground from which
we can claim our dues as ?rights? and not be compelled to
accept them as concessions to be received with gratitude. The
people have become so imbued with the ? value of this self-
reliance, and are so determined to secure it, that the number of
persons who are depositors in the Melbourne Savings Bank
has increased from 14,100 in December, 1878, to 73,600 in
December, 1886, and the amount saved from to
As the young Australians number at least two-
thirds?of these depositors we have here a remarkable fact to be
recorded in their favor as against those pessimistic critics who
can only see in the coming race all the vices of their forefathers
(and a few more) without any of their virtues.
The success of this Savings Bank is due to the facilities
offered to its customers, and to the ease with whiefi their business
is despatched. Accounts may be transferred, without loss of
interest, between any of the Bank?s offices situated at Market-
street, and in the suburbs of Fitzroy, Prahran, Richmond, South
Melbourne, Carlton, Hotham, St. Kilda, East Collingwood, Port
Melbourne (Williamstown will be opened in February), these
are open for transacting all business during the usual banking
hours, and are also open on Saturday evenings for two hours?
7to 9 p.m.?for Receiving Deposits. New accounts may be
opened at the same time and sums as low as One Shilling are
received. No transaction takes more than three minutes, and
as the strictest secrecy is observed, members of one family may
have accounts about which even the other members will not
have any knowledge.

Scene ? Wood's Farm, at Dollis Hill.
Opening Chorus. Farm Servants , Sfc., Sfc. (Meyer Lutz.)
The first o� May, the first of May,
We?ll finish our work and then to play.
Oh, won?t we have a merry scene!
With the morris-dance upon the green !
So, boys and girls, be extra good,
And work for our master, Mr. Wood,
And his daughter Winifred, who is still
The pride and the beauty of Dollis Hill.
Chorus of Yokels. (R. G. Grain.)
Although we?re agriculturalists,
We?re all of us voters now ;
They tell us as how we?re bound to get
Three acres of land and a cow.
That sort of thing is very well
To read in papers and books.
They may tell that yarn to the horse marines
Tor we bean?t such fools as we looks.

Mbs. S. Morning, Sir.
Wood. Where?s Winifred ?
Mbs. s. She?ll shortly be astir.
The work is fearful on a May day morning,
I?ve more than half a mind to give you warning,
But you have been so kind to me.
Wood. How?s Jack ?
Mbs. S. I see but little of him now, alack !
Wood. Nor I. I hear a lot, though.
Mbs. S. Yes, that?s bad,
But don?t believe a word against my lad,
The stories are all lies about my child,
Spread by that thieving villain, Jonathan Wild.
Wood. But what?s his object?
Mbs. S. Object! Which it?s me.
Wood. How you?
Mrs. S. * ?Cos I refused his wife to be.
Wood. I?m glad.
Mbs. S. When I to wed make up my mind,
I?ll choose a cat of quite another kind.

Wood. If you take into your head
That you again will wed,
What sort of man for husband will you choose ?
Mbs, S. My affections I?d engage
To a man of middle age,
And about five feet eleven in his shoes.
W ood. I Avonder where on earth
One of quite sufficient worth
For such a worthy woman can be found

But believe the only way
To discover him will be by looking round.

Who looks as if made up with Eickett?s blue.

To have those rascals in the neighbourhood.
Mrs. S. Eascal yourself, you fop, I?ll tear your eyes
Knee. Oh,goodness gracious, how the womanflies out!
Win. Jack?s very likely come to see his mother.
Wood. It may be so, but how about the other?
Win, He spoons our dairymaid, Poll Stanmore.
Mrs. S. True!
That?s why of late our milk has looked so blue.
Jack may have come to see me ; I confess
He?s much more likely after Edgworth Bess.

There?s a kind of belief
I?m a rascally thief,
But I?m terribly ignorant, why ?
I?m aware that my face
Would a figure disgrace
At popular Madame Tussaud?s ;
If an innocent scamp
Ever gets on the ramp
I dog him wherever he goes.
And yet all the while
I?ve a manner and style
Which I flatter myself must please ;
The things that I say
Bring barons to bay
And duchesses down on their knees.
I was ready and smart
With my hand on my heart,
And the agony duly piled ;
In the popular craze
Of bygone days?
I?m Jonathan (Oscar) Wild.
{Chorus Repeat.)
I?m happy to say
I?ve got out of the way
The innocent workmen?s clubs ;
I?m the primary cause
Of the stringent laws
That regulate all the ? pubs. ?
Wherever a race
Is taking place,
1 shut up the outside ring ;
But whenever a swell
Has a bet ?then ?well ?
It?s a totally different thing.
If a debtor should fly
Erom a creditor, I
To arrest him am nothing loth ;
But I fancy the best
Of the game is the jest
That I?m jolly well paid by both.
An ingenuous chap,
I don?t care a rap,
For luck upon me has smiled.
Though wherever I go,
They mutter, I know,
?That terrible rascal, Wild.?

Wild. Begone, you Bounds, and keep well in the dark.
(Mendez about to speak.)
Silence ! When I speak, mind, ? let no dog bark.?
You know your orders, which, if you should shirk,
If you escape you?re lurky ; go and lurk.
(Exeunt Janissaries.)
(Thinking he is alone.) Oh, would that some-one
could relieve my doubt!
Mend. Can I do anything ?
Wild. You can. Get out!
{Kicks Mendez, who exits.)
Where is Sir Roland ? Late again, of course.
A Boland Trenchard gathers no remorse.
I?m puzzled, by one of the greatest twisters.
Sir Roland had, at one time, two fair sisters, ?
Aliva, ?now she?s dead ?Thames Darrell?s mother; ?
Jack Sheppard?s dam ?that?s Constance ?was the
other.
I want to marry her ; ?not for herself,
Not likely ; what do you think ? For her pelf.
I tried to drown her nephew Thames, who?s back,
And still I mean to hang her son, young Jack.
We?ve tracked Thames here, and here we mean to
cop him.
I?ve taken Jack up, but I mean to drop him.
Marry his mother ! Kill Sir Roland ! Then
I?ll be by far the happiest of men,
For wealth means happiness, and riches storm us,
Sir Roland Trenchard?s riches are enormous.
He doesn?t come. He?s long beyond his hour ;
He surely can?t suspect he?s in my power!
For if he doesn?t pay a mighty mite
I will denounce him as a Jacobite.
The Jacobiter bit. Oh, how I?ll grind him!
Where is he, though ? Yes ; I must go and find him.
{Exit Jonathan Wild.)
{Enter Jack Sheppard.)
Jack. I?m back ayain ; my footsteps I retrace,
Welcomed, and welcoming the dear old place.
Song ?{Words by E. B. Mnnninq. Music by
F. Stanislaus.)
My name?s Jack Sheppard; I?m a scamp.
I?m as Avicked as I possibly can be,
I re\ r el in my crime,
And I hope in course of time
To be perfect in my \ r ill-ain-y.
I?ve tried, since the day that I was born,
To get top, crimi-nally, of the tree,

Chorus. ?? The King who's over the water."
(Hamilton Clarke.)
Lillibulero ! Lillibulero!
Since the time is growing shorter,
Lillibulero ! Lillibulero !
Por the King who?s over the water.
Lillibulero-lero-lay! Lillibulero-lero-lay!

And let them pass,
With brandy, gin and porter
Por soon they?ll bring
Us back the King,
Who?s now across the water.

Again and again

And hurrah for the Stuart blue I

hearty,
We?ll turn him up when wanted ?like ecarte.

Kings want our money ; harmony's for caves,

A high chiffonier plays the picker-low.

As you sip your glass of ? bittah,? chaff the barmaids

They?ll quite believe your wealthy if you jingle all

They?ll think you are in Parliament if you talk about

And say ?By Jove ! It?s August! I shall have to pot
the grouse!?
If cash runs short and ? uncle ? says, ? No, not to-day

You can make a tasty dinner off a penny saveloy ;
When no one?s looking, find a court, pop in and bolt

Bir E. A safe one; are you sure?

Sir E. Thanks. I feel better.

It?s very dreadful ven vun is so bad.

W ild. (to Sir Eoland) I?ve something here !
It?s not a writ, ?pon honour.
Sir E. What is it then ?
Wild. Listen, it?s to my donna,
Jack Sheppard?s mother, and your only sister.
Sir E. A blasting truth that burns me like a blister.
(Wild reads letter, after which Sir E. exits.)
Wild. Ah, me! Ido beguile the thing I am ?
My virtue?s vicious, and my shame a sham,
But still I must confess that love, sweet love,
Has made me gentle as a sucking dove.
Song :
Altho? I act in villain fashion,
Doing all sorts of crimes with zest;
Oh, think not that the tender passion
Isa stranger to my breast!
Although my manner oft morose is,
And tho? I long much worse to be;
Still I take in equal doses
Cupid?also cupid-i-tee
O, love, thou art divine,
Yo power so pure as thine ;
My bad, black heart, love, thou dost illume-lume-lume.
O, love, thou art sublime,
Almost as sweet as crime,
And tho? I thirst for gore, my heart for thee has room.
How sweet to see at the old Bailey,
Thieves whom I have taught to thieve ;
Ah ! ?tis then I warble gaily
Loving lays at dewy eve.
Oh, what joy a church to plunder,
And be with murderers hand and glove !
But what were all this, I wonder bliss,
Without the sweet, refining pow?r of love.
O love, thou art divine, &c., &c. (Exit Wild.)
(Enter Thames Darrell.)
Thames. This afternoon, while I was still in bed,

There came this telegram from Winifred.
Ten words a shilling ?no name ?no address.
Can message be synonymous with mess ?
Am Iby her, then, fooled ? Perhaps lam !
No ! she?d not tell a lie by tell-a-cram.
Tell me, 0 Winnie darling, where you are.
Then take my message to her, Silver Star!
Ballad ?? Silver Star ? (Flavian Pascal .)
Silver stars above are gleaming,
Lamps of love in heaven?s fane ;
On each mortal gently beaming,
Bringing joy and easing pain.
Destiny in each is blended,
Though that fate is fixed afar ;
When at last life?s journey?s ended,
Then dies out man?s silver star.
0, silver star, shine on.
Shine on and light my way ;
Till night?s dark hour be gone
And died before the day !
O silver star, be kind,
