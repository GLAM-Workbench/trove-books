PREFACE.
In preparing this little ■work for the press, the Author
has found unspeakable consolation and support during a
season of severe and prolonged suifering. He hopes it
may prove equally useful to those into whose hands it
may chance to fall; in awakening confidence and trust in
that divine and gracious Saviour whom it aims to exalt.
Many are its defects, which the kind reader will please to
overlook; if it possess aught of merit, let God have the
praise.
For the title and arrangement of subjects, the Author
is partly indebted to “Leask’s Footsteps of Messiah;” fur-
ther than this, he is not aware that it bears the slightest
resemblance to anything that he has seen.
It is sent forth with earnest prayer for the divine bles-
ing.

FOOTPRINTS OF JESUS.
The Manger
Luke ii. 1-16.
Who is’t I see in yonder lowly shed,
In swaddling clothes, the manger for his bed?
What babe is that? no worldly pomp attends
Ills humble birth; nor power its influence lends,
Nor pride of earth I
Is it the Shiloh, promised long before,
Whom sages sang, and prophets spake of yore?
Yes, sure ’tis He; the time, the place, agree
With sacred song; ’tis surely Him I see,
The Virgin’s Son!
Hail, Holy One! thou Son of God most high,
Thine advent angels greet, and loudly cry
Glory to God in highest! hosanna to His name,
Peace on earth; and thus to men proclaim
The Saviour’s birth.
Hail, long-expected Prince of Truth and Peace,
The time has come thy people to release
From bondage sore, from Satan’s galling chains;
To every land thy presence now proclaims
Salvation!
Now we may dry our tears, and gladly string
Our harps to praise Emmanuel our King;
Anna may now her anxious watchings cease,
And aged Simeon too, may die in peace,
Their hope is come.
x


The Sages.
Matt. ii. 1-11.
What men are these come travelling from afar,
To Bethlehem guided by yon brilliant star?
Earnest, devout they seem, and fix’d upon
The object of their bent.
What is’t they seek with such assiduous care?
What new-found science urges them so far
Away from home; what treasure seek they
With such fix’d intent?
Laden with wealth they come, and incense rare,
With spice and myrrh, and costly presents, far
More precious than earth’s diadems,
They hither bring.
Urged by a voice divine, and sentient strong,
Their steps with anxious care they wend along
To Judah’s favour’d land, to greet
The new-born King.
With awe profound, and rev’rence deep they bow,
Their homage yield, and pay the solemn vow
To Israel’s great High Priest, who comes
Peace to proclaim.
With holy joy our spirits too may rise,
Our fears we ’ll scatter, dry our weeping eyes;
Whilst trusting in his gracious sacrifice
New hope we gain.
The Flight
Matt. ii. 12-18.
Through Bethlehem and all the regions by,
The voice of woe is heard; the bitter cry
Of mothers weeping o’er their children slain,
Through Herod’s rage, the Infant to obtain.


Deep lamentations wail throughout the land,
And bitter cries are heard on every hand;
Whilst wicked men urged on by hellish strife,
Madly attempt to take the young child’s life.
Vain man! and impotent as vain,
Think’st thou to stop the true Messiah’s reign?
Thy deep laid stratagems tho’ dyed in gore,
Shall all be baffled, and shall fail before
The Lord’s Anointed.
A greater than Herod sits enthroned on high,
lie reigns supreme o’er all the earth and sky j
lie has decreed; for Him to say, ’tis done,
“On Zion’s holy hill I’ll set my Son.”
Warned by a midnight vision, Joseph takes
The Babe, its Virgin Mother, and forsakes
His native land; in foreign climes to wait,
And seek a refuge from the Tyrant’s hate.
Thus is accomplished God’s most high decree,
“Erom Egypt have I called my Son,” and Ho
Shall triumph o’er the rage of earth and hell,
His life prolong, and faithfully fulfil
His holy mission.
Thus too, the wily one has over tried,
To thwart God’s purposes of mercy wide;
By secret arts, and opposition bold,
To crush the church, and man in bondage hold.
But weak and vain his efforts all have proved,
To stop the reign of truth, and quench the flood
Of light and holiness, that streams afar
O’er nations wrapp’d in gloom and guilt before.
Then courage take, ye weak and fearful ones,
Nor e’er forsake the cause of Zion’s sons,
The Saviour reigns; fear not, you soon shall see
The nations of the earth come crowding round,
To bend the knee.


The Temple.
Luke ii. 42—49.
Around the Jewish Doctors ranged I see
A chosen band of youths; I mark
Their serious mien, and deep solemnity,
Intent upon the object near their heart.
One there is more serious than the rest,
With bright intelligence and mind so pure;
Deep felt emotion moves his gentle breast,
Whilst listening to the words of sacred lore.
The doctors well may stand amazed, and gaze
With wonder and surprise, at one so young,
So meek and gentle, yet so truly wise.
Beyond the race of Zion’s youthful sons.
Whence comes He? and by whom was He instructed?
What anxious care has nursed His tender years?
Who hath such pure and holy truth inducted?
Can any tell who ’tis that thus appears?
’Tis He! the sinless One from Naz’reth come,
With Mary and her kinsfolk, to attend
The yearly feast in Salem’s hallow’d dome,
The appointed days in pure devotion spend.
’Tis He! who thus in early life declares
The fix’d and holy purpose of His will;
His deep resolve through all His following years,
To keep His vow, and do His Father’s will.
Bless’d Touth 1 Thy early days I love to mark,
And trace thy steps, so pure and free from sin;
Thy cloudless intellect, thy spotless heart,
That mark the pure divinity within.


Jordan.
Matt. 3.
Deep flows the murm’ring stream,
O’er Jordan’s rocky bed;
Thy banks are clothed in green,
With orient bloom o’erspread.
Whence thy celebrity ?
What magic charm is found
Connected with thy history,
To raise such awe profound?
No fleets thy bosom plough,
Nor merchants enterprise;
Nor sanguine conflicts stain; then how.
Whence does thy fame arise?
What is’t awakes such interest keen.
To fix my thoughts on Jordan’s stream?
In sacred writ, thy name
In prominence appears;
And spreads abroad thy fame.
To all succeeding years.
’T was here that Israel came,
To close their weary march;
The promis’d land to claim.
And build the ancient church.
When at thy brink they stood,
By great Jehovah led;
He stay’d thy mighty flood,
Laid bare thy rugged bed:
Sale o’er thy banks the armies pass’d
And entered on the promised rest.
Here too, Elijah stood,
The prophet bold and true;
He clave thy rolling flood,
And formed a passage through.
Ilia arduous work now closed,
He dropp’d his sacred vest;
In flaming chariot rose,
9
FOOTPRINTS OF JBSUS.


And enter’d on his rest:
The battle o’er, his mantle fell
On one prepared to wear it well.
Hither the Syrian came
And bow’d his lep’rous head
Seven times beneath thy stream,
And forthwith healed he sped.
Thy wonders sages sang,
’Rapt in prophetic fire;
And oft, to heal a pang,
King David tuned his lyre.
Such hope, thy far famed-name imparts
To nerve our zeal, and cheer our hearts.
Here too, in later days,
John Baptist stood and cried,
“ Make now your hearts, your ways
From evil turn aside.”
Around his standard flock’d
Thousands from far and near;
The Jewish nation rock’d
With strong convulsive fear.
“ Repent,” the Prophet cried,
God’s Kingdom is at hand;
The sound reach’d far and wide,
And echo’d through the strand:
Make straight His ways, the land prepare,
Messiah’s glorious reign to share.
I see Him now draw nigh;
His calm and holy mien,
Bespeak the majesty,
That reigns supreme within.
The Baptist wond’ring stands,
Warned by a vision bright;
The opening heaven expands,
And pours a flood of light
On Him who now stands forth reveal’d
And to this rite prepares to yield.
O! Son of God most high,
Why comest thou to me P


Far greater need have I
To be baptized of Thee.
Suffer it to be so now,
The Son of God replies;
’Tis meet that I should bow
To rites so true and wise:
. ’Tis thus I consecrate
Myself; and thus declare.
My claim to the Messiahship,
And enter on it here.
Your work now closes, mine begins
To save from sorrows, and from sins,
lie speaks; and from above,
In bright and holy flame;
The Spirit like a dove.
Descends to seal His claim.
The Father too, attests,
In accents clear and strong,
To all the assembl’d hosts,
The mission of His Son.
Behold the Righteous One,
Whom long your hope has rais’d;
“’Tis my beloved Son,”
“ In whom I am well pleas’d.”
Thus Father, Son, and Spirit, all
Combine to save from Satan’s thrall.
The Temptation.
Matt. iv. 1—11.
A dreary wilderness and desert wild.
Of Nature’s varied loveliness despoiled;
Stretch’d out I seel in barrenness and woe,
A fitting emblem of the world below.
Deep gloom and dread
The land o’erspread.


Hither the Saviour came from Jordan’s stream,
Led by the Spirit to this dreary scene;
That here, hy conflict dire, lie might commence
The fearful strife; and drive the Tempter hence.
In this dark hour,
To brave his power.
In fasting and in prayer His spirit bent,
Full forty days and forty nights he spent;
Then wearied nature, hitherto sustained
By power divine; —sank down exhausted.
In tills extreme,
The Tempter came.
With artful skill, he tempts Him to distrust
His Father’s will, and watchful providence;
T’ exert uncall’d His own creative power,
To meet his wants in this most trying hour.
If that thou be indeed, as thou hast said,
The Son of God, transform these stones to bread;
Why pine with hunger, why sink down and die,
When by a word, thou canst thy wants supply.
Then speak the word,
And help afford.
The Saviour firm replies to this suggest,
’Tis not for me to cross God’s high behest;
To doubt His tender care, His watchful power
To save me in this dark and trying hour.
Thus it is written in the sacred law,
’Tis not from bread alone, that men shall draw
Their life, or strength; but from the living word
That stands recorded in the law of God.
Then hence begone,
Deceitful one!
Foiled in his first device His faith to shake,
Forthwith a second tries, with skill and hate;
Now to presume, he seeks to lead Him on,
Some wond’rous feat t’ achieve before the throng.
To fix their gaze,
And wonder raise.


Led by mysterious influence, Jesus bends
His steps to Zion’s city; and ascends
The lofty turrets of the Temple; whence
He sees the crowd of worshippers advance.
“If thou be the Son of God” in truth,
Now prove thy claims, assert thy right, stand forth.
Cast thyself down from hence, and trust in God
To keep thy feet; as promis’d in his word.
The people then
Will own thy claim.
To this suggestion of the Prince of lies,
Urged with such seeming truth, and fair disguise,
The Saviour turns with indignation bold,
“Thou shall not vainly tempt the Lord thy God.”
But all thy ways
To Him commit.
Nothing dismay’d, the Tempter still pursues
His dark designs; and still attempts to use
His subtle influence o’er the Saviour’s will,
And in His mind ambition to instil.
Forth to some lofty mountain’s cloud-capp’d brow,
He leads the meek and lowly One, —and now
Points out to view the wealth that earth affords,
And seeks to lure Him by its glittering hoards.
Its gaudy toys
And sensual joys.
The land of Gilead, Naphtali, and Dan,
Ephraim, Manasseh, and the stately palm
That borders Jericho; —and far away
The neighbouring provinces and kingdoms lie;
Mountains and valleys, lakes and rivers, here
In most enchanting loveliness appear;
To tempt the Saviour’s righteous soul astray,
And lead Him thus His mission to betray.
Their treasures all are mine the Tempter cries,
I’m rightful Prince of all beneath the skies;
They ’re mine, and shall be thine if thou wilt bow,
And homage render at my footstool now.
Thou shall be heir
Of all I bear.


With holy indignation Jesus turns
Upon the base deceiver; and returns
The foul proposal with triumphant scorn,
And claims the crown of conquest as His own.
•‘Get thee behind me Satan,” He replies,
Nor longer tempt me with thy base disguise;
“ ’Tis written thou shalt worship God alone,”
“Him only shalt thou serve,” —then hence begone!
In deepest hell,
And darkness dwell.
High heaven approves, and brightest seraphs gaze
With wonder and delight, and deep amaze;
Heavenly consolation they impart,
To cheer and raise the Saviour’s smitten heart.
Sweet peace they bring,
To Zion’s King.
This bright example held in constant view,
Will nerve our hearts, and bring us safely through
The bitter tests, and conflicts that we meet,
And help to bruise the Tempter ’neath our feet.
Like Jesus, our resources we must draw
From God’s most sacred word, and righteous law,
He said, “ ’tis written,” and deliv’rance came,
We too, shall triumph in His holy name.
And gloomy days
Shall end in praise.
The Passover
John ii. 13—17.
A dark and dreadful night,
O’er ancient Egypt spread;
Earth trembl’d at the sight,
The tyrant shrank with dread.
A loud and piercing cry
Was echo’d through the land;


The flower of Egypt die,
Struck by a mighty hand.
In every house the first-born slain,
When the destroying angel came.
In Israel’s dwellings fair,
The people dwelt secure;
No midnight cry was there,
To break the silent hour.
Obedient to their God,
The Paschal Lamb they slew;
And sprinkled with its blood,
Their posts and lintels too.
And when the sword pass’d through the land,
God stretch’d o’er them His guardian hand.
This merciful event,
To keep in long review;
And learn its deep intent,
They, and their children too,
Were told to keep the feast,
And eat the Paschal Lamb;
To mark their great release
Prom Pharaoh’s cruel ban.
And ages yet unborn be taught,
What wonders God for Israel wrought.
In all their after years,
Their wand’rings to and fro;
Their conflicts and their fears,
Their scenes of joy and woe;
Their memory they fed,
And oft their vows renew’d,
Until by Joshua led,
On Canaan’s land they stood.
There they observ’d the sacred feast,
Prom bondage and from fear releas’d.
To keep this rite divine,
In Zion’s holy courts;
The various tribes combine,
15
FOOTPRINTS OP JESUS.


And flock from distant parts:
In union sweet they travel on,
The time beguile with cheerful song.
In great Messiah’s day
The Temple was defil’d;
By sinful practices
The people were beguil’d:
Their sacred rites they desecrate
By merchandise and worldly state.
Inspir’d by holy zeal,
The Saviour now draws nigh,
God’s purpose to reveal,
His house to purify,
And drive the sordid troop away,
In sore disgrace, and deep dismay.
Te money-changers hence!
The indignant Saviour cries,
Make not my Father’s house,
A place of merchandise.
Your worldliness and greed,
His righteous soul disdains;
This is no place for trade,
Nor sordid earthly gains:
But worship simple, bright, and pure.
He claims from all who gather here.
The great Redeemer now,
Regards with watchful care,
Those who before Him bow,
In faith and godly fear.
Still to our courts He comes,
In this bright gospel day;
Still to earth’s sensual sons,
Cries, “take these things away.”
When worldly-minded men,
With hearts and hands impure,
Defile our feasts;—again
The Saviour as of yore
• Cries, “take these things hence,” nor stain
My Father’s house with greedy gain.


When self-sufficient pride,
Stalks in with lordly mien;
To place itself beside
The humble saint; —again
He cries, “take hence these things,” nor bring
Such off’rings to the heavenly king.
When strife and wrath creep in,
God’s courts to desecrate;
And think His smiles to win,
By bitterness and hate:
“Take hence these things,” He cries! nor hope
T’ escape my wrath, nor flee its stroke.
To purge from such vile things,
The scourge is oft applied;
And by affliction’s stings,
The church is purified;
In true and holy faith,
The people then draw near;
Whilst hypocrites dismay’d
Shrink back with deadly fear.
He drives them forth in foul disgrace,
And hearts sincere supply their place.
Jacob's Well.
John iv. 1—30.
Wearied with travel, and by hunger press’d,
And conflicts fell;
Passing through Shechem’s vale, the Saviour rests
On Jacob’s well.
A sacred and a hallow’d spot it is,
To mem’ry dear;
The Patriarchs and Saints of early daj’s,
Oft rested here,
Abram and Sarai, in their early search
Por Canaan’s land;
B
17
FOOTPRINTS OP JESUS.


Here their first altar raised, and stay’d their march
At God’s command.
Jacob, deliver’d from his gloomy fear
Of threat’ning ills:
Turns gratefully aside, and resting here,
His altar builds.
When Joshua’s end drew nigh, the assembled tribes
Before him stood
On this same spot, and firmly bound themselves
To serve their God.
But He who now reclines upon its brink,
Poor and exhaust;
Once was enrich’d beyond our power to think,
Or count the cost.
He wore a starry crown surpassing bright,
In heaven above;
Clad in the robes of pure and spotless light,
And boundless love.
But now He stoops to visit this fall’n world,
With truth and grace;
The wonders of His love to us unfold,
And save our race.
Seated beside this well-spring Him I see,
In gentle form, and spotless majesty,
No form so dear;
Of all the saints and holy men of yore.
No one with heart and soul so true and pure,
E’er rested here.
His peaceful brow, calm as the summer’s eve,
Bespeaks His tender sympathy and love,
And watchful care:
His firm resolve to do His Father’s will,
Urges His footsteps with untiring zeal,
Our woes to bear.
Forth from Samaria’s rich and fertile plains,
Fast bound in guilt and superstition’s chains,
A woman comes;
18
FOOTPRINTS OF JESUS.


Thoughtless and vain, her mind on trifles bent,
Her daily course she runs without relent,
Of shameful crimes.
To her with gentle brow the Saviour turns,
Whilst deep compassion in His bosom burns;
And mercy beams;
To lead this lost one from the paths of woe,
To fountains pure, whence living waters flow
In healing streams.
In searching conversation, Jesus leads
Her mind to ponder o’er her evil deeds,
Her misspent life;
Himself reveals, His character makes known,
Messiah true, God’s well-beloved Son,
The Prince of Life.
Deeply amaz’d she stands, and contrite too,
Before the man who thus unfolds to view
Her inmost soul.
Points out the hidden springs of guilt and shame,
Her secret wickedness, and open blame;
Reveals the whole.
“Come see the man” the woman wond’ring cries.
To all her former friends; who with surprise
Attend her call:
“He told me all the things that e’er I did,”
My many crimes, and wilful trespasses;
He told me all.
“Is not this the Christ,” the Holy One,
The Prophet true, King David’s righteous Son ?
Who else but He
Could so reveal the secrets of my heart,
And lead me from my former ways to part?
Yes, sure ’tis He.
Henceforth my willing heart to Him I give,
My life to purify, my soul to save.


Acceptable Worship.
“God is a Spirit , and they that worship Him , must worship
Him in spirit and in truth”
John iv. 24.
“ God is a Spirit,” pure and bright,
Too pure for mortal gaze;
His dwelling-place is cloudless light,
Brighter than noon-day blaze.
Archangels bow, and prostrate lie,
How then shall sinful man draw nigh P
Shall mitred brows, and priestly robes,
Or votive off’rings bring,
A blessing from the bright abodes
Of heaven’s eternal King?
Shall temples rear’d by mortal hands,
Or legal rites suffice;
Or any favored spot of land,
Engross the sacrifice?
No; all these things are pass’d away,
The night is gone, and now ’tis day.
“God is a Spirit;” Ho demands
A worship true and pure;
The artful guise of earth-born sons,
His glance can ne’er endure.
He searches deep, His eye-lids try
The spirits that to Him draw nigh.
“God is a Spirit;” will you dare,
With hearts impure to face
His holy throne, and hope to share
The blessings of his grace?
Presumptuous man! the hope is vain;
He turns away with deep disdain.
“God is a Spirit;” would you find
Acceptance in His sight;
A holy calm, and peace of mind,
And hope of heaven so bright?


Would you His gracious smiles secure,
His kindest favours share.
And when the toils of life are o’er
A crown of glory wear?
Then seek a pure and holy mind.
From worldly guile and sin refined.
Jesus himself in love draws near,
He waits beside the well;
His kind and welcome voice I hear,
In peaceful accents dwell.
The Holy Spirit I will give,
The well of life; —then drink and live.
’Tis He alone can cleanse the heart,
From sin’s defiling stain;
'Tis He alone can bring us back
To happiness again.
In spirit then we worship God,
And truth ensures its bright award.
Capernaum.
Mark i. 21-27.
Mighty Redeemer! as thy steps I trace
Through Judah’s land;
I mark the triumphs of thy power and grace
On ev’ry hand.
New life and peace thy sacred lips afford
To all th’ oppress’d;
And devils tremble at thy sov’reign word,
And shrink aghast.
No doubtful conflict pends
Upon thy mission true.
The powers of darkness long had held their sway,
O’er Adam’s race;
And gloomy night had chas’d the smiles away,
From nature’s face.


But now deliv’rance comes; and gladness dawns
Upon the earth;
The Prince of Darkness trembles ’neath thy frowns,
With throes of death.
Thy glorious reign draws nigh,
The reign of truth and grace.
The people of Capernaum might well
With wonder stand;
And listen to the gracious words that fell
With such command:
As in their synagogue,
Thou stoodest forth to teach.
Well might the devils tremble when they heard
Such solemn truth;
Well might they shrink dismay’d to hear thy word
Command them forth.
“ What have we to do with thee, thou Holy One,”
“We know thy name;”
“Com’st thou to destroy and cast us down,”
“ Before onr time.”
“Jesus of Nazareth thou art,”
“The Holy One of God.”
Hold thy peace, nor longer dare blaspheme
God’s holy will;
Come forth, release the man from your unclean
And cruel spell.
Too long my righteous throne thou hast usurp’d,
The heart of man;
Too long my earth-born subjects thou hast kept
In slavish ban.
Now I come to claim my right,
And break thy fearful chain.
With cheerful hope, we antedate the day
So long foretold;
When thou shall drive the unclean fiend away
Prom ev’ry hold.
From Pagan climes, black with the fearful stains
Of guilt most foul;
22
FOOTPRINTS OF JESUS.


And Papal realms, still groaning ’neath the chains
Of Priestly rule.
From all our churches, where too oft is seen
The unclean spirit,
Eesisting truth, and anxious to maintain
His old inherit.
With fervent prayer we wait
Thy glorious day of power.
The Mount of Bratitudes
Matt. v. 6 and 7.
“ He speaks as never man spake,”—His words
Distil as dew upon the grass.
New light and life His teaching now affords;
To cheer and guide the crowding mass.
What multitudes I see before Him stand,
With such intense and earnest brow!
What truths, what precepts, and what high commands
Are urged, their spirits thus to bow!
Oh may I dare approach the hallow’d spot,
And mingle with the spell-bound throng;
That I may catch the gracious words that drop,
And grave them on my mem’ry strong.
No teacher e’er before
Such truths proclaim’d.
“He speaks as never man spake;” Oh to lie
Forever at His sacred feet!
To listen to the words of truth so high,
That from His lips my senses greet.
What rays of mingled love and truthfulness,
Beam forth unclouded from His eye!
What solemn tones of heart-felt seriousness,
His holy truths and precepts ply!
The hearts of all His hearers well he knows,
Their varied cases He discerns;
Their hopes, their fears, their sbcret cares and woes,


As o’er the crowd His glance He turns:
And deep compassion moves
His tender heart.
With what supreme authority He speaks!
What majesty and power attend
The sacred doctrines of His holy lips,
To awe the proud, the stubborn bend.
The maxims of the world He casts aside,
And all the glosses of the scribes;
The carnal policy and lordly pride
Of Priests and Pharisaic tribes;
He strips them of their seeming sanctity,
Their bold assumptions and demands
Lay* bare, before the truth and purity
Of God’s unchangeable commands.
A test infallible
To try our state.
The poor in spirit are the bless’d, to whom
The heavenly kingdom now belongs;
The mourners shall be comforted, and soon
Their sighs exchange for cheerful songs.
The meek and lowly shall the land inherit;
Its blessings bless’d shall gladness yield,
The ardent cravings of the contrite spirit
For truth and righteousness, be fill’d.
The merciful, the pure, the peaceful men,
The persecuted and distress’d;
The scorn of earth, the dread of evil men,
They are and ever shall be bless’d.
So the great Teacher speaks
From yonder sacred mount.
Oh that the day may speedily arrive!
When these sublime and holy truths,
Shall purge the world from carnal lust and pride,
From passion, envy, and abuse.
When man shall learn to love his fellow man,
Nations and families combine
In holy brotherhood, to break the ban
Of Satan’s empire;—black with crime.
24
FOOTPRINTS OP JESUS.


Then shall the earth in pristine beauty bloom,
A second Eden of delight;
The Saviour then his righteous Throne assume,
And reign supreme o’er sons of light.
Nor sin, nor sorrow more
Shall mar their bless’d abode.
The Sabbath Cure.
John v. 1—9.
A day beyond all others Mess’d,
Sweet emblem of eternal rest;
The holy Sabbath 1
What sacred joy the saints to meet,
And worship at the mercy-seat,
“Jehovah shamma.”
“ The Lord is there,” then let me come.
Humble and contrite to His throne;
My cares unbosom;
My maladies before Him spread,
My hopes and fears and secret dread;
“Jehovah shullum.”
The house of mercy opens wide,
Its sacred porches to provide,
For all th’ oppress’d;
Hither the great Physician comes,
To bear our sorrows, heal our wounds,
And calm the breast.
I read of one who waited long,
In care and trouble midst the throng
Of poor and maimed,
Who crowded to Bethesda’s pool;
And many a one its virtues stole,
And health regain’d.
But he! no friendly voice to cheer,
No hand to wipe the falling tear,
Nor help impart;


Neglected, and a prey to dread,
He lay upon his pallet bed
With sadden’d heart.
But One there was whose bosom yearned
With deep compassion as He turned,
And saw him lie
In helpless grief, and hopeless care;
With no kind friend his woes to bear,
Or heed his cry.
He, gentle Saviour, good and kind!
Alone can ease the troubled mind,
Or hope inspire;
He can our fiercest foes withstand,
Diseases fly at His command:
And fiends retire.
With power and majesty He speaks,
And forth from darkness morning breaks
Upon the soul I
His voice the spell of Satan breaks,
And breathes a saving power that makes
The wounded whole.
Poor cripple! with what glad surprise
And new-felt vigor didst thou rise,
And wond’ring stand;
What thrills of rapture moved thy soul,
As forth thou leapedst sound and whole,
At His command.
Then let me mark this Sabbath cure,
In every dark and trying hour,
With grateful soul.
Many a wounded spirit feels,
The grace that cheers, the power that heals,
And makes us whole.
How many darken’d minds rejoice
In new-found vision at His voice;
And hail the day!
How many bound in Satan’s chains,
Have been released from all their pains
To liberty.


Hearts overwhelm’d with doubts and fears,
And eyes suffused with bitter tears,
Have gladness found.
The fowler’s snare of subtle web,
By artful guile and malice spread;
Has been unwound.
These all have told with grateful hearts,
The healing power that grace imparts,
To wounded souls.
These all their willing tribute bring,
To Jesus their Almighty King,
Who made them whole.
Nain.
Luke vii. 11-16.
See ’st thou that widow’d mother in the train
Of silent mourners as they pass along;
Bearing the bier of death from ancient Nain,
Amid a sad and silent gazing throng?
Who is’t they bear to nature’s resting place—
The grave—where rich and poor alike repose?
What victim now has fall’n in death’s embrace,
And whence yon woman’s tears, who is’t that knows?
Ah! sad the tale of human grief and strife,
And deep her wail, and fast her flowing tears;
Her only hope is gone—joy of her life,
The stay and solace of her closing years.
Who now will cheer her lonely home,
Or smooth her passage to the tomb?
Another group I see pass slowly on
Their way to visit the abodes of Nain,
And One there is of passions deep and strong.
Whose works of power and grace we oft have seen.
Touch’d with the sight of sorrow such as her’s
Who now appears, and meets His tender gaze;


His bosom yearns with love, her woes He shares,
And by a word her troubl’d spirit lays.
Weep not, He cries, with kind and gentle voice,
Dry your sad tears, and still your throbbing heart,
I bring you help and comfort; then rejoice,
I ’ll heal your pangs, and cure their bitter smart.
Then stay the fountain of your grief,
Look up, and quickly find relief.
Ah I little did she dream that One so poor
In outward form and mien, was really He
Whom Israel long had watch’d and waited for
To bring deliv’rance and their bondage free,
And little did she deem that help for her
Could come in this dark hour of pressing grief;
Or that a balm of any kind could cure
A wound so deep, or minister relief.
Tor me what help can come, in this dread hour?
What ray of light can cheer the hopeless gloom
That overspreads my soul? what human power
Can snatch my first-born from the tomb?
Then, wherefore bid me cease to weep?
Ah stranger! sure my heart will break.
Put as the darkest gloom precedes the dawn
Of morning, bright with cheerful sunny rays,
So oft deliv’rance comes, and joy is borne
On wings of blackest night and saddest lays.
He now approaches to the bier:—with awe,
And mute suspense, the sad procession stays;
The wond’ring crowd in silent dread withdraw,
As now upon the corpse His hand He lays.
Oh what a moment of intense surprise!
What deep emotion wakes each tender cord;
The gracious Saviour speaks! ‘'young man arise!”
And forth he stands obedient to the word.
Now dry your tears, and ease your heart,
And bid your fears henceforth depart.
O gracious helper of the helpless ones!
Whose hearts are rent with sorrow and with care,
Thy smile is brighter than a thousand suns,
To cheer the soul when sinking in despair.

FOOTPRINTS OF JESUS.


How oft have I thy watchful goodness proved,
How oft thy tender sympathy adored!
How hast Thou ever made thy promise good.
In every hour of need help to afford!
When all my earthly sources seem’d dried up,
And every hope had fled, and effort failed;
And naught seem’d left but drain the bitter cup,
Then, unexpectedly thy power prevail’d.
Then let me still with patience wait
Thy time, nor doubt the promis’d aid.
Death and the grave their fearful sceptre wield
O’er all the sons of Adam’s fallen race,
They march triumphant o’er the battle field,
And daily sweep their thousands from the face
Of this defil’d and sin struck world; but soon
The spoiler shall be spoil’d and all his prey
Be ransom’d from the life-devouring tomb,
And hail the glad approach of blissful day.
Jesus the I’rince of life, in blood stained vest.
Shall trample on the foe, and spoil him quite;
The ebon sceptre from his hand He ’ll wrest.
And chain him down in realms of blackest night.
Then shall the earth with anthems ring,
O grave! where is thy victory?
O death! where is thy sting?
The Sea of Tiherias.
Matt. viii. 23-25.
A tempest sweeps the Lake;
The little vessel toss’d amid the foam
Of rolling waves, and driven before the storm;
The voyagers fears awake.
The band of humble men
On whom the Saviour laid His high command
To follow in his footsteps through the land,
Are blanch’d with fear and dread.
c


But He—the Waster sleeps!
Secure and tranquil ’midst the rage and roar
Of elements that dash the vessel o’er,
And heave the restless deep.
“We perish Lord” they cry:
All hope is gone; no cheering ray appears,
To quell the angry storm, or still our fears,
Nor clear the gloomy sky.
He hears their sore distress.
And forth Ho stands, arm’d with the power to quell
The mighty winds, their dreadful wrath dispel;
And calm the sea to rest.
He speaks! and all is still;
The angry billows stay their fearful rage,
At His command they cease the strife to wage,
And bow before his will.
0 Saviour! may I ever find thee near,
To still the storm, allay the rising fear;
To speak the word of peace when troubles rise,
And dry the falling, tear from weeping eyes.
Thy power I know is boundless as thy love.
Thou rul’st the worlds below, and worlds above,
Barth, air, and seas, are subject to Thy will,
Thou bidd’st the billows rise, and say’st be still.
When earth and sky their mingl’d rage conspire,
And forked lightnings dart their vivid fire;
My shatter’d bark on mountain seas is driven,
With all her cordage snapt and canvass riven;
B’en then I’ll trust thy power and will
To keep me safe; the tempest still.
When fierce temptations, like a deluge roll,
Or angry passions stir my inmost soul;
When guilty fears, like clouds obscure the day,
And frightful spectres scare my lonely way;
When hateful fiends like lions roar and rage,
And all their kindred myrmidons engage
To cast me down, and tempt me to despair;
1 ’ll ne’er forget that Thou my Lord art near.
The feeblest cry, I know, will reach thine ear.

Will bring deliv’rance, calm my rising fear;
Will still the hurricane, and clear the sky,
My enemies disperse, and bid them fly.
Then shall I safely reach my home,
Where storms and tempests never come.
The Massiahship.
Matt. xvi. 3—20.
In whom besides did e’er such virtues meet
In perfect harmony and spotless huel
Who else but He could bear the searching light
That brings our secret purposes to view?
What meekness and what majesty combin’d,
With fervent love to God, and love to man!
What pure benevolence, what holy mind;
And boundless grace, through all Ills actions ran.
What firm and bold reproof of every sinl
With deep and strong compassion for men’s souls;
What self-denial and earnest toils to win
The lost; and make the poor and wretched whole!
All that became His soul Divine,
With all the traits of perfect man.
The wond’rous works by holy men foretold,
As marking the Messiah’s glorious day;
Were wrought by Him before the gazing world,
In spite of all His enemies could say.
He still’d the tempest, walk’d the troubl’d sea,
The lame restored to health, the thousands fed;
He heal’d the leprous, made the blind to see,
And wak’d to life again the sleeping dead.
Who else but He such wonders could achieve,
By His own power, unaided and alone?
Who else but He could such dread woes relieve?
A word, a touch sufficed, and it was done.
Yes, this is He, the Mighty one,
Whom now 1 see, God’s only Son,


In sweet and holy converse by the way,
The Saviour leads His humble followers on,
As step by step He moves them to display,
With fervid zeal, their passions deep and strong.
This conversation will for ever stand
A faithful record in the church of God,
Graven in memory deep, in every land
Where men have learned to prize the Saviour’s word.
“Whom do the people say I am?” He asks,
What knowledge have they of my rightful claim?
The works I do, the lessons I impart;
What say they of my character and name?
Some say thou ’rt John the Baptist risen to life,
To warn them of Messiah’s coming reign;
Some that Elias comes with judgments rife,
And some, that Jeremias lives again.
But what say you my followers, to my claim?
You’ve journey’d with me through the cities round;
You’ve seen my works, and joined my humble train.
Then say, what truths concerning me you’ve found!
Whom do you say lam?
What answer can you give?
To this their gracious Master’s plain demand,
Th’ intrepid Peter states in prompt reply,
A glorious truth received by all the band
Of true disciples, with unfeigned joy.
“ Thou art the Christ. Son of the living God ”
Thy claims we own, and bow to thy control;
Ere worlds were framed, by highest heaven adored,
The centre of attraction, and the soul.
Thou art the true Messiah, long foretold,
In whom our fathers trusted; and to whom
The ancient rites refer in figures bold;
Israel’s deliverer from destruction’s doom.
Thou art indeed the Christ of God,
King David’s Son, and Sovereign Lord.
“Blessed art thou Simon Jona’s sonl”
Mere flesh and blood hath not this truth revealed;
But God my Father, from His heavenly throne,
Hath moved thy heart in homage thus to yield.


Thou art a stone, thy name thus indicates.
And thy unflinching firmness proves it true;
But on this Rock my church securely rests.
In spite of ail that earth or hell can do.
My perfect Godhead and Messiahship,
A firm foundation lays on Zion’s bill.
And 'gainst a Hock so solid, firm and deep
The mightiest powers combined shall ne’er prevail.
Error may work with dark and subtle guile,
But shall not undermine a truth so firm;
Intestine broils may trouble and beguile.
The faithless and the hypocrite to turn;
Temptations like a hurricane may lash.
And persecution beat with wildest shock;
They do but waste their vain attempts to crush
The Church, whose sure foundation is this Kock.
We can defy the gates of hell,
Their power and rage shall ne’er prevail.
The Transtiguration.
Luke ix. 28—36.
To Tabor's lofty summit let me turn
My meditative glance;
Whilst holy ttioughts within ray bosom burn,
And visions grand entrance.
Far from the captious hordes of evil men.
The Saviour turns away;
To scenes of calm and still retirement,
To meditate and pray.
The three disciples, Peter, James and John,
His steps accompany;
And sweet their musings as they pass along,
From strife and tumult free.
'Eapt in devout and fervent prayer, His soul
Glows with intense desire;


The ages past, and future as they roll,
His tenderest thoughts inspire.
Deep gloom o’erspreads this fall’n and sinful world.
Save where the promise shines;
That God’s high purposes of grace unfolds,
In fair and brilliant lines.
These purposes are ripening fast; —and now
He sees the day approach;
To seal and consummate His solemn vow,
And pay redemption’s price.
Deeper and more intense His fervour glows.
And strong emotion moves
His tender heart, at sight of human woes,
As o’er the scene He roves.
His soul within him burns with holy fire,
Immingling with the light
That glows from God’s bright throne, and streams afar,
With beams of glory bright.
While thus engaged, His countenance assumes,
A light beyond the brilliant noon-day rays;
His raiment brighter than a thousand suns,
In dazzling whiteness pours its radiant blaze.
Moses, the guide of Israel’s ancient host,
And bold Elias, prophet great and true;
Leave for awhile the mansions of the bless’d,
To commune with the Saviour here below.
They talk of his decease, and cheer His mind
With glorious prospects of triumphant day;
The rites abolish’d, justice magnified,
Satan despoil’d, and driven from his prey.
Millions of happy Spirits saved from thrall
To liberty again, with all its joys,
Cleans’d by His blood, made meet with God to dwell,
And swell the anthems of celestial praise.
The great and fearful struggle now draws near,
To win the prize and bring the blessing down;
The scourge. the thorns, the nails, the Roman spear,
And more than these, His Heavenly Father’s frown.

FOOTPRINTS OF JESUS.


He sees it all, and still His purpose holds
Undaunted; still with ardour presses on
To meet the strife, to crush His mighty foes.
And through the shameful cross to seize the crown.
With dread surprise the three disciples wake,
And gaze upon their Lord’s transfigured mien;
His dazzling robes, their brilliancy so great,
Their waking senses scarce discern the scene.
’Tis good they cry to be for ever here,
Let us prolong the bright and blissful scene!
Three tabernacles let us forthwith rear,
Not knowing what they say, or what they mean.
But now another scene of glory spreads,
The bright Shechinah canopies the mount;
The poor disciples trembling bow their heads,
And veil their faces ’fore this radiant cloud.
Jehovah speaks! 0! let me catch the sound,
And in my mem’ry store the solemn call
That wakes attention; and to those around
Declares Him true, and homage claims from all,
“This is my Son”—then hear His gracious word,
Give earnest heed to His instructions true;
Moses, and all the Prophets, light afford.
But He the promise seals, and precepts too.
The Jewish rites no more, nor Prophet’s lyre,
Nor visions dark and dim;
Nor mitr’d Priests, nor sacrificial fire,
Messiah’s come, “hear Him!”
Lazrus.
John xi. 1—44.
Beside the tomb where Laz’rus lay,
The weeping sisters stood;
No mortal hand could wipe away
Their tears, nor stay the flood.


One, only One there is who knows,
How deep our sorrows arej
And He was there t’ assuage their woes,
And help their grief to bear.
Dear Saviour, ever true and kind,
No voice hut thine can soothe the mind.
O Master! if thou hadst been here,
Martha and Mary cried;
To minister relief and cure,
Our brother had not died.
Their anguish stirr’d His inmost soul;
At sight of their distress
His love burst forth beyond control,
And heaved His tender breast.
“Jesus wept.”
0 let me mark those wond’rous tears!
And glory in the thought,
That God the Saviour ever bears
His people on His heart.
Their pains He feels, their sorrow shares,
Their sicknesses and woes;
Their burdens and their grief He bears,
And their temptation knows.
0 may this thought my spirit cheer!
And banish every rising fear.
“Jesus wept”
1 too must follow in His steps,
And sympathise with grief;
Nor weep alone o’er men’s distress,
But seek to yield relief.
Thus shall I best His word fulfil,
And share a brother’s woe;
The Saviour’s bright example still
Present to constant view.
A light to those who sit in gloom,
A guide to those whose footsteps roam.
Jesus groaning within himself,
Now cometh to the tomb;


And issues forth His high command,
“ Koll ye away the stone.”
With dread surprise the sisters shrink,
The crowd in sore afright
Draw back; and tremble at the brink,
Dreading the loathsome sight.
But He! with calm and peaceful mien
Stands forth in majesty supreme.
To heaven He lifts an earnest gaze,
And breathes His thanks aloud;
To God who justifies His ways
Before the wond’ring crowd.
Then with a voice that rends the sky,
And shakes the solid earth;
He calls aloud with piercing cry
“Lazarus come forth.”
And forth he comes to public view
They loose his bands and let him go.
So at the last great judgment day,
The dead shall hear His voice;
The earth and sea shall yield their prey,
Then shall his friends rejoice;
But those who scorned the gracious call
Of mercy’s gentle breath;
Shall wake to everlasting thrall,
And die the second death.
O fearful doom 1 how sad, how drear,
How dark the gloom of fell despair I
Caiaphas.
John xi. 47-53.
Vain manl thou know’st not what thou say’st.
Nor whom thou doom’st to death;
The base and cruel plot thou lay’st.
Recoils upon thyself


Thy wicked craftiness and guile,
The nation to secure;
Will issue in their fearful spoil,
And make their ruin sure.
Thou say’st “’tis meet that one should die,”
And not the nation fall;
And this thy fiendish policy,
Is welcom’d by them all.
And now they plot His death, who comes
To save their ruin’d race;
The great, the true, the Righteous One,
Whom all their Prophets trace.
He whom their fathers long had sought
In faith’s triumphant power;
Whose promise cheer’d their hearts, and brought
Peace in the trying hour.
This is the Man, though free from guilt,
And pure as perfect light;
Whose blood they say must now be spilt,
T’ appease the Roman state.
If thus we let this man alone,
All men will follow him;
And raise his standard and his throne,
And public favor win.
The Romans then will take away
Our nation and our place;
Will drive us forth in dread dismay,
And clothe us with disgrace.
To save us then from their resent,
Prom sorrow’s bitter cry;
From slavery and banishment,
’Tis meet that he should die.
So spake the cruel Sanhedrim,
And now their force combine;
To crush His power, destroy His name,
Regardless of the crime.
Ah! little do they think that thus,
Despite their crafty skill;


They do but prove his mission just,
And God’s decree fulfil,
’Twas prophesied that He should die
A saerifice for sin;
Not Jews alone but all who lie
Beneath God’s fearful ban.
These men with wicked hearts and hands.
Their own desires fulfil-
But God’s decree and promise stands,
Despite the rage of hell.
The Mount of Olives.
Luke xix. 41 and 42.
When passing o’er the lofty brow,
Of Olive’s sacred mount;
High soon dim? praises greet Him now.
And songs Ilia deeds recount.
“Hosanna to the Son of God ”
Both man and babes proclaim;
They spread their garments in the road,
With loud and long acclaim.
Ho paused! and gazing o’er the plain
That stretch’d far out below;
And knowing well the fearful train
Of woes, that soon would flow:
Compassion moved His sacred breast,
And by their sorrows sore oppress’d,
He wept.
He saw the guilty city dyed
In blood of Martyrs true,
In unbelief and bitter pride,
And crimes of deepest hue:
He saw the house of God, where once
The bright Shcchinah flamed;
Now reft of all its former pride,
Its sacred rites profan’d.


He saw the Mount on which He knew
His blood would soon be spilt
To seal the cov’nant just and true,
T’ atone for human guilt;
He saw the Tribes of Israel spoil’d,
And scatter’d far and wide;
Bearing the judgments of their God,
Whose mercy they defied:
He saw; and pity moved His heart,
And pierced His soul with bitter smart;
He wept.
No people e’er had been so Mess’d,
No city so renown’d;
No other nation so caress’d
Could on this earth be found.
The sacred word to them was given,
With laws and rites divine;
And on their path the light of heaven.
Had never ceased to shine.
And now the Son himself appears.
To claim Messiah’s right;
Divine authority He bears.
And shs-ds a heavenly light:
But all these mercies they despise;
And now die hour is come.
To hide them ever from their eyes,
And seal their righteous doom.
The Saviour saw the fearful scroll
Of woes, and mov’d within His soul
He wept.
“0 hadst thou known in this thy day,”
“The things that make for peace!”
Hadst thou improv’d without delay.
These means of proffered grace!
Hadst thou attended to the call
By holy Prophets given!
And now at last, and more than all
The Son himself from heaven;
Hadst thou but listen’d to the voice,
That your attention claim’d!


That bade the banish’d ones rejoice
In liberty proclaim’d!
Then hadst thou ’neath my fostering wing
True peace and safety found;
Nor Roman yoke, nor Satan’s sting,
Should e’er have caus’d a wound.
But now your house is desolate
And strangers spoil your land:
He wept.
He weeps no more! but still His heart
With deep compassion yearns,
O’er those who from His laws depart,
And all His offers spurn.
Ah! sad it is to think, that now
In this bright day of grace;
So many should refuse to know
“The things that make for peace
So many should display their hate,
And treat His name with scorn;
His holy service desecrate
And trample on the boon:
Sad to reflect, how soon they may
From all their hopes be torn;
And left to grief and sore dismay,
And everlasting scorn:
How soon their day of grace may close,
And Jesus call no more;
But leave them to the fearful throes
Of long and deep despair.
O that they would but now attend!
Their gospel mercies prize;
And seek the joys that never end,
The bliss that never dies!
Then should their souls in safety dwell;
Free from the storms of earth and hell.


Gethsemane
Luke xxii. 39—44.
With rev’rence deep and awe profound,
O let me now draw near!
And gaze upon the hallow’d ground,
Gethsemano so dear.
Hither the Saviour oft repair’d
To spend the midnight hour
In holy musings, fervent prayer;
Far from the rage and power
Of subtle scribes and cruel priests,
And all their wicked horde;
From labour and from toil releas’d,
To commune with his God.
What sweet retirement here He found!
What calm delight and rest
Would spread their gentle influence round.
To cheer His sacred breast!
O hallow’d spot! thy shades I see
Calm, peaceful, still Gethsemano!
But what dread sounds are those I hear,
Borne on the midnight breeze;
That break the stillness of the hour;
What mean those fearful cries?
And what is this that meets my sight?
What scenes of anguish rise?
Sorrow o’erwhelms the Saviour quite,
On the cold ground He lies.
What is’t that now distracts His heart?
Whence come those bitter tears?
No mortal hand has touch’d Him yet,
No human power, those fears,
What mean those reeking streams of gore
That flow from every vein?
Who can define the cause; or who
The mystery explain?
Mere human wisdom fails to state,
Or tell the reason why

That Holy One, th’ Immaculate
Should groan and bleed and die!
Some deep mysterious powers control
The hidden passions of His soul.
“ For our transgressions He was bruised ”
The holy Prophet cries;
“ He bare our sins and trespasses,”
For guilt a sacrifice.
And now th’ appointed hour draws near
The conflict to sustain;
To meet his foes, the curse to bear,
And so the victory gain.
The fearful wrath to sinners due,
Now bows His spirit down;
All that Satanic rage can do,
But most, His Father’s frown:
Mysterious suff’rings! who can tell!
What mortal tongue recite!
None but the lost ones, doom’d to dwell
In dark and endless night.
He who ne’er broke His Father’s laws,
Nor knew the taint of crime,
Now groans beneath the weight; and bows
Before the wrath divine:
The cup of trembling now He tastes,
The bitter draught His spirit wastes.
He sees the guilt of human kind,
Past, present, and to come;
The vision floats before His mind,
In clouds of awful gloom:
He sees the world for which He bleeds,
A Theatre of crime;
The race for whom He intercedes
Steep’d in the vilest sin.
He sees the guilty city teem
With rage; and ’fore Him stand,
The Traitor and the Sanhedrim,
Now bartering for His blood:
He sees that in His holy name,
And neath His banner bright,


Bierce persecution’s fires will flame,
Around the sons of light.
He sees the Hierachies of Borne,
That masterpiece of hell;
Spread like the Upas tree its gloom,
And poison life’s bright well;
He sees the blood of Martyrs dear
Flowing in crimson tide
To quench the light, a Temple rear
To worldly craft and pride:
He sees it all with dread surprise,
As on the earth He prostrate lies.
And now a bright-wing’d messenger
From heaven bends gently down;
To raise His head, His heart to cheer,
And point him to the crown.
Vict’ry shall soon her laurels twine
Around His thorn-torn brow;
And all th’ angelic hosts combine,
And saints with rev’rence bow.
Cheer’d by the vision bright, His mind
Regains its former peace;
His spirit new-born vigour finds,
His fears and conflicts cease.
He rises now in tranquil bliss,
And Judas comes with treach’rous kiss.
Pilate's Expedient
John xix. 1-5.
“Behold the man I”
Ye false descendants of God’s ancient tribes;
Gaze on His face, and cease your bitter gibes:
His suff’rings scan.
The crown of thorns
Upon His kingly brow He meekly wears;


The reedy sceptre in His hand He bears,
In mimic scorn.
Defil’d with tears;
His back in deep and ghastly furrows torn,
The purple robe in mocking royalty worn;
He now appears.
No fault I find;
Pilate the Roman Governor declares
Worthy of death, then why such malice bear;
Such angry mind.
“ Let him depart
Stay your infuriate rage, your groundless fears
And fierce resentment; —he no semblance bears
Of treach’rous heart.
So spake the Roman; but his effort fail’d
To still the tumult of their bitter hate;
To lead their cruel minds one jot to yield,
Or aught their rage and enmity abate.
Still they reiterate the fearful cry
To drive Him hence to judgment and to death;
Their rightful Prince and King to crucify.
And Tase His name for ever from the earth.
Thus they complete their sum of guilt,
And for the world His blood is spilt.
“ Behold the man!”
Now mourning sinner dry the falling tear.
Look up and gaze believing in His face;
For thee Ho suffer’d, all thy guilt He bear,
lie waits to fold thee in His kind embrace.
Look ! look again! and never turn away,
Heed not the voice of unbelief and fear;
Nor yield again to sorrow or dismay,
Nor let the false One tempt thee to despair.
His work a sure foundation lays
For present peace and endless praise.
“ Behold the man 1”
Thou who art press’d with grief, and sore distress’d
By bitter conflicts, and with care cast down;


Whose troubled spirit seeks to find a rest
From fierce temptation and the world’s dread frown:
Look! look to Him! and still thy throbbing heart,
Trust in His power and grace to help thee through;
Say to thy fears and cruel foes, depart!
Hence and begone! your craft and wiles I know:
Jesus the friend of sinners dear,
Will bring relief; my spirit cheer.
“Behold the man!”
The more thou look’st, the more thy faith will grow
In strength and vigour for the war of life;
His power and grace the better thou wilt know,
And be prepar’d to meet the deadly strife.
A crown of glory now He wears above,
And o’er the universe His sceptre sways;
No power can stay His reign, or quench His love,
Or lead Him to forget His promises.
“ Behold the man!” in faith and love,
And patient wait His smiles above.
Calvary.
Matt, xxvii. 1—44.
Through yonder city gates what crowds rush forth
Burning with eager haste;
On some dread errand of malignant wrath.
Urged on by turban’d Priests.
Thousands and tons of thousands still appear,
Swelling the mighty flood;
Onward they press, and taint the morning air
With frenzied cries for blood.
Jerusalem what tumult moves thee thus
Thy dwellings to disgorge?
What stirs thy furious multitudes to rush
Thus madly on their course?
Still on they press, and rend the sky
With curses foul and maddening cry.

Three men I see by Roman soldiers led,
Two, of disgusting mien;
But who is He, the third, with thom-crown’d head?

• One mass of bleeding wounds He now appears,
Sinking beneath His load;
His visage marr’d with grief and bitter tears,
His footsteps stain’d with blood.
With faint and feeble steps He bears the cross.
And patient bows His head;
But now he stops! ah now He sinks exhaust,
No further can He tread.

Then urge Him on His painful road.
And now they reach the spot, so drear and dread,
The place of sculls they call;
Scatter’d with bones, the ashes of the dead.
That fearful scenes recall.
They nail Him to the cross; on either side
The Thieves hang writhing by;
No murmer ’scapes His lips, yet they deride.
And mock, and taunt and cry
“Others He saved; now let Him save himself,
“ If He be the Son of God,”
Let Him come down and give us thus the proof,
And seal His boasting word.
Then we ’ll believe His rightful claim,
His standard bear, and own His name.
Three ling’ring hours He hung in helpless grief,
Exposed to taunts and jeers;
No voice to cheer, no hand to bring relief,
Or wipe His falling tears.
Save those poor women that stand weeping by,
All have forsaken Him;
No one but John could dare to venture nigh
To brave the fearful scene:
To him the Saviour with His dying breath,
Commends His Mother,
“Behold thy Son,” with filial love He saith,


“And you your mother.”
What loro was in His bosom hid,
How true to nature all He did.
What plaintive cry is that now meets my ear
From yon expiring Thief!
Trembling with deep emotion, godly fear,
And bitter heart-felt grief:
What is’t that moves his inmost soul ? what power
Now melts his flinty heart?
And leads him in his last departing hour,
To feel sin’s bitter smart.
His life is ebbing fast away; and now
His last expiring breath
Is spent in fervent prayer to Him who bows
His righteous soul in death.
“ Remember mo, O Lord,” the suff’rer cries
In yonder world so fair;
“ To-day” the dying Saviour quick replies,
“ Thou shalt be with mo there.”
A trophy of my power and fame
Snatch’d as a fire-brand from the flame.
A fearful darkness now o’erspreads the land,
Emblem of wrath divine;
A darkness deeper veils the Saviour’s mind,
The curse for human crime.
Oil who can tell His suff’ringsl who can count
The mighty sum of woe!
What language paint, what mortal tongue recount?
The wrath to sinners duo;
That wrath He bare in those dread hours of gloom,
Darker than Egypt saw;
The dreadful presage of the sinner’s doom,
The curses of God’s law.
A w-eight to crush the mightiest down
To deepest hell and darkest gloom.
But now the work is done; ’tis finish’d all,
The mighty debt is paid;
Redemption is complete, and free to all
The great Atonement made.


See! see! the quaking earth, the opening graves,
The riven Temple veil;
Well may the Priests and Soldiers stand amaz’d,
The bold Centurion quail.
He dies! earth trembles; angels bend their wings,
And silent view the scene:
Hell’s caverns with the glad announcement rings,
He’s dead! we ’ve conquer’d Him.
Peals of infernal laughter now burst forth,
And strange unnatural fires
Light up the dark and drear abodes of death,
With fierce and dreadful glare.
Shout! shout they cry! your arches rend,
See here the mighty boaster’s end!
Vaunt not ye potent powers, your seeming prize,
Nor think your vict’ry sure;
Ere long that slaughter’d One again shall rise
To trample on your power.
Ere long He ’ll crush thy reign proud Prince of hell,
Drive thy bold legions back
In foul disgrace; ere long thy cruel spell
He T 1 break, —and treach’ry black.
Ere long this earth shall bloom afresh, and bear
The fruits of paradise;
Its soil now moisten’d with His blood and tears.
Shall forth to beauty rise.
That cross, that blood, those tears those groans,
Are fraught with bliss to Zion’s sons.
Mourning Thoughts.
Poor sorrowing disciples whither are ye fled,
Heart-broken and dismay’d;
Your prospects blasted, and your Master dead,
Your ardent hopes betray’d.
Where do ye seek concealment and relief?
Where breathe your sad regret?


Your dark forebodings, dismal fears and grief,
Now your bright sun has set?
’Reft of His power, His regal standard tom,
And trampl’d in the dust;
In yonder tomb He lies, of glory shorn,
Where now your former trust?
We thought it had been He, who should redeem
Our land to liberty;
Should build her throne anew, and reign supreme,
In world-wide majesty.
But what a blow is this! who now will come
Our nation to restore?
Our brightest hopes are buried in His tomb
Deep; to rise no more,
lie promis’d to return and take us home;
By this, what could He mean?
Whence will He come? from yonder prison tomb?
Ah! soldiers guard the scene.
The stone is roll’d and seal’d, the watch is set;
Besides, we saw Him dead;
How will He then His promise keep? as yet
We know not what He said.
Then wait ye weak ones, wait your Master’s time,
His word deserves your trust;
The cloud withdraws, the sun again shall shine.
His prison bars He ’ll burst.
No longer then indulge your boding woes,
Behold the hour draws nigh;
When you shall boldly face your mightiest foes
With power from on high.
The First Day of the Week.
Matt, xxviii, 1—10. John xx. 1—18.
Hark! from the highest heavens the joyful cry
Resounds, and echoes through the courts on high;
The Lord is risen!

FOOTPRINTS OP JESUS.


Fresh tune your harps ye Seraphs pure and bright,
The Saviour now displays His power and right;
And hursts His prison.
Shout! let your anthems ring from heaven to earth,
O’er hill and dale, as at His lowly birth
Your strains burst forth.
He is risen! let mortals catch the sound;
And spread the news to the remotest bound
Of this wide earth.
This first-day morn the sorrowing women come
On pious errand to their Master’s tomb;
Fearless of Roman spears, or Jewish rage,
This last dread work their holy thoughts engage.
Silent and sad their musings by the way,
As on they urge their steps ere break of day,
Through valleys dim and drear; the coming light
Just struggling through the gloom of closing night.
Their love unquenchable, divine and pure,
Their faith and zeal unshaken in this hour
Of bitter trial, when others shrink away,
In timid fear and cowardly dismay.
Not all the cares that press upon the mind,
Nor furious rage of earth and hell combined;
Can make them to their Master recreant prove,
Or tempt them to forget His dying love.
And now they reach the Sepulchre, when lo!
A scene of passing wonder meets their view;
A Seraph bright appears! His form and mien
Resplendent as the sun at mid-day seen:
Upon his brow sits majesty serene.
His countenance like light’nings vivid gleam;
Power in his lifted arm and piercing eye,
In dread alarm the watch-guards prostrate lie.
The women start! shrink back with sudden fear!
Before this bright cherubic messenger;
The Sepulchre they see, the stone remov’d
But where is He! their Lord, so dearly loved?
Mary the Magdalene in deep dismay,
Now hastily returns her homeward way;


They ’ve ta’en away the Lord she sorrowing cries
And now we know not where the body lies.
The two remaining, held in deep amaze,
Transfix’d with wonder, bend their earnest gaze
On this bright form, and on the vacant crypt
Where late the body of their Master slept.
Fear not, the heavenly visitant exclaims,
I know the object of your pious pains;
Ye seek your murder’d Lord, He is not here,
But risen! come see the place, and cease your fear.
No longer seek the living ’mongst the dead.
But to His friends the joyful tidings spread,
That He is risen; His promises to keep
Despite His foes, and save His scatter’d sheep.
Then quickly they depart with fear and joy,
Not knowing how, or what their thoughts employ;
Or whether some bright trance their spirit binds,
That cheers, and yet deceives their trembling minds.
Now Mary comes, with Peter and his friend,
With haste these two their anxious footsteps bend;
The empty tomb they view, then quick return,
In sadness to their dark and cheerless home.
But Alary dreads to leave the hallow’d spot
Where late He lay; she has not yet forgot,
Nor ever can, the mercy He had shewn
To her, so vile, so wretched and undone.
Como life, come death, come banishment or woe,
Still to her Master she is ever true;
No smiles can lure her faithful soul away,
Nor frowns nor threats her holy love betray.
This woman now stands weeping at the tomb,
When lo! a form appears amidst the gloom
That shrouds the spot; her dim and tearful eyes
Scarcely discerning what or who it is.-
“ If thou hast borne him hence, Oh tell me where!
Ease my sad heart, now breaking with despair.”
“Mary!” says Jesus: Oh that well-known voice!
Thrills through her soul, and wakes ecstatic joys;


’Tis He! ’tis He I I know Him now she cries,
My risen Lord! Oh! with what glad surprise
And trembling joy she clasps His sacred feet,
What strange unmingl’d bliss her senses greet.
“Cling not around me thus, I’m not yet gone
“ To take possession of my kingly throne;
“But go and tell them all that I am risen,”
Despite the bands of death, and yon dark prison.
Now Mary stay your grief, and dry your tears,
Nor longer nurse your dark and boding fears,
He lives again:
Swift to your sad companions speed your way,
And hail with joy this glad triumphant day,
That greets His reign.
The Parting Word.
Matt, xxviii. 16—20, Mark xvi, 15 nd 16.
Go forth! the tidings spread,
Lift up the standard high;
To nations dark and dead,
Ye faithful heralds fly:
The gospel preach to all the world,
The banner of the crosa unfurl.
Go forth! and in my name
The wond’rous story tell;
Salvation wide proclaim,
From bondage and from hell:
Earth’s darkest regions now explore,
Lo! I am with you evermore.
The nations all are mine,
By purchase and by right:
Where’er the day-beams shine,
Or clouds obscure their light:
My power controls, my wisdom guides
And for their wants my hand provides.


Then go! to them proclaim
The message of my love;
Go! spread abroad my name,
And quickly from above
The Spirit shall come down, to bless
This parch’d and dreary wilderness.
To those who hear the word,
And trust my sacrifice;
ITI give the bright award,
Of pure and perfect joys:
But those who disbelieve shall die.
And on their souls their guilt shall lie.
So spake their Lord, when lo! a cloud of light
Descends upon the Mount, and from their sight,
Triumphant bears Him; whilst with deep amaze
They wond’ring stand, and upward bend their gaze.
O could wo follow Him to yon bright world!
What scenes of perfect bliss should we behold;
What shouts of triumph hear; what loud acclaims
Would greet His entrance on the heavenly plains.
Fresh from the scones of fearful strife He comes,
Bearing the spoils of vict’ry in His arms;
The keys of death and hell hang at His side,
And ’neath His feet their powers and princedoms lie:
His kingly brow adorn’d with many crowns,
His hands and feet still bear the scars and wounds
Deceived in the fell struggle that secured
His dear bought victory.
“Lift up your heads, ye everlasting gates
“ And give the King of glory to come in.
“ Who is the King of glory? Ho who left
“ His throne of glory for the pangs of death.
“ Lift up your heads ye everlasting gates,
“And give the King of glory to come in.
“Who is the King of glory? He who slew
“ The rav’nous foe that gorg’d all human race!
“ The King of glory He, whose glory fill’d
“ Heaven with amazement at His love to man
“And with divine complacency beheld
“ Powers most illumin’d wilder’d in the theme.”


Now let the church her holy work fulfil;
Through the wide earth this gospel spread, and still
His cause maintain, who conquer’d when He fell,
And fill’d with dread the potentates of helL
This is the halm to heal the ills of life,
To still men’s raging passions, bitter strife;
To scatter with its peace-inspiring breath,
The clouds and storms and woes of raging death.
’Tis this alone can liberty impart
To man enslav’d; can change his sinful heart,
Inspire with holy love his troubl’d breast,
And fit His soul for pure and perfect rest.
Then preach the gospel! send your heralds forth,
Disperse from east to west, from south to north
The word of life; nor doubt its saving power,
To renovate the earth and blessings shower.
With cheerful hope we hail the coming day,
When all mankind shall bow beneath the sway
Of Him who reigns supreme in heaven above,
And cheers this earth with tokens of His love.
Ere long the strife of ages shall subside,
Error shall yield to truth, and bitter pride
Give place to love: vile superstition’s thrall
Shall be dissolv’d before His gentle rule.
Ere long death’s sceptre shall to dust decay,
Darkness and gloom give place to perfect day;
The song of heaven burst forth in rapturous strain,
To hail His wide and universal reign.
Thomas Paterson, Printer, 81, Mootahoo! Street, Qeclong.
