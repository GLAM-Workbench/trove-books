ACT I
Scene I.
Santa Claus’ horn*. Day before Xmas.
[The Brownies are seated on the floor working at Australian
toys ( Kangaroos , Koalas , Mia-mias , Boomerangs ).
Brownie music is played right through — Brownies
work without looking up. Then, as music rest arts
they stand and sing and dance Brownie dance.
Words —Verse i.
Come, Brownies, come, we must not make a sound !
Let’s form our circle and trip lightly round.
Each one with tiny voice,
May let his soul rejoice,
mortal people, we must not be found.
Verse 2.
Santa’s workmen have toiled the whole year through,
It’s Christmas Eve and we want some fun too !
Give to each one your hand,
O, Brownies of the band !
And dance again till daylight comes a-new.
At end , children say “ Hist ! ” and run back to toys and
continue working. They sing Brownie Song (Some use
hammers in chorus).


Brownie Song :
Verse i.
We're Brownies of the Brownie band,
We’re busy making toys,
We make them all for Christmas time,
Presents for girls and boys.
Chorus:
And some have hammers
As you can see,
You can hear them —one, two, three,
And some have hammers
As you can see,
To make toys for the Christmas Tree.
Verse 2.
And some are dressing up the dolls,
See how the needles fly.
The thread goes in, the thread goes out,
To waste no time we try.
Chorus : As above
Enter Santa Claus .
Santa Claus :
Well, Brownies, are the toys nearly finished ?
Brownies :
Yes, Santa Claus.
Santa Claus :
Why, what is this ?


ist Brownie :
That’s a boomerang, Santa Claus, and, if you throw it
properly —why, it will come right back to you. I'll
show you, Santa. ( Picks it up and makes to throw ;
everyone crouches down).
Santa Claus :
No ! no ! don't ! You see, you mightn’t throw it
properly.
2nd Brownie :
Look at our mia-mias ( Children with mia-mias cluster
round Santa).
3rd Brownie :
The aborigines live in these under the branches, and they
have a fire in front, and that’s where the lubras sleep.
Brownie :
The lubras are the women, you know, Santa !
Santa :
I see.
Other Brownies Stand :
Look, look, Santa, at MINE !
Santa :
And these are the koalas and kangaroos ! {picking
them up in turn).
Brownie :
MY kangaroo has got a joey, Santa ! ( shows it).


Brownie :
And look at my little baby Koala ! (shows it).
Santa i
They are beautiful, but who do you think is going to
play with all these things ?
Brownie : ,
Well, Mrs. Santa Claus said that they are just what the
Australian children ask for, for Christmas presents.
Santa i
I see. Well, pick them all up now, and run away and
ask Mrs. Santa Claus if she would mind coming in here
just for a minute.
(Exit Brownies to quid music).
Enter Mrs. Santa Claus.)
Mrs. Santa :
You wanted me, Santa ?
Santa Claus ;
Yes, mother, and you know why. What made you
set the Brownies making koalas, and kangaroos, and
boomerangs, and mia-mias, when you know I said I
wouldn’t be going to Australia this year ?
Alrs Santa i
Well, Santa, we COULD give them to children who
weren’t in Australia.
Santa: t , , , ...,
You know, mother, as well as I do that the children in
cold countries ask for sledges, and dogs, and skates,
and every child wants the things he sees round his own
home. What are we going to do with all these Aus-
tralian things ?


]Vlrs Santa *.
Well, we can’t waste them, Santa. I suppose you will
have to take them to Australia, after all. Just think
how disappointed all the Australian children are going
to be if you don’t go.
Santa i
I THOUGHT that was it. Now, mother, I told you I
didn’t want to go to Australia this year. After all, the
children have mothers and fathers ; it is not as if they
couldn’t have presents at all.
Mrs. Santa :
Every child wants a present from Santa Claus ! And,
besides, what about orphans in homes, who have no
mothers and fathers ?
Santa :
Last time I went to Australia we had a heat wave, and
the reindeer were absolutely worn out, and what with
my beard, and my boots, and thick woollen coat, I
thought it would be the finish of me.
Mrs. Santa :
Now', Santa, be honest ! You know it is nothing to do
with the heat ! Whoever heard of Santa Claus refusing
to visit a hot country, when he knows the children are
waiting for him ?
Santa ;
Well, mother, I told you before. The reindeer were
frightened nearly to death last time, and begged me
never to go there again.
Mbs. Santa ;
But you didn’t promise, Santa ?


Santa :NNo,o —o, I didn't promise.
Mrs. Santa :
( Tip-toeing , and looking all around) What was the
er-bunyip REALLY like, Santa ?
Santa :
Hush ! Well, mother, I couldn’t rightly say, as I didn't
get a proper view myself. It was a moonlight night,
and he howled among the gum trees in the most dismal
manner, and I saw two horrible horns, and two blazing
eyes. Every aborigine, and animal, and bird, fled in
screaming terror. To see the Bunyip is the most
unlucky thing that can happen to anyone in the bush,
you know ! And the reindeer were wild with fear, and
trembled for hours afterwards. I could hardly get
them back home before light.
Mrs. Santa :
Well, Santa, it wouldn’t be likely for you to see the
Bunyip two years running.
Santa :
No —but the reindeer will be expecting to see him every
minute.
Mrs, Santa :
Don’t tell them where you are going Santa.
After all, they have short memories, and they see SO
many places. DO promise to go, Santa, you couldn t
disappoint the children.
S\NTA I
Well, mother, if you have made up your mind, there’s
an end to it, I suppose ! I wouldn’t disappoint you
and the Brownies at all events. I’ll get ready now if
you will see to the packing of the sledge, and send the
Brownies to harness the reindeer.
CURTAIN.


Scene 11.
Outside Santa Claus’ Home. Day before x ™f s -
Wind Music played —Some children enter and do Wind
Dance.
Words
Hark ! the wind is wildly blowing
Blowing everything about.
Watch the clouds so madly flying,
See the people —hear them shout.
Hear the branches, creaking, creaking,
As the wind goes whistling past,
Safer far to turn back homewards,
Make the doors and windows fast.
At end Wind children go out.
Snowflake music played. Children enter and do first Snowflake
Dance.
Words
Little snowflakes falling,
Falling from the sky !
Round you go a-whiriing,
Then you softly lie.
All the ground is covered
With a mantle white,
Little snowflakes resting,
What a lovely sight.
At end of Dance, Snowflakes sink to floor. The Dance
of the Snowflakes is played.
Other children do 2nd Snowflake Dance.


Words
Little snowflakes fluttering,
Fluttering through the air
Till the ground is covered,
Covered everywhere.
Snow, snow, beautiful snow,
Fluttering to the ground below.
At end these children sink down to floor.
Enter Mrs. Santa Claus.
Mrs. Santa : {calls)
Come now, Brownies ! Isn’t the sledge ready ? Bring
in the reindeer.
Brownies bring in children as reindeer , singing and
jingling bells and reins.
Jingle Bells :
“ Jingle Bells, Jingle bells,
Jingle all the way,
Santa Claus is coming soon,
Riding in his sleigh,
Jingle bells, Jingle bells,
Jingle all the way,
Hurrah for dear old Santa Claus,
Hurray for Christmas Day.”
This song is repeated and sung by the Brownies until
they and the reindeer are in position facing forward, in a
line. Brownies are arranged either side of reindeer ,
and hold the reins and jingle them. Reindeer and
Brownies then do Sleigh Bells Dance.


Enter Santa Claus pulling on gloves.
Santa *
Well ! well ! well ! Here we all are ready, harnessed
and prancing. Off we go. Good-bye, mother. Ho
Ho ! Ho ! Good-bye, Brownies {waves).
Reindeer and Santa go off to reindeer music, doing
reindeer rhythm. Mrs. Santa Claus and Brownies
wave to them as they go,
fi Good-bye, Santa, Good-bye ! Good-bye.
CURTAIN .
Scene 111.
Orphanage —Christmas Eve in Australia.
When curtain goes up , children are talking to each other
in groups .
Enter Matron [children turn)
Matron :
Well, children, are you ready ?
Children [in chorus) : Yes, matron.
Matron ; A ~ , .
I do wonder what you have chosen to do to-nignt
Have you decided yet ?
ist Child :
Yes, matron, we are going to have a concert.
Children [in chorus) : An Australian concert.
Child :
We’ve got the programme ready with what we are
going to do, and all our names.
Child :
And we want you to read it out, matron.


Matron (taking paper) :
Um ! I see. Do you really know all these things ?
Child ;
We have them nearly all at school.
Matron :
Well, everyone, take your place.
FIRST ITEM ON THE PROGRAMME.
“ADVANCE, AUSTRALIA FAIR"
Get the flag, Margot !
All the Children Sing :
“ Australia’s sons, let us rejoice
For we are young and free,
We’ve golden soil and wealth for toil
Our home is girt by sea.
Our land abounds in Nature’s gifts,
In beauties rich, and rare,
In history’s page let every stage,
Advance, Australia fair.
In joyful strain then let us sing,
Advance, Australia fair.”
When gallant Cook from Albion sailed,
To trace wide oceans o’er,
True British courage bore him on,
Till he landed on our shore,
And there he raised old England s flag,
The standard of the brave,
With all her faults, we love her still
Britannia rules the wave.
In joyful strain then let us sing,
Advance, Australia fair.”
(At words “ There he raised old England's ” child
with flag raises a Union Jack of 1770 and holds it up
until end of verse).


Matron :
Three cheers for our flag ! ( cheer).
Matron :
Everyone sit down.
(/Is Matron announces items, different children stand
and perform them).
Song; The Gum Trees;
The gum tree lifts its sheltering arms, all silent to the sky,
And through its whispering leaves, the little breezes
flutter by. , . , , , ,
And underneath its leafy shade, the tired bush creatures
lie,
Australia’s bushland tree.
Chorus (for all) :
Glorious gum tree of Australia,
Glorious gum tree of Australia,
Glorious gum tree of Australia,
Australia’s bushland tree.
Dance ; Gum Nut Fairies.
Song : ( The Kangaroos) :
See the kangaroos where they lie,
All grey beneath the moonlit sky,
The joeys hop about close by,
Hoppity, hoppity, hop.
Then the breezes softly blow,
They shake the gum trees to and fro,
The kangaroos get up to go,
Hoppity, hoppity, hop.


Into the pouch joey goes flop,
Mother jumps as if she’d never stop,
They’re all off now with a mighty hop,
Hoppity, hoppity, hop.
As children sing , other children play part of Kangaroos
Recitation :
Dramatic Scene between Mrs. Kangaroo and Joey.
Mother :
Now, little Joey, I’m leaving you here,
Mind you stay hidden and I will be near,
Don’t leave the bushes and wander away,
Dingoes get Joeys if they try to stray.
[Mother hops off to music of Kangaroo Song).
Joey
I’ll only go a little way,
I only want a little play,
And, anyway, why should I stay ?
The sun is warm, it’s a lovely day.
(Joey hops off to music as above).
Mother ( returning) :
Quick little Joey, jump into my pouch,
Under these bushes a moment we’ll crouch,
Don’t be a second, the dingoes are out,
I fear the bunyip is also about.
Why, little Joey, wherever are you ?
Come, what I’ve told you is certainly true.
Get into my pouch, and let’s get away,
No moment to lose —Oh, why did you stray ?
[Looks for him).


Joey (coming back) :
Oh I’m so frightened, oh, where shall I go .
Dingoes are barking, they’ll get me, I know.
Why didn’t I listen —I want Mummie so,
Dingoes are barking, they’ll get me, I know.
Mother ( seeing him) :
Here I am, darling, now jump in my pouch,
Under these bushes a moment we’ll crouch,
Dingoes won’t get us, aw r ay w r e will bound,
By dingoes and Bunyips we 11 never be found.
Song : The Kookaburra.
See the Kookaburra,
Way up in the gum tree,
Listen to his laughter,
As he sings gleefully,
Ha ! ha ! hoo ! hoo ! hee !
Oh ! how the snakes dread him,
Way up in the gum tree,
Soon he’ll swoop and chase them
A-laughing as they flee,
Ha ! ha ! hoo ! hoo ! hee !
Recitation: 1 \ hat I want.
I want to bathe in a billabong,
And to drink billy tea,
In a little mia mia I would live
Like an aborigine.
I'd like to throw a boomerang.
And I would not wear clothes.
I’d like to dance a corroboree,
I’d be black, I suppose.


For the medicine man I then would look
I’d see the magic he makes,
And very jolly it would be,
But I could not eat snakes.
Waratah Song :
Glowing emblem of a southern land,
Lifting your flaming beauty up on high,
Oh, Waratah, you proudly raise your head,
So tall and Crimson, ’neath the Austral sky.
Recitation (The Koala) :
Dear little koala sleeping,
Up in your big gum tree,
Why do you sleep in the day-time ?
I want you to play with me.
Your coat is so grey and snuggly,
Couldn’t I nestle there ?
You only want your baby ?
Well, I don’t call that fair !
And what a funny breakfast !
Only the young gum tree !
You have no tail to swing on ?
Doesn’t seem fun to me.
SONG (The Bunyip) :
The bunyip’s abroad to-night,
I hear him in the bush a-calling.
So into the billabong,
You had better not go a-failing.
If he were to see us here,
He would come after us a-gliding.
What would happen I can’t think,
Let’s quickly creep away in hiding.


Recitation (The Bunyip) :
When all the bush is quietly sleeping,
Why. then it is the bunyip’s out,
And through the bush he comes a-leapmg
Frightening anyone about.
Then everyone awakes a-trembling,
Koala bears shake in their trees.
See kangaroos in groups assembling,
Everyone for miles round - flees.
The kookaburras stop their chaffing,
The bush is silent many a mile,
Save for the bunyip, dancing, laughing,
With horned head and awful smile.
Song (The Wattle) :
O wattle trees a-gleaming,
Golden in the sunlight,
With little balls of yellow,
You make the bush so bright !
Feathery leaves are blowing,
As the wind goes whispering by,
Australia’s flower for ever,
Beneath the southern sky !
Wattle Fairies Dance :
Song ( Christmas Bells) ;
What is it makes the bush so bright
At Christmas time ?
What are those little bells that ring,
And sweetly chime ?
Hark ! How they ring !
Dong ! ding ! dong ! ding !


In town you hear the church bells ring
Yellow and red,
Out in the bush, these Christmas Bells
Chime out instead
Hark ! How they ring !
Dong ! ding ! dong ! ding !

We live in Australia, you know.
It seems a great way for reindeer to come,
But oh ! we do long for you so.
We’re orphans, and so we’ve not any toys,
We’ve nothing with which we can play,
So be sure you’ve got our address,
So the reindeer will not lose the way.

Now, it’s posted. And remember, if you want him

Children {all sing) :
Be very quiet, and be very good,
Sit where you’re sat, and stand where you’re stood,
Take your clothes off, and get into bed,
Don’t fuss or bother or argue instead.
If you don’t do these things, then Santa WON’T come
He’ll just take his reindeer, and off he will run.
But if you are good, and he finds you asleep,
Why, down the chimney he’ll certainly creep.
Matron ;
Now off to bed, the lot of you !

Christmas Present Song (Children sing)
I’ve made a Christmas present,
But it is not for me,
It’s absolutely a secret,
So don’t you try to see !
But I’d really love to give it
To someone very dear,
And though it’s such a secret,
I can’t keep it, I fear.

Now shall we all have our presents

Matron and Santa hand out presents first to children
to give to guests, and then the children s own.
When all are out, everyone sings —

Now our Christmas party s ended,
All the gifts are given away.
Even Santa Claus has vanished
Till another Christmas day.
The candles that once gleamed so brightly,
All are burned away at last.
We now sing “ Good-bye ” in parting,
Now our Christmas Day has passed.
[At above marked line, Santa vanishes).
[CURTAIN).




TWO AUSTRALIAN POEMS
The Australian Bush
and
The Two Launcestons
Beverley Law


The Australian Bush
The great gums stand like sentinels on guaid,
Their arm! outstretched all silent to the sky
Beneath their grateful shade tired creatures lie '
The bush with velvet flannel-flowers is sta
The koala sleeps on eucalyptus tree,
The kangaroos and joeys rest awhile.
The birds of coloured plumages beguile
The scented air with songs both gay and free.
The ferns by many a shaded waterfall
\re dappled with the shadow and the sun.
The woodland scent of moist earth seems to call
The mind to far-off thoughts sometime begun.
\t moments falls an all-invading hush •
All nature harks the burgeoning of the bush.
The Two Launcestons
Launceston in Cornwall and
Launceston in Tasmania, Australia.
Launceston in Cornwall, do you know
With your Norman arch, and castle grey,
That you a British namesake own,
A w hole twelve thousand miles away
Geraniums red are growing there
In blue lobelias just like yours.
Waters of the River Tamar
Are lapping softly on its shores.
over


Launceston there in a valley lies,
With lovely mountains all around,
And looking down at night you see
Twinkling lights in the little town.
On Sunday church bells loudly peal,
The air resounds on every side.
The streets are full of hurrying steps,
Along the shady pavements wide.
Church spires oft are ivy covered,
And one whole hundred years of age.
Launceston in Cornwall, do you laugh ?
Your history goes back many a stage.
A tram runs by the Windmill Hill
Along that High Street set with trees,
Where branches of old English oaks
Are waving softly in the breeze.
Wee part of a vast dominion,
Loyal and British just the same.
But one thing you’d find strange, Launceston
The way people pronounce your name.
