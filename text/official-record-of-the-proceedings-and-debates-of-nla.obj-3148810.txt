NATIONAL AUSTRALASIAN CONVENTION.
REPORT
OF THE COMMITTEE APPOINTED TO CONSIDER
PROVISIONS RELATING TO FINANCE, TAXATION,
AND TRADE REGULATION.
The Committee appointed for the consideration of provisions relating to Finance,
Taxation, and Trade Regulation, who were instructed to specially consider Resolu-
tions Nos. 3 and 4 on Trade and Intercourse and on Customs Taxation, with a view
to their being carried into effect upon lines just to the several Colonies and to lay its
conclusions before the Committee on Constitutional Machinery, Functions, and
Powers, have agreed to the following Resolutions, which they recommend should
be provided for in the proposed Federal Constitution :
1. That immediately on the Federal Constitution coming into operation the
officers connected with such Departments as by the Act come under
Federal control shall become Federal Officers.
2. That all necessary land, buildings, works, and materials connected with the
Departments placed under Federal control shall be taken over by the
Federal Government on terms to be arranged.
3. That until a uniform Tariff comes into force the existing Tariffs shall
continue subject to such modifications thereof as the Legislatures of the
several Colonies may think necessary, and the duties shall continue to be
collected as at present, but by the Federal Officers.
4. That after the establishment of such uniform Tariff the trade and intercourse
between the Federated Colonies, whether by means of internal carriage or
coastal navigation, shall be absolutely free.
5. That after a uniform Tariff has come into operation the surplus revenue
may fairly be distributed amongst the various Colonies according to popu-
lation ; but, as the duties now contributed by the people of the various
Colonies are so unequal, it would be unfair at the present time to distribute
the surplus on this basis; it is therefore recommended that the revenue
from Customs and Excise bo devoted, first, to the payment of all expendi-
ture authorized by the Federal Government, such expenditure to be charged
to the several Colonies according to population; the balance to be returned
to the Colonies in such a way that the amount paid by each Colony for
such Federal expenditure, added to the amount returned, shall be, as nearly
as can be ascertained, the total amount contributed by each Colony on the
dutiable articles consumed.
Q 6.
cliii


G. That besides borrowing money on the public credit for purposes of Federal
Expenditure, and with the view of improving the general credit, and
avoiding complications arising out of the existence of various stocks held
under different conditions, the Federal Parliament should be empowered,
with the consent of the Colonial Parliaments, to adopt a scheme for the
consolidation of the debts of the various Colonies, each Colony being held
separately liable for its proportion of principal and interest.
7. It is estimated that the total expenditure of the Federal Government will
not exceed eleven shillings and fivepence per head of the population, a
large proportion of which will practically be expended on existing services,
the control of which will be transferred to the Federal Government.
8. That the Federal Government should be empowered to legislate on the
following subjects:—
Coastal Beacons, Buoys, and Light-houses.
Navigation and Shipping.
Postal and Telegraphic Systems.
Intercolonial Rivers and the Navigation thereof.
Quarantine.
Military and Naval Defence.
Raising money by any mode or system of taxation for Federal pur-
poses, but all taxation to be uniform throughout the Federation.
Salaries and allowances of the Governor-General and Civil and other
officers of the Federal Government.
Trade and Commerce.
Currency and Coinage.
Banking, Incorporation of Banks, and the Issue of Paper Money.
Bills of Exchange and Promissory-notes.
Legal Tender.
Bankruptcy and Insolvency.
Patents of Inventions, Designs, and Trade-marks.
Copyright.
Weights and Measures.
Appropriation of all moneys raised by the Federal Government.
Your Committee, recognising that one of the main objects of Federation is
freedom of Commercial Intercourse between the Colonies, and that this cannot be
accomplished until a uniform Tariff of Customs and Excise is in force, recommend
that the first business of the Federal Parliament should be the framing and adoption
of such a Tariff.
Your Committee are greatly indebted to Mr. Coghlan, Government Statis-
tician of New South Wales, for the preparation of various returns and statements,
which are appended to this Report.

AND COURT OF APPEAL.

OF THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW ZEALAND,

OBSERVATIONS THEREON BY THE HONORABLE A INGLIS CLARK

PROPOSED AUSTRALIAN COURT OF APPEAL
Mr. Justice Richmond, New Zealand, to The Honorable Sir Henry Parkes,
G.0.M.G., Sydney.
Wellington, New Zealand, 11 March, 1891.
My dear Sir Henry Parkes,
Although I have not had the advantage of a personal introduction to
you, I make no doubt that you will excuse my addressing you on a subject of
interest and importance to the whole of Australasia. It is one of which I may
claim to have some special knowledge, being now in the twenty-ninth year of my
service as a Judge of the Supreme Court of New Zealand, and having previously
had some executive experience as a Colonial Minister. The subject I refer to is the
proposal now made at Sydney to establish an Australian Court of Appeal, whose
decisions shall not be subject to review by the Judicial Committee of Her Majesty’s
Privy Council.
Of course this is at present a mere proposal; and I cannot but think that,
on deliberate consideration, good reason will appear for not insisting upon it.
1. The first and most obvious objection is one which must necessarily have
occurred to yourself, and to any other Statesman who has given the matter a
thought. British capital is, and it is to be hoped will continue to be, largely
invested in these Colonies. It appears, therefore, to be a perfectly reasonable
demand on the part of the mother country, that any British subject feeling himself
aggrieved by the decision on his civil rights of a local Court shall, if the case be of
sufficient importance, have his right of final appeal to an Imperial tribunal. How-
ever fair colonial judges and juries may have shown themselves, it is inevitable that
persons resident in the United Kingdom, or in other Colonies, who should find
themselves worsted in litigation before a Colonial Court from which there was no
appeal, would, in many cases, both feel and express a doubt that justice had not
been done them, and would be ready to impute the decision against them to local
prejudice and favouritism.
It always makes things plainer to give an example of the working of a
principle, and I will, therefore, shortly state a recent case in this Colony. A large
ship, owned by an English shipping company, with a valuable cargo, was lost in
attempting to leave the artificial harbour of Timaru, in the South Island. The
accident was attributed by the company, or its underwriters, to the negligence of an
officer of the Timaru Harbour Board, and an action for damages was accordingly
brought in the name of the company against the Board. The issues of fact were
tried by a Wellington jury, and a verdict was returned for the plaintiffs for about
£40,000, the value of ship and cargo. This, however, was subject to a large
number of reserved points of law, which were subsequently argued before our New
Zealand Court of Appeal. Two judges, out of three who formed the Court,
upheld one of these objections as fatal, and gave judgment setting aside the verdict.
But a considerable proportion of the costs was thrown by our judgment on the
defendant Board as having failed on the main issues of fact. The Shipping Company
appealed, as was* of course expected, to the Privy Council; and Lords Halsbury and
Bramwell sat with the ordinary members of the Judicial Committee to hear the case.
The argument occupied five days. Einally a reserved judgment was given upholding
the decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal on a wider ground than we had
taken, and charging the appellant Company with the entire costs of the proceedings.
Now, in a case of this kind, it is obvious that the result, from a public point of view,
is

is far more satisfactory than it would have been had the plaintiff Company been
compelled to submit to the Colonial decision in favour of the local body as final. It
is more satisfactory to the people of both countries concerned; more satisfactory to
the members of the Colonial tribunal —I should say the same if the decision had been
the other way; more satisfactory even to the defeated litigants —in this respect at
least, that they must feel that justice, so far as attainable in Courts of law, has been
done them.
To quit this part of the subject: It is to he expected that the proposed measure,
if ever carried, must have a prejudicial effect on the financial interests of these
Colonies. The confidence with which investments of all sorts are now made in
Australasia by people at home must be largely due to the knowledge that rights of
property will he dealt with here by the Law Courts on British principles of justice,
and subject to final review by one of the highest English Courts. I conceive that
this confidence must certainly be impaired if we constitute ourselves a foreign
country in regard to the administration of justice.
2. The decisions of a Colonial Court of ultimate appeal would not only give
less satisfaction to an important class of litigants. Such decisions would in all
probability be less satisfactory to litigants in general, and intrinsically less satisfactory.
It is no disrespect to the Australasian Benches to say that the chances are against
our being able to furnish a Court of Appeal equal in legal attainment to the highest
English Courts. Of course we may produce great jurists here ; and, please God, we
shall. But the present area of selection for the Bench is a very narrow one. English
Judges, on the other hand, are taken from amongst the leaders of a numerous Bar.
They have had their ability tested in practice at the greatest business centre in the
world, and have succeeded in a competition with which the Colonies have nothing
to compare. The composition in late years of the Judicial Committee may not have
been entirely satisfactory—on that subject I have a word to say —but important
appeals to the Queen-in-Council are generally attended by some of the most eminent
English Judges.
8. It would be a dead loss to both Bench and Bar if the legal standard to
which we have now to submit ourselves were removed —as in great measure it would
be, were decisions here rendered final. I should be sorry to see the judgments of
lawyers reared in our comparatively narrow circle become our most important
authorities. I say this, fully recognising the excellence of much judicial work
amongst us. The public is more interested than it knows in maintaining the highest
scientific standard in the administration of the law. The intellectual interest thus
created in the profession is one of the best guarantees for purity of administration.
Thorough-bred lawyers are supremely anxious to be right in their law. They may
not always succeed in freeing themselves from class prejudices and party ties; but
their interest in abstract law makes them generally incapable of showing favour to
individuals.
4. The establishment of Colonial precedents as paramount, would lead to
divergencies from the law of the mother-country which would be productive of
considerable inconvenience; nor could Colonial judgments be entitled to the same
favourable reception in the Courts of the mother-country as they now meet with.
6. A very important consideration is the following: —In every Colony
possessing a Constitution the Legislature is exercising powers created by a statute
of the Imperial Parliament. Its powers are limited by this document, and the
document is subject to the interpretation of the Courts of law of the country. The
Supreme Court of each of these Colonies has jurisdiction to decide that a Colonial
Act is ultra vires. The power has actually been exercised in this Colony in the case
of an Act for deporting fugitive offenders, it being held that the General Assembly
of New Zealand is incompetent to provide for the custody of such persons during
their passage over-sea to another Colony. The difficulty has since been removed by
Imperial legislation. Now, it is evident that if the integrity of the Empire is to be
maintained (which is our common object), the decision of a local Court in regard to
the powers of the local Parliament ought to be subject to review by an Imperial
Court. Otherwise, all limit to the local power of legislation might be disregarded,
and practically set aside, by Judges with strong separatist tendencies.
cxcii


6. It may appear paradoxical, but in point of fact the Australian Courts
themselves will be degraded by the proposed measure. They will sink from the
position of Imperial to mere local tribunals, with, I apprehend, a corresponding
contraction of their present jurisdiction, and, in the future, a probable diminution of
judicial independence. To illustrate my meaning I will again cite a recent pro-
ceeding in this country. A few years ago a gentleman resident in Samoa was
forcibly removed from that island by Sir Arthur Gordon, then Her Majesty’s High
Commissioner for the Western Pacific, who supposed himself to be exercising powers
conveyed by the Order in Council constituting his office. The person so dealt with,
conceiving 'himself aggrieved, brought an action for wrongful arrest and imprison-
ment against Sir Arthur in the Supreme Court of New Zealand, both parties being
then in the Colony. Commissions to take evidence in Samoa and in London were
issued and executed. It was understood that Sir Arthur was defended by the
British Treasury; and the present Mr. Justice A. L. Smith, of the English High
Court of Justice, acted as his counsel on the execution of the Commission in London.
No objection was taken on behalf of the defendant to the jurisdiction of the New
Zealand Court. No doubt this was on the ground, established in the leading case of
Mostyn v. Falrigas, and other cases, that a British subject may be sued for damages
in any British Court within whose jurisdiction he is found for a personal wrong done
to another British subject in any part of the world. But such a jurisdiction is one
which cannot belong to a merely Local Court. Supposing that it could in law
survive the contemplated alteration, it is plain that the British Parliament could
not allow it to remain. It may be asked: What loss would that be to the Colony ?
I maintain that it would be a real loss. For by the existence of such a jurisdiction
the remedy for injustice and oppression in this quarter of the globe is made more
prompt and easy. The dignity of the tribunal exercising so high a function is
enhanced. The unity of the Empire is affirmed in a striking manner. To destroy
such a jurisdiction would be an act of separatism and a degredation of our Courts.
If this view is regarded by anyone as sentimental I would observe that it is exactly
by the prevalence of such sentiments, if at all, that the Unity of the Empire can be
maintained.
In Sir Arthur Gordon’s case the decision was, on the main point, favourable
to the defendant, the question being one of law, but judgment went against him for
a small sum. There was no appeal lodged. The plaintiff, it is said, would have
appealed had his means permitted. The British Government acquiesced in the
decision.
One point more in this connexion : I believe Sir Arthur Gordon, though still
in the Colony, was no longer Governor when the writ in the action against him was
served. But, had he been Governor, it is established by the case of Musgrave v.
Pulidos before the Privy Council [Law Reports 5, Appeal Cases 102] that he would
none the less have been liable to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the
Colony. Such a Court has, under our present constitutions, the right of determining
whether any act of power done by a Governor is within the limits of his authority.
Evidently this high jurisdiction could not continue to be exercised by a Colonial
Court whose decisions were not subject to appeal.
7. No doubt it will be said that the expense and delay of appeals to London
are great. Ido not pretend to be able to speak with certainty upon these points.
But it may be questioned whether in either respect there need be much difference
between appeals to the Judicial Committee and appeals to the proposed new Court.
Distances in Australia are great, and the local lawyers would seldom be content to
leave their appeals in the hands of the Bar of the city where the Court happened to
sit. Hence a large outlay in travelling expenses would be apparently inevitable.
As regards delay it would not, I apprehend, be found practicable at present to
appoint special Justices of ApjDeal to sit continuously. The Court must be formed
by the attendance of members of the existing Benches, and could only sit periodi-
cally, as is our practice in New Zealand; these, however, are points on which Ido
not venture to express any positive opinion.
At pi*esent the Judicial Committee appears to be overloaded with work. If
the committee wants strengthening in point of numbers so as to be able to sit in
two or more divisions, the British Parliament is bound to find the means. Indian

appeals which seem to take up a great deal of time might, one would think, he dealt
with by a separate division. There can he no good reason why appeals should not
he much accelerated.
S. Although several eminent judges have been amongst those who regularly
sit on the Judicial Committee, the Court has not maintained the extraordinary
authority it had with the profession during the years when Lord Kingsdown
commonly presided over it. Looking to the present importance of the Colonies, and
I venture to say, to the learning of colonial lawyers, it is not satisfactory that any
hut the most eminent in the profession should sit as Judges of Appeal from Colonial
Courts. It is unfortunate that the attempt to constitute a single Court of Appeal
for the whole empire did not succeed. The Colonies have, I conceive, a right to
ask that the ultimate appeal from colonial decisions shall he to the same tribunal,
whether the House of Lords, or some Court to he substituted for the House of Lords,
as deals with appeals from the English Courts.
9. But to sum up: whatever may he the defects of existing arrangements,
they are such as appear to he remediable without extraordinary difficulty. Even
taking things as they are, we shall he wise, I conceive, not to seek a change open
to objections such as I have endeavoured to state —objections which seem even more
important and significant in a political point of view than in one purely juridical.
I remain, &c.,

P.S. —As I desire the fullest and most public discussion of the subject of this
letter, I need scarcely say that you are at_ liberty to deal with it in any way you

Observations on the letter of Mr. Justice Richmond to Sir Henry Parkes,
G.C.M.G., on the proposal to establish a Federal Court of Appeal for Australasia,
and to abolish Appeals from Australasian Courts to the Privy Council.
1. The reference made by Mr. Justice Richmond to the case which occurred
in New Zealand, and in respect of which an appeal was carried from the New
Zealand Court of Appeal to the Privy Council seems to me to be only available as
an' argument against making the Supreme Courts of the several Australasian
Colonies Courts of final resort, but is not a valid argument against the erection of a
Federal Court of Appeal, to take the place of the Privy Council, as a final Court of
Appeal for Australasia. If a Federal Court of Appeal is established there will be,
as now, an appeal from the Supreme Courts of the several Colonies to a superior
tribunal, and the real question at issue is whether the Federal Court of Appeal
would prove as satisfactory a tribunal of final resort as the Privy Council, and this
question is not touched by"Mr. Justice Richmond’s reference to the case which he
mentions.
2. The second objection assumes that the Judges of the Federal Court of
Appeal will necessarily be inferior in experience and ability to the members of the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, but when it is remembered that the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council consists of fifteen members of varying
capacity and attainments, three of whom form a quorum, and that many decisions
are given by a bare quorum, and many other decisions by a Court consisting of not
more than five members, it will be seen that we cannot rely upon having, at all
times, in a quorum or minority of the Privy Council, a Court consisting of Judges
superior to any Judges in Australasia. If all appeals from the judgments of Aus-
tralasian Courts to the Privy Council were heard and determined by a Court con-
sisting of all or even a majority of its members, Mr. Justice Richmond’s second
objection would have much more force.
3. The third objection appears to me to have been made in forgetfulness
of the fact that the Federal Court of Appeal will be constituted of Judges drawn
from all the Australasian Colonies, and will therefore embrace and concentrate the
legal ability and varied legal experience of the several Colonies, and that the Court
will therefore be a much superior tribunal to anything of the kind which we have
yet had in Australasia, and, further, that the varied appellate work which it would
be called on to perform would give to the members of it that larger experience and
practice, the want of which Mr. Justice Richmond appears to regard as the chief
disqualification of the present Supreme Courts of the several Colonies to be made
Courts of Final Appeal.
4. The fourth objection, that there would necessarily be divergencies in the
decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal and the decisions of the Privy Council,
appears to me not well founded, because we find that the Supreme Court of
America in its decisions on matters of mercantile law and its application of the
fundamental principles of the common law, nearly always coincides with the deci-
sions of the House of Lords and of the Privy Council. In the instances in which
the Supreme Court of America has diverged from the decisions of the Superior
Courts in England local circumstances have required and justified the divergence ;
and we might fairly expect that any divergence which might arise in the decisions
of the Federal Court of Appeal in Australasia from the decisions of the Superior
Courts in England would be similarly required and justified by varying local
exigencies.
5. The fifth objection appears to me to be based, like the first, upon the
assumption that the decisions of the Supreme Court in each Colony would be final,
and in forgetfulness of the fact that the proposal is not to abolish appeals but to
transfer them to a Federal Court of Appeal instead of taking them to the Privy
Council.
cxcv


6. I am unable to see the force of the sixth objection, and do not concur
with Mr. Justice Eichmond’s conclusion that upon the establishment of a Federal
Court of Appeal our local Courts would cease to have jurisdiction in such cases as
those mentioned by him.
7. The seventh objection is not directed against the establishment of a
Federal Court of Appeal, but is an argument for the reconstruction of the Privy
Council.
8. The eighth objection is an argument for the erection of a Court of Appeal
for the whole Empire instead of having two distinct Courts of Appeal in the House
of Lords and in the Privy Council, as at the present time, and does not appear to
mo to touch the question of the establishment of a Court of Appeal for Australasia.
9. The ninth argument amounts simply to the statement that a-better state
of things than at present exists in regard to appeals in England should be brought
about.

1891.
OFFICIAL RECORD OF THE DEBATES
OF THE
NATIONAL AUSTRALASIAN CONVENTION
HELD IN THE PARLIAMENT HOUSE, SYDNEY
NEW SOUTH WALES.
MONDAY, 2 MARCH, 1891.
Roll of Delegates—President —Secretary—Standing Orders,
Ac.—Vice-President —Adjournment: Western Australian
Delegates.
The Delegates met in the Legislative Assembly
Chamber, Sydney, at 11 o’clock a.m.
BOLL OF DELEGATES.
Mr. MUNEO : At the Conference held in Mel-
bourne, in 1890, the following resolutions were agreed
to :
1. That, in the opinion of this Conference, the best interests
and the present and future prosperity of the Australian
colonies will be promoted by an early union under the
Crown ; and, while fully recognising the valuable
services of the members of the Convention of 1883
in founding the Federal Council, it declares its opinion
that the seven years which have since elapsed have
developed the national life of Australia in population,
in wealth, in the discovery of resources, and in self-
governing capacity to an extent which justifies the
higher act, at all times contemplated, of the union of
these colonies, under one legislative and executive
Government on principles just to the several colonies.
2. That to the union of the Australian colonies contem-
plated by the foregoing resolution, the remoter Aus-
tralasian colonies shall be entitled to admission at
such times and on such conditions as may be hereafter
agreed upon.
3. That the members of the Conference should take such
steps as may be necessary to induce the legislatures of
their respective colonies to appoint, during the present
year, delegates to a National Australasian Convention,
empowered to consider and report upon an adequate
scheme for a federal constitution.
4. That the Convention should consist of not more than
seven members from each of the self-governing
colonies, and not more than four members from each
of the Crown colonies. -
5. That the Premier of Victoria be requested to act as
convener of the National Australasian Convention of
delegates to be appointed by the several legislatures of
the Australasian colonies, and to arrange, upon con-
sultation with the premiers of the other colonies, the
time and place of the meeting of the Convention.
Pursuant to that authority I bad the honor to com-
municate with the premiers of the other colonies, and
fixed the place of meeting as this Legislative Assembly,
Sydney, and the time as the 2nd of March, at II
o’clock, a.m. Accordingly, I have issued circulars to
the delegates from the several colonies, which I
have no doubt they have received. I have received
letters from the prime ministers of the various
colonies, informing me of the names of the delegates
appointed for each colony, which letters I now lay on
the table, including one from the Governor of Fiji,
announcing that that colony would not be represented
unless instructions to that effect were received from
Her Majesty’s Government. I have had a parchment
roll prepared, in alphabetical order, of the different
colonies, the names of the delegates of each colony
to occupy a page in the roll. The names are printed
on one side, and each delegate, as his name is called,
will be good enough to sign opposite his name* I
wish to inform the delegates also, that in addition to
the roll that is to be kept as a record of the proceed-
ings, I have taken the liberty of having had printed
a number of other rolls, so that one copy may be
given to each colony as a record of this important
meeting. I shall only request the delegates to sign
one copy at present ; the other copies may be signed
at their pleasure. I shall first read over the names
of the delegates for each colony, and then I will call
upon them in rotation to sign the roll. I have had
the names put in the roll in the order in which they
appear in the resolutions of the various parliaments:—

Mcllwraitb, K.C.M.G., LL.D., M.P., Queensland;
the Honorable Henry John Wrixon, Q.C., M.P.,

Australia.
Mr. MUNRO : I find that the absentees are Sir
George Grey, K.C.8., the Honorable Sir Thomas
Mcllwraitb, K.C.M.G., M.P., and the Honorable
H. J. Wrixon, Q.C., M.P. In this connection I
desire to intimate that a resolution was passed by
the Parliament of Victoria—and I believe a similar
one has been passed by the Parliament of New South
Wales —empowering the Governor in Council to
appoint a Member of the Legislative Council, or of
the Legislative Assembly, as the case may be, to be
a representative of the colony at the Convention
should a vacancy occur. The resolution to which I
refer is in these terms :
That during the absence of any representative of this
colony on the National Convention to be held iu
Sydney in March, 1891, or in the event of any vacancy
by death, resignation, or otherwise on such representa-
tion, the Governor, with the advice of the Executive
Council, is hereby empowered to appoint a Member of
the Legislative Council or the Legislative Assembly, as
the case may be, to act as representative of this colony
on such Convention, or to fill such vacancy.
In the absence of the Honorable 11. J. Wrixon, one
of the representatives of Victoria, the Honorable AV.
Shiels, Attorney-General, has received a Commission
under the seal of the colony, issued by the Governor,
authorising him to take a seat iu the Convention
during the absence of any member. I was requested
to bring this matter before the Convention, as the
Honorable H. J. Wrixon is now absent.
The Honorable AV. Shiels entered the Chamber
subsequently, and subscribed the roll on behalf of the
Honorable H. J. AVrixon.
PRESIDENT.
Mr. MUNRO rose to move, —
That the Honorable Sir Henry Parkes, G.C.M.G., Premier
of New South Wales, do take the Chair as President
of this National Australian Federation Convention.
He said: I think this is a fitting honor to confer
upon the author of the movement on the part of
these Australian colonies, which resulted in the Con-
ference held in Melbourne last year. The hon.
gentleman has taken a deep interest in the subject of
federation for a great number of years, and we more-
over meet in the colony of which he has the honor to
be the Premier. I have no doubt that in the position
of President he will aid us with his counsel and
advice, and that his occupancy of the chair will reflect
credit upon our proceedings. Under these circum-
stances I do not think we can do better than elect
him to the position. Of course it is distinctly under-
stood that as President of this Convention he will
occupy a position different from that of the Speaker
of a legislative assembly or the President of a legis-
lative council; that he will be at liberty to take part in
our debates as he may think proper, and that he will
also be free to vote. These matters, however, will, I
have no doubt, be dealt with in our standing orders,
which, I believe, will be passed at a subsequent sit-
ting of the Convention.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : 1 have much pleasure
in rising to second the motion made by Mr. Munro.
If the circumstances were altogether equal, there is no
doubt that Sir Henry Parkes would be designated, in
accordance with universal custom, as well as official
courtesy, as the proper person to preside over this
Convention, seeiug that it is held in IS ew South AVales,
of which colony he is the Prime Minister. But the
circumstances are not equal. No gentleman here,
I think, will feel himself disparaged when I remind
the Convention that Sir Henry Parkes is, in point of
years and experience, more eminently qualified than
any of us for the position. He has had, I believe, a
larger official experience than has any other man in
Australia; he has been at the head of the Government
of New South AVales longer than any other man in
the Colony ; and he has taken a great interest in the
subject of federation for many years. He is the
immediate author of the present movement All
possible argument conduces to show that he is the
proper person to fill the chair of this Convention. I
am sure, however, that the hon. gentleman would
hesitate to accept the position if he were debarred from
speaking, and that we, also, should hesitate to place
him in the chair if that step were to have the effect
of closing his mouth. This being understood, we
shall be glad to look to him for advice and assistance,
and to see him adorning the chair.
Mr. PLAYFORD : I am glad to support the pro-
posal that Sir Henry Parkes do take the chair on the
present occasion; but I trust that his olection to that
position will in no way prevent him from taking an
active part in the discussions that will follow, and
that it will not prevent him from moving resolutions,
because we are looking forward to his initiating the
proceedings, and bringing before us certain proposals.
The hon. gentleman was the originator of the Con-
ference that was held in Melbourne last year, and I am
certain that we delegates representing the various
Australian colonies look to him to bring before us
resolutions for our discussion. I trust, therefore,
that the hon. gentleman's occupancy of the chair will
not prevent him from taking that active part in the
proceedings which we have all anticipated. 1" agree
with Sir Samuel Griffith that there is no gentleman
in the Australian colonies more deserving of the
honor of occupying the position of President on this
important occasion. I have much pleasure in sup-
porting the proposal.
Mr. FYSH: I desire, on the part of Tasmania,
to congratulate Sir Henry Parkes upon the arrival
of to-day, and trust that he will be unanimously
chosen President of this great Convention, and that
to the very many important acts of his life there will
be added that which, I believe, will prove to bo the
most important arising out of duties devolving upon
him at this Convention. I trust that the hon. gentle-
man will be preserved in exceedingly good health, and
that all the faculties of which he is possessed will be
exerted in the course of this Convention with the
hon. gentleman's accustomed energy and vivacity ;
and that we shall have in him, as our President, that
which we fully expect —an able mind for the conduct
of these important proceedings. I congratulate the
hon. gentleman upon his accession to the chair, and
have great pleasure in supporting the resolution.
Mr. DIBBS : In view of the unanimous expression
of opinion from the Premiers of the neighbouring
colonies that Sir Heni*y Parkes should take the
chair of this Convention, I, as one of the delegates
of New South AVales, cannot refrain from expressing
the pleasure we feel in finding that unanimity to pre-
vail ; and our pride in the fact of our Premier being


invited to fill so high a position. AVe look to Sir
Henry Parkes as, to a certain extent, the architect of
the structure we are about to build, and we, like other
gentlemen present, look to our Premier for advice
and explanation, and hope that he will in due time
place before us such a programme as will enable us to
proceed with the great work before us. I can assure
non. gentlemen that we appreciate the compliment
paid to the colony through our Premier, and, person-
ally, I have great pleasure in supporting the proposition
which has been made.
Captain RUSSELL: Perhaps, as a representative
of the most remote of the Australasian colonies, I
may be permitted in the name of New Zealand to
say with what pleasure I have heard Sir Henry Parkes
proposed as chairman of this great Convention. It
has been said that there is no man more suitable than
is Sir Henry Parkes for the position to which I hope
wo shall shortly unanimously elect him; but I go
further, and say that there is no man one-half so
suitable. "Whether we view him as Prime Minister
of the mother colony of Australia, or in his private
capacity as the most venerable member of this Con-
vention, or whether, on the other hand, one reflects
that his experience in political life is perhaps greater
than that of many of us put together, we must all
agree that there is no man so fitted for the position.
This is the mother colony of Australia, and from the
great figure presented to the more remote colonies
of Australasia in Sir Henry Parkes, we are, perhaps,
able to judge him more dispassionately than are the
Australian colonies proper. I feel that, having
regard to the position which the hon. gentleman has
occupied in Australia, he will fittingly crown this,
the summit of his life, in becoming the President of
a Convention which must be celebrated in the world’s
history for all time to come. I have pleasure, on
behalf of New Zealand, in saying that we look forward
with pleasure to the hon. gentleman occupying the
position of President of this Convention.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
The President elect, being conducted to the
chair by the Honorable James Munro and the
Honorable Sir Samuel Griffith, said : Mr. Munro,
Sir Samuel Griffith, and hon. gentlemen, I could not
under any circumstances do other than yield to your
unanimous choice. I am very conscious indeed of
my many disqualifications for the office of President.
It is hardly in my nature to observe that studied
decorum which is so shining a quality in the chair.
I have not been fitted for that situation in life. I
therefore feel how great the honor is to be placed in
that position on this great occasion and by this great
body. 1 shall trust to that generous unanimity which
has prevailed in carrying'this motion to support me
in discharging in the chair duties which may become
onerous, and 1 am quite sure I shall not trust in vain.
I am certain the feeling which has been exercised in
placing me here will be further exercised, if need be,
to pardon my inefficiency, and that it will give me
all the moral support that can be shown to the high
position I am called to occupy. Having said this
much, it becomes my duty to give this assurance, that
so far as I know myself, I will command myself to
do the duties of this chair so that there shall be no
cause of complaint. I will try to so conduct the
business as to offend none, and, if possible, secure
the good opinion wTiich appears to have been formed
to-day. I thank hon. gentlemen for the great dis-
tinction you have conferred upon me, and I trust
none of you will see cause to regret the vote you
have given.
SECRETARY.
Mr. MUNRO: I think the motion I have now the
honor to submit will conclude my business at this
stage of the proceedings. I have tne honor to move:
Tliat Frederick William Webb, Esq., be appointed Secretary
to the Convention.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I second tlie motion.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
STANDING ORDERS, &c.
Mr. McMILLAN: It will be necessary, for the
orderly conduct of business during the sittings of the
Convention, to give notice of certain formal motions
for to-morrow. That I now do.
VICE-PRESIDENT.
Mr. PLATFORD; I beg to move :
That Sir Samuel Walker Griffith, K.C.M.G., bo appointed
Vice-President of the Convention.
Mr. FYSH: I have exceeding pleasure in second-
ing the proposal of Mr. Playford, in recognition of
the services I am pleased to know will already be re-
cognised as having been rendered to the cause of
federation by Sir Samuel Griffith in connection with
his Vice-Presidency of the Federal Council. I am
pleased to witness his accession to a similar position
in conjunction with yourself, sir, or when, on any
special occasion you may not be prepared to take the
chair. lam glad that there is a prospect of the hon.
gentleman being called to the Vice-Presidency of this
Convention as a fitting recognition of the work which
ho has already done in the cause of federation, and as
a recognition of the work which we feel him to be
well able to do in connection with the important duty
upon which we are now engaged.
Mr. MUNRO: I have great pleasure in supporting
the motion. It is necessary that we should have a
Vice-President to assist the President, and to act on
occasions on -which the President may find it incon-
venient to attend the Convention. I have already
had some experience of Sir Samuel Griffith as Presi-
dent on other occasions, and he then discharged his
duties in so admirable a manner that I shall bo glad
to see him occupying the chair in the unavoidable
absence of the President.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I was not aware until
a minute or two ago that it was proposed to confer
this honor upon me. I am deeply grateful to the
hon. gentlemen who have proposed to appoint mo
Vice-President of the Convention, and to those who
supported the proposal to do me this great honor.
I shall be very glad to relieve you, sir, when you are
unable to continue in the chair; but I hope that, for
the greater part at least of the sittings of the Con-
vention, you will be able to occupy it. I should
certainly hesitate to occupy it myself, even in your
absence, if I were debarred from taking part in the
deliberations of the Convention. There is much work
to be done, and although I hope there may be no
occasion for long speeches, there will be times when
many of us will think it necessary to say something.
I thank hon. gentlemen again for the honor they
have done mo.
ADJOURNMENT.
WESTERN AUSTRALIAN DELEGATES.
Mr. McMILLAN rose to move:
That the Convention do now adjourn until half-past 2
o’clock to-morrow.
He said: There seems to be a general desire that
there should be no sitting to-morrow morning, and
that business of which notice has been given this
morning should be disposed of to-morrow afternoon.
The probability is that little other business will bo
done to-morrow. In making this motion, I am, I
presume, acting in a way that will be acceptable to
hon. gentlemen of this Convention. If any other
suggestion can be made I shall be quite willing to fall
in with it if a majority desire; but I have consulted
with a few members of the Convention, and the
general opinion, I understand, is that w r e ought to
adjourn until half-past 2 o’clock to-morrow.


The President : I think, before a motion of so
much importance as that is put, I might intimate
what I deem is the general wish of hon. gentlemen—
that to-morrow morning be used for the purpose of
an informal meeting of delegates to compare views
and to enter into conversation before the serious
business of the Convention really begins. I think
gentlemen will see the advantage of that from every
point of view. I believe that is the intention, and
I imagine that after we have adjourned now, I shall
be authorised to arrange a meeting of that kind
before the Convention enters upon the real business
it has to undertake. 1 think it is right to give that
intimation, in case any gentlemen should feel disposed
to dissent from it.
Mr. MUNRO : I second the motion.
Mr. DIBBS: Before the motion is put, I should
like to say a few words as to the position in which
we find ourselves. The Western Australian delegates,
through the force of inevitable circumstances, not
being present, I venture to suggest that no actual
business bo transacted by this Convention before
they have an opportunity to be present. We might
proceed with the preliminary business, such as the
formal motions of which notice has been given by
Mr. McMillan, and the President might deliver his
inaugural address ; but wo should extend the utmost
courtesy to the representatives of Western Australia
to enable them to be here before any actual business
results are arrived at. 1 believe these gentlemen
can arrive by Friday morning.
Mr. Munro : Saturday !
Mr. DIBBS: Well, even if they cannot arrive
until Saturday, I think business should be postponed,
or we shall be placed in a very awkward position,
because we should either have to go back upon our
procedure, or invite the representatives of Western
Australia to join in what has been done. The Presi-
dent’s address will, I presume, foreshadow what
should be done, and the manner in which it should
bo done. The whole programme, in fact, will be
submitted to us, and probably there will be con-
siderable discussion; but I think any definite deter-
mination should be deferred until our absent friends
can be present, especially when we consider that
Western Australia has but just become possessed of
responsible government. 1 ask hon. gentlemen to
give some consideration to this question, so that when
we meet to-morrow it may be determined whether we
P- oceed to business in the absence of the representa-
tives of Western Australia, or whether we shall afford
them time to be present.
Mr. MUNRO : I might be allowed to offer a word
of explanation. As the convener I was in communi-
cation with all the colonies, and with the consent of
the different colonies I postponed the holding of the
first meeting until the 2nd March, to meet the wishes
particularly of the representatives of Western Aus-
tralia. All the other colonies wanted to have the
meeting very much earlier. Then when it came to
within a week of the time for the meeting I received
a telegram from the Premier of Western Australia,
asking that the Convention should be postponed for
a fortnight to enable them to get their business
through and be present. I then put myself in com-
munication with the premiers of the other colonies,
including New Zealand, and found that it was the
almost unanimous wish of the delegates that no post-
ponement should take place. I then communicated
with the representatives of Western Australia,
informing them that it was impossible to postpone
the meeting of the Convention. I venture to suggest
to Mr. Dibbs that we are here as delegates from the
various colonies at a considerable amount of incon-
venience to ourselves and the Governments we
represent. And whilst I am exceedingly anxious
that every courtesy should be shown to the repre-
sentatives of Western Australia, I do not think it
wise, after we have deliberated over the matter and
come to the conclusion to meet on the 2nd March,
to postpone the transaction of business for another
week ; I am afraid we could not afford to do it.
I am willing that we should not pass any serious
resolutions until the delegates from Western Aus-
tralia arrive; I believe they will be here on Friday
or Saturday. If we were to postpone our business
until their arrival we should be departing from the
understanding arrived at that we should be here on
the 2nd March, and proceed with business as early
as possible. I have no doubt that the Aveek will be
taken up with the consideration of preliminary
matters. Ido not think we ought to formally post-
pone the business on account of the Western Aus-
tralian delegates not being here, because of the
absolute necessity of our proceeding with as much
expedition as possible.
Mr. BAKER: I venture to suggest, with regard to
one difficulty, that if Ave do anything to Avhich the
Western Australian delegates object, Ave can easily
reconsider the matter when they arrive. In the
meantime Ave may do a great many things to which
they will not object.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Convention adjourned at 121 p.m.
TUESDAY, 3 MARCH, 1891.
Motions by Concurrence —Days of Meeting—Minutes of Pro-
ceedings—Notices of Motion —Rules of Debate—Rules of
Debate in Committee— Official Record of Debates —
Divisions —Admission of the Press and Public.
The President took the Chair at half-past 2
o’clock, p.m.
MOTIONS BY CONCURRENCE.
Mr. McMILLAN: I have to move a series of
resolutions, most of which are formal, and I intend
to add one at the end with regard to the quorum, and
then one in reference to the question, which will have
to be determined by the delegates, of the Chairman
of Committees. I understand there is some difference
of opinion with regard to this latter point, but
probably that motion and the one with regard to the
quorum can be taken with concurrence, without the
ordinary notice.
DAYS OF MEETING.
Motion (by Mr. McMillan) proposed:
That, unless otherwise ordered, the Convention shall meet
daily (Sundays excepted) at 11 o’clock a m. punctually.
Mr. ABBOTT : I should like to know whether it
is intended that the Convention shall sit on Saturdays,
and if so, whether for the whole or half of the day ?
So far as I am personally concerned, I am quite
willing to make my time suit the time of the delegates
from the other colonies
Mr. Dibbs : And sit even on Sundays !
Mr. ABBOTT: Yes, and sit even on Sundays, if
it would suit those gentlemen; but perhaps they
themselves would not care about assembling here on
Saturdays. I should like to hear some expression of
opinion from the delegates from the other colonies.
Mr. MUNEO ; In the event of the Convention
not wishing to sit on Saturday on any occasion, they
can easily carry out their intention by passing a
resolution of vvhich notice may be given the day
before. I think it would be as well to carry the
motion as it stands, because it will enable us to meet
on Saturday if we think proper to do so, it being
understood that we do meet on Saturday unless
otherwise ordered.
Sir JOHN DOWNER: I take the same view as
the last speaker ; but I think it should not bo
necessary to give notice of motion in the event of
our considering it inexpedient to sit on Saturday.
There would be nothing inconsistent with the


motion, as submitted if a member were allowed to
move on Friday that we adjourn until Monday.
Sir SAML T EL GRIFFITH: As a member of the
Convention who has a good deal of work to do
besides that connected with the Convention, I venture
to express a hope that we shall not sit on Saturdays,
because I am certain that in my case one day in the
week will be absolutely necessary to enable me to get
through other work that must be done. I do not
offer any objection to the resolution being passed in
its present form j but I hope the Convention will not
insist upon sitting on Saturdays.
The President : I would suggest that perhaps it
would be better to amend the motion by inserting tho
words “ Saturdays and” before the word “ Sundays.”
Mr. McMillan: I accept the suggestion of tho
President.
Motion so amended, and agreed to.
MINUTES OF PROCEEDINGS.
Resolved (on motion by Mr. McMillan) :
That the secretary to the Convention shall take minutes of
each day’s proceedings, which shall be printed and
circulated amongst the delegates; that such official
record of the proceedings be signed by the President and
secretary; and that the secretary be authorised to
make such record public, together with notices of
motions to be submitted to the Convention.
NOTICES OF MOTION.
Motion (by Mr. McMillan) proposed:
That previous notice, in writing, shall be given at a sitting
of the Convention of all motions to be submitted by the
delegates, and that all notices of motions shall be
printed and circulated daily amongst the delegates.
Mr. PLAYFORD: Of course we are to understand
that this will not prevent a delegate from moving a
motion without notice with the consent of a majority
of members ?
Mr. McMillan : No; a motion can be made with
concurrence!
Sir JOHN BRAY: I would suggest to the mover
that it would be desirable to insert the words “ unless
otherwise ordered,” because an occasion may arise
when it may be desirable to move a motion without
notice, and if this resolution w r ere literally inter-
preted, that would be impossible. I beg to move as
an amendment:
That after the word “ That ” the words “ unless o herwise
ordered ” be inserted.
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS: What is the object of
the amendment ? These are merely sessional orders
subject to the rules of the House of Commons, and
therefore it would be surplusage to put in the w r ords
“ unless otherwise ordered,” because the Convention
can always order it, and the insertion of the words
would bo an absurdity. The motion, as it stands, is
perfectly regular, and is in accordance with bue rules
of Parliament. The proposed amendment will not
be in accordance with tho rules of Parliament, and
it is quite unnecessary.
Amendment agreed to; motion, as amended, agreed
to.
RULES OF DEBATE.
Motion (by Mr. McMillan) proposed :
That in the debates of the Convention, the ordinary rules
of the House of Commons be observed; but that the
President or Vice-President, as the case may be, have
the same right as any other delegate to take part in the
discussion of any question.
Sir JOHN DOAVNER: I think this motion will
require a little amendment. We understand that
the President is to move a motion in the Convention
to-morrow, and if the resolution is carried in its
present form it may raise some question as to whether
such a proceeding will be strictly in order. I there-
fore beg to move, as an amendment:
That the words, “to make any motion and ” be inserted
after the word “ delegate,” line 4.
Amendment agreed to; motion, as amended, agreed to.
RULES OF DEBATE IN COMMITTEE.
Motion (by Mr. McMillan) proposed :
That in Committee the rules of debate observed in Com-
mittees of the Whole in Parliament be adopted by the
Convention ; but that the President or Vice-President,
as the case may be, have the same right as any other
delegate to take part in the discussion of any question.
Sir John Downer: I think it would be better lo
insert the same words in this motion also.
Mr. McMillan : I accept the suggestion.
Motion so amended and agreed to.
OFFICIAL RECORD OF DEBATES.
Resolved (on motion by Mr. McMillan) :
That an official record of the debates in the Convention be
made by the Parliamentary Reporting Staff of this
Colony,
DIVISIONS.
Motion (by Mr. McMillan) proposed:
That in any divisions taken in the Convention the President
or Vice-President, as the case may be, have the right
to vote and in case of an equality of votes exercise a
second or casting vote ; and that the names of the
delegates be printed in alphabetical order, without
reference to the Colonies which they represent.
Mr. PLAYFORD: I think that in this case we
are altogether departing from the usual parliamentary
practice, which is certainly not to give the President
or the Speaker a deliberative as well as a casting vote.
My own idea is that if the votes are so equal as to
call for the casting vote of the President the question
should pass in the negative. I, therefore, ask the
mover to strike out all reference to the President or
Vice-President having a deliberative as well as a cast-
ing vote. In order to take the sense of the Conven-
tion on the subject I shall move as an amendment:
That the following words be struck out: —“and in case of
an equality of votes exercise a second or casting vote.”
Mr. MUNRO : I am afraid the proposed amend-
ment would not carry out the object desired by the
hon. member. If he were to propose that “in the
case of an equality of votes, the question shall pass
in the negative” I could understand the position ; but
otherwise no provision will be made for what is to
happen in the event of an equality of votes. If the
words “ exercise a second or casting vote” were struck
out, and the words “ the question shall pass in tho
negative” inserted, that, I think, would answer the
purpose.
Mr. MOORE: I scarcely think there is any neces-
sity at all for the resolution. The Rules of the House
of Commons will provide for the case, and we might
very well do without the resolution altogether.
Mr. BARTON: The effect of the rules of the House
of Commons will not be as the last speaker supposes,
but it will be to give the President simply a casting
vote, and take away from him altogether a deliberative
vote ; and that certainly is not the intention of the
Convention. Because of the accident—if I may so
put it—of Sir Henry Parkes or Sir Samuel Griffith
being in the chair on any occasion, it is not intended
to take away their deliberative vote. And would it
not be desirable to avoid what would happen in case
the suggestion of the hon. member, Mr. Munro,
were adopted—that is to say, that in case of an
equality of votes the question should pass in tho
negative ? There is no reason why it should pass in
the negative any more than in the affirmative. What
reason is there ?
Sir Samuel Griffith : Because the question will
not be carried by a majority ?
Mr. BARTON: But it will be carried by a majority
if thecasting vote is exercised. I would suggest that
the casting vote should be exercised, and the better
provision would be to say that it should be exercised
on the same principle on which it is exercised by the
Speaker of the Legislative Assembly —that is, not in
a partisan way, but on certain principles, the chief


one of which is the allowance of opportunity for fur-
ther discussion, which is exactly what is wanted in
this case.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: It seems to me that
having conceded to the President the right to initiate
a motion and to speak lipon it, this necessarily involves
the assumption that he will be able to give an original
vote upon the motion. But I entirely concur with
the hon. member, Mr. Playford, that the President
ought not to have two votes. In fact, I think that a
question carried in the Convention by a casting vote
is practically not carried at all. If we have not a
larger majority on any question in this Convention
than the casting vote of the Chair, w r e may consider
that it is practically negatived, whatever appears on
our records. I do not think myself it makes much
difference in what form this resolution is worded, be-
cause our conclusions must be arrived at wdth practi-
cal unanimity. Still there are minor matters in which
no doubt every delegate would be willing that his ow'n
judgment should bow r to the opinion of the majority.
Whether his colony w r ould follow" him in that is an-
other matter to be considered afterwards. But this
resolution also raises the question whether the voting
in this Convention shall be by individuals or by colo-
nies ? There is, again, a difference of opinion on
that point, if not in the Convention, at any rate out-
side of it. I do not propose to discuss the matter at
any length; but considering that wo are to a certain
extent a constitutional Convention, met here to de-
liberate and to devise the best things to be done, and
that w r o shall have to deal with a great number of
details, I am disposed to think the better plan w r ould
be that evidently intended by the proposer of the
resolution —that we should give our votes individu-
ally. I w r ould ask the delegate from South Aus-
tralia, Mr. Playford, to accept the suggestion of the
hon. member, Mr. Munro, and so frame his amend-
ment that in case of an equality of votes, the ques-
tion shall pass in the negative.
Mr. Platfokd : I am quite willing to do so.
Mr. GILLIES : We have already passed a resolu-
tion which sets out that we are to be guided by the
practice of the House of Commons. A resolution
such as that proposed would certainly alter that
determination at which we have already arrived. It
would be inconsistent. The practice of the House of
Commons is well known. That body does not invest
its speaker with a deliberative as Avell as a casting
vote, and, as the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith,
has pointed out, the question is bound to be raised
as to whether we shall vote by colonies or as
individual members. I do not think w r e have an
opportunity this afternoon, short as the sitting must
be, to determine that question. It is an important
question in the minds, I believe, of a number of the
delegates, and I feel confident it is also an important
question in the minds of many of the colonies which
the delegates represent. Therefore, if the mover of
the resolution could see his way to postpone it and
bring it up later, when we can really discuss that
question, it would be, to my mind, extremely desir-
able. I do not think we shall lose anything by
postponing this matter for the present, because the
rules of the House of Commons will determine our
practice for some little time to come, and in a day or
tw r o we may be able to raise this question without
any difficulty.
Sir JOHN DOWNER : I would simply point out
that if the practice of the House of Commons w r ere
followed the President would not have a deliberative
vote, and I certainly understand that you, sir, accepted
the position in which you are now placed on the
distinct understanding that you were to have a
deliberative vote, the question of a casting vote, of
course, being left open to the Convention to decide.
But an important question will arise as to whether
we are to vote individually or by colonies, and as
there will not perhaps be time to discuss that question
tliis afternoon, I would join with the hon. member,
Mr. Gillies, in the suggestion that it shoiild be post-
poned until we have a better opportunity to consider
it.
Mr. GORDON: With regard to the question
whether wo shall vote by colonies or by individuals, I
would ask whether we are not bound by the 4th
resolution adopting the ordinary rules of the House
of Commons ? It is just a question whether we have
not gone a little too far already in committing our-
selves absolutely to the rules of the House of Com-
mons, and whether we should not hark back a little.
Mr. McMILLAN : I agree with the hon. member,
Mr. Gillies, that if we want to open up a debate as
to whether we are to vote individually or by colonies,
it would be better to postpone this motion. Wo took
it for granted that that question had been practically
settled; but if there is to be a debate upon it, 1 shall
be very glad to postpone this motion until to-morrow.
Debate adjourned.
ADMISSION OF THE PRESS AND PUBLIC.
Mr. McMILLAN rose to move:
1. That when the Convention is engaged in debating matters
formally submitted by previous notice, or submitted by
consent without notice, the press and public be admitted
on the order of the President.
2. That whenever the Convention is in Committee the press
and public be not admitted, unless otherwise ordered.
He said: lam sure, as far as I know the minds of
the delegates, that we have no desire to exclude the
press from any important discussion whatever; but
it is simply to discuss the order of our business and
to expedite business that we desire to hold any informal
meetings.
Question put.
Mr. DIBBS: I desire to move the omission of all
the words after the word “ That,” in the Ist clause of
the resolution, with the view of inserting other words,
which I hope will meet with the approval of members
of the Convention, and which will certainly meet
with the approval of the people from one end to the
other of this colony. I beg to move :
That all the words after the word “That,” in the first line
of the Ist clause, be omitted with a view to insert the
following words:—“during the sittings of this Con-
vention the press and the public be admitted on the
order of the President.” That clause 2be omitted.
I move this amendment for the purpose of pointing
out that, if ever that sentiment which was so much
lauded last night—“one people and one destiny” —
is to be given effect to, it will be by taking the people
in all the colonies fully into our confidence. That
can only be done by throwing open our doors wide to
the press and the public, so that they may hear every
debate and argument used in favour of a federated
Australia. If my amendment is carried, it will be
necessary to omit the 2nd clause of the motion
altogether. By adopting the course I suggest, w r e
shall enable the public to judge whether our decisions
are in the interest of Australia as a wiiole, and of the
respective colonies. If the public know that all our
proceedings are subject to outside criticism, there
will be no feeling that this is a secret conclave to
take away the liberties of the public. We will take
the people with us a long w r ay in any course which
members desire to carry out, if we admit the press
and public to all our proceedings. We want to build
up a nation, and in order to do so, we must take into
our confidence the people, who are the principal
factors, and the press also.
Mr. DOUGLAS: We will all agree to strike out
the words necessary to give effect to the hon. mem-
ber’s amendment; and that will best be done by
omitting the w T ords, “on the order of the President.”
It appears to me that our object is to have all matters
dealt with before the public as much as possible.
Mr. PLAYFORD : The best thing we can do is
to follow parliamentary practice. The practice of


our Parliament is to admit the press and public,
with the right to exclude them at any time if we
please. Wo shall accomplish all we desire by adopt-
ing the following amendment: —
That all the words after the word “ That” in the first line
be omitted with a view to insert the following words :
“ all the proceedings of the Convention shall be open
to the press and the public unless otherwise ordered.”
The clause with regard to proceedings in Committee
should, I think, be omitted altogether. In Com-
mittee the most important portion of our work will
have to be done. The whole of the debates on the
Constitution which we may adopt, and a great many
matters of detail which are of exceedingly great
interest, will all be dealt with in Committee ; and the
public will take the deepest interest in our proceed-
ings at that time. They will take more interest in
those proceedings than they will in the merely formal
resolutions which will be submitted prior to the
Constitution being framed. Whenever we find it
is desirable that the press and public should be
excluded we can do so under the amendment I pro-
pose. The more public we make our proceedings, as
in the case of Parliament, the better it will be for ns
and for the cause we are here to promote.
Mr. Dibbs ; The object of Mr. Play ford would be
carried out by adding to my amendment the words
“ unless otherwise ordered.”
The President : 1 would venture to suggest that
it would be the better course for the mover to with-
draw his motion and give notice of a fresh one for
to-morrow, embodying the views of Mr. Playford.
Mr. McMillan : I understand that Mr. Dibbs
agrees to accept Mr. FI ay ford's amendment. I would
suggest that they should be amalgamated at once.
Mr. Dibbs: If I accept the suggestion of Mr.
Playford and add to my amendment the words
“ unless otherwise ordered,” the whole question can
be dealt with now. I will add those words to my
amendment.
Mr. Platford : I do not approve of the insertion
of those words “ on the order of the President.” It
should be “ on the order of the whole Convention.”
Mr. McMillan : It is only fair to those who drew
this resolution to say that their only intention was
that w r e should have the power within ourselves to
sit without the public being present, and this was
purely a formal motion, which would permit us to
take any course we liked. I accept the amendment.
Sir SAMUEL G-RIFEITH: Mr. President, for
my part, I think the press and public —the press is
only a part of the public, after all, and comes in as
part of the public—should be admitted to all sittings
of the Convention, sitting as a Convention, whether
you, sir, are in the chair as President, or whether wo
are in Committee. 1 take this opportunity of saying
so, because I observe it has been stated in various
parts of Australia that I entertain a contrary view r .
1 have never entertained or expressed to any one a
contrary view r . 1 believe, as Mr. Playford has said,
that the most important work of the Convention will
take place in Committee. There the closest argu-
ments will be applied, and there the most instructive
lessons will be given, if any lessons are to be derived
from what we say. I therefore entirely concur with
the amendment of the hon. member, Mr. Dibbs. As
to the words, “ on the order of the President,” I do
not understand them to mean that the President
w r ould have pow’er to exclude the public from the
House. I understand them to mean merely that if
500 persons desired to be admitted, and there was
only room for fifty, those who were admitted should
be admitted on his order.
Mr. GILLIES: When I saw this resolution first
drawm I took it for granted that it practically pro-
posed to carry out what was done in Melbourne last
year, when all the important debates were open to
the press and the public. But it was manifest to
the minds of nearly the whole of the representatives
that times would come when it would be much more
convenient for the members themselves, and more
convenient for the transaction of business, if they
met without the presence of the public and the press.
Not that there was an intention to conceal anything;
but it was with the view of enabling their business
to be presented to the public and the press in a form
in which they would be able to discuss the subjects
properly and methodically. According to the his-
torical information which we have gathered as to tho
course pursued by tho British-American colonies
when they considered the question of federation,
they did so with absolutely closed doors. There was
no information given to the public at all. The
discussions took place in private, and it was only
occasionally at public meetings, and afterwards in
the legislative halls, that the members were in a
position to tell the public what they had done. On
this occasion we do not propose to do that. From
all we have been able to learn the course then pur-
sued was an unfortunate one, although unquestion-
ably it was done for the best purposes and objects.
Tho public did not thoroughly well understand tho
whole course of procedure, and their minds were
partly made up, at any rate, in some of the provinces,
against the course that was proposed. The result
was that in one of the provinces some of the best
and foremost men, occupying the highest public
positions, were relegated for the time-being to private
life, because the public did not understand their
objects at the moment, and did not appreciate them.
If at this moment we proposed the absolute exclusion
of the public and the press, it would be a terrible
mistake. We are all desirous that the press and tho
public should be thoroughly well informed of what
we are doing from time to time. But what I would
urge is that there will be times when we can deal
much better with questions privately, for the time-
being, than we can deal with them publicly. That
they must be afterwards dealt with publicly is beyond
question. In my judgment it is better that some
important points should be thoroughly thrashed out
in detail, and then submitted in a proper and satis-
factory form to the delegates, so as to enable them
to discuss the subject thoroughly, and with such
comprehension of their importance as would weigh
both with the public and the press. I feel convinced
that if a resolution be carried, providing that in all
Committee meetings of this Convention the press
shall be present, before long we shall find out that
we have made a mistake. The position into which
we shall be forced will be this : that we shall not
meet as a delegation at all; we shall meet privately,
as we met this morning, and discuss subjects which,
perhaps, would have been better discussed in a more
formal manner. Our discussions must necessarily
involve details, some of them very important, which
could be more expeditiously settled if they were not
first dealt with in the presence of the press and of
the public.
Sir JOHN DOWNER : I take it that in the case
of all legislation, whatever disposition we may have
to perform all our acts in the broad light of day, in
tho presence of the press and of the public, there
must always be, in matters of detail, some degree of
privacy. When an attorney-general is instructing tho
draftsman as to the contents of a ministerial bill, there
is not usually a reporter present to hear what is being
done, nor is the public generally admitted. I agree
with what Mr. Gillies has said, that it would be an
immense saving of time if we openly and straight-
forwardly said, that when we are discussing the
details of important questions we shall do so without
admitting the public, rather than resort to any ex-
pedient which may bring about the same
result, such as private and unofficial conferences,
respecting which the public would not be informed.
It appears to me that no vital mischief can come
from this proposal, seeing that the details we agree


upon in Committee hare to take the form of resolu-
tions which have to be submitted to the Convention,
which have to be justified, and the whole of the
reasons for adopting them will have to be explained.
If a resolution is come to by a majority, the minority
will take very good caro to have the other side of the
question properly ventilated. It was not merely in
the case of Canada, but also in the case of the
United States, that the proceedings of the Conven-
tion were originally conducted with absolute secrecy.
Whilst I would deprecate absolute secrecy as much
as any member of the Convention would, I under-
stand that there is much of our business that would
be conducted more expeditiously, and many disagree-
ments might very well be reconciled, if we had an
opportunity of conferring in an informal way amongst
ourselves, instead of always speaking ex cathedra,
with every word we said being reported. Speaking
from my own point of view, I concur with what the
Conference did in Melbourne. They came to a wise
resolution when they said that the discussion of
principles should be public, but that the discussion
of details in Committee should be private. In this
instance the discussion has to be public ulti-
mately ; it cannot be suggested that this is a
hole-and-corner business in any shape or form.
Practically, everything will be done in the broad
light of day. The only difference will be that, instead
of so meeting, we shall be able to advance the cause
better by the men sent from the different colonies
consulting privately amongst themselves, afterwards
submitting the resolutions they have arrived at pub-
licly, and explaining the reasons. That will be much
better than to allow the preliminary discussions to
take place in public, when possibly the delegates
might commit themselves to opinions from which they
might have some difficulty afterwards in retiring. I
know there is a strong public feeling on this ques-
tion. Of course the press are particularly anxious
that nothing should take place among us that they
do not understand. I sympathise with them in that
feeling, and I would be the last to wish to deprive
them of any information as to our course of action,
or as to the ultimate conclusions we come to. But I
feel certain that the course adopted in Melbourne
was a wise and prudent one, and might be well fol-
lowed by this Convention.
Mr. MUNRO: It appears to me that we are
wasting time on what is really no practical question.
I understood that the lion, member, Mr. Dibbs,
wishes to add to his amendment the words " unless
otherwise ordered." Surely that covers the whole
ground ! If any necessity should arise for holding a
private meeting, the words " unless otherwise ordered"
would meet the case. My own impression is that
such an occasion will not arise at all. We are
appointed delegates to draft a constitution for a
federal parliament and federal executive, and every-
thing that we do is of interest to the whole of the
Australian colonies. While there may be some little
differences of opinion on details, surely, whether we
are sitting in Committee or in open House, we can-
not debate the question in a proper maimer unless
the proceedings are open to the press and the public,
and unless we deal with the question in a formal
way ! We are not supposed to meet privately or
in an informal manner. I am quite sure that our
business would be facilitated by transacting it in the
presence of the press and the public. I am quite
sure that the business would be better conducted.
If occasion arises at any time the President and
Convention can order that the press and public be
excluded ; but until that occasion arises I do not
think there is any necessity for wasting time over
this question.
Mr. FITZGERALD : I apprehend there can be
no difference of opinion among members as to the
great importance which attaches to the creation of
public opinion throughout the colonies on the ques-
tion of federation. On the other hand, we have to
consider that we come here in a spirit of compromise—
—to carry out that " give and take " policy which
may be said to be the essonce of British parliamen-
tary government, without which it will be impossible
to obtain a successful termination of our labours.
What we have to consider is whether the opening of
our proceedings at all stages to the press will not
considerably affect that spirit which must be such
an important factor in our deliberations. There is a
great deal to be said on this subject. We all recog-
nise the value and importance to us of having all our
proceedings known to the public of Australia; but
it is for us to consider whether it is wise to consent
to the publication of these things—the publication
of the surrender of important principles which dele-
gates come here prepared to support, but which
there will be a necessity for them to resign, if not
wholly, certainly in part, if we are to come to any
satisfactory conclusion. It is a most difficult ques-
tion to decide. lam sure that the delegates do not
desire to come to a hasty conclusion. I confess that
when I first read this resolution I thought it covered
the ground entirely; that unless there should bo
some good reason to the contrary this Convention
would consider that its deliberations on the details of
any scheme of federation should be conducted in
camera ; and, as has been well put, that the result of
the labours of the Convention in Committee should
form the subject of resolutions which would be dis-
cussed openly. The public would then have an
opportunity of regarding the resolutions according to
their merit, and would be able to form opinions as to
their value, and as to how far they affected their
interests or liberties. I think it is desirable that this
question should not be decided this afternoon, but that
there should be an adjournment in order to allow of
further thought as to whether it would be to the
advantage of the object we have all come here to
further to have every detail, every concession, every
.argument made known to the world before we come
to a conclusion. It is a matter of the utmost moment
and weight, affecting in the most serious manner the
result of the labours of this Convention, and I would
respectively suggest that the question should be
postponed until to-morrow.
Mr. THTNNE : In dealing with this matter, refer-
ence has been made by the hon. member, Mr. Gillies,
to the conduct of the convention in Canada, and by
the hon. member, Sir John Downer, to the convention
in the United States, and it was shown that both con-
ventions held their sittings practically in secret; but
I think that the circumstances under which we are
now met are radically different from the circum-
stances under which both those conventions were
held. I take it that the movement in favour of the
federation of these colonies is one that has sprung
wholly and solely from the people of the colonies
themselves, for their own advantage, and I think it is
in that respect that the movements which took place
in Canada, and in the United States, were materially
different, because they had powerful forces external
to the countries themselves which urged them strongly
to enter into some form of federation. I think that
in this matter, unless we are entirely with the people
of these colonies, we are bound to meet with a great
deal of difficulty hereafter, and it seems to me that we
should be making a very great mistake if we adopted
in this Convention any course of procedure differing
from that adopted in the parliaments of all the
colonies, and that is the complete opening of all the
discussions, whether in Committee or out of it, to the
public. If we adopt the resolution which has been
moved by the hon. member, Mr. McMillan, I think
there will be some ground for fearing that suspicion
will attach to some of the proceedings of this Con-
vention, and I think that that would be a most unfortu-
nate thing. The amendment should be carried without
the delay which one hon. gentleman has requested.


Mr. SIIIELS : I think the suggestion offered by
Mr. Fitzgerald and other gentlemen is the correct
one to adopt. We are taking a very serious step,
and I think the question requires more consideration.
What are the complaints which have been made
against parliamentary government of recent years,
not only in these colonies but also in the mother
country? They are that there is an intolerable
amount of talk, that when the people expect work
they get —sometimes eloquence, but sometimes mere
words, and words which had better have been left
Tinspoken. The course being taken is, I think, a
dangerous one, and will be dilatory in its action, the
inevitable tendency of large bodies of representative
men with the press before them, being to rhetorical
displays, and also to the exhibition of a spirit the
very opposite to that which is so necessary in our
deliberations —tho spixnt of compromise. A spirit of
stubbornness is induced. Men having committed
themselves in the sight of the press and of the public
to a certain view, it is human nature that they will
contend for that view to the last, so that, instead of
being ready, in a spirit of compromise, to give up for
higher objects, they will be unyielding and resisting
when they should yield, and when they ought to feel
that the opinions in favour of a course opposite
to that which they advocate aro worthy of their
consideration. Wo are taking a course essentially
dangerous at the present time, and I think that we
ought not to have a discussion on this motion until
further opportunity be given for consideration. I
move;
That the debate be adjourned until to-morrow.
Mr. Macdonald-Patebson seconded the motion.
Mr. RUTLEDGE ; I must express my regret that
the amendment moved by the hon. member, Mr.
Shiels, has been submitted to the Convention. We
have had twenty-four hours to think over this matter.
Notice of the intention to move this motion was
given yesterday when we met; and I do not think
that we shall derive any benefit, or that the proceed-
ings of this Convention will be in any way facilitated
by a further postponement. I think we have all
made up our minds pretty well as to what is tho
proper course to adopt on the present occasion with
regard to this matter. Hon. gentlemen who have
advocated that part of our proceedings should be
conducted privately, have endeavoured to strengthen
their arguments by references to the procedure
adopted when the United States Convention assem-
bled in the year 1787, and to the procedure of the
later Convention assembled for the purpose of found-
ing a Constitution for what is now the Dominion
of Canada; but, as has been observed by the hon.
member, Mr. Thynne, it must not be forgotten that
the circumstances which obtained in both those epochs
were very different from those which prevail at the
present time. It cannot be contended that when the
Convention assembled in 1787, there was a public
press of the character which we now have, not only
in tho metropolis of New South Wales, but also in
all the Australian capitals and in all the principal
provincial towns of these colonies; and I think we
assume too much when we take it for granted that
we who are assembled here are the only persons who
can exercise an educative effect upon each other. A
great many of us are only feeling our way. By the
interchange of ideas in this Chamber we shall do a
great deal to imbue each other with a true idea of
the functions pertaining to us, and the objects we
hope to achieve; but while we hope to get a great
deal of illumination from the interchange of opinions
on the floor of this assembly, I think we must admit
that we shall derive great benefit from the educative
influence of the press outside. I think the more
daylight we can let in upon our proceedings, tho
more advantageous it will be, and the more it will
facilitate the work of this Convention. We have to
cultivate the sympathy of the people whom we are
sent here to represent, and we should suffer a very
great disadvantage indeed if we allowed the idea to
go abroad that there was any part of our proceedings
as a Convention which it was desirable to shield from
public observation. Even in connection with our
own legislative assemblies there is a great deal of
business done informally in private. It is not done
by the legislative assemblies as such, but it is done
in committees, and in other meetings where mem-
bers of both parties come together to arrange their
respective programmes. "Why cannot we do this now?
There is nothing in the amendment moved by the hon.
member, Mr. Dibbs, which prevents any number
of the members of this Convention from assembling
together in order to interchange ideas, and I think,
remembering this, there is no need to suggest the
desirableness of having any part of the proceedings
of this Convention as a convention held in private.
Some hon. gentlemen have suggested that if we do
not adopt the expedient that has been referred to by
Mr. Fitzgerald, of having part of our proceedings on
occasion in private, it will tend to produce a great
flood of oratory, and members will make speeches for
the sake of being reported; but I conceive that if we
have part of our proceedings in private, in this way
we shall bring about the very evil sought to bo
avoided, because when there will only be formal
motions submitted here to be spoken to by tho
delegates, every delegate will conceive it important to
him to have all his say on these resolutions ; whereas,
if the proceedings of the Committee were as open to
the public as the proceedings of the Convention, when
resolutions of a formal character were being discussed,
delegates would not have the same inducement to
make long speeches for the sake of being reported.
Mr. Fitzoeeald : The hon. member must be mis-
taken when he connects me with this idea. I have
not entertained it, nor have I expressed it.
Mr. RUTLEDGE : I have not attributed the argu-
ment to the hon. delegate, but I know that the idea
has existed in some minds, and lam aware that there
is a fear that, unless some of the proceedings of tho
Convention are conducted without the press and tho
public being admitted, there will be a tendency to
open the flood-gates of talk, and to obstruct, rather
than facilitate, the progress of business.
Mr. BAKER: I confess that this is a most difficult
question, and I have not made up my mind as to the
side I shall take. But I rise to point out one funda-
mental difficulty which has not yet been pointed out
by any delegate. Our proceedings here have been
compared to the proceedings in Parliament, and we
are told that, because the proceedings of Parliament
are open to the public, the proceedings of this Con-
vention ought also to be always open to the public.
Now, the fundamental difference between this Con-
vention and Parliament is this: Parliament has
power to decide upon and finally make laws. After
a Bill has emerged from Parliament and has received
the Royal assent it becomes an act, and binds the
people; but we are met here only to advise. Every-
thing we do has hereafter to be discussed and decided
upon by the people. We are told —and, no doubt,
correctly told —that it is our duty to educate the
people up to this idea of federation- —to the adoption
of a scheme which I hope we shall frame in this
Convention. No doubt this is true; but the educa-
tion will come after we have adopted the scheme.
It does not at all follow that the public should be
necessarily admitted to all the details of the framing
of the scheme. It will be a very difficult thing for
the delegates, after the scheme has been framed and
adopted, to explain it, as they will have to do, to the
people of the various colonies if the public arc
admitted to all our discussions. I confess I see
great difficulties on both sides. If we do admit the
public to every discussion it will be difficult for the
delegates when they return to the different colonics


from Avhich they Avere sent to cry back upon the
opinions which they have strongly advocated here,
although they will have to cry back in respect to
some of the details if that spirit of compromise,
AA'hich is the only spirit which should be admitted
here, is present. If we have to give w r ay after having
strongly expressed our opinions it will be most diffi-
cult for us Avhen we get back to agree to views
contrary to those Avhich aa'6 favoured here. On the
other hand, if the press and the public are not
admitted to all our proceedings I knoAv that a
suspicion will arise—l believe an unw r orthy suspi-
cion—that something has happened which, for some
improper reason, we do not want made public. But
I am quite sure that no such suspicion can possibly
be founded on truth. In conclusion, I hope that the
amendment will be agreed to, and that avo shall have
a longer time to think over this matter.
Sir SAMUEL GEIFFITH: There is such a
difference of opinion upon this subject that it seems
to me that it Avill be necessary to dispose of notice
of motion No. 7 before avo can deal with the motion
before us. At the present time Ave do not know how
to divide, so that we are bound to postpone this
motion.
Motion agreed to ; debate adjourned.

DIVISIONS.
Debate resumed (from page 6) on motion by Mr.
McMillan :
1 hat in any divisions taken in the Convention the Presi-
dent or Vice-President, as the case may be, have the
right to vote, and in case of an equality of votes exer-
cise a second or casting vote ; and that the names of
the delegates be printed in alphabetical order, without
reference to the colonies which they represent,—
I pon which Mr. Playford had moved an amendment
to omit the words :
and in case of an equality of votes exercise a second
or casting vote.
Mr. McMILLAN: In order to save time I have
found out to a great extent the wishes of members
of the Convention in regard to this motion and
amendment; aud I will propose an alteration, subject,
of course, to the concurrence of hon. members, when
1 have stated what that alteration is to be. I find
that it is the general desire that the President should
not have a casting vote, and that when the votes are
equal a motion should be considered as having been
practically decided in the negative. I propose, there-
fore, to omit the Avoids “ exercise a second or casting
vote” with the view to the insertion of the w r ords
“ the question shall be deemed to have passed in the
negative.”
The President : As the matter now stands, the
amendment moved by the hon. member, Mr. Playford,
is in the way of the proposal by the hon. member,
Mr. McMillan.
Mr. PLATPOED : I ask leave of the Convention
to Avithdraw my amendment.
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
Motion (by Mr. McMillan) agreed to :
That the words “ exercise a second or casting vote” be
omitted with a view to the insertion of the words “ the
question shall be deemed to have passed in the nega-
tive.”
Mr. SHIELS : Perhaps my hon. friend will allow
me to suggest the advisability of providing for what
may occur, namely, the desire of the Convention to
have the question again submitted to it. The passing
in the negative may be held to preclude the right of
the Convention, excepting by special order, to have a
matter again submitted for consideration. Perhaps
it would bo advisable to provide for any such con-
tingency by adding words to the resolution such as
the following:—
but may be again submitted for consideration.
Mr. McMillan : Notice of motion can be given
under the orders of the day!
Mr. Gillies : The orders of the House of Com-
mons would prevent that!
Mr. SHIELS: The difficulty will be that when
once the question is passed in the negative—if you
simply follow the rules of the House of Commons
which are to guide our proceedings —it cannot bo
brought forward again in the same session.
Mr. Playford : A motion can always bo rescinded!
Mr. SHIELS: I am only throwing out the sug-
gestion in order to prevent anything of that kind.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
ADMISSION OP THE PEESS AND PUBLIC.
Debate resumed (from page 10), on motion by
Mr. McMillan:—
(1.) That when the Convention is engaged in debating
matters formally submitted by previous notice, or
submitted by consent without notice, the press and
public be admitted on the order of the President.
(2.) That, whenever the Convention is in Committee, the
press and public be not admitted, unless otherwise
ordered.
Upon which Mr. Dibbs had moved an amendment to
omit from the first paragraph the words :
“when the Convention is engaged in debating matters
formally submitted by previous notice, or submitted by
consent without notice,” with a view to insert the words
“ during the sitting of the Convention.”
Mr. McMILLAN : Again with the object of saving
time, I would ask my hon. friend, Mr. Dibbs, to with-
draw his amendment with the view of substituting
the following:—
That the press and public be admitted, unless otherwise
ordered, during the sittings of the Convention, on the
order of the President.
I think a motion of that kind will meet the views of
the delegates generally. It still leaves it open to us
to have close sittings, if necessary, and it establishes
the general principle that, in most cases, the press
shall be admitted.
Mr. DIBBS: "With the concurrence of the dele-
gates, I have much pleasure in withdrawing my
amendment. The principle I advocate is the free
and open discussion of all our proceedings. Of
course we shall have the right to exclude the press ;
but I feel perfectly certain that that right will never
be exercised.
Amendment and motion, by leave, withdrawn.
Motion (by Mr. McMillan) proposed :
That the press and public be admitted, unless otherwise
ordered, during the sittings of the Convention, on the
order of the President.
Sir THOMAS McILWEAITH : I cannot under-
stand why such a distinct change should be made
from what was considered necessary yesterdaj-. So
far as I can gather from reading the debate of yester-
day, the opinion of most of the delegates is that the
press shall be admitted whilst the Convention is sitting
as a convention; but that, Avhilst sitting in Committee,
the press shall not be admitted. I believe that is the
intention; and we do not get away from it by simply


throwing upon yourself, Mr. President, the responsi-
bility! of directing whether the press shall be
admitted or not. We have to look at what will
practically be the result if the matter is left entirely
to yourself. The result will be that the press will
always be present, because I do not think for a
moment you will ever take —unless moved strongly
by the Convention itself to do so —the responsibility
of ordering out the press. It is quite possible, there-
fore, that the press will always be present, unless
something happens in connection with which the
Convention may consider it would be more to its
credit for the press not to be present. It is not to
prevent anything of that kind that we want the press
to be present. It is to curtail our proceedings, to
allow us to act in Committee with a great deal more
freedom, and to allow us to come to a determination
more quickly than we would do if the press were pre-
sent. I believe myself that if the press are present at
our proceedings in Committee the Convention will be
protracted from week to week. We will be posing
to the press, and we will, possibly, be led by the press.
We ought to come to the Convention with our own
ideas and discuss them ourselves. I am perfectly
satisfied that, in discussions in Committee, we shall
come to much better, quicker, and freer determinations
without the presence of the press than we shall if
every motion in Committee is commented upon by
the press. I shall not vote for the motion.
Colonel SMITH: I regret to have to differ with
the hon. gentleman who has just resumed his seat;
and I do so, not on account of the press, because
that is a matter of the most profound indifEerence to
me, but because I think the people of all these
colonies oughttoknow everything that is said, whether
in Committee or out of Committee. They ought to
know the reason why we arrive at certain resolutions
in Committee. The people of the whole of the
colonies are expected to indorse our actions, and to
know the reasons for the decisions at which we arrive.
For my part, I support most cordially the proposal
which was brought forward by the hon. member, Mr.
Dibbs, or the one now proposed by the hon. member,
Mr. McMillan. I certainly do think that if we act
fairly to the people we represent in the various
colonies we ought to allow the utmost publicity.
The hon. member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, knows
that the attending and reporting of our proceedings
is a costly matter for the press. It is not for the
purpose of pleasing us that the press are present,
but for the purpose of letting the people of the
various colonies know what we are doing, and why we
are doing it. I cordially support the proposal of the
hon. member, Mr. McMillan.
Sir PATRICK JENNINGS: I must own that
when I first considered this subject I thought our
proceedings would be expedited if certain debates
which will take place in Committee were not attended
and reported by the press. I certainly believe, with
all due respect to the delegates, that the reporting
of all our proceedings will tend to prolong the sitting
of this Convention. I find, however, that gentlemen
whom we might most naturally expect would desire
to return to their homes as early as possible are in
no degree adverse to the probable prolongation of
our sittings by the presence of the press fully to
report all that is done. We are, no doubt, doing a
great work; and I think that we ought not to hurry
over it. Every opportunity ought to be given to
discuss and reflect upon every proposal brought
before the Convention. Under these circumstances
I have fallen in with the view put forward in the
amendment proposed by the hon. member, Mr.
Dibbs, yesterday, and now substituted by the motion
of the hon. member, Mr. McMillan, that it will be
most desirable, in the interests of all the colonies,
in the interests of the Australasian public, and
as a means of giving very wide and broad in-
formation in regard to our proceedings, to have the
whole of them reported in the press. I think my
hon. friend, Sir Thomas McHwraith, probably mis-
understood the meaning of the motion. I do not
take it to be the intention of the President to exclude
any person whatever ; he is simply to have the power
to regulate the numbers of those who may attend
—that is, for the purpose of keeping order and pre-
venting overcrowding. Ido not expect there will be
any occasion upon which the members of the
Convention will comport themselves in such a way as
to render necessary a motion that the press bo
excluded. lam quite confident, from the concourse
of gentlemen who are here, with all their vast
experience and ripe knowledge, that our proceedings
throughout will be consistent with the dignity and
importance of the occasion, and will be well worth
reporting. I have great pleasure in supporting the
motion.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
QUORUM.
Mr. McMILLAN : I bog to move:
That twenty-five delegates do form a quorum of the Con-
vention.
The idea is that we ought to have present at least a
majority of the whole of the delegates before going
to business on any important matter, and as the
delegates number about forty-five, and as it is better
to frame the resolution in a specific manner, so that
we may easily count those who are present, rather
than have a mere majority and an open question as
to what a majority might be, I have decided to make
it specific —that is to say, that twenty-five members
shall form a quorum.
Mr. Gillies : Inclusive or exclusive of the Presi-
dent ?
Mr. McMILLAN: Inclusive. The President is a
member.
Mr. THTNNE: I think that some provision
might be made for a few minutes grace after the hour
appointed for meeting. If you, Mr. President,
should happen to be a few minutes late, and,
although the Vice-President might, perhaps, be on
the premises, but not actually in the room, the Con-
vention would have to adjourn for the day if no
grace at all were allowed. 1 think that five or ten
minutes, or half an hour’s grace should be provided
for, in order to prevent accidents that might other-
wise happen.
Mr. GILLIES: The House of Commons’ rule is
half an hour’s grace after the time of meeting, and
we have adopted the House of Commons’ rule.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.
The President ; As the next business stands in
my name, I would suggest that Sir Samuel Griffith,
Vice-President, relieve me of the Chair, if agreeable
to the Convention.
The Chair was taken by the Vice-President.
Sir HENRY PARKES: I have the honor to move:
That in order to establish and secure an enduring founda-
tion for the structure of a Federal Government, the
principles embodied in the resolutions following be
agreed to :
(1.) That the powers and privileges and territorial rights of
the several existing Colonies shall remain intact, except
in respect to such surrenders as may be agreed upon as
necessary and incidental to the power and authority of
the National Federal Government.
(2.) That the trade and intercourse between the Federated
Colonies, whether by means of land carriage or coastal
navigation, shall be absolutely free.
(3.) That the power and authority to impose customs duties
shall be exclusively lodged in the Federal Government
and Parliament, subject to such disposal of the revenues
thence derived as shall be agreed upon.
(4.) That the military and naval defence of Australia shall
be intrusted to Federal Forces, under one command.
Subject to these and other necessary provisions, this Con-
vention approves of the framing of a Federal Consti-
tution, which shall establish, —


(1.) A Parliament, to consist of a Senate and a House of
Representatives, the former consisting of an equal
number of Members from each province, to be elected
by a system which shall provide for the retirement of
one-third of the members every year’s, so securing
to the body itself a perpetual existence combined with
definite responsibility to the electors, the latter to be
elected by districts formed on a population basis, and
to possess the sole power of originating and amending
all bills appropriating revenue or imposing taxation.
(2.) A Judiciary, consisting of a Federal Supreme Court,
which shall constitute a High Court of Appeal for Aus-
tralia, under the direct authority of the Sovereign,
whose decisions, as such, shall be final.
(3.) An executive, consisting of a governor-general and such
persons as may from time to time be appointed as his
advisers, such persons sitting in Parliament, and whose
term of office shall depend upon their possessing the
confidence of the house of representatives, expressed
by the support of the majority.
In submitting these resolutions, I must repeat in the
full Convention what I have stated to different
delegates and to different sections, that I submit
these resolutions in no sense with a desire to push
them to a conclusion in any special interest. In
other words, I do not submit them as I submit a
resolution embodying some principle ripon which I
have strong convictions in the Parliament of the
country; but I submit them as a ground-work on
which a debate may be raised on the whole question
with which we have to deal, and I submit them with
the expectation that they will be freely and unfear-
ingly discussed, amended, negatived, dealt with in
whatever way the Convention pleases. They certainly
give a fair expression of the outline of the constitution
which we want, as it exists in my own mind, and to
that extent 1 at once acknowledge the paternity of
the motion I make. I may, perhaps, be permitted,
before entering upon the subject-matter of my reso-
lutions, to say a few words which, if I deemed an
inaugural address absolutely necessary, I should have
said. I venture, before entering upon a discussion
of these special resolutions, to appeal to every colony
and to every delegate representing every colony, to
meet the Avork which Ave are now about to begin in a
broad, federal spirit. ■ ~\Vc cannot hope for any just
conclusion—Ave cannot hope reasonably for any
amount of valid success—unless Ave lose sight, to a
large extent, of the local interests Avhich we represent
at the same time as we represent the great cause.
There can be no federation if Ave should happen, any
of us, to insist upon conditions Avhich stand in the
Avay of federation; there can be no federation—
no complete union of these governments, of these
communities, of these separate colonies, unless we
can so far clear the way as to approach the great
question of creating a federal poAver as if the boun-
daries uoav existing had no existence whateA'er. I
think it is quite consistent for every one of us
to disburden our minds of our local—l will not
say prejudices, but of our local inclinations, without
in any Avay impairing our patriotic resolve to pre-
serve the rights of each of the colonies Ave represent.
It does seem to me in the highest degree necessary
that Ave should approach the general question in the
most federal spirit Ave can call to our support. Ido
not knoAV that I need dAA ell on that topic any longer,
because I think, looking at the gentlemen around
me, it must be apparent to the mind of every one
who hears me; but I myself cannot too ferA r ently
impress on my co-representatives from all parts of
Australia the necessity of keeping in vJcav the one
object of the better government of the Avhole Austra-
lian people. I contend that any resolutions to form
a basis for our proceedings must be sufficiently
informal and elastic not to fetter, as it were, our
hands at eAery effort Ave make. I, therefore, lay
down certain conditions Avhich seem to me imperatiA’e
as a groundwork of anything Ave have to do, and I
prefer stating that these first four resolutions simply
laydown what appear to me the four most important
conditions on which Ave must proceed. First:
That the powers and privileges and territorial rights of the
several existing colonies shall remain intact, except in
respect to such surrenders as may be agreed upon as
necessary and incidental to the power and authority of
the National Federal GoA’ernment.
I think it is in the highest degree desirable that Ave
should satisfy the mind of each of the colonies that
we have no intention to cripple their powers, to invade
their rights, to diminish their authority, except so far
as is absolutely necessary in view of the great end to be
accomplished, which, in point of fact, will not be
material as diminishing the poAvers and privileges and
rights of the existing colonies. It is therefore pro-
posed by this first condition of mine to satisfy them
that neither their territorial rights nor their poAvers
of legislation for the Avell-being of their own country
will be interfered with in any way that can impair
the security of those rights, and the efficiency of their
legislate poAvers. By my next condition I seek to
define Avhat seems to me an absolutely necessary con-
dition of anything like perfect federation, that is,
that Australia, as Australia, shall be free—free on the
borders, free everyAvhere—in its trade and intercourse
betAveen its oavh people; that there shall bo no
impediment of any kind —that there shall be no
barrier of any kind between one section of the
Australian people and another; but, that the trade
and the general communication of these people shall
floAv on from one end of the continent to the other,
with no one to stay its progress or to call it to
account; in other Avords, if this is carried, it must
necessarily take with it the shifting of the poAver of
legislation on all fiscal questions from the local or
provincial Parliaments to the great national
Parliament sought to be created. To my mind
it would be futile to talk of union if we keep
up these causes of disunion. It is, indeed, quite
apparent that time, and thought, and philosophy,
and the knowledge of what other nations haA'O
done, have settled this question in that great
country to Avhich Ave must constantly look, the
United States of America. The United States of
America have a territory considerably larger than
all Australasia—considerably larger, not immensely
larger—and from one end of the United States
to the other there is no custom-house office. There
is absolute freedom of trade throughout the extent
of the American union, and the high duties Avhich
the authors of the protectionist tariff are noAV levy-
ing on the outside Avorld are entirely confined to
the federal custom-houses on the sea-coast. Now,
our country is fashioned by nature in a remarkable
manner —in a manner which distinguishes it from all
other countries in the Avide world for unification for
family life —if I may use that term in a national
sense. We are separated from the rest of the world by
many many leagues of sea —from all the old countries,
and from the greatest of the neAv countries ; but wo
are separated from all countries by a Avide expanse of
sea, which leaA r es us Avith an immense territory, a
fruitful territory—a territory capable of sustaining
its countless millions —leaves us compact within our-
selves. So that if a perfectly free people can arise
anyAvhere it surely may arise in this favoured land of
Australia. And Avith the example to Avhich I haA r e
alluded, of the free intercourse of America, and the
example of the evils created by customs difficulties
in the states of Europe, I do not see hoAV any of us
can hesitate in seeking to find here absolute freedom
of intercourse among us. My next resolution says:
That the power and authority to impose customs duties
shall be exclusively lodged in the federal government
and parliament, subject to such disposal of the revenues
thence deriA'ed as shall be agreed upon.
Here we create the power of raising revenues through
the Customs, which, of course, Avill open the field to
the great and aggressive debates as to Avhich form of
customs duties will be most conducive to the Avelfare
of the country as a Avhole. It may be—it is not for


me even to prophesy or to express my own opinions
in that direction —it may be that the federal parlia-
ment will at once declare for a protective policy for
Australia against the world. Possibly it may be
that the federal parliament, composed, as we have a
right to expect it will be composed, of the best men
Australia can supply, will propose some different
policy. I will not use words here to describe that
policy —I will use no qualifying w r ords —but let the
federal parliament propose what policy it may, it
will bo the duty of every loyal and patriotic citizen
of Australia to cheerfully submit to its decision. It
will be their duty—the duty of those who hold an
opinion different from that which may be in the ascen-
dant —to fight the battle out in the federation, in
the federal parliament. Taking my own case for a
moment, holding the view's I do, if I should be
honored with a place in the federal parliament, it
would be ray duty, to the utmost of my power, to
seek to embody in the fiscal laws of the country the
principles of what is known as free-trade. I could
do no other as a conscientious man. But suppose
the majority were against me it would be my duty to
cheerfully submit —not to give up my opinions—to
fight for my opinions though in a narrow minority,
but to submit to the majority that must rule in a free
country. I think I have made apparent in a very few
words what I mean by these two resolutions. I then
come to one to which I expect an almost unanimous
agreement:
That the military and naval defence of Australia shall be
entrusted to federal forces, under one command.
Whatever our views may be on other points, I think
w r e shall all be agreed upon this: that for the
defence of Australasia to be economical, to be
efficient, to be equal to the emergency that may arise
at any time, it must be of a federal character, and
must bo under one command. I am seeking to sim-
plify my words as much as possible. I do not mean
that the land forces and the naval forces shall be
under one commander-in-chief; but that they should
be under one kindred command —that the naval
officer in command equally with the military officer
shall be a federal officer, and amenable to the national
government of Australasia. Now, these are the con-
ditions which appear to me to be essentially requisite
that w T e should decide in one way or the other —that
should be strictly defined by this Convention before
we tan proceed to construct a bill to confer a con-
stitution. I then proceed:
Subject to these and other necessary provisions, this Con-
vention approves of the framing of a federal constitu-
tion, which shall establish:
(1.) A Parliament, to consist of a senate and a house of
representatives,
What I mean is an upper chamber, call it what you
may, which shall have within itself the only con-
servatism possible in a democracy —the conservatism
of maturity of judgment, of distinction of service, of
length of experience, and weight of character —which
are the only qualities we can expect to collect and
bring into one body in a community young and in-
experienced as Australia is; and a house of repre-
sentatives upon a thoroughly popular basis. The
resolution proceeds :
the former consisting of an equal number of members
from each province, to be elected by a system which
shall provide for the retirement of one-third of the
members every years, so securing to the body
itself a perpetual existence combined with definite
responsibility to the electors ; the latter to be elected
by districts formed on a population basis, and to
possess the sole power of originating and amending all
bills appropriating revenue or imposing taxation.
I hold that these latter words must be engrafted
upon any constitution bill, especially if the two
houses are elective, because we may naturally expect
—if we have an elective upper chamber, whether
elected by the colonies as provinces or by bodies of
electors —that that body will contend for an equal
authority in. dealing with what are called money
hills, unless wo expressly provide that these bills
shall originate and be amended in that chamber which
is more directly and more truthfully responsible to
the whole body of the electors. Hence, then, I con-
tend that it will be absolutely necessary not to trust
to derivations to bo drawn from principles or practice
in other countries, but to expressly provide that all
money bills shall originate and undergo amendment
only in the house of representatives. The next
clause says:
A judiciary, consisting of a federal supreme court, which
shall constitute a high court of appeal for Australia,
under the direct authority of the Sovereign, whoso
decisions as such shall be final.
In seeking to create this supreme court of Australia,
it will be observed that I seek to create within it an
appellate court from which there shall be no appeal
to the Queen in the Privy Council. For that reason,
if the Queen has authority in England, she can have
authority here. If she forms, even sentimentally, a
part of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
she can also form a similar part of our Appellate
Court. But at the same time i think we shall make
a great mistake if we allow any appeal to be made
outside the shores of the new Australia. I appeal to,
and I shall expect several gentlemen, learned in the
law, who are delegates here, to dwell further, and in
a much more definite way, upon this branch of the
subject than I shall pretend to do. I think I have
stated the object I have in view with sufficient clear-
ness. The resolutions conclude:
An executive, consisting of a governor-general, and such
persons as may from time to time be appointed as his
advisers, such persons sitting in Parliament, and whoso
term of office shall depend upon their possessing the
confidence of the house of representatives expressed by
the support of the majority.
What is meant by that is simply to call into existence
a ministry to conduct the affairs of the new 7 nation as
similar as it can bo to the ministry of England—a body
of constitutional advisers who shall stand as nearly as
possible in the same relation to the representative of
the Crown here as her Majesty’s imperial advisers stand
in relation to the Crown directly. These, then, are the
principles which my resolutions seek to lay dow r n as a
foundation, as I have already stated, for the new
superstructure, my object being to invite other gentle-
men to w'ork upon this foundation so as to best
advance the ends we have in view. I again express
my desire that the discussion may be as free as pos-
sible ; that the amendment of my scheme may not bo
guided by any consideration except w 7 hat will be best
for the country; and that no importance whatever
will be attached to the source from w 7 hich these reso-
lutions come. I think I have sketched the grounds
of my resolutions with sufficient clearness, and, if
so, certainly w 7 ith sufficient fulness. lam sorry to
say my health w ill not permit me to dwell very long
upon the subject, but I cannot refrain from saying
a few words on the general question. As to the
wisdom of the great step w r e have now taken —for so
many eminent men from different parts of Australasia
meeting in this chamber as delegates from their re-
spective colonies is in itself a great step —as to the
wisdom of that step w 7 e have the warning of every
country in the world which has tried government by a
confederation. I know of no single instance where
anything like complete success, anything like satis-
factory success, has arisen where there has been a
number of states of equal authority and power trying
to govern by confederated authority. But we need
not go any further than the striking example of the
states which came into existence immediately after the
declaration of independence in America. The history
of those confederated states and their vain attempts to
conduct their affairs is a warning for all time to a free
people not to attempt to manage their affairs in any
other way than by a solid united government repre-
senting the whole people. We had throughout the years


of the revolutionary war, and not only so, but for
several years—l forget at this moment how many—of
the new republic, we had the example that neither in
war nor in peace were those confederated states able
to exercise any power, and in the lamentations uttered
by the great authors of the Union of their inability
to get anything done we may find a warning to ail
future peoples who attempt to govern themselves as
a whole. The thing is so reasonable in the very
nature of things that it hardly admits of reference
to history or elaborate argument. Take our own
example. Here we find a people I suppose about
4,000,000 strong. They have afforded in the great
cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, and
llobart abundant proof of the power of founding an
empire. Go beyond the cities: they have accom-
plished under responsible government what appear
to me, and what must appear to any stranger who
knew the country thirty-five years ago, marvels in
the way of internal improvements. Not only the
railways but the roads, the telegraphs, and every-
thing that conduces to the best ends of a civilised
community, has been achieved by this scattered
people in a marvellous manner. But all through
this great, this noble, this successful effort we have
had different sources of irritation, of bad neighbour-
hood, of turmoil, of aggression, which, if they were
to go on, must make these conterminous communities
instead of being a people of one blood, one faith, one
jurisprudence—one in the very principles of civilisa-
tion themselves—instead of that, must make us as
cavilling, hostile, disputatious foreign countries. The
only way to stop that is for the whole people —and
remember that the whole people in the final result
must be the arbiters—to join in creating one great
union government which shall act for the whole.
I hat government must, of course, be sufficiently strong
to act with effect, to act successfully, and it must be
sufficiently strong to carry the name and the fame of
Australia with unspotted beauty and with uncrippled
power throughout the world. One great end, to my
mind, of a federated Australia is that it must of
necessity secure for Australia a place in the family
of nations, which it never can attain while it is split
up into separate colonies with antagonistic laws, and
with hardly anything in common. Ido not now, Mr.
President, dwell upon the many conflicts in the laws
of these colonies which ought not to exist, such as
the conflicts in our marriage laws, in the laws govern-
ing all monetary and financial institutions—l do not
dwell upon these things—they are too numerous for
me at this time—but every one of us knows the
extent of the evil resulting from this want of har-
mony. All that can be cured ; but it can be cured
°nly hy one great union government which shall
faithfully represent us all. I regret to say, Mr.
President, that my strength is not such as will enable
mo to keep 011 my feet many minutes longer. I have
submitted these resolutions—perhaps it is all the
better—without any great effort in their support. I
trust I have explained them with a clearness sufficient
for my purpose^ and I trust that I have indicated with
a clearness sufficient what the great object we aim
at must be, and the means by which alone we can hope
to accomplish it. I do not doubt that the gentlemen
present will each of them address themselves to the
subject which, I think, the resolutions have the merit
of fairly launching in a spirit of patriotism, always
keeping in view the welfare, the prosperity, the united
strength, and the ultimate glory of our common coun-
try. We cannot fail if weset about this work in
earnest. I shall say no more now for the reason I have
stated, but reserve anything that I may wish to advance
in further support of these resolutions to the reply
which I have no doubt will be accorded to me. I
have the honor to propose the resolutions standing
in my name.
Question proposed.
The President then resumed the chair.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: As no lion, member
desires to proceed with the debate just now, and it is
possible that some hou. member may be willing to
speak this afternoon, I would suggest, Mr. President,
that you should leave the chair until an hour which
may be considered most convenient for the Convention
to meet in the afternoon.
Mr. GILLIES: There is a feeling among a number
of gentlemen in the Convention that it would be
extremely desirable to adjourn until to-morrow, when
we should go on with the general discussion. Of
course, if any hon. gentleman is desirous of con-
tinuing the discussion raised by you, sir, on your
resolutions to-day, I do not suppose that any hon.
member would like to prevent that from taking place.
But we ought to have an assurance from some hon.
member that he is prepared to continue the discussion
if we meet here at half-past 2 o’clock this afternoon.
Sir JOHN BRAT: It will be convenient, perhaps,
that some gentleman present, who is prepared to
resume the discussion, should move an adjournment
until that time.
The P .resident : If an intimation is made that an
hon. gentleman will be prepared to take up the debate
at half-past 2 o’clock, 1 will leave the chair now, and
take it again at that hour. If there is a desire to
adjourn until to-morrow, I think the adjournment
must bo made by motion. But I would suggest that
my leaving the chair until half-past 2 o’clock is the
preferable course.
Mr. HEAKIN: The understanding here was that
one of the senior members of the Convention was
likely to move the adjournment of the debate until
half-past 2 o’clock this afternoon. If that is not the
case I shall myself be prepared to move an adjourn-
ment until that hour.
The President left the chair, and resumed it at
half-past 2 o’clock.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I should have pre-
ferred, Mr. President, that my hon. friend beside me,
the Hon. James Munro, Prime Minister of the great
colony of Victoria, should have followed you in the
debate on the resolutions that you have submitted to
us. But we are all of us, I suppose, conversant
with the subject which we are met to discuss, and
under these circumstances I think that no useful
purpose can be served by delaying the discussion.
V ou, sir, have set us a very good example in many
respects in the speech in which you opened it. I
trust that the various speakers who may address the
Convention will not be unduly long, while I hope, at
the same time, that they will address themselves in
detail to the important matters which we have to
consider. I do not propose to address myself to the
general aspects of the question, because I feel that I
could not usefully add anything to what has been so
well said by yourself, nor could 1 say it so well; but
I propose to offer some observations which I think
may be worthy of consideration before we come to a
conclusion upon the important matters submitted in
these resolutions. The first of the propositions, or
the principles, sir, that you ask the Convention to
affirm, is really, I think, the fundamental one of all.
It is the question ujion which public opinion in the
colonies is most agitated, namely, how far the
separate self-governing states on this continent are
to surrender their powers of autonomy. The propo-
sition which you enunciate is this :
That the powers and privileges and territorial rights of the
several existing colonies shall remain intact, except in
respect to such surrenders as may be agreed upon as
necessary and incidental to the power and authority
of the national federal government.
Entirely concurring in that proposition, I do not pro-
pose to offer many words in support of it. But I
will make this observation: that that indication of
fhe functions of the federal government is really the
key to the whole of the resolutions that follow. AVe
are met here to devise a constitution, that is, a great


governmental machine to govern the general affairs of
Australia. But before we can attempt to indicate
what the nature of that machine should be, it is
absolutely necessary that we should have a clear con-
ception of the work that it has to perform. The work
that has to bo performed by independent states or
provinces, of which we have several in Australia at
the present time, is in many respects very different
from the Avork that will have to be performed by that
general gOA-ernmental machine, and that consideration
must bo ever present to our minds in considering
both the relative functions of the two houses of Parlia-
ment and the relation that is to exist betAveen tho
executive and the legislative departments of govern-
ment. For instance —and I will refer to this more
particularly later on —the relationship between the
two houses of parliament that is quite applicable to,
and, I may say, is manifestly the proper one to adopt
in, a single self-contained state may not necessarily
be equally Avell adapted to a federation of states.
It may Avell be that the relations of the smaller
house —the senate I will call it, using the word you
have used in the resolution—to the other house re-
presenting the people directly, may be different in a
state of that kind. But I say that in considering all
these matters Ave must bear in mind the functions
which the general government and the general Parlia-
ment haA-e to perform. Without referring more in
detail to that just IIOAV, I will pass on to the first
of the great subjects you have referred to in the
resolutions as one to be dealt Avith by the federal
parliament, the question of tariff or customs. You
propose to affirm that there shall be freetrade betAveen
tho provinces, and that the general parliament alone
shall have the power to impose any restrictions upon
trade, or to raise reA-enue from customs. Not dis-
senting in the smallest degree from that proposal, I
offer no obserA-ation either in support of or against
it. I do not think it necessary until some opposition
is shown to it, to offer any further observations than
you made in support of it. But I would point out
at the present moment that the establishment of a
federal tariff must be subsequent to the establishment
of a federal parliament. The time that will be
occupied in deA'ising a federal tariff is at present
unknoAvn to us, and I think it follows almost as a
matter of course that, until that federal tariff—that
federal customs system —is adopted there must be a
continuance of the existing - system —and that for
more reasons than one. First, because otherAvise
there Avould for some time be no source of revenue
from the customs at all, and the various states would
be throAAii at once into a condition of inability to
meet their engagements and carry on their functions.
That is the first and most obvious reason ; but beyond
that there is another question, which is a very serious
one for us all to consider, and it is this : We in these
colonics haA-e been in the habit of relying to a very
large extent for our revenue upon customs tariffs.
The conditions of Australia in that respect are very
different from those of the American States, which
haA-e never of late years —never since the very earliest
inception of their present constitution—had to rely
upon the customs for rev-enue. Their reA-enue has
been deriA-ed from internal sources. We, in Aus-
tralia, all rely to a large extent on customs reA-enue ;
and some security must be devised that the future
customs revenue will still be aA-ailable, and will be
sufficient when distributed for the needs of the
separate provinces." I myself do not apprehend
that Avhen the federal parliament meets any
practical difficulty will be found in raising a suffi-
cient external revenue by means of the customs,
a reA-enue equal, or nearly equal, to that now-
raised by the colonies separately. An equal
amount certainly must be raised. In the third of
these resolutions you have referred to the disposal
of that revenue. It appears to me that Ave must
carefully bear in mind throughout our deliberations
here the necessity of providing a sufficient amount of
revenue to he disposed of amongst the separate
states. Ido not at present indicate, nor am 1 in a
position to do so, how that will he secured; but I
will just indicate the great difficulty which might
arise under some circumstances, which I do not think
likely to happen. Suppose the federal parliament were
to consider it desirable that there should be something
like absolute free-trade, or as near free-trade as pos-
sible, that as small an amount of money should be
raised by customs as is compatible with the existence
of the Government. Then some other means of raising
revenue would have to be devised by the separate
states. I mention that, not because I wish to refer
particularly to this branch of the subject, in respect
to which a great many members of the Convention
have a much larger knowledge than I possess, but
because it is a subject which requires to be carefully
considered. We must secure for tho federal govern-
ment and for the separate governments, who will
derive great part of their revenue from tho surplus
customs income of the general government, a suffi-
ciency of money to carry on their work. In con-
sidering that also we must not lose sight of tho
essential condition that this is to be a federation of
states, and not a single government for Australia. I
will make that clear later on. Ido not at present pro-
pose to offer any observations in respect to military
and naval defences. We are all agreed that there
must be one command —of course, there must be sub-
commands —but those are matters of detail. Con-
curring, as I do, with the general propositions which
you have laid down as to tho general functions of
tho machine that is to be constructed, I wish to pro-
ceed to consider the question of the legislative and
executive power, because that is the machine which
has to work, and it is our business, if we are capablo
of doing our work —it is our business whether we are
capable or not —to devise a scheme that will work,
and to avoid any possible or probable sources of
friction, as far as historical information will enable us
to do so. And here let mo insist upon the essential con-
dition —the preliminary condition —that the separate
states are to continue as autonomous bodies, sur-
rendering only so much of their powers as is necessary
to the establishment of a general government to do
for them collectively what they cannot do individually
for themselves, and which they cannot do as a col-
lective body for themselves. You propose that there
shall be a parliament of two houses —a senate and a
house of representatives, you propose to call them,
and I know of no better terms —that in one the
states shall be represented equally, and in the other
the people of Australia in proportion to population.
What does that mean ? I ask hon. gentlemen here
to consider the full extent of all that is involved in
the proposition, because I take it that is the key to
the whole of what follows. For it means this, in the
language of one of the writers of those admirable
papers which we have all read, written for the pur-
pose of inducing the American States, and the state of
New York in particular, to adopt the federal consti-
tution of America —that every law submitted to the
federal parliament shall receive the assent of tho
majority of the people, and also the assent of the
majority of the states. That is the essential condition of
the American Constitution. It has given rise, no doubt,
to much friction; but any form of Government
probably will, unless one body is absolutely pre-
ponderating in power. But that is a condition abso-
lutely new to us in Australia. It is absolutely new
to us in the British empire, that every law shall
receive the assent of a majority of the people, as well
as of a majority of the states. And I particularly wish
hon. gentlemen here to consider how that will affect
the concluding words of this first proposal as to the
form of the constitution, and also how it will affect
the relationship of the executive to the Parliament —
that everything has to receive the assent of the


majority of the people and the assent of the majority of
the states. Our present system in the colonies and in
the British Parliament, as well as in that of Canada,
is that one house has a preponderating influence.
It is practically sufficient tor most purposes of
government that a measure should commend itself to
that house, and if it commends itself to that house
it will sooner or later have the force of law. The
other house is a weaker, not so independent a body ;
it can exercise at most a power of delay to prevent
undue haste in government; but sooner or later it
has to give way. But if you recognise the principle
—and I think we must if we are to get federation of
the Australian colonies—that the states must also
concur by a majority in every proposal, then one
house cannot have that preponderating influence.
There must be on all important matters a deliberate
and not a coerced concurrence of the two branches
of the legislature. As to the constitution of the
senate, I may be permitted to say that I believe it
can only be satisfactorily framed on a basis such as
is indicated in the resolution, that there shall be an
equal number of members from each state, and
that they shall retire periodically—that is to say, it
shall be a body incapable of dissolution—a continuous
body periodically renewed by the vacation of office of
a portion of its members. The number of years that
they should hold office is entirely a matter of detail.
In respect to the concluding words of the resolution,
in which you propose that the lower house shall have
the sole power of originating and amending all bills,
appropriating revenue, or imposing taxation, I desire
to say that, as at present advised, it seems to me that
that is quite inconsistent with the independent exist-
ence of the senate as representing the separate states.
The functions of a legislative council are all more or
less supposed to be founded on those of the House of
Lords, the powers of which have become considerably
diminished, and are now principally those of a check-
ing and a useful revising body. This is the case with
regard to our councils, especially the nominee bodies
which exist in many of the colonies. The elective
councils have a more real control; but in all great
contests between the two houses of parliament, one
representing the whole body of the people, and the
other representing only part of them, the body repre-
senting only part of the people has necessarily had to
give way ; and it has become recognised that the two
houses have not in substance, although they have in
form, equal authority in the state. I understand that
the first part of this proposition involves the assump-
tion that the two houses shall have equal powers, and
that all that is to be done shall be by the concurrence
of the people and the states. If that is so, I take it
that the least you can give to the house representing
the states as states, is an absolute power of veto upon
anything that the majority of the states think ought
not to be adopted. I will illustrate that by one or two
probable instances. The limitation suggested in this
resolution is merely as to bills originating the appro-
priation of revenue or imposing taxes. That is, indeed,
the only restriction that is in form adopted in any of
the constitutions we have. Nor do I suggest for a
moment that any but the house representing the
people directly should have the power of originating
taxation, or of originating expenditure. But if every
law has to receive the approval of the majority of the
people as well as of the majority of the states, it
follows that they must have the power of refusing
their assent to any proposed taxation or to any
proposed expenditure.
Mr. Playfokd : That is involved in the resolution!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : It appears to me
that the resolution strikes at that altogether.
Suppose that it was proposed by the persons having
the conduct of business in the house of representa-
tives to expend a large sum of money, say, in es-
tablishing a federal arsenal in a particular place, or
in raising a large body of troops, and suppose that
the proposal were embodied, as it might well be, in an
appropriation bill, should the senate representing the
states have the power to veto that expenditure, or
should it not ? That is the form in which the
question has arisen in the various colonies. It may
be in Australia, where we have some very large
colonies and some very small ones, that a majority,
representing, perhaps, two colonies only, would have
practically the power of enforcing that expenditure
against the will of the majority of the states. And
they would have it, if it were not competent for the
senate representing the states to exercise the power
of veto as to any item of expenditure of which they
disapproved. That is a matter which must be con-
sidered, and I bring it up at this early stage because
it requires the fullest consideration from every
gentleman present. We must know exactly what
we mean —whether we mean that the senate repre-
senting the states is to have the power of vetoing
any law or anything in the nature of a law, because
the authorisation or expenditure for important pur-
poses is in the nature of a law, or whether we do not
mean that. We must make up our minds as to what
we do mean. When we have done that we can easily
express our meaning. I cannot see at present how
it is possible for the lower house alone to have prac-
tically uncontrolled authority over expenditure ; how
it is possible to reconcile that principle with the
principle that everything done by the federal legisla-
ture must have the assent of a majority of the states.
I hope that hon. gentlemen will consider the matter
and address themselves to it. I have no hesitation
in expressing what I believe to be the true solution
of the question, not only as a matter of practical
necessity for the purpose of establishing a federal
constitution, but the best adapted for its stability
when established. Ido not think that the smaller
Australian colonies will be content to relinquish the
power of exercising the veto by a majority of states
in regard to any proposal in the federal legislature,
and I do not think it desirable that they should do so,
because it would be departing from the fundamental
principle enunciated in the first resolution, that we
are only surrendering to the general government
what is absolutely necessary for the benefit of the
whole of Australia, leaving to the several states their
autonomy. If we leave to the states a power of
autonomy as ample as the resolution indicates, we
must leave them their individual existence as state
entities, capable individually of voting as states in
favour of or in opposition to any proposed federal
legislation. Without that a source of friction will
exist for the future. It may be said that we are not
familiar with this form of constitution. In the British
empire there is no instance of two houses of parlia-
ment having co-ordinate authority; but we have an
instance of it in America.
Mr. Pla.ypoed : We shall have to have an execu-
tive !
Sir SAMUEL GEIFFITH: I will come to that
directly. These are questions which lie at the root
of the whole matter, and until we know our own
minds upon them we cannot make much progress in
any matters of detail. It was pointed out early in
the history of America that there was great danger
of friction between the two houses differently con-
stituted. It is said it was only a compromise—that no
one thought it was the best plan at that time, but
it was the only compromise possible. I believe my-
self, as I said just now, it is the only compromise
possible now, and it is proposed in these resolutions.
I also believe, from the history of America for 100
years, that it was the best plan that could be devised,
and that we should do well to follow it, as you do,
sir. But I also desire at the present moment to
point out the necessary consequence of adopting that
principle, that we may know exactly what we are
doing. I will not further occupy time on that matter.
I desire at present rather to indicate these questions,


which must necessarily he considered and solved as
preliminary questions, than to argue at great length
in support of any of them. Indeed, sir, I desire to
follow your example this morning of brevity as far
as possible. With regard to the judiciary I do not
propose to occupy the time of the Convention now.
I believe there should bo a supreme court, and that
not on the American model, but a real court of
appeal for Australia from all the Australian courts.
Whether it should be absolutely final, or whether
there should be under any conditions a right of
appeal to a supreme court representing the whole
empire, differently constituted certainly from that
which now exercises that jurisdiction —whether there
should be such an ultimate power of appeal under
conditions, is a matter which may be considered later.
I confess that on that point my mind is open to con-
viction either way. But next to the question of tho
constitution of the Parliament, the legislative body,
leaving aside the question of tho judiciary, upon which
I believe we are nearly all agreed—comes the question
of the executive government; because, after all, the
legislature sits only sometimes, it is not in perpetual
session, while the work of the government must bo
carried on every day. Now, hero again, tho question
of the relationship of the executive to the legislature
appears on tho threshold. We are accustomed in
these colonies, as we have been accustomed from our
reading of tho history of the United Kingdom for the
last 100 years —not more, not so much indeed —to
the system called responsible government, and I will
venture to say that there are many misapprehensions
as to what is the essence of the system called respon-
sible government. We are accustomed to think that
the essence of responsible government is this: that
tho ministers of state have seats, most of them, in the
lower house of the legislature, and that when they
are defeated on an important measure they go out of
office. That I venture, with tho greatest submission,
to say is only an accident of responsible govern-
ment, and not its principle or its essence. In form—•
legal form, I mean, statutory form —so far as our
written Constitution goes, and so far as the un-
written and partly written Constitution of tho United
Kingdom goes, the system depends on these proposi-
tions—that the ministers are appointed by the head
of the state, tho Sovereign, or her representative,
and that they may hold seats in Parliament.
That is all that will be found in the Constitution
of the United Kingdom. ' They are appointed
by the head of the state, and some of them may
hold seats in Parliament —a limited number. That
is part of the written Constitution. In the Australian
colonies, with few exceptions, the same propositions
arc tho only ones that are to be found laid down by
positive law. The ministers are appointed by the
head of the state —the Sovereign’s representative —•
and they hold office during his pleasure, and they may,
or a certain number may, hold seats in Parliament.
In two of the colonies, I believe, is to bo found an
innovation, an addition to this proposition, stereo-
typing in formal language the practice that has grown
up in Great Britain and in the other colonies since
the system of responsible government has been
invented; that is, that some of the ministers shall
hold seats in Parliament. ATctoria and South Aus-
tralia, I believe, have provisions of that kind.
Mr. Barton : And Western Australia !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH; But that is not com-
mon by any means to the system of responsible
government, as it is known throughout the British
empire, nor as it is known in the other European
countries wdiere they have adopted, after profound
study, what they believe to be the essential principles
of the British Constitution as at present administered.
Mr. Gillies : It all comes to the same thing.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I wish to point out
that it does not at all come to the same thing. And
here I would again refer to that fundamental principle
that the two houses are differently constituted, and
that one is of equal authority with the other —the one
represents the states as states, and the other repre-
sents the people as people. Now, in America the
directly opposite form of government from that which
we call responsible government has been adopted.
I submit with great deference that the essential
difference is this: that there the ministers may not
sit in Parliament, whereas under our form of Govern-
ment ministers may sit in Parliament, and in practice
do. In the other form of government they cannot
sit in Parliament, they are expressly dissociated from
Parliament. The origin of this difference lies in tho
fact that tho framers of the American Constitution
had been frightened by the tendency then lately ex-
hibited in the United Kingdom of ministers to over-
awe Parliament, and they thought it extremely desir-
able to separate the executive and legislative branches
of government, following the arguments of a great
writer —I should rather say a celebrated writer —of
thosedays, Montesquieu, the wisdom of whoseobserva-
tions and the accuracy of whose deductions and
assumption of principles may be, I submit with great
respect, very open to doubt. But the Americans
adopted that system —that the executive shall bo
entirely dissociated from Parliament, and therefore
may not sit in Parliament. As I believe that tho
history of the American Constitution has shown the
wisdom of having two houses of equal and co-ordinate
authority, so also has it shown the unwisdom of the
system there adopted of having ministers dissociated,
and the executive government entirely dissociated,
from the legislature. It has taught us the lesson
that the character of legislation, the manner of
legislation, and the result of legislation, the orderly
conduct of business, and the good government of tho
country, are not nearly so well attained under the
American system, where the executive is dissociated
from Parliament, as under the system we have, where
practically ministers are intimately associated with
Parliament. But this is Avhat I desire to point out.
In America we have the system of two houses with
co-ordinate jurisdiction.
Mr. Baker: Not quite !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Well, for the pur-
pose lam speaking of. When I use the word co-
ordinate, I use it with reference to what I said
before—that tho house representing the states must
concur in every law that is passed. We have had in
America the system of two houses with powers co-
ordinate for that purpose.
Mr. Gillies : No !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I say co-ordinate for
the purpose of which I am speaking —that the states
must concur as well as the people in the passing of
any law. We have on the one hand the system of
ministers being dissociated and excluded from Par-
liament. We have on the other hand, in all the
British-speaking communities, the other system —tho
system where one house is practically predominant,
and where ministers have been associated with, and
have practically, during the last fifty or sixty years,
depended for their existence entirely upon, the
pleasure of the Parliament. Now, what is proposed
to be done ? We propose, as I understand it,
assuming that the house representing the states is
to have the authority which I think it must and
ought to have, to associate with it a system which
has never in the history of the world been tried in
conjunction w r ith it. We propose to have an execu-
tive government having possibly, and having probably,
seats in Parliament. How shall we guai’antee that
the machine will w'ork if we insist that these
ministers shall hold their offices in form as well as in
reality, by the will of one house only? Does not
the possibility of a very serious deadlock occur hero
to every hon. gentleman at once ? The majority of
one house of the legislature will certainly be made
up of the representatives of tho larger colonies.


Probably two colonies in that bouse will be able to
overshadow all the rest.
Mr. Platfoed : Possibly one !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Possibly one some
day; but almost certainly two at no distant date.
Now, that majority representing the people of these
two states in that house would have the making and
unmaking of governments. On the other hand, there
would be an independent body in the constitution
representing the states. Suppose that independent
body in the constitution representing the state differed
from these two states —and I look to more than six
or seven states in this territory—suppose they differed
from the house of representatives representing two
states, there would be certainly a deadlock at once.
Such a thing, I believe, occurred in one of the neigh-
bouring colonies not very long ago. I point this out
as a thing that may happen. I point out also that
the experiment we propose to try has never yet been
tried, We must take into consideration the existence
of those two forces possibly hostile, even probably
hostile, before, say, fifty or a hundred years are over,
and we must frame our constitution in such a way
that it will work if that friction does arise.
Mr. Playfoed : We will have the referendum; we
will do it that way!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : What is the way to
do it I am not now considering. But I hope I am not
misunderstood in calling attention to that difficulty
as likely to arise. I believe myself that the system
which we call responsible government is the best
that has yet been invented in the history of the world
for carrying on the good government of the people,
and I hope that it will be instituted in the Federal
Government of Australia. But, at the same time, I
desire to point out the great possibility—almost pro-
bability —that that system, as we have it at the present
time, if we insist upon members of the executive being
members of the legislature, and insist upon their
commanding always a majority in one house of the
legislature, may not work. We have to devise a
constitution that will work, that will have Avithin its
bounds sufficient scope to allow of any development.
I would point out, by way of further illustration,
that under the Constitution of England, written and
unwritten, under the Avritten constitution of Canada,
New South Wales, and, indeed, of all the colonies,
except Victoria, South Australia, and Western Aus-
tralia, and in them to a limited extent, the whole
system of the relationship between the executive and
the legislative branches might be changed in practice
without the change of a word in the Avritten Consti-
tution.
Mr. Gillies : How ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I will proceed to
slioav how. It would not be contrary to the Consti-
tution of New South Wales, or of Queensland, or
of Tasmania, or of New Zealand, if no member of
the Executive had a seat in either house of the legis-
lature. The Constitution would work just as it does
Avork. The ministers would be appointed by the
Governor as her Majesty’s representative. They
Avould hold office during his pleasure, and if the
legislature thought that that was a more convenient
Avay of carrying on the business, it Avould be carried
on in that way.
Mr. Gillies : And they would play “ ducks and
drakes ” Avith the business; no one Avould be res-
ponsible !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I believe myself that
would be the result. But I do not profess to know
all that is going to happen in the next fifty or a
hundred years. I do not profess to say that our
experience in the Australian colonies, or even the
experience of Great Britain, is necessarily to be set
up against the Avisdom of America. I give credit to
the American people for having a good deal of
AA'isdom ; and although I believe their system is not
nearly as good a one as ours, yet some people think
that even our system is not perfect, and contains
Avithin it the elements of change,
Mr. Gillies : It has not changed for centuries!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: The present system,
as we have it, has not been in existence for one
century, or ’nearly one century. I have had long
enough experience as a member of Parliament and as
a minister to have seen very great changes in the
relationship of ministers to one another, and of
ministers to Parliament, in the Australian Colonies.
I have seen changes —changes occurring from time to
time. You do not see the change when it takes
place; but if you look back fifteen or twenty years,
you can see bow different things are in many respects,
compared with what they were.
Dr. Cockbubn : That. shows the advantage of
having an elastic constitution!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: That is the conclusion
I arrive at—that it is well to have a constitution so
elastic as to allow of any necessary development that
may take place.
Mr. Deakin : Capable of being amended!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Everything is capable
of being amended. But lam addressing myself to
the problem I understand we have before us, of a
constitution which we hope will work like the Ameri-
can Constitution has worked for so many years,
without the necessity of radical amendment. Be-
cause, bear in mind the difficulty of amendment.
The difficulty of an amendment on a radical question
like that would be very great indeed. I am not by
any means counselling a departure from the system
of responsible government, which I am in favour of,
which I hope will be inaugurated, and which I hope
will continue to be carried on; but I cannot shut
my eyes to the fact that the senate representing the
states may entirely differ from the house of repre-
sentatives representing the people; and that if it is
laid down as a principle of the constitution that the
Queen’s representative is bound to dismiss his minis-
ters when they fail to command a majority in the
people’s house, then we deliberately, and Avith our eyes
open, make provision for a very serious deadlock
occurring, and that at a very early period in the
history of the constitution.
Mr. Gillies : No.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I am perfectly aware
that this view is new to many hon. members.
Mr. Gillies : Oh, no !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: lam perfectly aware
that this view is new to many hon. members who
have been accustomed to think that the essence of
responsible government is that ministers should sit
in Parliament, whereas I contend that the essence is
that ministers should not be dissociated from Parlia-
ment. Our present development of the constitution
requires them to sit in Parliament. I hope that will
continue to be the development. But I say we are
launching in this respect upon an entirely unknown
sea. Nobody has ever tried this experiment of a
government depending on one house, and the
machinery of the state equally depending upon
another.
Mr. Gordon : The senate Avill probably be the
better house of the two !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I am quite certain
that the senate Avill consider itself quite as good a
house as the other house. I believe also that the
state legislatures will insist upon its maintaining that
position. I hope that no friction of this kind will
arise; but I have thought it my duty, at this early
stage, to point out the apparent inconsistency, to my
mind, of the system of giving equal powers to the
states as represented in one house, and of making the
executive government depend for its existence upon
the other house.
Mr. Gillies : It must be so, for every house that
has got the responsibility of the money must have
the control!


Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: The hon. gentle-
man interjects that it must be so, for every house
that has the responsibility of the money must have
the ultimate control. That I perfectly concede.
One house must have the responsibility of origina-
ting expenditure, and of originating taxation ; and,
therefore, to that extent it will have a controlling
effect, and no doubt finance is at the root of every-
thing. The government cannot be carried on with-
out money. But there are many things in the ad-
ministration of government besides finance. For
instance, this development might occur, and might be
the result of the practical experience of fifty years or
a hundred years, or, perhaps, a much shorter time—
that some of her Majesty's ministers controlling parti-
cularly those matters with which it is specially the
function of the house of representatives to deal,
should command the support of that house ; but that
others, administering what may be called more per-
manent departments, should be independent of it—
that there should be, in fact, a combination of the
two forms of government; and which of us is wise
enough to say that our successors will not be able to
improve upon anything which we have devised ? Is
not that possible ?
Mr. GILLIES : Quite possible; but what is not ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I am pointing out
that we are launching upon an unknown sea. We
are trying to lay down two hard and fast lines, which
are apparently inconsistent with one another, and
insisting that nevertheless they shall both be observed.
I ask, therefore, that hon. members will give their
attention to this, and that in considering the forma-
tion, functions, and tenure of office of the execu-
tive, they will endeavour to provide against that
contingency, by making such provision that what-
ever the wisdom of our successors shall find to be
best it may be possible for them to do without
the extremely inconvenient method of a revision
of the constitution in which the federal parliament,
as well as all the states, must collectively concur. A
difficulty of that kind would arise in a time of great
excitement. It is not like the difficulty of making a
law. When you want to make a law,and you cannot all
agree in making it, there is simply no law made, and you
go on as before. But the government of the country
must be carried on ; you cannot suspend the govern-
ment of the country while you call a constitutional
convention, and get the consent of all the states
to the amendment. Therefore, it is necessary to
provide for it in our constitution. I have referred
to this matter at rather greater length than I should
have desired; but it is a matter of very great
importance, and it underlies the whole of our work.
The relative constitution and powers of the two
houses of legislature underlie the whole of what we
have to do. We must remember that it is quite
new to all of us. We have had no experience of its
working. We are bound to put ourselves in the
position of men sitting in one house or the other—
of men sitting in the senate representing a small
state, and feeling bound to exercise a controlling
influence as far as it can be exercised; or as men
supported by a large majority in the house of repre-
sentatives ; and wishing to exercise the authority
that men in that position feel they ought to exercise.
We ought to put ourselves in each of these positions
and imagine what arguments we should be likely to
use under such circumstances. Ido not propose to
move any amendment to the resolutions now before
us. I apprehend that it is desirable, for the present,
that the discussion should be somewhat general,
although I hope that, before the resolutions are
finally put from the chair, we shall have an oppor-
tunity, either in Committee of the Whole or in
some other way, as by taking the. resolutions seriatim,
to propose any amendments that hon. gentlemen
may think desirable in order to render them accept-
able.
The President : Before the hon. member concludes,
I desire to say that it is my intention, on the floor of
the House, to move that the Convention resolve itself
into Committee of the Whole to consider the reso-
lutions in detail.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I have very few words
more to say. I trust I have made my arguments clear
to hon. gentlemen, whether lam right or wrong. I
am perfectly open to conviction, but entertaining these
views with a greater or less degree of confidence, and
entertaining, at any rate, the idea that they are very
important matters for consideration, I thought it my
duty to bring them forward for the consideration of
the Convention at this early stage, because they cer-
tainly ought to be fully .considered. I shall only
indicate in what respect I think these resolutions may
be modified, not with a desire to alter the practical
result at which the President aims in the resolutions
that he has submitted—not as indicating a desire that
the federation should not in practice work upon those
lines, because I entirely concur with them, and hope
that the Convention will concur with them —but be-
cause! desire that the machine may be made one that
will work, and of which its framers will not be ashamed.
I have indicated that I think the 2nd and 3rd resolu-
tions might be transposed, the coming into operation
of the 2nd necessarily following upon practical effect
being given to the principle laid down in the 3rd reso-
lution. With respect to defining the powers of the
legislature, I would respectfully suggest to the Con-
vention that we should consider whether it would not
be better to declare that the house of representatives
should have the sole power of originating the imposi-
tion of taxation and the appropriation of revenue,
leaving to the senate representing the states the power
of veto, which they, I believe, will claim upon every
matter of legislation.
Mr. Gillies : But not amendment!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Power of veto—that
is, amendment by omission, veto in part. That is
what I mean.
Hon. Members : No, no !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Yeto in part, because
the system of tacking is absolutely inconsistent with
the theory of equal authority.
Mr. Gillies : Does the hon. member mean that
the senate could take one part and leave out the
other ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Suppose a majority of
the house of representatives proposed to spend
£1,000,000 or £2,000,000, raised from customs, or
perhaps by loan, to establish an arsenal or to establish
a very large federal force, and the majority of the
states disapproved of it, they ought to be allowed to
disapprove of it, whether it was brought in as a
separate bill or included as an item of appropriation:
that is, I wish that the power of veto should be a real
one.
An Hon. Member : Would that be veto of the
whole ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I only wish to make
my meaning clear. I know that that power is exer-
cised in some of the colonies of Australia at present,
not that I believe in its being under our present
Constitution. I have had the pleasure, or rather the
experience, of a fight with the Legislative Council of
our own colony when it attempted to omit an item
in the estimates, but it became law all the same and
during the same session, I do not in the least
depart from that; but lam pointing out that we are
trying a new experiment; that the states will claim
the power of veto, and when we are considering the
matter de novo, as we now are —not dealing with one
homogeneous community such as we have to deal with
in our present colonies, where the Upper House
really is, under any constitution yet devised, weaker
in practice than the other House, so that the principle
works very well —when we are considering a
thoroughly new system, it does not follow that it


would be best to adopt tbe same system which we
have followed up to the present time under quite
different conditions. With regard to the imposition
of taxation; I would not allow the senate to originate
taxation, but I would allow them to veto —to refuse
to accept taxation.
An Hon. Member: Would the hon. member allow
them to do so in detail P
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: To veto in detail.
For instance, suppose the house of representatives
proposed to impose a land-tax, and, 1 will say, an
income-tax together in one bill, why should not the
senate, representing the states, have the power of
dealing with each proposal ? A land-tax might be
in one state or in sevei’al states a most just and
proper thing, while in other states it might be most
unfair and improper. So with an income tax. It
might be very fair, it might be easily collected,
convenient, and desirable with respect to one state,
while it might be absolutely impossible with respect
to another. Why should not the senate have the
power of veto ? Why should not the senate have
the power of saying, “ We will have the one, but not
the other ” ? Both houses would have to concur in
the omission. 1 maintain that the more hon. members
think of this subject the more they will see the
necessity, if wo are to have two houses, one repre-
senting the states and the other the people, of
allowing the house representing the states the power
of veto in detail as well as in the whole, instead of
following what is really an artificial growth of com-
paratively recent years in our own system of two
houses in-a single homogeneous state.
Mr. Gillies : That would be a law for one province
and not for another!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I am sorry that the
hon. member misapprehends me. I have not indi-
cated that in any way. All that I have endeavoured
to convey is that a law which might commend itself
to the majority of the house of representatives as
suitable to the states they represented, might be
entirely unsuitable to all the other states, and those
states, therefore, should have the right of refusing
to make such a general law,
Mr. Gillies : That is exactly what I said !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: With respect to the
executive, the suggestions that I would offer would
go in this direction: Instead of providing that the
ministers shall sit in Parliament we should say that
they may sit in Parliament, I have doubts myself
whether we might not also say that their term of
office should depend upon their retaining the confi-
dence of the legislature; but it should be provided
that they may, not that they must, sit in Parliament.
If we do that and do no more, we shall have gone as
far as it was ever thought necessary to go in the
United Kingdom, as far as was thought necessary to
go by the gentlemen who sat in this hall many years
ago, and who framed the Constitution which has
been the mother of all the Australian constitutions,
and which has certainly stood the test of time.
They left that Constitution open to further develop-
ment. It has had further development, and it will
have much more development. I ask hon. gentlemen
in considering this question to be careful to frame
the Constitution in such a manner that, whatever
developments the necessities of the times may
require, it will be possible to adopt them without the
trouble of anything like a deadlock, or the interrup-
tion of the executive government of the country.
I have been much longer than I intended in address-
ing the Convention, but I have endeavoured to
express my mind as briefly as I could. However,
the subject is a large one and must be dealt with
fully, and I hope hon. gentlemen will pardon me if I
have intruded too long upon their time.
Mr. FTSH: As an exemplification of what I hope
will be the great principle which must be established
before the work of this Convention shall be closed—
the principle that the colonies, at any rate in connec-
tion with our senatorial work, shall be equal—l rise
now to continue the debate upon the resolution Avhich
you have submitted. I make no excuse other than
the one which I have offered, except this: that I
am aware that in the case of a number of gentlemen
who have travelled from all parts of Australasia,
and who largely represent the executives of their
various colonies, they are here, not so much at their
own personal inconvenience as at the inconvenience
of the executives which they represent. A goodly
number of the ministers of the Crown of all our
colonies are now assembled in Sydney —some GOO
and some 1,200 miles away from their seats of
government —and practically some of the executive
work of our colonies is at a standstill while we are
present here. It is, therefore, almost an absolute
necessity that a goodly number of the members of
governments must find their way back, at an earlier
period than that at which this Convention can close,
to their executive duties in their own particular locali-
ties. Under these circumstances, I think it is of the
utmost importance that there shall not be one day's
delay in proceeding with the important business Avhich
AVO have before us. Therefore, although I Avas desirous
to aAvait someAvhat the issue of this debate, to en-
deavour, perhaps, to gather some inspiration from Avhat
might be said by various speakers who haA r e for a longer
period ruled over destinies somewdiat greater than those
which I have had the pleasure of presiding over in the
smaller colony of Tasmania; yet, Avhen I think that Ave
stand in the hall which is memorable by reason
of great difficulties overcome, by spirits with whom I
hope we are someAvhat kindred —one of Avhose por-
traits looks down upon us at the present time —Avhich
portrait reminds us of the difficulties which, appar-
ently, may embarass the discussion of these reso-
lutions, difficulties many of which have been described
to us by the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith—when
I remember what has been done by the men of old,
who framed our present constitutions, which we have
been working under for thirty-five or forty years, I
am disposed to believe that, embarrassed though Ave
may be by the conflicting opinions—l will not say
conflicting interests, for when Australia is spoken of
we are no longer to have conflicting interests —we
shall be able to get over the difficulties arising from
those conflicting opinions which may be expressed in
this chamber with respect to these various resolutions.
I do not propose to follow the line of argument
adopted by the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith.
There will be opportunities of doing so, as you, sir,
have told us, in Committee. And if you had not
announced that it Avas your purpose to move that
the resolutions be considered in Committee of the
"Whole, I should have deemed it my duty to have
reminded hon. members that subjects so important,
so diverse, could not possibly be dealt with by a body
sitting as Ave noAV are ; but that every Avord of each
resolution would have to be Aveighed and debated.
That cannot possibly be done unless the House finds
its way into Committee of the Whole. For these
reasons I purpose to address myself only to general
principles, to Avhat I deem to be the essential
portions of these resolutions, treating the matter
as if I Avere asking for or supporting the second
reading of a bill, when Ave debate principles
only, and not details. Although a measure may
be 100 or 200 paragraphs in length, whatever
may be the diverse opinions of hon. members
Avhen we go into Committee, it is only with the great
principles of the bill which we are supposed to deal
when discussing its second reading. Therefore, for
my purpose, I may limit my observations to what I
regard as the essential portions of the Avork of this
Convention. I feel sure that those essential portions
are discovered in the three great points of commercial
union, of defence, and Avhat I ought to have taken
first —that is, what is known in America as the


sovereignty of the states. I doubt whether the
general public has any particular interest at the pre-
sent moment in the method in which you will frame
your executive, and in the mode in which your duties
will be discharged. But I believe the interest which
is now concentrated around this Convention through-
out the whole of the Australasian colonies, centres
around those three questions which I have named,
and it is with respect to those that the great masses
of the people are more concerned than they are with
any other. They are more concerned, firstly, as to
what portion of the rights which they have been
enjoying for nearly forty years past it shall be pro-
posed by this Convention to surrender. I am glad
that the term " surrender" has been used in the first
resolution. It should be indicative to all those whom
we represent throughout Australasia, that this Con-
vention is unlikely to try their patience, to try their
spirit of justice, in asking them to surrender any
rights which they consider to be of vital importance
to their local autonomies, that it is unlikely to ask
them to surrender any rights which will not be more
fittingly discharged by the greater executive of the
dominion parliament. If, therefore, we are to explain
in connection with these resolutions what we mean
by surrender, I would limit my explanation to a very
few words. I say that it will be absolutely unneces-
sary to ask the people of these colonies to surrender
to the dominion parliament anything which can best be
legislated for locally—anything which cannot be best
legislated for by a central executive. Now, these
may be far embracing words, but every man who runs
may read in connection with an opinion of this kind,
because he himself will be able as well as any of us
to detect what it is that is best discharged locally.
ITe will know that, with respect to the great future
progress of his country, it must be by liis voice that
the extension of railways and of roads must be con-
tinued. He must know that it must be by his will
and consent that possibly the education of the people
shall be provided; and he must know that, in
connection with the various developments of his own
province, there can be no interference by an executive
which will sit 1,000 miles away, and which cannot,
except in regard to some individual members thereof,
have so close an identity with the work in which he is
engaged, or such a knowledge of the necessities which
surround the country in which he is living, as those
who represent him in the local parliaments. I believe,
therefore, that we may limit our explanation of the
term " surrender " to these very few words, and that
the people may at once feel sure that this Convention
is unlikely to ask them to give up any important
right; but that its purpose will be to continue in
all its harmony, in all its prestige, the position of
the local parliaments, and that the dominion par-
liament, the great executive of the higher national
sphere at which we are to arrive, will not in any
way detract from it. But they will continue, most
likely, uuder the Constitution under which they
live, to have the right of appointing their own
representatives to their own local parliaments, and,
possibly to have also in connection therewith their
Upper Chamber; and certainly in all matters
their voice will be paramount. Under these circum-
stances, I deem it that our duty in connection
with this paragraph of the resolution will not be a
difficult one. We are not likely to disappoint the
people ; and when we come to questions of detail we
shall each be prepared to agree, I have no doubt, most
readily, as to what work of the dominion will be best
undertaken by the dominion parliament,, and what
will be best understood and undertaken by the local
parliaments. But, turning from this, which I believe
to be the crux of the whole position —because it is to
the sovereign rights of the states that the people's
mind is more directed than to any other matter —if
there be any other point which they are considering
more deeply, and which affects their interest more
deeply, it is that which is opened up by the the great
question as to the form of our trading between each
other, as to whether it is to be as it has been in the
past, a question of wasteful competition between
colonies—whether we are bound to continue to be
aliens to each other and to tax our very children as
they pass from their homes, or whether we are going
to establish something which will be akin to the com-
mercial bund of Germany —something which will
enable all the goods, all the manufactures, all the
arrivals in the various ports of these colonies to pass
to and fro through every other port without fear, let,
or hindrance. It is in connection with the commercial
union of these colonies that the people are more
interested in our proceedings, I think, than in con-
nection with any other subject. It is a question
which affects not only commercial men, but even the
lowest strata of society. Our working-classes are as
much interested in the commercial union, which I hope
is designed in these resolutions, as those who may be
large importers, or who may be supposed to hold more
important positions in our community. And when we
shall have become a union of commercially-established
people, no longer competing with each other in con-
nection with matters where there is a wasteful compe-
tition, but shall have realised all the advantages of a
great corporation —of a great commercial partnership,
then I think will be established in Australasia the
greatest good of the greatest number, and the people,
the great masses of the community, will have reason to
be grateful that this Convention has sat. But there
is also the other third important point to which your
resolutions so definitely refer —I allude to the
question of defence. It is marvellous that w r e can
for so long a period have travelled on our way
accumulating wealth, distributing our commerce all
over the country, sending our ships into almost all
seas, and yet have never established any reliable
defence for the whole. I know that a great number
of individuals consider the probabilities of any attack
upon these shores as very unlikely; but we must
always be prepared for the unlikely, for it is the
unlikely which too often happens. I hold that we
have no reliable forces —there is no cohesion in our
existing forces to carry out the great work for which
they have been intended, and for which large expendi-
ture is going on year by year. There can be no co-
hesion where the links are distributed in all corners,
and although w r e, as public men, have sworn allegiance
to the Crown, and the people themselves have owned
that allegiance, we are not in a position to defend
the allegiance which w r e owe, and irrespective of this
fact, since we have borrowed over £170,000,000 from
our creditors in all parts of the world, if there be any
fear of some desultory marauder ever attacking some
of these colonies we shall find commercially, and
in connection with the depreciated value of our
securities, that w r e have been living in a fool's
paradise, and that we should have been much
wiser had we discharged to ourselves, to the old
country, whose flag we have reared, and to the
creditors whose money we have borrowed, the respon-
sibility which rests upon every English community
of defending itself from attacks, from whatever
quarter they may come. The hon. member who has
just resumed his seat may possibly have borne in
mind the examples in connection w r ith the position of
the upper and lower branches of the legislature and
their relative powers, which have now existed for
thirty-five years, both in South Australia and in
Tasmania. I should not have ventured to have spoken
about Tasmania in this relationship, because it might
be said that it was an example which did not bear the
importance which I was attaching to it, did I not find
that Tasmania has been associated w r ith South Aus-
tralia in connection with the reading of the samo
Constitution —that she has been living under the
same Constitution, and that some of the same diffi-
culties have arisen, and have always been fairly


overcome in the end in both cases. I am not prepared
to consider—or if prepared to consider, I should
consider it with very great concern—as to whether it
is advisable or not to remove from what may be
termed the senate or the upper house of the dominion
parliament, any right which heretofore we had given
to our upper house, of veto, whether in respect of
ordinary bills or in respect of money bills. We have
lived for this period under a right which we have
seldom felt to be grievous, and if the right has been
exercised by the Legislative Council its existence has
only been grievous for a few days ; and that which has
been resented at the time, and which may have been
hurtful to the ministries of the day, has not always
proved to be detrimental to the community and to the
people as a whole ; but the very check which has been
exercised by the Legislative Council, I believe I may
say of South Australia, as I do of Tasmania, has proved,
under many circumstances, to have been the outcome
of prudence; and although the legislative councils
may not, on the first time of asking, have given the
ministers all the taxation which they desired, or have
given the representatives of the people in the popular
branch of the Assembly all the public works which
they needed, yet the people have always ruled in the
end, and the Legislative Council has after a time
given way. We have discovered in these colonies what
has been so long ago discovered elsewhere, that, in
the end, the popular voice must rule ; and certainly
we admit the very principle which is the foundation
of all our liberties—that taxation and representation
must go hand in hand, that where the representation
so largely is there you must have the power of the
purse. But we do not consider it an uncontrolled
power, and we have not felt any injury from the fact
that there has, occasionally, been a brake put upon
the wheel in connection with our public expenditure,
or in connection with our proposals for schemes of
taxation. I should therefore view with very great
jealousy a departure from this principle—the growth
of the practice in connection with which I have
watched for so many years—and should expect the
mover of these resolutions, in laying down so great
a departure as this from what has been the principle,
at any rate, in two of the great colonies of Australia
Mr. Playford : No !
Mr. FTSH: To be able to give us exceedingly
sound data for the purposes and objects which he
advocates; and we shall then, in regarding those
objects, take care to do what great senators and
statesmen of old have done with respect to the Con-
stitution under which we live—look well ahead to see
that we are not committing ourselves to that un-
known sea to which Sir Samuel Griffith has alluded.
Mr. Playford : No !
Mr. FYSH: Do I understand the hon, delegate
from South Australia to say that with respect to the
colony which he represents they have not found this
practice in the main satisfactory ? History only re-
cords one very important instance with respect to
South Australia where there has been such a diversity
of opinion as to lead to a rupture, and what was the
result of that great diversity of opinion ? If I am
right, the popular branch of the legislature did in the
end win, and those houses of Parliament which stand
as a credit io South Australia to-day have afforded
an example of what I have been alluding to. I do
not purpose, having said there were three important
principles which would govern me in connection with
these matters, to follow those points which are so
much better dealt with by the law officers of the
various governments, whom I am pleased to know
are associated with us in this work, but that we
ought to have a judiciary which shall be a federal
court for the whole of Australasia must be apparent
to all of us, whether we are, or are not, largely en-
gaged in trade. Those who have been making the
laws of their own colonies, and those whose busi-
nesses have compelled the making of these laws, have
felt the disadvantages of the incongruity of the bank-
ruptcy acts, and, domestically, we regard our marriage
and divorce laws as great incongruities ; and when
we free our ports there can be no doubt that the
regulations as to the navigation of our fleets, and
matters connected with our quarantine ports, and
various other subjects of that kind, must be a federal
concern; but as to whether it may be wise to be so
self-contained in Australasia in connection with our
judiciary system as not to permit an appeal outside of
Australasia must be a matter of which I trust the law
officers which are so well representing their respective
colonies here will put clearly before the Convention.
I lean strongly to the hope that the time is coming in
Australasia when we shall be as self-contained in law
and in manufactures as we are self-contained in climate
and ability to provide for ourselves not only the
ordinary and common necessaries of life, but all those
luxuries which experience and wealth brings. We
are warned by our very wealth and progress that
there must be unanimity before this Convention
closes its debates. I am glad, therefore, that you,
sir, set a spirit of compromise, which I hope will
continue day by day to be manifested by every mem-
ber. I recognise the fact that no great good can be
accomplished in a Convention of this kind any more
than (among cabinets and legislators, unless we are
prepared to admit that wisdom does not rest with in-
dividuals ; but that there is a collective wisdom in the
Convention that is gathered together I have great
faith, and in it and upon it I rely to overcome all
difficulties, even such as those to which Sir Samuel
Griffith has referred, so that we may be able to take
back to our respective Parliaments the Constitution
which we are charged to prepare for them, and it will
be a very great disappointment, I believe, to "every
province in Australasia if anything shall occur in the
course of our debates, or if any great point shall arise
about which we cannot clearly see our way to meet
at the table and to effect some compromise upon —a
compromise which shall at once be judicious to the
opinions of the various hon. delegates, honorable to
the whole of them, and satisfactory to the commun-
ities which we serve.
Mr. M UNRO : After hearing your very important
and interesting speech, sir, and that of my hon. friend,
the Premier of Queensland, and also of the Premier
of Tasmania, and having these very important resolu-
tions before us for our consideration, I think we shall
require at least one night to think over them. For
that reason I move :
That the debate be now adjourned.
Colonel Smith seconded the motion.
Motion agreed to ; debate adjourned.
Convention adjourned at 4 p.m.
THURSDAY, 5 MARCH, 1891
Federal Constitution (second day’s debate) —Telegram from
the Queen —Federal Constitution (second day’s debate
resumed).
The President took the chair at 11 a.m.
FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.
SECOND DAY’S DEBATE.
Debate resumed on resolutions proposed by Sir
Henry Parkes (vide page 11).
Mr. MUNRO : Mr. President, in rising to address
myself to the important subject before the Conven-
tion, I have very great pleasure in congratulating
you upon the very excellent address you gave us
yesterday. It appeared to me that it was conceived
in the proper spirit. Whilst conciliatory to all of
us, and giving us good advice as to how the business
should proceed, it was, at the same time, very clear


and very distinct as to the principles upon which the
Constitution ought to be founded. I confess that I
felt very much relieved from anxiety on hearing the
manner in which you laid down to us how our
Constitution ought to be formed, because I felt, as
the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, indicated later
on, that we were surrounded with a large number of
difficulties—difficulties which we must endeavour to
overcome as best we can. At the same time, you,
sir, indicated to us the lines upon which we should
proceed ; and I feel assured that all the members of
the Convention will feel grateful to you for the
indication you gave them of your views with regard
to that matter. How, I may say that whilst the
speech was very conciliatory, it at the same time
followed very closely the instructions which we, as
delegates, have received. We have come here to
frame a Constitution, and the instructions that
were given to us, I am happy to say, are very
clearly laid down by the hon, member, Mr. Baker,
in the book which he was good enough to distribute
amongst us. He puts it in this form: That it is
desirable there should be a union of the Australian
colonies. That is one of the principles that has
already been settled by all our parliaments. Second,
that such union should be an early one —that is, that
we should remove all difficulties in the way in order
that the union should take place at as early a date
as possible. Third, that it should be under the
Crown. How, I am quite sure that is one of the
most important conditions of all with which we have
to deal —that the union that is to take place shall be
a union under the Crown. Fourth, that it should
be under one legislative and executive government.
That also is laid down by our various parliaments.
Fifth, that it should be on principles just to the
several colonies. I think these two points are the
points upon whijh we shall find the greatest difficulty
in arriving at conclusions which will be in accordance
with the instructions we have received, and, at the
same time, which will enable ns to form such a con-
stitution as will be valuable for the colonies. I
confess I agree very much with the President in his
remarks as to the union of the colonies, and as to
his remarks in the direction that the government we
are to form must be a stable government; that it
must be such as will be able to carry out effectively
not only the making of laws for the federated
colonies, but at the same time, as an executive, will
be able to carry out its own decisions and require-
ments, to preserve itself as a government for all the
colonies. You also laid down that it must be a
government as nearly as possible in accordance with
the principles of the British Constitution, that is to
say, that the ministry must be a responsible ministry,
and that the house of representatives must represent
the whole of the people. These matters were very
clearly laid down in your address. I also gathered from
your remarks that you were in favour of the ultimate
power, that is, the final decision in regard to the
finances, being in the house of representatives. I
know that my hon, friend, Sir Samuel Griffith, went
in another direction, though not very clearly ; but
you, sir, were very clear upon this point. Sir Samuel
Griffith, while practically agreeing with the President
with regard to these views, appeared to me to be sur-
rounded by doubts and difficulties. I was sorry that
he did not try to solve those doubts himself, because
it is scarcely fair to us who have not studied this
matter from the legal point of view, as the hon.
member has done, to have submitted to us a number
of riddles which we are asked to solve.
Sir Samuel Geiffith : I thought I did solve
them!
Mr. MTJHRO: Well, if the hon. member solved
them, as far as my listening to him was concerned,
and my reading of his speech a second time this
morning, I really saw no solution—none whatever.
As far as I could gather he favoured a constitutional
government; but he doubted whether constitutional
government would work —and whilst he informed us
that he had grave doubts as to constitutional govern-
ment working under our peculiar circumstances, he
did not indicate to us what sort of government would
work, and that is the difficulty which concerns me in
this matter. If he had said to us, “ Well, I feel sure,
after giving full consideration to this matter, that a
constitutional form of government will not work with
a senate and a house of representatives—the senate
representing the states, and the house of representa-
tives representing the whole of the people—that con-
stitutional government and responsible government
will not work,” it might have been different; but I
found no solution of the- difficulties in the hon.
gentleman’s remarks. He informed us that he
thought the senate ought to have power to amend
money bills with a view to avoiding deadlocks.
Sir Samuel Geiffth : Vetoing— amending by
omission!
Mr. MUHEO : I admit that the form of amend-
ing was by veto —that is, separating one portion from
another, vetoing one portion, and allowing another
portion to pass. At the same time, it is purely an
amendment. To omit a clause from a bill is to
amend the bill quite as much as to insert a clause.
The hon. gentleman pointed out that, in his opinion,
we were to get over deadlocks by giving the senate
power to amend money bills by discriminative veto,
if I may so call it—that they were to have a veto in
connection with money bills. The experience of the
past, however, tends entirely in a different direction.
It is entirely in the direction of showing that if the
upper house or senate has the power of amending
money bills it makes deadlocks more certain than
would be the case under any other circumstances,
because if we did not give power of amendment to
the senate, eventually the house of representatives
must of necessity prevail, because the people will
insist on their views being carried out. But if you
give the power of amending money bills to the senate,
the result will be that it is not the view of the people
that will prevail, but the views of a section of the
people. The hon. gentleman was good enough to
point out that, supposing two of the larger colonies
were in favour of the expenditure of £1,000,000 on
an arsenal, or on defences, or anything of that kind,
and a majority of the smaller colonies combined
against them, unless the senate had the power of
amendment the result would be that the will of the
majority of members would prevail. Let us take the
reverse of that. Let us take the case of 2,500,000
people who ought to be taxed for a particular
purpose, and 250,000 people, representing some of the
smaller states, are to have the power of preventing
them being taxed in a certain direction. What will
the result be ? The power of preventing taxation in
a certain direction must absolutely result in taxation
in another direction; and the result would be that
the minority would govern the majority. That would
be the practical outcome of the proposal. If the
states, through the senate, are going to be empowered
to veto the proceedings of the house of represent-
atives, so far as money matters are concerned, and
prevent the imposition of taxation in a given direc-
tion —if the minority can prevent that, the result mil
be that if you are to carry on government at all, as
you must impose taxation, you must impose that
taxation in accordance with the will of the minority.
Surely that is not what we wish to be done; surely
this Convention has not met for the purpose of
giving a power to the minority of the people of this
grand dominion to impose taxation on the majority
against their will. That will be the practical result
of Sir Samuel Griffith’s proposal. One side or
another must give way; and if the majority are
bound to give way, the result must be that the
minority will rule. Surely that is a state of affairs
to which my hon. friend does not wish to bring us.


Mr. Adte Douglas : What is the use of the
senate, then ?
Mr. MUNEO : I will come to that in a moment;
1 am only dealing with the question of finance at
present. The hon. gentleman also puts it that he
does not think the government or the executive
should be responsible to the house of representatives.
Sir Samuel Griffith : No, no. I said nothing
of the kind. I said I did not think it should be a
rigid rule of the Constitution that it must be respon-
sible to one house only. I repeated that about ten
times, and I thought I had made myself clear.
Mr. MUNEO : I admit that that is clear enough ;
but to whom is the executive to be responsible ? Is
it to be responsible to both houses ; will it be abso-
lutely necessary to have a vote of want of confidence
in both chambers to remove a government ? Is that
what is proposed ?
Sir Samuel Griffith : No, no !
Mr. MUNEO : I really want to understand where
we are, and what is meant. If the vote of the house
of representatives is not sufficient to dislodge a govern-
ment, what is sufficient ? What is to be the process
by which a government is to be dislodged ? What
is to be the process by which a government is to be
removed if the house of representatives has not the
power to remove them ? Whilst the hon. gentleman
submitted a number of conundrums to us, he did not
clearly show us how to get out of the difficulty. I
followed the hon. gentleman very closely, and I read
his speech very carefully this morning in order that
I might understand what he really means ; and it
appears to me that he brings us into this difficulty.
He says, “ I do not want this Constitution to provide
that the executive shall be responsible to the house
of representatives; I want the responsibility to be
divided between the two chambers.” But he has not
indicated how that is to be carried out; how the two
chambers are to act with the view of either appointing
or removing the executive. That is the difficulty
submitted to us, the difficulty which we do not get
over.
Sir Samuel Griffith : I propose to leave to the
future the avoiding of these difficulties, and that we
should not make difficulties in advance !
Mr. MUNEO : I understand our duty as delegates
to the Convention lies in this direction: that we are
to form a stable and workable government. We are
to form a constitution which will be so workable that
all interests in this grand dominion will be as fairly
represented as possible. We must have the instru-
ment sufficiently pliable to enable us to carry on
business in a proper manner. If we do not carry
this out we shall probably form an institution which
will be something like the congress which was origin-
ally formed in the United States, before they formed
the Constitution which now exists, and in regard to
which this is said in “ The United States, its History
and Constitution,” by Alexander Johnston, page 79:
The “Articles of Confederation,” adopted in 1777, were
thus calculated for the meridian of the state legislatures
which were to pass upon them. The new government was to
be merely “ a firm league of friendship” between sovereign
states, which were to retain every power not “expressly”
delegated to congress ; there was to be one house of congress,
in which each state was to have an equal vote, with no
national executive or judiciary; and congress, while keeping
the power to borrow money, was to have no power to levy
taxes, or to provide in any way for payment of the money
borrowed--only to make recommendations to the states, or
requisitions on the states, which they pledged their public
faith to obey. The states were forbidden to make treaties,
war, or peace, to grant titles of nobility, to keep vessels of
war or soldiers, or to lay imposts which should conflict with
treaties already proposed to France or Spain. Important
measures required the votes of nine of the thirteen states,
and amendments the votes of all. Congress had hardly more
than an advisary power at the best. It had no power to
prevent or punish offences against its own laws, or even to
perform effectively the duties enjoined upon it by the articles
of confederation. It alone could declare war; but it had no
power to compel the enlistment, arming, or support of an
army. It alone could fix the needed amount of revenue ; but
the taxes could only be collected by the states at their own
pleasure. It alone could decide disputes between the states ;
but it had no power to compel either disputant to respect or
obey its decisions. It alone could make treaties with foreign
nations, but it had no power to prevent individual states
from violating them. Even commerce, foreign and domestic,
was to be regulated entirely by the states, and it was not
long before state selfishness began to show itself in the regu-
lation of duties on imports. In everything the states were
to be sovereign, and their creature, the federal government,
was to have only strength enough to hind the states into
nominal unity, and only life enough to assure it of its own
practical impotence.
Surely we are not going to impose a form of govern-
ment of that kind. Surely we do not want to have a
government which will not have the inherent power
in itself, and a constitution which will not give the
inherent power to those who represent the whole of
the dominion, to carry on their own business. If we
are to divide that power equally in connection with
questions of finance, between the senate and the house
of representatives, the result would absolutely be want
of power to carry on business at all.
Sir Samuel Griffith : How about the United
States ?
Mr. MUNEO : The United States are in a totally
different position. In the United States the real
executive power is in the senate, because the senate
can veto the appointments made by the President,
and there is no responsible government. We are now
dealing, I understand, with the idea of having respon-
sible government in this dominion of ours. I, for one,
believe in responsible government. It is the only
form of government with which we are familiar, and
under which we are best able to do our business. But
how can you have responsible government if you have
a governor calling in an executive as his advisers, and
if after that executive has submitted financial measures
to the house of representatives, and shown that they
are absolutely necessary for the good of the country,
the senate vetoes the measures. Where, then, does
the responsibility lie? The responsibility must lie
in the senate, not in the house of representatives,
because if the senate is to prevent the house of
representatives carrying out financial operations the
result is that the senate is supreme. And that is the
difference between what we are proposing to do, and
what has occurred in the United States. 1 quite
admit that the United States system suits them; and
if we are simply going to form a republic, and to
establish an institution in which the executive will
not be in Parliament, and will not be responsible, the
state of affairs will be totally different. But lam
contemplating that this Convention has in view the
formation of true responsible government. Now, I
quite admit that in the Australian colonies we have
never had true responsible government. We have
what is called responsible government, but we have
not responsible government in reality. If we had
responsible government we should never have had
the troubles we have had in the past in regard to our
two chambers. If our ministers occupied the posi-
tions they ought to occupy under a dominion govern-
ment, and such as are occupied by the British
Government
Mr. Gillies : Have there been no troubles* in
England under responsible government p
Mr. MUNEO: I admit that they have had
troubles there and everywhere else. There are
troubles wherever human beings exist; but I say that
whilst there may be troubles, we are not called upon
to create them ourselves by bringing new parties into
the contract who will be bound to cause troubles
amongst us. The hon. member, Mr. Eysh, takes a
more hopeful view of the situation, and whilst lean-
ing, in some respects, towards giving some power to
the senate, he honestly admits that the ultimate
decision must be with the house of representatives ;
and without that I do not see how we are to form a
proper constitution at all. I was well pleased indeed
with the tone of his remarks in that direction. I


thought, he being a member of an upper chamber,
that his leaning might be strongly in another direction.
Dr. Cockburk: There is no analogy between a
senate and an upper chamber !
Mr. MUNEO : There is a little analogy ; they are
not the same, I admit.
Sir Thomas Mcllwraith : The hon. member’s
argument is founded on the fact that they are the
same!
Mr. MUNEO: Oh, no! I shall come to that matter
directly. I am only dealing at present with the ques-
tion of finance ; I am only dealing with the fact that
someone must be responsible for the finances. You
cannot arrange the finances of a country by having
co-ordinate jurisdiction in two chambers. While I
state what I have stated with regard to the remarks
of the President, with which I have already stated I
was very well pleased indeed, I am not so well pleased
with the resolutions. While you, sir, seemed to be
very clear as to your own ideas of what sort of con-
stitution we ought to have, the resolutions submitted
to us do not seem to be quite so clear in that direc-
tion ; and looking carefully through them it appeared
to mo that there was something wanting—that is,
with regard to the first series of resolutions ; I do
not mean with regard to the second series of resolu-
tions. The first series of resolutions states:
That the powers and privileges and territorial rights of the
several existing colonies shall remain intact, except in
respect of such surrenders as may be agreed ujoon as
necessary and incidental to the power and authority of
the national federal government.
Of course we could mould a constitution upon a
resolution of that sort in any direction we might think
proper. There is a certain amount of vagueness
about it which, perhaps, is necessary at the com-
mencement, but which, probably, will require to be
amended in Committee. I do not intend to submit
an amendment, but shall merely state my views as
to how the resolution ought to read. Instead of the
Ist resolution I would say :
The powers and authority necessary or incidental to the
federal government shall be set forth in the consti-
tution. The powers not delegated to the federal
government by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to
the federated colonies, are reserved to the colonies
respectively or to the people.
That is the wording of the latter part of one of the
clauses of the Constitution of the United States, and
it puts the matter very clearly as to what powers are
given to the federal government, and there is no
difficulty in understanding it. Then, with regard to
the second resolution:
That the trade and intercourse between the federated
colonies, whether by means of land carriage or coastal
navigation, shall be absolutely free.
I may say that there is some doubt in the minds of
some of the delegates with regard to what is intended
by this resolution. I can clearly understand that it
would be impossible to give effect to this resolution
until the federal parliament has passed a law giving
effect to it. That is my view with regard to it;
but others are of opinion that it is intended to put
this in the Constitution, and the result would be
that there would be intercolonial free trade before
the federal parliament had power to deal with the
tariff at all.
How. Members : No !
Mr. MUNEO: Of course that would be impos-
sible, and consequently I thought that this form
would suit better:
All customs duties shall be uniform throughout the feder-
ated colonies, and the power and authority to impose
such duties shall be vested in the federal house of
representatives. All laws imposing customs duties
shall be subject to the provision that trade and inter-
coursc between the federated colonies shall be free.
That would be provided by the law to be passed by
the federal parliament after it had met, instead of
being an doubt as it is at the present time. With
regard to the trade being free as between the colonies,
of course we who here represent a colony which has
for many years established a protective system must
be guarded in the action that we take in this
matter, because under our system very important
trades and manufactories and establishments have
been created, and unless we take some means to
secure that they shall not be ruthlessly dealt with,
and shall not be deprived of their position without
having any power to resist the action that is takeai
with regard to them, I think we should fail in our
duty. We are here undoubtedly to concede all that
we possibly can with a view to have a proper consti-
tution for the federated colonies ; we are here for
the purpose of establishing a thorough dominion,
and for the purpose of conceding all that we possibly
can; but I do not think we should be justified in
allowing any doubt to remain upon this question —
that is, on the question whether the intercourse
between the colonies should be free prior to the
federal parliament having power to form its own
tariff. I think that that question should bo put
beyond any doubt. I, for one, am quite sure that
we should be perfectly safe with the federal parlia-
ment ; I am quite satisfied on that point, but others
are not. Others hold a different opinion, and, of
course, we shall have considerable difficulty in getting
our constituents to agree with us in allowing the
federal parliament to deal with this question ; but we
shall have far greater difficulty in reconciling them
to the change if we are not clear in telling them
that prior to any free-trade existing between the
colonies the federal parliament will be enabled to
form its own tariff and pass its own laws. We
ought to be able to give them that assurance, and
I am quite sure that that is the intention of the
delegates here present, but we ought to have it put
in such a form that there can be no doubt about it.
With regard to the military and naval defence of
Australia being intrusted to federal forces, of course
no one can object to that; in fact, one of the reasons
why this Convention has been called into existence,
and why it is necessary to have the dominion at all, is
to have the defences put on a proper footing. There
is no doubt at all about that; but in order to do that
it is absolutely necessary that the power of initiating
taxation should be in the hands of the executive, and
that the house of representatives should have the
power of the purse. I have added further, altering
the form of the resolution:
After the portion required for federal purposes has been
reserved, the revenue derived from customs duties shall
be equitably distributed among the federated colonies
on the basis of population.
I put it in that form for this reason, that the customs
duties are really derivable from the colonies in pro-
portion to population, for the larger the population
the larger will be the consumption of dutiable articles,
and consequently there should be some equitable
system by which they would get a return in propor-
tion to the amount derived from them. With regard
to the further resolutions, I quite concur in the reso-
lutions on this paper, with perhaps one or two slight
amendments. The constitution of the legislature is
thus described;
A parliament, to consist of a senate and a house of repre-
sentatives, the former consisting of an equal number of
members from each province, to be elected by a system
which shall provide for the retirement of one-third of
the members every years, so securing to the body
itself a perpetual existence combined with definite
responsibility to the electors, the latter to be elected by
districts formed on a population basis, and to possess
the sole power of originating and amending all bills
appropriating revenue or imposing taxation.
Then, for the administration of justice in its highest
form, it is proposed to establish
a judiciary, consisting of a federal supreme court, which
shall constitute a high court of appeal for Australia,
under the direct authority of the Sovereign, whose
decisions, as such, shall be final.


Upon the latter clause I have some doubt. lam not
quite sure that it would be prudent for us at this
stage to absolutely prevent any Australian from
appealing to the Privy Council under any circum-
stances. lam not quite sure that we ought to go so
far as that at the present stage. lam not quite sure
that we ought not to leave open some door by which,
at least for the present, the power of appeal now
existing should not be changed for some time. I
think, Mr. President, that that is one of the links
that bind us to the home country. We who are loyal
subjects of the Queen arc always anxious that noth-
ing should be done to even weaken any link that binds
us to the mother country, and the power of appeal in
certain cases, along with the appointment of our
colonial governors, are really the two important links
that bind us to the home country.
Mr. Dibbs : Cutting the first strand of the painter?
Mr. MUNRO : I think so. Although we are not
called upon at this stage to deal with details, I think
it is absolutely necessary to mention some of the
details, in order to give our interpretation of what
we wish the Constitution to be, because we might
talk for a month about generalities and never come
to anything practical, unless we indicate some of the
details which we wish to see in the Constitution ; and
for that reason I mention some of the things that I
should like to see provided for ; of course, mention-
ing them merely with the view of showing the direc-
tion in which my mind goes in these matters. Por
instance, I think we should provide, first of all, for
the governor-general to be appointed by the Crown —
I do not think that there is much difference of
opinion on that point —that the senate should be
elected or appointed by the legislature of the various
colonies ; that the house of representatives, or com-
mons, should be elected by the whole people of the
various colonies.
Sir Thomas Mcllwhaith : Women, of course,
included.
Mr. MUNRO : I have not the least objection to
their being included.
Sir Thomas Mcllweaith : That is what the hon.
member said.
Mr. MUNRO : When we talk of the whole people,
we mean the whole of the electors.
Sir Thomas Mcllwbaith : The males !
Mr. MUNRO: That is the law at present. If
you like to alter the law, I have no objection to
women having votes ; but I am dealing with matters
as they stand at present. At present the electors
of the whole of the colonies should elect the
house of representatives. Then —this is a point to
which Mr. Douglas called my attention —the two
houses should have co-ordinate power with regard to
general legislation; leaving the question of finance
out of consideration, on all other questions the two
houses should have co-ordinate power. Then the
interests of the various states would be protected as
to general legislation. But the house -of represen-
tatives, or commons, ought to be supreme in ques-
tions of finance. I have not the least doubt whatever
on that point. Then, as I have already stated, there
should be a common tariff and intercolonial free-
trade. I think that the following powers should be
given to the federal government: The regulation of
trade and commerce, including bankruptcy laws and
sea fisheries; navigation and shipping laws, including
the management of pilots, beacons, buoys, and light-
houses ; control of the post-offices and telegraphs ;
the laws with regard to marriage and divorce and
probate; the defences by sea and land; loans for
federal purposes ; engagement of federal officials;
payment of federal salaries ; banking, currency, and
coinage; bills of exchange and promissory-notes;
census and statistics ; patents and copyrights ; weights
and measures; federal criminal law's, gaols, &c.;
aliens and naturalisation.
Mr. Moore : Does the hon. member associate the
question of taxation with that of finance ?
Mr. MUNRO : Certainly.
Mr. Moore : Does the hon. member mean to limit
the sole control of all taxation to the house of repre-
sentatives ?
Mr. MUNRO : I say that they should have the
ultimate power. lam satisfied that under responsible
government, and in justice to all the colonies, you
must do that. Ton cannot allow a small section to
govern the majority on a question of finance; you
cannot give 250,000 persons the power to tax 2,500,000
against their wall. Surely that sort of thing is not
intended. This is all I contend for. Ido not want
to take up more of the time of the Convention than
I have already done. I think I have trespassed too
much on the time. lam very well pleased to take
your advice, Mr. President. While 1, as strongly as
I can, give expression to my views, I think that we
are here for the purpose of giving and taking. I
think we are here for the purpose of stating our
views as strongly as we like, but finally to take into
consideration which view's ought to prevail; and lam
willing to do all I can to enable us to form a govern-
ment which will be a credit to us all, which will be
sufficiently strong to do its own work, and sufficiently
effective to see that its laws are carried out, but in
no way to interfere with the colonies as far as their
business is concerned. I am quite sure that when
we gome to thrash the matter out that will be the
view of nearly all the delegates, and, in fact, of all
the colonies. If we are to federate at all we must
federate on a basis that as near as possible will be
just to the whole of the colonies, and, at the same
time sufficiently effective to enable the executive to
carry on its work in a proper manner.
Mr. PLAYPORD: I think that in the discussion
of this question the example that has been set us by
the various speakers is very good in its commendable
brevity, because I look upon these resolutions as
simply the groundwork upon which we are to proceed
to build the bill. The great work of the Convention
will undoubtedly take place in Committee, when we are
discussing the provisions that should be contained in
the bill. I look upon these resolutions in the same
light as you, Mr. President, do, namely, as the founda-
tion to build a bill upon, and I think that now we
should not go into matters of detail at all, but confine
ourselves to the more important principles that are
laid down in the resolutions before us. The resolu-
tions naturally divide themselves into two parts.
Upon the first part, with regard to the powers that
should be given to the federal government that we
propose to create, there appears to be very little dis-
cussion, and the expression of opinion is practically
in favour of the propositious laid down. The first
proposition laid dow r n is that we should not take
from the various colonies any more power than is
absolutely necessary to give to the federal government,
so that the federal government may have power to
carry on its functions properly. I pointed out at the
Melbourne Conference that that appeared to me to be
the principle on w'hich we should act, and a principle
which, if we affirm it, will to a considerable extent
do aw r ay with the jealousy likely to be created as
between the various governments and the federal
government that we are endeavouring to build up.
I am glad that that provision is included in the Presi-
dent’s proposals. With regard to the 2nd resolution:
That the trade and intercourse between the federated
colonies, whether by means of land carriage or coastal
navigation, shall be absolutely free —
it appears to me that the last speaker, Mr. Munro, of
Victoria, has fallen into an error in supposing that,
because this resolution with regard to free intercourse
is here, it would mean that free intercourse between
the various colonies should take place before the
federal parliament had time to pass a tariff bill fixing
the tariff for all the colonies.


Mr. Munro : I do not think so; but others thought
so!
Mr. PLAYFOED : We do not intend to do any-
thing of the sort. It stands to reason that until the
federal parliament has had time to draft a bill, and
that bill has become law, we shall have to continue
with our own tariffs, and when that bill is passed
into law a day will be fixed on which the tariff will
come into operation, and all the other tariffs of the
various Australian colonies will cease. In alluding
to this question just now, Mr. Munro suggested some
amendment. I did not take it down at the time,
but I think that the hon. member was under the
impression that the federal government would be able
to give back to the various local governments prac-
tically the whole of the customs revenue they would
raise.
Mr. Mukeo : No !
Mr. PLAYFOED : And that it would be given
back to the various local governments in proportion
to the population of their respective colonies. If we
consider for a moment that the federal government
must have an executive, and will have to provide the
necessary payment for the federal forces, for the
federal executive, and for various other matters, we
must see that they will have to derive a revenue in some
way or other ; and the most difficult question, I think,
which the members of the Convention will find, when
they come to deal with it, will be the adjustment of
that financial part of, if I may so call it, the trouble
between the federal government on the one hand, and
the local governments on the other. It may be
necessary that, in certain instances, we should be paid
back by the federal government a proportion of the
money that we, as local governments, derive from cus-
toms, The great trouble you will have, after all, will be,
as in the case of Canada, in connection with the adjust-
ment of finances. In Canada they had a national debt
which, compared with ours, was very small —I think it
amounted to only about £10,000,000 or £12,000,000,
as against our £150,000,000. Like us, however,
they had local governments, which had raised money
to an extent considerably more than that to which it
had been raised by their neighbours per head of the
population. We have local governments which have
borrowed money to the extent of about £6O per head
of the population, and others again who have not
borrowed to the extent of more than £2O per head,
While they must give up a certain proportion of their
customs duties to the general parliament, there must
be some adjustment by which all the colonies will be.
placed upon a fair footing, and whereby the federal
government will take and pay back to the colonies
some portion of the customs revenue; but the
amount must be in proportion to the amount of the
debt the federal government takes over for each
individual colony. It will be a difficult question to
solve ; but it is one that will have to be solved. The
way in which it was solved in Canada is well known
to members of the Convention. I think it was the
province of Quebec which had borrowed more than
had any of the other provinces, and the federal
government said, “We will take over your debt, but
we will not pay you anything out of the customs
revenue ” Other colonies which had borrowed less
received, and continue to receive, a certain subsidy
from the federal government, in proportion to their
debt, the dominion parliament taking their debts
upon its own shoulders.
Mr. Dibbs : Does the hon. gentleman contemplate
the federal government taking over any portion of
the public debt ?
Mr. PLAYFOED : Undoubtedly. I say that if
the federal government take over the defences they
must take over the debts.,
Mr. Ftsh : For defence purposes !
Mr. PLAYFOED: Exactly. We, in South
Australia, have built a war-ship, for which we have
paid put of loan, and we shall expect the federal
government to take it over. Then there are certain
forts which we have erected partly out of loan, and
partly out of the general revenue. We shall expect
the federal government to take over those forts, and
to pay us for them, and to take over the debt in con-
nection with them. There are other questions of a
similar kind which suggest themselves naturally, and
which will have to be similarly dealt with. Take the
post-offices. If we agree that the post-offices should
be under the federal government, that government
must of course take over the debts in connection with
them. Then there are the telegraphs. I presume
the federal government will take over the debt in-
curred by South Australia in that very excellent work
of hers which has benefited the whole of the colonies —
I refer to the overland telegraph to Port Darwin.
The members of the Convention will see that with
regard to these questions of the taking over of the
customs revenue and the adjustment of finances,
they have a great work in front of them, and will, to
my mind, have a very difficult question to solve ; but
that the federal government will not be able to give
back to the colonies the whole of the customs revenue
derived may be taken for granted. They may be able
to give back a part; but a part is all they will be able
to give. With reference to the next portion of the
resolutions, referring to the naval and military defence
of the colonies, I think very little objection can be
taken to it. We are all agreed, I think, to defence
forming a portion of the powers of the federal parlia-
ment. I now come to a very important part of the
resolutions, which will, I think, create a great amount
of discussion —1 refer to the machinery by which we
shall give effect to them—that is, by which we shall
confer these powers upon the federal body. The
resolution says:
A parliament, to consist of a senate and a house of repre-
sentatives, the former consisting of an equal number of
members from each province, to be elected by a system
which shall provide for the retirement of one-third of
the members every years,
I think it will be better to provide for the retirement
of more than a third. It will be better, perhaps, to
adopt the American system, and to say, instead of
one-third, that one-half should retire every three
years, making the period for which the representatives
are elected six years, one-half going out every three
years. That, however, is a matter of detail.
so securing to the body itself a perpetual existence
combined with definite responsibility to the electors,
the latter to be elected by districts formed on a popu-
lation basis, and to possess the sole power of originating
and amending all bills appropriating revenue or im-
posing taxation.
Now, this form of government which is proposed by
the President is the form generally in vogue through-
out the various Australian colonies.
Sir Samuel G-rieeith : No !
Mr. PLAYFOED; In practice, it undoubtedly is
so.
Sir Samuel Griffith: Not so far as the senate
is concerned!
Mr. PLAYFOED : There can be no doubt that in
practice it is. We know that some of the legislative
assemblies in the various colonies have greater power
than have others ; but the general practice is that the
houses of assembly—the people’s houses in the vari-
ous colonies—universally object to the legislative
councils of the different colonies amending their
money bills. There is no doubt about that; audit
is therefore stated in so many words in these reso-
lutions what are the powers of the popular branch of
the legislature in regard to money bills, so as to make
the point quite clear. Unfortunately, the framers of
our Constitution did not make it clear, and the result
was that the two houses had no sooner set to work
than a deadlock commenced between them. It is
only by a compromise or compact entered into by the
two houses, by means of which the Legislative


Council was allowed to make suggestions to the
Legislative Assembly with regard to money bills—it
is only by means of this understanding that we have
been able to carry on legislation at all. In its absence
we 'should have had an unmistakable deadlock, and
we should have had eventually to appeal to the home
Government to pass a bill to enable the machinery of
government in the colony to work more smoothly.
We may take this provision for granted if we are to
have responsible government. The resolutions after-
wards go on to provide for an executive, for a
governor-general, and for the appointment of his
advisers :
such persons sitting in Parliament, and whose term of
office shall depend upon their possessing the confidence
of the house of representatives expressed by the support
of the majority.
That, at all events, carries out the same principle as
is in force in the various colonies now, and unless you
depart from that principle you arc in this fix as to the
senate, that you are about to give the senate powers
co-equal with those of the house of representatives
with regard to the amendment of money bills, thus
creating a state of things which must result in an
unmistakable deadlock.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Why ?
Mr, PLAYFOED: I represent a colony whose
interest it would be to magnify the senate as against
the house of representatives, because, in proportion
to its population, it would be more largely repre-
sented in the senate than in the house of representa-
tives, which, I imagine, will be elected upon a
population basis. I say this: That unless we alter
our system, and unless we adopt the American or the
Swiss system, and provide that the senate and house
of representatives at certain times shall meet and
shall appoint their own executive —which will not bo
in the sense in which we use the words, “responsible
government” —unless you do this, the scheme is im-
practicable. So far as the senate is concerned,
while we give it all the necessary power to veto, to
absolutely stop any legislation it believes to be in-
jurious to the community as a whole, even against
the will and wishes of the lower house, we must at
the same time provide that so far as money bills are
concerned one house must rule, must have not only
the sole power of initiation, but must be able to say
to the other house “You may make suggestions, but
we cannot concede you the right of amendment.”
I should like the members of the Convention to con-
sider these two questions. Take the first one —a
question that must occupy the attention of the new
federal parliament directly it is called into being,
at the outset of its career—the question of tariff.
Fancy for a moment the ministry of the day, whoever
they may be, responsible only to the lower house
having to pass a tariff line by line through the two
houses. It would be practically impossible to do so.
The Parliament would never be able to come to a
decision upon any important question such as that
of tariff if that were the case, owing to the multiplicity
of details which would be taken into consideration by
the two houses. I have had some experience in
passing a tariff through a legislative assembly. I
am informed that when the measure I passed was in
Committee I rose no less than 400 times to explain
various matters. I know what it is to pass a tariff
through one house, and I say that if the govern-
ment of the day had to pass a tariff through the
senate, as well as through the house of represen-
tatives, and were to have every line discussed by
the two houses, having to please two bodies of
men —two houses—the result would be that your
machinery of government would not work. The
friction would often be very great; and in many
instances the Parliament would experience great
difficulty in arriving at any decision whatever. Then
there is another question with which the two houses
will have to deal at the outset of their career, and in
connection with which, if you give them co-ordinate
powers and jurisdiction, you will have a deadlock
occurring, or lam very much mistaken. I refer to
the estimates. They will come before the federal
parliament annually, and I presume that the ordinary
estimates for the year will have to be passed by the
two houses. Do you propose to give to the senate
the right to enter into every little detail P Do you
propose to give to the senate the right to veto —as
was pointed out by Sir Samuel Griffith —every line ?
"Will you give them the right to say whether a post-
office shall be built here or a court-house there ?If
you once do that, you will get into a state of con-
fusion which will render the working of your consti-
tution almost impossible. It could not be done upon
such lines.
Sir Samuel Griffith: We have 100 years of
example to show the contrary !
Mr. PLAYUOED : No; we have not 100 years of
example to show the contrary. We have no such
example in America, to which country the hon. gen-
tleman, I presume, refers. Have you had there 100
years of example to show the working of responsible
government in connection with the house of repre-
sentatives, which is, after all, in America the lower
house in more senses of the word than one ? The
lower houses in our parliaments are more powerful
than are the upper houses. Does any one here
intend to make the senate more powerful than the
house of representatives P
Sir Samuel Griffith : I did not propose to do so!
Mr. PLAYFOED : That will depend upon the
power you give it. If, as the Americans do, you give
the executive power to your senate, if you give it the
right, as it has in America, to amend money bills in
whatever direction it pleases, and limit its power only
so far as the initiation of those bills is concerned, no
doubt it will become a body similar to the senate of
the United States of to-day. But under a system of
responsible government you cannot do that. You
cannot graft responsible government on to the
American system —a congress, as it is called, con-
sisting of a senate and lower house—and make it
work, because, directly you graft on to it responsible
government, you take away at one stroke some of the
powers the senate possesses. For instance, you could
not allow the senate to say that the ministry of the
day should not appoint such and such a person
ambassador to Pekin, or such and such a person
ambassador to London. You cannot carry on respon-
sible government and give to the senate the powers
which it possesses in America at the present time.
You cannot give the senate such powers and have at the
same time a responsible executive. I think that in
drawing up the details of any measure we may adopt,
we ought to do all we can to prevent the larger
colonies—those having a preponderance of popula-
tion—being placed in a position in which they can
ride roughshod over the smaller ones, I believe the
larger colonies do not wish it, and we must provide
some means of strengthening the senate and prevent-
ing the house of representatives from riding roughshod
over it other than by giving to it power to amend
money bills. One of the great powers the house of
representatives would have, if the senate had no
power to amend money bills, would be to tack on to
such a bill some measure which they knew to be
objectionable to the senate, but which they might think
the senate would not throw out lest they might injure
some other provision which they desired to see the law
of the land. We ought to so frame our Constitution
that this power attempted to be exercised, and occa-
sionally exercised by the lower houses in the colonies,
could not be exercised by the house of representatives.
We should provide, I think, that as regards the
Appropriation Bill, or a Tariff Bill, each question
must be forwarded to the senate separately, thus
preventing the house of representatives from tacking
on to, say, an Appropriation Bill a proposal for the


expenditure of money in some direction apart from
the ordinary expenditure of the year, and of which
the senate were known to disapprove. With regard
to loans for public works, we might provide that
every work in respect of which it was proposed to
borrow money should be contained in a separate bill.
By that means we should empower the senate to
reject a certain measure involving a heavy, and in
their opinion, an unjustifiable expenditure without at
the same time throwing out other useful and re-
quisite public works which they desired to see passed.
Mr. Dibbs : Would that apply to a tariil ?
Mr' PLAYFOED : No; that would involve too
much detail. It would be impossible for the two
houses to consider a tariff line by line. Of course, it
would be open to them to deal with the principles of
a tariff. If the senate, for instance, objected to the
principle of a tariff, they could throw out the Bill.
That is the position they ought to take up in such a
matter. If they were to insist upon going into
every little detail the result would be an unwork-
able" constitution. To the question raised by my
bon. friend, Mr. Munro, with reference to the pro-
tection of manufactures, I have already referred.
There are several other phases of the question, at
which I might just glance for a moment. There
is the power of veto wdiich it is proposed should
bo exercised, I suppose, by the Queen. It is an
exceedingly important power, and it seems to me that
we should do all we can to prevent its exercise—that
is to say, we should do away with it as far as we
possibly can. With regard to this pow r er, I think that
when the people of the colonies have spoken out
and have said unmistakably that they want a certain
law passed, and that when a law so demanded has
been passed in a perfectly constitutional way, the
power of veto, as now exercised by the Queen, should
be abrogated. I think there should be no power of
veto whatever. It has not been exercised of late
years to any great extent in Canada, and it has been
exercised to a very limited extent in these colonies,
and it is about time, I think, that it was done away
with altogether. If we cannot agree that it should
entirely cease at once, we might agree to something
like this : that on the passing of any important
measure as to the wisdom of which the minds of the
people of the colony are very much exercised, or to
which a large number are opposed, it might be
referred to the various constituencies by referendum,
and if the constituencies decided by a majority in
favour of the measure so passed, it might then
law, and should not, under any circumstances, be
subject to the veto of the Imperial Government.
Mr. Dibbs : That will be another strand of the
rope gone!
Mr. PLAYFOED : I do not know that any strand
will be gone. With regard to the question of the
executive, I understood Sir Samuel Griffith to say
that he thought it might be well to have an executive
that would not be responsible to Parliament.
Sir Samuel Griffith : I said that the constitution
might ultimately tend to work in that direction. I
prefer the present system.
Mr. PLAYFOED: But there is this danger: I
can sec that we ought to make provision to meet in
common fairness the smaller Australian colonies.
Two colonies—say, Victoria and New South Wales —
might join themselves together, and might have a
majority in the house of representatives, which would,
of course, keep the ministry of the day in power; the
whole of the ministry might be taken from the repre-
sentatives of New South Wales and Victoria, and the
rest of the colonies have no representation whatever.
Mr, Gillies: Sir John Macdonald was too wise to
do that sort of thing, and we may follow his example.
No wise government would do that.
Mr. PLAYFOED : We might have an unwise
government with a majority at their back, and who
might do anything. If the two larger colonies were
to join together, they could undoubtedly do that, and
as long as they kept a majority, they could keep on
doing it. It would be a mistake. It may not be done
in the first instance —I do not suppose it would be
done; but in drafting a constitution we should take
up this point for the protection of the other colonies :
that they should have some representatives, at all
events, in whatever government is formed, and that
the government of the country shall not be formed
out of one state alone.
Mr. Adye Douglas : How kind you are!
Mr. PLAY FORD : I am considering Tasmania,
as well as South Australia —not one colony alone. I
say it is a question that we ought to consider. We
ought to make provision, so that two colonies like
Victoria and New South Wales, which would have their
representatives elected wholly on the basis of popula-
tion, should not monopolise the representation. We
ought to consider whether it is not well to say that, at
all events, the executive should be distributed some-
what among all the colonies of the group. Ido not
know that there is any other point that I wish to bring
before the delegates at present. All I wish to say is
that, although 1 have my own views as to what will bo
the best constitution to frame, I am here willing and
prepared to give way in the matter to the will of the
majority; because, unless we are prepared to give
way to the will of the majority, we shall do nothing.
I think, taking them as a whole, that the resolutions
lay the foundation of what will be, if carried into
effect by an act, a useful form of government, and
the best that we can adopt. At the present time, I
think it would be a mistake to go away from the old
responsible government under which we have been
brought up, and attempt to establish a new form of
government without responsibility to Parliament, and
of which we have no knowledge. I think, therefore,
that we can pass the resolutions, and I understand
the moving of them means that we shall go into
Committee of the Whole, and well consider them
clause by clause. I will, therefore, not take up the
time of members of the Convention any further;
but say that I trust they will approach this subject
on the give-and-take principle which we should
approach it, and not allow our own individual views
and opinions to lead us into saying that, if we cannot
carry all we want in a matter of this sort, we will do
nothing.
Sir THOMAS McILWEAITH : I should like to
have heard the representatives from all the colonies
address the Convention before I rose, being myself
in a secondary position at the present time ; but, as
Sir Harry Atkinson has assured me that the New
Zealand delegates do not intend to speak at the
present stage, I have taken the floor. I was very
much pleased with the speech in which you,
Mr. President, introduced the resolutions—a good
deal better pleased with the speech than with some
of the resolutions themselves. The first is :
That the powers and privileges and territorial rights of the
several existing colonies shall remain intact except in
respect to such surrenders as may be agreed upon as
necessary and incidental to the power and authority of
the national federal government.
That is the germ and foundation of federal govern-
ment, and if carried and believed in conscientiously
by the delegates, I believe it would be a foundation
on which we could form a federal government. I
look upon it as the cream of the resolutions put
before the House. The other two in inverted order
bring in a very large question:
That the power and authority to impose customs duties
shall be exclusively lodged in the federal government
and parliament, subject to such disposal of the revenues
thence derived as shall be agreed upon.
And then following that:
That the trade and intercourse between the federated
colonies, whether by means of land carriage or coastal
navigation, shall be absolutely free.


These introduce a very large question, and although
the debate up to the present time has been more con-
fined to the difficulty of framing a constitution that
will work and to the details of that constitution, I
think if those two resolutions are carried they will
form the foundation of a federation, whether the whole
of the colonies come in or not; that is, if two such
colonies as Victoria and New South Wales were to
agree to terms like these, they would form the
nucleus of a federation into which the other colonies
in the future would be bound to come. I look upon
the commercial aspect of the matter as of much
greater importance than the legal aspect which has
been taken by so many members. I have no doubt that
when we get to business it is our position as colonists
and as traders which will really influence the whole of
the votes of the delegates. We cannot hide that from
ourselves, because we are bound to consider the
interests of the colonies that we represent as well as
the interests of the federation. There is no question
in my mind that the two resolutions which I have read
imply free-trade between the federated colonies, and
protection against the world. There is no doubt in
my mind that that is implied, because in the present
position the protectionists will of course vote for it;
at all events, the protectionists of Victoria and New
South Wales will vote for it, and the free-traders
will require to vote for it too if they desire federa-
tion, because it is the only means by which they can
get the revenue. Unless they did, the effect of the
first law passed would be to dislocate the revenue
branch of the governments of the separate colonies.
Take the case of Queensland, which 1 represent here.
They cannot say to that colony all at once, "We
intend to have free-trade, and the money previously
got by your government through the customs, you
must get from another source." That would burst up
the confederation before it was fairly started. We
must proceed on the supposition that there will be
free-trade among the colonies, and protection against
the world. I believe the opinion of the colonies in
general is that this would be a good national Aus-
tralian policy, and one in which I thoroughly believe.
At the same time, those who have, I will not say
benefited by protection, but whose interests have been
nourished under protection, must look with a great
deal of consideration and sympathy towards colonies
which have never tried it. At the immediate start,
the result is plain. Who will get the trade r Those
who already have protection. If a general tariff is
adopted by all the colonies, it will enlarge the area
of trade for the manufacturers who have already
obtained protection. The fact that they have been
engaged in the industries so long will make competi-
tion more difficult. In considering this question,
therefore, we must consider the weak colonies that
have industries started. This question will come
up in Committee, and we shall have to give a
great deal of consideration to those colonies which
are going to lose at once, so far as that branch of
the subject is concerned. Victoria is protectionist,
and many think that the people of New South Wales
are protectionist too. 1 believe that, if they were
looking after their own interests, they would be pro-
tectionists, because I do not know a country in the
world better adapted for manufactures than this
colony. You have a magnificent climate, land,
minerals, splendid material for textile manufactures
to your hand. These are now being exported, and
great advance in manufactures has been
made in the neighbouring colonies. If there were no
other gain to Australia as the result of federation
than the increased production which would follow
from the adoption of protection against the world, it
would be sufficient. Take the manufacture of wool
alone. Why is it that we see only a few small places
for manufacturing tweeds at Geelong, Ipswich, and a
few other places ?
Mr. GILLIES ; Labour!
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH: Labour will come
where the coal is accessible, where there is cheap
land and food, and nowhere can these things be
obtained more advantageously than in Hew South
Wales.
An Hojt. Membeh: What about Queensland ?
Sir THOMAS McIL WRAITH: Excepting Queens-
land, of course. I happened to be speaking for the
moment of New South Wales, but the same may be
said for the other colonies. We must, therefore,
recognise the fact that this is going to be a big pro-
tectionist colony. I shall say nothing with regard to
the 4th resolution, which affirms that the military
and naval defence of Australia should be entrusted
to federal forces under one command. That follows
as a matter of course, and the resolution might
have been omitted. The resolution ought simply to
affirm the principles on which the bill should be
founded. But when we come to the other conditions,
which, though not ranked as such, really are the con-
ditions upon which we are asked to form a federal
government, I altogether disagree with the proposal
which you, sir, have placed before the Convention.
What do we say in order to procure federation ?
What do we say to the Australian colonies? We
say to the smaller states, “ Federate.” When they
ask in reply, “ What is federation ? ” we tell them
of all its advantages. But we are immediately
asked this one thing, “ Well, we have the power of
making all the laws within ourselves, and of making
them without consulting you ; why should we come
under federation and consult you about our laws at
all ? ” That is the answer given by the small states
to the big states that want to swallow them up, as it
were. What is the reply when the small states say,
“Wo cannot lose our nationality; we are a unit now,
and we must preserve our nationality in any kind of
federation that may take place ?” They are answered
at once, “ Yery well, we will allow you to be a unit
and will create two houses of legislature, one of
which shall be a senate in which each colony as it
stands now shall be represented; no matter what its
length and breadth and population may be, it shall
have the same voice and the same influence in that
senate as is enjoyed by the other chamber.” That is
a substantial quid pro quo; that is something given
on each side ; that is business. But what does this
resolution propose ? As soon as we have given up
our rights to the federal authority we are asked to
withdraw the right that has been given to be
allowed to be considered a unit in the legis-
lature. We are to give back that gift that the
federation has given in consideration for some-
thing else, and to take something else; because
we are asked in the most important question that
can possibly come before the legislature that this
state representation in the federal council shall be a
great deal less than was bargained for—it is to be
less than one unit. The gentlemen who have spoken
on this subject, with the exception of the hon.
member, Sir Samuel Griffith—even you yourself, sir,
though you did not say much about it—took it for
granted that the senate proposed in the resolutions
would bo something like the Upper House, which forms
a chamber in the different legislatures of the colonies.
But where is the resemblance between the two bodies ?
Why is there a distinction drawn between the powers
of the members of the upper house and those of the
members of the lower house ? It is only for one
reason. When the constitution originally came to
us from England, this distinction did not exist. The
two houses were given equal powers. But when it
came to be seen that one chamber was elected to
represent the whole of the people—though it does
not really do that, for it does not represent the
women —but at all events, when it came to bo
recognised as the chamber that was supposed to
represent the people, and that the other chamber
represented only a section of the people, namely,


those who had property, it naturally came about that
this popular chamber said to the upper house, “ In
money matters wo will not give you the same power
that we possess.” It seems to be assumed by mem-
bers of the Convention who have spoken that it is
quite impossible in the very nature of things that a
money bill can be settled by two houses that there is
sure to be a deadlock. But the deadlock docs not arise
because two chambers deal with a money bill, because
the two chambers, haying equal powers in respect to
those subjects, deal with a great many other questions
besides that of finance. It is only here that we are
to be curbed, and we are to be curbed here when no
reason for doing so exists; because I have pointed
out that in the senate Queensland is to be repre-
sented by the same number of members as New
South Wales, although its population is only one-
half of that of the mother colony. They may say
that is unfair, but it is part of the bargain. Why
are the terms of that bargain to be made unfair to
the smaller colonies ? Why is the power of those
smaller colonies to be restrained? Those hon.
gentlemen who have spoken have assumed —which is
not the fact —that in the legislature shadowed forth
in these resolutions the senate is to represent
property.
Hon. Members: No!
Sir THOMAS McIL WRAITH : It is only on that
assumption, and on no other, that their arguments
can be based —that the house of representatives will
represent the people, and that the senate will repre-
sent the monied class.
Mr. PIiATEORT) : No !
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH: That is the only
ground on which their arguments can be based. In
the disputes that have taken place between the two
chambers in all the different colonies, that has been
the only reason that has been given. It cannot be
assumed that there being two chambers, there are
sure to be deadlocks, because the same reason would
apply to deadlocks arising on fifty other occasions.
The contention has simply been that the people who
find the money should have the sole right of saying
how it shall be spent. Now, why should we assume
that the senate will not represent the people of
Australasia ? I hold that it will represent the
people in every possible way. How do I know
that the first men who are elected for Queensland —
the colony that I, as one, am here to represent—
will not be elected by the plebiscite ? There cannot
be a more thorough representation of the people, so
far as numbers go, than by that system, which is one
of pure democracy. There are no conditions stated
on which the colonies shall elect their members, and
the senate may, and no doubt will, represent the
people quite as much as will the representatives
chosen by the people in any other way. A good
many reasons can, of course, be given why this part
of the resolutions, affirming that the sole power of
originating and amending all bills appropriating
revenue and imposing taxation, should be given to
the one house alone. I have given my views on the
subject as a non-legal man. My hon. friend, Sir
Samuel Griffith, explained the matter thoroughly to
all legal minds, and I have not heard a single word
in answer to his speech. I have heard it evaded, but
I certainly have not heard one word in answer to it.
I here is one matter, and it is of far greater import-
ance even than that aspect of the question, that has
n °k been touched upon at all, and it concerns the
position of Queensland at the present time. I think
it is a very important matter where state -rights are
to be represented, and to be represented by one
chamber in the new federal legislature, that provision
snould be made, or at all events that an indication
should be given as to how provision shall be made,
tor the admission into the union of other provinces,
and for the subdivision of colonies now existing.
IS ot a word has been said as to that up to the present
time. In Queensland we are on the eve of dividing
the colony, if we can, into three parts. We shall
require some guarantee that Queensland is going to
be recognised as three provinces in this new federal
government, and at all events, unless the thing is
to come to a deadlock, we must provide some method
by which the subdivision of a colony shall be made,
when demanded by the people and approved by the
legislature. No provision has been made for that;
yet it is a question that will arise before a federal
government can possibly be established. The ques-
tion, I say, is bound to arise, and is in fact to the
front now. I will not take up the time of the Con-
vention any longer, because 1 am glad to see that the
rule of the day is to make short speeches, and to
speak to the point; and I adopt that rule the more
cordially because I consider that the passing of these
resolutions is a mere formal matter, and that they
will be thrashed out thoroughly by the Committee in
detail.
Captain RUSSELL: I see that the order-paper is
headed the “National Australasian Convention,”
and, therefore, being a member of the Australasian
group, I may say that so far, in listening to the
debate, it has struck me, to use a quotation from the
Bible, in which I am afraid I may not be absolutely
correct, that “ Whilst ye worship me with your
mouths, your hearts are far from me.” I have been
listening, as a representative of a remote part of
Australasia, for the true federal spirit. It has been
supposed that the federal spirit does not exist in New
Zealand. I venture to say, without hesitation, that
in any debate in New Zealand on the question of
federation, we should have heard more of Australasia
and less of Australia. It is a broad question that we
are here to deliberate upon, and as I am now only
filling a gap of five minutes, and have most distin-
guished colleagues to follow me, I am unable to enter
upon the different subjects at the length I should
wish; but the great question that we have before
us now is not the creation of one large colony on
the continent of Australia, but to endeavour so to
frame a constitution that all parts of Australasia
shall be able to attach themselves to it should
they now or hereafter think fit to do so. It is
perfectly true that New Zealand has decided to
send but three delegates to this Convention ; but I
would point out that, at the deliberations of the con-
ference last year, though nothing was affirmed on the
subject, it was held by all the speakers that in all
probability the voting at the Convention would take
place by colonies; and if that is the case, surely the
voice of three men expressed in one vote might in
itself be held to have as much effect as the voice of a
host, inasmuch as it would be the still small voice of
a strong feeling, and not the loud popular clamour
which so often means nothing at all. The great
question that Australasia has to consider at this
moment is whether Australasia will constitute herself
the mother state to which all the other peoples in the
neighbourhood shall attach themselves. Therearomany
questions of great importance which hinge on that,
and which have not been alluded to in this resolution,
and which could not have been alluded to by any of
the previous speakers. The great object of any
federal constitution, according to my mind, at any rate
—I speak for myself —the great desideratum should
be to so frame a constitution that the remoter portions
of Australasia should be able to join themselves on
to what we may term the mother colony, should they
think fit so to do. My hon. friend, Sir Samuel
Griffith, in speaking yesterday, dwelt much, and I
think very properly, upon the question of the senate.
It has been said that the people should have the entire
power, seeing that they represent the purse. That
is a truism. It has become, I think 1 may almost
say, a fetish throughout all British-speaking com-
munities, that the power in every question should
rest with the bare majority. That majority is often


very bare and very narrow ; and though, to the very
fullest extent I concede that the power must rest
with the people, it is a very open question whether
countries ought to be submitted to the cyclonic
effects of popular gusts of passion, unchecked by
any authority whatsoever, and I venture to affirm,
though it may seem paradoxical, that the senate
might possibly more truly represent the majority of
Australasia than might the people's representatives
in the house of assembly. In the first place, I would
say that it is absolutely essential if the weaker colonies
are to come into a federation that they shall have a
numerical majority for the time-being, because we are
not speaking now for an ancient people in a country
fairly populated, but we are speaking for large terri-
tories which yet have to be colonised, in which great
numbers of people will be settled on places which at
present are waste and uncultivated —and if we say
that the sole power shall rest in the hands of those
Avho chance at the moment to represent a majority
of the colonised portions of Australasia, how can we
expect that we shall have a true federal union ? How
can we imagine that the outlying districts will submit
themselves to what, I believe, may be the tyranny of
a chance majority? Let us give to the senate, then,
full power, seeing that in all probability it will repre-
sent numerically the majority of Australasia rather
than those who chance to be the people's delegates
for the moment in the house of representatives.
There are many points which have not been con-
sidered, and with which I will not bother the Con-
vention at the present time ; but I would ask them
to bear in mind that if we are to adopt the present
system of responsible government —and I may men-
tion incidentally that in New Zealand there is a very
strong section of public men who are beginning to
doubt the wisdom of responsible government, and I
appeal to the premiers of the neighbouring colonies
in this Convention as to whether they themselves
do not admit that they are very many drawbacks
and defects in the system of responsible government;
that is to say, one of the principal questions which
affect the deliberations of representative institutions
throughout Australasia is who is to be premier and
who is to go out of office. Great public questions
are subordinated in nine cases out of ten to personal
popularity and the maintenance of a certain set of
people in office, and no hon. member here who has
sat long in a representative chamber can deny that
business of the greatest importance is perpetually
shelved, that stone-wall is set up periodically—l
might almost say perpetually —to endeavour to pre-
vent public opinion being given effect to, because it
chances that the large minority in the house have
some other views which they wish to put before the
country; that, in other words, we have failed during
recent years by representative government to get a
true expression of opinion from the people. I main-
tain that such is the case in almost every colony in
Australasia. I have watched it with some care and
with great pain. But if we give considerable power
to the senate I venture to say that that power will
to a very great extent diminish. It is not necessary
that I should now go into details as to what the
business of the senate may or may not be; but so
soon as Australasia develops into a nation, so soon
as it becomes a power having dealings with foreign
nations, I maintain that the system of turning out
governments upon some small question—l will not
say of public policy, but some very small question,
the continual shuffling of the cards, the ejectment of
men from office owing to no failure of duty on
their part, will become a very great inconvenience.
When we begin to have ambassadors, or something,
similar to ambassadors, negotiating with foreign
countries, when we have an agent-general re-
presenting us in England. I venture to say
that the ejectment of ministers from office con-
tinually and perpetually without any good reason at
all will interfere very materially indeed with what
I may term the foreign policy of Aiistralasia ; and,
therefore, we ought by some means or other to en-
deavour to put a check upon the system of the eject-
ment of ministers from office without reason, thereby
curtailing the benefits which they could confer on the
united colonies, and also interfering materially with
the foreign policy of Australasia. The reason why
I think we should have a system of federation as loose
as possible is this: that all the more outlaying por-
tions of Australasia must be allowed to work out
their own destinies. When you think that we, in
our own colony, have what may be termed a foreign
policy, inasmuch as we deal with an alien race, that
we have laws very materially affecting them, that the
questions of native title are matters of very grave
moment, and that any interruption in our relations
with those people might be of the most serious im-
portance to the colony, I think you will agree with
me that we shall require to see that wo have a safe-
guard in all such respects as these before wo submit
ourselves to a federal authority. And so, in the
colonies of northern Australia, you yourselves may
yet find that you have difficulties unforeseen to cope
with. It is true that the native races of the more
settled portions of Australia have given you but
little trouble, and you have dealt with them sum-
marily, but possibly when you go to northern
Australia you will find there a race more resolute
and more difficult to deal with.
Mr. Platford : ISTo !
Captain RUSSELL: Of course I must bow to the
wisdom and experience of those who have already
had to deal with them; but be that as it may, if New
Guinea is ever to become a part of Australasian
federation, there, at any rate, is a people that will
require to be dealt with most carefully. Yet I have
heard no member of the Convention speak on that
subject. There is nothing in these resolutions con-
templating the possibility that there will be a foreign
race to deal with. But consider this difficulty, which
I merely outline to you. The great and all-pervading
question that occupies men’s minds in all parts of the
world at the present moment —it is undoubtedly
doing so now in Australia, and it is a question more
advanced in my own colony than here —is the great
social question—what is termed the social upheaval,
and I venture to say that every colony must be left
to deal with a question like that. It is a matter for
social dealing. It is a matter with which men will
deal rather through municipalities than through a
great federation in advancing, what I believe it is
necessary we should advance, the true liberties and
freedom of the people. Therefore, what we want is
not the unification of Australasia, but a federation
into which all portions of Australasia may be drawn.
Bear this in mind: That in the plenitude of your
power, feeling yourselves now the masters of the
whole Pacific, it should be your duty to attract, as it
were, by centripetal force, the whole of Australasia
to yourselves. The day is coming when the countless
islands throughout the Pacific will be colonised, and
though your power is great, and though you have an
enormous start in colonisation, there will be an
enormous power in those southern seas that must be
either part of Australasia, or more or less inimical
to our interests. There is another point of vieAV
which seems to have been overlooked; that is, if we
are to be the centre of a happy and prosperous power
in these seas we must have strong cohesion, because
really not far away from parts of Australasia lies
the great continent of America, and the question has
yet to be solved whether America may not attract
the majority of the trade, the majority of the power
and influence of the southern seas to her coast, and
divert them from Australia. It is, therefore, our
duty to consider how we can make the federation so
loose that we shall attract all these various atoms to
ourselves, rather than allow them to fly off to the


great continent of America, which, I venture to say,
is quite within the bounds of possibility, if Australasian
statesmen are not sufficiently wise to attract those
atoms to themselves. Although we do hesitate, of
course, in New Zealand, to submit ourselves to
federation, I should not like the world to think that
we are inimical to the idea at all. Though we may
be unwilling to submit ourselves to am diastic laws,
although we are unwilling to abrogate any of the
powers of government necessary foi oui internal
management, which we possess at the present time,
there are all sorts of laws to which we shall bo only
too happy to submit ourselves if we are able to do so.
It is a matter of great importance to us that we
should trade with Australia. In round numbers,
one-fifth of the trade of New Zealand is done with
the continent of Australia. It would be a great loss
to us to lose that trade ; but, great as the misfortune
would be to New Zealand, I venture to say that the
loss would be three times as great to Australia to
lose our trade.
Mr. Dibbs : No !
Captain EUSSELL ; That is so long and broad a
question that I will not go into it; but I venture to
say that there are other markets open to New
Zealand besides Australia; but Australia, whether
she likes it or not, must consume many of the pro-
ducts of New Zealand.
Mr. Playford : No.
Captain EUSSELL: Hon. members may say “No”;
but nevertheless I still hold my opinion. I venture to
say that a great portion of our vegetable products will
come into Australia; let Australia do whatever she
may to keep them out.
Mr. Dibbs : Only if you federate.
Captain EUSSELL : Surely the hon. member, Mr.
Dibbs, is not so narrow-minded as to believe that you
can bring anything about by coercion. Has he for-
gotten the fable of the east wind and the sun —how
the east wind howled and blew on the traveller; but
the more it howled and blew the closer he wrapped
his cloak about him ? Then the sun came out and
shone upon the traveller, and he threw off his cloak.
So I say that if you wish to attract New Zealand,
if you wish to attract Australasia to your shores, it
is not by taking any hostile steps that you will bring
it about, but by the genial sun of Australia shining
upon the whole of us.
Mr. Dibbs : There is a disposition to be embraced !
Captain EUSSELL; Yes, there is a disposition to
be embraced ; but w r e think it should not be a bear’s
hug. We are anxious that the trade and intercourse
between the federated colonies should be as free as
possible. We are anxious by every means to trade
with you. We recognise that our marriage laws
might fairly be assimilated. While we recognise that
certainly in the matter of land defence we can gain
nothing, yet with regard to maritime defence it is of
great importance that New Zealand should be com-
bined with Australia. I would also point out, as a
very important factor of the case which has not been
alluded to, that probably the great coaling stations of
the Pacific for marine purposes will be upon the west
coast of the Middle Island of New Zealand. It is,
therefore, a matter of great importance, and abso-
lutely essential to you, that the colony possessing
these great coal-mines should be in close relationship
with Australia; because in the remote future —
we are not acting for to-day, but are framing a
constitution which may, I hope, last for thousands
of years—if alien races spring up, it will be a matter
of great importance that the magnificent harbours
and great coal resources of New Zealand should be
one with and inseparable from the dominion of Aus-
tralia. So, again, with the matter of the judiciary.
I am not now prepared to give definitely my opinion
upon that subject; but, at any rate, I believe that I
shall be right in saying that we should be anxious to
do all we can to assimilate the laws on all important
points throughout Australasia, and no difficulty would
occur in agreeing to some such scheme as that. As
to the executive, I said in commencing my speech
that I thought it was, at any rate, a matter of debate
amongst a considerable section of the population of
New Zealand as to whether the present form of
responsible government is the best that could be
established. I confess that my mind is somewhat
nebulous on the point at present; but, undoubtedly,
one feels more and more, as time goes on, that there
are anomalies in our present form of government.
All these, I venture to say, are matters of no moment
at the present instant. All we have to do is to con-
sider how we can most broadly lay down the lines
upon which our federation shall be built. It ought
not to be built solely with a view to the circum-
stances existing at the present moment. Many
portions of the Australian continent which at present
would be practically unrepresented will, at some
future time, have a great say in the government of
the country ; and therefore the constitution ought to
be so framed that we should not take into considera-
tion only the great centres of population which exist
at the present time ; but we should also offer induce-
ments to all the outlying portions of Australasia to
come under the federation. If that is done, I ven-
ture to say the day will come when there will be a
truly federated Australasia, and not a union of
Australia only.
TELEGEAM EEOM THE QUEEN.
The President : Before the Convention adjourns
for luncheon, I desire to announce to hon. members
that I have received from his Excellency the Governor
a message from her Majesty the Queen. His Excellency
telegraphed to her Majesty the success of the Con-
vention banquet on Monday night and the opening
of the Convention, and he has received from her
most gracious Majesty the following reply: —
Have received your telegram with great satisfaction, and
am much pleased at the loyalty evinced on this important
occasion.
Victoria, Queen and Empress.
I am sure we will give three cheers for the Queen.
Hon . members gave three cheers for her Majesty the
Queen.
EEDEEAL CONSTITUTION.
SECOND DAY’S DEBATE RESUMED.
Mr. DEAKIN: Eortunately for the Convention,
I was not called upon to undertake the onerous task
of opening this debate last afternoon. Eortunately
for the Convention, again, a delay on my part led to
our listening to the charming speech of the hon.
delegate, Captain Eussell, and I could have wished
that other and older members had now been prepared
to continue a discussion so ably opened by the
premiers of the various colonies. Among these
gentlemen, the last speaker, although not at present
a premier, occupies a somewhat singular position,
representing a colony whose affections we are clearly
led to understand are with us, but whose judgment
is not yet convinced as to the wisdom of adopting
the course which it is proposed to pursue. The hon.
member, Captain Eussell, is so ardent a New
Zealander that in his reproaches, mild though they
were, of the sister colonies, there appeared to be a
certain desire to realise that Irish reciprocity which
is all on one side. He was careful to tell us that
we must not at the present time expect anything
from New Zealand; but he laid down with great
fullness and freedom the duties which we imme-
diately owed to that most beautiful, important, and
wealthy colony, whose position, he led us to under-
stand, was that of the coy maiden, not unwilling, and
indeed expecting, to be courted, and whose consent
would be granted by-and-by as a favour. It may be


that because they fell from a lady's lips, or from the
representative of a lady, as I may bo permitted at
present to regard him, that we may pass by certain
heresies about responsible and democratic govern-
ment which might otherwise seem to challenge a
rejoinder. At all events, if the hon. member will
permit me, I will only endeavour to deal with them
in connection with the remarks which have been
made with reference to the proposed constitution for
Australasia, The fact that the Premier of Queensland
has seen fit to throw the apple of discord at once
among us is, to my mind, extremely fortunate, and
if, as the hon. Premier of Victoria considered, ho
favoured us with a greater gift of difficulties than of
solutions, that, after all, was natural from the opener
of such a debate. The one solution which the hon.
member has proposed I intend shortly to examine as
well as I can, treating especially the particular side
of it which was so admirably put before the Conven-
tion by his colleague, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith. One
might be pardoned for dwelling upon this occasion,
and forecasting its possible future ; but our respon-
sibilities are so great as to sober the most sanguine,
as well as to arouse the most confident. I take it
that if this Convention is to leave its mark upon the
history of Australia, it will do so not by disquisi-
tion, but simply by the results which it wiil leave be-
hind it. We have been termed most properly and
accurately a parliamentary committee—and a parlia-
mentary committee we are; but such a committee as
has rarely been seen in any constitutional country,
and such as has never been seen in Australasia—a
Committee representing seven Parliaments, with the
concurrence of seven Governments, and the sanction
of fourteen Legislative Chambers, having the direct
approval of every existing voice of the people of Aus-
tralasia given through all its different political
organs, and, therefore, claiming an authority second
only to that of a chamber elected directly by them.
Ihe duty imposed upon us is simply that of advising,
and, therefore, the latitude permitted to us is, in
some respects, large; but, on the other hand, the
sphere within which we move is narrow, and must be
narrow. It is not possible that any question of
moment in this Convention can be settled by count
of heads, or even by count of colonies. Any con-
clusion arrived at, which is to bo of practical value,
must be a unanimous conclusion, and the smallest of
tlm colonies requires to have any considerations
which it may urge weighed with exactly the same
attention as those which proceed from the most
wealthy and the most populous. AYe are here, there-
fore, sir, committed from the first to a policy of com-
promise, to all compromise that will be possible to
us, seeking to be honest representatives of our
several parliaments and colonies, and indicating to
the best of our knowledge and belief the attitude
which they will take on each question. The principle
upon which we must proceed is that embodied iu the
well known church maxim, " In essentials, unity ; in
non-essentials, liberty; and in all things, charity."
If we claim an indirect authority from the electors
we are none the less conscious of the fact that what-
ever is proposed by this Convention must be of such a
nature as to meet with their sanction, or else it will be
proposed in vain. AYe know from the outset the bar
of public opinion before which we are to be judged,
and we know from the commencement of our labours
that the conclusion of them rests in other hands than
ours iu the hands of no less a body than the
assembled peoples of all the Australasian colonies.
This, sir, is sufficient in itself to make us careful in
our deliberations, and guarded in our conclusions,
especially if we take into account the further fact
that the verdict of the electors—whether taken
directly through the electorates, or not so taken, will
also require to be taken through all the present Par-
liaments of Australasia. AYe have to consider not
only the interests of the people regarding them as a
whole, but also the different and sometimes con-
flicting localisms which are created owing to the fact
that this people is at present bound up within arti-
ficial boundaries into a certain number of communi-
ties. If the constitution or proposal for a constitution
which is to be drafted in this Convention is to be a
success, it must command the sanction of the several
parliaments of those several communities. Then, as
to the objects which we set ourselves in preparing the
draft of a constitution, I fancy that we may without
impropriety, in fact, with entire propriety, adopt the
unequalled language employed in the preamble of
the superb Constitution of the United States, and
may, without qualifying a single syllable claim that
our labours are intended to achieve a similar result.
We shall be entitled to announce, after receiving the
popular verdict in its favour, that
we, the people of Australasia, in order to form a more
perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tran-
quility, provide for the common defence, promote the
general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to
ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish
this constitution.
The resolutions which have been proposed by
yourself in order to accomplish these objects con-
tain in what may he considered their preamble,
one phrase which has not yet been commented
upon, but which appears to me to deserve com-
ment, as indicating on its face the object which
you had, sir, in submitting these resolutions in their
present form. You say :
That in order to establish and secure an enduring founda-
tion for the structure of a federal government, the
principles embodied in the resolutions following bo
agreed to.
Thus at once indicating to us that these resolutions,
as they stand, are not laid before ns to be accepted
and criticised word by word, as if they were sought
to be placed on permanent record ; but that it is the
principles embodied in them which we are now called
upon to consider. That course appears to me to
have most wisely adopted ; and I shall there-
iore seek, in treating these resolutions in their order,
not to dwell upon the language in which they happen
to be couched, but endeavour, as far as possible, to
cope with the principles which they seem to embody.
The first of those establishes beyond doubt the
sovereignty proposed to be conserved tc the several
colonies of Australasia, subject to the limitations and
surrenders which will appear set out in detail in the
constitution proposed to be adopted for the federal
parliament. Subject to the express terms of that
constitution, every liberty at present enjoyed by the
peoples of the several colonies, and every power of
their legislatures, and every potentiality which is
within their constitutions, remains with the maud
belongs to them for all time. You lay this down at
the outset as a cardinal principle, and *as it has so far
received the cordial approval of every delegate, I
shall not proceed to debate it further than to note
that it was exactly this principle which guided the
founders of the existing Federal Council in their
draft of that measure—it puts into a fresh form with
regard to this federation the very root idea of the
present Federal Council Act. This is the postulate
that to the several colonies should he left all possible
powers and prerogatives, defined and undefined,
while the federal government itself, however largely
endowed, should have a certain fixed and definite
endowment within which its powers would be circum-
scribed. In the first resolution which you, sir, moved
at the conference held in Melbourne twelve months
ago, you most gracefully recognised the valuable
services to the cause of federation conferred by the
founders of the Federal Council, which, in Victoria,
stands indissolubly associated with the name of the
Honorable James Service, a gentleman whom we
regret, by his own choice, is not ono of the Victorian
delegates on this occasion. He, sir, and the other
great representative men, among whom the late liight


Honorable W. B. Dallcv, must always be gratefully
remembered, when facing a similar problem to be
dealt with in a somewhat limited way adopted this
principle. It is something to note that the years
that have passed since then, and the experience
gained since then, have only strengthened the opinion
which they arrived at, that no union was possible in
Australasia which did not preserve in the fullest
form the power and dignity of the several commu-
nities which compose it. Indeed, if we regard their
present extent, their present known wealth, and
their future prospects, we must admit that in the
future they will rival in all respects kingdoms in
Europe and states in America ; and that the parlia-
ments which belong to such communities cannot be
other than bodies clothed with the highest power,
dignity, and influence, to which it will bean honor to
belong, and which will play a great part in shaping
the destinies of this continent. Then, sir, we come
to your 2nd and 3rd resolutions, which I propose to
briefly consider together. It seems to me that they
might have been legitimately placed in an opposite
order that we should first have asserted the
power and authority of the federal government to
establish a common tariff, and that then we should
have had as a corollary the principle of free inter-
change between the several provinces of the union.
This, however, has been already dealt with. The
point which presented itself to the hon. member,
Sir Samuel Griffith, in this connection was the
probability of delay on the part of the federal
parliament in dealing with this most grave and
important issue. Indisputably the first task of the
federal parliament will be to organise itself and its
administration. Indisputably the task of framing a
common tariff for all Australasia will be no ordinary
task. The difficulties which have been felt, and
which have already been graphically pourtrayed by
the lion, the Premier of South Australia in his
admirable speech this morning—the difficulties which
have been felt in each province in coping with such
questions will be multiplied sixfold in dealing with
the interests of Australia. If we have found it
difficult for politicians to collect information to
enable them to deal with this intricate question,
when we have only had the interests of one colony
to consider, if it does not follow in exact arithmetical
ratio, it yet does follow most distinctly that there
will be much more difficulty in framing a tariff
acceptable to the people of the wTiole of Australia.
It is quite clear, then, that time must elapse before-
this common tariff can be proposed ; and those w T ho
have preceded me, including the Premier of Victoria —
with whom I am in hearty general agreement, so far
as his remarks touching some questions are con-
cerned —appear to consider that this time, of itself,
would offer sufficient grace to those colonies which
have already adopted the policy of developing
their manufacturing industries by special legislation.
With all respect to them, I take a contrary view. I
believe that it is not sufficient that an indefinite time
must necessarily elapse before the federal parliament
can deal with this issue. I believe that if we
are to obey the language of the resolutions which
sent us here—if we are to propose a constitution
which shall be just to the several colonies —
we cannot be content with leaving the question as
open as it is proposed to leave it. "What is the
position of those colonies which have advisedly, in
pursuance of the powers intrusted to them, and in
obedience to the dictates of their parliaments, adopted
a protective policy? They have created, within longer
or shorter periods, vested interests, in which millions
of capital are invested —millions of private capital of
the citizens of this country. Now, sir, I would be
the last to suggest, the last to believe, that a federal
parliament, representing Australasia, would ignore
considerations of this kind. I would be the last to
suppose that they could be guilty, in obedience to
any doctrine of economic practice, of what might be
termed the crime of sweeping away, at a blow, the
protection under which these industries and interests
have been built up. I believe that to be impossible.
But the question here and now is, not of individual
belief, or the belief of this Convention; it is our
duty, in a matter of this kind, not to rest upon
beliefs, but to obtain guarantees for the preservation
of interests such as these. AVhat are the guarantees
which can legitimately be asked by those colonies
which have established industries under the shelter
of protective tariffs ? What is the consideration
which they can reasonably ask from their fellow-
colonists, and especially from that one great colony
in which we now stand, which has not yet seen its
way to follow a similar policy. Let me say, at the
outset, that I, for one, frankly admit that a cus-
toms union is a sine qua non of federal union; that
without a customs union there can be no federal
union in the true sense of the term, and that all
our efforts and all our labours must be directed to
securing that customs union so soon as it may be
compatible with the interests intrusted to us. With
that premise, let us ask what might fairly be
demanded, seeing that ultimately, and at 110 distant
date, the question of the tariff to be imposed upon
our seaboard must be settled by the people of
Australia as a w hole, no matter what the verdict of
individual colonies may be. That is the goal towards
which we are progressing, and towards which w r o
ought not to progress too slowly, but which it would
be impossible, which it would be unjust, to attempt
to gain at a single bound. I will not venture at this
stage to suggest what, in my humble judgment,
would be a sufficient guarantee to satisfy those
colonies that their interests would not be too soon,
too rapidly, too hastily imperilled. I will only
indicate that it appears to me that we might safely
lay dowm in the constitution the condition that during
the first years of its existence it should only be
possible to reduce existing tariffs by a certain
percentage in a certain number of years ; so that if
the first federal parliament should feel bound to
reduce duties it could only do so to a certain extent.
The people of the continent, as a whole, would be
appealed to at least once, if not twice, before protec-
tive duties were reduced to revenue duties. In point
of fact, the federal parliament on this question should
be asked to proceed by steps, to advance by degrees ;
and the guarantee should be set out on the face of
the proposed constitution that those who have
embarked their capital in these industries under state
encouragement and state sanction, should know the
period of time within which they could hope to retain
the command of their markets, even if the federal
parliament should give its judgment against a protec-
tive policy. I need scarcely repeat here that, in my
opinion, the federal parliament is in no danger of
giving any such verdict. I believe that the portion of
the speech in which the hon. member, Sir Thomas
Mel 1 wraith, set out the conditions under which pro-
tection might be applied, expresses the opinion
of the bulk of the people of_ this country, and
that this is an opinion which, the better it
is understood, the more it will find popular favour.
Personally, then, I have no more fear than any
member of this convention, as to what the ulti-
mate result would be. It will mean without doubt
an Australasian protective tariff; but I say it is
incumbent upon us not to rest upon individual beliefs
in a matter of so much moment to special colonies ;
we must request and require some such guarantee as
that which I have rudely outlined. I would remind
hon. members who are apprehensive of such a pro-
posal that we all fondly hope and believe that the
union which it may be our privilege to inaugurate,
will be an eternal union—a union for all time of the
states of Australasia, or into which all the states of
Australasia will, within a comparatively brief period,


be irresistibly drawn. That being the case, why
should a concession of a few years be denied, when
the object to be attained is permanent ?
Mr. Abte Douglas : The hon. member has no
confidence in his own people !
Mr. DEAKIN : The hon. member must pardon
me if I do not now see the pertinency of his inter-
jection. I was about to point out that, supposing
this principle to be adopted, this guarantee to be
given, it does not necessarily imply that nothing
should be done in the way of free interchange between
the Australasian colonies in the meantime. On the
contrary, that would rest with the several colonies
themselves; and the sense that at no distant date
an absolute union was inevitable, would no doubt
prove an argument of considerable weight to
induce them to prepare for it by every means in
their power. Consequently, the condition which has
been suggested would not prove an absolute bar to
progress in this direction even during the term of the
guarantee ; but, on the contrary, it might be reason-
ably anticipated that, with such a guarantee, offered
and accepted, the several colonies who were for the
time-being protected by it would see their way to
enter into mutual arrangements for a more or less
unrestricted exchange across their borders; and,
saving the rights and the vested interests to which I
have referred, no one would more cordially support
such a policy than myself. With regard to the 4th
resolution, I have only to say that the promise which
it offers is one of efficiency in the defence of Austral-
asia, an efficiency which I trust will be based upon
as small a standing army as is compatible with the
safety of the country, and upon as large an exten-
sion of the principle of citizen soldiery as is possible
with the funds at our command. Then, sir, we
approach the article of your resolutions—the first in
the second part —which has, up to the present
moment, called for the most criticism, and evoked
the warmest debate. Your proposition that there
should be two houses of parliament has been, so far,
accepted with unanimity. Your proposition that the
house of representatives should be elected on the
popular basis has not been challenged. The pro-
position that there should be a senate retiring by
sections has also been adopted. The one article in
this particular resolution which has been challenged
is that which, in accordance with the established
principles of the British Constitution, endows the
popular chamber with the sole power of originating
and amending all bills, appropriating revenue, or
imposing taxation. Those, sir, who follow your
resolution, and adopt it most cordially, have been
accused of keeping in mind throughout the existing
upper chambers ol Australasia, of ignoring the dif-
ference between the second federal chamber and the
second chamber in the several colonies. But those
who have made this accusation have not themselves
been precise, nor could they be precise, in indicating
the particular mode of election which was proposed
to be adopted in order to obtain this senate. Some
have inferred, it is evident, that the local legislative
bodies would elect the members of the senate.
Others have vaguely indicated the possibility of an
election by the whole body of the people, or by pro-
vinces, and others have indicated a mixed method of
election. I wish merely to point out from the begin-
ning that, until the method of election is settled, the
question in what degree the upper chamber really
represents the state which it claims to represent
must remain in some doubt.
Sir Thomas Mcllwraith : No !
Mr. DEAKIN: It may nominally represent the
state, without really representing it. If, for in-
stance —and I do not think it would be an unwise
proposition —it is suggested that each colony shall
determine for itself the method of election which
shall be followed for the proportion of members
which it is entitled to claim in the senate—and that
would be a liberty which, until I hear reasons to the
contrary, I think might be judiciously intrusted to
the several colonies—if the several colonies be left
free to frame their own constituencies for their own
senate, then we shall, not impossibly, have a body
which will have differing claims to represent certain
states. I shall maintain from now, until I find the
principle refuted by much stronger argument than I
have heard brought against it, that there is only one
means of thoroughly and effectively representing
the people, and that is by direct election. No other
choice, however it may be based upon the indirect
authority of the people, can claim to stand for a
moment in comparison with that of men who receive
their trust from the hands of the electors themselves,
and who speak their sentiments, without the inter-
vention of any other body, or subject to any other
influence than the judgment and reason of the man-
hood of their colony. I say that, however high the
title, however lofty the claims, of the senate, if it
derives its origin from an indirect method of election,
the representative character of its members cannot
equal that of men who face the people directly, and
win, in their own person, at the sword’s point, and
after fierce conflict, the confidence of a majority of
the electors.
Sir Samuel Griffith: Why not ?
Mr. DEAKIN : I say I shall accept that as a first
principle until I hear stronger reasoning to the
contrary than I have yet heard ; and I shall adopt,
in tihs particular, the excellent plan of the hon. the
Premier of Queensland, who has interjected, and
whose politic practice, throughout the whole of the
debate, has been to request his opponents to find
plans and then proceed to criticise them. I think
that we who lay down a principle so generally
accepted as this, are entitled to ask to be furnished,
not with reasons for supporting it, but with reasons
why we should not support it, or why we should
accept some other principle in its place. Therefore,
with all consideration and respect, I return the hon.
gentleman’s interjection, and invite him to show what
method of appointment can claim, in directness of
authority, to rank with that of immediate election by
the whole body of the people.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Any kind of election !
Mr. DEAKIN: Any kind of election !
Sir Samuel Griffith: If it represents the state!
Mr. DEAKIN: I cannot conceive of an entity
called the state apart from the people whose interests
it embodies ; nor can I conceive anything within the
state which can claim an equal authority with the
final verdict, after solemn consideration, of the
majority of its citizens. If the hon. gentlemen has
any metaphysical entity in his mind which can be
placed above this, I shall be glad to learn its nature ;
but at present I prefer to rest upon what has been
the solid substratum upon which popular and respon-
sible government has been carried on, of which we
have had centuries of experience, and which, the
more it has been honored, the more it has endowed
us with liberty, and all that follows in the train of
liberty. Until we have the method of the election
of the senate distinctly before us we cannot tell
exactly with what degree of authority it should be
intrusted. But I will not quibble about words. I
will confess that, if elected, it is quite possible and
justifiable to intrust it with a very large authority.
I would assure the hon. member that, in endeavouring
to answer his contention, I shall seek to meet his
argument, so far as I understand it, not at its worst,
but at its best; to state it, as far as I can, as I
conceive he would state it in order to put it in its
strongest form ; and if I cannot answer it in that
form I will not attempt to answer it at all. I merely
pointed out at the outset—and perhaps the hon.
member’s interjection has led me to appear to attach
too much consideration to it—that this is a circum-
stance that will require to be taken into consideration,


which has not yet been taken into consideration, and
which those who advocate the intrusting of the
federal upper house with extraordinary powers have
not yet thought fit to absolutely define. I think
that we may fairly challenge them to define the
method of election for this senate of theirs, to which
they wish to give exceptional powers, lo remo\e
any misapprehension, let me say that personally I
have no ambition to see a second chamber in these
colonies which should be a mere replica of the Canadian
Upper House, which is confessedly inadequate for the
position which it occupies ; nor do I even desire to see
a body whose authority would be as capable of variable
interpretations as is that of the House of Lords
under the British Constitution. I believe that we
cannot have a better ideal for our second chamber
than the House of Lords as its functions are now
interpreted; at the same time I will confess to hon.
members that in defining its exact position we might
possibly have some difficulty. If we follow the lines
upon which I believe the British Constitution is now
interpreted, we should require a second chamber cm-
bracing just such members as you, sir, specified in
your opening speech, men of mature experience, of
ripe judgment, of high character, qualified to give
counsels to the nation with the certainty that they
would be received with respect. Of such men should
a second chamber be composed, and the powers
intrusted to it should be those powers that have
always belonged, under responsible government, to a
second chamber, namely, the power of review, the
power of revision, the power of a veto limited in time.
The hon. member, Captain Russell, described in poetic
language that I am afraid I would find almost as much
difficulty in repeating as I should in imitating, the
danger incurred in the absence of a veto. He spoke,
I fancy, of the " cyclonic fury" of the popular mind,
and conjured up before us the spectacle of a democracy
carried hither and thither by violent impulses to
opposite points of the compass within short periods of
time. If there be such a democracy —and far be it
from me to insinuate that Captain Russell has had any
experienceof it —then I fancy that the second chamber
which we have in view would prevent and provide against
any such possible accident. Tt would be a chamber
speaking with weight, and acting with authority, able to
amend or reject all measures other than financial —able
to absolutely reject financial measures, though not to
amend them, and able by this means to challenge the
verdict of the country whenever and however it pleased,
and as often as it might please. Will it be contended
that these are small powers? On the other hand,
will it be contended that if that "cyclonic fury"
proved not to be the momentary outburst to which
reference has been made, but the settled determina-
tion of] the popular will—does Captain Russell, and
do those who think with him, contend that this is to
be defeated ? On the contrary, he agrees in theory,
at all events, with the practice of the British Consti-
tution which we are supporting. So, I take it, did
Sir Samuel Griffith himself. He also indorsed the
principle that, in the last resort, and after due con-
sideration, the popular determination must prevail,
and the attempt of any body, short of that of a
majority of the people, to obstruct its execution must
be defeated and set aside. This, I understand them
to admit; we admit: all admit. It is simply a ques-
tion, then, of the degree of veto—of the degree of
check which a second chamber shall be authorised to
present to the execution of what the popular chamber
believes at the time to be the will of the people. If
we are agreed that the authority to be intrusted to
the senate is to be only a limited veto, then I ask
how that is to be reconciled with the propositions
which provide for a permanent and perpetual veto
capable of being imposed by the second chamber
upon measures which might under conceivable cir-
cumstances be passed again and again by the first
chamber, and be indorsed again and again by the
people to whom they had appealed ? I think this is
another point on which we, who accept our govern-
ments as we find them, who rest on the established
practice that has come down with the precedents of
at least a century, if not two or three centuries, in
its support, may say to our opponents, “It is for
you to come forward with some new and original
defence of this absolute and permanent veto with
which you propose to intrust the second chamber.
If you contend simply for a limited veto —if you
contend, as the hon. member, Captain Russell,
said, simply for such a veto as would enable the body
of the people to reflect, to reconsider, and, if neces-
sary, to amend their judgment—then we are heartily
with you ; and the question of details need not long
occupy us,” But w r hat we' feel to be the real and
important point in the proposition of the hon. mem-
ber, Sir Samuel Griffith, and others, is that they
propose to establish—and I wish to impress this upon
the Convention —a second chamber, which is to have
the pow r er of absolute and continuous veto upon the
proposals sanctioned by the popular chamber, and
sanctioned by the people. Such is the possibility.
Mr. Moore : No !
Mr. DEAKIN; Such is a distinct possibility.
AVith the probabilities I w ill presently deal.
Mr. Brown : A veto for one session !
Mr. DEAKIN: If the hon. member says a veto
for one session, I cordially agree with him. I go
further, and am prepared to make greater concessions
to the upper chamber than he asks. AVhat I say is
that the proposal that emanates from the Premier of
Queensland, supported by the hon. member, Sir
Thomas Mcllwraith, in his able speech, is a plea for
an absolute veto to be vested in the second chamber.
To that I wish to draw attention, for the purpose of
clearing the argument. Hon. delegates wdll perceive,
probably, the relation which this bears to the former
argument. If the second chamber is to be endowed
with an absolute veto, we are bound to ask, what is
the constituency of that chamber —from whom does
it derive its authority to override all other powers in
the state ?
Mr. Cuthbekt : Erom the people!
Mr. DEAKIN: "We will ask, how from the people?
"What proof shall w T e have that the senate has the
approbation of the people ?
Air. Cuthbert : If elected by the people!
Air. DEAKIN: If elected by the people, will
they undertake, in the event of dispute, to face their
electors in order to discover on which side the people
are ?
Air. Adye Douglas : Yes.
Air. DEAKIN: If so, then, we will narrow the
question. If one chamber is to be compelled to
undergo what is known as a penal dissolution —a
dissolution which is a personal penalty, an individual
private penalty inflicted upon every member of the
popular house —if we are called upon to undergo
that trial at the pleasure of the upper chamber, let
the upper chamber also enjoy the sweets of a similar
appeal, and be bound by the same verdict. If hon.
members are prepared to take that stand, we would,
I confess, be obtaining a basis on which further
argument would be possible ; but I have not yet
understood from any of those who have spoken that
they are willing to concede so much. Although the
senate would claim to speak in the name of the
people, and to act in their name, and although its
authority is claimed because it represents the people,
I have yet to hear that its members are willing to
face the people, so as to discover whether they
represent them or not. I will not state for a moment
that it will be possible for any federal second
chamber to act as, in remote periods, we will say,
upper chambers in distant countries have acted with
regard to the popular chamber. AEe have heard of
an upper chamber which has been compelled to pass
measures demanded by the people, revenge itself on


the government in power, and on the house that
compelled the upper chamber to pass these measures,
by emasculating or rejecting other measures in order
to prove that the government could not carry on the
business of the country. We have heard of an upper
chamber turning on a ministry which simply expressed
the popular will and using the authority intrusted to
it in order to injure that ministry.
Mr. Mooef, ; Where did that take place ?
Mr. DEAKIN : In remote times and far distant
countries. It has been done. I can appeal even to
hon. members’ recollection of constitutional history
as to whether it has not been done ; and why should
it not be done ? Do you intrust a body with powers
unless you expect it to exercise them ? The American
Senate has been intrusted to some extent with certain
executive powers, and what is the result ? There is
not only their public action with reference to presi-
dents’ appointments ; but their action with regard to
those appointments before they reach the table of
the House ? Is it not a fact that the senators of the
United States in their own states claim to, and
practically do, exercise the patronage of those states
when their party is in power ? By these means they
have been elevated—and wo all desire to elevate
second chambers : but their elevation has been the
means of depressing the house of representatives,
and depriving it of its due influence. Although it
has strengthened the senate— has aggrandised that
body —it has seriously injured the popular body and
rendered it less fit to discharge some of its most
solemn duties.
Sir John Beat : Do they admit that P
Mr. DEAKIN: When I speak of Americans, I
speak of 60,000,000 people. I need not say that there
is great diversity of opinion; but the hon. member
will find competent authorities quoted in so recent a
work as that of Mr. Bryce—quoted by him as the
verdict of Americans, and not as his verdict. To
return to the point from which this digression led me:
If we endow the second chamber with special powers,
we endow them for the purpose of their exercising them;
if not, why endow them at all ? If we endow them
with an absolute veto, we must mean them to exercise
it. If not, we must say with what degree of veto we
endow them. When we know the constituency of
the body which is to be intrusted with this absolute
veto, we shall discover a body which is to be placed
above the people—a body in which is to be vested a
higher authority than that of the whole people.
Sir Samuel Geiffith: No!
Mr. DEAKIN: Then I fall back on Sir Samuel
Griffith’s policy, and say that I require to have this
explained to me.
Sir Samuel Geiffith : Of separate states, as
aggregations of their own people !
Mr. DEAKIN: I suppose that Sir Samuel Griffith
means that they could elect senators whose policy
they approved of, whose views might be different
from that of the body of the people.
Sir Samuel Geiffith : The majorities of the
separate states might be of a different opinion from
the majority of the people of Australia, taken as
one !
Mr, DEAKIN: It is quite conceivable that
immense majorities in the large states might be
neutralised in the senate by small majorities in the
small states. This is a state of things that has to be
faced, although it is not likely to occur frequently.
I.he other position I was putting will also happen
occasionally, namely, that the senators elected by the
several states will, at times, be at variance both with
Ihe majority of the states and with the majority of
the people of the states, and the one case will occur
as often as that to which Sir Samuel Griffith alluded.
This arises because it is proposed to elect this body
of persons for long terms within which great changes
may take place. So far as any scheme is before us,
it is not proposed that they should be in any way
amenable to their constituents for seven or nine
years. These have been mentioned as probable terms
of office for the senators in the federal parliament,
and if we have men elected for seven or nine years,
do we not clearly endow a body with power to reject
legislation of which the people may have approved
since the commencement of the seven or nine years P
Sir Samuel Griffith : Hear, hear !
Mr. DEAKHST: The lion, member admits that
this might be the case. I ask, is that the most
reasonable and practical way of securing the limited
veto which we desire ? An hon. member thinks it
is. I beg to differ from him. I think that we might
have senates based on the principle of the British
Constitution, which could offer a more reasonable
control on better grounds, and with a better surety
for believing that their members had the confidence
of the people. That is why I fail to see that the
hon. member has established his argument in favour
of endowing this senate, whose method of election
we do not yet understand, with the power of
absolute veto. Then, one more condition. I do not
wish to argue, or to be understood as arguing in the
interests of the other branch of the legislature. I
have spoken repeatedly of the popular house, it is
true; but I look beyond it, as I do beyond the
second chamber, to those from whom their joint
authority emanates. I am willing in all cases to
endow the second chamber with the utmost in-
dependence as regards the first. I do not wish to
see the second chamber existing at the pleasure or
acting under the control of the popular chamber.
What I wish the second chamber to do is to act
under the control, and only by the authority of the
people—acting under the direction of the electors of
the country ; and provided this be granted, I would
never seek to aggrandise the popular chamber at the
expense of the upper house, any more than I would
reverse the process. I will not repeat, as it appeared
to me, the clear and convincing argument of the
hon. the Premier of South Australia with reference
to the manner in which the proposal of the hon.
member to allow the senate to discuss estimates
and amend money bills would be certain to pro*
mote deadlocks ; nor will I dwell on the other
points so ably urged by the hon. member, the
Premier of South Australia, with most of whose
statements I personally cordially agree. I believe
that the experience of hon. members in this chamber,
all of v hom I think have been members of govern-
ments, must coincide with that of the hon. gentleman;
in fact, the hon. the Premier of Queensland admitted
as much. His arguments on this question are all for
exportation, none for home consumption. As regards
his own upper house, he is just as clear as ever that
they have gone far beyond their rights. It has been
his duty, as leader of the popular chamber, to limit
and confine them, and will be so in the future.
Sir Samuel Griffith: This is another senate
altogether!
Mr. DEAKIH: I am coming to that.
Mr. EitzGerxld: The hon. member takes the
two things to be synonomous F
Mr. DEAKIN: The strong point of the hon.
gentleman—although I could not conveniently deal
with it earlier—is that he admits this difference: he
admits—and he has just reiterated his statement—
that he is dealing with the federal senate in a manner
different from that in which he would deal with
any second chamber in the colonies. Sir Thomas
Mcllwraith repeated the point with emphasis, and
made it plain that it is the federal character of the
new second chamber which is relied upon absolutely
and entirely to justify its veto. A\"ere we endeavour-
ing to establish any absolute unity among the people
of Australia, both gentlemen would be found arguing
on the same side as I now am.
Sir Samuel Geiffith : I should, certainly !


Mr. DEAKIN: And I believe Sir Thomas
Well wraith would also. If we were to be one people,
and to forget all local divisions, then Sir Samuel
Griffith and°Sir Thomas Mcllwraith would bo found
on one and the same side. Therefore, the whole case
is narrowed down to one point and I hope they
will correct me if I am doing them an injustice—
thev contend that this departure is justified because
the several states are to have equal representation in
the second chamber, which is to be the custodian of
state rights. The second chamber is to be intrusted
with a power of absolute veto, and with the power of
amending all bills, because there is to be equal
representation in the senate from each colony, and
because the several colonies will assist to form the
federal government.
Mr. FITZGERALD : And because of the weaker
states, of which this will be the chief protection!
Mr. DEAKIN : That, I think, is included in the
argument. We have heard continually, through
this debate, of state rights which are to justify this
supreme authority on the part of the second chamber;
but we have never yet had the slightest indication,
except from one or two illustrations of what state
rights mean —of what state rights are, and of what
peril they are about to be placed in.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Something must be taken
for granted!
MR. DEAKIN: Yes ; but, as it seems to me,
much to the prejudice of the argument. We are
entitled to ask for some specific justification for this
great departure, something more than a general
statement about unknown state rights being in danger.
It is not a question of establishing a federal legisla-
ture, which is to have unlimited authority. The
federal government is to have a strictly limited
power; it is not to range at will over the whole
field of legislation; it is not to legislate for all
conceivable circumstances of national life. On the
contrary, its legislation is to be strictly limited to
certain definite subjects. The states are to retain
almost all their present powers, and should be quite
able to protect their own rights. Thus we get rid of
the vague fear of the infringement of state rights,
and we are entitled to ask those who use this term to
take up the short list of federal powers which it is
proposed to intrust to the federal government, and
to show us where state rights can be impaired by their
exercise. I put aside the question of taxation for a
moment, and in fact all financial questions, with the
intention of dealing with them a little later. I am
extending my remarks more than I had intended to
do; but the interjections with which I have been
met —and I am very happy to answer them —are
partly responsible for that. The list of authorities
conferred upon the national Government of the United
States of America is a short one. Putting aside the
power to collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excise,
and the power to borrow money, the main pow r ers are
to regulate commerce, to establish a uniform rule of
naturalisation, to coin money, to provide for the
punishment of counterfeiting, to establish post-offices,
to grant copyrights, to constitute tribunals inferior
to the Supreme Court, and to provide for defence.
I hope that in the warmth of my advocacy, I am not
leading members to misunderstand my position. I
am arguing for the purpose of elucidation, and not
intending for one moment to imply that there is
nothing to be said in reply. Turning, then, to the
United States, we find the powers intrusted to the
central Government limited, defined, particularised.
If we take the longer list of powers —becausethe longer
it is the more it may tell against my argument —of
the Dominion of Canada, we find a number of subjects
m which it must be clear to hon. members no question
of state rights can be conceivably involved. I will
briefly read them. There is the question of peniten-
tiaries, criminal law, marriage and divorce, naturalisa-
tion, copyrights, patents, bankruptcy, legal tender,
interest, bills of exchange, weights and measures,
savings’ banks, banking, currency, ferries, fisheries,
quarantine, navigation, beacons, salaries of officials,
military, census, postal service, borrowing of money,
taxation, trade, and debt.
Sir Johx Beay : Borrowing of money !
Mr. DEAKIN; In the case of all but a few out
of this list of nearly thirty topics, it is almost incon-
ceivable to imagine a case in which state rights will
be involved. Putting financial questions aside, the
question of state rights cannot be involved in about
twenty-seven out of the thirty subjects in the list.
What is proposed in regard to our new Senate P
Understand that lam seeking for elucidation. It is
proposed that this body should have an absolute veto
upon all subjects, whether they can affect state rights
or not. The contention of those who support the
argument is by implication that the whole of these
subjects, if legislated upon, will involve state rights,
I meet the argument at once with a direct negative by
challenging hon. members to point to an instance in
which any questions such as those to which I have re-
ferred can be legislated upon in such a way as to affect
state rights. Let us now take the chief of them, that
which relates to finances, and connected with which
we have had the greatest amount of argument. In
the first place, it is usually admitted that it is essential
that financial questions should be settled as far as
possible with less delay than pertains to other legis-
lation. The business of a country requires to be
carried on, the state’s creditors require to be paid,
public works have to be continued, and is highly
desirable that there should be a speedy settlement
of any financial legislation. W hen you give the second
chamber a power of absolute veto in regard to these
matters you cannot by any possibility obtain such a
speedy settlement. Again, the senate is a body which
unless it be elected by a direct vote of the people and
can be sent at an emergency to its constituents, w ill
not have a direct responsibility to those people whose
taxation it is about to govern, and whose expenditure
it is about to direct. That is a question that requires
to be taken into consideration. I presume, also, that
it will be a cardinal principle of the federal constitu-
tion that taxation should be uniform.
Sir JoHJf Bray : Not all taxation !
Mr. FitzGerald : When the hon. gentleman says
“ uniform,” does he mean that the same taxation will
be in operation in all the colonies ?
Mr. BEAKIN: What I mean is that all federal
taxation must be uniform.
Sir Johk Beay : That is a very different thing
from what I understood the hon. member to say !
Mr. UEAKIIS : That being so, I may fairly ask
future speakers to point out in what w r ay the question
of state rights can be involved.
Sir •IoHX' Beay : The expenditure must be just to
the several colonies!
Mr. DEAKIN : I have not yet come to the ques-
tion of expenditure. The hon. member is a little
“previous,” as the Americans say. I was talking in
the first instance of taxation, and asking, taxation
being uniform in all the colonies, what magic you
find in the artificial boundaries drawn between one
part of Australia and another which justifies you in
considering that the question of state rights is in-
volved when the taxation operates uniformly on both
sides of the borders ?
Sir Samuel Geimu: Take the case of income-
tax !
Mr. DEAKIN: It will be the greatest satisfaction
to me when we get into Committee to meet interjec-
tions point by point; but having regard to the time
which I must occupy, I could not do so without
neglecting other portions of my argument. But a
few w r ords w r ith regard to the question of income-tax.
My mind is open on the subject; but I cannot see
how an income-tax can in any sense affect the ques-
tion of state rights. The taxation falls upon men


in proportion to their income whether they be on
this side of the Murray or on the other side, whether
they be on one side or the, other of the imaginary
boundary which separates South Australia from
Queensland, or whether they are in Tasmania, or else-
where. What I want to know is how any province,
how any colony, can consider that its rights are
impaired when it is proposed to deal with its residents
in exactly the same way as the citizens of Australia
in every other colony of the group are dealt with ?
How is it conceivable that any distinction can be
made? How can we suddenly make an artificial
boundary a real boundary ?
Mb. Alooee : What about the expenditure ?
Mr. DEAKIN: As to the question of expenditure,
I gather from the “ nods and becks and wreathed
smiles,” with which supporters of the proposal have
favoured me, that expenditure is considered to be
their strong point—that expenditure may in some
way or other impair a state right. What does this
mean? There is something in the apprehension,
though it has nothing to do with states as such or their
rights. It means what we have all to face in our
several colonies—the constant cry of the country
districts that towns in which the population is con-
centrated receive an undue proportion of the public
expenditure, that they are unduly favoured in com-
parison with distant localities, that more monev is
spent among them than would be spent in a perfectly
equitable distribution. The same principle would
apply —and Ido not attempt to disguise or conceal
any argument that tells against my case—under the
federal government. The more populous towns or
districts might argue that as they paid most, they
ought to receive a greater benefit than others; but
the probability is that on the whole they would
receive a little more than their due.
Air. Gillies : Precisely the same argument would
apply in every municipality in the colony !
Mr. DEAKIN: Exactly; there is no local body
in these colonies in connection with the expenditure
of which the same argument might not be used. It
is perfectly true that individual localities are inter-
ested in expenditure. But this suggestion is made,
not in the interests of the state, but of the most
petty localism that can be imagined—in the vain and
futile endeavour, as it always was and will be, to
mete out to each little borough the same amount of
expenditure as to every other borough.
Sir Samuel Griffith : No !
Mr. DEAKIN: It has nothing to do with the
several states as states. It is conceivable that one
part of a colony may be greatly benefited by federal
expenditure and another not ; but there is no state
right involved. Some portions of some colonies may
be more and others less fortunate. But I have yet
to learn how that is to be prevented. Sir Samuel
Griffith pointed to the expenditure upon forts and
arsenals. He pointed out that a great deal of money
might be expended upon a fort at one place, and
none in another. Does the hon. gentleman imagine
that it will be possible, if we are to have national
defences, to consider whether a particular locality
would not like to have a fort because one is required
in the public interest to be erected at another place ?
Are the central government to say that no fort can
be erected here because a fort has not been erected
there ?
Sir Samuel Griffith : No !
Air. DEAKIN : If the hon. gentleman’s argument
does not mean that, what does it mean ?
Sir Samuel Griffith: That the expenditure must
be just to the several colonies !
Air. DEAKIN: I am in accord with the hon.
gentleman if he can lay down any principle by
which the expenditure can be made just to the
several colonies. That reminds me of a point I was
nearly passing. I may be pardoned for leaving this
part of my argument in a confessedly imperfect state;
because, to answer all interjections would take too
long. I shall be delighted to resume the argument
in Committee, to obtain more knowledge, and to
challenge the advocates of the policy to show that
any expenditure can conflict with state rights pro-
perly so-called. Let them in the first instance define
state rights, and then let us see how they will be
impaired. I will be second to no delegate in my
anxiety to preserve what I understand to be state
rights. So anxious am I to preserve them, that I
would never dream of intrusting them to a senate.
Let us know what state rights are, and let us be care-
ful to secure them under our constitution, so that
they may never be liable to be swept away. We
should fail in our duty if we did not embody in our
draft such a distinct limitation of federal power as
would put the preservation of state rights beyond the
possibility of doubt. If state rights are involved in
the question of taxation and expenditure of the fede-
ral body in any way, let us impose some special con-
ditions to meet the case. These should receive the
highest sanction, that of the constitution, and not be
left to the care of any second chamber, which might
fail in the hour of need. I would support any pro-
posal in this direction as cordially as would any dele-
gate in the Convention. We have yet to see the
senate which would long resist a house of represen-
tatives and a powerful executive backed up by the
popular will. In the course of your resolutions, sir,
you distinctly set out the principles of the British
Constitution as to finance, and I find that one of the
resolutions carried by the Canadian Convention ex-
pressly indicated its adherence to a principle which,
so far as my poor judgment goes, this Convention
will do well to adopt. The 3rd resolution of the
Canadian Convention was as follows:
In framing a constitution for the general government, the
conference, with a view to the perpetuation of our
connection with the mother country, and the promotion
of the best interests of the people of these provinces,
desire to follow the model of the British Constitution,
so far as our circumstances permit.
Bor my own part, I do not see how it perpetuates the
connection with the mother country. That would be
perpetuated under one form as well as under another.
But I do believe we should be promoting the best
interests of the people of this great country if we too
were to follow this safe and splendid model. With
reference to an A ustralian court of appeal it appears
that questions of imperial interest must necessarily bo
reserved for the Privy Council. It may yet be a subject
for argument, to which I shall bring an open mind,
whether issues involving important principles of com-
mon law ought not also to go to the Privy Council,
in order to preserve uniformity of interpretation
throughout the empire. I cordially agree with the
resolution, however, and believe that by far the greater
part of the appeals which at present go to the Privy
Council might be better settled here by a federal
court of appeal. Not only that, but I should be glad
to see the federal government take under its control
some of the superior and criminal court business at
present transacted by the several colonies ; but that
is a question distinctly for Committee. Then we come
to the last clause in the resolution, which deals with
the appointment of the executive and the governor-
general, the advisers of the governor-general to be
members of Parliament, and their term of office to
depend upon their having the confidence of the
popular house. If my opinion were asked in conver-
sation or in a debating society as to whether respon-
sible government had any defects I should be prepared
to admit that it had; if asked whether the United
States Constitution, which is so widely revered, and
obtains so much admiration, does not in some respects
possess advantages which even the British Constitu-
tion does not possess, I should admit that also. If
asked whether the Swiss system of electing ministers
from the House did not also possess advantages I


should say, “ Yes.” Consequently, so far as theoreti-
cal argument goes, I am in agreement on those points
with the hon. delegate, Sir Samuel Griffith ; but when
he suggests that because we personally approve of
certain portions of foreign constitutions that we
should at once adopt these innovations upon our
traditions and be prepared to embody them in a
scheme for a federal constitution 1 come to a pause.
Sir Samuel Griffith: I made no such sugges-
tion, nor anything like it. I suggested that the
future should be allowed to work out its own des-
tiny!
Mr. DEAKIN: I take it that the future will be
allowed to do that whether the hon. gentleman sug-
gests it or not.
Sir Samuel Griffith : The hon. gentleman puts
an erroneous construction on what I said !
Mr. DEAKIN: I will say that Sir Samuel Griffith
did not say it. What he said led me to infer that
he doubted the wisdom of continuing the system of
responsible government in its present form.
Sir Samuel Griffith ; Of insisting on its con-
tinuance !
Mr. DEAKIN: He doubted the wisdom of insisting
upon its continuance in its present form. In this I
cordially agree with him. But the hon. gentleman
made no specific proposal. I regret that I have done
him a momentary injustice; but it was only a mo-
mentary injustice. I understood him to cast grave
doubts on our constitutions as they exist, and to
imply that it would be a great improvement—that it
might be preferable —to adopt some parts of the
American, and even some parts of the Swiss, Con-
stitution.
Sir Samuel Griffith: I am totally misunder-
stood by the hon. member!
Mr. DEAKIN: Then I withdraw the statement*
If the hon. gentleman had said so, I should be pre-
pared theoretically to agree with him; but not on
that account to support their immediate introduc-
tion into the federal constitution. The hon. delegate
from New Zealand—Captain Bussell—indicated that
some of these ideas had been passing through the
minds of the people of New Zealand. Surely we
shall be far safer in adhering as much as possible to
the Constitution with which we are all familiar, and
grafting upon it as little as possible that is new. I
do not say for a moment that the premiers of Queens-
land and New Zealand have not made out a case for
the consideration of the Convention with regard to
the upper house.
An Hon. Member : There is no upper house.
The federal senate!
Mr. DEAKIN: I use the names indifferently. I
do not know which it will assume.
An Hon. Member : They mean two different
things,
Mr. DEAKIN: I have been trying to argue
An llon. Member : The name was wrong.
Mr. DEAKIN: I should be sorry to base an
argument upon a name ; yet for all that there is
something in a name. We require to recollect what
upper houses have been, and what they may bo when
re-born with a new name.
, Mr. Barton : I suppose the hon. member bases
his argument upon an upper house ?
Mr. DEAKIN: I should be sorry to think- that it
ever rested upon such a perilous foundation. It is
not a little thing to create a new Upper House on a
new pattern as is proposed. The Constitution which
we now enjoy, it appears, is to be set aside with less
ceremony than one would have expected from gentle-
men who have lived under it, and have exercised its
highest powers for many years. We seem to be ready
to depart from institutions which have the sanction
of long experience, almost entirely on theoretical
grounds. It is true that hon. members have looked
to the experience of other countries; but in doing
this they have ignored some of the most pertinent
lessons of our own, which is that if we establish two
chambers of equal authority, we prepare the way for
dissension, and encourage deadlocks. The consti-
tutional history of Victoria gives ample evidence of
this. What we have been so long striving for, and
what we are still striving for in that colony, is some
means of arbitrament for the settlement of disputes
between the two chambers.
An Hon. Member : Simply mechanical!
Mr. DEAKIN: I care not whether it is mechan-
ical or not, as long as it is there, and as long as it
proves effective. If we allow the present state of
things to exist, it must lead to dispute and contention.
The final point to which I think it necessary to direct
the attention of the Convention most seriously, in
order that in drawing the constitution proposed to
be adopted by federated Australasia we may not
shape it without regard to recent interpretations of
colonial constitutional rights, is to be found in the
judgment in the case of Ah Toy versus Musgrove,
delivered by the Supreme Court of Victoria. In that
case the powers of the Executive and those conferred
upon the colony under the Constitution were
challenged in the courts and before the Privy Council.
The finding is one that will demand the most careful
consideration when the federal constitution is being
framed, because it has been the common belief in
Victoria that we had all the powers and privileges
attaching to responsible government, sufficient to
enable us to perform all the duties and to exercise all
the rights devolving upon us as a people. The gravest
doubt is now thrown upon this belief. The people
of Victoria are under many obligations to their dis-
tinguished Chief Justice —and especially for his judg-
ment in this suit, in which he has displayed the acumen
of the lawyer, the eloquence of the orator, and the
grasp of the statesman. Chief Justice Higinbotham
said :
It was the intention of the Legislative Council to provide
a complete system of responsible government in and for
Victoria, and that intention was carried into full legislative
effect with the knowledge and approval and at the instance
of the Imperial Government by the “Constitution Statute,”
passed by the Imperial Parliament.
He was supported in his opinion by Mr. Justice
Kerferd, who for some time was Attorney-General
of Victoria. Mr. Justice Kerferd said :
All the prerogatives necessary for the safety and protection
of the people, the administration of the law, and the conduct
of public affairs in and for Victoria, under our system of
responsible government, have passed as an incident to the
grant of self-government (without which the grant itself
would be of no effect) and may be exercised by the repre-
sentative of the Crown in the advice of responsible ministers.
These two quotations embody the belief which was
held until lately in Victoria. The majority of our own
Supreme Court overruled this reading, Mr. Justice
Williams said:
I have been for years, in common with, I believe, very many
others, under the delusion (as I must term it) that we enjoyed
in this colony responsible government in the proper sense of
the term. I awake to find, as far as my opinion goes, that
we have merely an instalment of responsible government.
Mr. Justice Holroyd considers that we have only a
measure of self-government, and two other judges
concur. My colleague, Mr. Wrixon, who argued the
case with great force and ability before the Privy
Council, says:
If the reading put by the Supreme Court in Victoria upon
our Constitution Act be correct, then not only in the colony
of Victoria, but in all the groups of Australasian colonies, the
governments which we now enjoy are without warrant of
law.


That is a strong statement, and the judgment of the
majority of our Supreme Court justifies me in assert-
ing that this Convention cannot too soon face the
issue involved in it. I take it that the people of
Australasia will not be satisfied with any "instal-
ment" or any "measure" of responsible government,
or any limitations, except such as are necessary to
the unity of the empire. We claim, without shadow
of doubt or vestige of qualification, all the powers
and privileges possessed by Englishmen. The
governor-general as representative of the Queen in
these federated colonies, should be clothed by statute
with all the powers which should belong to the repre-
sentative of her Majesty. He should be above all
risk of attack, because he should act only on the
advice of responsible ministers, who should be pre-
pared either to obtain the sanction of parliament for
their acts or vacate office. Parliament, in its turn,
should be brought into intimate relation with the
electorates. This is true, popular government. This
will satisfy the people of Australia. Nothing less will
satisfy them. And why should we distrust them, or
question their capacity, or seek to impose the bonds of
an absolute veto upon them ? The people of this con-
tinent were not landed upon its shore to-day, ignorant
of the responsibilities of self-government. They have
amply proved in the past that they are entitled to be
trusted with all the powers appertaining to a free
people. They have believed that they enjoyed freedom
under their present constitution second to none in
the world. When the question of a second chamber
comes to be considered, they will assuredly not be
satisfied to possess less freedom. More than this :
In framing a federal constitution, we should set out
with the explicit claim to possess and exercise all the
rights and privileges of citizens of the British em-
pire to the same extent that they are possessed and
exercised by our fellow-countrymen in Great Britain
itself. Australia is entitled to absolute enfranchise-
ment. In our union we attain political manhood and
the stature of a full- grown democracy. We can
wear no constitutional garb capable of cramping a
muscle or confining an artery of national life. A\ 7 e
claim the fullest means of developing all its energies
and all its aspirations, and of encountering all that
can oppose them. Why place wisps of straw upon
the arms of the young giant, only to become a cause
of complaint and to be burst the first time his
strength is put forth ? Establishing a constitution
" broad based upon the people's will," we shall be
securing the safety and security of the state which
we propose to raise ; but to do anything short of
this would be to sow the seeds of discord and dis-
union. We are dealing with a constitution which
has not yet reached the full period of its growth,
which always has been and always will be steadily
progressive, expansive, and adaptable to national
growth. There are many things in the suggestions
made by the hon. members from Queensland and
other delegates, which are worthy of the fullest
consideration. These can be adopted as soon as
they commend themselves to the federal parliament.
TJn'der this system of government all things are
possible. I have addressed myself to the subject
hurriedly; but I trust I have not been misunderstood.
I am prepared to reconsider and review the whole
question with the aid of those older and abler than
myself, in the sincere desire to arrive at a sound
conclusion. But Ido trust that we shall not throw
aside the constitution under which we have had
experience, we shall not forget its triumphs and suc-
cessses, its proud history, and its splendid promise;
Ave shall determine not to hastily interfere with its
harmony, or destroy the symmetry of its proportions.
"What we should aspire to see is a strong government
upon the broadest popular basis, and Avith the amplest
national poAver. We should seek to erect a consti-
tutional edifice, which shall be a guarantee of liberty
and union for all time to come, to the whole people
o£ this continent and the adjacent islands, to which
they shall learn to look up with reverence and regard,
which shall stand strong as a fortress and be held
sacred as a shrine.
Motion (by Mr. Baht ox) proposed :
That the debate be now adjourned.
Question put and division called for.
The Peesidext : I propose, if there is a division,
instead of appointing tellers, as we should do in a
house of parliament, to call upon the officers of the
house to take the division.
The request for a division was not pressed.
Motion agreed to.
Sir Samuel G-eiffitii ; I wish to say one -word
with reference to the division that did not take place
on the motion of adjournment. I was aware that
one of the members of the Convention was prepared
to speak this afternoon, and I understand that others
were prepared to speak. But I wish to say that I
took my seat on your left, sir, just now, for the pur-
pose of emphasising by doing so the fact that the
members who come from distant parts of Australia
cannot afford to adjourn at 4 o’clock every after-
noon ; and I sincerely trust that members whose
homes are nearer Sydney than those of many of us
will bear that in mind and give consideration to
distant members.
Mr. Playfoed : I only wish to say that if wo
cannot go on more expeditiously than we have to-day
—that is, stopping the debate soon after 4 o’clock—
we shall not be able to afford the time that will be
necessary to enable us to complete our work. It will
lie simply out of the question unless members are
prepared to go on with the work. Those who repre-
sent distant colonies cannot afford to give more than
six weeks at the outside to the work ; but according
to the progress we are now making, the time occupied
will be more like three months.
Mr. Abbott : I would like to point out that those
who are complaining are hon. members who have
themselves spoken and taken up a considerable
portion of the time. It is all very w r ell for those
gentlemen to complain of w'aste of time; but they
are certainly under some obligation to those of us
who)have patiently listened to them. So far as I am
concerned, as one of the members resident in New
South Wales, I am prepared to sit here day and
night. It is quite as inconvenient for us, who have
our business to attend to, to be here, as it is for
those who come from the other colonies. The New
South Wales members are prepared to give every con-
sideration to those who represent the other colonies,
but it is not fair to say w r e are wasting time. What
about those gentlemen who have made long speeches?
1 do not charge them with wasting time, but w'ould
only observe that it is a strange thing that those who
complain of an early adjournment have already made
their speeches.
Mr. Baetox : I feel that I owe the Convention a
word of explanation. I was quite unaware that there
was a disinclination to adjourn at 4 o’clock, or that
the question of an early adjournment w r ould have
borne itself so strongly on the mind and heart of
the Convention, as it appears to have done all
of a sudden. It was proposed this morning that we
should adjourn at half-past 12 o’clock until half-past
2 o’clock because somebody was not ready; but
Captain Eussell, with that gallantry which we might
expect from the hon. member, filled the breach, and
took us on to a quarter to 1 o’clock. It might have
been supposed that those who were so anxious that
the sittings of the Convention should terminate in a
more reasonable time would have suggested then that
the adjournment should take place until 2 o’clock.
Instead of that, when you, sir, proposed that we
should meet at half-past 2 o’clock, everybody was


ready. Yesterday we adjourned at 4 o’clock; pre-
viously we adjourned at 4 o’clock. Was I wrong in
assuming that the sense of the Convention would be
in favour of adjourning at the instance of the gentle-
man who desired to speak ? I must confess it rather
surprised me to find that, as the hon. member, Mr.
Abbott, has put it, at the instance of certain gentle-
men who had already spoken, there was a sudden
desire that, they having spoken —of course not for
that reason —the debate upon these resolutions should
be conducted with the utmost celerity. I would
join with these gentlemen in this way —if they will
suggest that the remaining sittings of the Convention
last from half-past 10 o’clock until 1 o’clock morning
sittings, and from 2 o’clock until half-past 4 o’clock
afternoon sittings, aud that we should sit twice a
week in the evenings. lam quite sure that the other
delegates, who have not come from a distance, and
who have not such large interests awaiting them in
their colonies, will only be too glad to consult their
convenience and adopt any proposal of that kind
which they may bring before the Convention. But
to save myself from misapprehension I must say that
when I moved the adjournment to-day I thought it
was in pursuance of a general desire to adjourn at
4 o’clock as indicated by the whole of our antecedent
proceedings.
Colonel Smith : I quite agree with what has fallen
from the hon. member, Mr. Barton, and, personally,
I am prepared to sit here all day, if necessary, and a
reasonable part of the night in order to get through
the business. Of course, short sittings are less
inconvenient to the New South Wales delegates,
because they are able to attend to their private
business, while we are not, and on that ground we
are entitled to some consideration. But what I wish
to say is this : that I think we might sit occasionally
—and I am glad the suggestion came from the hon.
member, Mr. Barton —in the evening. We might
sit three nights a week, on alternate evenings, for a
reasonable time, and it would enable us to get through
our business much quicker. The debate now going
on is, of course, a most important one ; but I was in
hopes that a good deal of the business of the Con-
vention would be referred to two or three commit-
tees, which would save an enormous amount of labour
to the general body of the Convention. If w T e ap-
pointed committees, which should take certain subjects
into consideration and report to the Convention, we
should save an immense amount of time and trouble,
and perhaps annoyance. I shall suggest this course
later on.
Sir .Tout Beat : I was one of those who favoured
the adjournment. It seemed to be the impression on
the part of some of the delegates that only those who
had made long speeches favoured the adjournment.
I have not had the pleasure of making a long speech,
but still lam anxious to go on with the business. I
feel that in this, as in other things, we must be bound
by the wish of the majority, and it was clearly the wish
of the majority to have an adjournment until to-
morrow. As one of those coming from a distant colony,
I hope the delegates will agree to expedite business as
much as possible. Whether we shall sit late in the
evening or not must depend on the will of the majority
of members, and if it is understood that all those who
are prepared to speak will have an opportunity of
doing so, and that the business will not be concluded
until they have had that opportunity, none of us can
grumble; but I trust that adjournments will not be
too frequent, and that we shall do all we can to ex-
pedite the business.
Convention adjourned at 4'22 p.m.

Federal Constitution (third day’s debate) Addresses™

The President took the chair at II a.m.
FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.
THIRD DATA DEBATE.
Debate resumed on resolutions proposed by Sir
Henry Parkes (vide page 11)
Mr. BARTON : I am fain to say that the kind
cheer just accorded to me gives me more trepidation
than encouragement, because since I moved the ad-
journment of the debate yesterday upon the momen-
tous questions that are now before this Convention,
I have been wondering at my own audacity. Never-
theless, I trust not to be too long in addressing this
Convention, and I trust at any rate that I shall not
wander away from my subject until I shall have
found it necessary to close my remarks. It does
seem to me that you, sir, deserve the commendation
of this Convention for having introduced these
resolutions in the form which they take. It would
not have been, at this stage of our proceedings, a wise
thing to endeavour, for instance, to enumerate com-
pletely the powers which should he given to the gene-
ral government and to the provinces respectively. Nor
would it have been wise to enter into details of any
kind, because there are certain matters which pre-
cede detail, and which must be dealt with by us
before we can even come to the conclusion that it will
be within our power to draft or bring up the scheme
of a constitution which will be acceptable to the
several provinces. But the form in which you have
brought forward these resolutions rests so much
upon principle and so little upon detail that they are
eminently calculated to secure that general accept-
ance which will be the basis of our future labours,
and which will enable us to attain the end for which
we are wmrking. I concur strongly with the hon.
member, Mr. Deakin, in thinking that the form in
which the first batch of resolutions is introduced is
also one that should commend itself to us —that is to
say, what is endeavoured to be affirmed by these reso-
lutions is that certain great principles should be
agreed to rather than that there should be anything
like a hard and fast delimitation of any lines. The
first of the resolutions I shall deal with in a minute
or two in connection with the question of the parlia-
ment; but dealing now with Nos. 2 and 3, I do not
find it at this stage necessary to debate them at
any length. I cannot fail to agree both with the
2nd and 3rd resolutions, of course presupposing
that the power aud authority to impose customs’
duties, given by the 3rd resolution, also conveys
the power to impose duties of excise correspond-
ing. But it is suggested that, before these resolu-
tions can be implanted in any constitution, they
should be accompanied by certain guarantees. That
raises a difficult question, and I am not quite sure
that upon that point also I am not in some agree-
ment with the hon. member, Mr. Deakin. No
doubt there are some of the states which have given
almost certain guarantees to their citizens of the
continuance of certain forms of taxation under
which vested interests have arisen; and, no doubt
also, that is an argument which will prevail—
and it has prevailed even with free-traders, much
more, therefore, with myself, as a protectionist—that
such vested interests, when they have sprung up, are
not to be lightly dealt with, and that the security
which they have enjoyed, and under which they have
been raised, shall not be lightly removed. Although
I cannot say that I agree with the method proposed
by my hon. friend—at any rate, until I hear further
argument about it —that it should be for the federal
government to impose a gradual reduction of the


higher tariffs until some point is reached at which it
can be said that the interests which have sprung up
are let down lightly; still, I think means may be
provided under which all he asks for may be secured,
and at a price which, at any rate, it is worth Avhile
for these colonies to give for their federation. If,
for instance —and I only mention it as an instance —
the provision were, and it were also implanted in the
constitution, that the individual states should main-
tain for themselves their rights as to the imposition
of customs and excise—their tariffs—until a certain
specified period after the proclamation of the consti-
tution, it seems to me that that Avould be a more
effective and more simple method of doing that which
the hon. member requires. Speaking humbly for
myself, I cannot see that, looking to the spirit of
compromise with which we enter into this Convention,
the colonies generally —those ones, or that one which
is not attached to protection—will be paying any
unreasonable price for the benefits of federation. I
take it as a matter of course that at some period, and
at an early period, after the federation of the colonies,
the trade and intercourse, whether by w r ay of land
carriage or coastal navigation, shall be absolutely
free. It is impossible to suppose a perfect union,
except under such a condition. But while that is
laid down, it is equally open to us to say that for
a certain time we may be able, and must be able, to
put up with a union somewhat imperfect. I must
say that it does appear to me, when one endeavours
to look at the matter from the point of view of
others as well as from one’s own point of view, that
some compromise of this kind is one to which
probably this Convention will be impelled if any-
thing secure by way of a constitution is to arise and
come from its labours. Passing away from that
question, which, of course, will be vastly more fully
debated in committee, I wish to deal with resolution
No. 1:
That the powers and privileges and territorial rights of the
several existing colonies shall remain intact, except in
respect to such surrenders as may be agreed upon as
necessary and incidental to the power and authority of
the national federal government.
I should have liked to see added to this, unless
indeed it is intended to be included, something which
will specify that the actual territory of any existing
province shall not be subject to any kind of diminu-
tion or absorption for the purpose of constituting
new provinces, except with the consent of the legis-
ture of the province affected. That, sir, you may
have intended in this resolution. If that is stated to
be so, I am perfectly satisfied ; but I am also equally
satisfied that we are not likely to base federation on
the good-will and union of the colonies unless a
guarantee of that kind be provided. With respect
to the question of the powers, privileges, and terri-
torial rights of the existing colonies, I said that I would
endeavour to consider it in connection with the
question of the parliament alluded to in the first
resolution under the second heading. I take it that
this first resolution must be an essential of any
just union of the colonies. Unless, indeed,
these territorial rights and privileges are con-
served, federation would appear to be well nigh
impossible ; and I think I may be pardoned for saying
that it seems an obvious construction that the powers
and privileges and territorial rights mentioned here
are all those state rights as to which the hon. member,
Mr. Deakin, yesterday asked the question, “What
are the state rights?” The state rights, it seems to
me, are claimed by rather a narrow term. It is
state interests we have to deal with, and unless
the state interests are effectually preserved in a
federal scheme, that scheme will be worth nothing,
because it can be worth only so much as consists of
the goodwill of the parties to it. If that is so, all
those state rights which are not to be specially
assigned to the general authority must be religiously
preserved to the various states, and it will, therefore,
be essential that the constitution provide —and I take
it as a necessary consequence that the constitution
shall provide—for a legislative body which, in addi-
tion to the functions of a house of representatives,
and in addition to the functions of a second chamber,
will also be the guardian of those individualities,
those state rights or interests. If those state rights
or interests are threatened in any legislative proposal,
whether or not it is contained in a money bill, they
will be under the especial care of the federal senate ;
and if state rights are threatened, whether in a money
bill or not, it seems to me that it is not good argu-
ment to fall back upon the representative principle
to the extent of saying that there is only one repre-
sentative legislature, and, therefore, only one which
can deal freely with questions of money and taxation
if the very spirit upon which the federation rests is
threatened by any scheme in a money or taxation
bill.
Mr. Dear in : If!
Mr. BARTON”: The “if” is not a long way off.
Sir Thomas Mcllwraitic : There are precedents !
Mr. BARTON ; When I heard the hon. member,
Mr. Deakin, in his very brilliant speech, talking so
positively about the representative principle as being
the only safeguard of the federation, it struck me
that he to some extent ignored the fact that it was
possible for the representative principle to be pre-
served and instituted from its very foundation in two
chambers just as well as in one. It is not because
the representative principle has not been preserved,
or not well preserved, in most of these second
chambers, commonly called upper houses, that we are
to come to the conclusion that the representation of
the people from the very foundation of representation
is not to be found in a second chamber ; and I take
it that a senate founded upon some such basis as the
Senate of the United States, not only really conserves
the representation of the people, but is part of the
organ by which the will of the people is expressed.
The organ by which the will of the people is expressed
is not necessarily the house of representatives alone.
Because one chamber is called par excellence the
hquse of representatives, because one house rests on
local representation, it does not follow that we cannot
make another house of representatives, which will
represent not only the states themselves, but also, as
Mr. Deakin put it, cannot represent those states
without representing their people. If that is so, and
if the representative principle is as much implanted
in one of those chambers as in the other, upon what
principle can it rest that the senate should not deal
with the question of money or taxation, but may with
any other question in which any state interests are
likely to be threatened ? What is the object ? Is it
because we are simply accustomed to have the re-
presentative power placed in one body that we cannot
conceive theideaof therebeing a form of federation, or
a union of states, in which there cannotbe any thorough
representation unless we have two such bodies ? It
seems almost an obvious proposition that where you
have not what may be called —I do not speak from a
religious point of view—a Unitarian constitution, but
a legislative union such as we propose in this case,
unless you are going to maintain the principle of
representation—you may call it the representation of
state individuality if you like—in the second chamber,
you are not forming a federal constitution at all. If
you are forming a federal constitution, and upon
federal principles, you cannot kick the principle of
representation out of the doors of the second chamber.
If I am right in that contention—and I believe that,
at any rate, it is a contention founded upon a correct
sequence —it will be obviousty as unwise as impossible
at the same time to maintain a constitution resting
upon goodwill, and during that time to deprive the
second chamber of a veto, even in detail, upon pro-
positions which may affect the rights, and possibly


the existence, of the states. It is not difficult to
imagine an illustration. An illustration comes to us
in the most familiar form. lam not going to enter
too much now upon ground that may be debatable :
but if we are to have the primary chamber —the
house of representatives, resting, as I hope it will
rest, upon universal suffrage and local representa-
tioll,_there is no doubt that, being based upon popu-
lation it will give a very large preponderance of
power in that chamber to the most populous states.
All of us are accustomed to legislative propositions
in which questions of policy, questions affecting local
or state interests, are so inextricably interwoven with
questions of money, that to deny the power of veto in
detail upon these is to prohibit the exercise of state
rffiht at all. I venture to say, therefore, that if you
once admit the principle of the custody of state
interests in a representative chamber, resting not upon
mere locality, but upon the individualism of the
states —representing through the states their people
just as the other house represents the people through
a locally elected assembly —you can no more deny the
right of veto in detail on questions of money and
taxation than you can deny it in respect of anything
else. It is clearly upon reasons of that kind that the
framers of the Constitution of the United States saw
thev must give the power of amendment to the senate.
I ain not here, as has been suggested to-day some-
where else, to make a speech in favour of upper
houses. My views in that respect have undergone
some change, and I am, probably, no fonder than the
hon. member, Mr. Deakin, is of the nominee principle
in legislation, or, as I think Goldvvin Smith has called
it, “ the barefaced proposal ” to permit the leader of
a dominant faction to secure the interests of his
faction by appointments which are not under the will
of the people. But there is one result of the argu-
ment which I now put forward, if it is correct, which
I will ask hon. members to bear in mind. If you
resolve to accept the Constitution of the United
States Senate for our federal constitution you will
find it to be an almost absolute necessity of the case
that all your second chambers in your individual
states shall be elective. If that has the approval of
the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, as I am sure it has, he
will see that one good result will flow from the custody
of state rights being as much without limit as it is
safe to make it. I said an illustration in this matter
is to be found in the case of the capital, and I wish to
handle this subject as delicately as one may, looking at
the various opinions which of course exist all round as
to the place which should be the capital. If we consider
the very large preponderance of voting power gained
by the principle of representation according to popu-
lation in the house of representatives, as I suppose
it is to be called, we can conceive this state of things:
the introduction of a bill fixing some place or city —
either an existing city or some arbitrarily defined
area—as the capital of the federal dominion. We
can conceive that bill being surrounded with all the
necessary provisions to bring into effect the desire to
constitute this capital, and then we shall see that it is
impossible that a bill of that kind can be anything
but a money bill —a bill of expenditure. If the
principal of vetoing in detail is to be withheld from
the federal senate, Avhat is to be done with that bill ?
Are all the senate, except the one state which shall
find the capital w T ithiu it, to combine in rejecting the
bill, and ensuring its rejection time after time until
each state finds something to its liking? Is that the
way in which the thing is to be done, or is it to be
subject to proper restrictions —subject to some other
method of settling what may be a cause of friction
and deadlock? Is it not better that such a matter
should be dealt with separately from the money pro-
visions? If it is not—and we can quite conceive
those who are in a large majority in the house of
representatives—a government with a large majority
—taking this means of enforcing their will —and it
cannot be called tacking in any sense —it is impossible
to foresee an end to the trouble and friction that will
ensue. That is one instance of the harm that will
result if the federal senate is not intrusted with some
power of veto as to details, because the result will
probably be that bill after bill for this purpose would
be brought in, and be rejected one after another.
Is it not more desirable for the prevention of friction
—is it not more desirable in order that there may
not be deadlocks, which my hon. friend seems so to
anticipate —that the second chamber should not be
confined to the veto, as I may say, in globo —the
veto of a measure altogether? What is likely, for
instance, to be the result of such a proceeding ? Do
we not know what it has been in other places ? I am
not going to enter into any discussion of the justice
of the position many times taken up by second
chambers —upper houses, as they may, perhaps, be
more technically called —in dealing with proposals
coming from the representative chamber. But when
w r e examine the course of these things we find that
where the right of amendment, or the right of veto
in detail has not been secured, the greatest friction
has occurred. Ido not say that has not been neces-
sary ; I do not say that it may not have been wise—
for that is a matter which we need not carry into this
debate —to limit the powers of second houses, many
of which are nominee ; but what I do mean to convey
is this : that we have seen in our own experience
that in cases where a right of amendment has been
exercised, or a right, at any rate, of veto in detail, it
has been possible to excise an obnoxious provision,
and pass the rest of a measure, and that that has
frequently been accepted subject to future action.
On the other hand, especially when you find that the
whole custody of state rights as respects national
measures is in the federal senate as the last resort,
how great a temptation the restriction of the veto to
an entire rejection will be to them to do one of two
things, either to get rid of a whole measure of public
policy because it in part interferes with state in-
terests, or, on the other hand, to surrender their
function of safeguarding those interests in order that
a measure of public policy may not be lost. Is either
of these things good, and is not either of them likely
to be avoided by granting a veto in detail P So,
therefore, I do not share the very powerfully stated
objection of my hon. friend, Mr. Deakin, to the
proposition raised by Sir Samuel Griffith. I think
that when we come to examine this question a
- little more fully we shall find that we can get rid of
any confusion arising from previous experience of
bodies which do not embody the federal principle.
We shall be inclined on the very ground of the theory
of representation to concede this veto in detail to a
body which does embody the federal principle. And
I take pleasure in stating that this argument appears
to me to be correct, because I find that there is an in-
sinuation, out of doors at any rate, that the settlement
of the principles of a federal constitution is likely to
result in some sort of conflict between those who
represent the large and populous states and those
who represent the weaker ones. I trust that there
will be no conflict of that kind, and speaking for my-
self —and I think I can speak for the whole of my
brother delegates, though as to whether they are at
one with me in this argument I know not —but speak-
ing as to their wishes and desires, I am quite sure
that they will not, at any rate, and that they feel
that nobody else will be, parties to any attempt to
take away anything which ought of right to belong
to less populous and less wealthy communities, sim-
ply by the exertion—as they may exert them under
the federal constitution, if it is not righteously guarded
—of powers which would collocate too much in the
hands of the union, if it were under the Unitarian
system of government, in oblivion of the very fact
that those rights rest on the federal principle. I
think, then, that the course of veto in detail tentfs

NATIONAL AUSTRALASIAN CONVENTION, 1891.


rather to lessen than to increase friction, because the
danger of friction does not rest in legislatures
alone —the friction that will be dangerous will
be the irritation of individual states in their po-
litical capacities. It must not be forgotten that
there is to be a double citizenship conferred by this
constitution upon every citizen of these states and of
the great nation which w r e hope to found. If there
is that double citizenship and there is not in all
essentials a due representation of it even in questions
of money, then the friction of which my hon. and
learned friend sees so much danger in the relations
between the senate and the house of representatives
on occasions in other places, say in America, would
be merely a surface indication of deep-seated irrita-
tion, which any negation of proper rights will evoke
within the states which are parties to the compact.
It is upon the question whether you secure their
goodwill or provoke their irritation that the dangers
exist, and it depends upon our care in that respect
whether these dangers will grow to a head or wither
away. Mere specifications or schedules in acts of
parliament are not the only things to look to —mere
delimitation of rights and powers —because it is in
what we may call the overlap that the danger arises.
However religiously you may separate and guard the
functions which you give to the one great legislature
and to the subsidiary legislatures, there are points on
which it has been always found that they sometimes
will overlap ; and following out the principle of the
Ist resolution here, especially considering the vast
growth to which they had attained before this move-
ment was taken in hand, unless we conserve to the
states not a mockery of their rights, but an effective
assertion of them in case of such overlap, we shall
soon find many who will regret their compact, and if
it is a compact that they find indissoluble, then so
much the worse for the union. So I take it that if
you wish to preserve the goodwill of the states, and
their adherence to the general constitution, not as a
matter of compulsion, but as a matter of loyal good
faith, you will do all that you can to secure, and not
to reduce, the power to provide against any
encroachment. And to reduce a great representative
body, founded upon the very recognition of state
individuality, if I may use the term, and highly
representative of the component communities —to
reduce that body because of some experience which
Ave have under a wholly different system to the level
of a mere revising nominee chamber, would not be
good work. It would be dangerous Avork ; it Avould
be work which would result, if it resulted in any
union at all, in one which would be the subject of
friction and regret from day to day, and from year
to year. Let us not run into this danger. It is
incumbent upon those Avho represent the large
states, Avhile taking care that neither they nor any-
body else shall make too large a surrender, to see that
no form of government is established which may
place states weaker in population at the mercy of
others. And let us all recollect that these are change-
ful communities; that they are in various stages of
development; that that which is to-day the least
populous may in fifty years be the most populous ;
that we are not legislating for ourselves alone. Let
those who are anxious—of course, as I know well,
without any desire to be agressors—for a form of
constitution Avhich may result in an encroachment
upon those rights recollect that any of the states may
one day be the victim of that very encroachment;
and therefore legislating for the future, as we hope
the parliaments will legislate upon our initiative,
and not legislating for to-day, let us take the
utmost care to introduce those protective provi-
sions which after all will be the protection of
ourselves —the protection of ourselves as citizens
of a federated state in all our relations as such
citizens, and our protection for the future in
respect of our state individuality. The best way
to do this is, I think, to recognise the fact that
while the ordinary will and impulse of the people
is conserved, and its operation is conserved in the
house of representatives, still the senate will be a
part, and a necessary part, of the expression of the
people's will, because if it be not, we shall forget
that each citizen has a double citizenship to perform.
Now, the Senate of the United States is, I have
said, elected on some such system as, subject to
further arguments, I hope to see existing in this
federation, and we know what the result of that
system is. The election is based on universal
suffrage —because the senators are elected by the
legislatures of the individual states who are elected
by universal suffrage —and the result is a legislative
body the judgment and capacity of which comes
quite up to the ideal or the standard outlined by the
President in his opening speech. It is worth while
considering on this point whether there is not a
sacrifice of the intellect and power of a state when
you take means to secure the representation which in
the United States has been proved to have commanded
the respect of all citizens, if you at the same time
withhold from those whom you deem so capable the
power of beneficently guarding the interests of the
states, and without which the states themselves
might at any time, if they did not become rebellious,
become at any rate wholly dissatisfied. It is not, wo
hope, all of us, to be the result of our labours that a
constitution will be framed the possible result of
which may, even in the far future, be a resort to
violence. It is upon harmony and good-will that
this constitution must be based, and the only way to
base it so is to protect individual state rights in such
a manner that there will be no suspicion, no distrust,
at any time harboured in the general work of legis-
lation by those who represent, in one body or the
other, the states which are not the most numerous,
and not yet the most advanced. Especially is it
necessary in the condition at which we have arrived.
When we consider that this is a state which is
as large, or almost as large in itself as the thirteen
states which formed the original American United
States; and when we consider the hugeness of the
individual state interests with which we have to deal,
caution in this respect is more incumbent upon us
than it ever was upon any body of legislators address-
ing themselves to a similar task. Now having, I
trust, made myself plain upon that, and having, I
hope, shown that unless there is something more
than a mere power of rejection of money measures in
the federal senate there is at any time a possibility
of a gormandising process being indulged in by the
representatives of states in the greatest numerical
superiority, I should like simply to pass on to express,
as w r e must all express, approval of the remainder of
the first sub-section, that is to say, the formation of
the house of representatives to be elected by districts
formed 011 a population basis, with the sole exception
that, instead of possessing the sole power of originat-
ing or amending all bills for raising revenue or
imposing taxation, they, in the exercise of their
power, or any serious portion of the exercise of it,
should have the assistance of the federal senate in
the highest form, at any rate, in a higher form than
my hon. friend, Mr. Deakin, seems ready to give it.
Now, with regard to the judiciary —and I hope that
now I have come near to the close of my remarks.
It is no use, I take it, our establishing a federal
supreme court, if it is to have merely the academical
functions of a court of appeal, if the term is admis-
sible. A federal supreme court must have power to
enforce its decrees in every way, Its process must
run throughout the length and breadth of the federal
states, and it must have power to enforce its
decrees against any individuals, just in the same
way as the supreme court of any of the existing
states has power to enforce its decrees against
any citizen therein, otherwise federal laws will lose


their sanction; because the executive, legislature,
and judiciary, constituting the three great arms o£
state if every one of them does not rest upon and
reach the individuality of each citizen, then, as far as
one of them falls short, the constitution will be
imperfect on one side. Therefore, the power of
reaching, and reaching in the strongest form and
way, the individual components of the states of
the federation must be as strongly reposed in the
federal judiciary as in either the executive or the
legislature ; and the wider the jurisdiction for neces-
sary purposes that is given to them the safer the
federation will be, because you are more likely to
preserve that harmonious working of the constitution
hy intrusting the interpretation of it to a tribunal
which will deal with the citizen in his individual
relations than you are to preserve it by leaving the
interpretation in the hands of those who may act as
between state and state, and who may provoke the
very kind of friction between community and com-
munity which it is our object to avoid. To make the
thing plainer—where it becomes necessary to construe
the validity of a statute, either the statute of pne of
the provinces, or where the statute of the federal
parliament may seem to impinge upon the state
statute itself—in either of those cases the safest
course is to trust to the interpretation of the federal
court, because by that means the interpretation by
individual cases is likely to meet with a more har-
monious acceptance than would be the result if
jealousy were provoked by endeavouring to settle it
as between state and state. Quoting from Munro’s
book on the “ Constitution of Canada,” at page
218, I find that there is cited a piece of legislation,
which, instead of taking the form, as it does, of a
separate act in Canada, might almost well be incor-
porated into our constitution as a provision binding
on all. Munro says
In the case of those provinces that passed a lawto such
effect, provision was made for conferring a special jurisdiction
on the supreme and exchequer courts in controversies be-
tween the dominion and a province, or between provinces, or
relating to the validity of provincial laws.
When the legislature of any province forming part of
Canada shall have passed an act agreed and providing that
the supreme court and exchequer court or the supreme court
alone shall have jurisdiction in any of the following cases:
(1.) Controversies between the Dominion of Canada and
such province.
(2.) Controversies between such province and any other
province or provinces which may have passed a like act.
The two following are the provisions to which I
more immediately refer: —
(3.) Suits, actions, or proceedings in which the parties
thereto by their pleadings shall have raised the ques-
tion of the validity of an act of the Parliament of
Canada when, in the opinion of the judge of the court in
which the same are pending, such question is material.
(4.) Suits, actions, or proceedings in which the parties
thereto by their pleadings shall have raised the ques-
tion of the validity of an act of the legislature of such
province when, in the opinion of the judge of the court
in which the same are pending, such question is
material, then this section of the act is to be in force
in the class of cases in respect of which such act may
have been passed.
In (1) and (2) the proceedings are to be in the court of
exchequer, with an appeal to the supreme court. In (3) and
(4) the judge who decides that the question is material is to
order the case to be removed into the supreme court for the
decision of such question.
And the decision of questions, I take it, by a high
tribunal possessing the confidence of all the citizens
of the federation will be much more likely to lead to
peace and goodwill among them than any decision
outside of it imposed as an over-burden upon the
legislative or executive arms of the state. 1 see that
it is proposed that this supreme court, this federal
judiciary, is to constitute a high court of appeal for
Australia, under the direct authority of the Sovereign,
whose decisions shall be final. It was well pointed
out by the mover of the resolutions that the endea-
vour to get rid of the jurisdiction of the Privy
Council for the Dominion of Canada was a fruitless
one, because the Imperial Government refused to
assent to such a transfer of power. Whether they
would assent to such a transfer of power now seems
very doubtful. By precedent, they would not; but I
do hope that the mere fact that the action of the
Imperial Government has in a previous case been
against the granting of any such power will not deter
the framers of this constitution from inserting pro-
visions which will claim the power. It may be re-
fused, and, if it is refused, the refusal may be pro-
vocative of more or less dissatisfaction; but that it
is a power to ask for, and a pow T er Avhich will be
beneficial when gained, I have not the remotest
doubt. Of course there may ho exceptions, as the
hon. member, Mr. Deakin, has so well pointed out,
in cases where Imperial interests are concerned, or in
cases —but I am more doubtful as regards following
his argument in this part of it —in cases where the
stability and uniformity of interpretation in matters
of common law may be endangered by not resorting
to the Privy Council. In the first case there may be
an exception, but with regard to all other cases, I
trust that this Convention, and the Parliaments to
whom its conclusions are to be presented, will use
their utmost efforts to secure the abolition of the.
jurisdiction of the Privy Council and the transfer of
supreme authority to the colonial judiciary, which I
am sure will be beneficial to the whole of the
colonies. I say this without attempting to derogate
from the authority of the Privy Council, but those
who have watched the course of its decisions are
aware that that tribunal is not always constituted in
its best aspect; that there are occasions when that
board —because it is a board —is presided over by
judges who, whether as regards their past judicial
career, or, at any rate in some cases, as regards their
existing capacity, would not be one whit superior, but
—I almost tremble to say it —are not equal to the class
of judges to be found in this continent to constitute
a federal supreme court. 1 feci no doubt at all that
from the ranks of the very eminent members of the
bar and of members of the amalgamated profession,
as probably it may be, in these colonies there is ample
material to be found for the constitution of a supreme
court of appeal to which no citizen of Australia need
fear to entrust the final adjudication of his claims,
and I feel equally sure that the institution of a change
such as this will be hailed wdth loud acclaim as one,
if not of the most valuble provisions in principle in
-the constitution, yet as one of the most beneficially
workable provisions which will accompany it. I have
to thank hon. members for having listened to me so
kindly, and before sitting down I should like to read
a few words which struck me on looking into a well-
known authority last night as to the advantage of a
federal union and the division of power. I find this
in Story’s “ Commentaries on the Constitution of the
United States,” section 291—a book, as I said, that
is of the highest authority, and I think the passage
is calculated to give a clear indication in a very few
words of the result that will follow upon the exercise
of proper caution in the maintenance, on the one
hand, of the executive, parliamentary, and judicial
strength of a general government within the powers
assigned to it, and on the other hand, the maintenance
of state rights in all matters which it is not considered
necessary to hand over to the federal authority.
If there were but one consolidated national government to
which the people might look up for protection and
support, they might in time relax that vigilance and
jealousy which seem so necessary to the wholesome
growth of republican institutions. If, on the other
hand, the state governments could engross all the
affections of the people, to the exclusion of the national
government, by their familiar and domestic regulations,
there would be danger that the union, constantly
weakened by the distance and discouragements of its
functionaries, might at last become as it was under
the federation —a mere show, if not a mockery, of
sovereignty. So that this very division of empire may


in the end, by the blessing of Providence, be the means
of perpetuating our rights and liberties by keeping
alive in every state at once a sincere love of its own
government and a love of the union, and by cherishing
in different minds a jealousy of each which shall check
as well as enlighten public opinion.
As to the executive, I must say that the question
raised by Sir Samuel Griffith has given me, for one,
considerable perturbation. I know that it is very
easy to pooh-pooh the whole matter and to say, “You
must look to the representative chamber, and that
alone as the seat of ministerial responsibility”; but, as I
venture to think, I have shown that we do not rind,
or shall not find, in a properly constituted federalbody,
the representation all collocated in one chamber; and
if we do not find it there, that admission places us at
once in face of the difficulty which Sir Samuel
Griffith has suggested, and I am afraid that it is a
difficulty very hard to solve. But British communities
have been in the habit of solving difficulties some-
times by anomalous means ; and, where they have
had to make a choice, they have made it sometimes
not altogether in accordance with principle, and have
been rewarded for their pains by the very beneficial
working of their constitutions. Now, let us endeavour
to get at some solution in this way. Is it certain
that the question of legislative power and the question
of ministerial responsibility rest on the same lines ?
It is quite clear that where it may be necessary to
embody even the representative principle in two
chambers for the exercise of legislative power it
is unfair or unjust to intrust the working of
the constitutional principle—the principle of minis-
terial responsibility—to one chamber alone ? I am
afraid we shall have to solve this difficulty by making
the executive of the dominion responsible to the cham-
ber called the representative chamber—to that one
which has not the custody of state rights specifically
within its control. One reason why I am led to con-
clude that this w r ould not be a dangerous result is the
remark Avhich fell from my hon. friend, Mr. Playford,
yesterday. He said, if I understood him correctly,
that we should not find it possible to graft on the
American system the system of responsible govern-
ment, and make it work. Well, I think that by
allowing the operation of the principle of respon-
sible Government to rest in the responsibility of
the executive of the day to the house of repre-
sentatives, we shall, at any rate, be able to
make the constitution work. Although it may be
impossible at the present stage to suggest any better
provision, I must confess that I am not in love with
the solution that has been suggested, that a proportion
of the ministry of the day should retire upon the
vote of one house, or of both, and that the others
should remain in office.
Sir Samuel Griffith : That is not proposed by
any one!
Mr. Munro : Suggested !
Mr. BARTON: I am not sure that it was not
proposed, but at any rate it struck me that it had
been suggested.
Sir Samuel Griffith : As a possible working
out in time!
Mr. BARTON: As a possible working out in
time. I do admit that there is a great deal of force
in the suggestion that there are certain phases of
constitutional development which, to a great extent,
must be left to the working— to that which express
provisions will evolve from themselves, rather than to
attempt to define them too strictly at the outset; but I
fail to see how the working of any such constitution as
is likely to be framed will result in a limited minis-
terial responsibility of that kind. I take it that we
shall be shut up to the choice of one of two things, the
American system of dissociation of the executive, or
the adhering to that which we individually have
found to work as well as anything else can work in
the present stage of political development—that is,
the ordinary principle of constitutional government,
In that respect I think that, irrespective of any ques-
tion of a referendum, which I have heard suggested,
Ave shall find ourselves safer in relying on the old
lines of constitutional responsibility at the hands of
one chamber, although it may not take unto itself the
whole of the representative principle, than Ave shall
be by attempting either to weld Wo chambers to-
gether for executive purposes —which I think would
be a clumsy expedient —or by venturing upon the
dissociation of the executive from the representative
body, the segregation of Ministers from Parliament,
resulting, as Ave know it has resulted elsewhere, in a
body of Ministers not possessing indeed the Avhole
executive power, and Avhose AA'orking is hampered to
this extent: that, being individually amenable to a
President, they are only in the very slightest degree
animated by a common policy so far as regards their
common action. That is a state of things Avhich I
do not think would conduce to good government,
and I therefore think, notwithstanding the embodi-
ment of the federal principle in our second chamber,
notwithstanding the embodiment of a proportion of
the representation of the country in it, we must give
up the idea that we are to dissociate our executive from
our Parliament. We shall be much safer in taking our
stand upon the solid constitutional ground of responsi-
bility to one house alone. And there is a reason for it
in this case to be found in this way : that the cham-
ber to which it is proposed that ministers should be
responsible, is that chamber which is most charged
with the conserATition of the general rights of which
the executive is the exponent: that is to say, viewing
the federal executive in its distinction from the
A r arious executives of the provinces, the chamber
Avhich has most to do Avith the conservation of the
poAvers and functions of that executive, and within
the lines of Avhich it will oftenest act in its relation
to the indiAuduals of the state, will be the house of
representatives; and if we work upon that line, I
think Ave shall find it to be, perhaps, by no very great
stretch of principle, a decided gain in the working of
our political system, and Ave shall find it possible to
conserve the principle of ministerial responsibility,
and responsibility to that house alone. I again thank
hon. members for the kindness Avith which they have
heard me. I hope, as I promised, that I have not
w r andered from the point, and that I have not w r earied
by repetition. I have ventured to address myself to
this subject because I think that, after all, no one
can be blamed, however young he may be in so
august an assembly as this, for bringing into the
common stock his ideas and reasons, where the
interests of his country and the interests of the very
much greater country which he hopes to make his
own are so much concerned. I hope that lam at
any rate acting in the spirit in Avhich we all labour
together, and that the result of our labour will be
to found a state of high and august aims, w r orking by
the eternal principles of justice and not to the music
of bullets, and affording an example of freedom,
political morality, and just action to the individual,
the state and the nation Avhich will one day be the
envy of the world.
Sir JOHN DOWNER : I am sure we all appre-
ciate the modesty which has led the hon. gentleman
Avho has just sat doAvn to apologise for Avhat he called
his presumption in moving the adjournment of the
debate yesterday and in resuming it to-day. I
believe the feeling of every hon. member present,
whether the views of the hon. gentleman do or do not
happen to precisely coincide with his own, is to join
in congratulating him on having made a speech Avhich
will be of very great serxdce to us in this discussion—
a speech most admirably conceived, most logical in its
construction, and one which, as it to a large extent
falls in Avith my own vieAvs, not unnaturally carries
the greatest conviction to my mind. Sir, the hon.
gentleman devoted himself, during the greater part


of his address, to the discussion of the question
raised in your resolutions, and developed greatly in
that most able speech which w r e heard from my hon.
friend, Mr. Dcakin, as to the power of veto to be
lodged in the senate. It occurred to me at the time
the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, was speaking, that we
could scarcely carry out his wishes without, in so
doing, negativing the very first branch of your resolu-
tions. It appears to me that the “ powers and
privileges and territorial rights of the several existing
colonies ” cannot remain intact if the people’s will,
as defined by that hon. gentleman, is to be supreme,
and if the colonies, as a whole, are to be coerced by
the individual votes of the inhabitants of the whole.
We are sent here, all of us I think, under practically
the same conditions. We are directed to endeavour
to frame a constitution which will bring about union
between the Australian colonies ; but we are also
directed, in doing that, to take care that that con-
stitution is based on terms just to the several colonies.
That, sir, of course, is a sentiment which will, I am
sure, run through the intentions, although it may
sometimes fail in the expression, of every hon. dele-
gate, and it is one 'which, I fear, would be entirely
outraged if this resolution w r ere carried without the
qualification indicated by the hon. member, Sir
Samuel Griffith. Sir, as we all know, we are not
altogether without precedent and experience in this
matter; we are not embarking altogether on an
unknown sea. We have the experience of a great
republic before us. We have that constitution which
was framed by some of the most eminent men living
at that time—framed, sir, not in any hot impetuosity,
but after mature deliberation. We have not only
that before us, but we have also seen the working of
it now for upwards of 100 years. We have seen that
whatever doubts there may be as to the working of
some portion of the constitution, the general verdict
of mankind as to the value of the general articles has
been entirely in their favour. We know, too, the
difficulties which met the able gentlemen who drafted
those articles in the very inception. We know that
this same question, about which my hon. friend feels
so strongly, and without which he thinks this federa-
tion is impracticable, was discussed amongst the
states represented at that convention, and discussed
from identically the same stand-point as this question
must be discussed here. We know that the states
insisted on union, but objected to unity ; that they
wished a federation of independent states, but not an
amalgamation into one empire; and we know, too,
that the representatives of that convention were
equally divided, and it was only by resorting to a
committee that the difficulty was finally overcome.
And, sir, the difficulty was got over in precisely the
manner which the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith,
suggests should be resorted to here, by recognising
in one branch of the legislature the states, and by
recognising in another branch of the legislature
individual members of the whole community of
states, and giving both those houses, each of which,
in its own position, was absolutety necessary to the
preservation of the autonomy of the individual
states, jurisdiction which was practically co-ordinate.
I say practically co-ordinate, because, in one par-
ticular, and in one particular only, the jurisdiction
was not so, and that w r as in the right to introduce
money bills. But that convention finally agreed in
going further than my hon. friend, Sir Samuel
Griffith, wishes to go now, and not merely gave the
senate the power of vetoing either wholly or in part
money bills sent up from the house of representatives,
but gave them a general power of amending any bills
which should be sent to them. Without this agree-
ment the United States of America would not have
been constituted, at that time at all events ; and
under that agreement the states have progressed to
™ position which they have now attained, and
although, as in every constitution, difficulties, jars,
and discords will exist, still, on the whole, the jars
and discords there have not been appreciably greater
than those in the constitutional governments to which
we are accustomed. No objection has ever been very
seriously made by any large body of people, or, I
would rather say, by the people generally, to the co-
ordinate authority reposed in the senate, or to the
method in which that authority has been exercised.
There w r as then a greater disproportion, or as great,
at all events, between the populations of the largest
and smallest of those states as there is now between
the populations of the largest and the smallest of the
Australian states proposing to federate. Neverthe-
less, equal representation, co-ordinate legislative
authority, was given to the smallest as to the largest.
Experience has shown us that that has worked tho-
roughly "well, and has proved as satisfactory to the
larger populations—to the states containing the
largest populations, one of which, I think, sends forty
representatives to the house of representatives, whilst
another sends only one—as to the smaller populations
upon whom co-ordinate power was conferred. Ido
not intend, even if I could, and I could not if I
wished it, to go over the arguments so closely and
logically put by the hon. gentleman who has just sat
down. 1 say that, if I wished to do it, I have not
the power, and I am certain that everyone here, what-
ever his views on the ultimate question, must have
been profoundly impressed by the manner in which
the hon. gentleman submitted and stated his argu-
ments. I should be sorry to be supposed to be ex-
pressing my own concluded opinions, because we are
met here for deliberation ; but whilst I think, at the
present at all events, that it would be impossible to
establish this federation at all, and certainly not
in a satisfactory way, without the point raised
by the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, being
at least conceded, still, when we have settled that
question, of course we are not out of our troubles,
because there is more to be looked at. If w r e do
agree, as I think we must, that the two houses shall
have co-ordinate legislative authority, and that it shall
be competent for the senate at least to do vbat the
hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, suggests—to veto
in detail any bills sent up to them, whether money
bills or not, still we have got the further difficulty to
settle, as to how the executive is to be constituted.
I cannot say that I have quite come to the same con-
clusion as that of the last speaker on this subject.
Although some of us are Australians by birth, all of
us have had English traditions handed down to us,
and have a natural prejudice in favour of the methods
of government in the country from which we sprang.
At the same time we must recollect, as the hon. member,
Sir Samuel Griffith, said, that we are considering some-
thing about which the mother country's laws know
nothing, something quite outside the ordinary orbit
of imperial concerns, and it may be that we may, in
framing our constitution, find it impossible to work this
new federation properly unless we strike out on some
new lines. The proposal in the resolution before us
is that the executive should be responsible to the
house of representatives, and liable to be removed on
the vote of the majority of the members of that
house. While the hon. member, Mr. Barton, tells
us that he sees difficulties in carrying out that pro-
posal, and feels the difficulties which the hon.
member, Sir Samuel Griffith, suggests, he neverthe-
less appeared to conclude that that is about the only
method Avhich w r e can expect to work satisfactorily.
But I would ask the hon. gentleman, with his strong
views in support of the authority of the senate, with
his convictions that to preserve the authority of the
senate is at least as important as to preserve the
authority of the house of representatives, does he
think that that authority can be preserved intact, and
will not inevitably gradually be frittered away, if the
government of the country is comprised in a body
selected exclusively from the other branch of the legis*


lature, and responsible only to them ? "What weakens
responsible government ? The upper branches of
the legislature, be it the House of Lords or the
legislative councils of the different colonies, have, so
far as either common law or written law is concerned,
authority almost co-ordinate with that of the Commons
or the assembly. It is the practice of the community,
superadded to the law, which has gradually deprived
the upper branches of their authority, and neither
common law nor statutory maxim is responsible for
the encroachment which has taken place. Now, sir,
supposing we make the executive responsible to the
house of representatives only, can we doubt for a
moment, by analogy from what has happened in the
past, that we shall see in the future the authority of
the senate gradually dwindling until it becomes a
body that is practically, if not absolutely, subject to
the house of representatives P This is really the
difficulty of the situation. The difficulty in reference
to the executive is greater than the difficulty as to
the precise constitution of the two houses ; and my
strong opinion, at present at all events, is that it will
be absolutely impossible to preserve the rights and
privileges of the house representing the colonies, if
the government is solely responsible to the house
which represents the individual electors. The repre-
sentatives, say of the two colonies of New South
Wales and Victoria, would probably represent the
proportion of eight to three, compared with the other
colonies ; and the result undoubtedly would be that,
supposing these great colonies, settling their ancient
feuds, and with the customs barrier removed, which
I thiuk has alone kept them apart, and made them
unfriendly, happened to come into sweet concord
once in a way, we might expect the result to be that
the executive would be selected exclusively from
these colonies, and that the minor colonies would
have very little voice in the government of the
dominion at all. It seems to me quite impossible to
conceive the privileges of the one house being
retained if the executive authority is entirely reposed
in the other. Then, sir, what is to be done P
There, of course, comes the difficulty. The method
adopted in Switzerland might be resorted to. The
two houses might meet as one —the senate and the
house of representatives—and appoint their ministry,
who should retain office—there it is for three years —
for a time to be determined. That would be a
government which would have the confidence of the
house, not responsible in the ordinary sense, and it
would impinge upon our English notions to that extent;
but still, I think, a government much more consistent
with the federation which is to be brought about than a
government which can only properly exist under an
empire. I take it that in these matters we are all
striving for the same end, that we are not neces-
sarily obstinately pledged to any particular view which
may be expressed upon this introductory motion, but
simply endeavouring to assist each other in arriving
at a conclusion that may bring about the federation
which we all desire to see attained. As to the federal
judiciary, I will just say that I entirely agree with
the views of the hon. and learned member, Mr.
Barton. I think that, for the federal constitution to
work well, there must be a strong judiciary. That
has been the experience of America; in fact, the
Union could not have worked there "without the
assistance which from time to time it has received
from the judicial bench ; and the stronger and more
powerful the judicial bench, the stronger and better
will the union be. So far as my experience as a pro-
fessional man is concerned, it agrees with the
experience of the professional men of other colonies,
which is that there is no necessity at all for appeals
to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, not
merely on the ground that was gently hinted at by
the hon. and learned member, Mr. Barton, namely,
that the constitution of that tribunal was not always
as s&tistactorv as it might be, but also because, in the
first place, we think that justice should be speedy;
in the next place, that we are satisfied with our own
tribunals, or we will be when we have a federal
judiciary, and, in the last place, where any appeal
would be required from a tribunal of such high emi-
nence as the federal supreme court, the question as
to the right or the wrong of the matter would practi-
cally have come to so fine a point as probably to bo
almost a question of temperament as to which way
the case would be decided. But, if we wish to make
Australia self-sufficing, one of the first things which
I think we must insist xipon is having our final
judiciary here. Ido not say this without any limita-
tion. I agree with the limitation that the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. Deakin, mentioned. When imperial ques-
tions arise her Majesty must have some supervising
authority; but so far as the other matter to which
the hon. gentleman referred is concerned —as regards
any important common law questions—l think that
the Supreme Court and our federal judiciary will be
quite competent to settle those, and I am not aware
of any reason which makes it imperative that the
decisions here and the decisions in the old country
should always follow on precisely the same lines. So
far as your resolutions, sir, generally are concerned,
I agree with them. I agree that the border custom-
houses must be removed; but I also agree with what
is the general understanding throughout, at all events,
a large majority of the Australian colonies, namely,
that whilst intercolonial free-trade is to be permitted,
it is on the condition that for a time, at all events,
there shall be protection against the outside world.
Without that limitation and understanding—whether
the understanding be expressed or not is another
question —the Australian colonies will certainly not
be federated at the present time; and I think that it
would be a good thing to fix some date when this
intercolonial free-trade should begin, and to allow
each colony meanwhile to collect its duties in its own
way. Of course time has to elapse, and probably a
good deal of time, before any legislative effect can be
given to our consultations here; but, I think, never-
theless, that it would be satisfactory to most of the
colonies —to all the colonies which have adopted
protective duties—if a date were fixed in the constitu-
tion when this new law should take effect. When
we go into Committee we shall all of us no doubt
have many opportunities of expressing our opinions
on the different questions that arise. I simply have
endeavoured, sir, to imitate your brevity in addressing
myself as concisely as I could to the principal points
contained in your resolutions, and particularly taking
the opportunity of expressing my opinion as to what
I consider the crucial point of all, which is, that so
far as the constitution of the senate is concerned we
must follow the precedent of America, and, whilst
showing every respect to the views of individuals as
represented in the house of representatives, we must still
take care that the views of the states shall be studied
in an equal degree in the representation of the senate.
Mr.THYNNE: As there appears to be considerable
hesitation on the part of older members of the Con-
vention in continuing the debate, and as we have a
little time before the usual hour for adjournment, I
propose to claim your attention for a few minutes.
I think I may be pardoned if I point out what appears
to me to be a misapprehension of the views which
the hon. and learned member, Sir Samuel Griffith,
expressed in connection with the matter of the execu-
tive. It seems that the discussion has proceeded
upon the idea that the hon. and learned member, Sir
Samuel Griffith, in his speech advocated an immediate
change from the present relation of responsibility of
the executive to the popular house. I understood
that hon. and learned gentleman not to support that
view, but to recommend that the Constitution should
be left open for such developments in government in
these colonies in future years as the circumstances of
the times may require.


Sir Samuel Geiffith : Hear, hear!
Mr. THTNHE: I think, sir, that it would be very
unwise for us to impose any fetter that is not abso-
lutely necessary upon the free and full development
of the future Constitution which may be in force in
these colonies. The function that we have to fulfil
in meeting in this Convention is that of framing a
Federal Constitution. We are asked to now advise
the parliaments of the colonies, and also to advise the
Imperial Parliament —for its assistance will probably
be required in bringing federation into being—as to
the best mode of initiating a federal government in
these colonies. I think that under the terms of the
resolutions that have been passed by all the parlia-
ments any general arguments in favour of federation
are now quite out of place. We may assume that it
is our duty to avoid considering that question, for it
has been settled by the authorities that sent us here,
and we ought to devote ourselves immediately and
seriously to the work of framing a Constitution which
we hope will prove acceptable, because it will be just
to the different colonies. I wish to make a few
remarks upon the work which we have to do in this
Convention. In the first place, in framing a Consti-
tution, we are called upon to assist in putting the
highest stone upon the great edifice of the political
development of these colonies. That development
has proceeded from very small beginnings, namely,
in the first instance from a military garrison in a
Crown colony governing not only people subject
to servitude, but also a small proportion of tree
settlers, until it has now expanded into colonies with
certain limited powers of self-government, but still
dependencies of the British Parliament and the
British people. I was surprised to hear from two
such well-known statesmen in these colonies as the
two hon. gentlemen from Victoria who have spoken,
that they have been under the impression so long
that these colonies enjoyed the privilege of respon-
sible government. It is an old saying that “ a
prophet is without honor in his own country,” and it
seems to me that that proverb applies to the colony
of Victoria as well as to other places. Some years
ago I had the privilege of reading a book written by
a most distinguished Victorian, in which this question
is dealt with, and the words which he made use of at
that time have remained engraven on my memory
ever since. I think they are words which must never
be forgotten by the people of these colonies until
such time as the responsible government which he
defines in his work is attained. Professor Hearn’s
definition of responsible government is :
Where a legislature is established, and a promise is made by
the Crown of the exercise of the prerogative exclusively by the
advice of ministers having the confidence of Parliament.
That is a complete and satisfactory definition of the
system of responsible government, and I think that
no one can for a moment be under the impression
that in Australia up to the present time we have been
able to claim that full measure of responsible govern-
ment. The Crown, in the exercise of its prerogative
in connection with many Australian matters —matters
even of internal interest in Australia, matters of
social interest in Australia—has exercised its pre-
rogative, not by the advice of Australian ministers,
but by the advice of ministers responsible to the
people in Great Britain and Ireland, through the
parliament representing them. I think that the work
in which we are engaged in framing a federal constitu-
tion directly involves the assumption in these colonies
of that complete measure of responsible government.
The Crown, in all matters relating to Australian
interests, must exercise its prerogative exclusively by
the advice of Australian ministers —the veto to which
my hon. friend, Mr. Playford, referred must be
exercised, not by the advice of ministers in other
parts of the world, but by the advice of ministers who
are charged with Australian interests. It seems to
me that in some portions of the discussion that has
taken place, the object or meaning of federation or a
federal constitution has been, to some extent, lost
sight of. The union of these colonies must take place
in either one or two ways, namely, either by a unifi-
cation under one all-powerful parliament, or by a
federation which gives to the central federal parlia-
ment certain limited powers and reserves to the other
parliaments all other powers. As I think we may be
in danger of overlooking some of the first principles
connected with federation, I may be pardoned if I
briefly define some of the characteristics of a federa-
tion. I shall quote from Mr. Dicey’s recent work,
which is very clear in its language. He says :
One of the characteristics of a federation is that the law of
the constitution must be either legally immutable or else
capable of being changed only by some authority above and
beyond the ordinary legislative bodies, whether federated or
state legislatures, existing under the constitution.
That opens up a matter of very large consideration
for this Convention. In the first place, what is the
authority above and beyond the legislatures which is
to have the power of changing the law of the con-
stitution', or of regulating it in any form ? The
answer, of course, is that it is the people of these
colonies who are to be charged with that important
function, and I would therefore point out—and I
think several hon. members who have had consider-
able experience in leading what may be called demo-
cratic parties in these colonies have forgotten for a
moment —what the democracy of Australia is to be.
It seems to me that some of the sentiments that have
been expressed here are the sentiments of gentlemen
who are so fresh from the struggle which they have
been engaged in recently, in connection with the
privileges of the people in the particular colonies,
that they have forgotten what will be the position of
the democracy of Australia when this federation is
completed. The constitution of this federation will
not be charged with the duty of resisting privileged
classes, for the whole power will be vested in the people
themselves. They are the complete legislative power
of the whole of these colonies, and they shall be so.
From them will rise, first of all, the federal constitution
which we are proposing to establish, and in the next
place will come the legislative powers of the several
colonies. The people will be the authority above and
beyond the separate legislatures, and the royal pre-
rogative exercised, in their interest and for their
benefit, by the advice of their ministers will bo
practically vested in them. They will exercise the
. sovereignty of the states, they will be charged with
the full power and dignity of the state, and it is from
them that we must seek the giving to each of those
bodies that will be in existence concurrently the
necessary powers for their proper management and
existence. Each assembly, each legislature, whether
state or federal existing under this constitution, will
be as Dicey again says —a merely subordinate law-
making body whose laws will be valid, whilst within
the authority conferred upon it by the constitution,
but invalid and unconstitutional if they go beyond
the limits of such authority. These are two neces-
sary consequences of every form of federal govern-
ment, and this Convention must address itself
seriously to the work of devising such a constitution
as will preserve these two principles in their full
operation. I think that the power of the people
which is involved by the considerations I have men-
tioned is such as will put in the shade all those
sentiments and ideas with which notably the speech
of Mr. Deakin was charged with regard to the danger
of the want of popular power in the new state. It
seems to me that the democracy which he would like
to see would be insecure and unsteady, and without
those guards against the tyrannic exercise of the
power of temporary majorities which are necessary
to the peaceful government and continuance of every
state in the world. The democracy lam anxious to
see, and which I am sure we are all anxious to see,


would be at the same time calm and secure, without
any danger of sudden revolution, without any fear of
an invasion of its ordinary rights and privileges on
iho part of any class of people in the community,
ll is*for that reason that I am so anxious to see that
what have been called state rights and the rights of
minorities are guarded in the new Constitution against
hasty, corrupt, or dishonest action on a part of any
section, no matter how large it may be, in the new
slate. Unless the senate be charged with sufficient
power to protect the people of the federation against
hasty and ill-considered legislation, the union consum-
mated will be a weak and vacillating one, which will
not inspire confidence either among our own subjects
or among the peoples of the world with whom our
government will have to deal. There must be some
continuity, there must be some security against fickle-
ness, some guarantee that petulant changes will not be
made either in the policy of the state or in its internal
legislation. Eor these reasons, I think it is essential
that the senate should be invested with a large amount
of power, in fact, with powers almost co-ordinate with
those or the house of representatives, as proposed
under these resolutions. In no case in the world’s
history will it be found that a federal institution has
been successful otherwise. In no case have the
stronger democracies of the world dispensed with
those necessary safeguards of state rights and
individual rights—those provisions for the proper
conservation of the public policy of the country. I
think the resolutions proposed by you, sir, in so far
as they are in the direction of limiting the powers of
the senate, do not go in the right direction, and I
trust that in Committee we shall see our way to make
a very necessary amendment in that respect. I have
perhaps needlessly offered my arguments upon this
subject, because, excepting by the speech of the hon.
delegate from Victoria, Mr. Deakin, I do not think
the position taken up by Sir Samuel Grifiith has
been seriously challenged by any member of the
Convention.
Mr. Bird .- Yes, by Mr. Munro!
Mr, THYNNE : At all events by not more than
two, and the arguments offered already in response
to the views of those gentlemen have been so strong
that it was perhaps almost unnecessary for me to
allude to the subject. However, I thought those
pregnant words of Professor Hearn, and their appli-
cation in the present instance, might, with utility, be
brought under the notice of the Convention. There
is one other phase of the subject to which I think no
allusion has yet been made. It is a provision which
I think would add very much indeed to the weight
and influence of the resolutions if it were introduced
hereafter in Committee. I think these resolutions
would be much embellished and improved did they
contain a provision which would establish the rmht
or the people of the colonies to pass not only the
proposed Constitution, but to have all future amend-
ments of it submitted to their direct vote for approval.
T hat is a thoroughly democratic system, by which the
people are guarded against hasty and ill-considered
t ranges of the Constitution; and the suggestion '
winch I make is one which, I think, might fairly
xeceive from gentlemen who will follow me a little
consideration. It has already been suggested that *
the introduction of the referendum would be a very ]
useful thing. I am not now prepared to fully discuss 1
that question. It would take me a long time to \
elaborate it; but I do think that, whether we do or
do not at any future time introduce the referendum,
as in Switzerland, in its application to all legislation 5 8
we may very well, and with great advantage, adopt °
iiat particular portion of it which deals with consti- a
tuhonal changes. It is in accordance with the theory 11
which I put forward, of the people being the great
power—really the sovereign power—in these states h
that before the Crown is asked to give its assent to ii
any legislation making changes in the Constitution, f<
it the people themselves should be asked to give their
)f sanction to it. There is one other subject in con-
n nection with these resolutions, to which I will very
T. shortly refer. It seems to me that the executive, as
d proposed in these resolutions, is liable to become the
d creature of the populous colonies. We must guard
it against that. U nless we desire to postpone federation
Y indefinitely, we must consider the institutions with
v which we have to deal. We have to consult them;
t we are asking for a surrender of power on the part
t of the different legislatures, and we have to reckon
- with them with regard to the quid pro quo they are
1 to receive for that surrender. Unless they have some
s evidence that there is a thorough and complete
r intention to deal fairly and evenly with all of the
a colonies, whether large in population or not, I think
- those with large populations will be as ready to reject
3 our work as those with small ones. There is one
I other element which has been suggested to me by the
paragraph of the resolutions with reference to
t military and nayal defences. I think we shall do a
f useful work, that we shall do a good thing, by making
1 it a part of the Constitution of Australia that in time
s of war every man in it shall be liable to be called
i upon to undergo military service. I think that would
' J? e a great step in advance—a step that would secure
for us the active interest and support of all the people
in these colonies ; and I am sure w'e cannot afford to
disown or to disregard any one of those sources of influ-
ence we ought to exercise upon the people. I have to
thank hon. members of the Convention for the patient
hearing they have given me. In taking advantage of
this opportunity to express a few ideas upon this sub-
ject, I trust I have made some slight contribution to
the debate; and I hope that in later discussions
which will undoubtedly take place in Committee on
each of the different proposals, we shall have as
instructive a debate as we have had from those
hon. members who have preceded me upon this ques-
tion. 1
ADDRESSES.
The President : I have to announce to the Con-
vention the receipt of the following letter from the
Wesleyan Conference :—
Sydney, 5th March, 1891.
The Secretary, the Federation Convention.
Sir,
The conference lias prepared an address to the Conven-
tion, and the Revs. A. J. Webb and John Gardiner have been
appointed to present it.
Would you please be so good as to obtain for us the informa-
tion as to when we may present it. I have, &c.,
Arthur J, Webb.
I propose instructing the secretary to inform these
gentlemen that the Convention will receive their
address at 11 o’clock on Monday, unless that course
be disapproved of.
Sir JOHN BRAT: Before that is done, I desire to
call attention to this fact: that provision has been
made for the proceedings of the Convention beino-
governed by the standing orders of the House of
Commons. I understand, therefore, that it will be
necessary that any address should be presented by a
member of the Convention. The question arises, is it
desirable to permit the presentation of addresses in
tire way suggested ? We are all deeply indebted to
the Wesleyan Conference for their address, and we
shall be glad to receive it; but 1 think we ought to
consider whether it should not be presented through
a member of the Convention in the ordinary parlia-
mentary way. 1
The President : Since the views expressed by the
hon. gentlemen appeared to be generally concurred
m, I will instruct the secretary to inform the con-
ference of the proper course of procedure.


The secretary read the following telegrams :
The Australian Natives’ Association of Victoria sends
greetings to the Federation Convention, and trusts that its
labours will result in a real and permanent step being taken
towards an early establishment of Australian federation.
The president and members of the council of the Victorian
Chamber of Manufactures congratulate the president and
delegates of the Australian colonies upon having to-day
assembled in conference at Sydney for the purpose of drafting
an Australian constitution, and fervently pray that their
labours may be guided by wisdom and patriotism, and result
in the adoption of a federal constitution which will prove ac-
ceptable to the whole of the peoples of Australia, and may
God save the Queen.
Victorian Manufacturers recommend free-trade through-
out Australasia, also free-trade with Great Britain for all
goods not produced or made in Australasia, except alcoholic
liquors.
The Federated Builders and Contractors Association of
Australasia congratulates the Federation Convention on hav-
ing laid the foundation of Australian national unity, and
trusts that the structure built on it during the remaining
days of the Convention will be of a solid and enduring
character, and satisfactory to the whole of the Australian
people.
FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.
THIRD day’s debate resumed.
Mr. RAKER : I move :
That the debate bo now adjourned until 2 o’clock.
It will be observed that I have named 2, instead of
half-past, as heretofore.
lion. Members : Commence from Monday !
Mr. Gillies : Some hon. members may have made
appointments on the strength of the practice of ad-
journing until half past 2.
The President : It is not necessary that any
motion should be made. I intimate that I will leave
the chair now and resume it at 2 o’clock.
Mr. FitzGerald : Some hon. members have made
engagements for to-day. Commence the new hour
on Monday.
The President : Then I will leave the chair until
half-past 2 o’clock.
Mr. BAKER: I am extremely obliged to hon.
members for greeting me in the cordial way they
have done. I take it to be a mark of appreciation
of what I have done in the way of providing
them with information and enabling them to take
practically the first step towards, as Aristotle
says, successful investigation by asking the right
question. I intend to follow the example of those
members who have been as brief as possible in their
remarks and have not -wandered away from the
resolutions placed before them. It will be sufficient,
it seems to me, to discuss matters which are not
included within this paper when they are submitted
to us. We undoubtedly shall have to discuss a great
many questions other than those which are embraced
in these resolutions, and I think I shall be meeting
the wishes of this assembly if I confine myself as
strictly as possible to the great questions which are
involved in the resolutions on the paper. I am
exceedingly obliged to the hon. members who have
preceded me for the very talented and able speeches
they have delivered, because they enable me to
confine my remarks within a very small compass. I
do not wish to reiterate arguments which have been
put forward ten times more forcibly, clearly, and
logically than I can put them, and although I hope
that I may be able to make some supplementary
remarks, 1 can assure hon. gentlemen that I do not
wish to take up the time of the Convention by any
vain repetition. The first resolution contains two
words which have been alluded to only once, I think,
during this debate. Those two words are “ territorial
rights. The resolution lays it down that the
territorial rights of the several existing colonies shall
i emain intact. Now, those two words seem to me
to bo more pregnant with meaning than would at
first appear. I have heard it stated outside —in fact
I have seen it in print —that one of the objects of the
proposed federation was to take away from some of
the states —for I suppose I may now call them states
—which have large unsold territories those unsold
territories, in order that the proceeds may be
placed in the common fund. Now lam glad that we
can give a direct negative to that at the first starting
of our discussion. But these words appear to me
to carry with them a fundamental principle. If all
the existing states are to retain the whole of their
territory, it seems to me that we shall be laying down
a principle which I hope will be rigidly adhered to,
of separating by as salient and distinct a line as
possible all federal finance from provincial finance.
We know that the different states have borrowed
various amounts —amounts which in some cases come
up to £6O per head, and in others are as low as £2O
per head, and it seems to me to follow, that if all the
unsold lands of each state are to continue to belong
to that state it will be unfair for the federal govern-
ment to assume the liabilities of the several provinces.
If we are going to make a common fund we must
make a common fund of everything; but if each state
is going to retain its unsold land, it seems to me to
follow that we shall do what was done in the United
States when they first framed their constitution. In
that country they did not mix up their federal finance
in any way whatever with their provincial finance.
The two things were as separate and distinct as pos-
sible. I will admit that we cannot, perhaps, altogether
refrain from taking over some of the public works of
the colonies, and consequently paying for them. If,
as the hon. member, Mr. Playford, remarked the other
day we are to assume possession of all the ships,
arsenals, and post-offices belonging to the different
states, these will have to be paid for by the federal
government, either in cash or by assuming the respon-
sibility for an equivalent amount of states debt.
That we must do no doubt; but further than that I
hope we will not go. History has shown us that of
all questions none are so pregnant with quarrels and
jealousies as that of finance. If we once commence
as a federal government to mix up federal finance
with state finance, we shall inevitably arrive at the
result which has followed in Canada, where the
greatest friction and the greatest jealousies and con-
tentions have arisen between the Dominion Govern-
ment and the provincial governments on this very
question as to whether one state has, or has not,
received an undue amount of federal money. As
Mr. Goldwin Smith says, the Dominion of Canada
is held together by what is euphemistically defined
as " better terms " —that is, each province of the
Dominion of Canada is constantly trying to get the
better of its neighbours, trying to obtain more from
the federal government; and lam afraid that the
authors of the Canadian federation, in mixing up
federal finance with provincial finance have laid the
seeds of the dissolution of that union. The second
question involved in resolutions 2 and 3 seems to be
unanimously conceded, and I shall only say a word
or two in reference to the remarks of the hon.
member, Mr. Deakin, on this point. That hon. gen-
tleman, as a representative of the great colony of
Victoria, does not wish, I understand, to postpone
the power of the federal government to alter the
tariffs of the different states ; but he wishes to cur-
tail that power by enacting in the federal constitu-
tion that although in any particular colony they may
increase the tariff, they cannot diminish it, except in
pursuance of limitations fixed and defined in the
federal constitution. At least Iso understood him.
Another aspect of the case was put by a subsequent
speaker, the hon. member who wished us to consider
the question -whether it would not be advisable to fix
a definite date, and to say that up to that date all
the present tariffs should continue in existence, to be
collected, I presume, by the federal government, or


collected by the states governments and handed over,
and that up to that date the federal legislature should
have no power in the matter. Both these proposals
are advocated with the same object in view, namely,
to protect people who, acting under the law of the
land, have invested large sums of money in establish -
ing manufactories, trades, and industries which would
be seriously crippled and imperilled if the tariff were
suddenly lowered, and the protective duties which
now exist suddenly done away with. I admit there
is very great force in the argument, and it ought to
be carefully considered; but I am somewhat aston-
ished to find it come from one of the delegates from
Victoria. We, in our small colony, consider, whether
rightly or wrongly, and have considered for some
time, that Victoria is eager for larger markets, that
having, as we all admit, obtained the start of us in
her manufactories, and having outrun her home
market, she desires to obtain markets in the other
colonies for her productions ; and we look upon it
that one of the prices which we are to pay for this
boon of federation is to allow Victoria to obtain this
advantage. But L was rather astonished that the
hon. member. Mr. Deakin, should be the first to
bring forward that view of the case. How r ever, it
does not matter very much who brings it forward. I
admit there is great force in it, and I admit that
either in the manner suggested by the hon. member,
Mr. Deakin, or in that suggested by the hon. member,
Mr. Barton, it is worthy of our consideration, and
that we ought to weigh the interests of the people
whose claims have been advocated by them. The
next resolution affirms:
That the military and naval defence of Australia shall be
intrusted to federal forces under one command.
Of course that is a sine qua non; and I hope we
shall not do this thing by halves. I hope we shall
not, as has been done in the United States, provide
for a divided authority over any of our forces,
whether those forces consist of a standing army, of
citizen troops, of militia, or of any other description
of force whatever. We know that great difficulties
arose in America because of some words which were
put into the constitution of that country providing
that the militia in the states were to be officered and
trained by the states themselves, and that although
the President was to be the commander-in-chief when
they were called out, yet the United States Govern-
ment was only to be entitled to call them out on the
occurrence of certain specified exigencies. Now, I
hope we shall do nothing of that sort, I hope that
the federal forces of all sorts and descriptions will
be raised, officered, trained, and paid by the federal
government. I now come to a point which is one of
our difficulties, and which has been very ably spoken
to by the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, on the one side,
and the hon. member, Mr. Barton, on the other. It
is proposed that we should have - a parliament to
consist of a senate and a house of representatives,
and that the senate should consist of an equal number
of members from each province. The first part of
this clause, separated from the last part, gives an
equal power in the senate to each constituent state of
the union. But that power is taken away by the
latter part of the clause which limits and curtails the
power of the senate, and it is this point, to which our
attention was first directed by the hon. member, Sir
Samuel Griffith, that I desire now to bring under the
notice of the Convention. The resolution says:
Subject to these and other necessary provisions, this Con-
vention approves of the framing of a federal constitu-
tion.
Now, what is a federation? Does a federal system
consist in delegating to the central authority certain
powers and functions, and in delegating to the legis-
latures of the states certain other powers and func-
tions ? I think not. I think a federation consists in
a great deal more than that. A federation, as it
appears to me, consists in the fact that the compact
made between the constituent states who wish to
enter into that federation provides that not only shall
the legislatures of the different states be supremo
concerning the powers which have been delegated or
left to them, but that they shall also have a voice as
states concerning the powders which are delegated to
the federal government. It is, perhaps, a somewhat
unfortunate name, as it has turned out, that we have
used in adopting the term “ senate.” If we had
called the chamber a “ council of the states ” there
would not, perhaps, have been so much confusion
concerning its constitution and its functions. That
is wdiat it is called in Switzerland, and that is what I
think it would be better to call it in our constitution,
because it clearly defines what the chamber really is.
It is in no shape analogous to an upper house. An
upper house represents and is elected by a portion of
the people ; but a council of the states is elected by
and represents the whole people. It is elected by
and represents the whole people quite as much as
does the house of representatives. The only differ-
ence is that the constituents are grouped in different
ways. The house of representatives is elected by
people grouped in electoral constituencies containing
probably an equal number of voters, and the council
of the states is elected by the people grouped in
states. I do not care whether the election to the
council of the states is a direct election by the
people, acting as one constituency, and voting by
universal suffrage, or whether it is an indirect
election, the election being by the legislatures w T ho
are elected for that purpose. In either case, the
council of states represents the states, and I think
the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, was somewhat illogical
in complaining that these resolutions do not define
in any way how the senate or council of the states is
to be elected. I think it would have been wrong if
it had been defined.
Mr. Deakin : I did not complain of that!
Mr. BAKER: Then I misunderstood the hon.
member; but I will say that if it had been defined it
would have been wrong, because the mode in which
the council of the states are elected is not a matter
which primarily affects the federal government. It
is a matter which affects the states, and there is no
reason whatever why one state should not send its
representatives to the council of the states in one
manner while one state should send its representa-
tives in another manner. That is done in Switzer-
land, and up to the year 1886 it was done to a certain
extent in America, because, although the American
Constitution provided that the legislatures of the
states should elect the members of the senate, it did
not provide in what manner. Therefore, they were
elected in a somewhat different manner in different
states up to 1886. In the Swiss Constitution some
of the states representatives are elected directly by
the people voting as one constituency, while in other
states they are elected by the legislature of the state;
but in all cases they are elected either directly or
indirectly by the state as a whole. Therefore, it
does not appear to be essential for us to define the
manner in which the council of the states shall be
elected. This federation has been defined as a com-
pound. The members of the council of the states,
acting on behalf of those states, have as much
right to consider themselves representatives of
the people, and have as much right to claim
the name of the popular chamber as has the other
branch of the legislature. As a matter of fact,
if you go to America, if you judge either by Ameri-
can writers, or by the opinions of the American
people, you will find that the senate is the popular
estate —I do not say in the mode of its election, but
popular in the ordinary sense of the word ; that is to
say, the people of the United States look up to, revere,
and respect the senate more than they do the house
of representatives, and, therefore, the assumption


of the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, that the house
of representatives would be the people’s house, the
popular house—that all power should be vested in
it —is unwarranted by facts, and contradicted by the
experience of America. The hon. member, Mr.
Deakin, has challenged anybody to show in what
way the senate or council of the states, with limited
powers such as he proposes to confer on them, would
derogate from the states rights. Having first enu-
merated the subject matters which were exclusively
delegated to the dominion parliament, he said :
The contention of those who support the argument is by
implication that the whole of these subjects, if legislated
upon, will involve state rights. I meet the argument at
once with a direct negative, by challenging hon. members
to point to an instance in which any questions such as those
to which I have referred can be legislated upon in such a
way as to affect state rights What I want
to know is, how any province, how any colony, can consider
that its rights are impaired when it is proposed to deal with
its residents in exactly the same way as the citizens of Aus-
tralia in every other colony of the group are dealt with.
What do we mean by states rights? It appears to
me that there are three aspects in which they may
be looked upon. First of all, the aspect of the rights
of the states as such states, as entities having powers
free and untrammelled, not only in all matters which
have not been exclusively delegated to the provincial
governments, but also having the right as states by
their representatives in the states council —a body
possessing co-equal power with the other branch of
the legislature —to express a free and untrammelled
opinion in gross and in detail on all matters of policy
and legislation. That is one aspect of states rights
in which the contention of the hon. member is clearly
wrong j because if the senate is a separate body, as
he suggests, a body with crippled and impaired
powers, sapped and undermined in the way in which
he suggests, how can it exercise those state rights in
the free and untrammelled manner in which they
ought to exercise them ? How can they exercise a
free opinion—an opinion which they ought to be
entitled to give as the representatives of their states
on all matters that come before them ? What I
understand by federation is that all the people of
these colonies, although they wish to form one nation
for certain purposes, although they wish to be one
nation so far as the house of representatives is con-
cerned, they wish so far as the states council is
concerned to preserve their individuality, to exercise
their powers freely, and in an untrammelled manner
in the other portion of the legislature. There is
another aspect of the question which has been
alluded to by the hon. member, Mr. Barton. Ho
matter how we frame this constitution, concurrent
jurisdiction will undoubtedly arise in some form or
other, and the states by their representatives in the
states council ought to have the free and untram-
melled power of saying whether or not in this con-
current legislation the matters should be legislated
upon by the federal or states legislatures. Take the
case which has arisen with reference to the bank-
ruptcy laws in America. Without expressing any
opinion as to whether or not it is wise for the federal
government to establish a uniform bankruptcy law
all over America, we know that they have never
done so.
Mr. Clauk : Tes, they did so in 1867 !
Ma. BAKER: Well, they did not do so for a very
long time. lam not expressing an opinion whether
they have or have not done so, or should have done
so ; but this is a question on which the representa-
tives of the states in the states council should have
a right to express an opinion as to whether it is a
matter that should be legislated upon by the states
or by the federal parliament. Then there is another
aspect of the case. The words states rights, I pre-
sume, are large enough to include the interests of
the states, and it is quite clear that many occasions
may arise in which if the federal council of the
states were not allowed to alter money bills the
larger states which were represented by a numerical
majority in the house of representatives might
seriously imperil the interests of the other states.
Take the question of postal arrangements. Suppos-
ing one or two large states, with a large majority in
the house of representatives, were trading and
manufacturing states, with, comparatively speaking,
a small amount of land, and supposing they wished
to concentrate all the trade and commerce in those
two states, how 7 easy it would be for them to do so!
It would only be necessary for them to put a line in
the estimates to enable them in making postal con-
tracts to ensure that their states should be the only
termini of the ocean steamers, .and they would have
thus placed in their hands the sole control of trade and
commerce. The power to do that w r ould not appear in
any bill at all; it would simply be an item in the
estimates, and the federal senate would either
be obliged to dislocate the whole financial system by
throwing out the appropriation bill, or they would
have to submit to the injustice. Again, suppose the
question of pavment of members were brought up in
the house of representatives, which might insist upon
paying members, or upon increasing the payment.
The smaller states might object to such a proposal;
but they could not give effect to that opinion unless
the senate had the power of rejecting the item, un-
less they took the responsibility of dislocating the
w r hole financial system of the country, by throwing
out the appropriation bill. There is another way in
w 7 hich the matter may be put. Supposing that some
of the states —the smaller states probably —were in
the position of having their chief wealth in land,
while in the larger states, wdiich would have the num-
erical majority in the house of representatives, the
wealth would chiefly consist in trade, commerce, and
manufactures. Notwithstanding the fact that no
doubt it will be laid down that all taxation is to be
uniform throughout the colonies or states, still, how
unfairly a heavy land-tax would operate upon the
smaller and poorer states, wdiich would have to bear
the burden, w r hile the richer and larger states would,
in comparison, be lightly taxed. Is not that a case
in which the council of the states ought to be free
and untrammelled to express an opinion ?No doubt
the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, will answ 7 er, " But
they can reject that bill. They can throw it out alto-
gether. I am not arguing that they should not have
the power of vetoing a bill as a whole." That is
perfectly correct; but if the council of the states is
constituted in the manner that the hon. member, Mr.
Deakin, suggests, if its powers are to be so curtailed,
and impaired, and undermined, as he suggests, we
know very well that, as the hon. member himself has
said, they would not be able to offer a strong opposi-
tion. If they are limited in their powers, not only
by the curtailment of those powers, but also by the
fact that the best men would not seek seats in the
senate if it were merely a recording and revising
house, how could we suppose that such a body could
hold its own against the branch of the legislature
which has all the power, and which, if we have a
responsible ministry, would also contain the ministers?
I maintain that if the senate is to be constituted in
the way which the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, sug-
gests, it will be a very unsafe guardian of the interests
of the smaller states; but I assert that if it has equal
and co-ordinate power with the house of represen-
tatives, it will not only be a safeguard, but the only
safeguard which the smaller states can obtain; and
unless they do obtain that safeguard, I am afraid that
the chances of their entering upon this federal union
are remote. We are told by several hon. members
that we ought to adopt the British Constitution, that
we ought to work on safe lines—lines under which
we have been brought up, and under which most of
us have worked. We are told that we ought not to
try experiments. I agree with these remarks to a


very considerable extent; but I am afraid we must
try experiments. If imperial federation, which has
been so much talked about, were accomplished to-
morrow, the British Constitution would have to be
altered. It would be utterly impossible to work the
British Constitution as a federal constitution. Would
the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, on behalf of Victoria,
consent to delegate to the imperial legislature all the
powers now possessed by Victoria ? Would he con-
sent to delegate those powers to a federated imperial
parliament, where all the power would be concen-
trated in the lower branch of the legislature—the
House of Commons—and where each colony would
only be numerically represented? Would he do
that ? Certainly not. That is something analogous
to what he is asking us to do now. I will go further
than that. Would he hand over the power of regu-
lating the fiscal policy of Victoria to the Imperial
Parliament, even if the House of Lords were done
away with, and if a senate were provided in lieu
thereof, to which the members were elected in equal
numbers by the constituent parts of the federation,
with powers limited and reduced, as ho seeks to re-
duce and limit the powers of the senate here ? Ido
not think he would do that. I think they would very
soon have free-trade in Victoria if such a course were
pursued.
Mr. Deakin : Put the question the other way—-
would I confer the power upon a senate on your
model ?
Mr. BAKER: That is another thing. There is
another aspect in which this question can be con-
sidered. We have not only to frame a Constitution
which will work at the present time, but we have to
frame a Constitution which will secure the love and
respect of the people of Australia, to which they will
adhere in the years to come—not because, as has
been well said, they are coerced, but because they feel
that it is their interest to do so; because they feel that
there is some body in the federal government which
represents that feeling which prevails in all bodies,
that is, the local feeling. As the Swiss states patriot
said, “My shirt is dearer to me than my coat,” and
in all federations we find that the states look upon
the states council as representing their feelings and
rights; and that is one of the bonds of their union.
While no doubt they look upon the house of repre-
sentatives with affection and respect, still their chief
affection and respect is given to the body which repre-
sents their particular state. Ido not propose to con-
tinue that branch of the subject any further ; but I
should like to say a few words concerning the remarks
of the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith. In the
able and thoughtful speech which he delivered ho
pointed out many difficulties which beset us ; and I
confess that, with others, I have been exceedingly
perturbed by his remarks. There is no doubt what-
ever that this council of the states being so entirely
different, as it must be in its constitution, powers,
and functions, from an upper house, if we try to
establish responsible government with two co-equal
and co-ordinate houses, we are trying an experiment,
and an experiment which may or may not succeed.
Sir Samuel Griffith gave us the theory on which
responsible government is founded. I prefer to take
the practice —the absolute facts. Theory is all very
well, but what are the facts ? The facts are that
responsible government has risen solely in conse-
quence of one branch of the legislature usurping all
power. The members of a responsible government
may be regarded as a committee chosen by one branch
of the legislature, not, perhaps, directly, but by a
premier who is so chosen, and who follows what he
conceives to be the wishes of such branch of the
legislature in choosing his colleagues. And the
question is whether we can reconcile that fact, and
can work that system in with two co-ordinate and co-
equal branches of the legislature. I admit it is a
most difficult problem, and it is one to which I am
not prepared at present to give a solution. But I
would remind the members of this Convention that
in two colonies, at all events, we are not without some
experience. Of course Ido admit to its fullest pos-
sible extent, the fundamental difference between a
federal council of the states and an upper house, and
therefore the experience is not at all conclusive.
But the legislation which has taken place during
the last thirty years in Tasmania and South Aus-
tralia throws some light, at all events, on the
subject—light which is, perhaps, not so familiar
to the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, as it is
to the delegates from those two colonies. We have
two branches of legislature, co-ordinate and co-equal
in powers in those two colonies, except so far as the
initiation of money bills is concerned, and we have
got under them some how or other. We certainly
have not done so without friction; we certainly
have not gone on without quarrels, but what form of
government is carried on without quarrels, unless it
be absolute tyranny ?
Mr. Munro : There is friction there !
Mr. BAKER: And I venture to say that the
friction and the quarrels in the colonies in which the
two houses of parliament have not co-ordinate
jurisdiction have been quite as frequent and quite as
violent as in the two colonies I have mentioned.
Mr. Munro : It is because they claimed it!
Mr. Cuthbert : But they possess it!
Mr. BAKER: I understand it is expressly laid
down in the Victorian Constitution that the Legisla-
tive Council shall not alter money bills.
Mr. Cuthbert : And they never tried to do so !
Mr. BAKER: Those are the words, I understand,
either by direct provision or by necessary implication
which the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, wishes to place
in this federal constitution as limiting the powers of
the senate.
Mr. Munro : Something better than that!
Mr. BAKER: And if the house of representatives
could claim the power, notwithstanding the words,
what is the good of putting words in at all concerning
the matter P But Ido not understand, and I have
never understood, that any such claim was ever put
forward. lam much obliged to hon. members for
having listened to me so attentively, and, in conclusion,
I hope that we shall all approach this subject in a
spirit of amity and compromise, that we shall all be
prepared to give way on those matters which we do
not consider of absolutely vital importance. I
approach this subject in that spirit myself, and I
hope that, notwithstanding the difficulties, the many
difficulties, which have arisen, and the many difficul-
ties which probably will .arise before we conclude our
deliberations, we shall be able to frame some con-
stitution which will inaugurate the dominion of
Australia under the brightest possible auspices.
Mr. BIRD : I regret very much that my duties in
connection with the Postal Conference this morning
rendered it impossible for me to attend the Conven-
tion, and, consequently, I did not hear what I have
heard characterised as the very able address of the
hon. and learned member, Mr. Barton. I shall,
therefore, in any remarks I have to make, be unable
to speak with a knowledge of what he advanced. All
the rest of the delegates I have listened to with close
attention and with very much pleasure, and I am
sure that those who have listened to the debate as
far as it has proceeded must be satisfied that the
members of the Convention have brought to it so much
thought and so much earnestness, that it augurs well
for success. I take it, sir, met here as we are, sent here
by parliaments which have admitted the desirableness
of forming a federation, there is no need whatever to
advance any argument in favour of a federal union
of these colonies, our business being rather, under
our instructions, to consider how we can unite and
for what objects we ought to unite. That being so, sir,
it appears to me that the resolutions which you have


submitted to us are wisely limited to the laying down
of the foundation propositions 011 which we think a
union should be based. At any rate they are limited
to opening up those questions which must be
considered, and which must find some agree-
ment among the members of the Convention before
we can elaborate a scheme of federation in all its
details. There is one point which I think we all
should keep in mind, and which, judging from some
of the speeches, if not from all of them, we are keep-
ing in mind, and that is that we are to formulate a
scheme of federation which will be just to all the
colonies. I may here express my fear that if the re-
solutions are agreed to in their present # form the
scheme formulated upon such a basis will not be
thoroughly just to all the colonies. I think, as I
believe I heard it put this morning by the hon. mem-
ber, Sir John Downer, that there is an inconsistency
between the first resolution of the first series and the
first resolution of the second series, and in regard to
that inconsistency I shall say something hereafter.
Broadly, taking the first series of resolutions in their
general terms, and as the embodiment of certain
principles, though perhaps not expressed in the exact
form and language which we may approve, it appears
to me that those resolutions may be, and will be,
generally agreed to. But, as I have said, if the system
of government which is foreshadowed in the second
series of resolutions is to be adopted, I can hardly
think it will be in accordance with the principles laid
down in the first of these resolutions, that the state
shall not surrender any of the rights and privileges
and powers which they now possess. Now, taking
the first series in their order, I am sure that we must
all agree that there can be no union of these colonies
unless upon such terms as are there set forth —that
there shall be no surrender of any right, or power, or
privilege, except such as is admitted to be absolutely
necessary for the good government of the union as a
whole. "And if we should formulate any scheme
which would invade the rights and privileges of the
several states, I am sure it will be in vain that we
shall go back to our respective colonies and ask them
to accept the scheme and join the union. Of course,
sir, while we baldly say we shall give up, and ask the
colonies to give up, nothing but what is absolutely
necessary, we can all agree to that form of words. It
is when we get into Committee and hear what is
necessary that we may find difficulties ; and indeed,
the discussion, as far as it has gone, has tended to
show that there are wide divergencies already. It
appears to me that our friends from Victoria will be
prepared to surrender to the federal parliament a
great deal more than the representatives of the smaller
colonies will. "Whether it is because-the gentlemen
from Victoria know that they will probably be, in
connection at any rate with the other large colony on
the continent, namely, New South Wales, in a
majority amongst the representatives of the states and
may be able to get their own way, and that that is
the reason and ground of their ready acceptance of
this proposal —well, one can hardly at present say.
But it does seem to me that they are more ready to
surrender certain state rights, and privileges, and
powers than- are the delegates of the smaller colonies
who have spoken, and certainly they are more willing
to surrender them than I, as a representative among
others of the small colony of Tasmania, am prepared
to do.
Mr. MUNRO : We are not willing to surrender one
state right that the hon. member is not willing to
surrender!
Mr. BIRD : When I come to speak of the consti-
tution of the house of representatives and of the
senate, I may have something to say on that parti-
cular point. But it seems to me that for the coii-
servation of rights in regard to taxation and expendi-
ture generally, the state of Tasmania will require
some more consideration than appears to be required
now by Victoria, if I may judge by the speeches of
the hon. members, Mr. Munro and Mr. Deakin, to
whom I listened with very great pleasure. Now, sir,
after laying down the proposition —
that the powers and privileges and* territorial rights of
the several existing colonies shall remain intact, except in
respect to such surrenders as may be agreed upon as neces-
sary and incidental to the power and authority of the national
federal government—
you then proceed to indicate some of the most im-
portant surrenders which the local legislature will, in
your opinion, be called upon to make. The first of
these is the surrender of all power in regard to the
question of customs, and it is here affirmed most
positively that the trade and intercourse between the
federated colonies shall be absolutely free. Sir, if I
may judge by what has fallen from the hon. member,
Mr. Deakin, there would seem to be a disposition to
regard that surrender, if it is to take place immedi-
ately upon the federation of the colonies, as partaking
to some extent of injustice. Eor I cannot understand
his expressed wash—and a wish that I think was
somewhat, similarly expressed by the hon. member,
Sir John Downer —for a gradual drop from a system
of protection in the various colonies which have
established that policy to one of free-trade as between
the colonies, but as indicative of a sense that there
will be injustice if, all at once, on the establishment
of this federation, there is to be free-trade between
all the colonies. So that here, at the outset, we find
ourselves on the point of a difficulty, and one that I
hardly expected to be raised so strongly as it has
been raised by Victoria. I could not help feeling,
while the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, spoke so
eloquently in regard to the necessity of considering
those interests which have been built up during the
last few years in Victoria at the expenditure of
millions of money
Colonel SMITH : During the last twenty years.
Mr. BIRD: I could not help feeling what a weak-
ness is shown by the protectionist advocates almost
continually —and more particularly in a case like
that of Victoria, where, after so many years' opera-
tion of the principles of protection, having, as one
would have supposed, got themselves so thoroughly
established that they could beat creation, as the
Yankees would say, in manufacturing industries and
in the trade of the surrounding colonies—that they
are yet afraid to give that up unless it be by the
gradual process of dropping down after two, three,
four, or five years. I should not have been very
much astonished, sir, if we had an argument like that
from South Australia, where a protective policy hrs
been so recently brought into operation, and more
particularly was I expecting that kind of a request
from its delegates, after the statements which were
made by various of its representatives at the Federal
Conference in Melbourne last year. I will admit-
though I am not a strong protectionist and certainly
by no means an ardent free-trader, but something
that goes between —I will admit that there would
have been a great deal more reason in such a con-
tention from South Australia than there is in it,
coming as it does from Victoria. I am glad to learn
from the hon. members from South Australia what I
believe to be the fact, that they are not so anxious to
perpetuate that policy under the federal government
in regard to intercourse between the several colonies
as they were a year ago, and that we shall by no
means have the same amount of difficulty in inducing
them to join the union, if free-trade is to be estab-
lished at once, as we should have had if we had
started to form the basis of union, and formulate a
scheme twelve months ago. There is no doubt that
where large sums of money have been invested, as
they have been both in South Australia and Victoria
in the establishment of industries, it would be a desir-
able thing from a manufacturer's and investor s
point of view to gradually drop from the system


which protects them from outside competition to one
under which all trade will be free. And although
strongly inclined and disposed to advocate the adop-
tion of freetade as between the colonies in the fede-
ration at the very earliest possible date, believing, as
I do, strongly that the sooner we adopt freetrade
between all these colonies the better for them all, yet,
notwithstanding that, I would not like to say that in
the interest of securing a union of all these colonies,
I would not be prepared to agree to a proposal which
might perpetuate the existing policies in some of
those colonies for a shorter or longer period, if a
time be fixed for establishing an absolutely uniform
tariff throughout the whole of the colonies.
Colonel SMITH : A uniform protectionist tariff !
Mr. BIRD : No, I am not a protectionist; and
these remarks do not indicate it. They only indicate
that I am a unionist; and I am quite prepared to
make concessions as an individual member of this
Convention to secure a union; and I know that if
that same spirit prevails on all hands, we shall have
a most successful issue of our labours in this par-
ticular work. I do not know that any very great
harm would come if we had to perpetuate existing
tariffs even to a longer and remoter date than that
which will be the very earliest time that the federal
parliament can prepare a new tariff. But certainly
my impression is, sir, that the time which must lapse
before a federal parliament can meet and have a
session or two in which to formulate and carry through
a tariff for the various colonies will be ample to
prepare the various manufacturers and industries
generally, whether in South Australia or Victoria, for
the new policy, and that in that way we may perhaps
not have to defer the introduction of the uniform tariff
beyond the earliest date at which it is possible to be
introduced under the federal government. Ido not
know that I need say more in regard to the absolute
necessity, as I take it, of there being a uniform tariff
throughout these colonies; but that there should be
freetrade as between themselves I think is beyond
doubt, and I am very glad indeed to find that even
the most ardent protectionists who have spoken here,
as well as those who are not members of this Conven-
tion, who have spoken and written upon this question,
appear to be quite of opinion, that whatever the future
policy with regard to trade with the outside world
may be, it should be absolutely free as between the
colonies themselves. I will now pass on to the next
resolution, that is the fourth of the first series, which
sets forth that, "the military and naval defences of
Australia shall be entrusted to federal forces under
one command." Now this, with one qualification
which I may have to make presently, entirely accords
with my own views, and I have no doubt that we shall
find little, if any dissension on this score amongst the
members of this Convention. The one qualification
which I might wish to make, or I would rather put it
as a suggestion which I feel ought to be thrown in
here, is as to the scope of the words which are used
in this resolution. I quite understand that you, sir,
in moving the resolution, expressed the opinion that
the federal government, by its duly appointed com-
mander-in-chief, is to have the entire control of the
military and naval defences of these colonies; but
you did not explain whether you made reference
only to those forces which had been raised solely
by the colonies themselves, or whether you embraced
in your resolution the idea that we were to have
control also, in the federal government, of those
vessels which are here as part of the imperial
squadron, and to the maintenance of which all the
colonies with the exception of Queensland, which has
specially refused, have undertaken to contribute.
A ow this appears to me to be a very important ques-
tion which has hitherto been overlooked in the dis-
cussion of this resolution. Do you mean, sir, that
all these vessels that are sent out by the Imperial
Government, officered by Imperial men, and com-
manded by the admiral of the station, are to be, as
part of the defences of Australia to which we as
several colonies are now contributing, subject to the
control of the federal government ?
Mr. Minsruo : Tou are not paying for them!
Mr. BIRD : We are paying for part of them; we
are sharing the cost with the Imperial Government,
and it is a question which I do not profess to be able
to answer now as to how far the federal government,
with such powers as we hope it will have, is to be in
a state of partnership with the Imperial Government
in the matter of vessels like these, and as to how far
it is to leave the control of these vessels in time of
war in the hands of their own admiral, or whether
their control is to be in the hands of our Government.
I merely throw this out as a consideration before we
deal with the matter in the scheme which we are
about to formulate. Now, I come to the very impor-
tant question of the constitution of the legislature of
the federal government, and, as I have before remarked,
I cannot heljo fearing, and am bound, therefore, to
express my tear, respecting the proposal as to the
constitution of the senate —call it by what name you
will —the chamber that is to represent the states, and
I may add perhaps, also, as to the constitution and
responsibility of the executive, and its relations to the
two houses. I expressed my fear that the proposals
embodied in this second series of resolutions are some-
what inconsistent with the principle laid down in the
first of the resolutions which you have submitted. In
the proposal as we have it before us the states as
such are to be allowed no power to deal with money
bills, with taxation, or with expenditure, except so far
as consists in swallowing whole or rejecting entirely
the proposals of this kind that come from the house
of representatives. Now, I ask with all seriousness,
would a parliament formed on those lines be just to
all the colonies? If the house of representatives
alone is to have the power to tax and the power to
appropriate, what protection have the smaller states
of the group in such a legislature as this ? I take it
that justice to the smaller states—and that is the
thing that we have to keep in mind in framing our
constitution—as well as to the larger ones will
necessitate that the power of veto in detail, as Sir
Samuel Griffith put it, the power of veto in regard
to all bills that deal with the raising or appropriation
of money, shall be vested in the second chamber. I
do not believe that the colonies would consent—cer-
tainly I do not think that the smaller colonies would
consent —to surrender that power which they now
have of controlling the amount of money which will
be raised by taxation or spent for any purpose what-
soever under such a constitution as this. Is it con-
ceivable that these states, colonies, or call them by
what name you will, will be content to group them-
selves together in a federal union and as states have
no more power —I may, advisedly, I think say it—
than they have under the present Federal Council Act ?
For if you are going to withhold all the power of
dealing with money, either as to the raising or expendi-
ture of it, from the states council or senate, what
more will you leave for that body than is already
possessed in the way of powers of legislation by
the existing Federal Council? What will be the
special advantage of having a second house, if that
second house, representing the states, is not to
have more power than would be given to it under
the proposals in these resolutions, or more power
than is now possessed by the Federal Council of
Australasia? Those who argue, as the hon. mem-
ber for Victoria, Mr. Deakin, did, that all these
money powers should be vested absolutely in the one
house, at any rate, so thoroughly that another chamber
would have no power of alteration in the way of
amendment, are really arguing for government by one
chamber, and that indeed by the chamber which does
not in the least degree conserve the power of the
states, as I take it they ought to be conserved in such


a union as they would desire to see brought about.
Why, the most important questions which the states
will have to consider are those that connect themselves
with money bills, taxation, and the whole of the
expenditure in connection with defence and the general
government of the country. These matters are those
in which the states are closely and deeply interested;
and if you are to say that only in the house of repre-
sentatives, where the individuals of the several states
have their will recorded by the votes of the majority
of the whole, is there to be power to deal with these
very important questions, it seems to me that you
deprive the various states of those powers which they
ought to have reserved to them in the senate of the
new government. With these views, which I have
briefly and freely expressed, I leave this part of my
subject by saying that I feel perfectly sure that we
shail not be able to establish a union into which the
whole of the colonies wall come, and which will be
just to them all, unless we establish it on something
like those broad lines which I, in common with two
or three of the speakers who preceded me, have
had the pleasure of indicating. I do not know why
we should fear to give to the senate —to the state
council —the power to deal with money bills. We
are prepared to intrust them with every other legisla-
tion, much of which is very important, and in regard
to all of which the majority of the states, as opposed
to the majority of individuals, will have sway, and I
ask why should we hesitate to place that same power
in the hands of the majority of the states in regard
to money bills in general as we are prepared to place
in their hands in regard to all other matters of very
important legislation? I cannot help feeling that
the hesitation on the part of some hon. members who
have spoken, and possibly on the part of others who
may speak, to agree to placing such power in the
hands of the senate arises from their overlooking, to
a larger extent than they are aware, the essential
difference which there will be, or at any rate which
there ought to be, between the senate of the federal
government and the House of Lords or any upper
house with w r hich we are familiar in these colonies.
We shall make a very great mistake if we do not
bring the senate under our new constitution into close
touch with the people of the several states. I was
very glad to hear the very telling remarks which fell
from the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, yesterday, in
regard to the question of having the senate purely
representative of the people. They were in connection
w r ith the argument by which he was showing the
necessity of having the money power solely in the
house of representatives ; but it struck me that the
position he took up, and the indications he gave of
what the senate might be, went far to tell against his
own argument, and, at any rate, showed me the
necessity more, perhaps than I had seen it before, of
having the senate directly in touch w r ith the people.
Now, the proposal has been made, I do not mean to say
here, but in the discussions of these questions which
have taken place elsewhere, and in the press, that the
senate should be elected by the legislatures. Well, it
may be a very fair expedient by which to elect members
for the second chamber; but on giving it the fuller
consideration that I am now giving it from day to day,
I do not think that that would be the best method of
electing the members of the senate. We do not
want in our senate either nominees or representatives
of nominees. We know that some of our councils
in these colonies are composed partly, if not wholly,
of
nominee members, and we do not consider that
they are the proper persons to elect representatives
of the various colonies to sit as members of the
federal council—that they are fitting people to elect
persons to represent those colonies in this great state
that is to be. Nor do I consider that the members
who occupy seats in those chambers w T hich arc elected
by the propertied classes should elect members for
the federal senate. It seems to me, therefore, that
no matter what the constitutions of the councils in
the several colonies are, none of them is exactly fit
to elect the members of the federal council —to send
to the senate the men we want to represent us there.
Only by the direct vote of the majority of the people
in the several states, each, state sending the same
number to the federal body as the others send, can
we get the kind of senate which we ought to have.
If we get a senate of that kind, it will be so entirely
different from the legislative councils for the various
colonies and the House of Lords in England, that
we may safely intrust to it powers with regard to
money bills that we would never think of intrusting
to some of the councils now in existence; and it is
because of this essential difference between the
existing colonial upper houses and the federal council
that is to be, that we may strike out new lines, and
very safely permit to the senate certain powers which
we have not been in the habit of permitting so fully
to the councils of the various states. On the same
grounds it appears to me, as my friend, the hon.
delegate for South Australia, Mr. Baker, just now
put it, we may have to try experiments in regard to
the executive. If we are going to have a council
which is empowered to deal with money bills, w r e
possibly may find that we will need an executive
that will be responsible to both houses, and that the
resolution, as you, sir, have moved it, would in that
particular require amplifying, so that ministers should
not hold office solely at the will of the majority of
one house. Of course lam not at the present
moment laying down any definite lines on which
such an executive ought to be established, and ought
to work; but I am throwing out suggestions indi-
cating simply that under this new federal system we
may have to diverge to some extent from the lines
which we have hitherto followed, even in regard to
executive government. Before leaving this question
of the executive and the legislature entirely, I would
make a passing reference to the possible necessity
that may arise for the dissolution of the senate, as
well as for the dissolution of the house of represen-
tatives, in the event of anything like a deadlock
between the two houses. If our senate is to be so
representative of the people as I have indicated, or
as I believe that it should be, there would be a pro-
priety in requiring that senate to be dissolved after
one or two attempts to pass through it a measure
that had passed the house of representatives. I
have often felt, when the councils of our colonies
have refused to pass measures which have been
carried by large majorities of the house of assembly,
that it would be a very good thing if the gentlemen
who occupied seats in those upper chambers were
required to go to their constituents to be told what
the constituents thought of their action. It is very
pleasant for them in their lordly dignity to say,
"You can go to your constituents, and have all
the trouble of an election, while we enjoy the
fun" ; but I think it would be a good thing under
the new constitution that if the senate, supposing it
elected in the way I think it ought to be, had refused
once or twice to pass measures to which the house
of representatives had agreed by a large majority,
they should be sent to their constituents, so that we
should have anew and the best expression of opinion
from all the states as a whole. It will be clear that
I am not in favour of that resolution which provides
for a perpetuity of the senate in the way the resolu-
tions before us set out. Ido think it would be
better to fix a term, as is fixed for the representatives
of the lower house, during which they should hold
office, and that they should be under similar condi-
tions to those which I have indicated —liable to
dissolution, so that the people's will may be ascer-
tained, and they informed as to the course they
ought to pursue. Not having a legal mind, and not
being versed in legal matters, I shall act wisley if I
leave such questions as the establishment of a judiciary


to the professional men who are in our midst. I do
not think I need add more to the remarks I have
made. I must express my gratification at the manner
in which the remarks I have made have been received,
and I will conclude by expressing a hope that our
deliberations, however long continued, or however
briefly they may last, will result in the preparation
o£ such a scheme of federation as shall be acceptable
to our several colonies, when we go back to them,
and so bring about, before a very long time shall
have elapsed, a united Australia, which shall be, as
was stated by one of the speakers the other even-
ing, one of the brightest jeAvels in her Majesty’s
crown.
Colonel Smith : I have no desire to interrupt the
proceedings. I should have been glad, however, to
have spoken now had it not been that some documents
which I require will not arrive until to-morrow. I
find that thirteen hon. members have already spoken.
On Monday the delegates from Western Australia
will be with us, and the Convention will then be
complete. As far as I can gather, we shall, in all
probability, finish this part of our proceedings by
Wednesday. If there is no other hon. member ready
to speak, I will move the adjournment of the debate
until Monday.
The President : I gathered from the feeling dis-
played yesterday, that a majority of the Convention
are unwilling to adjourn at so early an hour.
Colonel Smith ; I have no objection to give way
to any one else who wishes to speak.
The President : If no hon. gentleman is prepared
to proceed, perhaps the hon. member, Colonel Smith,
will move the adjournment of the debate.
Motion (by Colonel Smith) proposed:
That the debate be adjourned until Monday.
Question resolved in the negative.
Sir PATRICK JENNINGS: I have not come
here to day prepared to make any elaborate speech ;
but I am prepared to deliver the opinions which I
hold on the great question presented to this Con-
vention —opinions deliberately formed, and which
will guide me in my action on this most important
occasion in endeavouring to come to a right, fair, and
just conclusion. Before proceeding to speak with
regard to the resolutions, I may say that I have stood
up now because I think it is important that we should
proceed as expeditiously as possible with the great
work we have in hand. I quite appreciate the great
inconvenience to which the delegates from "Victoria,
Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania are put
by being delayed here unnecessarily ; and I hope, in
order to carry on the deliberations of this Convention
as quickly as possible, that, having stood here nearly
all this week shivering on the brink, every member
present will take his plunge with all reasonable
despatch. Quoting a word or two from the speech
of the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, at the last
Melbourne Conference, I may say that I have not
come here to take part in any mere contest of de-
clamation ; but I have come to assist with all the
poor help I can give in arriving at the goal and
achieving the great object we all have in view. We
have all come here with prepared opinions, I believe,
after mature thought, and I am quite sure with a
sincere desire to accomplish this gx*eat work ; and I
hold that it would be calamitous to the whole of
Australia if, by any undue delay, we so dallied over
this work as to prevent us from bringing it to a
consummation as quickly as we conveniently can. I
heard, sir, in your opening speech, the admirable
sentiment that we ought all to be animated with a
desire to give and take —to make mutual compro-
mises and, indeed, to be possessed with an animated
principle of unity in this great cause. I do not for
one moment mean to say that there are those who
have come here rather to take than to give; but Ido
hope there will be a reasonable compromise on both
sides ; and I should prefer, instead of the expression
give and take, or take and give, to use the motto of
the great German Chancellor, do ut des, 11 We give
that you may give us back again”; and that is the
true spirit of conciliation and compromise. I believe,
unless we feel deeply the obligation cast upon us of
throwing aside all prejudices, of throwing aside, as
far as possible, all causes of difference, that we shall
not accomplish the object we have in view. The
eyes of the whole of this great continent of Australia
are upon us. Many things are expected from us ;
much is expected from us. The hopes and the
prayers of the large majority of people are for the
success of this Convention; and I know and feel
that if we are truly and deeply animated with the
proper sentiments, our deliberations will result in that
successful issue which we all desire to attain —the
formation of one great Australian nation. I will not
advert to the resolutions in detail, because I am now
speaking hurriedly, without preparation. I find from
the resolutions which have been placed before the
Convention by you, Mr. President, that
the powers and privileges and territorial rights of the
several existing colonies shall remain intact.
With regard to the powers we possess, and which
have been given us under a very free constitution ;
with regard to the privileges which we possess under
that constitution; and, above all, with regard to the
territorial rights which we possess under that con-
stitution, I should like to say a few words. In
entering into the discussion of the union of these
colonies or states, I hold it w r ould be a most neces-
sary and a most important thing that no attempt
should be made to destroy old landmarks, or to alter
existing boundaries, without the expressed desire
and consent of the inhabitants of the different
colonies. I, for one, most plainly say that it will be
a most undesirable and a most unwise thing to
attempt to do that. There are a thousand reasons
which might bo adduced why it should not be done.
In any remarks that I have had to make to our own
colonists on this subject, I have pointed out that we,
in the colony of New South Wales, have within our
territorial limits a well-defined boundary, a boundary
which, within the last forty or fifty years, has been
curtailed on the one side —the Port Phillip side —by
a large portion of territory being taken away, and
on the other side by the great territory now known
as Queensland being taken away. lam not quite
sure, sir, what the expression “ such surrenders”
may imply. If it means anything for the good
of the whole federation —if it implies something
necessary for federation, and not any readjust-
ment of boundaries —then I say we are perfectly
willing; and I am quite sure the whole of the
colonies will not ask for anything more than that
this particular article of the resolution which you
have put before us should be agreed to. I may add
that the circumstances of this colony are quite
different from those of the great unoccupied terri-
tories .of Western Australia, which really include,
geographically speaking, one third portion of the
whole of the continent. They are also different from
the circumstances of South Australia—-a colony
which, including the great territory of Northern
Australia, has under its jurisdiction nearly another
third of the continent. We are also different from
our friends in Queensland, in which colony even now
an agitation is going on for division. I have no
doubt that if these questions are, by the consent and
desire of the inhabitants of the different colonies, left
to the federal government, which we wish to see
established, they will, when the proper time comes,
be dealt with in a satisfactory manner—perhaps a
more satisfactory manner than if they were remitted
to the pow T er which has for many years dealt with


questions oE that sort. I do not Avish to say more
than a few words on this occasion—and I am speak-
ing more for the purpose of filling up the time than
of airing my own opinions—and I Avould state, Avith
regard to the first portion of the resolution, that I
have no objection to offer to it. With regard to the
second portion of the Ist resolution, I have always
maintained, and feel now particular pleasure in being
privileged to express my opinion, that one of the
greatest drawbacks to the prosperity of these colonies,
one of those festering sores that rankle in the minds
of colonists, is the arbitrary customs duties which
intercept the free passage of goods and produce from
one colony to the other. You, Mr. President, having
for many years presided over the destinies of this
colony, must have felt what a sore feeling has been
produced by our having to pay the border duties
Avhich Ave have to pay. I believe that one of the
greatest blessings which could possibly accrue to the
Avhole group of colonies, and one of the things Avith-
out Avhich I hold federation to be a mere farce, and
absolutely impossible, is free intercolonial trade.
Unless Ave get free intercolonial trade, federation is
not Avorth talking about. A true union between us
can only be brought about in that way, and I hold
that to be of greater importance than the ultimate
question—the question which is to be decided in the
future, and upon Avhich I will not now pronounce an
opinion—the question as to the principles of political
economy, AAhether of free-trade or protection, so-
called, against the exterior commerce of the country,
upon which federation will be brought about. If I
Avere to state my opinion, I should express the belief
that the levying of duties upon the goods from foreign
countries should be made as nearly as possible for
reA r enue purposes. I am quite aware that it has been
said, and Avith a great deal of force, that it is inevit-
able that these duties should be levied on protective
lines. I do not pretend to say that it should not be
so. Very frequently large differences of opinion
exist in the public mind as to which is the better
system, protection or free-trade. So far I have always
upheld the theory of free-trade as a most beneficent
theory ; but, sir, according to your own Avords, what-
ever is decided upon by the majority of the federal
legislature, must be submitted to for the good of
the country. I say plainly that my political creed
is this : that federation is a greater good than any
form of fiscal legislation, AA r hatever it may be.
The union of the people —the union of the colonies —
is to me an immeasurably greater and higher aim
than the establishment of any fiscal policy whatever.
There is no doubt Avhatever that the military and naval
defence of Australia should be intrusted to federal
forces under one command. The reason why I pass
lightly over these matters is because any expression
of opinion given now is merely a prelude to Avhat Avill
have to be said in a much more detailed manner with
regard to each of the questions dealt Avith by the
resolutions. What I may call the crux of the Avhole
matter is what was said, by the hon. member, Sir
Samuel Griffith, with regard to the poAvers to be in-
trusted to some sort of upper house —call it a senate,
council, or Avhat you will. I suppose we s,re all
agreed that there must be tAVO chambers, based very
much on the principles laid down in the resolutions.
I should strongly oppose any copying of the Canadian
Constitution as regards the system applied there of
senators being nominated by the Crown. I have no
doubt that there Avere very good reasons for it at the
time Avhen the Canadians adopted that principle, but
we are not bound to simply follow any analogy of
the United States or of Canada or any other coun-
try. "We are bound to knoAV all about their systems
by Avay of illustration and enlightenment, but not to
slavishly folloAV them. We are here under particular
circumstances, by no means analogous to those of the
American states Avhen the convention met in Phila-
delphia in 1787, nor have we had the idea of unity
preached to us as the Canadians have had it preached
to them, and inculcated in them since the time of
Lord Durham, but which took a long time to bear
fruit because of the different races in, and the dif-
ferent provincial relations of, Canada. We are in
the midst of a much better state of things. We are
undertaking federation deliberately without external
pressure, without even its being forced on us in any
way by the consideration of events, except that wo
acknowledge that, in the pure evolution of events, if we
do not come together we must gradually fall asunder.
It is because I feel very deeply that we ought to make
use of this sentiment of union, and to combine for
common purposes as quickly as we can, that I think
it is expedient, and I am glad to perceive that this
distinguished assembly of gentlemen from all parts
of Australia, with mature experience, appear by dif-
ferent mental processes to have arrived at the con-
clusion that the one thing we ought to do while we
are in a pleasant frame of mind is to draw our-
selves together, make a close union, and not to allow
causes of difference to arise, and be perpetuated
between us, which might in the future drive us fur-
ther asunder and lead to a state of things in which it
would be extremely difficult for us to come together
again. I have refrained from going into matters of
detail as regards the constitution of the federal par-
liament ; but I may say that I believe that we shall
be far better off if we have a strong upper house
that will command respect, and as nearly as possible
under the circumstances be modelled on the upper
house of the United States rather than on the nomi-
nated council of Canada. I firmly believe that the
arguments used by the hon. the Premier of Queens-
land, and so ably supported this morning by the hon.
and learned member, Mr. Barton, are irrefutable, for
they take into account the two great factors of the
situation. We want a democratic groundwork to
start upon ; but we must acknowledge the fact, if
it is a fact, that we are a union of separate states,
each having its own independence. I prefer that
the upper house should have as much power with
regard to taxation as has been suggested by the
hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith. With regard
to the constitution of the judiciary, I believe that
if we had a supreme court as a high court of appeal
here, to deal with all legal questions, ninety-nine
cases out of every hundred would be more speedily
and more accurately dealt with than if they were
sent to the Privy Council at home. You, sir, said,
and I believe correctly, that the Sovereign would still
be the head of the supreme court of appeal in
England ; and, if we still have the golden link of the
Crown, then the Sovereign will be the head of our
judiciary, as she is the head of the court of appeal in
England. I regard these resolutions as being sugges-
tive ; and if, in the course of their elaboration, I, in
my poor, humble way, can do anything to promote
their discussion in such a manner as to tend to a
speedy and adequate settlement of the question we
have in hand, I shall bo most happy to do so. Wo
are all labouring for one purpose ; we are all intensely
animated by the idea that we ought, at least, to
attempt to bring about a union as well and as early
as possible. I hope that this will be the animating
principle which will guide us throughout our dis
cussions, and that, whatever differences of opinion
may arise, we shall bear in mind the fact that we
have one common object to attain, and that now is
the time to attain it.
Motion (by Colonel Smith) agreed to :
That the debate be now adjourned.
Convention adjourned at 4 20 p.m.


MONDAY, 9 MARCH, 1891.
The Roll—Western Australia—The Hon. William Shiels—
Federal Constitution (fourth day’s debate).
The President took the chair at 11 a.m.
THE EOLL.
The Honorable Henry John Wrixon, Q.C., M.P.,
a delegate of Victoria, and the Honorable John
Forrest, 0.M.G., M.P., the Honorable William
Edward Marmion, M.P., the Honorable Sir James
George Lee-Steere, Kt., M.P., the Honorable John
Arthur Wright, M.L.C., the Honorable John Win-
throp Hackett, M.L.C., Alexander Forrest, Esq.,
M.P., and William Thorley Loton, Esq., M.P.,
delegates of Western Australia, subscribed the roll.
WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
The President : I believe that I shall only express
the feeling of every delegate of the older colonies in
taking this opportunity to welcome the delegates from
Western Australia. Western Australia, with her
great future all unveiled before her, is the latest to
come into the family of free states in Australia, and
her service to us is eminently great, because she
completes now the circle within which, so far as the
soil of Australia extends, there is only one form of
government. We have all intensely sympathised with
her in her efforts to obtain a free constitution, and
we rejoice in the achievement of what we believe will
be a great boon to her. In coming to this Convention
she comes not simply as a delegation, but she comes to
lend her assistance as one of the first acts in her new,
free existence. I am quite sure I can say on behalf of
every one of the older colonies, that we welcome her
without any stint, and with the utmost cordiality.
Mr. J. FORREST: Mr. President and gentlemen, —
On behalf of the colony of Western Australia, I
most sincerely thank you for your kindly welcome to
us on this great occasion. I hope that the admission
of Western Australia into the group of self-governing
colonies of this continent may tend to the general
advantage of this portion of Her Majesty’s dominions,
and that it will prove the commencement of a greater
measure of prosperity for us. As the President has
remarked, Western Australia is yet in its infancy as
regards the development of its resources, and the
extent of its political institutions. I can only
express the hope that as time goes on we shall
grow in material wealth, and that we shall enjoy a
proportionate political development; also that the
colony will so conduct her affairs as a member of
the self-governing colonies of Australia as will in no
way detract from that high position Australia has
attained as a loyal and progressive portion of her
Majesty’s dominions.
THE HON. WILLIAM SHIELS.
The President: I desire to bring under the notice
of the Convention a matter which, I think, should be
dealt with at once before we proceed with our ordinary
business. It will be recollected that the Attorney-
General of Victoria, the Hon. William Shiels, sub-
scribed the roll and took his seat on this Convention,
under a commission issued by the Governor-in-
Council in the absence of the Hon. Henry John
Wrixon, who had been formally elected to a seat on
the Convention. It has been represented to me, not
by the Hon. James Munro, the leader of the present
Government in Victoria, but by members of the late
Government in Victoria, that it would be very
grateful to them if the Hon. William Shiels, notwith-
standing that the number of delegates allotted to
each colony would be exceeded, could still be allowed
to sit in the Convention with the understanding that
he would not vote in any division. The reason for
conceding this much to Victoria is to me very obvious.
By some oversight when the delegates were elected
by Parliament, there was, I believe, no member of
the Government elected beside the Prime Minister,
Mr. Munro, and unless Mr. Shiels be allowed the
privilege of remaining upon the understanding that
he will not take part in the voting, the Prime Minister
of Victoria will be left without a colleague in his
government, and it seems on that account reasonable
if the Convention can concede so much that Mr.
Shiels should be allowed to remain upon the condition
I suggest, notwithstanding that the roll has now been
signed by the late attorney-general, who was formally
appointed as one of the delegates. With regard to
voting, perhaps I may be permitted to say, as the
question arises now, that it is my fervent trust that
there will be no voting throughout the sittings of this
Convention. Unless we can by some manner or other
come to an agreement without dividing, the ayes to
the right and the noes to the left of the chair, there
will be less prospect of ultimate concord in our views.
I trust that after a fair comparison of our views, and
that fair conflict of reason which is one of the chief
objects of the present debate, we shall contrive to
come to our conclusions without being divided by
direct voting for the ayes and for the noes. But my
object now is to ask the assent of the Convention to
Mr. Shiels remaining, on the condition that he will
not take part in any voting that may arise.
Mr. ABBOTT: At an earlier stage of our proceed-
ings, I intended to direct the attention of the Con-
vention to the fact of Mr. Shiels being here at all.
It was only out of courtesy, I take it, to the present
Government of Victoria that he was allowed to take
a seat in the Convention when he did, and I think
the suggestion now made, that he should be allowed
to take a seat here, without any powers and privileges
whatever, is not reasonable or warranted by the cir-
cumstances. We have not to consider political
changes which may have taken place in other colonies,
and which have led to the head of the present Admin-
istration in Victoria being without one of his law
advisers. When the election of delegates to this
Convention was made by the Victorian legislature,
that legislature should have taken all these matters
into consideration, and the inconvenience of there
not being a law adviser of the incoming government
here, rests, not with the Convention or with the late
administration in Victoria, but entirely with the
legislature. I admit that it would have been well
had the Premier of Victoria had with him some law
officer ; but as the legislature itself, which created
the delegates, did not say that he should be placed
in that position, I think it would be very improper
indeed for this Convention to allow any gentleman
to sit among us who would be legally a stranger to
us. If this position be conceded to Mr. Shiels, why
should not the gentlemen who represent the Opposi-
tion party in our own legislature claim the right to
have a legal adviser sitting with them ? On the first
day on which the Convention sat, when I saw Mr.
Shiels enter the chamber and take his seat, it was my
intention to direct the attention of the Convention
to the fact that, in my opinion, he had no legal right
to be here ; but some of the delegates pointed out to
me that it would appear discourteous to the Victorian
Government to take the objection, and for that reason
I abstained. New South Wales and Victoria —I do
not know whether the step was taken in the other
colonies—on the eve of the prorogation of their
parliaments, passed a resolution which was moved by
leave without notice. On the 18th December, for
instance, in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, on
the motion of Mr. Shiels himself, the following
resolution was passed :
That during the absence of any representative of this
colony on the National Convention to be held in Sydney in
March, 1891, or in the event of any vacancy by death,
resignation, or otherwise on such representation, the Governor,
with the advice of the Executive Council, is hereby em-
powered to appoint a member of the Legislative Council or
the Legislative Assembly, as the case may be, to act as
representative of this colony on such Convention, or to fill
such vacancy.


A similar resolution was moved and passed here with
the exception that no provision was made for the
absence of any representative. It appears to me
that the resolution I have read is so broad that if
Mr. Shiels could come in under a general commission
and take the seat of Mr. Wrixon, who was absent for
a few days when the Convention met, it would be
quite proper for him to come in and take the seat of
any gentleman representing Victoria who might be
absent for one day or one hour. The commission
itself appears to me a most informal document,
inasmuch as it contemplates a vacancy which had not
arisen. It is dated, 1 find, on the 24th February,
whereas the Convention did not sit until the 2nd of
March. At the time of its issue, therefore, there
could have been no vacancy upon the Convention.
Notwithstanding that a general commission was
issued to Mr. Shiels to take a seat as a delegate by
reason of the absence of any representative, I take
it that the Assembly of Victoria and the Assembly
of this colony never contemplated that any person
should hold a general commission to take a seat hero
whenever a vacancy occurred. That, however, may
be beside the question ; but I strongly object to any
gentleman being allowed to sit in this Convention, he
himself not being a delegate. If Mr. Munro wishes
to consult this gentleman, and I admit that it is
highly inconvenient for the Premier of the neighbour-
ing colony not to have, as one of his colleagues, one
of the law officers of the Government, there are
means by which he can consult with him. Mr. Shiels
will be admitted to any one of the rooms in the
precincts of the chamber, and can in that way obtain
access to Mr. Munro; but I protest against his
sitting in the Convention when he is not a member
of it.
Mr. Munro : The President correctly stated the
case when he mentioned that it was not I who
brought this matter under his notice. I have not
interfered in the matter, either directly or indirectly.
The President : If the hon. member will pardon
me for a moment, I think it is right to say that the
matter was brought under my notice by the Hon.
Henry John Wrixon, the late Attorney-General of
Victoria.
Mr. Munro : What I wish to say is this; that I
know Mr. Shiels would not take a seat upon the
Convention unless he were invited to do so by the
unanimous yote of its members. An objection being
now raised, it is quite understood that Mr. Shiels
would not, under the circumstances, take a seat upon
the Convention.
FEDEEAL CONSTITUTION.
FOURTH day’s debate.
Debate resumed on resolutions proposed by Sir
Henry Parkes (vide page 11).
Colonel SMITH: I hope, sir, it will not be con-
sidered out of place if I, as one of the oldest members
of the Parliament of Victoria, offer to you my congratu-
lations upon the position you now occupy. I think I
am uttering, not only my own sentiments, but also
those of every member of the Convention, when I
express the hope that you will live sufficiently long
to see the consummation of the work which has
been so well begun, and that you will be in a position
to advise those w r ho are intrusted with the working
of the new constitution when it comes into operation.
1 intend in my observations to follow the example
so well set by the premiers of several of the colonies,
notably the Premier of Victoria and the Premier'of
South Australia, in making my remarks as brief as
possible. Now, I have been considering since the
debate began, that one fact, that is, that every
speaker who has addressed the Convention has taken
it as a matter settled, as a question that has been
disposed of, that is, that we have met, not for the
purpose of considering whether we shall have federa-
tion or not, but to settle the terms on which
federation shall be carried out. That is a very
pleasing fact, because, as far as 1 have been able to
ascertain, there has been no particular enthusiasm
amongst the people of the various colonies on the
question. When the resolutions passed by the con-
ference in Melbourne had permeated the whole of
the colonies, no public meetings were held in
opposition to those resolutions, and, therefore, I take
it, as far as I am concerned, we are not here to deal
with the preliminary question as to the expediency
of federation. I feel, as other gentlemen have felt
in addressing this Convention, that the proposal has
been accepted by Australia, provided that the
terms which we are met to settle will be just and
equitable to each colony. Therefore, I now intend
merely to address myself to three questions : First,
defence; second, the fiscal question ; and third, the
powers of the new senate which it is proposed shall
be created. With regard to the question of defence,
whether we do or not come to real, sterling, and
settled terms, 1 hope we shall take into consideration
the subject of defence. I venture to say that we
would not occupy the position we do to-day if it had
not been for that question, because I believe it was
the report of Major-General Edwards to you, sir,
that induced you to take the prominent and active
part that you have taken in bringing this Convention
into existence, and in urging the various colonies to
join, not only for the purpose of defence, but for
fiscal union, and all the other general purposes for
which dominions are established. I have been a
volunteer officer myself for about a quarter of a
century, although I have not had the advantage
enjoyed by the hon. member, Captain Eussell, of
seeing much active service. Still, I have ascertained
sufficient to enable me to judge properly as to the system
that ought to be adopted with regard to the defences
of Australia. I thought it my duty before coming to
this Convention to ask for the opinions of officers of
the forces in the colony I represent. I have in my
possession a document which I intend to get printed,
in order to present it to each member of the Con-
vention, It is not exactly a report, but more of a
memorandum, by a very old naval officer in Victoria,
Captain Fullerton, who has command of the Naval
Brigade there. I believe that some of the suggestions
therein contained will commend themselves to the
judgment of members of the Convention, because,
whatever else we do, if the colonies, leaving New
Zealand out of the question at present, do not join
freely and promptly, they will be comparatively help-
less without any general scheme of defence. I believe
that in this memorandum will be found a scheme which
will carry out the idea expressed by the hon, member,
Mr. Deakin, that is, that we should have a standing
army consisting of the smallest possible number, but
which could be enlarged at any time when required.
Such a scheme would commend itself to the judgment
of all the people of Australasia. If federation is
carried out we shall have a population of more than
3,600,000 people. It is not suggested that we should
have more than one soldier out of every one hundred
of population, which would give us a standing army
of 36,000 men who would be under control at the one
time. Considering that we have in the colonies 600,000
men of what is called the soldier’s age, that is, between
the ages of 20 and 45, who, in an emergency, could
be called upon to undergo a reasonable amount of
drill and be called upon to serve if required, the mere
knowledge of such a fact will constitute in itself a
very important defence. Ido not wish to dwell largely
on this point, except that I hope the Convention will
think it of sufficient importance to appoint a com-
mittee not so much for the purpose of bringing up an
exhaustive report as to collect the evidence which the
various members of the Convention may have in their
possession on the subject. The committee I suggest
could bring up a report with regard to the insertion


of a special clause in tlie constitution act, which we
are here for the purpose of preparing. I have heard
many members, of the Convention say that they are
free-traders. Now, I feel bound to say, as represent-
ing one of the largest constituencies in Yictoria, not
only a large mining constituency, but a manufacturing
constituency
Mr. Cuthbert : Where ?
Colonel SMITH: A place called Ballarat. I
thought the bon. member, Mr. Cuthbert, knew that
place, as he has lived there for thirty years, but per-
haps he only knows part of the constituency and not
the whole. I am a protectionist from conviction, the
same as you, sir, are a free-trader from conviction,
and I have a duty to perform, that is, to see that if
this question of federation is settled it shall be done
in a way which will be just and equitable to the
colony I represent, as well as to the other colonies
which may join. Under these circumstances, I read
with very great interest the report of the speeches
that were delivered in the conference at Melbourne
last year, I was very much surprised to find that
whenever any member of that conference approached
the fiscal question he appeared to fight shy of it. It
reminded me very much of the sword dance which I
have seen on one or two occasions on St. Andrew’s
Day, when the performers seemed to be very much
afraid of touching the real question, without the
settlement of which the labours on any conference
are hopeless. That is to say, unless there is some
reasonable settlement in connection with those in-
terests which have sprung up in Yictoria and in other
colonies—which are springing up in South Australia as
well as in this colony of New South Wales —and unless
some reasonable guarantee is given to the people in
those colonies that their interests are not to be sacrificed
—unless some reasonable compromise is arranged on
that question—l doubt very much whether I shall be
able to persuade my constituents to join a federation
of the kind proposed. I want hon. members who
intend to address the Convention to say if they are
able to meet that difficulty. I want them to explain
how it will be just and equitable to Yictoria if the
millions of money (I am speaking within the mark)
which have been invested in manufactures there are
to be sacrificed, it may be at one fell swoop, without
any notice whatever. That would not be just and
equitable to the small colony of Victoria. As I have
said, at the previous conference all the members
fought shy of that question except one hon. member,
to whom I give credit for plunging into the arena
and striking right and left, without any mercy. I
refer to the Premier of South Australia, Mr. Play-
ford. Most of all he struck the small colony of Vic-
toria for erecting what he termed barriers. Let me
tell him that in my judgment South Australia has
everything to gain from Yictoria, while Yictoria has
very little to gain from South Australia. If there
is any danger, although I do not think there is much
danger, to be feared by South Australia, it will not
come from Yictoria, but from a much more powerful
neighbour —from a colony teeming with natural re-
sources, with a large population ; a colony which
possesses not only great natural resources, but also
the one commodity which gives command to a large
extent of all manufacturing industries. I allude to
the black diamonds of Newcastle. Everyone knows
that coal is as the breath of life to manufacturing
enterprise all the world over. As far as Victoria is
concerned, we are prepared to risk whatever danger
there may be. We are prepared to enter into fair,
reasonable, and friendly competition with any of the
colonies. Speaking for my district, we entertain
the most friendly and kindly feeling towards our
mother colony. I know Ballarat boys all over
Sydney, and most of them are doing very well. There
is no doubt that the inhabitants of these colonies are
being bound together by that crimson thread of
which sr oU} a i r> spoke when addressing yourself to
this subject in Melbourne—with the strongest and
best of all ties—the ties of respect, love, and affec-
tion. Yictoria will be quite willing to risk all the
consequences of this union, and of removing all the
barriers between the various colonies, provided first
that it is dealt with in a just and equitable manner.
That is the point to which I wish hon. members to
come. We are prepared for compromise; but the
compromise must not be all on the one side. You
must not expect us to give everything, and get nothing
in return. We are prepared to give and take to a
fair and reasonable extent; but the federation must
be on such terms that our people will not be sacri-
ficed. Our people, who have been building up
industries, in many instances in the face of enormous
difficulties, cannot be lightly sacrificed in any arrange-
ment which may ultimately be arrived at. I have
strong hopes that the members of this Convention, as
a whole, will adopt the policy which has already been
adopted in every country which has federated. In
America we know the extremes to which protection
has gone. What has been the result p I find from
statistics that the United States is already producing
more iron in a raw state than is Great Britain. She
is already producing nearly half as much again of
Bessemer steel as Great llritain produces; she is
already producing nearly twice as many steel rails
as are produced in Great Britain; and, besides,
under her protective system, the United States not
only feeds her own people, but she also sends enormous
quantities of surplus produce to all parts of the
world. Twenty-six per cent, of her population are
engaged in agricultural pursuits, and they grow one-
fourth of the whole produce of the world. Twenty-
three per cent, of the population are engaged in
manufactures ; so that, taking the population of the
United States at 60,000,000, we find that there are
15,000,000 engaged in agricultural pursuits, and
about 14,000,000 in manufacturing pursuits. The
result is that the United States at this moment is
in advance of the whole civilised world with regard
to agricultural produce and manufactures. I will
take as another example the Germanic empire.
Before the Germans federated they had a very loose
fiscal system; but in the year 1879, eleven years
ago, they established a strong protective tariff. In
the years 1878-79 their revenue from customs was
less than £6,000,000, In the year 1889, ten years
afterwards, their revenue from customs had risen from
£6,000,000 to £26,000,000, while the revenue from
railways, post and telegraphs, and other sources, had
increased nearly twofold. In every part of the
empire new life, and spirit, and enterprise were
infused. And now I come to the most recent
example: that is Canada. After federation, the
very first thing -which the Dominion did was to
establish protection against the rest of the world,
while trade between the various colonies was made
perfectly free, as we propose to make it to-day. In
1879, the very same year that the Germanic empire
established its protectionist policy, Canada imposed
a strong protective tariff, imposing duties from 12
per cent, to 20 per cent, on imports, and on some
manufactured goods it was as high as 35 per cent.
The result was that the internal resources of Canada
have been developed to a high degree, and produc-
tion in almost every branch has been inci'eased to an
enormous extent. I quote these facts to show that
every portion of the world that has entered into
federation has almost invariably adopted the same
fiscal policy. We must remember that Yictoria and
South Australia have established protective policies.
I was very glad to hear the following statement made
by Sir Thomas Mcllwraith in his speech last week :
We must proceed on the supposition that there will be
free-trade amongst the various colonies and protection against
the world. I believe the opinion of the colonies in general
is that this would be a good national Australian policy, and
it is one in which I thoroughly believe.


I was very pleased, indeed, to hear such a statement
made by a representative from the great colony of
Queensland, and from a gentleman occupying the posi-
tion that the hon. member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith,
occupies there. That is a policy in which I thoroughly
believe also ; and before this debate closes I should
like to hear some leading gentlemen, who may hold
partially or wholly the views which I hold on this
question, explain to us in what way Victoria is to be
treated if she is to be treated justly and equitably in
dealing with this question. 1 shall now pass from
this branch of the subject, because I think I have
stated fairly, though briefly, the salient points as they
affect the colony of Victoria. Considering the state-
ment made by Sir Thomas Mcllwraith on behalf of
Queensland, and the fact that South Australia has
adopted a similar policy, I think we shall find that if
we are to come to a fair and equitable settlement of
this question, the case, as I have put it, will have to
be considered. But my hope is this: In consulta-
tion with some of my friends I thought that if we
sent to the senate a bill, part of which was for the
purpose of establishing free-trade and doing away
with the existing barriers between the different
colonics, and another part was for the adoption
of a fiscal system, that that measure being, as
it were, a money bill, there would be no inter-
ference with it on the part of the senate. But
on the last day we met, almost every delegate who
rose in his place advocated co-ordinate powers for
the senate, and the member who led off in this direc-
tion with great ability was Sir Samuel Griffith.
AVhat did that hon. member say ? lie said that we
could not free the existing barriers between the
colonies and do without the revenue thus provided
until we had first established a fiscal system ; and I
venture to say that must be the case. We cannot
abolish the revenues we are now receiving until we
have provided something in their place. Therefore,
I take it that before the dominion parliament could
deal with the question of freeing the barriers the
fiscal policy would first have to be dealt with, because
revenue would have to be provided. Therefore, I
hope that the question may be dealt with in that way.
As far as Victoria is concerned, I venture to express
the opinion that we are quite prepared that the
borders shall be free if a reasonable amount of pro-
tection against the rest of the world is first placed
upon the statute-book. That is the policy of Canada ;
it is the policy of America, and also of the Germanic
empire, and it ought to be our policy. Ido not ask
for any particular condition beyond this ; I have no
right to stand here in this Convention and say that
we will join and go hand in hand with you, except on
terms that are just and equitable to the colony I
represent. I put that in a fair and common-sense
way to every delegate present. I only hope that
hon. members will deal with this question fairly. I
know there are difficulties about the senate, and
without desiring to force upon the Convention any
views of mine, I should like to add my quota to the
solution of the difficulty. The senate will probably
consist of about nine representatives from each
colony. Western Australia can take its nine, and
Tasmania can take its nine, because the senate should
not be a body which wuuld simply say we will accept
this, or we will not accept it. It should be a sort of
judicial convention, something more in the character
of a body of advice, and I would suggest that instead
of being elected from the general body of the electors
in the different colonies, which would be a very costly
proceeding, they should be elected by the two houses
of each parliament. Take the colonies of Victoria,
New South Wales, or Western Australia, and divide
them each into nine electorates, how could any man
possibly contest a seat in such an extensive electorate
except at an enormous cost ? Ido not think that the
body which is to be over all the other parliaments
should be constituted in that way. I think that each
colony should bring its two houses of parliament
together, and that they should elect the members of
the senate. This would not be a costly proceeding,
and though the number of electors, so to speak,
would be small, still the senate would virtually be
the elected of the people, as we are in this Convention.
We are the elect of the elect, and they would also be
the elect of the elect of the various colonies. I think
that is one solution of the difficulty. If this question
is to be satisfactorily settled, we must endeavour to
find remedies for the difficulties that are involved.
The hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, raised a
number of difficulties, but he did not suggest a way
out of them—not very clearly—and I have gone over
his speech very carefully. But ha did say this: that
before we canabolish our present revenue we must rase
some other revenue. That w r as practically what the
hon. gentleman said, if not in those words. The Pre-
mier of South Australia, Mr. Playford, raised another
difficulty. He pointed out that perhaps two colonies —
this was another shot at Victoria, which I hope we shall
get over —he pointed out that New South Wales and
Victoria might join together and form a government,
ignoring all the other colonies. That appeared to mo
to be a very fair and reasonable objection to take, and
having thought the matter out I think I can with
due respect offer a solution here also. If the dominion
parliament is to have a career of great usefulness, and
give satisfaction to all the colonies, it ought to be a
thoroughly representative body, and I see no objection
to imposing the condition that each colony should
have at least one representative in the government.
Tasmania should have one, and Western Australia
one ; and, perhaps, we might concede two to South
Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales. A govern-
ment so formed would not be a very large one, and
would consist only of about nine members. We
were told by the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, that the
dominion must be established on the old and broad
lines of the English Constitution, that we must have
party in the dominion just the same as we have party
in the different colonies. Now, I think it worth
while considering whether we should not adopt some
modification of the party system of government
and say, that as the representative house in the
dominion is to be elected by the people in the various
colonies —I suppose the representation would be
somewhat in proportion to jjopulation —the senate
and the house of representatives should join together
and elect a government for three years. Surely that
is an experiment that might be tried without much
danger. Why should we have a party government
in the dominion parliament ?W hy should not a
government be elected to last for three years, a fresh
election to take place at the end of that period P I
do not see the slightest necessity for creating two
hostile parties in the dominion parliament. We look
to that body to exercise cool, calm, and deliberate
judgment on every public question coming before it,
and we should not so constitute it that its time would
be occupied in fighting about who should be in office
and who should not. As far as the dominion parlia-
ment is concerned, I think the system of party
fighting might be obviated. I trust that those hon.
members of the Convention who may follow me will
think this matter over. As far as I am personally
concerned, I shall be very pleased indeed to find any
better solution of the difficulties mentioned than
those I have pointed out. Before sitting down I
trust I shall not be considered intrusive if I mentioned
that some years ago I had the pleasure, during one of
my visits to New Zealand—where I have been some
half dozen times for the improvement of my health—
of hearing the veteran statesman who is now present
amongst us, Sir George Grey, deliver an address on
a public platform in Auckland. Sir George on that
occassion made some suggestions with reference to
the former policy of the old country with regard to
the islands adjacent to Australia, and I hope that


before this debate closes the hon, member will, to
some extent, repeat the views I then heard him
express. I can only, in conclusion thank the members
of the Convention for the courteous attention they
have given to my remarks.
Sir GEOEGE GEEY: It is with feelings almost
of awe that I rise to speak before an assembly
gathered from all parts of Australia upon so vast and
important a subject as that which occupies our
attention this day. I think that our proper duty in
forming a representative constitution is to begin at
the lowest body from which that constitution is to be
built up —that is, the people at large. I think our
duty is first rather to consider the constitutions of
the several colonies of Australia, and to devise from
those a perfect form of constitution for such states
as may join the general government. It is only by
winning over persons to a consciousness that great
advantages will accrue to them from entering into a
confederation of this kind, that we can possibly hope
to attract colonies of diverse views to join in a great
confederation, which will render the whole one of
the most important bodies in the world. I was very
much struck lately when Sir Henry Loch, the new
governor, visited all the states in South Africa, and
amongst others, he visited British Kaffraria, and
there he found a strong desire for a federation
throughout not only Kaffir land, but all the European
states ; but great difficulties presented themselves in
bringing this about. What struck me as really
admirable was that the Kaffirs gave an account of
how they were drawn on gradually to like the British
Government and the British Crown, For years they
had been the greatest enemies of Great Britain; for
years they had waged wars with us, subjecting the
empire to a vast expense. But they met Sir Henry
Loch, and they told him :
We cherish great expectations from meeting with your
Excellency in this way ; for on the last occasion wc stood
before a governor in this manner, that meeting was followed
by pleasant repose, by blessings, and other privileges which
went far to open the eyes of many, who behold things, as it
were, with a clearer vision. Thus were the native people
drawn more towards her Majesty’s beneficent sway. We
receive you therefore, with hopes and with joy.
And they w r ent on to say that the blessings they had
received from the Queen, had made the South African
natives generally, not only in Kaffraria, but in every
part of the colony, feel for her Majesty devotion and
affection, which devotion and affection they would
transfer for the time being to her governor. That
address was delivered by 8,000 Kaffirs, 3,000 of whom
were mounted men. They pledged their faith to the
British Government, and why ? —because they had
derived great benefits from it.’ And I believe that it
is only by holding out such inducements to the
various states of Australia that we can possibly lead
them all to join in one great and strong confedera-
tion. Well, then we have to consider what are the
blessings we should obtain for them, and the first
thing I say is this: that I believe it is the duty of
this Convention to see that the states get a constitu-
tion which will enable them whenever they please to
reform their own constitution and to create it for
themselves. That is really the main point, and that
is very simply done. If we give them first an elective
lieutenant-governor, and then see that their two
houses of legislature are each made elective and re-
sponsible to the people, they then can frame precisely
w hat constitution they please from time to time, and
in that respect exercise the privileges enjoyed by the
United States of North America. These may seem
very wide privileges to give, but I have only to say
this, that those w T ho will study the original constitu-
tion of New r Zealand will find that in point of fact
each one of the provinces had in law, granted by the
British Parliament, the right to make its own
Constitution of exactly the nature it pleased, and to
vary it from time to time. It will be very easy,
therefore, for us to see that like privileges are con-
ferred upon the Australian states, and I have no
hesitation in saying that if we do not do that, even if
they join you, some of them will have years of conflict
before they will obtain a Constitution suited to their
wishes. They have had nothing hitherto to do with
framing their own Constitutions. These rest on acts
of a distant parliament; their voice was but little
heard. For example, in New Zealand we had promised
to us by one ministry a Constitution of the utmost
liberality. The states elected their own super-
intendents who were virtually lieutenant-governors.
But the simple name of superintendent being given
disarmed parliament at home and they did not hesi-
tate to give to the superintendents chosen by the
people powers which they would not give to Canada, or
did not give to Canada, when the superintendents
were called lieutenant-governors, without having the
great powers which the superintendents in New
Zealand had. But the lieutenant-governors were not
allowed to be elected by the people of Canada. Now,
I say that on the present great and momentous occa-
sion which has brought us here we have the power of
giving to the states a constitution of the kind which
1 speak of. I think we ought to give them that, and
then let them frame their own constitution as they
please from time to time, so that they will possess
all the powers of local self-government which men
could possibly desire to have. Then you have this to
guide you: the British Parliament has already con-
sented, and in one instance for nearly twenty years,
I think, those powers were exercised and were never
abused. You thus see that not only can } r ou get the
right from the same parliament which gave it before,
but there is every possibility and every probability
that powers so given will not be abused in Australia
any more than they remained safe and intact from all
abuse when intrusted to the people of New Zealand.
Now, proceeding from that point to the question of
the Constitution we are required to frame and to
submit for the consideration of the people of Aus-
tralia, we are met at first, perhaps, apparently by
greater difficulties —that is, we have to define what
are to be the powers of the states and what are to be
the powers of the federal government. We have two
bodies to deal with. But I think we can very easily
overcome those difficulties. First, I think that this
must inevitably be done —we must not imitate the
United States in saying that the states are to be
paramount —that they are to be the sole possessors
of power, .and that then they, from these paramount
powers which they possess, are to delegate such powers
as they please to the general assembly, or congress, or
senate, or whatever you may please to term it, because
the inevitable result of that will probably be, that a
time will arrive in which„there will be some question,
such as slavery was in the United States, which wilt
disturb the minds of the people at large. Perhaps
the great majority of the states may desire to have a
general law, either to regulate or to abolish an insti-
tution of the kind, or some similar institution, and
the minority of the states may refuse to agree to that,
and thereupon a deadlock would take place, and
nothing could be done. At last the majority would
determine that the majority should prevail; but
then the difficulty would be that the majority could
only prevail by breaking the law. In the minds
of all English-speaking people, there is a respect
for the law which makes them hate to see it vio-
lently broken or set aside. In that manner to the
minority of states would become attracted a part of
those who might think with the majority upon the
general subject but who would not join in what they
conceived to be an unlawful attack upon the Consti-
tution of the country. The result would be that
parties would become more equal, and, probably,
nothing less than a civil war would end a question
which might easily, perhaps, have been settled by dif-
ferent legal arrangements. I think, therefore, it will


bo our bounden duty to see that the general assembly
is not only endowed with certain powers which the
states cannot exercise, but also that an addition bo
made, as was done in the New Zealand Constitution,
to this effect: that whenever the general assembly of
the country, or the congress of the country, chooses
to legislate upon any subject, that subject is added
to those subjects which have been withdrawn from
the power of the different states.
Mr. FitzGerald : No!
Sir GEOEGE GEEY: If that is not done, of
course we act against experience. I hearhon. gentle-
men say “No”; but they must recollect that it was
foreseen that dire results would follow from the adop-
tion of another system, and that those dire results did
follow, and with that example before us, it appears
very doubtful if we ought not, pursuing the course
of wisdom, to take steps which will prevent a repeti-
tion of the disasters which took place in the United
States. Some other plan of doing it may be devised;
but the object should be attained in some way or
other without subjecting ourselves to the chances of
future great disaster. I need not go at length into
the different subjects which I think should be sub-
mitted to the power of the general assembly or the
congress. Those can be all easily adjusted, I think,
probably without any great dissension amongst our-
selves. I believe that no trouble at all will arise
upon that head ; but it will be essentially necessary
that the point should be considered with very great
care. Now, it may be said, perhaps, that in England
they arc little prepared to consider this subject for
us, if it is to be carried out by act of parliament;
but I should tell hon. gentlemen that they little
know the care which British statesmen have in some in-
stances bestowed upon the consideration of the affairs
of these colonies. Eor instance, we had the Premier
of Great Britain, the Marquis of Salisbury, when a
younger son of the late Marquis, out in New Zea-
land, studying our constitution there with the great-
est care —not the one that was then perfected, but
the one which it w r as thought wmuld be bestowed upon
New Zealand. He lived with me for several months,
and the business that had been transacted in the day
was gone through by him and myself in the evenings
thatwespenttogether. Every matter was discussed, the
reasons for each step taken were examined, arguments
were held upon both sides, and ho devoted his mind
as carefully to a study of these questions as if he had
been a New Zealander, and the member of the Gov-
ernment who had to consider what w r as best to be
done for the country. And his was not a solitary
instance in that respect. Other British statesmen
have been out here directing their attention to these
very questions. Only recently you have had here a
young man, now a member of the House of Peers,
who spent at least one year and a half studying every
question connected with New Zealand, who then
came on to Australia, and visited every one of these
colonies, and devoted considerable care and attention
to their exact position, the state of their legislation,
and all that they had acquired ; and who, then, went
on to the United States and Canada, and repeated the
same thing there, and, when perfectly educated upon
all these points, returned home to take his seat in the
House of Peers, and to stand the friend of these com-
munities whenever difficult questions arose. Now,
with men of that kind to take our part, I think there
is great safety for us in reference to the steps which
the British Parliament will take in regard to our re-
quests. And that brings me to another point which,
I fear, will give rise to some difference of opinion-in
this great assembly, and in which I may not carry
people with me ; but I believe in my own mind that
it is essential to you that every one of your officers
should be elected by the people of this country.
Even in the case of your governor-general I believe
the people ought to have the right of choosing who
that man shall be.- Let them choose him from Eng-
land if they please; let them choose him from any
part of the world, I would almost say, if they pleased.
They will choose well, they will choose wisely, and no
nation can be perfect —unless an imperial nation —a
young offset, as we should be, of an imperial nation,
we should not be perfect, unless the people had every
office open to their ambition, and unless it were known
that the really great and good men of the country could
risa to the highest position, and exercise the highest
duties in it. Why, if as is the doctrine at the present
time, and I admit that it has been successfully
exercised —very successfully exercised in regard to
these colonies —if the doctrine is that as far as
possible the sons of peers should be sent out here to
lie educated as to the affairs of the colonies in order
that they may act w r isely in the legislative body at
home—l say that if such an education is necessary
and of great advantage then to shut out our own
people from an education of the kind, and to say that
no man in Australia shall have an advantage of the
sort is an act of absolute cruelty to the people of
Australia—it is to cramp their energies, to deprive
them of the highest education of all, and it is an act
of -which we ought not to be guilty towards our
fellow-countrymen. Then I would say to this
assembly, do not be led away by the idea that the
nomination of governor is the only tie that binds us
to Great Britain. If we send home a great portion
of our laws for the Queen’s assent is not that to bind
us to Great Britain in the most solemn way ?Is not
that to say that the sovereign of Great Britain is as
absolutely a member of our legislature here as she is
of the legislature at home? Her representative, who
wmuld be chosen by the people, wmuld in her name
open and close the parliaments and perform all those
functions, but he wmuld be a man chosen by our-
selves, and our own people wmuld be educated in the
highest possible manner to discharge their duty to
their country. For it is not only the man who is
fortunate enough to attain the highest position w r ho
wull educate himself to the greatest point that he can,
but every one who aimed at the office would be
endeavouring to prepare himself for it —numbers of
men wmuld be educated to a point to which they never
wmuld otherwise be educated unless you opened such
objects to their ambition. If it were thought neces-
sary to bind us still further to Great Britain Ido
not see why we, instead of having agents-general,
should not have members of the Privy Council at
home. I do not at all know why w r e should not send
home an officer who wmuld conduct our business with
the Queen directly, exactly as the Secretary of State
for Ireland conducts the business of Ireland with
the Queen, or as that officer in the House of Commons
who really manages Scotch affairs, and who manages
them as if he wmre a secretary of state, conducts the
business of Scotland. I believe it would be of the
greatest possible advantage to the colonies that such
an officer should reside in England instead of having
agents-general there, because he wmuld become
personally known to his sovereign, and to the leading
men in England, and friendships would be formed
and an education given from time to time as these
men were changed. I apprehend that they would
probably only fill the office for two or three years.
There would be a constant change, and I believe that
in that way a large proportion of your population
would be again educated in the best possible manner.
These must seem almost too daring speculations ; but,
in point of fact, wm are marching on to an altogether
new epoch, to new times, and the very essence of the
constitution must be this: I heard one hon. gentleman
here state that wm must remember that we are legis-
lating for the future; and I agree with him if he
meant that wm are legislating in such a manner as to
enable the future to legislate for itself —that it is our
object that freedom in every respect shall be given,
so that as each generation comes on they shall say,
“ Blessed be those ancestors of ours who have left


ns this freedom, so that nothing can take place—
no changes in the state of the world —but we
possess all powers to define the measures most
necessary to bring peace and tranquility at every
epoch it comes on." That is the real duty which
we should aim to fulfil; and it is only by allowing
the people to speak, and at all times to declare
their views and their wishes, and to have them care-
fully considered, that we can insure peace, tran-
quility, and prosperity to each country in each suc-
cessive epoch of time as it arrives. How, having
given these general views upon your general assembly
I need go no further. It does not much matter in
what kind of way on the first occasion you allow
elections to take place, if the people have the power
of altering that whenever they like. All these
things become quite minor questions if you just hold
in view these several matters, that the states—each
state —shall have the power of modifying its form of
government whenever it likes; that, for instance,
neither the states nor the general body is to be told
that " you must conduct your form of government
according to the principles of what they call a res-
ponsible ministry." Why should that be told to
them? Why not let them conduct their form of
government precisely as each age chooses? Who
can tell what political inventions are yet to be made ?
Why, the principle of representation, as we enjoy it,
is, comparatively speaking, a modern discovery, and
the principle of federation has not developed yet.
We are the people for the first time to give it a new
form, if we please. We can develop it to a higher
point than it has ever been raised to yet. It is an
invention ; but, as is the case with electricity, day by
day better modes will be found for administering it
—better means for making it useful to men. We
now, as I say, take one step, and in taking that step
let us open the road to all future steps. Let that be
our care —to lead on ; let us march into the wide
track of improving all these institutions ; let us lead
on, and you will find that grateful nations will
follow, and we shall discover that we had known
nothing, although we now think we know so much —
so great will be the changes which will occur, so
great will be the inventions which will be made.
Then there is one other thing that lies very near my
mind. Let us remember this. In my youth it was
said that men of different religious faiths could not
sit in the same legislature together, and they were
excluded—Jews, Catholics, Nonconformists—nobody
it was thought but members of the Church of Eng-
land could form a legislative body that was of any
use at all. To leaven them with other material was
to spoil the whole thing. But it was found that that
was a great mistake ; that men of different religious
faiths could sit side by side in the same legislature ;
that talent and ability can be drawn forth from any
religious opinions whatever. The nation has pro-
gressed more than ever it has done before in so short
a period of time ; and its happiness and tranquility
are greater. Now, I think we should establish this
principle in reference to federation. Let us say that
if the English-speaking people choose to federate in
one great body we shall not ask what that form of
government is. In the same body could sit men who
hail from a republic, and men who hail from a mon-
archy. Take the case of South Africa, where there
are two republics. We might have federation in a
wonderful degree if that rule were laid down, and
surely if seven or eight states there met together to
consult for the common good of South Africa, and
to make a law which would be beneficial to the whole
of them, it could matter very little whether the re-
presentatives of two states came from republics in-
stead of from a monarchy as in the case of the other
states. Equally well can they advise upon that
which is good for the whole —equally well can they
care for their fellow-countrymen, speaking the same
language, with laws identical in all respects—
equally well can they care for them, whether
the head of the government is called a presi-
dent, or whether, as in our case, we rejoice to
live under so great and good a Queen. What differ-
ence can it make? We should be the first to lead
on in that great improvement, and to say this : " Now,
the federation of all English-speaking people may
take place ; the United States can come in with us ;
all men speaking the common tongue can meet to
debate upon what is necessary for the common
benefit." I think hon. gentlemen will feel, however
crude these doctrines may be, that there is much in
them. Remember this: that America must have a
great deal to say in regard to the Pacific Ocean.
The last speaker alluded very kindly to the idea that
was entertained years ago of federating with all the
islands of the South Pacific, and arrangements were
made by which that might be carried out. But what
was the feeling in England ? Directly it was known
that we thought of common customs duties for all
the islands —all the islands, as well as these larger
places —the moment that was thought of, and it was
seen that it afforded the means of paying one or two
European officers for the purpose of guiding a'id
directing the natives in the line of duty which they
should follow, the British Government became
alarmed, and there was a peremptory order sent out
which prevented that plan being continued. It was
finished at once. Well, not only was that the case,
but so strong was the desire then to break up the
empire—and this is a good illustration of the kind
of changes that you may have to meet, changes of
human thought—that it was determined, if possible,
to get rid of the outlying dependencies, and to
reduce the dominions of Great Britain. The Orange
River sovereignty was first thrown off. Then it was
contemplated to throw other places off, and force
them to become republics. It was said that England
was too large ; that what you wanted was a nation—
not thinking of all these distant places —with their
minds fixed upon manufactures and commerce, manu-
facturing for the world ; it was sufficient to breed up
in your great cities a population in the last depths of
misery, but always ready to rush into manufactures
at the lowest rate of wages whenever an improve-
ment of trade took place. It was said that Britain
should confine herself to her manufactures, and to
her own immediate territories, and leave the rest of
the world to itself. But, what thought other people,
and what thought England ? Let me just give one
illustration of this. I was arranging for the federa-
tion of all South Africa—triumphantly arranging it—
certainly all the states, I believe, but one would have
joined, and that one would almost immediately after-
wards have probably come in—but when it was heard
of, the government then in power, and the opposition
at home, were alike filled with dread at such a federa-
tion as was contemplated. It was said that the man
who contemplated that was a dangerous man, and
he must be got rid of, and without a moment's
warning I was dismissed from office as Governor and
High Commissioner of the Cape. Well, there was
one person in the realm who thought differently.
Afterwards, within a few days, the ministry were put
out in consequence of a quarrel with Lord Palmer-
ston—l think it "was within twelve days—and the
first thing that was said to the new ministry was,
" That man is right; you will yet long to do what he
could have done, and you will be sorry that it was
not done; reinstate him in his position." It was the
Queen who spoke, and what was her feeling towards
her people at large ? As the Prince Consort explained
the matter to myself, they felt the necessity of
openings for the poor, for the adventurous. They
thought 110 wrongful efforts should ever be made to
extend an empire, that so long as the people of Great
Britain,urged by their indomitable energy, keptpushing
on themselves, winning new races, winning new
countries to join the great confederation of English


people, so long would it be wrong for the sovereign
to injure her people by saying they should not go to
these new homes, they should not open these new
places for commerce, that they must remain shut up
in a small and continually decreasing empire at home,
us it would have been, if the policy had been acted
upon of striking off place after place. Well, I
maintain that the hearts which conceived that con-
ception —that love for the English race —represented
the true feeling of the nation; and experience has
shown that such was the case. Here we are in New
Zealand in spite the government of the day. They
tried to stop the foundation of the colony. There
they are at the Cape of Good Hope, spreading over
the whole of the country, although the earlier settlers
were punished if they attempted to pass the Orange
River. No further spread of territory there was to
be allowed. And now you have Great Britain
grasping immense territories in Africa, probably
going even beyond her strength—such has been the
change of public opinion upon this subject. I ask
you, therefore, whether w r e, in providing for the
spread of the empire in the Pacific, whether we, in
providing for all English-speaking races coming into
the one great confederation, shall not equally now be
doing our duty to the future, as I believe that our
noble Queen, and those who thought with her—
there were really but few—thought rightly, thought
well, when they determined that the energies of the
British race should spread exactly as their instincts
moved them, and, provided they committed no
wrong upon others, should be allowed to go in and
replenish and fill up all the waste places of the
earth. These are the points which appear to me so
essentially necessary for our guidance —this policy of
letting all English-speaking people into the con-
federation, of not attempting to fetter our posterity
by any peculiar laws, of simply giving them power to
enable them to determine what laws they would live
under themselves. Holding those two main points
in view, we should, I think, accomplish all we could
possibly desire. With reference to the subject of
defence I do not like to say much. I am very
adverse to seeing a large force raised in this country;
I am very adverse to seeing a military spirit created,
which should long for war. I would rather see a
small—a very small—force, sufficient for all purposes
which can possibly occur, because I do not believe if
we enter into this confederation that we shall ever
be molested. Let me state one point. There is
intense jealousy amongst the European nations
themselves. At one time it was thought that it was
better to set up the old world in this new world.
The whole efforts of the people went to form off-
shoots of British societies, as they said. Why here,
even in this colony of New South Wales, when you
were offered free and liberal institutions, some of
your first men w r anted to set up peerages. The papers
and documents will show that. I know that in New
Zealand, in the minds of many men, similar thoughts
were entertained. A nobility was to be set up there,
in the south of New Zealand, just as much as it was
at home in England; but in spite of all that could
be done, this one feeling always pervaded these new
countries, that they would have nothing whatever to
do with those institutions of the old world; and I
say that if once you get up great military bodies here,
the whole world will, by degrees, become a series of
standing camps, as it is in Europe at the present
day. Now, look how we stand. From the
Atlantic, on the one side, back again to the
same ocean really, I may say, upon the ather
side, there lies a great space in the world in which
there is no standing army at the present day, no
preparation made for military attacks, for military
defence—the United States —with, I believe, 12,000
men to keep the Indian po])ulation down, and the
whole is at peace and repose : her young men are not
drawn into conscriptions, not prepared to be fit
victims for slaughter, not certain to be slaughtered
in some few years’ time in some obscure corner or
other, but all devoting their energies to the develop-
ment of the country, marrying, becoming farmers, or
filling different trades and professions, not shut up
in barracks, excluded from knowing what the affection
of a wife and the love of children really is. Here, a l l
are totally different, and for heaven’s sake let us keep
in our present position, and not go off into the mania
which has made Europe the nations of standing camps
which it is. I hope that that is one thing we shall
hold in view—in fact, one of the main things almost
before every other. I will not detain hon. gentlemen,
longer. I have given what 1 believe to be an outline
of a proper plan of proceeding. I will do my best to
bring the points forward in Committee, as these
questions arise. I entertain, in my own mind, a
confident belief of this : that what I have asked for,
■whether it is done now or not, will be done in Aus-
tralasia —I will not say in my lifetime, although I
have seen great changes—but I believe it will be done
in Australasia in a very short period of time. If it is
done I have a confident belief, founded upon a long
experience, that then a nation, educated in public
schools first, then educated in public life afterwards
in the world, so that the thought and care of their
fellow-men is continually before their minds—l
believe that such a nation will attain to higher pros-
perity than any other people have yet attained,
because in the United States still are many of those
things wanting in that degree of perfection in which
we may have them here ; and from the full exercise
of the faculties of self-government, and of the
management of the nation, will certainly spring pros-
perity and happiness of a kind hitherto unknown.
Mr. EUTLEDGrE: Like the honored statesman
who has just resumed his seat, it is with feelings of
diffidence amounting almost to awe that I rise in this
Convention —destined as it is to become historical in
Australasia —to say a few words upon the very
important proposals which you, sir, have submitted
as a basis for a federal constitution -which our several
parliaments have sent us here to devise. After the
many able and eloquent speeches that have been
addressed to us, it seems to me that it is almost
impossible that anything new in the way of argument
can be employed in the further discussion of your
proposals. All that one can hope to do is to refrain
from following too closely in the steps of the speakers
who have preceded, and to endeavour to avoid as
much as possible all unnecessary repetition. You
have struck, as it seems to me, the true keynote in
the first paragraph of the first series of your proposi-
tions. You say, sir;
That the powers and privileges and territorial rights of the
several existing colonies shall remain intact, except in
respect to such surrenders as may be agreed upon as
necessary and incidental to the power and authority of
the National Federal Government.
Now, sir, this is a paragraph with which I am perfectly'
certain every member of this Convention will most
cordially agree. No one can be foolish enough to
imagine that in the case of a number of colonies, with
public policies and local interests in many instances
so entirely dissimilar, it is possible for real and
enduring federation to take place unless there is an
adoption of that give-and-take system to w r hich you
so happily adverted in the course of the admirable
speech in which you moved these resolutions, which
seem to me to consist in the surrender by some of
the colonies of some of the high political privileges
and some of the almost boundless political freedom
they enjoy, in order that the well-being of the whole
of the colonies may be thereby most effectually pro-
moted. I do not think it is necessary for me or for
any other speaker to say very much with regard to the
remaining paragraphs in this first series of proposals.
There seems so far to have been remarkable unan-
imity in the treatment which the several resolutions


have received ; but it is Avhen we come to the first of
the second series of resolutions that Ave happen upon
difference of opinion. There have been some argu-
ments employed by some hon. gentlemen who have
addressed the Convention on this subject in opposi-
tion to the speech which was made by my hon. friend,
Sir Samuel Griffith, in Avliich he ventured to differ
from the proposal so broadly stated as it is in the first
resolution of the second series. Whilst there have
been several speakers who have followed in the line
Avhich you have laid down, there have been other
speakers who have adopted a different line. But
among all those AVIIO have folloAved you, sir, in the
adoption of the view you haA'e here submitted, I do
not think there are any Avhose speech deserves the
same amount of attention, or that ought to call forth
the same amount of criticism, as the speech delivered
by my hon. friend, Mr. Deakin. The speech which
that hon. gentleman delivei'ed was, I think every mem-
ber of the ConA r ention will agree, as to its manner,
magnificent; but, with regard to its matter, I shall
only say this: that it seemed to me to scarcely bear
out the very high reputation that hon. gentleman has
attained as the prince of Australian-born orators, and
as one of the foremost statesmen of these great
colonies. Now, sir, the hon. gentleman Avas extremely
dissatisfied with any attempt on the part of this Con-
vention to depart from the strict lines of the form of
constitution with which Ave are familiar in these
colonies. Lest I should do the hon. gentleman an
injustice, I shall take the liberty of reading a few
lines from his speech, delivered last Tuesday. The
hon. gentleman, in the course of his address to the
Convention, said this :
The Constitution which we now enjoy, it appears, is to be
set aside with less ceremony than one would have expected
from gentlemen who have lived under it, and have exercised
its highest powers for many years. We appear to be ready
to depart from institutions which have the sanction of
long experience, almost entirely on theoretical grounds. It is
true that hon. members have looked to the experience of other
countries ; but in doing this they have ignored some of the
most pertinent lessons of our own, which is that if we estab-
lish two chambers of equal authority, we prepare the way for
dissension, and encourage deadlocks. The constitutional
history of Victoria gives ample evidence of this.
We have this remarkable anomaly: We have the hon.
gentleman contending for the perpetuation in this
neAV federal form of constitution of that form of
government in regard to a second chamber Avith which
Ave have become familiarised in these colonies; and
yet, in the very same breath, Ave have the hon. gentle-
man deprecating in the strongest possible language
the dissensions and the deadlocks Avith AA r hich the his-
tory of the working of this very form of constitution
lias made us familiar. I want to knoAv, if a system
like this has been tried and found wanting in the case
of any of the colonies, Avhy should we perpetuate, or
endeavour to perpetuate, this system when we are
here founding a constitution which we hope, as the
hon. member, Sir George Grey, so eloquently put it,
Avill be not a constitution for the present, but a
constitution for all future time, and which will
enable the federal parliament which shall come into
existence to legislate, Avhen Ave are all dead and
gone, in the most perfectly free manner, for itself
and for the requirements of its own time. The
hon. member, Mr. Deakin, seems to me to have
fallen into the error of imagining—or at least, if one
follows his language and examines it critically, he
' seems to have fallen into the error of supposing that
what Ave are aiming at, or ought to aim at, in the
labours which have brought us together here, is to
endeavour to construct a great state that shall be a
sort of enlarged edition of one of the existing col-
onies—say, for example, the colony of Victoria. The
hon. gentleman looses sight of this fact: that we are
not here for the purpose of endeavouring to effect
an amalgamation of all the colonies—that the several
states, with their diverse interests and their diverse
claims upon the great federal government, that Ave
hope to see come into existence are not to be merged
—that we are not here to endeavour to construct a
great unity, but that we are here to endeavour, if
possible, to effect a great and lasting union of all
these colonies in which, while the voice of the whole
people, without any distinction whatever, shall be
heard in the great chamber of the people’s represen-
tatives —in the house of representatives —the voice
of the states, as distinct states, with separate claims
and separate interests, shall be heard with equal
emphasis and with equal effect in a second chamber,
which may be called the senate or the council of states,
or by whatever other name it may be designated. I
do not think that we ought for a single moment to
attempt in what we do here to obliterate in any
degree the individuality of the states which, taken as
a whole, are to form the great federation of Austral-
asia. To endeavour to do that—to destroy the
individuality of the states —seems to me to strike at
the very root of the leading principle of federation,
and if we are to have a federation that shall be some-
thing of which we could be proud —if we are to have
a federation that shall satisfy the aspirations of the
people of the several colonies whom we are here to
represent —we must have a federation that will recog-
nise that principle in the fullest and most marked
degree. Depend upon it that the people of these
colonies are not going to surrender to a mere senti-
ment of federation all the rights and privileges which
they have acquired, in many instances after very
protracted struggles, by means of separation. If I
were to read the speech of my hon. friend, Mr.
Deakin, literally, I should come to the conclusion
that what he desires to do is this : to rub out all the
lines of demarcation that separate the colonies as
they exist in Australia to-day. He said in his speech
the other day:
What is there in this artificial boundary of the Murray
River or the other artificial boundaries that divide the col-
onies of Australia from each other? What is there in these
artificial boundaries that we should allow the people to
remain separate from each other, and allow them to have a
voice in the senate of the nation which possesses—
as I hope it will possess —
co-ordinate authority in all respects, except perhaps in the
origination of money bills, with the chamber of represen-
tatives ?
He says, Why should we recognise the existence
of these imaginary boundaries?” But while I say
that it is possible to magnify this question of imagin-
ary boundaries to a disproportionate extent, yet these
imaginary boundaries mean a great deal to the
people who are included within these boundaries. If
we were to rub out these boundaries to-morrow, what
should we be? We should revert to the condition
of things which existed before any separation at all
of the several colonies from ]S r ew South Wales; and
it is because the people who inhabit these several
separate states know full well that there are benefits
to be enjoyed as the result of the separation
which they have acquired, that they will never
consent to surrender the rights and privileges, or,
at all events, the more substantial of their rights
and privileges, by obliterating all these lines of
division, by becoming amalgamated into one great
whole. If you are to have a senate which is to be
on the model which my hon. friend admires—the
model of the British Constitution —in which the
upper chamber is to be merely a body for registering
the decisions of the house of representatives, I want
to know, if that is to be the outcome of our labours,
how w r e are to have a senate which will have any
such powers as will safeguard the interests of the
state ? We know that the general tendency of the
existence of a body of that kind, which does not
possess co-ordinate powders w r ith the other branch of
the legislature, is to degenerate into feebleness.
The House of Lords, I say, with all due respect to
that august body, has degenerated into a thing that
almost merits the contempt of a great many of the


free people of the British dominions, because, while
they have all the pretensions that belong to an
ancient and aristocratic house, and all the semblance
of authority which ought to belong to men of dis-
tinguished position and rank, they are reduced to the
position of being a mere appendage to the House of
Commons ; and while they can for some years per-
haps block the onward progress of legislation, they
have no pow r er whatever to shape legislation or to
effect any beneficent object without the authority
conferred upon it by the House of Commons, with-
out the sanction of that body, and without its con-
currence. I think that that is a state of things
which w r e ought not to desire to see instituted in
connection with this proposed federation. I could
understand the arguments of my hon. friend if there
were anything in the creation of a second chamber
possessing co-ordinate authority with the low r er
chamber in regard to the amendment even of money
bills —I could understand something, I say, of his
argument if there were anything inconsistent with
true democracy in his proposition. But there is
nothing inconsistent with true democracy in it. My
hon. friend talked of authority, and the power of his
argument derived a great deal of its force from tlio
manner in which he laid stress on the rights of the
people. He combated the idea of a second chamber
having the right to veto any proposed legislation of
the lower chamber on the ground that that chamber
uttered the voice of the people, which had a right to be
heard. Will not the voice of the people be heard in a
senate which is composed of men who are as much
elected by the people, though it may be in a different
mode, as in the house of representatives itself ? The his-
tory of the various legislative councils of these
colonies is fraught with caution against the attempt
to establish anything in the shape of a second
chamber that will not rest upon the suffrages of the
people. The reason why there have been dissensions
and deadlocks in connection with the upper chambers
in the various colonies is this, that these upper
chambers have not in any respect derived their
authority from the people in the same way as the
lower chamber has. They have either not been
elected by the people at all, or else have been elected
by the people upon the basis of some special pro-
perty qualification ; and noboby can contend that a
body of that sort is a body that can be said to repre-
sent the people, or which ought to be intrusted with
powers co-ordinate with those that belong to the
other branch of the legislature. The hon. gentleman
talks about experiments. He seems to deprecate the
idea of plunging into an experiment. He seems to
think that, in the proposal that has been suggested
by my hon. and learned friend, Sir Samuel Griffith,
the motion which you, sir, have submitted with re-
gard to the second chamber, is not a motion that
should be adopted by this Convention. It seems to
be supposed that in this we are indulging in a spirit
of experiment —that we are making experiments in
legislation. I fail to see where the experimental
part comes in. It does not seem to me that there is
anything at all experimental about it. If there never
had been anything of this kind in existence before, I
could understand that there might be some ground
for the objection that is raised, that we are about to
plunge into an experiment. But America has had
the advantage of 100 years of the working of such a
system as that which has been advocated by the hon.
and learned member, Sir Samuel Griffith, and by
several other hon. gentlemen who have followed him,
of the system which finds so little favour in the-esti-
mation of the hon. member, Mr. Deakin. I dare say
hon. members have read many works written by
American authors which go to show to what a marked
extent the senate has grown in the affections of the
American people. The senate is not regarded in
America as a body which exists for the purpose of
coming into conflict with the House of Representa-
tivea, or tlie result of the peculiar constitution of
which is to constantly precipitate conflicts with the
House of Eepresentatives. The senate of the United
States of America is a body that has grown steadily
in the affections of the people of America until the
veneration which at present exists for it is almost
unbounded. Hon. gentlemen, I dare say, have read
the book, by Carnegie, called “ Triumphant Demo-
cracy.” I propose to quote a few words from that
author with regard to the senate, the powers which
it is proposed to confer upon a senate here being
somewhat similar to, though less than, the powers
conferred upon and enjoyed by the senate in America.
Mr. Carnegie says, at page 2GO :
It has been said, by more than one political writer, that
the American senate is the ideal second chamber of the
world. Some assert that it is the only second chamber which
possesses real power, and is permanently fixed in the hearts
of the masses. It is certainly regarded in America as a great
promotion to be elevated from the house to the senate, and
it is none the less certain that the entire nation regards the
senate with pride and affection.
He says later on :
This hopeful student of a republican institution, my Lord
Salisbury, has said in a recent speech :
The Americans, as you know, have a senate. I wish we could institute
it in this country. Marvellous in efficiency and strength.
Mr, Carnegie quotes, with evident pride, the opinion
which that eminent statesman, Lord Salisbury, enter-
tains of the American Senate as an institution which
has been in operation for the last 100 years in that
country, and the working of which he has had ample
opportunity to very closely observe. But while it
may be said that a writer like Carnegie is bound to
speak well of the institutions of the country which
has enabled him to acquire a stupendous fortune and
become a millionaire, and that w r e ought not to take
the opinions of a man like that when he speaks in
admiration of this institution without a very con-
siderable amount of deduction, it is fortunate for the
discussion on the present occasion that there is no
need for us to confine our attention to the observa-
tions which have been made by writers of the class
of Mr. Carnegie. I dare say hon. gentlemen have
nearly all of them very carefully read the admirable
work of Mr. Bryce. Now, Mr. Bryce cannot be said
to be a w'riter like Carnegie, who is filled with en-
thusiastic admiration of American institutions as such,
but a calm, judicious, and dispassionate writer, who
will speak of any institution, particularly an American
institution, exactly as he finds it; and in dealing with
this question of the senate, Mr. Bryce makes the
following remarks :
The respective characters of the two bodies are wholly
unlike those of the so-called upper and lower chambers of
Europe. In Europe there is always a difference of political
complexion, generally resting on a difference in personal com-
position. There the upper chamber represents the aristocracy
of the country, or the men of wealth, or the high officials, or
the influence of the Crown and Court; while the lower
chamber represents the multitude. Between the senate and
the House there is no difference. Both equally represent
the people, the whole people, and nothing but the people.
The individual members come from the same classes of the
community ; and though there are more rich men (in pro-
portion to numbers) in the senate than in the House, the
influence of capital is not markedly greater, Both have been
formed by the same social influences, and the social pretensions
of a senator expire with his term of office. Both are possessed
by the same ideas, governed by the same sentiments, equally
conscious of their dependence on public opinion. The one has
never been, like the English House of Commons, a popular
pet ; the other never, like the English House of Lords, a
popular bugbear.
What is perhaps stranger, the two branches of Congress
have not exhibited that contrast of feeling and policy which
might be expected from the different methods by which they
are chosen. In the House the large states are predominant,
nine out of thirty-eight (less than one fourth) return an absolute
majority of 325 representatives. In the senate these same
nine states have only eighteen members out of seventy-six,
less than a fourth of the whole. In other words, these nine
states are more than sixteen times as powerful in the House
as they are in the senate. But, as the House has never been
the organ of the large states, nor prone to act in their interest,


so neither has the senate been the stronghold of the small
states, for American politics have never turned upon an
antagonism between these two sets of commonwealths.
Questions relating to states' rights, and the greater or less
extension of the powers of the national government, have
played a leading part in the history of the union. But
although small states might be supposed to be specially zealous
for states' rights, the tendency to uphold them has been no
stronger in the senate than in the House.
Collisions between the two houses are frequent. Each is
jealous and combative. Each is prone to alter the bills that
come from the other ; and the senate in particular knocks
about remorselessly those favourite children of the house, the
appropriation bills. The fact that one house has passed a bill
goes but a little way in inducing the other to pass it; the
senate would reject twenty House bills as readily as one.
Deadlocks, however, disagreements over serious issues which
stop the machinery of administration, are not common. They
rarely cause excitement or alarm outside Washington, because
the country, remembering previous instances, feels sure they
will be adjusted, and knows that either house would yield
were it unmistakably condemned by public opinion. The
executive government goes on undisturbed, and the worst that
can happen is the loss of a bill which may be passed four
months later. Even as between the two bodies there is 110
great bitterness in these conflicts, because the causes of quarrel
do not lie deep. Sometimes it is self-esteem that is involved,
the sensitive self-esteem of an assembly. Sometimes one or
other house is playing for a party advantage. That intensity
which, in the similar contests in Europe, arises from class
feeling is absent, because there is no class distinction between
the two American chambers. Thus the country seems to be
watching a fencing match rather than a combat d outrance.
I dwell upon this substantial identity of character in the
senate and the House, because it explains the fact, surprising
to a European, that two perfectly co-ordinate authorities,
neither of which has any more right than its rival to claim to
speak for the whole nation, manage to get along together.
Their quarrels are professional and personal rather than
conflicts of adverse principles. The two bodies are not hostile
elements in the nation, striving for supremacy, but servants
of the same master, whose word of rebuke will quiet them.
I think that these extracts will go far to show that
the fears which may be entertained by some hon.
gentlemen as to this experiment, as it is called, of
giving co-ordinate powers to the second chamber are
not well founded. I am well aware that my hon.
friend, Mr. Deakin, has rested some of his objections
to the form of senate which I advocate, and which
other members advocate, on the ground that it is
impossible for us, with our ideas of constitutional
government, and wfith the ideas which many members
have of a government responsible to the chamber of
representatives, to graft on a system of that kind the
system which we propose to construct as the result
of the labours of this Convention. I know that that
objection was prominent in the hon. gentleman's
mind, and it is only just to him to say that there is
a good deal in the contention which he has set up,
that it is difficult to graft the American system,
which lias an executive not at all responsible
to the legislature, upon a system which is to com-
bine a senate with co-ordinate powers with a
system of responsibility to a house of represen-
tatives. But we have not all the wisdom of the
ages concentrated in ourselves ; and I have not the
slightest doubt that in the course of time such develop-
ments will take place as will render it possible to
have a form of government which will be consistent,
to a certain extent, w r ith our ideas of responsible
government, and at the same time with the existence
of a second chamber, possessing powers to which
none of the second chambers of these colonies are in
the least degree entitled. But, sir, I would like hon.
gentlemen to bear in mind that I am very far from
advocating for the federal parliament—which I hope
will grow out of the labours of this Convention—a
second chamber which shall be elected, as the mem-
bers of the second chamber in the United States are
elected, by the combined vote of the upper chamber
and the lower chamber of the states legislatures.
That might be a very good method, but with some of
the Constitutions of these colonies as they are at
present, it might not perhaps be all that could be
desired. Many of the second chambers in the
colonies being nominated chambers, and not elected,
and in the case of those that are elected not being
electedby the suffrages of the people generally,it might
very fairly be said that the members of the senate,
though elected by the legislatures of the colonies as
they exist at the present time, would not be truly
representative of the people, and that therefore there
is some reason why we should not proceed to con-
struct the senate after the model of the American
Senate, possessing co-ordinate powers with the lower
house, or the house of representatives. But lam
not at all wedded to that principle, and I should be
very sorry iudeed to advocate from my place in this
Convention a system by which the second chamber
shall be founded exclusively upon the methods which
are suggested by those who contend that the mem-
bers of that second chamber shall be elected by the
legislatures of the several colonies as they exist at
present. Ido contend, however, that a great mis-
take will be made if we proceed to the creation of a
senate, or second chamber, in the federal constitution,
which shall be deprived of those powers which we
enjoy, or a great proportion of the powers that are
now enjoyed by the senate of the United States.
We know, sir, that if the ideas which you have
embodied in your resolutions are carried out, this
will be the result: that in the ease of financial pro-
posals being sent up from the lower chamber to the
second chamber, the senate will have no alternative
but to accept the proposals in gloho , or to entirely
reject them. But our experience of the working
of that system in these colonies is not particu-
larly reassuring. We know that the effect of a
second chamber rejecting the financial proposals of
the lower chamber in their entirety, is to inflame
the public resentment against the upper chamber,
as it is called. There might be very many things in
the financial proposals which emanated from the
government and were carried through the lower
chamber, of which the members of the upper chamber
cordially approved ; but if it were incumbent upon
them to reject a measure because there was much in
it of which they disapproved, although it contained
a great deal that they did approve of, the result
would be to cause a very great amount of public
excitement, and to cause many persons in the com-
munity to raise their voices against the existence of
a second chamber at all. I think we should guard
against that, and if the senate or second chamber in
the federal constitution were based upon the suffrages
of the people, although in a different way, yet as truly
based upon the suffrages of the people as the house of
representatives, then I cannot see on what ground it
can be contended that the senate should be deprived
of co-ordinate powers with the lower assembly. I
think that in a matter of this kind we should proceed
as far as possible by familiar analogy, and, though
perhaps the suggestion of the analogy may, in the
minds of some lion, members, be thought entirely
inappropriate to an assemblage of this kind—though
the suggestion or the expression of the analogy may
in some quarters create a smile—yet it appears to me
that in order to have a perfect system of federal
government, we ought, as far as possible, to preserve
an analogy to that form of government which prevails
in a model family. Now, in the case of a model
family we know that the husband represents the
entire household.
An Hojf. Member: In providing for the expenditure!
An Hon. Member : There is no federation there !
Mr. RUTLEDGE : The husband is supposed, in
the natural order of things, to be the representative
of the entire household ; but, though he is a repre-
sentative of the entire household, we know that the
wife also plays a very important part in the govern-
ment of that household. The wife comes very near
to all those smaller constituent elements of the family
circle, which may, perhaps, by analogy be likened to
the great family of states which will exist in connec-
tion with this great federal Constitution.


Colonel Smith : She is the home ruler!
Mr. RUTLEDGE : It is the wife that knows all
about the particular interests which affect all the
members of the family group: they come to her with
their particular ideas, and they look to her for the
expression of their ideas and for the enforcement of
their particular claims.
Mr. Muneo : Not for finding the income !
Mr. RUTLEDGE; With regard to that inter-
jection, I say that he is a wise man who, being the
head of a household, puts all his financial projects
into the crucible of the sagacious mind of his wife,
far more enlightened, far more discriminating than
his own.
Colonel Smith : With the power of veto ?
Mr. RUTLEDGE: I say yes, with the power of
veto. In this community many a man owes a great
deal to the advice of his wife, and the veto which she
has put upon his proposals. We know that those
strong-headed men who think that all wisdom is em-
bodied in themselves, who do not take their wives
into their confidence, who do not consult their
wives as to some particular speculation on which
they desire to embark, are the men "who very fre-
quently come to grief. But the men who do take
their wives into their confidence in this way, and
who do permit them to have a considerable voice in
the management of family affairs, even to putting a
veto upon their own impulsive tendencies in regard to
financial proposals, are the men who go on very safe
lines. No analogy is perfect ; every analogy will
break down w hen you come to some particular modes
of applying it; but I do regard a great family of
states, governed by a house of representatives and a
senate, as bearing a very considerable analogy to the
constitution of a family; and I say the same rule
which prevails in the one ought to prevail in the
other.
Sir Thomas Mcllaa t eaith : The wife initiates most
of the money bills there!
Mr. RUTLEDGE: The wives do initiate a great
many of the money bills, and I appeal to the experi-
ence of a great many hon. gentlemen to know whether
they have not been saved very frequently from finan-
cial mistakes by consulting their wives in regard to im-
portant steps which they proposed to take in the very
serious affairs of life. This question of a second cham-
ber has been referred to by a literary gentleman w ho is
well known, perhaps, to many members of this Con-
vention, and he has spoken of it in conversation with
me as being what may be called the expression of the
second thought of the people. It is a very good
thing, I think, to give the people an opportunity of
having a second thought on some proposal upon
which they have set their minds. The hon. member,
Captain Russell, has referred in the course of his
excellent speech to the cyclonic gusts of popular
passion which sometimes pass over a community, and
that is the same idea which was present to the mind
of Alexander Hamilton when he wrote some of those
admirable papers for “The Federalist.” Why, sir,
there have been times in the history of the commu-
liity when the people have been seized with a sudden
impulse in a particular direction, involving great
issues of public policy, and involving considerable
public expenditure ; but if they had had an opportu-
nity of reconsidering their first decision how fre-
quently would they have, if not entirely reversed, at
all events to a considerable extent modified that
decision. And I take it, sir, that in the existence of
a senate composed of men who are, equally with the
house of representatives, representing the people of
the whole of the states, you have the embodiment of
the second thought of the people, and in the case
of the members of the senate, if you give them the
power to discriminate betw r een the various financial
proposals of the government sent up from the loAver
chamber, you give that chamber the means of putting
a check upon the impulsive proclivities of the repre-
sentatives of the people as such, and of suggesting to
the people themselves a more excellent Avay of doing
that in which all alike are interested, and accom-
plishing the objects which all alike have in view. I
cannot disguise from myself this fact: that in creating
a second chamber which has only limited authority
and limited jurisdiction, even in the matter of financial
proposals, you are laying the foundation for discord
and for disagreement. We knoxv very well that the
animal which is chained up is always most disposed
to show his teeth. The animal upon whom you place
a great restriction, and forbid to him an amount of
freedom wdnch another may have, is always the one
that displays a quarrelsome tendency. So I contend
that the very fact of endeavouring to put a limit
upon the powers of the second chamber is to engender
in the minds of that second chamber a quarrelsome
disposition which would not exist if it felt that it
had equally free and unfettered authority with the
members of the representative chamber. I do not
propose to say many more words in advocacy of the
view which I take with regard to this, which seems
to me to be the crucial question which w r e have here
to decide. I believe all the members of the Conven-
tion have come here with a sincere desire to solve
the problem Avhich is placed before us. I believe
every member has come here with a disposition to
learn something, if possible, from every other member,
and I am quite sure that no one has come here with
preconceived ideas of so consolidated a character as
cannot be contracted, or expanded, or modified in any
way whatever. As w r as well pointed out by the hon.
member, Sir George Grey, we are to bear in mind
that Ave are not here creating a Federal Constitution
Avhich is to serve the purposes of the present genera-
tion merely, but a Federal Constitution which shall
last for all time ; and in endeavouring to erect such
a political structure as that, Ave ought to take care to
make its provisions so elastic as to be capable of
expanding to the necessities of all future occasions,
and not to place rigid restrictions around that Consti-
tution, the result of which will be that in the course
of the agitations which must arise in future years
there will be such contentions and such dissensions
as will ensure the demolition of the edifice which it
is now our care to rear. We are here, sir, for the
purpose of building up, and I hope that Ave shall
bear that fact in mind in all that Ave do. I should
also like hon. gentlemen to endeavour to bear in
mind that the feeling A\Tiich predominates in the
minds of the people of the states is one of great
timidity. The people of the states, whom Ave are
here to represent, feel that they are venturing upon,
to a certain extent, an unkuoAvn sea as far as their
experience is concerned, and w r e ought to proceed in
such a Avay as to reassure them at every step we go
that in what we are doing, xvhile we are taking care
of the interests of the federal Constitution, we are
preserving, in all their integrity, as far as it is pos-
sible with the existence of a federal Constitution, all
those rights and privileges to the enjoyment of which
they have been so long accustomed. Passing on to
the question of a federal judiciary, I think I need
say no more than this, that while it is a matter for
congratulation that you have seen your w ay to make
a proposition for
a judiciary consisting of a federal supreme court, which
shall constitute a high court of appeal for Australia,
under the direct authority of the Sovereign, whose
decisions as such shall be final—•
we ought to make provision—and I have no doubt
we shall do so in Committee —as has been done
under the United States Constitution, that this high
court shall be possessed, not only of the functions of
an appellate court, but of original jurisdiction in
those subjects AA T hich this Convention may see fit to
prescribe. Before I take my seat, let me say with
what great pleasure I find myself in the presence of
representatives of all of the colonies of Australia for


Ibe purpose of discussing tlie great question before
us. I have been delighted with the cordial good
feeling that has been exhibited by the delegates to
this Convention towards each other, both privately
and sitting officially in this Convention. I have been
delighted with the high tone and character of the
speeches that have been addressed to us, and I feel
that I should be dishonouring the members of this
Convention in my thoughts if I were for a single
moment to doubt that the result of their united
labours here will be the laying broad, and deep, and
strong the foundations of a political edifice that shall
be ample and adequate for the shelter and protection
of the millions who are yet to inhabit the continent
of Australia, and that shall, in the course of a few
years, I trust at the furthest, rear its noble propor-
tions in all their symmetry and all their strength to
the admiring gaze of the people of the whole civilised
world.
Mr. KINGSTON: I confess that in rising to
address this assembly I am embarrassed by an appre-
ciation of the responsibilities which must attach to
every member taking part in its deliberations. I had
thought of reserving such observations as occurred to
me until we were met in Committee for the purpose
of discussing the details of the Constitution it is our
duty to frame; but I have come to the conclusion
that it is desirable that at the earliest stage each
member of the Convention should state for the con-
sideration of his fellow-delegates his views on such
matters of general importance as have been already
touched upon, or as are involved in the resolutions
which you, sir, have submitted. Following the
example which has been set by preceding speakers,
I may say that I offer such suggestions as I shall
proceed to make in all humility, endeavouring to
emphasise the position which has been so well put by
yourself and by the hon. delegate who immediately
followed you, that our observations at this stage of
the proceedings should partake rather of the charac-
ter of suggestions for the meeting of difficulties than
of the sketching of any definite plan for the forma-
tion of a federal Constitution, seeing that such plans
can result only from the exchange of views among
the delegates when we shall have debated the subject
much more fully than at present. Coming to the
resolutions, I may express my hearty concurrence
with the first of them, affirming that the poAvers and
privileges and territorial rights of the several existing
colonies should remain intact. lam very glad indeed
that an expression of opinion to this effect should
have been embodied in our resolutions at so early a
stage of these proceedings, because I think Ave shall
do well to emphasise the fact that we are dealing
Avith autonomous states, Avho have long enjoyed the
blessing of self-government, and Avho should not be
asked —and aaFo, if asked, vvould not be likely to
accede to the request —to sacrifice any of their
existing poAvers other than those Avhich it is absolutely
necessary should be surrendered in the national
interest. I hope we shall set clearly before us the
fact that a national government should be strictly
limited to dealing with subjects in which the interests
of the community as a nation are involved. I hope
that in our proceedings we shall feel that it is our
duty, in approaching the several colonies, as Ave shall
require to approach them at the conclusion of the
deliberations of this Convention, to state in precise
language that which Ave desire they should surrender
for the benefit of the nation. I hope, also, that we
shall make no request for a surrender which cannot
be justified on the score of the requirements of the
national interest. I think that such a course as is
recognised in the resolution to which I now refer w ill
commend itself to all, and that any departure from
the principle Avhich is involved might be fraught Avith
the most disastrous results. I am glad to observe
that there appears to be practically a consensus of
opinion among the delegates that the American
system of preserving for the benefit of the states the
poAvers which are not expressly conferred upon the
federal government should be folloAved, rather than
the system AA r hich obtains in Canada; and I feel that
not only will this course, in the natural order of
things, commend itself to the various colonies Avhen
Ave require to approach them, but that it will com-
mend itself to every delegate present, and to every
one who appreciates, as we must all appreciate, the
benefits of the system of local self-government which
these colonies have for so long enjoyed. I am glad
also to notice that we make express provision for the
recognition of the territorial rights of the provinces.
It does appear to me, however, that it will be
necessary, in the federal Constitution, to make pro-
vision in some form or other for the possible alteration
of the boundaries of the various states, which will
be occasioned, doubtless, in some instances, by the
creation of fresh states. In this connection it is
impossible to overlook the fact, Avhich, I think, has
been already referred to by one of the delegates—
and which AA r e all keenly appreciate at the present
moment —that the important colony of Queensland is
just lIOAV contemplating an early division of her great
territory into tAvo or more separate colonies. I think
that under these circumstances Ave should be framing
a Constitution which overlooked immediate require-
ments if Ave did not make provision for the
admission into the federal union of these colonies,
which I understand are shortly to be called into
existence. I trust, therefore, that Ave shall find in
the federal Constitution some provision for meeting
a case of that sort, and it seems to me that if it
took the shape of a section enabling provinces, Avith
the consent of the existing local legislatures, and by
agreement with the federal parliament, to be carved
out of existing colonies, and to be admitted into the
union upon such terms as may be agreed upon, Ave
should be making a provision on the subject which
will shortly be of practical utility. I cannot help
thinking, in connection Avith the possibility of the
changes to which I refer, that a provision of that sort,
not laying down any hard and fast lines as to the
terms on Avhich the neAV provinces should be admitted
into the union, AAould be preferable to one which did
not permit of the federal gox r ernment and the local
legislatures arranging the matter as they thought
best. It does appear to me, in connection with the
change to AA r hich 1 refer, that there may attach a con-
siderable amount of importance to the result as
affecting the representation of the colony which is like-
ly to be the most concerned —or of any other colony
Avhich may be the subject of a change—in the senate,
in Avhich I understand the generally accepted wish to
be that all the colonies should be equally represen-
ted. I should like to say, sir, that although I confine
my remarks to the question of the carving of future
colonies out of existing provinces, and to the question
of their admission to the union, I do trust that our
Constitution may be of such a character that while,
in the terms of the resolution Avhich Avas carried at
the Melbourne conference only last year, Ave make
provision for the admission of what were then de-
scribed as the remoter colonies of Australasia—
words which I believe w T ere intended to refer particu-
larly to NeAV Zealand —Ave shall not lose sight of the
possibility that at some time or other, perhaps shortly
it may be considered desirable to extend the juris-
diction of a united Australia to all British colonies
in the Pacific. I feel more particularly impelled to
refer to this matter on account of the course Avhich
was suggested by Lord Derby in connection, with the
attempted annexation of NeAV Guinea. It does seem
to me that if Ave had had in existence at that time, as
was pointed out by Lord Derby, a government repre-
sentative of the whole of Australasia which could
have spoken with a united voice on the subject of
the imperial attitude towards the island in question,
we should not at the present moment have occasion


to deplore the appropriation of a portion of that
great territory by a foreign country. Under these cir-
cumstances, I think we should do well to make pro-
vision for the admission into the union which we are
proposing to create, not only of what may be generally
termed the remoter colonies of Australasia, but of all
British colonies which may now exist, or which may
hereafter be founded in the Pacific, and which it may
appear to a federal government should be subjected
to Australian control. With reference to the 2nd
resolution —that trade and intercourse between the
federated colonies, whether by means of land carriage
or coastal navigation, shall bo absolutely free —I
consider it, following the course adopted by preceding
speakers, in connection with the 3rd resolution, giving
to the federal government power to impose customs
duties ; and presuming that the intention is that in-
tercolonial free-trade should be established at the
time of, but not before, the adoption of - a federal
tariff, I am prepared to give the proposition my
heartiest support.
Colonel Smith : Hear, hear !
Mr. KINGSTON: I desire to emphasise a point
which, I regret, is not made so clear in the resolution
to which I refer as are some other matters, and it is
this: In my humble opinion it would be a great mis-
take—and I can hardly believe that it is seriously
contemplated—to enact intercolonial free-trade be-
fore the adoption of a federal tariff. I have my own
opinion as to the lines upon which a federal tariff
will be framed. I cannot help thinking
looking at the course of legislation which has
obtained in most of the Australian colonies, and
at the different fiscal systems they at present
enjoy—that is highly probable that the result of the
deliberations of the federal parliament will be the
adoption of a protective tariff against the outside
world. But what I venture to point out is this, that
the resolutions, as they stand, make no reference to
the necessary provision that intercolonial free-trade
is not to come into force until a federal tariff is
adopted. Nor do they say anything whatever about
the nature of the federal tariff. As regards its
nature, it would probably be useless to define it here ;
but I do think we ought to lay it down in the clearest
possible language that there is no intention on the
part of this Convention to do anything to bring about
intercolonial free-trade before the federal parliament
has disposed of the question of what the nature of
the federal tariff shall be.
Colonel Smith : Hear, hear !
Mr. KINGSTON: What would be the result of
intercolonial free-trade before the adoption of a
federal tariff p I imagine that it is not intended to
limit intercolonial free-trade to the products and
manufactures of the different colonies, and so if free-
trade between the colonies were established, what
would be the position, I ask, of a Sydney importer,
importing under a system of free-trade and competing
in the markets of the various colonies with his im-
ported goods, which, by force of the provisions of the
proposed constitution to which I have ventured to
call attention, must be similarly admitted into the
neighbouring states ? lam ready to believe that no
doubt the intention is to act in the way I indicate ;
but there are no matters which are likely to be more
closely scrutinised than the proposals of this Conven-
tion with reference to commercial relationships. It
has been suggested that in Committee these two
resolutions should be transposed, and I think that
that is a suggestion well worthy of adoption. I think
it is also desirable to amend them so as to make.the
position perfectly clear in the direction which I have
indicated, that is, that intercolonial free-trade is only
to be brought about at the time of the adoption of a
federal tariff. Something has been said with refer-
ence to the attitude of the colony of Victoria in this
matter. I confess that I was a little surprised to
hear the utterances of one hon. member from that
colony, who expressed himself with some hesitation
as to the propriety of calling a system of intercolonial
free-trade into existence immediately on the establish-
ment of a federal constitution, or even immediately
on the adoption of a federal tariff. I had shared the
somewhat common idea that Victoria, by force of the
protective system which she has so long enjoyed, had
built up her manufactures to such a state of perfect
tiou that they could defy competition, and that if the
barriers which prevent free commercial relationships
between the colonies were done away with it would
enable her to compete in the markets of all the other
colonies with regard to local manufactures. However,
I freely admit that we owe a duty to our manufactu-
rers, to those whom, by the adoption of a certain
fiscal system, we have encourage'd to invest their
capital in the establishment of manufactories which
are only now, or lately, commencing to return them
any profitable results. 1 can assure the hon. member
that the arguments which have evidently operated on
his mind apply with tenfold force to our colony of
South Australia, for there we have only had the
benefit of a protective system during the last few
years. It was originally adopted in a modified form
in 1885; and afterwards in 1887, we practically copied
the system which had been adopted with so much suc-
cess in Victoria. I am happy to say, however, that
although the minds of our manufacturers and colo-
nists generally have been profoundly agitated by this
question, on its most careful investigation they have
come to the conclusion that the question of inter-
colonial free-trade ought not to impede the course of
federation. Every step was taken to ventilate the
subject. A committee of both houses was charged
with the duty of inquiring into, and reporting upon,
the probable result of intercolonial free-trade in
Mouth Australia, and their report, though of course
it is only something in the shape of a guide as
regards the locality to which it refers, is as follows :
We recommend the adoption of intercolonial free-trade on
the basis of a uniform tariff, and regard it as a corollary of
the federation of the Australian colonies. We recognise
the many difficulties which have to be overcome before
federation can be accomplished, and are of opinion, in the
meantime, that practically the whole of the existing reasons
for postponement will then have passed away. The
benefits arising from intercolonial free-trade will far out-
weigh any disadvantages which may result.
If that is the case, as I believe it is the case in South
Australia, where we have only had for a short period
the benefit of the protective system, how much more
is it’ likely to be the case in Victoria where the cir-
cumstances are so different. At the same time I am
inclined to think that it would be a good thing if our
manufacturers could know with some degree of
certainty when the encouragement, support, and
safeguard which they are deriving from intercolonial
tariffs is likely to be withdrawn from them. I think
it is a pity that that time should be allowed to be
clouded by any degree of uncertainty, and I should
be happy, indeed, to support any resolution for the
purpose of naming a fixed and definite time when
intercolonial duties will be abolished, so that our
manufacturers may know the circumstances with
which they may have to deal, and may make their
arrangements accordingly. I do not think it ought
to be allowed to remain in such an uncertain state as
the date of the accomplishment of our wishes with
regard to the establishment of Australasian federa-
tion. I am anxious and sanguine that that date shall
be an early date ; but, at the same time, for the
reasons to which I have already referred, it should be
put within the four corners of a law, so that there
may be no doubt or uncertainty on the subject, which
is always prejudicial in commercial matters. As I
have quoted the report of our commission for the
purpose of supplying information to hon. members
as to the precise state of affairs in South Australia
as far as we have been able to gather them, I should


like to say that there is, on the general question of
intercolonial free-trade, a paragraph in that report
which appears to me to so fairly set out the advantages
which we may expect to derive from the adoption of
a system of that character, that I may be permitted
to quote it, adopting it as my own:
Your commissioners are firmly convinced that the welfare
of Australia will be promoted by the abandonment of all
restrictions upon intercolonial trade by adopting such a
policy, the one object of which will be throughout Australia
to render industry productive by leaving it to follow natural
channels of employment, and by affording every possible
facility to commerce to freely realise rapid progress, wealth,
and prosperity, by developing in each colony the industry
for which nature has best fitted it, without wasteful
rivalry.
These arguments appear to me to he well founded,
and I shall therefore, subject to the qualifications
which I have already indicated, be found supporting
the resolutions touching upon that subject. The
4th resolution raises the question of defence, and I
am disposed to think that a more prominent position
might well have been given to this question than it
occupies. lam not going to discuss the details of
possible provisions on the subject which may be con-
sidered necessary to be embodied in the constitution.
An hon. member has already addressed himself to
that question ; but it seems to me that every
citizen, or every person worthy of the name of
citizen, recognises it as his duty in time of
war to take up arms in defence of his country. It
is almost a corollary of that proposition, that it is the
duty of every true citizen in time of peace to qualify
himself to render efficient service in time of need
without unnecessary expense to the community of
which he is a member. £ trust that our federal legis-
lation will recognise the soundness of the principles
which I venture to lay down, and that effect will be
given to them at the earliest possible moment. lam
hopeful, indeed, that when we have legislation of that
character its results will be apparent in the manhood
of united Australia, and that it will add alike to the
dignity and safety of the nation and be productive of
the happiest results. The preliminary resolutions, 1,
2, 3, and 4, seem to me to deal with the chief objects
of federation: defence and intercolonial free-trade,
accompanied by a federal tariff. I think that, al-
though it might possibly raise subjects which it is
unnecessary to discuss at the present time, we might
have added to these a resolution which would recog-
nise that in the natural order of things the federal
parliament would be properly charged with the duty
of establishing uniform laws on matters of common
interest. We all know the difficulties which at pre-
sent surround the adoption of legislation to give
effect to provisions which are desired equally by the
people of the different colonies, and in which they
have practically a common interest. There are one
or two questions which might almost be associated
with the question of defence. I regard as second
only to the necessity of protecting our shores against
actual invasion, the necessity of protecting Australia
against the influx of aliens, Asiatics, criminals,
paupers, and other undesirable classes. In the legis-
lation which we have been already compelled to adopt
on these subjects, we know that there has been a
striving after uniformity ; but that uniformity has
seldom been obtained. It is idle for one state, unless
it erects a hostile barrier on its intercolonial bound-
aries, to attempt to pass useful legislation prohibiting
or restricting an influx of that character, if there is
no community of action on the part of the rest of
the colonies ; and when the doors of Australia are
thrown open by the omission of one state to do
its duty, the undesirable class which any colony
wishes to guard against may come in, not at the front
door, but at the back —not at her own seaports, but
through the territory of her neighbours. It would
be well, for this reason, to specify as one of the chief
objects of the adoption of a federal constitution the
uniformity of legislation in the direction to which I
have referred. No doubt w r e shall have an oppor-
tunity in Committee to amend the resolutions in this
direction, and if that is not thought desirable we may
make the required provision in the bill. Having thus
stated the general object of the federation, we find
in the three succeeding paragraphs the means by
which they are proposed to be accomplished. I would
say here, that although I believe a contrary opinion
is entertained by some, it appears to me we are
adopting a proper course when first we fix the objects
which we desire to accomplish, and then subsequently
proceed to lay down and define the means by which
we hope to effect them. No exception can be taken
to the proposition that the parliament should consist
of two houses. An attempt has been made to deal
with some matters of federal interest by means of a
single chamber ; but we know that the result has not
been encouraging. A parliament consisting of two
houses may be considered an essential of a federal
constitution. Although an hon. member has ques-
tioned whether there isanythingverymuchinthe name
which we attach to either house, I think that a very wise
suggestion was made that the second chamber should be
dignified by the name of the Council of the states,
which at once gives an idea, to all who may be
interested in considering its constitution, of the
nature of the functions which it has to perform, and
enables us at the earliest moment to dissociate it from
the ideas which we ordinarily entertain with reference
to second chambers, and which it appears to me, for
reasons which have been already dwelt upon, cannot
properly apply to the proposed council of the states.
This proposed term, I believe, is borrowed from the
Swiss Constitution, and I think we might go further,
and take advantage of the suggestion which we find
in that constitution, as regards the name which should
be attached to the more popular branch of the legis-
lature. It is proposed here to call it the Tiouse of
representatives. I do not think we have in Australia —
though, no doubt, we have in Australasia —a body
which is dignified by a term of the description used.
I think it is the invariable practice in Australia to
refer to our popular chambers as assemblies, and it
seems to me that if we were to keep to this custom,
and apply the term " national" to the popular
chamber, and call it the " national assembly," we would
be adopting a course which has a good deal to
recommend it, and would facilitate the appreciation
of the functions which it is intended to repose in that
branch of the parliament. I do not know whether it
is intended in the federal constitution to provide for
a uniform system as regards the election of the senate.
For my own part, I venture to consider that any such
attempt would be a mistake, and that we shall be
doing best if we allow the people of the various
states to provide such means as are acceptable to
them; and it appears to me also that it would be
absolutely impossible, if we attempt to lay down a
uniform system, to deprive the people of the states of
the right of appointment by their direct vote. I
think it would be a very great invasion of the popular
rights possessed by the inhabitants of any particular
colony if the federal constitution were to provide that
they should not exercise their right of election in such
a way as would make the persons elected their direct
nominees by the popular vote. And I would like to
say in this connection that we have had some experience
of the difficulties attendant on any attempt to secure
uniformity in the appointment of federal senators.
No doubt if uniformity were attempted, and it were
not generally provided in the federal constitution
that senators should be elected directly by the people,
some such course would be considered desirable as
obtains in other countries where they are elected by
members of both branches of the legislature. But as
has been pointed out by the hon. member, Mr.
Rutledge, varying circumstances affect the constitu-
tion of the second chamber in different colonies, and


whilst in some colonies it might he considered a
desirable thing to confide to the two houses the
power in question, particularly where the second
house is elective, a similar remark might not apply to
other provinces, where the second chamber, as has
been mentioned, is differently constituted. This
question was discussed not so very long ago, in 1889,
in the Federal Council, where there were present
representatives of all the colonies of Australia except
this great colony, and the result then unanimously
arrived at after most careful consideration was as
follows;
The committee carefully deliberated on the question of a
uniform system for the selection of representatives from
the different colonies, but are unable to recommend any
system. Considerable advantage would probably result
from uniformity ; but the differences in the constitution
of the parliaments of the various colonies render
objectionable the uniform system of election by
members of Parliament ; and in the opinion of the
committee it is not yet practicable to require the
election of representatives by constituencies of the
people. Moreover, as the chief object of any system
must be to secure the representation in the council of
each colony in the manner most satisfactory to the
people, it appears to the committee that that object
will be attained by continuing the present unrestrained
right of the people in each colony to decide the matter
for themselves through the local legislatures.
I trust, therefore, that there will be no attempt to
interfere with the independence of the people of the
various communities in settling this matter as
they think best. So long as they are satisfied,
so long as they are free to adopt whatever mode
they please to secure their effectual representa-
tion, it appears to me that it is a matter for
themselves, with which the other colonies have no
right to interfere, and with which interference would
only be a source of difficulty and trouble with no
corresponding beneficial results. The question of the
constitution of the senate brings me face to face with
one of the most important questions which have been
raised during the course of the debate —the question
of the powers which the senate ought to enjoy ; and
I feel—l imagine, in common with other delegates —
very much indebted to the hon. member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, for the mode in which he called attention to
the matter, and emphasised the great distinction
which exists between the senate and the upper
chambers with w'hich we are accustomed to deal,
though Sir Samuel Griffith did not, possibly, commit
himself to any very distinct proposition as to the
exact course that should be pursued.
Colonel Smith : He gave us several indications —
feelers !
Mr. KINGSTON: It appears to me that we will
do well to copy the example which the hon. member
has set, and it will be a pity, indeed, if at this early
stage of our deliberations we commit ourselves to
any definite course for meeting the difficulties which
he’has pointed out in such a way that it might make
it difficult for us to subsequently withdraw and
revise our opinions. Therefore, sir, I propose to
discuss the question in a similar strain, hardly con-
templating the possibility of my being so fortunate
as to hit upon the solution; but rather venturing the
expression of my ideas in order that they may be
criticised and their worth ascertained. Following up
the arguments advanced by the preceding speakers, 1
think there is no great reason for anticipating a
collision of any serious nature between the two
houses, because they are responsible to the same
people. The sole distinction is that while the elec-
tors are the same, the electorates are different. We
have had, I might almost say, a miserable experience
of conflict between different branches of colonial
legislatures. But from what cause did that proceed ?
It arose from the fact that the electors w T ere not the
same, nor were the interests the same. Here the
electors are the same, and I venture to think also
that here the interests are the same.
An Hon. Member : Not necessarily !
Mr. KINGSTON : I am inclined to think that, in
matters of national importance —and national ques-
tions are the only ones with wffiich the federal par-
liament w ill have power to deal —it will seldom occur
that there will be such a clashing between state
interests and national interests that a collision will be
likely to be involved between the representatives of
the state in the senate and the representatives of the
people in the national assembly. The hon. member,
Mr. Deakin, challenged the Convention to define
w hat are state rights in national questions,
Mr. Deakin : And I have not yet been answmred!
Mr. KINGSTON: I think the hon. gentleman has
been fairly enough answered by one or two delegates
who have spoken, and who have- quoted instances.
There may be occasions when the two things will be
opposed, the one to the other. I do not think that
such occasions w T ill be frequent, and I look forward
to the time when it may be found advisable to alter
the constitution of the federation in such awayas to
obviate the necessity of special provision for the
protection of state rights. But, at present, that
time has not come. State rights must be protected,
and I look upon it as an absolute essential for the
approval of such a constitution as we may see fit to
adopt here, by the parliaments and peoples of the
different colonies, that we may be able to point to
full and effectual provisions and safeguards in the
shape of protection for those rights and interests
which are generally classed and included under the
definition of state rights. No doubt there is a great
deal of federal sentiment in the air, and w r e are
attempting to give it some practical effect; but, at
the same time, we must recognise this fact, that
there is a feeling, and a natural feeling, though
perhaps, it may not be capable of the most logical
justification, on the part of the parliaments and
peoples of the different states, that they will require
safeguards to be provided for the preservation of
state interests before they will have anything to do
with the adoption of a Constitution providing for a
federal government. I know, sir, what the difficulty
was only a short time since in connection with our
own colony when it was sought to alter the repre-
sentation enjoyed by the various colonies in the
Federal Council. The alteration proposed to recognise
only in the most infinitesimal degree the claims of
extra population to extra representation. But wdiat
was the result ? Why, it was affirmed in our Parlia-
ment, though by only one branch —and I think a
sentiment exists in South Australia to a very con-
siderable extent at the present time, which approves
of the resolution then arrived at —that if extra
representation was to be conceded to any colony in
one chamber on account of extra population it was
an essential to the approval of the Constitution that
there should be a second chamber, in which all the
states would be equally represented. I think the
sentiment to wdiich I have referred exists throughout
the majority of the states, and it is a natural one,
and one which must be dealt with and met by con-
cessions on the part of the larger states.
Mr. Muneo : And no concessions on the part of
the smaller states ?
Mr. KINGSTON: Fair concessions should be
made on both sides. It is only a question for us to
ascertain wdiat is fair under the circumstances. But
the position we find is: the smaller states enjoying
all the benefits of local independence; other states,
larger, enjoying similar privileges. We are of one
mind that an effort should be made to induce all to
enter a federation; and I appreciate the position
which is emphasised by the interjection of the hon.
member, Mr. Munro, that just as you make conces-
sions which are pleasing to the people of the smaller
states, and may meet their particular views, so you
afford grounds for disapproval by the representatives
and people of the larger colonies. It cannot be


otherwise: it must be so. All we have got to do is
to find out, if we possibly can, what is fair under the
circumstances. Surely the lion, member, Mr. Munro,
will recognise that the majority which you will be
able to command in the popular branch of the
assembly ought to be sufficient for all practical
purposes ?
Mr. Munro ; Not if it is checkmated in the other
chamber!
Mr. KINGSTON: Does the hon. delegate desire
that the same sway should be exercised by the larger
states in the senate as is enjoyed in the assembly ?
Mr. Munro ; No, I only want fair play !
Mr. KINGSTON : There must be a check, and a
substantial check, and if the smaller states are only
going to be offered something which is nominally a
check, and which will not stand the test of time
and use, it appears to mo difficult to suppose that
there will be any disposition on their pai’t to enter
into an alliance, by which they practically subordinate
their powers and interests in every federal question
to the decision of the majority in the national
assembly. It is suggested that the smaller states
Colonel Smith : Will govern the lot!
Mr. KINGSTON : Will govern the lot; but when
the claims of extra population arc recognised in a
national assembly, is not that a sufficient safeguard ?
Mr. Munro : No !
Mr. KINGSTON: Well, it appears to mo that
we are either going to have a senate worthy of the
name or that we are not. If we are to have a senate
exercising no practical control over the course of
legislation, we had better have only one chamber.
If we are going to have two houses, let us have them
possessing mutual control, the one over the other;
and, as regards the possibility of collision between
the two, I have already dwelt on the similarity of
constitution which wmuld prevent the probability of
such a clashing. lam willing to meet the views of
hon. delegates in any way which may be suggested
for the purpose of bringing the two houses collectively,
or the one house—the senate—into touch w T ith the
popular sentiment. The periodical elections, it
,appeals to me, will have such an effect; but I have
heard a further suggestion, that it might be provided
in the federal constitution that in the case of a penal
dissolution of the Assembly a certain proportion of
the senators might be sent to the country.
Mr. Play ford : Send them all!
Mr. KINGSTON : Or send them all. They would
have nothing to fear if they were faithfully repre-
senting the interests of which they had charge, but
so long as w r e recognise, as we must recognise, the
existence of state rights, so long as we appreciate the
fact that the allaying of the apprehensions of the
smaller colonies as to their practical extinction in the
federal parliament is an essential to their approval of
any scheme of federation, lam sure that w T e must see
that it will be desirable to confer on the senate really,
and not simply nominally important powers. In this
respect, meeting the objection which has been urged
by the hon. delegate from Victoria, Mr. Munro, I say
that it does not appear to me necessary to make the
two houses of exactly co-ordinate jurisdiction. Ido
think that they should have a power which was
suggested by the hon. delegate from Queensland, Sir
Samuel Griffith, namely, the power of veto in detail
in respect to money bills. I think that if that power
is conceded —the power of which they are sought to
be deprived by the resolutions which it is our duty to
consider—no very great objection could be urged to
the national assembly retaining the power of origi-
nating money bills and indeed I do not know that I
follow the argument which has been advanced by
some, that it is necessary, if we give the power of
amending money bills to the senate, to give them also
control over the executive.
Mr. Playford : No doubt about that!
Mr. KINGSTON: There may be more in the
argument than at first sight appears; but I confess
that when those who opposed the strengthening of
the senate, by conferring upon it the poAver of vetoing
money bills in detail, argued that if you conferred
that poAA'er, you must also giA'e them control over the
executiA'e, 1 failed to folloAV the argument. And
dealing Avith another argument Avhich has been
advanced—that responsible government is incom-
patible with a parliament consisting of tAA'o
chambers, one possessing the power, of vetoing
money bills ; if there is anything in that argument —
and I confess that I do not see any great force
in it—Avhat is the result when it is folloAved out ?
Why, Ave are simply brought face to face with the
proposition, is it essential to the establishment of a
federal constitution that Ave should have a system of
responsible government —a system, as has been
pointed out by the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith,
Avhich in its present form has been the growth of
comparatively recent years ? There is no constitu-
tion Avhich I knoAV of in existence in Australia, or in
any other British community, which provides Avith in
its four corners, Avith the definiteness Avhich is pro-
posed by this resolution, that there shall be respon-
sible government —that there shall be an executive,
Avhose existence must depend on the goodAvill and
support of the popular house. It appears to me that
there is no such constitution in existence ; and as has
been pointed out by the hon. member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, in the absence of such a provision respon-
sible gOA'ernment in its ordinary sense can hardly be
deemed an essential of any Australian Constitution.
I thoroughly agree with the suggestion, that when
we are initiating a system, the effect of Avhich we
cannot fully estimate at the present moment, but
which time must prove, it is highly desirable to alloAV
the utmost room for alteration in practice —to allow
the greatest elasticity, so that from time to time such
amendments may be made in the practical Avorking
of the constitution as may be found to be necessary.
I think under these circumstances that there is much
to recommend it in the suggestion that the resolution
should be amended by the omission of the express
provision on the subject which we at present find
contained in it. Further, if it is a question of
federation Avith two chambers of almost co-ordinate
jurisdiction and AA'ithout responsible government, or
no federation, 1 think there is a very great deal to
drive us to the conclusion that AA'e should be war-
ranted at least in submitting to the consideration of
the people of the different colonies a scheme which
provided for federation even without responsible
government. Of course, it is not desirable to com-
plicate the initiation of this system by the intro-
duction of novelties. No doubt a continuance of the
existing practice of responsible government Avould be
more readily accepted by the people of the various
states by whom it is Avell understood; but, at the
same time, we, having experience of the working of
responsible government, must confess that the sys-
tem is not Avithout its disadvantages, though of course
it is much easier to criticise than to suggest reforms.
If Ave are satisfied by the various arguments which
have been expressed to us that responsible government
is incompatible with a parliament composed of tAvo
houses, and possessing the jurisdiction to which I
have referred, it is our duty to consider Avhether AA'e
should not provide for such a parliament without
insisting on its being accompanied by responsible
government. And Ave cannot lose sight of the fact
that in connection with the working of resjionsible
government there are various difficulties, to which I
need not refer in detail, but which continually occur,
and which in many instances have preA r ented, and no
doubt in the future will prevent, the consideration of
Avise and useful legislation simply on its merits, and
without reference to matters Avhich ought not to pre-
vail. It seems as if, from our experience, these dis


advantages are inseparable from the system. Of
course it is better that we should bear the ills with
which we are acquainted than introduce a system of
which we have no practical knowledge, and which
may be attended with even greater disadvantages;
but, at the same time, learning wisdom from the
experience of other countries, we may turn to cases
such as Switzerland, where the rights of the people
are conserved and state rights are x*ecognised to their
fullest extent, yet no system of responsible govern-
ment prevails.
Mr. Muneo : It takes a revolution to get fair play
in the states occassionally !
Mr. KINGSTON : I do not propose at this stage
to discuss that question in detail, but I am simply
inviting hon. delegates to consider the point. First,
are they satisfied that responsible government is not
compatible with a federal system consisting of two
houses of co-ordinate jurisdiction, and, if they are, to
consider whether it is essential that responsible
government should prevail, or whether we might not
adopt a system something of the character to which I
have referred. There is only one other matter to
which I desire to call attention, and that is the
question of the judiciary.
Mr. Dibbs : l)o I understand the hon. member to
say that he is in favour of giving the senate power to
amend an appropriation bill as well as an ordinary
money bill ?
Mr. KINGSTON: My present inclination—and I
think 1 am justified in expressing my views at this
stage of the proceedings in a tentative form —is to
give the senate the right of amending all money bills—
not of increasing the burden, but simply of exercising
the power of veto in detail.
Mr. Dibbs : With regard to appropriation as well
as other money bills ?
Mr. KINGSTON: My present idea is that no
exception should prevail, because, of course, in
appropriation bills, by the aids of devices of which
history affords various instances, the most important
questions can be raised, and any house which does not
possess the power of amending or vetoing money bills
in detail can be subjected to disadvantages which
practically render it powerless. I would say to the hon.
delegate that I am only desirous of insisting on the
pow r er of detail as regard money bills being vested in
the senate so far as is essential to the protection of
state rights. If it were possible to define exactly
what state rights are I should be glad enough to
limit the power of the senate to veto money bills—
allowing them to A r eto all money bills in which those
rights were involved, but I recognise very grave and
almost insuperable difficulties in the way of such a
definition ; and until I hear that these rights are
capable of definition in such a w r ay that by limiting
the power of the senate to veto in cases in which they
are involved, we shall not be prejudicially affecting
the right of the people to look to the senate as a body
charged with the duty, and intrusted with the power of
officially protecting those interests at all times —unless
a definition can be arrived at of the character to which
I refer, I shall prefer to avoid any difficulty or danger
in the matter by keeping the provisions as proposed
to an absolute right of the senate to veto in detail.
There is just one other matter to which I desire to
refer—that is, the question of the executive. There
is a provision in the Swiss constitution which requires
that no tw r o members of the executive shall be
selected from the same canton at the same time. I
think we might well have a provision of that sort in
regard to our executive, because, although in, the
natural order of things there would be a disposition
on the part of any person charged with the formation
of a federal cabinet to secure the representation of
the different colonies, there might be circumstances
under which such a disposition would not be
manifested, and it might be met by a provision of the
kind I have indicated. As regards the judiciary, one
hon. delegate, I think, has referred to the appeal to
the Queen-in-Council as a bond of union existing
between the colonies and the mother country, which
ought not to be disturbed. . In my opinion, sir, it is
a bond of union which is productive of considerable
irritation and annoyance, and I think it would
be a pity indeed if we did not, as contemplated
here, provide for the constitution of a high court of
appeal, its most important functions being the duty
of deciding constitutional questions arising between
the [federal and local parliaments, and the duty of
finally settling all disputes arising in Australia, and
dispensing with the necessity for an appeal to theQueen-
in-Council. There is one other matter in connection
with the question of the establishment of a federal
judiciary of which we ought not' to lose sight. I
should be glad indeed to see a federal tribunal
establishment for the settlement of industrial dis-
putes. It seems to me that there are no matters of
greater importance, in view of our vast commercial
and manufacturing interests, than the adjustment of
disputes between employers and employes. Various
efforts are being made in the different colonies for
the establishment of boards of conciliation and
arbitration having this end in view ; but on account
of the extensive ramifications ol the various organiza-
tions on one side and the other, it appears to me that
local legislation is incompetent to deal satisfactorily
with the question; and I think that when we are
contemplating the question of the establishment of
federal courts, there will be no matter of greater
importance to persons actively engaged in trade or
to the general community than the supply of
facilities for the speedy settlement of troubles of the
character to which 1 have referred. At the present
moment there are practically none in any colony ;
certainly there are none which have jurisdiction
sufficient to deal with questions involving matters
beyond the territory of the particular colony*
and lam sure that the establishment of a court of
the character to which I refer would be productive
of the best results. lam sorry I have occupied the
time of the Convention at such great length. I had
not intended to trespass so long; but the matter is
one which naturally excites our interest, and on
which it is difficult to refrain from speaking fully on
the various views which affect the consideration of
the principles involved in the resolutions. I thank
the Convention for the patient hearing they have
accorded to me.
Mr. FITZGERALD: Mr. President, the hon.
member, Sir George Grey, favoured the Convention
with a speech full of interest, full of weighty matter,
and full of most interesting reminiscences. The
members of the Convention listened to him with
that respect to which his long services, his abilities,
and the page which those services will occupy in
Australian history are entitled; but in all humility I
venture at this early stage to raise my voice in
opposition to three of the principles which he
favoured. I do sincerely trust that in any federation
scheme which the Convention may sketch out, no
opportunity will be given for effecting an easy
reform of its clauses. We must remember that our
federal constitution, if it ever should be passed,
must be included in an act of the Imperial legislature
and a reform of it must be and can only be by
obtaining the consent of that sovereign body. I
sincerely trust also that this structure will have its
foundations laid so solidly and so soundly, that it
will rise up in such strength and harmony of
proportion as not to require repair for many years to
come. Another case I understood the hon. member,
Sir George Grey, to put was that he favoured the
appointment of the governor-general of the future
dominion of Australia being a colonial appointment;
But as long as this country is united to the Crown of
England —and I hope that it is a very long w ay off
indeed when it shall cease to be so : —I maintain that


the governor-general of the future dominion
of Australia must be the appointee of her
Majesty the Queen, our sovereign, who is the
apex of that structure, and whose name we revere
and respect in this colony equally as in any other
part of her Majesty's dominions. When I consider
the men with whom I have the pride and honor to
be associated in this Convention—when I look
around and see those men who have for so many
years been in the foremost ranks of politics, men of
high statesmanlike qualities, men who have fine
abilities and trained experience ; men, many of whom
it may be said, as in your case, sir, it may truly be
said, are not only statesmen but scholars —I say
that it fills me with hope, as it does every other
well-wisher of this movement, that in that combina-
tion of strength there will be found ability enough
to devise a scheme which will confirm the happiness
and prosperity of this country. No doubt the diffi-
culties that have to be overcome are numerous and
startling; but Australians, in their private life, are
accustomed to encounter dangers and to overcome
them; and I say it would augur badly for the
character of the foremost public men of this country
if they should be daunted by those difficulties, and
if they should not succeed in devising the scheme
that we all desire. Should it be otherwise, should
failure unfortunately attend this Convention, can
we doubt that the result of this debate and of the
further proceedings will awaken such enthusiasm for
this great object, that its progress must be onward,
that the plough to which we have set our hands will
not be abandoned in mid-furrow, and that, whether
this year or next, the time at all events is not far
distant when this great object will be brought to a
happy and successful conclusion ? Another subject
of congratulation is that should we agree upon a
scheme, there is, from the character of those men to
whom I have alluded, a fair and reasonable expecta-
tion that they will by their influence, by their
ability, and their patriotism, be able to convince
their fellow-colonists throughout the length and
breadth of this land —and not only their fellow-
colonists, but the parliaments of the colonies as well
—to consent to the scheme, and to surrender those
powers which it is proposed to take from them in
this scheme of federation. I consider that this
discussion is not in its academic stage, that we are
now doing work which will save time in Committee,
and that we are advancing solidly and securely the
great object we have in view. I therefore think it
would be important to refer, even before we allude
to the terms of some of these resolutions, to some of
the principles which have brought us together. If
in this discussion we are not creating, we are cer-
tainly educating public opinion in favour of this
movement, and it is necessary to set before the
public mind reasons adequate for the surrender
which we ask at their hands. A great deal has been
said about —and I think you yourself mentioned, in
terms that I wish I could equal, as regards force and
eloquence —the great advantages which union would
give to the well-being, to the power, and to the
happiness and comfort of the people of this country.
Every word of that is true ; but I go further, and
ask to put before the public mind that view which I
think is an essential of this movement, quite as great
as the other, and that is, the regard for the common
safety. I do not mean alone external security; I
do not wish to lay too much stress upon that; but I
ask that the colonies shall be preserved by union
from each other. I hold it to be irrefutable that, as
the wealth of these colonies grows, difficulties will
increase. lam persuaded that there are causes of
difference which, if met early, can be easily set
aside, but which, if allowed to grow, will iucrease
until they become subjects of national magnitude.
I say also, remembering that the antagonism
of relations is always of the most lasting kind,
that it is of the utmost importance that we
should by this federal government, by the
abolition of the causes which might lead to
this divergence of feeling, have that union
which would be a common parent to us all. This
national structure which it is proposed to erect I
hope will have one advantage which similar struc-
tures of federated states possess, and that is the
advantage of well-balanced powers. "Without it we
could have nothing but ruin and confusion ; and it
is because those powers have to be set out that these
resolutions have been submitted by you, and in a
speech the conciliatory tone of which I am sure
hon. members who preceded me have attempted to
imitate, and which it will be my duty to attempt to
imitate also. Now, sir, we have heard a great deal of
the word "rights"—territorial rights. There can be
very little difficulty in explaining them; but it is neces-
sary to say that a large and deep-seated doubt
existed in the public mind of several of the colonies
as to whether cupidity rather than patriotism was
not the moving principle of this federation scheme.
That doubt should be removed; those traducers of
our motives should be silenced, so that there may be
no possible misapprehension as to why these words
were introduced. If it were necessary, in order to
complete the discomfiture of those who made this a
ground of attack against the Convention, I would
desire to see further words added to place it beyond
all doubt that there should be no diminution or
absorption of any portion of the territory of any of
the contracting states or colonies, not even for the
purpose of makiug new colonies, much less for the
purpose of aggrandising one at the expense of the
other, without the consent absolutely freely expressed
of the colony interested. With regard to the sur-
renders that may be agreed to I am greatly pleased
to find that there has been no hon. member yet who
did not express his full concurrence in the language
of these resolutions. Every one of us knows that in
order to form a national government there must be
an absorption of some of the functions of those
states or colonies which form that government; and
it has been announced, and it is a settled conviction in
all our minds, that not one iota is to be taken from
any one of the contracting states beyond that which
is absolutely necessary for the formation of a
national government. It is equally necessary for
that government to be clothed with sufficient power
to attain the national objects for which it comes into
existence; and if it is so invested it follows as a
necessary sequence that it must be endowed with a
revenue sufficient for its objects. We come now to
the question, how that revenue is to be obtained. It
is said in the resolutions that it is to be obtained
from the customs of the various colonies; but before
alluding to that I will just deal with No. 2 of the
resolutions —and here, sir, if I travel over ground
that has been already most fully and ably dealt with,
I apprehend that I may reasonably ask the indul-
gence of the Convention, because it appears to me
that it is of the utmost consequence that there should
be no possible mistake outside as to what the lan-
guage of these resolutions is, and what the members
of this Convention mean. Previous speakers have
explained to us fully and ably the difficulties that
will beset us on the road on which we are travelling.
But we have a distinct and clear object in view. We
see the goal at which we aim, and it is the settled,
determined conviction, I honestly believe, of every
member of this Convention, that so far as earnestness,
perseverance, patience, and devotion to the duties
which he is commissioned here to discharge are
concerned, none will be wanting to reach that goal
fairly and securely. It is true that we are only a
consultative body. It is true that the absolute
acceptance or rejection of any scheme that we may
form rests with those outside—with those whose
commission we hold, namely, the people of the


various colonies ; but nevertheless it is our duty, as
far as our abilities enable us, to present to them a
scheme which we can honestly recommend and
which it will be our duty afterwards to defend, and
if possible see carried into law. The 2nd resolution
says:
That the trade and intercourse between the federated
Colonies . . . shall be absolutely free.
I heard hon. members express the hope that the
language of this resolution would be made clearer,
and that it would be explained to the outside world
that no change should be made in the present fiscal
systems of this country until the federation of the
colonies is complete, and until a new system of taxa-
tion has become law. What necessity is there to
declare that ? Can it be believed that men coming
here trained in commerce, law, and finance, could
be a party to a scheme, could be at all identified
with any movement, the basis of which would
be an injustice to that section of the people
to advance whose interests our highest efforts
should be directed ; and is it necessary that we
should give any guarantee either to those who, advo-
cating protection, have expended their money for the
advancement of some object under the shadow of
that law, or to those who, under free-trade, have
built warehouses, and have enlarged and done every-
thing to expand commerce —to open the doors to the
wide world—is it necessary for us to tell them that
if a new system of taxation is agreed on which will
savour of injustice, which will bear any stamp of
neglect, to them will be extended the same protection
as to those on the other side ? Let us give any
guarantees that will be required, whether for a year
or two or five years. What is that in the history of
this great country r But if it were longer, because
it would be just to make it longer, I say let every-
thing go, but let justice stand, and let not our first
efforts in this direction give to anybody the right to
say that our federal scheme was stamped with any
semblance of injustice. The free interchange of
commodities—what does that mean among the family
relations, as I call the people of this country, but
offering facilities for domestic exchange ? Is it not
one of the blots on the fair fame of this country that
with these artificial lines and barriers we cannot pass
from one country to the other without being asked,
“ What do those portmanteaus of yours contain ? ”
Why, everybody feels that if it was only when
we were in a state of pupilage that such mon-
strosities could continue to exist, and now that we
have attained manhood this is our first effort in
acknowledgment of that fact. The people of Aus-
tralia have stretched their limbs. They feel them-
selves animated by that high spirit which characterised
their ancestors. They feel within them that they are
doing a duty inspired by the same motives as those
of their race before them. They know that men of
their race have fashioned and formed a large portion
of the globe in a manner that redounds to their honor
and credit, and to the freedom of the world. They
know that you cannot advance this country without
adding to the wealth, and the national importance,
and the power of that grand empire to which we
belong, and they know that the expansion of the
empire means the happiness and the freedom of
everybody who lives under the protection of its flag,
and here let me say that I listened with the deepest
attention to the account given by the hon. member,
Sir Greorge G-rey, of his conversations with Lord
Salisbury, and the interest that was taken by that
great statesman in these colonies. That was not Only
interesting; in my opinion, it is pregnant with the
greatest possible importance. To men like Lord
Salisbury and others of the foremost statesmen of
England who have come to these colonies, and
have had the opportunity of exchanging opinions
with men like the hon. member, Sir Greorge
Grey, and others of his breadth of view and
long experience and high ability, I attribute the
happy change that has come over public feeling
among the foremost politicians of England. The time
is not far distant—it is indeed within the recollection
of all of us —when there was a large and influential
party in England who were prepared to lay down the
diadem of empire. There was a large party in
England who considered that these colonies were an
encumbrance rather than a benefit to the empire.
Happily those times are passed, and happily, owing
to the interference of those men who understood the
resources, who were convinced of the deep-seated
loyalty and affection for the old country which exists
in this new land, the policy has changed. That effete,
effeminate policy is now changed ijito a love for the
most distant part of the empire solong as that empire
is true to the traditions of the old land and loyal to
its sovereign. Now, I come to the next part of the
question —to the customs and the policy which may
come from their transfer. You told us, sir, in terms
as eloquent as they were generous and patriotic, that,
if under this new federation the public voice of this
country and the will of the people should be expressed
in favour of a protective policy, you, though not
convinced and always struggling against it, would
nevertheless bow to that decision. That exactly
expresses the opinion of a number of men in the
neighbouring colony of Victoria who, twenty years
ago, fought this battle —fought it valiantly —who,
when after the usual checks and delays which were
necessary to ascertain the true feeling of the country,
it was unequivocally ascertained, as it will be your
experience in this colony, and all over the colonial
empire, that modern democracy leans in the direction
of protection, and was resolved upon having it as the
law of the land, bowed .and accepted it. I am not
convinced. Educated in the school of belief that
freedom of trade was the foundation of a people's
comfort and happiness, I nevertheless feel, like others,
some difficulty in answering as to whether the pre-
dictions that I uttered twenty years ago, in my place
in Parliament and outside, have been verified—
whether that national impoverishment which we all
predicted has followed the protective policy. I have
no hesitation in saying that it has not. I have no
hesitation in saying that, whether the resources of
that colony have been too great to be ruined, or
whether the colony through the new policy has made
its present position, it has during those twenty years
make enormous strides. And I hold that its example,
whether it be one of good or of evil omen, is bound
to inoculate the neighbouring people, and we may as
well regard it as a fact, as true as if we saw it written
in lead, that that will be the policy of federated
Australia. That is not our duty now. We have
nothing now to do with it; but this we have to do
with, and to regard : that if that policy of protection
cause the transfer to other colonies of those manu-
factures which have arisen in the older colonies
which have adopted protection, we must recognise
the fact that the customs revenue will be largely
affected, and that in all probability the new national
federal government will require to look to other
forms of taxation for those works which will bo
necessary for the due discharge of its duties. I
intend to give only a passing glance at the subject of
defence, but, in doing so, I must acknowledge that as
regards defence I recognise that it will be indeed a
long time before we have the happiness to welcome
that great, that lovely colony of New Zealand as a
portion of federated Australia. I feel that this
scheme of federal defence, as regards military matters,
will never be found by New Zealand to be of any
value to that country, and, as regards naval defence,
the day is far distant when these colonies will be able
to afford to expend such large sums in naval defence as
to warrant them in sending their ships across that
stretch of ocean which divides us —unhappily divides


us —from that great colony. Our system of naval
defence for a long time to come will not consist of
any ships larger than are necessary to protect our
ports against cruisers; and those coal ports to which
the hon. member, Captain Eussell, alluded must, as
they naturally are a portion of the strength of the
empire, remain to be defended by the strong arm of
England. With regard to the defence of Australia,
in what could federation do more practical good than
in defence ? In what matter can there be a greater
necessity for one headship than in defence? The
points which must be defended, which strengthen us
in these colonies, are far distant, and how can wo
efficiently or economically defend them, except by
having a united force—a force which will be under
one head, and Avhich will be ready at any point should
our country ever be invaded. Eeference was made
to a standing army. A standing army! What a
reflection upon the military spirit of young Aus-
tralia. A standing army we may have merely as an
example of what steadiness, discipline, and obedience
can do ; but our defence must be the stout arms of
our sons —our own sons as a militia, charged with
the duty of defending that land which they ought to
love, and inspired by the devotion of those men who
may be paid servants of the Crown, but who never,
either in this country or in the old country, turned
their back on an enemy, or did anything but what
Avill redound to the glory of English arms. The
next point, which I may call the first of the
machinery clauses, has been so ably and so fully dis-
cussed that I really have to apologise to hon. mem-
bers for doing more than glance at it. But before I
do that I must discharge what I feel is my bounden
duty—a duty that is incumbent on me from a feeling
of honor, for I confess that, being the oldest mem-
ber in the Legislative Council in Victoria, I feel that
an attack upon the corporate honor of that House is
to me worse than an attack on my private honor.
My hon. and learned friend, Mr. Deakin, with that
dialectic skill of which he is the master, made a
veiled attack upon that House.
Hon. Members : No !
Mr. FITZGrEEALD : I say it was an attack on
that house.
Mr. Deakin : Which house ?
Mr. EITZGEEALD : The Legislative Council of
Victoria. He clothes his attack on that house with
a thin veil, Avhich I tear away, because I Avant to hold
up the perfect truth. The lion, gentleman said :
We have heard of an upper chamber, which has been com-
pelled to pass measures demanded by the people,
revenge itself on the government in power, and on the
house that compelled the upper chamber to pass these
measures, by emasculating or rejecting other measures,
in order to prove that the government could not carry
on the business.
That is a very serious imputation. The hon. mem-
ber said that the particular offender lived in remote
times and in distant countries. The times are not
too remote for me to acknoAvledge that I was an
actor in every scene in which that house Avas in con-
flict with the Legislative Assembly. The country is
not too remote for me to knoAv that that hon. gentle-
man is far too young to do more than speak of it
as a matter of history; but it is the fashion Avith
some Avho read history obliquely—some Avho are
brought up in an atmosphere of Avhat I call demo-
cratic dilettanteism—that unless the vieAv presented
to them is of their own formation—unless it is such
as their eyes are accustomed to look upon—nothing
is straight, nothing is honorable, nothing is pure.
Noav the history of that struggle is one of the dark
spots on the history of that colony ; but I truly say
that the Legislative Council
An Hon. Member : Oh, oh !
Mr. FITZGrEEALD : “ The galled jade may Avince,
our withers are umvrung.” We had to face a struggle
then which Avas truly one of cyclonic force. We had
one such as may heaven avert from this new federal
government whenever it comes into existence. We
had one which sets out an example for every hon.
member of this Convention to keep constantly before
his mind. We had a case where, if ever, the consti-
tution was rigid and its terms were such as to prevent
its being misunderstood; still we had the law
invoked in the name of passion and set aside. In
that case we had power given for one purpose misused
in order to apply it to another. Who succeeded in
the struggle P Grod forbid that I should claim that
a victory between two constituent houses of parlia-
ment, both working for the common good of their
country, should ever be a thing of which to boast.
I call it not a victory ; but I say that the issue of
that struggle, at all events, has warned any succeeding
government against renewing the attack. I pass
away from it with pleasure ; but I hope that hon.
members will excuse me if I have imparted into this
explanation any word of warmth.
Mr. Deakin : The hon. member is not warm!
Mr. ITTZGrEEALD : One is not only warmed,
but boiling, to find that the truth can be set aside—
of course not wilfully—far be it for me to impute
that —but that truth can be set aside, history can be
turned upside down in order to make a point, to
illustrate, and to demand powers for this new repre-
sentative house under this new federal government
which would place the whole power of this country
in one branch of the legislature. I have very few
Avords more to say. I feel that I am more than
indebted to hon. members for the patience which
they have extended to me; and it would be in the
highest degree ungrateful on my part if I were to
reward that kindness by improperly or unnecessarily
delaying my remarks. The next sub-section reads :
A parliament, to consist of a senate and a house of repre-
sentatives, the former consisting of an equal number
of members from each province, to be elected by a
system which shall provide for the retirement of one-
third of the members every years, so securing
to the body itself a perpetual existence combined with
definite responsibility to the electors, the latter to be
elected by districts formed on a population basis, and
to possess the sole power of originating and amending
all bills appropriating revenue or imposing taxation.
I ask where is the point of the remarks we have
heard about the necessity of the members of the
senate representing the states in equal proportions
being elected by the people, being responsible to the
people, being liable to be sent back to the people if
ever they dared to exercise the privilege of disagree-
ment with the more popular house P Some of these
observations could well have been delayed until the
hon. gentlemen who indulged in them go back to
their own colony, where they can use them with
the weight and influence which, I have no doubt,
they will command, after their colony has settled and
determined in what form its representatives shall be
elected. It is wasting time, I say with all respect,
for us to be reasoning when each colony will be
master of the form in Avhich that election shall take
place. I have my own conviction as to what should
be done, but I shall not trouble hon. gentlemen by
stating it. I only do what I am sure every member
of the convention does, and that is to offer a most
fervent prayer that Avhatever form of election may
be decided upon the men appointed will be worthy
of the high position to which they will be raised.
Let them appoint them hoAv they will, I, sir, from a
long experience of a particular house, know that
when they enter the chamber they will come
under its traditional influence; they will recog-
nise the responsibility of their position, and the
greater the responsibility and the higher the stan-
dard which you expect these men to reach the more
certain will you be to get the best men, "While we
have admired the eloquence and force and fluency of
those men who indulge in speeches about facing the
people, cannot any one of us lay his hand on his
heart and say, “ We acknowledge the majesty of the


people quite as much as those eloquent defenders,
and it is because we desire to protect the people
against their own burst of passion, against their own
frailties, against their own impulses, that we want to
put a bit in the mouths of their representatives.” It
is in the interests of the people for the people, and
we hold, as I have often said, that the best friends of
the people are not their flatterers. We then want a
senate which will not be a vulgar obstacle to the
people’s will, but a house clothed with all the checks
necessary to ascertain the people’s will. But never
let it be thought that our superstructure will ever be
lasting if any clause in our charter allows the people’s
will in its burst and flush of impetuosity at once to
reach the statute-book. That is not what the sober-
thinking, solid, and—l will use the word—conserva-
tive senate is for. The conservative senate is to be
there to put a check upon the people’s will —not to
oppose it obstinately, not to oppose any law upon
which the people are determined from finding its way
to the statute-book, but, as I said before, to moderate
that force which comes at times over communities,
and which would sweep us all away if there were not
men of courage and of resolution, to stand behind the
impregnable position in which the law places them,
and wait for the mollifying influences of time to test
their judgment—in sober reason, away from the
seductive voices of agitators, and of those who think
that the people are served by opposing everybody
who stand between them and their own will, to wait
and see if time does not, with its mollifying influence,
bring the people to consider and to recognise that
their supposed quondam enemies were their best and
their truest friends. Now, how can it be said, how can
it be argued, that if this emasculated charter were given
to tho senate of federated Australia, that senate
would be able to occupy the position that I have
endeavoured briefly to shadow forth as that which it
ought to occupy ? "What is the use of offering to that
senate co-ordinate power in legislation, and denying
it to them as regards money? Why, look at the list
of measures which is put forward as the alpha and
omega of the powers that the federal parliament is to
be intrusted with.
Sir John Brat : There is no list!
Mr. FITZGERALD: The list was read by my
hon. friend, the Premier of Victoria. It is printed
in Hansard and I should most willingly read it if I
thought that hon. members desired it to be read.
The list was considered—and I have not heard any
one disagree with it—to sketch out what would be
deemed a just, reasonable, and proper list of measures
for the various parliaments to be denuded of, and for
the national parliament to be clothed with. The list,
if hon. members will take the trouble to look at it,
contains no measure of any consequence of which
money is not the keystone. There is not one single
measure in that category which could not, by the deft
turn of a draftman’s pen, be converted into a money
bill. Let us understand, then, where we are going
to. Let us know the full consequences of what we
are doing. We are absolutely, then, denying in toto to
the senate, or whatever it may be called, any power
in legislation whatever except the power of veto.
I do not want to hold before hon. members any
threat as to what will happen then. The senate
of this federal parliament should, if they exer-
cise that power at a time when a gale of
cyclonic force is raging, would be then in the position
not of being judged by the particular point or clause
in the bill which they objected to, but they would be
charged with throwing the whole country into con-
fusion by rejecting a bill which was necessary to en-
able the work of government to go on. What
remedy was left to them ? Nothing, except to adopt
or reject it. Is that the dignified position you would
like the senate of the great federal dominion of
Australia to occupy? Is that a position which
would reassure the smaller states as to their safety ?
What do we ask the states to do ? My hon. friend,
Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, told us in words of a solid,
sensible kind, which we all remember, and which
made a deep impression upon me, that the states are
asked to go into a happy partnership, to join us in a
confederation, we promising them that in every way
their rights shall be maintained and protected. My
hon. friend, Mr. Deakin, asks what are state rights.
If he does not know, or if he asks simply for tho
purpose of making an effective point in the debate—
but I can hardly believe that he does not know what
state rights are. What is meant by state rights in
this connection is, that every privilege which a stato
has in its isolated condition—that is, the right of
saying whether any measure shall be made law or not
—shall still be preserved to that state in the federal
senate. State rights with regard to territorial rights
we have explained; state rights as to material in-
terests of states we understand; and I say the only
link wanting to make the chain complete is to assert
that the states shall have and are promised in equal
proportions, no matter what their size or population,
a voice in legislation equal to that which they would
have in their independent parliament, and that if
their representatives do not wish a money bill, or a
clause in a money bill, to pass, they shall have the
right to say " No." Therefore, when you ask them
to come in, you ask them on this condition : that they
shall come in in a duplex position ; that they shall
come in as states of Australia ; states that are —I use
the word in its limited sense —sovereign states, inde-
pendent in everything except that tie of allegiance to
our grand mother country, which I hope will ever bo
preserved. The states are asked to surrender what ?
To surrender the powers which they now possess ;
but when they come in, you disregard their area;
you disregard their population, and you promise the
smallest colony equal power and equal voice in the
senate with the biggest. What is the use, sir, of
offering that in one hand, and, with the other, taking
it away ?If the whole legislation that can affect tho
states concerns money, and if their representatives in
the senate have no power over that money, except to
reject it, I ask, how can you hope to get the small
states to enter the confederacy ? The great colony
of Victoria and the great colony of New South
Wales, rivalry has kept apart. In this new govern-
ment that rivalry will disappear; nobler thoughts
will arise ; they will become members of one family;
there will be no more of these petty jealousies which
have hitherto marred, not only their progress, but
their history ; they will be as one family. Let them
unite —let them determine upon a course of action.
And lam reminded, and it must be within your
memory, sir, that, some years ago, in the Federal
Council sitting at Hobart, a representative of a large
and popular colony proposed —knowing that without
revenue the council would be worth little —that its
revenue should bo derived from the total pro-
ceeds of the public lands of the colonies, not
only from the sale, but also from the occupation
of lands. The colony which he represented had
little or no lands left unsold, and little or no
lands unoccupied: all its lands were alienated.
The revenue of the Federal Council was to be
derived by filching funds from the other colonies
which came into the council simply to join a happy
family. The motion was rejected, and rejected pro-
perly —rejected with that honor which I hope will
characterise public men in Australia wherever they
meet. But is it not a warning to us ? Lot the
small states consider that when they go into the
representative house, and they are at the mercy of
the more populous states, election being according to
population, some taxation proposals may be brought
forward. Let me put forward as an illustration an
excise duty on fruit or jam in Tasmania. Suppose
that the assembly sends this proposal forward to the
senate, and the representative of Tasmania states


that it means ruin to his country. I wonder where
would be the justice of that proceeding. The duty
would be part of a. number of items for taxation ; it
would be part of the wffiole taxation proposals of the
government; and yet you are asked seriously and
deliberately, and asked with force and eloquence,
from an ultra-democratic view, to sweep away any
limitation to the power of that house. You are
asked to propose an elective house ; you are asked to
found an elective despotism —for concentrating the
whole power of the government in one house is
nothing else but a despotism. I appeal to hon. mem-
bers, I appeal to the great thinking, reasoning
minds, wherever they may be, over the continent of
Australia, is it unjust that we should stand out for
the preservation of that right to the smaller states,
upon the possession of which right alone we can in
justice ask them to join the federation ? I shall not
occupy the time of hon. members much longer. I
did intend to speak about the judiciary, and as it will
only be a word, perhaps I may say it. I have the
very highest respect for the supreme court judges of
the various colonies. I have the pleasure of being
intimate with many of them. I have had many
opportunities of observing their legal acumen, their
high abilities, and their high character; but I still
say, without in the slightest degree reflecting upon
them, that I hope wiser counsels will prevail in this
Convention; that we shall never sever that link
which binds us to the throne of England by making
the sovereign the fountain of justice. I sincerely
trust that no change will be made in that system,
which I have not yet heard complained of, and which,
if altered, might be the means, and the very serious
means, of stopping capital from flowing into this
country. And now, sir, I will conclude by saying
that I trust the labours of this Convention will end
successfully. I hope, looking over the vast territory
of this great continent, having regard to its pro-
digious resources, acknowledging the bounty of the
Almighty in bestowing upon us such a grand inheri-
ance; considering the rapidity and solidity with
which we-have advanced, a rapidity which has dis-
covered for us a page very high in the history of
human progress, and seeing that we have now an
opportunity to gather together the scattered elements
of our enormous wealth—enormous whether under
or above the surface —that we shall in our efforts to
improve the condition of this prosperous, though
sometimes restless and energetic, people, so act, that
they may under one flag, and one constitution, enjoy
all those blessings whch it should be our earnest
endeavour to preserve and consolidate.
Motion (by Mr. Dibbs) agreed to:
That the debate be now adjourned until to-morrow.

ADDRESSES.
Mr. McMillan presented an address from the
Australasian Wesleyan Methodist Conference, which
was read by the Secretary as follows:
To the President and Members of the Federation Convention
of Australasia.
We, the ministers of the New South Wales and Queens-
land Conference of the Australasian Wesleyan Methodist
Church, now in session, desire to approach the Federation
Convention assembled in the city of Sydney, with assurances
of the deep interest taken by our church in the great question
intrusted to you, and of our high sense of the vast importance
of your deliberations.
And we trust that under Divine guidance you may be led
to conclusions which will advance the best interests of
Australasia;
The following addresses were also read by the
Secretary: —
Women’s Christian Temperance Union of Victoria,
Melbourne, 5 March, 1891.
To the President and Delegates of the Federation Convention.
Gentlemen, —It is with deep interest that the Women’s
Christian Temperance Union regards the movement which has
called your body together, namely, the federation of the
Australian colonies.
May they not hope that in this enlightened age the last-born
nation of the world may have embodied in its Constitution
universal suffrage without regard to sex ; and the prohibition
of the drink traffic by the vote of the people, except for
medicinal and scientific purposes.
We ask for this in the name of the God of heaven, and in
the interests of the home, the church, and State.
President, M. M. Love.
Secretary, M. E. Kirk.
Adelaide, 6 March, 1891.
Hon. T. Playford, Federation Convention.
Please convey President congratulations from South Aus-
tralia Literary Society’s Union, membership 1,500, on opening
National Australasian Convention, earnestly hoping the result
will be the adoption of a Constitution for United Australia.
Alan Campbell, President.
Melbourne, 9 March, 1891.
Sir Henry Parkes, G.C.M.G.,
President of the Federation Convention.
The Improvement Societies’ Union of 1 ictoria offers its
respectful congratulations to the Convention on the commence-

Victorian Chamber of Manufactures,
Melbourne, 5 March, 1891.
To the Hon. Sir Henry Parkes, Premier of New South Wales.
Dear Sir, —I am instructed by the chairman of this chamber
to forward to you the underwritten copy of a resolution
carried at its meeting held on the 2nd instant, and it is hoped
that you will take the earliest suitable opportunity for moving
in the direction indicated thereby, as it seems to this chamber
to be a matter that will in the not far distant future have a
very important bearing upon the vital interests of these
colonies, especially in view of the action of the United States’
Government with reference to the McKinley tariff.
“ That in the opinion of this chamber Parliament should
have power to impose differential duties in favour of Great
Britain and British possessions.”
I have, &c.,
W. W. C. Dabvall,
Hon. Secretary.
FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.
FIFTH DAY’S DEBATE.
Debate resumed on resolutions proposed by Sir
Henry Parkes (vide page 11).
Mr. DIBBS: Sir, I have listened with patience
and interest to the speeches which have been
delivered by the distinguished men who have pre-
ceded me, and I must confess to a feeling of nervous-
ness in attempting to follow the speeches that have
been delivered and in attempting to add anything
to the arguments that have been used. And yet I
venture to think that in the main the important
speeches that have been delivered have to a
certain extent but touched the fringe of the
question of federation. If 1 were asked my opinion
as to who was the speaker who dealt most boldly
and vigorously with that which is to be the centre
and basis on which a federation of the colonies can
take place, I should say that it was my hon. friend,
Sir Thomas Mcllwraith. We have had from very
able speakers, namely, the hon. members, Sir Samuel
Griffith, Mr. Deakin, and Mr. Barton, a clever
discussion as to one phase of the federation
question ; that is, with regard to state rights. No
doubt that is one of those questions which will have
to be dealt with by the Convention in due time ; but
it appears to me that we are just a little in advance
Hon. Secretary.


in dealing with the question of state rights before we
agree among ourselves as to what is to be the real
basis upon which federation shall take place. As,
however, the debate proceeding upon the resolutions
which you, sir, have moved, has taken the shape of a
discussion of the question of state rights, it would,
perhaps, be more convenient to the convention if I
now said a few words on that subject. So far as I
have heard, and I have paid the utmost attention to
the arguments used, the contention is conclusively in
favour of making the senate a strong and powerful
body in the interests of the whole of Australasia,
and in the interest of each particular colony. If we
wish the federal government to be respected; if we
wish the federal constitution to be based upon equity
and justice, those who differ from the proposals of
the hon. members, Sir Samuel Griffiths and Mr.
Barton, with regard to placing the states in a position
of fair representation in the senate, must yield at
once, and with the best possible grace. The whole
question of federation will come to grief, and be a
lamentable failure, if the suggestions of those hon.
members are not carried out. The very difficulty
which has presented itself to this convention, at the
threshold of our meeting, was one of the main
difficulties which pressed themselves upon the great
men who, a hundred years ago, met to settle a
constitution for the United States. I have no doubt
that every argument which has been used on both
sides of this convention was freely used by the able
men who debated the question a hundred years ago,
and a settlement was arrived at by giving effect to
the view advocated by Sir Samuel Griffith, that the
smaller states especially should have a guarantee of
security by the method which he proposes ; and
unless such a compromise had been made in the case
of the American Constitution there would have been
no constitution for the United States at all. As far
as I can read, a difficulty arose upon the very question
which we have been debating here. The state of
Connecticut took up the running, and in a book
which is in the hands of hon. members, “ The Civil
G-overnment of the United States,” by Bisk, I find a
short passage which strongly illustrates what was
argued then and what has been argued here ; and it
shows the wisdom of the conclusion arrived at by the
men who established the American Constitution,
which has borne the battle and the breeze for 100
years. Personally, I have an objection to the use
of quotations from books ; but this is one bearing so
strongly upon the issues involved here that I am sure
hon. members will permit me to read it: —
This feature of the House of Representatives caused the
smaller states in the convention to oppose the whole scheme
of constructing a new government. They were determined
that great and small states should have equal weight in
congress. Their steadfast opposition threatened to ruin
everything, when, fortunately, a method of compromise was
discovered. It was intended that the national legislature, in
imitation of the state legislatures, should have an upper
house, or senate, and at first the advocates of a strong national
government proposed that the senate also should represent
population, thus differing from the lower house only in the way
in which we have seen that it generally differed in the several
states. But it happened that in the state of Connecticut the
custom was peculiar. There it had always been the custom to
elect the governor and upper house by a majority vote of the
whole people, while for each township there was an equality of
representatives in the lower house. The Connecticut delegation
in the convention therefore, being familiar with a legislature in
which the two houses were composed on different principles,
suggested a compromise, “Let the House of Representatives,”
they said, “ represent the people
We propose to do that here.
and let the senate represent the states.
That is the proposal of the hon. member, Sir Samuel
Griffith.
Let all the states, great and small, be represented equally in
the federal senate.” iSuch was the famous Connecticut com-
promise. Without it the convention would probably have
broken up without accomplishing anything. When it was
adopted half the work of making the new government was
done ; for the small states having had their fears thus allayed
by an assurance that they were to be equally represented in
the senate, no longer opposed the work, but co-operated in it
most zealously.
It appears to me that the quotation I have just
read pretty well solves the difficulty which has arisen
in the early debates of this Convention, The question
is: Will you give the small states a guarantee of
security against the larger states, who may outvote
them if you establish the representation in the senate
upon the basis of population. Let us take, for ex-
ample, the small colony of Western Australia. If its
representation in the senate is based upon population,
and not on equal rights with other colonies, that
colony would simply be snuffed out of existence by
the larger colonies. Under such a state of things as
that, is it to be supposed for one moment that the
smaller colonies of Australasia would contemplate
joining the federation ? Representation on the basis
of population seems to be fair and equitable so far
as the house of representatives is concerned; but
you must give to the smaller colonies, in their re-
presentation in the senate, equal rights with those
enjoyed by the larger colonies. Unless that is done,
the whole scheme will come to grief from a want of
that spirit of compromise, equity, and justice which
ought to be shown in dealing with the smaller states.
Urom my point of view, I think that that question
has been fairly thrashed out, and that this conven-
tion will, when a division is taken upon that par-
ticular view of the question, be almost unanimous in
doing justice and equity to those smaller states,
without whose assistance the idea of federation would
be but a myth. It ought to be our duty in any pro-
posals which we make for legislation by the various
colonies, to endeavour to create a strong, powerful,
senate, which will have the confidence of the people
out of doors. We can only do that by giving a
guarantee and an assurance to the smaller colonies
that we shall not leave them in such a position that
they will be almost annexed to the larger colonies, or
simply wiped out of existence. The arguments put
forward by the gentleman I have named, and others
who have spoken on this particular phase of the
question, have, to my mind, been conclusive, and wo
must do justice if we are to expect anything like
union or federation of the various colonies. In the
case of New South Wales and Victoria we have two
large and powerful colonies. In the house of repre-
sentatives they will be enormously represented—
that seems to be fair and just. I might even put
Queensland in conjunction with New South Wales
and Victoria. In the case of South Australia, with
its moderate population; in the case of Western
Australia, with its very small population; in the case
of the hundred and odd thousand who may be repre-
sented in Tasmania, we must consult their interests,
render to them a full measure of justice and equity,
and establish a strong and powerful senate, which
will do justice to them, and which, at the same
time, will give security to the people at large.
That phase of the question has been well
thrashed out, and in the minds of. this con-
vention I think there will be but one conclusion.
But it appears to me that after all, however
interesting the debate has been, and however instruc-
tive —and I admit it has been to myself very instruc-
tive, on account of the views so ably put forward by
the speakers who have preceded me—l think we are
rather in advance of the real subject when we deal
with that phase before taking in hand the other im-
portant issues as a basis upon which federation shall
take place. Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, to use a figura-
tive, though not very elegant expression, took the
bull by the horns very boldly, and he told the con-
vention —and I am certain his remarks met with the
approval of most members of the convention—that
there was a question which should be considered in


advance of that of state rights. Are we to under-
stand that is to be the bedrock upon which federation
is to take place ? The bedrock upon which federa-
tion is to take place'appears to my mind to be that
the convention must agree among themselves, clearly
and definitely, to lay down the lines of the future
fiscal policy of Australia, and that must not be done
by inference, but be clearly laid down as one of the
principles of federation, before we can proceed one
step further in our discussion. Of course there are
other questions which will arise as we proceed in this
debate. While we are here sitting in the convention
in the interests, and probably for the good of the
whole of Australasia, I cannot shut my eyes to the
fact that I stand here to-day as a representative of
New South Wales. I am here in my place to pro-
tect the interests of New South Wales as against
those of all the other colonies, but to render at the
same time fairness and justice to all. 1 am a mem-
ber for New South Wales, and for New South Wales
I stand. Before I sit down I may say one or two
words which may, perhaps, act as a bomb-shell among
the members of this convention who may hold strong
views in an opposite direction to those which I have
uttered ; but I will let off that bomb-shell at a. later
period of the day. I may then have something to
say on a question which in itself appears to me, so
far as New South Wales is concerned, as a condition
precedent to any federation at all. The question
upon which it appears to me we ought to be unani-
mous is not, as indicated by the resolutions put
before us, the dealing with certain things and leaving
certain other things of grave importance to this
colony, and to the whole of the Australasian colonies,
to be assumed by inference. I want the convention
at the very first stage of its business to build a solid
foundation by a concurrence of opinion, upon which
a constitution may be formed at a later date. If we
fail at this stage to come to an agreement upon this
important question, then we shall fail in the end in
attaining anything like a union of the colonies. The
fiscal question is in my opinion the bedrock of the
whole structure. I was glad to hear the hon. mem-
bers, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith and Mr. FhtzGerald, and
other hon. members, touch slightly upon this ques-
tion, which is the question of all questions. Within
the walls of this building at the present moment, and
among the members of the present convention, are
gentlemen who sat in the convention to discuss the
federation question in 1884. The result of the
labours of that convention was the establishment of
a federal council, from which, owing to a variety of
reasons which need not be detailed here —but I
believe solely on account of party reasons —New
South Wales stood out in the cold. I remember
when that convention was sitting we had that great
protectionist, Mr. (now Sir Graham) Berry, and
that equally strong free-trader, Mr. James Service,
representing Victoria. At that convention a general
debate took place, unfortunately with closed doors,
and I believe the closing of the doors of that
convention had a great deal to do with New South
Wales remaining out of the Federal Council. When
the debate took place on the general question, before
we entered into any particulars with regard to the
preparation of a draft bill, I remember well asking
Mr. Graham Berry a question. I may inform the
convention, what probably most of them already
know, that at that time my eyes were not open to
the necessity of a different fiscal policy for New
South Wales from that under which she has lived
for so many years. I pointed out to the convention
that they were introducing a variety of extraneous
subjects, including, for instance, a proposal to take
possession of the Avhole of the islands of the Pacific
Ocean, and I asked the convention, specially ad-
dressing my remarks to Mr. Graham Berry, whether
that gentleman was disposed te make tho union of
the colonies depend upon a customs union ? I asked
whether the fiscal question, upon which the two
great colonies of Victoria and New South Wales had
been for so many years divided —I asked Mr. Berry
whether he was prepared to sink his views in favour
of the wishes of the majority, or whether he expected
that the interests of Victoria should prevail as against
those of all the other colonies ? 1 was met with a
direct refusal on the part of the Victorian represen-
tatives to entertain the question of the settlement of
the fiscal question in the first instance as the basis
upon which federation should take place, with a result
of which we are all well aware. Hon. gentlemen
have had the advantage of a variety of information
supplied to them from different sources. We have
even had draft bills proposed by certain hon. gentle-
men from some of the smaller colonies. We have
had everything prepared, cut and dried, in order that
federation may be almost complete when this con-
vention rises. Amongst the numerous pamphlets
which have been circulated is a very useful com-
pilation called “ Leading Facts Connected with
Federation,” from the pen of Thomas C. Just, a
resident of that important spot in the Pacific Ocean,
the island of Tasmania. This gentleman gives us
the views that were expressed on the subject when
federation was rampant, when federation was in the
air, in the year 1877, as it became in the year 1884,
and as, to a certain extent, it is in the air at the
present moment. It is gradually coming down like
one of those little balloons which we occasionally see
explode about the suburbs of Sydney. The balloon
rises, and the man comes down with a parachute.
Federation is gradually assuming a somewhat solid
form, and it is coming down to the range of practical
politics. Mr. Just offers us what I must admit were
my views at that time, and my views with regard to
the question remain unchanged to-day. The quota-
tion he gives us is from the leading paper of the
Australian colonies, and that paper is the Sydney
Morning Herald. On the 24th April, 1877, or about
that time, some correspondence appeared in the press
from a well known colonial statesman—a gentleman
who was at one time agent-general and at another
time premier of this colony, and who took a very far-
seeing view of all great political questions. I allude
to Mr William Forster —a gentleman who had the
respect of the constituencies of New South Wales,
and who never raised his voice within the walls of
this chamber without being listened to with the most
profound attention as a deep thinker. Mr. Forster
took upon himself to write certain letters to the press
of this colony on the question of federation. The
Sydney Morning Herald —I repeat again, a paper
that has the respect of the people of this colony, and
I believe is also well respected in the other colonies
as a journal of extremely moderate tone, and as one
which, as we all know, has upheld every government
within the territory of New [South Wales that has at
all favoured the policy of free-trade —the Sydney
Morning Herald , replying to Mr. Forster’s arguments,
used these words:
As to his observations upon a uniform customs tariff, it is
only necessary to point out that agreement upon the general
principles of such taxation must precede, and not follow
federation. All the colonies interested must first agree either
upon a protective system, as in America, of internal free-trade
with taxation upon imports from without, or upon a free-trade
system, as in the United Kingdom, under which specific
import duties would be levied upon articles of general con-
sumption, with corresponding excises upon the same articles
when locally produced —the one system taxing trade, the other
consumption.
I should like to ask the Victorians if they have been
converted ? I should like to ask the hon. member,
Mr. Deakin, if he has been converted to the principles
of free-trade, or does he adhere honestly to the
principles of protection ? I should like to ask the
same of Mr. Munro. I would even ask my free-
trade friend opposite, Mr. GKllies, whether he comes


here representing a people who have been converted
to free-trade ? The paper goes on to say:
Until, therefore, Victoria is converted to a free-trade policy, or
can convert her neighbours'
Colonel Smith : Who says this ?
Mr. DIBBS : The Sydney Morning Herald oi 1877 ;
and I may tell my hon. friend, Colonel Smith, that
the Sydney Morning Herald voices the opinions of
the moderate and temperate people of New South
Wales.
Until, therefore, Victoria is converted to a free-trade policy, or
can convert her neighbours to one of protection, there can be
no federal union between them.
And I believe that is the voice of the whole of New
South Wales. I leave the members from the other
great colonies, and even from the smaller colonies, to
speak for themselves on that point. The article goes
on to say : •
This is a vital question which must be agreed upon in advance,
and could not, as Mr. Forster appears to imagine, be left to be
fought out afterwards.
Now, sir, we are engaged upon the consideration of
this great work, and it appears to me that Victoria
has triumphed with regard to the principles of pro-
tection throughout the whole of Australasia, until,
at the present moment, she has attacked the citadel
of free-trade, New South Wales. Step by step, and
one by one, the principles of protection started
twenty-five years ago by Victoria have maintained
their own, and Victoria has gradually drawn South
Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand —I do not know
much about Western Australia, because she is young
in the business —but she has drawn Queensland also
into the same line of policy, the wisdom of which has
been acknowledged by the statesmen of the other
colonies, and she has at last approached to make one
last convert in order to complete the chain. And
now, Mr. President, I must congratulate you upon
being the last convert to protection. You, sir,
plainly indicate by the resolutions you have moved
that you are the last convert to protection, and that
the free-trade party can receive at your hands its
death-warrant—its nunc dimittis , I may call it.
Tree-trade in this colony has received from this con-
vention, or from its President, the Premier of the
supposed free-trade colony of New South Wales, its
death-warrant. It appears to me that Victoria has
triumphed; that what the Herald in 1877 foreshadowed
as the lines upon which federation might possibly
take place, namely, the conversion of the other
colonies to protection, has been accomplished; and
we find the Premier of the only free-trade colony
prepared to sink the fiscal question in advance, and
leave it to be settled by the federal parliament
when federation is established. 1 believe that the
people of New South Wales can look upon you
as the latest convert to the wisdom of the policy
of protection, which in twenty-five years has
pushed Victoria into the proud position in which
she stands to-day. This fiscal question has taken,
I gather from some of the speeches which have
been delivered here, an extraordinary turn. To my
surprise, I have gathered that Victoria, in discussing
the fiscal question in this Convention, is asking for
guarantees to secure the protection of her vested
interests. Now, in a foot-race where one of the
rivals has an advantage of 25 yards start in 100, one
would not ask for an assurance that the man who had
the 25 yards start should win ; or, when on the turf,
horses are handicapped by weights, one would not
ask for a guarantee that the horse with the heaviest
weight should “ play the Carbine ” in the business.
But it appears to me that Victoria has had the
effrontery to come here, and by the mouths of some
of her delegates to tell us at once that she, in any
settlement of this question, requires to have guaran-
tees for the protection of her vested interests, though
one would think that, having the advantage of twenty-
five years' start on the whole of Australasia, she
would not require anything more. We are prepared
to give her the advantage which the energy and pluck
of her people and their determination to lead the
whole of Australia, have gained for her in the twenty-
five years' start which she has had ; but we are not
prepared to give her more than that. If we are going
to deal with this matter in the liberal spirit suggested
by the press, if we are going to have, as the second
resolution puts it, intercolonial free-trade, and, if
federation is to come within a reasonable time, inter-
colonial free-trade must come at once, and the colonies
of South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, and New
South Wales will be the biggest victims, and will
make the largest sacrifice. So far, the Parliament of
New South Wales has only giveji a sort of half-
hearted approval of even the meeting of this Con-
vention, and the people have not yet been consulted
upon it at all, though in due time they will be con-
sulted, and will have the advantage of the public
education which they are now receiving upon the big
questions which concern them in giving their decision.
But coming back to this question of meeting each
other in a friendly spirit, what in the name of reason
and right does Victoria require more than the fact
that she has had the markets of pretty well the whole
of Australasia open to her for the last twenty-five
years ?
Mr. GTORDOU : As much as she can get!
Mr. DIBBS: That is the weakness of human
nature. The cry almost always is for more than the
gods give us —far more than we deserve, and more
than is our share ; but if Victoria is to approach the
other colonies in a generous and federal spirit, she
must be prepared to join in the sacrifice which she
may have to make through her manufacturers, and
must part with all the advantages which she now
possesses, and live in a wholesome competition with
those more favourably situated ; and I am prepared
to say on behalf of New South Wales that in the day
of rivalry and competition she will find that with our
magnificent resources, with our coal, and iron, and
metals unbounded, with every advantage in the way
of natural resources which a country can possess, Ave
shall be her hottest competitor. But we must start
perfectly fair and square in the race of competition,
and the claims of the various colonies must be duly
considered. I believe that South Australia, which
has always shown a generous disposition, will be
prepared to make what will be a fair offer, con-
sidering the size of the colony, and the almost
juvenile manufactures which it possesses, and New
South Wales is prepared to give to Victoria all
the advantages of her twenty-five years' start, and
to stand shoulder to shoulder with her and do the
best we can in honest competition. But I should
like the hon. member, Mr. Gillies, who I believe will
speak to-day, and whose speech will have an atten-
tive hearing from the members of the Convention
and from the people of the various colonies, to be
perfectly clear and straight, and if the speeches
which have been delivered do not voice the senti-
ments of the people of Victoria, let him, as an en-
lightened statesman, give us the assurance that Vic-
toria wants nothing more than she now possesses,
and that upon the question of federation she will ask
for no other advantages than that which she has
gained by the twenty-five years' advance in states-
manship which has been made by the people who
have ruled her destiny. I shall listen to my hon.
friend's speech with great interest. Erom conver-
sation which I have had with her delegates, I gather
that South Australia is prepared to take a liberal
view on this question, and we ask Victoria to come in
now and to throw in her lot with us. If we can get
Victoria to say that she is prepared to lay the foun-
dation-stone of a possible federation by agreeing at
once to a customs union, in advance, if need be, of
the settlement of the federation question —if she will


at once agree to throw in her lot with us, one of the
greatest difficulties in the way of federation will be
removed. But there are other big questions besides
this question of protection. The big and difficult ques-
tion of the rights to the Murray River will have to be
settled in a spirit of liberal compromise. It is one
of those questions which no doubt federation would
be the means of settling for ever, and a question
which Victorian statesmen no doubt will keep in
their mind’s-eye, and which the people of New South
Wales will always have before them in coming to
any adjustment of those bones of contention which
have by our territorial boundaries been allowed to
come between us. The magnitude of the question
was not seen at the time ; but it has developed until
it has become a cause of discord almost between the
colonies. The fiscal question, however, appears to
me to be the kernel of the whole business. It was
in 1884 ; it is so to-day ; and it will remain the prin-
ciple barrier, or, to use the expression of the Hon.
James Service, the lion in the path, to anything like
federation, unless Victoria gives a bold and generous
assurance to this Convention that she is prepared
to deal in the same liberal spirit as the two great
colonies of South Australia and Queensland with the
people of New South Wales. This being accom-
plished, other matters will fall in like a piece of mosaic.
Having laid the foundation-stone, your superstruc-
ture will rise with some prospect of being a per-
manent building ; but you will never advance one foot
towards the accomplishment of federation so long as
the fiscal question remains unsettled, and the whole
of the colonies of Australasia have the assurance by
the resolutions proposed by the President that free-
trade New South Wales is prepared to make the
fiscal question second to that of federation. The
other day a letter was published giving the opinion
of Sir Hercules Robinson upon this question; and
when I read that letter I regretted that the hon.
gentleman who had addressed Sir Hercules in the
first instance had not published the letter which he
wrote. It is a very important link in enabling one
to comprehend what Sir Hercules Robinson meant.
But what did Sir Hercules tell the Premier of this
colony ? He said, “ Give up free-trade; make a
sacrifice of free-trade to secure federation for the
people of Australia.” And it appears to me that
that is the course which you, sir, have taken. You
have accepted the advice ; and it must be the result
of your own large experience that what has hitherto
divided the great colonies pf Victoria andjNew South
AVales, and has kept the other colonies away from
New South Wales, has been the division in feeling
with regard to the fiscal question. Now, what posi-
tion has New South Wales occupied with regard to
the other colonies ? She has been practically the
mother of all the other colonies. Prom her loins
have mainly sprung the bone and sinew of the
colonies which now surround her, and she can fairly
look upon the surrounding colonies practically as her
own children.
Mr. Gordon : Some of them!
Mr. DIBBS : South Australia underwent a differ-
ent, I may say a Caesarian, operation in its birth.
The inheritance which its people now possess was cut
out from the vitals of the parent state. But, taking
the colonies of Australasia as a whole, we may say
that New South AVales is in the position of a parent
towards them. Her children have grown up vigorous
and strong around her, and they have found that she
has not been a hard step-mother to them, but rather
a loving mother. She has been the recipient of the
manufactures and the produce of her children, until,
with the haughtiness and robustness of Australian
youth, they have almost crushed the old parent out
of existence. New South AVales has been an affection-
ate mother to the people of the other colonies, inas-
much as she has received into her markets, under the
spurious system of free-trade, a large bulk of their
produce. And that brings me to the very agreeable
speech which fell from the hon. member, Captain
Russell, Now, the position of New Zealand in
regard to this fiscal question is very unique. The
hon. member, Captain Russell, told us that New
Zealand was prepared to receive the embraces of the
people of New South Wales, and indeed of the whole
of Australia; but when federation approaches any-
thing like realisation she will probably find herself in
the position of those states of the American union
which at first refused to be a part of the union, and
which compelled the states already in the union to
give them—not the tender embraces of brotherhood,
but the hug of the bear, before they saw their way to
join the union. New r South Wales has been the
principal receiver of the produce of the vast granaries
of New Zealand; and I have no doubt New Zealand
will find it to her advantage to remain outside of the
federation, if she can still have the ports of New
South Wales, under our spurious free-trade system,
and to the detriment of our own farmers, open to her.
She would no doubt like to evade the responsibility
of federation, and at the same time have our markets
open to her. But, if ever the Australian colonies, as
separate from the rest of Australasia, unite in a bond
of intercolonial free-trade, it will be most unjust to
the whole of Australia if New Zealand is allowed to
keep the advantage which she now has, of free-trade
with New South Wales, thus having all the colonies
open to her produce. New Zealand is a convert to
protection ; she has taken the bit into her own mouth,
and has left the free-trade course in which New
South Wales started her. She has struck out on the
lines of Victoria, and, as one of the converted colon-
ies, she must join w r ith us, or be left out in the cold,
if federation takes place. We cannot afford to give
her the advantages of our markets, unless she joins
with us in the federation. I say that with every
respect for our New Zealand friends, whose presence
here has lent a charm, to a large extent, to the pro-
ceedings of this Convention. Before going further,
I should like to say a word or two on the resolutions
themselves. I have no doubt that they, in due time,
will be carried pro forma ; and I have no doubt that
the real squabble will take place when we go into
Committee, and when it is proposed to amend the
resolutions so as to put them into practical shape.
On behalf of New South Wales, I would point out
that the Ist resolution which you, Mr. President,
have proposed:
That the powers and privileges and territorial rights of the
several existing colonies shall remain intact
has been put forward mainly as a sop to the people
of New South AVales. There has been a desire on
the part of the framer of these resolutions to tell the
people of New South Wales that in joining the
federation the object will be to preserve to them their
territorial rights and all the advantages of their
present position. We must not, however, be unmind-
ful of the fact that there can be no federal govern-
ment without, to a large extent, the sacrifice of
some portion of state rights ; and when the word
“ provinces” is used in this debate, I ignore its exist-
ence altogether. We have been, as it were, chaffed
out of our very existence. Those of us who have
spoken within the walls of this building, or who have
spoken out of doors to our constituents, and have
endeavoured, in discussing the federal question, to
take a strong view of the position in regard to the
defence of the rights of New South Wales, have been
pulled to pieces, and called provincialists. I object,
in connection with the independent state of New
Suoth Wales —a state as independent as any in the
world, even England itself, so far as the freedom of
our position is concerned —to the word “ province.”
There may be something more dignified in the use of
the word “ state.” We are not going to become ,
provinces. Ido not think we are going to give up '


the individual rights and liberties which, we possess,
and which those who have gone before us have fought
for, to become mere provinces under a federal form
of government. We may take the more dignified
form of “ states.” Whilst we have endeavoured to
put before the people of New South Wales, in these
resolutions, a sort of opiate, something assuring to
their minds that in joining a federal union we give up
nothing of our territorial rights, words have been
inserted in them which I shall do my utmost in com-
mittee to strike out—
except in respect to such surrenders as may be agreed upon
as necessary and incidental to the power and authority
of the national federal government.
I do not know the meaning of these words, and no
hon. gentleman who has yet spoken has given any
clear interpretation of them. It is sufficient for us,
in enunciating a principle upon which the basis of a
constitution shall be prepared, to see that the terri-
torial rights and priviliges of each colony shall be
preserved to each state ; but when you come to con-
sider the condition of a surrender, and the question
of the power of enforcing such surrender is placed in
the hands of the federal government, then your pro-
vinces or your states will be no party to the pro-
ceeding.
Mr. Gillies : The resolution does not say that.
Mr. DIBBS: Well, I shall be very glad to have
any other meaning placed upon it. It will be for the
federal Government to claim, and I take it, for the
federal government to enforce.
Mr. McMillan : The word “ surrenders” carries
its own meaning.
Mr. DIBBS : I think, in a resolution in which we
are asked to affirm the principles up on which the consti-
tution shall be constructed, that the word “powers”
in connection with the expression “ powers and
privileges and territorial rights,” might be omitted
altogether. I dread dealing with the expression
“ territorial rights,” as it may imply the taking
from the people of New South Wales that territory
which lies in such close contiguity to other and power-
ful states, and which we may say in all charity, and
in the mildest possible form, they possibly covet. I
have no doubt South Australia would like an adjustment
of territorial boundary in order to take in Broken Hill.
We have heard, and the idea comes from the preaching
of the Victorian press and Victorian statesmen —that
an equal adjustment of territorial rights might be taken
to mean the annexation of Riverina to Victoria, and
equally the modest colony of Queensland, on our
north, might find that their capital, Brisbane, might
be strengthened to a large extent by a certain portion
of the territory of New South Wales down to the
Clarence River being merged into Southern Queens-
land. These are the questions which come before
the minds of the people of New South Wales, and
upon which this Convention will have to be perfectly
clear. There must be no surrender of territorial
rights in any shape or form, save in connection with
the reconstruction of states in the future, or in con-
nection with the construction of new states. Such
division or surrender for the creation of new states
should only be by the will and consent of a tw r o-thirds
majority of the people. Resolutions 2 and 3 deal
with the question of trade intercourse, and follow, as
a matter of course, upon the creation of a federation.
There can be no federation of these colonies, no federal
form of government, unless there is unrestricted free-
trade throughout the whole of the colonies. That
goes without saying; and the power vested in the
federal government of imposing outside customs
duties is also natural and right enough. The two
resolutions, taken together, mean, by inference, that
there shall be unrestricted free-trade between the
various parties to the federal government compact,
but there must be protection against the outside world.
We now come to a most dangerous point in connection
with the proceedings of this Convention. I hope that
the 4th resolution, dealing with the question of
military and naval defence, will receive the most
anxious consideration of the delegates. I hope that
the words which fell last evening from the lips of the
hon. member, Sir George Grey —words which bear
the weight of great experience—will be taken to
heart by those who may form the federal government.
The question of creating a standing army is one which,
to my mind, is almost more repulsive than the question
of readjustment of territorial boundaries. It means
the existence in our midst of a certain number of idle
men —men sharpening their knives and their swords
for the first fitting opportunity of flushing them on the
people of their own country, because we have no other
enemies. AVe, in Australia —federated Australia, I
may take it, because the matter is one which applies
to the whole —have no enemies within our borders;
we have no Indians to dispute with us the possession
of the soil; we have no powerful Maori race, to fight,
as was once the case in New Zealand, for the terri-
tory the right to which belonged to the Maoris them-
selves. AVe have no enemies within, and the only
thing we have-to fear is the possibility of any assault
on the mother country by her enemies from without,
unless indeed the creation of a standing army proves
a menace to the people of Australia by the existence
of an armed force for unlawful purposes. This
question of the creation of a military force is one of
the blots upon these resolutions. AVe want no
military force within New South AVales. All we
want to do is to make every man who is either a
native of the soil, or one of ourselves by reason of
his taking up his residence amongst us, prepare to
resist possible invasion from without. AVho are our
enemies? AVho are our enemies but the enemies
of England, and they, so long as w r e remain under
the Crown, will be dealt with by an outer barrier,
an outer bulwark in the defence of Australia, in
the shape of the navy of Old England. But we have
no enemies within, and there is no necessity to fasten
the curse of a standing army upon us. As was pointed
out by the hon. member, Sir George Grey, yesterday,
in his interesting speech, we have no necessity to keep a
large standing army at a large cost to the people of th e
country, when we have no enemies with whom they will
have to fight. Our own police are quite sufficient for
the preservation of order within. In the event of in-
vasion from without, so long as we remain under the
Crown, our enemies, being the enemies of England,
will be dealt with before ever an attempt is made to
invade these shores; and when the day of invasion
comes the people of this country will rise as one man
to defend their hearths and homes from any possible
aggressor. I look upon the question of the creation
of a military pow r er within a territory under the
Crown as a menace to the people who are to continue
as British subjects. AVe have been sent here by our
various parliaments to frame a constitution under the
Crown—under the Crown, bear in mind. That is the
idea which has been put forward in every speech that
has been made. I presume, then, that the members
of the Convention are prepared at once to give the
go-by altogether to the idea of Imperial federation.
So long as we remain in our present position as
individual colonies, we are imperially federated, and
we can be imperially federated in no stronger manner
than in connection with our relation to the mother
country. AVe are as much imperially federated
as the people living in the cities of London, Liver-
pool, Manchester, or other large centres of popula-
tion. AVe are a portion of the British Crown, joined
together by the most solemn ties and obligations ; and
we have to bear the brunt of any misfortune which
may fall upon us in connection with any attack upon
our shores by reason of our enemies being the com-
mon enemies of England. AVe have already made
certain provision, partially of a federal character, to
assist the Imperial Government in the protection of
our shores from without; but let us set our faces as


a young nation—if I may use the word “ nation” in
advance —against standing armies ; let us set our face
once and for ever against the creation of anything
like a military despotism. We are met here under
the Crown, and I must say that, as one possessing a
slight tinge of republican notions, as one who sees
that the future of Australia is to be what was pro-
phesied of it fifty years ago, by poets who have written
of what the future of Australia is to be —having a
certain tinge of republicanism in my nature, the result
naturally of my being a descendant of an Englishman,
I was surprised to find a gentleman occupying a posi-
tion under the Crown proposing what 100 years ago
would have been simply regarded as high treason.
Why, the other day the hon. member, Mr. Munro,
made a proposal with regard to one phase of the
question which made me ejaculate, “ One strand of
the painter has gone.”
Mr. Mttneo : What was that ?
Mr. DIBBS : The hon. member proposed to take
from us, as British subjects, the chartered right which
we possess of appeal to the Crown.
Mr. Mijneo: I did not. I spoke in the other
direction!
Mr. DIBBS : The hon. member spoke of establish-
ing our appeal court, and of doing away with the
necessity of appealing to the Privy Council. The
hon. member suggested that we should have our
appeal court, and that there would be no necessity
for sending cases to the Privy Council of England.
Mr. Muneo : I said the reverse!
Mr. FitzGeeald: The hon. member said the op-
posite !
Hok. Membees : Hear, hear!
Mr. DIBBS : I am very glad to take the hon. gentle-
men’s statement, that he said the reverse. I find, then,
that I have done the hon. member an injustice. The
reason the matter made an impression upon my mind
at the moment was the speech of the hon. member,
Sir Samuel Griffith, who told us, with his astute
knoAvledge as a lawyer, that his mind was still open
on the subject, that he was prepared to hear argu-
ments on both sides of the question before making
up his mind whether to agree to the establishment of
an appeal court. However, if I have done the hon.
member, Mr. Munro, an injustice, I certainly apolo-
gise. But the hon. member, Mr. Playford, took a
more extreme view still. He proposes to take part
in the formation of a Constitution which will take
the right of veto, or of approval or dissent on the
part of the Crown to our bills, away from the Crown
altogether. That was clear enough, and that brought
forth from me the involuntary ejaculation, “There’s
another strand of the painter gone! ” And what did
I hear from our revered friend from New Zealand,
Sir George Grey? I heard a proposal of a still more
audacious character. He threw out a suggestion
for our adoption that we should stipulate for the
election of a governor-general to preside over the
federated colonies, to be elected by the people of
those colonies. In God’s name, what then is to
become of the Crown P The matter reminds me very
much of the story of “Ginx’s Baby.” After they
had been squabbling about the “territorial rights”
of that unfortunate baby until it had been kicked
overboard, the writer concluded with these extra-
ordinary words, “ Good God, what has become of the
baby?” When one hon. member proposes to cut the
Crown into mince-meat—when the hon. member, Mr.
Playford, would deprive the Crown of its right of
vetoing a bill, and when the hon. member, Sir George
Grey, would take from the Crown the right of nom-
inating, and give us the power of electing, our
governor-general, what is to become of the Crown ?
What is the Crown to be? Are we to send to Fiji
Islands for a block of wood which they use as one of
their gods, and set that up in the capital of Australia,
and say, “This is the representative of the Crown,
without power or right of veto, and of our own elec-
tion ” ?
Mr. Playeoed : What power has the Crown now ?
Mr. DIBBS: If the Crown has no power now,
what does the hon. member propose to take away?
The Crown has the power of vetoing our bills, and
showed its power last year when it vetoed our
Divorce Bill. We are gradually cutting that “crim-
son thread of kinship”—the words have become his-
torical —we are gradually whittling away the powers
of the Crown and creating for the future of Austra-
lia what the hon. member, Mr. Playford, is, perhaps,
anxious to create, namely, the republic of the united
states of Australia. That is, I have no doubt, what
we are coming to. Without poaching from the un-
protected preserves of my hon. friend, Captain
Bussell, who rather usurped the position which
hitherto I have held in this chamber, of being the
only legitimate quoter of the sacred book, I think
really that, after all, “ Out of the fullness of the
heart the mouth speaketh.” Out of the fullness of
the heart of republicanism came the proposal to sub-
vert the authority and dignity of the Crown, to cut
the last link of connection with the Crown, and to
establish the republic of Australia. That is what
we are coming to, and it is the inevitable destiny of
the people of this great country. When England
sent her pioneers to subdue the wilds of Australia,
to civilise them and to make “the desert rejoice and
blossom as the rose” —when she planted her colonies
in this country she planted them with that germ and
spirit of independence which must, as time rolls on,
develop into the establishment of a great republic. The
cubs of the lion will, in due time, play the lion’s part;
and I was intensely amused to find that that young
cub, South Australia, represented by my hon. friend,
Mr. Playford, has solved the whole question of convert-
ing the authority of the Crown into a myth. What
we are doing to-day is preparing step by step for that
grand future which is to come ; and when that day
arrives, it will be not to the discredit nor to the injury
of England, but for England’s greater strength and
security, when she, in the southern seas —separated
as we are by such a vast expanse, —shall have created,
as foreshadowed by the hon. member, Mr. Playford,
not a dependency, but a nation of her own people,
free and independent of the Crown. That is the
boldest way in which to put the question. It was
barely touched on before, but it was the honest con-
viction of the hon. member, Mr. Playford, and the
hon. member, Sir George Grey, who pointed out that
the people of this country would no longer, especially
as time rolls on and develops still further the pluck
and independence of the people, remain as they are ;
but that in the future this country must become a
nation of itself, in alliance with the old country.
Will any of us here say that it was to the loss of
England that America separated from the control
of the parent state, or that that event was not in the
interest of humanity, was not for the benefit of the
human race ? And will anybody tell me that it will
be against the interest of humanity, of the British
race, or of England herself, that in due time these
colonies shall become one great, united Australia, as
friends and allies of the motherland ? That is our
future, and what we are doing here step by step
to-day is laying the foundation of the inevitable
which is to come. We talk about making a Consti-
tution which is to last fifty or a hundred years. Where
shall we be in fifty or a hundred years ? Ido not
suppose that I shall see my hon. friend, Sir John
Bray, fifty years hence, sitting in that corner; he
might be elevated to the president’s chair ; or be
president of the republic itself. But we are laying
the foundation, and step by step are following in the
lines of a great nation, and in due time we shall
become what America has become, a separate, free,
and independent state. That is what we are gradually


doing. We may be to a certain extent working in
fog and darkness; but that will be the outcome of
the whole question—of all our arguments, of all our
debates, of all the thinking of the people of this
country. I am as much in touch with the native-
born population of Australia as is any man in the
country; and I feel that I express their sentiments
when I say that from the germ of liberty implanted
within us by our forefathers spring the aspirations
which will forbid us to remain bound in alliance
except as one friendly nation with another, always
with that special respect that should be paid to the
people of the fatherland. I am afraid that I have
wearied hon. members as far as I have gone; but it
appears to me that before going again over a little
bit of the ground, I have said sufficient to show that
I shall oppose the military spirit, both inside this
Convention and outside the walls of this chamber.
Whenever I have the opportunity I will do my
utmost to cut down the military spirit and to instil
into the people of this land a love of their homes,
and also the necessity of defending them in the only
legitimate manner. As the hon. member, Sir George
Grey, said, either yesterday or in his speech the other
day at the Town Hall, we should educate our people
up to all of this, and especially in New South Wales,
where we are giving the people of the country prac-
tically a free education —and it should be common
to all Australia —we should instil into the minds of
our children the necessity for training, and, as a
quid pro quo for that free education, we should
demand from them a certain amount of proficiency
in the use of arms, which of itself would lay the
basis of a military organisation for the purposes
of defence only. When we have done that we should
still come nearer to that great future foreshadowed
by Wentworth when he spoke, not of these colonies
being dependencies of any fatherland or motherland —
dependencies of any state whatever —but when he
used words almost equal in eloquence to the peroration
of my hon. friend, Mr. EitzGerald, last night. When
he spoke of " Australasia, with flag unfurled—a new
Britannia in another world," the idea was uppermost
in his mind, as a native-born Australian —as it is in
the mind of nearly every native-born Australian now,
and also in that of those who have cast in their lot
among us —that the future of Australia must be "a
new Britannia" with her own flag. We have had to
repletion the building of castles in the air—treated to
the prospect of royal courts, presided over, probably, by
royal princes, where our wealthy citizens shall flock
around, and enjoy all the pleasures which surround
a royal court; but, after all, when we come to the
bed rock, we find that the national spirit of the rising
generation of Australia is instinct with freedom which
will impel our people at the earliest possible moment
to form a nation of their own. That is the aspiration,
instinct, and spirit, I hope, of young Australia, and we
are here helping that spirit, according to the speeches
of my hon. friend, Mr. Playford, and others, by
building a constitution like that of the United States,
which is to last 100 years. It appears to me that, to
use a nautical expression, these resolutions are wrong
side up. We ought to have begun building our ship
by laying the keel. I think we have been putting
aloft the top-gallant and royal yards without having
regard to the structure upon which everything is to
depend. We ought to have started by affirming, first
of all, what we propose in the shape of a federal
parliament —by pointing out that we would have two
houses of legislature. In due time we should have
settled among ourselves what powers the senate
should have—it is pretty well agreed what the house
of representatives should be. We should then have
defined clearly and distinctly what the federal rights
should be—but we are not doing that —we should
state clearly and aboveboard what the state rights
should be, and, having done that, we should define —
and the people of this country will not be satisfied
until we do define —tlie basis of our fispal policy, as
being one of tbe conditions wbicb should follow at
the earliest possible moment in the programme. And
then, as far as New South Wales is concerned, we
must pay some little consideration as to which city is
to be the capital of the future empire. Where is
that capital to be ? Is it to be in Hobart ? Tasmania
is out of the field. Is it to be in Western Australia P
An Hon. Member : Yes!
Mr. DIBBS : We have lent’a hand in endeavouring
to obtain for Western Australia free and independent
government; but no city in that colony is hardly fit
to be the capital of Australia* Will the capital be
in South Australia ? Of course, if I put the question
to Victorians they will say that the capital should be
in Victoria.
An Hon. Member : No!
Mr. DIBBS: Then they are casting it at once upon
New South Wales. I am sure Queensland has no
ambition for it. But just one word, in all serious-
ness, with regard to the question of the capital. This
question will.have to be dealt with by this Conven-
tion.
Hon. Members : No !
Mr. DIBBS: Gentlemen, when they say “no,”
are speaking with a tender sympathy for their own
colony.
Colonel Smith : Was the bon. gentleman ever in
Ballarat ? That is the place for the capital!
Mr. DIBBS: Yes, I have been in Ballarat, and I
do not know a better place to be the capital of
Victoria ; but we cannot make it the capital of Aus-
tralia. It is a fit place to be the capital of Victoria,
but not for the whole of the colonies. lam speaking
in all seriousness. lam speaking now for New South
Wales. I have veered round from the position from
which I started. I stand here as a representative of
New South Wales, and the people of New South
Wales will not lend themselves to any scheme of
federation, when the question is submitted to them,
unless first of all the fiscal question be settled —not
the details of the tariff, but the principle —for it must
be clearly defined what the fiscal policy of the great
country shall be. But there is the other question
upon which the people of New South Wales will
require to know the opinion of hon. members, namely,
as to where the capital of this new federation is to
be; and it may be worth while to point out that
there is one spot alone —favoured by nature, favoured
by the great Creator himself—where that capital
should be, where, if we are to be a naval power, the
centre of the naval operations should be, where
nature has planted boundless fields of coal for naval
purposes as well as for Australian manufactures,
where we, the parent state, have boundless resources,
and where all the advantages of beauty point to one
place on the face of Australia, and in favour of which
hon. members of this Convention will have to make
up their minds before our proceedings close.
Hon. Members : No !
Mr. DIBBS : Oh, yes. There was a certain man
went on a journey between Jericho and Jerusalem.
Well, the people of New South Wales do not propose
to take that journey, but to have the road marked
out with suitable lights.
Mr. Playtord : There is a very good road between
Jerusalem and Jericho !
Mr. DIBBS: Yes; but the hon. member knows
what became of the unfortunate man who took it.
That is one of the questions which it is no use our
shirking. Now, I speak on behalf of New South
Wales, because I am sworn to no master but New
South Wales ; I know no other master but the people
of New South Wales. When the day comes it will
not be an open question more than the fiscal question ;
but will have to be settled, not so much in the
interests of New South Wales as in the interests of
the whole of Australia. If we are to go into a


federation, we must know on what lines we are to go.
We must know where the capital city is to be
situated.
Sir John Downer : No !
Mr. Playford : Let the people who are elected
decide that.
Mr. DIBBS: There is a difference of opinion.
Remember that, after all, we are only here acting
without the authority of our masters. Our masters
are behind the scenes in all this business. However
much we may thrash out this big question, our
masters, and our masters alone, will be the people
who will settle that question.
Mr. Playford : They will settle it when the first
federal council is elected !
Mr. DIBBS ; Oh, yes! This is the bomb-shell
which I kept in reserve. Are hon. members prepared
to take that question, and add it to the resolutions
upon which we are to build up our constitution ?
Mr. Munro : We are not authorised !
Mr. Dibbs : I know that. But New South Wales
wants to know something about that question. We
want unity. We want the river Murray question
settled. I would ask my hon. friend, Mr. Gillies,
whether he is authorised to settle the river Murray
question ?
Mr. Adye Douglas : No.
Mr. DIBBS: But the hon. member would be very
glad, no doubt, to take it as an act of compromise.
However, whether we are or are not authorised to
settle that question, we have to face our masters upon
the whole questions involved in these resolutions and
other resolutions that must be submitted, and, take
my word for it, speaking on behalf of the people of
New South Wales, the question of the capital is one
which will weigh enormously with them in giving
their adhesion to any system of federation.
Mr. Playford : And with the other colonies as
well!
Mr. DIBBS: And with the other colonies, I have
no doubt. But we are differently situated. History
gives us no guide in the selection of a federal capital.
In the case of the United States of America it was
the result of a compromise. In no other part of the
world can I read in history of any place where the
question of the federal capital was settled on the
lines which the I, nited States adopted. I am very
much mistaken if the people of New South Wales,
which, by reason of its wealth, its position, its
resources, its population, will not claim to have as
powerful a voice in that matter as many of the other
parts of Australia put together. However, these are
questions to be settled, and I have no doubt that the
generous spirit of compromise which has so far
distinguished the debates will be extended even to a
fair consideration of that question. In due time, if
no other hon. member takes the lead, I shall test the
question by proposing it as one of the cardinal points
of the new constitution. These resolutions, Mr.
President, will be submitted to a committee, and in
Committee of the Whole I reserve to myself the
right of amending them to the fullest possible extent
m the direction of the lines which I have indicated,
and shall endeavour to the fullest extent to meet the'
neighbouring colonies in that liberal spirit, that
federal spirit of compromise, which you shadowed
forth in your opening address. But I fear that if
New South Wales is to be a factor in the new con-
stitution, or in the federation, there will have to be a
generous concession made to her people, and she
must have at least an equal voice in the discussion.
I thank hon. members for bearing with me so long,
for I fear that I have wearied them; but I have
indicated in a hasty fashion my views of the labours
which I think this Convention may perform. Its
ultimate outcome should be the building up in the
future the great and glorious empire of Australia.
Sir JAMES LEE-STEERE; I cannot say, like
some hon. members, that I rise with a feeling of awe
to address this Convention, when I see around me the
faces of so many friends who in former years have
met to discuss the federal question ; but I do feel a
certain amount of diffidence, and that diffidence
would be very much increased were it not for the fact
that I have more confidence in the present federal
meeting of the representatives of Australia than I
have ever had before, from the fact that I am now
the delegate of a legislature possessing equal con-
stitutional rights with that of the other colonies of
Australia. The delegates of Western Australia are,
I think, at a slight disadvantage in discussing this
question from not having been here at the commence-
ment, and not having had the benefit of listening to
the interesting and instructive speeches delivered
before our arrival. But, although we are at a certain
disadvantage in that respect, I do not know that in
other respects we have not been gainers, because,
from a partial perusal of the reports of those
speeches, I gather that there is a consensus of
opinion drifting in a direction which I think will be
agreeable to the delegates and the people of Western
Australia. I shall not detain the Convention very
long, because I think that, the subject having being
so thoroughly thrashed out, the sooner we leave off
discussing general principles and deal with the
details of the proposals, the more speedy progress we
shall make. But I wish to lay before the delegates
the peculiar position in which Western Australia is
placed as regards this question, and unless very
exceptional treatment is accorded to us I fear that
we shall not be able to go into the federation at the
present time. We have an immense territory, equal
to about a third of Australia, but with a very small
population, and I do not think it would be agreeable
to the people of our colony to go into this federation
if they were to be represented only on the basis of
population. I have seen a draft bill in which it is
proposed to give Western Australia two members.
Now, do hon. members think that we shall consent
to go into any federation if we are to be so miserably
represented as to have only two members in the
house of representatives? It would be futile, I
think, to attempt to persuade the people of Western
Australia to accept federation on those terms.
Sir Samuel Griffith : We propose an equal
number in the senate!
Sir JAMES LEE-STEERE: Certainly, and that
seems rather inconsistent, because it is wholly op-
posed to any constitution in existence at present that
a district’s or state’s representation in the senate
should be in excess of its representation in the house
of representatives.
Mr. Clark : It is so in America. It is the case
with several states in America !
Sir JAMES LEE-STEERE: But they represent a
territory, and not a state.
Sir Samuel Griffith: Rhode Island has only
one !
Mr. Clark : Oregon has only one!
Sir JAMES LEE-STEERE: I was not aware that
it existed with regard to any state in the United
States, With regard to the Ist resolution, I think I
may say that I agree with that resolution for this
reason: that there is such a decided opinion amongst
the various delegates to preserve, as far as possible,
all the rights which state legislatures possess at
present, that I am quite certain they will not sur-
render any more than they can possibly help. And
if it were not for that feeling, the resolution itself is
drawn up in such elastic terms, and properly so, I
think, that I should feel some hesitation in giving
my concurrence to it. But knowing what I do of
the feeling of provincial legislatures in this respect —
knowing that they will not give up one iota more
than they can help—l can unreservedly accept the
resolution. The 2nd and 3rd resolutions I shall deal
with together, because, to my mind, they cannot very
well be separated in discussing the fiscal policy as


regards Western Australia. We are more excep-
tionally situated with regard to our customs revenue
than is any other colony in Australia, for this reason:
that one-half of our revenue is derived from customs
duties. The customs revenue of Western Australia
is equal to £5 per head of its population, which is
more than double the amount per head collected in
any other colony except Queensland. That being
the case, where are we to find revenue to carry on
the government of our colony, and to carry on the
public works which we are now about to initiate for
developing our resources, if we are expected to give
up one-half of our revenue ? We have just entered
upon what we may call our national life, that is, upon
a system of self-government, and the Government
has initiated a scheme of public works, and is about
to raise a loan to construct those works. The
Government has received a very large amount of
support for the programme which it placed before
parliament, and its policy has been indorsed by par-
liament, because ministers told the people and told
the parliament that the works will ail be carried out
without any resort to extra taxation, as the prosecu-
tion of the works will cause such an influx of
population as to increase the customs revenue to
such an extent that there will be no need to im-
pose any direct taxation on the people. What
will the people of Western Australia say to us
if we go back and tell them that we agreed in the
Federal Convention to give up the whole of our cus-
toms revenue for the purposes of the federal govern-
ment, that we shall not now have customs revenue to
pay the interest on the money we are about to raise
for the carrying out of a scheme of public works, and
that therefore we shall have immediately to impose
direct taxation ? I ask hon. members whether, if
that is the case, there would be the slightest proba-
bility of the people or the government of Western
Australia agreeing to federate on such terms as
these ? I apprehend that all the delegates are keep-
ing before their minds this fact: that whatever reso-
lutions may be arrived at here, whatever constitution
act may be drawn up here, they will have on their
return to their several colonies to submit those reso-
lutions and that bill —I do not know exactly to what
body it is proposed to refer them, but I fancy it will
have to be referred to the people by all the legisla-
tures, because I do not think a single legislature has
been elected since the question of adopting a federal
constitution was raised here, excepting, of course, in
Western Australia.
Sir Samuel Griffith : In New Zealand,
Sir JAMES LEE-STEERE: I am told that a
parliament has been elected in New Zealand since it
was determined to have a federal convention here ;
but I am not aware what was the result of the ques-
tion when it wus brought before the people of New
Zealand.
Sir Samuel Griffith : It was never discussed !
Sir JAMES LEE-STEERE : I was going on to
say that it w r as exactly the same in Western Austra-
lia, for 1 do not think a single candidate for the
suffrages of the people referred to the federal con-
stitution about to sit, or the federal constitution
about to bo brought before that Convention.
Dr. Cockburn : It ought to be the sole issue sub-
mitted to the people !
Sir JAMES LEE-STEERE : I think it should be
made the sole issue at a general election. Ido not
think it is sufficient to refer the question to the
legislatures. I do not think a government would
care to have a dissolution to refer the question to
the people. I have not quite made up my mind yet
in wdiat way it should be done; but I think the
various colonies should devise some means by which
the people may decide whether they will accept the
federal constitution which I hope will be drawn up
before we separate. With regard to intercolonial
trade, we in Western Australia arc in this position—
that one-half of our imports come from the other
colonies, and one-third of our customs duties are
levied upon articles coming from the other colonies,
not necessarily the productions of those colonies, but
goods imported into those colonies and re-exported
into Western Australia. It might be said that if we
were to surrender our customs duties to the federal
government it would not signify very much to us
what the amount of those intercolonial duties was ;
but it would make a great difference to us in this
way —that we should receive so much less from the
federal government, assuming that they would return
to us the amount of customs duties not required for
the purposes of federal government. I have not yet
been able to gather whether it is intended that the
federal government should take over the debts of the
various colonies. That question was foremost in the
minds of all of us at the conference which was held
in Melbourne last year.
Mr. Dibbs : At a valuation.
Sir JAMES LEE-STEERE: It was impressed
upon our minds at the Melbourne conference last year
that if the debts of the various colonies were taken
over by the federal government several of the colonies
would be placed at a great disadvantage. But I have
been given to understand that it is not now intended
that the federal government should take over the
debts of the colonies. I have, however, been told by
some hon. members that they intend to propose that
that shall be done. It seems to me, therefore, that
we are, to a certain extent, groping in the dark at the
present time, and that we scarcely know what we are
really proposing to do under these resolutions.
Sir John Downer : Until we get into Committee !
Sir JAMES LEE-STEERE: I think the sooner we
abandon this discussion of principle, and approach
the details of the measure upon which we hope to
come to an agreement, the more speedily shall we
end our labours. I think, however, that I have
shown hon. gentlemen the difficulties under which we
in Western Australia labour in agreeing to give up
the whole of our customs duties to the federal govern-
ment unless some arrangement be made under which
we shall be recouped. I am aware that in the case
of some of the North American colonies which did
not join the Canadian federation in the first instance
—I refer to British Columbia and Prince Edward
Island—an arrangement was made with those two
colonies that they should receive an annual subsidy
from the Canadian Government by way of consider-
ation for the surrender of their customs duties.
There is a further condition which I should like to
see made in the ease of Western Australia, and it is
this : that the federal government should agree to
carry out a railway to that colony. We should be
quite prepared to give the necessary land, as was done
by British Columbia. In many respects there is, I
think, a great analogy between the circumstances
and position of British Columbia at the time of the
Canadian federation, and those of Western Australia
at the present time. British Columbia occupied an
extreme position on the western coast of the Cana-
dian dominion, and there was no communication by
railway between that colony and the dominion. In
many other respects there is an analogy between the
positions of British Columbia, in respect to the
dominion, and that of Western Australia in respect
to the other Australian colonies at the present time.
It may be asked that if I and my brother delegates
—some of whom, I presume, will follow r me —have
come here only to point out all these difficulties, why
have we come at all ? I have often thought of the
expression used by, I think, Captain Russell, at the
Melbourne conference, that there were 1,250 reasons
why New Zealand should not join in a federation of
the Australian colonies.
Mr. Dibbs : A reason for every mile.
Sir JAMES LEE-STEERE: Precisely; and it
has often struck me that we of Western Australia


might use the same argument, seeing that the dis-
tance between our capital and the nearest capital of
the other Australian colonies is exactly the same
number of miles, namely, 1,250. We also might say
that there were 1,250 difficulties in the way of our
joining an Australian federation ; but we have come
here not only to solve those difficulties, but to join
with the eminent men I see around me, and to see if
we cannot overcome them. It is, lam sure, the
anxious wish of all of us that we should join most
heartily in a federation of these colonies. But it
must be recollected that all of the other Australian
colonies have had a long time within which to develop
their resources, whereas we in Western Australia
have had no time whatever. We are, in fact, but
just commencing to do so. Therefore we require in
proportion a larger amount of revenue for that pur-
pose than is required in the other Australian colonies.
Unlike the hon. member w r ho last addressed us, I feel
no difficulty in giving my concurrence to resolution
No. 4. Ido not think it will be apparent to many
hon. members that resolution No. 4 points in any
degree whatever to a standing army. It does not do
so in my view; and lam sure it was not intended to
do so. The intention, I take it, is this : that we
should maintain a permanent force or a militia,
which would be available in time of danger, and
with which we might be in a position to assist the
mother country in her defence of this portion of her
dominions. I myself, and most hon. gentlemen here,
would feel humiliated if, on war breaking out between
the mother country and some other power, we had
to call upon her to send a force here to defend our
hearths and homes. It is our desire that we should
not be made to feel that humiliation, and that we
may be prepared, as we ought, to assist the mother
country, rather than ask her aid, should war at any
time break out. It is with that view that it is
proposed:
That the military and naval defence of Australia shall be
intrusted to federal forces, under one command.
I believe, as has been stated by some other members,
that Major-General Edwards’ report was the origin
of the conference held in Melbourne to consider the
advisableness of framing a Eederal Constitution for
the whole of Australia. Sub-section iof the resolu-
tions, if I may so term it, provides for:
A parliament, to consist of a senate and a house of repre-
sentatives. .
I entirely agree with those hon. members who wish
to give the proposed powers to the senate. There is
no legislative body in the world so generally admired
as is the Senate of the United States. It is a body
which is respected not only in the United States, but
throughout the world. It has been said by one of
the morning papers published in Sydney, from which
the hon. gentleman opposite—Mr. Dibbs—quoted,
that we had no right whatever to give so much power
to the upper house, and that in so doing we should
be taking from the lower house a great deal of power.
There is no country in the world more democratic
than is America, and so far as my reading goes I
have never seen any complaint that the Senate of
America takes too much power from the House of
Representatives. Bryce, in his history, says that
there has never been any serious deadlock between
the two houses. There are often conflicts between
them, but they are invariably settled by a compromise.
There never has been, according to Bryce, any serious
conflict between the Senate and the House of Repre-
sentatives in the United States. How are the rights
of the smaller colonies to be safely guarded unless
the senate we are about to establish is to have rights
co-ordinate with those of the lower house ? Ido
not see how the smaller states can consent to enter
into a federation of the Australian colonies without
conserving their state rights. I think the senate,
therefore, must be endowed with all the rights of the
lower house, except the right of originating money
bills and taxation. With regard to the proposal to
do away with appeals to the Privy Council, I may
say that it does not commend itself to my mind. It
would be cutting another strand of the painter that
binds us to the mother country. We have now few
ties uniting us to the Crown, and this particular tie
is, I think, one which ought not to be taken away
from the people of Australia. I noticed with some
little surprise that all the legal members of the Con-
vention have approved of the taking away of this
right, and I have heard it said that they are the only
gentlemen who have a right to express an opinion
upon this point.
Sir John Downer : No !
Sir JAMES LEE-STEERE: I do not agree with
that view. I think the point is one upon which the
laymen of Australia ought to be consulted. Some
hon. gentlemen have asked what powers the Crown
has in the colonies now. I think we must all confess
that the Crown has a great deal of power in these
colonies, when we consider that we could not federate
at all except by the permission of the Crown, and of
the Imperial Parliament. We shall have to go to the
Imperial Parliament to get our federal constitution
act passed. Of what use then, is it to say that there
is no power in the Crown P There is a great deal of
power in the Crown, and I hope that it will continue
to exist, and that the right of ultimate appeal to the
Privy Council of England will not be taken away
from us. I have this consolation —I believe that if
the Convention agreed to the taking away of this
power the dominion parliament would not agree to
it. I partly agree with the last speaker that we shall
have in some way to settle where the capital of the
future federation is to be, and where the first federal
parliament is to be called together. I think we
might leave it to the federal parliament to determine,
as was done in the case of British North America,
where the seat of government should be. In the
case of Canada the parliament decided that Ottawa
should be the capital unless parliament should other-
wise decide.
Sir John Downer: No; unless the Queen should
otherwise decide!
Sir JAMES LEE-STEERE: At all events, wo
shall have to make provision at the present time for
the place where the federal parliament shall be first
called together.
Mr. Plavforh ; Leave it to the Queen!
Sir JAMES LEE-STEERE: Who is to decide
the question unless we do so ? The Queen would
not take it upon herself to say where the first parlia-
ment should meet. I feel pretty confident that she
would not do so ; the responsibility is too great to
permit of the Queen, even with the advice of her
ministers, deciding the question. I myself have a
strong suspicion that the place where the first federal
parliament meets will ultimately be the capital of
federated Australia.
Sir John Downer : Not necessarily!
Sir JAMES LEE-STEERE: Not necessarily, but
there is a strong presumption in favour of the sup-
position. I can only express my hope that if Sydney
is to be fixed upon as the capital of federated Australia,
the sessions of the federal parliament will invariably
be held in the winter instead of in the summer, I am
quite certain that the parliament would not get
through its business so well or so satisfactorily if it
were to meet at the time of year at which we are now
assembled. I will only say, in conclusion, that I
hope we shall, before we separate, draft a Constitu-
tion Bill that will be, in the terms of the resolution
passed at the Melbourne conference, just to all the
colonies.
Dr. COCKBURN : I think we are all agreed upon
one thing, and that is that the field of discussion is a
vast one, and that every inch of its ground is debat-
able. So far, hon. members who have spoken have,


as the hon. member, Mr. Dibbs, put it, been treading
somewhat gingerly upon the fringe; but I do not
think we can justly say that the hon. Member him-
self, or Sir James Lee-Steere, has abstained from
going right into the heart of the territory. The hon.
member, Mr. Dibbs, certainly let some bomb-shells
fall into this Convention, and I feel that it is rather
to the disadvantage of those who follow him
that they have to address a somewhat mutilated
assembly. He fired three shells of the first
magnitude in his speech. The first Avas the shell
of the fiscal question ; the second, the shell of
possible separation ; and the third, the greatest shell
of all, the question of the site of the capital of united
Australia. It has been said that the first and third of
these questions should not be dealt with by the Con-
vention ; that they should be put aside altogether for
the federal parliament to decide. There is a great
deal to be said from that point of view ; but seeing
that the federal parliament will have all its work cut
out for it —a new body under new circumstances
having to recommend its government to the whole
of Australia —I think, as far as possible, we should
make its path clear before it, and we should be pre-
pared to take upon our shoulders some of its burdens,
unless our motto is to be: " Once we are married the
troubles begin." As to the question whether or not
this movement is going to lead to ultimate separation,
I do not think we should occupy ourselves with that.
We should trust to the great forces of evolution Avhich
have so far guided us. In spite of this question having
been raised before, the authorities of the mother coun-
try have shown themselves anxious to assist any steps
toAvards Australian unity, no matter what the result
may be. That is a circumstance which we may Avell
remember. Even supposing that ultimately it may be
found that the child can walk without the aid of the
sheltering hand of the parent, that will in no way
loosen our ties of loyalty and affection. With regard
to the capital question of the capital site, I do not
think it is so much a question as to where the capital
is to be as to where the capital is not to be. It is
agreed on all sides by the authorities who have written
on federation—and this, after all, is a matter in Avhich
Ave must trust to authorities to a great extent, because
we have no experience of our own —that it is exceed-
ingly dangerous to have the capital of federated states
in any city Avhich is unduly powerful. lam inclined
to think at present that the great capitals of the most
populous colonies of Australia are rather out of the
running on that account. There is another question
to be considered. It has been found in the experience
of America that it is absolutely necessary for the
federal authority to have absolute control of the terri-
tory in which the capital is situated, otherwise the
federal government may be turned out of doors by a
tvave of popular feeling.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : It is not necessarily so. It
is not by any means a universal conclusion!
Dr. COCKBURN: There is no instance to the con-
trary. No great city Avas chosen in the United States,
or in Canada, and for the reason that I have stated.
I would suggest to the hon. member, Mr. Dibbs, Sydney
might very well be the site of the capital, if he is Avil-
lihg to give to the federal authority a radius of 10
miles from the head of Circular Quay.
Mr. DIBBS : We will give you the Parramatta River!
Dr. COCKBURN: Hoivever, I do think that, as
far as possible, we ought to settle these matters, which
Avill not only be bombs in this Convention, but also
Avill be matters which may seriously disturb the
authority and influence of the federal parliament,
which will require to have the goodwill, or at the least
the good wishes, of all at the commencement of its
career. Ido not Avish to occupy the time of the
Convention at length in dealing with general princi-
ples ; but still, to a certain extent, Ave must deal with
general principles before we go into Committee. Those
Avho are speaking at a somewhat late stage of this
debate Lave this advantage at least: that the points
which they had in their minds at the beginning have
been gradually lopped off, and there is not much left
for them to talk about. There are, however, one or
two points which I feel it is necessary to raise on the
general issue. It has been well said by the hon.
members, Mr. Thynne, Colonel Smith, and others, that
we are not here to advocate the question of federation,
that being looked upon already as a settled subject.
We are sent here simply to draft a constitution; and
the desirableness of federation is our major premise.
That would be quite right if it only meant the dis-
cussion of federation as against continued separation;
but another point has been brought in: that is, the
question of unification has been raised in more than
one quarter. So that, although it is,not necessary to
argue in favour of federation as against continued
separation, it will be necessary to argue for federation
as against unification; because, between the two
levels of separation and unification, there lies federa-
tion as an intermediate stage, which can be reached
either by ascending from separation, as was the case
in the American colonies, or by descending from uni-
fication as was the case in the Canadas; while in
Switzerland we have had examples of both. In
Switzerland there was a descent from unification,
from the republic one and indivisible, forced upon it
by Napoleon, down to a loose confederation, and then
an ascent again to a complete federation, at which
point equilibrium has at present been obtained. So
we have at least to combat the arguments for unifi-
cation. Although we have heard several able advo-
cates and veteran statesmen urging unification, I do
not think that that point of view will recommend
itself at present to the delegates representing the
various Australian colonies. Federation is an inter-
mediate stage between the two extremes, and like all
compromises, it possesses some of the advantages, and
many of the drawbacks of both originals. It is a
compromise which is inconsistent with many of those
things which we have hitherto regarded as advantages
under which our privileges have sprung up. The
hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, very properly
spoke in favour of that elasticity of constitution
which we may not notice changing from day to day ;
but when we look back, after ten or eleven years, it
is easy to see that we have, to a large extent, changed
that constitution. Now, it is impossible, unfortu-
nately, that this elasticity, which has so much to re-
commend it, and whose advantages were pointed out
by Sir Samuel Griffith, can be retained to the fullest
extent when he makes this compromise of federation.
Sir Samuel Geifeith: We can have elasticity in
its working, although there may be rigidity in the
powers!
Dr. COCKBUEN: No ; the essence of federation
is rigidity.
Sir Samuel Geifeith : Only in certain respects.
Dr. COCKBIJEN : There is rigidity as far as the
constitution is concerned.
Sir Samuel Geiefith: No; only so far as the
powers are concerned ?
Dr. COCKBUEN: It is a question of a written
and rigid constitution as against an unwritten and
elastic constitution.
Sir Samuel Geiffith : No !
Dr. COCKBUEN: All our experience has been
under an elastic constitution. Usage, no doubt, will,
to a great extent, modify even a written and rigid
constitution; but I think the hon. member, Sir
Samuel Griffith, will agree with me that a written
constitution is absolutely incompatible with that
gradual change which takes place from day to day
Sir Samuel Geiffith ;No ; look at erica!
Dr. COCKBUEN: America is the very case I have
in view. America has had a rigid constitution which
has practically remained unaltered for the last 100
years.


Mr. Moore : There have been thirty-seven amend-
ments.
Dr. COCKBUEN: There have been only four
amendments in this century. The hon. member, Mr.
Inglis Clark, is a good authority on America, and I
am sure he will agree with me that out of sixteen
amendments only four have been agreed to in this
century. All the other amendments which have been
made were really amendments which were indicated
almost at the very framing of the constitution,
and they may be said to be amendments ■which were
embodied in the constitution at the first start. The
very element, the very essence, of federation is
rigidity, and it is no use expecting that under a rigid
and written constitution we can still preserve those
advantages which we have reaped under an elastic
constitution. All our experience hitherto has been
under the condition of parliamentary sovereignty.
Parliament has been the supreme body. But when
we embark on federation we throw parliamentary
sovereignty overboard. Parliament is no longer
supreme. Our parliaments at present are not only
legislative, but constituent bodies. They have not
only the power of legislation, but the power of
amending their constitutions. That must disappear
at once on the abolition of parliamentary sovereignty.
No parliament under a federation can be a con-
stituent body; it will cease to have the power of
changing its constitution at its own will. Again,
instead of parliament being supreme, the parliaments
of a federation are co-ordinate bodies—the main
power is split up, instead of being vested in one body.
More than all that, there is this difference: When
parliamentary sovereignty is dispensed with, instead
of there being a high court of parliament, you bring
into existence a powerful judiciary which towers
above all powers, legislative and executive, and which
is the sole arbiter and interpreter of the constitution.
Therefore it is useless for us to hope that we can, at
the same time, have the advantages of a federation
and retain the advantages of that elasticity
which has hitherto given birth to our greatest
privileges. Even responsible government, which we
have all learned to revere so much, has simply been
a growth under the shelter of parliamentary
sovereignty. We do not know that the parliamentary
responsibility of ministers can exist under any other
conditions. We have not seen it exist in the United
States or in Switzerland, and we have no reason to
suppose that it will be compatible with the conditions
of federation here. I am inclined to thipk that it will
not. I am inclined to think that our best course
will be to follow, in this respect, the guidance of
Switzerland, and have our ministers elected indi-
vidually by the parliaments. I am all the more
willing to recognise this because, quite apart from
federation, this is an alteration in our constitution
which for many years I have been in the habit of
advocating even with our present local parliaments.
This rigidity of constitution leads to some very
strange results. When a constitution becomes
immutable, not theoretically immutable, but practi-
cally immutable, as it must be in a federation, it is
apt to become, as has been very well laid down by
Dicey in his admirable work on federal government,
the object of a somewhat superstitious reverence on
the part of the people, which leads them to regard
the constitution not only as something altogether
apart from its true object, but something sacred in
itself. From what the hon. member, Mr. Deakin,
said, I rather gathered that he regarded that as an
advantage. He spoke of a government “ strong as a
fortress, and sacred as a shrine.” I am not altogether
able to agree with the hon. member there. I think
that parliaments are rather utilitarian devices. As
has been well put by an authority on constitutional
law, constitutions are devices founded on expediency,
and possess no intrinsic right of existence. So that,
whatever the form of government may be—whether
it is that of a separate state, or the intermediate
stage of a federation, or whether it is on
the highest level of all, that of unification —
still I think we shall best serve the real object
of government if we regard all these, not as ends
in themselves, and therefore not entitled to super-
stitious reverence, but simply as means with one object
in view—that is, good government, strictly utilitarian
institutions, to which no sort of superstitious rever-
ence ought to attach itself. Otherwise we find that
a rigid constitution becomes one of the strongest
engines of conservatism. I quite agree with the hon.
member, Sir Samuel Griffith, that elasticity is an
advantage; and although we are about to depart
from our unwritten and elastic constitution and
embark 011 a written and rigid constitution, I think
we should, as far as possible, give every play to that
elasticity consistent with federation, for hitherto it
has been attended by the very best results. I have
mentioned the fact, which we must all recognise,
that federation is essentially a compromise, and. that
one of our most difficult problems will be to reconcile
that elasticity which is so necessary for the develop-
ment of a constitution, with that rigidity which is
recognised as being one of the characteristics of
federation. Not only in that respect must federation
be recognised as a compromise; but it is also
essentially a compromise between the rights of the
state as such, and the rights of the central govern-
ment. In your opening address, sir, you appealed
to the members of this Convention to forget as far as
possible their local inclinations and to lose sight of
the lines which divide them. While agreeing with
you, that to a great extent this must be done, still, as
federation is a compromise and essentially a
bargain, if we lose sight of those inclinations which
are one of the elements in the bargain, I am
afraid we shall make rather a one-sided con-
tract. It is not because we are dissatisfied with our
past history, as I take it, that we are seeking federa-
tion. On the contrary, we have much to be proud of,
and it is because we are so proud of our progress,
and love so much those colonies with, which our pro-
gress has been associated, that we look to federation
not to destroy, but to protect and shield, those
institutions under which we have so far obtained our
rights and privileges ; and we look upon federation as
a cover, a powerful cover, under which we can
advance to a still greater development of our freedom.
And, sir, we could see at once that when the first
crossing of swords took place between the two parties
to the bargain—between the states-rights element
and the element that makes for unification —we could
see on which side the strength of the argument lay ;
and it will be here as it has been elsewhere. In America,
the states-rights party won from the first all along
the line ; and even now, although in America several
great factors have been making for unity, the states-
rights party is predominant. There are two causes
in America which have had a great effect in cultivat-
ing among the Americans an attachment to their
central government. The first is the fact that there
were only thirteen of the states of America that had
originally sovereign powers ; that of the forty-two
states of which the union is now composed, the vast
majority never had any other attachment than to
the central authority. They are the children of the
union. They are, as it has been well said, born
of the compact. So that in America the vast
majority of the states have never had anything like a
divided attachment. They have, from the first, been
attached only to the source from which they sprung —
the central government. And then the war had a
great amalgamating influence in America. That
party which all through had been the states-rights
party, and had been the exponents of liberty, found
itself, by a very strange irony of fate, to bo, not the
exponents of liberty, but the upholders of slavery,
and the central authority, which, until then, had


always been recognised as the party which, by its pre-
ponderating force, rather tended to crush the liberties
which were upheld by the states-rights party —that
central party was enabled, through the condition of
the country, to take up the cause of freedom, and
this again was a great force that made in America
towards the authority of the central power. But
even now, with all the advantages which America
has enjoyed, the states-rights party is still the pre-
dominant party ; and so it will be here. But seeing
that we are about to embark upon an altogether new
experience, we must, above all things, avoid carrying
ioto our new territory any false analogies. As has
been well pointed out by many speakers, there is no
analogy whatever between the council of the states
and an upper house. But although this has been
well recognised, I cannot altogether agree with some
of the arguments which have been brought forward
in support ot the contention that the council of the
states ox* the senate should be given co-ordinate
powers. I quite agree that they should have co-
ordinate powers with the assembly which represents
population. But some of the arguments have, to
my mind, been rather of a mistaken nature. It has
been contended that the council of the states should
have co-ordinate authority with the popular assembly
in order to act as a sort of check against hasty
legislation—something to stand in the way of the
will of the people. Now, in America there is no
such thing. Federation cannot exist, co-ordinate
houses cannot exist and work together unless they
both recognise the sovereignty of the people, and
yield to the sovereignty of the people; and the at-
tempt, either here, or in any other free country
where the people have been accustomed to exercise
their liberties, to set up a council of the states—call
it by what name you like—as something which is
going to stand in the way for any length of time, or
even for a short time, of the pronounced will of the
people, I think will be found to end in a disaster.
There is no fear of bursts of popular opinion if
popular opinion is allowed to flow easily and in broad
channels, as it does in free communities. It is only
if it is improperly resisted that the force of popular
opinion becomes overwhelming and carries all before
it. And here we must recognise as, I think, the
very principle of the Constitution in America, that
both houses must be equally subject to properly-
expressed popular opinion, and that neither house,
surrounded by what bulwarks you like, will be able
to exercise a function which some look to one house
to undertake, and to stand in the way of a properly
expressed popular will. For this reason, I think
the council of the states should be elected direct
from the people, because there can be no question
but that democracy has proved that the judgment
of the whole people is better than the judgment of
any section of the people. I should like to see the
house of representatives partake also in another res-
pect of the nature of the council of the states. It
is proposed to make the council of the states per-
petual. It is proposed to have an infusion of new
blood at periodical intervals—every two or three
years. Why should not a similar principle apply to
the house of representatives ? I do not think that
in a federation you can have a dissolution of either
house, penal or otherwise. I question very much
whether it would be found possible to incorporate the
principle of dissolving either house summarily with
the principles of federation, and therefore I should
like to see the lower house also constructed on the
same basis as that on which it is proposed to construct
the council of the states. Let the lower house be re-
newed from time to time by degrees. Let there be an
infusion every year or every two years into that assem-
bly of a certain proportion of new blood. And we re-
cognise this, that the more often in a free country
the people are called upon to exercise their franchise
the more interest they will take in the ends of govern-
ment, and the better they will be able to make a wise
choice. With regard to the powers that are to be
conceded to the central authority, and the powers
that are to remain with the states, I do hope that no
attempt will be made to define the powers which are
not surrendered by the individual states ; because to
define means to limit, and if we know anything we
know that the advance in the future will be in the
direction of the state taking upon itself many functions
which are at present performed by private individuals.
There is a constant and increasing tendency on the
part of the state to take upon itself all sorts of new r
duties, and we can hardly say at present what it may
not be necessary for the state governments to take
up. Many things which are now entirely conducted
by private enterprise, I believe in accordance with
the spirit of the times, will before no long interval of
time elapses, be undertaken by state governments.
Therefore, we must not attempt to define, because in
our ignorance of what extension may take place in
this direction, by defining we shall limit. And then
with regard to uniform legislation, there has been an
opinion generally expressed that the more uniform
our laws are the better. Well, this is only true to a
certain extent. We have great problems to work
out in this new country, and it is much easier to work
out a problem on a small scale, where it is possible
to make an experiment on a small scale, than it is to
work it out on a large scale. Many have advocated
that the criminal law, for example, should be uni-
form.
Mr. Clauk ; I hope it will not!
Dr. COCKBURN: I quite agree with my hon.
friend, the evolutionist, opposite. I hope it will not;
because I recognise that our criminal law is not by
any means perfect; that we have many improvements
to make before we even get hold of the rudimentary
principles which should govern us in the treatment
of criminals.
Mr. Clark : Hear, hear!
Dr. COCKBURN : At the present our prisons are
reformatories in no sense of the word. In South
Australia—l do not know what is the case elsewhere
—we have a First Offenders Act, by which it is
optional with the judge not to impose any sentence
whatever on an offender who for the first time comes
before a court of justice. That, I think, is advisable,
and that is an advance, an experimental advance,
which can be made on a small scale by an individual
state; but it would be very difficult indeed to introduce
a principle of that sort on a large scale at first, Ido
not think that this is the place in which to define
one’s own particular views; but I look forward to
further developments in this respect. I think that
optional sentences —sentences for an indefinite term
—are decidedly desirable here. I simply mention
this to show that it is very much to the advantage of
evolution that as much ground as possible should be
left available to the states in which to make experi-
ments in legislation. In fact, we have in the states,
in our several governments, reaped many triumphs
of the working of individualism. Whatever may be
the case with regard to persons or societies, the period
of individualism with regard to states has not yet been
passed, and under the competition and emulation
which individualism in states will engender, we can
look forward to laying up many stores of experience
which eventually will be available for the whole of Aus-
tralia, and ultimately for the whole of the human race.
I will notdwellupon the question of the standing army,
because that has been already so excellently dealt
with by the hon. member, Sir George Grey, the hon.
member, Mr. Dibbs, and others. I think that those
speakers haveconvinced th is Convention that w r e do not
want to unduly foster the military spirit in these
colonies. There is, however, just one matter men-
tioned by the hon. member, Mr. Bird, to which I de-
sire to allude. The hon. member expressed some
surprise that the attitude of South Australia with


regard to the customs union appeared somewhat dif-
ferent now from what they did twelve months ago.
Mr. Bran : I expressed pleasure !
Dr. COCKBURN : I think the hon. member also
expressed surprise. I do not think there is anything
to be surprised at in this, although I am glad that it
has given pleasure to the hon. member. The fact is
that those points which the South Australian repre-
sentatives asked last year have now been willingly
conceded, it appears, by the Avhole Convention, and
we have no fear whatever that any injustice will bo
inflicted upon our industries. I think it is generally
recognised that this is the case, and it is not neces-
sary for South Australia to say anything further on
the subject, seeing that those who last year were
rather opposed to her demands —the Victorian dele-
gates —this year have viewed the matter entii’ely from
the standpoint which was then taken up b} r delegates
of the smaller colony. Now, there are many other
points to which, if I had spoken earlier in the de-
bate, I should have alluded; but I feel that these
have been so ably dealt with by men of maturer
years, and larger experience, that it would be pre-
sumption on my part to further allude to them. In
Committee there will be plenty of time for any ex-
pression of individual opinion. As far as possible I
am seeking to avoid repeating arguments, and taking
up ground so much better occupied before. However,
I must allude to one sentence in your opening
address, sir, in which you said that it was the experi-
ence of the world that confederations, as opposed to
federations, had been disastrous. Now, as far as my
reading of history has led me to form an opinion on
the subject, I have come to the conclusion that the
reason why confederation —federation on a somewhat
loose principle —has been fallacious in the past, is
because no confederation has been constructed on
such lines as to bo able to stand the test of a
prolonged war. All the federations of which we
read in history —that federation, the Achaean League,
wduch shed a lustre upon the declining days of the
glory of Greece, fell from no other reason; the
first confederation in America fell from no other
reason.
Mr. Adte Douglas : The hon. member is wrong
there !
Dr. COCKBURN : It was in consequence of the
war that it ceased to exist.
Mr. Adte Douglas : The confederation was not
formed until the war was over !
Dr. COCKBURN : Confederation was found to be
unequal to the demands of the long war with Great
Britain, and a closer union was seen to be neces-
sary.
Mr. Clauk : It was because of the demands of
trade and commerce !
Dr. COCKBURN : No, it was because of the ex-
penses incurred in the war. The continental congress
of America had made itself liable in consequence of
the war for an enormous amount of money. Its
credit was at stake, and it tried to get the money by
levies upon the states ; but it was not forthcoming. It
Avas distinctly the result of the Avar. I have always
been rather an admirer of the first step taken towards
Australian unity. From the first, I gave allegiance
to the Federal Council, which is a loose confederation,
and I must confess that as time goes on I find it
somewhat difficult to sever that allegiance. Of course
Ave all recognise that the Federal Council did not go
far enough. It is necessary to give it an executive,
and to provide for the common defence, and
to have a supreme judiciaiy ; but I cannot help
thinking that if we take the elements AA’hich form
the basis of the Federal Council fully, and if Ave add
to them these necessary things—an executiA r e, means
for defence, and a judiciary, and if avc continue to
add to them the poAvers of that council —Ave shall
solve the problem which is at present facing us and
which presents so much difficulty. We shall, by
beginning low down on the few common points of
agreement, be able to build up gradually under the
power of reference to the Federal Council which
obtained in that bill, a federation, and be able to
reconcile what the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith,
contends for—elasticity and rigidity on certain points.
I think it will be found when this Convention has
concluded its labours that if these necessaries to
which I have alluded arc adding to the powers of
the Federal Council, and if instead of one chamber,
two chambers be made out of it, but on the same
model, and the number of members be increased so
as to give it that respect which is its due among the
colonies over the destinies of which it will have, to
a certain extent, to preside, we shall have arrived
at a solid ground upon which we can commence to
build a lasting fabric, because time is a necessity in
all enduring structures. If w r e begin 011 that ground,
gradually adding to the building, I think we shall
get the union which we desire to see more quickly
than if we break altogether with the past. lam
not now pleading for the Federal Council as it stands.
It is inadequate in many respects. But if we give
it an executive, the control of defence, and provide
for a judiciary, and settle, at the same time, the fiscal
question —which can easily be settled under such a
principle as that—and if, supposing the Convention
favours the idea, we divide the chamber into two,
and have a house of representatives as well as a
council of state, but maintain that principle which
was distinctive of the Federal Council, that it should
grow in power by the gradual reference to it of
matters agreed upon by the various legislatures, I
think that will be our quickest w r ay in the long run.
AVC are all agreed on the question of union. There
is absolutely no opposition 011 that ground whatever ;
there is no obstacle whatever to the carrying out
of our views. The only resistance which we may
encounter is that which may be due to our own
momentum. The resistance increases according to
the velocity with which we travel. If we bui'd
gradually and give time for endurance, we shall find
nothing "like the difficulties which will present them-
selves if we attempt at once to launch a definite,
rigid Constitution, which we expect to last for many
years, practically without change, or with change in
only small degrees. I think that all our paths con-
verge towards union; but at present our steps lie in
diverse and varied territory. Our eyes are fixed on
the same point, but at the same time we must give
our attention to the difficulties which lie in our path,
otherwise we shall lose ourselves in the entanglemenls
and the pitfalls at our feet. I think if we can in
any way at this last moment recognise the past —
recognise the work that has been done, as was done
in America, we shall do well. The American Consti-
tution, which we all admire so much, was not obtain ed
by any sudden flight. Much as they saw that tl e
powers of the continental Congress were inadequate
for the Congress, they did not break with that Con-
gress. It had a voice in fixing the convention which
framed the Constitution. The resolutions carried at
the convention were submitted to the Congress, and
the Congress took upon itself the duty of referring
them to the states. America did not obtain that
proud position of federation by breaking in any way
with the past, and I think we should be careful in
breaking with our past. "We must recognise the work
which has been already done, and which has not been
utilised. Does it not appear that there is something
strange in our now applying for more complete
federal powers when we have not used the powtrs
which form part of our constitution? "Why should
we not work the existing machinery up to its fullest,
and when we find it inadequate get other machinery?
I did not mean to refer to this point. I meant to
keep away from any reference to the Federal
Council, and I must apologise for not having done
so.


Mr. Clauk : South Australia is not in it. The
hon. member's colony is out of it!
Dr. COCKBURN: She would not hare gone out
of it if there had been shown a general desire to
utilise those means to the fullest extent. Our
country would to-morrow, if Parliament met, gladly
enter the Federal Council, and give it the powers
and every opportunity to justify its existence. How-
ever, I have been led into stating my opinion on the
question of the Federal Council, because I felt it
necessary to show that because confederations have
not proved successful in the past that is no reason
why a modified confederation should not be successful
in the future. We are treading on altogether new
ground; we have no experience whatever to guide
us. The problems of the old country are no guide
Avhatever to the solution of those problems which
will have to be solved on the continent of Australia.
As was pointed out by you, sir, Australia stands by
itself. It is already defended, and defended in such
a AA r ay that millions and millions of pounds might be
expended without so good a result, by that mighty
moat Avhich was placed round it at the dawn of
creation, and it has, therefore, nothing to fear from
those causes which, in past history, have proved so
fatal to federation. I cannot help thinking that
after Ave have been sitting here, and Avhen we get
into Committee upon the details of the subject, Ave
shall find that if Ave settle the fiscal question, and
give those additional poAvers which I hare indicated
to the Federal Council, xve shall have solved as much
of the problem as it is possible for us to solve. And
in that Avay, I think, Ave shall be able to make a solid
step in advance. I am afraid that if we aim at too
much Ave shall get nothing. Any one can see at once
the difference betAveen the tone Avhich pervades this
Convention and the tone Avhich pervaded the con-
ference in Melbourne last year. Many subjects then
brought forward as essential to federation have noAV
been recognised as subjects with which we should
not deal. Our principal common ground is becoming
more and more limited, and we shall find, as it
becomes limited, the advantage of not ignoring the
foundation already laid, and AA r e shall discover that
by meeting round the table Ave can get over the
difficulties and misunderstandings which attached to
that earlier form of confederation. As I said at the
commencement of my address, Ave have no experience
to guide us ; therefore, in this matter Ave must fall
back, to a certain extent, upon the authority of those
Avho have studied the question. It has been said
that federation Avill only take root in the soil Avhen
the ground here has been prepared by a looser bond.
Now, sir, the ground has already been prepared by
a looser bond. We have recognised the inadequacy
of that bond. Let us recognise its present require-
ments ; let us build it up upon a sure foundation ;
and, step by step, let us attempt to avoid, as far as
possible, the rigidity which attaches itself to the
federations Avhich we have seen in other parts, and
Avhich is so fatal to evolution; and so, I think, Ave
may hope to see, AA r ithout let, without obstacle, the
gradual development and the gradual rearing of such
a structure which we shall feel proud of from the
commencement, and Avhich will prove itself to be
enduring forever. I must apologise for having
trespassed so long upon the time of hon. members,
and I thank hon. members for the manner in Avhich
they have listened to me.
Mr. BROWN: In addressing myself to the reso-
lutions before the Convention, I have present to my
mind the fact that all, or nearly all, that could be
usefully said on the general matters Avhich we are
considering, has been already said ; and it becomes
more and more evident. I think, as we proceed, that
the real w r ork of this Convention will only commence
when we go into Committee on the resolutions
Avhich you, Mr. President, have submitted for our
consideration. At the same time, I cannot help feel-
ing that those from whom I derive my authority to
sit hero as a delegate in this important assemblage
Avould not be satisfied if I, or any other delegate
whom they have sent here to represent their views,
were to be altogether silent in this preliminary dis-
cussion. Whatever diffidence I may naturally feel in
addressing this august assemblage, is certainly not
diminished by the consciousness of the ability with
which the questions before us have been discussed by
those who have preceded me. I am sure that we
have derived a great deal of interest and a great deal
of instruction from the contest of legal acumen and
debating power between the lion, members, Sir
Samuel Griffith and Mr. Deakin. We also owe very
much—and in this I am expressing the opinion of
many delegates besides myself—to the important con-
tributions to the discussion we have received from the
representative of South Australia, the hon. member,
Mr. Baker, and the representative of New South
Wales, the hon. member, Mr. Barton. Those two gen-
tlemen, placed before the Convention, in the most
clear, forcible, and logical manner, the considerations
which ought to guide us in dealing with the important
questions which are before us. At the same time,
there are some points raised in the discussion of the
resolutions which I should like to touch upon ; but
before doing so, perhaps I may be permitted—inas-
much as the interest that Tasmania has taken in the
cause of federation from the very earliest day is well
know n ; inasmuch as through her late lamented pre-
mier, the Hon. Mr. Justice Giblin, she gave no
inconsiderable aid in formulating the present Federal
Council Act —to refer briefly to the operation of that
act so far as it has gone. I am one of those who
regret to some extent, or have regretted until the
past few days, that the institution which was founded
by the Federal Council Act has not been used in the
manner indicated just now by the hon. member, Dr.
Cockburn, as the beginning of larger and more impor-
tant functions to be devolved upon a federal legis-
lature. No one at all acquainted with the facts sup-
poses, that the authors of that act ever intended that
it should be anything more than the initiatory step,
in a series of steps, which Avould ultimately lead on
to the object, which is now, in a concrete form, before
us in the resolutions which you have submitted to
us. We always recognised the fact that we w r ere
simply doing what it was possible to do at the time.
"We hoped that the Federal Council would gather
round it, as time went on, the adhesion of the whole
of the colonies; and that, when that adhesion was
secured, there would be a central body around which
the federal idea would gradually grow, and that, as
the interests of the people became more and more
evident as regards federal legislation, they would be
able to evolve from that beginning something of a
much more important and imposing character. It
has been a matter of extreme regret, as you, Mr.
President, very well know, to those who have, like
myself, interested themselves in this question, that
the important colonies of New South Wales
and, until a very recent time, South Australia,
were not able to see their w r ay to come in and help
us ; and it is, of course, a matter of equal regret that
the important colony of New Zealand has not been
able to see its way to join us, although I know,
having had the pleasure of meeting the hon. member,
Sir Harry Atkinson, in the Convention of ] 883, and
having subsequently had conversation with his
colleagues who were present with him there, that it
has not been from any w r ant of loyalty to the cause
of federation that that adhesion has not been given,
but simply because they found, as you, sir, found, in
New South Wales, and have placed the fact on
public record, that it was impossible to get the
people of their colony to interest themselves suffi-
ciently in the subject to gain their assent to joining
the Federal Council. lam quite sure of this, sir,
that if it had been possible to carry on the- Federal


Council, always supposing, of course, that we had
had the adhesion of the important colonies I have
referred to, we should, as the hon. member, Dr.
Cockburn, has said," have been much more likely to
have arrived at satisfactory and enduring results
than we can by going to work as we are now, and
attempting at one stroke of the pen, as it were, to
place before the various parliaments of the colonies,
a carefully prepared paper constitution. Far be it
from me to cast any doubts on the results of our
labours. On the contrary, I do sincerely hope that
the result of our being here will be to build up a
constitution which will fulfil the conditions required
of it; that is to say, that it will furnish appropriate
means for attaining legitimate ends. I may say that,
even supposing, as I sincerely hope will be the case,
we succeed in arriving at conclusions which will be
generally satisfactory to those of our co-delegates
whom we meet here from other colonies—in the not
altogether impossible event of that result, when it is
submitted to the various parliaments whom we
represent, being declined, or at all events not
accepted for a very considerable time, as I fear will
happen in one or more of the colonies, it certainly
must be matter for congratulation that, in the
Federal Council we shall still have a rallying point
round which the federal idea may gather and grow,
and by-and-by render much more easy the task of
those who desire to see an absolute and perfect
union of the whole of the colonies. Having said so
much, if you will permit me to do so, I should like
to congratulate you, Mr. President, and those whose
assistance you have been able to secure, on the
success which has so far attended your labours in
assembling this Convention—and I think it is only
fair and right that I should give voice to the opinion
which I know is held by many, that we are in 110
small degree indebted to the self-denying, patriotic,
and statesmanlike conduct of fhe hon. member, Mr.
Gillies, for having arrived at the point at which we
have arrived. I think, if the hon. member, Mr.
Gillies, will permit me to say so, that there is no
doubt that were it not for the means he took to
secure the adhesion of New South Wales and the
other colonies to the proposal to assemble this
Convention, we should not have been here to-day ;
and, on my own part, and on the part of those
who are interested in the federal cause, whilst
thanking you sincerely for the prominent part you
have taken, and the cordial and loyal manner in
which you have acted towards the cause of federa-
tion, I join also with those who acknowledge their
obligations to the hon. member, Mr. Gillies, for the
work he has performed in connection with the
matter, not forgetting for a moment that the present
Premier of Victoria, since he has had the oppor-
tunity, has also rendered loyal service in the same
cause. As to the resolutions which are before us,
the most important are those which refer to the
tariff question, and on that point I think the Con-
vention is as yet without the information which it will
be necessary for us to have before we proceed very
much further in the consideration of the question. We
know that the hon. member, Sir James Lee-Steere, at
the conference held in Melbourne last year, raised
the very important question as to the amount which
would be sacrificed by each of the colonies by the
abandonment of the intercolonial duties. I have
seen various calculations as to the amount that would
be so sacrificed; but I have, as yet, seen no authorita-
tive statement from any one in the position of
treasurer of a colonyas to what that amount islikely to
be. We have, of course, before us, the calculations of
statisticians and others who have interested themselves
in the matter; but I think it would be well if this
Convention were informed by some one who has had
the responsibility of administering the finances in a
colony what is really likely to occur in that respect.
With regard to the ultimate result which we all ainj
at, the free interchange of commodities from Port
Darwin on the north to Hobart on the south, and I
hope also with our friends in New Zealand, no one
will, I think, question this proposition, that no matter
what the individual losses may be —and we know some
individuals must lose by the operation of such free inter-
change—they will be absolutely lost and merged, and
must be considered of the very slightest importance
in consideration of the vast advantages which will be
given to the whole of the colonies by the increase of
trade and commerce, and the enormously enlarged
markets which will be placed at the disposal of those
colonies which now, unfortunately, by hostile tariffs,
are closed to them. It has been said that there has
been a want of impelling force to drive us to this
union; that there is no prospect of war or invasion.
I should like to ask those gentlemen who know what
has been going on within the last twenty years how
long they suppose it will be before some very serious
questions will arise between these colonies on the con-
tinent—of course, as far as Tasmania is concerned, Ave
are in the happy position of not beingin that close juxta-
position with our neighbours which sometimes leads
to unpleasant results—but I ask then how long they
think it is likely —tariffs being avoAvedly constructed
for the purpose of inflicting injury upon neighbours
—that that state of things Avill continue Avithout
some very serious results arising ? It is true that
the differences between the colonies in this matter
have hitherto been adjusted without any very serious
results; but as the military forces of each colony
increase—as they are increasing from day to day—-
with the poAver of each colony increasing, as it is
increasing from day to day, does any hon. member of
this Convention mean to tell me that there is not a
risk of some very serious conflict arising? But, quite
apart from that impelling force, we have quite enough
in the consideration of the enormous advantages that
Ave shall all enjoy from a free interchange of products
and manufactures throughout Australasia to cause us
to welcome the day Avhen that glorious state of affairs
shall be brought about. It lia3 been a surprise to
me, as no doubt it has been to other hon. members of
the Convention, to find the colony of Victoria the
first to cry out for some consideration in the arrange-
ment that may be made Avith this ultimate object iu
view. This is one of those rather comical incidents
with which AVO occasionally meet, which requires
some explanation, and, no doubt, AVC shall have some
explanation given later on. However, lam inclined
to agree Avith those who are disposed to have some
time fixed before the free interchange shall take place ;
and, if that is the only condition, I should hope that
New South AVales will not be so rigid in its adherance
to Avhat it considers its rights in the matter,
as Avas indicated by the hon. member, Mr.
Dibbs, this morning. AVe are here, sir, to per-
form that duty which you have placed before us
—to give and take— and if, in this matter above
all other things, there is not a disposition to
give aud take, we are not likely to arrive at a satis-
factory conclusion. I was very glad indeed, sir, that
in the graceful and charming speech of the hon.
member, Captain Russell, we had recalled to our
minds the fact that this is an Australasian Conven-
tion, and I shall be glad indeed —and I am sure that
I am expressing the opinion of all my fellow-colonists
—if the result of our labours shall be of such a
character as to shoAv New Zealand that if she does
join our federal union she certainly will not have any
cause to regret having done so. There is no doubt
that it is desirable that the union to be formed should
be an Australasian union, and it will, I think, be
deplorable if one important member of these Austra-
lasian communities should, for any reason, think it
necessary to stand out. AVhile, as indicated by the
hon. member, Captain Russell, New Zealand has been,
and is likely to be, so coy, I think that the coyness
of NeAV Zealand is far surpassed by the coyness of


Western Australia. We hav r e had placed before us
by the hon. member, Sir James Lee-Steere, various
conditions under which Western Australia is likely
to consent to join the union. Those Avho take that
view with regard to Western Australia I hope do not
lose sight of the fact that as regards that vast territory
this is " the day of small things," and that although
Avith her resources, her enormous extent of territory,
and her position, she would be under some disadvan-
tage noAv in joining the union—Ave are not here to
contrive legislation for the present, but to look
forward to a future day Avhen instead of 40,000
inhabitants, which I think is the number in Western
Australia now, there will be perhaps 4,000,000 or
5,000,000 Avithin not very many years. But the hon.
member, Sir James Lee-Steere, raised a question
Avhich I think demands some consideration with
regard to the representation of the smaller states in
the house of representatives. I quite concur in the
view expressed by that hon. member, namely, that
the number of representatives proposed to be accorded
to the smaller states would, if taken on the basis of
population, be altogether inadequate ; and I think it
Avill be for this Convention to consider later on
Avhether they may not fairly stipulate that as regards
the existing smaller colonies, and as regards future
smaller colonies —or states I suppose I should call
them—which certainly will be carved out of the larger
ones, there should be a minimum representation in
the house of representatives. The calculation giving
a representative to each 20,000 inhabitants would be
as the hon. member, Sir James Lee-Steere, said, two
for Western Australia, eight for Tasmania, sixteen
for South Australia, as against fifty-six each for New
South Wales and Victoria. I think it will be for us
to consider whether, as regards the smaller states now
existing or those which Avill come into existence here-
after, it AA'ould not be fair to say that there shall be a
minimum of tweh r e representatives. That, however,
is one of those matters of detail which, of course, Avill
have to be considered very carefully; but I can
understand any representative of Western Australia
taking exception to the small amount of representa-
tion Avhich that colony would secure if the number of
population alone were to be taken into consideration.
With regard to the 4th resolution, providing for one
command for the military and naval defences, I have
been very much surprised at the way in which that
resolution was slurred over. It Avas not noticed at
all by some hon. delegates ; and its full effect was not
taken into consideration, or, at all events, not given
prominence to, by those who have noticed it. I should
like to know if there is to be an organised military and
naval defence under one command in the Australian
colonies, what is to be done with regard to the large
amount of defence which we now receive from the
mother country —partially paid for only as regards
annual maintenance, and as to the other portion not
paid for at all? Is it proposed by those Avho advo-
cate this step, that the defence HOAV afforded us by
the mother country is to be continued as it is, or is
it contemplated that there shall be some sort of
treaty Avith the mother country as regards supplying
any necessary defence that may be required here-
after? There is no doubt that the taking of this
step with regard to the defence of the colonies will
involve a very much larger expenditure than any
that we have contemplated for some time past. I
am entirely in accord with those hon. delegates who
have taken the view that, in forming our legislative
machinery, we should give the very utmost power
that can safely and properly be given to the senate
or state council, as it may be called; and I have
been very much surprised to find, on the part of
many who have discussed the question, such a dispo-
sition to confuse the nature and the constitution of
the senate Avith the nature and the constitution of
the upper houses, as AA r e know them in the colonies.
It appears to me that nothing could be further from
the truth than to represent the senate, as we contem-
plate it, as representing only a section of the people.
As I understand the proposition, the members of the
senate will as thoroughly and as fully represent the
people of the various states as the representatives in
the lower house will represent them. In the colonies
now there are, I think, three nominee councils, and
the others are elected on a restricted franchise. With
regard to the senate, its mode of election and its
touch with the people of the various states will he
entirely different; and therefore I am quite unable
to follow' my hon. friend, Mr. Deakin, in his violent
declamation against the past encroachments of upper
houses which are now in existence, and the possi-
bility of encroachments on the rights of the people
by the senate which we hope to create. With regard
to the appeal court —the judiciary—that is a matter
which has been dealt with by the legal members of
the Convention, and as to which I am not disposed
to trespass on the time of the Convention now. All
I would say is, that it appears to me, while admitting
that it would be an enormous convenience and saving
of expense to parties in the colonies to have the
opportunity of appealing to a local court of appeal,
yet I cannot see why the option of appealing to the
Privy Council, as I believe is the case in Canada,
should be withdrawn altogether; and, as regards
severing the links that bind us to the old country, if
the establishment of the proposed court of appeal is
to be taken as an indication of a wish to sever that
link in the least degree, as it has been taken by some
to mean, I say that it would bo deplorable that it
should come about. In this connection I should
like to refer to the very able speech which we heard
this morning from the hon. member, Mr. Dibbs, a
representative of New South Wales. I am one of
those who have been taunted from time to time with
the possible results of the course that I have advo-
cated, and am now advocating, to secure the union of
these colonies. I am told that w hat we are going to
do will lead to something terrible in the future. All
I can say is that what we have hitherto done, and as
far as I know what we are likely to do in the future,
has been done and will be done, with the full concur-
rence of the mother country. As far as I am aware,
there is no disposition to hamper or cramp the efforts
of these free communities in the southern seas in
working out their own salvation as they may think
proper; and if there is to be, as indicated by the hon.
member, Mr. Dibbs, and others, a complete separa-
tion from the mother country, which God forbid—if
there is to be that complete separation which has
been so boldly, and if the hon. member, Mr. Dibbs,
will pardon me for saying so, I think injudiciously,
indicated this morning—if there is to be that com-
plete separation, there is no doubt that it will be with
the full concurrence of those who are responsible for
the destinies of the empire, and who have devoted
their time and attention for many years to the
solution of these problems.
Mr. Gillies : It won’t come in our time!
Mr. BEOWN : I am content to take things as
they are. I think that if such results as have been
pointed out by the hon. member, Mr. Dibbs, are to
come about, it will be a very long time hence. It is
not for us to trouble ourselves about the ultimate
results, but to carry out as best we can those institu-
tions which are likely to give us the full benefit of
the freedom which we have inherited. I have little
more to add. I should have been pleased if we
could have had some more certain indication from the
hon. and learned member, Sir Samuel Griffith, and
others w r ho have studied the question as to what is
likely to be the result of the attempt to graft upon
the legislative body which we propose to create,
responsible government as it is understood in the
colonies. I hope we shall be able to see some
way to do that, because the institution of respon-
sible government, notwithstanding the carping, and


sneering, and adverse criticisms to which it has
been subjected from time to time has, on the whole,
worked fairly well,. It is a mode of government
with which we are familiar, and one which, I think,
is much more in accord with the instincts and the
aspirations of the Australian colonies than any other
mode of administering government which has been
submitted for our consideration. And in this matter
I am entirely in accord with the hon. and learned
member, Mr. Barton, that we must take something
for granted. I think it is not at all impossible or
improbable that we shall find later on that the
responsibility of ministers to the house of representa-
tives will not be after all such a bad thing as it is
feared it may be. For we have to consider—and I
find from a conversation with the hon. and learned
member, Mr, Barton, that he is entirely in accord
with me —that no body of men called upon to assume
the responsibilty of government w r ould, in forming an
administration, ignore—in fact they could not afford
to ignore—the voices and wishes of the senate, or the
council of the states, if it is to bo anything like as
powerful as w r e have indicated our wish to make it.
And to talk of the possibility of the council of the
states acting in the narrow-minded and obstructive
manner indicated by the hon. member, Mr. Deakin,
is, I think, going very much beyond what w r e are
entitled to assume. And with regard to the wish of
the hon. and learned member, Sir Samuel Griffith,
that elasticity should be given to the machinery of
government, I think his view s on this question have
been very much mistaken. Ho has never said that
he wished to see nothing but rigidity in the principles
laid down for the foundation upon which the legis-
lature will work ; but what he said, as I understood
him, wtis that we cannot hope to have a constitution
which will be in accord from time to time with the
views and aspirations of the people for whom it is
framed. The hon. and learned gentleman no doubt
had in his mind what has been well expressed by
Professor Max Muller:
Nature teaches us that nothing can live which cannot grow
and change, and all history confirms nature’s teaching by
showing us that nothing has been more fatal to institutions
than a blind faith in their finality.
And when hon. gentlemen speak of the constitution of
the United States of America, surely they have only to
turn to the volumes of Mr. Bryce, and other standard
works, to see how r , partly by usage, and partly by inter-
pretation by the supreme court, that constitution, not
in very important principles, but in various principles
regulating the relations between states and the federal
government have been varied very considerably during
the last thirty or forty years, or longer. So that I
think what we have to try to do on this occasion is
not to lay down rigid rules to operate for all time;
but simply to construct the frame-wmrk of a consti-
tution which we may submit to our respective par-
liaments with some hope that they will concur in our
work, in order that we may take the first step in the
federation of the whole of the colonies. I hope the
result of our labours will be to give to those colonies,
so far as such conditions can be secured by any
human institutions, unity, strength, peace, and
concord,
Mr. WEIXON: I shall endeavour, Mr. President,
to briefly direct the attention of the Convention to
certain issues which seem to me to have been raised
by the discussion in which we have been engaged
during the past w r eek. The subject before the Con-
vention is a vast one, and it would be impossible for
us to here embrace it in every aspect which it
presents. But I think we should have debated in
vain for the past w r eek if we did not find certain
issues eliminated from the general mass of discussion
and on which our decision is now challenged. That
those issues involve difficulties need not be conceded.
We are all acquainted with the difficulties which sur-
round. them, and we have to find, not merely those
difficulties, but a remedy for them. The people of
our different communities who have sent us here,
charged with the great commission of framing a con-
stitution for them, are quite aware of all the difficulties
which underlie the task, and they look to us, not merely
to see what the difficulties are, but also to see where the
remedy lies. And in that respect I cannot help saying
that I think the forcible speech of the hon. member,
Mr. Dibbs,this morning, is perhaps open to some little
comment, because he put in the most effective way
every possible objection against federation, and found
some other objections, which do not seem, perhaps,
to come strictly within the range of normal objections
to it. He put every possible objection, but certainly
he was not able to favour us with a solution of some
of those difficulties. I think I am safe in saying
that, while the question of the situation of the
capital may be a difficulty, and while the question of
the river Murray may suggest difficulties, we should
be a people sadly wanting in the political genius and
instincts of our forefathers if we allowed any such
questions as those to stand in the way of federation.
And I certainly do not expect to find this great pro-
vince, if I may so call it, or state of New South
Wales, or any other state that now proposes to
federate, turned aside from its purpose by any such
obstacles as these. More than that, 1 say the other
difficulty which the hon. member adverted to—the
fiscal difficulty—is a difficulty which, the nearer you
come to it, really seems less. It looms vast in the
distance; but when you come to grapple with it it
seems gradually to disappear. Now, we have been
challenged, I may say, on this point, to say why it
is that Victoria makes particular stipulations. Sir,
I am not aware that Victoria ever has, or that she
ever desires to make any stipulations whatever. As
far as I understood, what was put forward by my
hon. friend, Mr. Deakin, was in regard to all the
states —not to one state alone, but to all —that they
should be assured of a certain time and certain con-
ditions, before bringing into effect any great fiscal
changes.
Mr. Dexkix : Hear, hear !
Mr. WEIXON : That surely is not a matter in-
volving a serious difficulty with which we shall be
unable to cope. It seems to me, if I may express
my opinion—an opinion which I am glad to find has
been before expressed by many strong representatives
of the protectionist interest, notably by my hon. and
gallant friend, Colonel Smith—that there’ need not
be the slightest uneasiness on the part of any pro-
vince, and there is no need for any special conditions
being made by any province with regard to its vested
interests, or its existing industries, because the situ-
ation is clear. They will all retain their present
tariffs until the federal parliament makes changes,
and we all know that in that federal parliament the
voice of the mass of the people will be thoroughly
represented. I may go further and say that I do
not think any of us can doubt that that voice will bo
for protection against the world. Therefore I appre-
hend that this fiscal question is one the difficulty of
which lies rather upon the surface, and can be
grappled with when we come near to it.
Colonel Smith : Where should we be if it were
decided the other way ?
Mr. WEIXON: Certainly; but I share the
courage which my hon. and gallant friend displayed,
as I understood him yesterday in his speech, when he
said that we in Victoria are afraid of no reasonable
competition, and are prepared to take our lot with
others. But with regard to all the colonies, it may
be necessary to make certain conditions before
bringing into operation any great fiscal changes.
Mr. Dibbs : What about preserving vested in-
terests ?
Mr. WEIXON: That is just what I am talking
about. I say that we need not have the slightest


fear about vested interests not being fully preserved;
because the people of the country will be amply
represented in the federal parliament, and I appre-
hend that they are not disposed to do violence in regard
to any of their interests. But I may say that this very
question of the fiscal difficulty applied in full force
in the case of Canada. There the different provinces
had different tariffs and were allowed to keep their
tariffs until the federal government was able to bring
legislation into operation ; and when the federal
parliament came to deal with the tariff question, it
dealt with all the different existing interests. In
some cases it made concessions; it was a matter of
give-and-take with regard to certain points, and it
considered the wants and the interests and the just
demands of every province in the dominion. Surely
our parliament will do no less than that. We may
contemplate, however strongly attached any of us
may be to protectionist principles, with the most
perfect equanimity the action of the federal parlia-
ment. It seems to me that what we want now with
regard to the fiscal question is not so much pledges
from this Convention, not so much consideration of
general principles, as a committee of some six or
seven practical gentlemen —financial and fiscal
authorities —chosen from this body, who would look
into the details, and be able to give facts and figures
for certain conclusions, at which afterwards the Con-
vention would be asked to arrive. If we get that
knowledge I think our course with regard to fiscal
r.eform and fiscal changes contemplated by federation
will not be difficult. While I have adverted to what
the hon. member, Mr. Dibbs, has said, and the diffi-
culties which he seemed to me to put in our path, I
cannot altogether exclude my hon. friend, Sir James
Lee-Steere, because he also seemed to me somewhat
to exaggerate the difficulties of the situation.
Whether it is that he regarded his colony as being
entitled, as the youngest child of all, to be made
somewhat a pet of, Ido not know; but certainly
he seemed to me to lay down some hard conditions
with regard to his province joining our confederation,
because, as I understood him, he wanted not simply
a money consideration in regard to customs revenue,
but also a railway to he made across the continent to
his province. AVhile I would say that these are
questions of importance —questions of great im-
portance, hut questions to be considered in detail —
they need, not frighten us in proceeding on our path
and firmly treading our way towards that con-
federation which we hope to see brought about.
Therefore, we are indebted to both those hon. gen-
tlemen, aud also to others who put all the difficulties
before us, because, really, when we come to look at
them, we see that they are not so very great. _ Now
I will turn to what seem to me to be the particular
issues which have been raided by this discussion so
far. The first—regarding our fiscal policy and con-
dition, concerning which I say that we want more
light and inquiry than upon anything else —I have
already glanced at. The next—and it is a matter of
great importance —is the question, as it has been
called, of state rights. Certainly it is a serious ques-
tion, because it lies at the root of any proposal to
federate at all, and it is impossible to arrive at a
solution of the question unless upon the principle of
give-and-take. Now we seem to have been agreed
at least up to this morning—that we should federate
upon the lines of the English Constitution as regards
the executive; and, as regards the legislature, that
we should have a senate, in which the states will be
represented, and a house of representatives, in which
the population will be represented. I have liot
heard as yet any serious proposal to abolish our own
form of government —the ancient system of English
constitutional government.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: NO; modern!
Mr. WEIXON : It depends upon what you call
ancient and modern. It is older, at any rate, than
are any of the communities we here represent —I
mean the system of responsible government.
Sir Samuel Griffith : No !
Mr. WRIXON: I differ from the hon. member.
However, our time is too valuable to be occupied
with a discussion as to whether I use the correct term
or not when I say the ancient constitutional usages
of our forefathers. Such I believe them to be.
However, I have heard no proposal —and this is an
important point for hon. gentlemen to consider —to
abandon the English system of responsible govern-
ment in the government of the dominion we are
about to constitute. The hon. member, Dr. Cock-
burn, incidentally said it might be necessary to take
the American system, and Sir Samuel Griffith said
that the constitutional system of England might
develop into something else. That is very true.
Mr. Barton distinctly repudiated, as I understood
when I read his speech, any desire to depart from
the English principle of government. I think we
shall all concur in the wisdom of retaining the
English system of government in our new dominion.
I do not think we shall be prepared to add to the
great difficulties of our present situation the further
difficulty involved in an entire alteration of the
system of government in our dominion, constituting
in that dominion the American system of govern-
ment, ivhile in each state we still retain the English
system. I do not think it is seriously proposed to
do that. Certainly if it were proposed I should say
that it was an exceedingly unwise proposal. Coming
to the question of state rights, I ask hon. gentlemen
to obsers r e that what is proposed to us is that we
should retain the system of English constitutional
government, but that we should give certain powers
to the senate, with a view to the thorough representa-
tion of the states. Now, the states, we are told, under
this proposed plan —which I regret to see has already
obtained the assent of many hon. gentlemen —the states
as represented in the senate, are to have expressly
given to them the power of controlling finance.
That, sir, seems to me an exceedingly serious pro-
position, and we ought to pause well before we go
further with it; for what does it mean F Einance is
government, and government is finance, and under
the English system of government one or other house
must appoint the executive. No one here has pro-
posed to take the executive out of both houses, as in
America, and to have them appointed by the people.
One house or the other under our proposed system
must appoint the executive, and I say that the house
that, really controls the finances will be the house that
will really control the government. You will observe
that this veto, which we are now asked to give to the
senate, will not be a power of general veto, such as
the upper houses in these colonies now have, and
which they exercise, and exercise properly, in an
emergency. This is a power to be expressly given to
the senate, to .be exercised in the interests of the
states, enabling it to amend in any way it pleases any
of the financial proposals of the lower house. That
means the handing over to that body of the real
control of the finances, and the handing over of the
real control of the finances means the handing over of
government. I ask hon. gentlemen in all seriousness
to consider whether it is likely such a proposal could
be seriously entertained ? Our anxiety is to do
something. ‘ Surely we do not wish merely to meet
together here for the purpose of putting forward
hypotheses which will come to nothing. We went to
do something, and 1 ask hon. gentlemen to consider
whether a scheme of government of the kind sugges-
ted will be lasting—that is, a scheme under which
three or four states, with a population of something
over 1,000,000, could control the action of other states
with a population of 2,250,000. Do hon. members
think that that would lie submitted to ? Is it likely
to last ? The larger states, as w r ell as the smaller
ones, have their feelings; and while it may be quite


right to give the smaller states a certain power and
weight, this proposal would give them, not only
weight, but the power of absolute command, control,
and government over the whole of these dependen-
cies. Now, it is of no avail to talk to us of the
United States, because you are not proposing to copy
their form of government. If you were proposing to
take the executive out of the two houses, you might
divide the power between them as you chose ; but
that you do not propose to do.
Sir John Downer; AVhv?
Mr. AVRIXON : I have not heard it proposed as
yet —in fact, in the speeches of Sir Samuel Griffith,
and of Mr. Barton, and other members who sup-
ported their view, the idea was repudiated.
Mr. Clark : No !
Mr. AVRIXON; Does the Attorney-General of
Tasmania mean to say that it is seriously proposed
that we should start a dominion government upon
the lines of the United States?
Mr. Clark : No !
An Hon. Member: Switzerland !
Mr. AVRIXON: Or of Switzerland either? Is
that seriously proposed ?
An Hon. Member: It is to be a hybrid form of
government—it is to contain a little of everything !
Mr. AVRIXOX : Is it really proposed to add to
the difficulties of our position in dealing with federa-
tion by going off into an entirely new experiment as
to the federal government and instituting a form of
government different not only from that of England,
but from that of each of the provinces ?
Dr. Cockburn : It will be necessary !
Mr. AVRIXON: Ido not think so. That remains
to be proved. If you adhere to the English principle
of government you must bear this in mind, that what
is really asked for by the smaller states is practically
the control of the dominion. That is what it comes to.
Mr. Clark : AVhat is asked for is co-ordinate power!
Mr. AVRIXON: There is no such thing as
co-ordinate power in this matter. It is an observa-
tion at least as old as Shakspere that if two men ride
a horse one must ride first. If you have the English
system of government, you can have no co-ordinate
powers as between the two houses: it cannot be
done —it is an impossibility under the English
system. AA r e all know that under that system the
low r er house is the real centre of government.
Occasionally the upper house may differ from the
lower house, but that does not matter—the govern-
ment goes on as before. I would ask hon. gentlemen
to pause before they seriously insist upon this view,
because the effect of it w r ould be this : that while it is
put merely as a financial question—as a question of
amending a money bill —the real effect of it is to
give the determining pow r er of government into the
hands of, it may be, a small minority of the people.
And I do not think any federation founded on those
lines would be lasting. I think w r e are making a
large concession to the smaller states in alio won g
them equal representation in the senate. I think,
also, that there are other concessions wkich might bo
made to those states. But, to maintain that they
should have the financial power claimed for them,
would be to attempt to lay the foundations of this
new confederacy in a thoroughly false way. But do
I ignore the difficulty of the position ? Do I at-
tempt to say that nothing should be done for the
smaller states ? Do I look at merely one side of the
question, and see only the difficulties on that one
aide ? No sir. I admit that there is weight in the
contention that the smaller states ought to be given
as powerful a voice as is consistent with the carrying
on of the ordinary principles of the English system
of government in this dominion. I quite agree, for
one thing, that with regard to the house of repre-
sentatives, the smaller states should have a larger
representation than that to which they wrould be
entitled in proportion to their population.
Mr. CLARK : That is a sop !
Mr. WRIXON: ;It is a very effectual sop—a
sop that was given and taken in Canada. I think,
for instance, that it is unreasonable to provide, as
was provided in the bill of my hon. friend who
interrupts me, for two representatives of Western
Australia in a house of 150. The Attorney-General
of Tasmania talks of a sop. We should need to
offer a very large sop if we were to constitute our
house of representatives upon such lines. I, for one,
would not be in favour of it. I think some minimum
should be fixed, and that any state, however small,
should have a certain number of representatives in
the lower house. The smaller provinces acting
together through their representatives would be a
very important body, and would constitute a formid-
able minority. Hon. members will remember this :
that all governments are, as the government in the
dominion parliament will be, anxious to conciliate all
sections of the house. Governments live by so
doing, and the notion of a government wishing to
override theviews of all the smaller states is imaginary.
It is the first duty and interest of a government to
conciliate every section of the house, and if we were
to give a fair representation to the smaller states, I
think they would form an important body, liable at
any time to be consolidated. Also, I think it is well
worth consideration whether some provision might
not be made that not more than a certain number of
members from the large states should be ministers.
I think something might be done in that direc-
tion, so as to facilitate the government being com-
posed partly of members from the smaller states,
and partly of members from the larger ones.
I think it is not impossible to introduce some such
provision. I think we might also indicate a certain
class of measures wdiich should be included in separate
bills. It is possible that the ingenuity of a carefully
composed committee, looking at this question dis-
passionately and fairly, might be able to point out
certain classes of works, federal and other, which
might be dealt with in separate bills, and, in respect
of these, we might give the senate the full power of
veto. I ask the Convention to look at the question
in the light of remedies such as those I have mentioned,
and of others which hon. gentlemen may be able to
devise better than those I myself suggest. We should
rather look to measures such as these for a remedy
for difficulties than to a violent change in the whole
nature of our government, with the result that we
might set up in the proposed federation a government
by the few instead of by the many. I make this sug-
gestion to the Convention with great sincerity, because
I cannot but feel that if we simply adhere to an
advocacy of each side, and allow ourselves to be
divided into big states men and little states men,
evincing no desire to come to a compromise or arrange-
ment, we shall, in all probability, seriously endanger
the proposed federation. It is just in such a case
as this that the whole of the provinces of Australia
look to us to arrive at some solution of the undoubted
difficulty that presents itself. I will notdwell further
on that subject. 1 wish to say one word about the
constitution of the judicial body of the federation.
It would be one of the greatest advantages of the
federation to have one judiciary, and I trust that
the result of the arrangements we shall make will
be to make the supreme court judges, and also
the county court judges, all through the dominion,
the judges of the dominion government, under its
authority and appointed by it. I think the proposal
to constitute a court of appeal for Australia is
an excellent one. Many minor but great results
will follow in the wake of these proposals. lam not
disposed, at least until I have heard further argument
from him, to agree with the disinclination of the hon.
member, Mr. Clark, to pass a uniform criminal law.
I should have thought at the first blush that it would
be advantageous to have the principles of the criminal


law uniform throughout our new dominion, as cer-
tainly a large portion of our law must be and will
be. Look at the advantage it would be to the mer-
cantile community to have a uniform patent law;
and I trust we shall have a uniform bankruptcy law,
and have the process of the. courts running through-
out our great dominiou. I know that so far I take
the whole Convention with me —my learned as well
as my unlearned friends —I mean unlearned in law
only —but I now come to a point on which I have
observed that several of my learned friends have
expressed opinions which I sincerely trust will be
deeply considered before they are adopted : that is,
in favour of taking away the appeal to the Privy
Council. It seems to me that if you do that you
make a very great sacrifice for a very small gain. At
present it is one of the noblest characteristics of our
empire that over the whole of its vast area, every
subject, whether he be black or white, has a right of
appeal to his Sovereign for justice. That is a great
right, and a grand link for the whole of the British
empire. But it is more than that. It is not, as it
might be considered, a mere question of sentiment,
although I may say that sentiment goes far to make
up the life of nations. It is not merely that; but
the unity of final decision preserves a unity of law
over the whole empire. The Privy Council at any
rate, when it decides, decides finally, and for the
whole of the empire. If you provide that your
court of appeal in Australia shall be final, this
evil may rise: The Supreme Court of Australia,
will decide (say) a commercial question on the con-
struction of a charter party in one way this year,
while next year the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council, composed, 1 will say for the sake of argu-
ment, of a very strong court, will decide the very
same question in another way. We should then be
in this curious position: that we should have a
different law from that of the rest of the empire on a
great mercantile question. There would then be a
feeling in our local courts as to whether they should
follow the decision of the court of appeal in Australia
or the decision which they might consider to be the
better law of the judicial committee in England. I
believe there is a vast gain in unity of administration
and interpretation of the law, and in having in all
these distant and scattered dependencies, not only
the decisions of the English judges to go upon, but
also the legal literature of England, the books and
comments upon them, to guide us as to the law on
different subjects. All lawyers know how valuable
that is. All that, however, would be lost when you
cut away the connection in judicial matters between
the dominion and the old country. I may mention
another difficulty which seems to me to stand in tho
way of this proposal. I think it would be very
difficult to constitute a court of appeal in Australia
sufficiently strong to command unquestioned confi-
dence in the provinces, the decisions of whose courts
it would over-rule. I will take the example of my
own colony of Victoria. There, important matters
are heard before six judges, and I believe I may say
truly that those judges are six of the ablest lawyers
in Victoria. I doubt whether it would be possible to
constitute in the dominion a supreme couit that
would so completely overshadow that court, and all
other provincial courts, as to give perfect satisfaction
when it reversed their decisions ; whereas, when we
go home to the old land —partly on account of the able
men who generally, I do not say on every occasion,
preside at the Privy Council, and partly, perhaps, it
may be, on account of the feeling of veneration for
the old land, and partly, also, on account of the*fact
that the decision of the Privy Council is final and
general throughout the whole empire—the decisions
of that court are always accepted and acquiesced in
by the different colonies, the decisions of whose
courts are dealt with by it. You will throw away all
that if you take away the appeal to the Queen from
the people of Australasia. I do not think the evil
you seek to cope with is very great, and I do not
think the appeals would be very many. Every lawyer
knows that when appeals are made, the courts impose
conditions as to costs, and in other ways, which, as
far as possible, prevent the appeals from being too
numerous.
Sir John Downer : The conditions imposed are
insufficient!
Mr. WEIXON: I hope to see the hon. member,
Sir John Downer, a member of that appeal court, and
I trust he will impose sufficient conditions before he
allows an appeal to the Privy Council. I have no
doubt he will do so. I will not delay the Convention
any longer on this point; but I have noticed that so
many gentlemen, particularly my legal brethren, have
declared so positively in favour of a final court of
appeal in Australia, that I wish to ask hon. members
to think about it before we arrive at a final deter-
mination. I will not detain hon. members any
further, because I feel we are bound to be brief if
we want to get to business. I repeat that I do not
think the difficulties are so great when you look at
them. There are always difficulties when } r ou Avish
to take action. What we want to do is to grapple
with one or tw r o points, and I think they can bo
readily grappled with. The fiscal difficulty I believe
to be imaginary. It only needs to be taken in hand
by an intelligent committee, who can see practically
how it stands and what we should do. The state
rights difficulty is equally imaginary, if we only fix in
our minds what we want and what we intend to do.
Sir John Downer : It is not imaginary in the w ay
the hon. member has put it!
Mr. WEIXON : It is imaginary if we only fix in
our minds what we desire to do.
Mr. Fitzgerald : The hon. member has said that
government is finance, and that finance is government!
Mr. WEIXON : The hon. member who favoured
me with his attention at that part of my address did
not favour me with his attention when I pointed out
Avays in which the rights of the smaller states could
be better secured ; and he ought to consider those
ways before he decides absolutely in accordance with
his interjection. With regard to the question of state
rights, we must consider Avhat is proposed. No one
proposes that the smaller states should be swamped
or voiceless. No one wishes that, or Avould agree to
that. But on the other hand, does anyone propose
that these smaller states should govern ? No one wll
propose that, and if we approach the sub ject reason-
ably, we ought to have no difficulty in arriving at a
satisfactory conclusion. The great characteristic of
Englishmen has always been, not that they do not
get into difficulties, but the wonderful way in which
they get out of them; how they fight through them ;
how they face them; how they work through to a
solution of them, I venture to think that we who
are Englishmen, or the descendants of Englishmen,
will not be frightened by the difficult points Avhich
have been raised here, but that w T e shall grapple Avith
them and overcome them ; and I haA r e no doubt that
we shall succeed in the enterprise which we have in
hand.
Mr. J. EOEEEST: It Avas not my intention to
speak to-day; but as there seems to be a disinclina-
tion on the part of members to continue the debate,
and as it is still early, I have no objection to offer to
the Convention at this stage the remarks Avhich I
deem it my duty to make, and, as I have not A 7 ery
much to say, I shall not detain hon. gentlemen very
long. I am very pleased indeed to be here ; and the
colony I represent is both pleased and proud to have
an opportunity of sending delegates to this great Con-
vention. It is the first time, as you are all aware,
that AA r e in Western Australia have been able to meet
the representatives of other colonies on quite equal
terms; and it is a great pleasure to us and a great
privilege that the first occasion on Avhich Ave meet oijt


equal terms tho statesmen of Australia should bo
with the object of founding an Australian dominion.
There is no doubt that tho feeling in Australia is
that it should not bo'allowed to remain a number of
small states. I hope that the result of our delibera-
tions in the Convention will be all that the people of
Australia desire ; and I also hope that you, sir, who
have conceived this great idea, may be rewarded for
your great patriotism and your loyalty not only to
the old country, from which you sprang, but also to
Australia; and I hope that the result of your exer-
tions will be that, at no distant date, there will be
established in Australia a federal dominion. Tliese are
my individual ojnnions. I have looked forward for
many years to the day when this continent would
become one great dominion under the Crown. I have
real with very great interest the able speeches which
were delivered by the members of the Convention
before our arrival, and I have watched w r ith much
interest the proceedings of the Convention since.
The speeches, so far as I am able to judge, are re-
markable for their dignity and for their earnestness,
as well as for their broad and patriotic views.
I notice also that the speeches generally were not
in any way local in the directions they took. I felt
myself in some difficulty, because I should have liked
to follow in the course taken by those who preceded
me. I will, to the utmost of my power, and as far
as lam permitted, follow in that course. But I have
a duty, and that duty compels me to examine the
matter closely, as it affects the states having small
populations and large areas, and foremost amongst
these is the colony I represent —Western Australia.
I regret that I shall have to descend in some remarks
I shall have to make from the pinnacle to which other
hon. members attained, and come down, I fear, to
what may be called, by some, rather narrow views.
The colony I represent is in a very exceptional
position. My hon. friend, Sir James Lee-Steere, has
placed this before the Convention to some extent.
It has a large area, nearly one-third of the continent
of Australia. It has, as you are all aware, a small
population. It is just entering upon the manage-
ment of its own affairs. It is like a young man just
starting upon his career. Its people have not con-
sidered this great question of federation. We have
no communication whatever with the other colonies
except by sea. A thousand miles of unoccupied
country separates us from this part of Australia. All
these colonies now are independent. They have their
own governments, they are as independent and as free
as any of the nations of the world, and we shall have
to ask them, in framing a constitution, to give up
some of their independence in order to become a
nation. Individually they will lose in prestige, and
instead of being independent states, they will become
to a certain extent merely provinces in order that
collectively they may flourish, and in time become a
nation. I believe that the question of prestige is one
which will have an important effect in dealing with
this question when it comes to be considered by the
people of the different colonies, because, to some
extent now, all these colonies are prominently before
the world. They have their independent governors,
their independent legislators, and their independent
governments, and they are to a certain extent known
to the world ; but under a federated government we
shall have to be content to sink our individual pro-
vinces, and become part of the whole nation. lam
quite sure that we shall lose in prestige individually,
and we shall probably suffer socially, I believe that
that to a very large extent, has been the result of
federation in Canada. As far as I have been able to
judge, and I have travelled through tho country, the
provinces of Canada are to a great extent unknown
outside of the dominion. Even the statesmen and
governors of the several provinces are scarcely known
beyond the limits of their own country. But that is
not the case in these colonies at the present time.
AVc all know who is the Governor of Victoria or the
Governor of iNew South Wales, and who are the
prominent statesmen here. Few people, however,
will tell you anything about the prominent men in
the states of America, or about the prominent men
in tho provinces of Canada. Although, as I said
before, this is a matter of sentiment, it will have to
be considered; and, since we are to a great extent
ruled by sentiment, it will be largely discussed, and
will require great attention, when the question comes
to be thrashed out in the parliaments of the different
colonies. At the same time I feel sure that every
Australian, whether he be an Australian by birth
or by adoption, must look forward to the time
when he will be a citizen of Australia, when his
boast will be, not that he is a Victorian, a New
South Welshman, a Queenslander, a South Austra-
lian, or a Tasmanian, but that he is an Australian,
and I believe that this is gradually becoming tho
position. It is not usual, when you meet people
in other parts of the world, and ask them where
they came from, for them to say that they are Tas-
manians or Victorians, but they call themselves
Australians. I believe that this sentiment is taking
deep root in the minds of the people of this continent,
and that the desire of young Australians undoubtedly
is that Australia shall become a nation, and that we
shall be 110 longer separated from one another by
artificial lines. After all, these boundaries, as I
believe was said by some one the other day, are merely
artificial lines on the map. In some of the colonies
where settlement has extended they have attained
some practical permanence, and are actually known
on the ground, but as a rule how they were fixed ?
Merely in a haphazard fashion on the map. The
boundary between Western Australia aud the more
easterly colonies is the 129 th meridian of longitude ;
but that boundary was fixed upon merely at hap-
hazard, without any reference to the interests which
might be involved. Again, the boundary between
Victoria and New South Wales is the river Murray
—a most unsuitable division. No line of division is
so unsuitable as a river. The people living on each
side of it marry, and become virtually the same
people; but they are divided by artificial boundaries,
such as customs tariffs, and everything is done to
estrange them from, rather than to make them more
friendly to, each other. In dealing with this question
I feel certain that although sentiment, as I have just
said, may play some important part, the good sense
of the people of Australia will show itself ; but we
shall have to be able to show the people of the
colonies that there is something to be gained by their
becoming federated. At any rate, if we cannot show
them that there is something to be gained, we shall
have to prove to them that they will not lose anything
by federation, and that in sinking to the condition of
provinces or states —I do not think there is a great
deal in the name, both words mean about the same
thing ; but, if I may be allowed to say so, I myself
prefer the name state —they will be far greater as an
integral part of the Australian dominion than as
independent communities. That, it seems to me, will
be the duty of those who have to impress upon the
people of the different colonies the advantages of
federation. They will have to show that there is
something to be gained, or, at any rate, that there
will be nothing lost by the act. I feel sure that upon
our return to our respective colonies we shall be con-
fronted with questions, not only by the supporters of
the government in the house, but also by the opposi-
tion, who, on all subjects, even upon those which
commend themselves generally, take an opposite side
to that taken by the government; —we shall be asked,
" What advantage are we to get by giving up our
individuality and independence ?" and what will bo
our reply ? I have not heard this matter argued in
this august assembly yet. It seems to bo taken for
granted by every one, in our desire to become a great


nation, and to bind all parts of Australia together,
that federation is essential, and that the people will,
of course, consider that federation is a desirable thing.
Colonel SMITH : But the hon. member's colony will
have to give up its independence!
Mr. J. FORREST: We shall have to give up
something. It is impossible to have a federal govern-
ment unless that government is strong, and if any one
holds the idea that we are to continue to enjoy all the
privileges which we now have, I should like to ask
what power is the federal government to have ? We
shall be asked, "What advantage are we to get by
giving up our individuality ?" and we shall say,
"Our desire is to become a nation. You will be
defended in the time of war by the whole of Australia;
we will make you good laws, that shall apply and
have effect throughout the whole of Australia, and
we will give you free-trade all over the continent."
It occurs to me that those are the principal advan-
tages which we shall be able to promise to those who
ask us what they will gain by federation. Their
re|)ly will be something of this kind: " You say we
will be a nation; but we are part and parcel of a
great and mighty nation already, and, as far as the
matter of defence, we are defended by the power of
Great Britain—the land of our forefathers ; she
alone is able to protect us from the forces we have
to fear, from those forces which will come across the
sea. ' Western Australia will ask, " How could
Eastern Australia defend us ; how can she bring her
armies, if she has them, to defend us from invasion.
"Why, there are 1,000 miles of unoccupied territory
between our occupied lands and theirs." As to the
good laws which are to prevail throughout Australia,
I expect the reply will be the one which these col-
onies once returned to the British Government: "We
do not want your good laws ; we will have our own."
Again, as to the question of free-trade: it will be
argued that that policy is even undesirable, and if it
is desirable they will say, " AVe should like to settle
it in our own way." It will be argued, too, that it is
quite possible to have free-trade without federation.
These are some of the arguments which will be used,
I fear, by some of the smaller states, and I think they
will require to be adequately replied to. I venture to
think we shall have to show that the scheme is prac-
tically not disadvantageous to the different states, or
I feel sure it will be almost impossible to obtain their
acquiescence. I agree generally with the able
remarks of the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, in
reference to the composition of the upper house. I
believe that the only security the lower states would
have would be that the senate should be strong and
powerful. The colonies with small populations and
large areas must not be annihilated altogether.
Their only protection is a powerful upper house. I
should like to ask hon. members what influence, for
instance, would these small states have in a lower
house of this federal parliament if they are to have
two or three members representing them? It seems
to me that if the lower house were fixed upon a
basis of population, say, of 30,000 people for each
representative—l do not suppose you would be able
to have a lesser number than that, or the house
would soon be too large—New South Wales and Yic-
toria would each have something like 10 members,
whereas Tasmania would have 5, Queensland 14;
South Australia, 10; whilst Western Australia
would have only 2. New South Wales and Vic-
toria, which are two colonies situated close together,
whose interests are almost identical, having, to a large
extent, the same climate, the same productions,
would each have more than the whole of the other
colonies put together. The whole of the other colo-
nies together would have about thirty represen-
tatives, whereas each of these colonies would have
about forty. I should like to ask, what security
would all the other smaller states have if these two
colonies were in any way combined, and it is only
natural to expect them to combine ? I agree with
what fell from the hon. member, Mr. Barton, that
resolution No. 1 should be very clearly specified, and
that
the actual territory of any existing province shall not he sub-
ject to any kind of diminution or absorption for the purpose of
constituting new provinces, except with the consent of the
legislature of the province affected.
It seems to me that that is an important provision, and
I think it was clearly intended by you, Mr. President,
when you drafted the resolution that the terri-
tory of any state should not be interfered
with, except with the consent of the parliament
of that state. I think it would be w r ell to
have the words employed by the hon. member, Mr.
Barton, added to the resolution so'as to make it per-
fectly clear. I believe the only security to those
states, with small populations, is that the senate or
upper house should have equal power with the loxver
house in regard to amending bills. I cannot see that
there is any great objection to this, because, as far as
I know 7, it is the custom which exists in the United
Stales of America, and I have been informed, and
believe it is true, that it even exists in Tasmania, and
that the Tasmanian upper house amends all bills,
monetary or otherwise. I do not exactly know 7 what
the law of South Australia is, but the same privilege
was contended for there for a long time; and I do
not see any reason why the other house should not
amend money bills, because they would be as clearly
the representatives of the people as would the house
of representatives. I favour the election of the
upper house of this federal government by the legis-
lature in the same way as in the United States. I
believe that it is the best possible way of getting an
upper house, because the consequence of having an
upper house elected by the masses of the people is
that you get two houses too much alike, and the
object of an upper house is thus, to some extent,
frustrated. I cgunot myself see what objection there
can be to the legislature electing the upper house. I
believe you would get the most wise and most experi-
enced house in that way. An upper house would be
exactly the sort of house as that we now see before
us, because we have all been nominated and elected
by our respective legislatures. It seems to me, if I
may be allowed to say so, that such a house would
not be inferior to any house to be elected directly by
the people. I do not see myself, w r ith the little con-
sideration I have been able to give to the subject,
how the pow y er to make and unmake ministries can be
taken away from the lower house. A federal lower
house would be a different body from the provincial
bodies now existing. It would be elected by countries
separated from one another. We should not have a
lower house representing a particular area of country,
in the same way as we have in Victoria or New South
Wales, or any of the other colonies ; but we should
have in our lower house a representative body elected
by different peoples, separated, probably, by wide
distances from each other, and I think therefore that
you would have a different kind of house from the
lower house in any particular state. You would not
find them so influenced by local events, and you
would find them, I think, more likely to take a calm
judicial view of the situation than would any house
representing the people in any particular state or
province. I do not believe in too radical experiments
or novelties in legislation, and I myself should very
much prefer to see the future legislature of the
dominion of Australia based on the principles of the
legislature of the old country—in fact, similar in all
respects to the legislatures of these colonics. It is a
form of government under which we have been
accustomed to live —under which we have flourished —
and which we, to some extent, understand. It is a
form of government xve are familiar with and like,
and I myself have no desire to go in for any novelties
or new-fangled notions in government, even if they


have been proved to exist in other parts of the world.
I would rather stick to the old ship—follow the
traditions of the British House of Commons, and try
to found in this part of the world something like that
which exists in the old country. lam therefore very
much inclined to favour generally the resolutions
which you, sir, have placed before the Convention,
except that the senate should have power to amend all
bills, money bills included, and that the colonies with
small populations should have a fixed number of repre-
sentatives until their population entitled them to exceed
such fixed number. That has been very forcibly placed
before hon. members by the hon. member, Mr. Brown,
of Tasmania, and by my hon. friend, Mr. Wrixon,
and I think that it would be a good way out of the
difficulty, I think also that it is desirable that the
Constitution Act should make provision for new
states to be admitted into the federation, so that any
state which is not willing or able to enter into the
federation at the present time might at some future
time be enabled to do so. There is, I believe, a
clause in the Canadian Constitution enabling colonies
to enter the federation, and I think that it would be
a wise provision for us. While I am generally in
accord with the resolutions which you, sir, have placed
before us, with the one or two exceptions that I have
named, I believe there will be extreme difficulty, and
that it is extremely unlikely that the colony which I
represent will agree to join the proposed confedera-
tion unless we can show the people there some means
of rapid communication between these colonies and
ourselves. I do not myself think that that is an
insuperable difficulty ; but it seems to me a difficulty
that will require to be removed before we shall be
able to satisfy our people that it will be to their
advantage to enter into the federation. I have now
exhausted all that I have to say on the subject. I
thank hon. members for the attention that they have
given me. I fear that I have not added very much
to this very interesting debate; but I can say, sir,
that it is the desire of all Western Australians to
join in this great federation ; and, as far as I am
able, I will endeavour to urge on the matter. At the
same time I see practical difficulties in the way.
People sometimes look at things in a narrow point of
view ; and, unless we can show them that it is to their
material advantage to join with the other colonies—
in fact that if they will not gain anything they will
not, at any rate, lose anything—l see very great
difficulties in the way. In conclusion, sir, I can only
say that I hope that the time is not far distant when
all the difficulties to which reference has been made
by myself and others will be removed, and that we
shall eventually be able to frame a constitution which
xv ill be acceptable to the people, and do justice to
each part of Australia.
Motion (by Mr. Gillies) agreed to;
That the debate be now adjourned until to-morrow.
Convention adjourned at 4 47 p.m.

Federal Constitution (sixth day’s debate) —Adjournment.
The President took the chair at 11 a.m.
FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.
SIXTH day’s debate.
Debate resumed on resolutions proposed by Sir
Henry Parkes (vide page 11).
Mr. GULLIES : I do not know, sir, whether it is
an advantage to appear early or to appear late in
this debate. Perhaps there are advantages both
ways. This I can say: that hon. gentlemen who
have addressed themselves to the subject before the
Convention have adopted a course which I am sure
many of us would often like to see adopted in our
own legislatures —that is, to make it a general rule
to have the discussions as short as possible; and I
think we, to some extent, may claim that credit on
the present occasion. It is not my intention, Mr.
President, to discuss technically the resolutions which
you have submitted. We all take it for granted that
the resolutions are submitted in a general form to
indicate what we desire to see as the basis of a
federal constitution, and in that light I view the
resolutions as generally indicating the objects which
we all have in view. I confess to have been taken a
little by surprise yesterday when my hon. friend, Mr.
Dibbs, spoke upon this important question. I trust
I did not do him an injustice when I thought that a
considerable portion of his speech appeared to have
originated in a desire to speak slightly from a party
point of view; as a gentleman who, although I
believe he is desirous of seeing a federation of the
colonies, yet, at the same time, does not appear to be
quite satisfied with the federation which is offered,
or which we are likely to accept. While he was
quoting from a public journal here which published
some articles and letters some years ago upon the
subject of federation, he indicated that it appeared
to him, as far as I could gather, that we were making
a mistake at the present moment, because we are pro-
posing a federation before we had accomplished a
customs union. Now, history is sometimes useful;
but I think ancient history of that kind is not at all
useful on the present occasion. And I may be per-
mitted to remind the hon. gentleman that sentiments
such as these coming from him at the present time,
appear to indicate that he has forgotten the commis-
sion which the parliament, of which he is a member,
has given to him to appear at this Convention to deal
with this question. May Ibe permitted to remind
him that he holds a commission to do certain work ?
He has accepted that commission, and yet he docs
not appear to be perfectly clear as to the objects for
which the commission was furnished to him. Will
he allow me to draw his attention to a resolution
passed in the legislature of New South Wales only a
very short time ago, in which it set out the principles
in which it concurred when it granted the hon. mem-
ber a commission along with other hon. gentlemen to
represent it in this Convention ?
(1.) That this House concurs in the following resolution :
(a) That, in the opinion of this conference, the best inter-
ests and the present and future prosperity of the Aus-
tralian colonies will be promoted by an early union
under the Crown ; and, while fully recognising the
valuable services of members of the Convention of 1883
in founding the Federal Council, it declares its opinion
that the seven years which have since elapsed have
developed the national life of Australia in population,
in wealth, in the discovery of resources, and in self-
governing capacity, to an extent which justifies the
higher act, at all times contemplated, of the union of
these colonies under one legislative and executive
government, on principles just to the several colonies.
It also passed a resolution that four members be
appointed during the present year to act as
delegates to a National Australian Convention, and be
empowered to consider and report upon an adequate
scheme for a federal constitution for the Australian
colonies.
And among the names of gentlemen who were
appointed on that occasion I find the name of
George Richard Dibbs, Esquire. I should have
thought, sir, that the mere fact of the bon. gentleman
having accepted that commission to make an effort
to frame an adequate scheme for a federal constitu-
tion would have precluded him fx*om making the
observation he made, that we were beginning at the
wrong end ; because, from what he told us yesterday,
it appears that in his judgment we ought to have
started by coming to an agreement as to a customs
union before ever we attempted to frame a scheme
for a federal constitution. I think the hon. gentleman


placed himself in a false position yesterday when
he appeared to hare forgotten the circumstances in
which he is placed.
Mr. Dibbs ; Did the Victorian Parliament pass a
similar resolution ?
Mr. GILLIES : Exactly similar, I believe. With
the exception of the names of the delegates, it is
verbatim et literatim the same.
Mr. Dibbs ; Then, may I ask the hon. member, by
w r ay of explanation, whether the delegates from Vic-
toria were justified by their commission in asking
for material guarantees with regard to the fiscal
policy of Victoria ?
Mr. GILLIES : If my hon. friend had listened to
what my hon. colleague, Mr. Wrixon, said yesterday
he w'ould have found that he was completely under
a misapprehension about any such demand for a
guarantee. I w r ould point out to him that no pro-
posal has been made by the A ictorian delegates, nor
did the parliament ask them or require them in any
way whatever, to insist upon any guarantee at all.
But what parliament called upon them to do was
what is stated in the resolution, namely, to go to the
Convention for the purpose of making an effort to
frame an adequate scheme for a federal parliament
and a federal government. That is what parliament
asked them to do, and of course, having to frame a
constitution to carry out that object, that constitu-
tion must necessarily include a variety of measuies
which wnuld require to bo dealt with before it could
be properly framed. .
Mr. Deakin : “ Just to the several colonies !
Mr. GILLIES: And the only question that
w T as raised by any of my colleagues, as far as I under-
stood them when I heard their speeches, and under-
stood them after reading the report of their speeches
was this: that one of the most important questions
that would come before the Convention m the fram-
ing of that constitution would be the question ot
customs, and that question is dealt with in a very
simple manner in the resolutions, which you, Mr.
President, have submitted. The resolutions set out
first what all the colonics understood—that one ot
the true objects of federation was to enable the
colonies to join together, so that there would be the
most perfect freedom between them in regard to all
articles passing to and fro. Every one understood
that that would be necessarily one of the principal
objects that would be secured by federation. Then
the next question arose necessarily as connected
with that, namely, that of course it would be in-
dispensable that the federal parliament should have
the power of imposing duties of customs in order, m
the first place, to raise the necessary revenue, and
in the second place to obtain duties on articles in-
troduced from abroad. In other words, the question
which was raised was whether it was contemplated
by all hon. members that such a tariff would be im-
posed on all articles coming from abroad as, at any
rate, would secure all the colonies which had by
means of the imposition of duties raised large sums
of money, and originated and maintained industries.
That question not raised merely by Victoria; it
has been raised by several other colonies. _
Mr. Dibbs : It w r as raised by Mr. Deakm.
Mr! GILLIES : Victoria wants no more guarantee
than every other colony in the group desires to have.
Victoria is in this position : that she can express t e
most confident hope that justice will be done to all
the colonies by the federal parliament m this respect.
AVe have not come into this Convention for the pur-
pose of saying that if we do not get material guar-
antees we refuse to join the federation. The colony
of Victoria makes no such statement.
Hon. Members : Hear, hear!
Mr. GILLIES : The colony of Victoria is prepared
to join the other colonies in framing a federal con-
stitution, and in creating a federal parliament for the
purpose of accomplishing great and necessary
federal work; otherwise she does not desire to
claim anything that the other colonies will
not claim and obtain. Victoria desires, as the
hon. member, Mr. Dibbs, said yesterday, o
join hand in hand with the other colonies in
creating a federal constitution, a federal parliament,
and a federal government, in the confident hope that
justice will be done to all the colonies in the creation
of that federation. The hon. member seemed to
think that there were some proposals in these resolu-
tions which involve such serious difficulties that it
would not be possible for him to concur in them ; in
fact, I think he told us that he would take care in
Committee to do all that he possibly could to take
away the power proposed to be granted under the
federal constitution to the federal parliament o±
dealing with the very large subject of defences. The
hon member appeared to me to think that the object
indicated in these resolutions was to _ bring about
what is known as a standing army, which the hon
member thought would be a menace to the whole ot
the continent. Now, in one sense all the colonies
have small standing armies.
Colonel SMITH : There are altogether 31,000 men !
Mr. GILLIES : The people themselves havo
undertaken the duty of creating such a force as in
their judgment, would be sufficient to meet any toe
that might land on these shores. There is nothing
in these resolutions that I can see that would justify
the statement that it is contemplated by any colony,
or by any group of colonies, or by any individual, to
bring about a standing army of such a kind as that
to which the hon. member referred—a standing army
that might be a menace to the liberties of the people.
The people themselves have created such forces as we
have, it is they who willingly maintain them, and
these resolutions contemplate no more and no less.
It is possible that when you have to consider the
report of Major-General Edwards and the reports
of your own officers, it may be found absolutely
necessary to make some slight addition to the forces
you already have upon this continent, and to provide
that those forces should be under the command ot
some one having the control of the whole of them.
In fact a great deal has been written in the w hole
of the colonies as to the necessity for maintaining a
federal force in a proper and effective condition, so
that in the event at any future time—and I hope it
will be in the distant future—of a foreign force
landing at any point upon the continent, arrangements,
might be made by which a joint force might be con-
centrated at that point, and so that instead ot
separate defences we might have one united defence
of Australia. Surely we are not to be told that,
because that is in contemplation, there is at the same
time some secret purpose or object of depriving the
people of their rights on any particular occasion
when possibly there may be some great difference ot
opinion on a great public question. There have been
no peoples in these colonies who have^ not enjoyed
the most perfect freedom to express their opinions in
public, and through their representatives in parlia-
ment, on any public question of importance, lhere
has never been any occasion when such an oppor-
tunity has not been given to every man m this
country, and so free and liberal are our laws and
public institutions that it has never been suggested
by any mortal upon this continent that that right
should be in any way restricted. On the contrary,
we all feel proud of "the freedom which everyone m
this country enjoys. It is a freedom not surpassed
in any state in the world, not even in the boasted
republic of America, I venture to say that there is
not a colony in this group but is so attached
to its institutions and its laws, and the freedom
existing under those laws, that there need
be no suspicion of anybody of the kind indi-
cated by the hon. gentleman being created. It
is possible that the force now existing may be


increased sufficiently for the adequate defence of the
shores of these colonies against aggression ; hut I am
astonished that the hon. gentleman should for a
moment have imagined that it was in the mind of any
one of the colonies to create a standing army of such
a character as would he a menace to the liberties of
the people. Those liberties have been too well
enjoyed and too well appreciated to permit of any
body of men, whether in a federal or in a local par-
liament, interfering with them, and I hope the hon.
member will release from his mind any idea that it is
contemplated under these resolutions to establish a
federal force or standing army that would in the
slightest degree interfere with our liberties, or that
any of us, even in imagination, had that object in
view.
Mr. Dibbs : The hon. member forgets that we have
heard other speeches delivered in this chamber by the
mover of these resolutions!
Mr. GILLIES : I have not heard a speech delivered
in this chamber which conveyed the opinion or idea
the hon. member has suggested.
Mr. Dibbs : Not in this Convention!
Mr. GILLIES: I heard the address of the Pre-
sident, and I confess 1 should be surprised if it were
found possible to construe any portion of it as mean-
ing an attack upon the liberties of the colonies. To
me it is utterly incomprehensible how that view could
have got into the mind of the hon. member. I can
only assure the hon. member —and I trust he will see
that it is so —that it is not in any way in contem-
plation, and that it is not expressed even in the most
vague way language can suggest, to give effect to the
idea he thought proper to indicate yesterday. I think
there will be no difficulty in the hon. member obtain-
ing the assurance of every member of the Convention
that they have had no such idea in their minds, and
that they would be among the first—in fact, quite as
ready as is the hon. gentleman himself—to put their
foot down upon any proposition so utterly intolerable
to the feelings and views of the whole of the people
of these colonies. The hon. member touched another
point, and since reading one of the newspapers pub-
lished in Sydney this morning it would appear to me
that either he himself was yesterday inspired or that
he has since inspired someone else, because in the news-
paper to which I refer—and it is a journal which is
acknowledged to feel very strongly the importance of
federation —the writer appears to have followed the
hon. member in his idea that we were justified in
taking into consideration the question of the seat of
the federal government. I thought yesterday—and
I trust the hon. member will excuse me if I am
dealing with him unjustly—that he was dealing rather
harshly with us when he said ho intended to throw a
bomb-shell amongst us. I thought that rather hard,
because I could not imagine what necessity could
have arisen for the throwing of bomb-shells.
Mr. Mujsko : The hon. member wants to burst us
up!
Mr. GILLIES : Of course I assume—l am bound
to assume —that although the hon. gentleman may
have strong views on the question of federation, and
cannot altogether agree with some of the views con-
tained in these resolutions, yet he is honestly anxious
to bring about a federation of these colonies on terms
just to each of them, and to do so as soon as possible.
I will take that for granted ; but I will ask the hon,
member, seeing that we are all gathered together
for the purpose of framing such a constitution,
seeing that all the colonies who sent us hither
believe, so far as the expression of their opinions
is concerned, that the time has come when that
should be done, how is it that he is anxious to throw
bombs amongst us ? Of course, bombs are unpleasant
things, and we can only assume that he was prepared
to throw bomb-shells amongst us because he desired
to divide us, and to give us as much trouble as pos-
ible in coming to conclusions. One of his bombs was
that we are bound to undertake the consideration of
the question as to the site of the federal parliament
and federal government. I venture to submit that
that would be a great mistake. Our troubles are
sufficiently numerous at the present time ; our diffi-
culties in the way of a general agreement are suffi-
ciently great; and Ave should be regarded as men
Avithout worldly experience if Ave unnecessarily at
present undertook to determine the site of the federal
parliament and federal government. I believe there
is a golden rule in the courts that the judges Avill not
determine a point which they are not necessarily
called upon to determine at once; but they deter-
mine the point Avhich comes foremost, and which may
settle the question under consideration. That is an
admirable rule, and in this case it Avould be a golden
rule to folloAV. I feel certain that hon. members Avho
have the responsibility of considering the important
question of the framing of a federal constitution will
agree that they are not called upon to consider
questions that are not now pressing upon their atten-
tion. That that question Avill have to be considered
and determined by-and-by there is 110 doubt; but I
do not think the members of this ConA'enlion will be
held to be cowards, or to be afraid to determine that
question Avlien the time comes. I say the time has
not come for the settlement of that question, and it
is a most serious mistake for any hon. member to
attempt to tliroAv bombs into this Convention by
raising unnecessary difficulties in the settlement of the
questions Ave liaA r e to consider. Ido not think, how-
ever anxious the lion, member may be for the settle-
ment of the question of the site of the capital, that
ho need press it upon our attention ; because Ave have
greater Avork before us, and work that must first be
attended to. The hon. member, Mr. Dibbs, Avas also
good enough to say that he had the spirit of a repub-
lican. Ido not knoAv Avhat that is. Ido not know
that if Ave created a republic on this continent to-
morrow Ave could pass any better laAvs or establish a
better constitution than the individual states enjoy
at the present time. When I hear opinions expressed
that probably a republican form of government
Avould be very much better than any other in these
states, I feel bound to ask how can a man come to
that conclusion P Is it merely because he is in love
Avith a president, or that he does not like the Queen ?
If our form of government were of a kind that Avas
disagreeable or distasteful to him or to the people, I
could understand such an opinion. Great changes
in the government of states are not brought about
without some reason, and unless the hon. gentleman
desires we should think that he has some substantial
reasonsfor his desire to alter the constitution of these
states, I Avonder Avhy he made such a statement. It
may be that at some future time, perhaps 100 years
hence, AA e shall be an empire, and not a republic, and
Ave might flourish quite as Avell under an empire as
we should under a republic. But I must say that I
think the time is not approaching, in fact, as far as
AA'e can judge, it is far away, when this continent will
be under a republican government. That the people
will ha\-e an opportunity of determining that for
themselves when the time comes goes without saying.
But it does not appear to me to be in the right tone
and in the right spirit to introduce such a question
when Ave are called upon to frame a federal con-
stitution for the purpose of enabling a number of
states to join together for doing higher work than
the individual states can do for themselves. That Avas
the idea AA'hich Avas in the minds of those Avho, a
number of years ago, desired to see these colonies
federated. They foresaw, and, after all, it w T as not
difficult to foresee, that as these colonies Avere under
separate gOA r ernments and parliaments they Avould
frame legislation which, instead of uniting with
bonds of affection the people of these states belong-
ing to the same race, professing the same religion,
and living under one imperial government, Avould


have the effect of increasing year by year the difficul-
ties in the way of joining in a federal union. These
men were, therefore, extremely anxious, even in the
earliest days, to come to some understanding in
favour of a great federal union. But many of the
colonies had only just then obtained their Constitu-
tions, and they believed that the time had not come
for them to join in a larger union. Now, however,
when we are prepared to join in a larger union, we
are coolly told, " What is the good ? In all pro-
bability in a few years we shall be a great republic,
and we shall then have the whole of our destinies in
our own hands. We can then make such laws as we
think proper, without even consulting the Imperial
Government or her Majesty." In my judgment
such remarks do not sound well at the present
moment. We have nothing to complain of. We
have no reason to find fault, and therefore there is
no justification in speaking of such a dissolution of
the connection between these colonies and the
empire. AVe stand in close relationship to the
empire, and there is nothing which we have ever
asked in reason in modern times that has not been
granted. Although it may be true that we may
look forward with some degree of certainty to the
probability that in the distant future we shall bo a
strong nation : whether that will be under a republic,
or under an empire, or under a kingdom, it is
impossible for us to say at the present time ; and at
the present moment it is not important what that
form of government will be. All that any country
looks forward to is to be well governed. The form
of government which they think best is the form of
government which they are entitled to have. But so
long as we have the freedom which we enjoy on this
continent, where we can make whatever laws we
think proper without interference or direction, and
so long as we enjoy such a constitution as we have,
and which is one of great elasticity, I feel perfectly
certain that we need not begin even to think of the
foundation of a republic which may exist only in the
minds of men 100 years hence. This debate has
turned, after preliminary observations, on the
important propositions contained in the resolutions
of the President. Before passing on to the two
importaut questions that have mostly occupied the
attention of the Convention up to the present, I
■would venture to make one remark, which I think it
is important should be borne in mind. When a
story is repeated with miserable iteration it often
gathers force behind it by its constant utterance, and
yet there may not be a word of truth in it. It is
well that the people of this continent, and the public
of this colony —because on this question probably
New South AVales and one or two other colonies are
most interested should clearly understand the
point to which I am about to refer, namely, whether
it is proposed in the creation of a federal constitu-
tion to grant to the federal parliament power to
divide the states, to take a portion of territory from
one of them and grant it to some other state ? Now,
does any hon. gentleman in this chamber believe
that that is contemplated ? It is not contemplated.
Nobody has ever said it publicly in any way,
and I think it is very unjust that an insinuation
should be thrown out that under one of the reso-
lutions it will be possible to do what I say
was never contemplated, and to which utterance
was never given by any hon. gentleman in the Con-
vention. This question is in the minds of many
people who are opposed altogether to the establish-
ment of federation. One of the first reasons they
give is, " Why, if New South AYales goes into this
federation, what will happen ? South Australia is
anxious to have the silver mines ; \ictoria is anxious
to go up to the Murrumbidgee; Queensland is
anxious to have some of our lovely flats." Now,
is not this a pity, when we are engaged in such an
important work, the principles of which wero con-
sidered by all the legislatures of this continent
without a syllable having been hinted on that subject,
or, if hinted, always disallowed, and without a
syllable or a hint being contained in these resolutions,
where, on the contrary, it is deliberately set out that
all the rights now possessed by the various colonies
entering the union are to be preserved, except such
as may be necessary to hand over to the federal
parliament. And to hand over in what way ? To
hand over, not generally, not using general language
that might take in a whole host of things that peoplo
did not intend ; but using language so specific that
only for the purposes of federation, and no other,
shall these lands be taken, and then only small
pieces, and with the consent of the state parliament.
AAhen we are told in this way that, our objects are
very deep and profound, but cunningly veiled and
concealed —that we desire no less than to take a large
portipn of the territory of New South AVales —I say
it is not fair, it is not just, that any gentleman should,
even by the use of language, mistakenly create the
idea that such is the intention underlying the reso-
lution, and the intention in the minds of members of
this Convention. It is well that wherever necessary
we should emphasise the fact that the idea to which
I have referred is a mistake, and that no such thing
was ever contemplated. I now come to the two
questions involved in the resolutions which have
formed the principal subject of debate. I did not
originally imagine that there would be so much
made of them. I did not think they indicated the
trouble which is in the minds of some hon. members,
and I will tell the Convention why. I understood
that the colonies represented here came together in
good faith ; that, joining together for the purpose
of doing a great and good work which they could not
do individually, they came to this Convention in the
most perfect good faith and trust, and in the belief
that there was no idea of any two or three colonies
being able to join together for tho purpose of over-
reaching them when they had become federated.
Yet there is a notion that this is the very result that
may be brought about, unless something is done to
prevent it. For the first time, we are asked de-
liberately on this continent to enter into a totally
new state of things with reference to the powers of
two houses of parliament. Under the proposed con-
stitution it is intended to create a senate and a house
of representatives. You, sir, I think, follow not
only the track —but the beaten track —w r e have ever
understood since we have been under responsible
government, that the powers of the tw r o houses of
legislature, the senate and the house of representa-
tives, should be absolutely equal in all respects but
one, and the reason of that exception is this: that
two houses cannot do all the same work. I thought
that principle was so w T ell recognised that there would
be very great difficulty indeed in raising any oppo-
sition to it, and instead of appealing to imagination
and sentiment, I desire to appeal to experience. I
desire to appeal to all the experience the Imperial
Parliament has had, and to all the experience the
people of the colonies have had on this point. But
for tho explanation which some gentlemen have
given w T ho contend for what are called state rights,
I should have imagined that state rights meant that
they must watch carefully over all powers taken away
from individual states, and granted to the federal
parliament. That is what I consider to be the pro-
tection of state rights. AVe all know what rights the
states have, and if it were proposed to hand over
certain of these state rights to the new parliament to
be created under federation, then I could understand
that the states would question every one of those
rights, and search keenly and closely to see that they
wouldbe dealt justly by —to see, in fact, that rights that
they have now the opportunity of exercising should
not be taken away, unless they and all of us were
satisfied that they were taken for federation purposes


alone, and that it was indispensably necessary, in
order to carry out our proposals in the interests of
the whole people, that those rights should be taken
away for the purpose of securing the greatest good
to the greatest number. But now we are told that
the rights of the states maybe jeopardised unless the
senate has the same power as the house of repre-
sentatives to deal with all bills with the exception of
money bills, and the only thing that has not yet been
asked for is the power of initiation. Now, I am
going to ask in a minute why it is that the power of
initiation should not be given ? But before we enter
briefly upon that question, we must bear this in mind,
that the powers that it is proposed should be given
to the federal parliament are reduced to the smallest
possible compass, with the object of not disturbing in
the slightest degree the right to legislate on all sub-
jects which has been granted to the several parliaments
throughout this continent. AVe disturb that power
as little as possible; and the range of the subjects
which the states will have to discuss and determine is
scarcely interfered with, and not interfered with in
any degree that will effect their legal rights and
interests. Keeping that in view, I should like to
know in what way the federal parliament, by con-
tinuing the practice of the English Constitution with
reference to money bills, can seriously or in any way
injure the particular states, because their represen-
tatives in the senate have not the power to amend
those bills ? There are only a very few bills, as you,
sir, and every hon. member present, must know, of
the nature and character of money bills. There is,
of course, an annual appropriation bill, which deals,
or is supposed to deal, only with the expenditure of
the year, and with nothing else. It is not expected
to deal with any new principles at all, nor with the
imposition of expenditui’e of a totally new character
of which parliament has not heard before. 7t is
simply expected to deal with the expenditure for the
year, and it is introduced year by year, and taking
the many years’ experience of the various states all
round, I may say that upon the whole they have
generally kept within the limits in regard to appro-
priation bills, and in cases where there has been
serious disturbances between the two branches of the
legislature, I undertake to say that it has been felt
that they have arisen from the absence of proper
care to keep the provisions of the appropriation bill
within the due limits of the expenditure of the year.
Both branches of the legislature in our colony and
in the other colonics feel that the interests of the
people are best promoted by harmony, not by disagree-
ment, and that brings about an anxiety that both
houses should never come to loggerheads on any
financial question at all, if it can be avoided.
Mr. Dibbs : If it can be avoided !
Mr. GILLIES: There is no difficulty in avoiding
it, as I will show in a minute or two. The imposition
of taxation and customs duties is, of course, a matter
of great importance ; but all proposals of that nature
should be dealt with in separate measures, so that
the second branch of the legislature—in this case the
senate —would not be prevented from expressing it s
most clear and deliberate opinion upon any proposal
submitted to it with reference to. direct taxation.
This subject was referred to by my hon. colleague
yesterday, and by the hon. member, Mr. Playford,
and, with great respect to the opinions of many
hon. members, I should have been glad if they had
made an effort to answer the latter hon. gentleman.
But his speech appears to have been passed over
without a word of comment, though I venture to say
that the rule which he laid down contained the
absolutely true and perfect principle that has
been followed by the House of Commons for
centuries, namely, that where you have to deal with
a great and important measure of taxation, the
question ought to be submitted in a separate bill to
the second branch of the legislature, It as much
intended by the constitution that that body should
consider questions of public policy, as that the lower
house should, because they speak for the people,
and with reference to the Legislative Council of
Victoria, they now represent a very powerful body
of electors— nearly as large a number of electors as
the Legislative Assembly represent. They are elected
on a suffrage that is really very low, with a small
qualification, and they represent a very large number
of persons. All questions of principle should be
discussed between the two houses with the most
perfect freedom. AVheu an important question of
taxation, involving some great principle is passed by
the popular branch of the legislature, it ought to go
in a separate bill to the other house, to allow the
most perfect freedom of discussion there, and to
give it the most ample power to deal with the
measure, though it could only be dealt with in the
way of acceptance or of rejection.
Mr. Bird : That is not ample power !
Mr. GILLIES: I consider that it is ample
power ; because experience has shown us that, if we
are going to discuss great questions of principle, and
to trash them out in detail, it is next to impossible
to come to an agreement without wasting a great
deal of public time, and perhaps 110 agreement at all
can be come to. But Ihere is a distinction to be
drawn. Suppose an income-tax were proposed, what
would be done is this : the principle of the income-
tax would be laid down, and then a bill to carry out
the tax would be introduced separately, setting out
the whole of the details of the proposal, and the
second branch of the legislature would not be
precluded from dealing with the principle of the
measure by rejection if it thought proper on the
question of policy, or from dealing with the matter
in every detail. In all the colonies it has been found
that where these questions have to be dealt with, it is
infinitely better not to complicate them by putting
several in the same bill, but to send them up in
separate bills. And I think the proposal which eman-
ated from the hon. member, Mr. Playford, and which
was discussed elsewhere, would remove any imaginary
difficulty that might lie in the way of the senate in
dealing with questions of this kind. One serious
difficulty, however, was raised, and I am sorry to say
that after my hon. friend, the Premier of South
Australia, explained the point to which I have
referred, he propounded this conundrum: what
would happen if two of the larger colonies or states
joined together for the purpose of what ? One hon.
member said "plundering," another said "riding
rough-shod " over the smaller states. Now, I would
ask, what is the origin of these expressions ? Does
any one mean to say that any two of the colonies
would join together for the purpose of plundering
tho other four ? I regret to think that such
an idea should enter their minds. I do not
think that any of the colonies would think of doing
such a thing; in fact, it would tend to tho
creation of a greater amount of bad blood than one
can imagine ; and unless a government had lost their
senses, and were entitled to be sent to Yarra Bend,
they would not humiliate themselves by submitting
proposals on behalf of one or two colonies, which
would be the means of riding rough-shod over other
colonies. One cannot conceive of men occupying a
distinguished position, and a house of representatives,
so lost to every notion of propriety, that they would
be prepared, merely for the sake of a little personal
aggrandisement, to adopt a course of that kind—
a course which would humiliate them in the eyes of
all decent thinking men throughout this continent
and elsewhere. I cannot conceive that; in fact, I
will not argue the matter upon that ground. I have
mentioned that there has been 110 attempt on the
part of any hon. member to seek, on behalf of the
senate, for the power of initiation. May I ask why ?
May I ask upon what principle, if the power of


amendment is to be taken as representing justice to
the states, they do not; ask for the right of initiation ?
They are to be equal in every respect. What harm
would be done by their asking for the right of initia-
tion, because the right of amendment, and even the
right of rejection, sometimes involves a great deal
more than one may think. The right of amendment
may, of course, involve your being landed straight off
in a sea of trouble, because, as the hon. member,
Mr. Playford, has pointed out, the idea of the senate
amending a customs bill, is—it goes without saying—
practically impossible. I can understand, as every
one can understand, that two legislatures, if they are
by any possibility to work harmoniously together,
must be reasonable, otherwise legislation is impos-
sible, because the second branch of the legislature
has the right to reject any bill which may be sent
from the first branch of the legislature, and the first
branch has the legally constituted right to reject any
bill which may be sent from the senate. Therefore,
unless they are willing to be reasonable, you abso-
lutely stick, in legislation; you absolutely stick, and
cannot get ahead. The real reason of the possibility
of two houses of parliament working together, is the
fact that they bring to the consideration of various
questions, not the idea of personal squabbles or per-
sonal power, but the idea that they both represent
the people, and it therefore becomes them to be
careful as to the manner in which they make pro-
posals, and as to the manner in which they amend
them. It is only by an anxious desire on their part
to do the right thing, and by the wise and discrimi-
nate exercise of the power possessed by each branch
of the legislature, that it is at all possible to get any
legislation through parliament. You, Mr. President,
know that as well as any man in this community.
I would like to know how it is that those gentlemen
who claim the right of amendment have never for a
second thought of asking for the right of initiation.
Should I tell them why ? I think that the popular
branch of the legislature not only is the necessary
house to initiate legislation with reference to money
bills, but with reference to finance generally. It is
because they are nearer the people ; they are more
truly representative of the people; and the people
look to them with more confidence, as their direct
representatives, than they would look to the best
senate you could create. I have said that the house
of representatives, the popular branch ot the legis-
lature is more in immediate contact with the people,
and we have known that to our cost. Every hon.
gentleman present has known it. Why, the popular
branch of the legislature can be dissolved. Some-
times it can be dissolved if it disagrees with minis-
ters ; sometimes it can be dissolved if it creates
some difficulties, even though they may not be of
a strong character, in the house itself. We know
of a celebrated occasion on which things came to
such a pass that a minister said to a governor that
he thought, although he had obtained large majori-
ties in Parliament from time to time, and had always
defeated his opponents, yet the state of the popular
branch of the legislature was such that there ought
to be a dissolution ; and he got a dissolution. I say
that the house of representatives is nearer the people,
and is more anxious, not only to do the right thing,
but, as we know, to conciliate the people. Parlia-
ment has often been dissolved when difficulties have
arisen through ministers not being supported, or
through difficulties having arisen with the second
branch of the legislature. The house of representa-
tives, therefore, have a closer and more intimate
relation with the people it represents than has the
second chamber with the whole of the people. I
could understand that if the senate were placed in
the same position as the popular branch of the legis-
lature they might claim the right to initiate money
bills, and to amend them too ; because if the power
of dissolution, of sending the senate to their con-
stituents from, time to time, existed, we should have
a different state of things in the country from what
we have at the present time. Not but what I
acknowledge openly that the second branch of the
legislature is, no doubt, as much governed by what
it believes to be its public duty as is the first branch
of the legislature. We all know, however, that per-
sons are naturally very strongly influenced by their
immediate surroundings, and if it is put to a body of
gentlemen representing any legislature, “You must
either pass this bill or go to your constituents, they
will unquestionably satisfy themselves whether they
are bound in the public interest, and in the interest
of their constituents, to reject the bill or go to their
constituents. I believe that if they are perfectly
satisfied that good, broad, public grounds exist for
their doing so, they will be prepared to reject it and
go to their constituents. That may not be a bad
thing. lam now, however, speaking of the powers
of the popular branch of the legislature which were
granted in reference to money bills. There are some
slight distinctions between some of the constitutions
of the various colonies \ but there are not many.
There is one, for instance, which one of the hon.
members for Tasmania and myself have been looking
into. In Tasmania the Upper House claims the
right, and they have exercised it for many years, of
amending money bills. Their contention is based
upon one thing, which is not contained cither in the
constitution of New South Wales or in that of Vic-
toria, and it is this : The present two houses w ere
formed from one house, and a provision in the Con-
stitution Act sets out that the two houses shall have
all the powers and privileges which the Legislative
Council had. Hence it is contended that, as the
Legislative Council formerly had the right both to
initiate and to amend money bills, and as the power
of initiation only has been taken away, the right of
amendment remains, and has been exercised ever
since. That is a different state of things from what
prevails elsewhere in the colonies. lam not going
to discuss it now, for it would be out of place to cast
a reflection which there is no occasion to cast, and
for doing which I do not feel that I have any justifica-
tion ; but I venture to think that if they, like V ictoria
and some of the other colonies, had a new constitu-
tion granted to them, in all probability that power
would not be retained. At any rate, after more
careful consideration, it was thought wise to place
the power not only of initiation, but also of amend-
ment when a money bill was introduced, in the hands
of the popular branch of the legislature, and - the
constitution absolutely provides, in the case of Vic-
toria, that the power of initiation shall rest with the
Legislative Assembly, and that the power of rejec-
tion, but not the power of amendment, shall rest
with the Legislative Council.
Mr. G-oedon : Hut there is no analogy between
our upper houses and the council of states !
Mr. GTLLIES: That is a great mistake. I think
there is a great analogy.
Mr Gordon: The hon. member is arguing on
wrong premises altogether!
Mr. GILLIES : I do not think that I am arguing
on wrong premises. Each of the present states has
two houses of parliament. Eor the reasons that I
have mentioned, full powers are given to the second
branch of the legislature, with the one exception that
I have mentioned.
Mr. Goedon : They both represent a homogeneous
state!
Mr. GILLIES: The Legislative Council in each
of our colonies —in Victoria —represents a homo-
geneous state as perfect as you can imagine a state
to be ; in fact, perhaps a little more perfect than the
new federal parliament that we are going to create —
at any rate, quite as perfect.
Mr. Hied : It represents a class ! .


Mr GILLIES : I have pointed out that the Legis-
lative Council of Victoria represents the whole people.
I do not know what the hon. member means by a
class.
Mr. Bum: A property class !
Mr. GILLIES : A property class! Every man in
these colonies, I am glad to say, is a propertied man.
I believe that you cannot go to any part of the world
where there is such a large proportion of the popu-
lation who have got something. You cannot go down
the street without seeing every one pretty well
dressed. Of course there are occasions in every
great city when a certain number of persons are
unable to obtain work ; but I venture to say that
every hardworking, determined, sober-minded, honest
man can throughout the greater portion of the year
get work. At any rate, one thing we can say. Of
course this is a divergence, I am sorry to say ; but,
seeing the character of the interruption, I do not
know that it is an improper divergence. If the hon.
gentleman who made the interjection thinks proper
to look over the statistics of the colonies, he will hud
that in all the colonies there are large sums of money
in the savings banks, and in the various institutions
where the people can lodge their money and get a
considerable amount of interest. Considering how
we came here—and we all came here to do the best
for ourselves —I suppose that none of us were great
plutocrats—we did not bring any mountains of gold
with us, but came here to seek for it —and taking
into account the circumstances of the colonies, the
amount of wealth accumulated in those institutions
which, to a great extent, represent the working-classes,
is something marvellous ; and to attempt to make a
distinction between what some people call the work-
ing-classes and others, I do not think can be done.
There are a few people who, through hard work, thrift,
and good opportunities, have acquired great wealth,
a fact to which I have no objection, and am sure that
everybody would like to see everybody else in a com-
fortable position ; but as to talking about the work-
ing-classes as contra-distinguished from any other
classes in the state, I venture to say that we are all
members of the working-classes —the hon. gentleman
himself is a member of the working-classes—and to
create such distinctions is quite unnecessary. I
pointed out that in Victoria the suffrage is so low
that the great body of the working-men—l mean men
who work every day with their hands, tradesmen and
others—have votes for the Legislative Council,
and the members of the council see that they
are under a great responsibility in representing such
a large constituency. I see no distinction between
the position of the two houses in a state and the
position which the two houses will occupy in
the federal parliament. Even assuming that some
of the states are very naughty, how is it practicable
for a few of those states to join together for the
purpose of plundering another state ? I am taking
for granted, as I must, that those who will be mem-
bers of that senate will be men who will not be
driven, but who will decline to be parties to the
plundering of other states, if that should be at-
tempted by bigger states. It is imagined that this
will be done unless power is given to the senate to
amend money bills. What are they to do ? The
proposal here is that each state is to return to the
senate an equal number of representatives. How
will that stand? On this continent —not speaking of
New Zealand, but including Tasmania —there will be
six states, each returning an equal number of mem-
bers. The two larger states—the two states that
will represent 2,250,000 people, will return half the
number that the other four states will return,
although not numbering one-third of their popula-
tion. What are we to say about that ? Are we to
conclude that the smaller states being represented in
the senate by double the number of members repre-
senting the larger states, will allow the larger states
to swindle the smaller ones, or are we to turn round
and suppose another thing ? Are we to assume that,
being represented in the senate by two to one, it is
possible that the smaller states would send represen-
tatives to the senate to eat up the bigger states P
Am Ito imagine that ? Ido not imagine that at all.
I believe they will go hand in hand in an honest de-
sire to serve the states on the continent within their
limits of legislation—they cannot go outside them —
and seeing that their limits would be comparatively
small, I say that it is the beginning of an injustice
to insinuate that, although the senate would perhaps
have power to do lots of mischief to the larger
states, they would think of doing it. In all legisla •
tion, whether it be general or financial, who has to
bear the brunt ? I will suppose that a particular
tax is proposed, and that after being passed by the
house of representatives it goes to the senate, the
majority of the members there representing pro-
bably, as indicated, the smaller states. Do you
mean to tell me, Mr. President, that you would bo
of opinion that the smaller states would reject a
proposal of taxation, of which they in the abstract
approved, because it affected their people ? Why,
it would affect the larger states more than it affected
the smaller ones. Who is to find the great propor-
tion of the money ? Is it not the larger states P
Does any one mean to tell me that in the house of
representatives the larger states, by their represen-
tatives, would think of imposing taxation of a char-
acter that would not be justifiable, and would not be
approved in the face of the knowledge that it would
be their own people who would pay nearly all of it ?
Three-fourths of it any way ? Surely that is not a
reasonable contention. Seeing that the distribution
of taxation would be equal in all the colonies, then
those who are in the greatest majority, of course,
must contribute the largest amount; so that you
have a perfect security that those who represent the
larger states in the house of representatives will be
no parties to fleecing their own people simply be-
cause they have a sort of idea that one of the smaller
states would not like to be subjected to this taxation
at all.
Mr. Gobdon : Have we the same guarantee as to
the expenditure of the money ?
Mr. GILLIES: I hope so. I am glad the hon.
member has reminded me of the point, as I was
going to pass it over. The federal parliament will
have the power of imposing certain taxation.
An illustration was given—an unfortunate one,
I think—by the hon. and learned members, Sir
Samuel Griffith and Mr. Barton, who both
touched the question raised by the hon. member
behind me. The one said it was quite possible that
some taxation would be proposed that would meet
with a strong opposition and disapproval of some of
the small colonies. Well, as I said, the answer to
that is that no tax which meets with any very strong
disapproval will be proposed at all, for the simple
reason that no people like to be taxed if they can
help it. It is only upon urgent necessity that a tax
will be imposed. Eor instance, as was remarked,
take a proposal to increase the federal force. I will
assume that it is sent to the senate in a separate bill.
The senate will be in a position to say whether they
think it is necessary to increase the federal force to
the extent proposed, or whether it should be increased
at all. It could reject the bill.
Mr. Abbott: Would it not be in the appropria-
tion bill?
Mr. GILLIES: Certainly not.
Mr. Abbott : That is not the case here.
Mr. GILLIES: That would be a bill containing
a distinct enunciation of a principle. I am quite
aware that sometimes increases in the forces are pro-
posed in the annual appropriation bill; but they
have first been started by bills regulating the forces.
In order that there might bo no doubt on the subject


clauses might be inserted in our Constitution Act
which would tie the hands of parliament and of min-
isters down to seeing that proposals of that charac-
ter, and all proposals containing important principles,
and creating a new departure should be sent up to
the second branch of tfie legislature in separate bills.
But take other cases: We know, Mr. President—it
is in your knowledge and in mine—that there are a
number of cases in which large expenditure is pro-
posed. For instance, some colonies have the advan-
tage of looking forward to the defence of King
George's Sound; others have the advantage of look-
ing forward to the defence of Hobart; others have
the advantage of looking forward to the defence of
Thursday Island. May I ask the representatives of
those colonies who will bear the brunt of that expen-
diture ? It will be the larger colonies. Will they
grumble P Have they said a word in all the confer-
ences we have had ? Have the larger colonies made
one solitary objection to bear their share of the
expenditure on those works, although so distant from
them? On the broad ground that it is in the interests
of the whole of the colonies that that expenditure
should be incurred, they are quite willing to contri-
bute towards the works. So when an hon. member
thinks proper to insinuate that the larger colonies
are going to do something which is unjust, I say. the
experience we have had of the conduct of all the
colonies, whether large or small, is that they are pre-
pared always to come forward, and put their hands
in their pockets without a grumble, and contribute
to anything which is acknowledged to be for the
welfare of the whole of the contineut. lam sorry,
therefore, to hear these objections raised on grounds
which, I think, are wholly insufficient. One may
have an abstract idea of the desirability of giving
new powers to the new senate; but I venture to say
that ail our experience shows that it is safer, and
more for the public interest, that all these matters
should be under the control of the popular branch of
the legislature, which has a responsibility that the
second branch has not, and never can have. I repeat
that I do not see, and I hope no hon. member will
imagine, that I am saying anything to the disparage-
ment of the senate. 1 believe it will be a very
powerful body, indeed; but to make a comparison
between it and the American Senate, is a big and
huge blunder too, and the very arguments which I
have been using show that. The parliament of the
United States is the parliament of a republic. There
is no queen to whom ministers are responsible for
every act they do. There is a president, who is
responsible to the public. There are no responsible
ministers, for the ministers are appointed by the
President, and are responsible to him. His ministers
do not go into parliament and explain the whole
position ; they do not go and submit their estimates
and defend them line by line ; and, in addition to
that, in some respects they have nothing like the
powers of the senate. The senate was specially
created, and granted special powers, some of them
plenary, for the purpose of meeting a new and untried
state of things : that is, instead of having responsible
ministers, they had ministers who were not in parlia-
ment, and were not responsible to parliament, but
were responsible to the President, who holds his
office for four years. Now, if they had responsible
ministers, who were responsible only to parliament,
I venture to say we might have had a different
state of things altogether. But a new state of things
was suddenly brought into existence, they required
to give great powers to one branch of the legislature,
at that time was very excitable. The popular branch
and they knew the popular branch of the legislature
of the legislature is sometimes very excitable all over
the world, and it is an excellent thing that there
should bo a wise and judicious senate—and I hope we
shall have that here—but it would not add to its
usefulness to give it power to amend money bills.
The great power that was given in America to the
popular branch of the legislature in dealing with
general legislation, and in initiating these bills, was at
the same time, to a great extent counteracted by the
original framers of the constitution, who feared that
they might proceed too far. The senate has worked
this out with remarkable patience, and has done
wonderfully well under all the circumstances. It
has great power over the President, and great power
over the constitution, and there is no doubt whatever
that upon the whole it has worked wonderfully well.
But I challenge anyone to say that the English Con-
stitution has not worked as well and. without a real
hitch. I challenge anyone to say that the con-
stitution of these colonies, worked by many men with
no previous experience of government, has not worked
as well as the constitution of the United States. I
venture to say it has, because we have this advantage :
that whenever any body of men, whether it be a
government or a house of representatives, attempts
to proceed too far, or behave improperly, or behave
unjustly, or not carry out, after thorough care and
inquiry, the deliberate wishes of the people, there is
a means provided in the constitution by which those
men shall be displaced, and the country represented
by the men of its choice. Again, some people may
be inclined to ask, what is the use of the second
branch of the legislature ? I say it is of great use.
Sometimes there will be a difference of opinion
between men in the popular house; and whenever it
comes, sir, to a conflict —such a conflict as a difference
of opinion between the two branches may bring
about—then I say public opinion will be able to
decide the question ; and if public opinion is found
to be reasonably evenly divided, then, of course, there
will be no chance of expecting that the second branch
will give way. But what will result ? A most
important thing will result: time will be given for
the consideration of the new question raised, and
time is a most important element in our constitution.
It cools the hot-headed, and it gives confidence to
those who believe they are right. There can be no
doubt whatever that there are occasions when the
second branches of legislatures have performed
important work in our constitutions by affording
time for further consideration. That is what you, Mr.
President, and what the Speaker of every legislative
assembly in the world does. If two parties vote
equally, the voice of Mr. Speaker is invariably given
—is bound by constitutional practice to be given—in
favour of delay. All, then, that the senate would do
—when the two houses disagreed, and when it ap-
peared that the general body of the people were not
of one mind —would be to stand firm and give an
opportunity for further consideration, and they
might, by so doing, save the nation from difficulty.
Another question —and I will touch upon it verv
briefly—is that with which you have dealt in your
resolutions, the responsibility of ministers to one
house of parliament, that being the popular branch,
it being understood that so long as they possess a
majority of votes in the popular branch of the legis-
lature they will remain in office. Now, the position
of ministers, as we all know is this : that, in many
cases, the constitution under which they exist con-
tains no provision requiring them, of necessity, to sit
in parliament. The English Constitution contains
no such provision. But, for all that, we know that
the law of parliament governs nearly everything. I
venture to say that if in England ministers did not sit
in parliament, they would not live one day longer.
It is the practice of the constitution. Although they
are not compelled under the law to make their ap-
pearance in parliament, they are all anxious to do so,
and if a minister be defeated in an election it is a
cause of great heartburning, because he is aware that
it is necessary that he should appear in parliament in
person. The English practice of carrying on public
business would be impracticable unless ministers


appeared in parliament, and ministers under the
English Constitution are responsible first to the
Sovereign, and then to parliament. No doubt par-
liament includes two branches —the House of Lords
and the House of Commons. But it is well known
that if the popular branch of the legislature, the
House of Commons, does not approve of a ministry,
it gets rid of them in no time. There is only
one redress, and it is this : that ministers may in-
duce the Sovereign to exercise the power of disso-
tion. The popular branch of the legislature being
the branch which determines the existence of minis-
tries, even if you inserted no provision on the
subject, it would be indispensable that ministers
should appear in that branch. Their political exist-
ence is dependent upon the voice of the popular
branch. Of what use, therefore, is it to shut our
eyes to the fact ? It is said that it is not well that
the existence of ministers should depend absolutely
upon the popular branch of the legislature. If hon.
members will insist upon shutting their eyes to all
the experience of the past they may make that con-
tention ; but I challenge anyone to point to a single
instance of such a thing being tolerated throughout the
whole experience of the British Constitution. It is
necessary to remember that ours is a constitution
that is not every constitution. It has not been
made up of parts of all the constitutions of the
world. It has been the growth of centuries ; it is
based upon well-known principles ; its working is well
recognised ; and he who runs may read it.
Mr. GORDON : It will not work in a federal
government!
Mr. GILLIES: I require something more than a
mere statement to that effect; I require some proof
of it. Ido not believe the hon. member could point
to one set of circumstances in which the constitution
as it is proposed to establish it —ministers being
responsible to only one house of the legislature —
would not work. What I take it, sir, that you
desire to indicate in these resolutions is that, in
view of the working of the British Constitution,
Ave ought to follow this practice. But if I am
asked Avhether it is indispensable that this par-
ticular provision should be included in our consti-
tution, I say that it is not necessary —that it is not
included in'the British Constitution, and that it is
not to be found in the majority of our own consti-
tutions. The only provision in the Victorian Con-
stitution affecting the point is this : that there must
be four ministers sitting in Parliament. Some of
these might sit in the Legislative Council, if it
Avere thought proper. But if you were to eliminate
this proposition completely, it would come to the
same thing, because ministers must depend upon the
support of the popular branch of the legislature.
If the House of Commons finds in existence, or has
thrust upon it, a ministry it does not xvant, what does
it do? It stops supply. There is only one case in
English history, so far as I am aAvare, in which a
government succeeded in remaining in office when
supply had been stopped. I refer to the well-known
Pitt Government, which remained in office to support
the king, and which subsequently appealed to the
country. But under any circumstances, if it be con-
ceded that every government will have to abide by
the Avill of the popular branch of the legislature, it
cannot live, it cannot go on with business, if that
branch be opposed to its existence. I ask the hon.
member who just noxv interrupted me, to say whether,
if the popular branch of the legislature under the
new constitution were dissatisfied Avith the govern-
ment of the day, and if an hon. member succeeded in
carrying a vote of want of confidence, the govern-
ment could live ? How could it possibly live unless
the prime minister obtained a dissolution from the
governor-general ? TIOAV long could the govern-
ment live if he failed to get that dissolution ? The
hon. member, Mr. Gordon, is going round the
subject when be says that the practice will not work
with a federal government, because we all know
perfectly well that the support of the popular branch
of the legislature is as necessary to the existence of a
government as is breath to every hon. member. One
word upon another question and 1 have finished. I
can scarcely help calling it a funny question, and it
is all the more funny because it emanates from some
gentlemen who, I am sure, have had along experience
not only in parliament, but as members of govern-
ments. They appear to think —I cannot exactly
make out why —that a government should be formed
which would be all-powerful, not only in the house
of representatives, but in the senate, and they declare
that they can devise a way by which all the states
would be so represented that they would be bound to
get fair play. I will put a case. I will assume, sir,
that you were honored by the representative of your
Sovereign in the person of our first governor-general
by being asked to form the first federal government,
and that you, with your long experience, following
out the idea hinted at the other day, thought that
you saw your way to a long political life if you could
associate with yourself gentlemen from the Parlia-
ment of Victoria. You would thus have a govern-
ment representing .New South Wales and Victoria,
and, according to the idea set forth the other day, it
would have a life extending far beyond the ordinary
span allotted to man. In fact, it would never be
known when you could bo put out of office. While
you wore supported by such an overwhelming
majority, representing two great colonies, the hopes
of the lesser colonies would expire. A suggestion
was therefore made that it would be wise to insert a
provision in the constitution that each of the colonies
should be represented in the ministry as nearly as
possible. It is remarkable to hear hon. gentlemen
put forth such a view, Surely their experience of
parliament teaches them differently. I will assume
that such a thing as has been described might
happen, and that you, sir, might form a government
of that kind. 1 look around this hall, and I
can see gentlemen who would be in opposition
instantly, whether you represented New South Wales
or not. There is my hon. friend, Mr. Dibbs. Do
vou think he would submit to such a government ?
It would be impossible. There are a number of other
hon. members of the New South Wales Parliament as
well as Mr. Dibbs who would as naturally go into
opposition as they would take their breakfasts if they
were hungry,
Mr. Dibrs : The hon. member forgets that the
proposition came from a Victorian delegate!
Mr. GILLIES: If the hon. gentleman is correct,
I deplore the want of consideration shown by a Vic-
torian delegate, because it must be self-evident to
everybody that as soon as ever a government might
be formed, no matter what it might represent, an op-
position to it would be forthcoming immediately. If
some gentlemen from Victoria were placed in the
government, will any intelligent man tell me that
there would not be a number of representatives from
Victoria who would go straight into opposition ?
That would be the case with respect to every other
colony.
Mr. Gordon : The hon. member is reckoning them
very low!
Mr. GILLIES : It is impossible to find gentlemen
who will agree upon every point. I am taking the
facts as I find them. The universal experience is that
there never has been a government in this or any
other country which has not had a very fair amount
of opposition. I do not assume that the members
of those oppositions have been dishonest or dis-
honourable. I take it for granted that men hold dif-
ferent views from many of the views held by those
in office, and, although they may have no personal
dislike to the members of the government, they feel


that it is their duty to watch the course of legislation.
You may assign whatever reason you like. It is not
for me to seek for reasons ; I take things as I find
them. If any man ignores all his past experience he is
very unwise. Past experience teaches me that as
soon as a government is in office —if it he the best
government under heaven, if an archangel were at
the head of it —there is strong opposition offered.
Therefore, I think that this great fear which, has
been expressed is a real live bogey.
Mr. Abbott : "What is the good of an opposition
if it is not strong enough? Sir John Macdonald
has been in office for thirteen years !
Mr. GILLIES : I would ask, how has he kept
office so long ? Was it his policy to pick the members
of his government from two great parties ? Not at
all. In order to remain in office for a long time he
adopted the course which has been suggested, of
taking the members of his government from the
various provinces. He did not render himself power-
ful by selecting ministers from two great factions or
colonies. He wished to convince the whole Dominion
of Canada of his fairness and discrimination by
selecting capable men from the various colonies.
Mr. GoBDOTf : Then it would be a good thing to
provide that that should be done here !
Mr. GILLIES ; Put the reason given is altogether
wrong. It was said that if two large colonies came
together the ministry would be too powerful. But I
point out that it is not at all likely. There would
bo a large amount of opposition to a ministry com-
posed in such a manner. Probably every member
from the smaller colonies would consider it such a
rank injustice that he would go into opposition at
once. Whether that would be the case or not, that
is not the principle on which we should work our
constitution. Unquestionably it will be to the interest
of whoever is called upon to form the government
in the first instance to select those gentlemen who are
best able in his judgment to do good work for the
federation and who at the same time will fairly and
truly represent the whole of this continent. If you
frame your constitution and form your ministry with
an anxious desire to do justice and give fair play to
all, without reference to the idiosyncracies of in-
dividuals, and without calculating whether or not you
will secure one or two votes, I feel perfectly satisfied
your ministry will be fairly received by both branches
of the legislature. The ministry will be bound to
give satisfaction to the popular branch of the legisla-
ture, and if they do their duty they will give satisfac-
tion to both houses.
Mr. CLARK: At one stage of this debate I felt
disinclined to take any part in it, firstly, because the
opinions I hold upon the several subjects embraced
in the resolutions had been fully and forcibly ex-
pressed by speakers who had preceded me ; secondly,
because the ground traversed by those speakers—and
over which I shall have to follow them —will have to
be travelled over again when we go into Committee
to consider the resolutions seriatim. But upon stating
this disinclination to a member of the Convention, he
suggested that it was desirable, before we went into
Committee, that every member of the Convention
should take part in this debate, so that every member
should as far as possible know the exact position oi
every other member with regard to the particular
questions on which there may be the most divergence
of opinion, so that the directions in which mutual
approaches are required, in order that a satisfactory
compromise may be effected, may be ascertained at
as early a stage as possible in our proceedings. -Act-
ing upon that suggestion, I have determined to
address the Convention to-day , and to attempt to place
before hon. members the opinions which 1 hold on
those subjects respecting which the most divergence
of opinion has up to the present time been expressed.
I hold what may be considered very strong and
decided opinions upon some of these questions at
the same time I believe there is no hon. member
more ready to meet other hon. members in com-
promise, and to give away very much that 1 value
for the sake of the principle and substance of federa-
tion. I suppose that in political as in private life we
all have our ideals ; but it is not given to any man to
realise his ideal fully, either in private or public
concerns. Ido not expect my ideals to be realised
in the federal constitution about to be framed, and I
do not think any other member expects that his ideal
will be realised. But it may be that upon exchanging
our private opinions we shall each see in the ideals
of others some very important points that never
appeared to us before, and for which we are willing
to exchange or sacrifice something which at one time
we thought essential. The hon. member, Mr. Gillies,
appears to have something like a horror of a written
constitution. He wants everything to be left to usage
and custom, and no doubt there is a great deal to be
said in favour of an elastic constitution, which goes
very much upon usage and custom. But I should
like to point out to that hon. gentleman a fact which
he may have -overlooked, but which he will at once
recognise to be a fact when I say to him that we are
inevitably committed to the adoption of a written
constitution in the matter of federation, and to one
which must, to some extent, be very rigid. "We have
had that experience already in the Australasian
colonies. We hear hon. members talk about living
under the British Constitution and working our con-
stitution upon the same lines ; but we have not the
British Constitution in these colonies. Each colony
has a written constitution, and we find on tracing
the constitutional history of these colonies that
one thing after another has been provided by law
which was not thought necessary to be inserted
in the constitutions first given to the colonies.
Eor instance, in my own colony, and in South
Australia, there is nothing said about ministers at
all, except that a civil list is provided for her Majesty,
including the judges and a few otber officers named,
such as the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General,
and the Colonial Secretary. But when we come to
the Constitution of Yictoria we find it positively
provided that there shall be four ministers —not
mentioned as officers of the civil service by name, but
simply referred to by the indefinite name of minis-
ters —in parliament. When we come to the Constitu-
tion of Queensland we find a provision that there
shall be a certain number of ministers, six, I think,
who may hold such offices and have such names as
the'Governor-General from time to time may assign to
them. We are, therefore, going more and more in
the direction of written constitutions every year that
these colonies exist; and with regard to the task now
before us we are going to take a very much larger
step than has yet been taken in the same direction.
We are here, Mr. President, to consider and report
upon an adequate scheme for a federal constitution
for the Australasian colonies, and I should like hon.
members to pause and think seriously what is meant
by the words of our commission, as I may call it —the
resolution passed at the conference in Melbourne —
under which we are appointed. A federal constitu-
tion is a totally new thing to these colonies, and I
may say a totally new thing, in the sense in which we
understand it, to the British empire, because it is
generally understood that we are not going to follow
the lines of the Canadian Dominion. I have an
aversion to overloading a speech with quotations. I
know it only tends to weary members, and to deprive
the speaker of that attention which he would like to
secure; but I have two quotations which I intend to
offer to hon. members in connection with the observa-
tions I shall make, and I shall read the first one at
this time. It consists only of a few lines from the
English author who has studied the most closely, and
written the most exhaustively. on federal government —■


Mr. E. A. Ereeman, the eminent historian of the
Norman conquest. He says with regard to federal
government in general:
That ideal in its highest and most elaborate development is
the most finished and the most artificial production of
political ingenuity. It is hardly possible that federal govern-
ment can attain its perfect form except in a highly refined
age, and among a people whose political education has
already stretched over many generations.
Now, if the task set before us is to frame a constitu-
tion, and to produce a government upon the lines
indicated in the quotation from Mr. Freeman, I think
we shall have to depart very widely from the stan-
dard which Mr. (Lillies has set up and go a great deal
in the direction which he seemed to deprecate, and
that was, to depart from the beaten track ; we shall
have to depart from the beaten track very much
indeed.
Colonel Smith : Why not P
Mr. CLARK: The hon. member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, who, I regret to see, is prevented from
attending here to-day on account of indisposition,
very properly and very wisely told us at the outset of
his speech that we had two very important things to
consider in_ connection with this matter. One was
the respective powers of the two houses, and the other
the position of the executive, and I thoroughly agree
with that gentleman, and those who followed him, in
saying that a second chamber in a federal constitu-
tion must be a very different thing from a second
chamber in a unified community. Some hon. mem-
bers seem to be led away altogether by mere names.
Because it is called a second chamber or a senate they
appear to me to be incapable of diverting their
minds from the nature and composition of the
second chambers or senates of which they have
had experience. We call that chair and that table
both pieces of furniture, and they are made of the
same _ material; but they perform very different
functions and are made for very different purposes ;
and as the chair differs from the table in the inten-
tion of its manufacturer and the use to which it is
put, although they are both articles of furniture, so
this second chamber or senate in our federal con-
stitution will be a totally different institution, and
created for different purposes and different functions
altogether, from those performed by the second
chambers in the colonies at the present time. But
before I proceed to deal definitely with the question
of the power which should be given to this second
chamber, I should like to deal first with the question
of responsible government; because, believing that
the second chamber, or senate, ought to have the
power which has been claimed for it by Sir Samuel
Griffith and other hon. members, I also believe, with
those gentlemen, that the position of the executive
demands from us the most careful consideration.
Not that I wish hon. members for one moment to
think that I would like to see embodied in the
federal constitution any distinct proposals committing
us to the American or to the Swiss system. I merely
wish to have a constitution as elastic as was asked for
by the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, so that if
it is found that responsible government, as we under-
stand it, cannot be worked under the constitution,
there may be room and opportunity left to adopt
some other system. The hon. member, Mr. Gillies,
is a very great believer in responsible government,
and, if 1 may say so., sang its praises very eulogisti-
cally in the admirable speech he delivered to the
Convention ; and he asked, as if he challenged an
answer, whether it had not worked admirably in
these colonies, and quite as well as the Constitution
of the United States. Well, I accept that challenge
at once, and I tell the hon. gentleman that in these
colonies responsible government has been at the same
time a success and a failure. As a working machine,
it has always been a success. It has been able to
move, and the legislatures which have had responsi-
ble government associated with them have always
been able to do their work. But has that work been
of the highest or the best possible type P Has not
the very existence of responsible government very
often lowered the character and quality of legisla-
tion ? I do not think there is an hon. member in
this chamber who has had experience of it who will
deny that such has been the case; and if it could be
possible for us to devise a system which would give
us legislation of a higher and better character, free
from the blemishes and blotches which responsible
government has forced upon the legislation of the
colonies in the past, I think we all ought to rejoice
to try such a system. Not that lam prepared to
su gg es f an y one, cut and dried, at the present
moment; but when we hear the praises of a certain
system sung in the way in which they have been
sung in this Convention, I think it only right that
those who hold a different opinion, and who have
formed their opinion from personal experience,
should speak out and express their convictions upon
the matter. If I wish to quote authorities upon the
disadvantages and defects of responsible government,
I could go to very competent observers, and on the
maxim that “Onlookers often see most of the game,”
I might think that it would be a trump card to quote
the opinions of American and English authors who
have watched the working of responsible govern-
ment in these colonies; but I will refrain from
doing so, and will only quote the opinion of a
colonial statesman. The quotation which I am
now about to inflict upon hon. members is the
second and only other quotation which I shall make
in the course of my remarks. The hon. member, Mr.
Heakin, spoke very highly of Chief Justice Higin-
botham, both as a statesman and as a lawyer, and I
think that I yield nothing to the hon. member in my
admiration for the character, ability, and patriotism
of that gentleman. It was my extreme pleasure,
some years ago, to hear him deliver a speech in the
Legislative Assembly of Victoria, and that speech was
so full ol high thought and eloquence that it impressed
itself permanently on my mind, and whenever this
question of responsible government crops up I think
immediately of a passage in it, with which I am so
familiar that I can always go at once to Hansard and
pick it out. It reads as follows;
I do not know whether hon. members have observed it; but
it ought to be observed, that there are many persons now in
this country who have even begun to question the foundations
of our constitution—to ask, “ What is the use of responsible
government; what good can possibly come out of this House?”
These feelings of distrust and disapproval are, if I do not mis-
take, almost entirely occasioned and generated by the
accursed system under which the party on this side of the
House are always striving to murder the reputations of the
party on the other side, in order to leap over the dead bodies
of their reputations on to the seats in the Treasury bench.
I think that that description is as applicable to every
legislature in the Australian colonies now, as it
appeared to Chief Justice Higinbotham to be appli-
cable to the legislature of Victoria at the time at
which he spoke.
Mr. Deakik : What about the language of parties
in America?
r Mr- CLARK: If the hon. gentleman wishes me to
diverge at this moment, I will answer him, and say
that party government is just as strong in America
as it is in the Australian colonies, or in England.
Mr. Deakih : Without responsible government!
Mr. CLARK: But it cannot upset the ministry
for the time-being simply for the purpose of upsetting
them and getting their places, and for no other
reason whatever.
Mr. Gillies : Perhaps they ought to be upset,
but cannot be !
Mr. CLARK : In connection with this question
of responsible government, it appears to be the opinion
of a number of the members of the Convention that
some provision ought to be put in the constitution to


the effect that the portfolios should be equally dis-
tributed among the different colonies. I know that
the hon. member, Mr. Gfillies, deprecates such a
distribution ; but other hon. members appear to think
very strongly upon the point, and if their wishes
should prevail, 1 can only say that the problem of
working the system of responsible government under
the federation would be made yet more conflicting
and difficult than it would otherwise be. We must
always remember that the system has undergone new
developments in this country, differing from any
which it has undergone in the mother country. The
questions considered crucial, and on which ministries
go out of office here, are not the questions upon
which they go out of office in England; and the
questions on which ministries would go out of office in
England are not considered of sufficient importance
in these colonies to cause a change. But the question
of responsible government in connection with our
federal constitution only becomes of chief import-
ance to us in connection with the question of the
distribution of powers between the two branches of
the legislature ; and I shall now proceed to deal with
the question of the relation of the two branches of
the legislature in the proposed new constitution, more
particularly with the question of what power or what
rights and privileges shall be given to the second cham-
ber, which has been spoken of sometimes as a senate
and sometimes as a states house. I agree altogether
with the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, and a
number of other speakers who have preceded me, that
the senate or states house ought to have what the
hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, has very properly
and concisely styled the power of veto in detail with
regard to money bills, but not the power of initiation.
I think, perhaps, it would be a convenient course, at
the very outset of my argument on this branch of
the subject, to reply to the challenge thrown out by
the hon. member, Mr. Gillies, when he asks, " Why
not also claim for it the power of initiation ? " Well,
I would tell him why I think we may very well
claim the power of veto in detail, and yet not claim
the right of initiation. In the course of the debate
it has been said that government is finance, and
finance is government. I do not altogether agree
with that maxim, but there is a large amount of truth
in it, and I agree with it so far as to admit at once
that deadlocks with regard to finance are more
serious and more injurious than deadlocks with
regard to any other subject. We can easily see
that if both houses have the power of initiating
money bills, we might have two adverse financial
policies before the country at the same time, and
each house would be prejudiced in favour of its own,
and there would be a more serious kind of deadlock
than any that has yet occurred with regard to money
matters in any colony or any country with which I
have any acquaintance, either personally or by
reading. It is quite probable—in fact I believe it
has occurred in past times —that two different bills
dealing with the same subject may be introduced in
two different branches of the same legislature. But
they have not produced the serious deadlocks and
the injurious consequences which would be produced
by the initiation of two adverse financial policies ;
and for that reason alone I think initiation ought to
be confined to the one house, and I flatter myself
that that is a very good and sufficient answer to the
objection of the hon. member, Mr. Gillies. In
dealing with finance we are dealing with what is
admitted to be a very special and what is commonly
called a very peculiar question. Deadlocks or
adverse policies with regard to finance would produce
more embarrassing conditions than adverse policies
with regard to any other subject. As a matter of
fact, the House of Lords is not deprived by law of
the right to initiate money bills; and, if I remember
rightly, it did once attempt to initiate a tax in the
shape of a paper duty. Of course, when the bill
came to the House of Commons it became a dead
thing; I believe it was laid beneath the table. Still,
there was a positive assertion of a legal right to
initiate a money bill, and it is only bv custom that
that power has fallen into disuse. But it is not so
much that the House of Lords, out of any considera-
tion to the smooth working of the government, or
from motives of public policy, has resigned that
right. It comes about in this manner: that we
have responsible government and the unity of the
cabinet in connection with the British Constitution,
and no tax can be proposed except by message from
the Crown. And the cabinet, being united and
working together, of course it could only propose to
tax in one house or the other. Therefore, even if
the House of Lords did have the right of initiating
taxation, it would not produce any ill consequences
whilst you have responsible government, and the
cabinet is working in unity, with the condition that
no tax can be imposed except by message from the
Crown. If every proposal to impose a tax must
come from the cabinet, it becomes a mere matter of
detail or of .expediency whether it should be
introduced into one house or the other. But when
we come to America, where they have no respon-
sible _ government, and the cabinet does not propose
taxation, then it becomes necessary to confine-
the right of initiation in the constitution to one
branch of the legislature; and we ought, on the
same lines, to confine the right of initiation to one
branch of the legislature, although we may commence
with responsible government, because the time may
come when we may change our system. Ido not say
that that time ever will come, but it may come, and if,
in the future, we should cease to have responsible
government, and to act on the rule of every tax being
proposed by message from the Crown, it would be
very awkward indeed for both branches of the
legislature to have the right of initiation. Those who
believe in giving to the senate or states house the
right of vetoing money bills in detail, are also in
favour of giving each state an equal representation
in that branch of the legislature; and the strongest
argument I have yet heard against the double
proposal to give the colonies equal representation
ill that house, and to give it the power of veto
in detail in regard to finance has come from
the hon. members, Mr. Munro and Mr. Wrixon,
who both said that it would lead to the minority
ruling the majority. Now, both these gentle-
men seem to think that the British Constitution
in particular, and representative government in
general, is founded on the principle of an absolute
rule of the majority. I take leave to flatly contradict
that statement. Neither the representative govern-
ment in general nor the British Constitution in
particular is built on the system of the absolute rule
of the majority. There are men, both political
writers and statesmen, who have advocated that
principle, and who have argued for equal and single
electoral districts in support of that doctrine. But
single and equal electoral districts have never yet
been adopted in England, and have not been adopted,
so far as I know, in any of the Australian colonies.
The electoral districts remain at the present time,
both in the Australian colonies and in England, very
unequal in numbers, and as to the amount of repre-
sentation assigned to them; and the consequence is
that many important measures are decided in the
House of Commons, and are decided in everv colonial
legislature, by a majority in that legislature who were
returned by, and who represent, an absolute minority
of'electors. This may seem a very startling state-
ment, but Mr. Eawcett, who has taken a great
interest in this question, and who has very strenuously
advocated the adoption of the system known as
Hare's for the purpose of remedying it, has made
some very instructive and curious analyses of impor-
tant facts in reference to the matter/ And he did


not go back to the old days before the Eeform Bill of
1832 ; but he took the House of Commons in 18G8,
after several reform bills had been passed greatly
extending the franchise, and endeavouring to attain
to approximate equal representation as far as condi-
tions would allow; and yet, after those wide-search-
ing reforms, he found that te nsuccessful candidates
at the general election —I think it was of 1868—
only polled 1,873 votes, whilst ten unsuccessful candi-
dates polled 83,217 votes. In two most important
measures —one the Trades Unions Bill, and the other
the Contagious Diseases Act —two important clauses
were passed by a majority of members who repre-
sented only 287,000 electors, whilst the minority in
that division represented 677,000. The absolute rule
of the majority has never yet been accepted as the
principle of the British Constitution, nor is it the
principle of representative government. Eepresenta-
tive government is not an expedient or a makeshift
to obviate the necessity of having every man brought
into one chamber to give his vote; but it is a sub-
stantial institution devised for the special purpose of
endeavouring, so far as possible, to get the intelligence
and the judgment of the community to decide what
shall, and what shall not, be law, and not simply to
count mere heads. Of course it is presumed, and very
naturally, that there will be more intelligence and judg-
ment in the majority than in the minority. But it is
not always the case, and while we presume that the
majority will have a preponderance of intelligence
and judgment among them, we always have to
remember that, for the time-being, with regard to
any measure, they may not have the preponderance
of judgment and intelligence, and we must always
give the minority an opportunity to prove that it is
right and to become the majority. In fact, we must
always challenge the majority for the time-being to
legitimatise itself, and prove that it has the pre-
ponderance of judgment and reason and intelligence
on its side. That is the object of all representative
institutions ; and therefore it is no argument to say
that the proposal to give equal representation and
veto in detail to the senate must occasionally give
the minoriry the power of preventing any measure
from being passed. That happens every day, and
will happen under all representative systems, even
if you have equal electoral districts. The French-
men are supposed to be more in love with theory
and with political symmetry than Englishmen are,
and in their endeavour to establish the absolute rule
of the majority they have decided that if three or
four candidates stand for an electoral district in
France, and the one at the top of the poll does not
get an absolute majority of all the electors polled,
the two or three candidates who obtained the largest
number of votes shall go to the poll again. I under-
take to say that if you proposed to have such a
provision in our constitution, the very first men to
denounce it as theoretical, visionary, and un-English,
would be the members of this Convention who have
denounced the proposal of equal representation in
the senate. They are not prepared to go the whole
length of the principle they advocate, and boldly
to attempt to establish the absolute rule of the
majority. Even in the election of the President of
America the principle of the absolute rule of the
majority is not exercised. Every man has not an
equal right to vote for the President of the United
States. The mass of the electors only elect a certain
number of electors in every state, and those electors
are selected on exactly the same principle as the
congressional delegation; that is to say, each state
elects as many electors as it has members of
Congress, including both branches; and the conse-
quence is that repeatedly the President of the
United States has been elected by an absolute
minority of the people of that country. The
gentleman who at present holds the position was
elected by an absolute minority. Mr. Cleveland
received an absolute majority of primary votes. The
Americans submit to that state of things, and never
indulge in a revolution to upset it. With all their
love of democracy and republicanism, they have
never yet committed themselves to that wide and
uncertain sea of the absolute rule of the majority,
but they have adhered to the definite principle of
representative government and constitutional system,
and they abide by it even when the minority for the
time carry the point at issue. But it has been said
that the great objection to giving the senate the
powers that some of us would claim for it, and
giving equal representation, is that it would not so
directly represent the people. The hon. member,
Mr. Deakin, seemed to me to be prepared to give it
the power which we claim for it if, in his own
language, it could be said " to represent the reason
and manhood of the respective colonies." lam
quite prepared to accept any suggestion for the
election of the senate which will produce that result.
That is all that any of us want, and if the hon.
member, Mr. Deakin, or any other hon. member,
can show us that by direct election by the people
the senators would more directly represent the
manhood and judgment of the states, I, for
one, should be very pleased indeed to give my ad-
herence to a proposal of that kind. How, it is said
that if the senate or states house has co-ordinate
power given to it with the other branch of the legis-
lature, or, to be more particular, if it really has the
power of veto in detail given to it in regard to
finance, it will soon become the more powerful houso
of the two, and the other house will deteriorate ;
and the example of the House of Eepresentatives in
America has been quoted in support of that state-
ment. I quite admit that the Senate of the United
States has always commanded the attention of the
world more than has the House of Eepresentatives,
and that the majority of the great intellects who
have appeared in the political arena of America
have during the greater part of their careers exerted
their influence and performed their work in that
particular branch of the legislature. But it is too
sweeping an assertion to say that on account of the
power which that Senate possesses the other house
has deteriorated. If it has deteriorated at all, it has
done so for a variety of reasons. Amongst the
reasons which have been given for it, is the shortness
of its term compared with the length of the term of
the Senate, and that, I believe, has been a very
powerful factor in making able and prominent men
desire to have a seat in the Senate rather than in the
House of Eepresentatives. But I take up the chal-
lenge boldly, that that house is the inferior chamber
that some writers and some speakers have described
it to be. "We know that the Speaker of that house
is possibly the most powerful personage in Congress,
and that he has rapidly been acquiring powers and
a position more like those of the Premier of England
than any other man in the American Government.
The chairmen of the various committees in that
branch of the legislature are also very powerful per-
sonages, and, I believe, exercise as much, if not more,
influence in the legislature of the country than does
any private member of the Senate. And there is
this very important fact, which we cannot overlook,
namely, that the majority of the great men of
America who are now known to the world in connec-
tion with American history, and who helped to make
America what it is to-day, have been members of that
branch of the legislature at one time or other of their
career. The names of the matchless Chief Justice
Marshall, and Clay, Calhoun, Webster, Garfield, and
Lincoln all occur to me as those of men who com-
menced their career in that branch of the legislature
and who adorned it while they were in it, and some
of them never left it, except, as in the case of
Garfield, when he left it to be President of the United
States. And we have the brilliant instance of John


Quincy Adams, who, after serving his country as its
ambassador at various courts, in Europe, and as
senator and as president of the l'epublic, surpassed
all his former career, and gave himself an immortal
name by seventeen years' service in the House of
Representatives, towards the close of his career. A
house that could attract John Quincy Adams at that
time of his life, and also the other men I have men-
tioned, is not the inferior and deteriorated house that
some hon. members imagine, and which some writers
have declared it to be. Some hon. members seem to
think that fiscal or financial questions are the only
ones which could occasion a deadlock, or the only
ones with regard to which the public mind may be-
come very much agitated if there should be a differ-
ence of opinion between the two branches of the
legislature. I admit that in the past taxation has
been the subject on which the public mind has been
most agitated with regard to differences of opinion
between the two houses, and it has been the ques-
tion which has most affected the rights and
privileges of individual citizens. But I believe
the world has passed through that stage when
taxation will be the most important subject to bo
discussed. It will certainly always be a very im-
portant one. But we know that new political prob-
lems will arise in the evolution of society, and I
believe the time is fast approaching when what are
known as social questions will create more difference
of opinion and more agitation in the public mind
than taxation has ever done in the past. We know
that next to the right of an Englishman to be taxed
only with his ow 7 n consent, and by the vote of his
own representatives, he has always valued the right
of freedom of contract. But we know that the great
principle of freedom of contract is now being chal-
lenged, and probably we shall see legislation in the
future which will very much interfere with it, and,
when that time comes, in all probability we shall see
as much agitation in the public mind, as much ex-
citement, as much division of opinion between various
classes of society on that fundamental principle, as
tve ever satv on the question of taxation. Yet all the
second chambers in the colonies at the present time,
and the House of Lords, have power to veto in detail
or in fflobo bills dealing with that important principle,
and with other questions which will probably have to
be dealt Avith in the future. It is no use raising
ghosts of the past to frighten us in regard to the
future. I think questions of taxation Avill never be
questions of agitation, or cause the same reA r olutions
in the future as they have in the past, I believe we
have outgrown that stage of political development.
The American Constitution has been pointed to as
having Avorked for 100 years very satisfactorily AA T ith
this power of vetoing in detail all financial questions
vested in the senate. Some hon. members have said,
" Oh, they have had friction and disagreements there ;
they haA T e had secessions"; but curiously enough,
broadly speaking, the disagreements have not been on
financial questions. A book was written some years
ago by a gentleman Avho A r isited these colonies, and
Avhom several hon. members, no doubt, have had the
pleasure of meeting —I allude to Mr. Moncure Con-
Avay —upon the working of the American Constitution.
He called the book "Republican Superstitions." He
Avas a great advocate of government by one chamber,
and I may say he ransacked American history to see
Avhere the constitution of two chambers had Avorked
badly; but in all his indictments against the American
Senate, and in all the instances where he referred to
deadlocks, he does not produce one financial question;
they are all questions of slavery, of organisation of
territories, and such like. Undoubtedly that consti-
tution has received magnificent eulogies at various
times from Avriters and public men in England and in
these colonies. "VYe knoAv the eulogy passed upon it
by Mr. Gladstone, and Ave know that the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. Deakin, the other day spoke of it as " that
superb constitution." But it has had one tribute paid
to its excellence, one eulogy passed upon it beyond any-
thing that the tongue of man can ever give to it, and
possibly beyond anything Avhich any other constitu-
tion ever had or ever will haA r e given to it. The
eleven states Avho, in 1861, seceded from the Union
because they could not get AA T hat they regarded as
their rights under it, because they said it had become
tyrannical and oppressive, and had been sAverved from
its original intention, re-enacted it almost word for
Avord for themselves to live under, including this
poAver of veto in detail in financial matters. Where
do you find such a tribute paid to any other constitu-
tion in the world as that the men Avho seceded from
it, after asking to be delivered from its shadoAv,
re-enacted it verbatim et literatim _to live under ?
I now proceed to deal Avith the question of state
interests. I prefer that phrase Avhich the hon.
member, Mr. Barton, suggested to us in preference to
the phrase state rights; because I think the phrase
" state rights " ha.s occasioned a good deal of misap-
prehension in the minds of some persons, particu-
larly in the mind of my hon. friend, Mr. Gillies, who
seemed to think that the danger, Avhich seemed to us
so great on this question, amounted to a threat of
what he called " plunder." I never had any dread
of anything which Ave could call the plunder by one
state of another. But I can very clearly see that
state interests may be endangered; that certain
states may unjustly suffer by the legislation of the
federal government, if they are not equally repre-
sented in the senate, and if each state has not co-
ordinate power with the others to veto any measure
Avhich may injuriously affect it. The hon. member,
Mr. Deakin, asked, as if he challenged an ansAver,
with full confidence that one could not be given,
Avhat powers given to the federal government, either in
the American Constitution or in the Canadian Con-
stitution, could possibly create any danger to state
interests ? I accept the challenge, and will tell him
at once that there is one very important power
giA'en to the central governmentinboth those constitu-
tions, which may at any time endanger state inter-
ests ; and that is, the power to regulate commerce.
It has frequently in America caused legislation,
which, in the judgment of many of the states, has
injured their interests. New Jersey in particular
has been in the supreme court twice on the matter ;
but she has been defeated there. That is the answer
to the statement of the hon. member, Mr. Deakin,
that Ave should put our state interests under the
protection of the federal constitution and the federal
courts. There are some injuries for which there is
no judicial remedy; the remedy is only political, and
that has been recognised by all the Avriters on the
American Constitution. Mr. Justice Story, whose
commentaries Avere quoted here a few days ago
by the hon. member, Mr. Barton, and who was
reckoned one of the greatest Avriters on American
laiv, has left on record his deliberate opinion, and as
a matter of legal argument has placed it beyond
all doubt, that the whole protective system of
America is unconstitutional and is an injury to several
of the states; but he admits that there is no judicial
remedy for the injury, that the remedy is only poli-
tical, and can only be had at the polls, and that if
the electors do not choose to remedy the injury, it
must be submitted to as the inevitable. We knoxv that
South Carolina attempted to secede from the Union
thirty years before the civil war on that very ground.
She said that the protective tariff was aimed at her
products and her industries, and w r ould be especially
injurious to her; and since the civil Avar legislation
under the right to regulate commerce has injuriously
affected several states, which have gone to the
supreme court and found that there is no judicial
remedy, notwithstanding the presence in the con-
stitution of a direct provision apparently inserted for
their special protection. There is a clause in the


American Constitution which positively prohibits
any tax or impost on exports. Now, there are several
states that raise principally tobacco, and they cannot
tind a market for all they raise within the states
themselves: they must export. It would ho indirect
violation of the constitution to impose an excise
duty on tobacco. We can easily see that if that
were allowed these states would suffer a special
wrong. Yet it has been done by indirect means.
They have actually imposed a stamp duty on bales of
tobacco, and they will not allow a bale of tobacco to
leave the factories until the stamp duty has been
affixed. Two cases have been before the supreme
court for the purpose of testing the validity of the
tax under the fundamental provision of the
constitution, that there shall be no duty on ex-
ports ; but the act has been so framed, so cunningly
devised, that the courts have decided that it does not
come within that prohibition, and the tax remains.
The states which raise tobacco feel the injury ; yet
there is under the constitution no judicial, but only
a political, remedy for it. The island of Mauritius
obtains most of its revenue from an export duty upon
sugar. Ido not know whether it is intended to
insert in our federal constitution a provision similar
to that in the American Constitution, and to prohibit
the federal government from taxing exports ; but if
we do not do so, might not the imposition of an
export duty upon sugar seriously affect Queensland
and yet leave her without any judicial remedy; but
let us not trust to judicial remedies. Let us embody
distinct remedies for injured state interests in our
constitution; let us give to every state the power
to protect itself. Self-protection is better than
protection by another.
Mr. Playford : They do not do so in America !
Mr. CLAEK: You cannot obtain perfection in
everything, and there are some things for which the
only remedy is a political remedy—a remedy at the
polls, as Mr. Justice Story says. You must go there
and fight it out. With regard to the Canadian
Constitution, there is another section under which
federal legislation might seriously affect the different
colonies—l refer to the right of the federal govern-
ment to deal with the fisheries; and it i 3 quite
conceivable that if the federal government here, as in
Canada, had power to deal with the fisheries, it
might take steps which would very seriously affect
the various Australian colonies. My friend, Air.
Wrixon, said something about the desirableness of a
uniform criminal law, and while he was speaking I
expressed the opinion that we should not have a
uniform criminal law. The hon. member invited me,
I understood, to give some reasons why we should
not have it. I have placed my note upon criminal
law under the head of state interests, because I
believe it comes under that head. It might be
desirable in some colonies or in some states, to make
certain things crimes which it would not be desirable
to make crimes in other states. We know that in
the American Union the eastern states are highly
civilised, refined communities, advanced in physical,
intellectual, and artistic culture; while, on the other
hand, the western states, or the backwoods, as they
are called, are in a very different position, politically,
socially, and intellectually. It might be necessary in
some of the states to pass stringent laws making
certain things crimes which would not be so dealt
with in other states. Besides, we know that the
law is often used as a means of effecting indirectly
some ulterior purpose, also for the purposes of
class or special interests. The game laws of England
occupied in former years, and occupy now to a
certain extent, a foremost place in the provisions
of British criminal legislation. We know what
detestable and abominable laws they were, and
we know that they were introduced, not for the
protection of life and property and individual liberty
in the ordinary sense—not for the same purpose as
that for which you make murder or forgery a crime
—but for the conservation, of certain class interests
and class privileges. In America, in the days of
slavery, it was made a capital felony in some states
to teach a negro to read or write; and even at the
present day, when slavery has been long abolished,
the marriage of black people with while people in
some states is made criminal. Men who have choseu
to marry a mulatto or a quadroon have stood in the
criminal’s box and have been sentenced as common
criminals. Now, there was a time when the slave
power w T as so strong in America that it appeared to
be about to transform the whole union into
its own hideous form and likeness, and, if
the attempt had succeeded, it Would have been
a most lamentable state of things to have the laws
which would have been then enacted inforce throughout
the whole of the Union —in Massachusetts, in the
home of the pilgrims, as well as in Louisiana. We
do not want to run that risk. Do not let us, there-
fore, have a uniform criminal law, but let each state
have its own law. I will proceed now to the ques-
tion of the judiciary. The resolution as it stands
provides for only a court of appeal. I hope that
when we get into Committee an amendment will bo
moved establishing a system of federal courts inde-
pendently of, and in addition to, the state courts,
I think we are irrevocably committed to that, if we
are going to have a federation in the true sense of
the word, and not unification—in other words, if we
are about to adopt the principles of the American,
and not those of the Canadian Constitution. In
Canada they have only one system. Canada is what
may practically be called a unified community ; in
fact, so unified is their judicial system, that the state
governments cannot even appoint ordinary justices
of the peace. Justices of the peace throughout the
land have to be appointed by the central govern-
ment. The county court, as well as the superior
judges, are also appointed from that source, and hon.
members can imagine w T hat an immense amount of
patronage that must give to the central government*
Mr. Gillies referred this morning to the long period
of office which had been enjoyed by Sir John Mac-
donald, and the hon. member seemed to think that it
was due to that gentleman’s tact and to the states-
manship he evinced in the distribution of ministerial
portfolios. When we know that he has the power
of nominating every member of the senate, and
every lieutenant-governor, and of appointing superior
and inferior judges and justices of the peace, as well
as the power of vetoing all local legislation, his long
term of office is easily accounted for. With such
reins in his hands he might be expected to remain iu
the saddle an indefinite time. We do not want to
place it in the power of the prime minister of our
dominion to exercise patronage to that extent.
What we ■want is a separate federal judiciary, allow-
ing the state judiciaries to remain under their own
governments. If you have your various governments
moving in their respective orbits, each must bo com-
plete, each must have its independence. You must
have an independent legislature, an independent
executive, and an independent judiciary, and you can
have only a mutilated government if you deprive it
of any one of these branches. I therefore hope to
see a complete system of federal courts, distinct
from the provincial courts. I will not enter fully
into the question .How. I could give many other
reasons why we should have a double system, and
could mention many benefits which would flow from
it. I content myself now by saying that I hope that
in addition to a separate federal system of courts Ave
shall have a court of appeal, as the resolution con-
templates. That will be an innoA'ation, and a Avhole-
some innovation, upon the American system. The
American Supreme Court cannot hear appeals from
the supreme courts of the various states except in
matters of federal law'. I hope our Supreme Court


will take the place of the Privy Council, and hear
appeals upon all questions of law. I now come to
the question as to whether the decision of that court
of appeal ought to be final or not. I unhesitatingly
say that, so far as the cases which come before that
court are purely Australian, the judgment ought to
be final; but if a case comes before it affecting
imperial interests, or depending upon the interpre-
tation of an imperial statute in force throughout
the whole empire, it would be absurd to talk about
taking away the right of appeal to the Privy Council.
If the British legislature does what it has the power
to do, and what it has done—that is, if it passes
a law for the whole empire, such as the British
Merchant Shipping Act or the Plimsoll Act—it
would never listen to a proposal to take away from
its own court the right of interpreting its own acts.
That, I think, is perfectly clear. This reminds
me that when hon. members talk of breaking our
connection with the mother country, or of cutting
the first strand of the painter in a proposal to
erect a federal judiciary, they have, it seems to
me, a very hazy and imperfect notion as to what
our relations to the mother country really are.
Our real relation to her as dependencies does not
depend upon our recognition of the Crown, or
upon our appealing to the Privy Council. The
great and mighty fact with regard to our position
in relation to the mother country is that our
legislative bodies are subordinate to the British
Parliament, with their laws liable to be overruled
by that Parliament. That is the position in which
we shall remain while we are only a subordinate
legislature—almost as subordinate to the British
Government as municipalities are subordinate to the
legislature which creates them. It is that which
makes us practically a dependency, whether or not
there is an appeal to the Privy Council, and whether
or not the name of the Queen is used in our acts of
Parliament. That is really the essence of the
position which we hold as part of the British
empire. It has been said that in addition to the
cases which involve imperial interests, and the inter-
pretation of imperial statutes, it may be desirable to
have cases sent to the British Privy Council which
embody fundamental principles of the common law.
"When I heard that statement I was reminded of an
article in the December number of the Contemporary
Review, by one of the most learned and scientific
lawyers and legal writers of the present day—Sir
Erederick Pollock. He is so dissatisfied with the
system of teaching law in England, that he says if
it is not very soon altered, the centre of the legal
system of the Anglo-Saxon race will drift from the
eastern to the western shore of the Atlantic, and that
the colonies will look- to the decisions of the Supreme
Court of the United States for decisions on funda-
mental principles of the common law. The American
courts administer the same principles of common
law that the English courts do, and so far from its
being a disadvantage to have two independent centres
of interpreters, it has been a benefit, and the common
law of England has thus been enriched. The Privy
Council and House of Lords have frequently quoted
with respect, and have acknowledged the benefit of,
the decisions of the august tribunal on the other side
of the Atlantic. There is no reason why our supreme
Gourt of appeal may not produce the same beneficent
results, and enrich the stock of the common law of
the empire by being an independent centre of inter-
pretation. The hon. member, Mr. "Wrixon, seemed
to think there might be an objection to making it a
final court of appeal, because, he said, in Victoria
they have six judges who are amongst the ablest
lawyers at the bar, and that it might be difficult to
get a tribunal which would command more respect
for its judgments than was felt for the decisions of
the Supreme Court in that colony. Ido not pretend
to speak for the colony of Victoria, or any other
colony, particularly; I speak generally ; but I think
the lion, member, Mr. Wrixon, will admit that we do
not always get the six, or even the three, ablest
lawyers in the community upon the bench of a
colony. You get poor judges just as you get poor
politicians.
Colonel Smith ; That is not the case now.
Mr. CLARK: It has been the case in times past,
and it has been the case in other colonies. We must
speak the whole truth and our whole conviction. I
do not know whether those six able judges always sit
together, or whether important questions are not often
decided by three or four of the judges. Therefore,
the argument as to six of the ablest lawyers coin-
ciding in a case would have a very infrequent appli-
cation. But what is the tribunal to •which we appeal
now, and which thehon. member, Mr. Wrixon, would
retain ? The Privy Council is a tribunal supposed
to consist of fifteen judges, three forming a quorum.
In one most important case that went from Queens-
land only three judges constituted the court; and
without any disrespect to them, but simply in the
interests of truth, I say that probably those three
judges were the weakest men of the -whole fifteen.
Two of them are now dead, and I may give their
names without offence. The court consisted of Sir
Barnes Peacock, Sir Montagu Smith, and Sir Robert
Collier, when the important case of Davenport versus
the Queen was decided by the Privy Council. If
the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, were here, he
could tell us more about the case. He argued the
case in his own colony, and carried the court there
with him. That judgment of the court was reversed
by the Privy Council, and I know that up to the present
time Sir Samuel Griffith, and all the lawyers of
Queensland, believe that their own court was right,
and the Privy Council wrong; and the hon. member,
Sir Samuel Griffith, believes that if he had had an op-
portunity of going home to the Privy Council he
would have induced the judges to look at the case in
another light. That is the disadvantage of having a
distant court of appeal. It is always inconvenient to
send counsel so great a distance. My hon. friend,
Mr. Wrixon, will not dispute the wisdom of sending
counsel home from the colonies to place our cases
fully before the Privy Council, because last year he
saw that it was absolutely necessary to do so in the
interests of his own colony, as our government also
did in a case in which they were concerned. I know
that Sir Samuel Griffith holds the same opinion, and
that he regards the decision in the case I have quoted
as a proof of the desirability of colonial cases being
argued before the Privy Council by colonial lawyers.
Mr. Dibbs : Yet the three judges to whom the
hon. member has referred have given very good
decisions on colonial questions !
Mr. CLARK: That may be; but we are here to
speak the whole truth; and I maintain .that those
three judges were the weakest of the team. The
hon. member, Mr. Wrixon, seemed to think that in
the Privy Council we had a court for the whole
empire which gave uniformity of decisions. There,
again, he was a little forgetful. The Privy Council
is not the court of appeal for the whole empire. The
House of Lords is the court of appeal for a large
portion of the empire ; so that there are two separate,
co-equal, and independent courts which are not
bound by each other’s decisions. The House of
Lords subsequently refused to follow the judgment
of the Privy Council in the case of Davenport versus
the Queen. Therefore, at the present time, we have
conflicting decisions by two independent and co-equal
courts in England. If we have under our federal
government a court of appeal whose decisions shall
be final with regard to Australian matters, we shall
not be troubled by having conflicting decisions ; we
shall not have one lawyer quoting a decision by the
House of Lords to a colonial court as one it ought to
follow, and a lawyer on the other side quoting a


different decision by the Privy Council as one which
ought to be accepted. I think that I have dealt
with every subject that I intended to speak upon
except the one question of the power of the Queen
to disallow federal legislation, which was referred to
by the hon. member, Mr. Playford. I have almost
anticipated my remarks on that head by pointing out
that we shall be a subordinate legislature, and that
the subordinate position which we hold is really the
thing that decides our place in the empire. If the
power of disallowance be taken away, the link between
us and the Crown formed by the governor-general
will certainly be a cobweb. AYe shall be, to all
intents and purposes, an independent nation. I may
sympathise with the hon. member, Mr. Dibbs, in
looking forward to that as the ultimate goal for
these colonies ; but we have not met here to carry
out that object, and I do not think it would be
wise for any of us to attempt to hurry it. If it is
for the benefit of these colonies it will come in good
time.
Mr. Dibbs : May we not indulge in a poet’s
dream ?
Mr. CLARK: We may; but as one not at all
hurt by the sentiments uttered by the hon. member,
Mr. Dibbs, I would at present deprecate the taking
away of the power of disallowance, because that
would really be severing our connection with the
empire, for which I do not think we are prepared.
I thank the members of the Convention for the
patience with which they have listened to me. lam
afraid I have been rather rambling ; but I was
anxious to touch upon various points. I hope that
I have made my own position clear, so that, as I said
in my opening remarks, the directions in which mutual
approach is required, and the distance that hon.
members stand from each other may be pretty well
ascertained, and I shall be as prepared as any man
to go half-way to meet the Convention on any one of
these subjects.
Sir JOHN BRAY : I join with hon. members who
have preceded me in thanking you, sir, for having put
before us these resolutions in such a shape that,
while we can freely and fully discuss the whole
question of federation, we do not in any way feel
ourselves pledged to the exact words you have placed
before us. I suppose we will all admit that, on
meeting here at first, there was on the part of every
one of us a little doubt and difficulty as to how the
question we had to discuss was to be first approached,
and we naturally relied upon you, sir, to put us in a
position to have a full discussion of the whole subject.
I think you have answered all our expectations in
the way you have brought the matter before us, and
although, for one, I would have preferred that, in
some respects, the resolutions had been differently
worded, still I feel satisfied that they-will answer the
purpose for which you moved them. I think the
discussion has proved pretty clearly that it would
have been easier for most of us if we had set to work
in the first place to determine what sort of govern-
ment would be satisfactory to the people of Aus-
tralia, and the people of the different colonies, before
we attempted to determine the powers to be intrusted
to the new parliament, because, assuredly, w r e shall
find in the long run that on the constitution of the
federal parliament and the federal executive w T ill
depend the powers that the people of the different
colonies are prepared to intrust to them. I feel,
from the discussions that have taken place, and,
perhaps, from the feelings of the people generally
throughout Australia, that of whatever the senate and
the house of representatives may consist, we must be
prepared to be governed by w r hat is known as
responsible government. Before w r e finally deter-
mine that, however, I think w r e ought to consider
whether or not, for the purposes for which this
government is to be formed, it would not be possible
to constitute a government on somewhat different
lines that would answer better for the purposes
we intend to carry out. I take it for granted,
sir, as has been pointed out by you, and assented to
by everybody, that in one of the two branches of the
legislature, which for convenience you have called
the senate, all the colonies should have an equal num-
ber of representatives ; and if this were an ordinary
form of government for the whole of the people of
Australia without regard to the different colonies of
which Australia is constituted, I should unhesitat-
ingly say that this suggestion on your part, and the
acquiescence in it on the part of those representing
other great colonies, would be a very generous con-
cession to the smaller colonies. But I take it after
all that we are not here simply to frame —and I
think my hon. friends, Mr. Grillies and Mr. Deakin,
fell into an error in this respect —we are not here
simply to frame a constitution for the government of
the people of Australia. We have also to proceed on
principles just to the several colonies. We are not
to recognise simply the fact that the majority of the
people of Australia must in the end prevail. I be-
lieve they must myself. I do not think there is any
question about it. But still we are here, intrusted
with the task of proposing a form of government
that shall afford to the people of Australia an oppor-
tunity to govern themselves. We must, however, at
the same time recognise the rights of all the different
colonies. Now, vTiat are those rights? was asked by
the hon. member, Mr. Deakin. I will tell him oue
of them. In determining that we have to recognise
the different colonies. We say this, that we must
recognise them. That is a point that has not been
put as clearly as it might have been. Why must we
recognise the rights of the different colonies ? Be-
cause the different colonies under the constitution
intrusted to them have undertaken certain duties
and carried out certain public works. They have
undertaken certain responsibilities in connection
with the payment for those works, of wTiich the new
federal parliament does not propose to relieve them.
They have still to bear the burden of these duties
and responsibilities, and we must do nothing what-
ever to prevent them from seeing that proper pro-
vision is made in their own colonies in order that
they may carry out the duties and responsibilities
they have undertaken. If the government we are
now proposing to create for the whole of the people
of Australia were to say to all these different colo-
nies, and if these different colonies were willing to
acquiesce in the proposal, "We will take over the
whole government of Australia ; we will perform all
duties ; we will undertake to carry through the obli-
gations the different colonies have entered into,"
then we might fairly say to the people of Victoria
and New South Wales, the two great colonies—
colonies that at the present time contain two-thirds
of the whole population of Australia —we might
fairly say to them, " Since you have generously
undertaken to carry out all our responsibilities and
all our duties, Ave recognise the fact that the majority
must prevail." But, so long as we say that each of
the colonies must separately undertake to perform
these duties itself, so long must w : e say, in any
system of federal government that is established,
" The colonies as colonies, apart from the colonies as
people, shall have an adequate voice in the represen-
tation of the people and in the discharge of parlia-
mentary duties." I am pleased that not a single
member of the convention has suggested that there
should be anything less than an equal representation
of all the colonies in the senate. It is true that in
the act Ave shall have ultimately to pass we shall
have to make provision for the subdivision of some
of the colonies, and of course it Avould be unreason-
able to suppose that such subdivision should take
place Avithout the federal parliament being con-
sulted and acquiescing in subdivisions that would
in any Avay affect the representation of the colonies


in the senate. e are told that there is a possibility
of Queensland being divided into three colonies. So
far as South Australia is concerned I do not think
there is any possibility for many years to come at any
rate of any subdivision of that colony. But I think
there is a misconception in the minds perhaps not of
members of this Convention, but in the minds of
many members of the public, who seem to assume
that the Northern Territory is part of South Australia,
that South Australia runs from Adelaide to Port
Darwin, whereas, as a matter of fact, this is not the
case. South Australia has no larger territory than
that which was first granted to her. At the present
time she has the Northern Territorv placed under her
control under letters patent from the Imperial
Government, and it is quite possible for the Imperial
Government at any time to deprive South Australia
of the control of the Northern Territory. Some years
ago, when I was in the government, and we thought
that perhaps we should be able to deal more advan-
tageously with the Northern Territory than we
believe we are able to do at the present time, we
suggested to the Imperial Government that, in order
to avoid complications in the future, they should at
once declare the Northern Territory to be part of
the colony of South Australia. But the Imperial
Government, while willing to assist us in any way
with the government of that part of Australia,
declined to accede to that proposal, and, therefore,
the Northern Territory is no part of the colony of
South Australia and will be required to be considered,
I think, by members of the Convention when we go
into Committee; because, as I have said, there is a
possibility of the mother country saving either that
the Northern Territory shall be handed over to one of
the other governments of Australia or to the federal
government apart from South Australia, and probably
in the end it might be found to be most advantageous
if it were possible to accomplish the latter. Now, I
say that the states must for the reasons I have
indicated to be adequately represented in any federal
parliament and federal government, and I was very
glad to hear the suggestion thrown out by the hon.
member, Mr. AVrixon, who represents a large colony,
that it might fairly be conceded that only a certain
number of members of the executive should be chosen
from any one colony. There is no doubt whatever
that there is a great deal of reason and common-
sense in the suggestion made by the hon. member,
Mr. Gillies, that anybody who undertakes to form a
government —you yourself, sir, for instance, and I
know from your experience that you would do it—
should look round carefully and not simply con-
sider what is most likely to satisfy the representatives
of New South Wales, and to carrv out their wishes,
but should consider the whole of the colonies, and
form a government that would commend itself to the
support of the representatives of the whole of
Australia. The hon. member went on to say that
there was a reasonable way of conducting things, and
that he had no doubt whatever that men would be
chosen in both branches of the legislature who would
act so reasonably and harmoniously together that all
these causes of friction which we anticipate would
prove imaginary and would disappear altogether; and I
felt then, as I feel know, that if we could select men
who would sink all personal differences, all the motives
which might appear to make them work harder for their
own particular colony than for the rest of the country,
we need have no written constitution at all. If the
people of Australia could depend upon the men
who were chosen to one house of the legislature
not attempting to infringe upon the rights of
the other house, but upon their doing their best
to promote the interest of Australia without regard
to the colonies from which they came, we should
not need a written constitution. It seems to
be taken for granted, too, that if we are to have
a system of responsible government, we must
also have an opposition. Now, I would ask hon.
gentlemen in determining this question to con-
sider whether it is absolutely necessary or desirable
in the conduct of the affairs of any colony, or, at any
rate, of a federal government, to have a responsible
ministry and an opposition. Is it necessary to have
men on the one side proposing what they believe to
be best for the state, and men on the other side who
advocate an opposite course, and who can only carry
out their views by removing those who compose the
government ? It does not appear to me to be abso-
lutely necessary to have a responsible government
and an opposition. I agree with the hon. member,
Mr. Deakin, that we must not readily cut adrift from
the old system under which we have worked, and
worked well. I agree entirely with the hon. member
that mistakes have been made under responsible
government, perhaps in all the colonies. At any
rate I admit that mistakes have been made in the
colony which I represent, and perhaps I should not
be thought presumptuous if I said that I think
similar mistakes have also been made in the other
colonies. But under no system of which I am aware
is it possible to avoid mistakes ; though it appears to
me an extraordinary thing that the management of
public affairs should be so different from what takes
place in the management of our private affairs, either
as individuals or as companies having control of a
large amount of money —that we should have on the
one side men composing a responsible government,
whose proposals, when they are brought forward, are
torn to pieces by the men on the other side. We
have been told by the hon. member, Mr. Gillies, with
a confidence that inspired belief in all of us, that if
an archangel came down and attempted to lead this
parliament, or any other parliament, and introduced
the most perfect measures, he would meet with
opposition.
Mr. Fysii : One cannot have perfection in man-
kind !
Sir JOHN BRAT : I am sure that the people of
Tasmania have the most perfect man at the head of
their government; I will not say that each of us
think the same with regard to our own colony, but
at any rate a good many people do. Still, lam not
going to elaborate this point now ; but I ask hon.
members to consider fully whether we are absolutely
pledged to have a system of responsible government.
I do not think we are, and I trust that when we get
into Committee we shall not hastily dispose of this
matter, but that we shall consider it carefully- I
agree'with those who say, like the hon. member, Mr.
Deakin, and the hon. member, Mr. Gillies, that we
must be'absolutely satisfied that it is a better thing
than we have got already. We must not drop what
we have got for an experiment, and although we
must not frame the constitution so rigidly as to pre-
vent its being altered, yet at the same time we must
have some basis which will give the colonies confidence
that it will not be altered without the fullest and
fairest consideration. I take it that we must provide
some means of altering the constitution of the federal
parliament and the federal executive. It should not
be done without the consent of the other colonies
probably ; but still there must be some means of
doing it, because I do not suppose that any of us is
so sanguine as to hope that in the course of the next
few weeks we shall be able to frame a constitution
that, without alteration, will give satisfaction to the
people of Australia for any great length of time.
With regard to the powers of the senate, which is to
contain an equal number of representatives from
each state, lam amongst those who say that we must
give it very ample powers; though lam perfectly
satisfied that if we do adhere to a form of responsible
government the voice that represents the large and un-
doubted majority of the people of Australia, must in
the end prevail. But we must not make it too easy for
that voice to prevail; we must not make it too easy for


the majority to say, " "VVe represent the majority of the
people of Australia, and although you represent the
colonies of Australia, we must have our way." But,
from my knowledge of them, I cannot believe that the
people of Australia will be satisfied with any form of
government that does not give the will of the people,
when it is ultimately ascertained, the fullest possible
control over the parliament and the government
under which they live. Now, with regard to money
bills. It seems to be assumed, Ido not know why,
that the control of money is different from the con-
trol of everything else. Ido not see why it should
be so. If the senate has the fullest possible power
to alter the laws that control the liberty and the
lives of the people, are they not to be intrusted with
anything more than a nominal voice in the expendi-
ture of public money? I say that I think they
ought to be. It ought to be possible for them to
have a direct voice, not in every detail —I do not ask
for that —but in the expenditure of any large amount
of money that involves any departure from the
ordinary expenditure of the year. I think, how-
ever, that the ordinary appropriation bill ought not
to be interfered with by the senate, providing
that it contains only items necessary for the ordinary
expenditure of the year. The hon. member, Mr.
Gillies, acquiesced in that very clearly; but at
the same time we must not have simply an under-
standing about this. AYe must have something defi-
nite respecting it in the constitution act which we
have to prepare, and I suggest that we should have
a provision, that no matter should be included in any
money bill which the senate shall declare should, in
the interests of any one of the colonies, or of all
of them, be dealt with in a separate measure. AYe
ought to allow them, not to reject a money bill
because they do not like it, but to say, " AYe have
looked at this bill, and it contains provisions which
ought to be contained in one or more measures."
They ought to have the right to say, "AYe require
you to send this subject up in a separate bill." AYe
have in South Australia a system that on the whole
has worked fairly well, but which really in effect
amounts to giving the power to the Legislative
Council to alter money bills. About thirty-five
years ago there was a collision between the two
houses of parliament with respect to money bills,
and they met together and made what is known as a
compact. It is not, of course, part of the consti-
tution, but it has been acted upon from time to time
since. By that the Legislative Council can suggest,
for example, that a certain line should be left out of
a loan bill. In South Australia a separate bill for
the construction of a railway is carried through both
houses of parliament before the amount for carrying
out the work is included in the loan bill; but in
i-espect of harbour works and other public works
proposed to be carried out by loan, the Council has
the right, under this compact, not to amend the bill,
but to suggest that a certain item should be omitted.
If the Assembly do not omit the item, or the two
houses do not come to an agreement upon the
matter, it falls to the ground ; but the houses have
power to appoint committees to confer with each
other, and to give the reasons why the suggestion
should be either acted upon or dropped. The system
is a rather complicated one, but, on the whole, it has
worked with fair success in South Australia. AYith
regard to taxation bills, I think the hon. member,
Mr. Clark, fell into a little mistake in saying that a
taxation bill required a message from the Crown
before it could be considered.
Mr. CLARK : It is so in our parliament!
Sir JOHN BE AY: It may be the practice, but I
do not think it is the law. I understand that the
South Australian Constitution Act is much the same
as that of Tasmania. The 33rd section of "An act
to establish a parliament in Yan Diemen's Land"
provides:
All bills for appropriating any part of the revenue, or for
imposing any tax, rate, duty, or impost, shall originate in the
said house of assembly, and it shall not be lawful for the said
house of assembly to originate to pass any vote, resolution, or
bill for the appropriation of any part of the revenue, or of any
tax, rate, duty, or impost for any purpose which shall not
have been first recommended by the governor.
That is to say that the house can raise money, but
cannot determine what is to be done with it, unless
the governor by message makes a recommendation
concerning it. Then, in May’s “ Parliamentary Prac-
tice ” it is clearly laid down that no private member
can, without the consent of the governor, bring in a
bill for taxation purposes.
Mr. Clark ; It must be a minister!
Sir JOHN" BRAY: A message from the Governor
is not necessary, but the request must come from
the Crown. It is stated on page G50 of May’s
“ Parliamentary Practice”:—
The Crown, therefore, in the first instance, makes known
to the Commons the pecuniary necessities of the government,
and the Commons grant such aids or supplies as are required
to satisfy these demands ; and provide, by taxes and by the
appropriation of other sources of the income, the ways and
means to meet the supplies which are granted by them. Thus
the Crown demands money, the Commons grant it, and the
Lords assent to the grant ; but the Commons do not vote
money unless it be required by the Crown; nor impose or
augment taxes, unless they be necessary for meeting the sup-
plies which they have voted, or are about to vote, and for
supplying general deficiencies in the revenue. The Crown has
no concern in the nature or distribution of the taxes; but the
foundation of all parliamentary taxation is its necessity for
the public service, as declared by the Crown through its con-
stitutional advisers.
That is tbe point. It is for tbe Crown, through its
ministers, to say what taxation is required; but an
absolute, direct message from the Governor is only
required when it is proposed to appropriate the
moneys which have been raised by means of the
ordinary revenue or in any other way. I quite agree
with you, Mr. President, that if we are to have any-
thing like a complete system of federation we must
have trade and intercourse absolutely free between
the colonies. I was a little astonished at the ex-
cessive precaution which appeared to be displayed by
the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, on behalf of his people
in Victoria with regard to this question. I think it
is clearly understood by all of us, beyond question,
that the federal parliament must impose a customs
tariff before this free-trade and intercourse is accom-
plished, except, of course, by agreement between any
one or more of the colonies. It may be desirable
for us, in order to give more complete assurance, not
simply to Victorians, but to colonists in all parts of
the country, to fix some date before which the cus-
toms tariff of the federal parliament should not come
into operation. Of course, in the ordinary course of
events, it will be three years or longer before it can
come into operation; but still it may be desirable to
make some such provision. In clause 3 of the resolu-
tions it is provided
that the power and authority to impose customs duties
shall be absolutely lodged in the federal government
and parliament, subject to such disposal of the revenues
thence derived as shall be agreed upon.
I am almost sorry, Mr. President, that you did not
indicate absolutely in some general way, how you
propose to appropriate these revenues. After all, the
only clear indication that we have on the face of the
resolution is that the federal government is to raise the
customs duties, and provide for a scheme of military
and naval defence for Australia, and to dispose of the
balance as shall be agreed upon. There is no doubt
whatever, as was clearly pointed out by the hon.
member, Mr. J. Porrest, that in order to carry out a
scheme of federal government we must be prepared
to go back to our respective colonies and point out
the advantages which will accrue to them from going
into a federal union. There is no doubt whatever
that in a general way the parliaments of all the


colonies have agreed that federation is desirable.
e\ have asked us to determine, if we can, on a
constitution which will carry out their wishes. But
w hen v r e have done that, we shall have still some
little labour before us. I hope, however, that Ave
shall ultimately succeed in being able to persuade our
respective colonies that it is to their advantage, and
to the advantage of Australia generally, that some
such scheme as w*e may agree upon shall be carried
i* am one 10se who feel that if it were pos-
sible Ido not think it is possible at the present
time—it would be desirable that the whole of the
public debts of the colonies should be taken over by
the federal government. Ido not think that that
could possibly be done for a time ; but I do think
that Ave could arrange for a considerable portion of
the debts of each colony to be so taken over. No
one AA Ould attempt to suggest, I suppose, that we
should preA r ent each colony from raising money to
carry out works wdiich locally are considered to be
absolutely necessary. At the same time, Ido think
Ave ought to hand over to the federal government a
certain proportion of the debts of each colony. The
colonies wo uld then see the advantage of federation
more rapidly than they would in any other way. I
believe Ave should find that a federal loan could be
placed on the market on better terms, and would be
much more eagerly taken up by the British public
than any loan of the separate colonies. At the
same time I am not prepared, and I do not suppose
any of us are prepared, to state that a federal parlia-
ment should absolutely take over the debts of the
Avhole of the Australian colonies. I can see, how-
ever, that great advantage Avould result if some
scheme could be adopted which would enable a fair
part of the debts of each colony to be undertaken by
the federal government. I agree with the hoii.
member, Mr. Dibbs—and no one, hitherto, has been
bold enough to say that he agrees with anything that
hon. member has said—that it is not desired to raise
up a great standing army for our defence from imag-
inary enemies. We feel that it is necessary for
each colony to d.o something to provide for defence
from common foes ; and I think that we may rely
that a federal parliament will do the same, and no
more. They will have no ambition to act contrary
to the wishes of the Australian people, and, as far as
I know those wishes, they are not that Ave should
rear up anything like a large standing army. They
are anxious that AA r e should have amongst us some
force which could be relied upon in time of danger;
they are willing to give their own services to augment
that force when the necessity arises. I hope, how-
ever, that no federal government or parliament will
ever raise any unnecessary military or naval forces
in the colonies, because they know the people are not
prepared to support such a scheme. I shall now say
a few words with regard to the house of representa-
tives, or, as it has been styled by the hon. member,
Mr. Kingston, the national assembly. I should be
sorry—and I think we should all be sorry—to feel
that we must be bound to limit the representation in
the house of representatives to fixed numbers. I
agree with those who say that the colonies which are
more populous than others should have more mem-
bers; but I think the indication thrown out by the
hon. member, Sir James Lee-Steere, shoAvs that it Avill
be necessary to make some concession to the smaller
colonies in that respect —in other Avords, you Avill
have to provide that each of the colonies, no matter
what their population may be, shall have a certain
minimum number of members. As the hon. member,"
Mr. Gillies, states, some such principle was indicated
in the Pederal Council Act. We must see at once
that if the idea which was thrown out in the bill
Avhich has been so ably drafted, and which I have no
doubt will give us great assistance, were adopted, and
the Western Australian people were asked to elect i
simply two members to the house of representatiA'es,
they would have cause to say that they were not
b adequately represented. While we must admit —and
' no one admits it more fully than I do, as I said be-
' fore -that when once the absolute will of the
majority of the people is ascertained, effect must be
given to that will; still at the same time I say that,
m order to offer a fair inducement for all the colonies
to attach themselves to the federal parliament, we
must fix the minimum number of members that shall
represent any particular colony. With regard to the
suggestion thrown out by my bon. friend, Sir George
Grey, of New Zealand, that the highest offices in the
state should be open to all persons, I agree with him,
except in reference to the governor-general. lam
quite prepared to go for that when I see any advan-
tage to be gained from it; but at the present time I
do not see that auy possible advantage could be
gained. We have come here with a desire to frame
a constitution under the Crown, and whatever the
possibilities may be in 100 years, I quite agree with
the hon. member, Mr. Gillies, that that is rather too
remote a period on which to fix our attention at
the present time. We can see a certain distance be-
fore us. We feel, I think, satisfied on the whole
with the forms of government that have been in-
trusted to us, with the power to amend which we
now have; but I agree with the hon. member, Mr.
Gillies, in saying that in all other respects the
ambition of Australians will not be satisfied unless
the highest offices throughout the Australian colonies
are thrown open to them, and, as far as I know,
there is no disposition on the part of those assembled
in this Convention, or on the part of the parliaments
of any of the colonies, to deprive them of those
opportunities. I trust that the same kind and
generous spirit that has been manifested by hon.
members who have so far addressed themselves to
this question will be continued throughout our meet-
ings here ; and I hope that each one of us will deter-
mine that we will not separate without agreeing on
some scheme that shall provide in a fair and, I hope,
generally satisfactory manner, for the federal parlia-
ment and federal government of Australia.
Motion (by Mr. McMillan) agreed to :
That the debate be now adjourned until to-morrow.
ADJOURNMENT.
Motion (by Mr. McMillan) proposed :
That the Convention do now adjourn.
Mr. MUNEO ; I think that we ought to have
some understanding that the debate shall be con-
tinued until a reasonable hour each day. If we
devote only four and a half hours each day to the
debate, it will be absolutely impossible for many of
us to remain here a sufficiently long time to finish the
business. Whilst at the commencement of our pro-
ceedings we were all rather chary about going into
debate, I think that we should come to the under-
standing now that wo will sit longer and devote more
time to the business each day. Wo have to finish
more than this debate. We have to go into Commit-
tee on the resolutions, and if we agree to certain
resolutions in Committee we shall have to draft a
constitution and go through that; and if it is under-
stood that we are to devote only three or four hours
each day to the business, it will be absolutely im-
possible for some of us to remain here—we must
leave the business and not carry it on.
Sir JOHN BRAY: Perhaps I may be permitted
to say that it will be very convenient if it is under-
derstood that we are to finish this debate to-morrow.
Hon. members who wish to speak can be present and
do so. I admit that we ought to have the fullest discus-
sion, and if it is understood that this debate shall be
brought to a conclusion to-morrow, it being, if neces-
sary, finished in the evening, every one who wishes
to do so can speak. I think that, with the exception


of the President, who may desire to speak at some
length in reply, all hon. members who wish to speak
should be prepared to ‘do so to-morrow.
Mr. J. FORREST : I think that there is no excuse
for those hon. members who say that they are not
prepared to speak at the present time. I have been
here several days —some hon. members have been
here longer than I have—and those who wish to speak
should have been prepared to do so long ago, or at
any rate now. We, who represent Western Aus-
tralia, are here at very great inconvenience indeed,
and it is impossible for us to stay longer than is
absolutely necessary; therefore I hope that those
hon. members who intend to speak will do so as soon
as possible. It is now very early in the day, and I
think that we might fairly have continued the debate
another hour. lam very sorry to see that towards
the evening there is a desire on the part of hon. mem-
bers to avoid speaking before the next day. I hope
that it will not continue.
Mr. McMILLAN, in reply : I may say that as far
as I am concerned I do not wish unnecessarily to
stop the debate; but personally I have very many
duties to perform, and it is impossible for me to go
on this evening.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Convention adjourned at 3 57 p.m.

FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.
SEVENTH DAY’S DEBATE,
Debate resumed on resolutions proposed by Sir
Henry Parkes (vide page 11).
Mr. McMILLxiN ; Mr. President, there has been
some considerable contention in my own mind during
the last two or three days as to whether I should or
should not address this Convention at the present
stage of its proceedings ; but when I had the pleasure
of listening to the speech of my hon. friend, Mr.
Dibbs, and when he told the Convention that New
South Wales has not been a hard step-mother, but
has been a loving mother to the other colonies, and
when he went on to say that her rebellious children
have almost crushed her out of existence, it seemed
to me it was time for somebody to rise to her defence.
Mr, Dibbs: Hear,hear! Especially a free-trader!
Mr. McMILLAN ; Sir, I do not intend to traverse
the speech of my hou. friend, because I think that
that class of criticism or hyper-criticism which is
generally indulged in in our houses of parliament is
not exactly the kind of debate which should obtain
here. Hon. members do not, perhaps, know my hon.
friend as well as I do. They, perhaps, to use a com-
mercial expression, merely see him in the bulk,
w hich, sir, is very considerable; but I know the hon.
gentleman in detail, and I should pot be surprised,
knowing the eccentricities of his previous career, that,
although ho has thrown several bomb-shells, as he
calls them, into the midst of the Convention, before
our proceedings close my hon. friend will be found to
be one of the most docile in our midst. My hon.
friend, Mr. Gillies, has, to a certain extent, rendered
unnecessary any criticism upon the speech of the hon.
member, Mr. Dibbs. But one expression to which
that hon. member gave utterance, and which he
reiterated two or three times, I cannot allow to pass
unnoticed. The hon. member said, “ I speak for
New South Wales.”
Mr. Dibbs : Hear, hear !
Mr. McMILLAN: Why, sir, you would think
that the hon. member had two-thirds of the people ot
New South Wales at his back.
Mr. Dibbs : So he has!
Mr. McMILLAN: I contend that no delegate
coming here for New South AV ales can speak in that
peremptory or autocratic way on this subject. When
we have concluded our deliberations the people ot
New South Wales will speak for themselves, and I
am perfectly certain that when this issue is put before
them clear and distinct their verdict will be that we,
the people of these colonies, should form a united
Australia. I want, at this late stage of the debate,
to be as concise as possible, without tedious repeti-
tion, following in the lines ot previous speakers,
although the speech of my hon. friend, Mr. Gillies,
which took up many points with which I intended to
deal, has, to a certain extent, dislocated my speech.
But it is just possible that at this stage of our pro-
ceedings w r e may by general remarks save time in the
later stages. It is not unreasonable to think that, at
a certain stage of our proceedings, the finance
minister of that colony—the mother colony which
for good or ill has kept to the fiscal traditions of the
mother country, should be heard, and should have
some voice in the settlement of that fiscal question,
which some hon. gentlemen say lies at the root of
the whole matter. I think that there are some
general views which may reasonably be expressed at
the present moment, and, although the most practical
part of our deliberations will be to form the body ot
a constitution, still I hold that it is the spirit and the
vital force of this discussion that will give shape to
the anatomy of that body, and which will regulate
its phvsiological functions. Therefore, I 1 eel bound,
sir, to make some preliminary remarks which may
not meet with the approval of hon. members, and 1
trustthat, although these remarks come from probably
one of the youngest politicians in their midst, it will
not be felt that they contain any impertinence, but
that what I say I say with the full conviction and
approval of my own conscience, and with a view to
the great destinies which are placed in our hands.
Now, sir, what is the attitude that we ought to have
assumed in coming into this Convention ? AVhat is
the spirit of the very resolutions which are the
groundwork of our deliberations? The whole spirit
of the Convention is in the mandate of the different
parliaments of this country, and we are met together,
not exactly to accumulate obstacles, not exactly to
see the differences which divide us, but to promulgate
a schemewhich, by lessening those difficulties, by doing
away with thedifferences which divide us, will bring us
into a central form of government which will not only
be a machinery for utilitarian purposes, but will
also be a real live government in the centre of this
country, radiating from itself the national life of the
people, and bringing into itself the best forces of the
various communities, bow, as far as I can see from
the tenor of the debates up to the present time, the
delegates have come here with more or less suspicion
of one another’s colonies. It seems to mo that the
lines which now divide us have been accentuated in
their force, and that, instead of bringing our minds
into that mental posture in which we might imagine
ourselves to be when we have done away wfith our


custom differences, when we have really become one
people, we are debating this question entirely on the
basis of existing divisions. When we come to con-
sider the question of what has been called by some
delegates state rights —but what, I think, was more
appropriately termed by my hon. friend, Mr. Barton,
the question of state interests —what, after all, are
those state rights —what, after all, are these pro-
vinces with their machinery for local government —
machinery for doing exactly in certain areas what we
do within our municipal areas ?
Mr, Claek : No !
Mr. McMILLAN: I repeat, what we do within
our municipal areas. If we are about to establish
a constitution which will be divided against itself, in
which all parts do not work harmoniously together,
which is not consummated step by step by a proper
process from the lowest to the highest, we commence
the creation at the very outset of a structure which,
antagonistic as it will be, in its different parts, will
be subject at any moment to fearful dislocation. Let
us imagine that the customs barriers between the
different colonies are removed, and what, then, are
the actual and relative positions of these different
communities one to another ? One hon. gentleman
in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales,
in debating this question from very narrow grounds
—probably owing to his legal training —said, “ Are we
going to give to "Victorians the same privileges as those
which we ourselves enjoy? Here we are,with a cer-
tain debt, with magnificent assets, and with a magni-
ficent territory, and possessing all these rights and
privileges: are we about to let Victoria, without any
quid pro quo , enter into the possession of the whole
of them?” Why, sir, we welcome from "Victoria
now any able-bodied man who likes to come into our
midst; and six months after he crosses the Murray
he enjoys all the privileges attaching to the wonder-
ful assets of New South Wales. I confess that I
cannot rise to the patriotism of New South Wales or of
Victoria, but I can rise to the patriotism of a future
Australia and of future Australians. And it seems
to me that if we lose sight for one moment of this
great union it must be an impediment in our national
path, and we commence our constitution-making at
the wrong end. If we are imbued with such a spirit
in the making of a constitution, I can see nothing
for it in the future but failure. Now, I do not con-
ceive that there is any strict analogy between the
position of the United States of America in their
earlier history and our position at the present time.
Nearly all the constitutions of these colonies have
been given comparatively during the last few years.
There is no absolute difference, either in tradition,
in laws, or in anything else, between the different
peoples of this country, and it seems to me that to
draw any strict analogy of state_ rights, such as exist
between peoples who have originated in a different
way and under different influences, would be entirely
to misconceive the basis of any future union of
Australia. The states of these colonies are dif-
ferently situated from those of the United States,
and this is one of the most important points in con-
nection with the whole of this discussion. We have
a series of states, and although I hold as strongly
as any one that no territorial lines should be altered,
except by the wish of the majority of the people of
each state, still I say most emphatically that if Aus-
tralia w r ere to be subdivided again no man in his
senses would subdivide the continent as it is subdi-
vided at the present time. Each of these states has
a littoral, each of them has a coast-line, which gives
it all the elements of national life and independence.
Each is so advantageously situated naturally that the
time may come when, owing to its national resources
and sea boundary, it may be an clement of great
danger to the union of Australia. Consequently it
seems to me that, unless in making this constitution,
we make the central government sufficiently strong,
and give it all the elements of sovereignty, our
national life may be endangered from within or from
without; and unless we disabuse our minds of all-
narrow views at the present time, the constitution we
create may, from the want of a true conception of
Australian nationality, and of the sovereignty of its
power, be unequal to the strain, and the consequences
will be lamentable for all future time. Now, sir,
what are the essentials next to the sovereignty of the
central government ? I am led, to a certain extent,
into this line of argument, because I do not wish to
traverse ground taken up before, and I may say at
once that with a great many of the sentiments of my
hon. friend, Mr. Gillies, I completely and absolutely
agree. The question that we have to decide at the
beginning is, what are the essentials of a sovereign
government ? We have had a great deal of discus-
sion in our legislative assemblies, and a great deal of
false alarm has been raised as to certain questions —■
the disposal of our lands, the question of our debts,
the control of our railways. Now, none of these
questions are in any sense essential to the sovereignty
of the federal government. If the whole of our
lands were alienated from the Crown, there would
still be a necessity for a central government; if our
railways were, like those of America, in private
hands, there would still be a necessity for a central
government; and so far as our loans are concerned,
that will be purely a matter of policy after we have
formed the federation. Now, there are two essen-
tials to a central government. It must be a govern-
ment that will concentrate upon itself the life of the
people, and it must be a government which will aid
our national development. It must be in all its
characteristics, and as far as its chambers are con-
cerned, and as far as their powers and privileges are
concerned, a government to attract all the ablest and
best minds of the community. Now, let us take the
military question. We have heard from Mr. Dibbs
that in these resolutions military aggression is clearly
forecast. There is nothing of the kind in these
resolutions.
Mr. DIBBS : The hon. member forgets the speeches
of the President on other occasions !
Mr. McMILLAN : We simply say that the cen-
tral government must have the nucleus of military
power; that it must be in a position to draw together
all the military forces of the community ; and fur-
thermore —and probably what I am about to say will
not agree with the views of my hon. friend—if you
give the central government absolute control of the
military power —and it is of no use to burk the
question at this stage of the proceedings— you
must place it in a position to command the whole
of the volunteer forces of these colonies. It must
not be for this colony or that to say, " Here is the
point of danger," or, " There is the point of danger.
We want our troops in our territory," or, " We want
them there." If this is to be a union of a national
character the moment the public safety is jeopardised
all provincialisms must be thrown away, every
man must consider himself an Australian, and
the central military power must be in a position to
send every able-bodied man throughout the whole
of these colonies to one particular point. There are
many other things which it would be necessary for
the central government to do, but they have been
nearly all touched upon by previous speakers. One
matter has been referred to, and' it has been said by
some people in our own parliament that it is a spirit
of militarism that is at the bottom of this movement.
I deny it, and I believe that when this question
come 3 before the people of these colonies as a distinct
issue it will be the idea of national life, the idea of
social development, the idea that we are one people,
that will be uppermost in the minds of all Aus-
tralasia. There is one matter to which it would be
well to refer at this particular point—that is,
the question of Western Australia. I believe that


there are a great many difficulties connected with
AVestern Australia, and I have been very careful to
think out in my own mind all the pros and cons con-
nected with that new community entering into our
union. But when I consider two great points —first
the question of national defence—and when I re-
collect that that colony has an enormous coast-line,
scarcely inhabited, that her territory includes one-
third, at least, of this continent —I can see nothing
in the question of national defence except what will
be to her advantage in the federation of these colonies.
If the national spirit, which, I think, should permeate
this movement, is embodied in this constitution, then
every other colony would spend her last shilling and
her last man in defence of the coast of AVestern Aus-
tralia. Then, again, with regard to the question of
credit, although I have the figures here, I do not
exactly know at what rate AVestern Australia
borrows; but I am perfectly certain that when we
become a federated Australia the credit of Western
Australia, as one of the group, will be absolutely the
same as that of the whole of Australia, which will be
an enormous advantage to her in the future.
Mr. J. Forrest : It is the same now !
Mr. McMILLAN : I am glad to hear that; but
does she borrow at the rate of 3| per cent. ?
Mr. J. Forrest : Wo borrow at 4 per cent., and
our securities stand at £IOB 3s. 6d.
Mr. McMILLAN: There is another question
which, to a certain extent, I think is connected with
my contention in favour of a strong central govern-
ment. There is in the centre of this great continent,
which you may call Central Australia, a large area of
land that adjoins three or four colonies. From its
peculiar position, from the smallness of its rainfall,
it will have to be dealt with in the future separately
from the other portions of Australia. It is not likely
with an enterprising people such as we have in these
colonies, with every obstacle going down before the
race to which we belong, that we shall allow the arid
wastes of the centre of this continent to remain as
they are for many years to come. There is no doubt
that a system of conservation of water and irrigation
must be introduced into that great tract, and if that
is done at all it must be done by a united Australia.
Consequently, there should be some machinery in the
central government by which the country in the
centre of this continent may be dealt with differently
from other parts of the continent. Now I come to
the question of intercolonial free-trade. Here, again,
I see from my notes that the hon. member, Mr.
Dibbs, speaks on behalf of New South Wales. Some
hon. members have said, and said rightly, that you
cannot touch the intercolonial tariffs until you make
a general tariff for the colonies. Their reason, as far
as I could judge from their speeches, was that
they could not possibly give up their revenue before
they knew what they were to get in place of it.
But there is another reason which will strike the
mind of any financial man. It is absolutely impos-
sible, in the nature of things, to have intercolonial
free-trade without a uniform tariff, because each
colony has its coast-line, and by means of ships by
sea you could intercept and defeat entirely your
intercolonial free-trade. Consequently, a uniform
tariff for the whole of the colonies must precede
intercolonial free-trade. There has been a certain
amount of discussion with regard to this intercolonial
trade, and when we come to think of the antagonism
between Victoria and South Australia, when we
remember all that Queensland has done in the last
few years in the same unneighbourly direction, it is
almost incredible that the whole of this vast machinery
has been set up for less than £500,000 per annum.
Some of the figures here are interesting. I find that
one of the greatest offenders—l do not know whether
it arises from a preponderance of the Scotch element
in its midst —is Victoria. Let us take the figures
for the colonies. New South AVales receives
£112,901 from intercolonial duties, and she pays
away £157,000. The colony of Queensland receives
from intercolonial duties £76,000, and she pays
away £97,000.
Mr. Donaldson: For what year are these returns?
Mr. McMILLAN ; The returns are for 1889.
An Hon. Member: How are these payments made?
Mr. McMILLAN: Each colony that I have named
receives from and pays to the other colonies in taxes
the amounts I have stated. This is the debit and
credit of the intercolonial intercourse in trade. We
find that our friends in Victoria collect £230,000, and
they only pay away £59,000. We find in the colony of
New Zealand that they pay away £140,000 while they
collect £IB,OOO. Now, when you consider the debit
and credit of the accounts, the sum of money for
which the whole of these antagonisms between the
colonies are created may be reduced to about
£250,000. That is a very good comment on this
question of free-trade and protection between the
colonies. Hon. members will understand that lam
not now going into the general question ; but lam
simply pointing out that while these duties are of
small account to the respective colonies, they have
created a system of irritation and retaliation which
has sometimes almost bordered on a civil war.
Mr. Mcllwraith : The irritation is entirely here !
Mr. McMILLAN : I think in this connection it
is only right that I should say openly and fairly that
I am quite willing, personally, to leave it to the
federal parliament to decide as to the tariff of the
future. I am willing to allow that at a certain
time in my political experience I had other views ;
but it seems to me that if we are to enter into a
union such as that I have forecast, we must enter
into it without jealousies and without suspicions, and
we must trust to the great federal government of the
future to deal with the tariff question. But I
believe that a certain time should elapse before that
tariff is approached, and for the reason, that up to
the present we have all been looking upon our
respective tariffs and upon the question of free-trade
and protection solely from a local aspect. But when
we come to adopt a tariff for the whole of Australia
it will be necessary that a certain interval shall
elapse, so that our minds may become accustomed
to consider the question from a comprehensive view
of the interests of a united Australia. And then,
whatever the future may be, I venture to think that
when Queensland has to come into a common tariff,
when Victoria has to come into a common tariff—
when a country like Victoria, practically without coal
or iron, has to join in a common tariff with New South
Wales, which has almost every mineral known in the
world—such colonies will then find that their views
of a tariff will alter exceedingly. They will find that
the tariff which might have suited the localisms of the
past will not suit the union of the future.
Sir John Bray : Don’t frighten them now !
Mr. McMILLAN: I, therefore, say in this Con-
vention —and it is my only reason for using the
argument—that an interval should elapse, so that the
minds of the people of the colonies, judging from the
extreme localism that has been exhibited, should have
time to view the question from a larger, broader, and
more comprehensive aspect. That is my hope for the
future, and that is the reason why 1 most unflinch-
ingly believe that we should leave the federal
parliament of the future to decide the tariff of the
union. The hon. member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith,
certainly threw the greatest bomb-shell into our
midst. If the quintessence of difficulties could have
been boiled down into the space of about twenty
minutes, my hon. friend would have managed to boil
them down in that space. Without having any
reference to this debate, I should like to remind him
of one fact, namely, that the dislocation of the
finances of this colony might possibly be more affected
by a protective tariff, such as he said Now South


"Wales must come to, if, as we understand economi-
cally, a protective tariff continually decreases. Of
course it is not necessary for me to refer to the
remarkable statement of my hon. friend, Mr. Dibbs.
That hon. gentleman said that this Convention must
lay down the basis of a tariff before it comes to any
conclusion.
Mr. Dibbs : The principles which should guide the
new government!
Mr. McMILLAN : I should like to point out one
thing in regard to the tariff, and with regard to that
dislocation of the finances to which the hon. member,
Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, has referred. I have before
me a table which shows that at the present time we
are borrowing all round at the rate of 4T5 per cent.
The loans outstanding at the present date are in
amount over £181,000,000, and the interest payable
is £7,545,000. If the whole of these loans were
converted, as they will be in time, into 3-| per cent,
loans, there will be a saving, taking the debt, even if
it did not increase, at the present rate, of £1,180,000.
Mr. Platfobd : What amount would you have to
pay the present bondholders to get the loans converted
into per cents, p
Mr. McMILLAN: The existing loans at 4 per
cent, and 5 per cent, are running out, and we shall
never convert at above per cent, in the future.
Mr. Baker ; Each colony can do that by itself!
Mr. McMILLAN: Exactly ; but I am only saying
that if the finances are to receive such a terrible dis-
location from the loss of the £500,000, and other
things, the tendency, on the other hand, will be to an
immense saving in the future; and I believe that
federated Australia will yet be able to borrow at the
rate of 3 per cent. There is another question which
enters intimately into the consideration of finance,
and that is, the question of the cost of the central
government, Eor the benefit of hon. members, I
have had tables carefully prepared with regard to the
general revenue and expenditure of the central
government. It is here proposed to give the whole
of the customs of the colonies to the central govern-
ment, and that, of course, is necessary to the sovereign
character of the central government and the control
of the coasts. I find that the total revenue from
customs duties, in the whole of the colonies, is
£8,641,000, and by the most careful calculation that
we can make, the total expenditure of the central
government would be £2,240,000 —that is to say,
merely 12s. per head in federated Australia for all
the advantages of central government; and we would
be able to return to the different colonies, as a
surplus, £6,401,000. I remarked just now, that if
our debts were reduced to 3i per cent., the amount
at which we are borrowing at present, that would
save £1,180,000, and if, in a federated Australia, we
reduced the rate of interest to 3 per cent., then wo
should save by that process alone nearly the whole of
the £2,240,000 required for the purposes of central
government. Of course there will be another way
of saving through the central government. All the
fortifications will have to be taken over at a fair
valuation, and colonies such as Victoria, which, I
believe, has paid for nearly all its fortifications out
of revenue —I think I am correct in that —will, of
course, have returned to them a substantial sum,
which will reduce their debt. I now come to a ques-
tion on which I shall dwell very shortly—the question
of the senate and the house of representatives. I do
not agree with hon. members who say that the senate
should be looked upon purely as a chamber for the
protection of state rights.
Sir John Bray: No one said it was to be purely
for that purpose!
Mr. McMILLAN: I consider that one of its
essential functions will be the protection of state
rights ; but at the same time it will certainly have
all the elements of a second chamber—a chamber of
great stability, a chamber which will attract to itself
all the best elements, all the elements which have
proved a success in other spheres of public life,
whether in the local legislatures or in the house of
representatives. That chamber, from its position as
a second chamber, and as a check, will be one of the
greatest bulwarks of the liberties of the people. As
regards the question of money bills, I give in my
adhesion simply to the confining of the initiation of
money bills to the lower house. I believe that in
every other respect the upper house must have co-
ordinate power. If we are to have a house that will
attract to itself all the ability of the country —if the
men who have had years of experience in the legis-
latures of the different colonies, and perhaps in the
house of representatives, are to be attracted to a
house where the weight of their experience and their
matured faculties must be felt, these men must go
into a co-ordinate assembly, and they must feel that
their position is one of the blue ribbons of the
political life of the country. I think, if that is the
character of our upper house, as I believe it will be,
we shall be able to trust to the wisdom and the
patriotism and .the well-known characteristics of our
people ; and no arbitrary check —no artificial means —
will be required to keep it from overriding the other
assembly. The more power you give then to the
upper chamber the more likely it is that there will
be but little friction between the houses, and that
they will do their duty as patriots to their common
country. Now, with regard to the question of veto,
I can see that, unless we have some rather elaborate
machinery, there will be great difficulty between the
senate and the house of representatives in dealing
with money bills. I take it for granted, as was done
by the hon. member, Mr. Gillies, that all questions
of ordinary appropriation for which revenue is avail-
able will, of course, be decided almost entirely by the
house of representatives ; but there may be this
difficulty : A loan which it is desired to float may
be initiated in the representative assembly, it may
be for £30,000,000; the upper house may think
that that is £10,000,000 too much, and there must
be some machinery by which they can intimate
their opinion. Instead of the bill being thrown
with indignity under the table in the assembly,
the upper house should be able to say, " We do not
think you should have £30,000,000 ; but we are quite
willing to grant you £20,000,000." It seems to me
that the only mode of settling differences in case of
a deadlock is the system of conferences which have
had such happy results in the United States. In
them men get away from the influence of party feel-
ing and are in a position analogous to that which we
occupy at the present time. They would be more
likely to come together in a spirit of amity, and the
common desire would be to do what was best for the
country. Consequently, I think some system of
committee for dealing with financial affairs between
the two houses should be brought into existence
where necessary, in order to prevent deadlocks in
these matters, so that the upper house, without
showing any indignity to the lower house, can say
exactly what they mean. I believe that if our house
of representatives is properly formed ; if it has a
longer tenure of existence than that house has in
America —and the shortness of existence there is, I
think, one of the great defects of the American
system —if it becomes a real house of representatives,
with proper powers, and if its machinery is such as
to attract to it the best men of the country, you will
find that no antagonism will exist between it and the
upper house on these matters, which cannot easily
be adjusted. As regards a penal dissolution of the
upper house, that is a most extreme proposition. The
upper house, if it is to have any characteristic, should,
have the characteristic of stability. It is to be the
house which, at the time of the greatest danger to
the whole nation, when, perhaps, an enemy is at her
very gates, instead of being open to penal dissolution


must be in sucb a position that two-thirds of its
members will stand secure with all the experience
and wisdom of acknowledged and trained politicians.
But, in order to understand the American system,
we must clearly understand the position of affairs
when that system was brought into existence, and
here I come into direct and absolute conflict with the
hon. member, Mr. Dibbs. That lion, member finds
fault with the insertion of the w r ords " under the
Crown" in the resolutions. But I tell my hon. friend,
if he is not willing to accept federation under the
Crown, he has no right to be here.
Mr. Dibbs: The lion, member said that before!
Mr. McMILLAN : I said in the early part of the
proceedings that I did not believe that my hon. friend
thought that. I believe he will come in with our
results at the end just as amicably as anybody.
" Under the Crown" makes all the difference between
the condition of affairs here now and the condition
of affairs when the United States Avere federated.
There they had their president and their two bouses,
and the system was what is called, in commercial
language, " check upon check." The states were
suspicious of the central government, Congress was
suspicious of its president, and the whole system was
an elaborate system of suspicion and check. But we
have no need for any extreme caution of that kind.
"We have a system of responsible government, and
we have at the head of it a representative of her
Majesty. Long may wo have her representative
among us. I do not agree with whatmyhon. friend, Sir
George Grey, said on this point. It seems to mo
that this makes the whole difference of the system —
it goes to the very root of the system. "We have now
a governor, whether he be able or not, who is above
party feeling. He never ceases to exist. Ministers
come and go, but there remains an absolute link of
communication from the people right up to the
head of the Government. And who in this country
wishes to be better than the Prime Minister
of federated Australia ? AVho cares to be the
Governor of federated Australia when the Prime
Minister is the first man in pow r er in the country ?
His position will be the blue ribbon of the highest
possible ambition, and the difficulties which met the
American people, arising out of the conditions of
political life at the time which were 100 years behind
our present development —they having to make a
man either a despot or a nonentity—for every presi-
dent has been one or the other —do not exist with us.
As the hon. member, Mr. Gillies, said, under our
form of government we have every possible freedom.
And if it suits the genius of our people and the con-
ditions under which we live, why should we look for-
Avard to another system, full of inexplicable diffi-
culties and dangers which nobody can foretell?
Noav, Avith regard to the position of responsible
ministers. I do not see Avhy these resolutions should
say that the ministers must be responsible to the
loAver house. Our Constitution says nothing of the
kind. Ministers cannot hold poAver a day after they
have lost the confidence of the people ; and by our
machinery, having our executive in the tAVO houses of
parliament —and I trust that the senate will have
some members of the executive among them—we feel
the breath of the people as Ave feel the wind of
heaven. Txventy-four hours need only elapse before
the feeling of the people is known, and in spite of
those gentlemen who wish to bring about the political
millennium, I hope that there will always be an
opposition, sturdy, critical, and independent, so that
the ministry may always feel the breath of the people,
and be turned out as soon as they cease to represent
the people. Now, Avith regard to the rights of the
colonies, and more particularly of the smaller colo-
nies, I think that in the consideration of the details
of the constitution Ave ought to consider the smaller
states more than the larger states. I believe that in
all political matters the best men will rise to the top,
and in the administration of a country Avith various
classes of offices, such as law, public works, defence,
and others open, there will require to be such a
diversity as Avell as such an extent of talent that
there can be no fear that the smaller states Avill be
snuffed out if they send capable men to the central
legislature of the country. I shall not attempt to
enter into matters Avhich lie more in the province of
the legal members of this Convention. I do not
want to delay for one moment unnecessarily this
debate. I trust, in the remarks I have made with
regard to the necessity for a strong central govern-
ment, I have given no offence to those gentlemen
Avho have taken an opposite vieAv. In coming here, I
am happy to say that I have been gratified to meet,
as I have met, the picked men of Australasia. I
have come aAvay from the party spirit of our oavu
Parliament, not to a body going to criticise minutely
every point of its deliberations as against each other,
but to a body that are actuated by one feeling, and
that is a desire to make a constitution Avhicli will
stand the test of time. I Avish to point out that Ave
are now making this constitution at a period of our
existence Avhen there is no hostile or disturbing
element in our midst. Why, gentlemen, could you,
as far as matters of locomotion are concerned, have
assembled here ten years ago in this Chamber, Avith
the prime ministers of the various colonies, ancl other
ministers of state performing important functions
could you have done that ten years ago ; would it
have been deemed possible ten years ago? If my
hon. friend, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, wants to go up
to the social troubles of Queensland, we can send him
up in twenty-four hours by an express train. Are
Ave to ignore the possibilities of the future ? Are Ave
to ignore this fact: that iioav, at a time when there is
a chance of laying truly the foundations of Australian
union, every year brings us nearer, by processes of
locomotion, to each other ? Our eager friends in
"Western Australia Avant a railway through; and I
believe that Avill be one of the first great under-
takings of the Australian federation. Year by year
Ave get nearer to one another, and year by year the
question of Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, and so on,
will become less and less in the distance of the future.
What I want to impress upon hon. members of the
Convention is this: that now, Avhen there are no
hostile elements, when protection, which is calculated
to call forth retaliation and to engender hostility
among the different colonies, is noAV to be cut off
completely amongst ourselves —I want to see a con-
stitution created of such a character as will annihilate,
not the localisms, but the nationalities of the different
states. 1 want to see a central government, which
Avill prove of immense service in welding together
the different elements of the people of this country.
I want to see a central government, which will deal
Avith the black question in North Queensland, and
wffh the great territories of Western Australia, as
far as by influence and by common consent they can
be dealt with. We should do uoav what is possible
in that direction. If Ave accentuate our differences,
and crystallise them under the constitution, Ave may
never be able to undo. Do not let us feel, when the
great future comes, that those who look back upon
our early efforts, that those who knew Ave had this
great opportunity before us, Avill be able to say,
" Patriotic and able as these men Avere, anxious as
they were to take action in these great affairs, they
did not see Avith sufficient clearness the great future
destinies of Australasia. They stopped short in the
very essential element of national union ; and, by a
av retched travesty of a constitution they actually
crystallised those differences which are noAV the great
bane of these communities." I belieA r e xve shall do
nothing of the kind. It is only Avith the x T iew of
raising my voice and trying to evoke in this Conven-
tion a spirit which will permeate our more utilitarian
efforts, that I have risen to speak on this occasion;


and I trust, sir, that, inexperienced though I am as a
politician, still, being ambitious as an Australian
patriot, the few words to which I have given utterance
this morning may contribute to the national union.
Mr. HACKETT: My hon. friend, Mr. McMillan,
has claimed the indulgence of the Convention as a
young politician. I feel, sir, that my claim to the
same privilege comes with double force, for not only
am I a young politician in my adopted colony of
Western Australia, but that colony itself is amongst
the youngest, is the very youngest, of the Australian
group of free states. In that connection, sir, perhaps
you will allow me to emphasise the remarks of the
lion, members, Sir James Lee-Steere and Mr. John
Eorrest, in expressing our gratification at being able
to be present on an equality with the other states of
Australia in this Convention. 1 should like to take
exception to something which the hon. member, Mr.
AVrixon, said in regard to that matter, when, with an
air which grated a little, although, no doubt, it was
wholly unintentional on his part, he spoke of Western
Australia as claiming some extreme privileges, under
the impression, perhaps, that as she was the youngest
child of Australia, she was to be treated as the pet
of the continent. None of us can forget that though
our majority dates back only a few months, in reality
we are the oldest child of the parent state of New
South AV ales ; that sitting here on an equality with
the other states we feel we are sitting among our
younger sisters; and if there were any danger of
our forgetting the duties that we owe to maternity,
the hospitality, the extreme and gracious kindness
we have received at the hands of the parent state,
will make it ineffaceable from our minds. AVe have
had the extreme disadvantage, as the hon. member,
Sir James Lee-Steere, has already put it, of arriving
late in this debate. The speech to which most of
the other speeches have been replies, more or less,
whether comments of censure or comments of ap-
proval, has been that of the hon. member, Sir
Samuel Griffith. We were unable to hear that speech,
and we were also unable to hear a speech which, I
believe, produced as great an effect on the minds of
those who heard it as it did on the minds of
those who read it —the speech of the hon. member,
Mr. Barton. But I would point out that our arriving
late —and I hope I may be forgiven for making this
passing reference to the matter —is in itself an em-
phatic argument in favour of the movement we are
here to advocate. Travelling night and day, with
most unusual expedition, we took over a week to
reach Sydney from our city of Perth. Had we that
communication which I believe is only a matter of
time, we could have shortened that distance by less
than one-half. I take it that if federation is to be
anything more than a name, one of its main objects
will be, not only to strengthen the political bonds
which unite us but also to abridge the physical
barriers which keep us apart. No doubt it is ivell to
talk of a union of hearts —I hope we have that in
Australia already; but I have been taught to con-
sider that an alliance of that kind, if it is to be bind-
ing and indefeasible, should be a lawful marriage -
should be not only a union of hearts but a union of
hands. I hope it will not be taken amiss when I say
that we feel that we cannot be actually a part of the
great Australian dominion, standing, with all the
representatives of the other colonies on perfectly
equal rights, until some better means of communica-
tion are established than the tempestuous waters of
1,000 miles of sea. It is not my intention to follow
my hon. friend, Mr. McMillan, through his speech ;
on the contrary, I am sure I express the regret -of
the representatives of my own colony, and no doubt
also the regret of the great majority of hon. members
of the Convention, that those figures with which he
favoured us were not presented before the members
of this assembly at an earlier period in the debate.
He sketched in the most cursory manner questions,
and gave us tables of figures which would require
hours to consider adequately. Even his remark
about the £2,000,000 which it would be necessary to
present to the central government, if it is adequately
to do its duty, was imperfect and obscure. What
did the hon. member, Mr. McMillan, mean by those
£2,000,000 ? What is the money to pay for —for
what things is it required ? Apparently, the hon.
member contemplates the central government taking
over the debts of the states.
Mr. McMillan: No. I left details to the Com-
mittee !
Mr. HACKETT: This more than ever accentuates
the difficulty in which I believe the hon. member has
placed the Convention by alluding in this slight
fashion to matters which should have been presented
at an earlier opportunity. But one word in refer-
ence to that debt. In the case of all the other
colonies it is a simple matter. You can estimate
your debt; you can put it down in pounds, shillings,
and pence. It is my intention this morning to deal
chiefly with the general question, because I feel
that these questions of detail are only introducing
division and leading to discursiveness when they are
brought in in this fashion ; but when we go into the
question of debt it will be easy to point out that in
the case of Western Australia there is a factor which
makes it practically impossible to estimate the share
which she should claim. You have got your debts.
As I say, they are cash debts. But how will you deal
with our land grant railways? We have handed or
are handing over something like 7,000,000 acres to
two large companies for the construction of these
railways. On what terms is the debt of Western
Australia to be calculated? I allude to this merely
to justify the course that I propose to take—namely,
to revert to the earlier questions which were placed
before us by the speeches of the hon. and learned
member, Sir Samuel Griffith, and others, and simply
to deal, in the first place, with the fiscal question,
and, afterwards, with the position of the senate. I
think that I may congratulate you, sir—if you will
allow me to do so in common with every hon. mem-
ber who has spoken latterly —on the progress that
has been made on this question. Practically the
great bulk of the resolutions which you were good
enough to draw up for this Convention have been
agreed to. The differences are few and small, and
it is a remarkable fact that, as the debate has pro-
ceeded, those differences have dropped off one by one.
If I may so put it, the pace was too hot for them;
they could not maintain a pace that was forced by a
determination for a federation, if possibly it could
be had; and the result now is that the real issues at
stake are narrowed down to two or three —no doubt
of vital importance —and the course which has been
pursued in the past affords the greatest hope that
they will be narrowed down still further, and finally
brought to a vanishing point before this Convention
gets out of Committee. I should like to say one
word with regard to the customs question. I believe,
as the hon. member, Mr. Wrixon, has said, that the
more we have looked at this matter —the more boldly
w r e have faced it —the less formidable it has become.
It is true that there is something of the semblance
of a “ lion in the path,” and for two or three days
that obnoxious beast has been lashing his tail about,
and has been roaring not a little terribly; and to
judge by the direction from which its cries proceeded,
I should say that the lion was couched somewhere in
the direction of that doorway ; but we have ceased
to fear him. The more the matter is examined the
more it appears certain that we can meet on a com-
mon grouud, and the proposal, the compromise which
has been generally, though not formally, accepted—
namely, that a certain period should be fixed during
which the tariffs of the different colonies should be
allowed to run before, by common consent, they aro
to expire—should bo satisfactory to all. It certainly


will be satisfactory, I believe, to my own colony.
Speaking as a free-trader, I regret that intercolonial
free-trade could not be established at once; but as
that is out of the question, the next best thing that
we can do with this lion in the path, if we cannot
order its instant execution, is to stand patiently by
until the time comes when it will perish of its own
accord. With regard to the contribution to the
federal government, if that tariff is to run for five,
seven, or ten years—the period makes very little differ-
once, it is nothing in the life of a nation —I appre-
hend that nothing could be easier than to insist upon
each colony contributing its quota, be it only 5 or 10
per cent., towards the general expenses ; for I do not
apprehend that the national government will at the
outset require either a very costly outfit, or a large
sum of money to enable it to undertake its work, and
to carry it out with efficiency. But let us hear as little
as possible, if I may venture to say so, of guarantees.
There was a tendency on many sides to insist that
before this colony or that colony, or this delegate or
thatdelegate should give in his adhesion, certain claims
and privileges should be considered as vested and
guaranteed. Happily these guarantees are, most of
them, disposed of now; but at one time they appeared
to threaten federation itself. We were to be guaran-
teed out of federation. All these questions of minor
details will, I believe, be settled; and let me say that
nothing is more irritating to a man of moderation,
and, 1 may add, to a man of common-sense, than to
see details raising themselves in the form of princi-
ples, and insignificant matters rising and threatening
to bar the way. We shall get rid of the customs
question, and as to those other questions —of the
capital, of the army, of separation, of the republic,
of the Murray—why these are not "lions in the
path," they are not even good honest beasts—they
are merely red herrings dragged across the trail.
When the time comes to dispose of them they will
be disposed of with satisfaction to all, and certainly
without danger to the interests of federation. But
behind them there lies the crucial question as to
what powers the federal body, or, rather, the central
factor in the federal body, is to possess. To us of
Western Australia, and, I believe, to all the smaller
states, this question of the senate and the powers
that are to be vested *in it is all-important. It is the
one on which we must stand or fall; we cannot pos-
sibly give w r ay. There is not one of us who would
dare to tell his constituents in Western Australia
that he had yielded an ace on this point; and lam
most happy to see that, with the exception of my
friends from Victoria, who seem determined to stay
out in the cold, there is now a practical concensus
of agreement by members of the Convention as to
the powers of the senate. The senate is the hinge of
federation. If we were asked to express in a single
sentence what this Convention has met to determine,
it might be put thus : to decide on the powers, the
composition, and the tenure of the senate. Hon.
members have spoken as if the question were one of
a second house, that we were looking about for a
second house. There is no doubt, as the lion, mem-
ber, Mr. McMillan, has said, that a senate of the
description which he so eloquently sketched—one
representing the states fully and endowed with co-
ordinate powers —would perform in an excellent
manner the duties demanded from a chamber of re-
vision and review, but that is not its basis. It is to
form the federal house as distinguished from what I
call the population house. That is the foundation
on which we are determined to build it. It is that
it should be the federal chamber representing the
states, that it should be the depository of state rights
or state interests, that it should be their trusted
guardian, as it will their visible and I hope enduring
emblem. It has been claimed by one or two hon.
members —happily they are in a very small minority
—that we should apply the conditions of the pro-
vincial governments to the conditions of the national
government. The hon. members, Mr. (Tillies and
Mr. Wrixon, and other hon. gentlemen from Vic-
toria, were loud in the expression of that claim. All
these hon. gentlemen have had much experience in
politics ; most of them have had much experience, if
not in constitution making, in constitution mending.
Therefore, I am forced to believe when they come
before the Convention with this astounding proposi-
tion, that we are to apply the conditions of provincial
government to the federal government —a proposition
as astounding, it seems to me, if it is not supported
by adequate proof, as the other one, that we should
apply the conditions of municipal government to
provincial governments, that they have some prece-
dent in their minds —some ease of a federal govern-
ment on which they rely, and by which they can test
their claim. I go to the Senate of Canada, and I
ask, is this power of amendment refused to them ?
Nothing of the kind. I go to the upper house in
Switzerland, and I ask, is this power refused there ?
I find nothing of the kind. Igo to the most
perfect system of federation which ancient or
modern history has seen, that of the United States
of America, and I ask, what is the rule there ? Not
only is it not withdrawn, but it is enforced with all
the validity of a statutory direction which cannot be
altered except by an immense majority, both of popu-
lation and of states. Therefore, sir, those hon. mem-
bers stand by themselves in trying to force on the
federal government a form which men, and very wise
men, have expressly refused to insert in kindred
constitutions, and they give us no reason whatever,
excepting a series of arguments, which, how r evcr
valuable on the hustings in Victoria, I venture to
say, have not only no validity but no relevancy to
the question at issue here. \Vv all aim at a united
Australia; but a united Australia may be of several
kinds. There may be a mere unity—a unity such as
existed in the American states under the articles of
confederation, and which broke down of its own
weight; a unity such as existed in Canada before the
passing of the British North America Act. That
system may be called the confederated one. Then
there is a union—a union of a federal character, true
union, true federation. And finally —and I believe
it is upon this kind of a united Australia that the
delegates from Victoria have chiefly fixed their eves —
there is a unification. That system may be called
the imperial system. Perhaps I may go one step
further, and call it the responsible government sys-
tem. It is the system which prevails in England,
and I hope the Convention will pardon me just for
one moment in remarking that that unification, if
they give it wings, will fly they know not whither.
Look at its course in the United Kingdom. There
was a time, not so very long ago, when there were
three branches of Parliament—Crown, Lords, and
Commons. The two houses seized the power of the
Crown, and made it, so far as legislation is con-
cerned, a nullity, except the very small privilege
Avhich the Crown has of requiring ministers to sub-
mit their measures to it in the first instance. Then
they went a step further. Having won the victory
over the Crown, the Commons and the Lords joined
issue, and another stage in unification was reached.
The Lords practically disappeared, and the Commons
mostly in legislation and wholly in finance reign
supreme. \V ego one step further, and we find that,
having defeated the Crown and the Lords, it is now
insisted that the executive government shall form
simply one of the departments of the House of Com-
mons ; they treat the executive body in every sense
as the committee hardly of both houses, but mainly
of the first house, and in every sense responsible to
the first house. And within the last year or two we
see the House of Commons, that all-devouring mon-
ster, going a step further, and claiming—-at all
events, with regard to some of the lesser courts of


law—that it shall constitute itself a court of appeal,
and insisting that question after question shall he
brought up from those courts of law, and decided
according to the orders of the House of Commons,
given to one of its executive ministers, the Home
Secretary. That is the course of unification, and that
is largely the course which will be seen in full sway
under the federation which I hope is about to burst
upon us if the members from Victoria have their way,
which I earnestly trust they will not. To my
astonishment, I heard an appeal made in favour of
this system of government, to the ancient Constitu-
tion of England. I can see the goddess who takes
down the facts of history shaking her head mourn-
fully as more than one delegate from Victoria
insisted on the statement. If those hon. gentlemen
will examine the facts of history, they will find this
most remarkable state of affairs: that the differ-
ence between the English Constitution of the pre-
sent moment and the English Constitution of the
time of the elder, or even the younger, Pitt,
is vastly greater, vastly more sweeping, vastly
more essential, than the difference between the
American Constitution of to-day and the Constitution
which existed in England at the time that the
American colonies seceded from Great Britain.
Making allowance for the inevitable difference
between the republican and monarchical form of
government, we see the capital difference between
the America and England of to-day—the distinct
separation of the functions of the legislature, the
executive, and the judiciary —flourishing at the point
of utmost vigour in England just before the time of the
secession of the American colonies. In fact, the
American Constitution was itself a designed and
deliberate copy of that state of affairs which it was
believed—which the greatest thinkers of the day
believed —existed in the English Constitution. And
yet we see the long distance which the English
Constitution has travelled from that day. I allude
to this fact just to enforce this argument: that the
most dangerous point about this proposal to ingraft
the present system of England upon our federal con-
stitution, is, that it seeks to fix the changeable, and
to make the unalterable the alterable. The beauty,
the virtue of the English system in its plasticity, its
elasticity. Generation after generation introduces
some novel feature, and its working conditions again
change, as they are changing in England now, and we see
the House of Commons absolutely suggesting a con-
dition of things by which its usurpation of rights and
privileges has brought itself into such a position that
it makes, I do not say good government impossible,
but it is going very near to making all government
impossible. Hoes anyone suppose for a moment that
the genius of the English people, probably the
greatest political genius which has ever existed, will
rest satisfied with such a state of things, that they
will not in a quiet, orderly, constitutional way dis-
cover a constitutional gate by which they may escape
from their difficulties ? And that is exactly what, if
we accept the bare words of these resolutions, against
which >Sir Samuel Griffith protested, will happen with
regard to the federal constitution. He would be a bold
man who would prophesy that in ten years' time the
British Constitution will be what it now is; and he
would still be a bolder man who would prophesy that
that other illustration which is being vaunted, with,
1 am happy to say, decreasing confidence —he would
be a bolder man who would declare that the Canadian
Constitution will be found exactly in its present shape
in the course of a dozen yearis. I do not wish to flog
a dead horse. Canada is almost out of court. How
could it be otherwise ? Her constitution has not
been in existence a quarter of a century ; it has stood
no stress or strain. It was begun —the words are
strong—in bribery, and it is continued by subsidies.
TV hat is the state of affairs there at the present
moment? Wo find one of the colonies of the North
American groupe absolutely declining from the first
to join the Dominion, and now more determined than
ever not to do so. It is freely asserted that in another
colony —Nova Scotia —there is a majority ready at
any moment to separate from the Dominion; while,
most ominous of all, within the last few days an
election in the Dominion has been determined, in
which the question, in a thinly-veiled form, was put
before the constituencies—annexation with the United
States or not ? It was called commercial reciprocity;
perhaps the better phrase would be commercial
annexation. But I believe that every man who voted
on that occasion, or, at all events, most men, had one
of two issues in their minds —either' commercial or
political annexation. We do not wish to reproduce
that state of things in this colony. .We wish to
build up a federation—as described in the introduc-
tory paragraph to these resolutions —established
on an enduring foundation. We wish to secure the
attachment of all parties ; and, if that be so, there is
only one way in which to do it, and that is for the
states to feel that their rights are properly guarded,
and that they are confided to a body of which they will
know, first, that it has a desire to guard them; and
secondly, that it has that which it will not have
if these resolutions be carried in their entirety,
the power to do so. Mr. Deakin asked what were
state rights, and I think he claims that he has not
been answered yet. Perhaps hon. members do not
think it necessary to answer him. At all events it
seems to me —if I may be pardoned for my presump-
tion in saying so —that an answer was ready, and that
that answer ought to have come from Mr. Deakin
himself. I will endeavour to extract it. Mr. Deakin
has for many years, with capacity and integrity un-
surpassed in these colonies, borne a large share in
administering the government of Victoria. He has
discharged with efficiency the duties of one of the
most important executive offices of that government,
and no man knows better than he does —and, did
occasion arise, no one would be better able to declare,
expound, and defend them —what are the rights,
privileges, and prerogatives of the province, colony —
whatever you choose to call it —or state of Victoria.
It is now proposed that Victoria shall surrender a
portion of those rights with which Mr. Deakin is so
familiar to the federal government. What, then,
will be her state rights ? It is the simplest thing in
the world to determine. Victoria will have all
her present rights, privileges, and prerogatives, minus
the limited, definite, and specified quantity which is
surrendered to the federal government for the pur-
pose of allowing it to carry on its own business.
Mr. DEAKIN: Hear, hear!
Mr. HACKETT : I have the declaration I wanted.
What is the main function of the senate of the
federal government? Is it not this: to cement these
isolated communities together, to make a dismem-
bered Australia into a single nation, to convert the
popular will —perhaps I. could not put it more shortly
or more emphatically than in those words —to con-
vert the popular will into the federal will —to allow
the popular body all the power to which it is entitled
—to allow it, in the first and in the last resort, to
give full voice to the wishes of the populace, but, at
the same time, to take care before that voice issues
forth as the voice of Australia that it shall be clothed
with all the rights and duties of the federal will ?
Without a strong, capable senate, this will be impos-
sible ; and I venture to say if we were to do any-
thing to weaken the power of the senate, if we were
to take even the extreme step of granting responsible
government in its present form—that is, the respon-
sible government which, asjapplied to a federation, is
distinctly not proved a success in Canada, and which,
as applied in the United Kingdom, has distinctly
proved a failure, and which has forced a large part of
that kingdom into a cry, irresistible as I think it will
be found, for something nearly approaching separa-


tion —if that is the responsible government which it
is proposed to graft upon our new federation, there
will be one of two alternatives—either responsible
government will kill federation, or federation in the
form in which we shall, I hope, be prepared to accept
it, will kill responsible government. One word with
regard to the phrase “ responsible government.” I
join most heartily with various members who have
spoken in wishing that the phrase could be abolished
—in fact, it must bo abolished. Responsible govern-
ment is a phrase which I would defy any one in this
assembly to define. It is a phrase unknown to the
British Constitution. It finds no place in our colonial
constitutions, nor does it find any place in the instruc-
tions issued from Downing-street to its servants —the
governors and heads of the executives of these
colonies. It is unknown except as a newspaper
phrase, or an oratorical expression. I will go further,
and say this : that if the words “ responsible govern-
ment” were adopted in our constitution, and the
question of their meaning were referred to a bench
of the ablest judges that could be found, they would
end by declaring themselves utterly unable to define
or to declare their meaning. There can be no doubt,
I believe, but that the phrase will disappear, and
that of itself is a great matter, because it will leave
the federal constitution free to develop itself in
whatever direction it may see fit within certain de-
fined bounds and principles. I am afraid I have
occupied the time of the convention much too long.
I will bring my remarks to a conclusion by expressing
the earnest wish—and perhaps it may be thought
that the delegates from Western Australia are a little
half-hearted in this matter ; but it is because they
have rights to guard, and because, as my friend, the
Premier of that colony, has put it, the matter has
not been adequately considered there—the earnest
hope that, having travelled so far, having found our
points of agreements so many, and our points of
disagreement growing less and less, we shall per-
severe to the end —that we shall bring this matter to
a successful consummation. I can assure this con-
vention, if terms fair to Western Australia are
granted, that all this diffidence which may be ex-
hibited, and necessarily exhibited by us, will vanish,
and there will be no more loyal or determined mem-
ber of the federation than Western Australia. It
will be a reproach to us of no common kind if we*
cannot succeed in effecting this federation ; and, on
the other hand, it will be an equally notable and
glorious triumph if we do succeed. For, what is our
position ? It is that we meet here under no menace
from foreign aggression, not under the pressure of
discord at home ; not in a time of weakening powers
and failing resources ; not, certainly —in spite of
certain ominous whispers heard from different parts
of the house —with a view to separation from that
motherland to which we owe our existence. But
with tranquillity at home and abroad, in the day of a
magnificent prosperity, and recognising that the
duties of motherhood can be best met by recognising
the claims of brotherhood, we come, because we
believe union and goodwill are better than envy and
division, because we are prepared to sacrifice the
jealousies between state and state, all pettiness of
aim and interest, and to dedicate for the future—a
long future, I hope—to the perpetual service of the
united commonwealth of Australia the energies, the
wisdom, the virtues, and the long experience of her
sons.
Mr. MOOEE: I desire to make a few observations
on the question of federation of the colonies of
Australasia; and as a humble unit of this convention
I feel the great responsibility that rests upon myself
and upon all of us. The questions submitted to us
are of a very momentous character, and therefore
wo should approach them with all the deliberation
possible. As time presses, instead of generalising, I
intend to confine my remarks specifically to the
points which you have submitted to us in your reso-
lutions. The first point is :
That the powers and privileges and territorial rights of the
several existing colonies shall remain intact, except in
respect to such surrenders as may be agreed upon as
necessary and incidental to the power and authority of
the National Federal Government.
I believe we are all agreed upon allowing the terri-
torial rights of the several colonies to remain as they
are. I do not think any of us came here for the
purpose of disrupting any existing rights with regard
to the territorial boundaries of the colonies of
Australia ; but the larger question which we have to
consider is, the necessary power and authority to
be given to the national government, and, at the same
time, the preservation of the autonomy of the various
states. These questions should run side by side with
other questions of great importance. I shall deal
with them more fully when I come to consider the
character of the constitution which we are about to
adopt. I now come to resolution No. 2 :
That the trade and intercourse between the federated
colonies, whether by means of land carriage or coastal
navigation, shall be absolutely free.
I think we shall generally agree with that resolution;
but I do not think one member has addressed him-
self to the meaning and effect of these words. “ coastal
navigation.” Under the principle of protection which
obtains in America, protection exists not only with
respect to manufactures, but also with respect to
coastal navigation. It is extended to all American
bottoms employed in the coastal trade. For instance,
a vessel loading at New York for London can dis-
charge her cargo in London and reload for any
.English port, Calcutta, Melbourne, Sydney, or any-
where else, and can carry on an English and colonial
trade as long as it suits her. But an English vessel,
loading in London for New York, after discharging
cargo at New York, must go back to England,
France, or some other country —she cannot reload
for any United States port. Ido not say that it is
necessary for us to establish that condition of things
at the present time ; but this principle is so closely
allied to the doctrine of protection that it may be
desirable to take powers to deal with it; and that is
why I have adverted to the subject. Of course, at
present our coastal navigation is absolutely free, and
it may be the best policy for Australasia to keep it so ;
still, as we are taking upon ourselves national
powers, this question, being a national one, should
receive our consideration. A great difficulty occurred
on this very question between the United States and
Canada, when Lord Elgin was governor-general,
lie saw that the American ships were in the habit of
swooping down on the whole of the Canadian ports,
returning with cargoes to the United States, while
the Canadian vessels could only touch at one United
States port, they could not reload for another, but
were obliged to return to Canada. He brought the
matter before the Washington Government, but they
pooh-poohed it. They said, “This is a national
question. You are only Governor-General of
Canada, and you can have nothing to say about it.”
The result was that Lord Elgin and his ministers
recommended Parliament to impose taxes on vessels
belonging to the United States passing through the
Welland Canal from the lakes to the St. Lawrence
Eiver, thus almost prohibiting United States vessels
from getting to the ocean from the lakes. The
people of the United States were thus paid off in
their own coin, so that they were obliged to grant
reciprocity with respect to Canadian vessels ; but
they would not concede that reciprocity to English
vessels. I mention this matter as one that should
be taken into consideration—as to whether or not we
should ask power from the British Government to
deal with a question of this kind. I now come to
the 3rd resolution:


That the power and authority to impose customs duties
shall be exclusively lodged in the federal government
and parliament, subject to such disposal of the revenues
thence derived as shall be agreed upon.
I believe tliis is a very important proposition, and
one which will receive general sanction from the Con-
vention. I believe that if we impose customs duties
exclusively through the federal parliament we
shall necessarily have a uniform tariff, and I believe
it is agreed upon all hands that we should have
a uniform tariff throughout Australasia. It is strange
that the little colony that I partially represent has
been in the van on this question, and has taken
the first step in this direction with the assist-
ance of the colony of New Zealand. Eor many
years an agitation has been carried on in favour of
intercolonial reciprocity ; and I recollect that you,
sir, in the conference of 1880-81, adverted to the
question, and desired to carry out some principle of
the kind throughout Australasia. The colony of
Tasmania, in conjunction with New Zealand, induced
the British Government to introduce a bill into the
British Parliament, giving the colonies of Australasia
the right to enter into intercolonial trade relations.
I regret that, although the Act is still on the imperial
statute-book, but very little good resulted from it,
and that the colonies did not take the initiative in
endeavouring to establish a customs zollverein, or
something of that kind, in order to bring about inter-
colonial free-trade. But still matters have been
going on evolving and developing themselves until
we have come to the larger phase of the question,
which we are now considering. Before I leave this
point I might refer to another matter which I do not
think has been considered here, and that is the power
to differentiate the duties in favour of Great Britain
and her possessions. I think this question was first
brought prominently forward by the Melbourne
Chamber of Commerce, which considered that this
power should be given to the colonies if they thought
it desirable to exercise it. In creating a new con-
stitution it is necessary that we should consider not
what is required at the present moment, but what
may be required in the future working of our national
life, and I have brought these matters before the
Convention in order that if it is thought desirable
they may be embodied in the constitution. I now
come to that part of the resolution which proposes
that the military and naval defence of Australia shall be
intrusted to federal forces, under one command.
I feel that this is a question pretty easy of solution.
There is no doubt that the command of the federal
forces should be vested in the governor-general of
the federated dominion. The whole of the forces
should, of course, be under the federal government.
That was the question, raised in the report of General
Edwards, which primarily brought about the present
movement in favour of federation. Ido not believe
in the maintenance of a large standing army. Ido
not think there is any necessity for such a thing in
Australasia. A proper organisation of the forces
already existing, with a possible increase as emergency
may require, the chief command being given to an
experienced military officer, is all we shall require.
As far as the navy is concerned, I think we are
better served by the present arrangements than we
could be in any other way. It is not contemplated,
I think, to establish a federal navy. If it were so
proposed, it would be found that the taxation
required to maintain a federal navy would necessarily
be very heavy ; therefore, I think that if Great
Britain extends her protection to us in the way she
does at present, the colonies paying a certain pro-
portion of the cost, that is all that will be required in
Australasia for many years to come. The resolution
then goes on to say :
Subject to these and other necessary provisions, this Con-
vention approves of the framing of a federal constitu-
tion.
This brings us to one of the most important points of
all —the federal constitution, which the resolution
says shall consist of a senate and a house of repre-
sentatives. There is no doubt in the world that that
is an outline for a federal constitution —a senate
and a house of representatives, presided over by a
governor-general, and consisting of an equal number
of members. That, of course is the American prin-
ciple. In America, the senate is composed of two
members elected by each state. It has occurred to
me that if we adopt the American principle in the
election of members of the senate, we should have a
number that would be divisible by three, for the
reason that in sending representatives to this Con-
vention we have had some difficulty in the different
legislatures in electing seven delegates. The lower
house has claimed the right to elect five of the
delegates, and to this the upper house has demurred.
Now, if we have six or nine members, and the lower
house elects four or six, as the case may be, and the
upper chamber elects two, we shall do away with
any friction between the two branches of the legisla-
ture in electing niembers to the senate. In looking
at the work of responsible government in connection
with an institution of this kind, it strikes me very
forcibly that the working of responsible government
on the English principle is incompatible with state
rights. In England you have one unified and indi-
visible interest, and there the application of the
principle of responsible government may be carried
to its fullest extent, because you have not to deal with
the interests of a number of federated states. But
in our federated government the great question will
be to preserve the individuality of the different
states or provinces, and in forming the constitution
we must be very careful that this object is clearly
kept in view—that is to say, in establishing a federal
government, we must draw a clear and distinct
line constitutionally between the powers of the
federal government and the powers of the state
governments. In the United States the people have
never parted with their sovereignty. There, in any
amendment of the constitution, the question is first
of all submitted to the people by convention, and
the people have in no case parted with their
sovereignty either to the senate or to the house of
representatives. The initiatory is with the people,
and so it should be in our case. As far as the senate
is concerned, I think it should be made as far as
possible amenable to the people. I do not care if
you make the senate amenable to the people by way
of dissolution, only do not divest it of all power. In
the machinery required, financially and otherwise,
for the working of a federal government, you must
necessarily leave considerable power with the senate.
The English system of government involves party
government, and a delegate from Victoria said yes-
terday that finance was government, and government
was finance. If finance is government and govern-
ment is finance, then it will be seen at once that we
vest the whole of the power in the house of repre-
sentatives if we take from the senate the function of
dealing with questions of finance. In large ques-
tions nearly the whole power must be necessarily
vested in the house of representatives. Therefore, I
believe that the senate should have the power of
veto in detail —that the senate should have the power
of objecting to any financial measure which it thinks
is not in the interests of the country. In the case
of the different legislatures, as at present constituted,
finance is everything —finance is the sheet-anchor of
the whole system ; finance is the sheet-anchor of the
existence of ministries ; by it they live, move, and
have their being. We know that in these colonies
all ministries are made and unmade on questions of
finance. Try and apply the same principle to a
federal government, and what will be the result ?
The same result will follow, and the two colonies
which have the absolute control of finance, could


place the other colonies which enter the union in such a
position that I am sure they would never have entered
it at all if they had kjiown beforehand what would
happen. I feel certain that we are going in the right
lines if in the construction of the constitution we reserve
to the senate the power of dealing with questions of
finance as far as the power of veto is concerned, but
not with regard to initiation. While the house of
representatives has the power of initiating all ques-
tions of finance, there can be no danger, I think, to
the larger colonies. I hope that we can agree to a
system that will work harmoniously. It is my desire
to do all I can to help to bring about federation, and
I hope that we shall not split upon this rock, but
that we shall agree to some compromise that will be
accepted on all sides. I might, however, say a few
more words with regard to the senate. I was very
much struck with the eloquence and the ability dis-
played by my hon. friend, Mr. Gillies, in dealing with
the question of the senate. He wished to do what ?
He wished to construct the senate of gentlemen
possessing superhuman attributes. They were to be
perfect in every Avay ; they were not to possess any
of the frailties of human nature; they were to have
a perfect immunity from the defects which trouble
other people ; but he would not intrust them with
power over money; he would not allow them to deal
Avith the question of finance. They were to do every-
thing but deal with questions of finance. We should
try as much as possible to bring before our minds the
nature of a federal constitution, and the difference
between'a senate and the House of Lords, or the
upper chambers of these colonies. There is no
analogy between the two bodies. In the latter bodies
the interests of a single community are dealt with,
Avhile in the former the diversified interests of a
number of colonies must be protected ; and I am sure
that unless the senate has some poAver, the colonies
will have no guarantee of the inviolability of their
rights, which is one of the things upon which the colo-
nies, before entering upon the consideration of a con-
stitution, ought to insist. I lIOAV leave this question,
and come to the question of tariff. I think that the
question of free-trade or protection might very well
be left to the federal parliament. For many vears it
has been my opinion that protection Avould "be the
policy of Australasia. I have for years seen that AA r e
are gravitating in that direction, and there is no doubt
that where you find democracy in the ascendant, you
always find tbe question of protection more or less
associated with it. In my mind there is no doubt but
that protection will be the policy of Australasia—
that we shall have free-trade between the colonies,
and protection against the outside world. I knoAV
that you, sir, are the apostle of free-trade, and no
doubt you deserve credit for the admirable way in
Avhich you have advocated the principle of free-trade;
and that principle Avould be right enough if you had
the same condition of things existing throughout the
various countries with which you traded. But the
question is too large to go into at the present time,
and I shall not say anything more about it. Another
question that lias been brought before us is the
position of the federal capital; but I think that that
is also a question which may be left to the federal
government for determination. The same question
gave rise to a great deal of trouble in Canada, They
had at one time an itinerating capital. When I Avas
living there it was Kingston ; then Toronto became
the capital, and finally Montreal; but when they
wished to move the Federal Parliament from the
last named city, so violent was the feeling against the
proposition that the Houses of Parliament Avere burnt
down. _ The matter was then left to the British
authorities to decide, and a spot was selected at a
little fishing village called By town, now known as
Ottawa, on the Rideau Canal. There is no doubt at
all of the wisdom of that selection. The town
is far away from the boundary line of the
United States, at a point where all the lines of
communication connecting it with the various
places throughout the Dominion could be preserved
in case of war, and, as I have said, the selection was
a very happy one, and reflected great credit upon
those who made it. I have just been reading about
the growth of Canada since the federation, and I in-
tended to show the results which have followed feder-
ation there. I have made a note of the development
of trade there, and it will show the desirableness of
federation. The inter-provincial trade between the
eastern provinces is $55,000,000, which is equal to
sixteen times the trade done in the first year of the
confederation, and twenty-seven times the trade done
in the year previous to it. They have now 14,000
miles of railway, including the railway between the
Pacific and the Atlantic, representing a capital of
$727,000,000, and 2,400 miles of inland navigation,
the various connections of which have cost
$30,000,000. These great w T orks could not have
been carried out if the provinces had remained
isolated, and 1 feel sure that from the federation of
Australia similar results will accrue. I therefore
heartily support the resolutions, and will render
every assistance in my pow T er to carry out the objects
for which we are met here; and my prayer is that the
future generations of these colonies may say of
united Australasia, as Tennyson said of England :
A land of settled government,
A land of just and old renown,
Where freedom broadens slowly down
From precedent to precedent.
Mr, CUTHBERT : I think it right to congratulate
the members of the Federal Conference which met
about twelve months ago in Melbourne on the suc-
cessful result which attended their efforts on that
occasion. The very able manner in which the ques-
tion of federation was debated by them was an edu-
cation in itself to the whole of the colonies; and the
result of their labours was summed up in a series of
resolutions which commended themselves to the
people of the whole of Australia. At the very out-
set, the first resolution, after recognising the services
of the Federal Council, declares “ that the seven
years which have elapsed since 1883 have developed
the national life of Australia in population, in
wealth, in the discovery of resources, and in self-
governing capacity, to an extent which justifies the
higher act, at all times contemplated, of the union
of these colonies under the Crown, and under one
legislative and executive government, on principles
just to all the colonies.” That was followed by a
resolution which imposed as a duty upon the mem-
bers of that conference the taking of such steps as
they might think necessary for the purpose of in-
ducing their respective parliaments to send delegates
to a national convention for one purpose —for the
purpose of framing a constitution. “Empowered to
consider and report upon an adequate scheme for a
federal constitution ” were the words of the resolu-
tion. Now, sir, those gentlemen loyally discharged
their duty. They were all, apparently, of one mind
that the resolutions were fitly, aptly, and properly
prepared; and they ventured to submit them to
their respective colonies ; and by the parliaments of
those colonies they have been indorsed. The result
is, that those parliaments have settled for us the
question as to whether it is desirable that a union
of the colonies should take place or not. That
question is answered, I think, in the affirmative with-
out any mistake ; the action of each colony in send-
ing men from each parliament, selected without
consideration of parties from both houses of the
legislature. Accordingly a mission has been in-
trusted to us. We have been delegated to discharge
the great, important, and delicate task of framing a
constitution, making it as perfect as we can in all
its proportions, but, above all, just to all the colo-
nies. That is a task which is approached by all mem-
bers in a spirit of compromise; and I think that


before we close our proceedings we shall have the
satisfaction of knowing that the work we have
undertaken will be fairly and properly accomplished,
and that that work is in no degree inferior to the
great undertaking of those eminent men who, in
the autumn of 1864, assembled in Quebec, and
brought about the union of the North American
provinces. Passing from that, I deal with the
resolutions which you, Mr. President, have sub-
mitted in your usual calm, lucid, and dignified style.
You have invited us to frankly, freely, and fully
discuss the principles embodied in these resolutions.
The different speakers who have addressed them-
selves to this question have not dealt generally with
the whole subject of federation; but they have
confined themselves, and I think properly so, to the
principles embodied in the resolutions. Looking at
the Ist resolution, I think, having heard what I have
heard since I came over to this favoured colony of
yours, that there is a section of the community who
think that the delegates from Victoria and Queens-
land have some sinister object in view ; who think
that they are actuated by an improper desire to
filch from the parent state a portion of its territorial
rights. I think that these gentlemen who entertain
such an opinion have done us great injustice. Such
an idea, I know, was never contemplated. I speak
on behalf of the Victorian delegates, and I may say
that I speak on behalf of the delegates of all the
colonies, when I say that such an idea never entered
into their heads ; and if it did, the language in
which the resolutions is couched would unmistakably
show to those who read that none of the privileges,
or powers, or territorial rights of the several colonies
would be interfered with. It is provided that they
are to remain intact, unless each particular state in
order to accomplish the great federal object which
we all have so much at heart, sees its way to
surrender some part or portion of the privileges,
powers, and rights which it has hitherto enjoyed. I
am very pleased that that resolution stands first,
because those who entertain the opinion to which I
have referred will have their minds completely dis-
abused if they rely on the assurance of the delegates
now assembled here. The 2nd resolution, which
affirms that we shall have free-trade and intercourse
throughout the length and breadth of the Australian
continent, is merely a repetition of the oft-expressed
desire of numbers of the people of this colony —
indeed, of all who desire the welfare and the
advantage of Australia—that there should be free-
trade among the colonies ; but I gather, from the
debates that have taken place, that there will follow
in its train protection against the outer world. I
think that the one is a corollary of the other. I
think that it must follow as the night the day, that
if we have free-trade among ourselves, we must
have protection against the outer world. Unless we
have that, how are we to meet our engagements ?
It is proposed here to hand over to the federal
parliament the right to impose custom duties; but,
before I come to that, I might say that it seems to
me most strange that in a vast continent like that of
Australia —equal almost to the whole of Europe,
where there are no great natural barriers, but where
the whole of the continent is divided among five
colonies, rich in resources, with fertile land, with
great mineral wealth, with an enterprising and active
population, surrounded by all the necessaries of life,
and who ought, with the perfect freedom that they
enjoy under their different constitutions, to be the
best and the most contented people in the world-
people sprung from the same race, and owing
allegiance to one Sovereign —it is, I say,
strange that those who are all sprung from
one common stock should raise artificial barriers
between themselves, which, I consider, are a blot
upon their legislation, and a blot upon the civilisa-
tion of the nineteenth century: barriers which have
been erected by themselves in order to prevent that
free-trade which ought to exist between a kindred
people speaking the same language. These barriers,
these customs duties, these hostile tariffs, what do
they amount to after all ? They are only calculated
to irritate and to annoy, to create ill-feeling, and,
probably, in the not very remote future, retaliation ;
and if federation is not brought about, and these
colonies become powerful, we know not what might
happen in the not distant future. Suppose that some
discordant element, some cause of umbrage arose
between the people of the respective colonies, we
know not but what we might be plunged into civil
war. It is open to us at the present time to avert
such a calamity, and the sooner these barriers of our
own creation are removed the greater-the satisfaction
that will be felt throughout the Australian conti-
nent. But I know very well that these barriers
cannot be removed until federation is accomplished
—until it becomes a living reality. I assume that
all the delegates here are of one mind, and that they
see the necessity of organising and bringing together
all the powers of their intellect, in order to carry out
the mission intrusted to them, which is to frame a
proper constitution. Assuming a federal parliament
to be constituted, we must provide it with a proper
source of revenue, in order that it may carry out its
engagements and fulfil the duties which will devolve
upon it in relation to the several subjects which may
be specially intrusted to its care, control, and juris-
diction ; and it seems to me that the very best way
to accomplish the end in view will be to allow the
federal authority to impose customs duties. The
colonies derive a great portion of their income at the
present time from customs duties. There were some
figures placed on this table this morning for the first
lime, though I confess that when the lion, member,
Mr. McMillan, referred to them I could not clearly
grasp the whole subject, and I question whether any
hon. member in the House was able to do so; but it
occurred to me that, putting it in round figures, we
might say that the customs duties amounted to some
£8,000,000, or a little more, for the whole of the
colonies ; and that it would be necessary to spend
something like £2,000,000 in order that the federal
parliament might meet its engagements. It may be
said, " Surely this is a very heavy expenditure." But
it must be borne in mind that the respective colonies
will be relieved from the expenditure which is now
necessarily entailed upon them in connection with
various subjects, such as defence and the other dif-
ferent matters referred to in the list submitted by
the Premier of Victoria. I therefore agree with
those who entertain strong views in favour of protec-
tion—like my hon. friend, Colonel Smith, who is an
out-and-out protectionist, and who very carefully
guards the interests of the constituency which he has
represented for so many years, and who, I think, has
properly said that unless federation be on the lines
of protection it would be useless to ask the co-opera-
tion of the colony of which he is one of the repre-
sentatives. As to the material guarantees which
have been spoken of, I think that when wo come to
close quarters in Committee —for up to this time
we have been only skirmishing —the difficulties will
disappear one after the other, and that this, which
was supposed to be the " lion in the path," vvill
very soon disappear. Now I come to deal with
the military and naval defence of Australia, which
it is proposed shall be intrusted to federal forces
under one command. I cordially approve of that
proposition, which has met with general accept-
ance all round —and why P Because we know that
the colonies recognise that the duty of protect-
ing their own shores devolves upon them —that they
have erected fortifications, and that many of the
colonies have an efficient permanent corps of artil-
lerymen which has been strengthened by the volun-
teers who have come forward in the cause of their


country to give their services as militiamen. But
we are aware that there is a weakness all through the
design. We are aware that if any portion of the Aus-
tralian continent were* attacked, while a friendly and
brotherly feeling would dictate that we ought to go
to the rescue of the place attacked by a hostile foe,
we have no power whatever to order our troops out
of our own colony, to go and concentrate their forces
with the others. And though we received reports
from different naval and military commanders as to
the state of our forces and their efficiency—as to
their courage, that -was undoubted—we were not
satisfied merely with reports from our own officers ;
Ave wanted an independent authority of eminence to
give us his candid opinion of the action we had
taken in our endeavour to form an efficient military
and naval force. Accordingly, the colonies united,
as they have done on several occasions, always lead-
ing towards unity, and applied to the Imperial Glov-
ernment to send an officer to report on our forces.
General Edwards then came here, and furnished us
with his report, to the details of which I will not
refer. But he pointed out, unmistakably, where
our weakness lay. I think it was his report which
induced you, Mr. President, to communicate with
the premiers of the other colonies, the result being
the conference in Melbourne to which I have already
referred. Some hon. gentlemen may think that by
placing the whole of our forces under one command
we want to raise a large military force which will
saddle the country with expenses that may be deemed
unnecessary. But, as I understand the resolution,
it has no such meaning. The federal parliament
will look closely into the question of the finances.
They will see that it will be expected by all the col-
onies that due economy shall be observed in the ad-
ministration of the funds intrusted to them, and that
it will be expected that out of the £8,000,000 of
revenue handed over to them at least £6,000,000 will
be available for redistribution among the colonies ;
and the colonies will look with a very observant eye
upon all that is done by the federal parliament, be-
cause they will be interested parties, and they will
know that in order to meet the engagements into which
they have entered it will be necessary for them to
husband their resources in every w T ay. In my
opinion, the placing of the naval and military forces
under one command will not be attended with much
additional expense. We want no large standing
army here. There is no necessity for it. If we
protect our ports as we are doing, and having men,
money, and the munitions of war, having men in our
artillery forces as well skilled and competent as any
to be found in her Majesty’s service, and in addition
to that, having powerful and efficient guns of the
latest type, we feel that the obligation devolves upon
us to have a force sufficient to protect us against
invasion. Will hon. members permit me just to
make one quotation from a work by a most eminent
man, highly skilled in the art of warfare? Major
Clarke, writing on the navy, sets forth the advan-
tages which the colonies reap from remaining part
of the empire. He summarises them as follows :
Their commerce, —
That is, the commerce of the colonies, —
which is their very life, has received, and will receive the
protection of the greatest naval power of the world.
2. The necessary standard of the local defences of their
ports is reduced to a minimum.
3. They require to be able to resist a cruiser raid, since a
hostile fleet cannot reach them in force, except on condition
of defeating and destroying strong British squadrons.
These are the words of one who speaks with authority,
and who points out exactly the danger we are in. As
long as England is mistress of the seas, as long as we
are a dependency of England, we may rely on her
support, and so long we may depend upon it no foreign
power,- however strong, can set foot on these shores.
Since Major Clark wrote on this subject we must not
lose sight of the fact that we have taken a new
departure, and that we recognise that our commerce
is the very life of our colonies. We have recognised
this, that it is unfair that the mother country should
he saddled with the whole expense of defending our
commerce on the high seas ; and therefore, I am
proud to say, as the result of a conference which
took place in London, and to which we sent dele-
gates, that for the first time, I think, in English
history the colonies have entered into a partnership
by which they are enabled to have the advantage of
the support of what may be termed an Australian
squadron. Under the British flag we may rest in
security, leaving' it to the squadron in this part of her
Majesty’s dominions to protect our commerce, and
taking upon ourselves the duty of defending our
shores. I have spoken, so far, briefly, because I
think that at this late period of the debate I should
be trespassing too much on the time and attention of
hon. members were I to go through the whole of the
subjects connected with federation. I have confined
myself in the few remarks I have made to the
principles contained in the four resolutions; but I
cannot conceal from myself that there yet remains
one vital and important subject to be touched upon—
one that has occupied more attention than all the
others put together. With regard to the amend-
ments which may be submitted in Committee, they
will not involve much difficulty, and I think the pro-
ceedings in Committee will be comparatively short,
as the principles embodied are generally acceptable.
I did not anticipate when the debate commenced that
its great interest would centre, not on the constitu-
tion of the houses of parliament, but on the duties,
and the privileges, and the rights to be conferred
upon ono of the two houses. Whether that house is
to be called the second chamber, the senate, or the
council of the states, is immaterial. To the very able
speeches delivered on this subject I listened with
great attention. The Premier of South Australia
advocated the cause of the house of representatives,
contending that as all power springs from the people,
as I admit it does, the house of representatives must
have the control of the purse, and that all measures
relating to money matters, and the imposition of
duties, must originate in that house. lam perfectly
in accord with him as far as the origination of such
bills goes. I think that usage has determined, if
nothing else has, that they must originate in the
house of assembly. I shall not discuss the question
why, if the two houses are perfectly equal, those bills
should not originate in the second chamber. Suffice it
for me to say that 1 follow on the lines of parliamentary
usage, and I say, “By all means give to the house
of representatives the power which the people’s house
has been in the habit of claiming, and which is fair,
of originating those bills.” There seems to be a
unanimous agreement that all the states shall be
represented in the house of representatives according
to their population ; but when we look at the constitu-
tion of the senate, the whole order of things is to be
reversed, and each state is to have an equal number
of representatives in that chamber. That principle
is agreed to all around. Eor what reason is it agreed
to, except to confer upon the senate equal and co-
ordinate powers with the house of representatives,
not only in general legislation, but also in all
measures relating to money matters. I see the
Premier of Victoria sitting opposite to me, and I
should like to make that hon, gentleman, above all
others in the convention, a convert to my views.
Mr. Muneo : It will take the hon. member a long
time !
Mr. CUTIIBEBT: Because I know how much
depends upon Victoria acting in hearty co-operation
with the views of members of the convention. The
leader of a powerful government has, perhaps with-
out due consideration
Mx\ Muneo : Oh, no !


Mr. CUTHBEBT : Perhaps in a moment of haste,
expressed a certain view, because Victoria has a
written constitution quite dissimilar from that which
prevails in Tasmania and South Australia. In Tas-
mania the Council has claimed and exercised all along
the power of dealing with money bills in the same
way it deals wdth any other measure ; and a similar
right, I understand, has been claimed in South
Australia.
Mr. Munro : With pow : er of dissolution !
Mr. Platford : Claimed, but never exercised !
Mr. CUTHBEBT: I understand it has been
claimed, and the difficulty has been bridged over by
a course which I hope and trust will be adopted in
this chamber, namely, by compromise. Suggestions,
I understand, are offered by the second chamber in
South Australia for the consideration of the govern-
ment or the other house. This practice keeps the
two chambers in perfect touch wdth each other, and
the difficulties that would arise from exercising the
power of absolute veto are very much diminished
indeed. My hon. friend, the Premier of Victoria, if
I understood him aright, is prepared to give to the
senate a powder of veto in all matters.
Mr. Munro ; Hear, hear !
Mr. CUTHBEBT : I would ask my hon. friend
what that means in the ordinary transactions of life
as between man and man ? If he is leaving Victoria,
and he appoints me his agent, with a large and
general power, to manage his affairs, to let the whole
of his property, is it to be said that because I possess
the large power of dealing with the whole of his
properties I cannot let one of his houses ?
Mr. MunroJ: If the hon. member does not get the
authority, he cannot!
Mr. CUTHBEBT: But I get the full and complete
authority. You propose to give to the senate the
complete powder of veto. Why does not the greater
include the less in parliament, as it does in private
life? You say the senate are competent to exercise
the larger power. The larger pow r er means the power
of throwing out a whole bill—of throwdng the
finances of the country into confusion—of causing
the greatest disaster. But a remedy is about to be
applied here. While you are willing to confer the
larger power, why should you take away the lesser
pow r er, namely, that if in a particular bill there be
one single item in wdiich a principle of policy is in-
volved, or w'here an expenditure or the imposition
of a duty is disagreed with, the senate shall not have
the limited power of veto ?
Mr. Munro : Why have you not that power in
your chamber?
Mr. CUTHBEBT: That is not an answer to the
question.
Mr. Munro : Oh, yes it is!
Mr. CUTHBEBT: It is not, because the senate
is to be constituted on a broader basis. You acknow-
ledge that the states are equally represented, and you
are walling to give to the senate the larger power, but
you deny it the lesser power,
Mr. Munro : I would give them the same power
as your chamber has !
Mr. CUTHBEBT : My hon. friend says, “We are
prepared to give the senate the larger power, but not
the lesser powder,” because he has been brought up
in the practice under the Constitution of Victoria.
That is the sole reason.
Mr. Munro : Oh, no !
Mr. CUTHBEBT ; That is one of the reasons, and
the principal reason, why the hon. gentleman is not
a convert to my views.
Mr. Munro : Because it would be unjust!
Mr. CUTHBEBT: Before lam done with the
hon. gentleman, I think I shall convince him that
there is nothing radically wrong in the view T s taken
up by the representatives of the different colonies.
Mr, Munro : My reason is that it is unjust!
< Mr. Adxe Douglas : What is just ?
Sir Samuel Griffith : That is merely an epithet!
Mr. CUTHBEBT: I take it, then, that, first of
all, the hou. gentleman objects to give the lesser
power because it is not given in the constitution of
Victoria. But we do not concentrate all the wisdom
of the ages in Victoria.
Mr. Munro : Certainly not; I only wish you did !
Sir Samuel Griffith : The Victorians think they
do !
Mr. CUTHBEBT: I w'ould put this position to
the hon. member. Supposing an amendment were
proposed in the constitution of Victoria, how very
different indeed would be the attitude of the Legis-
lative Council now from what it was when it merely
represented a handful of people; for before the
reform of the constitution it represented only
30.000 persons.
Mr. Munro : And w r as intensely conservative !
Mr, CUTHBEBT: It was conservative, and it
was, perhaps, on that account that the restriction of
the powei’s of the Legislative Council was stated in
express language, namely, that it might accept or
reject any bill that came before it, but that it could
not amend a money bill. How r , suppose it were the
intention and expressed w r ish of 130,000 of the
principal electors in the colony of Victoria that an
amendment should be made in the constitution upon
the lines indicated by those w T ho have advocated
that these powers should be conferred upon the
senate
Mr. Munro : You would never get it!
Mr. CUTHBEBT: Hot get it in Victoria! The
hon, member seems to forget altogether the change
of circumstances. We had, I believe, only 30,000
electors before w r e had the reformed constitution of
1880; but I believe the Council now represents
130.000 of what may be called the very pick and
flow er of the population of Victoria, We have repre-
sented there both rich and poor.
Mr. Munro : Ho !
Mr, CUTHBEBT: Wo have every careful and
prudent man represented there. We have every one
there wdio has given a hostage to society that he is
likely to make a good citizen. All are represented
there, and the hon. member will not deny it. It is a
great pow'er in itself that the Legislative Council
now r speaks and acts with the full sanction and autho-
rity of over half a million of people.
Mr. Munro : And it is very much less conservative
than it used to be!
Mr. CUTHBEBT : lam glad to hear that, because
it is an indication to my mind that the hon. gentle-
man sees, and it would be surprising to me if it were
not so, that the Legislative Council may, before long,
ask for an amendment of its Constitution in this
direction.
Mr. Munro ; If you get the power here you will
try it there, I know !
Mr. CUTHBEBT; I think it is very likely that
some means may be devised by which the washes of
the various colonies represented here may be accom-
plished ; and I think it w r ould follow" certainly that if
these powers w r ere granted to the senate, the legis-
lative councils of the colonies, situated similarly to
the Legislative Council of Victoria, would certainly
claim the same right.
Mr. Munro : Hear, hear!
Mr. CUTHBEBT: It is the wonder of the thinking
people of Victoria that in the question of finance
their upper house really has no power, because,
although the powder of veto is all very well in its
way, and is, I admit, a great pow r er, still it must be
very carefully exercised, and under very peculiar
circumstances indeed. The Council must be per-
fectly satisfied in their own minds that the proposi-
tions laid down in the bill submitted to them are
radically wrong, and that they have at their back,
not only the constituents of their own chamber, but
the whole people of the colony. How, the hon.


member will see that the position taken up by those
who advocate that the senate should be endowed
with co-ordinate powers with the house of represen-
tatives, is not an unreasonable position, for -where
did this idea of giA r ing equal representation spring
from? It sprung from a precedent of 100 years,
from what has taken place in America ; and we find
that there the system which gives co-ordinate power
does not work to the detriment of the people. I
think it would be wise, therefore, if, when you are
giving the larger power of veto, you granted also the
power of veto in detail. I admit that it is all very
well for me in this chamber to speak as I am doing ;
but I know the difficulties which will meet the
Premier of Victoria when he presents that aspect of
the case to the people of Victoria. We ought, as
far as we possibly can, to devise some means by
which the difficulties that now separate certain sec-
tions of this chamber may be overcome. The hon.
member, Mr. Gillies, in the admirable speech he
delivered yesterday, pointed out that all questions of
public policy involving expenditure beyond the
ordinary expenditure of the year, that is, unusual
expenditure, might be contained in separate bills,
and sent to the upper chamber in that form.
Mr. Mxtnbo : Hear, hear. We all agree to that!
Mr. CUTHBEET : My impression is that that is
reasonable, and I think that we may so deal with the
proposal in Committee that we shall find that there
is not, after all, such a great difference of opinion
between us.
Mr. Wkixon : Hear, hear !
Mr. CUTHBEET : I am sanguine that some means
may be devised of bridging over the difficulty, because
I earnestly wish that there should be a hearty co-
operation among all the Victorian delegates upon
this question. Except the Premier of South Aus-
tralia, they seem to stand alone upon this ques-
tion. The great majority of the chamber are,
as I understand the feeling, to some extent opposed
to their view. My hon. friend, Mr, Heakin, in
the course of his speech, said, “ If one chamber is
to be compelled to undergo what is known as a penal
dissolution, a dissolution which is a personal penalty,
an individual private penalty inflicted upon every
member of the popular house—if it be called upon to
undergo that trial at the pleasure of the upper
chamber, let that chamber also enjoy the sweets of a
similar appeal, and be bound by the same verdict.”
If hon. members are prepared to take that stand we
might, I confess, obtain a basis on which further
argument would be possible. Now, if I were pro-
posing that the Legislative Council of Victoria should
have the power of amending money bills, I would
not attempt for one moment to lessen the duration
of time for which the members of that body were
elected. If the choice were given to me in this way,
“ Will you take the power of amending money bills,
and in the event of a money bill being sent up to you
and rejected by you in the first session, and being sent
up to you and rejected by you in the second session,
and it being of such vital importance to the govern-
ment that they were prepared after your second
refusal to take the view of the country at large upon
the measure, and to ask for a dissolution, would you,
the members of the upper house, be prepared to make
a similar appeal ? —my answer would be, “ Yes ; I
think it would be a very proper course to pursue.”
If we did that, we should hear no more about dead-
locks. They would be completely at an end, because
after the bill had been rejected in the first session,
unless there was some great and potent reason for
it, it would not be sent up to the legislative council
on the second occasion unless the government were
determined to demand a penal dissolution. And
how would that injure the council P While we have
been speaking about this question, we have confined
ourselves altogether to the power of the senate ; we
have not spoken of its constitution. I may say that
the remarks of the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, were
qualified by this statement: that he would like to
know on what basis the senate shall be appointed.
I take it that there could be few better bases of
selection of the senate than that which obtained
in the appointment of this distinguished assemblage.
I think that question might very well be remitted to
the two houses of parliament; and that in the selec-
tion of members of the senate each house should
select an equal number. I know that other views
are entertained. I know the hon. member, Mr.
Fitzgerald, thinks that each state should be left to
itself to say in what manner it shall elect members
of the senate.
Mr. I'iTZGERALn: They claim that as a state
right!
Mr. CUTHBEET: I think it is very likely that
the result would be that it would be left to each par-
liament to appoint the senate, because I can see that
if a colony were divided into eight provinces, the
expenses of contesting an election would be so
heavy that few men would wish to enter into such a
contest: and the people would be better satisfied if
the choice of the senate were made by the respective
legislatures, and made in equal numbers by each
house. I have put the case in this way, wishing to
make a convert of the hon. member, Mr. Munro, to
my view that there is nothing unreasonable in the
desire entertained and expressed by several gentle-
men that the senate should have co-ordinate powers
with the house of representatives ; but I think that
in Committee we shall be all prepared to meet in a
spirit of compromise, and I do trust and hope that
the difficulties which at present seem to surround
this very important question may disappear. One
word in connection with the judiciary and as to the
powers of the supreme court which shall constitute
a high court of appeal for Australia. Of course if
we have a federation of the colonies, we must have a
supreme court and a high court of appeal. I have
listened to what has been said by the late Attorney-
General of Victoria, the Attorney-General of Tas-
mania, and the Attorney-General of Queensland.
While he was careful not to express any decided
opinion, I am inclined to think that the Attorney-
General of Tasmania was perfectly right in one por-
tion of the views which he presented—namely, that
we ought not to interfere with the appointments
made, and to be made by the states of their respective
judges. Leave that altogether to the states ; do not
seek to deprive them of that power. But there must be
a high court of appeal, and that high court should deal
with questions between the states and the federation.
From that court I think it would be highly desirable
that there should be an appeal to the Privy Council.
It is useless for us to entertain the idea that as long
as we are a dependency—and I hope we shall
be for a long time —the Queen will ever concede
to these Australian colonies a request which was made
by the North American provinces, and refused. They
Avere as anxious as are some hon. gentlemen here, that
the decision of their court of appeal should be final;
but her Majesty, speaking in her own person in the
Privy Council, says to all her subjects outside Great
Britain and Ireland that if any one is aggrieved and
seeks redress, let him come to the Privy Council. I
think that it is right that that perogative and privi-
lege should be still retained, and it would be unwise
for us to ask for a thing which we know must be
refused. Then it is proposed in these resolutions
that we should have :
(3.) An executive, consisting of a governor-general, and
such persons as may from time to time be appointed as
his advisers, such persons sitting in parliament, and
whose term of office shall depend upon their possessing
the confidence of the house of representatives expressed
by the support of the majority.
As to the latter part of that, I think it might very
well be excluded, and that w r e should adhere to the


usages of Parliament. I certainly like to stick to
the old landmarks. I was surprised and astonished
when I heard one member after another trying to
sever the links that connect us with the old country.
I never thought that when these propositions were to
be submitted here I should hear any hon. members
say that the Crown should cease to make the few
appointments which now rest in its hands in these
colonies. I know that in my own colony of Victoria
the Governor and the Master of the Mint are the
only officers appointed by the Crown. I was quite
surprised when I heard hon. members say, in this
Convention, that, in order to educate our young people
to fill the highest offices in the state, it was necessary
that we should take from our Queen that privilege
which has been so long, so usefully, and properly
exercised. It was also said that we ought to make
our own acts of parliament, and that the right of veto
should be done away with. Surely we ought not to
ask for any greater powers than the Canadians
possess. It is sufficient that we pass our own laws,
and unless the veto is exercised by the Queen within
two years, that veto is completely at an end, and in
the meantime, until the veto is exercised, the measure
passed by us is the law of the land. Ilow often will
the veto be exercised? Not once in a century. I
had intended to cut my remarks very short, and I am
sorry that I have travelled so far out of the beaten
track of what I intended to say; but the subject is
one of great importance, and I wished, if possible, to
devise some means or see some way of getting over
the difficulty which relates to the senate. I have to
express my grateful thanks to hon. members who have
listened so patiently to me. I have not forgotten
that expression of yours, sir, in which you said that
the tree of federation had been planted. I hope and
trust that it is so ; that its roots will sink deep into
congenial soil, and that it will grow, as years advance,
in strength and beauty ; and that it will flourish for
many years to come ; that against its roots passion
may beat in vain, and that under its branches the
people may find shelter and protection.
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS: I shall endeavour to
carry out my intention to curtail my remarks in a
different way from that adopted by the last speaker ;
and instead of commencing with the first of the
resolutions, I shall commence with the last, which
says :
An executive, consisting of a governor-general, and such
persons as may from time to time be appointed as his
advisers, such persons sitting in parliament, and whose
term of office shall depend upon their possessing the
confidence of the house of representatives, expressed by
the support of the majority.
Now, that clause has been very little dwelt upon, and
I am at a loss to understand what meaning is
attached to the words “ from time to time be
appointed as his advisers.” I imagine that the
executive government of the federation will be formed
according to the general principles of government
which have prevailed hitherto in the Australian
colonies, and that the governor-general will take his
advisers from which side of the house he pleases, but
will take care, and in fact must find it necessary, to
take them from that side of the house which is in a
majority. Consequently the governor’s advisers must
represent the majority of the people ; and in no other
way that I can imagine can a government of the kind
be carried on. The words “ responsible government”
have been questioned in this Convention. Now, a
term may in course of time acquire a meaning which
it did not have when first used, and “ responsible
government,” as I understand the expression as used
here, means that the executive shall represent the
majority of the house of representatives. The gover-
nor, nevertheless, may choose his advisers from either
side of the house ; but he is certain, as I said before,
to select them from amongst those who represent the
majority of the people in the popular chamber. By
no other means can I imagine that representative
government could be carried out. But here the words
used are, "as shall be appointed." Appointed by
whom? It can only be by the governor-general,
because I suppose no one here entertains the idea
that the governor-general should be the appointee of
the people at large, or of the federal parliament, or
any portion of that parliament. The governor-general
must be the representative of the Queen by direct
appointment from her Majesty, and that being the
case, the government will be carried on in fede-
rated Australia in the way usually adopted now
in the different colonies. That appears to me to be
the only way in which we can get along in this matter.
The last speaker dwelt at length—- though he did not
enlighten us much —on the constitution of the senate.
The discussion that has taken place on this subject
has, I think, clearly shown that the view taken by
the majority of the Convention is that the senate
must have the same power of dealing with finance as
that exercised by the house of representatives, and if
the senate has power to deal with finance it must
have power to deal with the details of finance, or some
particular mode must be invented by which it shall
be able to deal with all questions of finance, except
the estimates for the year. If some system of that
kind is put before us, I thing we shall have no great
difficulty in coming to a determination on the point.
This morning, one of the representatives of New
South "Wales placed before us certain figures ; but 1"
confess I was not able to follow that hon. gentleman ;
and, like the last speaker, when he finished his state-
ment I was in a greater fog than when he commenced.
There is no doubt that it would take a considerable
time for the hon. gentleman to instruct us successfully
up to the point to which he desired us to go. I did
not gather whether the hon. gentleman meant that
the whole of the customs were to be taken over by
the federal government, as well as all the public
works of the different colonies, or whether each
colony was to manage its own affairs as hitherto,
without reference to the federal government. In the
resolutions before us the word " customs" is used,
and no reference is made to excise. In the American
Constitution the word " excise" is introduced as
well as the word " customs." I do not know r , sir,
whether it is intended by you to include excise under
the word " customs." Excise is carried out in a
variety of ways in the several colonies, and in many
of them constitutes a very large proportion of
the public revenue. I presume that the word
" customs," as used in the resolutions placed before
the Convention, simply applies to the importation
of articles into one colony from another, or from
a foreign state. In reference to what is termed
" free-trade with the colonies," something has struck
me as most extraordinary in regard to this subject.
Now, what does free-trade with the colonies mean ?
Tip to the present time free-trade with the colonies
is the thing we have been trying to keep out. Eree-
trade with foreign countries we do not seem to care
about. Victoria has erected a barrier against all pro-
ductions except her own, and has taxed, not only the
raw material, but also the manufactured article ; and
a similar policy has been pursued by nearly all the
other colonies. It is the intention that this state of
things should be reversed, and that the imports of
the different colonies shall be free as between each
other ? "We have heard a good deal about loyalty in
this Convention. Almost every member has spoken
of his loyalty. Loyalty, however, does not seem to
be extended' to the mother country with regard to
her imports, and she is to be treated by these colonies
as a foreign country. It is to be hoped that when
such a proposal goes before the home Government
some objection will be taken to it. I could under-
stand that in dealing with foreign nations we should
put duties upon their goods, and I should expect that
we ourselves should be treated by them in the same way;


but when the mother country takes all our productions
without imposing the alighest duty it seems to me
not a very generous proposal that we should raise a
barrier against the productions of the mother country
and treat her as a foreign nation. That is very loyal
indeed; in fact, I am astonished at the loyalty of
this Convention. I am not going to inflict upon the
Convention my opinions with respect to loyalty; but
when I hear that we are to be deprived of the
Governor appointed by the Queen, that we are to
abolish the power of veto, and that w r e are not to
treat with the mother country upon fair and equal
terms as regards fiscal matters, I am inclined to ask
what hon. gentlemen think about their loyalty, and to
say that their loyalty is a sham, and nothing else. How
was I treated the other day? When walking down
Circular Quay, I happened to see some goods that
were imported, and some man said to me, “ That is
the effect of free-trade.” I said, “I am a free-trader” ;
to which he replied, “ You ought to be shot down,
and I would shoot you down if I had the opportunity.
I am a protectionist.” Is that the sort of conduct we
are to receive here because we have freedom of
speech and freedom of opinion ? Are free-traders
to be crushed down because
Mr. Gordon : It was a joke !
Mr. ADIIE DOUGLAS . It was not a joke as far
as I was concerned, for the person was very nearly
doing what he threatened—not shooting me down,
but striking me down.
Mr. Gordon : Absurd !
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS: I hear hon. members
talk about the House of Commons, and all that sort
of thing. How, many years ago I was in England,
and there was a case pending from the colony of
Tasmania—Hampton versus Eenton —in which the
colony had asserted certain rights, and an appeal
went home to the Privy Council. Upon that occasion,
when one of the Tasmanian counsel was arguing that
the Parliament of Tasmania had certain inherent
powers, the judge, either Sir Knight Bruce or Baron
Pollock, said, “ Show me your powers, Sir Erederick
Thesiger. You are confined within the four corners
of your Constitution Act.” The learned counsel had
been trying to compare the powers of the Parliament
of Tasmania with those of the House of Commons.
But who knows, as the judge asked, what the powers
of the House of Commons are ? It is only the good
sense of the House of Commons that keeps them
within any expression. We know that the whole
power of the English Constitution rests on what the
House of Commons may choose to interpret as the
constitution.
Colonel Smith : Hear, hear, it is an unwritten
law!
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS: Just what they say is
the constitution, is the constitution. We know that
the English Constitution was a very different thing a
few years ago from what it is now. The House of
Lords is virtually gone, the power of the Queen
is gone, and everything vests in the House of
Commons.
Mr. Eitz Gerald : The press has come up since !
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS: We shall have to carve
out our own laws ; and we shall have to take other
constitutions as a guide up to a certain point; but
when I look round and see the men who are as-
sembled here, I can have no doubt that there is a
sufficient amount of ability present to build up a
constitution which will tend to the greatness of the
Australian colonies, and which wall show the mother
country that, although Australia has been only a
century in existence, we are fast approaching "the
time when we shall be able to protect ourselves.
But, wdth many of those w r ho have spoken before me,
I hope that that day is far off. I am, however, quite
sure that the tendency of all our institutions, and of
everything connected with us, is of a democratic
character, and that sooner or later we must arrive at
a democracy. But as long as we are subjects of the
Queen, and hold our present position .towards the
mother country, I trust that the government of these
colonies will be vested in a governor-general, ap-
pointed by the home authorities, and that our local
governors will also, as far as possible, be appointed
in the same way. I have only given my ideas in
this way as a representative of a small section of the
Australian people ; but I come from an old colony,
and I believe that in many respects we have carried
out British institutions in their integrity. In the
colony of Tasmania we have found it exceedingly
advisable and beneficial that the Legislative Council
should have the power of amending bills in any way
that they think proper. If a large measure, containing
several small items to which the senate objects has
to be rejected in its entirety, the effect will be to
make the upper house a nonenity, because the house
of representatives would only have to put an item of
expenditure into a measure to practically deprive
the other house of all power with respect to it. I,
therefore, trust that the federal senate will have due
power, not only to exercise a veto, but also to amend
bills; provided always that some other method,
which would get over the difficulty in a proper
manner, is not devised to bridge it over. I shall not
detain the House longer. I think we have had from
hon. members as fine oratorical displays, and as good
a statement of the laws of Australia and of the
mother country, as one could get anywhere, and I
feel proud that in my latter days I have had the
honor of attending such an assembly. In my
younger days, when I first came to these colonies,
how different things were! When I see such an
assembly as this, I picture to my fancy what will be
the result in another fifty years. What a change
will there be in Sydney and Melbourne, and our
other cities ! As education extends, I think we may
be proud of our adopted country, and consider our-
selves as a united people, and members of the federal
government of Australia.
Mr. ABBOTT: In addressing myself to these very
important resolutions, it is not my intention to tread
upon the ground which has been already occupied by
hon. members in the very remarkable and able
speeches which we have heard. It appears to
me that on the present occasion we are like a
family who are making marriage arrangements for
their daughters, and it is the desire of every delegate,
as the parent representing the daughter, to make
the very best terms on behalf of the colony from
which he comes. I think it is our bounden interest,
in speaking for our colonies, to speak with no
uncertain voice in reference to what is proposed to
be done. There are those outside this Assembly,
and in this colony, who are opposed to federation,
and who have been raising up arguments against it,
but those arguments are not based on fact, or on a
true interpretation of these resolutions ; and when I
address myself to these particular people, I shall do
so more for the purpose of explaining the matter
with regard to our own colony than for the purpose
of giving any information or of leading to any con-
clusion with regard to the proposals now before us.
What struck me as the most remarkable of the
speeches to which we have listened were those
coming from the gentlemen representing Victoria, a
colony which has had protection for twenty-five years,
and the people of which maintain, as protectionists
always maintain, that if they are given protection
they Avill be able to build up their own industries,
and to defy the world to compete with them. How,
I claim that I am a protectionist, and I have always
argued that we cannot have protection in Hew South
Wales unless on the basis of federation. Victoria
has had protection now for twenty-five years. She has
had a market in every one of the Australian colonies,
and she has become the great manufacturing centre
of the whole of Australia; and is it not totally


opposed to protectionist principles for her delegates
to say, “If you want federation, you must give us a
guarantee that yon will maintain the manufactures
which for twenty-five years we have been building
up ” ? If that is the result of protection for twenty-
five years it almost makes me think that I have gone
on the wrong path ; but I feel that I have not gone
on the wrong path, and I believe that if New South
Wales is to have a protective policy at all, it can only
get it by federation. I claim that New South Wales
has a greater variety of raw material and of minerals
of all kinds than any of the other colonies in the
Australian group, and that if we had free-trade within
the boundaries of the Australian colonies, with
protection against the world, it would not take us
twenty-five years to draw from Victoria to Newcastle
and elsewhere most of her large manufactures. I
believe that honestly. The hon. member, Mr. Deakin,
has told us that his colony must have some guaran-
tees for the industries which they have taken twenty-
five years to build up. But what would be the use
of her protective institutions, if the ports of New
South Wales and of a few of the other colonies where
they now get admission, were closed against them ;
and what would be the use of protection to New
South Wales to-morrow if she had to build up her
industries at the expense of her own people ? Victoria
did not do that. Victoria built up her industries at
the expense of her Australian neighbours. Take my
own electorate, away up the river Darling. If I go
up there what do I find ? Do I find any New South
Wales machinery there ? Most certainly not; I find
Victorian machinery. Well, under federation, we
shall be able to compete with Victoria on equal terms,
I do not care that Victoria has had twenty-five years
start of us. With our resources, with our coal-
fields, we shall be able to fight Victoria, not only in
her own markets, but in the markets of Australia ;
and for that reason I maintain that we must federate
to get those markets. There is no use in building
up protection within a small colony like this. AVe
want larger fields, and we want to live in brotherly
love with our neighbours in Victoria, and elsewhere in
Australia. AVe want no guarantees here. Although
my hon. friend, Mr. Dibbs, says it is not, undoubtedly
the policy of this country, as voiced at the polls, is
free-trade. If it were not so, the President w r ould
not be in the position he occupies at the present
time.
Mr. Dibbs : The hon. gentleman knows it was not!
Mr. ABBOTT: I know that there is a majority on
the right of the Speaker in favour of free-trade.
That is all I know.
Mr. Dibbs : You know that it was “more popery
than fiscal! ”
Mr. ABBOTT : I know the result of the elections
gave the free-traders a majority. If it were not so
they could nothave carried on their policy. That being
so, why should not the hon. member, Mr. McMillan,
come here and say to Anctoria, “ You must give us a
guarantee for five or ten years that free-trade will
not be interfered with in New South AVales?”
What istheuse of askingforfederatiouonthosetermsF
To ask for mutual guarantees to allow interests to
remain as they are, and yet to federate for the
common interest! The idea is, to my mind, an
absurdity. It is a fortunate thing for this country
that we have had this Convention, meeting in the
way in which it has met, whether the results are
likely to be beneficial at the present time or not. It
is a fortunate thing for Australia that so many
public men meet on one common platform, and have
the opportunity of mingling with one another,' of
discussing publicly the affairs of Australia, and
privately, perhaps, local affairs. I think, Mr.
President, when this Convention concludes, whether
its results come to anything or not, we shall have
laid down a history in connection with this great
Australian movement, which I hope will come to a
safe and sound conclusion. I hope that we shall
find that your efforts, and those of the hon. member,
Mr. Gillies, will not be ineffective, but that good
results will come from our deliberations. I was
very much surprised to find my hon. friend, Mr.
Dibbs, point out that before anything could be done
we must settle the fiscal policy. How can we settle
the fiscal policy! How can each of the colonies
agree upon a common tariff ? It would be
absolutely impossible for them to agree upon a
common tariff at the present time if they all agreed
to gp for a policy of protection. But some of them
will not do that. Therefore, I maintain that it is
only by one Australian parliament that a common
tariff can be formed; and I do not think it is wise
to try to keep out or assume that we must keep out
of this federation until we can agree upon a
common tariff.
Mr. Dibbs : The hon. gentleman asks us to go in
for a free-trade tariff!
Mr. ABBOTT: Not until we provide the other
tariff. I do not think that has ever been proposed.
It has been proposed that our tariffs shall remain as
they are until the federal parliament shall pass a
tariff for Australia. Excepting one speaker, I do
not think any one has advocated any other proposal
than that the tariffs shall remain as they are until
the federal parliament shall pass a tariff for Austra-
lia. I do not see how it could be otherwise. As I
said before, how could there be a common tariff,
with the diversity of interests of each of the
colonies ! The federal tariff must be built up by
the federal parliament, and the existing tariffs must
be allowed to remain until that state of things comes
about. The hon. member said that in speaking in that
way, he was speaking the voice of New South
Wales, Well, I hope for the sake of the party with
which the hon. member is connected, that he is
speaking for New South Wales. It will show a
change of policy, at all events, from that Avhich
was voiced at the last general election, and that
the colony of New South Wales is prepared for this
change of tariff, which I am quite sure will be
brought about by a federal parliament. I have
heard a good deal of criticism with regard to the
Eederal Council. Many people thought New South
Wales acted unwisely in not entering into that body,
Victoria, again, is responsible for that.
Hon. Mesibeqs ; No, no !
Mr. ABBOTT ; I say, with a knowledge perhaps
not possessed by most people in this country, that
Victoria is responsible for New South Wales not
being, at the present time, represented in the Eederal
Council. I remember well, for I was in the govern-
ment at the time, and the hon. member, Mr. Dibbs,
will bear me out, that just about that time the Mel-
bourne Cup was run for, and members ran away to
it, with the result that when the division took place
the government were in a minority, and so the
Eederal Council had to do, from that day to this,
without the colony of New South Wales. What
has surprised me most of all are these dark hints
about a republican form of government. They
came from my hon. friend, Mr. Dibbs. I cannot for
the life of mo see what fault he, and gentlemen
holding his views, have to find with the existing
state of things.
Mr. Dibbs : I find no fault!
Mr. ABBOTT : Could they, under any form of
republican government, have greater liberty than
they have at the present time? Could they improve
the existing state of things on behalf of the people
of any one of these colonies if they had the most
republican form of government in the world ? Have
these gentlemen any of those complaints to make
which were made by the celebrated fifty-six men
who signed the Declaration of Independence ? As
an historical fact it is interesting to refer to that,


and to see what the complaints of those people were,
who were crying out for a change of government.
The history of the present king of Great Britain —
say these patriots in their Declaration of Indepen-
dence —
is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in
direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over
these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid
world.
He has refused his assent to lav s the most wholesome and
necessary for the public good.
Has that ever been the case since we have # had
responsible government? Have we ever had such
a complaint to make ? I admit that the Grovern-
ment of England at times have hesitated to pass
some measures ; but when they have been brought
into uniformity with the laws of the empire the
hesitation has ceased, and the measures have been
assented to. Take our own Divorce Bill, which has
been referred to. It was passed by this legislature,
and the assent of the Queen was refused on the
recommendation of the home government; but im-
mediately afterwards a divorce law which was passed
by the colony of Victoria, and which was brought
into conformity with the suggestions of the Secretary
of State, who was advised by the Crown law officers
of England, was assented to. And so it will be, and
has ever been, with regard to measures sent home to
England. Where they do not interfere with im-
perial rights or the laws of the empire, they have
been assented to. Another objection :
He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate
and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation
till his assent should be obtained, and when so suspended he
has utterly neglected to attend to them.
We have no such complaints as those. We do not find
the governors of these colonies assuming the position
of arbitrary monarchs. We find these men, whether
they are chosen from the liberal ranks of England or
from the conservative ranks, all conforming to the
democratic rules of government which are found in
these Australian colonies. Most certainly these
gentlemen, when they come out here, seem to realise
the fact that it is their duty to administer the laws
in accordance with the feelings of the people over
whom they have been placed. I might go on enu-
merating page after page of the reasons which caused
the American states to separate from Great Britain;
but I am not going to weary hon. members with
details, and I only refer to the matter for the purpose
of entering my most solemn protest against this notion
of republicanism which is growing up, I am sorry to
say, amongst a thoughtless class in this community.
I did not expect my hon. friend, Mr. Dibbs, in any
way to encourage that, and I am quite sure that he
will not encourage it.
Mr. Dines : The hon. member is misrepresenting
what I said ; that is all!
Mr. ABBOTT : In what way ? If the hon. mem-
ber says that I am misrepresenting him, I am open
to be corrected, and will not misrepresent him.
Mr. Dices : The hon. member is only creating a
bogey for the purpose of knocking it down; that is
wdiat he is doing !
Mr. ABBOTT: The hon. member, I think, tried
to create some bogeys for the purpose of knocking
them down. The hon. member told us that he w T as
going to throw some bomb-shells into this meeting.
Mr. Munro ; Without any gunpowder !
Mr. ABBOTT: The hon. member did throw the
bomb-shells ; but he forgot to attach to them the
fuse necessary to cause them to explode. With
regard to the defences, it has been asserted that we
desire to establish a standing army. You, Mr.
President, are largely responsible for the resolutions,
and anyone who could charge you with adesireto create
a standing army in these Australian colonies must be
absolutely blind to history, for I believe that you were
one of those who, so far back as 1859, submitted
resolutions to our own Legislative Assembly, which
w T ere absolutely opposed to any standing army being
kept in New South Wales. Under the most repub-
lican government in the world, do they not keep a
standing army in America, not only to quell their
internal disturbances, but also to prevent any aggres-
sion from outside ? That there is any danger of a
standing army in a country like this, where the people
are the masters of the rulers for the time being, 1 in
no way fear. The people at the polls themselves
will settle that matter, and although there may be a
military spirit growing up amongst our younger men,
I think that it is a volunteer spirit, and not a standing
army spirit. The first resolution clearly points out
that we are not to interfere with territorial rights ;
but what I want to be clear about in this colony of
New South Wales is that this expression means that
there is to be no interference with our Crown lands.
I know, and every member of the Convention knows
as well as I do, that it is not intended that the Crown
lands of any one of the colonies shall be interfered
with by the federal parliament; yet, this is a bogey
that has been raised up outside to frighten the people
of this colony into opposition to the proposed federa-
tion. In this country—at all events outside the city,
the people are most concerned about the settlement
of our Crown lands—the occupation and the acquisi-
tion of them—and nothing in this world, to my mind,
could more prejudice the proposal for federation than
to assert that our Crown lands are to be taken aw r ay
from us and given to those colonies which have no
Crown lands at all. I say it was never intended by
any of those who initiated this Convention that such
a state of things should be carried out, and, speaking
on behalf of this colony, I say that it is a state of
things that would not be tolerated for one moment.
I hope there will be no misunderstanding outside.
Our Crown lands are to be our own, and the Crown
lands of the other colonies will, I take it, be their
own. What surprised me —talking of Crown lands—
was the utterance of the hon. member, Sir James
Lee-Steere, that if the government of Western
Australia hands her customs duties over to the
federal government then she w r ould not have any-
thing with which to pay her debt or the interest on
that debt. Now, Western Australia has the largest
territory in the whole of the Australian colonies,
and I presume that Western Australia is not going
to allow that territory to remain as it is at the
present time. I jiresume that Western Australia
expects to lease or sell that land, and to construct
her public works out of the proceeds of it. I am
sure that the colonies on the eastern seaboard hope
that that will be one of the results of the responsible
government which has been so recently granted to
Western Australia. What is the use of their lands,
what is the use of their trying to carry out public
works, if they cannot at the same time get a popula-
tion to settle upon their lands ? In this colony we
have a public debt of about £46,000,000; we have
railways which are valued at £45,000,000, or nearly
£14,000,000 more than they cost. Now, people tell
us, u You are going to hand these over to the
colonies which have not got railways." I have not
heard any colony make any such proposal. I hope
that when the time comes the main trunk line will
be a federal railway, and that the rest of our rail-
ways will be worked by the colonies themselves. I
should like to see the colonies brought into inter-
course with one another by one line of railway of
one uniform gauge. Let it be a federal highway
from one colony to another, and, if necessary, sup-
ported by the federal government. But that is a
matter with which we shall have to deal hereafter.
Now, the borrowing powers of Australia must under
a federal government be wonderfully improved in
the old country. We have had rather sad rebuffs
lately ; but that has been a warning against exces-
sive borrowing, not to the particular colony which


was rebuffed, but to the whole of the Australian
colonies. In this colony we are fortunate in the
assets that we hold. We have besides our railways,
and one of the best securities in the Australian
colonies, namely, £13,000,000 due to us from the
conditional purchasers. That is why I wish to
impress on the conditional purchasers —who are
the mainstay, and are every day becoming more and
more the mainstay, of this country —that they are
not to be interfered with by any federal government,
but will be able to work out their own course in this
country. These men would be alarmed if they
thought their holdings were to be regulated by laws
passed by people in Victoria or South Australia,
who knew nothing of the conditions of land in this
country—they would be alarmed to think that such
a state of things would exist; but I think that they
will be perfectly satisfied when they find that they
are to control the administration of their own lands.
There are many matters which have been dealt with
to which I will not now refer at this late stage.
When we get into Committee, I hope that each of us
will be able to do our duty to our country, and in
doing that duty will also serve the interests of the
colonies which we represent, and will be able at the
same time to build up a strong federal government
which will command the respect of the world, and be
a credit to those who have initiated the movement.
My present impression is in favour of the state
rights. Of giving to the states equal representa-
tion and equal power with regard to money
bills ; and whatever we do with regard to money
bills we shall have to make the matter so clear
that there can be no misunderstanding hereafter.
Whether we determine that they shall not have
the power or that they shall have the power, it
ought to be determined in such clear language
that there can be no mistake and no confusion. I
can well understand these Victorian gentlemen, who
have had to fight their Legislative Council, being
alarmed at the notion of a second chamber having any
powers in these matters ; but I hope that we shall be
able to build up in this country a government which,
as I said before, will be a lasting blessing to the
people, and will realise the words of Wentworth —
who looks down upon us this evening from the picture
above —when it was supposed that a great inland river
was discovered in this colony in 1817. Mr. Oxley,
the Surveyor-General, reported to Governor Mac-
quarie that a great inland river had been found in
the colony, and Wentworth, writing on that occasion
and anticipating the results from the discovery of such
a great inland river, said :
What a cheering prospect for the philanthropist to behold
what is now one vast and mournful wilderness, becoming the
smiling seat of industry and the social arts ; to see its hills
and dales covered with bleating flocks, lowing herds, and
waving corn ; to hear the joyful notes of the shepherd, and
the enlivening cries of the husbandman, instead of the appall-
ing yell of the savage, and the plaintive howl of the warrigal;
and to witness a country, which, nature seems to have designed
as her masterpiece, at length fulfilling the gracious intentions
of its all-bounteous author, by administering to the happiness
of millions. What a proud sight for the Briton to view his
country pouring forth her teeming millions to people new
hives; to see her forming in the most remote parts of the
earth new establishments which may, hereafter, rival her old;
and to behold thousands who perish from want, within her
immediate limits, procuring an easy and comfortable sub-
sistence in those which are more remote, and instead of
weakening her power and diminishing her resources, effectually
contributing to the augmentation of both, and forming
monuments which may descend to the latest posterity,
indestructible records of her greatness and glory.
I am quite sure that every member of the Convention
vail agree with me when I express the hope that the
result of our work will be to realise the hopes of that
great patriot, William Charles Wentworth.
Mr. SUITOR: An old proverb says that homely
youths have homely wits. I look on myself as a
homely youth, and it is my misfortune never in my
life to have passed the boundaries of New South
Wales, except occasionally to visit Victoria. I have
had great pleasure in making those visits, and not
only pleasure, hut also a good deal of profit. I have
always found the Victorians very able dealers, and
willing to meet New South Wales people in a cordial
spirit as long as they could make anything out of
them. During the time this debate has been going
on much diversity of opinion has been apparent.
Between the hon. member, Mr. Barton, on the one
hand, and the hon. member Mr. Deakin, on the other,
I sometimes think it almost impossible to arrive at
any satisfactory conclusion. One of those gentlemen
seems to be at the north and the other at the south
pole of our discussion. As far as the debate has gone,
it has been an education to myself, and I hope the
end of it will be, supposing it results in anything
and I trust that something great will result from it
but putting the worst construction on it, this gather-
ing will, at all events, have bound the whole of the
colonies together in a bond of unity as far as our
statesmen are concerned. Through having been
brought together to discuss this great question now
we shall understand each other better in the future.
We shall feel it our duty to go hand in hand and
shoulder to shoulder into the great future that awaits
this country; but in doing that we must not have
Mr. Dibbs going around with his bomb-shells, as I
am afraid they may have an effect contrary to that
which we hope will result from federation. I should
like to have dealt with the question of the
guarantees which the Victorian delegates asked for;
but that has been well done by Mr. Abbott, who
wondered why people who have had twenty-five
years of protection, having had duties on- foreign
products of 10 per cent., 20 per cent,, then 25 per
cent., and ad valorem duties as high as 30 per cent.,
should require any guarantees. It appears to me,
when we consider what has been done in Victoria,
that those gentlemen who ask for guarantees for this
kind of thing to be continued longer, must have
begun to feel the evil of their ways, and are inclined
to cry “ peccavi.”
Mr. Dibbs : Don’t forget that New South Wales
has duties equal to 90 per cent, ad valorem in the
form of specific duties !
Mr. STJTTOR: At all events we, freetraders of
New South Wales, do not ask for any guarantee.
We are content to leave matters to the good sense
and justice of the whole Australasian colonies whose
representatives are met together in this Convention.
I must confess that my hon. friend, Sir Thomas
Mcliwraith, rather alarmed me, and I venture to
hope that his prognostications will not be fulfilled.
He says:
We must proceed on the supposition that there will be
free-trade among the colonies, and protection against the
world. I believe the opinion of the colonies in general is that
this would be a good national Australasian policy, and one in
which I thoroughly believe.
I hope not. I have nothing to say in reference to
the first one or two of the resolutions before us,
because I believe that the Convention will deal with
them in Committee in a spirit that will be just and
right to the various colonies. I should like to say a
few words with regard to the Ist and 2nd paragraphs
in the latter part of the resolutions. There is to be
a parliament, to consist of a senate and a house of represent-
atives, the former consisting of an equal number of members
from each province, to be elected
In this colony we have a legislative council which is
a nominee body, and I believe, sir, that you can claim
to have nominated the greater number of the gentle-
men now constituting that body, and no one can say
that you have ever misused your power in making
nominations. In 1880, when Mr. Heydon moved a
resolution in the Assembly asking that a sum of money
should be placed on the estimates for the payment of
members, you, Mr, President, made a speech in which,


as it appeared to me, you very properly laid down
What is the constitution of our Legislative Council.
In regard to that question you said :
We are not the parliament of the country. This thing
cannot be done without the consent of another and co-ordinate
branch of the legislature. ... Ido not admit any such
ground of distinction as that between the two houses. For
so long as we have two houses of parliament, and so long as
they form a part of the legislature of the country, it matters
not how they are constituted—they ought to be treated alike;
and if the members of the Assembly are entitled to payment,
the members of the Council are equally entitled to payment.
I have cause to fear that the reason why this motion was
introduced in this form is that the sum necessary for the
object shall be placed upon the estimates and voted in the
ordinary way and embodied in the Appropriation Bill so as to
give the Council no choice but to pass the Appropriation Act
or to throw it out. Now, I will not consent to any such
attempt as that to coerce the members of the Council. I will
not consent to any such attempt as that to get behind the
spirit of the law of the Constitution. If we are to change the
Constitution, if we are to pay members of parliament, I say
it must be embodied in a bill—but it is not so in this case—
introduced in the regular way; it must go to the other
House, be adopted there, and that House must have the
fullest opportunity of considering, amending, or defeating
the measure. And there is no other means by which it can
be fairly and properly done.
What I deduce from that is, that if it is thought that
such very large powers as these shall be exercised by
a nominee council in a colony like this, the upper
house of a federal parliament ought to have similar
powers vested in it. When we get into Com-
mittee I shall be glad to listen to arguments in a
dillerent direction. There is one matter which
I ought to mention, and that is, that the speech to
which 1 have referred was delivered on the Ist
April. Whether that had anything to do with the
tenor of the speech I cannot say. It has been hinted
that lay members ought not to discuss the question
of the judiciary. If I understand that speech of
yours, sir, and the policy it lays down, these colonies
will be under a governor-general. I suppose the
governor-general would, to a very large extent, have
the power of the Sovereign, and he might be
authorised to act as he is advised in regard to the
decisions of the court of appeal. The only diffi-
dence I feel in the matter is as to whether there is
sufficient good material in the colonies to establish a
court of that kind. In the old country where a
court of that sort is established it is composed of
men of great legal attainment, retired judges, all the
chief justices, and other high legal luminaries. I
think we ought to pause before we make up our
minds to prevent any Australian from appealing to
that which has always been held to be the highest
court in the empire. The 3rd resolution of the
second series has reference to the executive. I am
not quite sure that it is necessary to insist on the
retention of the words " such persons sitting in
Parliament." The practice, as I understand the
theory of the Constitution of England, is that the
Sovereign may summon to his councils any subject
whatever. Our constitutional practice, of course, is
very much against that ideal, for of late years it
has been considered absolutely necessary that gentle-
men who have been elected to a place in Parliament
shall be the only ones who ought to form a govern-
ment. If we make it imperative that the members
of the federal executive shall sit in Parliament, I
think one thing will have to be done, and that is, to
abolish the practice of compelling the members of
a government who have accepted offices of profit
under the Crown to go back to their constituencea
for re-election. It seems to me that it would be incon-
sistent with the provision that they must sit in Par-
liament to send them back to their constituents to
be re-elected. I have no more to say, except to ex-
press a sincere hope that the efforts of the Conven-
tion may be for the great good of Australia, and
that Ave shall be able before Ave part to formulate a
system which shall be acceptable to the whole of the
Australian colonies.
Mr. DONALDSON : I fully recognise that it is
very difficult at this late stage of the debate for any
delegate to speak without using, to some extent, the
same language as previous speakers have used. The
path that Ave have to tread upon is so limited and so
narroAV, as far as the resolutions are concerned, that
it is really a difficult matter for late speakers in the
debate to avoid taking advantage, as it were, of the
speeches of previous speakers. I believe there is a
general desire to close the debate this evening ; and
on that account I shall speak as briefly as possible in
the hope that I may not preclude others from speak-
ing. I understand that although the various parlia-
ments have affirmed the principle of the federation
of Australia, their delegates have full poAvers, or
rather they should direct all their thoughts to
criticising the proposals that may be submitted to us
from time to time. It is not at all likely that we have
come from our respective colonies Avith ideas and
resolutions cut and dried. "We have assembled here,
I believe, with the intention of receiving information
from each other, and of trying to draAV up a consti-
tution on such grounds as will prove acceptable not
only to this convention but to all the colonies.
When we look around and see the various resources
of the different colonies, and their various interests,
it is a most difficult task to frame such resolutions as
Avill meet with the approval of all, and not inter-
fere with any of their interests. Were Ito con-
fine myself to the resolutions on the business-
paper, I fear that there Avould not be a great deal
more for me to say. But the hon. member, Mr.
Abbott, who spoke only a short time ago, has certainly
introduced new matter into the debate, and, therefore,
I think I shall be only acting fairly in making some
reference to the neAV subjects which he discussed.
One refers to the lands of the colonies and the other
to the raihvays. On the subject of the lands lam
thoroughly in accord with the hon. ltiember, because
I believe it would be an impossibility for the federal
parliment to draw up such laAvs as would be suitable
to all parts of Australia. The different parliaments,
of course, must have the control of the public lands,
because a local parliament, understanding the re-
sources of the colony, the requirements of the people,
the soil and its conditions, will be far more able to
draw up fair and equitable laws such as will have the
effect of settling people on the land than could
possibly be done by the federal parliament. It is no
doubt also one of the state rights Avhich will occupy
a most prominent part perhaps in future discussions.
It is also a state right which the people of the respec-
tive colonies will take great care to preserve in future,
and prevent from being infringed either by the federal
parliament, or by any of its neighbours. The question
of the railways is, I believe, a debatable question. I
have not yet arrived at the conclusion that it is the
Avisest course for each colony to retain its own rail-
Avays. Of course I have not very definitely made up
my mind on this point, nor do I AA r ish in any Avay to
take a very strong view of the situation. At the
same time, it has been clear to me for a long while
that a system of competition has existed to secure
trade that does not legitimately belong to a colony,
and that differential rates have been imposed on the
railways to secure trade for particular ports. This,
I contend, has been a wrong course to pursue entirely.
It has been attended with this result: that Avhile tiro
taxpayers of a colony have had to meet the losses 011
those particular railways, the benefits have been
almost entirely for the feAv persons interested at the
ports or the people sending from the other end. This
system should, I think, be remedied. Under the
federal system Ave should have a uniform rate, and
the goods from the various parts of the colonies
Avould go to and fro, as intended, geographically.
'That, I maintain, is the proper course to pursue.
Why should people residing over the border of
another colony have differential rates made in their


favour in order that the trade shall be brought to a
port that does not belong to that colony ? A rebate
of as much as 25 per cent, has been allowed in many
instances to my knowledge, and greater rates have
been allowed in other places than those immediately
in my mind at the present moment. This system has,
I know, caused a great deal of the jealousy and ill-
feeling which exists between some colonies, because
it has raised the feeling that trade which properly
belongs to certain ports has been filched from them
by levying very low or, what may be called, differential
rates on the railways. I know it has caused much
heart-burning in the colonies where it is done, be-
cause the people generally do not feel that they are
being fairly treated when their goods, for only half
the.distance, are charged a great deal more than the
goods of persons living double the distance away.
This question, as I said before, is very debatable, and
will, I dare say, at a later stage, when the whole of
the resolutions have been dealt with, receive very full
consideration indeed. I know that there are very
great difficulties to be met in dealing with the
question, and I merely touch upon it now for
the purpose of directing attention to it. I hope,
at all events, that the evil will be remedied,
because we do not want to see one colony
running against another and endeavouring to
secure trade that does not legitimately belong to
it, and utilising its railways for that purpose. There
may be certain objections to the whole of the rail-
ways being handed over to the federal government.
It is a system of which we have had no experience up
to the present time. It cannot obtain in America,
because there no railways belong to the state; the
whole of the railways in that country belong to pri-
vate companies. Even there, however, it has been
found necessary within the last few years to pass an
inter-state railways act, preventing the various com-
panies from charging differential rates which might
operate to the injury of particular states through
which the railways run. I will say no more just now
upon that point. Another question, which is said to
have been the lion in the path —although I do not
concur in that view—relate to the form of govern-
ment. We have heard many able speeches in this
Convention, and none, I think, have been more able
than that delivered by Mr. Gillies yesterday, with
regard to the limitation of the powers of the senate.
When the hon. member, Mr. Gillies, was speaking,
my mind was carried back to the events of many
years ago, when the hon. member had an experience
in another country —I will not call it a state—which,
I believe, has led him to form the views he now holds
—and perhaps those of some of his colleagues in the
Convention —as to the unwisdom, if I may so call
it —of giving to the senate the powers contended for
by Sir Samuel G-riffith, with whom, I may say at once,
that I heartily concur. Nearly all the other speakers
—except those from Victoria —I refer now to mem-
bers of its Legislative Assembly —have been in favour
of a senate w r ith almost unlimited powers. I have
always held the opinion, Mr. President, that where,
as in the case of America, the two houses have co-
ordinate powers in other respects, it is a perfect
farce to restrict the power of the senate in dealing
with money bills. If both houses are elected by the
people, although one may be elected indirectly and
the other directly, w r hy should we prohibit the senate
from dealing in detail with measures which, all must
admit, are of the greatest importance to any country ?
If you take away from the senate the power of deal-
ing with the finances, you practically emasculate -it.
I do not wish to see a senate having powers such as
are claimed for some upper houses —merely those of
a recording or advising chamber. I would give them
greater powers than that, more particularly in the
case of a federal government, in which all the colonies
are not equally represented in the lower house. Take
the position of two of these colonies returning two-
thirds of the total number of members to the house
of representatives. Is it to be expected for a moment
that the weaker colonies would come under a consti-
tution containing such a provision? They would
prefer to remain in their present position, knowing
exactly what their powers were, instead of trusting
them to people who might exercise them to their
detriment. If you give to the senate the powers for
which some hon. members have most ably contended,
then none of the colonies would have the fear which
would otherwise exist in their mines,
Mr. Munbo : The two colonies would have to bear
two-thirds of the taxation !
Mr. DONALDSON: That depends upon what the
taxation would be. I am not now considering the
question of the taxation which might' be imposed. I
could name some classes of taxation which would
operate in the other direction. But the senate would
be quite able to see if any injustice were being
done to any particular class or colony for which
they were legislating. Is it to be supposed for
a moment that all the weaker colonies with the
larger colonies coming between them, would always
work in harmony to the detriment of the larger
ones? I do not believe for a moment that any
hon, member holding opinions contrary to my own
would for a moment entertain the idea of having
the larger colonies more strongly represented and
permitting of a possible abuse of power. With
regard to responsible government, it has been said
more than once, and by very able men, that it is now
on its trial. It has not succeeded to the extent that
many of its framers expected. I can give no better
instance than that afforded by some of the govern-
ments in these colonies. How uncertain they are ;
how unsafe in their position. Do we not see them
changing time after time ? The parliament of one
of ‘ these colonies, I believe, changed its ministry
three times in three years —perhaps more frequently
than that.
Mr. Gillies : Why did the hon. member com-
pliment Western Australia upon its anxiety to obtain
responsible government ?
Mr. DONALDSON: Because I considered that
form of government was a great deal better than that
then existing in the colony. I should like to go a
step further, and to place that colony in a still more
favoured position, if another form which commended
itself to me could be suggested. The hon. member,
Mr. Gillies, yesterday said there must be reason on
both sides, and that but for the existence of that
reason there could be no legislation at all. Im-
mediately after the hon, member made that state-
ment his arguments tended quite in the other direc-
tion. The hon. member claimed that this reason
might exist on the part of the house of representa-
tives ; but he w r as dead against its existence in the
senate. I followed the hon. member’s arguments
very closely, and I consider that upon this point he
was, at ail events, inconsistent. I should like to
make further reference to some portions of the
speech he delivered yesterday —a speech which I
admit was a very able one, although it contained a
great deal of matter with which I do not agree,
indeed, I doubt whether the hon. member agreed
with it himseif. I believe I should be the last man
in this chamber to say anything offensive to a fellow-
member, and as the words I have just used appear
somewhat strong, I beg to withdraw them. The
views the hon. member expressed yesterday were, .at
all events, inconsistent with a great many of the
views to which he has given expression during his
public career. I know a great deal of his opinions,
and no one could have been more consistent than
the hon. member has been. In fact his consistency
has led him to change his constituency more than once.
But he has ably and firmly held to his opinions,
and they have not been altogether in accord with
the opinions to which he gave utterance yesterday.


Another representative of Victoria asked for guaran-
tees as to the tariff. He desired that some guarantee
should he given that the federal parliament should
not be able to deal with any alterations of the tariff
for a given number of years, and, further, that
if any reductions were made in the duties they
should be gradual. I was rather surprised to hear
a request of that nature coming from Victoria.
If any such claim had been made at all, I think it
should have come from South Australia or Queens-
land.
Mr. Munro : It is coming from Queensland yet!
Mr. DONALDSON : No, I think not; although
I have objections to the tariff, which I may presently
point out. The hon. member, Mr. McMillan stated
this morning that the total customs duties collected
in the Australian colonies amounted to something
over £8,000,000 per annum. We must take into
consideration also the large amount —we have no
reliable information as to what it really is, but it
is probably £500,000 which is collected upon
goods passing overland from one colony to the
other. If this were taken away we should have to
increase the duties on goods imported from other
countries to make up the usual amount of revenue
from that source. What further guarantee can Mr.
Deakin require ? We cannot do with less customs
duties than the amount stated by the hon. member,
Mr. McMillan, this morning, and we believe that they
will probably have to be increased, particularly if
the statement of Mr. McMillan be correct, that we
shall require to spend something over £2,000,000
upon the management of the federal government.
I am sorry that the hon. gentleman did not give full
information as to the way in which he arrived at the
conclusion that such an amount wmuld be required.
How r ever, I will assume that his statement is correct,
and that the federal expenditure will amount to
£2,000,000. Therefore, a considerable amount will
have to be made up by each of the colonies, because
none of them at the present time have a surplus.
It is evident that the extra amount required will
have to be made up from extra customs duties.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Some expenses will be
saved to the different colonies !
Mr. DONALDSON: No doubt that will be the
case, but it will not amount to much.
Mr. McMillan : There will bo the interest of the
debt incurred for defence !
Mr. DONALDSON: If time permitted, I would
go into the question of the interest on the public
debt; but assuming that the hon. member, Mr.
McMillan, was right, it is clear that a very large
extra sum will have to be made up by means of tax-
ation through the customs. When that is added to
the amount already received from customs, that will
mean a very large measure of protection to the
whole of Australia. The hon. member, Mr. Deakin,
said later on, that the people of Victoria were not
afraid, that they were quite willing to enter into any
competition. Competition with whom ? Compe-
tition with other colonies which have not had time to
establish their industries. Lor twenty-five years
manufactures have been established in Victoria, and
they now produce to such an extent that they wish
to have the other ports of Australia thrown open to
them. By that means they would have a very large
field for their manufactures, and they certainly would
have almost a monopoly over some portions of Aus-
tralia, where local manufacturers could not compete
against them. We know that large manufacturing
establishments are able to produce at a much lower
price than are small manufacturers. Lor that
reason, what hope would there be for the manu-
facturers of Queensland in competing against those
of Victoria ? Not the slightest. In fact, Victoria
or New South Wales, as the case may be, with their
great populations and great demand for manufac-
tured goods, would be able to maintain the industries
already established, and to extend them, certainly to
the detriment of the other colonies. Whilst lam as
anxious as any man can possibly be to have the Aus-
tralian colonies federated, it must be done on such a
basis that at all events justice will be done to all.
If Queensland or South Australia lose through this
system, they must have some quid pro quo. What
that is to be is not for me to say at present, but it
will have to be determined during the sittings of this
Convention. We shall have to consider what con-
cessions can be given to compensate for the losses
which will be incurred. I do not speak for the
manufacturers of Queensland alone. lam sure that
the merchants will also be subjected to very great
competition if we establish intercolonial free-trade.
The farmers will be subjected to the greatest
amount of competition. The coal-miners of Queens-
land will also suffer severely. These people have
not to fear the competition of other parts of
the world. The competition they have to fear is
purely intercolonial. I can quite understand that
when the question of a federal constitution is sub-
mitted to people whose interests are affected in this
way, they will look cautiously at the matter and say,
“ What are we going to receive,” just as the man in
the play says, “ Where do I come m?” Then, again,
with regard to the collection of these duties. We
will assume that the amount received at present is
£8,000,000. £2,000,000 would have to be deducted
for the federal government, and the balance of
£6,000,000 would have to be distributed amongst the
various colonies. Of course the collections are not
made per head of population. They are made upon
the consumption of the goods coming to various
ports. But when it comes to the distribution of the
money, how can that be done ? In my humble
opinion there is no practicable way out of the diffi-
culty except to distribute the money per head of
population.
Mr. Muneo : Hear, hear !
Mr. DONALDSON: Now, even with the high
duties paid in Victoria at the present time, Victoria
does not contribute taxation within £1 per head of
the amount of taxation paid in Queensland.
Mr. Munro : We pay more than £3 per head !
Mr. DONALDSON ; The amount contributed by
Queensland is nearly £4 10s. per head. The exact
figures are as follows: —Victoria, £3 7s. lid. per
head; Queensland, £1 7s. 4d. per head; while
Western Australia pays £4 10s. 6d. per head. New
South Wales pays the lowest amount per head, that
is £2 Bs. Gd.; but she derives a very large amount of
revenue from land sales.
Mr. Munro : According to these figures Queens-
land has more protection than Victoria !
Mr. DONALDSON ; Victoria has extensive manu-
factures of her own which supply the local market,
and consequently there is not so much revenue de-
rived through the customs as in the other colonies
where so much manufacturing is not carried on.
Mr. Ltsh : Eaw material also comes in free in
Victoria!
Mr. DONALDSON ; Certainly that is the case,
and consequently a large amount of revenue is not
derived from the customs.
Mr. Munro : But all that would be altered by the
federal tariff!
Mr. DONALDSON: We shall have to alter a
great deal. I may say that the figures which I have
quoted represent the revenue derived from taxation,
and not from customs duties only. If I could give
the figures separately, it would put Victoria in a still
more unfavourable position in the argument, because
there is a large amount of direct taxation received
there which does not appear separately in the return
from which I am quoting. Then there is also the
amount derived from the land-tax.
Mr. Munro : That only amounts to £130,000!


Mr. DONALDSON: The taxation per head re-
ceived in South Australia amounts to £2 4s. 3d.; in
Tasmania, £2 16s. lOd.; in New' Zealand, £3 Bs. I
venture to say that Queensland and Western Aus-
tralia contribute a great deal more per head to
customs revenue than any other colony, because they
have a larger number of men in those colonies in pro-
portion to women and children than in the older
colonies; and when the distribution takes place under
the federal government it will have to be based upon
the total population of the colonies. Now, under
such a system as that, Victoria would only contribute
to the general fund £2 per head, and it would
receive, when the funds were distributed, £3 per
head, whereas Queensland, which would contribute
£4 10s. per head, would only receive back £3
per - head. I only give these as supposititious
figures; but still I am sure that the principle of
distribution would not act fairly. I agree with the
hon. member, Mr. Wrixon, that committees should
be appointed by the Convention to go into these
various questions, so that we might be able to obtain
exact information. I did hope that some such
information would be placed before the Convention.
While Mr. Coghlan has placed before us a very able
report, it is only brought up to 1889. I should
have liked to see the figures brought up to the 30th
June last, and that information could certainly have
been obtained in some of the colonies. In collecting
the customs duties, and in distributing the unex-
pended portion, there would be no control on the
part of the local parliaments. It is an unknown
amount that would be given back to them, and then
all the colonies will have to impose additional
taxation in order to enable them to restore their
balances. Of course I do not raise this question for
the purpose of placing an insuperable barrier in the
way of federation, I merely bring it forward for
the purpose of discussion, so that difficulties which
are always met with in a matter of this kind may be
removed. I am sure that reasonable men will be
able to get round such difficulties as these, and to
get round them with moderation. I find that I have
gone far beyond the limits I expected when I rose
to speak; but I can assure the Convention that I
yield to no man in a desire as an Australian to see
these colonies brought into one great harmonious
whole, to see created an Australian national spirit.
I am sure we can accomplish this. We only want
to pull together, and try to forget any little selfish
interests that may lie behind our views; and if we
do this I am confident we shall be able to accom-
plish that which I am sure we all desire —the
federation of Australia.
The President : I understand that no other
delegate intends to address the Convention. If any
gentleman has such an intention it will be con-
venient in furthering the good order of business to
make that intimation at once. If it is not made I
shall conclude that there is no such intention. In
that case I would suggest this course of procedure
from this point. I purpose myself treating these
resolutions, as nearly as 1 can, in the same manner
as I should treat the second reading of a bill; and I
think I shall conform to the spirit of parliamentary
usage by taking that course. I therefore, having
submitted them, will reply, assuming that that privi-
lege is granted to me, and then move that the
Convention resolve itself into Committee to consider
the resolutions in detail. I think that will fulfil my
intimations when I submitted them, and I think it
will be found the most convenient course, and the
one in spirit most in accordance with parliamentary
usage. Understanding that that course is assented
to, 1 would now ask some hon. member who does
not intend to speak to move the adjournment of the
debate, in order to give way to my reply in the
morning; I can hardly suppose that that hon.
gentlemen would expect me to reply now. If the
adjournment of the debate is carried, I shall,
to-morrow morning, ask the Vice-President, Sir
Samuel Griffith to take the chair, and from my
place on the floor I shall offer such remarks as I
deem necessary.
Motion (by Mr. Macdonald-Paterson) agreed
to :
That the debate be now adjourned until to-morrow.

FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.
EIGHTH DAT’S DEBATE.
Debate resumed on resolutions proposed by Sir
Henry Parkes (vide page II).
Sir HENEY PAEKES, in reply: In my first
words, if I may venture without offending the sense
of self-respect, I would offer my most unqualified
congratulations to the distinguished men, some of
whom .have come from so great a distance to attend
this Convention. I think I may fairly congratulate
hon. gentlemen on the close adherence to purpose,
the lucid statement, the absence of all collateral
issues, and the sense of public duty which have
characterised the speeches in this debate up to the
present time. If there is any exception to that high
rule of debate I know that what I have to say this
morning will have nothing to do with it. I shall
brush it away as I would a cobweb or any other
offensive substance which obscured the light. We
are not assembled here to bandy words about the
site of the federal city; we are not here to prescribe
a federal tariff; and we might just as well speak of
determining the organisation of the federal army or
of fixing its headquarters. "We are here for one
single object, which has been defined at every stage
throughout our proceedings, and that object is to
lend our assistance one to another, as best we may,
to frame a scheme for the constitution of a federal
government. I think that is the only object to
which we can properly give our attention, and it
gratifies me beyond measure that there has been such
a consistent adherence to the consideration of it. I
think the seven delegates from the youngest colony
deserve our special attention. They have travelled
a journey which would have deterred most persons
from entering upon it even a score of years ago, and


they came here at the earliest opportunity to assist
us. I also think that the prime minister of that
young colony, the Hon. John Forrest, deserves our
special congratulations on the frank, manly speech
he made to us, and the broad spirit of sympathy with
our object which inspired that speech; and, I "think,
if I might go on without making some invidious dis-
tinction, that there are several other hon. gentlemen
who specially have contributed valuable assistance to
us in the debate which has taken place, a debate, I
venture to say, which in its lofty character and its
fruitful contribution to the end we have in view,
must be gratifying as well as satisfying to every mind
amongst us. Now, I am not going to travel far in
a direction such as that I have ventured upon ; but
I will endeavour to deal with the object we have in
view, in the light of the very instructive debate which
we have so far had upon the subject. I was very
sorry to hear one or two of the Western Australian
delegates express a kind of reserved intention
that their colony might not enter into this federa-
tion. I think something might be said for the
sacrifices that must be made by the larger colonies
as well as by the smaller ; and I think it is right,
after what has been advanced on the part of others,
that I should endeavour, in the fewest possible words,
to state my view of the position which the colony of
New South Wales occupies in this Convention, and
in the prospect of the work which we are anxious to
join in consummating. If by any chance, and I do
not disguise from myself that there is that chance,
the disaster should fall upon us of coming to no
agreement, I, for one, feel that New South Wales
can afford to stand alone as well as any colony of the
group. Our position is this: At the close of last
year we had a population of 1,170,000 souls, and,
what is of much more importance, the elements of
that population were of that character that our pro-
gressive increase is assured against that of any of
the other colonies. For example, the percentage of
our increase during the last twenty years was 3015,
as against the next highest, that of "Victoria, 22 61.
We then have a population which has proved itself full
of resource, and which has the element of increase in a
higher degree than that of any population of any other
colony of this group. Last year we had a revenue
of £9,063,397. In point of private wealth, probably
the most subtle and the most convincing test of all
of a nation's happiness, we stood ahead of all the
colonies, and ahead of the civilised world. What I
mean, so that there shall be no mistake, is that if
the private wealth, which is considerably over
£400,000,000, were distributed over every unit of the
population, it would give us, if every person, including
the person Avho has not £5 or 55., had an equal dis-
tribution of this wealth, a higher degree of private
wealth than that possessed by any other Australian
colony, and a much higher degree of private wealth
for the units of the population than that possessed
by any nation in the wide world. Our private wealth
would give to each inhabitant the sum of £366.
Now, the next colony—that of "Victoria—does not
nearly approach that sum. If we go to the great
nations of the world—and I will take three of them—
the private wealth of the United Kingdom only gives
£249 per inhabitant; the private wealth of France
only gives £2lB for every inhabitant; the private
wealth of the United States only gives £240 for
every inhabitant. Then we have still unalienated,
and not even in the process of alienation, land
amounting to 152,282,034 acres, and with that bound-
less wealth, which I state is the result of our civilised
society, we have our vast mineral wealth, combining
illimitable coal-mines, and illimitable mines of iron,
and we have our other great resources, which I have
not time to dwell upon, and, to crown all, we have
only the responsibility of 700 miles of coast out of
8,500 miles. So that, if we do not come to any
agreement, and we have each to pursue the path of
separate nationhood, we have no fear of holding our
own. I think it is quite right that I should state
this much as to the position of New South "Wales,
because circumstances may arise which will render it
impossible for New South "Wales to enter into this
federation. I, for one, as I have testified, am full of
zeal for this federation ; but I must remember that
that there are sacrifices which, if they cannot be
made by a small population, certainly cannot be made
by a large population. "We cannot consent to be
tied or linked inseparably to any body of states which
manifest a selfish desire not to deal in an equitable
and just spirit with the whole federation. Having
said this much, and said it, I hope, in no mincing
terms, I trust I shall not be misunderstood as lacking
in any degree in zeal to bring about this federation ;
but, for it to be entered upon—and it cannot be
entered upon except with the free consent of the
free people of these colonies —for it to be entered
upon with any prospect of success, the people of
the large colonies as well as the small must be
secured in their unalienable rights. Now, I am
tempted, at the risk of possibly being accused of per-
forming an unnecessary task, to ask what really is
government? Government, I apprehend, on any
just, honest, not to say any philosophical basis, is a
contrivance which is found necessary in a community
of men to protect their rights, and property, and their
liberty, to enforce their laws, and to suppress crime ;
and whatever form this government assumes, the true
principle is to call upon the people for whom this
government is necessary, in the form of taxation, for
just such sacrifices as may be necessary to support it.
I am one of those who hold it to be a fundamental wrong
to impose burdens upon a free people for any purpose
whatever than the purpose of sustaining necessary
institutions under a settled government; and in that
case the taxes should be raised in the manner most
consistent with liberty, the manner which will least
interfere with the free actions of the citizens, and the
manner which will be least oppressive as a pecuniary
burden. Now, in these colonies we have, to all
intents and purposes, the institutions of government
as perfect as in any part of the world. I do not
admit that the government of England is more perfect
than ours, or that it works more to the advantage of
the people. I certainly do not admit that the govern-
ment of the American states is more perfect than ours,
or that it works more to the advantage of the people,
of that great commonwealth ; and, certainly, I cannot
admit that the government of any European state is
more perfect than ours. If, then, we wanted merely
government, we have it in a form corresponding with
that with which we have grown up from the cradle,
which we have learned to venerate, and which has
worked efficiently and well for the good of every sec-
tion of our population. Why, then, it may be asked
by some, but not by many, I should think, do we
seek to create another government? I shall
endeavour in a few words to answer the question I
put. We seek to create another government,
because we have arrived at a time when we have
found by many telling circumstances that these
separate governments, however efficient and satis-
factory they may be in working out the internal
affairs of the respective colonies, are not adequate for
the larger duties which now devolve upon us as an
Australian people. I will endeavour to point out how
it is that these governments cannot work out the
destiny of Australia from the point at which she has
arrived by her own enterprise, her own foresight, her
own industry, and her own never-failing energies.
There are a number of things which no one of the
separate governments can by any possibility do, and
those things are amongst the highest objects of
government. The separate governments cannot by
any possibility efficiently conduct the defence of
these Australian colonies. It is no use for me to
attempt to argue this subject, because I apprehend


that gentlemen around me will readily admit it. The
ground has been gone oyer frequently. It has been
gone over by men possessing an intimate knowledge
of the subject, and a very forcible and lucid power in
explaining that knowledge; but I may be pardoned
the assertion that it is simply impossible for the
defence of these colonies to be conducted in the
future on any other than a federal basis. This brings
me to the question of whether forces for the military
defence of this country are necessary. Those
who have watched my course in public life must
know, everybody must know, that I am one
of those who think that no single unit of the
human family should be employed as a soldier
unless it is necessary so to employ him, especially
in a new country, where nature has to be sub-
jugated, where the path of industry lies open on every
hand, inviting every able-bodied man ; the worst use
we can make of a man is to employ him as a soldier;
and anybody who supposes that I have held any other
doctrine at any period of my life must be woefully
mistaken. At the time of the Crimean war I was
amongst the very first men in all Australia who
hailed the volunteer movement, I was amongst the
very first who expressed accord with it. It is more
than thirty years —I think fully thirty-four years —
since I carried in the legislature of this country a
series of resolutions in favour of the country being
defended by her own sons, and now I hold those
views as I did in my youth. But I have learnt that
it is a delusion and a dream to suppose that because
this queen land of Australia lies surrounded by
peaceful seas we are not likely to suffer aggression.
I do not need history to teach me, a fair knowledge
of human nature teaches me, that at a time of war
there will be plenty of wolves to find out that some
lamb or other has muddled the stream —plenty of
persons to pick a quarrel with the most inoffensive
of states. Beyond all that, I do not think that we
are ever likely to suffer from any of the forms of
warfare such as have been known to our forefathers.
But I think it is more than likely, more than probable,
that forms of aggression will appear in these seas
which are entirely new to the world, and I have not
forgotten that it was a saying of one of the pro-
foundest thinkers on human affairs that probably ever
lived —the first Napoleon—that if the Chinese nation
ever learnt European arts, the art of ship-building and
the art of navigation —they would be strong enough
to conquer the world. I am not one of those who
are frightened or in any way induced to forsake the
path to which my judgment directs me by being told
that this is a visionary dream. I firmly believe
that that marvellous nation is awakening to all the
realities of modern civilisation. "We have evidence
abundant on all hands that the Chinese nation and
other Asiatic nations —especially the Chinese —are
awakening to all the powers which their immense
population gives them in the art of war, in the art of
acquisition, and all the other arts known to European
civilisation, and it seems to me —and, non-professional
man as I am, I venture to throw it out —that if we
suffer in this direction at any time, it will not be by
the bombardment of one of our rich cities —it will
not be by an attack upon our sea-borne commerce—
it will not be by any attempt to lay us under a ran-
som to protect our property and our lives, but it will
be by stealthily, so far as movements of this kind can
be made stealthily effecting a lodgment in some
thinly-peopled portion of the country, where it would
take immense loss of life and immense loss of wealth
to dislodge the invader. I think that the new form
of warfare from which Ave may suffer is almost cer-
tain to take that form, and I venture to say that the
progress of events during the next few years will
convince many that I am not suggesting this form
without good reason for believing in its A T alid proba-
bility. I therefore think that in this question of
defence alone it will be well for the smaller colonies
to consider how much they have at stake. "With our
great Avealth, with our great population, with more
of the elements of a nation than any other colony,
except our sister Victoria, we have only 700 miles of
coast to defend ; but that is not the case with the
larger colonies ; and that they are liable to have to
secure their defence, I think, must be self-evident
to any one who will calmly think on the subject.
In connection with this question of defence I
may as well hint at Avhat most of the delegates
must know, that amongst the powerful parties
in the mother country —and the feeling in this
particular respect, is spreading from that party to
others —there is a very strong conviction that the
money of the heavily taxed citizens of the United
Kingdom ought not to be expended in the defence
of Australian citizens who are so much better able
to defend themselves. That forms an article of the
political faith of one section of the political life of
England, that no portion of the revenue contributed
by the poor struggling people of England should be
expended in supporting the defence of these distant
colonies. How far that feeling may come into play
in future it is not for me, nor is it for any one else
here, to foresee; but it is not likely to disappear
from the region of English politics. It is not likely
to grow weaker, but it is likely to grow more power-
ful. I asked and tried to answer the question just
now, what really is the very nature of government,
its essential conditions and its essential functions ?
it is an organism, as I have tried to explain, for pro-
tecting each individual citizen in the undisturbed
possession of his property, in the undisturbed poses-
sion of his liberty, and from my point of view the
expense of that government ought to be defrayed in
the easiest manner and only to the extent which is
necessary for that purpose, and that taxation is un-
justifiable for any other purpose whatever. But we
are met here to try to frame a government suitable
for the altered conditions of all Australia—a federal
government which should possess the confidence of
all, would be likely to work for the benefit of all,
and which would be powerful enough to efficiently
do the work which lies to its hand. If I am asked
what there is for a federal government to do, I will
endeavour to ansAver the question. They have to
undertake the defence of Australia, which I con-
tend cannot be conducted by the separate states.
They have to construct an Australian tariff which if
Ave federate cannot be touched by the separate states.
They have to conduct the intercommunication of the
colonies. Ido not mean by this that in every in-
stance, or perhaps in any instance they are to take
over the raihvays ; but they must regulate the rail-
ways, and probably construct one or more great
arteries for the purpose of improving and establish-
ing proper intercolonial intercourse. Beyond that
they have to undertake on behalf of Australia the
intercourse with other parts of the world. They
would have a power, a Avide-spread influence, which
no one of the colonies could ever hope to have, or
even to approach, and they would have to take in
charge the privileges and the rights and the mani-
fold interests of Australia in connection with the
ocean that surrounds Australia, which, again, no one
colony can do anything to promote. They would
have to carry out all the efforts to effect all the
higher ends of nationality, and if I may quote the
expression, a very happy expression, used by the
hon. member, Mr. Eitzgerald, the other afternoon,
they would have to protect the colonies, one from
another, which would be no light portion of the
duties of a federal government. NOAV, this consti-
tution which we are called upon to endeavour to
frame, can never be framed unless its merits
commend it to the acceptation of the free peoples
of these colonies. It is of no use losing sight of
that fact. One of the delegates from Western Aus-
tralia said that they could never face the people of


that country if they did not take special steps to
safeguard the interests of that colony. How does
he suppose we could face the 1,250,000 free men and
women of New South Wales if we did not take
the necessary steps to safeguard their interests and
liberties ? We ought never to lose sight of the
fact that in every instance nothing can be done in
the arduous work Ave are trying to do unless the
merits of the work we perform are so self-evident
that Ave can secure the support of the free
people we represent. I, for one, am not
prepared for any transcript of American institu-
tions. I, for one, utterly disbelieve that Ave
can do better than to adhere to the broad lines
of the British Constitution. And when I have
heard gentlemen arguing on some supposed likeness
between the senate Ave seek to create and the senate
of the United States, I have been amazed. The two
bodies —the body that is in existence, I will say that
august body, the senate of the United States, and
the body we are seeking to create—are essentially
different bodies for different purposes. The senate
of the United States is really the great executive
power of America. It is a body possessing such
poAvers that I doubt, so far as I have listened to this
debate, if they are fully known—certainly they are
not fully known to me —to many of the gentlemen
Avho have spoken on the subject. I am tempted,
though somewhat reluctantly, to give my own expe-
rience of the senate of the United States. In the
year 1882 I went to America. I was at that time
Prime Minister of NeAv South Wales, and I held
commissions from the G-overnment of Victoria, the
Government of Queensland, and the G-overnment of
New Zealand to try to negotiate with the authorities
at Washington, first for a reduction of the duties on
imported wool, and secondly, for a subsidy towards
the trans-Pacific mail service. I was at Washington
several days, and I had intercourse with the Secretary
of State, Avith that very able man the permanent
under-Secretary of State, Mr. Bancroft Davis, with
the President, and with a large number of members
of Congress. I make this intimation as a preface to
what I once witnessed, in order to give you, as it
Avere, a cameo of my personal knowledge of the
working of the senate of the United States. I was
introduced to Mr. Senator Ferry, the Chairman of
the Committee of the Senate on Post Offices. I
believe hon. members know that the whole business
of the United States Senate is conducted by com-
mittees. For instance, if a message arrives from
the President, it is at once referred, without debate,
to the committee sitting upon that subject, say on
finance, and it is not until that committee reports
that the senate takes into discussion even the Presi-
dent s message. Well, I was in one of the rather
sumptuous ante-rooms of the Capitol, in conversation
AAuth Mr. Senator Ferry. After I had left the
gallery of the senate, which was crowded Avith
visitors, including a large number of ladies, and
while I Avas in conversation Avith Mr. Ferry, a
messenger came to him, a bell rang, he had to leave
me, and at once go into the senate chamber ; every
man and woman were at once ejected from the
galleries, the doors were closed and locked, and the
senate sat in perfect secrecy. The most important
business of the senate of the United States is con-
ducted in absolute secrecy, Avith the press excluded,
visitors excluded, and the doors closed and locked.
Lnder the circumstances I have explained I Avit-
nessed this operation on one of these occasions.
N OAV, we have a gentleman engaged in the parliamen-
tary life of this colony who a few years ago asserted
in his place in Parliament that if the free-traders
ttempted to hold a meeting with closed doors, his
friends would smash the doors open, and about a
Aveek ago he stated, in an address to his constituents,
that if this Convention had decided to sit Avith
closed doors the people would have smashed the
doors open. Well, this great body, this august body
in the United States, transacts its material business,
its most important business—the business which is
so important that they will not allow the public to
see how it is done—with closed doors, in absolute
secrecy, and the citizens of the United States have
never yet, as far as I know, attempted to smash
the doors open. We do not want a body like that.
I think this Convention is not disposed to create
a body of that character, and with those powers, nor
are we about to create a senate to perform execu-
tive duties. AA r e seek under this name “senate,”
which however unsatisfactory it may be stands in
the place of a better, and no better has been sugges-
ted —we seek to create as lofty, as dignified, an upper
chamber as we can, and we seek to create it as nearly
on the British model as we can. But we find that
we cannot do that literally. Our house of peers,
I need not say, has grown up through many epochs
of revolution, of trial, of popular change, until it has
assumed the present very influential form which it
now occupies in the Constitution of England. We
cannot create a body like that, and we must have
resort to some device or other to supply those ele-
ments of moral and just conservatism, which I, for one,
admit a senate ought to possess. Remember, the
words 1 used are, “ Those elements of moral and just
conservatism.” I mean those elements arising from
experience, from matured judgment, from public
probity, from steadfastness of purpose, and from
the trust which is reposed in certain individuals by
the growth of time, and I know of no other kind of
conservatism in a community like ours. lam
tempted to read, if hon. gentlemen will pardon me, a
short passage from Mr. Gladstone on the English
Constitution. Mr. Gladstone of late years has taken
up a position which has called into existence very
acute, and in some instances fierce, antagonisms to
his course in public life. But lam not referring to
Mr. Gladstone as a party leader. lam not seeking
to use his authority as that of a party leader ; but I
use his authority as that of a man who has been close
upon sixty years in the House of Commons —for it
is close upon sixty years now, if not quite sixty
years, since he took his seat for the first time as
member for Newark. Forty years ago, the most
acute judge of human nature at the time, the
Chevalier Bunsen, described Mr. Gladstone as the
most intellectual man in all Europe. I think I
might say even now, with all the fierce antagonisms
which his later conduct has awakened, both sides of
the political life of England are proud of his figure
amongst them. Well, Mr. Gladstone has described
what the English Constitution is :
More, it must be admitted, than any other, it leaves open
doors which lead into blind alleys, for it presumes more boldly
than any other the good sense and the good faith of those
who work it.
The success of any constitution framed by man, the
success of every constitution, call it what you may,
must depend upon the good sense, self-restraint, and
good faith of those who work it. He goes on :
If, unhappily, these personages meet together on the great
arena of a nation’s fortunes, as jockeys meet upon a racecourse,
each to urge to the uttermost, as against the others, the power
of the animal he rides ; or as counsel in a court, each to pro-
cure the victory for his client, without respect to any other
interest or right, then this boasted constitution of ours is.
neither more nor less than a heap of absurdities.
How true it is ! The British Constitution has worked
more successfully, than has any other in the world,
and its whole working depends upon the aptitude of
the patriotic men who have taken a leading part in
working it. Let them belong to whatever party, in
every age, they have exhibited a higher sense of the
interests of the nation to which they belong, and of
the importance of good government, than of any
party conflict.
The undoubted competency of each reaches even to the
paralysis or destruction of the rest.


The writer then proceeds to give instances of bow,
notwithstanding its admitted power, the constitution
might work all kinds o£ absurdities.
The House of Commons is entitled to refuse every shilling
of the supplies. That House, and also the House of Lords, is
entitled to refuse its assent to every bill presented to it. The
Crown is entitled to make 1,000 peers to-day, and as many to-
morrow. It may dissolve all and every parliament before it
proceeds to business ; may pardon the most atrocious crimes;
may declare war against all the world ; may conclude treaties
involvingunlimited responsibilities, and even vast expenditure,
without the consent—nay, without the knowledge of Parlia-
ment. And this not merely in support or in development,
but in reversal of policy already known to, and sanctioned by
the nation.
Then, again, he says :
But the assumption is that the depositories —
I invite the attention of the delegates to these words.
that the depositories of power will all respect one another,
will evince a consciousness that they are working in a
common interest for a common end, that they will be possessed
together with not less than an average intelligence, of not
less than an average sense of equity and of the public in-
terests and rights. When these reasonable expectations fail,
then it must be admitted the British Constitution will be
in danger.
Now, in our work we shall necessarily have to im-
pose definitions, limits, and restrictions; but they
ought to be of such a nature that the body itself,
when once fairly launched on the sea of life, will be
enabled to respond to the wish of the people, to re-
spond to the pressure of its own necessities, and so
afterwards mould to a fitting shape its own constitu-
tion. If, in framing a constitution, we attempt to
bind it from expansion—if we attempt to lay re-
strictions upon its development —we shall make, I
fear, a fatal mistake. Now, I will ask whether lam
correct in having gathered from this great and digni-
fied debate the following as the main difficult points
to be solved ? I have not attempted to review the
several speeches, but I have noted the salient argu-
ments, and especially the new' features that have
turned up in the course of each speech, and I gather
that the rigid difficulties consist of the following :
First, security for the smaller colonies. I fully
admit —and even in these resolutions have en-
deavoured to indicate that my wish w'as willing to
resolve itself into action —I am ready to admit, I
say, that the smaller colonies deserve special con-
sideration. First, then, security for the smaller
colonies ; second, the equality of the two houses ;
third, the ministry to represent all the colonies ;
fourth, the ministry to be responsible to both houses.
So far as I can recollect, I think these are the salient
and knotty points which have been evolved in this
discussion —if there be any other, perhaps some
delegate will inform me of it. Now, as I have al-
ready said, consideration cannot be given to the
smaller colonies, I apprehend, without due regard
being paid to the interests of the larger colonies.
If the smaller colonies have their rights, if they
have any special claim to special consideration, at
least the larger colonies have the great right not to
be placed in any position in which a mere cabal
between the weaker colonies might place them in
a minority. That certainly ought not to be per-
mitted, so far as foresight can guard against it.
Now r , with regard to the power of the tw 7 o houses to
treat money bills, or, as I prefer to call them, bills
for imposing taxation and for making special appro-
priations—with regard to the question of both
houses having an equal power to deal with these bills
as they think fit, I cannot disguise from myself the
fact that if that be provided for it will lead to very
great trouble and mischief. I cannot disguise from
myself that it may lead to jars that may burst as-
sunder the federation. I cannot disguise from
myself that it is not in accordance with the chief
principle that has been won for us by ages of
struggle by the best spirits among our ancestors in
the mother country. It is a new-fangled proposition,
entirely un-English, and utterly opposed to the
development of constitutional government. Why,
sir, the whole struggle in England has been
to wrest from irresponsible power the right
to deal with taxation and the revenues of the
country. For the last hundred years, and especi-
ally throughout the benificent reign of the pre-
sent Sovereign, the whole tendency of parliamen-
tary life has been to wuest from those who have no
responsibility, and to lodge with those who have
direct responsibility, these great powers. And it
seems to me like attempting to roll back the sun, and
to shut out the light which the great developments
of the present century have afforded us, to speak of
entrusting to two legislative chambers powers which
it has been found absolutely necessary to confine to
one. Then there is the specious notion that, the
ministry must necessarily represent the different
colonies.
Mr. Ftsii : No point w T as made of it!
Mr. G-illies : Certainly; by several speakers !
Sir Thomas Mcllweaith : Nobody made a point
of it!
Sir HENEY PAEKES: I am willing to defer to
my hon. friend in almost everything; but, perhaps,
he will allow me to judge how far it was made a point,
and how far it was not. The point I meant is the
contention that ministers should be so selected, and,
as I understand it, that provision should be made by
law, that they should be taken from each of the
colonies. That is utterly inconsistent with parlia-
mentary government as we know 7 it. Now 7 , what has
been the course in later times, in the best times of
English history, in the formation of a ministry ? The
Queen, or in a colony, the Queen’s representative,
sends for a person to form a ministry. Whom does
she send for? The Sovereign sends for the person
who, by his standing in political life, by his experi-
ence, by his character, by the degree in which he is
trusted by his political friends, and by his proved
capacity, is most likely to secure a body of capable
men to serve the Crown. He having accepted this
task is absolutely free to make what choice he likes,
and naturally he chooses the men wdiom experience
has taught him are most likely to assist him in a
capable administration of affairs. If he were com-
pelled to take three, four, or five colleagues of whom
he had no knowledge, I can only say that no man of
high spirit and clear discernment of his duties would
accept the office. It would be impossible. How could
the administration of affairs be conducted under our
form of government unless it was conducted by men
w r ho each in the other had the completest confidence?
I am quite sure that no single man amongst the high
minded men who are the leaders of the English
nation would undertake the formation of a ministry
subject to any restriction of that kind imposed by
law, usage, or otherwise. It would be simply
impracticable. Then, as to the government being
responsible to both houses, suppose this state of
things arose : that the senate passed a resolution of
want of confidence, and suppose the house of repre-
sentatives met it by a vote of confidence, how then is
that government to be responsible ? I think that
the more w r e depart from the broad lines of the
English Constitution, developed as it has been during
the reign of the present Sovereign, the more certain
w 7 e are to fall into sloughs of despond—into many
dangers. With regard to the construction of this
senate, it is proposed, even in these resolutions, to
give to the colony of Western Australia, with its
45,000 people, the same representation that is given
to New South Wales with its 1,200,000. Surely that
is a vast concession, and that is given entirely in
order to harmonise those incongruities which are
admitted, which are admitted with sympathy, but
which must exist until the progress of time, and the
progress of the colony, may emancipate that


particular colony from that region of incongruity.
I should not object to meeting the smaller
colonies, especially Western Australia, by giving
her for a time larger representation in the house
of representatives; but that must be limited.
There must be a time when her growth will render
it unnecessary. But prepared as I am, as far as I
can, to make some anomaly in the constitution we
are about to construct, merely to meet the case of
Western Australia—anxious as I am, and anxious as
I believe my colleagues all are, to have the
young colony amongst us —if she cannot see her
way to join us without calling on us to make
sacrifices inconsistent with our clear duty, unhappy
as it may be felt, it would be best for her to wait for
a time to enter the federation. But I trust we shall
not come to that. I trust some concession may be
made quite consistent with our adherence to the prin-
ciples which ought to pervade our work by which she
can join us. lam aware that outside these walls, at
any rate, there is a feeling that we ought to wait;
that the time has not yet come. I can only repeat
what I have said in other places, and what I have
uniformly said, that if we are not ripe for federation
now it is incumbent upon those who tell us so to
name the hour and day when we shall be ripe. If we
miss this particular opportunity, every year that rolls
over us will make the difficulties greater ; if we miss
this opportunity, every experience that is before us
will abundantly prove that we have not risen to a
just sense of the magnitude of our duties. These
difficulties which our separate existence have imposed
will go on increasing. They can only have one crop
of fruit; they can only produce antipathy, disunion,
aggression, reprisal, widespread discontent, and, if
they are suffered to go on, civil war. That is a
prospect which no man of just mind can contemplate
—that these colonies, sprung from the same stock,
possessing the same great inheritance of equal laws
and all the riches of science which have been achieved
and stored up for us in the mother country —that
Ave, side by side, instead of living in brotherhood and
amity, should live in constant irritation and hostility.
Either we must join hands, or Ave must hold out our
hands in defiance of each other. In the very nature
of things, we cannot be diA r ided and be one. In the
very nature of tilings, we cannot submit to causes of
irritation, causes of infliction, causes of dissatisfac-
tion, causes of exasperation, and still live in brother-
hood. It is only by joining hands in good faith as
the people of one kindred ; it is only by giving and
taking, by entertaining compromise as far as com-
promise can be entertained A\ r ithout deadly injury to
principle—it is only by doing that Ave can hope to
found this union. If the gentlemen around me are
actuated by an earnest desire to effect this union it
will be effected. If Ave unfortunately miss this great
occasion and leave the Avork undone, it will be done
in a few years hence, not many years, and it will be
done by younger hands, who will gain the great credit
of having effected this bond of union, Avhich will be
in itself, if rightly effected, of more value than any
other achievement in the history of this continent.
I Avould ask hon. gentlemen when we go into Com-
mittee not to dwell much upon these resolutions.
They are not worth it. They were submitted, as
gentlemen will recollect, in order to raise that most
instructive debate Avhich Ave have listened to. They
have answered their purpose, and that debate, I ven-
ture to predict, will form a notable passage in the
history of Australia; and Avhatever becomes of the
present immediate movement, this debate will have
effect upon the cause of federation until it is con-
summated. But I Avould suggest that the wisest
practical course for us to take Avill be as soon as
possible to agree upon what may be called the vital
provisions of this bill—that is, the provision as to the
construction of the federal parliament, the provision
as to the construction of the federal executive, the
provision as to the representation of the smaller
states, and such other, provisions as involve the rigid
difficulties between the different delegates. If we
can once agree to these provisions it appears to me
that a committee of such men as we have amongst
us could frame a machinery to give harmonious
effect to them in four-and-twenty hours, and our work
would be done. But I would suggest as a practical
aim that we try in open convention to agree upon
those which I will call the vital provisions of this
bill. I have no time —and I do not think it is very
fitting that I should indulge in anything of the sort—
I have no time to talk of this question of republic-
anism which has been so ungraciously launched
amongst us. I want to know where, in all history,
you will find any instance where a people have
revolted and chosen a new form of government when
they w r ere contented with the old form ?
Mr. Mimno ; And had no grievance !
Sir HEN BY PARKES : The very parent of the
erection of new governments is some cause of
grievance, which everybody feels. We feel none so
far as the home Government is concerned. And have
we such encouraging examples in the republican
forms of government in different parts of the world
that we should be seduced from that of our own,
which has stood the shocks of revolution and the
social earthquakes of the last fifty years and never
been shaken ? Why, so beloved is our Sovereign
in that great offshoot of the English nation, the
United States, that I venture to say if Queen Victoria,
by any possibility, could visit the United States, she
would receive a grander and more enthusiastic re-
ception than ever was awarded to man or woman
before. I venture to say that amongst the poten-
tates of the world, including their own President,
there is none more widely respected, more widely
revered by all the best minds of the great American
Commonwealth than the beloved Queen under whom
we live. I go further than that. I contend that the
woman who sits on the English throne, stripped of
all her royal robes and all her royal pendants, is
no common woman in the administration of affairs;
that she has disclosed a genius for government, a
close attention to business, and a keen foresight
which has never been equalled by any monarch
known to history ; and that she has, above all things,
disclosed an amazing insight in her dealings with
every constitutional difficulty that has arisen. Beyond
this, if we even dwell for a moment on the expenses
of monarchy, they are nothing to the waste of wealth
in every presidential election in the United States.
The wealth withdrawn from the ordinary channels
of trade and commerce, and withdrawn from private
fortune in every great contention for the presidential
chair, far exceeds any extravagance that may be
supposed to exist in supporting the monarchy of
England. But I hold this as a principle in human
affairs, that no well-regulated mind, no mind that
rises to the exigencies of any occasion when that
occasion presents itself, will ever anticipate what is
in the far future. If a time should come when it
would be necessary to sever the connection with the
mother country it will come, as it came in America,
in spite of the loyalty, in spite of the good feeling of
the chief men of the time. It will not come to meet
the wild ravings of some person who may call out
“Republicanism,” without the slightest knowledge
of what he is talking about. Sufficient for the day is
the government thereof. We have a government
of which we ought to be proud, and it is neither the
part of loyalty, nor is it yet the part of common-
sense to be anticipating something which may come
in the dim future when all our attention is occupied
—necessarily occupied —with that which we possess,
and that with which we are satisfied. I would ask the
hon. gentlemen, who have, at such great sacrifices,
come here, to endeavour to take the course which shall
be as free as possible from all collateral issues. This


is no time for glowing periods ; it is no time for
rhetorical flights ; but it is a time for hard and
steady Avork in trying to do what Ave are called here
to do, and I would ask hon. members to do their
utmost, by a calm self-suppression, by a close atten-
tion to the object Avhich has brought us here, by
mutual respect, mutual forbearance, and a disposition
to compromise where compromise is possible, to
assist each other in bringing about this great Avork;
and I would say that if we seize the occasion and
succeed in doing the work we shall have, not now so
vividly as hereafter, the blessings of this and suc-
ceeding generations on what Ave have accomplished.
I noAv beg to move:
That the Convention resolve itself into Committee of the
Whole to consider the resolutions in detail.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
la Committee :
Mr. McMILLAN : I think it will meet the general
convenience of hon. members, and it Avill be most in
keeping Avith their anticipation of the course of
business, if Ave simply go into Committee proforma,
and then adjourn until Monday.
Mr. Hires : More Avaste of time!
Mr. HEAKIN : I trust that there will be no such
delay as must occur if the suggestion of the hon,
member, Mr. McMillan, is accepted. To a certain
extent it is worthy of support, that is to say, if it
were proposed that the Convention should rise uoav
until half-past 2, in order that in the meantime we
might have the opportunity of considering and pre-
paring any amendments Avhich it might lie thought
necessary to make on these resolutions. Their dis-
cussion will certainly employ some days. So much
time has been occupied, though Avell occupied,
already, in preliminary discussion that the sooner we
really grasp the difficulties before us the sooner we
shall have some tangible result.
Mr. McMILLAN: My reason for moving the
motion Avas to get the opinion of hon. delegates on
the subject. Some are of opinion that we should
adjourn until Monday ; but if it is the desire of the
majority that we should not do so, I will Avithdraw
the motion.
Mr. GILLIES : FolloAving the advice of my hon.
colleague, Mr. Deakin, I would suggest, sir, that you
should intimate that you Avill leave the chair uoav
until 2 o’clock. We shall then have the opportunity
of a little conversation, and if it should be thought
desirable Avhen we meet again to adopt the motion of
the hon member, Mr. McMillan, we could adopt it.
I think that before any motion of the kind is put
before the Committee, it will be well if we have a
little conversation among ourselves.
Sir JOHN BEAY ; I should like the hon. member,
Sir Henry Parkes —because it seems to me that it
Avould facilitate business—to postpone the consider-
ation of the objects of federation until after we have
considered the framing of a federal constitution. I
understood from his speech that it was our first duty
to consider the framing of a constitution, and as the
objects, of course, are not very fully set out in the
resolutions, it may be desirable to postpone their
consideration. I simply ask the hon. member for
information.
Sir HENET PAEKES : I do not admit that the
objects are set out at all. The Avord “provisions”
in the resolutions ought to bo “ conditions.” I wrote
it “ conditions,” but hoAvit was printed “provisions ”
Ido not exactly know. I only indicate these things
as conditions which must exist—not as the objects of
a federal government, but as the conditions that must
be established as necessary to its existence —a Avide
difference, as the hon. member will see. Then it
must be borne in mind that I do not offer these
resolutions except as indicative of the mind of
the delegates, not as binding on any one. For that
reason, I have in my address just now suggested that
they should be got rid of as soon as possible, so that
we may get into real work ; but I think there is
sufficient in them to indicate whether, for example,
we want a parliament or a congress.
Mr. MACEOSS AN: I think the suggestion thrown
out by the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, might very
well be accepted. There is a good deal to be said on
this resolution before it is put to the Committee, and
I shall be quite prepared to go on and say something
at 2 o’clock if you will accept the suggestion.
Sir Henry Parkes : I am quite prepared to do
so!
Preamble postponed.
(1.) That the powers and privileges and territorial rights of
the several existing colonies shall remain intact, except
in respect to such surrenders as may be agreed upon as
necessary and incidental to the power and authority of
the National Federal Government.
Mr. MACEOSSAN; I think that if we agree to
this resolution without discussion, we shall agree to
far more than we intend to agree to. I presume
that when Ave have discussed these resolutions one
by one, and amended them in \A r hatever form Ave choose,
instructions will be given to a committee to found a
bill which will be our Constitution Act upon the
resolutions as agreed to. Therefore, I think we shall
be acting a little to hastily if we allow a resolution of
this kind to pass without full and fair discussion.
The resolution provides that the powers and privileges
and territorial rights of the several existing colonies
shall remain intact —that is, that the federal constitu-
tion shall guarantee the present powers and privileges
of the legislatures as they exist at present. I do not
quite agree with that. Some of the legislatures have
powers and privileges Avhich will be rather inconsistent
with the working of a federal constitution. Por
instance, take the colony of Queensland, which I am
here to represent. It has a nominee upper house.
One of the privileges of that upper house is that its
constitution cannot be altered unless with the con-
sent of two-thirds of its members, and also two-
thirds of the members of the Assembly, I do not
think we should guarantee that in the Constitution
Act. I believe that one of the first things which the
different legislatures will do after a federal consti-
tution is adopted will be to change their present con-
stitutions, so as to put all their upper houses on a
more liberal basis, and bring them into thorough
accord with the opinions of the people in the same
way as are the senates of the different states of
America. Hon. gentlemen know that the senates of
the different states are elected on a universal sufferage
franchise. The only difference between the elections
of senators and representatives of the different states,
is that the electorate for the senate is upon a broader
basis—that is, it is a larger electorate. Every state
senate is elected by universal sufferage.
Colonel Smith : For one year !
Mr. MACEOSSAN: Ho ; for different periods—-
some for two, three, and four years. There are not
two alike as to the period ; but they are all alike as
to the electoral franchise. I believe, as I said, that
one of the first acts which our different legislatures —•
especially the legislature of Queensland, which has a
nominee house, and probably the legislature of this
colony also —will be, to become more in accord with the
Federal Constitution Act itself. Therefore, if Ave
guarantee this privilege Avhich our nominee house
possesses, Ave shall actually have to break the federal
compact. Before Ave can admit the legislature of
that colony into the federal compact, Ave must amend
it, and I have no doubt that there will be some great
difficulty in the way of amending our Constitution
Act after we have adopted it. I anticipate that
it will not be so easy of amendment as many
hon. members Avould wish it to be. I myself would
not Avish it to be too easy of amendment. I think
that some of our present constitutions are too easily


amended. Then, as to the words “the territorial
rights of the several existing colonies shall remain
intact,” of course that .means that the boundaries, as
they exist at present, are to be guaranteed to the
several colonies without any alteration whatever. I
believed when I saw this that this was put in to allay
a certain suspicion which existed in the minds of the
people of New South Wales, that some of its neigh-
bours had an insidious intention to deprive it of terri-
tory. Ido not think that any such intention has
ever existed, and certainly under a federal constitu-
tion, with free-trade between the different colonies,
there will be no inducement for any colony to desire
any extension of its territory at the expense of its
neighbour. lam quite certain that Queensland
never has had any such intention. But this will pre-
clude the people of an integral portion of the colony,
who think that it is time for it to assume the char-
acter of an independent state, from assuming it with-
out, as I said before, breaking the federal compact.
Instead of guaranteeing the territorial rights as they
exist at present, it would be much better if we adopt
a clause which is in the Federal Constitution of
America, namely, article 4, section 3, which provides:
New states may be admitted by the Congress into this
union; but no new state shall be formed or erected within
the jurisdiction of any other state, nor any state be formed
by the junction of two or more states, or parts of states, with-
out the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned, as
well as of the Congress.
I think that that would be a sufficient guarantee
against any attempt to take away the territory
belonging to any state. When the legislature of the
state is consulted, and gives its consent, I think then
it should be allowed; and if a clause of that descrip-
tion is put into the federal constitution bill, there
will be no necessity afterwards to alter the bill, but
to carefully carry out the provisions of that law. A
similar clause also exists in the Constitution Act of
Canada, what is called the North American Constitu-
tion Act of 1867. Therefore I think that we should
amend this resolution or reject it entirely, with the
understanding that the framers of the constitution
act will bear in mind that clause which I have just
read, and also bear in mind that the present powers
and privileges of the different legislatures should not
be guaranteed to them as they exist at present. Then
we come to the words, “ except in respect to such
surrenders as may be agreed upon.” What surrenders
have we agreed upon ? Have we agreed at present
to make any surrender?
Mr. Deakxx : Hereafter agreed upon!
Mr. MACEOSSAN: Passing this over without
discussing it, hon. members will see at once it is
absurd, for we must first agree as to what surrenders
we are going to make to the federal authority, before
we can make it a working authority. Ido not know
what is the meaning of those words.
Sir Samuel Geipfith; Now agreed upon—agreed
upon in the constitution !
Mr. MACEOSSAN: We have to give instructions
to the framers of the Constitution Act. The framers
of the Constitution Act will not know what to put
into it unless they get instructions from us—unless
they get some idea of what our intentions are.
Therefore, I say we ought to agree first of all on what
we are going to surrender to the federal authority.
When that is done, the rest will be plain sailing so
far as this clause is concerned.
Mr. Gillies: May I be permitted to ask the hon.
member, are we to understand that he desires to say
that the powers of the local legislatures are to be
interfered with by the Federal Constitution Act?
Mr. MACEOSSAN: Ido not say any such thing;
but I say that the powers of the present constitutions,
as they exist, should not be guaranteed in the federal
compact.
Mr. GILLIES: I believe that there is no hon.
member of this Convention who has any idea of inter-
fering in any way with the constitutions of the various
legislatures in the various colonies ; in fact, I always
understood that what this meant was that their
powers were to remain as they are now—powers to
change or to retain their constitutions as they now
are—but that the federal constitution shall contain
no clause whatever that will in the slightest degree
interfere with the rights, powers, and privileges of
the local legislatures, whatever they are.
Sir GEOEGE GEEY: Here stands one hon. mem-
ber who says that he believes that the new federal
constitution ought to interfere with the powers of
the states, and that we ought to frame a truly federal
constitution, suited alike to the states and to the
general government. That is the very essence of
every Constitution Act. If the hon. member will
refer to the various Constitution Acts he will find that
the constitutions of all the states are settled by them,
and the constitution of the general government like-
wise. There is a peculiar necessity for doing that
here. I believe that there is no single state in Aus-
tralasia which has framed its own constitution, or
which has even been fully heard as to the way in
which its constitution was to be formed.
Mr. Platfoed : Yes—South Australia!
Mr. Muneo ; We amended them all!
Mr. Gillies : They drafted them originally !
Sir GEOEGE GEEY : How can there be any fair
amendment in those states in which there are nomi-
nated upper houses—in which any measure originated
in the lower house for that purpose has to obtain the
sanction of the upper house ? Hon. gentlemen will
see that there is no freedom whatever under a con-
stitution of that kind. I believe that the very
essence of a federal constitution should be such as
was given to New Zealand—that is, that we should
recommend that there should be an elected head of
the colony —call him lieutenant-governor, superin-
tendent, or whatever you please —and that there
should be two elective houses—an elected upper
house and an elected lower house—and that we should
say nothing more than that, and let that body meet
and let them frame the constitution for the colony—
that is, in its minor details. In New Zealand some
provinces had responsible governments, others
adopted the plan of the United States ; slight differ-
ences in their government and various forms of gov-
ernment were allowed as the people pleased to choose,
and that produced most perfect satisfaction. Natu-
rally, I feel a desire that the constitution should be
such that New Zealand might come into the federa-
tion, possibly—that a loop-hole should be left —when
the whole question is thoroughly understood; and I
say that New Zealand should, if it did come under
such a constitution, know that it could get rid of its
nominated upper house.
Mr. Platfoed : What has that to do with it ?
Sir GEOEGE GEEY: All I ask is that we should
leave a fair opportunity to the people to choose their
form of government in what is really a form of local
self-government of the highest kind. If they are
allowed to choose their form of government, I main-
tain that they will establish as perfect a form of local
self-government in every instance as could possibly
be obtained, and this clause which enacts that all
these states or provinces are to keep the same form
of government which they have now, is, in the case
of those which are under a nominated upper house,
to decree that they, perhaps, for a century shall go
on without getting rid of that nominee upper house.
You cannot believe that a nominee body is likely to
destroy itself. That would be their only hope of
getting rid of a nominated legislature. If, as the
New Zealand Constitution was formed—if, as the
Canadian Constitution was formed—you began at the
beginning—that is, with states—and gave states a
perfectly free form of government, such as would
instil into the minds of the people right notions
regarding legislation, and leave them to carefully


watch everything done by the persons they themselves
have sent to the legislature, you would educate the
whole class of men in the country, and would attach
them to their government through a sense of self-
interest. They would become fond of the constitu-
tion under which they live ; they would study its
details, and I say you would raise a nation to the
highest possible degree to which men could attain.
That worked well in New Zealand for twenty years,
and I think a fair trial should be given to it here. I
do believe in my heart that if this great assembly
should lend itself to impose for a long period a form
of constitution on the different colonies which they
can have no hope of getting rid of if they dislike it,
they will neglect an opportunity of doing a great
amount of good, they will throw away one of the
greatest chances a young nation has ever had of getting
at once into a position of full freedom, and I. believe
there is not a member of this Convention who will
not live to regret that he did not obtain for his
country the great advantages which it is now in his
power to gain for it.
Mr. PLAYFORD : It appears to me that if we
attempt to make constitutions for all the Australian
colonies we shall be going outside our functions.
I do not understand that we were sent here to draw
constitutions for the various Australian colonies ;
and I can assure the hon. member, Sir George Grey,
that, as far as the Constitution of South Australia is
concerned, we drew it ourselves, and if we are not
perfectly satisfied with it we have the power, under
certain restrictions, to amend it ourselves. We do
not want the assistance of this or any other body
in amending our constitution, and I believe it is the
same with regard to the various other colonies.
With reference to the particular proposition that we
are considering, I look upon it as only declaratory on
our part as to what shall be the principle on which
the drafting of the bill shall proceed. When we
first met in Melbourne two forms of constitution
were promulgated, one based on the Canadian Con-
stitution, and the other not so based. The first idea
was to have a constitution in which the powers of the
local legislatures were strictly defined, and the resi-
duum of power to rest entirely with the federal
government. At that time I objected to that, and
pointed out that we should most strictly define and
limit the powers of the central government, and leave
all other powers not so defined to the local legisla-
tures. This is all that the proposal declares: That
the draftsman shall lay down all such powers as are
necessary for the proper conduct of the federal
government, and not interfere in the slightest degree
with any other powers of the local legislatures. We
do not pretend to guarantee either that the nominee
upper house shall or shall not continue. We guar-
antee nothing. We leave the states with the powers
and privileges to alter their constitutions as they
deem fit. We do not go beyond that. This is
merely a declaratory clause, declaring what our inten-
tion is—that we do not intend to give the residue of
power to the central authority, but to leave that in
the state. That is the position we lay down here.
Originally, it was not intended by Sir Henry Parkes
to put that in the resolutions; but it was thought
better that it should appear in the resolutions to allay
any jealousy on the part of the local authorities, lest
they might think that the federal government was
going to grasp too much power. Under the circum-
stances the clause may well pass.
Sir JOHN DOWNER : What this clause provides
is that the powers and privileges of the parliaments
of the existing colonies shall remain intact. The
powers and privileges of the states, amongst which
is that of changing their constitutions if they please,
are to remain as they are now, except so far as they
are subtracted from by the specific powers given to the
federal parliament. I cannot conceive anything
more clearly expressed, or more completely misunder-
stood by some bon. members. As to the second
part of the hon. member, Mr. Macrossan’s objection
as to territorial rights, I am disposed to agree with
him that the matter might have been better expressed
here. It would have been better if these words
“ territorial rights ” had not been inserted at all, but
that there should have been another subdivision,
providing that the territory of no colony should be
interfered with without the consent of the legislature
of that colony.
Mr. Pla.t:pord : It is understood!
Sir JOHN DOWNER: Of course ; but it would
have been well if it had been provided for more
particularly. Erom statements which have appeared
in the public press it seems to have been thought in
New South Wales that one great object of this
Convention was in some insidious way to give power
to the federal government to interfere with territorial
rights without consulting the particular state. Of
course I believe it will be most expressly provided
for in the bill; and I think that these general words
simply direct attention to the matter to lay the
foundation for a bill which will be based on the
understanding which we all have on the subject, and
which will be fairly carried out by the words as they
are here. Certainly we are not here to make con-
stitutions for the different colonies, but to preserve
the constitutions of all the colonies, except so far as
we think it necessary to take from their powers
those which are to be expressly defined and which
can be most beneficially exercised by the federal
legislature.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: It is unfortunate
that we should have to discuss this resolution in
the absence of Sir Henry Parke s, who I regret is
unable to be here. I understand the resolution as
it is understood by the hon. members, Mr. Playford
and Sir John Downer, and I do not share the appre-
hensions which the hon. member, Mr. Macrossan,
feels as to the words of the resolution. I understand
that what is meant is that the constitutions and
powers of the states are not to be interfered with
except as regards certain powers which cannot be
exercised by a state parliament, and which must be
given to the federal parliament, and that these are
to be defined in the constitution that is to be framed.
I do not see reason for any apprehension as to
interference with the constitution of the states, or
with territorial rights. The hon. member, Mr.
Macrossan, takes a great interest, as I do, in the
question which has been agitated, for the separation
of Queensland, although we do not take the same
view. I apprehend that if the federal parliament is
to exercise the functions which it ought, it will have
to determine whether there shall be separation, and
on what terms the new states shall be admitted to
the federal union. That is one of the necessary
powers of a national federal government. I
interpret the resolution in that sense. I quite agree
that the Parliament of Queensland, or of any other
colony affected, ought also to concur. But I am
quite sure that the hon. member, Sir Henry Parkes,
will be quite willing to agree to any modification of
these words in order to make that more clear. I can
assure my hon. friend, Mr. Macrossan, that I entirely
agree with him in all he said, and holding those
views, I think we are quite safe in accepting the
resolution as it is framed.
Sir PATRICK JENNINGS: I must confess that
I was a little surprised at the observations of my
hon. friend, Mr. Macrossan. I do not think it is our
province here to say that none of the states of Aus-
tralia shall in any way alter their present constitu-
tions. I do not see why, if any particular colony
choose to have a nominated upper house, they should
not be allowed to have it. They may go further and
have only one house as far as we are concerned.
The resolution is only a declaratory introduction to
the subject with which we are to deal. "We wish to


declare that we have no intention and no desire to
interfere with the powers, the privileges, or the
territorial rights of the several colonies; that they
shall remain intact. The colonies framed their con-
stitution acts, they can alter them in the way pro-
vided for therein, and I have no doubt it will be in
the power of the different states to make changes in
their constitutions or to remain as they are just as
they choose. That will not affect the federal power
in any way, and I am glad to find that there is an
express desire on the part of the delegates from the
other colonies to impress on the minds of the people
of this colony that any suspicions of an intention to
interfere with the territorial limits of New South
Wales are repudiated by the whole of those dele-
gates. What powers, what surrenders may be inci-
dental will be, perhaps, a thing difficult to define.
But they must be incidental to the necessary powers
of the federal parliament.
Mr. Kingston ; They must be defined in the long
run!
Sir PATRICK JENNINGS : Perhaps this is an
appropriate time to frame the definitions.
Mr. Kingston : No ; in the constitution bill.
Sir PATRICK JENNINGS: We know that cer-
tain surrenders must be made. We are also told
that the powers and privileges and territorial rights
of the different colonies shall remain intact. There-
fore it will be quite proper for the convention to
clothe the federal parliament with all those powers
and privileges which are absolutely essential to
federal government. The federal power must be
strong, it must be respected, it must have sufficient
life, and must be worthy of the work that we want
to accomplish. lam quite sure that all the powers
that will be needed by the central government will
be freely surrendered, I therefore am inclined to
regard the resolution as an instruction to the framers
of the constitution bill; and I think it should
remain as it is, unless it be desired that some hint
as to the nature of the surrenders should be given.
Sir GEORGE GREY: I should wish to remind
the committee that we are not here to form a federal
parliament, but that we are here to form a federal
constitution. I felt most grateful to the Premier of
South Australia for the assistance which he afforded
me. The hon. member stated, and I saw a look of
satisfaction on his countenance, that South Australia
was allowed to draw its own constitution, and that
it had not a nominated upper house. I envied him,
and I felt that surely he would help other parts of
Australasia to obtain so great a blessing as South
Australia has obtained for herself.
Mr. Platford : I think democracy would get on
just as well with a nominated upper house, and
sometimes better!
Sir GEORGE GREY : The answer to that is,
that I have not proposed to force any kind of council
upon the states; but what I propose is this:
that a state, having obtained the freedom to elect its
legislature, the upper house being elected simply
upon a different franchise from the representative
house, that is, a franchise of the whole state—l
suppose we shall grant that—it shall then be left to
that free legislature to determine what form of
government it will have. There would be nothing to
prevent them, the people of any state, from main-
taining their beloved upper house, if they thought fit.
I would not shut them off from a blessing of that
kind if they desired it; but when we know that this
Convention has the power of giving to all Australia
so great and magnificent a gift as it can bestow upon
it—that is, that each state should choose its own
legislature
Mr. Muneo : We all have that now !
Sir GEORGE GREY: Is it freedom that we should
be at the mercy of a nominated upper house, and
without the consent of that nominated upper house
we cannot change it into an elective one ? Eor how
many years may we have to struggle before we can
get a benefit of that kind ? Eor, remember, every
federal constitution has been drawn with a distinct
declaration as to the powers of the states. That is
the meaning of a federal constitution. I ask you to
put that into your bill, not by a few words saying
that there shall be no interference whatever, and
leading people to believe that perhaps all have an
equal constitution, with equal rights and with equal
privileges, and yet absolutely condemning several of
the states to continue for a series of years to have a
legislature which is not the legislature of freedom.
Eor a nominated upper house is even worse than a
house of peers. It is different in its composition, it
is different in its character, and I say no state can
really be free which is governed by a nominated
upper house, and can make no laws which that
nominated upper house does not agree to. Why
should a few men possess such a power over their
fellow-men as to say, “ However you long for a certain
law, however you wish a change to be made, no such
law shall be made, no such change shall be effected”?
How long are a people free when they cannot make
such laws as they like without the consent of a body
composed of men chosen, not because they possess
any special qualifications, but simply because of
ministerial friendship, or because they have supported
certain views ? In all other cases of framing a federal
constitution the constitutions of the states have been
considered, and I say it is our bounden duty to follow
that example, and to give the greatest amount of
freedom we can to our fellow-men. All we can justly
give, all they merit or deserve, we ought to bestow
upon them. To tell us that we should not come in
and join this great federal body without agreeing to
continue with a nominated upper house is, I think,
imposing upon us a burden which we cannot be
expected to undertake; and I believe it is not just to
the people of any one of the colonies, when we require
to make a federal constitution, not to give them the
freest, the most liberal constitution that we can.
There are no words in the resolution to justify us in
saying that we have only to create a federal parlia-
ment. That is directly contrary to the fact. We are
here to create a federal constitution, and all I ask is
to give to the states the power of framing their own
form of government.
Mr. Kingston : They have it!
Sir GEORGE GREY: How have they it ? Have
they it with a nominated upper house ? Not at all!
Mr. Clark : Swamp them!
Sir GEORGE GREY : We might have to struggle
with them for years; every one knows that that is
the case. It is our duty as statesmen to sketch out
a liberal federal constitution applicable to all the
states. If you intend to preserve a nominee upper
house in some of the colonies, place the provision in
your bill fairly; that is the proper way.
Sir Patrick Jennings: It is proposed to leave
things as they are !
Sir GEORGE GREY: If you want to make a
federal constitution, it should be a constitution
adapted to every state, and the power of alteration
should be given.
Sir Patrick Jennings ; We have the power of
alteration !
Sir GEORGE GREY: Not by the people.
Sir Patrick Jennings : Yes ; in each state !
Sir GEORGE GREY : Yes ; but not by the
people.
Sir Patrick Jennings: If the people desire a
nominee upper house, why should they not have it ?
Sir GEORGE GREY: We must make allowance
for human infirmity. Is it possible that the claims
of friendship can be neglected? Is it possible that
family claims can bo altogether overlooked? Is it
possible that the claims of colleagues who have
helped one for years can be overlooked ? Could not
the government of the day put into a nominated


legislative council an old man like myself, simply to
get rid of him? We know perfectly well that it is
scarcely possible to have a fairly nominated upper
house. Has England ever had a fairly nominated
house of peers P Have not the nominations to that
chamber been made chiefly through friendship and
interest ? In very few cases indeed have peers been
nominated on account of their great qualities.
Mr. Gordon : Mostly on account of money!
Mr. Munro : Nearly all are peers by birth!
Mr, Deakin : Birth and breweries!
Sir GEOEGE GEEY: Money, I admit, has been
a great factor, and so it will be in the case of nomi-
nated upper houses in Australia. All that I say is
that now, when we have this great, this mighty
power of making a really federal constitution, why
should we not go as far as the colony of New Zealand
went, and give to each state the complete power to
choose their own legislature ? If they desire to pass
a law providing for a nominated upper house, give
them the power to do so. I ask you, having it in
your power to give so great a gift, not to close your
hand and keep it. The people of this young country
are about to spring into national life, and now is
the time to give them this power, to encourage them
to do their duty, and to open up all the avenues of
public life upon fair and just principles. We are
required to frame a federal constitution for these
colonies, and if hon. members determine to form
only a federal parliament, let them at least have the
candour to admit that they are not fulfilling their
instructions, although they are doing that which
they think will be for the best.
Mr. MTJNEO : I confess that although I followed
the last speaker as closely as I could, I do not even
now understand what he wants.
Mr. Fysh: We understand what he wants; but
the question is, how we are to give it!
Mr. MTJNEO : As I understand the hon. member,
he desires that this Convention shall give to the local
governments of these colonies the same powers as
were given to them by the British Parliament origi-
nally in their constitutions. If that is what the
hon. gentleman means, I do not think we have the
power to do so. All that we are asked to do is to
draft a constitution for a federal government. lam
afraid the hon. member misunderstands the real
position of the constitution of these colonies. In
the original constitutions of the various colonies, as
far as I know—and I am certain that it was the
case in Victoria—provision was made for an altera-
tion of the constitution by the consent of a certain
majority. And we have, in course of time, altered
our constitution now and again, until we have
the constitution we want. Very well. What
more can be asked when each of the parliaments has
the power within itself to frame a constitution as it
thinks proper ? If Victoria says, “We prefer a con-
stitution with an elective upper chamber,” and if
New South Wales says, “A constitution with a
nominee chamber suits us belter,” it is not for Vic-
toria to say to New South Wales, “ You are wrong,”
or vice versa. Each colony must be allowed indepen-
dent action in that respect. The legislatures of the
different colonies have done that which they thought
best, and surely this body is not now to say to New
South Wales and Victoria, “ You have had power all
along to frame your constitution ; we do not believe
in it, and we want to give you something new.”
Mr. FitzGerald : To force something new upon
us !
Mr. MTJNEO : The legislature in each colony has
power in itself, some by a bare majority, and some by
a two-thirds majority, without reference to the British
Parliament, or any one else, to alter its constitution.
Dr. Cockburn : How can a nominee upper house
alter its constitution ?
Mr. MTJNEO : A nominee upper house can alter
its constitution if there be a majority in favour of it.
Dr. Cockburn : Hear, hear ! If a majority of the
nominees are in favour of it!
Mr. MTJNEO : I venture to say that it would be
much easier to get a majority in a nominee upper
house than in an elective upper house in favour of
the will of the government of the day.
Mr. Barton : Six times as easy !
Sir Patrick Jennings : That is what Sir Graham
Berry thought!
Mr. MTJNEO : He did, certainly, and I did not
agree with him. Suppose the people of New South
Wales are anxious to alter the constitution of the
Upper House, they would have to agitate in the first
instance, and if it were found that a majority were in
favour of it, a nominee majority equally in favour of
it would soon be forthcoming at the will of the
government of the day.
Dr. Cockbttrn : Suppose the number of the
nominee chamber were limited ?
Mr. MTJNEO : I do not know of any case in which
the number of members of the Legislative Council is
limited.
Dr. Cockburn : It is limited in Western Austra-
lia !
Mr. MTJNEO: That is a young colony, and
Western Australia, like the rest of us, will have to
fight for its constitution. When it gets a proper one
it will appreciate it. If in Western Australia the
mistake has been made of limiting the power of the
government under the constitution, the colony will
have to do as we had to do—it will have to fight for
its liberty as it thinks proper.
Dr. Cockburn : Why cannot we help them ?
Mr. MTJNEO: We have no right to do so.
Western Australia has a constitution of its own, for
which the people asked.
Sir James Lee-Steere : No !
Mr, MTJNEO : I myself accompanied the dele-
gates of Western Australia when they went to
London to ask for the constitution.
Sir James Lee-Steere : But they did not ask for
a limited nominee upper house!
Mr. MTJNEO ; I know that; but Western Austra-
lia—or, at all events, its delegates —accepted it. If
Western Australia wants something different from a
nominee upper house, that is a different thing.
Sir James Lee-Steere: We are going to have it
in six years!
Mr. MTJNEO: I have not the least doubt of it.
Sir James Lee-Steere : The constitution says we
shall have it!
Mr; MTJNEO : We are sent here for a totally
different purpose than interference with the consti-
tution of any of the colonies. They have all had the
power within a longer or shorter time to alter their
constitutions as they thought proper. We are now
anxious to frame a constitution for a federal parlia-
ment. If we do that, and lam afraid we shall have
some trouble in doing it, we shall have done all that
we have been asked to do. If we commence our
work by interfering with the constitutions of the
various colonies, we shall find that we have entered
upon a task which is interminable, and, moreover,
we should never succeed. The colonies would listen
to no such thing —they would protest.
Mr. FitzGerald : It is not our mission !
Mr. MTJNEO : I would say, in reply to the hon.
member, Mr. Macrossan, that the people of Queens-
land must have been sleeping upon their rights so
far as the alteration of the constitution of their upper
house is concerned. Our constitution, in the first
instance, was the same as that of Queensland, and
we could not alter it except by a two-thirds majority ;
but one of the first things our new Parliament did
was to alter the law, with the result that the Consti-
tution can now be altered at the will of a majority of
both houses of Parliament.
Dr. COCKBTJEN: I cannot help thinking that
this question may go deeper than at present it


appears to go. It may practically decide the mode
in which the federal senate shall be elected. The
general impression among members, so far, is that
the federal senate is to be elected by the different
legislatures.
Hok. Members : No !
Dr. COCKBURN: If it is to be elected by the
different legislatures this would go to the root of the
matter. I do not think the people would say that
the federal senate, which is to protect the rights of
the states, should in any way be elected by nominated
chambers. It has been said, “ This is a question for
the states themselves. Leave every state to do as it
likes.” I am not altogether sure about that. This
may govern the whole business, for the continuance
of nominated upper houses in all the colonies in
which they now obtain, or in any one of them, will
practically mean that the senate will have to be
elected direct by the electors.
Mr. EitzGeeald : That is not a territorial right!
Hr. COCKBURN: It may be a territorial right;
because the senate is to protect state rights; and I
do not believe that it is wise to leave a matter of this
kind in the hands of the individual colonies to deal
with as they, please. I do not think that those colo-
nies which are accustomed at present to have all
their legislators elected direct, would care to trust
the privileges of the senate to a number of senators
who would not be elected directly or indirectly by
the people. If we do not make some provision to
abolish all nominated upper houses, it will mean that
the senators will be elected by upper houses which
are not chosen by the people of the country. I
would rather have the matter left in that way, so as
to have the senate elected direct by the people.
Mr. BAKER: I think that some hon. members
want to jump the fence before they get to it. I
think the hon. member, Hr. Cockburn, is very much
“too previous” in this matter. We shall not, by
passing this resolution, settle the question in any
way, as to how the senators are to be elected. It
may be that different colonies may elect the senators
in a manner different from that adopted in others.
They may elect senators for different terms. We
shall have to discuss that question later on, and we
should get on much faster if we stuck to the resolu-
tion before the Committee.
Mr. HEAKIN: I trust that the remarks of hon.
members will be accepted by the hon. member, Sir
G-eorge Grey, in the spirit in which they are made.
I am sure no representations from any colony would
receive more consideration than those coming from
Ts ew Zealand, and that no member of the Convention
would be listened to with more attention and with a
greater desire to make concessions, than the hon.
member, Sir George G-rey. The difficulty is that
first of all we have no authority in our commission to
enter upon the question the hon. member desires us
to deal with. If we accept the argument of the hon.
member, Hr. Cockburn, that inasmuch as the repre-
sentation in the senate will possibly depend to some
extent upon the upper houses of the colonies, we
should take into consideration the constitution of
those upper houses, it needs very little reflection to
indicate that we must on the same grounds commence
to consider the whole electoral systems of all the
colonies, and having decided upon the ideally best
system, then propose to alter the laws of the different
colonies accordingly. But we are not sent here for
that purpose. We are sent here, as the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. Playford, truly said, to frame a federal con-
stitution, and we are authorised to undertake no
other task. If the hon. member, Sir Greorge Grrey,
will pardon me, it seems to me that his language was
capable of being misunderstood. He said that it
this Convention were to neglect to take the course
which he advised, we should be imposing on New
Zealand a nominee house, from which it desires to be
freed. Surely that is an over-statement. This Con-
vention imposes nothing upon anybody. It inter-
feres in no sense with the constitution of any colony,
and in no sense lessens any existing power of altering
the constitution of any colony. If we commenced
any such thankless labour we should place ourselves
in this anomalous position: that having been sent
here to frame a federal constitution for the whole of
Australia, we should offer it to the colonies on con-
dition that they alter their existing constitutions.
Surely that is something we are not justified in
attempting. We are not entitled to impose any con-
ditions upon the acceptance of a federal constitution.
This will surely involve sufficient difficulties without
our adding to them. I say this because I cordially
sympathise both with the spirit and object of the
remarks of the hon. member, Sir G-eorge Grrey; and
if I could bring myself to believe that it was within
the scope of our authority to undertake the task
which he proposes, I would cordially join with him.
Sir George Gteey : Leave it to the law officers of
the Crown!
Mr. DEAKIN: We are obliged to leave it to
those who are more interested —the people of the
several colonies under the constitutions which they
now enjoy. I acknowledge the great difficulty to
which the hon. member calls attention ; that nominee
houses require to be asked to abolish themselves.
This is not the only desirable constitutional change.
There are other directions in which reform would be
equally desirable ; but we are not authorised to enter
into those questions. There are some reforms of
burning necessity; but, however necessary they may
be, however great our anxiety may be to accomplish
them, we cannot enter upon them. Our task is
already surrounded by difficulties. We are weighted,
if not overweighted; and we simply dare not add
another to the many difficulties under which we
labour.
Mr. BARTON : I would point out, as has been
suggested by the hon. member, Mr. Playford, that
what we are asked to deal with scarcely comes within
the scope of the Ist resolution: The question
whether we should continue, as in this colony, with
a constitution involving a nominated upper house,
may be the subject of debate hereafter. It cannot,
however, be said to come within the purview of
the powers, privileges, and territorial rights referred
to in the resolution, which are quite distinct from the
matter of constitutional machinery. The constitution
of the upper houses is a question of constitutional
machinery, and it is not a question which the hon.
member, Sir Henry Parkes, apparently endeavoured
to aim at in framing this resolution. He has
endeavoured to settle the question of the powers,
privileges, and territorial rights of the various col-
onies, and the principles which should guide us in
dealing with them, entirely apart from the machinery
by which the federal constitution should be created.
The one state of things he has put into the Ist reso-
lution, and the other state of things into the 2nd
resolution. The mode of appointing the various
legislative councils is not a matter connected with
the powers, privileges, and territorial rights within
the meaning of this resolution at all. That is simply
a matter of constitutional machinery which will
come within the purview of the second set of reso-
lutions. Therefore, I think there is a good deal of
force in what has been suggested by the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. Baker, that we are jumping before we come
to the stile in dealing with the subject of nominated
houses before we come to the second branch of the
subject dealt with in these resolutions. It may be
—especially when we come to consider that there
will be a probability, at any rate, of the members of
the senate who are to represent the various provinces
being elected by the legislatures of those provinces
—a very important matter for us to consider whether
the legislatures of those provinces, as they are bi-
cameral, shall not in both branches depend upon


the popular will. As the hon. member, Mr. Play-
ford, has suggested, even although there ought to be
no desire to limit the debate in any way, it may be
very important for us to consider w’hether even then
the power delegated to us by the resolutions ap-
pointing us entitles us in any way to discuss the
constitutional machinery of our respective provinces.
I am of opinion, with the hon. member, Mr. Play-
ford, that it does not do so. Assuming, at any rate,
that it does not give us the power to pass any reso-
lution upon the subject, there has been a general
consensus of opinion that the debate should not be
limited, and I, for one, shall not be among those who
would raise any objection to that being discussed
when the proper time arrives. But I submit that
the proper time has not arrived yet to discuss the
question of nominee chambers. That rests under the
second batch of the resolutions, and not under the
first. It is a matter of machinery, and not a
matter of the “ powers and privileges, and territorial
rights,” within the meaning assigned to those words
by the first resolution. I wish to call attention to
the use of the word “ surrender ” in these resolu-
tions. Does it mean a surrender of powers and pri-
vileges as well as of territorial rights; or does it
refer merely to such surrender of territory as might
be necessary, for instance, if we submit to our parlia-
ments the propriety of constituting a federal capital ?
I quite share the regret expressed by the hon. mem-
ber, Bir Samuel Griffith, that it is a very great pity
that we have to discuss the meaning of these resolu-
tions, and especially the meaning of the word “ sur-
render,” in the absence of the hon. gentleman, who has
moved them. This is a word which seems to me to
require considerable explanation, and without some
explanation of it from the mover of the resolutions,
it is very difficult for us to say whether or not we
will pass the resolution at all in its present form.
An Hon. Membee : Where is the hon. gentle-
man ?
Mr. BAETOH : I understand that the mover of
the resolutions, being greatly fatigued, has gone
home. If his collaboration with us is to be of the
value we hope it will be, there is no one amongst
us who will begrudge his taking rest at any
period of the proceedings —knowing well the
serious accident under which he has been suffering
for a very long time, and the necessity to our pro-
ceedings of his conserving all his energies, so as to
make him of the best use to us during the proceed-
ings of the Convention ; and I hope no suggestion,
whether it may be called generous or ungenerous,
will be made that Sir Henry Parkes at any time is
not doing well to take such rest as he needs. But I
was going to submit this to the Convention: sup-
posing a decision is come to upon this resolution
this afternoon —whether we might not arrive at
something that will prevent any misconception of it
by adding a separate clause afterwards. There is a
portion of one of the clauses of the American Con-
stitution which seems to embody all that will be
required to define this resolution sufficiently. I will
read the words:
No new state shall be formed or erected within the juris-
diction of any other state,
That is of course subject to any provision which
may be made for the establishment of a federal
capital.
nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states,
or parts of states, without the consent of the legislatures of
the states concerned as well as of the Congress.
Mr. Kingston : Is it worth while to insert that
now ?
Mr. BAETON : There is one reason why I think
it is. Ho doubt a committee will be appointed to
draft a bill, which work will necessarily have to be
conducted privately, because you cannot draft a bill,
at any rate, with the reporters present taking down
every suggestion you mate. Before the Committee
goes to that work it will be necessary that the people
of all the colonies should be aware of what we are
proceeding to do; and there is a feeling in some
quarters of alarm, which I think might be very well
removed by a provision of this sort. I would sug-
gest, therefore, that before we pass the resolution in
its present form we ought to add a second clause,
which I shall be prepared to propose, in some such
words as I have read. In a draft bill, which I find
some gentleman has prepared, it is put perhaps in a
more logical form, and it would read rather in this
way:
No new state shall be formed by the junction of two or
more states, or parts of states, nor any state formed or erected
within the jurisdiction of any other state,,without the consent
of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the
federal parliament.
Sir Samuel Geifeith : That is from the Ameri-
can Constitution!
Mr. BAT?,TON : Yes. It seems to me that it will
give definition to the meaning of the word “ surren-
der,” and prevent its being misinterpreted by people
out of doors in such a way as to cause them to feel
any alarm or distrust at the proceedings of this Con-
vention. If we are to build this structure entirely
upon a foundation of goodwill —as I think we are to
do —we should proceed at each step so as to disarm
suspicion, and let the world, or, at any rate, the
world we are dealing with, know that no rude inter-
ference with the territorial rights, or with the actual
land of any colony, is contemplated, except with the
consent of those who are concerned ; and I trust that
if such an amendment is moved by me, it will receive
the consideration of the Convention, or that some-
thing in a better form will be proposed by some
other hon. member.
Mr. 'WEIXOH : With regard to the point brought
forward by the last speaker, it is undoubtedly worthy
of attention; but I would submit to the hon. gentle-
man that it is somewhat premature to raise the ques-
tion just now. All that the resolution does is to lay
down the general principle that the states shall retain
everything except what it is agreed they shall surren-
der to the central government; and it is impossible to
say what that surrender will include until we have
finished our task —until we have gone through the
whole of our measure, and determined what matters
the states shall retain to themselves, and what
matters shall be conceded to the central government.
Therefore, I submit that it would be premature now
in this introductory statement of a general principle,
to go on specifying either territorial or any other
rights. This is merely a sort of introduction to
what we are afterwards to do, and it says “in respect
of such surrenders as may be agreed upon” —that is,
hereafter, and not while we are now' discussing. As
to the point mentioned by the hon. member about
the rights of territories, I quite agree with him that
it is important that a clause dealing with that ques-
tion should ie inserted in the bill hereafter, and the
words the hon. gentleman suggested from the Ameri-
can Constitution will be well worthy of attention;
but at present the proposal seems to me to be pre-
mature. As to what has been said by the hon. mem-
bers, Sir George Grey and Mr. Macrossan, I hope
they will not understand that w r e at all under-value
the importance of their suggestion. The simple view
which we all take in this Convention is that we have
no commission to deal with it.
Sir SAMUEL GEIEFITH: With reference
to the use of the word “surrender,” I think I can
state the reason that induced Sir Henry Parkes to
use that terra. I believe the constitutions of all the
colonies —certainly those of the older ones do —
contain an express provision that the legislatures of
those colonies shall have power to “make law's for
the peace, order, and good government of the terri-
tory in all cases whatsoever.” That is practically


automony. Consequently, any powers given to the
federal parliament must involve a surrender of some
of those autonomous powers. Therefore, I understood
that Sir Henry Parke’s thought that this was the
aptest word by which to express the relationship of
the states to the federal government—they are sur-
rendering some of their present absolute powers to
the federal parliament. With respect to the sug-
gestion of the hon. member, Mr. Barton, that we
should amend this resolution by inserting further
limitations before we are in a position to frame a
constitution, I would respectfully submit that we are
by no means in a position to begin the draft of a
federal constitution, nor shall we be even when we
have passed these resolutions. There are at least
some scores of subjects which must be defined by
discussion.
Mr. Wbixon : By resolutions!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Yes, by resolutions
as an instruction to the framers of the draft. But
for the purpose of framing those resolutions the
propositions now before us, as I understand, are
intended as guide-posts in the first instance. One
of the first things to be done will be, as was done
in the United States, to classify the powers to be
surrendered to the federal parliament. It is impos-
sible, at this stage of the discussion, to define those
powers; but this resolution indicates the test that is
to be applied as each subject comes up for considera-
tion : “Is it necessary, or is it incidental, to the
power and authority of the federal government?” If
we affirm that principle, we shall easily be able to
apply it, though, as to the mode of application,
opinions may differ, and we shall then be able to
proceed to the next step.
Mr. Mtjneo: Would not the word “or” be better
than the word “and”?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I should say so; but
that may be simply a misprint. On this point I
hope I shall not be considered as doing too much if
I mention that a few months ago it became the duty
of the Government of Queensland, in conse-
quence of the state of things there, to consider,
as a practical matter to be dealt with within our
own boundaries, what were theproper subjects for a
central parliament to deal with as compared with
those that should be left to local parliaments. The
Government were, under the circumstances, obliged
to make out a list—a tolerably complete one, I
believe—of the different subjects for legislation and
for executive government. Although it was not
prepared in view of this Convention, and although it
does not indicate the lines upon which we should
advocate that the functions of a national Australian
government should be defined, I believe it is a
tolerably complete list of the subjects which will
have to be assigned by us to one .authority or the
other, and if any hon. members can find any advan-
tage in perusing it, it is at their disposal. I think
that what we should do, after disposing of these
resolutions, which I would suggest should not be
amplified more than is necessary, is to appoint a
committee, charged with the duty of preparing a
second series of resolutions, founded upon and
springing out of these.
Mr. Playfobd : Draft the bill on these resolutions!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: They are not suffi-
cient to draft a bill upon. Ho committee would
know the opinions of the Convention sufficiently to
be able to draft a bill upon these resolutions.
Sir Patbick Jennings : Why not amplify them !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: They must be am-
plified to a very considerable extent. Suppose a
committee framed a bill upon these resolutions, and
it turned out that half the principles contained in it
did not commend themselves to the Convention, they
would have to do their work over again. I, for one,
do not desire that anything of that sort should
happen, and I think that it is necessary that there
should be an intermediate stage between the adoption
o£ these resolutions and the drafting of a constitution.
I have had some experience of this sort of work, and
I know that unless we are aware beforehand what
are the lines upon which the Convention wishes the
constitution to run, it will be impossible for a com-
mittee to frame one.
Mr. Playfobd : These are the lines !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : These are some of
the lines, the elementary lines ; but there are a great
many other things to be determined. For instance,
what are the subjects which are to be left to the
federal government ? There will have to be an enu-
meration of twenty or thirty subjects.
Mr. Playfobd : Put them into the bill, and if we
do not like them we can strike them out. That will
be a great deal better than having to draft a new
series of resolutions.
Sir'SAMUEL GRIFFITH: For instance, it will
have to be determined how many members shall be
sent to the senate from each state, how they are to
be elected, in what rotation they are to go out, what
the powers of the senate shall be, and many other
matters,
Mr. Playfobd : Put them all in the bill!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : The hon. member, if
he had had any experience, would know that in
drafting a bill it is better to know beforehand what
is the object which its promoters desire to obtain.
Mr. Playfobd : We know the object!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I have mentioned
several matters in connection with the senate upon
which it is impossible for a committee to know the
feeling of the Convention.
Mr. Bakee : There is the power of veto over pro-
vincial acts!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I am, as one coming
from a distant part, anxious to adopt that form of
procedure which will facilitate the business of the
Convention, and I commend this suggestion to hon.
members as the shortest way of getting through our
work.
Mr. THYHHE: Before we can deal with the
resolution practically it will have to be subdivided.
Several subjects are comprised in it, to which
separate and independent consideration will have to
be given. It seems to me that the suggestion which
fell from the hon. member, Sir George Grey, has not
received that amount of attention which it deserves.
When we are considering the preparation of a
federal constitution, one important element in the
consideration is of what items is the federation to bo
composed, and each circumstance affecting the sepa-
rate elements of which the constitution is to be
constructed is of considerable importance. But
there is one matter which I should like to suggest
for the consideration of the hon. member, Sir George
Grey, in connection with his great desire to alter
the constitutions of these colonies where they have
nominee upper houses, and it is this: Ho doubt the
constitution which is framed by this Convention will
have to go to the parliaments of each of the several
colonies, and will have to be indorsed by them before
it can come into operation; but I would point out
to the hon. member that there will be quite as much
difficulty in getting a federal constitution containing
the clauses which he desires to see inserted in it
passed by the colonies containing nominee houses as
there would be in getting similar amendments in
their constitutions agreed to in the separate colonies.
I point this out to the hon. gentleman, and to those
who may think with him, in order that the matter
may receive a little further consideration, and the
direction in which that consideration should go is
this: Will it be necessary that the constitution
which we are about to frame shall be submitted to
each parliament and adopted by it, or will it be suffi-
cient to have it submitted to Conventions in the
separate colonies ?


Dr. : Direct to the people !
Mr. THYNNE: I approve of its being submitted
direct to the people. But if it is submitted to the
parliaments and requires their indorsement, the
difficulty which I point out will be just as great in
getting the constitution adopted as would be the
difficulty of getting amendments made in the
constitutions of the colonies which have nominee
houses.
Sir Samuel Gbiffitii : It could not be submitted
to a convention without the consent of parliament!
Mr. Deakik: Or to the people without the con-
sent of parliament!
Mr. THYNNE; Probably the constitution will
be submitted to the several parliaments, and then
they will make provision by which Conventions shall
be called together in each of their colonies, to give
an affirmative or a negative vote upon the adoption
of the constitution ; but of course before that can be
done the parliaments will have to a certain extent to
give their approval to the federation.
Sir JOHN BIiAY : In reference to the remarks
of the hou. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, if we are
to undertake to go through these resolutions first,
and then have some others submitted to us, we shall
be long indeed before there is any chance of getting
the bill. It seems to me that it will be convenient,
after we have adopted as much of these resolutions
as we can, and have amended them where necessary,
if a committee consisting of one or two representa-
tives from each colony is appointed to instruct a
draftsman to draw up a bill. I think we could get
representatives from the different colonies who
would take the responsibility of having a bill
prepared in such a way as to elicit full discussion,
and* to allow hon. members to give a definite vote
upon the subject before us. But if we are first to
decide on the matters to be put into the bill, and
then to deal with the bill itself, there will bo great
delay.
Sir Samuel Gbiffitii : We both have the same
object in view—speed !
Sir JOHN BEAY: Yes; and I do not suppose
that my hon. friend would hesitate to take the
responsibility now of instructing a draftsman to pre-
pare a bill which would embody in a general way the
views of hon. members. It would, of course, be sub-
ject to amendment. But we shall do no good if we
declare first of all the provisions to be included in
the bill, then have a bill embodying them prepared,
and then consider them as contained in the bill. _ Of
course the matter must be fully discussed ; but it is
our desire to save time as much as possible. With
regard to the remarks made by the hon. member, Sir
George Grey, I agree with those who say that they
are not entirely out of place here, because the pre-
amble to the resolutions is that
in order to establish and secure an enduring foundation for the
structure of a federal government.
Certain propositions should be agreed to. And I
understood the hon. member to say that in order to
secure “ an enduring foundation,” we ought to pro-
vide that all parliaments shall be elected by the
people. That is the groundwork betakes. We could
not attempt to say, of course, what the constitu-
tion of any colony should be ; but I feel quite satisfied
that if the people of New Zealand, through their
House of Eepresentatives, express a strong and
decided desire to do away with their nominated upper
house, and have an elective upper house, the govern-
ments and parliaments of the other colonies will do
all they can to assist them in accomplishing that
object. I feel, as has been said, that we attach too
much importance to the words, “ The powers and
privileges and territorial rights of the several existing
colonies shall remain intact”; because our desire is
not to take any power away they at present have to
alter their constitutions. I would ask the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. Barton, not to lay too much stress upon the
word “ surrenders.” It seems to me that if we want
to get on with business the sooner we pass the
resolutions in some satisfactory state, which will com-
mend itself to the view of hon. members generally,
and the sooner we get a draft bill submitted to us,
the better we shall expedite our business.
Mr. DIBBS : When I had the honor of addressing
the Convention the other day, I took the liberty of
saying that the resolutions had been presented wrong
side up. lam of that opinion still.' lam also of
opinion, after having listened to the many speeches
in Committee, that there is great force in the remarks
of the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, supported
by the hon. member. Sir George Grey. These
resolutions are as bald as a billiard ball, and there
are no members of the Convention, excepting,
perhaps, those who have come with constitutions
ready cut and dried in their pockets, who can be pre-
pared to arrive at any conclusion as to what form of
constitution should be submitted. The resolutions
in their present shape are as unsatisfactory as they can
be, and it is because of their unsatisfactory character
that all this debate has taken place. Supposing it
were possible that we could arrive at some amended
form of resolution, such as was-suggested by the hon.
member, Mr. Barton, and supported by the hon. mem-
ber, Sir John Downer —a resolution declaring that
territorial rights shall not be disturbed in any way,
and then that the Convention went on to say that the
federal government should have certain powers to bo
named, the matter would at once be brought into a
form upon which a bill could be constructed. Some
time ago I prepared, with the intention of submitting
it in Committee for the purpose of tacking it on to
the resolution we are considering, the following
clause: —
The federal parliament shall have control of the military
and naval defences (the governor-general being com-
mander-in-chief), mint and coining and currency, extra-
dition, marriage and divorce, aliens and naturalisation,
tariff, foreign relations, post and telegraph, weights and
measures, patents and copyrights, quarantine, census
and statistics, banks, legal tender, commerce, shipping,
navigation, and light-houses.
I have also prepared another clause, setting forth
what the state rights should be —a general saving
clause, giving the state parliaments power to deal
with all other matters which are not actually handed
over to the federal government. If a committee
were appointed after some agreement had been come
to as to the powers upon which a bill should be
drawn up, they would have something to work upon ;
but they wouli have nothing to work upon in these
wretchedly bald resolutions —resolutions which, the
mover told us, were only thrown down —like a bone
thrown to a lot of dogs to worry over —for the pur-
pose of discussion. We have worried over them,
and there is no material in them upon which any-
thing like a constitution can be built. If some
person were to frame a constitution upon these four
bald resolutions, or if a committee of the Convention
were to frame a constitution, we should be where we
are now, determining the powers which the federal
government should possess. We have fired off all
the powder, and now we have come to solid hard
work.
Mr. Kingston ; To the bomb-shell!
Mr. DIBBS : The hon. gentleman will hear about
that by-and-by. The bomb-shell question has been
terribly misunderstood, especially by my powderless
friend, the Chairman of Committees. It has been
misunderstood by him, because, unfortunately, he
finds that his powder, when he wants it to go off, is
sometimes damp. We require a sub-committee to
act in connection with the Parliamentary Draftsman.
The Parliamentary Draftsman should possess an
expression of the views of the Convention as to the
powers which a federal government should possess,


and the sooner we get to that stage the better. I
shall be prepared, as soon as the hon. member, Mr.
Barton, deals with the resolution declaring the re-
tention of provincial ‘or state rights, to move
that a bill be drawn up embodying certain powers,
the states to deal with the remaining powers after-
wards. With material of that kind, I think the
hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, will be disposed to
admit that those who proceed in the manufacture
of a constitution will have fair and good ground to
work upon. Otherwise we shall merely play upon
the surface of a very hard piece of ground. We are
wasting a deal of time, profitably, I hope, to the
members of the Convention from other colonies.
Even those who reside in Sydney, however, feel it
somewhat tedious to be compelled to attend here
day after day to the neglect of their private
business. What must it be, then, for our friends
from abroad ?
Mr. KINGSTON: I cannot appreciate the stric-
tures which the hon. gentleman who has just sat
down has launched at the resolutions. The resolutions
were introduced for a certain specific object, that of
raising discussion, and they have certainly accom-
plished it, and, as was intended when they were first
tabled, we are now in Committee for the purpose
of putting them in to such a shape as will enable a
bill to be drafted. I think we ought to recognise
this : that whilst they are sufficient for the purpose
of raising discussion, they are not sufficient in their
present form to enable a draftsman to draft a bill
which is likely to give satisfaction to the Convention
generally, . At the same time, we need not provide
in this discussion with great particularity for all
possible details, because if we do that it will
simply amount to an attempt on the part of
the Convention itself to draft a bill. Something
must be left to the consideration of those who
will be intrusted with the preparation of the
measure, and who will have to put certain
minor matters into such a form as they may consider
best likely to meet the wishes of the Convention. I
do not think the resolutions, as they stand at present,
are sufficient to enable a bill to be satisfactorily
drafted. Nor do I see the necessity for the sugges-
tion which has been thrown out, to the effect that a
sub-committee should be appointed to draft further
resolutions to be submitted to the Convention.
There are several most important principles embodied
in the resolutions, and I think, if we take them as a
frame-work upon which to engraft such other resolu-
tions as we consider essential on matters of import-
ance, we shall do better than if we attempt to
set out everything in detail. In connection with
this matter, I should like to say that I sympathise
with the suggestion which has been made by the hon,
member, Mr. Barton, as to the propriety of laying
down in these resolutions, for the guidance of the
draftsman, the principles upon which fresh states
may be carved out of the different provinces. It has
been well said by various hon. members that a pro-
vision of this sort would be likely to be inserted by
the draftsman without any special instructions. Such
a provision was originally contained in the United
States Constitution. It is also contained in the
South African Act. We must remember, however,
that it was not originally contained in the Canadian
States Constitution, in the British North American
Act of 1867, and that legislation had to be introduced
for the purpose of meeting it in 1871. Under these
circumstances, particularly in view of the doubts
which have been expressed in various quarters as to
the intention of the Convention with reference to
the appropriation of territory which belongs to the
several colonies, it would be just as well to make the
matter perfectly plain. There would be no difficulty
whatever in adopting the provision which has been
suggested by the hon. member, Mr. Barton, and if
the hon. member will move the resolution in question
as an amendment to that which we have before us, I
shall be most happy to support it. At the same time
I think it would be well not only to provide for the
consent of the local legislature, and of the federal
parliament, to the carving of new provinces out of
existing colonies, but that a provision should be
inserted, possibly in the shape of a referendum, for
ascertaining what are actually the wishes of the
people themselves on the particular point. If
we discuss this subject at this stage in connec-
tion with the resolutions—it is a matter of im-
portance and of principle—we shall shorten the
way towards getting it absolutely settled, and will
certainly also lighten the task which will be im-
posed on those whose duty it will be to draft
the bill. I think that if we deal with each ques-
tion as it arises; if we refuse to attempt to put
olf the day when it will be necessary for us to
face and discuss and settle these difficulties ; if we
meet this point which has been raised, and dispose of
it, and deal similarly with all other matters of prin-
ciple, whilst relegating questions of detail to the
consideration of the draftsman intrusted with the
preparation of the bill, we shall do well; and I shall
be happy to join in doing whatever is necessary to
dispose of the matter now raised, which may fairly
be considered a matter of principle.
Mr. WEIXON: A new matter, one of procedure,
has been raised, which it is very important to decide,
and I wish to say a word about it. It will, I imagine,
be utterly impossible to draft a bill unless you draw
up full instructions for it. No one can say that if we
pass all these resolutions they will be instructions.
No draftsman could know what our ideas upon the
vast number of matters that must yet be provided
for. All a draftsman could be expected to do would
be to put into technical and legal language what we
determine, and there are not only one or two, but
fifty or sixty matters of detail, all of which we
must vote upon before we can employ a draftsman ;
therefore I thoroughly agree with the proposition
made by the hon. and learned member, the Premier
of Queensland, which I do not think is open to dis-
pute, namely, that after we pass this resolution we
must pass a number of other resolutions embodying
the details of the bill; but, nevertheless, I would
advise the Convention to go on as fast as we can in
dealing with what is before us, for this reason: if
we take what is before us, and determine all the
questions that are raised by these resolutions, though
that will by no means afford materials for a bill, it
will determine one or two points which it is essential
we should have determined before we talk of any
bill at all. We shall determine the question of
state rights, as against dominion rights, and, of
course, any arrangement for customs revenue. All
that is provided for; and I suggest that we go on
as fast as we can with what is before us, all the
while understanding that it is imperfect, but yet
that it embodies vital questions ; and when we have
determined these I do not think that we shall have
much difficulty in passing thirty or forty other
resolutions dealing with matters all essential to a bill
being drawn.
Sir JA MES LEE-BTEEEE: I rise to support the
proposition of the hon, and learned member Sir
Samuel Griffith, that before a bill be drafted we pass
some other resolutions saying wffiat provisions the
bill shall contain, more especially in regard to the
powers to be conferred on the federal government.
I cannot see how we can come to a determination as
to the powers that we propose to confer on the senate
until we know what powers we are going to give to
the federal parliament. I think it will expedite
matters very much if further resolutions be prepared
by the Committee, and it certainly will not cause
any further long discussion on the bill.
Eesolution agreed to.


Mr. BARTON: I think we may as well take into
consideration at once the propriety of amplifying
these resolutions, so that they may be a sufficient
instruction to any drafting committee or draftsman
—I myself am in favour of a drafting committee
being elected—without going through the inter-
mediate stage suggested by the hon. and learned
member, Sir Samuel Griffith. We have all one
thing in common, that is, the saving of time. Now
that we have taken these resolutions in hand, the
subjects of absolute principle are not so very
numerous. Most of the provisions of the bill, or a
large number of them, at any rate, would be provi-
sions in regard to matters of detail, and they would
all be subject to amendment. The drafting com-
mittee that we shall elect will have such a know-
ledge of the feeling and opinion of hon. members,
as can be derived from a study of the debates,
that they will be able, as regards most ordinary
matters of detail, at any rate, to frame provisions
which will probably be within the drift of the dis-
cussion, or, at any rate, there will be a fair basis
for proceeding in Committee upon the bill. Why,
then, without this intermediate stage, should we not
lay down matters of principle, so long as they are
matters of the inherent principle ? It seems to me
that it will be easier and shorter to do that, and it
would not be necessary to add to the resolutions
more perhaps than half a dozen provisions to enable
the drafting committee to have a sufficient set of
instructions to prepare a bill that we can go on with.
Therefore I move :
That the following stand as clause 2 ; —“ That no new state
shall he formed by separation from another state, nor
shall any state be formed by the junction of two or
more states, or parts of states, without the consent of
the legislatures of the states concerned, as well as of
the federal parliament.”
Sir SAMUEL GEIFEITH: Before that resolu-
tion is formally put, I would suggest to the hon.
and learned member, Mr. Barton, whether he thinks
it desirable to propose that resolution formally from
the chair in the absence of the hon. member, Sir
Henry Parkes ? I do not profess to be in that hon.
gentleman’s confidence with respect to the resolu-
tions any more than is any other member of the Con-
vention ; but he is specially in charge of these reso-
lutions —they are of his own drafting entirely, and I
am under the impression that he does not desire,
from his point of view, that they shall be amplified
to any great extent, at any rate. They are now, of
course, in the hands of the Committee ; but it would
not be courteous, nor in accordance with par-
liamentary practice, to insist on any important
amendment in the hon. gentleman’s absence.
Mr. G-ordon : Are we only to agree and not
dissent!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I merely call atten-
tion to the hon. member, Sir Henry Parkes’ unfor-
tunate absence.
Mr. Gordon : Then we should not sit!
Mr. Barton : I think that we might go on with the
discussion, but not take a division until the next
sitting day.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I may take this op-
portunity of adding to what I said just now, that one
of the matters upon which the draftsman will have
to be instructed is, how the governors of the colonies
are to be appointed. Is there a single member of the
Convention who has the slightest idea what is the
opinion of the Convention on that point P
Mr. Platford : They can put something in the
bill, and we can agree to or dissent from it!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: The hon. member
must have a very small knowledge of the drafting
of bills if he says that. Another question which has
to be considered very fully is, what provision is going
to be made in reference to the enormous surplus
revenue which the central government will have ?
That is one of the most important matters that we
shall have to deal with, and it must be discussed
very fully.
Mr. Munro : What is the good of raising new
questions now ?
Sir SAMUEL G-RIFFITH: lam merely pointing
out that these are things which must be settled in a
preliminary manner before anything can be put into
a concrete form.
Mr. Munro : If we are going to discuss the whole
subject on every motion we shall never get through
the business!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : lam not proposing
to discuss them, but am merely pointing out that
there are a number of subjects besides those men-
tioned in the resolutions which must be discussed
before they can be put into a concrete form. I am
disposed to think that the shortest way would be the
appointment of a committee straight off.
Colonel Smith : Why not do it ?
Sir SAMUEL G-RIFFITH: I have pointed out
the objections to it. lam most anxious that we
should get the business done as soon as possible.
Mr. MUNRO : I want to call attention to what
appears to me a slight irregularity. I understood
that we were to be governed by the standing orders
of the House of Commons, which are practically the
standing orders of our legislatures. We have passed
one resolution, and there are others to follow ; but
now it is proposed to bring a new resolution in be-
tween the Ist and the 2nd. That is not in accord-
ance with our practice. My object in speaking is
to try to get back to a business-like way of going on.
According to our practice we must either add Mr.
Barton’s resolution by way of amendment to the one
before the Chair, or allow it to remain until all the
resolutions are dealt with.
The Chairman : I am bound to say that, in my
opinion, the hon. member is out of order in propos-
ing his resolution at this stage. He should either
have proposed it as an amendment, or have waited
until the whole of the resolutions had been disposed
of, and then have proposed it as a new resolution.
An hon. member having raised an objection to the
resolution, I must rule it out of order.
Mr. BARTON: I did propose at first to submit
the proposal in the form of an amendment, but I
thought the better course was to submit it as a new
resolution. I know that that is not strictly according
to parliamentary rule, but I thought that a greater
degree of latitude would be allowed than is ordi-
narily permitted in parliament.
Mr. DEAKIN : 1 wish to propose that the 2nd
resolution be postponed until after the_ 3rd reso-
lution, with the view of giving No. 3 priority over
it. This, it appears to me, would be the logical
order of dealing with the resolutions.
The Chairman : According to parliamentary prac-
tice, if the 2nd resolution is postponed, it must be
until after the discussion on all the other resolutions.
Mr. DEAKIN: There may possibly be no ob-
jection to the course I suggest. I move, with con-
currence :
That resolution No. 2 be postponed and stand after resolution
No. 3.
Mr. FYSH: I must ask the ruling of the Chair
on the subject. As the hon. member, Mr. Munro,
pointed out, we must carry out our parliamentary
practice in its entirety. The proper course, under
the circumstances, will be to treat the resolutions
as a bill. If one is reserved it must be dealt with
after the whole of the other resolutions have been
disposed of.
The Chairman : The hon. member, Mr. Heakin,
has asked to be allowed to take another course, with
concurrence. Does the hon. member object ?
Mr. Fysh : No, I shall not raise any objection.
Motion agreed to.


Resolution No. 3 proposed:
That the power and authority to impose customs duties shall
be exclusively lodged in the federal government and par-
liament, subject to such disposal of the revenues thence
derived as shall be agreed upon.
Mr. DEAKIN : The first question that arises in
connection with this resolution is whether the word
“excise” will not require to be inserted. I move :
That after the word “ customs,” the words “ and excise” be
inserted.
Mr. AD YE DOUGLAS; Before that alteration
is made we ought to have some explanation as to
what the hon. member would include under the term
excise. In different colonies the word is inter-
preted in different ways. In Victoria the excise
duties are of the same character as those levied in
England; but in Tasmania we have a stamp duty
which is virtually an excise duty. Every barrel of
beer has to be stamped, and all breweries"are subject
to Government supervision. Would such a duty
come within the meaning of “excise”? Before the
word is inserted we should know to what it is in-
tended to apply.
Mr. McMILLAN : I presume that when we come
to deal with the matter in the federal parliament
there will be a uniform excise, and whatever prin-
ciple is agreed to generally will be extended to all the
colonies, consequently no difficulty can really arise.
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS ; A difficulty will arise at
once if it is made payable into the general revenue.
I imagine so, at least, because we in Tasmania should
at once do away with the duty,
Mr. McMILLAN: The fact of what the hon.
member’s colony will do beforehand will not affect
what the federal government will do afterwards,
even if they had no excise whatever. The hon.
member referred to a system of affixing stamps to
beer barrels. It is simply a modus operandi for
collecting the excise duty; it can scarcely be called a
stamp duty in the strict sense of the term.
Mr. Adye Douglas: It is strictly excise!
Mr. PLAYFORD: There will be no more diffi-
culty, I imagine, in connection with excise duties
than in connection with customs duties. I suppose
it is understood by all of us that the customs duties
or excise duties shall be of a uniform character; that
one law shall not be made to suit Victoria, another
law to suit South Australia, and another law to suit
MV estern Australia j but that whatever customs laws
are passed shall be absolutely the same as regards all
the colonies. I do not suppose it is necessary to
insert every little thing in the resolutions for the
information of the celebrated draftsman of this bill.
Mr. THYNNE: There is something more in the
insertion of the word “excise” than appears at the
first blush. Perhaps the question of state rights may
come in in a way which we do not anticipate. In
Tasmania a great many articles are liable to excise
duty which are not liable in the other colonies.
Mr. Burgess: Only one —beer!
Mr. THYNNE: There is nothing to prevent a
duty on the production of tobacco being classed as an
excise duty. In fact, many other products might be
made liable to excise duty in just the same way. Is
the federal government to have the same power of
imposing taxation on local productions as the state
governments have? The subject wants a little more
consideration, I think, I can foresee possibilities
under which rival claims may be made by the separate
colonies, and by the federal government to impose
taxation on the same objects. We must bear in
mmd that wo are producing in these colonies almost
everything that we require. Some colonies pro-
duce what others cannot produce. A tax on the
productions one colony would be a very unfair
tax, and it might also have the effect of depriving
each separate state of its own legitimate source of
revenue.
Mr. MUNRO : The difficulty which has arisen
must he coped with. It will be absolutely impossible
to give the import duties to the federal government
without the excise duties, unless we are to allow some
colonies to take advantage of others. Take, for
instance, the case of an article which I do not use.
If the federal parliament is allowed to put an import
duty on whiskey for the whole of the colonies, and
one colony puts an excise duty on the local manufac-
ture, and another colony does not do so, the result
will be that the colony which does not tax the local
whiskey will get the local article produced to the
largest extent, and it will be passed on to other
places, because being a local manufacture it will not
be liable to any duty. I understand, whatever we
may do, we intend to apply the same law to every
colony, consequently we cannot allow the excise
duties to go without the customs duties, for otherwise
the whole thing will be bound to go wrong. At the
present time Tasmania has an excise duty on beer,
Victoria has no such duty ; but there is not the least
doubt that if the revenue of Victoria were to become
short, we should fall back on that article as a means
of raising revenue. If we are to give the excise and
customs duties to the federal parliament, we shall
expect that body to take a large amount of local
expenditure off our shoulders. In this way one will
balance the other. We spend, for instance, large
sums on defence works. We expect the federal
parliament to take over the whole of the defences,
and in that way one will balance the other, I am
quite clear, however, that if the excise duties are not
to go with the customs duties the whole thing will
break down.
Mr. BAKER: I do not think the hon. member,
Mr. Munro quite understood the argument of my
hon. friend, Mr. Thynne. My hon. friend, as I
understood him, admits that excise duties must be
uniform throughout the colonies; he also admits
that the federal legislature must have the power to
impose excise duties ; but he points out that, although
the duties may be uniform in all the colonies, still
they may be imposed on some article which is raised
exclusively in one colony, as, for instance, sugar in
Queensland. Therefore the question of state inter-
ests comes in, although indirectly, in considering the
matter of regulating excise duties. My hon. friend’s
argument is worthy of our consideration, because
taxation might be imposed in such a manner that
one particular state would be prejudicially affected,
and the rest of the states would obtain an unfair
advantage.
Mr. CLARK : The case just mentioned is exactly
parallel with the tobacco cases in America, to which
I referred in my speech on the resolutions the other
day. Having had these cases brought under my
notice, I thought a great deal about the subject, and
I think the only way in which we can avoid that
state of things arising under our constitution is by
providing that there shall be no export duties, and
that there shall be no excise duty imposed upon any
article which is not also subject to customs duties. I
think it will cover the whole ground if we have no
export duties whatever, and no excise duties except
on articles which are subject to import duties.
Mr. BURGESS : There can be no doubt that the
suggestion of my hon. friend, Mr. Clark, if given
effect to, will cover most of the ground. If the hon.
member, Mr. Baker, will look at the wording of the
resolution, I think he will see very clearly that the
power of levying an excise duty will be lodged ex-
clusively in the hands of the federal government,
and that the local legislatures will have no power
whatever to impose an excise duty upon any article.
It is very necessary indeed that tins power should be
possessed by the federal government, particularly in
view of the way in which the customs duties as a
whole w r ould be affected if proper care -were not
taken to provide for this at the outset. The hon.


member, Mr. McMillan, in his address to the Con-
vention yesterday, referred to the amount of duty
that would be lost in connection with intercolonial
free-trade. I think he stated that the total customs
revenue of the colonies at the present time was
something like £8,603,000; but, that if we had in-
tercolonial free-trade, that amount would be reduced
by some £225,000. lam quite sure, however, that
if the matter be carefully looked into, instead of the
amount being reduced by some £225,000, it will be
found that the reduction would amount to between
£600,000 and £700,000. Take one item alone. On
referring to the statistics of Queensland, I notice
that the average export of sugar from that colony is
40,000 tons per annum. Taking the average duty
levied to bo £5 per ton, that would represent
£200,000. In addition to that you would lose a
large amount collected upon rum manufactured in
Queensland, and upon the spirits and tobacco manu-
factured in both New South Wales and Victoria,
also upon the wine in South Australia, to say nothing
of cereals. It will be found that the amount given
by the hon. member would be largely increased. It
is a matter of the greatest moment that we should
see that the power of levying excise duties is placed
in the hands of the federal parliament.
Mr. MAEMION : I can see that the giving to the
federal parliament of the right to interfere with the
separate states, so far as the levying of excise duties
is concerned, may have rather an extraordinary
effect, unless something is done in the direction
of the suggestion made by the hon. member, Mr.
Clark ; that is, providing for an import duty upon
every article upon which excise is levied. I will give
my reasons for thinking so, and I do not think they
have been touched upon by any one who has yet
spoken. Take, for instance, the colony I represent —
Western Australia. We are large producers of
colonial wine, and we hope to be large producers of
tobacco. We have also a large number of breweries.
Take one of these items. It is proposed by these
resolutions that trade and intercourse between all
the Australian colonies shall be absolutely free. Let
us suppose that the federal parliament levied an
excise duty on colonial wine of a few shillings per
gallon for purposes of revenue. There would be no
objection to that; but what would be the result if
we had absolute free-trade between the colonies?
Colonial wine would be imported into Western Aus-
tralia from the other colonies, and would undersell
the locally-produced wine ; and the same thing would
hold good with regard to tobacco, and the other
items to which I have referred. I believe I am
correct in that view. I believe it is absolutely neces-
sary that we should carry out either the suggestion
of the hon. member, Mr. Clark, or one similar to it.
Mr. Fitzgerald : The duty would be uniform in
all the colonies!
Mr, MAEMION: I am afraid I have scarcely
made myself understood.' I have not said anything
as to the uniformity of the duty. I do not know
whether the customs duties, excise or import, would
be uniform ; but the case I put is this : Supposing
an excise duty were levied on tobacco in AVestern
Australia of Is. per lb. The manufacturer would
have to pay the duty in the first instance, and later
on the consumer would have to pay it. At the same
time, the tobacco grown in South Australia, Victoria,
and New South AVales would enter the colony duty
free.
Mr. Playford : But there would be an excise
duty all over the colonies !
Mr. MAEMION: Then, I fear I have misunder-
stood the question; but I thought an excise was a
duty imposed upon internal, and not upon external,
productions. I have never read of an excise duty
referring to productions outside of the country in
which the duty was levied.
Mr. J. Forrest: It is generally understood to be
a duty levied upon home productions !
Mr. MAEMION : Then my argument, I take it,
is applicable!
Mr. DONALDSON : I think we ought to make
haste slowly in this matter. It would be only right
that the federal parliament should have the right to
levy an excise duty upon spirits, tobacco, and beer.
These are three items subject to excise at the present
time. But suppose the parliament were to go a
little further, it might possibly put an excise duty
upon sugar, and, as far as I know, there is only one
colony in this group at the present time which grows
sugar.
Mr. Gordon : Excise would include licenses !
Mr. Fitzgerald : The states representative would
see to those matters!
Mr. DONALDSON: I believe an excise would
also include a stamp duty. I should like to have
this matter fully considered. It is getting late, and
in the absence of the mover of the resolutions I think
they might now bo postponed until our next sitting.
I therefore move :
That the Chairman do now leave the Chair, report progress,
and ask leave to sit again.
Colonel SMITH : I should like, before that ques-
tion is put, to ask members of the Convention to
consider the question as to how much of the customs
revenue of the colonies is to be given up to the
federal body until the general tariff is established. I
quite understand the objections of AVestern Aus-
tralia, and I think all the colonies would object to
give up the whole of their customs revenue before
the general tariff is framed. I think that some limit
should be fixed, say about one-fifth of the total. A
general tariff should be established before the colo-
nies abandon the whole of their customs revenue.
Progress reported.

The following address was read by the secretary; —
57, Queen-street, Melbourne,
13 March, 1891.
Sir s _We have the honor, on behalf and at the request of
the members of council of the Melbourne Chamber of
Commerce, to tender to the members of the Convention the
assurance of the profound sense entertained by the mercantile
community of Melbourne of the importance attaching to the
deliberations of the Convention and of their far-reaching
consequences.
The members of the chamber trust that the Convention will
be influenced and guided by wise and patriotic counsels, and
that on all the great issues which will come under their con-
sideration the conclusions arrived at may tend to the consoli-
dation of Australian interests, the fuller development of our
varied resources, and the firmer foundation of all the institu-
tions of our civilisation on a national basis in harmony
amongst ourselves as colonies, and always in truest touch
with the heart of the great British empire.
We are, &c.,
Henry G. Turner, President.
C. Hallett, Secretary.
EE POETS ON COLONIAL DEFENCE.
Mr. DIBBS : Before tbe orders of the day are
called on, I would like to ask, by way of suggestion,
whether it -would not be desirable that the reports
with regard to oar military defences, which have been
received by the various governments from Major-
General Edwards and others, should not be printed
and circulated in this room, for the purpose of
enabling ns to thoroughly understand the position of


ur military defences when we come to consider the
th resolution ? I make that suggestion because, on
making inquiries among hon. members from the other
colonies, I have been told that certain information
has been in their possession as members of Parliament
which has not been placed in the hands of members
of Parliament in this colony. In dealing with a
large question such as military defence is likely to be,
it would be a great assistance if hon. members had
the advantage of having before them all the reports
which have been made to the various governments.
The President : There can be no objection to
affording the fullest information to members of this
Convention which the Government may have in its
possession. But I would invite attention to the fact
that the Convention is not called upon to consider
the state of the military forces in this country, but
to decide the question whether these forces should or
should not be placed under a federal parliament; and
the light which may be thrown on the state of the
forces in any colony by any reports will not in any
way assist us in deciding upon the policy whether or
not the forces of the country are to be placed under
a federal government.
FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.
In Committee (consideration resumed from 13th
March) on motion by Sir Henry Parkes:
The Chairman : The original question was that
the following resolution be agreed to :
(3.) That the power and authority to impose customs duties
shall be exclusively lodged in the federal government
and parliament, subject to such disposal of the revenues
thence derived as shall be agreed upon.
It has since been moved by the hon. member, Mr.
Deakin, by way of amendment, that after the word
“ customs,” in the second line, the following words be
inserted, “ and excise.”
Mr. GORDON: I think the Convention did
wisely at its last sitting in postponing further con-
sideration of these resolutions until the members
should have had time to give them fuller considera-
tion, because, after all, it appears to me that the
question involved in the resolution now before us
touches a very vital point in the discussion. It
touches the money bills, and, as was said by the hon.
member, Mr. Wrixon, the power of government
really lies in the power of the purse. I support the
suggestion made by several hon. members, that as
much as possible we should clear the ground of this
discussion as we proceed. The hon. member, Sir
Samuel Griffith, suggested that we should give the
draftsman of the proposed bill merely a sketch of
instructions, and leave a great deal to be filled up by
those whose duty it will be to prepare the bill.
Sir Samuel Griffith : No. My suggestion was
the opposite !
Mr. GORDON : Then I must place myself in the
ranks of those hon. members who have been so un-
fortunate as to more than once misunderstand the
hon. member.
Sir Samuel Griffith : The hon. member mistook
the suggestion !
Mr. GORDON : I understood that two sugges-
tions were before the Convention at its last meeting.
The first was that our instructions to the draftsman
should be somewhat sketchy, and that we should re-
consider the bill when it was brought before us.
The other suggestion was that we should as much as
possible clear the ground of the discussion as we
went along. I think our duty is to save time as much
as possible, as was suggested by the hon. member, Mr.
Piayford, by settling every item and condition of the
contract we are about to make before we instruct the
draftsman to prepare the bill, because, even if we
are only building “ a castle in Spain,” we had better
now decide how high and deep the building shall be,
how many rooms it shall contain, and leave the ques-
tion of the decorations for future consideration.
There are many definitions and provisions which the
draftsman must insert, and members of the Conven-
tion cannot insert those as they go along. But with
regard to all the principles that must be embodied in
the contract, and all the terms vital to its being
carried out, we should clear the ground as we go
along, so that we shall not afterwards have to retrace
our steps and make fresh arrangements. With this
view I shall at once propose an amendment upon the
resolution before us. I beg to move :
That all the words after the word “ That ” be struck out.
The Chairman : The lion, member can only do
that if the mover of the present amendment with-
draws it.
Mr. GORDON : I did not understand that the
original amendment had any prescriptive right.
The Chairman : The original question was that
this resolution be agreed to. Since then Mr. Deakin
has proposed, by way of an amendment:
That after the word “customs” the words “and excise”
shall be introduced.
Mr. Ftsh : I understand that the hon. member,
Mr. Gordon, desires to move a prior amendment,
and, therefore, he would be in order.
Mr. GORDON : Perhaps the hon. member will
temporarily withdraw his suggestion as to excise. I
did not understand, from the proceedings of the day,
that the hon. member made the motion formally.
He certainly suggested it, but it does not appear on
the business paper.
Mr. Deakin : I have no objection to withdraw
the amendment if that be necessary for the fullest
consideration of the resolution.
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
Mr. GORDON: I am much obliged to the hon.
member. The amendment which 1 propose is as
follows:
That all the words after the word “ That” be omitted with
a view to the insertion in lieu thereof of the words:—
“ (1.) The customs duties imposed by the federated colonies
upon goods imported from places outside such colonies
shall be uniform, and shall be fixed by the federal
government, and that such excise duties as may be
agreed upon shall be similarly fixed.
(2.) That trade between the federated colonies shall be
absolutely free.
(3.) That all bounties for manufacture or production shall
be offered only by the federal Parliament, and that
all bounties now offered by any of the federated colonies
for manufacture or production shall be withdrawn.
(4.) That upon all railway lines which in the opinion of the
federal government are lines affecting trade between
any two or more of the federated colonies, a uniform
charge for carriage to be fixed by the federal govern-
ment, shall prevail.
(5.) That the expenses of the federal government shall be
apportioned annually between the colonies in propor-
tion to their respective populations.”
Leaving out of consideration for a moment the
question as to who shall collect the customs duties,
which I shall deal with presently, there are some
important additions which, it appears to me, must be
imported into this resolution before it can be said to
fairly embody the terms of the contract into which it
is proposed the various colonies shall enter. This is
largely a commercial treaty, and its initiation is really
the promotion of the trade and commerce of these
colonies, as it is pretty generally admitted was the
case in the federation of the American colonies.
There were some other conditions affecting their
federation which happily do not surround us; but it
is chiefly in the commercial interests of these colonies
that we desire to federate. If this is a commercial
treaty, it behoves us to see that its terms are fairly
set out, so that each colony coming into the federa-
tion may understand the bargain which it is making,
and as far as possible that such provisions be drawn


up as will prevent irritation from afterwards arising.
We want, therefore, in the first place, to see what we
are going to pay, and in the next place what we are
going to get from federation. A knowledge of what
the price is to be, and what are the advantages to be
secured by the price paid, is the first preliminary to a
commercial bargain, and the only delegate who made
an attempt to tackle the question, “ What have we to
pay?” was the hon. member, Mr. McMillan. We
were pretty much on the heights of Pisgah before,
viewing the promised land from a distance ; but the
hon. member tried to ascertain our position and to come
down to the hard logic of facts. He told us it will
cost £2,000,000 to support the federal parliament,
and to carry out the purposes for which it will be
established. I believe the hon. member is well within
the mark in that estimate, and that the cost will be
more. But for the purpose of my argument I shall
assume that federation will cost £2,000,000. As to
the conclusion which he founded on some of his
figures, that the colonies would get the money back
again in the shape of the decreased rate of interest
at which they could borrow, I believe that to be
thoroughly unsound, and it does not support his
deservedly great reputation as a financier.
Mr. McMillan : I only mentioned that as one of
the incidental matters in connection with the subject.
I did not want to form any argument of a logical
nature upon it.
Mr. GORDON : I did not hear the hon. member’s
speech ; but in the official report it certainly appears
as a very substantial argument. Nothing could
be more substantial than a statement to the
colonies to the effect that if they spend £2,000,000
upon federation, they would get that sum back within
a few thousaud pounds by the decreased interest
which they would have to pay for loans. It appears
to me that the argument would be a good one, if
true ; but I believe that it is most unsound. Under-
lying the fact that the federal parliament would
be able to borrow more cheaply than the colonies now
do is the fact that it would have to take over the
assets of the colonies. But Ido not think that that
is possible. If they did take over the debts they
would only take over those incurred on good assets.
It is not to be supposed that they would take over
the debts incurred in building breakwaters that
shelter no ships, railways that carry no goods, or
jetties on which the grass is growing, and in the other
reckless expenditure in which every colony has in-
dulged. There are such assets everywhere, and only
the other day I saw it stated that the great colony of
Victoria was going to close one of her railways. The
federal government would only take our picked assets,
upon which they could borrow cheaply, and we should
be left with our bad assets, upon which we would
have to go, cap in hand, to the Jews, to get any money
at all, so that we should more than lose the advantage
which we now have of being able to borrow at a cheap
rate upon our good assets.
Mr. Munko : I rise to order. Is it understood
that in Committee hon. members, speaking upon a
special resolution, may debate all the matters that
were raised in the discussion in the Convention ? At
the present time the hon. member is supposed to be
speaking upon a special resolution before the Com-
mittee ; but ho is really replying to a* speech made
by the hon. member, Mr. McMillan, when the whole
of the resolutions were before us. If we go on in
that way we shall never finish the business.
The Chairman: I think that the hon. member,
when he proposed his amendment, ought to have
handed it into the clerk, so that I might be able to
understand whether he was speaking to the resolutions
generally, or to the amendment. The hon. member
would certainly not be in order in speaking of matters
irrelevant to his amendment; but I have not had
an opportunity of forming an opinion as to whether
he is doing so.
Mr. GrORDON : I am dealing with excise duties,
in relation to the question with which the hon.
member, Mr. McMillan, dealt the other day.
Mr. Mtjniio : The hon. member was dealing with
loans —a different question altogether !
Mr. GORDON: I am dealing with certain
questions touching excise duties, and I believe I am
in order in doing so. I shall be very loath to attempt
to draw the discussion into channels which would
waste time ; but, in my opinion, I am trying to save
time by dealing with the questions treated in the
resolution before the Convention, namely, the collec-
tion of the excise duties, why we are asked to surrender
them, and, if we surrender them, what we are to get
for them. It appears to me that my remarks are in
the main to the resolution before the Committee,
and I shall continue them, as shortly as possible,
unless hon. members object. I think I have shown
that the conclusions arrived at by the hon. member,
Mr. McMillan, are not justified by his figures; but 1
will assume that his estimate of the cost of the federal
government to the various colonies will be £2,000,000.
That is what we have to pay. Now, what shall we
get for it ? A treaty, which is really a commercial
bargain, is what has to be enacted by this Convention,
and we must see that the commercial advantages to
be gained by it, great as they will be, are clearly
assured to us by it. I have as much reliance as any
hon. member on the good faith of the colonies; but
at the same time I think that it is a quality to be kept
as much in reserve as possible, to be drawn upon
only when necessary, and the clearer the terms of
the contract, the less chance there will be of irrita-
tion and disagreement in the future. I think it
necessary, therefore, that the stipulations embodied
in my amendment should come on at this stage.
First of all, the duties must be uniform. Of course,
I know that it will be finally enacted by the Conven-
tion that the duties should be uniform ; but it is as
well to state it, as also, following the amendment of
the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, with regard to excise
duties, that only certain excise duties should be
included. The dictionary definition of excise em-
braces a good deal more than the local parliaments
will give up. According to the English definition of
the word it embraces licenses ; but the definition,
which I have no doubt every member of the Conven-
tion intends, is simply duties upon articles of home
production, especially spirits. My amendment,
therefore, would provide that certain excise duties to
be agreed upon should be handed over. Then we
come to the question of the abolition of the bounties
offered, by the various governments. Now, what
would be the good of free-trade between the colonies
if, in one colony, we have bounty-fed goods compet-
ing with goods manufactured in a colony where there
are no bounties? Quite recently, in the great colony
of Victoria, and out of a magnificent surplus which
that colony earned under the able management of the
late government, a sum of between £250,000 and
£300,000 was devoted towards the promotion of local
industries.
Colonel Smith : That is nearly all gone !
Mr. GORDON : If it is nearly all gone, I can
only congratulate the farmers on having secured it.
I have no doubt that that policy, with which I most
heartily disagree, because I think that bounties are
most vicious, having been once initiated, is likely to
be repeated.
Mr. Mtjnbo : No fear!
Mr. GORDON : The money, however, has not all
gone, and Victoria is not the only colony which has
offered bounties for the promotion of the manufac-
ture of home products. In my own colony of South
Australia we have offered a bonus for the growth of
a certain quantity of sugar. What would out
Queensland friends say to us if, with free-trade
between the colonies, we were to supply them with
bounty-fed sugar, as against their production, which


had no bounty to support it ? To make this a fair
contract, we shall have to provide that the federal
government shall only fix bounties on home-groAvn
goods or manufactures,'and that all bounties noAv
offered by the various governments shall be absolutely
abolished. That appears to me to be essentially
necessary to making a fair contract on the basis of
intercolonial free-trade. I now come to the next
point, namely, that there shall be a provision which
shall prevent a war of railway tariffs. What will be
the good of free-trade between the colonies if, for
instance, at Broken Hill, NeAV South Wales having
no railway to a seaport on her shores, South Australia
can charge an enormously high rate of carriage upon
NeAV South Wales goods carried to one of her oAvn
ports ; or, if New South Wales, having a railway to
one of her OAvn ports, and South Australia having a
railway to one of hers, one of these colonies chooses
to initiate a Avar of tariffs, and to carry goods at a
loss, in order to tempt the goods of other colonies to
her lines ? By this means the Avhole of the benefits
of the contract would be swept away, and a barrier
Avould be erected, more insurmountable, more irritat-
ing, and which Avould lead to more vindictive re-
prisals than under any system of protection ever
invented. The system of protection, after all, has
some social basis to Avork upon; it is not purely a
commercial system of pounds, shillings, and pence;
but a Avar of railway tariffs has nothing to commend
it. It is essential, before giving up customs duties,
before contributing to the federal government, before
the colonies come into the contract at all, that these
tAvo points, and especially the last-mentioned one,
should be settled by the colonies. If the railway
lines between any tAvo or more of the colonies are
decided by the federal parliament to be lines affecting
the trade between the colonies, the federal parlia-
ment alone should have the right to fix the rates.
Then we shall get the benefit of the contract. I do
not think that, with these conditions up to this point,
the colonies Avill be paying too much if they pay
£2,000,000 per annum for federation. I anticipate
the greatest advantage to the commerce of the conti-
rent from the freedom of the borders from customs
duties, and from united action in commercial matters.
The two conditions which I have indicated, however,
must be clearly understood. As far as I am con-
cerned—l have not mentioned this matter to any of
my colleagues, excepting the hon. member, Sir John
DoAvner, a couple of minutes ago—l shall agree to no
treaty which does not embrace those conditions, and
in terms respecting which there can be no possible
mistake whatever. We now come to the last clause
embraced in my amendment, and which covers the
point as to Avhether these customs duties shall be
collected by the various governments or by the federal
parliament. It appears to me that the collection of
duties by the federal government will bring about
Avhat the hon. member, Sir Thomas Mclhvraith, so
happily described as a dislocation of the finances.
Each of these colonies is very heavily in debt. Take
South Australia: Her debt is something over
£20,000,000, and her customs duties reach £600,000
a year. We require every penny of that money as it
comes in ; and not to obtain it as it comes in, or as
much of it as Ave can possiby get, means financing ;
it means going to the banks. How long is it likely
that a federal government will lock up the £8,000,000
Avhich they will collect from the customs ?
Mr. BAKER : They can hand it over CA'ery day!
Mr. GORDON : It is impossible to hand it over
every day. lIOAV is the executive to knoAV Avhat
money Avi 11 be required ? Supposing the federal
government reserves £2,000,000 for their expenditure,
will it not be competent for the federal parliament to
make it £4,000,000 or £1,000,000? Therefore, the
federal government must always hold a A'ery large
surplus over and above Avhat the government may
reasonably think Avill be required for federal pur-
poses. If £2,000,000 per annum is the estimated
amount required, it appears to me that, in order to be
well within their borders, in order to have reserve
funds, and to be able to carry on the work of govern-
ment, they will have to keep something like
£4,000,000 in hand, and that means a contribution
from South Australia of £400,000 annually, which
will be kept from her, it appears to me —of course
this is entirely a suggestion—for long periods of
time. Supposing the federal parliament only sits
four months once in the year there will be eight
months during which there will be no arrangement as
to the disposition of the finances, and during which
the executive of the federal parliament will not know
w r hat expenditure their parliament is going to insist
upon. They certainly must retain at least £4,000,000
every year in order to carry out their duties, and in
order to be well supported for any expenditure the
federal parliament may authorise. As South Aus-
tralia is at present situated she cannot afford to let
£400,000 per annum —and I do not think that is an
unreasonable estimate —be locked up by the federal
government. It appears to me that this will be a
most exjiensive way of collecting £2,000,000. To say
that the federal government shall collect £8,000,000
and hand back £6,000,000 is to say that they are
adopting absolutely the most expensive and round-
about way of collecting £2,000,000. Why not let
the colonies hand over £2,000,000, as provided by
the federal parliament, at once P
Sir John Beat: We have not agreed about the
£2,000,000 as yet; it is only imaginary at present!
Mr. GORDON : My argument is founded on the
supposition that the figures of the hou. member, Mr.
McMillan, are correct. I do not say that they are
correct; but I think they are nearly correct. I do
not think any delegate will estimate the cost of the
federal parliament at much under £2,000,000 ; but
Avhatever the amount may be, it is simply a matter
of proportion. The difficulty remains, that a very
large amount of money will be kept out of the hands
of the treasurers of the various colonies, and Avhich
the smaller colonies can ill afford to have reserved.
Mr. McMillan : That includes a large amount
which we pay under any circumstances !
Mr. GORDON: No doubt it includes defences.
Let us take the case of South Australia Avith regard
to defences. W e pay £50,000 a year for our defences ;
but our share of £2,000,000 Avill be £200,000, so
that Ave will be paying £150,000 more than Ave are at
present paying. The difficulty is this : it is not only
the amount Ave have to pay but it is the fact that a
large amount of money Avhich we Avant from day to
day Avill be absolutely locked up. I place this sug-
gestion, which I Avill not further labour, before the
Convention. Apart from that point, hoAvever, this
will be for other reasons the most expensive Avay of
collecting the £2,000,000, or whatever the amount
required for the federal government may be. I am
sure it will involve a large increase of officers. There
will have to be a system of checking. You cannot
collect the moneys of a colony, out of Avhich deduc-
tions haA r e to be made, and the balance refunded,
Avith a staff that is sufficient to simply collect the
amount and hand it over to one authority.
Mr. Muneo : Why not?
Mr. GORDON: You cannot perform a double
business operation of that sort as easily as you can
perform a single business operation.
Mr. Muneo : Cannot a cheque for £IO,OOO be
draAvn without appointing an additional officer ?
Mr. GORDON: I will take the hon. member’s
own illustration. You cannot receive £IO,OOO, and
draw a cheque for £2,000 and a cheque for £B,OOO as
cheaply as you can receive £IO,OOO and draAV a
cheque for £IO,OOO. It is an ate proposition in
financial business Avhich cannot be controverted, that
you cannot perform a large double business operation
of this kind as cheaply as a single one. It involves


a double set of books, and it must, in tbe nature of
things, be more expensive. It is a question also
whether the system proposed will not involve a dis-
location of the civil service of all the colonies, as well
as a dislocation of the finances. The customs service
of every colony forms a large portion of its civil
service, and the customs officers will have to be
transferred to the federal government. Some of the
colonies have regulations which give their civil ser-
vants pensions and some have not; and the colonies
that give pensions to their civil servants will be
involved either in a most expensive computation of
pensions or in some adjustment of the relations
between the civil servants themselves. This is, I think,
quite clear. We have no system of pensions to civil
servants in South Australia, and we are not going to
take over civil servants of the other colonies with their
pensions or right to earn pensions. So the colonies
with a civil service, such as that of this large colony of
New South Wales, where the civil servants, either from
length of service or other causes, earn pensions, will
have to compute their pensions or make a bargain with
the civil servants which will reimburse them for the
loss they will incur by serving under another
government, or the federal government will have to
take over their pensions, which it is not likely to do.
Federation involves a dislocation of finances, a most
expensive mode of collecting the money required,
and a large expense for readjustment of the civil
service. On these points it seems to me that the
simplest system will be for the colonies to pay over
to the federal government the contribution which
the federal government adjudges they must pay.
Mr. Playford : That is the old confederation in
America which broke down !
Mr. GORDON : I am aw r are that it is the system
of finance that prevailed under the American con-
federation, which broke down, however, from causes
that will not happen here.
Colonel Smith : Suppose one colony refused to pay
its proportion P
Mr. GORDON: If one colony dared to refuse to
pay its proportion, its credit on the London money
market would be lost altogether. It is as easy to
say that one colony will bring about a revolution
and secede from the federation as not pay its pro-
portion. lam astonished that the hon. member,
who has so much pride in the resources of the
colony of Victoria, should suggest that any of the
colonies will not pay its contribution. To my mind
the thing is absolutely unthinkable —at least, as
much as that any one of the colonies will secede
from the union. Referring to the interjection of
the hon. member, Mr. Playford, I say that the
causes that led to the breakdown of the financial
arrangements of the old American confederacy are
not likely to happen here. That was the result of
the strain of a long war, which we are not likely to
have here. The difficulties of transport would
prevent a long war. No nation in the world,
excepting the Chinese, could keep up three or four
campaigns against a country 12,000 miles away; and
we have in addition the navies of old England riding
the seas to protect us. The American confederacy
had no protections of this kind. The only argument
in favour of the central government not collecting
the revenues is that the American confederacy broke
down under the same system; but, in a reasonable
contemplation of events, we may say that it broke
down from causes that will not affect us here. Even
supposing it were reasonable to suggest such a
breakdown, considering the distance and the possi-
bilities, the balance of convenience is undoubtedly in
favour of my contention; and when the strain does
come it will be much cheaper for us to make new
financial arrangements then, than to go on during
the next fifty or sixty years paying through the nose
as we should do for such an arrangement as the
resolutions propose. lam aware that this sugges-
tion of mine contemplates a somewhat looser bond of
union than the resolutions contemplate—that
follows as a matter of course; but if we are to
achieve anything beyond a step in consultation, the
agreement at which we do arrive will have to be
somewhat less than the union contemplated by the
resolutions now before the Convention. I think
that the arrangement which I suggest will allow
Western Australia to come into the federation on
something like reasonable grounds. The hon. dele-
gates from that colony tell us that they cannot give
up their customs duties right away. They might be
allowed to keep them, and pay only such a contribu-
tion for defence as the federal government decided
was their fair share for the protection afforded
them, and which, I am sure, that colony would gladly
pay.
Amendment proposed,
Mr. McMILLAN: With all respect to my hon.
friend opposite, I think we are in great danger of
misconceiving the exact character of the debate upon
these resolutions. As far as I understand, these
resolutions were never intended to be amended in the
elaborate manner foreshadowed by the hon. member,
and it seems to me that if we take that course we are
simply now going through the discussion that will
have to be carried out in a committee upon financial
matters. I take it for granted that probably one of
the schemes to facilitate business will be after these
resolutions have been passed in some shape or other,
to have a series of committees dealing specifically
with certain subjects, and then the outcome of those
committees will be resolutions of a character which
will form the basis of a bill which will be capable of
scientific amendment. It seems to me, therefore,
that unless we try to pass the general principles
which only are embodied in these resolutions, we may
get into second reading speeches, which may really
be a reiteration of the elaborate speeches of last week;
consequently I would urge upon my hon. friend and
others that it would be better for us to pass these
resolutions with any verbal amendments that may be
necessary; but simply embodying in the result the
principles of the resolutions.
Mr. Gordon : These are principles in the amend-
ment —as much principles as in the resolutions!
Sir JOHN BRAY : I would ask the hon. member,
Mr. Gordon, to withdraw the amendment. I may
say, in justice to Sir Samuel Griffith, that it was not
ho who suggested that we should pass the resolutions
in a general shape and discuss the matters afterwards,
when they were embodied in a bill. It was I who
made that suggestion. It is impossible, in a large
Committee like this, to attempt to draft a bill. That
is what we shall be attempting to do if we go into
these details. We have not had the amendments before
us in print, and it is hardly fair to ask us, without
seeing them in print, to agree to a series of proposals
like these. It is a pity that Mr. McMillan went into
figures to the extent that he did, because he has
thrown out the suggestion that the federal govern-
ment will cost £2,000,000 without telling us how he
arrived at the estimate. Unless w r e know what the
federal government is going to do it is impossible
to form an estimate of its cost. I agree with Mr.
Gordon in saying this ; that if w r e all understand that
the cost of the federal government is going to be
£2,000,000 we could arrive at a much easier way of
collecting it than by giving the federal government
power to collect £8,000,000 of customs duties, all of
which they do not want, but we have not agreed on
it. We cannot yet tell what the federal government
is to consist of, and what its powers are. I agree
with Sir Samuel Griffith, that they will have to bo
considered carefully and put into a bill. We must
not ask this Committee to decide upon details until
w r e see them all in print, I agree with the sugges-
tion of the hon. member, Mr. McMillan, that as far
as possible we should adopt the resolutions now, it


being distinctly understood that we shall have the
fullest opportunity of dealing with them in a com-
plete shape when the bill is brought in. If it is
necessary to deal with t'he resolutions in this way we
may fairly do it now, but we should not be taken by
surprise by having important amendments proposed
before we have seen what is to be proposed in print.
Mr. DEAKIN : I would only say that if the hon.
delegate, Mr. McMillan, is prepared with a motion
to refer these resolutions to the various committees,
to be dealt with by them in their various branches,
I should be glad to bow to that proposal, and to
withdraw the amendment in reference to excise which
I moved the other day, and also to withold certain
other amendments which I proposed to move at a
later stage in regard to fiscal arrangements. It
seems the proper way to deal with the different
matters in separate committees, in the first instance,
as that gives a better prospect of their speedy and
satisfactory settlement than dealing with them in
this large Committee. I shall be glad, therefore, to
fall in with the suggestion which has been made,
and to withhold the amendments I propose to move,
if such be the pleasure of the Committee. The
points referred to by the hon. member, Mr. Gordon,
are worthy of most careful consideration. The hon.
member has brought them forward in a manner to
command the attention of the Convention. The
Convention does not desire to avoid their considera-
tion, but to discuss them at this stage appears to
many hon. members to be inexpedient.
Mr. MCMILLAN : I do not propose that we should
go into Committee at once, but that we should pass
the resolutions as they stand, embodying the prin-
ciples, and then to proceed to the appointment of
committees.
Sir JOHN DOWNER: I disagree so radically
with the details of some of the resolutions that I
think I should not be satisfied with their being
passed in the formal way suggested. We have had
much discussion about the houses of parliament and
the relative rights of the senate and the house of
representatives ; and are we, as a matter of form, to
pass a resolution contrary to the opinion of a large
majority, or at least of a large section, of the dele-
gates F I think the suggestion of the hon. member,
Mr. Deakin, a very good one. After the long dis-
cussion which we had when we were sitting as a
Convention, we should appoint committees to bring
up a report as to any bill which may be necessary.
But if we are to go through these resolutions in
Committee and pass them, we must treat them as
matters of substance, and not at all as matters of
form. We are not to introduce details such as are
contained in my hon. friend, Mr. Gordon's amend-
ment, upon which, although not inconsistent with
the form of the resolutions, it is, nevertheless, inex-
pedient that we should come to a determination at
the present stage. I cordially agree with the sug-
gestion of the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, in which
he appears, unhappily, to have misunderstood the
hon. member, Mr. M'Millan, for which I am sorry.
I should have been glad if the hon. member, Mr.
M'Millan had intended what he seemed to suggest.
The sooner we have the committees appointed in
the manner which he suggested, the better for
us all, and the more time we shall have at our
disposal.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: As I understand,
these resolutions were brought forward as a first
basis upon which to found the constitution, so
that we might settle the general principles upon
which the constitution is to be framed. And we are
in Committee to consider them, not to adopt them as
they stand, but to make such modifications in sub-
stance as will commend them to the convention. It
would be quite foreign to the objects of the proposer
to ingraft on them anything like' details. That must
be left to a subsequent stage. I indicated on Friday
some doubt as to whether the resolutions themselves
went sufficiently into detail to enable a select com-
mittee to go to work ; but, on reconsideration, I
confess myself converted to the view suggested
by the hon. member, Sir John Bray, that we ought
to agree to these resolutions, with such modifica-
tions as are necessary, and then set to work in
committee. And no doubt we shall have different
committees. A committee of delegates who are finan-
cial experts, as suggested by Mr. Wrixon, will deal with
financial matters, and the constitutional branch of the
subject might be'intrusted to other hon. members. If this
is the correct view, I would deprecate any attempt to
add additional resolutions to those now before the
Committee. That should be left to a subsequent
stage, when these and other details will have to be
dealt with. I believe that that will carry out the
original intention of the mover, and I have come
to the conclusion that it will facilitate business ; but
it is certain that we cannot make further progress
until we have disposed of these proposals.
Mr. WRIXON: The proposal to appoint the
committee is excellent; but there are two points on
which we require a general understanding. One is
the question of state rights, and the other that of the
customs duties—the power of the federal parlia-
ment, and how it shall impose customs duties. I
believe that the difference of opinion on these points
in the Convention is not so very great, and that when
they are rightly looked into we may soon arrive at
an agreement. It will assist us if we so deal with
the resolutions as to avoid matters of detail, and the
sooner the committees are appointed the better.
Mr. GORDON : I should be glad to withdraw the
amendment with the protest that it embraces ques-
tions of policy on which a direction should be given
to the committee. The committee itself ought not
to be allowed to decide a question of national policy.
The point of my amendment, that the duties shall be
uniform, is undoubtedly a matter of national policy.
My amendment with regard to bounties is of a some-
what smaller character, but is essential; and my
amendment with regard to uniform railway rates on
lines which affect intercolonial trade is undoubtedly
a most substantial amendment, and a matter of
national policy. If the Convention by a majority
decides to leave matters of policy to committees, I
shall have nothing more to say ; but I protest that
my amendment does include matters of policy on
which the Convention ought specially to direct the
committees, The committees will have to take into
consideration very large details, no doubt, and a great
deal of scope must be given to their inquiries ; but
to leave to the committees questions of broad policy
such as these will not, I most respectively protest, be
consonant with the duties of the Convention.
Mr. MACDONALD-PATERSON : I rise to make
an observation with regard to what has been repeated
by the hon. member, Mr. Gordon, on the question :
That the trade and intercourse between the federated
colonies, whether by means of land carriage or coastal naviga-
tion, shall be absolutely free.
The hon. member is under the apprehension that he
is the only delegate who holds these views. The
question has, I know, been discussed by myself and a
number of others, and we mutually agreed, particu-
larly on the advice of the hon. member, Mr. Clark, to
leave these subordinate matters to be worked out in
Committee. Questions of subordinate or provincial
policy are undoubtedly involved in this very sub-sec-
tion. I wish hon. members to quite understand that the
question of what may be termed the Australasian
consolidated finance, and that very question of rail-
way tariffs in the interior —because it is no use having
a customs union and perfect harmony of trade on the
coast if we have a war of railway tariffs in the interior
—have been discussed amongst many hon. members
The hon. member, Mr. Gordon, will not, I trust, be


under the apprehension that he is the only delegate
who has thought of these questions. Committee is, I
hold, the proper place to work out these questions,
and I trust the suggestion to leave them to sub-com-
mittees will be carried out.
Mr. DIBBS : I think my hon. friend, Mr. McMil-
lan, has not dealt very generously with the hon.
member, Mr. Gordon, in condemning his remarks on
the amendment. I have looked upon the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. Gordon, during the sittings of the Conven-
tion as the most eloquent listener of all the delegates.
We have heard nothing from the hon. member until
to-day, and he spoke on what may be considered a
fair amendment of the resolutions. There is no
doubt that the various sub-heads of the questions to
be defined in the constitution bill can be best dealt
with by committees. But I would ask the Conven-
tion whether, when the committees bring up their
reports, hon. members will be prevented from dis-
cussing the subject-matter of those reports ? The
time which has so far been consumed in discussing
the amendment has not been wasted, because it has
been the means of throwing a certain amount of light
on difficult questions. For instance, in regard to the
bounties and the possible war of railway tariffs, the
hon. member has raised two points which are worthy
of our consideration, and which will have to be con-
sidered, in the first instance by committees, and
afterwards by the Convention, I deprecate alto-
gether any desire to hastily conclude the sittings of
the Convention when we have just reached the very
kernel of the business. All we have done up to the
present time has been to make each other understand
our views in set speeches ; but the real kernel of the
whole business is, on what terms and conditions are
we to construct this constitution ? A very easy way
out of the difficulty has already been foreshadowed
by several hon. members. The resolutions will not
pass the Convention until they have been amended ;
they cannot be amended until they have been dis-
cussed, and if amendments are to be made in one
direction why should they not be made in another ?
I would make a suggestion which I think will meet
the views of the hon. member who moved the resolu-
tions in the first instance. The hon, member told us
distinctly that he introduced the resolutions not to
form a basis for the constitution, but for the purpose
of eliciting the views of hon. members. He says he
is not bound strictly by the resolutions, and that
being so, why should he not withdraw the whole of
the resolutions and appoint sub-committees to bring
up reports on the various sub-heads of the constitu-
tion ? Then we might have a discussion, and we
might arrive at such conclusions as might become the
basis of a bill. But as long as the resolutions are
before the House they will be open to amendment.
I intend to move one or two amendments on the 3rd
and 4th resolutions, but I shall be very glad to waive
my undoubted right to move amendments, if the
whole of the resolutions are withdrawn and the ques-
tions referred to sub-committees.
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
. Mr. DEAKIN : I simply desire to know where we
stand, and what is intended to be the method of deal-
ing with these resolutions ? If it is proposed to
amend them on general lines, I have amendments of
a general character; and if it is intended to refer them
to committees, I do not desire to occupy the time of
the Convention. I think we ought to arrive at some
understanding which will be fair to all the delegates
as to how we are to deal with the resolutions. Per-
haps the mover will indicate his views. For instance,
on this question of excise—the question with which
we were dealing before the hon. member, Mr. Gordon,
moved his amendment —is it proposed to deal now
with a question of that sort! Because if it is, I wish
to amend my former amendment, and to submit it in
this form :
That the resolution be amended by the insertion after the
words “customs duties” of the words, “and duties of excise
upon goods the subject of customs duties.”
Amendment proposed.
Sir HENRY PARKES : The discussion this morn-
ing has almost convinced me that we are aiming to
some extent at very different objects. My hon.
friend, Mr. Gordon, obviously does not want a union
at all; what he wants is a federation of the colonies
—colonies themselves really conducting business of a
federal character. But what these resolutions con-
template is the creation of a federal government for
the whole of Australia, which is quite a different
thing. Now, when I had the honor to submit the
resolutions, I took occasion to repeat several times
that I submitted the resolutions to be discussed, to be
amended, to be rejected, to be dealt with in any way
that the Convention thought fit; but I never sup-
posed that if they were amended or rejected other
matter would not be put in their place to give to the
Convention what I think is essential before it can go
into Committee beyond the Committee of the Whole
—that is, an outline of the basis of the constitution
which we seek to bring into existence. Take the
resolution on which the hon. member, Mr. Deakin,
has moved an amendment. It seems to me that what
his amendment expresses is implied in the resolution
as it now stands, and seeing that the resolutions are
at best only an indication of the broadest features of
the constitution which we seek to create, we should
enter upon a useless and laborious course if we sought
to add to them all those conditions which certainly
must be added in the bill. My object was simply to
put before the Convention an embodiment of what
may be called the cardinal principles, such, for ex-
ample, as a legislature of two houses, and not
of one ; such for example, as the electoral basis of
the house of representatives ; such for example as
the power of dealing with all bills imposing bur-
dens on the people, or appropriating their money.
These seemed to me to be the essential parts,
forming in reality the very soul of any scheme
to which we can agree. But these all presup-
pose a federal government and a federal parliament
for the whole of the colonies, and it is giving the
go-by to our objects, as so embodied, to speak of
states confederating as they now exist in doing
some kind of federal work which they never can do
except in the most imperfect manner in their separate
states. I hope I make it plain now that lam quite
willing that any amendment should be made; in
fact, I should rejoice to see any made, so long as
there is no attempt to add details, which must in
the result be imperfect, because any attempt of that
kind cannot embrace all the details, and it wmuld
therefore be better to omit all. Ido not care, so far
as these resolutions are concerned, as they have been
submitted by me, if everyone is altered, so long as
the simple basis embodying what the Convention
aims at in point of foundation principles is agreed to.
Ido not think I need detain the Convention longer,
for I have already tried to explain the sense in which
1 submitted these resolutions.
Mr. BARTON : It does seem to me that, after the
statement we have had from the mover of these re-
solutions, there cannot possibly be any objection to
the adoption of the amendment which has been
moved by the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, because if
the resolution now before us is extended to cover
the ground of excise upon articles subjected to cus-
toms duties, the hon. member’s amendment will make
clear what, perhaps, is not now quite clear, and it is,
therefore, unobjectionable. If, on the other hand,
it be an amendment in point of principle, it is con-
ceded by the mover of the resolutions that amend-
ments in point of principle are what we have now to
deal with. In either case, therefore, it does appear
to me —subject to correction —that the amend-
ment moved by the hon. member, Mr. Deakin,


is one which we might entertain at this time, and
with which we might deal at once. We do not want
to be told out of doors, or indeed anywhere else, that
in giving to the federal government the power to deal
with customs duties we did not include the power to
deal with excise on articles subject to those customs
duties. If we pass the resolution before us in this
form, I am afraid that that is what we shall be told.
We are, therefore, in this position : that the resolu-
tion intends the thing now proposed, but does not
make the intention clear, and, if it does not make the
intention clear, the amendment offers a fair ground
of debate, and is quite within the principles upon
which the resolutions are submitted. In either case,
therefore, I hope the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, will
not withdraw his amendment.
Mr. GORDON: The point so clearly put by the
hon member, Mr. Barton, satisfies me— as I am sure
it must satisfy every member of this Convention—
that, seeing that the object of the resolution is to
establish an absolute equation of trade if that
expression be permissible—between the colonies any
proposition which substantially affects the position
sought to be established involves a principle which
ought to be discussed in open Convention, and not
in a committee. The question of whether excise
duties shall also be fixed by the federal government
is no stronger as a matter of principle than the
question as to whether bounties shall be fixed by it.
In fact, if the one question may reasonably be con-
sidered, the other has equally strong claims upon
our consideration. • Stronger still are the claims of
the question of railway rates, and if the object of the
resolution be to establish a commercial equation—
to place all the colonies absolutely, or as nearly as
possible, upon the same basis as to trade and inter-
course —then I submit that most strong support is
given to me by the clear argument of the hon. member,
Mr, Barton, that any proposition which will effect
that purpose —and my amendment does most strongly
effect it—much more so in fact than the amendment
of Mr. Deakin —should be considered at once by the
Convention. I think there can be no doubt but that
the propositions I submitted should be considered in
open Convention. I confess, however, that I am a
little confused as to my position. Are we to pass
resolutions now with which we do not agree, and to
express our disagreement subsequently, or are we to
amend them or appoint committees to lick them
into shape ? That question is exercising the mind of
the Convention I am sure as much as it is exercising
my own mind, which is not at all clear upon the
subject.
Mr. MUNRO : I think the delegate from South
Australia who has just spoken misunderstands the
position of the mover of the resolutions. He does
not say they cannot be amended, but what he does
say is that they should not be hampered by too much
detail at this stage. I quite agree that the sugges-
tion of the hon. memberwill come very properly before
the Committee. But if we are to include in the
present resolution every detail that can be imagined—
Mr, Gordon : I do not propose that!
Mr. MUNRO: I do not think the question of
railway tariffs is one of those details which should be
included now.
Mr. Gordon ; It is a question of national policy!
Mr. MUNRO : I quite admit that.
Mr. Gordon : Then it is not a detail!
Mr. MUNRO : I could name half-a-dozen other
questions which are quite as important; but they
are not questions which bear directly on the resolu-
tion before the Committee. They are altogether
different questions. While I understand that the
resolutions ought to be amended upon questions of
principle, when the majority of the Convention
is hostile to the principle included in any par-
ticular resolution, still if we are going to make
any resolution dealing with the principle only the
vehicle for bringing before the Committee all
the details that can be brought before it, our con-
sideration of the resolutions will be extended over
six months or more; in fact, the Avhole thing will go
wrong. I quite agree that the original resolution
really implies all that the hon. member, Mr. Deakin’s
amendment suggests; but I, for my part, should
prefer that he should withdraw it now, and that we
should carry the resolution as it stands. We all
intend what the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, intends,
but we are not agreed that this is the stage at which
the matter should be considered.
Mr. KINGSTON : I confess that I thoroughly
disagree with the remarks of the hon. gentleman
who has just resumed his seat, and who suggested
that the amendment moved by the hon. member, Mr.
Gordon, dealt with matters of detail only. To my
mind it dealt with principles of the highest im-
portance, which, unless affirmed, will interfere with
the establishment of intercolonial free-trade. If wo
are simply to prescribe that there shall be interco-
lonial free-trade while leaving the various states, so
far as their railway systems are concerned, to pursue
the cut-throat policy which they have already
adopted in certain instances, I am sure we shall not
reap one-half the advantage from intercolonial free-
trade which we are anticipating. lam sure we shall
not derive those advantages which we have a right
to secure, and which we should be able to secure if,
in framing this federal constitution, we provided for
the abolition of the system the hon. member, Mr,
Gordon, has attacked, I think we shall also be
making a great mistake if we do not lay it down as
clearly as possible that not only shall the federal
government have control over customs duties, but
that they shall also have control over duties of
excise, and power to prevent the continuance of the
system of bounties established in some of the
colonies, which would subject the manufacturer in other
less favoured districts to serious disadvantages. But
it appears to me that the error into which the hon.
member for South Australia fell was in attempting
to deal with these resolutions in a wholesale manner,
and in trying to practically strike out resolutions 2
and 3. The hon. member also submitted his resolu-
tions without having given the Convention an
opportunity of seeing them in print, and of fully
considering them. Instead of endeavouring to secure
the affirmation in one block of the principles
embodied in his resolutions, the hon, gentleman
should seek to ingraft on the resolutions we are now
considering the principles he has so ably advocated.
That, I think, can be done without any serious
interference with the language of the resolutions. I
am sure it will commend itself to the good sense of
hon. members, that when we are giving instructions
to the draftsman who will be intrusted with the
preparation of the bill we ought to lay down as
clearly as possible precise rules for his guidance on
matters of principle. But, as regards these three
questions—uniformity of tariff in the whole of the
federated states ; the control by the federal govern-
ment of duties of excise
The Chairman : I would remind the hon. member
that he is discussing matters that are entirely
irrelevant to the amendment proposed by the hon.
member, Mr. Deakin, The proposal is that there
shall be added to the resolution on the paper these
words, “ and duties of excise upon goods the subject
of customs duties.” The hon. member is referring
in very general terms to the amendment of the hon.
member, Mr. Gordon.
Mr. KINGSTON : At the particular moment when
you called me to order, sir, I was referring to the sub-
ject embodied in the amendment of Mr. Deakin —that
of the control of the duties of excise. I accept your
suggestion that the debate should be confined to that
one question ; but I hope that after we have affirmed


the principle embodied in the amendment now before
us we shall be able to deal with the other amendments
relating to similar matters of principle, in which case
I promise the hon. member for South Australia, Mr.
Gordon, my hearty support.
Mr. THYNNE: On the last sitting day I sug-
gested that the amendment of the hon. member, Mr.
Deakin, should be postponed for further considera-
tion. lam not sorry that it was postponed, for it
has in the meantime evidently received further con-
sideration, at any rate from the hon. gentleman who
moved it. But it seems to mo that the amendment
as now proposed, is tending in the wrong direction.
Its effect will be to give to the federal parliament
power to impose excise duties only on those articles
upon which import duties are imposed. That in-
volves, I think, a forgetfulncss of the powers to be
conferred on the federal parliament. The functions
in relation to defence and other matters which we
intrust to the federal government are such as only
this Convention, and no other power, can limit.
There is no limit to the claims that may under certain
circumstances be made upon the resources of the
federal government. The amendment now proposed
tends in the direction of limiting the power of the
federal parliament in regard to excise to the imposi-
tion of duties upon certain articles only. I think
the_ federal parliament must have power to impose
excise duties upon everything. It struck me on
Eriday that this question of excise duties raised a
very important question as to how far the power of
taxation which belongs to the states may be affected
by a similar power of taxation being possessed by the
federal parliament. The federal government may in
the future come under great stress of circumstances,
and there should be no limit to its power of taxation.
The necessity is here shown of seeing that the
several state governments are properly represented
and protected. I think that the amendment in its
altered form ought not to be accepted. If excise
duties are to be imposed, and if the power must be
given to the federal parliament to impose them, that
power must be given to them without limit. Instead
of proposing to limit the excise duties to goods upon
which import duties are already imposed, I hope the
hon. member, Mr. Deakin, will revert to the amend-
ment he originally proposed. I think that when the
federal parliament is constituted the people will have
sufficient confidence in it to believe that it will not
impose duties of excise in a way detrimental to the
best interest of the community.
Sir/THOMAS McILWBAITHI thought the
objection of the lion, member, Mr. Thynne, would
have taken quite a different direction to that which
it did. I like the amendment better now than in its
former shape. But as the hon. member who moved
it has given so few reasons in its support, I look for
these more in what other hon. gentlemen have said.
The only reason given by the hon. member, Mr.
Deakin, was that his proposal would make the powers
of the federal parliament more uniform. Now, uni-
formity in a customs tariff means that the customs
tariff shall affect all the states equally ; but uniform-
ity in excise is a very different thing. A uniform
excise duty may be a duty which oppresses one state,
and is paid by one state only. Eor instance, take the
case mentioned the other day the hon. member, Mr.
Donaldson. Suppose the federal parliament decided
to impose an excise duty on sugar, what would be
the effect? It would fall almost entirely upon
Queensland. New South Wales would be affected
to a small extent, but the other colonies would not
come under the operation of the excise. I agree that
the federal parliament, having control of the customs,
must also have control of excise. But I believe—
and this is why I am not going to oppose the amend-
ment of the hon. member, Mr. Deakin—that we
ought to put a limitation to that power in the bill
itself that is to say, we should limit the power of
the federal parliament to impose excise duties to
articles that are produced bv the colonies equally, or,
at all events, produced by all the colonies for export.
You cannot select for excise an article like sugar, for
instance, which is produced in one colony and ex-
ported to another, because you defeat one of the
principal objects we have in view, namely, free-trade
between all the colonies, and especially for home
products. There would not be absolute free-trade
between the colonies. Of course I do not believe
that the federal parliament would exercise the power
I have indicated; but Ido not think it should be
given to them without the limitation suggested. The
Premier of Victoria instanced a case that showed
the absolute necessity of their having that power.
The hon. gentleman referred to -the familiar article
of whiskey, and pointed out that one colony could
get all the trade of the colonies by simply lowering
the excise duty. No doubt that is so, and on that
account we must give the federal parliament the
power of controlling excise duties. But for the pro-
tection of the particular colonies, we must limit that
power. It is. very easily limited, because excise duties
are confined in all the colonies, and to only three
articles—beer, spirits, and tobacco, and we can easily
make a special reference to those three articles, and,
therefore, as far as they are concerned, there is not
the slightest objection to the amendment of the hon.
member, Mr. Deakin. I will not say anything more
about the amendment, because I shall expect to see
embodied in the bill the limitation I have suggested.
There is another point the hon. member has for-
gotten. In these colonies, there are not only im-
port and excise duties, but there are also export
duties, and he has forgotten to make any mention of
these.
Mr. DEAKIN: "We have not come to them yet.
In submitting this amendment, I did so almost with-
out remark, because I thought I was following in the
footsteps of the mover of the resolution by simply
giving a general indication of what I thought was
desirable, instead of entering into a detailed considera-
tion of the question involved. It was for that reason I
said nothing, and not, as the hon. member, Sir
Thomas Mcllwraith, appears to suppose, because
there was nothing to say. On the contrary, although
I recognise the eminent standing of that hon. member
in everything relating to finance, I would point out
to him what appears to me to be a misapprehension
into which he himself has fallen in considering this
question. That was when he spoke of the danger of
allowing the federal government the power of impos-
ing excise oil articles the product of only one or two
colonies, and seemed to imagine that it might be made
the means of oppressing those colonies. That is pos-
sible ; but it is also possible that it might be necessary
to have the power of imposing excise even though the
article chosen might be the product of only one
colony. An excise duty is often associated with a
protective tariff, and if an article is highly protected,
it might, perhaps, be found necessary for the purposes
of revenue, to be able to collect an excise on goods
subject to a customs duty. It would be perfectly
possible to adjust an excise upon that particular
article if produced by one colony in relation to the
protective tariff so as to do perfect justice to the
industry affected, while obtaining a revenue for the
state. Ido not wish to enter upon these subjects,
because it would be possible to occupy the whole day
with the discussion of this question alone. Eor the
same reason, I am prepared, having brought the sub-
ject before the Committee, either to withdraw the
amendment or to put it in another form, because I
presume our object is not to carry a precise amend-
ment that shall embody all the details of the views of
the Committee, but rather to give another committee
a general direction to enable it to bring up a recom-
mendation which we shall then be able to debate,
having something definite before us.


Mr. PLAYEORD : I trust that if the hon. mem-
ber presses his amendment he will do so without any
limitation, because in .a matter of this kind the
powers of the federal body should be the same as
those given to the federal body in the United States
and the Dominion of Canada. Hon. members will
see, on consideration, that bv giving the power of
levying customs duties on particular articles you
have given as much power to injure a particular
colony —if the federal government would be so
wicked as to do anything of the sort —as by giving
this power of imposing excise. If the federal
parliament desires to raise revenue, and they can do
so better by means of an excise duty than in any other
way, they certainly should have the power. I quite
agree with hon. members who say that as far as
possible we should deal only with the more impor-
tant matters connected with the subject, without
going into detail. As I pointed out the other day,
there is one point connected with this matter of
more importance than any one of the subjects
introduced by hon. members. That is, that in
giving the power to levy customs duties throughout
the colonies there should, at any rate, be a proviso
that the customs duties, when levied, shall be uniform.
Mr. GOEDON : Why not specify that ?
Mr. PLAYFORD ; There is not the slightest
necessity to put that in this resolution. I guarantee
that it will appear in the bill which will be prepared
by a committee, and if it does not we can easily
insert it. At present it is only waste of time to
discuss such questions. So long as we indicate the
main principles that will be sufficient for the
draftsman, and the sooner wo settle those main
principles, and the sooner we appoint another com-
mittee to prepare the bill, the sooner will our labours
be brought to an end.
Mr. BAKER: There is one word in the resolution
which the hon. members, Mr. Playford and Mr.
Thynne, appear to have overlooked. I mean the
word " exclusively." It is not intended by this reso-
lution to limit in any way the power of the federal
government to impose taxation. I quite agree that
it is impossible to provide any limitation in the
exercise of a power the objects of -which are un-
limited. The objects of this federal government,
including as they do the question of the defence of
these colonies, are unlimited, and we shall have to
give the federal parliament unlimited power of
taxation. We are only dealing now with that form
of taxation with respect to which it shall have
exclusive power, and therefore I think that the hon.
member, Mr. Deakin, is right in not proposing to
place a limit on the exclusive power of the federal
government to impose excise duties, and that the
amendment, as suggested by him, is the amendment
which "we ought to carry. I take it that we are now
asked to pass resolutions with which we agree,
admitting as we all do, that they do not in any way
cover the whole of the ground. This is all we are
asked to do, and that is all I am prepared to do at
the present.
Mr. THYNNE : I wish to point out to the hon.
member, Mr. Baker, that the resolution, if followed
up, would be the one most likely to lead to difficulty
between the state and federal governments. Because
if the view ho takes is this : that when an excise
duty is imposed by a state government upon goods
produced in its own state, it is deprived of the
power of imposing that excise duty the moment the
federal government imposes an import duty upon
the same goods, he will take away from the state
governments immediately the whole of their powers
of taxation. This resolution raises a very important
question as to the future privileges of the state and
federal governments. We ought not to run away
from this question now, but should stick to it until
we come to some conclusion. We are trying to make
haste, and may make the less speed with our work.
Amendment agreed to.
Mr. GORDON: I beg to move:
That after the word “excise” the following words be
added:—“and to offer bounties.”
Mr. DIBBS: I should like to know from the
mover of this amendment if it is his intention to
practically destroy the bounty system existing in
Victoria?
Mr. Gillies : It will not affect it!
Mr. Muneo : They will bo used up before that
can apply!
Mr. DIBBS: There will be no bounties given in
any of the colonies, except by the authority of the
federal government ?
Mr. Bakee : Hear, Hear !
Amendment agreed to.
Mr. DEAKIN : Since it is the general consensus
of opinion, as I gather it, that we at the present time
should confine ourselves, as far as possible, to broad
general issues, and not enter into details, I shall
refrain from proposing the amendment which I have
drawn. It has reference to the limitation to be
imposed upon the fiscal powers of the federal parlia-
ment in the first years of its existence. The question
has been already brought under the notice of the
Convention, and it would be unnecessary for me to
make any further remarks concerning it were it not
for a misapprehension which has gradually increased
since the remarks which the Victorian delegates
made in the early stages of the debate. It is per-
fectly open to us to adopt either of two or three
different modes of dealing with the fiscal issue. It
might be laid down in the constitution that the
federal parliament should commence, in the first
instance, with a system of perfect free-trade, and
should not impose any customs duties without the
direct warrant of its constituents. That would be
one proposal; and I feel sure that it will not com-
mend itself for a moment to the members of this
Convention, because it would disregard the vested
interests which have been created, not in one only
of the Australian colonies, but in every colony except
one, and even in that one to some slight degree.
Then there is the other proposition, which would bo
much more grateful to myself and to some other
members of the Convention. It is that the federal
constitution should set out with the adoption of a
protective tariff, and leave it to the federal parlia-
ment, if it thought fit at a future date, to gradually
reduce that tariff. This, it might fairly be contended,
should be an equitable recognition of existing rights,
and would not trammel the freedom of the future
federal parliament to any serious degree. As I learn,
however, from the remarks which have been made by
the delegates during this debate, there is some objec-
tion to take that course, and, as far as I could gather
the trend of their comments, they prefer to allow the
federal parliament to commence with this fiscal issue
exactly as it stands in the several colonies. It is to
propose a federal tariff which shall take the place of
the different tariffs now in existence in the various
colonies, and to impose any excise duties which may
be necessary for the proper working of those import
duties. It has been generally admitted —although
there are one or two delegates who have taken a
contrary view—that the future federal parliament
will adopt a protective tariff; and that, estab-
lishing intercolonial free-trade, it will be certain
to impose protective duties against imports from
the outside world. It seems to have been imagined
that this should furnish a quite sufficient answer to
the delegates of those colonies who consider that the
industries in their states are entitled to some special
consideration —inasmuch as they have been built up
under state encouragement and state support —
before the support on which they have rested is
rudely swept away. I wish to point out, however,
that that argument has only a limited application.


It is perfectly possible for a future federal parlia-
ment to adopt a protective tariff, on the Tasmanian
basis, which would leave every one of the continental
colonies out in the cold. The Tasmanian tariff, if I
remember rightly, ranges on an average at about 121
per cent., and the federal parliament would by
adopting this standard incidentally expose the
industries of South Australia, Queensland, Western
Australia, as far as they have been developed, and
certainly those of Victoria, to far greater competition
than hitherto. It would expose the industries which
have been built up under a protective tariff of 25 per
cent, to competition under a tariff of per cent. The
federal parliament will, to my mind, certainly adopt
a protective tariff; but it is a question of moment
as to whether that protective tariff takes the 12| per
cent, rate of Tasmania, the 15 per cent, rate of
Queensland, the 20 or 25 per cent, rate of South
Australia, or the still higher rate of Victoria; and
that is an all-important question to the colony that
has the highest protective tariff of any colony in
the group. Then, again, hon. members have said
that Victorian industries have had the benefit of the
Victorian tariff for twenty-five years past; but the
Victorian tariff, like every other tariff, has been
built up by gradual accretions, and it is only for the
last two or three years that the industries there have
enjoyed a tariff at the present high rate.
Mr. MUNRO : Two years !
Mr. DEAKIN : Two years. Eurther than this,
there are industries coming into existence every
year, and, consequently, there are a number of
manufactures in which there is a large amount of
capital invested, which have only been started since
thejmposition of the last tariff, and have only had one
or two years of protection. I think that the members
of the committee charged with the consideration of
the fiscal question may fairly have their attention
called to these points: that the colony which has
the highest protective duties stands in a peculiar
position, and is entitled to have that position
considered, and that all the colonies having protective
tariffs are entitled to have their interests equally
considered. This is an argument, although it comes
from Victoria, which applies to other colonies. An
hon. member behind me interjected that the revenue
necessities of a federal parliament will impel it in
the direction of a protective tariff. I believe they
will do so, and I am farther of opinion that when
we thrash out this question, and consider the position
of the smaller colonies from which it is proposed to
withdraw their customs revenue, ably put by the
hon. member, Mr. Gordon, to-day, and by the hon.
member, Mr. Hackett, last week, we shall find that
it will be necessary to make provision so that those
colonies shall suffer little or no loss for some years
to come. This matter will indirectly affect the
extent and height of duties in the federal protective
tariff. Consequently I am prepared to leave it in
the hands of the committee to draft such a clause in
the constitution as shall seem to them to offer the
just protection to which the infant industries of all
the colonies of Australia are fully entitled. Eor my
part, I am convinced that w r hen the federal parlia-
ment in its turn comes to consider the question, it
will be governed not merely by revenue consider-
ations, but will also remember that these protected
industries have ceased to be Victorian or South Aus-
tralian, and have become national industries, and that
it is its duty to protect national industries, and to con-
serve national interests. We all frankly admit what
the Chairman of Committees has stated, that New
South Wales possesses unexampled facilities for the
development of native industries with the assistance
of a protective tariff; we admit the enormous
natural resources of Queensland, with an extent
which dwarfs that of Victoria into insignificance;
w r e admit the advantages enjoyed by the colony of
South Australia, and the central situation of its
capital for commanding the interior of the continent;
we admit all that; hue what we say in Victoria is
that we are perfectly content, providing our indus-
tries receive that just protection to which they are
entitled against the outside world, to rely upon the
enterprise of our people to maintain the industries
we have, and to let them stand their chance with the
rest when Australia has become one nation.
Resolution, as amended, agreed to as follows :
That the power and authority to impose customs duties
and duties of excise upon goods the subject of customs
duties, and to offer bounties, shall be exclusively
lodged in the federal government and parliament,
subject to such disposal of the revenues thence derived
as shall be agreed upon.
Postponed resolution agreed to :
(2.) That the trade and intercourse between the federated
colonies, whether by means of land carriage or coastal
navigation, shall be absolutely free.
Resolution agreed to :
(4.) That the military and naval defence of Australia shall
be intrusted to federal forces, under one command.
Preamble agreed to:
Subject to these and other necessary conditions, this Con-
vention approves of the framing of a federal constitu-
tion, which shall establish—
Resolution proposed :
(1.) A parliament, to consist of a senate and a house of repre-
sentatives, the former consisting of an equal number of
members from each province, to be elected by a system
which shall provide for the retirement of one-third
of the members every years, so securing to the
body itself a perpetual existence combined with definite
responsibility to the electors, the latter to be elected
by districts formed on a population basis, and to
possess the sole power of originating and amending
all bills appropriating revenue or imposing taxation.
Amendment (Mr. Baker) proposed:
That the resolution be amended by the omission of the
words “a senate and a house of representatives, the
former,” with a view to the insertion in their places of
the words, “two chambers, the one.”
Mr. GILLIES: I hope that we shall not omits
those words. If we omit those words now, it appears
to me to be an indication that the Committee dis-
approves altogether of calling the chambers a senate
and a house of representatives. I think that the
Committee will not disapprove of the use of the
words “senate” and “house of representatives.” I
have not heard of any better term than “ senate ” to
apply to the upper branch of the legislature when it
is appointed, nor of a better term than “ house of
representatives ” to apply to the other house ; and if
we now agree to omit those words it must clearly be
an indication that the Committee approves of the
omission of those words as indicating the respective
houses. I do not think that wo ought to do that.
Mr. BARTON : Ido not think that the omission of
these words, and the insertion of the others proposed,
will be an indication that the Committee disapproves
of the terms chosen; but that, in this important,
though rather subsidiary matter, the Committee
does not desire to come to a determination without
leaving it to some sub-committee, as has been sug-
gested, to consider the various names that might
really express the ideas underlying those two bodies.
It has always seemed to me that, inasmuch as it is
proposed that both these chambers should have a
representative basis —as the idea of the repre-
sentation of the people in one way or the other
is at the bottom of each of them—we should get
rid of the distinction between the word “senate”
and the words “ house of representatives.” lam not
discussing the question now, but I am simply put-
ing forward a view on which, at any rate, the Com-
mittee might well exercise its admitted power of
choice, namely, that it will be better to get rid of the
idea of a senate and house of representatives,
because both those bodies arc to be representative
bodies, and that it would be a good idea to get rid of


the word “ council,” because, in some places, we
have been accustomed to associate councils with
nominee bodies, Avhich neither of those houses is to
be. Inasmuch as they are both to be representative,
I may give one example of names that might be sug-
gested to the sub-committee amongst others which
they will consider. The idea of the federation —of
the equal powers of the states —is to be embodied in
one of these chambers; the idea of the national will
as expressed by the national method of election by
the people in the constituencies is to be embodied in
the other. But, both being of a representative charac-
ter, and, therefore, of the character of what we call
“ assemblies,” why not call one the “ federal assem-
bly” and the other the “national assembly”? If
you do that you express, at any rate, the idea that
is at the bottom of the composition of both of them,
namely, the idea of representation as we have been
accustomed to express it by the use of the Avord
“assembly” —and you express also the federal idea
which enters into the composition of one, and the
idea of the representation of the people as a Avhole,
in their accustomed subdivisions of electorates, in the
other.
Sir Henet Paekes : Assembly No. 1 and assem-
bly No. 2!
Mr. BARTON: Call Avhichever you like No. 1,
and whichever you like No. 2 ; but inasmuch as No.
1 and No. 2 would be perfectly meaningless, and the
words I have suggested would have a meaning, I
suggest that the sub-committee Avould rather take
my suggestion into consideration.
Mr. WRIXON: "Would it not be well if Ave deter-
mine the powers of the bodies ? The names could
be decided afterwards. What does all this question
of name, which is entertaining the Convention,
matter ? The real point is to determine the powers
to give to the two houses. If Ave delay in discuss-
ing the names, Ave shall be some time in settling
the really important matter that Ave have to deter-
mine.
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH: I think there is
something in the objection made by the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. Gillies. If we strike out these words we
really affirm that we disapprove of the names
“ senate ” and “ house of representatives.” We do
not want to do anything of the sort. It is better to
leave the matter to the sub-committee with the words
as they are.
Mr. BAKER : I originally rose Avith the view of
seeking to amend the resolution by leaving out the
Avord “ senate ” and inserting other words in lieu
thereof, and I was proceeding to give reasons for the
omission that I was about to propose, AAhen I Avas
met, I understood, by a unanimous wish on behalf of
the Committee, to strike out all the Avords and leave
the matter open. Therefore I gave up my original
intention. If I am .mistaken, and the Committee
wish to discuss the matter now, I should like to give
some reasons why I propose to leaA’e out the word
“ senate ” and insert other Avords in lieu thereof.
Mr. Platfoed : Thrash it out noAV !
Mr. BAKER: The reason why I wish to leaA r e
out the word “senate” and insert in lieu thereof
the words “ council of the states,” is because I
believe that when they go back to their own
colonies, and to their own constituencies, it will
facilitate hon. members of this Convention in
explaining the federal compact to the people
of those colonies. When we see the great difference
of opinion which has arisen, even in this Convention,
in reference to the powers that ought to be intrusted
to the so-called senate, Avhich I prefer to call the
“ council of the states,” and when we see that that
difference of opinion has, to a very great extent,
arisen from confusion in the minds of some hon.
delegates as to what the proper functions of the
federal council of the states ought to be —when we see
that they haA r e confused them with the functions of
a second chamber in a Unitarian form of government
—it will surely facilitate them in explaining to the
people the federal constitution if we give the senate
a name that is indicative of its poAvers and of its
constitution. I do not say “ states council.” A
“ states council” is entirely a different thing from a
“council of the states,” which can exist only in a federal
form of government; and it is indicative of the fact
that that council of the states is composed of represent-
atives from the different states. When the framers
of the constitution of Switzerland formed their neAV
constitution they had before them not only their own
long experience in different forms of confederate
government, but also the experience of America for
fifty or sixty years, and they deliberately altered the
name “ senate,” Avhich was in use in America, to
“ council of the states,” which is the term which is
noAV applied to the upper chamber in Switzerland,
and they used that term to indicate exactly what
they meant. They used that term to indicate that
the people of Switzerland AA r ere represented in that
upper chamber by states —that the people who
formed that council of the states were the represent-
atives of the states. It is indicative of the federal
idea, and I believe that it is a much better term than
“ senate.” I admit that it has objections. It has
two. In the first place, it is a little bit too long,
although not longer than “ house of representatives.”
In the next place, it contains the term “ council,”
which some hon. members seem to think is not a term
Avhich is particularly beloved by the people, and some
confusion may arise from the use of that Avord in the
name ; but Avhen the term is “ the council of the
states,” it seem to me to perfectly clearly express that
which will be the body representing the states in this
federal constitution.
Sir GEORGE GREY: I think the arguments
used by the last speaker are forcible, so far as that
name goes. Why not let that name stand, and call
the other chamber the “ house of commons,” as re-
presenting the commons —everybody in the country ?
Mr. BAKER: I shall first propose to strike out
these words, and when they are struck out I shall
propose to insert the words “ council of the states,”
as the name for one branch of the legislature, and I
understand that some other member of the Conven-
tion will ask to insert other words to indicate the
name and nature of the second branch of the legis-
lature.
Sir SAMUEL GRIEEITH : There are two quite
different questions involved in this amendment —one
whether the name of the two houses shall be a senate
and a house of representatives, and the other whether
we shall settle that matter noAV, or leave it to a
committee.
An Hon. Membee : Leave it!
Sir SAMUEL GRIEEITH : If we are going to
leave it we had better simply say that there shall be
two chambers ; but it will be very hard for a com-
mittee, not knowing the vieAvs of the members of the
Convention, to fix on any two names. On this point
I do not suppose there is any settled division of
opinion amongst hon, members. Each probably has
his OAvn idea as to Avhat will be the best name. The
question is, whether Ave should settle it noAV or after-
wards.
Hon. Delegates : Afterwards !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: What will the com-
mittee have to go upon then ?
An Hon. Delegate : They can recommend ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Yes, they can re-
commend. We shall then have another discussion
upon it.
An Hon. Delegate : Settle it now!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I am disposed to
settle the question now.
Mr. GILLIES: Let the words stand. To alter
the resolution may necessitate a series of amend-
ments.


Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH; The resolution might
he passed as it is, on the understanding that the words
used here are merely provisional names. In sub-
stance, one house will be what is generally known as
a senate and the other as a house o£ representatives,
and I think these terms may be accepted for the
present. These words may stand unless some other
words very strongly commend themselves to the mem-
bers of the committee or the Convention.
Amendment negatived.
Dr. COCKBUEN : I think that we ought to leave
out the word “ province,” and use the word which
has been already mentioned in the foregoing para-
graphs. I move :
That the word “province” be omitted with a view to the
insertion in lieu thei’eof of the word “ colony.”
Amendment agreed to.
Dr. COCKBUEN : I cannot help thinking that it
would be better not to refer principles to the com-
mittee but to leave the committee to work out details
only. We have a blank as regards the number of
years for which the senate shall be elected, and I
think it would be well to leave the question open,
and to insert the words “ proportion of members”
instead of “one-third.” We ought not to fix the
proportion, as that may be a debatable point.
An Hon. Member : Say “ periodical retirement” !
Dr. COCKBUEN : Yes; I would insert the word
“ periodical” before the word “ retirement,” and
leave out the words, “ every years.”
Sir Henry Parkes ; Why?
Dr. COCKBUEN: I think it better, as far as
possible, to refer only questions of detail to the com-
mittee. The hon. member has admitted that by
leaving a blank as to the number of years. I would
leave open the whole question of the periodical re-
tirement of members.
Mr. Gillies : Another important point is whether
the senate are to be elected by the electors or the
states legislature!
Dr. COCKBUEN: I take it that these words
mean that it has to be done by the electors, not by
the houses. The words go on to say, “ with definite
responsibility to the electors,” and as long as there
are any nominated houses in any of the colonies,
there cannot be said to be definite responsibility to
the electors.
Mr. Gillies: Who are the electors? We must
determine that!
Dr. COCKBUEN: It cannot be the local legis-
latures, because there are certain of them with
nominee upper houses, the members of which cannot
be said to have any definite responsibility to the elec-
tors. But I wall not press that point at present.
I move:
That the word “ periodical” be inserted before the word
“ retirement.”
Mr. GILLIES: Before the amendment is put,
sir, may I draw attention to a question which must be
raised and ultimately determined ? Ido not desire
to raise the question now, if it is understood that
it will be considered probably by a select com-
mittee, and be determined on their recommenda-
tion. It is an important point, namely, whether the
members of the senate shall be elected by the par-
liaments of the various colonies or by the general
electors of the colonies under a franchise, perhaps
under the franchise of the legislative assembly ? I
believe there is a strong opinion among hon. members
that the elections to the senate should be made by
the parliaments of the colonies.
Dr. Cockburn: Nominee houses!
Mr. GILLIES : I do not desire to raise the
question now ; but if it is understood that it will be
brought up subsequently I am quite willing to allow
the resolution to go now with the amendment sug-
gested.
Amendment agreed to.
Amendment (Dr. Cockburn) proposed) :
That the words “one-third” be omitted, with a view to
insert in lieu thereof the word “portion.”
Sir HENET PARKES : I am not quite sure that
I understand what is aimed at by these amendments.
It is quite certain that they make the matter more
indefinite and confused, whereas our object is to make
it more definite and more clear, and whether Ave will
or no, if we go on with this work, we must come to
precision, not to indefiniteness. After these amend-
ments are passed we shall have to retrace the ground,
and try to come to some definite conclusion, and some
precise meaning. I certainly cannot understand the
Avisdom of loosening things, of making them more
scattered than they were, instead of trying to com-
press our meaning, and bring it to a point on which
we can all agree, or at least express our reasons for
disagreement. By proposing that it shall be a period-
ical retirement of a proportion of the members Ave
really say nothing at all. We put the thing behind
us again, instead of keeping it steadily before us.
What we want to arrive at, if Ave agree to this mode
of referring the members of the upper chamber to
the people, is the definite number to retire periodi-
cally, and the definite period at which they shall
retire. We must arrive at those two points. Do
what Avewill we can but put it oft*. We may delay it,
but Ave must come back to it. I do not know that
this should be determined by a committee. I think
it should be determined one way or the other by the
Convention itself. I really cannot see that the
amendments will help us in any degree whatever.
Mr. CUTHBEET: I think we ought to relieve
the committee as much as possible of the heavy
duties AA'hich will devolve upon it. I suppose the
senate will be appointed for a term of, say, six years.
In Victoria, a third of the members of the upper
house retire every two years, so that in the event of
any difficulties arising between the two houses, a
fresh batch of members is brought in every lavo
years. If we lay doAvn the rule that a third of the
members of the senate shall retire every two years —
assuming, of course, that the term of their appoint-
ment will be six years —I think we shall be travelling
in the right direction. However, as regards the num-
ber of years, a blank is left in the resolution. It
may be very well left to the committee to say
Avhether the period for which the senate shall be
appointed shall be for six or nine years. I think the
resolution is framed on proper lines. I shall be
very glad to support it as it stands. I think the hon.
member, Dr. Cockburn, will be wise if he withdraws
his amendment, because I think we ought to relieve
the committee as much as possible from any embar-
rassment.
Mr. BARTON: It might save time to point out
that we have, to a certain extent, determined this
matter already. We have inserted the Avord “period-
ical ” —that is to say, AA r e have made the resolution
to read as folloAvs :
A parliament, to consist of a senate and a house of repre-
sentatives, the former consisting of an equal number of
members from each colony, to be elected by a system which
shall provide for the periodical retirement of
It might, of course, be advisable to leave the words
“ a third,” or insert the words “ a proportion ”; but
the number of years to elapse before the periodical
retirement is evidently now a thing with which Ave
have nothing to do. We cannot go back upon the
Avord “ periodical ” without going through a cumbrous
form. The insertion of the word is, so far, a direc-
tion to any sub-committee to fix the period at Avhich
the members are to retire—to fix the meaning of the
Avord “ periodical.”
Amendment negatived.
Mr. BARTON: Consequent upon the amendment
which has just been carried—it appears to me
necessary—and I do not observe that any one else is


prepared to do so —to move another amendment. I
move:
That the words “every —* years” be omitted.
Their retention would be repugnant to the decision to
which the committee has already arrived.
Amendment agreed to.
Mr. MUNEO: I desire to call the attention of the
delegates from Tasmania—the hon. member who
suggested the amendment, Mr. Bird, is not hero—to
an amendment of which I myself do not quite
approve. But unless the amendment be moved now,
they will be unable to bring it forward subsequently.
I refer to the words “ so securing to the body itself
a perpetual existence.” It was contended, I under-
stand, that if these words were retained there would
be no power of dissolving the body under any circum-
stances.
Mr. Burgess : It was only an individual opinion.
Mr. Gillies : When the bill is brought up it will
be quite possible to make an amendment of that
kind!
Mr. CUTHBEET: I should like r to know if it is
understood by the gentlemen present that the reten-
tion of the words “ combined with definite responsi-
bility to the electors ” will leave it an open question
for the committee to say how the senate is to be
elected, whether by the electors or by both houses of
parliament ?
Mr. Platford : That will have to be provided for
in the bill.
Mr. CUTHBEET: If it be left open to the com-
mittee to deal with the matter, I see no objection to
the words ; but if the committee will be bound by
them to say that the elections shall be made by the
electors of each particular colony, I certainly object
to them, I think it should be left to each particular
colony to say in what manner the elections for the
senate shall take place, and that view, I am sure, will
be in accordance with the view of the majority of
members present. I understood that to be the tone
of the debate generally.
Mr. FitzGerald : There is no doubt about that!
Mr. Baker : Let it be left open!
Mr. CUTHBEET: So long as it is left an open
question to the committee, and they are not bound
hand and foot by these words, I have no objection to
them.
Mr, EITZGEEALD: I apprehend that the only
object of inserting these words is to declare that the
committee is opposed to nominee houses. The
senate may be elected either by the houses of parlia-
ment or by the people. In both cases they will be
responsible to the electors, and that is all the para-
graph says.
Sir SAMUEL GEIEEITH ; As a member of the
committee, I should interpret the word “ electors ” as
being synonymous with the word “constituents.”
The words mean, in effect, “ a definite responsibility
to the constituents ” —at least, that is what I under-
stand them to mean.
Mr. Cuthbert : Might they not mean the parlia-
ment P
Mr. Deakin : They relate to anythin".
Sir JOHN DOWNEE : I move:
That the words “ and amending ” be omitted.
My object in moving the amendment is with a view'
to insert afterwards a power of veto in whole or in
part.
Mr. Barton : But not a power of increasing
burdens!
Sir JOHN DOWNEE: No; a power of veto
simply.
Mr. MUNEO : Would it not be well to leave that
question in abeyance until we know what the consti-
tution of the senate is to be ? If we fix the question
definitely now, it may have a serious effect upon
what we are going to do. I think the resolution
should be left as it now stands, with the understand-
ing that the matter will be discussed after the con-
stitution of the senate is determined. That would
be the better course to take. The results might be
serious if the matter were settled now without
our knowing what the constitution of the senate is
to be.
Mr. FitzGerald : Leaving the words as they are
would be a direction to the committee which we do
not want to give them, I think the question should
be left open.
Mr. MUNEO : That is what I am contending for.
What I understand the amendment to mean is this :
that whatever the constitution of the senate may be,
it will have the power to amend money bills.
Sir John Downer : I do not propose that!
Mr. Baker : The hon. member does not say that;
he simply omits the words !
Mr. MUNEO: I understand the resolution as it
stands to give to the house of representatives the sole
right to originate and amend all bills appropri-
ating revenue or imposing taxation. The taking
out of the words “ and amending ” will deprive that
house of the sole powers to amend such bills, and
will give the power of amending to the other chamber
also. That is what it means.
Mr. Baker : Not necessarily !
Mr. G-illies: It indicates that!
Mr, MUNEO: If it does not mean that—and I
will take the advice of the legal gentlemen of the
Convention upon the point—if it does not necessarily
mean that, I will sit down, and will not say another
word on the subject. If the words do mean what I
contend, I think it is imprudent to move the amend-
ment at the present stage, or until we know how the
senate is to be elected.
Mr. WEIXON : I would ask my hon. friend, Sir
John Downer, not to press the amendment, because
there can be no doubt that it raises the whole
question.
Sir John Downer: Hear, hear; I intend to raise it!
Mr. WEIXON: I submit that it would be better
to raise such a serious question at a later stage. I
have given notice of two resolutions that will raise
the whole question, and which, I think, present what
may be a solution of the difficulty. Ido not at all
despair of a solution, and I should be very sorry in-
deed if hon. members on either side were to take up
such a position as to defy a settlement. But that is
a greater reason why the question should not be
decided upon this bare point of omitting the words
“ and amending.” It would really be a direction to
the committee before we have gone into the whole
question. I think it would be better, therefore, to
allow the resolution to pass, and to raise the question,
upon the two resolutions of which I have given
notice, which may be found to contain a solution of
the difficulty. It is too serious a matter to be passed
in a hurry. Upon this question, no doubt, depends
an important feature of the whole movement.
Mr. BAKEE: There can be no doubt but that
the amendment does raise the whole question ; but I
would point out to the hon. member, Mr. Wrixon,
that he cannot move his two amendments until the
words “and amending” are struck out, because if
the words are allowed to remain my hon. friend’s first
proposition is unnecessary. Therefore, I think it will
be consistent with the wishes of the hon. member
himself if the amendment of Sir John Downer be
agreed to. The whole question can then be raised
on the amendments to which the hon. member refers.
There can be no doubt whatever that this is the ques-
tion upon which members of the Convention differ,
and it is, moreover, a question which will have to be
discussed and decided.
Mr. Munro : The question as to whether we arc to
have federation at all will be settled by the decision
of the Committee upon the question raised by the
hon. member’s amendment!


Mr. Clark : Do not say that!
Mr. RAKER: I would point out to the Committee
that if we strike out the words “ and amending ” we
do not affirm anything at all —we simply refuse to
affirm that the senate shall not have the power to
amend. We do not come to any positive conclusion;
we come to a negative conclusion, the conclusion
being that these words be struck out, thus leaving
the matter open for further discussion.
Sir JOHN DOWNER: I may say that the amend-
ment which I shall afterwards propose is not exactly
in the form in which it appears as printed. Ido not
propose that the senate or upper chamber shall have
authority to amend money bills. I only propose to
give them what is called a veto in detail. Before the
lion, member, Mr. Baker, rose it occurred to me that
the striking out of the words as proposed would not
be in the slightest degree inconsistent with the
amendment the hon. member, Mr. Wrixon, himself
proposes, while the retention of them would be in-
consistent. If the amendment of the hon. member,
Mr. Wrixon, is to be carried, the words ought to be
struck out. If the clause were to simply stand as
amended it might open a fruitful source of conflict
between the two houses by analogy with what has
occurred in other colonies, and with what is contained
in the Canadian statute as to whether or not, by
denying the upper chamber the power of originating
money bills, you do not by implication reserve to them
the power of amending such bills. But, of course, I
did not move that these words be struck out with no
intention of proposing the insertion of other words.
I intended to ask the Committee to insert at the end
of the clause the words, “ and the senate shall have
power to reject in whole or in part any such last-
mentioned bills.” Whether the amendment of the
hon. member, Mr. Wrixon, or the suggestion made
by myself be adopted, the proposed amendment will
bo inconsistent with the retention of the words which
I have moved should be omitted.
Sir SAMUEL GRIEEITH : The hon, member,
Mr. Munro, asked what would be the effect of leav-
ing out these words —would it give the senate the
power of amendment ? That raises a very nice ques-
tion. Most of the conflicts that have occurred
between the two houses of legislature in Australia
have arisen from tho use of exactly that form of
words—“ the sole power of originating all bills appro-
priating revenue or imposing taxation.” Those are
the words in the Queensland Constitution. We have
always maintained there that notwithstanding the use
of those words, with no expressed reference to the
power of amendment, our Legislative Council had no
power of amendment, or that if they had the technical
power, they had no right which they should be
allowed to exercise. That position we maintained very
strongly. The question was finally settled as regards
Queensland by a decision of the Privy Council, who
held—they did not give their reasons —that notwith-
standing the use of this form of words the Legislative
Council had not the right of amending money bills.
Probably they decided on the ground that the
Queensland Constitution was framed exactly upon
the analogy of the English Constitution an
elective lower house and a nominee upper house.
That very likely was the reason; but as they did not
give their reasons, it is not of much use speculating as
to the grounds which influenced them. Rut it is quite
certain that in framing a federal constitution we
cannot arfbrd to leave any question of that kind to be
fought out between the two houses, or to be referred
to the Privy Council. We must make up our minds
here what we mean, and say it, so that there shall be
no question about it. If we leave in the words “ and
amending,” there is nothing further to be said ; there
is no room open for any meeting between the two
conflicting views expressed during the debate on these
resolutions, and I think it would be a great misfortune
if, at this yearly stage, we were to preclude that
possibility by insisting upon the retention of these
words. We all agree that only the house of represen-
tatives should have the power of originating money
bills. If we approach this subject in a spirit of com-
promise, as was urged by the President and other
speakers during the debate, I am sure that amongst
the minds present some means will be found of giving
effect to a view that will be satisfactory to all
parties. I am sure that is not beyond our efforts if
we seriously set ourselves to the work. Various sug-
gestions have already been made. It is difficult to
know what will be the one ultimately acccepted; but
I counsel hon. gentlemen to allow these words to be
omitted at the present time.' Let us consider various
possible bases. Whether or not we come to the result
of absolutely excluding any interference by the
senate —and I do not think anybody insists upon the
absolute exclusion of interference—we shall be in a
position to frame the conditions, if any, upon which
interference may be allowed with what may be
technically termed money bills, although in substance
they may be matters affecting great questions of public
policy.
Mr. DEAKIN : While cordially agreeing with the
hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, in his last remarks,
I would point out that even if the present amend-
ment of the hon. member, Sir John Downer, does not
preclude discussion, at any rate, the amendment with
which he proposes to follow it immediately will
absolutely preclude discussion.
Sir John Downer: That is not before us !
Mr. DEAKIN: That is true, but if the under-
standing were arrived at that the hon. member, Sir
John Downer, would not at this stage move his
amendment, and that my hon. colleague, Mr. Wrixon,
should have an opportunity of moving his two reso-
lutions at the conclusion of this series of resolutions,
then we should be prepared to devote the whole of
our attention to this subject singly, having then dis-
posed of all other questions. If Sir John Downer
would agree to forego his second amendment and dis-
cuss it in connection with the resolutions of the hon.
member, Mr. Wrixon, we could pass the remainder of
the resolutions, even with the omission of these words,
and consider the whole question upon those two
resolutions. I suggest this as a simple method of
arriving at an issue.
Sir JOHN DOWNER : I am, of course, entirely
in the hands of the Committee in this matter. If
these words are struck out, nothing will remain in the
resolution, on the face of it, to which I could refuse
my assent, so that it could not be said afterwards that
any of us agreed to something to which we did not agree.
At the same time, we shall have to take this discussion
at some time or other. The question was entered
into at considerable length in the very interesting
debate that took place in the Convention, and I am
not sure that there will be any material advantage in
sending it to a select committee, and then having to
thrash it out afterwards.
Bir Samuel Griffith : No one proposes that.
Mr. Deakin : No; take the discussion of the
resolutions of Mr. Wrixon as soon as we have
finished the others !
Sir JOHN DOWNER : I have no objection, if
these words are struck out, that the further con-
sideration of the resolution should be postponed
until the others are discussed, if that is the sense of
the Committee; but I did not understand that such
was its desire.
Mr. DEAKIN: If these words are struck out,
then the resolution, the hon. member says, will con-
tain nothing that he does not agree with, and it may
be allowed to pass. Nos. 2 and 3 of these sub-
sections may then be dealt with, and we shall be
face to face with the resolutions proposed by the
hon. member, Mr. Wrixon, which directly raise the
question. Then, if Sir John Downer does not agree
with those resolutions, he can move an amendment


so as to bring the Wo views—that which he repre-
sents and that which Mr. Wrixon represents —
directly before the Convention when we have settled
every other question.
Sir JOHN BRAY; I would point out another
view that might be taken. I am one of those who
feel that the people’s house must have the ultimate
power to deal with money bills.
Mr. Baker ; Which is the people’s house ?
Sir JOHN BRAY; The people’s house I take to
be the one that represents the people.
Mr, Deakin : "Directly !
Sir JOHN BRAY : The one which the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. Baker, desires to call the “ council of the
states ” I should not call the people’s house. The
point I take is this : I do not think we shall be able
to give the senate the absolute power to amend
money bills ; at the same time I think we ought to
make some provision such as I suggested when I
spoke in the main debate: that is to say, we should
provide that no matter shall be included in any
money bill—not simply an appropriation bill—which
the senate shall declare should, in the interests of
any one of the colonies or of all of them, bo dealt
with in a separate measure. That is the view I shall
bring before the Convention at a later stage. In
the meantime I think the Committee should strike
out the words “ and amending.” But I think it
would be unwise on the part of Sir John Downer to
proceed at the present time with the other amend-
ment which he has indicated. The resolutions of
the hon. member, Mr. Wrixon, do not appear to me
to meet the case sufficiently.
Sir JOHN DOWNER: What the hon. member,
Mr. Deakin, proposes is this: that we should strike
out the words, “and amending,” then pass the
resolution as a matter of form, and go on with the
other resolutions, and that then the hon. member,
Mr. Wrixon, should move his resolutions, to which
I should move mine as an amendment. I would ask
the hon. member why should not Mr. Wrixon bring
his resolutions forward by way of amendment to
mine ? It seems to me that we are simply asked to
postpone a discussion that must inevitably take
place, and that we shall be in no better position to
consider the question when we have disposed of the
other resolutions than we are at the present time.
lam quite in the hands of the Committee; but it
appears to me that it is open to the hon. member, Mr.
Wrixon, to have his resolutions discussed on the
amendment I intend to move, and this can be done
now more conveniently .than at a later stage.
Mr. Deakin : It would not be so convenient,
because in the other case they could be brought in as
separate resolutions!
Sir JOHN DOWNER: Eor my part, I can see
no difficulty whatever in putting the amendment of
Mr. Wrixon. The hon. member can move that cer-
tain words be omitted from my amendment Avith the
vieAv of inserting his oavu. It is more convenient to
discuss this question at once, as it arises properly
now, than to postpone it.
Sir SAMUEL G-RIEFITH: A difficulty has arisen
from the hon. member’s connecting the present amend-
ment with another which he intends to move after-
Avards, and which is not necessarily connected with
it. No member of the Convention Avill go against
any opinion he has expressed by agreeing to the
omission of these Avords. Many hon. members can-
not agree to the other amendment which the hon.
member Avishes to move. It is unfortunate that the
two matters should be mixed up, because the omission
of these words is a necessary preliminary to the dis-
cussion of the whole matter. •
Amendment agreed to.
Sir JOHN DOWNER; I beg to move:
That the resolution be amended by adding the following
words:—“ The senate to have the power of rejecting in
Avhole or in part any of such last-mentioned bills,”
Sir HENRY PARKES: I Avould appeal to the
hon. member, Sir John Downer, not to press his
amendment now. The matter is one of great serious-
ness, and, if dealt with in this manner, may have an
effect which the hon. member does not foresee. I
am extremely strong in opposition to the amendment,
and for that reason I Avant to see the matter dealt
with with as much deliberation and circumspection
as is consistent Avith economy of time. As this is
certainly one of the most vital provisions of the
Avhole intended scheme, w r e can Avell afford to think
twice before we do anything in the matter. I am
extremely anxious for the union of these colonies—
I do not "think any man living is more anxious—but I
am by no means clear that I could set my hand to two
houses of parliament having co-equal poAvers in deal-
ing with money bills. I think it Avould lead to the
utmost confusion, anarchy, and the disruption of the
union sooner or later. 1 should be willing to safe-
guard the rights of the senate to the fullest extent
consistent with the maintenance of Avhat appears to
be sound principles of gOA r ernment; but I do not see
how tAvo bodies can have equal power in dealing with
matters, Avhich, viewed hoAvever they may be viewed,
are admitted to be the most A r ital questions of good
civil government. There must be somebody to decide,
and the great constitutional struggle in England, as
I obseiwed the other day, has been to see Avho shall
decide, and they have decided that the people of
England as represented in Parliament shall decide.
With regard to the equally representaive character of
these two houses, I am at a loss to conceive how any
hon. gentleman can calmly reason and come to the con-
clusion that their representative character will be
equal. One will not represent the people at all,
except indirectly ; it will represent in fact the states,
and we should haye to get a good definition of Avhat
the meaning of state is before we could say to Avhat
extent the members of this senate —or call it Avhat
you will —would have a represeutatiA'e character. I
remember reading some six years ago, I think, a
definition of what constitutes a state by a very illus-
trious Oriental scholar and a great judge —the late
Sir William Jones. He says that the only thing
that can constitute a state are men —high-minded
men, Avho can see their rights, and, having a just con-
ception of them, dare maintain them. It is not acres
of area ; it is not any species of property ; it is not
toAvered and ornamented cities, or even courts or
armies, but a free people alone Avho can constitute a
state; and that is my view of a state. I do not admit
that there is any other element of national groAvth
except an intelligent population. There can be
no other element, and there ought to be no other
element. When Ave give to South Australia and
South Australia, it must be remembered, has been
one of the slowest of the colonies, although she has
long had responsible government; from some cause
or other, although we have been accustomed to
regard the social strata of South Australia as better
balanced, more happily constructed, than some of
the other colonies, she has been extremely slow in
the progress of the Australian peoples, and she
stands IIOAV Avith a A r ery small proportion of our
population. I say if we are prepared to give to
South Australia —leaving out of sight the youngest
colony, because we cannot deal with her in the same
free way as we may fairly deal with the old colonies
—I, for one, and those Avho think with me, are pre-
pared to give to South Australia just the same
representation in the senate as Ave ourselves have.
We are quite prepared to give her equal power in
the general legislation of the country ; but we say,
"Some one authority must decide as to hoAV the
people are to be taxed, and as to how the product of
the taxes is to be appropriated in the interests of the
people." The issue of the great conflict in the
mother country has been to leave this vast power
exclusively with the representatives of the nation.


"What I ask for now is, that this discussion may take
place, and take place as thoroughly as possible. I
am raising no objection to any man’s view, or to the
force of his argument. I prefer to hear his view
fully stated, and his argument put at its highest
force; but do not let us decide the matter in a
hurry. There will be time enough to-morrow, when
the resolutions of the hon. member, Mr. Wrixon, of
which notice has been given, come on. We shall
then know exactly what we are doing. I appeal to
the hon. member, Sir John Downer, to let the dis-
cussion take place on Mr. Wrixon’s resolutions.
Mr. WEIXON: Quite acquiescing in what the
hon. member, Sir Henry Parkes, has said, I should
be happy to move as an amendment on the amend-
ment of the hon. member, Sir John Downer, the
resolutions of which I have given notice, and that
will raise the question at once. The sooner we
discuss it, the sooner shall we be likely to arrive at
some conclusion. I, therefore, move:
That the amendment be amended by omitting all the
words after the first word “ The ” with a view to insert in
their place the following :
(1.) The senate shall have equal power with the house of
representatives in respect to all bills, except money
bills, bills dealing with duties of customs and excise,
and the annual appropriation bill, and these it shall be
entitled to reject but not to amend.
(2.) The act of union shall provide that it shall not be
lawful to include in the annual appropriation bill any
matter or thing other than the votes of supply for the
ordinary service of the year,
I shall not detain the Committee very long.
Sir Henry Parkes : The hon. member is not
moving the amendment now ?
Mr. WEIXON: Yes; as an amendment on the
amendment of the hon. member, Sir John Downer.
Sir Henry Parkes : I think it will be far better
to leave it till to-morrow !
Mr. WEIXON: The question will be before the
Committee as an amendment on the amendment of
the hon. member, Sir John Downer.
Sir Henry Parkes : It had far better be sub-
mitted as a new clause !
Mr. WEIXON; Of course, if the hon. member,
Sir John Downer, will withdraw his amendment, I
shall be happy to withdraw mine.
Sir John Downer: Why?
Sir Henry Parkes : I understood that the hon.
member, Sir John Downer, had withdrawn his
amendment!
Mr. WEIXON: If it is the wish of the Com-
mittee to deal with the subject by an independent
resolution, I shall be very happy ; but if it is desired
to deal with it now in the form of an amendment, I
am prepared to go on. We need not decide the
matter to-night. We can discuss it now and decide
later on.
Dr. COCKBUEN: I would remind hon. members
that we are now in the third week of our sitting, and
we have had ample time to consider the issues. The
whole issue before us now is whether we shall or shall
not have federation.
Mr, Munro : That is quite true !
Dr. COCKBUEN : Unless something in the form
of the amendment moved by the hon. member, Sir
John Downer, is agreed to, there will be no federation.
Mr. Munro : And if it is carried there will be no
federation.
Dr. COCKBUEN: The whole principle of federa-
tion is to recognise the co-ordinate power of the
population and of the states. There can be no feder-
ation if you give all the powers to the popular
assembly.
Sir Henry Parkes : If the amendment is carried
there will only be federation between South Australia
and Western Australia !
Dr. COCKBUEN: And if it is not carried there
will be no federation at all.
Mr. Munro: Yes, there will!
Dr. COCKBUEN: It is not the spirit of federa-
tion to say that the only thing is federation of the
people.
Sir Henry Parkes : If the amendment is not
carried there will he federation between New South
Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and Tasmania.
Dr. COCKBUEN : That is very questionable. It
would have been well if we had discussed a fortnight
ago whether we should have federation or unification.
It is no use giving representation to the states house
if you emasculate that house by placing all power in
the other house. That is not federation ; and those
who argue that that is what should be done are not
arguing in favour of federation, but in favour of uni-
fication. But we have been sent here to discuss the
question of federation —not the question of unifica-
tion ; and unless the amendment of the hon. member,
Sir John Downer, or something to the same effect,
giving the council of the states, or call it by what
name you will, some sort of power of veto in
detail, as well as in the whole, is carried, you place
the whole power of the purse in the house which
represents population, and you can have no federation
whatever. If you give to that house which, irres-
pective of the boundaries of the states, represents
only the people, you establish unification, and not
federation. This question has been thrashed out in
general debate, and why postpone it longer ? If we
have come here to discuss not federation, but unifi-
cation, then the verdict of this assembly will be a
negative one, though I hope it will not be so given.
I think we have come here prepared to draw up a
scheme of federation, in which the essential point is
that the house which represents the states shall have
some real power —not a mockery of power —and that
the whole purse, which is government, shall not be
taken from it. I do not think we should any longer
refuse to deal with the question. Do not let us be
afraid of the issue, which is: Are we going for feder-
ation or unification ? If we are to have unification
the sooner we get back to our homes the better.
Mr. DBA KIN: Birst of all, I would say to the
hon. member, Dr. Cockburn, that our mission is to
frame an adequate scheme for federation.
Dr. Cockburn: Not for unification?
Mr. Munro : Just to all the colonies!
Mr. DEAKIN: The hon, member, I take it, was
not entitled to interpret that phrase in the strict and
narrow manner which he has attempted. Speaking
for myself, what I, at all events, took as the meaning
of the mandate, was that while the Australasian
.colonies recognised that they had not yet reached —
and probably never will reach' —a condition in which
they desired absolute amalgamation, they had reached
a condition in which they desired a closer union than
has hitherto obtained. The hon. member, admitting
so much, contends that this closer union was never
on any subject, at any time, or in any manner, to sink
what may be termed the individuality of the states :
whereas the contention I would maintain would be,
that while the colonies declared most distinctly and
with an emphatic voice, which has found its echo in
the first resolution moved by the hon, member, Sir
Henry Parkes, that they would not part with their
powers of local self-government on all matters with
which local self-government was competent to deal.
But they were prepared to part with their powers in
relation to certain subjects on which they believed
that the interests of each were the interests of all,
and that the interests of all were the interests of
each. They believed that on certain special subjects
there were no longer two interests —that there were
no longer state interests, but only national interests.
They believed that on those special subjects it would
be possible to safeguard all state interests, and to
commit to a new parliament, to be entitled the federal
parliament, the power of dealing with particular sub-
jects within certain lines, as the people were in
reality on those subjects one people with one destiny


and one interest. The argument which I have en-
deavoured to maintain from the beginning of this
debate has been that, while there are certain state
rights to be guarded, fnost of those rights, if not all
of them, can be guarded by the division of powers
between the central government and the local govern-
ments, The states will retain full powers over the
greater part of the domain in which they at present
enjoy those powers, and will retain them intact for
all time. But in national issues, on the subject of
defence, as people who desire to have their shores
defended, and to see their resources developed by
means of a customs tariff and a customs union—on
these questions there are no longer state rights and
state interests to be guarded in the constitution, but
the people’s interests are one, and they call upon us
to deal with them as one. Do we need to repeat the
commonplaces of every federation speech at every
federation gathering, and every festive gathering, for
many years, which remind us that we are one people,
living under similar forms of government, that we
speak the same language, and that we have the same
general interests, bearing sway quite as much in one
part of Australia as in another ? Are we to"say that
while we are here for union, and to declare for
union, wo shall never have more union than can be
obtained by the maintenance of our separate state
rights in every particular; so that it shall not be
possible for the union to deal with any question,
except by means of the states, and through the states
of which that union is composed ? By the resolutions,
that is not intended. Is it to be contended that
union upon these particular subjects, within this
narrow field, as it may be termed when compared
with the broad field of general legislation, is not to
be consummated, and that we are here to draw up
proposals for a constitution which shall not only re-
tain the state rights, but retain them in an absolute
-supremacy? We may feel perfectly certain from
the outset that such preservation of conflicting
authorities cannot work satisfactorily to the people of
the country. Are we now, in the very inception of
our undertaking, to endeavour to create on the one
side an irresistible force, and on the other side an
immovable object ? Are we to place within the
popular house, with all the authority which attaches
to those who directly represent the people, respon-
sible ministers, -who are to hold their seats only
so long as they can justify their actions to that
chamber ?
Mr. Playford : The hon. member, Sir John Downer,
docs not propose that ! .
Mr. Baker : You arc assuming that we are going
to have responsible government!
Mr. DEAKIN: The request of the hon. member,
Mr, Munro, that these questions should be settled
first, so that we might approach the proposal of the
hon. member, Mr. Wrixon—knowing exactly what
the senate w r as to bo, and what the form of govern-
ment was to be—was refused; and although I admit
that it is not settled yet, I am prepared to argue as
if these contingencies were admitted, because they
are at least most probable. The resolutions of the
hon. member, Sir Henry Parkes, propose to adopt
responsible government; and it is natural to assume,
for the purposes of argument, that they will be
accepted until they have been rejected. Therefore, if
we are to create a house, with all the traditions, so far
as responsible government and its authority is con-
cerned, of the representative chambers which exist
in these colonies and in mother country, and are
then to introduce on the other side, clothed with
equal power, a body entirely foreign to the British
Constitution, and to which there is no sufficient
parallel in the Australian Colonies, wo shall bo
creating at the outset certain conflict and inevitable
dead-lock.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Why ?
Mr. DEAKIN : I will tell the hon. gentleman why.
The popular chamber receives, or believes it receives,
a mandate from the electors to carry a certain measure,
which we will suppose affects finance; or it may be
an ordinary measure, but we will take it to be a
financial measure. It is carried in that chamber by
a large majority; it is sent to the upper chamber,
which, we will take it, for the purpose of argument,
does not represent the people directly, however much
it may represent them indirectly. The second chamber
rejects the measure. The popular chamber, through
its government, passes the measure for the second
time, and the upper house rejects it a second time.
The government advises his Excellency to dissolve
the popular chamber, in order that they may appeal
to their constituents. They appeal to their consti-
tuents ; they come back with a renewed mandate,
given perhaps with stronger voice than before, direct-
ing them to pass the measure. They cannot pass it.
They can never pass it, because the senate may always
stand in the way.
Mr. McMillan : How could that affect a money
bill?
Sir Samuel Griffith : Or any other bill!
Mr. DEAKIN : They come back with a stronger
mandate thau ever from the country to carry the
proposal into law, and the second house rejects it
again and again.
Mr. Cuthbert : But would they do that ?
Mr. DEAKIN ; Well, if you will make a provision
to the effect that they shall not be able to do it, if
hon, members will propose a means by w r hich we shall
see an issue to the conflict, we shall bo proceeding on
proper lines, and we shall have something to assist us.
But as the resolution at present stands we are to
create a second chamber which may defy, for all
time, the will of the people of the country.
Mr. Clark: Nobody wants that!
Mr. DEAKIN: I hope nobody does want it.
Mr. Barton: Cannot yon make your chock apply
to all bills as well as money bills ?
An Hon. Member : A body without any power !
Mr, DEAKIN ; lion, members arc surely guilty
of a fault which they would bo only too ready to at-
tribute to myself, when I say that this interjection
is remarkably extreme. To say that the chamber
which you are perfectly willing to endow with the
power of rejecting a measure, or, if it bo anything
but a monetary measure, of amending it at need, of
negativing for some years the direct mandate of the
popular chamber, and that you only require them to
cease to oppose the popular will when that will has
been definitely and deliberately declared, —if you
say that is not endowing them with power, then I say
there is not a representative chamber in the world
which possesses any power. It is only in a chamber
like that of the United (States Senate of America,
which stands so far above the reach of popular
opinion expressed through the ordinary channels,
that such a course of conduct is possible without a
revolution. And why is it possible ? It is possible,
because the executive in that case is separated from
the legislature ; because the executive is independent
of the two chambers, and because the people look to
the executive to carry out their will as far as ad-
ministration is concerned. But in the constitution
we are about to propose the executive will bo mainly
in the popular chamber of the legislature, and bound
to obey the directions of that chamber. Therefore,
you will have the popular chamber, guided by its
government, and supported by the great majority of
the people of this country, entering into a conflict
with that house which you propose to make the
guardian of state rights. I say that those who are
taking this course, believing they are conserving state
rights and conserving the union, are, to my mind,
under a most serious misapprehension. I can con-
ceive nothing more antagonistic to the continuance
and maintenance of union than to set the bulk of the


population, their representatives in Parliament, and
their responsible government, in perpetual conflict
with an upper house supposed to represent the states.
I say that the equal representation which tho states
demand must be conceded to them, that the power
which the states require for their own protection
must also bo conceded to them. AVhat I contend is,
that it is not necessary, in order to obtain the
adequate protection of all state rights, in order to
secure absolute justice to all the smaller colonies, to
endow tho upper house with tho power to amend
money bills, or to pronounce an absolute veto on all
bills. There are numbers of gentlemen present suffi-
ciently experienced in constitutional government to
bo able to devise a means by which the wishes of the
senate, as representing tho states, should bo given all
the effect which can possibly be given to them, with-
out bringing the constitution to disruption. It is
perfectly possible to endow that chamber with the
power of revision and review', to place them in such
relation with their constituents that they may be in
time of conflict sent back to them, whoever they may
be, in order to receive from them a fresh and further
direction. It may be possible to propose half a dozen
schemes, with none of wffiich I will at present delay
the committee. It ought to be possible to propose
one which should be acceptable to alI reasonable men,
which should endow tho senate, or states house, with
all the powers with which a second chamber can be
endowed, without bringing the progress of legislation
absolutely to a standstill—that is to say, without
rendering it, not only possible, but probable, that
legislation will bo brought to a standstill. My hon.
Co-delegates from Victoria have been accused of in-
troducing into this chamber the party conflicts that
have been waged in that colony; but we should have
been false to our obligations, not only to our own
colony, but also to this Convention, if we had not
warned hon. members of the rocks upon which we
have been nearly shipwrecked. AVhat we say is
that to endow an upper house with these ex-
ceptional privileges and powers, and to provide
no means ior a solution of their difficulties with
the popular chamber, is to invite contention and
prolong deadlocks. AVe say at the same time
that it should be possible to constitute an upper
house so intimately in relation with public opinion
and composed of men so highly qualified that it
should exercise a very large and salutary pow'er
indeed in controlling legislation, and in controlling
even the executive government. AA r esay that all this
is possible, and we admit that all this should be done;
but what we do say is that this bald proposition of
the hon. and learned member, Sir John Downer,
commits us to the other extreme —to the absolute
veto, to the equal control of money bills, which will
lead to twofold discussion of the estimates in the
second chamber—which will lead to the discussion
of the minutest points of the administration of
the executive government in a chamber to which
that government is only indirectly responsible. If
you are about to make this change you should
go further. You should either not make this change,
which is out of harmony with our existing institu-
tions, and cannot bo brought into harmony with a
constitution in which there is responsible govern-
ment rooted in a popular chamber; but if you
do take this step, you should at once, and boldly,
adopt bodily those foreign constitutions to which you
have gone for precedents. If you want the Swiss
Constitution, take the Swiss Constitution; if you
want the American Constitution, take the American
Constitution; but do not attempt to mix them with
the British Constitution.
Mr. Baker: AVhy cannot we have an Australian
constitution P
Mr. DEAKIN : I have not the slightest objection
to having an Australian constitution; but an Austra-
lian constitution that was begun by setting aside the
political experience of the civilised world would have
a poor chance of doing any good. Any constitution
that is built up must bo built on the experience
gained of other constitutions in other parts of the
world.
Mr. Barton : To what experience of federal con-
stitutions is the hon. member appealing ?
Mr. DEAKIN : I am appealing in the first instance
to the fact that there arc radical distinctions between
the American Constitution and those of these colonies.
The radical differences are, that in America the execu-
tive is separated from the legislature ; that the two
chambers and the executive work all three indepen-
dently ; that, although the whole three arc often, if
not at war, entirely at issue, there is provision for
carrying on the government notwithstanding. There
is no such provision in the constitution which is
sketched here. Here your responsible government
is to be made responsible to the representative
chamber.
Mr. Baker: Wc have not agreed to responsible
government yet!
Mr. DEAKIN; It is in this sketch; and if hon.
members depart from the sketch let them do so on
rational grounds. If they, are about to take a new
constitution, let them take one of which we have
some experience, and not a hybrid—something from
the Swiss, something from the British, and something
from our own. They are taking irreconcilable elements
that cannot be made to work in harmony. If hon,
members desire to adopt the Swiss Constitution, let
them adopt it. There they have no dissolution of
the popular chamber, tho government is elected from
the two chambers, and tho system forms a consistent
whole. It may bo worthy tho consideration of the
Convention whether we should or should not adopt
that consistent whole. It may be worthy of con-
sideration whether we should not adopt the American
Constitution with perhaps a little amendment. But
what I wish to say, in answer to the hon. and learned
member, Mr. Barton, is that to introduce the Ameri-
can Senate into the British Constitution is to destroy
both.
Mr, Baker : It is not proposed!
Mr. DEAKIN: There would be an inevitable con-
flict. Either the responsible government and the
popular chamber must rule, as in most English-
speaking, countries, or the senate of state nominees
must rule, as the senate, in most respects, practically
rules in the American republic. We should be aware
of combining irreconcilable elements, and should not
seek to import into this British Constitution a por-
tion of another constitution, and expect it to work
smoothly. Our experience teaches us that the dangers
which wo have run in the past have arisen entirely
from the fact that wc have created upper houses that
claimed more authority than was their due, and have
endeavoured to exorcise it. The propositions which
my hon. colleague has submitted are not propositions
winch any hon. member can honestly say take away
too much from the senate of this country.
Hoy. Members : Oh, oh!
Mr. DEAKIN: They propose that the senate
shall have equal power with the house of represen-
tatives in respect of all bills, except money bills, so
that in every other matter that comes before tho
senate it stands as well equipped for dealing with
legislation as does the popular chamber. There
should be a tribunal to which it would not be too diffi-
cult to appeal in case of differences between the
two houses on those measures ; but, allowing that
to pass, my hon. colleague excepts from the control
of the senate money bills, bills dealing with
customs and excise, and tho annual appropriation
bill. He does not say these may not bo rejected,
but he says that they must not be amended ; he be-
lieves that the second chamber should only exercise
its power with regard to money bills in sucli extreme
cases as those in which it will be prepared to reject


the whole proposal put before it, but should not
meddle with the financial affairs of the country by
entering into the details of those proposals. The
2nd resolution says:
The act of union shall provide that it shall not be lawful
to include in the annual appropriation bill any matter
or thing other than the votes of supply for the
ordinary service of the year.
What this means is that every money bill, which
may be a bill involving a question of policy, shall
come to the second chamber independently, and the
second chamber shall, if it please, be entitled to reject
that measure, to challenge the opinion of the country
upon it, and to say that until the opinion of the
country is pronounced, that measure shall not pass
into law. Are not these large and sufficient powers?
Mr. Adte Douglas : No !
Mr. DEAKIN: If not, show us how we may
broaden them without taking the perilous leap to the
other side of the stream proposed by the hon. and
learned member, Sir John Downer. Surely there is
some via media between the gift of these excessive
powers and that of powers which should be sufficient,
without making the senate equal with the house of
representatives by clothing it with the same authority,
although it has not the same mode of election, nor
the same constituents at its back. Surely there is
some via media to be found. Because we think the
upper houses in our own states do not possess suffi-
cient powers —that the new senate should possess
more powers than the upper houses of our present
states possess —and because we believe that state
rights ought to be protected: surely we will not go
to the other extreme, and say that the senates are to
be all in all, and the majority of the population, no
matter how great, is to be capable of being ignored
on all questions of policy and the smallest detail on
the annual estimates of the year.
Mr. Baker ; No one proposes such an absurdity !
Mr. DEAKIN: It could be done. What we ask
the hon. member, who says that it is an absurdity, is
to join with us in drawing a constitution that shall
prevent that absurdity. He cannot deny that the
amendment proposed by the hon. and learned mem-
ber, Sir John D owner, admits of the possibility —I
say it admits of the probability, if not the certainty
-—of that absurdity. I believe we are all at one in
the object we seek to gain, which is the efficient
protection of state rights, and surely they can be
efficiently protected without allowing the senate to
enter into the consideration of every £lO which it
may be proposed to spend on a post-office or every
£5 increase of salary proposed to be given to a civil
servant. Surely there are a number of questions
which can be dealt with by the popular chamber
without trenching on state rights. Will the hon.
members who consider that these proposals of the
hon. and learned member, Mr. Wrixon, do not give
sufficient power to the second chamber join us in
endeavouring to frame a constitution which shall
give them sufficient, but not absolute power—which
shall say, as the hon. member, Sir John Bray, said in
his most carefully reasoned-out speech, that, “ In
the last resort, and after the fullest consideration
and delay, the will of the majority must rule” ?
Will thay admit that cardinal principle ?
Mr. Baker : We have always admitted that!
Mr. DEAKIN: Well, if hon. members admit it,
will they take care to provide for it, because it is
indisputable on the face of it that the proposal of
the hon. member, Sir John Downer, allows the
minority to rule in everything, if they please. We
all know that minorities, as well as majorities, will
be composed of reasonable men, and that what I
suggest is not likely to take place frequently ; but it
is not our province, as the hon. member, Mr. Gordon,
said, to rely too much on good-feeling without other
guarantees. We must draw a constitution that is
fair upon the face of it, and to be fair on the face of
it it must provide against any abuse o£ authority by
a minority. If the hon. member, Sir John Downer,
will join us in providing against the abuse of power
by a minority I believe he will find every member
of the Convention with him. Let him give the
states all just power, but let him for once protect
the nation. Let us not frame a scheme of govern-
ment expressly designed to provide for the rule of
the minority, instead of that of the majority. If we
are all agreed on that principle we can soon arrive at
an agreement; but in its present form it is certain
that Sir John Downer’s proposal goes too far. Let
us see if w r e cannot find a means of protecting state
rights, and the rights of the majority of the nation
at the same time.
Mr. McMILLAN : I think most hon. members
will agree with me that the atmosphere which has
predominated here since the beginning of our
business has been an atmosphere of compromise—
compromise, as long as we do not give up any vital
principle. It seems to me that we ought, instead of
getting into the absolute corner indicated by some
members at the present time, to try and go, step by
step, and see whether there is a possibility of agree-
ing, and whether, even with our apparent disagree-
ments upon principle, there may not be some
machinery that can- be adopted, say, in a select com-
mittee, which may practically bring about what
members on both sides of the question require. I
find a little ambiguity in the amendments of the hon.
member, Mr. Wrixon. I should be willing to allow
the first amendment to go to a select committee with
one alteration. It reads :
The senate shall have equal power with the house of repre-
sentatives in respect to all bills, except money bills, bills
dealing with duties of customs and excise, and the annual
appropriation bill, and these it shall be entitled to reject but
not to amend.
I should be willing to leave out money bills and make
it read thus:
The senate shall have equal power with the house of repre-
sentatives in respect to all bills except bills dealing with duties
of customs and excise.
Mr. Deakin : Leaving out the annual appropria-
tion bill!
Mr. McMILLAN: It depends upon what the
appropriation bill is. To show my meaning I will
read the next section :
The act of union shall provide that it shall not be lawful to
include in the annual appropriation bill any matter or thing
other than the votes of supply for the ordinary service of the
year.
But that does not do away with the question as to
what money bills are. Furthermore, in your annual
appropriation bill, besides dealing with the amount of
revenue at your command —supposing certain changes
took place in the constitution —you might deal with
a larger amount than you had at your command, thus
leading up to a further policy, which might be a fair
ground for debate in the upper house. I do not
think that hon. members who represent the smaller
states would for a moment attempt to interfere with
the ordinary appropriation bill of the year —that is
the bill covering the salaries of clerks, and other
necessaries for carrying on the government of the
country. But I say, in spite of the opinion of my
hon. friend at the head of the Government of New
South Wales, from whom I am sorry to differ, that
when we give to the people’s house —first, the power
of originating, which is a great power in itself ; and
secondly, the power of dealing with the ordinary
finances of the year, we put them in a very superior
position, and it seems to me that it would be a very
cumbersome piece of machinery if, whilst the upper
house had the right to reject certain bills, it could
not by any possibility suggest an alteration in a bill.
Suppose a system of taxation were introduced which
would affect all the states connected with the federa-
tion ; suppose any large question were introduced


which involved money matters, surely it might be
fair on the part of the senate to say, “At any rate,
your taxation shall be less,” even if it should not say
that it; should be more, without going through the
indignity of having to veto a bill altogether, or having
it thrown aside in the lower house and then sent
back, causing a certain amount of irritation. Surely
there ought to be some mode of dealing with this
class of money bills outside the ordinary appropria-
tion bill. lam anxious that the discussion now
should refer only to the ordinary appropriations for
the year, leaving it to the finance committee to thrash
out the question whether some machinery could not
be employed to do away with the friction between
the two houses. As far as the argument of the hon.
member, Mr. Deakin, is concerned, that applies to
every bill, and the only way of ending disputes of
that kind is by the exercise of common-sense on the
part of individuals, Ido most earnestly press upon
the hon. gentlemen from Victoria, and also upon my
colleague, Sir Henry Parkes, the necessity of not
drawing too strict an analogy between the position of
the House of Commons in contradiction to the king
and the House of Lords, in its historical episodes,
and the position of a house of representatives or an
assembly in contradistinction to a state senate with the
bicameral principle in a chamber not made up of
nonentities or accidents, but a chamber indirectly
responsible to the people.
Mr. MUNEO : I do not know whether there is
intended to be any compromise on the present
occasion. If there is we had better understand it,
and know where we are. I feel that if there is to be
no compromise there must be a dissolution. There
must be an absolute break up if there is no com-
promise. We received no mandate from our Parlia-
ment to come here with the view of enabling the
minority of the people of the colonies to ride rough-
shod over two-thirds of the population. It is
necessary to go into figures. The colonies of New
South Wales and Victoria contain 2,250,000 of popu-
lation. Leaving out New Zealand, which has about
600.000. the other colonies combined have about
900.000. And the proposal is that Victoria and New
South Wales shall have two votes in regard to the
finances, and that the other colonies shall have four
votes —so that in dealing with finances, 900,000 people
shall have twice the voting power of 2,250,000 people.
An Hon. Member: You are forgetting the
assembly!
Mr. MIJNEO : If the senate has this power to
prevent a bill from becoming law, it is the master of
the situation. It does not matter what power the
assembly has, if it has not the power to carry its will
into law. lam sure that we are acting very liberally
towards the smaller colonies when we say that in the
senate with regard to ordinary legislation, in collec-
tion with which great injury can be done to the
people, the colony of New South Wales, with its
population of 1,120,000, shall be on an equal footing
.with Western Australia, with its population of
45.000. It is an enormous concession. But at the
same time, you say these 45,000 persons shall be at
liberty to join with the 150,000 persons in Tasmania,
and have double the voting power of New South
Wales on the question of taxing the whole people of
these colonies. Such a monstrous proposition as that
was never before submitted to a free people. The
proposition at the present time is that Tasmania and
AVestern Australia, with less than 200,000 people,
shall have double the voting power of New South
Wales, with its population of 1,120,000 persons.
Mr. McMillan : No !
Mr. MUNEO ; That is the proposition.
Sir Henry Parkes : Hear, hear !
Mr. MIJNEO : And if you call it just or equitable,
I call it by another name.
Mr. McMillan: The hon. member forgets the
strength of the lower house !
Mr. MUNEO: It does not matter what the
strength of the lower house is if the upper house has
power to veto it.
Mr. McMillan : They have power to veto it now !
Mr. MUNEO : I did not interrupt the hon. mem-
ber in his speech, and I think we should get on better
if there were not so many interruptions.
Mr. McMillan : I apologise.
Mr. MUNEO : We will take this state of affairs :
supposing a proposal is made by the ministry of the
day, supported by the lower house, containing the
representatives of all the colonies, to raise £8,000,000
by taxation through the customs, and a minority of
the people equal to 900,000 says, “ No ; we shall not
allow you to tax in that direction.” Well, you are com-
pelled to get the money, and, therefore, you must tax
in another direction. What is that but giving them
power to tax the people ? I do not care in what
form you put it, so long as you allow them to amend
in detail you put into their hands power to say what
the taxation of the people shall be ; and the result
will be, as I said before, that the minority of the
people will have power to tax the majority. I, for
one, have received no such authority from the parlia-
ment of which 1 am a member. I have received no
authority to come here and agree that the people of
the larger colonies shall be taxed by the votes of the
smaller colonies, who will pay about only a third of
the amount.
Dr. Cockburn : Not necessarily. Suppose the tax
is on land; you have no land to tax in Victoria,
whereas we have 3,000,000 acres !
Mr. MUNEO : The hon. member need not try to
draw a red herring across the path. The hon. member
knows that we have already passed a resolution which
prevents the federal government from touching the
land.
Hon. Members : No!
Mr. MUN RO : But we have.
Hon. Members : AVhere ?
Mr. MUNEO: Have you among these proposals
any proposal that authorises the federal government
to tax the lands of the colonies ? I say if you pro-
pose any scheme of that sort I, for one, will oppose
it, because I do not believe that the federal govern-
ment ought to have the right to tax the land.
Mr. FitzGerald : They will have full power of
taxation!
Mr. MUNEO : They will not. If the hon. member
has read the Constitution of Canada, he knows that
the Dominion Senate has no such power. The con-
stitution prevents them from having any such power,
and I do not think we ought to give that power. I
think we ought, and I, for one, want to limit the
power of the federal parliament to a certain class of
taxation, and not to allow them to intrude upon the
various colonies and take away their means of taxation.
I do not think that is intended; I do not think it
ought to be done. I am as anxious as any hon.
member to preserve state rights, I want federation
only for purposes which we cannot carry on as well
separately as we can combined. Although I came to
New r South AVales most enthusiastically in favour of
federation, I am not going to sacrifice the interests of
the community even for federation, and if this Con-
vention is not prepared to act fairly and justly to the
whole community then we had better remain as we
are.
Mr. Adyb Douglas : Much better!
Mr. MUNRO : Because if we are to form a consti-
tution which, when it is examined into by the people of
the various colonies, will not be accepted, we may as
well say now we cannot accept it. AVe may as well
at this stage say, “ Oh, you are going to form a con-
stitution which will be unjust to the majority of the
people ; we may as well stop at once and go no
further.” AVe have here an example of what will
happen under the new constitution ; we have here
the representatives of the minor colonies joined


together, with one or two exceptions, against the
representatives of the larger colonies—
Hon. Members : No ]
Mr. MUNRO : That is what is being done.
Mr. Adte Douglas : Look at New South Wales !
Mr. Buboess: Look at Victoria!
Mr. McMillan : Look at the members for your
own colony !
Mr. MIJNRO : Yes; the members of the Legis-
lative Council. I know what that means. We have
experienced already the state of things which you
are asking us to experience again. We are here, as
well as in Victoria, the guardians of the rights of the
people, and we are prepared to stand by them against
every senate or legislative council. If you find the
members of the legislative councils of New South
A\ r ales and Victoria going against the interests of
the community that is not our business. It is our
duty to protect the people. You have here, 1 say,
an instance of what will happen if you give this
power to the senate. You would have the minor
colonies joining together and imposing taxation on the
larger colonies, for government must be carried on ;
and if the ministry of the day cannot get a penny in
one direction, and they are forced to go in another
direction, then the minority rules. That is a thing
to which we cannot consent. lam quite as willing
as any man to assist in taking steps to protect the
smaller colonies, or the less populous colonies, from
any injury being done to them by the majority ; but
at the same time I will not go in the other direction
and allow the smaller colonics to ride roughshod over
the larger colonies. The best thing we can do is not
to pass any resolution now; but to sec how far we
are prepared to meet each other. Wo are quite pre-
pared —and I said so from the commencement— if you
can show us an instance of injustice to the smaller
colonies, to remove that injustice. But when we
come forward and say we are prepared to give the
same representation in the senate for 45,000 persons
as for 1,120,000 persons, surely you cannot charge
us with unfairness. Surely we are acting as liberally
as we can be expected to act. But when you ask us
to allow the smaller colonies to join together and
defeat the larger colonies you are going too far. I
think you ought to halt and consider the situation.
If you are prepared to deal fairly with us we are
enthusiastically in favor of federation ; but we are
not prepared to sacrifice the interests of the com-
munity for the sake of federation.
Sir JOHN BRAY : I think we are all extremely
desirous of doing what is fair to Victoria and New
South Wales, and if the wish to be dealt fairly with
is the only thing which stands in the way of my hon.
friend, Mr. Munro, I am quite sure that we shall be
glad to meet him. But this is too important a ques-
tion to be decided off-hand in this way. I quite
agree with the suggestion that the amendment to
strikeout the words “and amending” having been
carried, the other might fairly be left to the Com-
mittee, who probably will be able in some way to
meet the difficulty ; for there is not the least doubt
that it is a difficulty. On the one hand, we have
those who say that the senate should have power to
amend all bills ; while, on the other hand, we have
those who as strongly contend that it should not have
that power. I would point out that the hon. mem-
ber, Sir Henry Parkes, simply defines in the resolu-
tion the power of the senate in reference to bills
imposing taxation and appropriating revenue. But
the hon. member, Mr. Wrixon, goes a good deal
beyond that, and includes all money bills, and most
of us know that a large number of bills come under
the category of money bills. We may depend upon
it that no form of federation for Australia will be
permanently successful unless it provides for the
rights of the people. I quite agree with the hon.
member, Mr. Munro, that inasmuch as Victoria and
New South Wales contain two-thirds of the popula-
tion of Australia, tlie people of those colonies will
have to pay something like two-thirds of the taxation,
and it only stands to reason, as regards the manner
in which they shall pay it, and the items on which it
shall be paid, that their voice must prevail, and as
population increases in other parts of Australia no
doubt the division will be more equal. But I take
it —speaking from my point of view—that wo do not
want the senate to determine the exact items that
shall be subject to taxation; we do not, at least, I
do not, and I do not think any one seriously wants
the senate to determine the exact amount that
shall be paid to each officer of the federal govern-
ment. But we ask that they shall have the general
right to say that no form of taxation, that no form
of raising revenue detrimental to the interests of
any one or more of the colonies shall be carried.
Although the suggestion I made the other day was
perhaps an imperfect one, yet I believe the Commit-
tee might be able to thrash something out of it. I
do not move it now. But I feel the difficulty of
getting the Convention to agree to many of those
proposals until we have them definitely before us,
and see what effect they will have in connection
with other parts of the constitution that will have at
the same time to be considered. My suggestion is
in these terms:
Provided that no matter shall bo included in any money
hill which the senate shall by resolution declare should, in the
interests of the colonies, or any of them, be dealt with in a
separate measure. And in case the senate shall pass such a
resolution with reference to any matter included in any money
bill such bill shall bo returned with a message to the other
house and such bill shall thereupon be laid aside.
That would be witli a view to ensure the bringing
in of one or more bills to deal with certain subjects
if the senate thought fit. I would ask hon. mem-
bers, however, to postpone their amendments now,
to allow the resolution to pass in its present shape,
giving to the house of representatives alone the
power to originate bills imposing taxation or appro-
priating revenue. I think that after the discussion
that has taken place, the Committee who will be
intrusted with the duty of framing resolutions will
see that it is necessary to provide some middle
course between those who advocate the giving of full
powers to the senate and those who advocate the
giving to them of restricted powers. But I do say
to hon. members who have come here to discharge
an undoubtedly difficult task, that, although we may
ultimately be unable to agree upon important
details, wo ought not to rush too rapidly to the
point when these features meet us. Let us rather
see whether it is not possible, without either side
giving up the entire point in dispute, to take some
middle course that will protect the interests of the
people of their colony or colonies.
Mr. BAKER : I feel as much as does any member
of the Convention the gravity of the situation, and
I venture to suggest that we might do well to con-
sider the course adopted by the Philadelphian Con-
vention when a similar set of circumstances arose.
When in that convention of great men, the mem-
bers came to antagonism on, I think, the very point
we are now considering, and were equally divided,
the whole convention being on the point of breaking
up, the difficulty was met by the appointment of a
committee of compromise, consisting of one delegate
from each state, whose duty it was to bring up some
scheme Avhich would endeavour to reconcile the
antagonisms of the two parties. Would it not be a
good thing for us to take that step now ? Let one
delegate from each colony be appointed to a com-
mittee to consider the matter, and let us see if they
are not able to frame some scheme, or to come to
some agreement or a settlement of the difficulty.
I merely throw out this suggestion. I do not know
whether it will commend itself to the older and
more experienced members of the Convention. I


do not move any amendment, or make any motion
on the subject, but I hope that the suggestion I.
throw out will meet with the approval of the Con-
vention. I would suggest that if any such course
were adopted, it would be well to appoint the
delegates by ballot.
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH : The Premier of
Victoria says that he has a mandate from his con-
stituents, and that he cannot go beyond it.
Mr. MUNRO : No ; I said from the Parliament!
Sir THOMAS McIL WRAITH: Well, from the
Parliament. If that mandate be expressed in the
speech the hon. member delivered to-day, I think
there is a very dismal prospect so far as the federa-
tion of these colonies is concerned; because, if the
hon. member lays down such straight lines, if ho
persists in saying that he will not stand such and
such a thing, and others, perhaps a majority of the
Convention, were to take exactly the same stand, a
compromise would be impossible.
Mr. MUNRO : I offered a compromise !
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITII: A compromise
has been made since the Convention met, because Sir
Henry Parkes, in the propositions he put before us,
took the whole power of initiating and amending
money bills out of the hands of the senate, and put
them exclusively in the hands of the house of repre-
sentatives. The hon. member's colleague mado
a most graceful concession, which I thought would
have concluded the whole matter so far as the repre-
sentatives from New South Wales were concerned,
wdien ho told us distinctly that he believed in taking
away from the senate power of initiating money
bills, and that he would bo perfectly satisfied with
that concession. I myself would be perfectly satis-
fied Avith it. I think it is going about as far as
we can go. But what does the hon. member,
Mr. Munro, ask us to do P We had better not
further postpone the consideration of this question.
Let us understand what we mean. If it be the fact,
perhaps it is better that Ave should know it at once —
that in the present state of feeling throughout the
colonies, as expressed by delegates, federation is im-
possible. Let us know what is meant. The hon.
member, Mr. Munro, has strongly put his point of
view as a Victorian delegate—let me put my point of
view as a representative of one of the smaller colonies.
I was invited to come here by the Premier of Vic-
toria. I was not invited as a representatiA r e of a
small colony AA r hich had only a population of 400,000.
I was invited as one of six delegates to come hero to
meet delegates in the same number from every colony
in the group. If I had*been asked to come doAA r n on
any other terms I should not have come, and I think
no other colony would have responded to the invita-
tion —and Avhy P Because at the present time each
colony has entirely within itself the power of legis-
lation, and if it is to give up that power it must obtain
something in exchange for it. With regard to the
tariff, Mr. Munro coolly proposes that Ave should
hand over the whole consideration of that subject
finally to a majority of the gross population, to a
chamber in which we should be represented, not as a
state, but in proportion to our population. So far
as this matter of tariff is concerned, we are at the
present time in this happy position: that we can
ourselves make a tariff as we like, and unless wo
can see some advantage in federation—federation in-
volving the giving up of that right—we will not come
into the federation at all. That is the position Ave
take up. Having come to this Convention, we feel
that we ought to obtain something in exchange for the
power we are asked to surrender, and we coiild not
be present on any other terms. Now, the hon. mem-
ber, and, in fact, all the Victorian representatives,
have persistently told us only one thing—that feder-
ation is a means to the expansion of the big Victorian
Government. "Just let it expand," say they, "until
it covers the whole of Australia." The idea of Sir
Henry Parkea is pretty much the same, only his
starting point is from Sydney, and the Government
of his colony is also in its turn to cover the whole of
the continent. We do not want that. We do not
want to come in on the basis of population. We in
Queensland have definite views of our destiny as a
nation —as a part of a federation —not independently
of it. I do not believe with one hon. gentleman that
wo should not take pride in our different colonies.
I think wo should all consider our interests as Aus-
tralians. But in spite of all that is said, I take pride
in being a Queenslander, and I shall endeavour per-
sistently to forward her interests so long as I am
identified with the country: When I sec that her
interests are about to bo sacrificed, and to be put
under the heel of the Victorian,big majority, I shall
decline to come into a federation.
Mr. Mukro : So will we !
Sir John Brat: Let us see whether there is not
some middle course!
Sir THOMAS McILWEAITH: The middle course
of the hon. member is, I believe, to postpone the
question to the popular majority. I do not believe
in postponing it to the popular majority at all.
What I have advocated has been the equal power of
the two houses, because both of them represent the
whole population, and each ought equally to be con-
sidered. The question had not arisen from the point
of view now mentioned by the Victorian delegates.
It has never come before us in the way in which it
comes before us now. Those who brought the matter
before us in our invitation to come here requested
that we should meet together upon some common
ground upon which each state should rank as a unit.
Wo have met them on those terms, and are perfectly
prepared to carry out those terms. But we must insist
upon our right to an equal representation on the
ground on which we came in, namely, that we should
have exactly the same power as the great colony of
Victoria, and that, as part of the whole nation, wo
should have equal representation in the upper cham-
ber. It is useless to bring in the population argu-
ment, and say that because Victoria has a population
of 1,100,000 as against Queensland with a population
of 4-00,000 or 500,000, therefore Victoria should have
larger representation in the senate. That would be
all very well if you carried out the idea of a big
national government that would spread out from
Victoria and cover the whole land. But that is not
what we are going to have, and the point is conceded
by those who brought us together by the fact that
they allow equal powers to the senate in everything
except money bills. Why is this ? There are a
great many matters of considerable importance be-
sides money bills in regard to which the power of
the senate ought to be circumscribed if it is logical
to circumscribe their power in relation to money
bills. Why are these other powers given when the
power to deal with money bills is denied? What
are the reasons advanced ? Every reason given has
been one that has applied to the peculiar relationship
of the lower house and the upper chamber in the
different colonies ; but not one of those reasons has
been applicable to the relationship of the house of
representatives and the senate, which we propose to
create. In the latter case both houses represent the
people and ought therefore to be equally considered.
The Premier of Victoria strongly enforced the
doctrine, which had the acquiescence of all the
Victorian members and everybody else, that the
majority must rule. That is a proposition which as
applied to the present case I do not think the dele-
gates will concede. We say, not a majority of the
people, but a majority of the people and a majority
of the states. We cannot accept the hon. gentleman’s
definition of popular government in that sense. And
I must insist upon his trying to regard the senate,
not simply as representing the "wealth and property
of the colonies, but as representing the population of


the colonies. I do not like the suggestion made by
the hon. member, Sir John Bray. I believe that
what we refuse in the strongest way to concede here,
we shall very likely be obliged to agree to in con-
sequence of an agitation which will be carried on
until the senate is deprived of the rights now asked
for. The only compromise we ought to make —and
I do not see the use of federation at all unless it is
on something like that basis —is to give to the house
of representatives the power to initiate money bills.
There is one view of the question we ought to con-
sider. Ido not think from what I have read in the
newspapers —and I have been accustomed to read the
Victorian newspapers for a long time —that the
Premier of that colony speaks the will of the people
of Victoria.
Hon. Membehs : Oh, yes !
Sir THOMAS McILWKAITH: He speaks the
will of the majority who have not thought much
about the subject; but even these when they com-
mence to see how their interests are affected, will
turn round and rend the hon. member. They will
not understand the case at all from his point of view.
I believe the hon. member could make such a speech
as he has made and be applauded right throughout;
but when the people of Victoria begin to realise that
the carrying out of those ideas will have the effect of
blocking Victoria from further intercourse with New
South Wales and Queensland, they will not allow
the hon. member to be Premier many months longer.
I would caution hon. members to remember that we
have a work before us perhaps more difficult still
than that on which we are now engaged. It is a
very difficult thing to effect a compromise. I have a
notion to-day that very likely we ma} r come to a com-
promise. But the most difficult task before us will
be to get our constituents to agree to the constitution
we may frame. Ido not disguise from myself the
fact that most of us —and 1 include myself in the
number—do not agree with the majority of our con-
stituents on this point. I believe that on the point
I have insisted upon my constituents —I speak of
course of Queensland —go a great deal further than
I do myself, and that even the compromise to which
I have yielded will not be accepted without a great
deal of work on the part of those who are interested
in seeing federation brought about. I believe that
the delegates generally are ahead of the constituents,
and I am quite sure that the outside colonies will
look with great suspicion on any proposal that is
made. We are taunted sometimes with having
suspicion of one another’s motives. Suspicion is not
a bad element in an affair of this sort. It is an ugly
word to use, but perhaps it is the proper word after
all. We have to regard the interests of the colonies
we are here to represent. We are bound to do that
and, call it suspicion or anything else, in looking at
those iuterests we may of course bo considerably
biassed. What I wish to draw attention to is this :
We ought to try to frame something that will be
accepted by the different constituencies that we re-
present. I claim to understand Victoria a great deal
better than the Premier of Victoria can possibly
understand Queensland, and I am much astonished
at the attitude which has been taken up by the
Victorian delegates. The immediate advantages to
Victoria and New South Wales are so plain to every-
body that I cannot understand why a dead legal
technicality, only kept alive by the strong fights
which take place between the lower and upper houses
in Victoria, should have been introduced as one of
their principal arguments. I believe myself that
they will give way; but when the constituents un-
derstand that it is only a fight as to the constitution
of the upper and lower houses, as to whether their
manufactures shall spread over the whole of Australia,
they will demand a different mandate from that
which the hon. [member, Mr. Munro, gave us just
now.
Colonel SMITH : I should have been very glad if
the hon. gentleman who has just resumed his seat
had answered one point which was made by my hon.
colleague, Mr. Munro. That hon. member pointed
out that New South Wales and Victoria, with two-
thirds of the population of Australia, are offering
to the other four colonies the same representation in
the senate that they claim themselves ; in other words,
if there are nine representatives from each colony,
New South Wales and Victoria, with two-thirds of
the population, will have eighteen members, and
the other colonies combined, with one-third of the
population, will have thirty-six members. The
doctrine has been laid down by the hon. member, Sir
John Downer, and those who support his view, that
in the senate which is to be placed over the house of
representatives the thirty-six members shall govern
the eighteen who represent two-thirds of the popu-
lation of the whole group. If that is to be so ; if
this body is to be created, having greater power than
was ever exercised by an upper house in any indivi-
dual colony ; if its hands are to be strengthened, and
deadlocks made inevitable, I shall be very much sur-
prised. The hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, did
not explain to the Convention the difficulty he
recently had with the Legislative Council in Queens-
land ; and the hon. member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith,
also failed to give any information on the subject.
How do he and his colleagues propose to get over
difficulties of that description, if there should be a
deadlock between the senate and the house of repre-
sentatives ? The house of representatives, represent-
ing the bulk of the people, might, by an overwhelm-
ing majority, pass a certain measure. This powerful
senate, however, might say, " We shall Aot pass this
measure, no matter how large the majority in favour
of it may be. We shall overrule you." lam not
prepared, and I am certain the colony of Victoria is
not prepared, to strengthen the hands of the senate
and make it more powerful than the Legislative
Council of that colony is at present. Rather than
do that it would be better for us to pack up and go
away to-morrow. It is perfectly useless for this
Convention to go on unless some fair and reasonable
concession is made with respect to this subject ; for
instance, that a measure should be assented to by the
senate if passed by a majority of two-thirds of the
house of representatives. The Legislative Council
of Victoria now represents a very large constituency
—130,000. The lower house represents 200,000.
Even now we have conflicts between the houses. Yet
we are coolly asked to-day to strengthen the hands of
the senate, so that it can defy the decision of the
people and reject a measure, no matter whether it be
a money bill or any other bill.
Mit. FITZGEBALD : No one denies thele gislative
councils that power!
Colonel SMITH : The hon. member knows what
took place in Victoria, and I will not be a party to
creating a more powerful body in the federal parlia-
ment than the Legislative Council is in Victoria. If
this proposal be carried, New South Wales and Vic-
toria will have to endeavour to reduce the represen-
tation of the smaller colonies in the senate. Other-
wise they can overwhelm us and do as they please. If
we propose a tax which they do not like they may
say, "We shall not have that tax" ; and we shall
have created a body which will really be an oligarchy,
independent of the wishes of the people. You will
create a,body more powerful than the representatives
of the people in the lower house. I was astounded
to find the hon member, Dr. Cockburn, supporting
this proposal. If we could be certain that the senate
would act as the Legislative Council of South Aus-
tralia acted when a difficulty recently occurred there
—that is, meet in committee with the lower house
and settle the difficulty—it might be all right. We
have no guarantee whatever that such a thing would
be done. If the smaller colonies, to whom we give


twice our representation in the senate, want to overrule
the representatives in the lower house, so far as Vic-
toria is concerned it will prefer to run alone. It will
he wise for New South Wales to run alone. The
speech delivered to-day by the hon. member, Sir
Henry Parkes, completely covered the ground, and I
■was astonished when his Colonial Treasurer, the
hon. member, Mr. McMillan, got up and differed with
him on that point. We might as well dissolve at
once, and go back to our homes, if we are going to
decide that we shall create a body to over-ride the
representatives of the people. The hon. member,
Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, was good enough to say
that he knew the colony of Victoria better than
its Premier did.
Sir Thomas Mcllweaith : No. What I said
was that I knew the colony of Victoria better than
the hon. member, Mr. Munro, knew Queensland.
Colonel SMITH : I believe that is the case, and
that the hon. member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, was
originally a Victorian. I find that the hon. member
is not the only member of the Convention who
represents another colony, but who began his career
in Victoria. I am very sorry, however, to say that
when hon. members leave Victoria their sympathies
do not always remain there. I can assure the hon.
member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, that the people of
Victoria are thoroughly conversant with everything
that takes place within these walls, and they are
just as capable of forming a sound judgment on any
public question as most hon. members are. I am
certain that I am expressing the sound convictions
and honest sentiments of the people of Victoria,
when I say they will not submit to having the senate
made so strong that it can overrule the popular
chamber, or to make the senate stronger than are the
legislative councils in the various colonies. If this
resolution be carried in its present form, without
any modification providing that the people, as
represented in the lower chamber, should ultimately
prevail after reasonable delay, our labours will be
perfectly useless. Seeing that the smaller colonies
are to have an equal representation in the senate
with that of the large colonies, it is not fair, just, or
equitable to expect that the great colony of New
South Wales, or that the smaller colony of Victoria,
with its large population, will assent to the proposal
now before the Convention. I ask the representatives
of the smaller colonies in common fairness that
they will agree to some proposal giving a guarantee
that the will of the people shall ultimately prevail.
There is no such power given here. The hon. mem-
ber who has made this proposal has shown us no
way out of the difficulty which I refer to. If this
proposal be carried, there will possibly be a deadlock
between the two houses. But the hon. member who
has moved this amendment has shown us no way out
of such a difficulty. I feel surprised at the attitude
taken up by gentlemen who hold leading positions in
the different colonies, who know the difficulties which
have arisen from time to time between the various
legislative assemblies and legislative councils. lam
not surprised that members of the Convention who
are representatives of upper houses, should advocate
this proposal. They have always advocated it, and
probably always will advocate it. How often has it
taken place in Victoria, that the members of the
Council have sent the lower house to the country to
be punished, for no fault of their own ! Time after
time have the Council had the lower house dissolved,
and they have come back by the Amice of the people
at the ballot-box in overwhelming numbers, and
then, because they cannot be punished, the hon.
gentlemen in the upper house have thrown the
measure out again. If the hon. gentleman had said,
“ Dissolve the upper house if it rejects a measure a
second time,” the case would have been different.
Mr. Gordon : But the decision would not be altered.
The same state representatives would come back!
Colonel SMITH : In Victoria these hon. gentlemen
would not come back, because we have not a nominee
house there. It is an elective house. If the upper
house are put in a position in which they can
be punished, if they can be sent to their con-
stituents in the various colonies, and if the
body is given a liberal character, I venture
to say that they will hesitate a long time
before they will throw out a popular measure. It
will be a long time before they will submit them-
selves to punishment by throwing out a measure that
has the sympathies and the approval of the entire
body of the people. They will rather meet the
popular will, accept it, and make the best of it. I
regret very much the indisposition shown by the
smaller colonies to meet us in a magnanimous way,
when we offer them equal representation with us, so
that they can outvote us in the senate. They could
do so if they were only in a bare majority; but we
give them a majority of two-thirds. It comes with
not altogether' a good grace from hon. members
representing those colonies to stand up here and to
propose to give to the body with whom we propose
to deal so liberally the power to veto the unanimous
voice, it may be, of the -whole of New South "Wales
and Victoria. That is the power proposed to bo
conferred, and I am very glad the proposal did not
come from either of the larger colonies. I came to
this Convention, as did my hon. colleagues, with a
thorough determination to bring about federation if
it were possible, to do so on anything like fair terms;
and the resolution which the hon. member, Sir
Henry Parkes, proposed in the conference at Mel-
bourne, asking us to federate in a way that would be
just to each and all of the colonies, carried out the
views of all. But I say that this is a proposition
that is not just or equitable. It gives to a section
what ought to belong to the whole ; it gives to one
part of the population —no doubt the wealthier part
—the power of vetoing the decision of the represen-
tatives of the people in the lower assembly, and I
must say that 1 am intensely surprised to find hon.
members who are members of lower chambers in the
various legislatures advocating anything of this,
description ; it surprises me above all things that the
hon. member, Dr. Cockburn, should come here and
propose an extremely conservative measure of this
kind. I thought he was a man of a different
character —that his instincts were liberal, and, in
fact, almost democratic and socialistic. But the
hon. gentleman is now backing up the most intense
conservatism that could possibly be conceived and
proposed in this chamber.
Dr. COCKBURN : It is quite the other way !
Colonel SMITH : I know that the hon. gentleman
thinks so ; but I am satisfied that if he had gone
through the conflicts which I have witnessed, and
taken part in, in Victoria, he would not talk as he
has done. I hope hon. members will meet over this
point. lam sure that the hon. member, Sir John
Downer, does not mean his amendment to be so
extreme as it is, and I think he will be prepared, and
I hope the hon. delegates from Queensland will also
be prepared, to endeavour to meet this difficulty as
it ought to be met, so that the will of the people,
after it has been properly ascertained at the ballot-
box, and from their representatives in the lower
chamber, may prevail.
Mr. AD YE DOUGLAS: As a delegate from one
of the smaller colonies which have been referred to,
I am astonished at the arguments used by the hon.
member from Victoria. We never knew Victorian
delegates, either here or elsewhere, to enter into any
arrangement that did not suit their own particular
purpose, and their own particular pockets, and upon
the present occasion their conduct is the same as
that which they have pursued heretofore. What
does the hon. member, Colonel Smith, mean by
making a comparison between tho legislatures of


the several colonies, and the proposed legislature
which this Convention is trying to bring about ?
"When any proposal in the slightest degree ob-
jectionable is made to the hou. delegates from
Victoria, they turn round with an extra-
ordinary amount of effervescence, and tell ns that if
we do not come round to their views and ideas they
will give up the thing altogether.
Mr. Mimno: The hon. member said the same
thing!
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS: We say that we are
anxious to come to some arrangement, if possible.
Colonel Smith : If the hon. member and his friends
get what they want!
Mr. AD YE DOUGLAS: It would be very easy
to meet the opposition that is being created here with
regard to the senate by carrying out the rules that
are carried out in America when a deadlock arises.
Hon. members say that the federated colonies are to
have no power in the senate. But will they have any
power in the house of representatives P They will be
deprived of all power, because a colony like Western
Australia would, in all probability, have only about
two votes to fifty or sixty in the house of represen-
tatives.
Mr. Munro : That has not been settled!
Mr. Wrtxon; The contrary has been said!
Mr. AD YE DOUGLAS; I say that in the house
of representatives they -will have no power.
Mr. Wrixon: Yes, every power!
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS: They must have power
somewhere, and the only place where they can have
it is in the senate. Why do you have an equal num-
ber of representatives from each colony in the senate
if it is not simply to balance the overwhelming
power of the large and unequal representation in the
house of representatives ? But why do you call that
body the house of representatives ? The word is inex-
plicable and inappropriate. The senate is just as
representative as the house of representatives, or
whatever you choose to term the popular house.
Hon. members are talking of the people. They are
afraid to do anything that does not concur with the
•will of the mob. That is the principle hon. members
adopt. They are afraid to go and speak their real
opinions if they do not suit the mob.
Mr. Mfrtmo : We have no mob in Victoria!
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS ; I have known Victoria
longer than the hon. member. I was there before
they had representative institutions at all, and when
the hon. member comes to talk hero he must not
think that he is going to win us over by his blarney.
The hon member thinks that the vox populi is the vox
Dei.
Colonel Smith : So it is !
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS: No doubt it is in Bal-
larat.
Colonel Smith : It is in Tasmania, too !
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS : We have representa-
tives in Tasmania who care very little about what is
termed popular opinion. Are the several colonies to
have no power at all in the senate, or whatever you
may choose to call that body ? Each member will
represent the whole of his colony, not a mere section
of the people, while in the lower assembly the smaller
colonies will only be represented by a few people.
There must, in order to create a union of the colonies,
be a counter-balance somewhere. Otherwise, why
not limit the senate to representatives in proportion
to population? You are only creating one thing to
smash it down with another; and you are saying,
“ You may appear there ; but we will clip your wings
and give you no power in any shape or form, except-
ing that which the larger colonies will allow.” It
will be much better for us to know exactly the posi-
tion in which we stand. The position taken up by the
hon. member, Bir John Downer, is only one link, as it
were, of the chain. It can easily be met by providing
that if a bill is carried by a certain majority in the house
of representatives, and also by a certain majority in
the other house, it should become law without further
delay. To say, however, that the colonies repre-
sented in the senate are to have no power to deal
with, say, a bill to construct a railway—because when
you use the phrase money bills, I take it that bills
providing for the expenditure of money on railways
and other works are included —will bo to create a
despotic government. There can be no doubt that
the difficulty is one which can be easily met, and
there is no occasion for the display of all this violence
on the part of Victoria. One hon. member has even
said that they xvill not join the federation —that they
will pack up and go away without trying to come to
some arrangement. I am astonished that gentlemen
representing a colony like Victoria should talk in
this manner, that they should not appeal to the
reason, but to the fears and cowardice, of those who
represent the smaller colonies. We know very well
what Victoria is ; we know very well what faith we
can place in her Government; we know what faith
we can place in her people. They have got tho start,
and they have been so long in getting it that they
want to stick to it. We shall be very careful, I hope,
not to allow one colony, because it has a large
population, to take advantage of another colony which
has not so large a population. We know the diffi-
culties attached to what is termed " responsible
government." Those difficulties can be easily met
without this noise and bustle. Federation can be
carried out if we are determined to carry it out, if we
are each inclined to yield to a certain extent; but we
must not be browbeaten by representatives from
Victoria saying they are not going to have anything
to do with it unless their particular views are carried
into effect. If we are moderate in our views,
federation can be carried out. It is said that we are
to adopt the English Constitution. Why ? Because
it seems to me to meet the views of the people of
Victoria. It is not, however, at all applicable to us.
We cannot imitate the House of Commons. That is
a term which cannot be applied to us; there is only
one House of Commons proper. In New Zealand
they term the members of the lower house " repre-
sentatives," because the members of their upper
house are nominees ; but in South Australia the
upper house, or Legislative Council, is elective.
Therefore, the word " representatives " is not applic-
able to what may be termed the house of the people.
Tho senate will represent the people just as much as
the other house, and the senate must have some
counter-balancing influence against the power of the
large colonies in the house of representatives. I
trust we shall be able to carry out some scheme of
federation, at any rate to submit some scheme to the
various colonies, knowing that it rests with those
colonies afterwards to accede or not to what may be
placed before them. We are only asked to draw up
a scheme of federation, and I have no doubt that it
will be drawn up in some shape or other, especially
in view of the fact that we have gentlemen present
who have been in the habit of expressing their views
and opinions on constitutional government. I feel
sure that we can safely place the formation federa-
tion of Australia in their hands, without necessarily
adopting any particular constitution now in existence.
We cannot follow the Dominion of Canada ; we can-
not follow the United States; we cannot follow the
Constitution of England, because it is a continually
changing one, and it is necessary that the gentlemen
composing this Convention should in some way or
other devise a plan which w r ould be applicable as far
as possible to the interests of the people of Aus-
tralia. >
Mr. THYNN E: We havchadsome warm discussion
this afternoon amongst various representatives ; and.
it seems to me that we might now, after the heated
debate which has taken place, advantageously hark
back a little, and cast about see whether we are


really protecting the interests that we have been sent
here to protect. We arc present as representatives
ot various parliaments, and I may be permitted in all
humility to suggest that it is our duty to preserve
as far as possible, not only the functions, but the
interests of those parliaments, except in regard to
those matters which we must give up to a federal
government. If we look across the w r ater to the
United States of America, we find a very rigid constitu-
tion as originally framed, and w'e find the position of
the states and the states legislatures very strongly
guarded according to the written Constitution ; and
yet we find that even that rigid protection which they
have received has not been sufficient to protect those
states in the complete exercise, not merely of their
functions, but of their influence on the bodies attached
to them. In the states we have found, first of all,
some of the powers taken away by judicial decisions,
and vested in the federal government on the one side.
We have found them taken away under stress of
exceptional circumstances statutes passed and
adopted limiting the powers of the states ; and now
we find, on the other side, that the influence of the
states is being gradually diminished and taken away
by the growing influence and powers of the local
bodies —by what we may call the municipal govern-
ment, until at the present time the position of the
states is far different to what it was originally
intended to be. If that is the case in a constitution
like that of the United States of America, where
there is a popular representative house, and where
there is also a senate having all the powers
which extreme advocates of a senate here have
advocated—of amendment of money bills—if, with
these precautions, we see the state influence decaying,
what can we expect hero ? If we constitute a house
of representatives with great power, and reduce the
protecting power which is given to the states through
their representatives in the senate, the effect will be
that in the course of a few years even the Parliament
of Victoria and the Parliament of New South Wales
will be shorn and stripped of their power and
influence ; and instead of having the representatives
direct from the people, enabling them to legislate
effectively for their own affairs, they wall be sent
from their state parliaments for the most important
matters to the unified parliament, which would
undoubtedly grow from the great power which the
hon. member, Mr. Munro, and other hon. members
from Victoria, advocate giving to the house qf repre-
sentatives, Ido not like quotations very much, but
I will give a few lines from a recent publication upon
the relative position of the state governments in
America and the federal governments, and I do so
because I think the words are words of warning which
hon. gentlemen here ought to bear in mind in relation
to their functions as to their individual parlia-
ments :
The commonwealth government is now but a sort of middle
instance. Too large for local government, too small for
general, it is beginning to be regarded as a meddlesome
intruder in both spheres—the tool of the strongest interest,
the oppressor of the individual. This has been its history in
other lands and other times, and the mere fact that itprofesses
to be popular here, whilst it has been princely and 'aristo-
cratic elsewhere, will not save it from the same fate.
I ask the hon. gentleman, the Premier of Victoria, is
that the condition to which he wishes the Parliament
of Victoria to descend ? Does he wish to promote
the stripping of the Parliament of Victoria of its
power and influence over its own people ? I ask the
hon. members for New South Wales, do they wish to
see the Parliament of New South Wales in the
same way stripped of its power and influence, and
relegated to the position which is merely accorded
under the present system to local municipalities ? I
think that this is a very important matter, and one to
which I trust I am not out of place in calling the
attention of the Convention.
Mr. KINGSTON: I think wo must all recognise
that we are approaching a very critical stage in our
deliberations, and that we have arrived at a time
when it behoves us to act with the utmost circum-
spection, lest our efforts in the direction of federation
should prove a failure ; and I trust that nothing that
I may feel it my duty to say will even in a slight
degree tend to dissipate that atmosphere of com-
promise to which reference has been made by one
hon. delegate, and which at the present moment does
not appear to lead to any very practical result. I have
listened with a very great amount of attention to the
arguments which have fallen from the various hon.
delegates from Victoria, and it appears to me that
those arguments, if pushed to their legitimate con-
clusion, amount to this : that wB have made a very
great mistake in providing in the resolutions which
we have carried for a bicameral system —for a system
consisting of two houses, one representative of the
people and the other of the states —and that we
should rather adopt a single chamber constitution, in
which the people only will be represented, and the
will of the majority will rule.
Colonel Smith : None of us have said that!
Mr. KINGSTON: None of the hon. delegates
from Victoria said it in so many words ; hut it seemed
to me, listening with the greatest attention to their
utterances, that that was the logical result of the
arguments which they advanced. I remember par-
ticulaidy the utterances of the hon. member for
Victoria, Mr. Wrixon, who is now, in common with
other members who think similarly with him, striving
to limit the powers of the senate on the subject of
finance, whilst he tells us at the same time that finance
is government and government is finance. I have
come hero with every desire to assist in bringing
about a fair and reasonable scheme of federation;
but I thought that the idea that underlay the federal
scheme likely to be proposed was that though of
course wo were only to confer on the federal govern-
ment the power of dealing with national questions,
still, as regards national questions, it was not to be
simply that the will of the majority of the people
should prevail, but that in order that there should bo
federal legislation on any particular subject, there
should be a concensus of opinion in two chambers—
a majority of the people and a majority of the states.
I venture to think that it is a principle which \yill
commend itself to most of us; and, speaking par-
ticularly of the colony which I with others have the
honor to represent, I know that in South Australia
there is a pretty general feeling that whilst walling
to join in a scheme of federation conceding duo
weight in the shape of extra representation to extra
population, we are not prepared altogether to sink
our state individuality, but we think that there should
be two chambers one in which the claims of
extra population to extra representation wall be fully
recognised, and the other in which each state will be
regarded as an individual unit entitled to equal repre-
sentation. I go further; and I put the matter in
this form: that the system to be effective must con-
cede to the senate practically co-ordinate powers with
the more popular branch of the legislature. What is
the good of erecting a senate in which the states are
equally represented if you are not going to give them
any powers worthy of the name ? What is the good
of giving equal representation to different states in a
body which, according to the utterances I have
already quoted, will have practically no power at all
in matters of finance—in matters which are really
the essence of the government of the whole of
Australia!
Mr. Deakus* .- Powder of rejection, but not poyver
of amendment!
Mr. KINGSTON: Power of rejection is some
power, no doubt. Is the extra representation which
is conceded to extra population in the low r er chamber
no advantage ?Is it not a sufficient advantage in


favour of the populous states ? Is the power ot
initiation of no importance whatever?
Mr. Baker : I thought it was enormous !
Mr. KINGSTON : Does it not go to the whole
gist of the matter as regards the origination of the
more important measures ? Confining the powers
of the senate simply to rejection is all I am con-
tending for —rejection in detail. It seems to me that
if we are going to have a senate which, wdiilst
nominally created for the protection of state rights,
is really and practically shorn of all pow r ers in that
direction, we should be dealing more fairly with the
states themselves if we were to say: “We require
that the majorities of the people should rule —that
there should be practically one chamber—and we do
not propose to have a senate at all.” I wmuld infi-
nitely prefer, in order that it may be fairly appre-
ciated by those wdiose duty eventually it will be to
judge of the advisability of this scheme, that we
should go back and propose to them one chamber
rather than be charged with the duty of recommend-
ing to them the adoption of a system which, wdiilst
calling into existence a senate charged nominally
with the protection and preservation of state rights,
has no real power or influence in that direction, but
is simply a sham, a delusion, and a snare. I hold
strong view r s on the question of the propriety of
giving the senate the power of rejecting money bills
in detail; but at the same time I recognise that
there is a very strong difference of opinion on the
question, and that we should strain every effort for
the purpose of arriving at some compromise agree-
able to all; and Ido trust that in this matter—a
matter of the most vital importance—we shall con-
tinue the practice w r e have successfully adopted
hitherto, of avoiding all divisions—of avoiding the
necessity of taking the sense of the majority of the
Convention on the subject. lam satisfied also that
there is such a desire to come to a compromise that
w r e shall be able to do something in that dii’ection.
As laid down in the resolutions carried by the
Melbourne Conference, and since repeated in our
instructions by our various legislatures, w r e are
charged with the duty of arriving at a conclusion
just and fair to the several states, and I am sure
that w r e are all here actuated by the one desire. Of
course, it is difficult to say what is fair and right
under the circumstances. A t the same time, I am
very much impressed ■with the mode in which the
matter is sought to be dealt with by the amendment
indicated by the hon. member for South Australia,
Sir John Bray. The senate is created for the pur-
pose of protecting state rights. Refuse, if you like,
to the senate the power of amending money bills
generally ; but when state rights are involved, and
matters dealing with them are mixed up with others
in money bills, let the senate have the right by
resolution to require that the matter shall be dealt
with in a separate bill. And if it is so dealt wdth the
simple result will be that the senate by the rejection
of that particular measure will accomplish all that is
sought it should have the pow r er to accomplish by
giving it the right of veto in detail. lam satisfied
that whatever may be the strength of our opinions
on the subject we shall do all that w r e can to come to
a fair arrangement. Undoubtedly it would reflect
the highest discredit on all of us should w r e spare any
pains to come to an amicable understanding on the
matter, and I cannot contemplate the possibility of
such a disastrous result.
Captain BUSSELL : If we are anxious for a com-
promise, it is a great pity that we did not adopt the
suggestion made by an hon. member, to adjourn an
hour ago, because we find in everyday life that when
the atmosphere is sultry it is an advantage to change
our locality, and get the fresher breeze. There has
been a great deal of warmth imported into the debate
this afternoon, more particularly by the Premier of
Victoria —more warmth than light. I confess that
at the end of that hon. gentleman’s speech I had
found out much that he would not do, much that
should not he done, and that he was inclined to pack
up his portmanteau unless his particular wish was
given effect to. But that is not compromise. We
are advanced no further by it. We do not know
what Victoria wants, except that her whole wish
should be conceded. I think it would have been a
good thing if we had adjourned. But whilst I am on
my feet, I will say a few words on the subject
Here I would allude to the impression which was
made upon me by Colonel Smith when he spoke of
the magnanimity with which the senate was to be
treated, inasmuch as the smaller colonies were to be
given equal representation therein. But the hon,
member did not carry his magnanimity much further.
It was to have the nominal power of two votes, but
it was not to exercise them. The hon. member’s
magnanimity stopped there.
Colonel Smith : Not on money bills!
Captain BUSSELL: I think that the Convention
is rather setting up a wooden image—an image in
which there is really nothing. There is ample room
for compromise, and when we go carefully into the
matter we shall find that we shall apparently give up
a great deal, while in reality, we sacrifice nothing at
all. What is this great power of amending money
bills ? I venture to say that, by giving the senate
power to amend money bills, we should take power
away from it. That may seem paradoxical; but I
believe it is the case. In former days, no doubt,
there was a great deal in the power of vetoing money
bills. It originated in the old days, when the Crown
was the sole power, and when the Crown and the
House of Lords really taxed the people and spent
the money as they choose. All that has passed away.
It is the people now who say how the taxes are to be
raised, and how they are to be expended. They put
governments in, and turn them out, on questions of
finance with the utmost ruthlessness, and there is no
danger that any power you give to the senate will
affect the financial policy of the federation. I said
just now that though it may seem paradoxical, I
believe that to give the senate power to amend
money bills would be in reality to take power from
it, because the general opinion apparently of the
Convention has been that the senate shall have a
perpetual existence and a right of veto. It you give
the senate the right of perpetual existence and the
veto, you will be giving to it absolutely autocratic
power which it would not put into force. If you
give it the power of amending money bills, because
its existence is perpetual, and its power of saying
“ no ” also perpetual, you place in the hands of a
comparatively irresponsible body, a much greater
power than that of amending a bill. I do not think
there is any reason why an amendment similar to
this proposed by Mr. Wrixon should not be given
effect to. To me it seems a matter of little conse-
quence whether the senate has the power to originate
money bills or not, or whether it has the power of
amending them. I maintain that the question of the
financial policy is not now what it used to be, that
the people themselves are more interested in social
questions than formerly, that the whole legisla-
tion of the next ten or twenty years will be,
not upon £ s. d., but on the social rights of
the people. It will be a general social legislation.
These are questions that the people are properly
jealous of; these are questions which they will watch
with the greatest interest, and the power of expendi-
ture is as nothing in their eyes compared with the
labour and other social problems which will have to
come before the parliaments of the various colonies.
Therefore, on that point I maintain that the amend-
ment of money bills is a matter of comparatively
little moment. But are we sincerely anxious for
federation ? Do we want to bring about the unifica-
tion of Australia ? Do we wish to bring the detached


colonies of Australia into a federation ? Believe me
that unless you leave absolutely autonomous powers
to those outlying districts, and allow them to believe
that their representatives in the senate will be real
entities and not nonentities, it is hopeless to talk on
the subject. It has been said that the delegates are
far ahead of their constituents in their knowledge of
the subject, and their desire for federation, and I say
that unless you give to the delegates such a position
that they can go back and show to their colonies that
they will not surrender any autonomous powers —
unless you can show to them that there will be a dis-
tinct gain by joining the federation —unless you can
show them that the state representatives will not be
mere nonentities —it is hopeless to talk any more on
the subject. I believe there is as strong a desire
throughout the Convention as there will be through-
out Australia that there shall be a federation of the
colonies. But it will commence by the adoption of
the spirit of compromise, not by our trying to insist
that we shall have everything we desire for ourselves;
but by sitting down with a resolute determination
that we will not leave Sydney until we have brought
about federation. If w 7 e once set to work in that
spirit, with the hope and belief that genuine work
will be done, we shall have accomplished a great deal.
It cannot be done by lengthened sittings, and heated
debate, but only by calmly discussing amongst our-
selves, perhaps outside, the points on which we can
compromise.
Mr. EUTLEDGrE : If I were inclined to take a
pessimist view of things, after the debate which has
taken place this evening, I should be disposed to
think that federation had received a serious blow.
After the speeches of Mr, Munro and Colonel Smith,
it seems as if w T e should accomplish nothing at all.
We must approach the consideration of the great
question that is engaging our attention in a different
spirit from that in which it has been dealt with by
those two gentlemen. Ido not think it is the way for
hon. members who have strong convictions to endea-
vour to secure the adoption of their views, and effect
anything like concessions from those who with equally
strong convictions, hold different views, by saying,
“ I am prepared to take this stand, and I shall not
budge an inch from the ground which I now occupy.”
Mr. Munro : Who said that ?
Mr. EUTLEDGrE; The hon. member did not say
so in so many words, but unless I misunderstood him
very greatly,' that was the effect of what he said.
Mr. Munro : Oh, no !
Mr. EUTLEDGrE: Unless the hon. member had
his views given effect to in regard to the rights of the
popular branch of the legislature, he was prepared to
pack up his traps and go back to Victoria to-morrow.
Mr. Munro ; I said nothing of the sort!
Mr, EUTLEDGrE: Ido not think we ought to
approach the discussion in a spirit of that kind. We
are here, as the President admirably stated in the
course of the speech in which he moved the resolu-
tions, to endeavour to give and take. I certainly
cannot understand how any hon. gentleman can
expect the Convention to arrive at any definite con-
clusion at all unless we are prepared to give as well
as to take.
Colonel Smith : We are to give everything and
get nothing !
Mr, EUTLEDGrE: It is unfortunate that hon.
gentlemen should endeavour to pit the house of
representatives against the senate, and to suppose
that there will necessarily be a spixfit of antagonism
existing betiveen the two bodies. I do not think
there is any likelihood of a spirit of antagonism
existing between those two bodies as such. They
will not be two bodies animated by a spirit similar to
that which now animates the two branches of the
provincial legislatures. That was pointed out at very
great length by the various speakers who discussed
the question in open Convention the other day ;
therefore, I need not refer to the subject again. But
there is all the difference in the world, as was pointed
out, between the constitution of the senate, as we
hope to frame it, and the constitution of the upper
house to which we are accustomed in the several
colonies. Why should there be any antagonism
between those two bodies ? The hon. gentleman
seemed to assume, and it strikes me as being very
fallacious to assume anything of the kind, that on
any great question which comes before the federal
parliament there will necessarily be a ranging up of
all the smaller colonies on the one side. Why should
that be so ? Many questions may come before the
senate for consideration which may have the greatest
possible interest for, say, Tasmania, and which the
representatives of that colony may like to veto ; but
in which they will not have the sympathy of Queens-
land or the sympathy of Western Australia; and,
therefore, it strikes me as being wrong altogether to
assume that on every great financial question that
comes before the senate all the small colonies will
necessarily go together like a flock of sheep, and all
their representatives will vote one way. It is a very
poor estimate, I think, to form of a body such as we
hope the senate will be. 1 do not think we can do
better than adopt the suggestion made early in the
afternoon, namely, to appoint a select committee,
consisting of, say, the premiers of the several colonies,
and probably the ex-premiers—two members from
each colony —for the purpose of reconciling, as far as
possible, the differences which at present separate
hon. members on this great question, and of suggest-
ing to the Convention the most suitable form of
compromise which, in their opinion, ought to be
adopted.
Sir JOHN DOWNEB: Before the Committee
adjourns I wish to say a few words on what appears
to be a misapprehension as to my motive in moving the
amendment. Many hon. members, particularly the
hon. members for Yictoria, have complained of the
unprecedented character of the motion. These hon.
gentlemen appear to have entirely forgotten that it
is not the motion, but the antagonism, which is un-
precedented. No confederation has ever been formed
on substantially any other principles than those
which we are advocating now. The very essence of
federation is the enunciation and enforcement of
principles such as those which we seek to set up —
the preservation of the entity of the states as well as
the recognition of the voice of the individuals in the
whole federation. An hon. gentleman who comes
from Yictoria endeavoured by a false analogy —which,
by the way, does not seem to have worked very well —
to show that because in Yictoria, for instance, the
upper house has no power to alter money bills, there-
fore no such power should be given to the repre-
sentatives of an utterly different character, of the
different states. Even in Yictoria, where the fran-
chise is so low that the Legislative Council repre-
sents not merely the richer classes, but all the worthy
of the poorer classes, one would have thought that
there ought to be much greater power in the legis-
lative council than it possesses at the present time.
But whether that be so or not, it is clear that the
analogies which the hon. gentlemen who have objec-
ted to the amendment have endeavoured to draw
between the motion and the ordinary responsible
government in force in the colonies really do not
exist at all. I do not propose to address the Com-
mittee at any length. It is to be regretted, I think,
that any hon. members should have said that, unless
their views are carried out, federation, as far as they
are concerned, is at an end. Neither do I think that
any hon. member is in a position to make any such
declaration. I am certainly not in a position to
make any such declaration myself, nor do I believe
that any of my colleagues are. I am also equally
willing to believe that the Premier of Yictoria does
not altogether speak the voice of Yictoria when he


states that unless his extraordinary and unpre-
cedented condition is introduced into the federation
—a condition such as has never been known in any
body of the same kind—Victoria will stand out, and
this Convention will break up.
Colonel Smith : The hon. member is proposing
the extraordinary condition, not we !
Sir JOHN DOWNER: That is where the mis-
understanding comes in. The condition when the
present American Constitution wag formed
Mr.MuNEO: Does the hon. member propose to have
a similar constitution ? Let us understand what we
are doing!
Sir JOHN DOWNER : It was formed on what is
known as the Connecticut compromise. Under that
compromise, in which the smaller states thought they
had conceded so much, there was not merely the power
of vetoing, either in block or in detail, but the power
of amending money bills, as well as other bills —of
amending by increasing, as well as by reducing.
Although it was said by an early writer that an
arrangement was made which seemed to be illogical,
so far as our finite intelligence can be applied to the
subject, still the logic of history and subsequent
events is much more convincing than the intelligence
we can bring to bear on any given subject at a
moment’s notice ; and we know as a fact that instead
of the object being to preserve the co-ordinate
pow r er of the two chambers, that authority has been
preserved by the method adopted, and that instead of
the most extraordinary and unsatisfactory result,
coupled with universal discontent, which ought to
have logically followed, as the hon. member, Mr.
Baker, said at an earlier stage, the body in the state
legislature which is admired and revered by the
people of America is not the people’s house—the
House of Representatives, as it is called—but the
Senate, which is supposed to be raised to a lofty
sphere, which the people can neither see nor under-
stand. Another misunderstanding running through
this debate is this: it has been said that the voice of
the people must be heard. Of course it must bo
heard. The voice of the people will be heard in the
senate as well as in the house of representatives. It
will be as powerful, practically, in one chamber as in
the other. The electoral body that will return one
will practically be the same as the body returning
the other, with this difference: that whereas the
whole federation returns the house of representa-
tives, it will be the body of electors in each state that
will return members who will represent them in the
senate. The American experiment, which, as I have
said, was a compromise, has worked wonderfully well.
Now, the smaller colonies which have been so much
reflected upon, and who are supposed to be en-
deavouring to arrogate to themselves power and
authority to overwhelm the larger colonies, ask for
less than the smaller states of America asked for in
their time. They ask for the power of veto in detail
instead of in the whole, without any reference to the
power of making amendments by way of increase
or reduction. I can only say, as Clive said on a cele-
brated occasion, “ I am astonished at our own moder-
ation.” I think that the more my hon. friend, Mr.
Munro, comes to think the matter out, the more he
will disabuse his mind of false analogies, and the
more he will come to the conclusion that he was
mistaken in the somewhat hasty and impetuous view
he expressed in his utterances of this afternoon,
when he said that he spoke for the people of
Victoria.
Mr. BARTON : I move:
That the Chairman do now leave the chair, report progress,

To Sir Samuel Griffith, Vice-President, Federal Convention,
Sydney.
Copy of resolutions posted by the Committee of the Brisbane
Chamber of Commerce.
1. That the Australian Federal Convention, now sitting in
Sydney, is a marked event in the unfolding of Australian
national life.
2. That “one people, one destiny ” is the idea of a noble
aspiration, which in the hands of men already distinguished
by great public services, inspires a loyal confidence that it
will find practical expression in a lasting Australian con-
stitution.
3. That these resolutions be signed by the chairman of the
committee, and transmitted to Sir Samuel Griffith, with the
request that he will be good enough to hand them to the
veteran statesman and President of the Convention.
J. P, I)e Winton,
Vice-President, Brisbane Chamber of Commerce, and Chair-
man of the Committee.
16 March, 1891.
FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.
In Committee :
The Chairman : The question, as amended, is:
(1.) A Parliament, to consist of a senate and a house of
representatives, the former consisting of an equal num-
ber of members from each colony, to be elected by a
system which shall provide for the periodical retire-
ment of one-third of the members, so securing to the
body itself a perpetual existence combined with definite
responsibility to the electors, the latter to be elected by
districts formed on a population basis, and to possess
the sole power of originating all bills appropriating
revenue or imposing taxation.
The hon. member, Sir John Downer, proposed to
amend this question by adding the following words : —
The senate to have the power of rejecting in whole or in
part any of such last-mentioned bills.
It has since been proposed by way of amendment by
the hon. member, Mr. AVrixon :
That the amendment be amended by omitting all the words
after the first word “ The ” with a view to insert in
their place the following:—“senate shall have equal
power with the house of representatives in respect to
all bills, except money bills, bills dealing with duties
of customs and excise, and the annual appropriation
bill, and these it shall be entitled to reject but not to
amend. The act of union shall provide that it shall
not be law’ful to include in the annual appropriation
bill any matter or thing other than the votes of supply
for the ordinary service of the year.”
Mr. BARTON: I was much struck by the quota-
tions from Mr. Gladstone made by the President the
other day. Speaking of the English Constitution, the
President quoted him as saying ;
More, it must be admitted, than any other, it leaves open
doors which lead into blind alleys, for it presumes more boldly
than any other the good sense and the good faith of those
who work it.
Sir Henry Parkes went on to say :
The success of any constitution framed by man, the success
of every constitution, call it what you may, must depend upon
the good sense, self-restraint, and good faith of those who
work it.
That is the interpretation—it is, of course, the only
fair interpretation—which the President has put
on the words of Mr. Gladstone. That quotation
struck me when I read it. I did not hear the ad-
dress, but I read it as soon as possible afterwards.
In relation to this question of the powers of the
senate, that quotation has appeared to me to be an
argument which applies with singular force to the
whole of the view's which are held on each side of this
question. If the British Constitution itself, so elastic
as it is, is only a workable and smoothly working


machine, in proportion as those who work it are self-
reliant, self-restraining, and discreet, of course it is
not to bo expected that any other constitution labour-
ing, as any subsequent constitution must labour,
under the misfortune of being partly written, will
work with thorough satisfaction unless subject to the
same —shall I call them —lubricating influences. But
I take it that there is a great deal more than that in
the meaning of this quotation, because, turning again
to what the President said :
Whichever way we frame our constitution the rule of dis-
cretion and good sense that guides us must inevitably be the
same.
Although the argument appeared to be put forward
mainly in laudation of the British Constitution and
to a certain extent in disparagement of the proposi-
tions that have been made —that is, which had been
then made in debate and which have now taken a
more specific form in this Committee —still the force
of the argument ought to be the same whichever way
we frame our constitution, and the words themselves
uttered, I think I may fairly say, the strongest rebuke
to all those, whichever place they may come from,
who have made threats that they will leave us in our
deliberatioas. Surely if that is the rule under which
constitutions are to be worked, it is the rule under
which they are to be made. According to the pre-
science which the experience of Mr. Gladstone, as
here denoted, gives us, it is with that prescience we
know that, however we may err in allotting too much
or too little power to this or that body, we still have
the good sense of an English-born race to carry
us through, and we ought, at any rate, to exhibit
that amount of good faith in each other which
should forbid us from saying if you do not accept this
or that proposition we will leave the Convention.
It does seem to be scarcely a worthy, and scarcely a
dignified, position for any body of representatives,
sent here for the purpose of assisting to frame a con-
stitution, to take up, to resent, as some appeared to
resent, the investigation of their arguments. Surely
it is for the investigation of arguments that we are
here before we decide. And when gentlemen tell us,
when we investigate their arguments somewhat more
closely than is agreeable to them, that the next thing
we shall have to investigate will be the appearance
of their carpet bags, it does seem that they are, not
making too large a demand on our patience ; but
exhibiting a spirit at varience with that spirit of com-
promise which they have all professed to have so
much at heart.
Colonel Smith : The compromise is all on one side!
Mr. BABTON : It is like the Irishman’s reci-
procity —it is all on one side.
Colonel Smith : Wo are to do all the compro-
mising !
Mr. BABTON: The hon. member says he does all
the compromising. I do not think that is so ; but
he may have compromised his case to some extent
yesterday by his speech with which I will deal pre-
sently. Any other idea of compromise does not seem
to have entered his head.' If we are to start on what
has been called the do et des, or give and take prin-
ciple in forming our constitution, I venture to say to
this Convention we are beginning to make threats
a great deal too early, and I, for one, having the great
confidence that I have in our hon. friends from
Victoria, and other hon. members from elsewhere,
have not the least expectation, until the Convention
has done its labours, of seeing the pattern of their
portmanteaus. Now, there was another portion of the
President’s address which seemed to me to throw a good
deal of light upon the manner in which the adjustment
of the powers of the two houses of the general govern-
ment should be proceeded with. The President told
us that in the senate
we seek to create as lofty, as dignified, an upper chamber as
we can, and wc seek to create it as nearly on the British
model as we can.
Whether the latter portion bo entirely accurate or
not, I shall not undertake to say for the moment,
because I see certain amendments on the business-
paper as to which 1 may have to express an opinion
at a later stage, and which may throw some doubt on
the statement. We are also told that a senate ought
to possess the “ elements of a moral and just conser-
vatism,” and the President interpreted those elements
in this way. He said that they were
those elements arising from experience, from matured judg-
ment, from public probity, from steadfastness of purpose, and
from the trust which is imposed in certain individuals as the
growth of time.
That is a collocation of a large number of the very
highest attributes that could repose in legislators,
and it being the high ideal which our President has,
what struck me as being, at any rate, the subject of
some speculation, was this: Why, after having
created such a body as this for the avowed object of
conserving state interests among other things, should
we propose to degrade this body by refusing them in
the greatest emergencies the right to stand by those
very interests ? If you do this, you will have either
an altogether degraded senate —a senate which will
not be the object of any man’s ambition —or, if you
call to that senate, if you succeed in getting into it
men such as the President has so _ worthily and
eloquently described, what will be the result? If
they are a body of mature judgment and experience,
if they are a lofty and dignified body, is it a spectacle
for a free constitution that we should at any time
sec them sitting with folded arms while the interests
which they were elected to guard are passing away for
ever ? Surely it is not making a constitution if we
proceed in that way. If we proceed to work up to
and to realise an idea of this kind, and then, having
created almost the summum bonum of legislative power,
knock the very power out of its hands by a couple of
words in a federal constitution, surely we rather mock
than make a constitution. That is the view which
struck me as one which was, at any rate, tenable
from the remarks made by the President. After all,
it comes back to the quotation from Mr. Gladstone.
The working of any constitution will depend upon
the discretion and good sense of those who frame it,
and live under it, and it is not because that discretion
and good sense have had to be invoked countless times
for the preservation of a constitution —I use the term
with the utmost reverence —of the loose character of
the English Constitution, that we are to argue, that
when we make a constitution of a more defined
character that good sense will fly away if you import
a federal government. Surely that is not a good de-
duction from a knowledge of the race to which we
belong, or from the work which we ourselves have done
in the making of constitutions. But we are told
that we are now attempting to create two houses
having an equal power to deal with money bills as
they think fit. I venture to say, however, that
none of us are in any way seeking to confer with
respect to money bills, an equal power on the two
houses. Those who have been strongest in their
advocacy of this conservation of state interests to
the mutual satisfaction of the parties to this compact
have admitted all along that there is an ultimate
power which will vest in the hands of the people.
They begin with the power of origination, which in
itself, as any one’s experience of parliamentary pro-
cedure will tell him, as a sole power involves
practically the ultimate control. But it has not
been contended by the strongest advocate of state
rights here that under all circumstances and in all
events the veto which the senate may impose in
whole or in part is to be immovable and unchangeable.
Mr. Muxno : Yes!
Mr. Mooee : Ho !
Mr. BABTON: It has not been contented.
Mr. Muneo : Yes, by every one on that side!


Mr. BARTON : I say that it has not been con-
tended —at least that is my view. Every one of the
speakers, so far as I can understand his meaning,
seemed to couple his strong assertion of the necessity
of guarding these interests with the allowance that
when matters came to a deadlock or a crisis, there
must he some mode of settlement, and most of them
concurred in saying that in the ultimate resort there
must be some method provided by which the people
could decide either directly or otherwise.
Mr. Wkixon : That was said only by the hon.
member, Sir John Bray!
Mr. BARTON: It is the impression which I have
gained from the debates, and I think that if the hon.
member, Mr. Munro, had listened to and read these
debates with, perhaps, a little less of the idea that
hon. gentlemen opposite were attempting to make
some fixed and immovable thing which would have
been as hard to get rid of as one of Cleopatra's
Needles, if he though for a moment that those who
were opposed to him were nearly one and all con-
ceding that there must be at any rate some means of
removing friction and terminating deadlocks, I think
we should not have had this recourse to carpet bags
instead of argument. It is a very great mistake to
say that we are attempting to constitute two co-equal
houses. There is no one here whose remarks I can
interpret in that sense at all. Certainly, strongly as
I endeavoured to express myself on the subject, I
have no consciousness of having attempted to assert
that any such unalterable position should be taken
up, nor have I gathered the same from the remarks
of any one else who has taken part in the debate.
And now I would ask those who have given utterance
to something like extreme intentions on a supposi-
tion such as I have described, to pause a minute to
see whether there is not amongst us some means of
arriving at a reasonable conclusion which will not be
all giving on one side or all taking on the other. It
is not, as it has been described, a new-fangled proposal
that has been made. It is not, as it has been des-
cribed, something entirely un-English and utterly
opposed to the development of constitutional
government, because, although I, for one, agree
with the President in saying that we are not here to
make any mere transcript of the American Constitu-
tion, I think that we must concede that it was a highly
English population which framed the American
Senate ; and we must all concede that that constitu-
tion was framed with an intimate knowledge of the
constitutional history of the country from which its
authors had sprung, and with, so far as it might be,
a desire in what they considered safe limits to
imitate the model that existed for their emula-
tion and their wonder. But it is not proposed
to set up the American Senate as part of the
constitution now to be framed. The American
Senate has powers very much wider and very
much larger than any that are attempted to be
given by any proposal that has been made in this
Convention. To begin with, the limitation of the co-
ordinate rights of the American Senate is purely with
regard to bills for raising revenue, that is to say, tax-
ation bills ; and with regard to bills of appropriation
of the expenditure —as far as the constitution is con-
cerned, there is absolutely 110 limit upon their origin-
ating or co-ordinate powers. That has never been
proposed or suggested for a moment, nor has it been
suggested that the senate should be the depository of
these very large powers which accompany its exist-
ence in the American Constitution. I refer to cer-
tain rights with regard to impeachment, and to certain
other executive rights which here there is no intention
and no dream of conferring upon such a body. But
it is sought to be shown that where the citizen has to
be represented, first through the national assembly,
and next through another chamber, that where his re-
presentation in those two bodies is the sum total of
his representation, to take away any portion of that
full sum of representation is not in furtherance of the
spirit of democracy, but it is a lopping down of the
representation to which the democracy ought not to
consent. That is the position—and it is not an " ex-
tremely conservative" position—which those who con-
tend for a fair measure of pow T er in the senate are
now occupying. If a citizen is to be represented —
and we have it on high authority—the authority
quoted the other day, of Sir AVilliam Jones —that
the only men who can constitute a state are high-
minded men, who can see their rights, and, having a
just conception of them, dare maintain them—if that
is the definition of a state, then the representatives of
such a state are representatives of such men, and if
the representatives of the state in the senate are the
representatives of such men, and such a body as the
President has described them, then it is wresting
some of the citizen's power of representation out of
his hands to say, " As much as the house of repre-
sentatives may do anywhere else, it shall do and may
do here ; but, as much as under any other federal
constitution you know of the other chamber may do,
it shall not do." That is not giving his full sum of
representation; it is taking something away ; so that,
after all, the whole process that is proposed has
nothing un-English about it, because it is an attempt
to confer a full measure of representation, instead of
taking any of it away. That also lets some light upon
another branch of the question, because it has been
said that there is some analogy beetween the senate
proposed and other upper chambers ; and my hon.
friend, Mr. Deakin, said something about the ex-
perience of constitutions in British countries. Now,
the experience of constitutions in British countries,
with the exception of Canada, is not the experience
of federation at all, and so far as it applies to Canada
there are provisions in the Canadian Constitution
which tend at present, and may tend strongly ulti-
mately, to convert that constitution more into an
amalgamation than a federation, to minimise the
powers of the states, and to exalt those of the general
body. Now, it seems to be an accepted concession
on all hands that the powers to be given to the
federal body by his Convention, so far as it can induce
the concurrence of the respective parliaments, are
to be, without speaking of the American or Canadian
system at all, rather those powers which are expressed
as necessary and incidental to the purposes of federa-
tion, and not those which come within the large range
of powers included in such a clause as exists in
constitutions giving the residuary power to the
general body. If that is the intention, you can-
not carry it out without giving adequate power
to both your houses, because, by so much as you
depart from that, if you give too much power to the
senate, you tend to exalt the federal idea to the sup-
pression of the national idea; and if you do the
converse, as the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, I am
afraid, wishes to do, you tend to exalt the national
idea in the direction of unification or amalgamation,
to the destruction of the federal idea. That, I am
sure, is not the mandate which hon. members bear
from their respective parliaments ; it is not the
mandate which any one of our parliaments has given
us. We are told in that mandate —reading behind
the words in which that mandate is couched —we are
told that the kind of federation which Australia will
tolerate, the kind of federation which I hope it may
grow to love, is that which does not suppress or
tend to minimise the powers of the several states
beyond those matters Avhichare expressly taken away
from them. Then, I submit that by so much as you
diminish that portion of the sum of representation
of a citizen which lies in the senate, you will exalt
the national and diminish the federal principle ; by
so much as you topple over on the other side you are
doing precisely the converse. Then, what you have
to do is to see that you do justice, and to do justice
in this matter can never be consummated by bringing


about such an engrossment of power into the hands
of a national body as would result in the minimising
of the states who have never given any such man-
date to their representatives. On that ground we
are entitled and bound to report a strong senate
to our parliaments as a desirable provision in the
constitution. I submit that if we take away from the
senate the power of vetoing money bills, unless they
veto them altogether, ive shall so cripple that body,
that we shall not be able to report to our parlia-
ments that which I believe they want. It is all very
well to talk about the struggles that have taken
place. It has been said that the whole of the
struggle in England has been “ to wrest from irres-
ponsible power the right to deal with taxation and the
revenues of the country.” There is no endeavour
to give to an irresponsible power the right to deal
with taxation and the revenues of the country. If
there is anybody who doubts that I would refer him
to the resolution which we are considering, and
w r hich, referring to the senate, says :
So securing to the body itself a perpetual existence com-
bined with definite responsibility to the electors.
The doctrine of the denial of interference in any
way with money bills springs out of the maxim that
taxation and representation shall go hand in hand.
Where you have two representative bodies, then to
the extent of the proportion of representation which
you give the second chamber, you are entitled, hav-
ing faith in that maxim, to give it the power of in-
terference w r ith money bills. Now we are told that
such a provision as this cannot be grafted on to any
constitution in a British land. I would ask the hon.
member, Mr. Clark, what he thinks of that, because
if I remember rightly, there has been a power of
amendment in the Constitution of Tasmania ; and
although there may have been little tiffs, as there are
sometimes between married people, still, the consti-
tution of that country on the w r holo has worked w T ell.
There has been no deviation from the principle of
responsible government, and it exists with a power in
its upper chamber—to large a power, perhaps, to
confer on an upper chamber under the circum-
stances—which has not tended to the subversion of
responsible government, and which has certainly not
been any impediment to the smooth and constitu-
tional working of it. Therefore, if we appeal to ex-
perience, we have, at any rate in this direction, one
clear experience.
Mr. Burgess : It has been for the general
good!
Mr. Eysh : South Australia also !
Mr. BARTON: In South Australia there is a
degree of experience in the same direction; but lam
not going to enter into that matter. In Tasmania
there is a perfectly well-defined experience in the
same direction, that is, as connected with the w'orkiug
of responsible government, and that of itself seems
to solve a great many of the difficulties which hon.
gentlemen have felt when they have suggested that
the giving of powers of amendment or veto in detail
to a second chamber is incompatible with the working
of responsible government. It cannot be so. We
have proved that it is not so in the wmrking of the
matter.
Mr. Munro : Would the hon. member say that
the South .Australian upper house can alter the
details of an appropriation bill ?
Mr. BARTON : I was not saying anything of the
kind. I was appealing to the Constitution of Tas-
mania, which contains the power of amendment.
Sir John Brat : Does the hon, member say that
it expressly contains the power of amendment?
Mr. BARTON : I believe that there is some power
in that direction.
Sir John Bray : Does the hon. member say that
the constitution expressly vests the power of amend-
ment in the council in Tasmania ?
Mr. BARTON : In Tasmania, if I recollect.
Mr. Eysh : The power is an implied one, but the
practice is such !
Mr. BARTON : The point is not a very important
one, because the question is as to the working of re-
sponsible government where the power of amendment
is exercised, and if the upper chamber in Tasmania
has been in the habit of exercising the power of
amendment—sometimes the upper house have done it
even here, and have survived, notwithstanding all
they have heard by way of withering denunciation of
themselves
Colonel Smith : That is the worst of it —they do
survive!
Mr. BARTON: That is a matter of opinion. I
always notice that the time of practical politicians
generally comes when they have done representing
such places as Ballarat, and take a seat in the nominee
or upper chamber ; and we always find that on those
occasions there is a singular silence on subjects of
this kind.
Colonel Smith : We have no nominee chamber
there. It is elective!
Mr, BARTON: I know it is, and I recollect that
a very popular leader, under whom my hon. friend
served, has found occasion of late years to sigh for a
nominee chamber in the interest of democracy.
Mr, Munro : I would not allow him !
Mr. BARTON; I know that my hon. friend, Mr.
Munro, w r ould not allow him if he could help it. My
hon. friend, Mr. Munro, when we were yesterday
discussing, and he was saying something on the
subject of those powers, said, “We have, the represent-
atives of the larger colonies joining to insist on this.”
Some one made an interjection with reference to the
delegates of New South Wales, and his answer w r aa,
“ Those others are members of the Legislative
Council.”
Mr. Munro : In Victoria!
Mr. BARTON: I thought with regard to Now
South Wales too.
Mr, Munro : I said nothing about New South
Wales!
Mr. BARTON; It does not matter whether it
applies to New South Wales or to Victoria; but I
should like to know whether my hon. friend, Mr.
Munro, is under the impression that the argument of
a member of this Convention, duly sent here under
powers which he recognises, is weakened by the fact
that he belongs to either a nominee or an elective
upper house. If he thinks that the argument is
weakened, and thinks less of it for that reason, I ask
whether he imputes a motive to those who belong to
nominee chambers ?
Mr, Munro : I was not talking of nominee cham-
bers at all!
Mr. BARTON: I wnll say with regard to elective
chambers. Has the hon. member found that the
advocacy of the principle of representation of the
states in fair strength in the federal senate is confined
to members of the elective house in Victoria ? Has
he found that in his reading, or that the large body
of authorities who have dealt ably with this question,
and whom one cannot read too closely, are strongly
in favour of the granting of such powders to second
chambers where the federal principle prevails, and
have added their own meed of admiration of the
ability, the vigour, and the touch kept with the people
on the part of the Senate of the United States.
Without talking of making any mere transcript, let
us look at this one fact —that, with a people perhaps
the most democratic in the world, we find that their
veneration and respect for that chamber, their confi-
dence in it, is not only as great as it is for what is
called the popular chamber, but is even greater. That
is a sufficient answer by itself to any argument based
on the mere question of the support of a certain con-
viction by a member of an elective upper house. But,
going back from that, I come uow r tr what was said


by my hon. friend, Colonel Smith. My hon. friend
expressed a great deal of dread as to what would
happen if the smaller colonies were intrusted through
their representatives in the senate with the powers
here claimed ; and he pointed out that, with respect
to other matters, he was in accord with the resolu-
tion, which offered them equal representation on the
senate ; but he wished to confine their powers with
regard to money bills. "Well, if he has confidence in
their patriotism in this regard, and if he admits that
under the resolution to which he has assented, or a
portion of which, at any rate, may be said to have
passed its second reading, they are to be representa-
tive bodies—representative of the states which send
them there—why should he for a moment decline to
place in their hands with regard to money legislation
some modicum of the power which ho would give
them with regard to general legislation P
Colonel Smith : A modicum, but not the whole !
Mr. BARTON : The hon. member is willing to
give them that which is practically of no effect. I
may as well point out now what is so frequently the
result. I am not going to argue from what I am
about to say that upper houses elsewhere should have
those powers of amending or vetoing in detail money
bills, because that is beside the present question.
But wo have found that where that power is denied
the friction is greater than where the power is granted,
and the necessity of the case points out why the
frictionis greater—because, whore the poweris denied,
the immense probability in a largo class of cases of
money bills is that, where there is a matter of prin-
ciple involved, affecting rights which they think
should be conserved—this is a very important matter
when you come to consider it with regard to a federal
senate —the result of confining the pow T er of veto to
veto en bloc is this : either a good measure of public
policy is lost, because without rejecting it the second
chamber cannot preserve the rights which it has in
its keeping, or the measure of public policy is passed
for the sake of its policy ; and in passing it, the right
or principle which should be conserved for the public
safety is utterly sacrificed. That result cannot bo
good, for in seeking federation there would be sacri-
fice either of the public policy of the nation or of the
interest of the state, and if there is a way out of
the difficulty by which that sacrifice need not occur,
why should we not adopt it ? I do not say any more
than the hon. member, Sir John Bray, says, that
this power of veto should be final and conclusive.
Let us set our ingenuity to work; let us appoint a
committee on that subject, if need be, to find out
some means of accommodating this conflict. But do
not let us talk about packing our portmanteaux the
first difficulty Ave see. When people see lions in
the path the best thing for them is to drop their
portmanteaux and not to pack them.
Colonel Smith: The hon. member cannot get over
the carpet bag.
Mr. BARTON: I cannot. When I have heard
my genial friend, Colonel Smith, speak of his enjoy-
ment of his stay in Sydney the idea of his taking
ilight in that way causes me more astonishment than
I am prepared to express. There is one thing I
should like to instance as throwing considerable light
upon this question. Supposing that some of the
threats we have heard wore fulfilled. Supposing,
for instance, that a jot too much power in the
estimation of my hon. friend, Mr. Munro, and his
colleagues, were conferred on the federal senate —
that jot which was a little bit too much for them—
and that this exodus did take place, and we w T ere
unable to form this federation from the want of our
hon. friends ? What would be the result of that ?
It cannot be supposed that these colonies would
keep apart always. I am not going to threaten
my hon. friend, Mr. Munro, as a certain other
colony Avas threatened yesterday, with the formation
of another and an outside federation. But I am
going to suppose this case: that thinking better of
the policy of entire isolation some five or six years
hence —I hope, of course, he will still be in office,
and that there will be a coalition, ministry including
my other two hon. friends—Victoria has always
been supposed to be the colony most eager for federa-
tion ; and supposing that it became again ready for
federation Avith New South Wales, after the sudden
death of the principle in its heart, after the space
of five years, what would happen then ? By that
time, at the present rate of increase in the population
of the respective colonies, the population of Victoria
A\ r ould bo 1,250,000, and that of New South Wales,
as nearly as possible, would be 1,500,000. A popu-
lar assembly, formed at the ratio of one member to
every 25,000 persons, would give sixty representatives
to New South Wales and fifty representatives to Vic-
toria. Now, supposing the two colonies came to
terms, and had a little convention of their OAvn, just
as we are holding our Convention to-day, but on a
much smaller scale. We should then have the
question of the powers of the senate taken into
consideration. It would, of course, be conceded by
Ncav South Wales, as it is conceded to-day, that the,
representation in the senate should be equal ; but
if my hon. friend, Sir Henry Parkes —supposing
him then still to be leading the cause of federation,
as we all trust he may be if it is not accomplished
in the meantime —said, as he Avould say to-day,
“ Your senate may have the poAvcr of rejection. The
senate in which Ave are equally represented may
have the poAver of rejection; the house of represen-
tatives shall have the sole power of origination, and
there shall be no power of amendment,” what would
bo the retort of Victoria ? “ Your sixty represen-
tatives in the lower chamber Avould swamp our fift} r ,
and AA r here should we be P ” I imagine, whether
my hon, friend remained in office until then or not,
avo should have a very prompt recognition —not
only a recognition but a very prompt and sturdy
assertion —of the principle of state rights ao far as
it is involved in giving the poAver of veto in detail.
Mr. Munro : Not a bit of it!
Mr. BARTON : My hon. friend thinks not. Let
him wait until he comes to that position, if he ever
does. I would suggest to him that instead of raising
that difficulty, he should accept a reasonable solution
of this question. Let us appoint a select com-
mittee
Mr. Munro : Let us have it!
Mr. BARTON: Let us inquire calmly inlo the
matter, and let us have no more talk of catching the
express in a hurry.
Mr. Munro : No one talked about that but the
hon. member and the colonel!
Mr. BARTON : I have not the least doubt that the
colonel is a remarkably faithful representative of his
colleagues. I therefore submit, taking this matter
as a whole, that AA’hile reasonable compromise should
be acceded to, there should still be preserved that in
one of these chambers Avhich AviJl represent the federal
principle some poAver of dealing with money bills to
such an extent as will arrest the course of legislation,
if need be, in favour of state interests, and in the
course of arresting it will not cause the friction, the
irritation, and the jealousy which will result from the
losing of large measures of policy for the sake of an
amendment. I do not throw this out as a suggestion ;
but suppose that the power of veto in detail Avere not
exercisable after the specific matter on which it was
exercised once had been made the subject of a
general election, so that after the ascertainment of
the popular Avill a bill were sent up again involving
the same matter. Ido not suggest it as the best
A\ r ay of settling the difficulty, but it is one suggestion
Avhich no doubt will present itself to a committee.
Suppose it to be accompanied also by some provision
of this kind: That lest the non-intervention of a
general election should cause continued friction there


should be no veto in detail for a greater number of
times than twice. I do not say that would settle the
question. I do not say that, on thinking it out, it is
a proposition to which I should be ready to accede.
I say it is one of a number of propositions which
might well engage the attention of the Committee,
and that, therefore, we ought not to be keeping our
backs too stiff upon this matter. Sir, we ought to
entertain a reasonable probability, when wo arc
taking this matter a step further, which we may well
very soon do, that a compromise will be effected
which will enable us to deal with other lions in the
path, and will not force us to go back to those who
have sent us here to tell them that we have falsified
their hopes and met with a failure disastrous in
itself, and all the more ignominious because it arose
from mere irritation and jealousy.
Mr. WRIXON : I think the Convention is very
much indebted to the hon. and learned member, Mr.
Barton, for his temperate and able speech, and I shall
certainly endeavour to emulate him in his temper.
I thoroughly agree with him that we should all be
covered with discredit if we were to go back to our
different parliaments without arriving at a solution
of the difficulty which is now presented to us. I
think I can assure the hon. and learned member that
he has taken somewhat too seriously the allusions
that were made, if they were made, lo portmanteaux.
I am not aware that they were seriously made on one
side; but if they w r ere seriously made on one side, I
certainly have some little recollection of a similar
reference on the other side, and that some hon.
members on both sides seemed to say that unless
their particular views were secured they would be
likely to depart. If it was seriously said, all we can
say is : “ Brothers, we have both been in the wrong.”
I think we are all agreed that we must come to some
solution of the question. The anxiety which has been
shown by my hon. colleagues from Victoria on the
question of finance and state rights, I hope the Con-
vention will excuse when it bears in mind the fact that
while we represent the states or the colonies of
Australia, we do not in this Convention really repre-
sent the peoples. The smallest province in Australia
sends to this Convention precisely the same number
of representatives as does the largest, and, therefore,
if we think we notice, or if we fear we see any
tendency to ignore the views of great masses of men,
wo must be excused when it is remembered that
those groat masses of men are not adequately repre-
sented here. I am sure that will not in the least
detract from the fairness and consideration which
every hon. member will give to the problems sub-
mitted to the Convention. But we are now sitting
like the senate of the future constitution, as opposed
to the house of representatives. A very different
tone and a very different complexion of the difficul-
ties presented to us would prevail here. I imagine, if
wo had here 100 representatives representing all the
peoples. Therefore, our anxiety is that we are here,
as it were, merely representing the states. We
should not run away too much with the one view and
ignore the other, because we must bear in mind that
we cannot carry this thing, as we arc resolved, I
trust, to do, unless we have behind us the support of
the masses of the people. No support of large
territories will do it. We must be supported by the
masses of the people iu this country. If we display
any heat at all it is because we are anxious that we
should not now come to a conclusion or settlement
which afterwards would not he approved by the
public generally, and which, therefore, would not be
carried through. Now I thoroughly agree with the
hon. member, Mr. Barton, that we must settle this
question, and I think he left open a very important
avenue for settlement when he made this concession
•—which I must beg leave to say all the advocates on
■that side have not made —that he admitted that the
final power in all matters must rest with the house
of representatives. I think if that position betaken,
if it be accepted, there can be but little difficulty in
our being able to work out a solution. Because that
is all that we say. We do not claim that the house
of representatives shonld be able at once, and in a
hurried way to enforce its view even in the case of
money bills ; but all we say is that the ultimate
decision upon all bills —money bills of course in-
cluded—must rest with the representative house;
and in so saying I claim the opinion expressed by
the hon. member, Mr. Barton, as bearing out that
view. Now, the difficulty into which we are led,
with regard to the claims of the senate to amend
money bills, arises from the fact that wo do not
sufficiently recognise the difference between money
bills and general legislation. You will observe that
it is agreed on all sides that wo are not about to
adopt the American Constitution. That is not pro-
posed. If it were proposed, one result, of course,
would be that the government of the day would be
elected directly by the masses of the people, and in
such a case you may do as you like with legislation
between the two houses. In such a case you will
observe that the states, for whose rights many of us
are now so anxious, would have comparatively little
to say in the election of the government, because
they would be elected by the masses of the people.
If you do not propose to adopt that form of govern-
ment, you propose to keep to the English form—the
system of responsible government, and when you
talk of giving an equal power to the upper house
with regard to money and other bills we think you
do not recognise the difference between financial and
general legislation. It has in fact been denied
by an eminent authority that finance is legis-
lation at all, because it is concerned with the
carrying on of every-day government. It cannot
wait; the government must go 011. Money must
be found, and the body that really controls finance
unquestionably controls the government. Our diffi-
culty is that if you give up to your upper house,
under this English system, the right not merely to
reject any money bill —a right to be exercised in
some great emergency —but also the right to eliminate
items, you are giving them a right that will be incon-
sistent with the carrying on of the system; because, by
so doing, you would make the upper house really
masters of the government. I put it to any hon.
gentlemen who have held office in their own colonies,
whether they would be willing to carry on govern-
ment with a similar right on the part of their upper
houses —a right, you will observe, specially given by
the proposed bill to your senate for the purpose of
vindicating the rights of the states ? It would bo
not merely the right, but the duty of the senate, to
exercise their power of revising the appropriation
act, or any money bill, in every case in which they
thought the interests of any state were concerned. I
ask hon. gentlemen who have carried oxl government
in their provinces, whether they would be willing to
carry on the English system of government with the
same powers in regard to money bills on the part of
the lower and the upper houses.
Mr. GonnoK: There is no analogy !
Mr. WKIXON : There is an analogy if you at-
tempt to work the English form of government;
because what I say is this: that if you attempt to
carry on that form of government, it will be im-
possible to retain this power on the part of the
senate. In the proposed dominion act you would ga
out of your way to give special powjer to the senate
to eliminate any item from a money bill —say it was
a customs bill —to which it objected. I ask whether
you could carry on government satisfactorily upon
such a footing ? Would not the house having that
power really control the government ? Remember,
it is to have the power of finally saying what shall be
done as to this and that item —items all of which
may be necessary for the carrying on of every-day


government; and I ask again—could government be
carried on satisfactorily by a body of men respon-
sible to the lower house, and yet liable to have their
financial measures dealt with in such a way by the
upper house ? The scheme would not work. We
heard just now about Tasmania and South Australia.
All I can say is that I am not aware that any such
right as this has been exercised, and it undoubtedly
will be exercised if it be given in this instance. If
you give to the senate under your new constitution
the power and right to protect the states, as it is sug-
gested, it Avill unquestionably be exercised frequently
and freely, and I do not say that it ought not to be
so exercised, if given. lam not aware, I repeat, that
such a power has been exercised in South Australia
or Tasmania ; but even if it has, I doubt whether
although it may be exercised in smaller communities,
it would be followed in the case of the big govern-
ment and community formed under our new consti-
tutions. Therefore, I think we ought to be slow to
seek to grant final powers of this kind to the senate.
Here, I find myself coming very near to the hon.
member, Mr. Barton, because if he admits that this
power of checking on the part of the senate whether
it be by eliminating or amending —however you like to
put it —if he admits that that power is to be exer-
cised only temporarily, and that final power is to rest
with the house of representatives—if he admits that
it is only a matter of detail as to how we shall work
the matter out, because we do not claim for the
house of representatives power to pass anything it
likes at once and without demur or hesitation. What
we want is some assurance that the final power
of control with regard to finance shall not be
vested in a house which certainly would not repre-
sent the people of the community, for however you
may put it, however you may desire to preserve state
rights, you must recollect that state rights can only
be the rights of the people living in the state. When
you have Queensland and Western Australia—as you
will probably have them —cut up into smaller states,
you will have a large number of small states repre-
sented in the senate, but their representatives will, at
the same time, represent a very small proportion of
people indeed. Therefore, if you are willing to give
them this control over finance, which is the engine of
government, you will be handing over the control
from a large majority of the people to a very small
minority. Now, I will not go into the question of
whether the suggestion thrown out by the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. Barton, would be the best to adopt. I think
it is a very valuable suggestion. I may say that, in
consultation with some of my friends from Victoria,
the idea had occurred to us, although I think there is
not merely that way, but many other ways which I
need not now particularise, in which we can come to
a solution, if we would only accept the platform of
the hon. member, Mr. Barton, that finality must rest
with the house of representatives. If we accept that
platform, I think the machinery can be easily worked
out, for Ave never contended for anything more than
that the house of representatives should have its way
as to these matters after a decent and reasonable
interval. With regard to the ordinary appropriation
bill required for every year's service, that of course
does not admit of delay. I Avill not detain the Con-
vention, but I ask hon. gentlemen, Avho wish for state
rights, and who are anxious to see them carried out,
not to insist too far or too strongly upon views such
as some of their advocates have put forward. Vou
ought to take either one course or the other. If you
are not satisfied with the English system of respon-
sible government and boldly profess to adopt the
American system, then I can understand the position
—and I think there is a great deal to be said for that;
but if you do not propose to do that, I submit it is a
mistake to seek to get greater control for the states
by giving them power to interfere irrevocably and
perpetually with the finances of the day. I Avould
venture to repeat the suggestion I made before, that
you ought to look for strength for the small states —
and I would not wish to see them over-borne by the
larger states—but there are directions in which you
can get greater weight and authority for the states
than by following the American model, which would
not suit and would not work with our constitution.
For example, I would be quite with you in giving the
smaller states a larger proportion of representation
in the lower house —of course, up to a certain limit.
With a larger number of smaller states, having a
considerable representation, you would soon have
constituted in the lower house an important party
which no government could afford to disregard ; be-
cause the position in the dominion parliament would
bo that of a government seated on the ministerial
benches, anxious to retain office, anxious to carry on
successfully, and how could they do that except by
acting justly to the people of the whole dominion ?
There would be an important party representing the
smaller states —though, of course, not so large as that
representing the larger states —and the idea that the
two larger states would be united together against the
smaller states is evidently erroneous, because the two
larger states would have their rivalries between them-
selves which would prevent them from uniting and
harassing the others, I, for one, though I have
heard many disapprove of the idea, should not be
sorry to see some proposal adopted to the effect
that not more than a certain number of minis-
ters should be chosen from the larger states,
so as if possible to secure in the ministry the
presence of representatives of the smaller states.
But if we are going to retain the responsible system
of government, I would urge hon. members not to
insist upon this power of finance which has been
claimed by some delegates, though not by the hon.
member, Mr. Barton. I would ask them not to
insist upon that, but to join in meeting us in a com-
promise of this difficulty which will do what Mr.
Barton has said he is willing to do —leave the ulti-
mate power in the hands of the house of represen-
tatives.
Sir GEORGE GREY: I listened with very great
pleasure indeed to the speech made by the hon.
member, Mr. Barton, but on some points I thought
he was hardly sufficiently diffuse. He pointed out
to us very strongly that it would be unjustifiable
under any circumstances to say that any members
should leave this Convention in a state of hopeless-
ness of achieving anything. But he admitted one
point. He himself raised a question the other
night which made it very doubtful whether members
would not be justified under certain circumstances
in withdrawing. I understand from him that it is,
in his opinion, extremely doubtful if we have any
power to provide a federal constitution for the states.
A Ye were distinctly told that we were to provide a
federal constitution generally, and in addition to
that we are told by our own resolutions that we are
to provide a federal parliament —to really constitute
a separate federal legislature —and that there our
powers end, and that in point of fact the various
states are to be left under their present constitutions
to achieve such form of government as those consti-
tutions will permit them to attain. That is nothing
more or less than to say that we are forbidden to
give to Australasia at large a federal constitution
suited to the states and to the federal government.
If we have no power to give such a constitution to
the states, I say we have been deprived of the most
essential power of all, for it must be admitted, I
think, that the majority of the states, at least at the
present moment, are under constitutions which are
not of such a liberal character that their people have
a fair hope of achieving such a constitution as is
their right, unless we in this Convention have the
power of recommending—because that is our sole
power —what the federal constitution of the states


should be; and to say that we are not to be per-
mitted to recommend such a thing as that is to say
virtually that we ought not to sit here, and that we
have no power at all, for I am sure that no one but
an enemy to what I should call human freedom, such
as the world sighs for at the present day —no person
but an enemy to that freedom would contend that
we ought to insist upon setting up a federal consti-
tution of a kind which excludes the consideration of
the states. I think that the great error we are
making throughout is this: that we have not suffi-
cient confidence in one another, and in the work to
which we are called. If we have confidence in one
another, then, I say that we should not fetter the
coining legislature by any conditions that we can
possibly avoid ; we should simply give them an
entirely free constitution, freer, perhaps, than has
ever before been given, and then leave them to work
out the details of the constitution under which they
find they can properly fulfil their duties. Can any
one believe that in the present state of the world,
when one of the greatest movements which has been
in existence since the time of the reformation is
sweeping in waves over every country —can they
believe that a time has not arrived in which men
should arise to lead that movement forward, to
make it beneficial to mankind, and not to incur the
least risk of letting contests, feuds, and wars arise
from the movement which is in existence ? It is in
our power now to give an example as to what should
be done in this respect. It is in our power by having
confidence in ourselves, in our ability to achieve a
work of this kind, to do that which may really benefit
the whole human race; and I would remind lion,
gentlemen of this, that it has been invariably found,
in times of great movements of the public mind, such
as I speak of, that there do arise men, and I believe
such men sit here, who are "capable of guiding and
directing a movement of the kind. A nobility seems
to be given to human nature, a greatness to human
thought, a persistency to human labour, which breeds
up and brings out men fitted to meet great waves of
movement of the kind which are now going on in the
world. If we attempt to fetter the federal parliament
which we are creating, by depriving them of any
powers whatever, we shall be dealing unjustly with
them, and we shall be dealing unjustly with ourselves,
for we shall not be fulfilling those great duties to
which we have been called. I say, let us not attempt
in any way to define their powers where we can
avoid doing so. Let us not attempt to impose
any fetters upon them where we can possibly avoid
doing so. Let us with generosity trust that in
this new federal parliament which we wish to call
into existence there will be found those natural
leaders of men whom the circumstances of the time
will undoubtedly call forth. I, therefore, certainly
shall, as far as my vote depends, give it in favour of
giving to the senate all powers which are proposed to
be given to them now, not to limit them in any re-
spect whatever, and to believe that amongst that
senate will be found men of sufficient nobility and
greatness of character to use their powers solely for
the public good ; that they, benefited by the examples
given by quarrels between the two branches of the
legislature in some of our colonies and in other places
will avoid quarrels of this kind; that they will feel a
new epoch has arisen ; that new laws are required;
that new customs should prevail; that they do not
wish to follow the English system ; that they do not
wish to follow the American system ; but that they
wish to create an Australasian system suited to a new
country, a new climate, with a new race of men made
up of many nations. Such is the case with the in-
habitants of this country who have obeyed laws of a
new nature and new kind, and who have given ex-
amples to the older nations of the world. Let us
give to the men who are to represent such a people,
called together in such times, every power that we
possibly can, and trust and believe —I am sure our
trust and belief will be justified —that tbe coming
men will use tbe powers given to them wisely, and
we shall only do harm if we try to fetter them in the
way I have heard proposed by many. I, therefore,
shall vote for those who will give all powers to the
coming federated parliament, and who will do their
utmost in no way to fetter them or control their lino
of action.
Mr. MAY FORD; If we give all powers to tbe
members of the senate because we believe that they
will act fairly and do their duty to the state, cannot
the same argument be applied to the house of repre-
sentatives ? Cannot we say that we shall equally
trust them, because they will be men who will do
their duty, and do their best for the interests of this
great country? Wit In regard to the amendment
now before us —that of tbe hon. member, Sir John
Downer —hon. members have argued as if he in-
tended to couple responsible government with his
amendment. He proposes that the senate should
have powers almost equal to those of the house
of representatives ; but he does not propose that
these two houses shall be worked by an executive
under responsible government. He proposes to
adopt tbe Swiss system in framing the constitution,
and, therefore, the arguments brought forward, that
he is proposing something that cannot be worked
under responsible government, falls to the ground,
because he does not propose any such foolish thing.
He considers that if we give two houses coequal
powers, we must have another kind of government
in place of the British constitutional form of govern-
ment —the responsible form of government. The
hon. member, therefore, proposes that, under tbe
federal constitution, we shall have an executive
elected by both houses, and then it may possibly
work. In my first speech on the resolutions as a
whole I pointed out that it appeared to me almost
impossible to work responsible government with two
houses practically coequal in power ; that the minis-
try of the day would be bound to obey and be re-
sponsible to one house only. We have trouble
enough now to carry on work for any length of time
with responsibility to only one house. If we had
responsibility to two houses, the ups and downs
would be much more frequent. I have heard nothing
to shake my belief that if we have two hense "practi-
cally coequal in power, we shall not be able to work
responsible government with them. It is said that
the houses will not be coequal, because money bills
.can only be initiated in the house of representatives,
I would point out that that is a very small power
indeed. In carrying on the government of the
country, money Dills must be introduced, money
must be got somewhere, and although the money bill
originates in the lower house, it must, as a matter of
course, go before the senate. If the senate has the
power of amendment, it has practically the power of
deciding what shall be the form of taxation Tinder
■which we shall live. Therefore, the argument that
the two houses will not be coequal, because the
power of initiating money bills will be confined to
the lower house amounts to nothing. It has been
said that we have been working under a system of
responsible government in the little island of Tas-
mania, and also on the mainland in South Australia
where the legislative councils have the right to amend
money bills. I do not know what is done in Tas-
mania, but I know r that in South Australia the Legis-
lative Council has no right to amend money bills,
and the Legislative Assembly has never allowed
them to do it under any circumstances. I believe
the same words are in the constitutions of both
colonies, and also in the Constitution of Canada
at the present time —that is that only in the lower
house shall money bills be initiated —nothing more is
specified. But what has been the practice? We
contend that untler the constitutional form of


government which we bring from the old mother
country, although all money bills must be initiated
in the lower house, and although it may be argued
that that does not take away the right from the
upper house, to amend money bills, yet the analogy
of the House of Lords and the House of Commons
must bo carried out in this country. The lower
house has denied the right of the Council to amend
money bills, and there was a very severe struggle
over it. The result was a compromise. The Assem-
bly said, “If you (the Council) feel strongly that
you would like to amend any particular bill which
comes before you, you can send a message to the
Assembly stating what you desire, and suggesting
the amendment which you would like to see made ;
and the Legislative Assembly will then say whether
or not they agree with the suggestion.”
Mr. GtOudOjS- : If they do not agree, what happens ?
Mr. PLAYFORD: Then the Council generally
pass the bill, and do not trouble themselves much
about it.
Mr. Fysii : What provision does your special act
of Parliament make if such circumstances arise ?
Mr. PLAYFORD : It is simply a standing order,
and not an act of Parliament. There is a special
standing order providing the mode in which these
measures shall originate in one house and be sent up
to the other.
Mr. Fysii : Here is the act of Parliament!
Mr. PLAYFORD : This has nothing to do with
amending money bills. It is simply an act to issue
writs for the election of members. We have a pro-
vision that when in two sessions of Parliament the
Legislative Council refuses to pass bills which the
lower house has passed, we can dissolve a certain
portion of the Council, and send them to their con-
stituents.
Mr. Fysii : This act was passed because of their
interference with money bills !
Mr. PLAYFORD: We have the power, when the
lower house for two sessions running pass a measure
which is rejected by the upper house, if an election
has intervened, of dissolving the whole of the Legis-
lative Council, and sending them to their constituents,
or of dissolving a part of that house, or of asking
the constituencies to elect eight new members.
Mr. Fysii : That relates to money bills, as well as
to other bills !
Mr. PLAYFORD : That is not the point. The
point on which I am arguing is that we do not allow
the Legislative Council to amend money bills. We
only allow them to make suggestions, which is a
very different thing, indeed, from the right of amend-
ment.
Mr. Cuthbert : Would the hon, member allow the
senate to make suggestions ?
Mr. PLAYFORD: Yes, I should not have the
slighest objection to the senate making suggestions
to the house of representatives—in fact, I know that
a bill has been drafted by the hon. member, Mr.
Kingston, in which the right of the senate to make
suggestions if they like is preserved. But there is
one point which we must not overlook, and which it
would be well to decide before we consider the powers
to be given to the senate, and that is, who are to elect
them ?
Mr. Muneo ; Hear, hear! That is the serious
point!
Mr. PLAYFORD: It is a very serious point,
because if they are to be elected in the way in
which I think they ought to be elected, and that is,
not directly by the people, but by the elect of the
people, I believe that we cannot follow a better course
than that which has been adopted by the Americans
with regard to their Senate. In "the election of
members to the American Senate, each state by their
own legislators elect their representatives.
Dr. Cockburn : Those elected by nominee houses
could not be elected by the elect of the people!
Mr. PLAYFOED: There is little trouble there,
but even in that case we must leave the colonies
themselves to decide whether they will or will not
have nominee houses. If the great mass of the
people are opposed to the principle of nominee houses
they can soon get rid of them ; but if they are
willing to put up with them, I do not know that
it is for us to dictate to any colony the form of
local government which it shall adopt. Therefore,
if we say that we will give the states the power
of electing, through their local representatives, the
representatives to the senate, we shall have to give
the nominated houses in New South Wales and in
Queensland a share at all events along with the
house of assembly in the election of those members
as we shall give to the elective upper houses in
the other colonies, their right to elect them. But
I contend that if they are to be elected by the
people and by districts you may almost work your
federal government with one house, because the
one house would simply be a reflex of the other,
and you do not want an absolute reflex in your
senate of the house of representatives. I think,
therefore, that we had a great deal better decide how
the senate' is to be elected before we decide what
powers we shall give it. If its members are to be
elected directly by the people in the various states,
they will only reflect to a very considerable extent the
people's voice, and you may give them more power
than you would if they were elected by the state
legislatures. If they are to be elected by the state
legislatures, I think you might give them less power.
My own idea is that the resolution moved by the
hon. member, Sir Henry Parkes, so far as state rights
and state interests are concerned, gave all necessary
power to the senate, except that it did not provide
against that most objectionable practice by which
upper houses have been attempted to be, and some-
times have been, coerced—that is the tacking on to
money bills a number of measures to which the lower
house knew that the legislative council very seriously
objected, and of which they would not otherwise
approve. I think that if we protect the interest of
the states by giving them equal representation in the
senate, no matter what their population is, and if wo
give the senate the right to reject any money bill
they may receive from the lower house, surely, with
the majorities they will have there, the rights of the
smaller states throughout Australia will bo sufficiently
protected. If we give larger rights to the senate than
have been proposed by the hon. member, Sir Henry
Parkes, we shall make the difficulty of responsible
government greater and greater in proportion to the
extra powers that we give, until we make the upper
house co-equal, or practically co-equal. I can tell
hon. members that we shall not b6 able to work the
ordinary form of responsible government with two
houses having such powers. I think if something in
the shape of the suggestion made by my hon.
colleague, Sir John Bray, were adopted, it would
meet the case. That is, if the senate say that in the
introduction of certain measures something is joined
to them which they would like to consider separately,
apart from these measures, they can pass a resolution
stating that, in their belief, it interferes with state
rights and interests, and they can ask that the matter
be introduced in a separate bill. That will prevent
the tacking on, it may be to a loan bill, of a number
of heavy items which would have to be expended in
different parts of the dominion, and some of w r hich
might trench somewhat upon state rights and state
interests. The senate will have the right to say,
" We desire that a certain portion of this bill should
be sent up to us as a separate measure," and that
measure will be considered upon its merits without
any connection with the other portion of the loan
bill. I contend that so long as you preserve the
senate from the liability of having to consider au
appropriation bill or any other measure on to which


are tacked certain objectionable matters winch they
would like to consider separately, and so long as you
give them the right to say, “ We should like to con-
sider these matters separately,” they have all the
right, and all the power for which they ought to ask,
and which they ought to expect, unless the Committee
are prepared to go the whole length of the proposi-
tion of the hon. member, Sir John Downer, and to
say, “ Give them all rights, do away with responsible
government, and work the government on the lines of
the Swiss Confederation.” And, mind you, there is
a great deal to be said for the Swiss Confederation.
It has worked well since 1848. They elect the
ministry from the members of Parliament after the
general election. It has a life of three years, and no
two members of it are to be taken from one state.
Mr. Munro : They have altered it very much since
then!
Mr. PL AFFORD : They have altered it in one or
two directions, but not very much. It has been
altered more in regard to the referendum. In the
first instance, a referendum was only allowed with re-
gard to the alteration of the constitution, and not with
regard to general subjects ; but they have enlarged
the power of referendum, and they have given some
powers of initiation which were not in existence be-
fore. But the main features of the executive and
legislative were there before. They have two houses,
which when they meet together after a general election
choose a ministry for three years. These ministers
retire from Parliament and form what, I think, is
called the general council. Other men are elected in
their place. Ministers have the right to speak, though
not to vote, in either of the two branches of the legis-
lature. The ministers meet together and decide upon
the measures which they will introduce: and, consider-
ing the difference in race and in religion which there is
amongst the members of that federal state, the constitu-
tion has worked admirably. They have worked it ex-
ceedingly well, and to the admiration of every writer
I have read who has written on the subject; and there
is a great deal to be said in favour of the proposal of
the hon. member, Sir John Downer, in that direction.
I believe, however, that the people of this country are
not prepared for that ; they will be more likely to
give their adhesion to a constitution upon old and
familiar lines, in preference to one upon lines with
which they are not so familiar. I only trust that we
shall be able to arrive at some compromise by -which
the people, through their representatives, will be, as
they ought and must be in every democratic country,
the final arbitrators in any conflict between the two
houses. I understand that the hon. member, Mr.
Barton, is quite prepared to allow the people, in the
long run to decide. He has given way to that ex-
tent : therefore, I do not see why w T e should not be
able to arrive at some compromise by wdiich we shall
preserve, on the one hand, the rights of the individual
states, so that they shall not be ridden over rough-
shod by any combination of larger states, and on the
other hand preserving for the populous states rights
and powers in the lower chamber in which they will
bo more largely represented. I feel certain that,
whatever form of constitution in that direction will
bo devised, some system of compromise will prevail,
and that we shall find that w r hat appear to be difficult
problems will be more easily solved than we at present
imagine. We shall also perhaps find, as the Americans
found in connection with their constitution that those
parts of it which were regarded with the greatest pride,
and as the most perfect—that of the principle of
electing the president, for example —will in their
working, turn out to be those about which we shall be
least proud. I certainly trust that we shall arrive at
some arrangement whereby we shall preserve, on the
one hand, the rights of the states, so that they shall
not be trampled upon, and on the other hand, the
rights of the people, so that they shall not be cur-
tailed.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: The hon. gentleman
who has just sat down referred to what he understood
to be a suggestion by the hon. member, Mr. Barton,
to the effect that in the case of a conflict between the
two houses, the difficulty should be settled, in some
way or other, in accordance with the wishes of the
house of representatives. I did not understand the
hon. member to make any such suggestion. I under-
stood him to say that any question of that sort must
ultimately be decided by the people. Of that there
can be no doubt.
Mr. Platfoed : That will be by the people’s re-
presentatives !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Who are the peo-
ple ? The people are the people of the whole of
Australia. In the event of there being such a strong
divergence of opinion between the people of the
smaller and the larger states that they cannot agree,
and no compromise can be arrived at, there will
only be one alternative; they will separate.
Mr. Gillies : That is not what the hon. member,
Mr. Barton, conveyed to the Committee !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: If the settlement of
that question is left entirely to the majority, in the
sense in which the hon. member uses it, that is, to a
majority consisting of the people of the larger colo-
nies, it means that in the event of a conflict, the
opinion of the larger colonies is to prevail.
Mr. Platfoed ; Not necessarily; they may be an-
tagonistic !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH ; It means that. That
is, of course, equivalent to saying there is to be a
revolution. No system of constitution which we can
frame will provide against a revolution, or against
the colonies being so unfriendly that they will not
work harmoniously together. Wo must face that
difficulty. As has been pointed out by the hon.
member, Sir Henry Parkes, all difficulties must be
settled by mutual goodwill. lam afraid we are at
at present at cross purposes; and I am anxious to
know what are the differences of opinion between us.
I think the confusion has arisen very much from
talking about money bills. There is no doubt that
this idea of money bills is a fetish peculiar to
Australia. It is a fetish which is not worshipped in
any other part of the world; it is not worshipped
even in the Uuited Kingdom. The circumstances
there are of course quite different to what they are
here. The House of Lords is a very peculiar institu-
tion —it is peculiar in its constitution and in its
history ; and there is every reason in the world why
it should not interfere with the taxation of the
people. There is no - similar house in the whole
world. This fetish about which we have been talking
for so long a time is peculiar to Australia. How
many constitutions are there in America P There are
forty-two different states which have various consti-
tutions ; but they all agree in giving the senates or
second chambers power to deal with money matters.
There is no such fetish worship there. They have
the English system in Canada ; their upper house is
as nearly as possible a reproduction of the House of
Lords, and there the powers of the senate are natur-
ally and properly restricted. We find responsible
government working with two equal houses all over
the continent of Europe. It is only in Australia that
this fetish has been set up and worshipped. It
reminds me of a story I once heard about a celebrated
New Guinea fetish, which the Hon. John Douglas had
great difficulty in discovering. It was found to be in
an outer wrapper as large as a good-sized carpet bag.
After a great many unwindings, it was found to
consist of an extremely small pebble. Nobody had
ever seen it before or knew what it was. I wish to
get at the heart of this trouble in regard to money
bills. The term “ money bill,” is a most confusing
term.
Colonel Smith : Would the hon. member allow
the senate to alter an appropriation bill ?


Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Is it the annual ap-
propriation bill, containing the ordinary supplies of
the year, which is sought to be withdrawn from the
senate ?
Mr. Playford : That is one !
Colonel Smith : Would the hon. member allow
them to alter a customs bill ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: If it is the annual
appropriation bill which is sought to be withdrawn
from the senate, I do not think the matter is worth
discussing. Nobody -would want to alter it, unless
the house of representatives were to attempt to
coerce the senate by putting in improper or unusual
items. I want to get at what we are quarrelling
about. So far as the ordinary items of an appropria-
tion bill are concerned, I do not think the subject is
worth half an hour’s discussion. But those who
have had experience of conflicts between the two
houses know how the lower or representative house
refuses the right to the upper house to deal with
money bills, to make amendments, to alter the dura-
tion, incidents, or conditions of a tax or charge, oven
in the smallest degree. They may not even improve
the machinery or correct obvious errors in the
method of collecting a tax, or the expenditure of
money.
Sir Johy Bray : The machinery ought to be con-
tained in a separate bill!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: But the machinery
is not always contained in a separate bill. No
advantages are gained by this restriction, so far as I
can see. Even a very useful amendment is not allowed
to be made. Why? Because, under our constitu-
tion, the upper house have only certain powers, and
they have been trying to exceed them, and friction
has arisen, not because they were exercising powers
which they possessed, but because they were trying
to exercise powers which they did not possess. This
discussion has proceeded to a groat extent on the
assumption that if second houses had these powers,
they would always be exercising them, and always
bringing things to a deadlock ; but the history of all
the world, without a single exception, shows that
that is not what happens. The only deadlocks that
have occurred have been deadlocks in Australia
when the upper houses have been trying to exercise
powers that they did not possess. Where upper
houses have been exercising powers that did exist,
there have been no deadlocks, or if there have been
deadlocks, it has been because things had become fit
for revolution. I am anxious to know what are the
points on which such power should be withheld from
the senate ?
Colonel Smith: Would the hon. member allow
them to alter a customs bill ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: With respect to
altering a customs hill, I can see gi’eat incon-
venience in allowing them to alter a customs bill.
On the other hand, there might be inconvenience in
preventing them from doing it.
Sir Thomas Mcllwraith : A great deal more !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: As far as the
ordinary appropriation bill is concerned, I do not
think that the matter is worth fighting about. Most
of the argument used has been made to apply to
money bills generally —a class which none can des-
cribe in a few words, for almost any sort of bill can
be made into a money bill. Most of the argument
has been applied to these in order to show that the
ordinary machinery of government could not go on
if the senate could interfere with money bills.
Why? If that means that the ordinary machinery
of government could not go on, if the senate inter-
fered with the appropriation bill, I could understand
the argument. But it must be remembered that it is
not proposed to deny the senate the power of veto.
Surely if the senate wanted to stop the machinery
of government the way to do that would be to throw
out the appropriation bill. That would effectually
stop the machinery of government. I, for my part,
am much inclined to think that the power of absolute
rejection is a much more dangerous power than the
power of amendment; yet it is a power that must be
conceded. We all admit that; and in a federation
there is much more likelihood of that power of
rejection being used than there is of the power of
amendment being used. It is said that the upper
houses in the Australian colonies are coerced by putting
things in the appropriation bill. So they are in the
United Kingdom. Why ? Because they are part of
the same community, living in the same place, and
elected by or chosen from the same class of people;
but let it be borne in mind that in the federal consti-
tution the members of the senate would come from
different parts of Australia, and be charged with the
duty of protecting the rights of their own states, and
if they saw that those rights could be protected only
by rejecting a measure absolutely, and not by any
smaller or milder action, I am sure that they would
not hesitate to reject it and take the consequences.
Dr. Cockbury : You could not bring any public
opinion to bear on them !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: As the hon. member
implies, the only public opinion that you could bring
to bear on them would be the public opinion that
approved of their action. So I think that the power
of rejection, although a much greater power, is more
likely to be used to the detriment of the general
welfare of Australia, than is a reasonable power of
amendment. I have no objection on my part to
restrict the power of amendment on certain lines, but
hon. members who represent the other view must
bear these facts in mind. In respect to making both
houses finally amenable to public opinion, that will
of course come about; but, still, you cannot lose
sight of the fact that the public opinion to which the
two houses would be amenable would not be the same
public opinion. The public opinion of the majority
of the house of representatives
Colonel Smith : Contains the whole!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: The public opinion of
the majority of the house of representatives is the
whole, and is the public opinion of the majority
of the whole. The public opinion of the other
house is of the majorities of different parts of the
whole, which may be quite a different thing. There
is, however, no danger of the senate being out
of touch with the people of its own state, at any
rate not for long, unless you make their term of
office too long, because, as has been i pointed out,
suppose the senators retire one-third every two
years, by the time any serious difficulty has been
going on for two years there will be a fresh election,
and the men that come in will represent present
public opinion—there will be one-third representing
the latest phase of public opinion, and another third
will be soon going for re-election, and they will at
any rate trim their sails to what they believe to be
public opinion. So there will always be two-thirds
of the senate working in direct touch with public
opinion. There is, therefore, I think, no danger of
its being irresponsible or unimpressionable in that
respect; but to provide for anythingl ike dissolution,
or its being coerced by a majority of the other house,
would amount to what I said just now —the larger
states would be in a position to coerce the smaller
ones.
Mr. Deakin : No !
Colonel Smith : The very reverse!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: They can do that
only if they are strong enough, and if they are strong
enough vis ultima ratio —force is the last resort in all
matters. Our business is to frame a constitution
that will work without resort to force—at least I
thing so.
Mr, Myhro : Tell us how this is to be done !
Sir oAMUEL GRIFFITH: How what is to be
done ?


Mr. Munro : How are we to have a constitution
so framed as not to cause collision between two
houses.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: It is absolutely im-
possible to frame a constitution that will not allow of
conflict between two houses. Every constitutional
government consists of two or more parts, each one
of which can put the machine out of gear. That is
the essence of constitutional government. The only
moans of avoiding collision is to have autocracy.
Constitutional government includes a great many
forms. Any sort of government in which different
bodies act as a chock on others is constitutional
government. Constitutional government is not by
any means the same as responsible government, and
responsible government is quite a different thing
from parly government. Constitutional government
simply means the existence of the checks of the
different bodies on one another. Responsible
government practically has come to mean a govern-
ment which is turned out of office when it does not
command the support of the legislature ; and party
government is a thing of wdiich we have had some
experience in Australia, but which I am afraid is
becoming somewhat discredited. There are one or
two colonies in which party government, as described
jn books on the subject, has almost ceased to exist.
This is a digression. From what my hon. friend,
Mr. Munro, has said, I take him as perhaps an
extremist on this particular point. I therefore ask
him what are the particular subjects in detail which
he wishes to withdraw from the senate ?
Mr. Milano: The appropriation bill and the
customs bill!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : For my part, if that
is all we are quarrelling about, he and 1 would not
be very long in coming to a conclusion.
Mr. Hires : That is surrendering something!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: We are all here to
surrender something. The general term “money
bill”
Sir John Beat ; Sir Henry Parkes does not say
“ money bill,” but “ appropriating revenue or im-
posing taxation”!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH; But bills appro-
priating revenue include a large number of bills.
Taxation bills include a large number of things
besides customs.
Mr. Playford: Yery few r bills appropriate reve-
nue except the ordinary appropriation bills !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Many bills besides
the annual appropriation bill appropriate revenue.
Mr. Playfoeh : Not in our colony !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: If we knew the
contention on the other side, we should be closer to
a solution of the difficulty ; but when arguments
are applied in different senses, and when an hon.
member, speaking from one point of view, is an-
swered by another hon. gentleman using the same
■words in a different sense, we are not likely to
approach the termination of the argument; but if
we can narrow the matter dowm, we may very soon
come to a conclusion.
Mr. M ACROSS AN : I am not at all surprised at
the great difference of opinion that has arisen
amongst the members of the Convention on the
subject now under discussion. It has arisen very
much through a mistaken idea of the hon. members
from Victoria, chiefly, and of the Premier of South
Australia. They cannot get out of their minds the
idea of a legislative council such as they have in
their own colonies. They do not seem to appreciate,
or to realise thoroughly, the conditions under" which
we are here to try to form a federal constitution.
We are not here, in any way, to reproduce a con-
stitution exactly like the constitution under which
the different colonies arc now working, and, indeed,
we could not do so in carrying out a federal con-
stitution. VYc are here, representing different
states or colonies, and our mission is to federate
these colonies into one united body, to exercise
power over the whole of Australia. We cannot do
so on such lines as w r e are working on at present in
our several colonies, and if hon. members will simply
get rid of that idea, I think we shall very soon arrive
at a satisfactory conclusion. There is another matter
also Avhich has helped to confuse the minds of hon.
members, and that is the idea of small states and largo
states. Now, we are not here as small states and large
states. AYe are here as representing sovereign and
independent colonies—independent and sovereign
from each other as much as we are from any other
portion of the world. If hon. members would
simply realise that fact, they would much sooner
come to an understanding with each other than they
seem likely to do now r . We are here, as I say,
representing independent and sovereign communities,
and in representing those communities we expect, of
course —in fact, we shall be obliged —for the purpose
of forming a federal constitution, to surrender certain
sovereign rights which we now possess. But we are
here to adopt a federal constitution, and surrender
as few sovereign rights as possible in doing so, and
all we can be expected to do in reason is to surrender
as much as will be necessary to carry out federal
government in Australia. This idea of small states
and largo states is not a democi’atic idea. It is
purely an aristocratic one. It does not exist in
any federal democracy in the world. If w T e begin
with the great federal democratic states of
America, and look at the populations of the states
there when they adopted their present constitution,
we shall find that two states actually dominated
eight others as far as population was concerned.
The states of Pennsylvania and Virginia had more
population than eight other states had, and the
question there arose of small states and large states,
but it was amicably settled by the method which is
proposed here—by the senate representing equally
every state. As far as my reading of American
history goes, the question has never arisen as to
small states dominating large states in the Senate.
They have always worked amicably together, being
reasonable men, and, as many hon. members say, we
must expect to have reasonable men elected as our
senators. AVell, having worked together under cir-
cumstances which have been more difficult I believe
than any we shall have to work under in Australia,
I think it is reasonable to expect that with people
springing from the same race, and having exactly the
same traditions, and having the same experience of
the British empire to go by, we shall work equally as
amicably and without friction between the two
houses,
Mr. Munro : There were none of them as large as
ours, or as small as ours!
Mr. M ACROSS AN: I beg the hon. gentleman’s
pardon; there are some of them as small as ours
now.
Mr. Munro : Not one !
Mr. MACROSSAN : The hon. gentleman is not
thoroughly acquainted with the subject.
Mr. Munro : I am. I challenge the hon. member
to cite a single state at the commencement of the
Union as small in numbers as AYestern Australia, or
as large as New South AA r ales.
Mr. M ACROSS AN : One speech at a time. The
hon. gentleman will have an opportunity of speaking
afterwards. But it really does not affect the question
in the least whether any state in the American
Union had a few thousand more or a few thousand
less than AYestern Australia has at present; the
principle is the same exactly. AYe cannot get states
that are equal in population and equal in area unless
w r e cut Australia up, which we do not intend to do.
AYe intend to retain the autonomy of the states
as they exist at the present time. Therefore, the
population of, say, Rhode Island, or Maine, or


Vermont, or any of those small states at that time
has nothing whatever to do with the question now.
But there is a now in the American Union
which has two representatives in the Senate. It has
not had for years enough population to entitle it to
one representative in the House of Representatives ;
still, it sends two members to the Senate, and its
population is smaller than Western Australia’s at
the present time.
Mr. Mooee ; That is a territory.
Mr. MACROSSAN: There are several other states
which are only a little above that. But at the present
time there is one state in the American union which
has actually more population than twelve or thirteen
states. That state has never raised the question, as
far as I have hoard or read, of being afraid of being
injured in any way by the power which has been
given to the senate; I refer to the state of New
York. I picked out this morning from the “ Ameri-
can Almanac ” fourteen states that have less popula-
tion than the state of New York, There are now
forty-four states in the Union, and those fourteen
states send twenty-eight members to the Senate, out
a total number of eighty-eight members. Surely
they can dominate New York and other states if
they choose to do! But they are reasonable men, as
we, I hope, are here, and as we expect our senate
and our house of representatives to be. I need not
follow that argument, as far as America is concerned,
any further. The same thing exists in Switzerland.
In Switzerland one canton—Berne —actually has
double the population of eight other cantons. Each
canton sends two members to the council of the
states. No question has arisen there the same as it
has arisen here with us. AYe are actually fighting a
a shadow I believe. AYo must remember that there
is no country in the world where democracy rules so
perfectly and so uninterruptedly as it does in
Switzerland, and has done for a very long time.
Therefore some hon. members are not carrying out
the democratic idea at all, as they think they are
doing, by arguing in the sense in which they have
been arguing. They have been carrying out the
aristocratic idea far more than the democratic. I
would like those hon. gentlemen very fairly to under-
take the question from the democratic idea, and not
from the aristocratic one.
Mr. Platfoed : Democracy and state rights are
synonymous terms!
Mr. MACROSSAN : We are here to preserve our
state rights. AYe are not here to make a senate
which shall be a counterpart of the House of Lords.
Colonel Smith : Hear, hear !
Mr. MACROSSAN: The hon. member from
Ballarat says, “ Hear, hear ” ; but that is what he
really wants. Our different constitutions, as far as
the legislative councils are concerned, have been
framed more or less upon the lines of the House of
Lords, and upon the idea which has prevailed in
England for the last thirty or forty years, or probably
longer, that the House of Lords shall have no real
power in the constitution whatever. If the hon.
gentlemen from Victoria and the Premier of South
Australia want a counterpart of the House of Lords,
I think that that would be a constitution for the
senate which would never be adopted by the people
of Australia. It is a well-understood fact that the
leading members of the two historic parties in the
House of Commons in (Treat Britain have agreed
long ago that the House of Lords ought to be recon-
structed. A third party, which is coming into
existence very rapidly, promises that when it does
come into existence as a party it will reconstruct the
House of Lords out of the world altogether. Is it
these that these hon. gentlemen want us to adopt ?
Mr. Platfoed : Certainly not!
Mr. MACROSSAN : It certainly is.
Mr. Platfoed : Certainlv not !
Mr. MACROSSAN : I say we would resemble the
House of Lords if we adopted a constitution for the
senate such as has been advocated here. It would
resemble the House of Lords in nothing so much as
its feebleness and want of authority. That would be
the real result of it. Now, the question, I think, has
been very well put by my colleague, Sir Samuid
Grriifith, as to veto in part and in whole, or a veto in
part alone. Hon. members from Victoria and the
Premier of South Australia are quite willing to
give the senate the power of rejecting the whole bill.
They are quite willing to give to that body the
power to throw the whole legislative and administra-
tive gear of government out of action ; but they are
not willing to give to it the power to cut out one
or two lines to which they may object. Is there not
an absurdity in that ? The Premier of Victoria went
so far as to deny that the greater included the less
—we all know that he meant only politically. Those
gentlemen are quite willing to give to the senate the
power to deal with questions which, in my opinion,
are much larger and of much more importance
than the question of cutting a £IO,OOO or £20,000
line out of a loan or appropriation bill. There are a
great many questions which are coming to the front
not only here, but everywhere else in the world—•
important questions that will soon come to the front as
questions of practical politics. Yet these gentlemen
are willing to give to the senate the power to deal
Avith these questions —I mean the labour question,
and social questions —compared with Avhich the mere
question of amending a money bill sinks into insig-
nificance. Here, then, is another absurdity in the
arguments of hon. members. I myself think that
Ave are in reality splitting straws. One of the
delegates from Queensland has pointed out that the
senate as constituted would be far more likely to
reject bills as a Avhole than are the present legislative
councils. That being so, it Avould be amenable to public
opinion in the particular district in which the senate
held its sittings. I think, therefore, that gentlemen
Avho are opposed to its exercise of the powers of veto
in part are really splitting straws, and that it would
be more judicious on their part, if there is to be a
compromise, to give Avay upon that point. Eor my
part, I do not see how a compromise can be effected. I
do not believe in any compromise which gives up the
poAver of rejection in part. If it can be brought
about in some other Avay A\ r hich will render the
proposal more acceptable to gentlemen from Victoria,
Avho object to it in its present form, I shall raise no
objection; but Ido object to any compromise giving
up the poAver of amendment in part by the senate.
I think it is an indispensable power for them to
possess, not only in the case of money bills, but in
the case of all other bills. Then there is a question
which I think hon. gentlemen have overlooked,
which Avill in a great measure modify the action of
both the senate and the house of representatives.
Do not let us forget the action of party. ~We haA T e
been arguing all through as if party government
Avere to cease immediately we adopt the new consti-
tution. Now, I really do not see how that is to be
brought about. The influence of party will remain
much the same as it is now, and instead of members
of the senate voting, as has been suggested, as states,
they Avill vote as members of parties to Avhich they
will belong. I think, therefore, that the idea of the
larger states being overpowered by the voting of the
smaller states might very well be abandoned ; the
system has not been found to have that effect in
other federal constitutions. Parties have always
existed, and will continue to exist where free men
give free expression to their opinions. Parties exist
in the American Senate, and if there were any dis-
position on the part of the smaller states in America
to combine in any way to act unfairly towards the
more popular states, party influences would intervene,


and the same thing would take place in our senate,
and it will take place also in our house of repre-
sentatives. I have not the slightest fear of the
two more populous colonies —New South Wales and
\ ictoria—combining to do anything to injure the less
populous states as such ; neither have I any sympathy
with the idea that ministers should be selected from
any particular state or group of states. I think that
the member of the house of representatives who is
called upon to form a ministry should be at perfect
liberty to select what members he pleases, no matter
from what state they may come ; and I am quite cer-
tain they would act as they do now under our present
constitutions ; they would act fairly towards each
part of the federal union, just the same as ministries
act now towards each part of the colonies Ihey
govern. In this matter w r e have forgotten entirely
the action of party. It will act as a powerful sol-
vent to prevent unfairness either in the house of
representatives by the more populous colonies, or in
the senate by the less populous colonies, and I hope
hon. members will not forget that. A question has
been raised on this particular subject as to the
nomination of senators. I believe entirely in the
American system of nomination —nomination through
the legislature. I know that my hon. friend, Dr.
Cockburn, from South Australia, has ad objection to
this, because certain houses are nominated instead of
being elected. That is an objection w r hieh exists in
my mind also; but, nevertheless, I do not think it
is one which should stand against tho election of
senators by the legislatures, because the senate above
all things is supposed, and will be supposed, to
represent the states. The colonies as they exist now,
or the states as they will be in the future, are repre-
sented in their sovereignty at present by their legis-
latures. Whether the upper house is a nominee or
an elective house makes no difference, It is tho
legislature that representsthe sovereignty of the state,
and that which represents the sovereignty of the
state, in my opinion, should have the power of nomi-
nation to the senate. 1 hope, therefore, that the
idea of electing senators from the body of the elec-
tors will be given up. It is not a sovereign idea at
all —quite the reverse. Besides there are objections
equally as strong as that of which I have heard some
hon. members speak. As to the ministry being re-
sponsible to both houses, I think that is an utter im-
possibility. I do not see how a ministry can be held
iu any way to be responsible to both houses of par-
liament, especially as one of those houses is to have
a continuity of existence. If the senate was to be
placed on the same footing as the house of repre-
sentatives, and was to be dissolved on tho same
occasions, there might be something in the proposal.
But as it will have a continuous life, and as whatever
definite responsibility it may have will be through
the nominations of the legislatures of the different
states, I do not see how a federal ministry can be
responsible to any house but the house of representa-
tives. Then comes in the question of public opinion.
Hon. members are afraid, seemingly, that the senate
will get beyond the opinion of tho people of Aus-
tralia. I have no fear of that whatever. I do not
believe that the senate, which will be elected by the
different legislatures, will ever get very far beyond
the force of public opinion in Australia. They may
probably do so on some questions for a short period ;
but as has been pointed out by the hon. member, Sir
Samuel Griffith, the continuity of existence applies
to the house, and not to the members of that house.
The members of the house will be continually re-
newed, and they will be acted upon, I have not the
slighest doubt, by the public opinion which they
represent; and w r hatever objection they may have to
certain measures or to the policy of ministries who
are responsible to the lower house, public opinion
will have a certain force upon them, and compel them
ultimately and without any statutory enactment
whatever to give way to the force of public
opinion throughout the colonies when it is pro-
perly expressed. I trust that we shall make our
senate a strong and a powerfel senate —a senate
which w ill have dignity and authority, and onew r hich
will not only be respected by the states whom it will
represent, but respected also by the people whom it
will represent in a second degree. Because it is not
true to say that they will not be representatives of
the people. The Senate of the United States of
America and the States Council of Switzerland re-
present respectively the people of those two countries
as much in a secondary sense, and in some cases
more in a primary sense, than does the lower house.
The Senate in America is looked up to with the
greatest respect; in fact, it is the-ambition of capable
and eminent men to become members of the Senate ;
and I hope a similar ambition will exist in Australia
owing to the power and dignity which our senate will
possess. I have no fear of the senate ultimately be-
coming the master of the house of representatives as it
has become, to some extent, in the United States. In
the United. States it has other pow T ers and authorities
delegated to it, entirely apart from legislation. It is
as much a part of the executive as is the President
himself. This has given an amount of influence to
the Senate in America which our senate can never
hope to possess. Therefore, Ido not think we need
be at all afraid of the senate overbearing the house
of representatives by its superior influence. But I
hope it will tend in that direction by its superior
ability, being the elected of men who are themselves
elected for their ability by the different states. I
hoard a proposal mooted this morning by an hon. dele-
gate from Victoria, Mr. Wrixon, which rather
astonished me. That gentleman is so much opposed
to giving a veto in part in respect to money bills to
the senate that ho would prefer to destroy the very
root and basis of the representation of the people by
giving a greater number of representatives to certain
individual states which do not possess a largo popula-
tion at the present time. I hope the members of this
Convention will not agree to any such proposition.
The smaller states, such as Tasmania, Western Aus-
tralia, Queensland, and South Australia, will be so
thoroughly protected in the senate that it will bo a
crime against the proper representation of the people
to give them additional representation in the house of
representatives beyond what they are entitled to.
Each state must stand upon the basis of its own
population as far as the house of representatives is
concerned ; but in regard to the senate the states
will be thoroughly protected by the equal number of
representatives that each will have in that house.
The idea of the hon. member, Mr. Wrixon, is a most
undemocratic one, and strikes at the very root and
basis of popular representation. Just fancy 40,000
or 50,000 people in Western Australia having five or
six representatives, when the same number in Vic-
toria or New South Wales would only have one or
two representatives! It is right enough to do that
in representing the sovereignty of the state wheve all
are equal, but in the representation of the people
each unit of the people should have his full and equal
share. I trust that no such proposal as that men-
tioned will be entertained, lam quite satisfied that
we shall come to a satisfactory conclusion on this
question. lam not at all afraid of the Convention
resulting in disunion, and members going back to
their different colonies without having done anything.
I do not mind very much the expression made use of
bv the Premier of Victoria, or by others, and to
which Mr. Barton this morning made a jocular
allusion— I allude to the reference to “ carpet-
baggers.”
Mr. Muneo : I never said anything of the sort!
Mr. MACBOSSAN: I know the hon. member did
not say that he was a “ carpet-bagger ” ; but the hon.
member, Mr. Barton, said as much.


Mr. Munbo: It was tlio hon. member, Colonel
Smith, who said that—l did not!
Mr, MA.CEOSSAN : I do not mind that very
much. When I recollect the history of this very
question in the Philadelphia Convention, I am thor-
oughly convinced that we are arriving quickly at a
satisfactory conclusion. The discussion of this pai'-
tieular question occupied five weeks, from the begin-
ing of June until the middle of July, in that conven-
tion. We have almost arrived at a satisfactory con-
clusion in two days. Therefore, I have every confi-
dence in the ability and wisdom of the members of
this Convention to thoroughly thrash out this crucial
question, so that member's on each side may be thor-
oughly satisfied with the conclusion we arrive at.
Even if the hon. members from Victoria did take up
their carpet bags and go, I do not believe that they
would stay away. I believe that the public opinion of
their colony would drive them back again, because I
have come to the conclusion that, although federa-
tion is a very desirable thing for Australia, there is
no colony in the group for which it is more desirable
or necessary than the colony of Victoria.
Mr. J. EOEEEST: I should like to make one or
two remarks with reference to the speech of the hon.
member, Mr. Macrossan, who would deny to the large
colonies having a small population a larger amount
of representation than they would be entitled to
according to population. I would remind him that
the proposal to deal with such colonies in an excep-
tional way is no new idea. When British Columbia
joined the Canadian federation she had only a popu-
lation of 60,000, but she was allowed six representa-
tives, which was a larger number than she would
have been entitled to on the basis of population.
Unless you can give some special advantage to
colonies with immense area and small population they
will have no inducement to join the federation. The
colony which I have the honor to represent is sepai’ated
by an immense distance from the other colonies. She
has no manufactures, and I have been considering
during the last few days how I can urge upon the
people of Western Australia that she will gain any-
thing by federation. I have been unable to see how
she will gain anything, although my sympathies are
entirely with the desire that she should be an integral
part of a united Australia.
Mr. Gordon : What about defence ?
Mr. J. EOEEEST: I cannot see that, even with
regard to defence, she will be a gainer by federation.
We are separated from the other colonies by 1,000
miles of unoccupied territory. That part of Austra-
lia has no naval defence, and for many years to come
we must look for our defence to the power of Great
Britain, which is the only power able to defend us
from enemies coming across the sea.
Mr. Mtjnro : The federal government will have a
navy!
Mr. J. EOEEEST: It may have in many years to
come. Those hon. members who have spoken with
reference to the constitution of the two houses have
been too apt to look at the matter from the point of
view of the colonies which they represent. As has
been said by several other hon. members, the consti-
tution of the two houses under a federal form of
government will be very different from the constitu-
tion of the two houses in any colony. Under a
federal form of government there will not be so many
local interests and feelings as there are in the parlia-
ment of a colony of limited area, where popular feeling
runs high. Another point has been overlooked which
is certainly an argument in favour of the proposition
that the senate should not have the power of amend-
ing money bills. We have been apt to consider that
the representatives of the colonies in the upper house
would be all of one mind, whereas we must not
forget that there will always be a strong opposition
in the house of representatives, among the members
from the great colonies of Yictoria and New South
Wales. Therefore, Ido not think that the influence
of the numerous representatives of those two colonies
will be used to the disadvantage of the smaller colo-
nies. There seems to be an impression that the
nominated upper houses in some of the colonies
should not be allowed to exercise the same power as
elected houses in selecting members of the senate.
I cannot see any objection to their doing so, although
it has been strongly urged by the hon. member, Dr.
Cockburn. The senate will be selected by the
legislatures of the different colonies, and will not be
elected directly by the people. The nominated upper
houses in the colonies of Australia are not in the
strict sense of the term nominated, because they are
appointed by a species of election. They are ap-
pointed by the representatives of the people, the
ministry, who represent the whole country; and
therefore it would not be right to say that there
is not a system of election in their selection. There-
fore I cannot agree that there is a vast difference be-
tween the upper houses of Queensland and New South
Wales and those of other colonies where they are
elected, and I do not see why they should not join in
electing members of the senate. The sooner we
bring this debate to a conclusion the better. If we
appointed a select committee to frame a bill in ac-
cordance with the views which have been expressed
by hon. members, that would be the wisest step to
take. We have had sufficient discussion to enable
the members of the committee to know the views
entertained by every member of the Convention. I
hope that, whatever may be our views, we shall not
separate without framing a bill and passing it through
this Convention. I do not think that it matters
whether different sections of the Convention are or
are not able to accept this bill; but it would be a
great pity —I think it would be a misfortune—if we
were to separate without framing a bill for the federa-
tion of these colonies in accordance with the views
of the majority of the Convention. Whether that
bill is or is not accepted by the different colonies
hereafter, it will be a guide in the future to those
attempting to frame a federal constitution ; whereas
if we were to separate without coming to a con-
clusion which would record the views of the
majority of hon. members, I think we should feel
that we had wasted our time. I hope, therefore, that
whatever', we do, whatever our opinions, we shall,
before we conclude the sittings of this Convention,
frame a bill which shall, at any rate, represent the
views of the majority of those present.
Mr. BAKER: I do not think that time will be
wasted in thoroughly discussing this point. It is
perfectly true that most of the arguments which have
been hitherto adduced have been repeated by dif-
ferent speakers and put into different forms; but it
often facilitates the understanding and the settle-
ment of the real point at issue to hear the same
arguments put in another form, because they often
carry conviction to the mind the second time that
they are heard, although they did not do so the first
time. There is one matter, it seems to me, so inti-
mately connected with the respective powers which
we ought to give to the two branches of the federal
legislature that, in my own mind, I cannot dissociate
them ; and although it is, perhaps, quite correct that
we should first of all fix and define the respective
powers of the two houses, and then fix and define
what the form of the executive should be, there has
been an assumption throughout this debate that we
are bound to have what is commonly called responsible
government —that we are to have our federal executive
framed in the same manner as the executives in the
diferent colonies. That is an assumption to which I
cannot agree, and for which I think there is no warrant,
and I wish to say a few words on the point, because
those who have entertained that assumption have
argued that we must give, not only the preponderant


power, "but nearly all tlie power to tlie national
branch of the legislature. Now, undoubtedly, if we
are going to have an executive formed on the same
principles as the executives of these colonies, one
branch of the legislature must have nearly all the
power. Executive government has entirely risen up,
and been created solely by the assumption and arro-
gation of all power in one branch of the legislature.
What is the British Constitution? It seems to me
—and I sweep away the theories on the question —
that in reality the British Constitution is the House
of Commons with appendages. The House of Com-
mons does all the legislation of the country, and by a
committee of its own the Ministry performs all the
executive functions. Is that a form of executive
which will fit in with the federal form of govern-
ment, which w r e are trying to frame ? Ido not think
it will; I think the two things are inconsistent with
each other. We have been told that we ought not to
try experiments. We have been told by the hon.
member, Mr. Gillies, that we ought to follow the
beaten path. Well, if there were any beaten path to
follow, I should be exceedingly glad. But it seems
to me that we are cutting a new path through a
jungle, and that there is no beaten path to follow.
It will be as great an experiment as it is possible for
ns to try, to apply the responsible system to a feder-
ation in which the two branches of the legislature
will represent the whole of the people grouped in a
different manner. lam very sorry that wo have to
try the experiment. lam one of those who are ex-
ceedingly loath to try experiments ; I believe that
any political system ought to be of gradual growth—
that the idea ought to be engrained in the minds of
the people, and that, if it has grown up with the
people, its chances of success are very much greater
than they would otherwise be. I am, therefore, one
of those who are exceedingly loath to try experi-
ments, and more especially so in this case, because if
we try an experiment which fails, that failure will be
put down to the system of federation, and the whole
system will be discredited. If I could be convinced
that we are not trying an experiment by grafting on
to the federal form of government the British form
of executive, I, for one, should entirely agree with
the President upon the point. But it seems to me
that this is an experiment, and that the two things
are entirely inconsistent with each other. And I
will quote the opinion on that point of a writer who
is celebrated not only as a man of letters, but also as
a politician and a statesman —Mr. J. It. Lowell, who
was the American Ambassador in Great Britain,
In the Fortnightly Feview of February, 1888, he
wrote an article on*“ English and American Federal-
ism,” in which he contrasted the aspirations of a
portion of the British people for imperial federation,
with the aspirations of some Americans to abandon
their present form of executive, and to adopt the
British form of responsible government. Haying
first made some observations about the American
form of executive, and the idea that the English form
of executive could be grafted on to American insti-
tutions, he says :
If a strong and responsible government be established,
individual and local rights will disappear, and a highly
centralised representative democracy will arise upon their
ruins.
There are some members of this Convention who
want a highly centralised representative democracy
to be framed to start with. Mr. Lowell continues:
In England the case is precisely reversed. A highly cen-
tralised representative democracy exists already, and-it is de-
sired to import into this form of government some of the
advantages of a federal constitution, and some safeguards for
individual rights and privileges, to adapt some of the modern
conveniences of a written constitution to the stately old fabric
that has been building ever since the dawn of history. r lhe
attempt is utterly useless. The former building must be
pulled down, and the new building begun at the.found-
ations.
I entirely agree with those sentiments. And in com-
mencing this new building at the foundations, let us
build those foundations in such a way that we can
erect upon them a superstructure that will be consis-
tent within itself. If we are to try an experiment,
and I think we must do so, let us try that experi-
ment in the form that is most likely to work. In a
quotation concerning the British Constitution, which
was made by the President the other day, and which
has already been quoted to-day, Mr. Gladstone hav-
ing referred to the fact that without good sense, dis-
cretion, experience, and statesmanlike qualities in
those who worked the British Constitution, it would
be utterly unworkable, goes on to say, that “this
boasted constitution of ours is nothing more nor less
than a heap of absurdities.” M r ell, why should wo
adopt a heap of absurdities with the sole view of
calling out those qualities to which the President so
eloquently alluded as necessary to the success of any
form of government which relies upon the discretion
of the members of the two branches of the legisla-
ture ? It has been said that sensible shareholders and
a sensible board of directors can work any deed of
settlement; but is that any argument why a deed of
settlement should be badly drawn ? Let us draw up
our deed of settlement, which we are here to draw
up, as well as we possibly can. lam perfectly will-
ing to admit the argument which has been adduced to
the effect that unless we assume all those qualities
which have been alluded to as existing, not only in
both branches of the legislature, but in the execu-
tive in whatever form it may be appointed, the form
of government we are about to frame will be entirely
unworkable; but do not let us advisedly leave more
to their discretion than is absolutely _ necessary. I
hope I am not departing from the point under con-
sideration, because it seems to me that this idea that
we must take either the English or the American
form of executive is totally unwarranted. There is
another form of executive which has been alluded to
once or twice —the Swiss form, in which the execu-
tive are chosen for a fixed period by the two houses.
Why should not we adopt that form ? It is a form
admirably suited for a federal form of government.
The ministries nowadays are appointed nominally by
the Crown, but we all know that they are really
chosen by one branch of the legislature, and why is
it impossible to work out the representative form of
government by both branches of the legislature
directly choosing the executive, who will be respon-
sible to them, and who will not be turned out at a
moment’s notice on some party question ? Has this
svstem of party government w’orked so well that we
cannot improve upon it ?
Mr. Gillies : That is dealt with in the next reso-
lution !
Mr. BAKER : I know it is ; but it seems to me to
be so intimately connected with the question under
discussion, and the assumption so often made, that
we must adopt the responsible form of government,
has been so mixed up with the question of what
shall be the relative powers of the two houses, that it
is pertinent to refer to it now. I, for one, think
that the people of these colonies —I am not now
talking about the parliaments —would hail with satis-
faction a departure from the system under which
ministries are now appointed. If there is one
thing with which the people of these colonies find
fault in our existing forms of government, it is
the fact that two-thirds or one half of the time
of parliament and the ministry is taken up by the
quarrels between the “ ins and the outs ; and if
anything could do away with that state of aftans
if ministries were enabled to devote the whole of
their time and attention to carrying on the business
of the country, and the framing of wise measures,
if they were not obliged to fight day after day
simply to retain their seats, and w r ere not obliged
to bring id measures which they would not have


brought in were it not for party purposes—the
people would be much better satisfied with that form
of executive than with the form under which we now
live.
Mr. Gillies : That could be done by abolishing
the “ outs ” !
Mr. BAKER: Well, if the hon. gentleman was
one of the “ outs ” he would not like to be abolished.
I apologise for having, in the opinion of some hon.
members, referred to a question which will come up
for discussion at a later stage. As I said before, it
seemed to me that the two questions were so depen-
dent on one another that I might appropriately say
a few words upon them now.
Mr. THYNNE: I think the question whether
the executive should or should not be responsible to
parliament is one which we can leave for full debate
afterwards. In passing, I may say that it seems to
me to be right that parliament, which has the power
of the selection of ministers, should also have the
power of dismissing them. I did not rise, however,
to enter into any long discussion on this question,
but to make a suggestion which occurred to me this
morning while the debate was proceeding. There
seems to be a disposition on the part of a good many
members —especially the members for ATctoria and
one or two others—to think that the senate, as pro-
posed to be framed by a majority in the Convention,
would not work satisfactorily with the house of
representatives. If hon. gentlemen are still im-
pressed with that idea, I think I may well make the
suggestion which I have submitted to several of my
friends, and who desired me to mention it this after-
noon. It is this: that if either house of parliament
should, by a specified majority, pass any measure in
two successive sessions, and the other house should
refuse to pass it, a simple mode of settling the ques-
tion would be to refer it to the direct vote of the
people in the same way as measures are submitted in
Switzerland; and if the answer is given in the
alfirmative by a majority of the whole of the people
and also of a majority of the states, that the bill
should become law. I do not think ray hon. friends
from Victoria can question the proposition as being
one not framed on sound democratic lines.
Mr. Deaktk: Hear, hear!
Mr. Gordon : It does not matter whether you
snuff out the states by a vote of the people, or by
a vote of their representatives. It is as broad as it
is long,
Mr. THYNNE : A bill under such circumstances
would become law unless adopted, first, by a
majority of the wdiole of the people, and, secondly,
by a majority of the states.
Sir Thomas Mcllwraitii : Not a majority of each
of the states!
Mr. THYNNE: A majority of the whole of the
states. The answer should be received from a
majority of the separate states ; in fact, it is the old
democratic principle of a majority of the whole of
the people and a majority of individual states. I
think that is a suggestion well worth considering,
and one which should relieve those gentlemen, who
are so very much opposed to the proposal to give the
senate such large powers, from any great difficulty.
I do not anticipate that such a provision would bo
likely to be brought into use for many years. I have
sufficient confidence in the class of men who will be
elected to the federal parliament to believe that they
will conduct their business as reasonable men. But,
if that should not be the case, there would be a
remedy provided —a threat held over them w'hich
would prevent them at any time from acting in an
unreasonable fashion.
Sir JOHN DOWNER: Having listened with
great interest and much instruction to the speeches
which have been made by hon. gentlemen who have
addressed the Committee, I have thought it would
not be out of place if, as the mover of these resolu-
tions, I were to say a few words at this stage. 1
■was very much struck with the argument of the hon.
member, Sir Samuel Griffith, in reference to denying
the power of veto in detail, and preserving the
power of veto in bulk; and particulai'ly with the
argument which appears to me, at all events, to be
irresistible, that seenig that the senators will only
represent their own colonies, and will only have to
justify themselves to their own colonies, the same
obstacles and difficulties in the way of vetoing in
bulk at the present time will certainly not exist.
Practically, therefore, a much greater power is given
in allowing the senate to veto in the whole than, that
which we aro now seeking to establish, which is
simply the power of vetoing each proposition singly.
Mr. MUNRO : But you are claiming both !
Sir JOHN DOWNEE: Certainly; but the hon.
member, Mr. Munro, is willing to concede the
greater and the more dangerous power, and the power
which will more likely be given effect to in the event
of a conflict; while he objects to concede tho minor
power which will not, under any circumstances, affect
the general government of the country, and will pre-
vent all possibilities of a deadlock. As to the speeches
of the hon. and learned member, Mr. Barton, and
the hon member, Mr. Macrossan, it appears to me,
whilst their arguments are practically irrefutable,
that in the minds of some of us, at all events, their
conclusions are open to great doubt; in fact, so
different were my own conclusions from the very
able arguments that were addressed to us that I felt
myself thrown back to the last century, and to the
more philosophical times, and began to wonder
whether anything existed apart from the perceptions
of him who perceived. One writer said, " A brook
reflects heaven ; but man looking into it sees only
his own image " ; and he further said that " the horse
and the ox," and another animal not present here,
" all feed on the same pasture, and each of them
assimilates to himself that which is suited to his own
idiosyncracies." It struck me that the arguments
addressed to us pointed irresistibly to only one con-
clusion, and that the very able gentleman who urged
them arrived at a conclusion in precisely the opposite
direction. I might once again draw into this debate
my hon. friend, Mr. Gillies, who has not spoken
lately, but who addressed us before. If the senate
will be—as the hon. and learned member, Mr.
Barton, says it will be, and as I understand the
Legislative Council of "Victoria is at the present time,
and as the hon. and learned member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, pointed out, the hon. member, Sir Henry
Parkes, also thought it would be—the representa-
tion of all that is best in the intellect and morality of
the community, it would seem to me to follow as a
fair corollary that we could by no possibility have a
better government. But whilst the hon. and learned
member, Mr. Barton, said that the senate which
represents the states must practically be a body that
we ought to constitute on the most lofty platform,
and preserve there as much as we could —whilst
he said that under its constitution it would draw
to itself all the ablest and purest minds in the
community —he nevertheless conceded that so far as
regards large questions which other speakers consider
the essence of government, questions involving
finance, the senate should have no authority to
interfere in detail, but only the authority to abso-
lutely reject, in spite of that authority being so
much more dangerous, and so much less workable
than the more limited authority that I propose to
give it. Many suggestions have been made in the
course of this'debate as to the advisability of refer-
ring this proposition to a committee. I think that if
a committee is to be appointed at all, it should be
apponited in respect of all the propositions, and not
in respect of any one of them. If there is any
one proposition more particularly than another that
we shoqld settle now, and should not refer to a


committee, it is the question as to the constitution of
the parliament that is to be the supreme authority.
Sut HENRY PARKES : Hear, hear !
Sir JOHN DOWNER: The executive is to be
made for the parliament, and not the parliament for
the executiA'c, and before Ave can posibly say Avhat
the executive ought to be, or whether any known
analogy Avil 1 assist us in defining the lines on Avhich
it is to be constituted, surely the more logical thing
is to find out Avhat the executive has to do. To con-
sider first of all the constitution of the executive,
and afterwards to consider the constitution of the
parliamentary bodies, appears to me to entirely
transpose the natural order of things. As I say, the
executive must be made for the parliament, and not
the parliament for the executive. But I think, at the
same time, that it might be well, and save a great
deal of time, if Ave were to send all these questions to
committees without coming to any vote upon them
at the present time —to send No. 1 and No. 3, involv-
ing the parliament and the executive, to one com-
mittee, and No. 2, Avhich is a separate question alto-
gether, not invoNing those questions at all, but the
question of a court, to another committee. As far as
1 am concerned, I shall oppose any attempt to rele-
gate to a committee the Ist proposition and to pro-
ceed to discuss and settle the 3rd, for, as I said, it is
altering the proper order of things, and we ought to
settle No. 1 before we settle No. 3. But if this
Committee will agree to at once send all these three
resolutions to two committees —one committee for
No. 1 and No. 3, and the other committee for No. 2
there will be a great saving of time, and Ave
possibly might be able to arrive at some modus
vivendi. The suggestion of my hon. colleague, Sir
John Bray, is in effect to do in an indirect way AA r hat
I Avould rather see done in a direct way. I should
like, and I am sure many hon. members here would
like, to see the senate have such high authority as to
ensure the universal esteem of everybody ; and if we,
at the very beginning, say that so far from having
co-ordinate authority with those who immediately
represent the mass of the people, the senate is to be
entirely a subordinate body, and upon all the im-
portant questions Avhich, according to some speakers,
are the very essence of government, it is to have no
voice at all, or a voice which the other branch of
the legislature dares them to exercise, I think Ave
shall be starting this body under the AA r orst of all
auspices Avhen we should start it under the very best.
It might be that the senate representing states, and
each senator having, presumably, the confidence of
his state, might find itself in conflict with the repre-
sentatives who Avill represent the federation as a
whole, and that the strain which Avould be brought
to bear on the senate from that vast Avhole
Avould be great enough in itself without our
subjecting the body in our very creation of it to
disadvantages which could only make its down-
ward course more hurried. In my opinion, Avhich
I express with all humility, our position ought
to be that at the start, Ave should endeavour to
conserve the senate as much as possible. It is the
protection of the liberty of the individual colonies—
it is the one representation in the federation Avhich
will secure to every one of the colonies its own
entity—and if we wish to bring about, not merely a
legislative, but also a friendly union—I'or, as has been
Avell said, the legislative can never exist unless there
is a strong friendly union to back it up —Ave must be
particularly careful that the body which represents
the individual colonies shall be one Avhich will be
respected in an equally high manner with the body
that more immediately represents the people. It Avas
suggested that such questions as customs might
fairly be taken away from the consideration of the
senate, except from their general power to block
legislation. If there is one question more than
another which appears to me to be properly a subject
for the consideration of the senate, it is this identical
question of customs, because there can be no
question in which the inequalities of the colonies
might be more plainly evidenced. And so it will be
with every matter if we, not seeing precisely how
the thing will work, remove by absolute legislation
from the control of the senate any part of the work
which has to be done by the whole body. I agree
entirely with Avhat the hon. member, Sir George
Grey, said about the matter before: make the
powers of the parliament as nearly co-ordinate as
you possibly can, and leave something to the evolution
of events. The strain on the senate will surely be
strong enough under any circumstances. The whole
body of the general public of Australia will be, in
many ways, for a while at all .events, contending
against them; and so far from surrounding them
with difficulties at the start, I think Ave ought to
place them on the very loftiest pedestal Ave can
possibly imagine. The question Avas discussed as to
the mode in which the senate should be elected. Per-
sonally, I agree entirely with the view that it Avould be
much better if the senators were elected by the elected
bodies, and I agree entirely with the hon. member,
Mr. Macrossan, that it Avould not be expedient for
us to enquire too closely into the precise method
Avhich each colony adopts in the appointment of its
own representatives, but rather, seeing that a colony
is satisfied to elect its representatives in a certain
Avay, to assume that the gentleman elected fairly
represents its opinions ; and if it should turn out
not to be so, each colony has in itself the poAver of
rectifying the difficulty. If the effect of a constitu-
tion of this kind would be to put a nominated
legislative council in a position Avhich Avas disadvan-
tageous to the colony which appointed it, we should
very soon have the matter remedied. I scarcely
think it is Avorth our while troubling about the matter
at the present time. At all eA r ents, as far as elec-
tion by the elected is concerned, we have a most
illustrious precedent, and we knoAV how satisfactorily
it has worked. I Avish to say a few Avords as to the
suggestion of my hon. friend, Sir John Bray, that
it should be competent for the senate to require any
money bill to be cut up into as many smaller bills as
they thought fit, so as to ensure the power of vetoing
in detail. I think it is better, on a great occasion of
this kind, to avoid any indirect way of doing that
which should be done directly. If we mean, in
fact, as that would do, to give the senate the poAver
of vetoing in detail as well as in the Avhole, it is
much better to say so than to resort to indirect
methods Avhich substantially mean the same thing,
and to bring into existence a much more elaborate
machinery in order to work the same result. That
is all I wish to say. If it is suggested that Ave should
proceed with the consideration of the other resolutions
before we have disposed of this resolution, I cer-
tainly would ask the Committee to support me in
disapproving of that. If, on the contrary, the Com-
mittee is willing, Avith or without further discussion,
but without coming to any decision, to send all the
resolutions to a select committee, I think then that
time Avould be saved, and I believe, with the disposi-
tion there is to-day to avoid all speeches of intimida-
tion and all threats of a speedy departure, Ave might
probably come to some conclusions that will be more
satisfactory than those produced by a continuation of
this discussion.
Sir HENRY" PARKES : I think the proposal made
by the hon. member who has just sat doAvn to send all
these resolutions to a committee at the present time, is
an extremely unreasonable suggestion. Ido not xvant
to allude to these resolutions, insomuch as they are
in mv own hands; but it is perfectly right that I
should remind the Convention that I have from the
first offered to give xvay to any other hon. member. I
in no way desired to insist upon submitting these
resolutions myself. I have stated that they might be


amended in any way whatever without any protest or
feeling of opposition on my part, so long as they more
correctly represent* the views of the Convention as
a basis for onr proceedings. My only object in sub-
mitting these resolutions was that there must be a
beginning, and it appeared to me —and it appears to me
now more firmly than ever it did—that the only way for
ns to proceed is to proceed on some basis laying down
general principles. My resolutions propose to do
that, subject to this : that I was ready at any moment
to give way to any other delegate, and after I had
submitted them, 1 was ready to have them amended
in any Avay. I hold that having entered upon them
so far, we are bound, as reasonable men, to finish
them in some form or other before we take any other
step. It will be remembered that towards the con-
clusion of my reply I suggested that the resolutions
might be dealt Avith in a very summary Avay, and that
avc should then try to decide upon what should bo
the vital principles of the federal bill. That seemed
to me a very reasonable course to take ; but the Con-
vention has thought othenvise. It has uoav expended
considerable time in dealing Avith these resolutions,
and the only rational course is for us to proceed to
the finish in dealing with them in some form or other,
so that they will best express the general feeling of
the Convention. Noav, with regard to the point at
Avhich avc haA r e been so long at a halt, unable to come
to any conclusion, I feel —and it is a time when we
must express our individual opinions, always bearing
in mind that we are content to be beaten, if Ave are to
be beaten, and to do the best we can under defeat—
I regard some of the Auews propounded by hon.
gentlemen opposite to me as simply monstrous, and
I maintain that neither the hon. member, Dr. Cock-
burn, nor the hon. member, Mr. Gordon, as far as I
can see, have ever yet risen to the federal atmosphere.
They are provincial in all the views they have
explained. The only thing they see is their oavh
colony, and the hon. member, Mr, Gordon, confesses
at once that he is in favour of a loose confederation
in these colonies.
Mr. Gordon : Hear, hear.
Sir HENRY PARKES : If that Avere the end
Avhich this Convention were aiming at, I should at
once retire, because I should think that would be
plunging out of a sound condition of things into a
very unsound condition of things indeed. I state at
once Avhat I have stated from the very first, in every
utterance I have made, that my object is the union
of Australia —the uniting of Australia into one
great power, and I should think it a calamity upon
these colonies to go from their present inde-
pendent sovereignties into a loose confederation. I
should consider it, so far from an advance, a retro-
grade step. I should consider it adisasterthan Avhich
hardly anything could be greater. Surely New
South Wales has shown a generous front in all these
proceedings. We have said from the first that we
made no stipulations —from the very first, strong as
our feelings are on many questions, we have stated
■—not only have I stated, but my hon. friend, Mr.
Barton, has stated in my hearing—that we made no
stipulations—that Ave placed the federation of the
colonies above eA T ery other consideration. I do not
think I misrepresent the hon. member, Mr. Barton,
Avhen I say that we place federation above the fiscal
question.
Mr. Barton : Certainly !
Sir HENRY PARKES : I am glad to hear that
response, because upon the fiscal question the hon.
member, Mr. Barton, and I belong to opposite camps.
I was quite sure I correctly interpreted the hon. mem-
ber when I said that we, he and myself, and others
Avho believe Avith him, and who believe with me, have
placed the question of federation above all other
questions. The fiscal question Ave have never thought
of as any ground of bargaining, and I myself have
stated repeatedly that I would not condescend to
bargain on any subject whatever, that my only object
Avas so see the colonies united under aAvell constructed
executive and parliament, and that I Avas quite con-
tent to leave the fortunes of Australia to the men Ayho,
under the federal system, would find their way into
the federal parliament. And I say that lIOAV. But it
is very difficult for persons Avho take this vieAV, who do
not look at their OAATI colony at all except so far as to
protect it from aggression, Avho look at Australia as a
Avhole —it is very difficult, I say for them to deal with
gentlemen Avhose eyes are constantly fixed upon
their OAVII spot on the continent.
Sir THOMAS MCILAVRAITII : Hear, hear!
Sir HENRY PARKES : It is very difficult for us
to deal with gentlemen Avho see the question only
through the interests of the part of the continent
they themselves represent.
Sir THOMAS MCJLWRAITII : Hear, hear !
Sir HENRY PARKES : Now unless Ave can rise
to the position of Australians, taking Australia as
our country, taking the whole Australian people as
one people, and seek to create a government for those
people without reference to New South Wales, or
A'ictoria, or Western Australia, or South Australia —
unless Ave can do that, Ave, the men assembled here,
are not ripe for federation. Wo may fail; but the
cause of federation will not fail. Y"ou may rest as-
sured that, whether Ave agree or not, those Avho come
after us Avith close steps will agree. The circumstances
of these various independent communities are so
pressing, they will become day by day so much more
pressing, that there is no force that can keep back
this cause of union in Australia. This Convention
may have its day and pass away and do nothing; but
some other body will come in its footsteps, and do
Avhat we have not had the Avisdom and prescience and
the patriotism to do. Now, what ought we to try to
construct here ? We ought to try to construct the
very best form of free government, without reference
to any other consideration whatever.
HON. MEMBERS : Hear, hear !
Sir HENRY PARKES : We all agree Avith that
general proposition ; but I am going to ask what that
best form of free government is ? I put the first
question with a vieAV to its being ansAvered by the
gentlemen around me. lam going to ask lIOAV what
the best form is ? I utterly distrust paper constitu-
tions. I, for one, with the'world's experience before
me, utterly distrust the constitution that is
framed in the closet, that is framed with the lamp,
or that is framed upon some theory or some mosaic
made up of several theories. And I distrust it for
this very reason —that the government of men is a
practical business, like every business in the highly
organised state of human aftairs in these days, which
must, to a very large extent, be subject to the
obvious dictates of common-sense. If, then, we are
to construct a government which is likely to give
satisfaction, and likely to endure, we ought to take
the lamp of experience. Now, the lamp of experi-
ence held out clearly to us is held out by England,
and by no other country. The light AVO get from
other countries is the light of warning. The light Aye
get from even Switzerland is a light that will not, in
any Avay, enable us to go on our Avay. We must try
to fit our constitution to the habits of thought, to
the habits of life, to the customs to which those
habits have been trained, and to the very prejudices
of the people for whom Ave are trying to build it.
Well, all we know of England, of English govern-
ment, is that though there is an upper chamber in
the old laud, more illustrious, not simply from its
rank, and from its great ability and its great learning,
but from its great services to the state—though
there is in England an upper chamber infinitely
superior to any of the same character of Avhich we
knoAv anywhere else, and I do not make an exception
of the Senate of the United States, because in the
House of Lords no peer, no illustrious statesman


was ever stealthily approached with an intention to
beat out his brains; but they had the Charles
Sumner incident in that great Senate o£ the United
States of which hon. members have talked so much—
I say, that notwithstanding the illustrious character
of this great senate, the House of Peers, which holds
a body of men at this day who have no superiors on
the face of the earth as a governing body —notwith-
standing all that, English genius and English states-
manship have said that the power of inflicting
burdens upon the people and the expenditure of the
people’s money shall reside exclusively in the House
of Commons.
Mr, Eysh : Taxation and representation!
Sir John Downeb : It amounts to this—that the
powers to which the hon. member refers shall not lie
in the king without the consent of the Commons !
Sir HENRY PARKES: That really is an explan-
ation worthy of the argument —and I say it with all
respect —which the hon. member has pursued. Prac-
tically and really this power resides in the hands of
the Commons of England. And I say that we shall
make a very great mistake if we do not preserve that
form of free government in the best way in which
we can preserve it. We may not be able to preserve
it. Certainly, we cannot reproduce it. Of course,
I admit, as every man must admit, that we cannot
reproduce it in what we now create. But we can
try to create something that will represent that great
governing body, which I fearlessly say is the most
distinguished debating body which the world has
ever seen,
Mr. Adte Douglas : It has no governing power
whatever. The whole governing power rests with
the House of Commons !
Sir HENRY PARKES: That is exactly what I
have said.
Mr. Adye Douglas : I understood that the hon.
member was alluding to the House of Lords !
Sir HENRY PARKES: I had left that two or
three hours ago. I am speaking of the House of
Commons. I do not want to draw comparisons
between the nation to which we belong and other
nations. France has had her great men and Italy
has had her great men in the shape of patriotic
statesmen, and so have many of the other nations
of Europe; but there is no nation which has had so
grand a succession of statesmen fitted to deal with
the affairs of men as England has. For centuries —•
certainly from the time of John Pym down to the
time of Mr. Gladstone —we have had a succession of
giant intellects engaged in the government of Eng-
land. Those giants have one and all stood by the
power of the Commons House of Parliament; and it
is by their continuous, never-dying, and never-
wearying efforts that we have got to the condition
that we now have. Well, we seek—those who think
as I do —to reproduce here, as nearly as we can, the
British Constitution. We want no other. We say
it is sufficient for our purpose, and that having this
in the broad light of day, with a familiarity with all
its features, we do not need to seek some other form,
or some patchwork of forms, which will be to a large
extent an experiment. What do we seek to do ?
We seek to create a pattern of the House of Com-
mons. We call it the house of representatives; and
to this, so far as I know, no hon. member has made
an objection. I have not heard a single objection
to this creation. What do we do next? Being
resolved upon creating a double house of legislature,
we seek to constitute an upper chamber, which we
want to make as different in its constituent elements
as we can in a community so level in its democratic
tendencies as the community of these colonics. AUe,
therefore, give the go-by, if I may use a vulgarism,
to the representative principle, and offer to the states,
without regard to their age, to their population, or to
anything else, an equal representation in the senate.
As I voluntarily wrote those words, I know that my act
was a very voluntary one —to offer to the smaller states
just the same, representation as that which the states
of New South Wales would possess. I offered volun-
tarily, as far as I was individually concerned, an
equal representation to Western Australia as either
Victoria or New South Wales would have in the
senate. But I stipulated that that power which is
held by the House of Commons should be held by
the house of representatives —that is in as effective
a way as the words of a written resolution could
prescribe. But gentlemen opposite, not content with
the smaller states having an equal power in the senate
with the larger states, say that they should have
an equal power in the senate to deal with what
are known as money bills. I waited to see
whether any hon. member would say they did not
contend for that, because they allowed the represen-
tative house to initiate all money bills. It seems to
me that if there is any real value in the principle con-
tended for by Sir John Downer and his friends, of
allowing the senate to alter, or, to use their words,
to veto in the whole or in detail, money bills —if
there is any.value in that principle which asserts the
co-ordinate power of the two chambers, they ought
to have gone to the root of it, and given the senate
the power of originating money bills also.
Sir Thomas Mcllwkaith : We have no objection
to take that, too!
Sir HENRY PARKES: If the hon. member will
allow me to say it, in a political or Pickwickian sense,
I do not think that he would object to take anything.
If the senate ought to have this power —and the
power which Sir John Downer claims is virtually as
complete a power as the house of representatives
would have, and I do not think he would disguise
that that is what he wishes—if we are to give this
power to the senate, why not let it originate money
bills also ? We have no doubt come to a rock on
which we may possibly —I hope not —split. I trust
we shall not, but we may. We have come to this
rock where the claim is that the senate, not repre-
senting the people of Australasia as the house of
representatives would, but representing alike the large
states and the small, should have equal power in
dealing with money bills with the house consisting of
the direct representatives of the people. Now, I
venture to lay down —of course in doing so it is only
the result of my own thought, my own convictions,
and my own attempts to get light —that in a free,
successful government there cannot be two houses to
deal with bills of that character. That is my con-
viction.
Mr. Munbo : Hear, hear : there cannot be !
Sir HENRY PARKES :' That bit of wordplay in
saying that finance is government and government is
finance, wherever it may have arisen, can mean
nothing. Some of the gentlemen, who have argued
on the other side of this question —the hon. member,
Mr. Macrossan, for instance —have stated with great
force that questions of finance will be as nothing to
the great social and labour questions which will have
to be decided in these Australian parliaments ; and
I at once admit that there are very many questions
indeed of far more consequence to the people of
these communities than the question of imposing a
tax in a particular form, or the question of appropri-
ating the revenue derived from that tax to particular
purposes. I admit that freely ; but that does not
seem to me to touch the real question at stake. We
give to the senate all the power of equality in dealing
with these questions, which are said to be of more
importance than money questions. If there do arise
from this social upheaval questions of infinitely
greater magnitude than any questions affecting levy-
ing of a tax or the expenditure of the money, we
give freely to the senate the fullest power to deal
with those questions. Why do we hesitate to give
to them the same power in dealing with what are
somewhat erroneously termed money bills ? Because


all taxes levied must be burdens on the people of the
country. The freest condition would he to have no
tax; and every tax, let it take what form it may, is
a burden upon a free people. Every expenditure
derived from the revenues produced by these taxes
must affect the people of the country in the very same
way in which the imposition of burdens affect them.
Our ground of principle is that the chamber elected
directly by the people, by the taxpayers of the do-
minion country, the whole of Australia, shall alone
be entitled to deal with these exceptional measures,
which require the assent of both houses, affecting the
imposition of burdens and the distribution of the
revenue derived from the taxes so imposed. In con-
sidering how this power, which is so glibly—l do not
withdraw the word nor qualify it—claimed for this
council of the states —the very name devised for it
shows it is not the council of the people, and that
the very power claimed for that body is not at all con-
sistent with what we really have to do—it is claimed
that this body shall have the power to veto—l think
these are the words—in the whole or in detail any
bill introduced for the purpose of expending money—■
because, under any definition, however close, I suppose
that would be considered a money bill—or for in-
creasing the burdens of the state. Now, I will give
you one instance of how this provision might act if it
were conceded to the senate. New South Wales, as
I had occasion to mention the other day, has about
700 miles of coast; Victoria has about 600 miles of
coast; Queensland has something like 2,500 miles of
coast; South Australia, including the Northern Terri-
tory, has about 2,000 miles of coast, or about 1,100
miles without the Northern Territory. Western Aus-
tralia, with its 45,000 people, has 3,000 miles of coast.
It might be that Victoria would require an expenditure
reasonably necessary in her case for the protection of
her commerce and of her dense population on that
short stretch of coast; but it might be that Western
Australia, with her 3,000 miles of coast-line, and South
Australia, with her 2,000 miles of coast-line, might
cabal together, which would be very easily effected in
the senate, and refuse any bill, unless a similar expendi-
ture in proportion was carried out in those colonies.
I have seen much more unreasonable things than that,
I have seen much more unreasonable cabals than that,
even in the Imperial Parliament, and certainly much
more unreasonable cabals than that in the Congress
of the United States ; and knowing what human nature
is, nothing would be more likely than some egregious
attempt at downright injustice being inflicted by the
power of the smaller colonies. I, for one, am anxious
—and I think there is an evidence of that in my
voluntary proposal to give the smallest colony the same
representation as that of this great colony in the senate
-—to extend every consideration whatever to the smaller
colonies; but we cannot extend a consideration to the
smaller colonies which involves a state of things which
may result so unjustly, so disastrously, to the whole
of the colonies who have done their share in the civil-
isation of this part of the world. It is then, because
I believe'that it is absolutely necessary for the effective
government of any state under parliamentary govern-
ment that the power of dealing with all measures of
this character —measures for imposing taxation and
expending revenue —should be left to one authority,
and one alone, that I oppose the amendment of the hon.
member, Sir John Downer. I do not believe that a
constitution embodying that principle could be by any
possibility adopted by the people of this country. It
is scarcely likely that the great population of New
South Wales and Victoria, accustomed to jealously
watch every position of freedom they have, would con-
sent to the adoption of a constitution which placed
them at the mercy of a cabal of the weaker and less
important colonies. What is our position 1 As far
as I know the people of New South Wales, and I
think I know them as well as my colleagues do, our
position is that we are ready to enter into this union ;
we are ready to enter into it without making any con-
dition ; but we are not ready to enter into it on any
basis of principles which are inconsistent with the
British Constitution, which we hold ought to be trans-
planted into this new dominion. I shall be very glad
indeed if by any explanation, or any legitimate com-
promise, we can come to an agreement; but I have
seen all along, zealous as I have been to bring about
the union of the Australian colonies, the possibility of
failure ; and the causes of failure were pretty clearly
seen by me, too, before this Convention met. All I
desire to say now in conclusion is this : that, dear as
the cause of union is to me, and to those who think
with me, anxious as we are to give to the Australian
people a oneness of action, a collectiveness of effort,
and an unmistakable national identity in character \
anxious as we are for that, there are to us some things
dearei’. We cannot, and so far as lam concerned we
will not, be tacked to any confederation of states who
will not meet us with the same just views as we take
of their condition. We are willing to make any pos-
sible surrender that is defensible ; we are willing to
enter into this federation without stipulating for one
single condition. As far as lam concerned, Ido not
even venture to say what will be the fiscal policy of the
dominion parliament; but I have said at all times
that whatever it may be, while I shall not give up my
own opinions, I shall, as a patriot, bow to its decision.
1 have never attempted to force my opinions upon this
Convention, or upon any body which 1 have addressed,
except in the light in which I now express them \ but
I, for one, will never consent for New South Wales to
be linked to a federation of states, unless the object is
to make the Australian people a nation, under one
broad federal government, modelled on the plan of the
British Constitution.
Mr. GORDON ; I should not have troubled the
Convention with any remarks this afternoon, had it
not been that the mover of these resolutions, in coming
to the defence of them as against the criticisms which
which have been directed against them, has done me—
shall I call it the honor I— to somewhat pointedly refer
to the small contribution which I made towards this
debate. He accuses myself and another hon. member
of this Convention first of all of being provincial.
Well, I am prepared to plead somewhat guilty to the
accusation. I admit that the sweep of my mind does
not enable me, as does that of the hon, delegate, to
take under its wings her Majesty the Queen, the
House of Lords, and the British Constitution. I come
from the small colony of South Australia, and my
interests are somewhat centred there, because I love
better the things I have seen than the things I have
not seen. I plead somewhat guilty to the charge of
being provincial, because, when the thing is boiled
down in the crucible of common-sense, this is merely
a commercial treaty which we are considering. We
are not here only to raise a national standard, bnt to
enter into a bargain, colony with colony, on terms
which we think advantageous to each, I am here
to promote federation, but also to see that the terms
on which the colony of which I am a humble repre-
sentative is asked to come into the federation are
advantageous to her interests. But when my views
are stigmatised as monstrous, with very much respect,
I protest—and with the greatest respect, owing to
the distinguished position which the hon. the Presi-
dent occupies, not only here, but also throughout the
colonies—l protest that these are not terms, although
directed against the humblest member of the Conven-
tion, which will tend to promote the spirit in which
we are supposed to meet, I wish to make every
allowance for the evident physical disability under
which the hon, member labours and the irritation
which must result from it—and he has no greater
admirer than myself—but seeing that my position has
been stigmatised as monstrous by the hon. gentleman,


I beg leave in a very few words to support my views.
I shall not keep the Convention more than five
minutes. Yesterday, I advocated a definite arrange-
ment which undoubtedly implied a looser federation
than that contemplated by the resolution. I admit
it, but I was not prepared to let that view stand in
the way of any view which the Convention might
choose to take. But surely I have the right to con-
tribute my small jot to the considerations of the
Convention. But, if it comes to that, I willingly
plead guilty to the charge that I do favour a looser
confederation, and in a few words, I will say why. I
am not blind to the commercial advantages which
federation will bring to this great country. They are
patent; but I do not calculate the happiness of a coun-
try, or view its welfare, entirely through financial
spectacles. There are many reforms which to be
effected at all must be general, and which can be
easily accomplished in small communities, but which
are exceedingly difficult to bring about in large com-
munities. Federation of the kind contemplated by
the resolution means centralisation, and centralisa-
tion tends to maintain the statu quo, and retards social
reform. The hon, member has challenged the repre-
sentatives of the smaller colonies in this group with
the importance and dignity of New South Wales,
and with the sacrifice she is making in joining the
smaller colonies—but let us have a word upon that.
I admit that New South Wales is very much more
wealthy, and is greater than the other colonies.
Mr. Munro ; It is not more wealthy than Victoria !
Mr, GORDON : Well, we will place New South
Wales in juxtaposition to the little colony of South
Australia. It is greater, wealthier, and more important
than South Australia, and has moreover the hon. the
President as its Premier. But there are many points
in which South Australia is immensely superior to New
South Wales. In point of social reform and legal
reform—in the law courts and in legal statutes they
are a hundred years behind South Australia, and the
only point in which they are up to South Australia in
this respect is in the statute which they copied from us
•—the Land Transfer Act. And, coming to the question
of local government, the whole of New South Wales,
with respect to her improvements and public works, is
managed froiti a central office here in Sydney. They
are behind even the mother country, England, in that,
and years behind every other colony in the group ; so
that if we joined New South Wales, with all her wealth,
her importance, and her Premier, we should have a
vast mass of inertia to bring along with the little colony
of South Australia. And I do not know that our
advancement in legal and social reform does not
counterbalance the wealth, the importance, and the
Premier of the older colony. 1 admit that in-addition
to commercial advantages there is something to be said
for the additional grandeur which the Australian flag
will derive from federation, and the additional theatres
of distinction and of action which the talented repre-
sentatives of these colonies will have in which to figure;
but the mass of our people are much too busy in getting
their daily bread to have the time or ambition for such
distraction. I do not desire to see what the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. Deakin, in the brilliant address which he gave
us, pictured, a government as strong as a fortress and
as sacred as a shrine —that is, a great central power
dwarfing all others. Rather than have a government
like a fortress, beneath whose frowning walls the people
must either remain or go unsheltered to the wilderness,
I would have a tent which they might carry with them
in their march of progress; and rather than have a
government as sacred as a shrine, guarded by jealous
priests, I would have an open door through which the
people might come and go without fear-and without
superstition.
Sir GEORGE GREY : I confess that it is with
feelings of sorrow that I have heard the deeds of the
British nation at large so thoroughly undervalued for
the purpose of the glorification of one or two bodies in
Great Britain. Any one who reflects upon what the
British people have achieved under great difficulties in
past years, with no fair chance afforded to emerge from
them, will say that we deserve a better character than
was given to us. Why, we w r ere told that nothing had
taken place in Great Britain which could be compared
with the Sumner affair in the United States; but I
say that no greater scandal has ever fallen upon any
deliberative body than the dragging out of a represen-
tative of the British people from the House of Commons
across Palace Yard, upon his back through the mud,
because he had tried to take an oath which subsequently
all admitted ought never to have been required from
him, and of which he ought to have been relieved. But
why should these things be raked up against the British
race 1 ? Why should they not be allowed to slumber?
I contend that the patience and the endurance of the
people of Australia have been perfectly wonderful, and
they deserve that the great reward of freedom should
now be given to them. Have they in any one of the
colonies had in past years the freedom of British
subjects ?
Mr. Munro : Yes; every one of them 1
Sir GEOBGE GREY; What, with nominated
councils ?
Mr. Mukro : There are no nominated councils !,
Sir GEORGE GBEY : No nominated councils!
There are three in Australia at the present day. How
can the hon. gentleman deny that ?
Mr. Muxro ; We have none in Victoria !
Sir GEORGE GREY ; Is Victoria all Australia?
Is that an answ'er to what I have said ? If the people
of Victoria have not a nominated council, have they
not plural voting to an extraordinary degree, which
shuts out the poor from all chance of competition at
the elections?
Mr. Munro : We have plural voting, certainly !
Mr. Cutiibert : But to a very limited extent !
Mr. Munro : We are going to abolish it altogether !
Sir GEORGE GREY : Going to abolish it! Why ?
Because the tempest thunders at your doors. That is
the fact. Such is the progress made in the human
mind at the present day that these things can no longer
continue. But have you proposed to do it in the reso-
lutions which have been laid before this Convention ?
No proposal at all is here made to secure the liberties
of the people at large, as should have been made in the
first instance. I contend that any one who reflects upon
the great colonies which have been founded by the British
people, upon the wars in which they have been engaged,
upon the number of soldiers who have laid down their
lives, and the number of sailors who have done the same
in every part of the world, and who obtained little or
no reward for it, upon the number of explorers who
have risked their lives and have got no great grants of
land in return—l say that the sufferings that have
been undergone to make these colonies, the deeds that
have been performed by the people who have created
them, deserve a better return than has been given to
them to-day. I contend that, here, we are empowered
to give a great gift to the people of Australasia. That
gift is placed in our hands to offer to them, to solicit them
to take; and I say that squabbles of the kind that have
taken place upon this question ought not to divert us
from that great object. The matter, I think, is really
little understood by the Convention. Rothing could
be kinder than the proposal that was made for a settle-
ment of this difficulty, namely, that if the two branches
of the legislature could not agree upon a bill, and if
the bill were twice passed by one of them, an appeal
should be made to the people. But that ought to be
unnecessary, because the body created by you, if they
desire that law, could make it themselves. These are
not the points to which we should direct our attention.
Our attention is, I think, dropping, to a great degree,
from the consideration of the resolutions as they stand.


Our proper duty is to commence to lay the foundation
of the edifice we are to build up ; to do, as has been
done in other countries, other great federal communi-
ties—to begin with the lower stratum, and to see that
the states have power given to them to make their
own laws exactly as they like, to frame their own
state constitution exactly as they please, and to vary it
from time to time. When we have provided for that,
we should proceed to the consideration of the federal
parliament, and nothing will be easier than its construc-
tion. I ask hon. gentlemen, however, in trying to work
this out, to dismiss from their minds all idea of the in-
capacity of the British race in these colonies to deter-
mine for themselves what their constitution shall be.
There are men in these colonies who have gone through
great difficulties, many of whom have travelled into other
countries, many of whom have come from or through
the United States, and have seen other forms of govern-
ment than ours; and I ask them to trust to the people to
adopt a form of govei'nment for themselves, to give them
that greatest and best boon which can be given to men,
and to leave to those who have worked out what are
the capabilities of these countries, what is the best
form of settling them, in what way they can be best
occupied—to leave to those persons, with all this ex-
perience, the power of doing that which the great nation
of Britain authorises us to confer upon them. And
whilst they dismiss from their minds all idea that any
one of us has contemplated throwing blame upon the
British Parliament, what hon. member in this Conven-
tion will complain that there is any want in the House
of Peers of goodness or capacity or any other quality,
that they should be extolled in this way above our-
selves ? Which one of us complained of the conduct of
the House of Commons, so as in any way to necessitate
the declaration that we were not equally competent with
the members of the House of Commons to determine
what should be done 1 I say that rather the subject-
matter of our addresses should be to admit what has
been done great and good in this country; and having
done that to stir the people up to go on in the line of
goodness, the line of greatness, and to form this great
confederation; and having formed it, they will call into
existence virtues now almost unknown, of patriotism,
of desire to serve the country ; will call out a class of
men who really can confer great benefits upon it; and
that they can do if they please within a week from this
time. Leaving aside all quarrels upon minor details,
let us take any one of the federal constitutions which
are in existence, and, without attempting in any way
to servilely follow it, let us trace out in how far the
lines of that constitution are applicable to this country,
and upon any one of the existing constitutions we may
build up a new one, fitted to make Australia a great
nation, and we may leave the result to be sent to the
different states, to be considered there. I believe that
in every instance, if founded upon true principles of
freedom, it would be adopted with shouts of applause,
with great thanksgiving, with gratitude from all hearts ;
and all this might be done in a week or ten days from
this time. I earnestly ask that Ave should be allowed
to get on with the resolutions, if they are to be per-
sisted in, with the least possible delay, and having done
that, let the other resolutions be put. When that has
been done, let the draftsman be empowered to draft
the system of federation which we choose to recom-
mend. That is what I earnestly desire to see done. I
confess it is with sorrow that I have found that we have
been compelled to hurry on this matter, to speak with
greater heat than perhaps Avas necessary ; but I think
that no man who really loved his fellow-men—Avho for
years had been a companion with them in their diffi-
culties of every possible kind—-could sit patiently and
hear so far undervalued Avhat they had done, and the
merits of a distant country so greatly extolled as far
surpassing everything of our OAvn that we can produce
or show, without feeling a mortification in his heart
which it was difficult for him not to express. I have
mourned over the number of explorers who have died,
I have mourned over the lack of rewards given to those
who have survived. I have seen my friend, Sturt, die
almost neglected and unrewarded. I have seen others
in the same state ; no loud plaudits have gone forth to
recognise what they have done. I have seen great
statesmen amongst you, and I have seen few of them
obtain rewards. Of necessity, from having command
of small parties, I have known men in humble life, and
have seen perfect heroes amongst those who were really
working men in the colonies; but I have never yet seen
fair openings given to men of that class, such has been
the nature of the institutions here; and what I have
hoped and desired, was that the time had now come
when justice at least would be done, when every avenue
would be opened to greatness and worth in every class
of life, when a constitution such as the world has not
yet seen, would be given to a free people ; and when I
heard the language to-day, and began to think that there
really was some conception coming upon the minds of
hon. members that the Convention might be broken up,
and that nothing should be done, then the heart began
to sink, and the hopes that seemed so near realisation
appeared to be fading away. But I still hope and trust
that we will persist in the task given to us, and, from
what the last speaker said, I believe that he and others
will rise superior to the difficulties surrounding us, and
help to complete the great work for which the whole of
Australasia are looking, and upon which I believe the
eyes of the whole civilised world at the present moment
are fixed. Let us not disappoint them. Let us show
ourselves worthy of the duty we are called upon to
perform, and blessings will for ever follow the men
who helped in that consummation.
Mr. McMILLAN ; I think it will be agreed by
most hon. members that we have gone as far with
this important subject—the most important of our
deliberations—as general discussion can bring us.
We have already had the resolution of the Hon. Sir
Henry Parkes excised and amended so that it reads,
“ the sole power of originating all bills appropriating
revenue or imposing taxation.” That lays down a
very important principle; but it commits us to nothing
more, and it does not prevent us from putting in more
when we go into Committee. I should, with all
respect, propose to my hon. friend, Sir John Downer,
and to the hon. member, Mr. Wrixon, that they both
withdraw their amendments, and that we pass this
resolution with the one amendment or excision that has
been made, and then, when we go into Committee—
either into one committee or into separate committees
—say, a separate committee dealing with this financial
matter—we may be able to crystallise the general
opinion of the delegates, and to frame some kind of
phraseology that will meet with general approval,
because we have got very near one another. We have
got this far, that I think, generally, we agree that the
upper chamber should not interfere by way of amend-
ment with the appropriation bill for the ordinary
services of the year. Then when we come to that, the
question simply is, what outside that should be con-
sidered money bills, or whether all bills outside that
should be open to amendment; and here while lam
speaking I may as well say, as matter of my own
opinion, that this is a question involved not merely in
the matter of a state house for state rights, but that
it is involved, as far as my opinion is concerned, in
the whole principle of bicameral government. My
hon. friend, Mr. Wrixon, said that if the upper house
had the right contended for they would always exercise
it. Nothing of the kind follows. In the lower house
among ourselves when we have the estimates put
before us we do not debate more than one out of every
100 of the items; in fact, very often the debate on
the estimates is only on about half a dozen matters,
often trivial, but still of an important character, as
connected with the circumstances of the case.
Mr, Munrq ; Generally lasting very long !


Mr. McMILLAN : I should like to say before the
debate concludes that I cannot see where the power of
the lower house is so much contravened when the
upper house has the power to absolutely veto. Surely
when the veto takes place with regard to any great
measure of finance, it is only with regard to one or
two items in the whole ; and does it not seem absurd
to eliminate all the machinery by which any suggestion
whatever could come from the upper house with regard
to the particular matters to which they objected 1 But
these arguments have been put before the Committee,
and Ido not intend to take up its time. Ido not
want to introduce the ordinary debate of our houses
of parliament. I do not want to refer to any hon.
member, or to cast any aspersions; but I would now
suggest that it is only due to the lion, member, Sir
Henry Parkes, who placed these resolutions before the
Convention, that as far as we can, with certain verbal
amendments, so long as they carry out the main prin-
ciples upon which our bill will ultimately be framed,
we should pass them; and then I take for granted
that the committees will bring up a series of more
scientific resolutions which, as the hon. member, Sir
Henry Parkes, has said, will be the soul of the bill
itself. But it seems to me that we have now got as
far as general discussion can bring us on a very delicate
and intricate question, and it would be far better if
those hon. gentlemen would withdraw their amend-
ments, and if, with the excision which has already
been made, we pass this resolution, which still leaves
us open to the broadest possible compromise.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : If the discussion is to
close, I think it right before it closes, for my own part,
to express the very great regret I felt in hearing the
speech lately delivered by the President. We all meet
here, I believe, without exception, firmly determined
to do our best to establish a federal constitution, and
I think it is most unfortunate that either intentionally
or unintentionally anything should be said to tend to
disturb the good feeling which now exists amongst us.
The hon. member, Sir Henry Parkes, informed us, in
part of his speech, that the intention of these resolu-
tions was to establish in Australia something analogous
to the British Constitution. If that is so, of course all
the discussion which has taken place to-day and yes-
terday has been wasted. If we were going to repro-
duce the Bx-itish Constitution, with a house of commons
and a house of lords, it would be idle for us to talk
about the powers of the House of Lords or an upper
chamber; but I wish to point out, and lam sure that
the hon. member, Sir Henry Parkes, will agree—for
there is no one with a larger knowledge of constitu-
tional history or practice—that it is absolutely impos-
sible to reproduce the British Constitution in Australia.
The circumstances of the country will not permit of it.
The British Constitution is not a federal constitution.
It is quite different from a federal constitution ; so
that to attempt to do that is to attempt to make two
things work together which cannot work together.
What we have to do is to follow the British Constitu-
tion as nearly as its principles are applicable to a
federal constitution.
Sir Henry Parkes : That is absolutely all I ever
said !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I am sorry if I misun-
derstood the hon. gentleman, but certainly the greater
part of his speech led to that impression. It seemed
to me that if his arguments were carried out, it was
absolutely impossible to proceed
Sir Henry Parkes : I think it will be convenient
for me to explain, I have said in every speech 1 have
addressed to this Convention that it is impossible to
reproduce the British Constitution. I have said that
repeatedly, and it certainly is not my fault if the
Convention has not heard me. What I have said in
addition was that, so far as my individual opinion
went, I w’as seeking to follow on the lines of the
British Constitution, to work out the spirit of the
British Constitution, or words to that effect. But I
have never once been so foolish or so ignorant as to
announce to this body of eminent men that I thought
of reproducing the British Constitution. I hope my
hon. and learned friend will accept my explanation;
he must have heard me himself at different times.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH ; I am very glad indeed
that my few words have been the occasion of drawing
this explanation from the hon. member. But I am
sure that I was not alone this afternoon in understand-
ing the hon. member to maintain that the second
chamber proposed to be established in Australia should
be analogous in its functions to the House of Lords.
Sir Henry Parkes : To a large extent I said that;
but that is quite a different thing.!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : But the point is most
material when we are considei-ing the limitation of its
powers. I am quite sure the hon. member could not,
on further consideration, insist on such views as I
understood him to express. Perhaps I should apologise
to him for having misunderstood him. Just one obser-
vation I should like to make now. It has been very
often suggested that the proposal advocated by many
hon. members will not work; that it is impossible that
it can work ; that it is impossible to allow a second
chamber to have any voice in financial matters. That
argument, if I may be permitted to say so with great
respect, reminds me of the argument addressed to Mr.
George Stephenson when he was inventing the steam
engine—that it was impossible that the thing could
■work. It was demonstrated by all the scientific men
that in the nature of things an engine could not go at
the rate of 10 miles an hour. Well, we are not merely
putting the opinions of persons who are trying a new
experiment against those of others of greater experi-
ence ; but we have the experience on our side : we can
point to 100 years, at least, where such a machine has
been working—working all over the world —and is
working at the present time. I think we have only
to see what is the best way of meeting the differences
that are at present between us. These are not very
many. I am quite satisfied that, with two or three
exceptions—and I doubt whether there are so many—•
the differences between us will come down to an ex-
tremely small point—almost to a vanishing point; and,
that being so, I think it would be unfortunate if any
interruption were to take place in the amicable rela-
tions which we have hitherto maintained towards each
other.
. Sir JOHN BRAY: It seems to me that we have
had some very entertaining speeches to-day, some of
which, if we had unlimited time at our disposal, we
should no doubt have listened to with great pleasure;
but I am afraid that they have not advanced our busi-
ness as speedily as we could wish. I agree with those
who say that we must sooner or later refer all details
to a committee. Although, no doubt, the question we
are now discussing is an extremely important one, yet,
I think, I may fairly put it to the hon. member, Sir
John Downer, on the one hand, who has made one set
of propositions, and to the hon. member, Mr, Wrixon,
on the other hand, that it is absolutely impossible to
come to any fair decision on the question, which will
not cause very great irritation in this Convention. It
is absolutely certain, I think, in the minds of all of us
who look fairly at the matter, and who desire to speed
our business, that some sort of compromise must be
suggested. I believe it is equally certain in the minds
of those who have given their attention to the matter,
that we are not prepared without the report of a com-
mittee, or without very full consideration, to describe
exactly the terms on which the differences can be ad-
justed. I would ask both those hon. members to with-
draw, for the present, their amendments, not only on
the understanding, but with the knowledge that, as the
resolution at present stands, it commends itself to all
of us, We hs,ve struck out the words in the last line


“ and amending ” so that we provide that the lower
house or the house of representatives shall
possess the sole power of originating all bills appropriating
revenue or imposing taxation.
Of course, we have not absolutely passed those words ;
but still, I think, we are all agreed that what we may
call the lower house shall have the sole power of
originating those bills. I think it is equally certain
that none of us are prepared to absolutely stop there.
On the one hand, some say that we ought distinctly
to provide that the senate or upper home shall have
the power of vetoing in the whole, or amending in
detail all money bills, perhaps, without exception;
while others contend, as the hon. member, Mr. Wrixon,
does, that money bills should not be amended by the
senate. I say that we ought to stop at the point
where we have agreed, with the view of seeing whether
a committee can frame a basis on which we can ulti-
mately agree with respect to the other stages of money
bills. We have all agreed that the lower house shall
originate those bills. Although there may be a majority
one way or the other, it would be by force, and not by
argument, that they would be satisfied if we attempted
to take a division to-night. I would ask both my hon.
friends to withdraw their amendments for the present.
Sir John Downer : And what then?
Sir JOHN BRAY : We are quite content to refer
the resolution as it stands to a committee; but I under-
stand that my hon. friend wants to refer the Ist and
3rd resolutions also to a committee. There is not the
least doubt in a single mind that they must go to a
committee sooner or later.
Mr. McMillan : They must all go to a committee !
Sir JOHN BRAY : It will be most convenient, per-
haps, for us to have a general discussion on the 3rd
resolution before it goes to a committee than after-
wards, so that the committee may have something to
guide them. Ido not suppose for a moment that the
committee can frame resolutions that will meet the
wishes of all of us ; but from this discussion they will
gather a general notion as to what is likely to be
acceptable to the greater number of the delegates, i
intended to suggest that we should say “the two houses
respectively shall have, such other powers in reference
to money bills as may be hereafter agreed upon ” ; but
of course if we do not put in those words the same
idea will really be conveyed. By leaving the resolution
as it stands, neither on one side, nor on the other, will
it be assumed that we have said all we have to say in
regard to money bills? What we have said we have
said definitely : that the lower house shall have power
to originate ; but we all admit that there is more to
be said than that. In the present state of things in
the Convention it is absolutely impossible to get any-
thing like a unanimous decision on the question. We
all want, if possible, to get something like a unanimous
decision. It is no use here, as it would be in an ordi-
nary parliament, to attempt to pass anything by a bare
majority. We feel that the best thing we can do is to
thrash the whole thing out, and see if, after all, there
is not some possible course to be adopted that will, if
not please, at least satisfy, the members of the Conven-
tion generally. Ido trust, therefore, that both hon.
members will be disposed to let the matter stand
where it is, as far as this resolution is concerned, on the
distinct understanding that it will have to be subse-
quently dealt with by a committee, who will elaborate
some scheme—perhaps one of the schemes suggested
by the hon. members, perhaps some other scheme—
which will effectually carry out the wishes of the dele-
gates present at the Convention.
Sir JOHN DOWNER: When I suggested just now
that these resolutions should be at once sent to a
committee, it was because I felt that it was quite im-
possible to consider the 3rd resolution until the Ist
resolution was disposed of; because I thought that to
put off the consideration of the relative powers to be
reposed in the two houses until we constituted the
executive was to put the cart before the horse, and to
create your tribunal without first defining its jurisdic-
tion. I have not altered my opinion on that subject,
and cannot bring myself to alterit in any shape or form,
and when I suggested that all these resolutions should
go to a committee at once —which the hon. member,
Sir Henry Parkes, said was unreasonable—l really
thought—and I tell the hon. gentleman so—that I
was rather acting in accordance Avith his views than in
antagonism to them. Certainly a conversation I had
with the hon. member, Mr. McMillan, led me to enter-
tain that view. I certainly have no wish or anxiety
to shelve a question which lias been so much con-
sidered. 1 am quite willing to fight the resolutions
out now, or to refer them all to a committee for con-
sideration, so that we may discuss them again when
the report is brought up. I still say that I feel just
as anxious as does my hon. friend, Sir John Bray, to
be as conciliatory as possible, and not to say one word
which would momentarily offend, or which, might
afterwards leave a sting in the mind of any one
present. I have great esteem for all who are here,
and my sole anxiety is to bring about the one result
we have been sent here to promote. I do, however,
ask members of the Committee to say whether they
do not think we ought to settle resolution No. 1 before
we settle resolution No. 3 ?
Sir John Bray : We shall not settle either until we
get a committee !
Sir JOHN DOWNER : Is it worth while to discuss
resolution No. 3 before we have settled resolution No,
1 ? Is it worth while to mix up the strong opinions,
the strong prejudices in the minds of all of us—pre-
judices which perhaps were born in us, and which have
become stronger through association and usage—is it
worth while to mix up this question of constitutional
government with a question of what shall be the relative
powers of the senate and the house of representatives ?
Mr. Munro : They naturally mix themselves up !
Sir JOHN DOWNER : Surely not.
Mr. Munro : They do indeed !
Sir JOHN DOWNER: I think they unnaturally
mix themselves up. What I am endeavouring to urge
is that they mix themselves up through no process of
reasoning, but entirely through prejudice.
Mr. Munro : No !
Sir JOHN DOWNER: They mix themselves up
because many of us, and perhaps most of us, are so
prejudiced in favour of the form of government to
which we have been so accustomed, that we are
unwilling to embark in any fresh venture at all. But,
first of all, surely we ought to say what the governing
body is to be; what, for instance, the senate is to be,
or whether we are to have two houses at all ?
Mr. Playford : We have said that!
Sir JOHN DOWNER: That being the case, the
next thing we have to determine is, what shall be the
powers of the two houses, jointly or differentially?
When we have settled the absolute and the relative
power of the two houses it will then be time to settle
what the executive is to be—the body which has to
carry out the wishes of the two houses,
Mr. Munro : That is the only way in which it can
be done !
Sir JOHN DOWNER: Perhaps having been
brought up in an arbitrary profession I am accus-
tomed to look at these matters from an arbitrary
point of view; but I cannot see any reason at all for
proceeding to resolution No. 3 until we have settled
resolution No. 1, because when we get to iNo. 3 we shall
have to consider the whole question as to whether we
are to have constitutional government or not, and to
discuss the question as to whether or not the new
federation is to be upon old lines, which, in my conten-
tion, are absolutely inapplicable—upon lines which Sir
Henry Parkes, and those who think with him, are of
opinion ought to be followed almost absolutely, or as
closely as possible, We cannot avoid mixing up the


executive with the ultimate authority, and we may
possibly sacrifice the liberties of the federation to some
prejudices existing in our minds and arising from past
association, from heredity, or from other causes. It
is from that point of view that I suggested at once—
and certainly I thought from what had been said to
me that it would meet the wishes of the mover of the
resolutions—that having discussed the matter to its
present stage, it would be expedient to send resolutions
1 and 3 to one committee, sending No. 2, which deals
with quite another matter, to another committee, and
in this way have all three resolutions considered
together. By that means, I thought, we might discover
whether an arrangement, in which we all expect to give
away something could not be arrived at. I still think,
in reference to the suggestion of the hon. member, Sir
John Bray, that it would be better, if we are going to
have this matter fought out in public, and settled by
voting on this floor, that we should settle resolution
No. 1, and afterwards settle No. 3, or agree to refer
both resolutions to a committee.
Sir John Bray ; Let us take a vote !
Sir JOHN DOWNER: Then I object.
Mr. Gordon : Strike out the latter part of No. 3 !
Sir JOHN DOWNER: If resolution No. 3 ended
with the words “ such persons sitting in parliament,”
no opinion would be expressed upon the point at
issue, and I should not have the slightest objection to
the resolution being agreed to in that form.
Mr. GILLIES: I have purposely refrained from
joining in the general debate, because I felt assured
from the sentiments which many of us have heard
expressed among hon. members that there was a
general desire that this question should, if possible,
before being finally determined by the Convention, be
discussed privately by a select committee. I do not
join in the opinion which has been expressed this
afternoon that things look rather black ; in fact, I am
inclined to think that they look very well indeed, and
the reason I form this opinion is this—that I have
spoken to scarcely an hon. member of the Convention
who has not expressed a strong desire and hope that
we may be able to come to some reasonable agreement
upon the difficulty which has arisen. I believe that
hope is greater this afternoon than it has been before.
We notice that as soon as there is a little storm the
atmosphere cools very readily, and the hope is generally
expressed all round that we shall do credit to the Con-
vention and to those who sent us here. I confess that
personally I should feel ashamed if I had to go back to
the colony of Victoria and confess that the gentlemen
who have met here for such an important purpose,
commissioned as they are by the parliaments of the
different colonies, have been compelled to separate
without being able to solve what is undoubtedly a
difficult question, but which certainly is not one that
is insoluble. I think we can pass the resolution that
we have been discussing as it stands; and taking the
view of the proposal made by the hon. member, Sir
John Bray, I have no doubt whatever that we shall
meet upon this point. I have heard so many sugges-
tions of amendments, many of them very reasonable
within themselves, that I have no doubt we shall be
able to adopt or modify some of them when hon.
members are in consultation. With regard to the
to her proposition referred to by the hon. member, Sir
John Downer, I believe the resolution can be so
amended as not to commit, the Committee to any
absolute or strongly expressed opinion which it might
afterwards see fit to alter, and that we might at the
same time enunciate the principle which is in reality
contained in the resolution. I hope we shall see our
way to pass the resolution under discussion on the
understanding that that and the 3rd resolution be
referred to a select committee, when we may be able
to ascertain whether it is not possible to come to a
satisfactory understanding upon the difficulty in the
minds of hon. members.
Mr. WRIXON ; I think the suggestion of the hon.
member, Sir John Bray, is a very good one, and if both
amendments are withdrawn for the present we shall be
in a position, after the report from the select commit-
tee, to discuss the question with better effect, and I
shall be very happy to fall in with the arrangement,
because I think it will lead to a peaceful solution of the
difficulty.
Sir JOHN DOWNER: If resolution No. 1 is to
stand as it is, and No. 3 is to go with the words to
which I have before referred struck out, so that we
shall not commit ourselves to any principle, I am quite
willing that the course proposed should be adopted.
That is what I wish to see done; and I would suggest
that some hon, member should move that the further
consideration of resolutions 1 and 2 be postponed.
Sir Samuel Griffith ; We must deal with No. 1 !
Sir JOHN DOWNER ; We may pass No. 1 on the
understanding to which I have referred ; postpone No.
2 ; and consider No. 3 simply with the view of putting
it in such a form as to leave the whole question open.
Mr, DEAKIN : I do not see any objection to that
course except one, which I should have thought might
have suggested itself to Sir John Downer, and this is
that those who desire to strike out the words in reso-
lution No. 3, referring to responsible government as we
now have it, will surely desire to ventilate their views,
or else the question will go to the committee without
any guidance whatever from the Convention. The
committee will be left with a perfectly free hand, it is
true ; but it might suggest itself to those hon. members
who do not approve of the proposal in resolution No.
3, but favour some other proposal, that it is incumbent
upon them to lay their alternative before the Conven-
tion as a whole, if they expect the committee to deal
with the subject in any way. Therefore, I would sug-
gest that we should pass resolution No. 1, and take No.
3 next.
Sir Henry Parkes : Why not finishthem all to night 1 ?
F Dr. Cock burn ; Because there will be a debate up on
resolution No. 2 !
Mr, Gillies : The words proposed to be omitted
from resolution No. 3 do not affect the question of con-
stitutional government or ministerial responsibility !
Mr. DEAKIN ; I am perfectly aware of that. What
I am pointing out is that if hon. members desire a com-
mittee to deal with the question involved in No. 3—to
put it plainly, to deal with the question as to whether
they will propose a constitution which shall have re-
sponsible government as its chief feature, or whether
they will, as some hon. members have expressly desired,
propose another kind of constitution which shall not
have responsible government as we know it for its chief
feature—we shall be placing the committee in an unfair
position unless the Convention, as a whole, first con-
siders the general issue. We may not come to a vote
upon it; but those hon. members who desire that some
change should be made in resolution No. 3 ought to
inform the Convention of the direction in which they
desire to go, in order that the question may be debated.
The matter is not one of importance to myself; but I
am pointing out that it is much better to do that than
to wait until the committee has come to a definite pro-
posal and then bring in an amendment which would
really mean the subversal of the whole of the proposals
of the committee in regard to responsible government.
Sir JOHN DOWNER : We have had a good deal
of reference to resolution No. 3, The subject has
been running through the whole discussion, and, in
fact, it would be strange were it not so; and I fancy
that the general views of the members of the Conven-
tion are sufficiently understood to enable us to send
the resolution to the committee without further dis-
cussion.
Mr. Deakin : Very good ; I am quite willing !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : If it is understood
that there is a general consensus of opinion, I should
like to know what the consensus is, if I am to be a


party to it? I understood the lion, member, Sir John
Downer, to say when he sat down that resolution No.
3 would be sent to the committee as it stood.
Sir John Downer : No, with certain words struck
out!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I agree with the lion,
member, Mr. Deakin, that the resolution ought to be
discussed here before it goes to the select committee.
Sir JOHN DOWNER : I am willing to withdraw
my amendment on the understanding that no decision
will be arrived at on resolution No. 3, except to strike
out the words already referred to.
Sir Henry Parkes ; What are you going to do
with resolution No. 2 ?
Sir JOHN DOWNER : I would suggest that it
should be postponed. I do not think that its dis-
cussion need take very long. The gentlemen who will
be appointed to the committee will probably like to be
present in the Convention when resolution No. 2 is
being dealt with.
The Chairman : Do I understand that the lion,
member wishes to withdraw his amendment ?
Sir JOHN DOWNER : I will not do so unless I
have a distinct understanding with the Convention.
I would ask the mover of the resolution whether, if I
withdraw my amendment, and the hon. member, Mr.
Wrixon, also withdraws his amendment, he will con-
sent that resolution No. 1 should be passsed ; that
No. 3 should simply be amended by the omission of
the words at the end to which reference has been
made, and that these two resolutions should be then
sent to the select committee without a vote being
taken.
Sir HENRY PARKES : I am by no means sure
that I understand what the hon. member asks. I. as
the mover of these resolutions, have no special power
over them, and the only thing I insist upon—and I
insist only as a matter of opinion—is that the whole
of the resolutions should be dealt with. If it had
been proposed at the outset to set them aside, I should
have assented. If it had been proposed to refer them
all to a committee, I should have assented. But as
the Convention has deliberately entered upon a course
of debate, I think that debate should extend over the
whole, and that all the resolutions should be dealt with
in some way or other. I shall be content if the Con-
vention thinks well to negative any of them. I have
said, times out of number, that I throw these resolu-
tions, as it were, before the Convention as a commence-
ment, leaving the Convention to deal with them as
they will. Ido not consider that I have any right to
express an opinion as to how they are to be dealt with,
beyond this, that as they have been entered upon, I
think they should be finished in some form or other.
That seems to me to be due to our own character as a
body of deliberative men, and it is certainly due to
mine.
Sir John Bray : It is not expected that we shall
make these resolutions complete in themselves !
Sir HENRY PARKES : Certainly not. Suppose
Sir John Downer at this moment changed this resolu-
tion of mine so that it should be in quite a different
form from that in which I submitted it, I should not
complain of that. It is the right of the Convention. I
should shape my own course afterwards accordingly;
but I could not complain of the Convention in its un-
doubted right deciding anything upon my resolution.
What I would suggest is that the resolutions be finished,
and that then the whole body of them be referred to
a committee to be reported upon with necessary detail
to make them more complete. lam quite content with
that, and I do not consider that the Convention binds
itself in any way to pass any of these resolutions. I
thought I made that apparent repeatedly.
Sir J oiin Downer : I agree to the course suggested
by the hon. gentleman.
Mr. W rixon : I also shall be willing to withdraw
my amendment.
Sir HENRY PARKES : While I am on my feet I
would suggest that resolution No. 2 be considered, and
oo
No. 3 also, and it be understood that they be then
referred to some committee or to two committees.
There need not be a long debate, I am sure, on these
other resolutions.
Amendment (by Mr. Wrixon) by leave withdrawn.
Amendment (by Sir John Downer) by leave with-
drawn.
Resolution, as amended, agreed to, as follows :
A Parliament, to consist of a senate and a house of repre-
sentatives ; the former consisting of an equal number of
members from each colony, to be elected by a system which
shall provide for the periodical retirement of one-third of the
members, so securing to the body itself a perpetual existence
combined with definite responsibility to the electors; the
latter to be elected by districts formed on a population basis,
and to possess the sole power of originating all bills appropri-
ating revenue or imposing taxation.
Sir JOHN DOWNER : I beg to move:
That the consideration of resolution No. 2 be postponed until
resolution No. 3 is disposed of.
Sir HENRY PARKES: I think it would be a very
good thing if we could finish these resolutions.
Motion agreed to.
The Chairman : The question now before the Com-
mittee is the following resolution:—
(3.) An executive, consisting of a governor-general, and
such persons as may from time to time be appointed as his
advisers, such persons sitting in Parliament, and whose term
of office shall depend upon their possessing the confidence of
the house of representatives expressed by the support of the
majority.
Mr. BAKER : The question now arises whether the
course proposed by the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, or
the course proposed by other hon. members should be
adopted. That is, whether we should discuss this
question, and give some intimation to the committee
as to what are the opinions of the delegates, or whether
we should leave the committee in the dark. I believe
that the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, is right, and that
we should discuss the question.
Sir Henry Parkes ; It is proposed to discuss both
of these resolutions !
Mr. BAKER : It is too late to discuss them to-
night, so I beg to move :
That the debate be now adjourned until to-morrow.
Motion agreed to; progress reported.
Convention adjourned at 515 p.ra.
WEDNESDAY, I8 MARCH, 1891.
Federal Constitution—Appointment of Committees—
Adjournment.
The President took the chair at 11 a.ra.
FEDERAL CONVENTION.
In Committee (consideration resumed from 17th
March, on motion by Sir Henry Parkes);
(3.) An executive, consisting of a governor-general, and
such persons as may from time to time be appointed as his
advisers, such persons sitting in parliament, and whose term
of office shall depend upon their possessing the confidence of
the house of representatives, expressed by the support of the
majority.
Mr. BAKER : I move :
That all the words after the word “advisers” be struck out.
I understand that the Committee is almost unani-
mously of the opinion that these words should be struck
out, and that this resolution, together with resolution
No. 1 of the second series, should be referred to a
committee which may be called a committee of com-
promise, in order that they may suggest some solution
of the two questions involved in them. It has also
been intimated that although the majority of the Con


vention are agreed that this would be a wise course to
adopt, still it is desirable to discuss the resolution
before us in order that the committee may have some
idea of the opinions of hon. members upon it. We
have been told by the hon. the President, that he
will be strongly opposed to any patchwork constitu-
tion, and that to take part of the constitution from
one country and part from another is extremely
inadvisable. But I would point out that up to now
every resolution which we have passed has been taken
from the American Constitution, Of the first series,
resolution No. 1, which gives the central government
certain specified and defined powers, comes from the
United States, and so do resolutions Nos. 2 and 3,
which give the federal parliament the power to impose
a federal tariff 1 , with free-trade between the states,
and resolution No. 4, which puts the federal forces
under the one command of the federal government.
Of the second series of resolutions, No. 1, providing
for the election of a senate composed of an equal
number of members from each province, with peri-
odical retirements, constituting a body with continuity
and perpetual existence, comes from America, and the
only two words in all the resolutions which Ave have
passed which are not identical with the American Con-
stitution are those at the end of resolution No. 1 in
the second series, because the American Senate can
initiate a bill imposing taxation.
Mr. Clark : Not initiate !
Mr. BAKER : Yes, it can initiate taxation. The
only limitation in the American Constitution is that
all bills which appropriate revenue must initiate in
the House of Representatives, and we have gone a
little bit further than that. This being so, unless we
are prepared to follow the American Constitution still
farther, we must have a patchwork. I do not think
there is a member of the Committee who will suggest
or argue that we ought to follow that Constitution in
relation to the executive. The fundamental condition
that we are not to elect a president precludes us from
considering the question, and, if we were not precluded
from considering it, the too great disassociation be-
tween the executive and the legislature, which has
been adopted in the American Constitution, has worked
so badly that I do not think that any one here would
advocate the adoption of the system. But we have to
have a patchwork in the constitution, and it is just as
much a patch as any upon it to try and graft the
American system, which up to now we have followed,
on the British responsible government system. We
have to settle this question somehow, and I quite
agree with the hon. the President that it is a wise
thing to take advantage of the experience of other
countries ; but where are we to go for our experience?
We cannot go to Great Britain for it. A question
which I asked in the early stage of this debate has
not yet been answered. I asked the hon. member,
Mr. Deakin, what would become of the British Con-
stitution if to-morrow it were proposed that there
should be an imperial federation ? Why, the House
of Lords would undoubtedly have to be swept away ;
and, having swept away that body, the whole of the
British Constitution would have to be remodelled.
There can be no doubt whatever about that. They
would have to reconsider not only their upper house,
their senate, or whatever they might call it; but
they would also have to consider the relation of the
executive to the other branch of the legislature. There
are two countries to which we can go for experience
in this matter. We have the experience of America
in reference to the executive for 100 years, and their
system has not worked well; and we have the experi-
ence of Switzerland for some forty-three years, and
we know that the system there has worked well. It
was pointed out in one of the leading newspapers
to-day that there has been a revolution in one of the
cantons in Switzerland; but it was not mentioned
that that revolution was put down with little or no
bloodshed, and without the expenditure of money. So
that if we can argue from that, we must draw a con-
clusion in favour of the Swiss form of executive.
Mr. Munro : They murdered one of their chief men !
Mr. BAKER: There have been murders in Victoria,
and no form of government can be framed which will
stop revolution, if there is a section of the community
who feel strong enough to try to upset the govern-
ment.
Mr. Kingston : There is a telegram in the news-
paper to-day to say that the Swiss are amending their
constitution !
Mr. Munro: No, they are establishing a permanent
army !
Sir James Lee-Steere ; That is because of the state
of Europe !
Mr. BARER: When I first came to the Conven-
tion, I was of opinion, and I placed that opinion on
record before I came here, that it would be advisable
for us to adopt the British form of constitutional
government. I came here with that preconceived
notion; but I also came here to listen to ai'guraent,
and I have - learnt that my preconceived notion has
entirely disappeared upon further consideration, and
upon listening to the arguments of the hon. member,
Sir Samuel Griffith, and others, I am perfectly con-
vinced, so far as I can be convinced at the present
moment—l do not say lam not open to further argu-
ment —that if we have, as we are bound to have, a
strong senate which will be the guardian, the custodian
of state rights and state interests, you cannot have
the responsible form of executive government, because
that form of executive government subsists from the
fact that one branch of the legislature is paramount.
I know it may be stated, “ If you go to South Aus-
tralia, and if you go to Tasmania, you will find the
British form of responsible government with two
elective houses, and you will find that, although there
has been friction in these two colonies, there has,
perhaps, not been greater friction there than there
has been in other places where a different state of
affairs exist.” I cannot speak positively for Tasmania,
but I can speak positively for South Australia, when
I say that the Legislative Council of that colony, not-
withstanding that their powers are contained in the
written Constitution, have always admitted that you
must read between the lines of that Constitution ; you
must always look upon them as holding a position
somewhat analogous to the House of Lords, It is
upon that view of the question that government has
been possible at all, and are we going to suppose that
the federal senate will take up that view ? If we are,
then the federal senate will not be a proper custodian
of the powers intrusted to it, and will not be able to
properly protect the states which it is proposed it shall
be established to protect. Ido not wish to detain the
Committee at any length; but I would like to impress
upon it that it would be advisable to adopt the sugges-
tion of my hon. friend, Sir Samuel Griffith, and to so
frame the constitution as to allow, if circumstances
arise which render it necessary, the adoption of the
Swiss form of executive. I press that view, because
I think it extremely probable that I shall be in the
minority upon this question. There are so many
people here who have grown up under the system of
responsible government, who are imbued with its
excellences, because they themselves have so greatly
succeeded, and have occupied such prominent positions
under that form of Constitution, that they cannot
disassociate what they conceive to be the excellence
of that Constitution from the excellence of the results
which so far, as they are concerned, have been attained.
The longer we live, the more we succeed under any
condition of affairs, the more likely are we to believe
that that state of affairs, which has so benefited us,
and has brought us so much to the front, is a good
state of affairs, and the more likely we are to adopt a
narrow-minded view of the position, and to be unable


to rise superior to the immediate surroundings under
which we have lived so long. I am afraid that is an
idea which is inherent in human nature. I am per-
fectly willing to admit that I am what I am generally
supposed to be—a conservative, and that I am exceed-
ingly loath to change. But I hope I am able to dis-
sociate from my mind that form of responsible govern-
ment which has worked, taking it on the whole, so
well in Great Britain, when we come to consider that
we have to adapt it, if it is possible to adapt it, to a
federation. I believe it is not possible to adapt it to
a federation ; and, therefore, I would ask the com-
mittee who will be appointed to consider the matter,
to make the provisions so elastic as to enable the
evolution of events to bring about another form of
election, or appointment of an executive government
which will work in harmony with the main principles
of a federation.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I understand the hon.
member, Mr. Baker, proposes to omit all the words
after the wmrd “advisers,” so leaving the relationship
of the government to the federation absolutely unde-
fined. The resolution as framed proposes, as I pointed
out on a previous occasion, to stereotype the existing
phase of what is called responsible government. I find
that when I spoke a fortnight ago I was somewhat
misunderstood. I was opposed by some hon. gentle-
men to have been contending for the abolition of what
we call responsible government. I by no means con-
tended for its abolition. I believe, at any rate, that we
had better begin with it. We know of nothing better
at the present. At the same time, I pointed out that
it is difficult to know how what we call responsible
government, that is, a government appointed by the
head of the state, but holding office in practice by the
consent of parliament, will fit in with the system of a
strong senate. That is an experiment which has not
been tried ; but I do not think that because the
experiment has not been tried exactly in that form any
one of us is in a position to say it will not work. I
object, for my part, to say that anything will not work.
Hon. members told us several times the other day that
certain matters will not work, and, as I said at the
time, it reminded me of the arguments used to George
Stephenson about the steam-engine. Why should it
not work 1 It is very easy to say that a tiling will not
work
Dr. Cockburn : It has been tried in Canada and
will not work !
Mr. Munro : Not with a strong senate !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : What I maintain is
this ; the genius of the English people has shown itself
for the last 200 years to be capable of moulding the
constitution, so as to suit it to the exigencies of the
times. Who can tell what the exigencies of the future
will be 1 Are we to suppose that the people of Aus-
tralia do not possess sufficient inventive or adaptive
faculty to adjust their arrangements to the exigencies
of the times 1 I contend only for this : that we should
not make our constitutions so rigid as to insist upon
any particular form of government, any particular
form, rather, of relationship between the executive
and parliament. This resolution as framed does insist
upon a particular form, and not only upon a particular
form, but upon a particular present development of
that form. As has been pointed out already, anything
that will not grow is bound to die ; and if this consti-
tution is adopted in this form it will be incapable of
expansion or adaptation. The constitution will be
stereotyped; it cannot expand, and very likely it will
die. I therefore maintain that the words :
whose term of office shall depend upon their possessing the
confidence of the house of representatives, expressed by the
support of the majority—
ought to be omitted, because they would import a
rigidity into the constitution which would render it
impracticable. Further than that, I think there ought
to be one assertion of principle, and that is, the opposite
of that which prevails in the United States. The
governing rule with respect to the relationship of the
executive to the Parliament in the United States is,
that the members cannot sit in parliament. I main-
tain that the converse is, not that they shall sit in
parliament as is proposed here, but that they may sit
in parliament. 1 suggest, therefore, that the resolu-
tion should read :
An executive, consisting of a governor-general, and such
persons as may from time to time be appointed as his advisers,
who may sit in parliament.
As I pointed out at length on another occasion, that
is the only formula that has been used in the different
constitutions to formally describe the relationship
between the executive and parliament and the Crown,
which is commonly called responsible government.
Mr. Kingston : It is not necessary to express that,
is it 1
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I think it is desirable
to say that. It should not be open to discussion that
we desire to exclude ministers from parliament. Ido
not think it is necessary to compel them to sit in
parliament.
Mr. Baker ; I am willing to withdraw my amend-
ment !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : We should affirm dis-
tinctly that we think the executive should be in close
connection with parliament. That is what we intend
to begin with, at any rate. If in time it be found
expedient that they should not be there they could
stop out; but we should retain the appointment of the
ministers by the head of the state to whom they are
nominally responsible, and who will see that they retain
the confidence of parliament, without which he could
not carry on the government.
Mr. WRIXON : I think that the views which I
apprehend will prevail in this Convention will be met
by striking out all the words after “and” and simply
inserting “ responsible ministers of the Crown.” Then
there would be an executive consisting of the governor-
general and responsible ministers of the Crown. That
would import so much of the English Constitution as
pi’ovides for responsible government, and with it would
be carried, of course, the right of responsible ministers
to sit in parliament. Further than that Ido not think
we wish to go. Ido not think that any of us desire
now to make a paper constitution for the future
dominion. I think that we will be of opinion that it
will be better to let the dominion modify its constitu-
tion as it thinks proper, and as the exigencies of time
and events may require, because in the dominion par-
liament the whole of the people will be represented,
which is, of course, not the case in our Convention,
and it will, therefore, be highly undesirable for us to
impose upon the new dominion government and parlia-
ment any particular set form of constitution or varia-
tion from the English Constitution ; but if we leave it
simply that there should be an executive consisting of
the governor-general and responsible ministers of the
Crown, then any modification which time may show to
be necessary or desirable will be brought about by the
dominion parliament in due course. I think that would
be wiser. If we attempt to frame any valuation, and
in express terms to set out any variation from the
British Constitution, it will take a great deal of time
for us to determine what that variation should be, and
we have sufficiently difficult problems before us with-
out importing that one. Whereas if we leave it to be
settled by the dominion parliament, and by the effects
of experience and time, w r e will no doubt enable a more
satisfactory conclusion to be arrived at than we could
now come to by any consultation. All I think we
ought to do is, in fact, to form an executive consisting
of a governor-general and responsible ministers of the
Crown, which is a term well known in constitutional
government, and then, I think, we would have here all
that is necessary.


Mr. MUNRO : I am very glad indeed to find that
my hon. friend, Sir Samuel Griffith, wishes to put the
resolution in this form, because I certainly was under
the impression that he was leaning towards the Swiss
system. This is a departure from either the Swiss or
the American system. In the American system, the
executive cannot speak or sit in parliament at all.
Under the Swiss system, they may at first be elected
members, but after they are selected as the federal
council, then their seats in either house of parliament
become vacant, and others are appointed in their places.
Under this arrangement we shall be found to follow
out as far as practicable the idea of the hon. and learned
member, Mr. Wrixon, with regard to responsible go-
vernment, because if they “ may” sit in parliament, the
practical outcome will be that they “ must ” sit in par-
liament. There is no doubt of that at all. There is
no question that that will be the result; consequently
it will come to the same thing. Whether the question
of responsible government is introduced into this reso-
lution or not, the outcome of it all must be that, for
the present, at any rate, we must fall back on respon-
sible government. There is no question about that ;
and, personally, I am very glad that we have come to
this point, because it is admitted now by the hon.
member, Mr. Baker, and other hon. gentlemen, that if
we are to have responsible government, we cannot have
responsible government and the senate so powerful as
to be able to stop all financial operations when they
think proper. The two things are incompatible—they
cannot work. How is it possible for you to have a
ministry carrying on the business of the country, and
responsibility of the government to parliament, if after
they reconcile one chamber to their views, the other
chamber steps in and stops the whole proceedings and
business from being carried on ? The thing cannot be
done. As soon as we have settled this question, I
think the other will settle itself. If we are prepared
to carry the resolution, even in this modified form, the
result must be responsible government, and, if we have
responsible government, we cannot, as people exercising
common-sense, allow two houses to be equally powerful,
and while the government is in charge of one house,
and, in fact, responsible to one house, the other house
can stop all its proceedings. lam quite sure the out-
come will be satisfactory to all concerned, and, for that
reason, I do no not care whether the amendment be
passed as the hon. and learned member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, puts it, or as the hon. and learned member,
Mr. Wrixon, wants to put it, for the result will prac-
tically be the same. lam glad we have arrived at this
point.
Sir Henry Parkes : I shall be glad to know if these
words are to be omitted with the intention of inserting
other words, and if so, what words ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : The words I suggest
should be inserted are, “who may sit in parliament.”
I suggest that in order to affirm distinctly that we do
not desire to adopt the American or the Swiss form of
government—that is, to exclude executive ministers
from relationship to parliament ; but, on the other
hand, we desire that parliamentary proceedings should
be conducted by ministers, and not by committees.
That is our intention. That is the formula used in
the British constitutions, and no other form —that they
shall be eligible to sit in parliament. But we do not
compel her Majesty, or her representative, to select
members of parliament.
Sir Henry Parkes : In what constitution does the
hon. member find that 1
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I find it first and
nearest in the New South Wales Constitution, which,
I think, lies on the table, and in the Queensland and
New Zealand constitutions, and also in that of Victoria.
Mr. Munro : Not Victoria !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : In the Victorian Oon-
■etitution it says souie “must,”
Mr. Munro : Only four “must,” although they all
“ may,” sit in parliament!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH ; Yes, four must; but
it does not say in which house. That is the universal
formula used in all British constitutions, and all that
is to be found in the English Constitution so far as
it is written.
Mr. KINGSTON ; I understand that it is intended
to refer these resolutions to a committee, and that
there is a general desire to send them in such a shape
that the committee shall have the fullest power in
recommending what they may consider to be desirable.
Under these circumstances I shall be found supporting
the amendment of the hon. member, Mr. Baker, who
proposes to strike out the latter part of the section,
which would have the effect of placing within the four
corners of the proposed constitution a declaration of
the principle of responsible government, which, so far
as I am aware, is not contained in any act of any
British colony hitherto. But while I shall be found
supporting that amendment, for the purpose of giving
the committee the greatest amount of latitude and
]>ower in dealing with the question, for the same
reason I shall feel it my duty to oppose the amend-
ment suggested by the lion, member, Sir Samuel
Griffith. The hon. member proposes, I understand,
at this early stage in the proceedings to define once
and for all the proposition that the members of the
executive may sit in parliament. If the amendment
of the hon. member, Mr. Baker, is carried the com-
mittee will have power to recommend whatever they
see fit on that subject—to propose that the members
of the executive shall or shall not sit in parliament,
and their hands will not be tied in any way whatso-
ever. But the other proposition amounts to this :
that at this instant we are to lay it down that the
members of the executive may sit in parliament. I
do not see any necessity for laying down any such
proposition at this early stage. I sliould very pro-
bably, if it were necessary to decide the question at
this "particular moment, be found recording my vote
in favour of the proposition which is put in the reso-
lution, and which requires that the members of the
executive shall sit in parliament. Some of the more
recent constitutions in these colonies contain a pro-
vision that certain specified members of the executive
shall not hold their offices for longer than a certain
period, unless they also have a seat in parliament.
But the position which recommends itself most strongly
to my mind is this : why should we deal with this
question at this particular moment 1 ? Why should we
settle the point as to whether they “may” or “must”
have a seat in parliament 1 ? Is it wise to ask us to
deal with this point at this particular stage, when the
whole tenor of the debate is to refer the matter to a
committee, and to leave them the fullest opportunity
of dealing with the question, and making such recom-
mendations as they think best, and which we shall be
able subsequently to deal with 1 ? I think, for a similar
reason, the suggested amendment of the hon. member,
Mr. Wrixon, is open to objection. The hon. member,
by the words he suggests, submits for the consideration
of the Convention the desirability of binding the com-
mittee to a recommendation for the adoption of a
responsible government. I believe in the natural order
of things we must have that form. 1 believe, having
listened carefully to the debate, that there is no other
form which is more likely to commend itself to hon.
members than the form with which we are so familiar,
and which, in spite of the various objections that have
been pointed out, has worked fairly well. But I do
think when the three resolutions have been so fully
debated, and we have practically decided on referring
the resolutions to a committee with the fullest powers
of dealing with them, we should adopt a similar plan
with the 3rd resolution, and not attempt to tie their
hands in any way, certainly not in the way suggested
by the hon. members, Mr, Baker (ind r Sir Samuel


Griffith, who endeavoured to raise questions which, it
does appear to me, can be better decided after we have
received the result of that careful consideration which,
no doubt, will be devoted to them by the committee.
Colonel SMITH : I supported the view taken by
the hon. and learned member, Sir Samuel Griffith, in
the main debate on the resolutions, and I am very
pleased to find that it has been so generally accepted.
I contend that the advantage of the two houses electing
the government would obviate the necessity, which
has always existed in all the colonies, for the members
of a new government to go before their constituents
for re-election.
Mr. Clark : Hot in every colony !
Mr. Playford; Not in South Australia !
Mr. Clark : Not in New Zealand !
Colonel SMITH : I am very glad to hear that very
sensible plan is adopted in South Australia and New
Zealand. That necessity, I say, will be entirely
obviated if the government were appointed for three
years in the way I suggested in the debate on the
main question. It would be appointed by the very
persons who would have control of the affairs of the
dominion. And the advantages of the system would be
very great. There would be no struggling for office ;
for the government would be appointed for three years,
and at the end of that period they could all be reap-
pointed, or any of the members could be reappointed,
and others chosen in the place of those who were not
reappointed. It would work far more smoothly, I
think. It would secure a far more dignified body if
the dominion parliament were placed in that position.
There would be no very hostile parties as far as the
government was concerned, although there might be
differences of opinion on public questions. Therefore,
of the two amendments I prefer the amendment of the
hon. member, Mr. Baker.
Mr. GILLIES: I do not know that much will be
gained by discussing the principle which may be con-
sidered to underlie this resolution, if it is proposed, as
I understand it is, to send it, along with another, to
a select committee. Of course both views of the ques-
tion will be thrashed out. I would join with those
who have drawn attention to the fact that, while we
all have what is considered responsible government,
our constitutions—with the exception, I think, of Vic-
toria, and that to such a small extent that it is scarcely
worth minding—do not set out responsible government
any more than the English Constitution sets out respon-
sible government. It is worked out by a well-known
system, which lies in the hands of Parliament. If
the popular branch of the legislature is not satisfied
with ministers, it expresses that in very clear and
unmistakable language; and if that is not sufficient for
ministers —if they want a little more—what the house
does is to address the governor, and inform his Excel-
lency that ministers do not possess the confidence of
Parliament. That is quite sufficient, of course, in the
working of our constitutions. On every occasion when
the popular house has so expressed its opinion, minis-
ters have had either to go, or to obtain the assent of
the governor to dissolve Parliament, That is the way
our Constitution has worked, and whatever you insert
here at the present moment, that, I have no doubt at
all, is the way our constitution will be worked. Make
the senate as you like ; make it as powerful as you
like; and if it is more powerful than the popular
branch of the legislature, then if under any circum-
stances the senate does not approve of ministers, the
ministers must go. But even if the popular branch
be more powerful than the senate, if it possess the
advantage of being in a position to stop supply, if it
be not satisfied with the government, then the govern-
ment must go, or the parliament must go. If the
parliament should go you at once get the opinion of
the people. The people return such members as they
think proper, and if they are again opposed to ministers
certainly ministers must go. They cannot possibly
help it; but at this stage we are not called upon to
discuss that point. It is, I presume, to be discussed in
a select committee, which it is supposed will make
some recommendation to the Convention. That recom-
mendation may possibly involve the idea of some hon.
gentlemen that we should have a new practice alto-
gether, abolishing what is known as the constitutional
practice, and adopting the Swiss or some other practice.
When the report is brought up I have no doubt hon.
gentlemen will take advantage of what I conceive to
be a fitting opportunity to make a comparison between
these two lines of action. I have no doubt they will
see the necessity, or the necessity may be forced upon
them, of carrying out a system which, whatever dis-
advantages it may possess, has, at any rate, secured
for the people of the various colonies on this continent
in the long run this result: that the will of the people
must prevail.
Mr. THYNNE : Perhaps I may be permitted to say
a word or two in reference to what has been already
said. I think the amendment of the hon. member,
Sir Samuel Griffith, will amount merely to the carry-
ing out of the present system under our various con-
stitutions, in which the general principle is laid down
that members of parliament are not permitted to hold
office of profit under the Crown. That is a cardinal
principle in all our constitutions, and it is only in
virtue of provisions contained in these acts that min-
isters are permitted to occupy the two positions—
first, of an office of profit undei the Crown, and then
that of a member holding a seat in parliament. I
think the suggestion of the hon. member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, preserves the present condition of affairs as
far as we can preserve it.
Mr. PLAYFORD : I understand that this subject
is to be referred to a select committee, which is to
be appointed to specially consider it. I do not, there-
fore, propose to discuss it now farther than to say
this: that the action I shall subsequently take will
depend entirely upon the powers given to the senate.
If you give co-ordinate powers to the senate, it appears
to me doubtful whether we shall be able to work
responsible government, and we should in that case
have to devise some other form of executive. If you
do not give the senate these powers, we had better
retain the power on the part of the Crown to appoint
its advisers from those persons having the support of
a majority in parliament.
Sir JOHN DOWNER : When I suggested last
night the omission of the words :
and whose term of office shall depend upon their possessing
the confidence of the house of representatives, expressed by
the support of the majority—
I had in my mind the advisableness of retaining the
words:
such persons sitting in parliament.
And although I think that responsible government
cannot possibly work with the federation we seek to
establish, either because, in the first instance, it will
be incompatible with anything like co-ordinate powers
on the part of two branches of the legislature, or
because if the powers are co-ordinate then responsible
government will be inapplicable, I gave notice of
another suggestion which I wish to bring before the
Convention, so that the question of some alternative
form of government may be discussed. So far as the
American precedent is concerned, the failure there, it
appears to me, has substantially been through ministers
not being in parliament, and the one point upon which
I believe the Convention is unanimous is that ministers
ought to be in parliament. If the suggestion of the
hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, leaving it optional
with the Convention, subsequently, to say whether
ministers shall or shall not be in parliament be adopted,
it will not expressly affirm the American or the Swiss
Constitution. On the contrary, the suggestion, so far
as words go, leaves it open for the ministry to be com


posed either in the way for which the American or
the Swiss constitutions provide, or by the method
usually adopted in countries governed by the English
Constitution. If the hon. member means to convey a
direct negation of the Swiss and American precedents,
so far as this part of the matter is concerned, ministers
not being in parliament, it would be better to leave
the words “ such persons sitting in parliament.” Now,
as to the rest, I feared in the discussion upon reso-
lution No. 1 that it would be impossible to adequately
consider resolution No. 3 until we had definitely settled
No. 1, and if the view of the hon. member, Mr. Munro,
be correct, that there must be responsible government,
and nothing else, and if that responsible government
cannot co-exist with anything like co-ordinate rights
between the two branches of the legislature, then I
fear as far as my vote and opinion go that any resolu-
tion founded upon the basis of the hon. member’s
opinion cannot meet with my concurrence, because it
appears to me that it goes to the very essence of federa-
tion, that the senate should be a house of high dignity
and of great authority, and to say at the very outset
that it is not to be that, but that it is to be in the
same position as is the legislative council of any one of
the colonies to the legislative assembly of that colony
.—that it is to have the same relations towards the
other branch of the legislature as the legislative coun-
cils of the various colonies bear towards the various
houses of assembly—if that is to be the accepted theory,
and if our practice be simply to carry out that theory,
I am afraid we are still a long way off settling the
question of a federation of Australia. I understand
that it is proposed to strike out all the words at the
end of the resolution, that the matter will then go to
a select committee, and that we shall later on have an
opportunity to consider the whole question. So far as
that is concerned, although I do not agree with the
views of the hon. member, Mr. Munro, and with other
views that have been expressed, I entirely concur in
the striking out of these words, I think an advantage
will be gained by the reference of the whole subject
to a committee which may possibly devise some practical
means of meeting the diliiculty.
Amendment agreed to ; words omitted.
SirSAMUEL GRIFFITH; I did not formally move
the insertion of any words to take the place of those
omitted, I was only anxious to do most expeditiously
that which would meet the general wish of the Conven-
tion. If it be considered desirable that the whole matter
should be referred to a committee, of course no words
should be inserted,
Hon. Members : Hear, hear !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I do not, therefore,
move a further amendment.
Mr. Dibbs : The discussion can take place later on !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Of course if it were
desired now to instruct the committee to make pro-
vision whereby the executive might sit in parliament,
some words should be inserted ; but it appears to me
to be the general wish of the Convention to leave that
matter to the committee, and I therefore move no
further amendment.
Amendment agreed to.
Resolution, as amended, agreed to as follows :
An executive, consisting of a governor-general, and such
persons as may from time to time be appointed as his advisers.
Postponed resolution No, 2 :
A judiciary, consisting of a federal supreme court, which
shall constitute a high court of appeal for Australia, under the
dix-ect authority of the Sovereign, whose decisions as such shall
be final.
Mr. WRIXON : I gave notice of an amendment
leaving out the last few words, which says that the
decision is to be final. I would ask the Convention to
leave out those words, and leave it open to the com-
mittee that will deal with this question to determine
the whole subject, and the very important subject, of
whether the decision of the Supreme Court of Australia
should be absolutely final, or whether we should allow
an appeal to the Privy Council. I will not go over the
arguments which I have already addressed to the Con-
vention on this subject; but I "would simply say that if
the appeal to the Privy Council be taken away, we will
be taking a very serious step towards breaking up the
unity of the empire. We should be the only community
under the British Crown that denied that appeal, and
we should be unquestionably breaking one of the few
remaining ties that keep the empire together. We
should be also under the difficulty of introducing some
difference between our laws and the laws of the rest
of the empire, and we should have a difficulty in consti-
tuting a court of appeal in Australia which would be so
strong that it would overshadow all the provincial tri-
bunals, That is a very great difficulty. Then, with
regard to questions arising between the dominion par-
liament and any of the states —state rights as against
federal rights—which questions certainly will arise—it
must be admitted that it would be unsatisfactory if wo
allowed such questions to be determined finally by the
Australian court of appeal. They will naturally go to
that court because the question of whether the dominion
authority is exceeded in any matter, and the provincial
rights encroached on, can be raised at any time by any
individual whose private rights might be affected. It
would be undesirable to make the final appeal in such
a serious matter rest with the Australian court of appeal.
I think we would all agree that there should be a final
appeal in such matters to the Privy Council.
Mr. Kingston; On constitutional questions?
Mr. WRIXON : Certainly. If a question arises as
to the true construction of a dominion act of parlia-
ment, and the rights existing under that between the
dominion and the states, it would be undesirable to have
that finally decided by an Australian court of appeal.
Mr.'PLAYFORD ; It would be no more undesirable
than it is in the United States !
Mr. WRIXON : It is found in practice that when
some questions arise in the Canadian Dominion the
appeal to the Privy Council is eminently satisfactory,
and is generally accepted as the decision of a body
wholly above any local influences, wholly without any
party bias, and which simply gives a judicial opinion
on the questions of law raised. I certainly think we
should place ourselves in an unfortunate position with
regard to such questions if we took away the appeal
to the Privy Council. I notice that the hon, member,
Mr. Clark, in his amendment, also points to other
matters in which the appeal to the Privy Council is
to be admitted, namely, that in cases in which imperial
interests or the construction of an act of the Imperial
Parliament affecting the rights and properties of per-
sons resident in all parts of the empire are involved,
the appeal to the Privy Council should be allowed. I
think that if so much is allowed, we might really allow
the whole, because a question will often arise as to
whether or not the supreme court has jurisdiction —
whether or not its jurisdiction is ousted—by an
imperial interest intervening, and if it has to determine
that question itself, of course that would be unsatisfac-
tory. But if there is to be an appeal against its deter-
mination of the question of jurisdiction, the appeal to
the Privy Council would not be really taken aw T ay. If
the court of appeal in Australia claimed jurisdiction,
any person might appeal to the Privy Council to say
whether or not it had jurisdiction. I will not ask the
Convention to absolutely decide the question now, but
will ask hon. members to strike out words so as to leave
it open to the Committee to carefully consider the
point, and to make whatever recommendation it thinks
proper to the Convention. I beg to move :
That the following words be omitted;—“under the direct
authority of the Sovereign, whose decisions as such shall be
final.”
Mr. CLARK : The hon. member, Mr. Wrixon,
spoke as if it had been agreed to that this resolution,
as well as the other two, should be submitted to a


select committee. Ido not know that this Convention
has agreed to that course. If that course is agreed
upon I shall not trouble the Committee at the present
stage with very many remarks; but I would point out
that the resolution in its present state provides for a
court of appeal and nothing else. lam very anxious
that the committee shall clearly understand whether
or not the federation is going to have a complete
judicial system for itself, apart from the judicial
system of the provinces. Personally lam in favour
of a complete judicial system for the federation, per-
fectly distinct from the local courts. Holding that
view, I drafted a substantial resolution, to be moved
in lieu of the one under consideration. I understand
that that course would not be in accordance with our
standing orders, I would suggest this amendment:
That all the words after the word “ of,” in the Ist line, be
omitted, with a view to insert the following words,: —“one
supreme court, and such inferior courts as the federal parlia-
ment shall from time to time establish ; and the federal
supreme court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine
appeals from all final judgments, decrees, and orders of the
highest court of resort in each of the colonies ; and the judg-
ment of the federal supreme court shall in all cases in which
imperial interests or the construction of an act of the Imperial
Parliament affecting the rights or property of persons resident
in all parts of the empire are not involved, be final and con-
clusive.”
With regard to what the hon, member, Mr. Wrixon,
lias said as to leaving the present appeal to the Privy
Council untouched, I think the language of my pro-
posed amendment really covers all that is necessary,
and all that the majority of this Convention will be
disposed to leave to the Privy Council. I totally dis-
agree with the hon. member in his desire to leave the
O # ...
appeal to the Privy Council exactly in its present form.
I will not repeat the remarks I made on the original
resolutions; but I think the hon. member will admit
that I gave a few very ugly facts in connection with
some appeals to the Privy Council, which warn us from
committing ourselves in all future time to the decisions
of that body upon purely local matters, such as the
construction of the various land acts of the different
colonies. I will not press that question further now,
because I understand from the general expression of
opinion since I began to speak that it is intended this
resolution should go to the committee.
Mr. KINGSTON: I think that the course suggested,
of leaving it to the committee to deal with this pro-
posal to establish a high court of appeal, is one that
will commend itself to the Convention generally. But
I should like to express my want of sympathy with the
views expressed by the hon. member, Mr, Wrixon.
He has pointed out that this is an important question,
and no doubt it is. Ido not think that our assumption
in our own favour of the right to constitute a court of
this description is likely to realise his apprehensions
as to its disturbing the unity of the empire. I think
it would be in the highest degree lamentable if, in
attempting to establish a high court of appeal in Aus-
tralia, we failed to clothe that court with the necessary
powers once and for all to decide all constitutional
questions arising between the federal dominion and the
states which constitute it. A court of appeal without
that power would be shorn of its chief attribute, and
of a function most largely utilised and most wisely
availed of in the American states. I think also that
whilst we have the right to make our laws, we should,
as far as possible, provide for the creation of a judi-
cature which will have the privilege of interpreting
them ; and it seems to me that the right to legislate
without the fullest right to interpret, and to interpret
in a manner which is not liable to be set aside by the
tribunal of any other country, is essential to the system
of federal government which we propose to create. I
shall be glad to see the matter referred to a select com-
mittee, and I hope its recommendation will be satis-
factory to the Convention, and that it will be found
possible to erect this high court of appeal, and give it
the fullest power of dealing finally with all Australian
matters without impairing the integrity of the empire.
Sir JOHN DOWNEII : I agree that it would be
well to send this resolution to a committee ; and I
think, as I said before, that the proposed court of
appeal should be made as final as we can possibly make
it—as final as we can induce the Imperial Govern-
ment to allow it to be made. In a notice I gave
referring to this subject, I included some questions
rather as matters which I thought ought to be con-
sidered than as representing my own positive opinions.
I there suggested that there might still be an appeal
to the Privy Council on questions between states, or
between states and the federal government and parlia-
ment, or on imperial statutesextending to the colonies
and dependencies of the empire. I did this because
it occurred to me that if the federal judicature were
the only tribunal to decide finally what authority the
federal government had, then the federal parliament
might go beyond what was contemplated —beyond the
provisions of the statute creating it, and by the power
of judge-made law and judicial construction extend
the original intention and the ambit of jurisdiction, as
undoubtedly Chief Justice Marshall did in America,
as it happened in that case, to the infinite benefit
of the republic. I was doubtful whether, whilst the
Imperial Government might consent to the decisions
of the federal court being absolutely final so far as
internal matters were concerned, they might not on the
important question of whether the federal govern-
ment were acting within its jurisdiction or abrogating
a jurisdiction which the statute never intended to give
it, insist on this matter going before them, because the
statute creating the federal parliament will have to be
an imperial statute. It is from that point of view that
I make the suggestion embodied in my notice of
amendment. I think the matter might well be dis-
cussed by a select committee, and I have no doubt the
result will be to make the colonial decisions as final as
they possibly can be.
Amendment (by Mr. Wrixon) agreed to.
JElesolution, as amended, agreed to as follows :
A judiciary, consisting of a federal supreme court, which
shall constitute a high court of appeal for Australia.
Mr. BABTON : I beg to move the following reso-
lution, to stand as resolution 2 :
No new state shall be formed by separation from another
state, nor shall any state be formed by the junction of two or
more states or parts of states, without the consent of the
legislatures of the states concerned, as well as of the federal
parliament.
This resolution is one which I suggested at an earlier
period of our proceedings, and it then seemed to meet
with general approval. It defines the principle that
there must be a concurrence of the legislatures of the
states concerned, and of the federal parliament, in the
formation of any new state by separation from another
state, or by the junction of two or more states or parts
of states. The object of the resolution is to remove a
technical difficulty, and I thought it better to defer it
until the present time, when it will come on in a more
orderly way, than to submit it at an earlier stage. I
gave notice of the resolution, because it appeared to be
the opinion of the Convention, which I thought was a
right one, that upon this subject there should be some
thing definite before the committee which is to be
appointed. It is not a matter of mere detail; but it Is
a matter of principle. If the question here involved is
touched in the Ist resolution, the proposal will come in
for the purpose of definition. Many may think that
the question involved here is not so touched in the
resolution, and in that case this resolution will be
necessary, by way of express provision. It may be
that the means by which the consent of the legislatures
of the states concerned shall be obtained, or the action
which shall be taken as demonstrating their consent,
may be a matter of some further explanation, and it
may or may not be foupd pecessary on that accoup


to append something by way of amendment to this
resolution. But I think hon. members will agree that
a provision of this nature should at any rate find a
place in these resolutions by way of informing not
only the committee, but the public under whose eyes
we are acting, what we regard as some of the main
principles to be observed in this matter.
Mr. THYNNE : I desire to express my regret that
the hon. member, Mr. Macrossan, is unable to take
part in the debate this morning, and to say that I
know that it was his intention to move some amend-
ment upon this resolution, of the particulars of which
I am not fully possessed, but which tended in this
direction ; that the federal parliament should be vested
with all the powers of the Imperial Parliament in con-
nection with the separation of territory from the exist-
ing colonies. I merely mention the subject so that hon.
gentlemen may be aware what the hon. member, Mr.
Macrossan, wished to move, and to preserve for him
whatever opportunity he may wish to discuss the matter
more fully.
Mr. GILLIES : The question here raised has various
phases j but I do not know that we are called upon to
discuss it just now, because I look upon the proposal
as one which will take the form of a clause in the pro-
posed constitution, and it will of course come up to us
again in that way. But Ido not know any particular
reason why it should be placed on record at the present
time, because if it is altered afterwards, this is no
declaration to the people as to what form the provi-
sions on the subject will ultimately take.
Mr. Kingston :It w r ill prevent misunderstanding !
Mr. GILLIES : Ido not know that it will. It might
do so if it were a proposal that could not be altered,
but if it is completely changed or struck out altogether
it may be misleading. There are two or three other
important questions, and some of them, I think, quite
as important as this, which will have to be dealt with
by the committee. One of them may be the position
of the governors of the various states, and that will
have to be settled in one of the clauses of the new
constitution. Hon. members know that there are
dozens of important questions covering a variety of
ground which will require to be dealt with in the con-
stitution, and if we propose to deal with them now we
might as well set about framing a constitution straight
off. lam not going to object to the insertion of the reso-
lution, but I hope that manyof these resolutions, involv-
ing, as they do, questions of principle of great magnitude
will be materially altered after they leave our hands,
Mr. Barton : That is quite immaterial; we can alter
them afterwards !
Mr. DIBBS : If this resolution is to be passed only
for the purpose of giving the proposed committee an
opportunity of considering it, I shall not object to it ;
but it is desirable that such an important question as
the cutting off from one state of sufficient territory to
form a new one should only be dealt with by a marked
majority in each house, and I propose, unless we have
the assurance of the hon. member, Mr. Barton, that he
has moved the motion only for the purpose of leaving
it to the consideration of the committee
Mr. BARTON : Yes, that is so. All I wish to
assert by the resolution is that this consent must be
obtained. What is to be taken as involving or demon-
strating that consent is, I think, more properly a matter
for the committee to consider, and therefore I did not
interfere with it.
Resolution agreed to.
Sir GEORGE GREY : I beg to propose that the
following resolution stand as resolution No. 5 :
The inhabitants of each of the states of federated Australasia
ought to be allowed to choose, and if they see fit from time
to time to vary, the form of state government under which
they desire to live. Provision should therefore be made in
the federal constitution which will enable the people of each
state to adopt by the vote of the majority of voters, their own
form of state constitution.
Question proposed.
Sir Henry Parkes : I wish to raise a point of order
upon this resolution, and I do it with the utmost
respect to the distinguished gentleman who has moved
it. My point of order is that the resolution goes beyond
our instructions. We have been sent here for one
object and one object only, and that is, to prepare a
scheme for the framing of a federal constitution. Any-
thing outside of these prescribed words cannot be dealt
with under the commission in virtue of which we have
come here.
Sir George Grey ; I submit to the Convention that
our duty is simply to recommend a form of federal
constitution ; and I say that it cannot be contended for
one moment that a body of men should have been
summoned from every part of Australasia, and that
they should be told that upon the most important sub-
ject in the federal constitution they are not even to be
allowed to recommend to the consideration of the people
of New Zealand what form of constitution they think
should be given to the states composing the federation.
Now, it will be found that what we are directed to do
is to consider a form of federal constitution, and, again,
we are told in another place that we are to consider
the question of a federal parliament. We are told
that we are to consider the question of a form of federal
constitution, and we are told also that we are to con-
sider particularly the form of one part of that consti-
tution. I think no one can possibly doubt that that
decides the point that we have a right to consider the
whole form of federated constitution. I would then
refer to federated constitution acts. Anybody who
refers, for instance, to the New Zealand Constitution
Act, as it is termed, will find that there a federal form
of government is given ; and they were both included
in the same Constitution Act. It appears to me, there-
fore, impossible to argue, and I cannot conceive the
ground upon which the argument can be maintained,
that we, who are summoned here to form a federal
constitution, should not consider the ground upon
which the constitution is built up, that is, upon the
state constitutions. I ask hon. gentlemen is it right
that we should ask the states to join in a constitution
of the kind without our having first given them the
power of determining what the form of constitution is
to be, under these altered circumstances 1 Their whole
position is to change ; they are to give up what may
be called individual sovereignty or individual power to
enter into a federated union ; and we are not to be
allowed to consider or to recommend to them what
conditions they should accede before they yield up the
great privileges which they now possess ! I cannot
myself see upon what possible ground the contention
may be made, that I have no right to ask this Con-
vention, representing the people of all Australasia, to
consider what should be done in reference to the states
that we ask to come under a federated parliament. I
say that the words “ federal constitution ” govern the
whole question ; and if we are not to be allowed, as
the representatives of the whole of Australasia, even
to consider this point, not to be allowed to make a
recommendation regarding it, then we have been badly
treated in having been brought here, in having been
subjected to this loss of time, this great delay in our
several avocations. It is treating us like children rather
than like statesmen to try to take this privilege of con-
sidering what the state constitutions should be away
from us. I therefore feel it my duty to contend to the
very utmost as to what our rights upon this subject
are; and I feel confident in my own mind that the
unanimous opinion of this Convention will be in favour
of the right I claim of bringing this point under their
consideration. Let me point out to hon. gentlemen
that the whole of the privileges of the inhabitants of
Australasia depend upon this Convention ; the whole
of the privileges which they will have under the new
constitution are involved in it. I say there will be no
right at all conceded to the people of this continent if
this right is taken from under their control. I feel,


therefore, whatever may be said in any document or
paper, that we, having been called here to say what
the form of federal constitution should be, have a
right to insist upon considering this most important
point of all. I shall use no further argument; it appears
to me that the matter is self-evident. I think that
this attempt to stop a consideration of the kind is one
that will strike with astonishment every part of the
civilised world which is regarding what is being done
by this Convention. I feel sure that one common
wonder will seize the minds of all men that an attempt
to stop discussion upon this most important matter
should be made. I cannot realise that I have to stand
here to argue so plain a point, to ask for so clear a right
for every man, woman, and child of all Australasia. I
feel that I cannot realise that I am stopped in asking
for this right on their behalf, which I now do.
Dr. Cockburn : I think we have nothing whatever
to do with deciding the details of the state constitutions.
On the other hand, I think it appertains to the func-
tions of this Convention to decide that the power of
framing a constitution shall be in the hands of the
several states. At present the legislatures of the vari-
ous colonies can only be altered with the consent of
the Imperial Government. Is it intended that that
shall remain h When we have a federated Australasia,
in which we have state legislatures and a federal legis-
lature, is it intended that the state legislatures shall
have the power of altering their constitutions at will
or not 1 From that point of view I think the propo-
sition put forward by the Iron, member, Sir George
Grey, is decidedly within the powers of the Conven-
tion, the power to lay down a general rule, without
touching the details of any individual constitution, that
the various states should have the power of framing
their own constitutions according to the will of the
majority of the people of those states.
Colonel Smith : A bare majority 1
Dr. Cockburn : That is a point of detail to be
decided ; but I take it that the whole question is such
a fundamental proposition
Sir Henry Parkes ; It is a fundamental proposition
no doubt, but it is not within our business !
Dr. Cockburn : But, sir, the state legislatures are to
be one of the party.
Sir Henry Parkes: No one doubts that!
Dr. Cockburn : Other constitutions—the Constitu-
tion of Canada, for example, which the lion, member,
Sir Henry Parkes, frequently cites as a precedent—•
distinctly laid down the lines. It not only dealt with
the question in general, but it laid down exactly the
form of government which every state was to have.
That, I think, is very undesirable ; but I do think that
if we do not lay it down distinctly we ought to have
it understood most distinctly that the states are to have
power to frame their own constitutions. Unless this
is distinctly understood the states will not have any
such power. In the American Constitution it is not
mentioned, for the states were sovereign, and had power
before they went into the federation to frame their con-
stitutions as they wished, and that power remained to
them ; but here they have no such power, and I main-
tain that it is absolutely necessary for the individual
states, when they come into the federation, to have the
power of varying in whatever way they think fit the
forms of legislation under which they are governed. If
this is understood, well and good; but if it is not to
be understood without a resolution, I shall support the
contention of the lion, member, Sir George Grey. Many
of us are not in favour of bicameral legislation at all.
I think that the state legislatures might well consist,
as in Ontario, of single houses, with the power of
referendum to the people.
The Chairman : The hon. member is out of order.
He must discuss the point whether this resolution is
or is not within the scope of the Convention,
Dr. Cockburn : I humbly submit that it is within
the scope of the Convention to decide what power of
from time to time varying the constitution of the
state legislatures should lie with the states. At present
we cannot change our constitutions without reference
to the Imperial Government.
Mr. Clark : Leave things as they are !
Dr. Cockburn : What are we to understand —that
the present condition of things is to obtain ?
Sir Henry Parkes : Is this on the point of order 1
Dr. Cockburn : Most decidedly. I maintain that
the hon. member, Sir George Grey, is in order in rais-
ing this question—that the local legislatures are part
and parcel of the compact—a point that from time to
time seems to be ignored. The state legislatures are
just as much part and parcel of the bargain of federa-
tion as is the central legislature. It is not a one-
sided affair, but essentially a bargain between the two
—the local legislatures, as they exist now and are to
exist, and the central legislature, and the powers of
the local legislatures, as exercised from time to time,
and the powers of the central legislature. I humbly
submit that it is perfectly in order for the Conven-
tion to deal with the question, which is second to none
in importance, as to what the powers of the state
legislatures, which are to form a great and most im-
portant part of this federation, are to be. As I under-
stand that the mover of the resolution considers that
the point of order ought to be settled first, I refrain
from saying anything further now. I thought it
would have gone without saying that the resolution is
in order.
Mr. Gillies : Personally, I do not suppose that any
one would have any objection to an abstract discussion
on so important a point as that raised by the hon.
member, Sir George Grey. But while I would have
no objection to discuss on any other occasion a ques-
tion of this importance, the question raised is : con-
stituted as we are here, delegated to do certain duties,
is a portion of those duties the setting out of what the
various states ought to do, or how far they shall be
competent to alter their forms of government 1
Mr. Clark : “ May do”!
Mr. Gillies : I said, “ May do.”
Mr. Clark : The hon. member said, “ Ought to
do ” !
Mr. Gillies ; Well, “ Ought to do.”
Mr. Clark : That is a very diffei'ent thing !
Mr. Gillies : It is not necessarily a different thing.
I thought at first the hon. member, Dr. Cockburn,
was indulging in somewhat of a joke. Has any one
colony authorised this Convention to deal with its
constitution ? Not one.
Dr. Cockburn : In the future !
Mr. Gillies : The hon, member need not interrupt.
He has had his say, and will have a further oppor-
tunity to say what he thinks proper. As far as we
know, not a single colony has authorised this Conven-
tion to deal with the question of its constitution.
Sir Henry Parkes : Hear, hear !
Mr. Gillies : Or recommended that in any way we
should interfere with its constitution.
Sir Henry Parkes : Hear, hear !
Mr. Gillies : And I venture to say if you appeal
to any of the colonies they would consider it gross
impertinence for this body to deal with a question
affecting their rights and interests, which has not been
remitted to us to deal with at all. I venture to say
that I can speak confidently with reference to the colony
of Victoria. The colony of Victoria has not asked
this Convention to deal with its Constitution, or to
make any recommendation at all with reference to it.
The colony of Victoria can very well deal with its own
Constitution.
Sir Henry Parkes ; Hear, hear !
Mr. Gillies : And it can amend that Constitution
in any way it thinks proper. It has amended it from
time to time, and, although at one time there was a
provision that amendments could only be made by a
clear majority of both branches of the legislature, this


having been once amended amendments now come
under the ordinary law of legislation, which merely
requires a simple majority. I believe that the only
thing now left in the Constitution of Victoria the
amendment of which requires a clear majority, and to
be reserved for her Majesty’s assent, is portion of
schedule D, which has not up to the present time been
amended.
Mr. Munro : And the 60th clause itself !
Mr. Gillies : All they have to do is to repeal that
portion of the Constitution Act which requires an
alteration of that section to be reserved for her
Majesty’s assent. Once repeal that section, and you
do away with everything. We have dealt with our
Constitution from time to time, making most import-
ant amendments without the advice of gentlemen from
the other colonies —without the advice of gentlemen
in this Convention not belonging to Victoria, We take
for granted that we are able to alter our Constitution
in the way we think proper, and we decline to be
dictated to by a body not authorised to deal with that
question. Whatever abstract resolutions they think
of passing, it appears perfectly clear to me
Mr. Kingston : This is not a point of order !
Mr. Gillies : Yes; it is a most important point of
order, namely, that this subject cannot be dealt with
by this Convention. It was not a question submitted
to the Convention, and we have no powerto deal withit.
Sir George Grey : I submit that the hon. member
is not speaking to the point of order. There has been
no proposal made to interfere with the constitutions.
Mr. Gillies : I am afraid the hon. gentleman has
forgotten his own resolution, which says :
Provision should therefore be made in the federal constitu-
tion which will enable the people of each state to adopt by the
vote of the majority of voters their own form of state consti-
tution.
The hon. gentleman asks that in the federal constitu-
tion, which we are authorised by our respective colonies
to frame, provision should be made by which an im-
portant alteration shall be made in the local constitu-
tions. I say the local legislatures have never asked
the Convention to do that, and it is out of the scope
of the Convention to do that unless authorised to do it.
Dr. Cockburn : One word in explanation. I, and
I am sure any hon. member, would not be guilty of the
impertinence of suggesting to a neighbouring colony
what the form of their constitution should be, nor did
I understand the hon. member, Sir George Grey, to do
so.
Mr. Gillies : It is in the resolution !
Dr. Cockburn : The question is not what the details
of the constitutions are now ; but what power of change
there shall be in the future, for the power now given
to change constitutions cannot obtain in the future.
We cannot now make important alterations in the Con-
stitution without the consent of the legislature and the
Crown. But nobody supposes that when we are feder-
ated we shall have to go behind the federation to the
Crown for a change of constitution. It is quite com-
petent for us to consider, not what the present details
of any constitution are, but what the powers of change
from time to time should be. It is necessary to fix this,
because we know that the present powers of change
cannot obtain in the future, and surely we must have
some guide in the future. We should agree to the great
principle that in future, after the federal constitution is
framed, the powers of changing their constitutions as
they please shall reside wholly and entirely in the vai’ious
state legislatures. That is a most important principle
and is, I maintain, entirely in order.
Mr. Munro : The contention of the hon.member, Dr.
Cockburn, clearly indicates that this Convention should
make a change in the constitutions of the colonies.
Dr. Cockburn : Clearly not!
Mr. Munro : It clearly indicates that. Take the Con-
stitution of Victoria. Section 60 provides the mode in
which we can alter the Constitution; and, so far as the
provisions of the Constitution have not been altered,
the mode is by a majority of the members of both
houses. But the proposition now is that the majority
of the people can alter the constitution of a colony.
That, I submit, is a departure entirely from the pro-
visions of our Constitution. We are not here authorised
to do anything to enable this Convention to alter the
provisions of our Constitution. I think we are entirely
precluded from doing anything of the sort. The pro-
posal of the hon. member, Sir George Grey, clearly is
that section 60 of the Constitution of Victoria shall be
so altered, and that instead of a majority of members of
both houses, a majority of the people may alter our Con-
stitution. That, I contend, is not within the province
of the Convention.
Mr, Thynne : I think the discussion has raised
two questions. A good deal of the speech of the hon.
member, Mr. Gillies, went into the merits of the pro-
position of the hon. member, Sir George Grey, which,
there can be no doubt, is within the scope of this
Convention. I think we might just as well, in a
legislative assembly, pass an act saying that the mode,
or the selection of the electors who are to appoint the
members, is a question which is outside their con-
sideration. In this confederation it is proposed to
have a senate representing the states, whether state
legislatures or otherwise. But at present I take it
that the senate will be elected by the states legis-
latures. Is not everything affecting the states legis-
latures a matter for the Convention to take into con-
sideration 1 That one ground is, I submit, sufficient
to entitle an hon. member to introduce a resolution
dealing with the question of the constitution of the
states, because in that respect they affect the consti-
tution of the federation as regards the election of the
members of the senate.
Mr. Kingston : It will be a great pity if any
decision is given which may tend to unnecessarily
stifle discussion, and I do trust, sir, that any ruling
which you may feel it your duty to give will be in
favour of the fullest right of free discussion on matters
on which there may be any doubt. But it appears
to me that there is no room for doubt —that we are
entitled to discuss and deal with this resolution. We
are here for the purpose of framing an adequate
scheme for a federal constitution, and there is no
doubt whatever that for that purpose we shall have
to deal with the local constitutions and to alter them.
At present the local legislatures have power to deal
with a variety of subjects which they will be asked to
surrender to the federal government. Is not that an
alteration of the local constitutions'?
Mr. Clark : Of course it is !
Mr. Kingston : Then, if we are entitled to deal with
the local constitutions, so far as relates to the surrender
of powers, surely we are similarly entitled to deal with
the local constitutions as regards the component parts
of the various legislatures. I think it would bo
perfectly within our province if we saw fit to provide
that local legislatures which are constituted in a certain
way, or in which the upper branch is of a nominated
character, shall not be admitted to the federation.
Dr. Cockburn : Of course it would !
Mr. Kingston : If it is within our power to adopt
a course of that sort, is it not within our power to
provide that the people of the various provinces shall
have certain powers either with reference to the making
or altering of their constitutions 1 Ido not see how
it is possible to deal with the question of a federal
constitution, without at the same time dealing with
and altering the various local constitutions. It seems
to me that the resolution proposes to lay down the
principle—and a most important principle as affecting
the local constitutions—that the people of a colony
shall have the opportunity by their own votes of
deciding the form of constitution under which they will
live. I agree to a very great extent with the remarks
which have fallen from the hon. member, Dr, Cockburn


but I go further than he does. He puts it that we
have no right to deal with the details of the various
local constitutions. I say we have the right; and we
must exercise it in various ways, notably as regards
the constitutional powers which are to be reserved to
the local legislature and the powers which have to be
surrendered to the federal parliament. We shall have
to exercise that power for the purpose of defining the
relationships which shall exist between the lieutenant-
governor of a particular province and the federal
government. We have a right, undoubtedly, to deal
with the question so far as it is essential to rhe
establishment of an adequate scheme for a federal
constitution in the very minutest detail. I simply put
that position because it appears to me to be the correct
one. This is not a matter of detail. It is a matter of
the most important principle. It is a question of
confiding to the people of a province the power of
framing their constitution, and I do think, under all
the circumstances, that we have the right to discuss
the resolution, and, in view of its great importance,
it will be a great pity if we refrain from exercising
that right. I do trust that we shall shortly have an
opportunity of listening to the hon. member, Sir George
Grey, who, no doubt, will introduce to our notice a
subject of the most vital importance.
Sir Henry Parkes : I submit that the argument of
the hon. member who has just sat down cannot for a
single moment be sustained. The hon. member argues
that because certain surrenders must be made by the
state constitutions in the work which we are intrusted
to do, therefore we can travel over the whole ground
and remodel those constitutions. I contend that we
are bound to act within the strict definition of our
commissions and instructions. The resolutions as
passed by the several legislatures define the constitu-
tion which—and their opinion confirmed the opinion of
the conference held in Melbourne —ought to be brought
into existence in this country; they definitely appoint
persons to frame an adequate constitution for federal
purposes, and they do nothing else. How, for us to
travel outside what is necessary in framing a federal
constitution would open the doors to the consideration
of an entire reconstruction of the government in the
several states. Certainly that is no part of our busi-
ness, and if we proceed in so loose a way in transacting
our business as that, why then there is no telling what
province we may enter upon, because the whole theory
of government for any part of Australia would come
under the range of our operations. How our commis-
sion is very definitely laid down. The resolutions passed
by the parliament of this country, which are identical
with those passed by the other parliaments, are to this
effect as to the constitution which, in the opinion of
the conference formed by the several parliaments,
should be brought into existence :
That in the opinion of this conference
And I here interpolate the words “confirmed by the
Parliament ”
the best interests and the present and future prosperity of the
Australian colonies will be promoted by an early union under
the Crown . . . under one legislative and execu-
tive government, on principles just to the several colonies.
Here is a complete definition, and we cannot travel
outside it. Then follow the words that the persons
sent to this Convention are
empowered to consider and report upon an adequate scheme
for a federal constitution.
That is, a federal constitution in conformity with this
definition. Ho doubt, in preparing and reporting upon
an adequate scheme for a federal constitution, certain
powers to be withdrawn from the state legislatures
might be suggested. But that in no way implies that
we should go, or in the slightest degree justifies us in
going, beyond what is necessary for that one federal
purpose. It is on those grounds that I submit we
cannot entertain the resolution now before the Com-
ipittee, Jt is idle to say that any one desires to stop
discussion. All that we desire to do is to confine it
within the legitimate channel of the business we have
to transact.
Mr. Macdonald-Paterson : I must say—and I say
so respectfully—that I entirely disagree with some
of the observations of the last speaker. I hold most
strongly the view that it is quite within the scope of
the resolution, from which the lion, gentleman lias
just quoted, empowering us to take steps to frame a
constitution just to all the colonies, that we should
consider this point. The hon. gentleman has spoken
of a surrender of certain powers of local government ;
but I would remind him that if our labours are to
have a successful conclusion the imperial authorities
will also have to make a certain surrender. If I
understand the hon. member, Sir George Grey, cor-
rectly, he intends his resolution —which I respectfully
say is a little verbose, and which might with advan-
tage be made to read in the form I will presently
suggest to the Committee —to mean that the impelial
authority shall surrender to the federal authority its
right to reject any amendment by any colony of its
constitution, and that the federal parliament shall
absorb that authority. As has been asked by the
hon. member, Dr. Cockburn, are we to go behind the
federal parliament and ask the assent of the Imperial
Parliament 1 That is not intended.
Dr, Cockburn ; We shall have to provide for some-
thing else !
Mr. Macdonald-Paterson : That is what I am
arguing. And surely it we ask that the right of
appeal to the Privy Council shall be abolished, and
that we shall have recourse to our own Supreme
Court in all matters relating to Australia-—surely if
we go so far as that in one direction —it is not too
much to ask that the governments of Australia, in
making amendments in their constitutions, shall not
have recourse to the imperial authorities, but to their
own local court, the federal parliament, if indeed any
further assent than that of its own legislature be
considered necessary to establish any modification of
its constitution. I think the resolution of the hon.
member, Sir George Grey, might be so amended as
to read in this form :
That provision be made enabling each state to amend or
vary its own state constitution.
That, I think, would meet with the approval of all
the delegates here. I do not wish to prolong this
discussion, but I desire to express my approval of the
hon. member’s views, and to assert my belief that it
is quite within the scope of our duties here to make
some such simple affirmation as that which I have
just suggested.
Mr. Adye Douglas : It appears to me that the
resolution of Sir George Grey is clearly within the
jurisdiction of this Committee, providing he strikes out
the words “ by the vote of the majority of voters,”
and simply provides that each colony should be free to
adopt its “own form of state constitution.” The reso-
lution simply says that any of the local constitutions
may be altered subject to the sanction of the federal
parliament, taking away from the Crown in England
the reserved power it possesses at this moment, and
vesting it in the federal parliament. Our whole
proceedings are, I take it, upon this principle that
we are striving to establish a constitution that will
relieve us as far as possible from any local jurisdiction
in England ; and if that is the principle upon which
we are acting, I think that before objecting to the
resolution of the hon. member, Sir George Grey, upon
a point of order, we should first hear what he has to
brin" before us. When the hon. member has given us
his reasons for the resolution, a point of order may, if
necessary, be taken. It seems to me, however, that
the resolution, as it appears upon the paper, is clearly
within the scope of the duties before us, and that it
would be an act of grace to allow the hon. member to
proceed.


Dr. Cockburn : Not an act of grace—it is the hon.
member’s right!
Sir Samuel Griffith : I desire to say a few words.
I understand Sir George Grey to suggest this : that
we are directed to frame an adequate scheme of fed-
eral government, and that no scheme will be adequate
that does not deal with the question of the constitu-
tion of each colony. That, shortly, is the hon. gentle-
man’s argument. Let me give one illustration. Not
so very many years ago the colony of Jamaica had
constitutional government by two houses ; it surren-
dered its constitution and took the form of govern-
ment by one nominated legislative chamber, becoming,
in fact, a Crown colony. Surely if some of these
Australian colonies now proposing to federate, were
to become Crown colonies, it might be a serious ques-
tion as to whether they should be allowed to continue
in the federation, and the effect might be to break up
the whole constitution. We cannot, therefore, give
the go-by to the matter. Certainly an adequate scheme
of federal government must insist that the constituent
parts of it shall not entirely change their nature. I
do not think, therefore, that the question is foreign to
the subject of our discussion—an adequate scheme of
federal government.
Sir J ohn Bray : I would ask the hon. member, Sir
Henry Parkes, to withdraw his point of order. There
is no doubt a good deal of division on the question as
to whether or not it is strictly within the scope of our
instructions; but the members of the Convention
would like to have the fullest possible discussion, and
I think, therefore, we might give the hon. member,
Sir George Grey, an opportunity to show that it is
within the scope of our powers, and also to hear what
may be said against it. As there is such a division
of opinion on the point, I would ask the hon. member,
Sir Henry Parkes, not to press his objection.
Sir Henry Parkes : My object in rising to this
point of order was to prevent the Convention—and I
think I am acting in the interests of the Convention
in so doing—from wandering into subjects with which
they have really nothing to do. That was my object
and my point of view. But gentlemen will recollect
that I raised my point without saying more than ten
words in support of it. And I was quite prepared
that it should at once be decided by the Chairman. If,
however, it be the desire of the Convention, I am quite
willing to withdraw ray point of order. I raised it in
support of the orderly conduct of the business of the
Convention, and from a desire to confine it to the object
for which, I am quite sure, it was brought into existence,
and with no other purpose whatever. It is rather unjust
to me for even Sir George Grey to venture to say that
I desire to stop discussion. I simply desire to confine
discussion within its legitimate limits —nothing more.
Sir GEORGE GREY; Sir, since I proposed the
resolution which you have put to the Committee, an
attempt has been made to prevent me from doing so
upon a point of order. That objection, however, hrs
now been withdrawn. But I owe it to myself and to
the Committee to say this : that it was clearly with-
drawn because it would not have been sustained by
the Committee, and it was certainly the opinion of this
Convention, as far as I could understand their expres-
sions on the subject, that you had an undoubted right
to put the resolution. Therefore, in proposing it now
in a different form from what I did before, I wish to
guard myself against having done this from any desire
to make the resolution more in order than it was
before, when it was perfectly in order ; but simply to
narrow the point of discussion, because I understand
that if it is carried by the Committee, it will be sent
to a select committee, and there be fully and properly
considered. I therefore propose to put the resolution
now in this form :
That provision should be made in the federal constitution
which will enable each state to make, vary, or annul its con-
stitution.
The Chairman : In order to allow the proposed
alteration to be put to the Committee, it will be neces-
sary for the Convention to give leave to withdraw the
motion now before it.
Motion, by leave, withdrawn.
Sir GEORGE GREY; In moving the motion which
I have just read, I wish now to remark that I believe
the decision to which the House has come on this sub-
ject is one of the most important decisions that perhaps
any chamber has ever come to—that is as affecting the
whole future of the continent of Australasia. I now
feel quite satisfied in my own mind that this Conven-
tion will arrive at a definite recommendation, which
will be made to the various states which it desires to
see enter into the federation which it is now attempting
to form. I feel further satisfied that if such a federa-
tion be entered into it will, under the system which
we shall be able to establish, last for all time. That
is, perhaps, from period to period the different states
may vary their constitutions, perhaps almost destroy
one constitution and put another in its place; but upon
the whole such satisfaction and contentment will pre-
vail throughout the entire federation that it will be
lasting, and of the utmost durability. Now, the object
which I had in view in preparing the resolution which
I submitted to the House, and of which this is really
a repetition in a shorter form, was this : that in every
other federal constitution which I have seen or known,
the first thing done w 7 as to form the states, and to
assign to them their powers. In the case of the United
States, that was unnecessary, for they already had full
powers and almost the same form of government ; and
they have retained very nearly that form of govern-
ment ever since, with slight variations from time to
time, perhaps ultimately in the course of years amount-
ing to considerable changes. I believe that exactly
the same thing will take place in Australasia. And
unless this were done, which I now propose, I do not
believe that for many years there would be a firm
federation established on this continent. And for this
reason, that undoubtedly in some of the constitutions
of the states, antiquated forms have been introduced
without the consent of the inhabitants having been
obtained; which antiquated forms were, in many
cases, opposed, as, I believe, to the wishes of the
majority of the inhabitants of the states, and which it
would have been impossible almost to have altered
without great difficulty, owing to the form in which
their legislatures were constituted. That is, by either
having a nominated upper house, or by the upper
house being fettered by conditions now unknown abso-
lutely in other countries—such, for instance, as a money
qualification in the members. In England that has
been absolutely abolished. In my youth no man could
take his seat in the House of Commons unless he had
£6OO a year if he was a member for a county, or
£4OO a year if he was a member for a borough ; and
that qualification in the case of counties was required
to be in land. Now, the result of that was that a largo
number of persons who had no such qualification really
got into the houses of parliament. But they got in
in this way : that, being the sons or relations of very
wealthy men, their relations conveyed to them the day
before the election an estate in land of the requiicd
value. That estate was held until the election was
over, and then it was reconveyed to the person who
had made the conveyance in the first instance. The
result of that was necessarily that many avenues of
usefulness in political life were closed against every-
body but those who were either wealthy themselves
or who had wealthy relations who were inclined to help
them. I was surprised, indeed, when I found that with
that experience staring them in the face, they had in
some colonies of Australia—certainly in one—gone
back to the old system and established a property
qualification. I have no doubt that under the terms
of this resolution, the recommendation of this Con-
vention will go in this direction, that is, that they will


require no qualification at all in the member, except to
be a voter; that they will approach, in point of fact,
very nearly to what is the present rule in Great Britain,
which is, or was, regarded as a most aristocratic country.
If that is done throughout Australasia, the result will
be, if the people at the same time have the power of
electing their lieutenant-governors, that every great
post but one in the whole of Australasia will be open
to every man of ability, or of such ability or of such
force of character, or occupying such relations of public
life, as will secure him the votes of a large constitu-
ency; and an immense amount of talent that under
other circumstances would be shut out from serving
the state will have a fair opportunity open to it, and
there can be no doubt that numbers of able men will,
under such a system, be found who otherwise would
have remained undiscovered, useless to their country,
and probably many great measures will hereafter be
carried which could not have been carried under any
other system than that which I am convinced will be
recommended for adoption. I cannot help thinking
that the advantage of getting this amount of ability
and energy into play is almost wholly overlooked, and
but very little conception is as yet formed of the spur
that will be given to enterprise and energy, and all that
can make men happier and better off by opening all these
places of great importance to every single citizen of each
state in the confederation. This was lately very forcibly
impressed upon my mind. I will just give an example
of what I mean, and what I think, perhaps, the future
legislature will agree to. When I went to South
Africa I found that in some of the towns there were
considerable portions of valuable town land which had
not been made away with, and anxious some forty
years ago to establish something like the system of
getting at the unearned increment which we wish to
establish here, or at least which a great number of
people desire, by vesting those lands which had not
been sold in the corporation, subject to trusts for im-
provements, for the benefit of the inhabitants of the
city, and subject also to the condition that they should
only be let for forty years. The result is at the present
time that I saw that when Sir Henry Loch visited
Port Elizabeth, one of the towns in which this was
done, the people boasted that formerly, when I had
visited them years before, I found there one of their
citizens—a man of great influence and of great energy
■—and that I got him to act as the person to bring
the events about that I desired, and that the results
were almost incredible. They showed Sir Henry Loch
the magnificent building in which they entertained
him, and they told him that next day they would sur-
prise and astonish him by the multitude of establish-
ments for the benefit of the citizens which had been
created throughout their entire district. I will only
just put it to hon. gentlemen what the effect of such a
thing must be. Imagine for one moment that the
whole rental of Sydney at the present time was the
property of the corporation for the use of all the
citizens ! Is it possible to estimate the benefit that
would result under such circumstances to the inhabi-
tants of this place ? I firmly believe that if once into
the hands of the great majority of the people passes
the power of electing their own members freely, with-
out being fettered by any of the obligations of the
old times, there are yet great cities to arise in many
parts of Australasia, every one of which will rise
upon the plan I speak of, that the lands are disposed
of simply upon lease and subject to a rental, which
may be renewed every forty years, or at some lesser
period. There is no reason why such a thing should
not be done, injuring nobody, but blessing countless
thousands of people who will occupy this country in
the next century or half century of time. Unless the
states clearly have their representation founded upon a
system which enables every man to give his vote—•
some people go further, and would give a vote to
females; I will not say anything on that now, but
there is a great deal to be said for the proposal —but
I believe that at once, after such a number of intellects
are set to work, at once after such a number of persons
have become interested in political considerations, such
great improvement as I speak of will be carried out,
and hundreds of others will follow. I believe a time
will come when, under such circumstances, the govern-
ment maintaining the command of their railways,
people will travel at an insignificant cost and move
their produce at an insignificant cost to every part
of the country, and that many properties now almost
absolutely valueless, on account of the distance at which
they lie from the market, the owners being unable to
bring their produce on cheap terms to the best and
greatest market in these seas, perhaps I may call it—
that is, either Sydney or Melbourne—l think that,
when that advantage is given, numbers of persons now
in comparative poverty will be enriched by the value
that will be given to their properties and holdings. I
could follow this subject out into numerous branches ;
I could show how the intellect of a vast number of
people would be improved and enlarged, from young
men reading, and carefully studying to embark into
political life, and to distinguish themselves at the bar
of their country; because I believe the profession of
the law will be thrown far more open than it is now,
and that people will be much more easily able to become
practitioners in the Supreme Court. For example, we
should have had no Abi'aham Lincoln unless the rule
had been that an examination in law and in the Eng-
lish language was sufficient to admit any man to the
bar; so that the splitter of shingles could carry law
books up into the forest, study law, come down, be
called to the bar, earn money enough to go into public
life, and then, as if Providence had really almost
designed the thing, at the very moment when the great
man was required, forth he stepped, untrusted at first
by large numbers of people ; so much so that when he
came into New York an enormous crowd was assembled,
but not one hat was lifted, except very few, to the
president; not one voice cried " God bless you " ; there
was not one cheer, because the citizens of New York
were opposed to the party which he represented ; and
yet, when he died, he was admitted to have been one
of the greatest men of the times, and his death was
deplored, not only in the United States, but also in
many other nations. It was only by opening all these
offices to their great men in America that such men as
Lincoln, Grant, Sherman, Garfield, Cleveland, every
one of them, were brought forward, and without these
chances they never could have attained to the positions
which they occupied. I think, therefore, that we, in
arriving at the conclusion which, I am certain, will be
adopted of referring this to a committee, have ensured
to the future of Australasia a prosperity which it
could never otherwise have enjoyed, and I believe
that if this motion of mine had unfortunately been
ruled to be out of order, if the matter had been
stopped, discontent would have arisen from one end
of the country to another, that it would be understood
that the wrong thing had been done, that a mistake
had been made. There would have been general
regi-et, and the Constitution would have been sent
back to be amended in that direction in which we are
now taking it —that is, the Convention would again
have had remitted to it what will probably now pass.
I cannot tell the exact form in which it will pass ; but I
have no doubt whatever that it will be of great and
undoubted utility, and will be received with gratitude.
Last night when I received an invitation to the banquet
that is to be given to the members of the Convention
when our sittings are over, I actually trembled to think
that perhaps we shall not deserve this festivity, and
that we shall have to go back without anything satis-
factory being concluded, or any great scheme sketched
out. Now, I feel sure that by giving and taking, by
joining together to get the best possible thing we can
we shall succeed in giving to Australasia a federation


which will be an honor to this Convention and a blessing
to the people of this country, and it is in that hope that
I move that the resolution be adopted by the Committee.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I think that the pro-
posal brought forward by the hon, member, Sir George
Grey, deserves much more consideration than will be
given to it if it is put to the vote at once. The con-
stitutions of the different states in the confederation
may be of very great importance to the permanency of
the federation. I do not think that any of us desire
to hand over to the federal parliament the power to
interfere with the constitutions of the different states ;
but at the same time the federal government, the con-
federation generally, is most materially interested in
the constitutions of the states. As I pointed out this
morning, a state might cease to have representative
government, and might no longer be entitled to have
a voice in the confederation. I am not sufficiently
familiar with the details of the constitutions of the
different colonies at the present time to remember
precisely what are the conditions under which they may
be changed; but, so far as I know, each colony has the
power within its constitution to change that constitu-
tion, except, of course, that they cannot change it by
throwing off their allegiance to the Crown ; and they
cannot get rid of her Majesty’s representative. That
would be a revolutionary act.
Dr. Cockburn : And that bills are reserved for her
Majesty’s assent!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : It may be so in some
cases, and we know that several bills have been reserved
in practice ; but that has been not because the consti-
tution required them to be reserved, but because they
contained provisions to which the Governor was not
authorised to consent.
Dr. Cockburn ; I think it is laid down in the con-
stitution acts !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : The constitutions vary
in that particular. I certainly agree with those who
have said that after the establishment of a federal
constitution in Australia there should be no necessity
to refer to the British Parliament to do anything for
Australia, either in changing a constitution or in any-
thing else. I think the constitution will be by no
means an adequate one for the purpose for which it is
to be designed if we shall have occasion to refer to
the Parliament of the United Kingdom to do anything
for us. The matter of changing the state constitu-
tions, however, is, I think, only remotely connected
with the work we have in hand. I do not think it is
our business to insist upon any particular method by
which those constitutions may be changed. The
American theory is—and I believe that in the
abstract the theory is right—that all constitutions are
the act of the individual members of the community,
and that they delegate their power to the legislature,
and that legislature can only work within the autho-
rity given to it. The English theory, of course, is
different. The Parliament, no matter how it origi-
nated, is a sovereign body, and can do what it likes,
and we in the Australian colonies have proceeded up
to the present time upon the English theory. We
give to our parliaments their legislative powers, and
included amongst them is the power to change their
own constitutions, I do not think we need interfere
with that. The federal constitution ought to contain
provisions prohibiting any state from changing its con-
stitution under its existing powers in particular direc-
tions, in such a direction, for instance, as to make it
unfit to be a member of the commonwealth of states.
I do not think that the framers of the constitution ought
to be called upon to lay down any particular lines to be
followed by a state desiring to change its constitution ;
but any provision of that kind should be of a negative
rather than of a positive character. I have little doubt
that before long the constitutions of many of these
colonies will be changed, and very likely they will be
changed in the direction indicated, but not put into so
many words, by the hon. member, Sir George Grey, by
the American system of having a convention, elected by
the people for that duty only, and dissolving after it
has performed its duty. But that is not the question
at the present time. The only question before us is
whether an instruction of this kind should be adopted
now to guide the committee which is to bring up reso-
lutions. I feel some difficulty about adopting it in its
present form. But, at the same time, lam sure that
the committee cannot bring up an adequate scheme
without dealing with the matter in some way. It is
rather unfortunate that we have not had the proposal in
its present form before us in print. It is that provision
should be made to enable the states to make, vary, or
annul their constitutions. They have constitutions now,
and they have also the power in one way or another
to alter them; but it seems to me that the general
ruling direction which should be given is this: that
provision should be made in the federal constitution to
enable the federal parliament to exercise with respect
to Australia those powers with respect to individual
states which, at the present time, can be exercised only
by the British Parliament. That might not cover all
the ground, but I think it would cover the ground so
far as regards this point. It would be entirely incon-
sistent with the whole theory of what we propose to do
if a state of Australia, desiring to alter its constitution,
had to go past the federal government to the British
Parliament for the ratification of that alteration. That
must be borne in mind. I suggest, for the considera-
tion of the hon. member, Sir George Grey, whether the
proposal is worth insisting on in its present form. I
think, after the discussion which has taken place that
it must be manifest that the members of the committee,
whoever they may be, will have to deal with this
subject, and I think they may be trusted to deal with
it in an adequate manner.
Mr. McMILLAN: It may have been very well, as
a matter of courtesy to the delegate who moved this
resolution, to allow a certain amount of discussion ;
but it seems to me that we are now brought face to face
with the possibility of leaving only a short time within
which to complete our labours; and it seems to me,
when we have such an enormous amount of labour to
complete, that the introduction of extraneous matter
such as this proposal seems to consist of, means the
entering upon matter which will delay the work of the
Convention. I would remind hon. members that to-
morrow week will be the day before Easter, and it is
probable we may have to complete the whole of our
labours in the next few days. It seems to me that it
would be far better if the hon. gentleman would with-
draw the resolution altogether after the discussion
which has taken place, and let us go on, immediately,
with the appointment of the committee.
Sir JOHN BRAY : I presume the hon. member,
Sir George Grey, will have no objection to withdraw
the amendment if it is understood that the committee
will give their attention to the point raised by him ;
but I agree with the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith,
that we must, to some extent, contemplate the possi-
bility of the alteration of the constitution acts of the
different colonies for the purposes of federation, if for
nothing else. It has been not only hinted at, but
deliberately stated, that there can be no possible
objection to the people of the different colonies electing
their own lieutenant-governors, and if we are going
to do that there ought to be some provision to that
effect in the federal constitution act. Ido not wish to
press the matter too harshly if it is understood that
the Committee will agree to the suggestion. To save
time, I would ask the hon. member, Sir George Grey,
if he objects to accept an amendment to strike out
the words which he proposes to insert —
to make, vary, or annul their form of constitution,
with the object of substituting the words :
to make such amendments in their constitution acts as may
be necessary for the purposes of federation.


If the hon. member, Sir George Grey, will agree that
provision should be made to enable the people of each
state to make such amendments in their constitution
act as may be necessary for the purposes of federation,
it will be the means of bringing the matter immediately
under the notice of the committee which will frame
the resolutions, or whatever they may be, with regard
to the parliament or executive. The matter will thus
not be overlooked. I think the federal constitution
act ought to provide—if we think that such a pro-
vision should be made—that each colony should elect
its own governor.
Mr. McMillan : That is in contravention of our
present arrangements !
Sir JOHN BRAY ; Some alteration must be neces-
sary. It is clear that the governor of each colony
cannot occupy the same position under federation
which he occupies now. The governor-general will
have to discharge some of the duties now intrusted
to the governor, and whether we provide for it or not,
it is clear that some alteration will have to be made
which will change the duties of the lieutenant-governor
of each province, and make them different from what
their duties are as governors of a province at the
present time. If it is understood that the committee
will consider this matter, it might answer all the pur-
poses required if the hon. member would withdraw
the motion. If he does not, I shall be happy to sup-
port it, if some such amendment as that which I have
indicated is agreed to, by which the federal constitu-
tion act will only provide such authority as may be
necessary to enable the different colonies to alter their
constitutions for the purpose of giving effect to the
federation proposals.
Mr. WRIXON : I think the hon. member, Sir
George Grey, ought to attach weight to the view
which has just been presented, and to accept the more
general form in which the last speaker asks him to
put the proposal. There are many reasons for that;
but there is one reason in particular. I think the hon.
member will be satisfied if the subject is considered
by the Committee, and is afterwards dealt with by
the Convention. If we were to adopt it exactly as
he proposes it, we should be tied to the particular
means which he suggests, namely, that the majority of
voters
Mr. Deakin : That has been dropped 1
Mr. WRIXOIST: Well, then, I think that what has
been proposed by the hon. member, Sir John Bray,
embraces everything which Sir George Grey wishes.
It will leave the matter open for the consideration
of the Committee, and we shall not tie our hands in
any way.
Mr. MACDONALD-PATERSON; That is not the
point at all—that is not the object we had in view in
discussing the matter before the luncheon hour. The
amendment of the constitution acts of the different
colonies is not for the purposes of federation; it is for
the purpose of working their own several and distinct
governments. Surely the hon. member, Sir John Bray,
is under a misapprehension, or I am under a great cloud
of misapprehension myself.
Mr. J. FORREST : I should like to point out that
we have already agreed to the Ist resolution ;
That the powers and privileges and territorial rights of the
several existing colonies shall remain intact.
Now it is proposed, it seems to me, and for the first time
during this Convention, that the distinctive states shall
be subordinate to the central government. I have not
heard, during the debates which have taken place, any
mention of the subordination of the states to the central
government, and this proposal would, I think, make
them altogether subordinate so far as their constitu-
tions would be in some way dependent upon the action
of the dominion government. I notice, in the Canadian
Constitution, that power was given to the municipal
governments to amend their constitution. One of the
powers reserved to the provinces was “the amendment
from time to time, notwithstanding anything in this
act, of the constitution of the provinces, except as
regards the office of lieutenant-governor.” That was,
no doubt, necessary in the case of the Canadian Con-
stitution, because all the powers that were not given
specially to the province were reserved to the central
government. But in our case the opposite is proposed.
We propose that specific powers shall be given to the
central government, and that all the other powers
shall remain in the states or provinces. In most of the
colonies I believe power is given already to amend
their constitutions in any way which may be desired.
In the colony I represent we have power to amend
our Constitution in any way we like by an absolute
majority, and the Governor has power to assent to the
amendment of the Constitution, with the exception of
one or two particulars in respect to which he has to
reserve bills for her Majesty’s assent. Those particulars
have reference to the civil list and to the aborigines.
In all other matters we can amend our Constitution in
any way we choose, without any reference to the
Imperial Government. As evidence of that, I may
mention that during the last session—the first session
under our Constitution—we amended the Constitution
by a simple statute in the same way as we would any
other law.
Mr. Kingston : Was it not reserved ?
Mr. J. FORREST : It was not reserved. There was
no occasion for reserving it. There is no objection, as
far as I can see, to the introduction of the resolution
of the hon. member, Sir George Grey ; but I cannot
see that it carries us any further than we are at
present. We have the power already, and, as far as
I know, we do not wish to give up the power, to amend
our constitutions in any way we choose. I think it is
a pity that this discussion should go on. There seems
to be nothing very much in the proposal. The only
point that occurs to me is this : that under a federal
form of government there might be some difficulty in
those cases in which the governor is directed to reserve
certain measures for her Majesty’s assent as to whether
he should still do so, or whether the assent should be
given by the governor-general. There seems to be some
point in that, but it is a detail which I have no doubt
cun be worked out. Otherwise I can see nothing in
the resolution which gives us anything more than at
any rate the colony I represent has already ; that is,
the power to amend its Constitution in any way it
chooses.
Sir GEORGE GREY: I wish to answer the last hon.
member, who has made a very interesting speech, but
who, I think, has misunderstood the subject in part.
In point of fact, what I am aiming at is this: I believe
that in the old constitutions, and in some of the new
constitutions, a machinery has been set up which virtu-
ally takes all liberty from the people, or at any rate
takes a very great amount of liberty from the people.
We are told that in Western Australia they have the
power of altering their own Constitution. But they
can do that only with the consent of a council nomi-
nated for six years. That is no liberty at all to the
people. I believe that in this colony there is a nomi-
nated upper house and plural voting. There is, prob-
ably, plural voting to a great extent in Western
Australia, It will take, perhaps, a term of many
years to work off those burdens which are imposed
upon the people—a term of very many years I should
think—whereas at the moment when you are framing
a new constitution, seeing that in every federal consti-
tution certain provisions are made for the government
of the states, I ask that a similar provision should be
made for the government of the states here. I deny
that, as an hon. member said, this is any interference
with state constitutions by this body. That is an
absolute misunderstanding of the case. What we
propose is to authorise the people of the states, if they
arc dissatisfied with their form of government, to alter


it. We have been entirely misunderstood on that
subject. This Convention is not asked to exercise the
smallest interference ; but surely, at the moment when
you say you are about to confer great benefits on all
Australasia, it is not too much to say to those people
who may feel that they are suffering under a form of
constitution which is not liberal, and does not give fair
play to the intellect and the energies of all its inhabi-
tants, that if the great majority of the people of the
state choose to interfere with their constitution and
give themselves a more liberal one, they shall have
the power to do so. I deny that I have proposed
any interference at aH, or that I have asked hon.
members of this assembly to do anything which they
ought not to do. On the contrary, I have besought
them not to interfere with the powers of the general
legislature or with the powers of the states in the
manner I saw they were disposed to do, but to leave
them absolute liberty. I say that, at this time of
giving freedom to all Australia, we should tell the
people of the states that if they please to alter their
form of state government they may do it themselves,
without any reference to the British Parliament—
without any reference to the British Crown necessarily
—but entirely of their own free will make such altera-
tions as they believe will lead to their happiness.
How that can be confused with an arbitrary interfer-
ence with the states I cannot understand. I believe
the request I have made is for the happiness of the
whole of Australasia, and I ask for no interference
whatever with the powers of the states, or with the
powers of the general government. I say give them
all power to work out their own happiness. Why
we should deliberately refuse to give so great a boon
to the people of this country, when we are authorised
by our position to give it, when we have the right to
give it, I cannot possibly understand; and on that
point I do not think I ought to give way. If hon.
members are determined not to do it, let them by
their votes record that such is the case. Let it
be seen what our varied opinions are, and then if
it be necessary to call another Convention together,
let the people decide whether they will send to that
Convention men who are willing to do this for them,
or whether they choose to say that we were wrong—to
discard us, and to make provision without entailing
on themselves and their children for years to come the
constitutions that they now have. Let any one look
at the difficulty there has been in altering the House
of Peers at home —a body who are anxious not to
offend the public there, because they would lose posi-
tion and' credit, and possibly lose their privileges alto-
gether. Here, on the contrary, the nominated houses
have no hereditary claims of that kind. Having been
selected by the ministry of the day, they cannot, I
fancy, come to the consideration of the subject with
that cool, unembarrassed, totally unselfish view with
which they ought to come to it. I admit they have
conferred great benefits on this country. I admit
there are amongst them very estimable and good men ;
but I firmly believe that if the people of New South
Wales had had the powers that they may get under
the federal constitution, still greater benefits would
have been conferred on the country, that it would have
still further advanced, that there would have been
greater openings for the whole of its population. I
think we ought not to give way on this subject until
it has been decided by the votes of the Convention
that they will not do that which we ask them to do.
I feel very unwilling to at all retreat from the position
I have taken up. I would far rather be defeated and
be told that I am wrong, and remain under that
defeat perhaps some years—very likely not living to see
the change of public opinion; but I wrnuld rather go
down to posterity with the fact recorded that I have
enunciated these views, and have adhered to them, than
give them up, and merely obtain quiet at the present
time, when in my own inner heart I should know
that I was sacrificing the interests of all Australasia
• —not of one state only, but of every state —in not
saying that the people of the state if they wish to
change their constitution should be authorised so to
do by the federal constitution. Supposing all that I
ask were agreed to, what would be the result 1 The
federal constitution must still go to the people, and
they would not assent to it if they disapproved of what
I propose. They would reject it. It would not be
imposed upon them. But on the other hand, if you
do not do this, and they are burning with anxiety to
gain these benefits, you would send them a constitution
under which they could not get them. You say posi-
tively that they shall not have them. I say that the
infinitely preferable course is to do justice to every one
of the states, and to allow every one the liberties which
I ask for on their behalf, and which I believe to be
for their benefit.
Sir John Bray : Perhaps I may be permitted to say
that I indicated an amendment subject to the approval
of the hon. member, Sir George Grey. I understood
from what he said to me that he virtually approved of
it; but he did-not say anything about it in his speech,
and consequently it was not put. I think it will be
convenient to hon. members if it is put now with the
consent of the Convention.
Mr. Deakin : I and other hon. members were under
the impression that the amendment had been put. If
I had known that it had not been put, I should have
claimed my right to say something on the question.
The Chairman: If there is no objection, I shall
adopt the course suggested by the hon. member, Sir
John Bray. Of course, as hon. members know, it is
out of order ; but we are not pursuing strictly the
rules of parliament. It is proposed by the hon. member,
Sir John Bray, to amend the motion by omitting the
words “vary or annul its constitution,” with a view
to insert in lieu thereof the words “ such amendments
in its constitution as may be necessary for the purposes
of the federation.”
Amendment agreed to ; motion, as amended, agreed
to.
Resolved: That provision should be made in the federal con-
stitution which will enable each state to make such amend-
ments as may be necessary for the purposes of the federation.
Mr. THYNNE : I rise with some amount of diffi-
dence to ask the Convention to adopt the resolution
of which I have given notice. The form in which I
propose to move it, however, will be slightly varied on
account of the position it will necessarily take upon
the .paper should I be fortunate enough to induce the
Convention to adopt it. I move :
That the following stand as resolution 4 of part il:-“Thata
system be established for submitting amendments of the con-
stitution for the approval of the electors of the several states,
and for prescribing the necessary majorities.”
The resolution, in the form in which I gave notice of it,
provided for a reference to conventions ; but 1 think it
would be better if the resolution were to go untram-
melled, and without any matter of detail, leaving to
the select committee to be appointed to deal with cm-
stitutional questions the arrangement of details for the
working of the system. I do not think that in this
Convention the proposal to refer amendments of the
constitution to the direct vote of the people is one that
will require very much advocacy on my part, for I shall
be greatly mistaken unless I find that a great majority
of the members of this Convention are in favour of some
such course being adopted. Let me shortly state a few
of the reasons why I think the resolution should be
adopted. Any constitution we draw will have to be
adopted by the whole of the people ; it will virtually
be a constitution rising and coming from them, and I
think the people will be much more satisfied if they
find that there is a limit to the powers they are giving
in the commission to their several legislatures, and
that they themselves must be again consulted before
any change is made in the authority they give to the


legislatures. I think the proposal will be of a highly
popular character, and that it will tend to excite in the
people of Australia great enthusiasm in favour of the
new constitution, and that I think hon. members will
agree with me is necessary to its successful establish-
ment. I think also that while we may find individuals
having objections to particular clauses of the bill, a
great many of these will have their objections obviated
and removed if they find that this valuable protection
is given to them against unnecessary or hasty changes.
This is a provision which in some form or other exists
in the two principal federations of the world at the
present moment. I content myself with these few
remarks, knowing that at this stage of the proceedings
of the Convention long speeches are out of place. I
trust that the proposal will meet with hearty support,
and that it will, at any rate, receive the careful con-
sideration, should it be referred to them, of the select
committee it is proposed to appoint.
Mr. GORDON : If the resolution of the hon. mem-
ber, Mr, Thynne, is intended as a mere instruction to
the committee that this matter shall receive considera-
tion, I shall support it; but if it be an absolute
committal of the Convention to the system of refer-
endum, or some such system, I cannot support it
without further consideration. If it be merely an
instruction to the committee, then I think no harm
will be done in passing it.
Dr. COCKBURN : As I understand the proposal
of the hon. member, he wishes to lay down the principle
that a constitution cannot be amended without the
several states of the federal parliament being consulted
.—that the federal parliament itself shall not have
sufficient power to amend a constitution without the
citizens of the various states being consulted in some
way or other. I understand that to be the principle
the hon. member wishes to lay down ; and I think it
would be well to embody it in these resolutions merely
foreshadowing what is meant in a vague way. The
principle sought to be affirmed is, briefly, that the
citizens of the various states shall be in some way
consulted before an amendment is made in the
constitution.
Mr. WRIXON : I do not attach too much weight
to these resolutions, because I apprehend that the com-
mittee will consider them, and that they will afterwards
come up for determination by the Convention. But
if this resolution were carried as it now stands, it would
amount to an express direction that the electors should
determine upon any change of constitution. Ido not
know whether the hon. member intends that or not;
but if that be not intended, I submit to the hon. member
that if he omits the words “by the electors,” it will
be merely a species of direction to the committee. On
the other hand, it would be a serious matter for us to
vote now that any change made in any of the constitu-
tions of the states must be sanctioned by the electors,
because it will then be simply a question of whether it
shall be sanctioned by direct referendum or by conven-
tion. If we do not mean that, the words to which I
refer should be struck out.
Captain RUSSELL: I think it is a great pity that in
these resolutions there is not a little more precision.
I confess that with regard to this and the preceding
resolution, I am very much in the dark as to what they
really mean. But, taking the resolution in the parti-
cular form in which the hon. member proposes to move
it, it amounts to this : that the people of the various
provinces may at any time by universal will, without
any restraint whatever, say that the constitution shall
be altered.
Mr. Thynne ; No !
Captain RUSSELL: Then it is a great pity that
there is not a little more precision in the wording of
the resolution. That is undoubtedly the way in which
I read it, and I should be very loath to give affirmation
to such a principle. I believe it would be pernicious
to the last degree. The resolution ought to be framed
with sufficient distinctness to enable us all to clearly
understand its meaning. I contend that as this resolu-
tion is now worded, there is nothing to prevent the
absolute will of the people, which may be swayed by a
sudden gust of passion, from altering a constitution
which may have been framed with great care. These
changes may be effected so indefinitely and perpetually,
that practically there will be no constitution whatever.
We must be careful to guard against that. If there
be any such intention as that I now indicate underlying
this resolution, I certainly shall vote against it.
Mr. THYNNE : I intended that no amendment of
the constitution should be carried into operation unless
approved of by the people. I am prepared to leave the
question open to the committee in the manner sug-
gested by the hon. member, Mr. Gordon, that is, as
there is a general idea that some scheme of the kind
is necessary, we recommend the matter to the careful
consideration of the committee.
Mr. PLAYFORD : Do I understand that the hon.
member withdraws it 1
Mr. Thynne ; No !
Mr. PLAYFORD : Then we ought to consider what
we are about. This proposes that the people alone
should have a voice in the alteration of the constitu-
tion. We must remember that we are divided into
states, and surely the states should have a voice in the
matter. In the American Constitution, when the Con-
gress and Senate pass an alteration of the Constitu-
tion, it has to be referi’ed to the people and the states,
and a majority of both must be obtained. If that will
be done in this case, well and good; but we must
remember that the draftsman will be bound to make
provision in the bill for an alteration of the constitu-
tion, and we can then discuss the question.
Dr. Cockburn : They omitted to make such a pro-
vision in the Canadian act !
Mr. PLAYFORD : They made a mistake there ;
but we are not likely to do so. I think it would be
better to withdraw the amendment.
Mr. DEAKIN: Having expressed myself at con-
siderable length on this question at the conference
last year, I do not think it is necessary or desirable
at this stage to repeat the arguments, which appear
to me unanswerable, in favour of this course. What
the hon. member proposes is not that the power of
altering the constitution should be vested in the elec-
tors, to be exercised by them at any time, but simply
that there should be no power of altering the consti-
tution without the express and explicit consent of the
people of the various states. That is what the hon.
member says, and I think we will all say the same ;
we might even go further, and require that the federal
constitution shall not only be submitted to the legis-
latures, but, if possible, shall be submitted directly to
the people of the several states.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I am very much of the
same opinion as the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, in
what he has just said, but it does not follow that we
ought, without further discussion, to lay down this
proposition as a rule which the committee must follow,
and prepare a bill on these lines. I think, with the
hon. member, Mr. Playford, that this matter has not
been sufficiently discussed or considered by the Con-
vention to justify us in giving such an instruction to
the committee. It is very likely that the committee
will follow this line. Everything else before us has
been thoroughly discussed; we know exactly what we
have done. We have laid down certain lines to be
followed by the committee; but this important ques-
tion has not been sufficiently considered. I suggest to
the hon. member that he should not press the resolution.
Sir JOHN DOWNER: I have been taking an
active part in advocating what are called state rights,
and we came to the conclusion to send that question
generally to a committee without binding their hands
too much. It seems to be rather a pity to pass this
resolution, seeing the course which we have already


adopted. I quite agree with the hon. member, that in
all probability something like what he proposes will
have to be done. State rights will certainly have to
he conserved, and, above all, that right which goes to
the root of all things—that is, the power of altering
the constitution. But supposing that some other mode
occurs to the committee, and they wish to recommend
the Convention to adopt that mode, it will be a pity
if we have to begin our labours when we reassemble
by rescinding a previous resolution. I agree with Sir
Samuel Griffith, that as we have left the matters
generally to the committee, without any specific direc-
tions, we should leave this as one of the subjects with
which they must deal.
Mr. GILLIES : My difficulty is in interpreting this
resolution. It appears that the question of the altera-
tion of the constitution is to be left to a body of men
chosen by the electors.
Mr. Deakin : No. Those words are struck out !
Mr. Fitzgerald : There is no mention of the word
Convention !
Mr. GILLIES : I am afraid that will not get over
the difficulty. Who is to submit the question for the
approval of the electors of the several states ? It
should be by some recognised body—the parliament!
Mr. Tiiynne : The parliament, of course !
Mr. GILLIES : Everything is of course; but this
motion does not say so. How are the proposals to be
submitted ? Are they to be submitted in detail for the
electors of the various states to vote on them? Very
likely there will be a whole series of proposals, and the
electors would not be in a position to say “yes” or “no ”
to each proposal. It would be impossible. We have
heard of the referendum ; but that would be a question
distinctly submitted upon which the people could say
“ yes ” or “no ” ; but if we are to have a whole series
of alterations in the constitution in a number of
important particulars, how could they be submitted
separately to the people in such a way that they could
say “yes” or “no” to them? The proposal is full of
trouble and difficulty, I can understand that gentle-
men who have thought over this matter believe that
there is no trouble in the way, but I contend that it
would be impossible to carry out the proposal here
made. I can understand that we should provide in
our constitution that important alterations in it should
only take place by the electors determining to appoint
certain persons who are to consider the various ques-
tions, and whose decision might afterwards be referred
to some other body. It will be impracticable, however,
to carry out this proposal to refer the whole general
question to the electors. I hope that, instead of passing
this resolution, we shall leave the question open to be
discussed by the select committee we are about to
appoint, without tying their hands in this way. The
committee will then be able to submit proposals which
will meet generally the views of hon. members.
Mr. THYNNE: In view of the expressions of opinion
from several prominent members of the Convention,
and feeling assured that this question will receive full
attention, I am quite willing to withdraw the resolution
after the satisfactory discussion which it has evoked.
Resolution, by leave, withdrawn.
Mr. CLARK rose to move :
The judicial power of the federation shall be vested in one
supreme court, and such inferior courts as the federal parlia-
ment shall from time to time establish ; and the federal
supreme court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine
appeals from all final judgments, decrees, and orders of the
highest court of resort in each of the colonies; and the judg-
ment of the federal supreme court shall in all cases in which
imperial interests or the construction of an act of the Imperial
Parliament affecting the rights or property of persons resident
in all parts of the empire are not involved, be final and
conclusive.
He said: When I addressed the Committee this morn-
ing on the subject of the judiciary, I said that if it
were understood that the whole question of the estab-
lishment of a federal judiciary was to be considered by
a committee who should have a free hand to bring up
any proposal they thought best, I would not press my
resolution, but would leave the matter to be dealt with
by the committee. But I wish it to be distinctly
agreed that I withdraw my resolution on that under-
standing, because the resolution as it stands provides
for a court of appeal only, and I want much more than
that. I want a whole system of federal judiciary, and
if it is understood that the committee will deal with
that question, and make such recommendations as they
think fit on the subject, I will leave the resolution as
it stands, and withdraw my amendment.
Mr. Deakin: Before the hon. member withdraws
his resolution, I should like to suggest
The Chairman ; Perhaps the hon. gentleman had
better move his resolution, so that 1 can state the
question, and thus enable the hon. member, Mr.
Deakin, to address the Committee on the subject.
Question proposed.
Mr. DEAKIN : The subject appears to me to be
one of so much importance as to merit, not reference
to a general committee, but the appointment of a
separate committee for its special consideration; and
I would suggest that when the hon, member, Mr.
Suttor, moves for the appointment of the two com-
mittees already indicated, one of which is to deal with
finance, taxation, and trade, and the other with the
questions of constitutional machinery and the distribu-
tion of powers and functions, he should at the same
time move the appointment of a third committee,
which might consist of the attorney-generals and other
legal members of the Convention, which should specially
consider this most important question. It seems to
me to be of such magnitude as to deserve a special legal
committee for its consideration, instead of being dealt
with merely as one question among many referred to two
committees which have not this subject specially men-
tioned in the reference proposed to be made to them.
Resolution, by leave, withdrawn.
Resolutions reported and agreed to as follows :
That in order to establish and secure an enduring founda-
tion for the structure of a federal government, the principles
embodied in the resolutions following be agreed to :
(1.) That the powers and privileges and territorial rights
of the several existing colonies shall remain intact,
except in respect to such surrenders as may be agreed
upon as necessary and incidental to the power and
authority of the National Federal Government.
(2.) No new state shall be formed by separation from
another state, nor shall any state be formed by the
junction of two or more states or parts of states,
without the consent of the legislatures of the states
- concerned, as well as of the federal parliament.
(3.) That the trade and intercourse between the federated
colonies, whether by means of land carriage or coastal
navigation, shall be absolutely free.
(4.) That the power and authority to impose customs duties
and duties of excise upon goods the subject of customs
duties and to offer bounties shall be exclusively lodged
in the federal government and parliament, subject to
such disposal of the revenues thence derived as shall be
agreed upon.
(5.) That the military and naval defence of Australia shall
be intrusted to federal forces, under one command.
(6.) That provision should be made in the Federal Constitu-
tion which will enable each state to make such amend-
ments in its constitution as may be necessary for the
purposes of the federation. , . _
Subject to these and other necessary conditions, this Con-
vention approves of the framing of a federal constitution which
shall establish, — ,
(1.) A parliament, to consist of a senate and a house oi repre-
sentatives, the former consisting of an equal number of
members from each colony, to be elected by a system
which shall provide for the periodical retirement of one-
third of the members, so securing to the body itself a
perpetual existence combined with definite responsibility
to the electors, the latter to be elected by districts
formed on a population basis, and to possess the sole
power of originating all bills appropriating revenue or
imposing taxation.
(2.) A judiciary, consisting of a federal supreme court, wnicn
shall constitute a high court of appeal for Australia.
(3.) An executive, consisting of a governor-general, and such
persons as may from time to time be appointed as his
advisers.


APPOINTMENT OF COMMITTEES.
Mr. SUTTOR rose to move :
(1.) That a committee he appointed to deal with the finance,
taxation, and trade regulations, with power to report its con-
clusions as soon as practicable to this Convention.
(2.) That each colony choose its own member for such com-
mittee—one member from each colony.
He said : Understanding that it is the wish of the
Convention that the various matters embodied in the
resolutions which have been passed should be dealt
with by committees, I have placed this and the following
resolution on the paper in order that the different
matters may be so dealt with. I think both resolu-
tions might be taken as matters of form, seeing that
the Convention is unanimous in the object desired. I
understand that the hon. member, Mr. Barton, intends
to move an amendment with the view of giving more
complete powers to the committees.
Mr. ABBOTT ; I second the resolution, but I would
like to point out that I think the names of the com-
mittee should be mentioned, so that there might be a
record in the Convention as to who the committee
were.
Question proposed.
Mr. BARTON : It struck me in reading the resolu-
tion which has been moved by the hon. member, Mr.
Suttor, that perhaps it was not sufficiently specific for
the purpose, and I thought it just as well to sketch out
some resolutions which might more expressly define
what the object and work of these committees is to be,
and which might be adopted as an amendment upon
the resolutions, though some hon. members will, perhaps,
be able to suggest something more definite. It seems
to me that two committees, as suggested by the hon,
member, will be necessary, though I have heard some
hon. members say that four committees will be required,
but I think that it will not be a wise thing to multiply
the number of committees. It would be a good thing
that a committee should be appointed which will have
the special work of drafting a bill, and it would also
be a good thing, though perhaps it is not necessary to
specifically provide for it, if each delegation in sending
its quota of members to that committee sent some
member to be eligible as a member of a sub-committee,
or in the main committee, to be able to take part in
the drafting of the bill. But I think we have enough
ground-work laid down in the resolutions which have
been passed for any committee which takes into con-
sideration the whole drift of the debate, and the
general opinions expressed, to be in a position to
draft a bill with which we could deal without any
intermediate resolutions; that is, we might take the
suggestions which they will make in the form most
familiar to lawyers, that of a bill, in which, if the com-
mittee are good draftsmen, they will be quite as intelli-
gible as any resolutions would bo. Then it appeared
right that some committee should be appointed upon
matters involved in the resolutions affecting trade and
intercourse, customs and excise duties, and I thought
with the hon. member, Mr. Suttor, that a committee
consisting of one member from each delegation, would
be sufficient to deal with these matters for the purpose
of collecting all necessary information, and of coming
to a conclusion as to what provisions would be neces-
sary in the bill to cover the ground of the resolutions,
and all subsidiary matters. They might place their
conclusions in the hands of the larger committee, from
which a drafting committee might be selected. For
these reasons, I drew up the following resolutions :
(1.) That the resolutions reported to this Convention by
Committee of the Whole be referred to two committees, the
one for consideration of constitutional machinery and the dis-
tribution of functions and powers, the other for consideration
of provisions relating to finance, taxation, and trade regulation;
the first-named committee to consist of two members from each
of the several delegations, the last-named committee to consist
of one member from each. The members to be chosen by the
several delegations.
(2.) That the last-named committee be instructed to specially
Consider resolutions Nos. 3 and 4, on trade and intercourse
and on customs taxation, with a view to their being carried
into effect upon lines just to the several colonies, and that it
be a further instruction to the said committee to lay its con-
clusions before the committee on constitutional machinery,
functions, and powers.
(3.) That upon the result of the deliberation of the said
committees the committee on constitutional machinery, func-
tions, and powers, do prepare and submit to this Convention
a bill for the establishment of a federal constitution, such bill
to be prepared as speedily as is consistent with careful con-
sideration.
In submitting these resolutions, I wish to point out
that it lias been suggested that a committee upon
the question of judiciary should be appointed. That
committee has suggested itself to several very experi-
enced and able members of the Convention; but the
committee upon the constitutional machinery, func-
tions, and powers will no doubt, since they will have
the preparation of the bill in hand, include sufficient
members of the legal profession to be able to throw all
the conclusions on constitutional machinery, including
the judiciary, into proper form. It seems to me that
it would be encumbering the matter to appoint more
than two committees.
Sir John Bray ; Three !
Mr, Playford ; The hon. member had better have
a committee upon the judiciary, and let them draft the
bill !
Mr. BARTON: I should like to hear what is to be
said about that; but if a committee is appointed upon
the judiciary, I do not see why it should not be
appointed as a sub committee of the large committee
on constitutional machinery; and if it were an under-
stood thing that that large committee should appoint
a committee on the judiciary, we might have a com-
mittee consisting of treasurers and ex-treasurers to deal
with the questions of finance and taxation, who would
get all necessary information, and frame what might
seem to them the necessary resolutions, and these they
could place before the large committee. Upon the
reports of these committees a bill might be prepared,
which, I think, might be dealt with without the pre-
liminary discussion of any resolutions, and we should
then have the lions of federation in so narrow a path
that we should be able to concentrate our eneigies
upon their destruction.
Mr. PLA.YFORD: I raise no objections to these
resolutions; but I would suggest that another com-
mittee be appointed to deal with the subject of the
judiciary.
Sir JOHN DOWNER ; I also think that the con-
stitutional committee will have plenty to do, and that
it would be a great assistance to them if they had
another committee to help them on this question of
the judiciary.
The President : I understand that the hon. member,
Mr. Suttor, is willing to accept the amendment of the
hon. member, Mr. Barton,in lieu of his own resolutions?
Mr. Suttor : Certainly.
The President : I shall then submit the amendment
as the resolution.
Question proposed.
Colonel SMITH: Whilst concurring with the pro-
posals generally, I should have been glad if there had
been more committees. Both the proposers of the
resolutions, the hon. members, Mr. Barton and Mr.
Suttor, agree to the appointment of two committees,
which simply absorb twenty-one members of the Con-
vention out of forty-five. I think we should give the
remaining twenty-four something to do. The object,
as I understand it, is to appoint upon committees
those who are best likely to understand the subjects
with which they have to deal. I find that twenty-
four members of the Convention, 1 do not know for
what length of time, will absolutely have nothing to
do, whilst the other twenty-one will be sitting on
committees, and deciding the questions which are
brought before them. I have thought it would have
been wiser if we had divided the whole body into
committees to consider the various branches of the


subject which have to be dealt with, and if their
various reports could be submitted to the Con-
vention. How lopg are these twenty-one members
appointed upon committees, fourteen upon one, and
seven upon the other, to be occupied in their delibera-
tion 1 I venture to say that the consideration of one
of these questions will occupy a very considerable
time. Are hon. members who are not included upon
those committees to wait whilst the reports are being
drawn up, and whilst questions, the consideration of
which may occupy several days, are being determined 1
I think it would have been wiser to have divided the
Convention into more committees. I intended to have
brought forward a proposal with regard to finance ; but
as I find the unanimity of the Convention is so thorough
on the subject, I do not think it is necessary. It was
my intention to propose the appointment of a com-
mittee to deal with that subject. We have the ques-
tion of finance, taxation, and trade regulations to be
dealt with by one committee. I do not know who the
gentlemen are who are prepared to deal with those
three subjects; but I think it would have been wiser
if we could have separated them, if we could have
classed finance and taxation together, and divided the
remaining subjects amongst other committees. For
instance, I submit, with all due deference, that the
question of drawing up a constitution ought to be
settled in Committee; that the question of the Privy
Council, which the hon. member, Sir John Downer,
ventured to solve, ought to be a separate subject dealt
with, wholly and solely, by members distinguished in
the particular profession which has to deal with it.
Sir Samuel Griffith : No !
Colonel SMITH: I thought the hon. gentleman
would have been one of the first, knowing so much
about the subject, and being connected with a distin-
guished profession, to agree to a proposal of that
description.
Sir Samuel Griffith : I think we want the assist-
ance of laymen !
Colonel SMITH ; 1 am sure, so far as this Conven-
tion is concerned, that we shall be satisfied if the whole
body is divided into committees, of which the Presi-
dent and Vice-President should be ex-officio members,
so that we might have the benefit of their advice upon
the whole of them, I certainly hope that over one-
half of the members of the Convention will not be
left to look on or idle about when they might, in some
way, assist to bring up reports on various subjects.
I have no desire to press the matter unduly, but it
appears to me that two committees of twenty-one
members out of forty-five are altogether insufficient.
I have no desire to move an amendment; I only throw
out the suggestion because I think that the duties
ought to be divided amongst more committees. In
my opinion it would be a wise thing if every member
of the Convention was appointed upon a committee
of some sort or other. We desire to get through the
work, and to have done with it; but if you give one or
two committees too much to do they will have various
difficulties to contend with. If the Convention is not
divided into committees we shall have those members
not included in the committees engaged in criticising
the work done, and that will lead to long debates. If,
however, the various subjects are decided and dealt
with by different committees, our proceedings will be
considerably shortened.
Mr. DEAKIN : I understand the hon, member
from Tasmania, Mr. Clark, intends to move an amend-
ment.
Mr. Clark ; Yes!
Mr. DEAKIN : If the hon. member is prepared
with an amendment with reference to the judiciary
committee, I will leave him to propose it, and to urge
anything that may be necessary on its behalf. I would
point out, however, that we have in this Convention a
considerable number of gentlemen versed in the law,
and it is quite possible that their services on the judi-
ciary committee would be of material service not only
in settling the questions connected with the judiciary,
but also in aiding the general committee on the con-
stitutional machinery in drafting the bill which, under
the resolution, they are asked to bring up. I trust,
therefore, that the hon. member, Mr. Barton, will see
his way to accept the amendment which the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. Clark, is about to propose, giving us a third
committee dealing with that most important branch
of the future federal government which will come
under the control of its judiciary.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Befoi’e the proposal is
formally made with regard to the judiciary committee,
I wish to offer my opinion oh the subject. Ido not
concur in what has been said by the hon. member,
Colonel Smith, to the effect that the matter ought to
be left entirely to lawyers. In my opinion the right
of appeal to her Majesty-in-Council, is a great consti-
tutional matter upon which lawyers are not better
fitted to express an opinion than other persons. In
my humble judgment they are less fitted in some par-
ticulars to express a sound opinion on the subject. I
think also that it will be very difficult to disentangle
this subject from the other constitutional subjects to
be considered by the general committee. I think,
therefore, it would be found to be a more practical and
speedy manner of getting through business if we
intrusted that subject, as has been suggested by the
hon. member, Mr. Barton, to a sub-committee of the
general committee, with the understanding that they
can call to their aid any of the other legal members of
the Convention whom they may think able to give
them assistance. I apprehend that these committees,
although appointed in this formal manner, will not be
hard and fast committees. They will consult with one
another and with their colleagues ; and, practically,
.all the members of the Convention will know what is
going on, and will be able to give their assistance in
bringing matters to a conclusion. My opinion is that
the employment of a third committee, so far from
tending to expedite proceedings, will tend to retard
them.
Mr. PLAYFORD : My opinion is the opposite to
that expressed by the last speaker. I think that the
appointment of committees will tend to quicken our
movements a little. I have thought the matter out,
and I quite agree with the proposal of the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. Barton, that if we meet together, and, instead
of bringing up ordinary formal resolutions as the result
of our labours, bring them up in the form of a bill and
go through them clause by clause, we shall expedite
business. If we bring up from the committees ordinary
resolutions which will be instructions to draftsmen,
we shall have a full debate on all the resolutions so
brought up, in the same way as we have had upon
the resolutions which have already been submitted to
the Convention, and we know what the result has been
already. We shall have the debate over again, and
it will be repeated when the bill is brought up. I
think the suggestion of the hon. member, Mr. Barton,
an exceedingly wise one. I consider that if we
appoint on this committee to consider the judiciary
question a number of able men learned in the law,
although it may be a question upon which every hon.
gentleman might be 'able to form an opinion equally
as well as members of the legal profession, we might
get able lawyers to help us in the drafting of a bill. I
think that with two committees we shall have rather
too few to choose from. The committee dealing with
the machinery of government will have a great deal
of work to do, and we shall not be able to spare out
of that committee hon. members for the purpose of
of drafting the bill. The committee that will have to
look after matters connected with trade and commerce
will find their hands exceedingly full before they have
done with that question, and they will not be able to
spare any of their number. But I think that the
gentlemen appointed to consider this small question


will not take long in coming to a conclusion as to
what they will recommend; and out of that committee
we might be able to choose a few excellent draftsmen,
who will help the other committees, as fast as they
arrive at conclusions, as to what should be included in
the bill; and in a short time we shall be prepared, I
hope, to pass a bill embodying what we unitedly believe
to be best in the interests of the community at large.
Mr. CUTHBERT : I should be very glad if the lion,
member, Mr. Barton, could see his way to extend the
constitution of the committees. I understand that he
proposes to limit the number of committees to two—
one dealing with constitutional machinery and the dis-
tribution of powers and functions in connection thei’e-
with, and the other dealing with finance and trade. I
think that a committee dealing with trade and finance
will have quite enough to do, and that the seven gentle-
men upon whom it is intended that duty shall devolve
will find their time completely occupied. So, also, as
regards the committee on the constitution question.
Why should not the question of the appointment of a
judiciary, which is equally as important as the other
two, be referred to a separate committee? Then,
while the twenty-one gentlemen are engaged on the
two committees, surely out of the remaining members
of the Convention, seven can be selected to deal with
that other subject. I do not agree with the hon, the
Premier of Queensland, that it is a question which
would be better dealt with by non-legal gentlemen than
by legal gentlemen.
Sir Samuel Griffith: I did not say that; 1 am in
favour of a mixed committee !
Mr. CUTHBERT: A fusion, perhaps, of the two
elements would be most advantageous.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Just what I said !
Mr, CUTHBERT; If a third committee be appointed,
consisting, say, of seven members, to deal with the com-
position and appointment of a judiciary, I think to that
committee might also be intrusted the duty of drafting
the bill. I believe that the gentlemen who will be
selected for that committee will, in all probability, be
most fitted for that work, and with three committees
the whole of the work would be well apportioned, and
we should be able to bring our deliberations to a con-
clusion far sooner than if the work were distributed
between two committees. For these reasons I support
the opinion of the hon. member, Colonel Smith, namely,
that instead of there being two committees, the work
ought to be divided between three.
Mr. WRIXON : I think there ought to be a com-
mittee of lawyers —call it judicial or whatever term
you wish to apply to it; but I quite agree that lawyers
should not determine matters.
Mr. Clark : They should report to the other com-
mittees !
Mr, WRIXOX: There are many questions con-
nected with this subject which only lawyers understand,
and they alone really know what it means. Therefore,
I think it is important that they should be specified in
a committee, so as to collect information and make
recommendations to the other committees. With
regard to the drafting of a bill, as the hon. and learned
member, Sir Samuel Griffith, said, any of us could be
called in to give an opinion ; but I think that the work
will be better performed if you organise a small com-
mittee of lawyers, on whom you cast the duty of
reporting, to whichever committee will have the final
settling of the bill, on the difficult legal matters which
are involved.
Mr. DIBBS : I should like to point out to the Con-
vention that for the last three or four dayswe have been
discussing, in a very loose way, certain principles, and
up to this time there has been no agreement on any one
principle presented to us. We were told that we were
just discussing this matter in a very informal manner,
and that committees would be appointed who, having
in view the various opinions of hon. members who
have spoken, would sit and bring up reports embody-
ing certain principles to be thoroughly discussed here.
I know that other hon, members besides myself have
refrained from taking part in the discussion because
we looked forward to the time when certain resolutions
would be the outcome of the labours of the Committee
—certain cardinal points and principles laid down, on
which there would be a common agreement. I think it
is quite time to talk about having a bill framed when
the Convention, in Committee of the Whole, shall
agree on certain principles which shall be brought out
from the labours of the committee who will report. In
his proposal the hon. and learned member, Mr. Barton,
is departing from the tacit agreement arrived at, which
was that we were to say as little as possible when these
matters were put in an informal manner before us, and
were to wait to have them thrashed out when reports
of committees were submitted to us, and we could agree
on principles which would be a guide for the committee
who ultimately would frame the bill. It is apparent
to those who are looking on that there is a desire to
hasten the proceedings of this Convention. We have
sat here patiently for three weeks ; but if we want to
make good and permanent work, and to accomplish the
object for which we met, we must be prepared to go
slowly and surely, and make a very sound structure as
the result of our labours ; but the proposition of the
hon. and learned member, Mr. Barton, is taking away
from us the agreement entered into, which was that cer-
tain lines should be drawn up in committee, and that
afterwards we should discuss the bill itself. If we had
started in the first instance with the bill, however loosely
drawn or informal-—a mere skeleton of a bill on which
we might have built up something—we should have
been further on than we are now. In the intense
anxiety to close the labours of the Convention there is
a risk of our not making a permanent structure; and
I say again, that if these committees reported on
certain leading principles, and put before us certain
conclusions upon which we could agree, having agreed
upon those points we should have material largely ready
for the framing of a bill. The picture would to a large
extent be painted, and it would only require the framing
of the bill in the necessary legal language, to make
a tolerably perfect measure upon which we could agree.
With regard to the remarks of the hon. and learned
member, Sir Samuel Griffith, I think it well to have
lawyers to deal with the judiciary question, but well
also to have a fair mixture of the victims of lawyers
to watch and see that the result of their labours will
not be to inflict burdens on the people. Lawyers are
all very w T ell in their places, but I never knew a lawyer
to advocate any legislation to reduce the cost of litiga-
tion to the people of the land. Let the lawyers by all
means give the benefit of their legal knowledge ; but
let the laymen who know something about law, and
who support the legal establishments in the various
colonies, have a little voice in the common-sense part
of the business.
Mr. MUNRO : I think my hon. friend, Mr. Dibbs,
has forgotten that life is short. We only live a certain
number of years, and during those years we ought to
do all the work we can. The hon. member makes two
complaints, one of which certainly does not coincide
with the other. He says that if a bill had been
introduced in the first instance, no matter how loose it
■was, we could have worked on that; but now, after
we have dealt with a series of resolutions in detail, and
are about to refer them to committees, he wants those
committees to bring up separate reports before we deal
with a bill. Surely that would extend the discussions
too far ? I think the suggestion that has been made
is a very good one. Possibly we ought to have three,
or perhaps four, committees —I do not care how many ;
but if the committees deal with the principles which
are submitted to them, surely it will save time if they
embody their conclusions in a bill with which the
Convention could deal directly, instead of through the
medium of a series of indefinite resolutions which would


have to be dealt with again in the form of a bill. I
entirely agree with the proposal that the work of the
various committees should be submitted to the Conven-
tion in the form of a bill. At the same time, I think
we ought to have more than two committees; two
committees are too few to deal effectually with the
work they have to do.
Mr. CLARK: If I am in order, I desire to move :
That the motion he amended by the insertion of the follow-
ing resolution, to stand as resolution No. 3 : —“ That in
addition to the committees above-mentioned, a committee be
appointed to consider the question of the establishment of a
federal judiciary, its powers and its functions, and to report
to the Committee on Constitutional Machinery in the same
manner as the Committee on Finance is directed to report;
such committee to consist of one member from each delegation.”
Amendment agreed to.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I desire to say a few
words with respect to directing the committee to bring
up the result of their deliberations in the form of a
bill. I should like that matter to be left open. Those
who are familiar with drafting, of course, know that
it is no more trouble to them to put their conclusions
in the form of a bill than in the form of resolutions ;
probably it is less trouble. However, speaking from
another point of view, I doubt very much whether the
general public, who, after all, are the persons who will
have to understand the recommendations of the com-
mittees, will be able to follow them in the form of a
bill so well as they would in the form of resolutions.
Speaking for myself, I should say that itwould be much
less trouble to me to put the conclusions of the com-
mittee in the form of resolutions than in the form of a
bill, because I am familiar with that kind of work.
But I am quite certain, from my experience, that the
public will understand resolutions more easily than they
will understand a bill. That being so, I think it might
be a mistake to instruct the committee to put their
conclusions in the form of a bill. It should be left to
the committee to consider which course will be the most
likely to make their work “understanded of the people.”
Dr. COCKBURN : I think there is very sound
sense in what the hon. member, Bir Samuel Griffith,
has said. We all know that very simple principles
which can be embodied in a very few lines may take
several clauses of intricate drafting to give effect to in
a bill.
Mr. Clark : It will have to be done sometime !
Dr. COCKBURISr: All the members of the Conven-
tion are not lawyers, and yet they have very strong
views on general principles, and it may be very diffi-
cult, as the bill is being passed through Committee
clause by clause, for those who have not had the
advantage of a legal training to submit their amend-
ments exactly in legal form, as a skilful draftsman
would do. It would be placing the laymen of the Con-
vention at a disadvantage. 1 think it would be very
easy for the committees to bring up resolutibns in the
same way as was done in Canada. There, I believe,
the resolutions were not brought up in strictly legal
form, but actually covered the whole ground, and
although not drawn in strictly legal phraseology, yet
they really were drawn just as a bill would be drawn
in something like popular language.
Mr. Munro ; They were sent home without being
put in the form of a bill at all. We are not going
to do that sort of thing!
Dr. COCKBURN : When we have agreed to every-
thing that is necessary, the putting of it into legal
phraseology would be the work of only a few minutes.
Mr. Barton : If the work be so complicated, how
is it to be done in a few minutes 1
Dr. COCKBURN: This is a matter of even greater
importance than anything we have to consider in our
local parliaments ; and hon, members desiring to give
expression to a principle may not be able, on the spur
of the moment, to draft a clause in legal phraseology.
I would ask the hon. member, Mr. Barton, to point
out how we are to overcome the difficulty, putting
himself, not in the position of a skilful draftsman or
lawyer, but in that of a layman ?
Mr. BARTON : I do not think any great difficulty
exists; and I would ask the hon. member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, not to insist upon an intermediate stage.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I merely threw out a
suggestion for the consideration of the Committee !
Mr. BARTON : I do not think the effect would
be to facilitate our proceedings. We are now in our
third week, and in proportion to the value and
importance of the assistance of a great many of the
members of the Convention to us, is the strength of
the calls daily made upon them by their own
colonies. Among the strongest men here, if I may
make any distinction at all, are those who hold
executive offices, and whose colonies want them back
as soon as possible. These are calls they can resist for
a time; but I should be very sorry indeed if a time
should come when they could no longer resist those
calls, and when, consequently, the Convention would
be deprived of their assistance. The interposition
of an intermediate stage might lead to that diffi-
culty. We are not exactly in the position of repre-
sentatives commencing a session of parliament which
might last four or live months. We have to do
the best we can in the time at our disposal, and we
have, I admit, at the same time, to take care that
the propositions we formulate lose nothing whatever
on the score of haste. I would ask the hon. member,
Dr. Cockburn, to consider that this is a convention of
legislators. A large majority of those present are men
of long parliamentary experience ; and it is scarcely
competent for any one of us to contend that we have
not had sufficient experience to know what legal phra-
seology is as developed in bills. It would be an extra-
ordinary confession for the majority of the members
of this Convention to make, that they find any diffi-
culty in dealing with the clauses of a bill. I think
we all sufficiently understand the phraseology generally
used in acts of parliament to find no difficulty in
placing a reasonable interpretation upon any clause
in a bill. There need be no difficulty about the
matter of amepdments. Those who desire to make
amendments will be found to have had, probably,
many years' experience of that kind of work ; and, so
far as the hon. member, Dr. Cockburn, is concerned,
he possesses such remarkable facility for expressing
his precise ideas in the requisite language that the
framing of any number of amendments will not present
the least difficulty to him. I think I might say that
of nearly every member present. Many of us, I
regret to say, have grown grey in the service of these
colonies. That is more or less the case with all of us;
and there is no reason why we should confess to the
world that which would not, if made, be a true
confession—that we did not understand the ordinary
phraseology of bills. I anticipate no difficulty in this
matter. The bill will be in the hands of hon.
members a sufficient time to enable them to under-
stand every detail, and they will have at their
disposal time which, owing to the great pressure of
work in their own legislatures, they cannot ordinarily
have. When engaged in their A-arious colonies, they
have multitudinous duties to discharge, and it may
often happen that a bill will come before them at a
time when they are not prepared with amendments.
The time now at their disposal, however, free from
the trammels of their ordinary duties elsewhere, will
enable them to give attention to the clauses of the
proposed bill, and will place them in a position to
move any amendments they may desire to move. As
the matter is one of some urgency, I would ask the
hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, not to urge the
interposition of another stage. Our time is growing
short; we have to do the most important of our work
in a short time; but when the bill is brought
forward, the important matters which we have been


debating will be put in a formal way, and upon the
amendments moved will depend that which will
ultimately go to the several parliaments. We are
now about to reach the most important part of our
work, and if we appoint a committee merely to
draw up resolutions, and have afterwards to put
those resolutions in the form of a bill, we shall be
sacrificing valuable time. If it be intended to
appoint committees to frame resolutions alone, and
allow our work to stand at the passing of those reso-
lutions, we shall necessitate a second convention. I
think that if our labours can possibly be concluded
without the intervention of another convention we
ought not to interpose this second stage, as a matter
of certainty, seeing that there is every possibility of a
second stage being avoided.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH; I am afraid that in
my desire to save time I did not make myself clear.
I did not suggest a series of short resolutions which
would require subsequent amplification into a bill.
What I suggested was that the phraseology in which
we embodied our conclusions should be the
phraseology of ordinary resolutions, instead of the
phraseology of clauses of bills. I did not mean that
we should omit any detail that would be expressed in
a bill; I referred only to the form in which it should
be expressed.
Mr. WRIXON : I suggest that we should allow
the committee to bring up a bill, if it see its way
to do so. The hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith,
appeared to think that the public might possibly be of
opinion that they had not sufficient information if it
were brought before them in the shape of a bill; but
I do not think there is much weight in that objection,
and for this reason ; that the points in which the
public are interested —the prominent points in dispute
—have during the last three weeks been debated several
times; and other points which have not yet been
debated will be fully debated when the bill is before us,
and when the attention of the public will be fully
called to them. The bill will be the machinery lying
by to carry out our conclusions when we finally
arrive at them, and, as I presume we really wish to
arrive at some result, I think the committee should have
a bill ready for the Convention when we meet again.
Resolution, as amended, agreed to.
Resolved;
(I.) That the resolutions reported to this Convention by
Committee of the Whole be referred to two committees, the
one for consideration of constitutional machinery and the
distribution of functions and powers, the other for considera-
tion of provisions relating to finance, taxation, and trade
regulation; the first-named committee to consist of two
members from each of the several delegations, the last-
named committee to consist of one member from each. The
members to be chosen by the several delegations.
(2.) That the last-named committee be instructed to
specially consider resolutions Nos. 3 and 4, on trade and
intercourse and on customs taxation, with a view to their
being carried into effect upon lines just to the several colonies,
and that it be a further instruction to the said committee
to lay its conclusions before the Committee on Constitutional
Machinery, Functions, and Powers.
(3.) That in addition to the committees abovementioned, a
committee be appointed to consider the question of the
establishment of a federal judiciary, its powers, and its
functions, and to report to the Committee on Constitutional
Machinery in the same manner as the Committee on Finance is
directed to report, such committee to consist of one member
from each delegation.
(4.) That upon the result of the deliberations of the said
committees the Committee on Constitutional Machinery,
Functions, and Powers, do prepare and submit to this Con-
vention a bill for the establishment of a federal constitution,
such bill to be prepared as speedily as is consistent with
careful consideration.
Mr. DEAKIN: I would suggest that the President
request that the different delegations make their
nominations to the committees to-night so that the
names may be handed in before we leave, and that
arrangements may be made for the hour at which
the committees will commence their labours to-morrow.
Mr. BARTON: I would suggest that the President
leave the chair for, say, ten minutes to permit of the
nomination of delegates.
The President left the chair for ten minutes.
The President : I have received the following
returns, giving the names of the several committees as
elected by their respective delegations ;
New South Wales. —Constitutional Functions : Sir Henry
I’arkes, and Mr. Barton. Finance, Taxation, &c.: Mr.
McMillan. Judiciary: Mr. Dibbs.
Victoria. —Constitutional Functions : Mr. Gillies and Mr.
Deakin. Finance, Taxation, &c. : Mr. Munro. Judiciary :
Mr. Wrixon.
Queensland. —Constitutional Functions: Sir Samuel Griffith
and Mr. Thynne. Finance, Taxation, &c. : Sir Thomas
Mcllwraith. Judiciary : Mr. Rutledge,
South Australia. —Constitutional Functions : Mr. Play ford
and Sir John Downer. Finance, Taxation, &c. : Sir John
Bray. Judiciary : Mr. Kingston.
Tasmania. —Constitutional Functions : Mr. Clark and Mr.
Adye Douglas. Finance, Taxation, &c. : Mr. Burgess.
Judiciary : Mr. Clark.
New Zealand. —Constitutional Functions : Sir George Grey
and Captain Russell. Finance, Taxation, &c.: Sir Harry
Atkinson. Judiciary: Sir Harry Atkinson.
Western Australia. Constitutional Functions: Mr. J.
Forrest and Sir James Lee-Steere. Finance, Taxation, &c. :
Mr. Marmion. Judiciary : Mr. Hackett.
Motion (by Sir Samuel Griffith, with concurrence)
agreed to ;
That, in the event of the absence of any member of a com-
mittee, the delegation by which he was chosen be empowered
to choose another member in his stead.
The President : It seems to me that the next
business should be to appoint a time for the meeting
of those committees.
Mr. DEAKIN : Perhaps it would be better for the
first day if the committees met at the usual hour of
11 o’clock, and after that they could meet at whatever
time they like to fix themselves.
The President : Perhaps it would be convenient if
some intimation were given as to whether, when the
committees are withdrawn, the Convention is to go
on with its ordinary course of proceedings.
Mr. Gillies : I would point out that as our proceed-
ings are conducted according to the rules of the House
of Commons, the select committees will not be able to
meet during the sittings of the Convention, and it will
therefore be necessary that we give them permission
to sit on days when the Convention does not meet.
The President : Perhaps some hon. gentleman had
better make a motion to that effect.
Mr. Barton : The ordinary practice is to give
committees leave to sit during any adjournment of the
House, and let them fix their own time.
Mr. ABBOTT : I suggest that it would be much
better to give the committees leave to sit at any time,
and I would move:
That the committees have leave to sit at any time.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
The President : If lam permitted, I will announce
on behalf of the Convention that the committees will
meet at 11 o’clock to-morrow. It has been hinted to
me, though I think it was hardly necessary, that the
committees will have the use of this chamber, and any
of the adjoining rooms.
Mr. BARTON : It has just occurred to me that no
quorum has been fixed for the committees. I think
it desirable that this should be done, and would suggest
that in the large committee the quorum should be six,
and in the others three.
Mr. Gillies : In committees a majority is always a
quorum !
The President : As far as I can form an opinion,
from the attendance of members at the Convention, I
think there can belittle doubt that the committees will
be fully attended ; but perhaps it might be as well to
fix the quorum.
Hon. Members : A majority !


Mr, BARTON ; I will adopt the suggestion thrown
out, and will move :
That in the committees appointed a majority do form a
quorum.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Motion {by Mr. McMillan) agreed to :
That the Convention adjourn until 11 o’clock on Tuesday
morning.
Convention adjourned at 5T6 p.ra.
TUESDAY, 24 MARCH, 1891.
Judiciary—Adjournment.
The President took the chair at 11 a.m.
JUDICIARY.
The President : I have received a rather lengthy
letter from Mr. Justice Richmond, a judge of the
Supreme Court of New Zealand, in reference to the
creation of a judiciary for Australia. I think it is too
long to be recorded in the ordinary way.
Sir John Downer : Refer it to the Judiciary Com-
mittee !
The President ; I have shown the letter to the
hon. member, Mr. Clark, the chairman of that com-
mittee, and I was going to suggest that some hon.
member should move that it be printed. I think that
would be the best course.
Mr. Dices : What is the letter about?
The President ; It is couched in unobjectionable
terms, and it contains the opinions of a judge of some
eminence upon certain features of the judiciary.
Mr. Clark : I wish to state that the President
handed the letter to me as chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, and asked me to make any observations
upon it I thought fit. I have written a number of
observations, and have had them printed, and I am
quite prepared to move that the letter and my observa-
tions thereon be printed, not only for the use of the
Judiciary Committee, but for the use of the whole
Convention. I move :
That the letter sent by Mr. Justice Richmond, together
with Mr. Clark’s notes thereon, be printed.
Mr. Adye Douglas : I would suggest that the letter
be read !
The President : It will take a long time to do that.
I have already explained that I have adopted the
course of handing the letter to the hon. member, Mr,
Clark, who undertook to read it, to see if it was of
such a nature that no objection could be offered to its
being printed. We have the assurance of the hon.
member, Mr. Clark, that there is no objection what-
ever to the printing of the letter, and, indeed, that it
is a valuable contribution to our proceedings,
Mr. Adye Douglas ; It seems to me that anything
connected with our proceedings, if it is of sufficient
importance to be referred to a committee, is also of
sufficient importance to be referred to the Convention.
Mr. Clark ; The hon. member will be able to have
printed copies of it!
The President ; I will undertake to have it printed
during the day.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
ADJOURNMENT.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I have had the honor
of being elected chairman of the Committee on Con-
stitutional Powers and Functions, and I have to inform
the Convention that thatcommittee has not yet finished
its labours, and is not in a position to bring up the report
which it was instructed to prepare. I therefore have
to suggest that some hon, gentleman should move that
the Convention now adjourn. I think it would be con-
venient, if hon. gentlemen generally approve, for the
Convention to meet again on Thursday afternoon, as
at that time we shall be able at any rate to give the
Convention some definite information as to when they
may expect the full report of the committee. I think
it is right to add that I have with some surprise seen
published in the daily press what purport to be reports
of the committees on finance and judiciary. One of
those reports has been handed to the committee on
constitutional powers in part—not complete, the other
has not been handed to them at all, and I have reason
to believe that what purports to be a copy of it in the
press, is not a copy of the report that the committee
has prepared. I mention the fact because it is very
inconvenient that the proceedings of the select com-
mittee, which it was understood would be kept private,
at any rate until they were complete, should appear in
the press before hon. members of the Convention see
them. As a matter of courtesy, if not of parliamentary
practice, hon. members are entitled to see the reports
first. I do not know, nor does any other hon. mem-
ber, how this happened ; but I think it right to call
attention to it, and to express my very great regret
that it has happened.
Mr. ABBOTT : I beg to move :
That the Convention do now adjourn until Thursday after-
noon, at half-past 2.
Question proposed.
The President ; I am requested to state that the
officials at the table have had nothing whatever to do
with the publication of the reports. They have been
very careful—even scrupulously so—to destroy the
very paper that had been used by members of the com-
mittees. How these particular reports obtained pub-
licity I, with the hon. and learned member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, cannot form any conception whatever. I can
only say that I have not seen them myself.
Mr. MUNRO : As chairman of the Finance Com-
mittee, I must confess that 1 was very much surprised
this morning when I saw that one of the morning news-
papers contained what purports to be a report of that
committee, and also what purports to be a report of the
other committee. As the Vice-President has said, I
handed to the chairman of the committee on constitu-
tional pow r ers a copy of the report of the Finance Com-
mittee, as far as it went, very late yesterday afternoon,
and the appendices to that report have not been handed
to him yet. I noticed, however, that copies of that
report were distributed to hon. members either through
the post or by hand last night. For instance, wdien I
returned to the hotel late last night I found that a copy
had been sent to me. It is quite possible that some
members of the committee did not receive the report
last night, and, as reporters are generally anxious
to pick up anything going about, they may have
got it in that way. I do not believe that any
member of the committee gave the report to the
press, nor that any of the officials did. It must,
therefore, have got into the hands of the reporters in
some way which we do not know anything at all
about. With regard to the question of the adjourn-
ment, I think that for the convenience of hon. gentle-
men we ought to know what we are expected to do.
I know that it is very pleasant for all of us to be in
Sydney, but I shall not be able to go on with my busi-
ness in future if I remain here much longer. Our
entertainment will be too good, and life too pleasant
for us to go back to work any more. But if we are
to remain here over the Easter holidays, we ought to
know something as to why we are to be kept here.
If it is merely for us to be called here on Thursday
afternoon to be informed that there is nothing for us
to do, I think it will be very much better for us to
adjourn until Tuesday morning. This would enable
those of us who can afford the time to take a run
back to our different colonies, and to attend to some
business there which we cannot possibly do here. I
merely mention this for the purpose of doing what
is most convenient for hon. delegates j for unless we


receive some assurance that AA'hon we meet on Thurs-
day we shall be called upon to proceed Avith business,
I do not think any' good will result from meeting
then for an hour or two, and then being told Ave
cannot meet again until the following Tuesday. I
think that under these circumstances it Avould be far
better that the adjournment should take place until
next Tuesday, AAdien Ave should expect the committee
Avould be prepared to lay the bill before us, and Ave
Avould go straight on.
Mr. CLARK: As chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee I Avish to say that I Avas as much surprised as
Avasthe Vice-President and the chairman of thePinance
Committee, to see what purported to be a report of
the Judiciary Committee in one of the newspapers
this morning. That report is a copy of the first draft
that w r as brought up, and evidently a copy in that
imperfect state went astray and got into the reporters’
hands. It is very incorrect in some paragraphs. It
contains paragraphs that will not appear when the
report comes up, and it does not contain several
paragraphs that will appear in the report Avhen it
comes up.
Mr. BARTON : I think some hon. members, Ido
not allude to those avlio live out of Australia, might
have an opportunity to go home for a couple of days,
if it is not certain that we shall have the bill by next
Thursday. I invite the attention of hon. members
more particularly to the suggestion of the hon.
member, Mr. Munro. It does seem that it would bo
a pity for the Convention, Avhich requires a quorum
of twenty-five members, to meet here next Thursday
unless we are certain of having business to go on
with on that day, and it would be better for hon.
gentlemen Avho can do so to go to their homes and
not be brought here until next Tuesday.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I think I may say
that there is very little probability that the com-
mittee Avill be able to make a complete report by
Thursday. There is a great deal of mechanical Avork
to be done in the printing office and elsewhere, and
the committee as a Avhole must have an opportunity
of revising that Avork carefully before they bring up
their report. I think it is physically impossible that
it can be ready by Thursday, but Ave may be able to
give the Convention more definite information then.
On the other hand I think there is little doubt that
on Tuesday morning the committee will be able to
make a complete report on their labours.
Mr. BAKER : Will it not be possible, sir, for the
committee, when their report is ready, to send a copy
through the post to each member of the Convention,
so that he may be able to study its contents, and be
ready to go on with its consideration Avhen the Con-
vention meets again ? If we see the report for the
first time on Tuesday it will be very difficult for us —
certainly for myself, and I believe for most hon.
members—to grasp its whole meaning and intent on
Tuesday morning, and go straight on then with its
consideration.
Sir Samuel G-rifeitii ; Quite impossible !
Mr. BAKER: I Avould, therefore, suggest if it is
feasible that as soon as it is ready, even if we do
adjourn, the committee circulate the report among
the members of the Convention.
Sir JOHN BRAY : I think there is a good deal
in the suggestion of my hon. friend. Perhaps it will
be understood that if the report of the Constitutional
Committee is ready before Tuesday, if Ave adjourn
until then its chairman may hand it to the President
Avho can cause a copy to be sent to each member of
the Convention so that it may be perused before Ave
meet on Tuesday.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Confidentially! *
Sir JOHN BRAY ; I do not know that it matters
really very much once the committee agree to the form
in which they are going to submit their report to the
Convention if it is made public then. Eor it cannot
be altered after it is handed into the President as the
final report of the committee. J think we should
have the report, if possible, before we meet as a body
again.
Mr. THTNNE: I rise to move, by way of amend-
ment, that the Convention do adjourn until Tuesday
next at half-past 2 o’clock.
Mr. ABBOTT: I am quite willing to withdraw
my amendment and to propose in lieu thereof the
adjournment of the Convention until Tuesday after-
noon at half-past 2 o’clock. If the Convention
adjourns until Tuesday afternoon, hon. members will
be able to get a copy of the report as soon as it is
brought up. I do not think it is desirable that the
reports should be made public until they are sub-
mitted to the Convention. Hon. members will have
Tuesday afternoon and Tuesday evening to consider
the report, and the Convention can meet on Wednes-
day morning. Therefore, with concurrence, I with-
draw my motion, and move in its stead:
That the Convention at its rising do adjourn until Tuesday
next at half-past 2 o’clock.
Mr. DIBB3 : I desire to say a word or two as to
the suggestion made by the bon. member, Sir John
Bray. I submit that as soon as the report of the
Constitutional Committee is prepared, and finally
adopted, it should be handed to the press.
An Hon. Member : No, to the President!
Mr. HIBBS : It is all very Avell for the hon. mem-
ber to say, “ No ” ; but he represents only a part of
the public out of doors. The moment the report
leaves the hands of the committee it must come
before the Convention. I want to point out that we,
as representatives of the public, have a right to give
the people of Australia the earliest possible intima-
tion of what we are doing. Now, if the report is
laid on the table on Tuesday, the public will know its
contents through the press on Wednesday morning,
and if they can get that information on Tuesday
morning, why should we attempt to keep it back for
one hour or twenty-four hours ? What we are doing
will be fully criticised throughout the country. The
public have a right to this information at the earliest
moment, and it is almost reducing our proceedings
to a farce to withhold the knowledge after the reports
have finally left the committees. It is far better to
give the press a fair and true copy of the report than
to have a garbled edition published in Tuesday’s or
Wednesday’s papers. I think that if that idea is em-
bodied in the motion it will meet with the approval
of hon. members here. I am quite certain unless Ave
do that people out of doors will say that by our
action Ave are depriving them of the right of know-
ing A\ r hat Ave are doing to the fullest possible extent.
Sir JOHN DOWNER: As regards the confi-
dential circulation of the report at any reasonable
time before Tuesday, I. entirely agree Avith the sug-
gestion ; but as regards its publication in the press,
I think my hon. friend, Mr. Dibbs, forgets that pro-
bably when the committees present their reports
they Avould like to give a short explanation of the
reasons for the conclusions at Avhich they have
arrived before submitting their reports baldly to be
commented upon by others. I think it is only a
reasonable thing that the committees, through their
chairmen, should have an opportunity of explaining
their reasons before their reports are made matters
of public comment.
Mr. BARTON : I think that there is a great deal
of cogency in what has been said by the hon. mem-
ber, Sir John DoAAmer. Any measure which is
brought up by a committee and laid before the public
Avithout such explanation as the committee will un-
doubtedly give at the hands of their chairman is
liable to misconstruction. Moreover, Ave are proceed-
ing according to the rules of Parliament. Certainly
our standing order applies only to debates, but by
analogy Ave are proceeding in all respects, I hope,
according to the rules of Parliament, and it Avould be
an unheard-of thing that a committee instructed to


report should place their report in the hands of
members, and so necessarily in the hands of the
public, because the experience of the last two or
three days shows that the two things are one and the
same, to some intents and purposes at any rate. It
would be a mistake that these reports should be
handed about at all until the committees come for-
ward in an authoritative way and explain the reasons
for adopting the conclusions at which they have arrived.
I am sure it will not do hon. members any good
to have the report put in their hands, not being them-
selves cognizant of the proceedings of the committee
and of the manner in which the conclusions were
arrived at, until the various reasons which actuated
thecoramittee one way or the other are fully explained.
That will be done when the bill is introduced, and no
doubt a statement will be made when a report is
brought up by the chairman of the committee. I
think we might well, for the purpose of adhering to
a rule which has worked out well, and which is the
result of long experience,possess ourselves in patience
until wo in the ordinary and proper way get the
reports of the committees. That can be done, we are
assured, by Tuesday next. I am quite sure the
President can scarcely know, unless this debate
develops the sense of the Convention as a sort of
instruction to him, what to do with the report when
it reaches him. He will not know whether he ought
to have the report printed and circulated amongst
hon. members, or whether he ought to wait until the
committees, through their chairmen, move the
adoption of the reports. I think he is entitled to
have the sense of the Convention on that point. I
would suggest that unless grave reason can be given
for the course, the ordinary parliamentary procedure
should not be intermitted.
Mr. J. FOEEEST: The only objection I have to
the ordinary parliamentary procedure in this instance
is that it will involve delay. If we receive the report
of the committee on Tuesday afternoon, it will be
necessary to adjourn until "Wednesday or Thursday,
so that hon. members may consider the report and
bill, whereas if the bill were ready on Saturday it
might be in the hands of hon. members by Saturday
evening, thus giving them a day or two to consider it
before the Convention reassembled. It seems to me
that however convenient it may be to those
gentlemen who are resident in Sydney, and who
are able to carry on their own business at the same
time that they attend to their duties at this Conven-
tion, and to those gentlemen who can go home and
return in a day, to follow the ordinary parliamentary
procedure, it will be inconvenient for those who come
from a long distance. Speaking for myself, I can
only say that I should be very glad to remain here
for a considerable time, but the exigencies of the
public service will not permit of my doing so. I
may say that I and my colleagues have taken our
return passages to Western Australia by a steamer
leaving Adelaide on the 15th April, and that it will
be impossible for us to remain here longer than that,
Mr. Clark: The labours of the Convention will
be completed by that time !
Mr. J. FOEEEST: I think the proposal of the
hon. member, Mr. Barton, will cause several days’
delay. Of course we all regret the appearance in
the press of garbled reports of the deliberations of
the committee. At the same time I see no reason
whatever why the report of the committee should
not be submitted to members of the Convention con-
fidentially at the earliest moment. I therefore move;
That a copy of the report of the Committee on Constitu-
tional Machinery, so soon as prepared, be forwarded
by the President to the delegates of this Convention.
Mr. BAKEE : I second the motion.
Mr. MUNEO; I presume that this is an amend-
ment which cannot be moved upon a motion for the.
adjournment of the Convention ?
The President : I have no doubt the hon. member,
Mr. Abbott, will withdraw his motion of adjournment.
Mr. ABBOTT : I am quite willing to withdraw
mj motion, although what I had moved was not that
the Convention do now adjourn, but that it should
at its rising adjourn until Tuesday next.
The President : Before putting the motion of the
hon. member, Mr. J. Forrest, I do not know whether
I shall be deemed in order if I make two or three
observations.
Hon. Members : Hear, hear!
The President : I think the hon. member, Mr. J.
Forrest, and others who agree with him, will see at
once that if the report be not ready before the end
of the week it will be impossible for it to reach him
in Western Australia, or even in South Australia, or
in Victoria in time to be considered before the Con-
vention meets on Tuesday next.
Mr. J. Forrest : I shall be here !
The President : I understood the hon. member’s
first argument to be this : that the course proposed
by the hon. member, Mr. Barton, was all very well for
persons on the spot, but that those at a distance were
differently situated. I understood that argument to
imply that the hon. member would be leaving
Sydney.
Mr. J. Forrest : No!
The President : If the hon. member remains in
Sydney that argument is not of much use. But it
would be hardly proper for me to say much on that
aspect of the question. I do wish, however to im-
press upon members of the Convention that while
this proceeding would be very irregular it would be
productive of scarcely any good whatever. It is
hardly right for a report to be considered, as proposed,
until it is produced in the Convention with such light
as its authors can throw upon it, and I doubt very
much whether the mode of proceeding with this
report and the bill attached to it, when it is forth-
coming, will not be of a character very similar to that
of the second reading and consideration in detail of
an ordinary bill in Parliament, and whether,
therefore, the proceedings will not be of a charac-
ter that would render it extremely difficult for the
public to understand the matter until it has been, to
some extent, debated in the Convention. I think,
therefore, that it would he an inadvisable course on
all grounds—quite irregular, according to the pro-
ceedings of any legislative body —and that it would
be really productive of no good. Beyond expressing
that opinion, I have nothing further to say, except
that I am very glad the motion has been made, so
that, if the course of distribution, as proposed, bo
followed, it may be under the strict orders of the
Convention.
Question proposed.
Mr. MUNEO: I agree with you, sir, that the
proposed course is quite irregular, I may say also
that it would be quite ineffective. I am assured by
delegates upon the committee, that the time at their
disposal for the preparation of a draft constitution,
and for the submission of it to their own body, will
be quite short enough, supposing the Convention re-
assembles on Tuesday afternoon, and considering
that the holidays intervene. If that be so, of what
use will it be for us to pass a resolution which is
not only contrary to the standing orders we have
already adopted, but which in itself would be in-
effective.
Mr. Baker : It is not contrary to the standing
orders!
Mr. MUNEO: We have agreed to be guided by
the standing orders of the House of Commons, and
those orders certainly do not permit of copies of bills
being sent to members of the House of Commons
before they are brought before the house itself.
That, so far as I am aware, is not done by any de-
liberate body, and it would be contrary to all pre-
cedent to adopt the course on this occasion. I am


as anxious as is my hon. friend, the Prime Minister of
Western Australia, to save time, and I am sure
that the proposed' course will not save time.
But I would like to point out to hon. members
the way in which I think it can be saved. What
I would suggest is, that wdien the bill is submitted
to us on Tuesday afternoon next we should thence-
forward make up our minds to refuse all entertain-
ment, and to meet in the evening, as w r ell as during
the day, until we have completed our consideration
of the bill. Our whole attention should be directed
to dealing with the bill, and if that be done we shall
all get away by the 15th April. That is the proper
way to proceed —to let everything else go, and when
we have got the bill before us, to pay attention to
nothing else until we have done with it. To carry
this motion would be subversive of all the rules and
precedents of Parliament, It would be absolutely
useless to the committee, and it would not be right
to send a copy of the report or of the bill to members
before it is submitted to the Convention.
Mr. DONALDSON : I am as desirous as any hon.
member can be to see the report as soon as possible.
At the same time I think we should be adopting a
very wrong course if we ordered it to be distributed
before it is presented to the Convention in the usual
way, as is done in Parliament. There will probably
be a discussion on Tuesday afternoon, and it will be
well to have the debate which then takes place pub-
lished in the newspapers simultaneously with the
report and bill. If the report be circulated before
the debate takes place, it is more than likely that it
will be published in the newspapers. The newspapers
may make adverse comments upon it, and it wxmld
probably take a great deal of time and trouble for us
to eradicate the effect which such comments will have
on the public mind. It will be far better for us to
wait patiently for the report. It should be considered
fully by the committee before it reaches the Conven-
tion, and we should not try to hurry the committee
in any way whatever. Such a course would be far
better for every member of the Convention. I trust
the hon. member, Mr. J. Forrest, will not persevere
with the motion.
Sir JOHN BRAY : If wo were meeting from day
to day, it would be exceedingly objectionable for the
report to be made public before it was handed in to
the Convention ; but as, owing to the Easter holidays,
we propose to adjourn for a week, it is the height of
absurdity to imagine that if this report be agreed to
on Saturday night, and the delegates remain in
Sydney, they will be satisfied to wait until Tuesday
to know wdiat that report is. We ought to adhere to
parliamentary practice as far as we possibly can, and
if we were meeting every day I should be quite
Avilling to wait for the report until it is presented to
the Convention. But w r e know very well that if the
report is agreed to before Tuesday, no delegate will
rest satisfied until he gets a copy, and the sooner
every member gets a copy and the public know what
the report is the better it will be. Therefore I think
that my suggestion, which has been supported by the
hon. member, Mr. Dibbs, is really the proper‘one.
If the report cannot be drawn up before Tuesday,
then no harm will be done. If it is agreed upon
before Tuesday, however, it should be handed to the
President and copies furnished to members and to
the press. The hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith,
has not said that immediately he brings forward the
bill on Tuesday he will be prepared to explain it.
Sir Samuel Griffith : I should be sorry to do so
before members are furnished with a copy of the
report itself.
Sir JOHN BRAY: I quite agree with the hon,
member that it would not be reasonable to expect
such a thing. Well, if the report is brought up
on Tuesday afternoon, the press will publish
it and make comments upon it before it is con-
sidered the Convention. It seems to me that
it would be more convenient if the report were
handed to the press and the public as soon as it
was agreed upon. I agree that until the report is
definitely agreed upon, the less said about it the
better ; otherwise I think we shall save time by pub-
lishing the report as soon as possible.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I hope that the hon.
member, Mr. J. Forrest, will withdraw the motion.
It must be remembered that the members of each
delegation are in communication with their col-
leagues. I presume they consult each other. I
know that I consult my colleagues from time to time
—not only those on the committee but also those who
are not on the committee. If this committee pro-
ceeds as other committees do, there will no doubt be
three or four drafts of the report submitted before
it is finally agreed upon. The nature of these drafts
will no doubt be communicated to the members of
each delegation, so that they will know what is going
on. They will not know the exact terms of the final-
report of course, because no one will know that until
the report is agreed upon. I do not see any possi-
bility of having the report drawn up in a complete
form before Tuesday next, unless indeed all the
members of the committee are willing to sit on
Good Friday and Easter Monday, and possibly
Sunday.
Mr. Lotoh : Does the hon. member mean the
draft report or bill ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I mean the report in
the form of a bill. The committee wish to bring up a
bill that will commend itself to the Convention, and
that will not require verbal amendment. It is a
case in which the more haste the less speed. The
careful revision must be done by a small committee,
not by a large one. I hope the hon. member will
withdraw the motion, and, as I have pointed out, he
can ascertain all that it is desirable to know by other
means. He will know what is going on, and he will
be able to make suggestions to his colleagues on the
committee.
Sir GEORGE GREY : Before the motion is with-
drawn, I would like to express my own opinion that I
really believe this difficulty has arisen entirely from
the rule laid down that the committees should be
secretly conducted. The more I think upon that
subject the more satisfied I am that it w r as a mistake.
Now, presuming that the argument was used that
many members would be unwilling that the crude
ideas which they had held should be made known to
the public, they having altered them after argument
in the committee. That very reason, it seems to me,
would show that we have made a mistake. Again, an
hon. member has said that it is quite possible, if this
report were published before being submitted to the
Convention, the press would publish adverse com-
ments upon it, the effect of which we should never
afterwards be able to get out of the public mind, or,
at all events, not for a considerable time. That
appeared to me to be a conclusive argument against
the committees being conducted in secret; for if
hon. members meeting in committee did in the first
instance take mistaken views upon a subject, and
then the reasoning in committee convinced them that
they w r ere wrong, so that they withdrew their opposi-
tion and adopted other views, if that w’ere made
known to the public, the public would have the same
advantage of having WTong views confuted by proper
argument. The public throughout the whole of
Australasia would read those views on both sides of
the question. The probability is that the par-
ticular wrong arguments which it is anticipated
the press would use would have been discussed in
committee, and would have been confuted there;
and the press therefore would never have instilled
into the public mind ideas which members of the
Convention could not afterwards eradicate. It seems
to me that the whole subject would have been fairly
discussed, as it were, in the presence of the whole of


New Zealand and Australasia; that owing to the
telegraphic communication to every part, the whole
public of Australasia might really, as it w r ere, have
sat in the committee; and would have known every
view that had been proposed; that certain views
were confuted, and others adopted. Such informa-
tion must have done the greatest possible good in
educating the public mind with regard to their future
constitution; and to deprive them of an advantage
of that kind was a true misfortune to the public.
Anything that might still bring the matter under
discussion would be an advantage to the whole of
Australasia, to every man, woman, and child in the
country ; and we should rather try to promote the
spread of information of that kind than to keep
back most necessary information to enable the public
to make up their minds ultimately on the form of
the constitution recommended for their adoption.
All information which could enable them to do that
should be freely and fully given now, as it ought to
have been from the first.
Mr. J. Eoerest: As it appears that the members
of the committees may communicate freely with their
colleagues, my point will be gained in another way ;
and, therefore, as it appears to be the wish of hon.
members that the motion should not be put, I desire
to withdraw it.
Motion, by leave, withdrawn.
Motion (by Mr. Abbott) agreed to :
That the Convention at its rising, do adjourn until Tuesday
next at 2'30 p.m.

ADDRESS.
The following address was read by the secretary:—
To Sir Henry Parkes, G.C.M.G., President, and the hon.
members of the Federal Convention.
May it please the members of your honorable Convention :—
We, the members of the United Licensed Victuallers’
Association of New South Wales, approach your honorable
Convention with sentiments of the deepest respect.
We desire to give expression to our sincere congratulations
upon the assembly in Sydney of a body of such eminent
statesmen to consider questions so fraught with momentous
issues to the Australian nation as are involved in the great
work of federation.
We also express a hope that, whatever decisions may be
arrived at by your honorable Convention, they will be
designed for the best interests of the people of the whole of
the colonies ; and that from the foundation being laid to-day
there may arise a superstructure which shall give practical
effect to the now historic aspiration—one people, one destiny.
Signed on behalf of the member's of the United Licensed
Victuallers’ Association of New South Wales.
Frederick Albert Allen, President.
J. H. Hunt, Vice-President.
J. H. Keary, Vice-President.
James H. Rainford, Vice-President.
James P. Kavanagh, Vice-President.
F. F. Sweeney, Treasurer.
F. Bevill, General Secretary.
DEATH OE A DELEGATE.
Mr. McMILLAN: I am sure it must be a matter
of deep regret to every member of this Convention
that, after the short adjournment which we have
made, upon reopening the proceedings we are over-
shadowed by the sorrow of the death of one of the
ablest men in our midst, the Hon. John Murtagh
Macrossan, It is not likely that I can speak in as
full terms of the hon. member whose death we deplore
as many who have known him for years, and to
whose particular colony he belonged; but I had the
great pleasure and honor of making Mr. Macrossan’s
acquaintance twelve months ago at the federation
conference in Melbourne, and there all of us
who came into contact with him knew that we
had one of the superior minds of Australia in
our midst. We knew from the words which he
uttered that he was a man of great thought
and of comprehensive reading; and, as a debater,
for preciseness of utterance, for putting into
the smallest possible compass the largest body of
ideas, I should say he had probably no superior in
Australasia. His health had been failing for some
considerable time. Those who saw him at Hobart
three months ago must have seen that he was work-
ing up under a high sense of duty against physical
infirmities, and probably if he had consulted his own
health he would have remained in Queensland during
the sittings of this Convention. But he was a man
of simple piety—l use the word in the highest sense
—with a high sense of honor and duty, and he came
here to give the last few hours of his life to the ser-
vice of his adopted country. I have, therefore, a
sorrowful pleasure in moving :
That the members of this Convention desire to record the
expression of their deep regret at the death of the Hon.
John Murtagh Macrossan, one of the delegates from
Queensland, and their mournful sense of the great loss
which the Convention, and the whole of Australia, has
sustained by the sad event.
Sir SAMUEL GRIEEITH: As a representative
of Queensland, I desire to express, on behalf of that
colony, my sense of the deep loss which it, as well as
Australia, has sustained by the death of Mr. Macros-
san. I have had the advantage of his acquaintance
for many years. Eor, I think, more than seventeen
years we sat in the same house of Parliament, and
during nearly the whole of that time we were opposed
to one another in local politics. The opposition
sometimes, as will happen, became strong and even
bitter, but the result of those long years of experi-
ence has been that there was no man in the colony
of Queensland for whom I entertained a higher
regard as an honorable opponent and a true servant
of his country. Apart from matters of local
politics or such matters as divide men who other-
wise would be together, he was one of those
men on whom you could always count when the
higher interest of the country were at stake. You
always knew where to find him, and that he would
be fighting on the right side. Such men are not too
numerous, and his loss is much to be deplored. On
the subject on which we are now met—the federation
of Australia —I believe no man in Australia had a
wider knowledge or a clearer sense of the work to be
done. He had studied the subject profoundly, and
sincerely believed in the cause of federation ; indeed,
lam satisfied that if it had not been for his high
sense of duty, to which the hon. member, Mr.
McMillan, referred, and which impelled him to be
present with us at the risk of his lire, he might still
have been spared to Australia for some time. The
death of such men is a national loss, and Mr.
Macrossan’s death will be so felt in Queensland. I
hope those of us who remain behind may be actuated
by the same high sense of duty as always actuated
him in his public life.
Sir PATRICK JENNINGS: It is not without
feelings of emotion that I rise to say a word or two
in honor of the memory of a great and good man,
who has passed away from us in the execution of his
duty to his country. I had an acquaintance which
ripened into friendship with that hon. gentleman for
the last twenty years. I watched his career, and I
formed an intimacy with him based upon that acquaint-
ance ; and never in the whole course of my experience
and dealings with men, have I met a more honorable,


truthful, upright, and patriotic man than the late
John Murtagh Macrossan. I am glad that the
Premier of Queensland has come forward to testify
his sense of the loss which the colony which he repre-
sents will have to endure in the death of such a man.
No more valuable testimony to the worth of Mr.
Macrossan could be offered than that given by one
who was for so many years a political opponent. I
believe that, in coming to the Convention, he was so
strongly actuated by a sense of public duty that,
although he knew his health was failing from day
to day, he cast aside every consideration for the
furtherance of what he thought was and ought to be
the noblest aim of every Australian citizen and
patriot—the cause of the federation of Australasia.
I am sure we shall all miss him in our deliberations ;
and the placing on record of this little tribute to his
memory will be a graceful act which will be appre-
ciated by those who survive him.
Resolution agreed to.
Resolved (motion by Mr. McMillan) :
That a copy of the resolution be sent to the widow of the
late John Murtagh Macrossan, Esquire.
REPORT: CONSTITUTIONAL
COMMITTEE.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I have the honor to
bring up the report of the Committee on Constitu-
tional Machinery and Distribution of Functions and
Powers, together with appendices. I move:
That the report and appendices be printed.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA BILL.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : With the permission
of the Convention, I should like to move, without
notice :
That the draft bill to constitute the commonwealth of
Australia, brought up by the Constitutional Com-
mittee, be referred for consideration to the Committee
of the Whole Convention.
If I am allowed to submit that motion, I propose,
by the desire of the committee, to make a few
observations which may assist hon. gentlemen in
following the |oill when they come to read it.
The President : As there is no objection, I
assume that the Convention gives its unanimous
assent.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: The Committee on
Constitutional Functions were directed to prepare
a bill to establish the federation of Australia.
They have endeavoured to perform that duty,
and they have framed a bill which forms appendix
A to the report just submitted. In framing it,
the committee had the advantage of having received
the reports of the other two committees —on
Finance and on Judiciary—to which they have given
their most careful attention. I propose now, as
briefly as I may, to offer a few observations on the
bill, and to call attention to some of those matters
which may be new to the members of the Conven-
tion who were not on the committee, and also to
briefly indicate why we have chosen one of several
possible courses when called upon to make a choice.
First, sir, as to the frame of the bill. The bill must
necessarily be passed by the Parliament of the United
Kingdom, but it occurred to us that the constitution
of the federation should be a document by itself. If
the federation is established it will be an historic
document, and we thought that it would be just as
well that it should be complete in itself. We have,
therefore, framed this bill as a bill to be introduced
into the Parliament of the United Kingdom, consti-
tuting the commonwealth and declaring the consti-
tution, the constitution—which may be called a
schedule, if you please—standing as a separate part
of the bill. The name that the committee selected
for the federation was, “ The Commonwealth of
Australia.” It is not necessary, I think, to give any
special reasons why that name was selected.
Sir John Beat : Yes !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH; It is no doubt new
to some hon. members ; but I think they will find, as
I myself found, that, after being accustomed to it for
two or three days, it will come to be regarded as the
most natural and proper name. We are, I believe,
about to establish a great commonwealth in Australia
under the Crown, and, that being so, there is no
reason why we should not call it by that name. lam
merely indicating the arguments that prevailed in the
committee. Of course, Ido not wish it to be understood
that in a matter of this sort, involving so many
points of difficulty, the committee were unanimous
on all points. That is a thing that could not pos-
sibly happen, I suppose. The committee have brought
up the bill collectively, reserving their right as in-
dividual members of the Convention to dissent from
and to express their dissent from such provisions
as they think are not wise, or for which they think
others may be substituted with advantage. I think
that I need not trouble the Convention with any
reference to the few clauses which are the enacting
clauses of the bill proposed to be passed by the
Parliament of the United Kingdom. There are only
seven, with an eighth saying that “ the constitution of
the commonwealth shall be as follows;” and in order
to facilitate reference in the future —I hope a long
future—it is divided into chapters : First, the legis-
lature ; second, the executive government ; third, the
federal judicature; fourth, finance and trade; fifth,
the states; sixth, new states; seventh, miscellaneous
provisions; and, eighth, amendment of the constitu-
tion. It is proposed that the legislative powers of
the commonwealth shall be vested in a parliament,
consisting of the Queen, a senate, and a house of
representatives. Those are the names which, after
full discussion in committee, we adopted for sub-
mission to the Convention. With respect to the
salary of the governor-general, it is proposed that it
shall not be less than £IO,OOO per annum, the parlia-
ment having power to alter it in other respects, as they
think fit, but not to reduce it below that amount. As
to the constitution of the senate, the committtee have
ventured to depart —and I hope they will be par-
doned for departing—from the strict letter of the
instructions conveyed in the resolutions adopted
by the Convention. Instead of providing for the
retirement of an equal third every two years, they
propose that the number of members shall be eight
from each state, and that half of them shall
retire every three years. One reason I think I may
indicate now, which prevailed with many members of
the committee was, that, as the duration of the parlia-
ments of the colonies does not exceed three years, by
that means no parliament would have an opportunity
to make two elections of senators. If they had, it
might happen that in some states, at any rate, two-
thirds of the senators would be chosen by one par-
liament, and half of these just as that parliament
was ceasing to exist. It is proposed that they
shall be directly chosen by the houses of the parlia-
ment —that is to say, that the members of the
houses shall themselves directly choose. the mem-
bers of the senate. The manner in which they shall
exercise that power we propose to leave to them
until the parliament of the commonwealth makes a
uniform provision, which we propose they shall do if
they think fit. The term for which senators are to
be chosen is six years —the first senators to be
divided into two classes by lot, one set to go out at
the end of three years, the other remaining in office
for the full six years. With respect to the qualifi-
cation of senators, the only one necessary to call at-
tention to is that they must have been residents of
that which forms part of the commonwealth at the
time of election for a period of at least five years, so


as to ensure that no novices in the affairs of Aus-
tralia shall take part in the senate. No such restric-
tion is proposed in respect of the house of represen-
tatives. It is proposed that the members of that house
shall be chosen for three years by the people of
each state, according to the number of its popula-
tion, and that, until other provision is made by the
parliament of the commonwealth, each state shall
have one representative for every 30,000 people, with a
proviso that the minimum for any existing colony
shall be four members. "With respect to the quali-
fication of the electors —a subject discussed in this
Convention —the proposal of the committee is that
it shall be the same as that for the electors for the
more numerous branch of the parliament of each
state. I have used the word "state." I should have
earlier pointed out that the committee propose to
use the word "state" to indicate the component
parts of the commonwealth. Three names have been
suggested for those component parts, namely,
" colony," the present name of most of them, " pro-
vince," the name adopted by South Australia, and the
other term " state," which, on consideration, the
majority, at any rate, of the committee thought was
a higher term, and would more properly indicate the
nature and functions of the entity of which we are
speaking. We, therefore, adopted the Avord " state"
as distinguished from "commonwealth." I have
pointed out the qualifications of the electors. AVe
did not see our way to provide for a uniform qualifi-
cation in all cases. That would have involved a
complete and elaborate electoral system, and it might
have been suggested that it would interfere too much
with the internal affairs of the states themselves. It
is provided also that in any state where there is a
race of people not admitted to a share in the repre-
sentation there, it shall not be counted in reckoning
the number of members to be elected to the parlia-
ment of the commonwealth. Provision is made for
a periodical apportionment of the representation of
the different states after each census, but not to take
effect during the existing parliament, and for either
an increase or a diminution of the number of mem-
bers of the parliament of the federal commonwealth
by that parliament, but so as not to interfere Avith the
proportion of representation prescribed by the
constitution. There are, of course, many formal
matters relating to both houses, such as the elec-
tion of president and speaker, disqualifications, the
issue of writs, elections, and so on, with which I shall
not on this occasion trouble the Convention. It is
provided, then, that each member of either house
shall have an annual allowance for his services,
which is proposed to be fixed in the meantime at
£SOO a year. The ordinary disqualifications are
inserted as to members holding offices of profit, with
the exception of ministers of the Crown, or becoming
public contractors and other similar provisions.
Having dealt Avith the constitution of the two houses,
AA r e then had to deal with the legislative poAA r ers of
the parliament. This subject occupied much of the
time of the committee, and will, I am sure, receive
most careful attention and consideration from the
Convention, as it will from the people of the different
states, because the poAvers given to the parliament of
the. commonwealth are proposed to be poAvers para-
mount over those of the states. It is, therefore, very
necessary, bearing in mind the original limitation in
the first of the resolutions which you, sir, moved in
the Convention, to see that Ave do not exceed that
limit, and do not propose to transfer from a state
parliament to the parliament of the commonwealth
any power which can be better exercised by thestate
parliament, or the exercise of which by the parlia-
ment of the commomvealth is not necessary for its
good order and government. That is the rule which
Ave have had before us, and how far we have succeeded
in making the division of course is a matter upon
which the Convention and the public will express
their opinion. I propose to call attention to ?ome of
the powers, not to all, in the list. Many of them
require, I think, scarcely any comment; they will be
admitted as being powers which ought to be within
the province of any federal legislature :
1. The regulation of trade and commerce with other
countries, and among the several states ;
2. Customs and excise and bounties, but so that duties of
customs and excise and bounties shall be uniform
throughout the commonwealth, and that no tax or duty
shall be imposed on any goods exported from one state
to another ;
3. Raising money by any other mode or system of taxation ;
but so that all such taxation shall be uniform through-
out the commonwealth; ;
4. Borrowing money on the public credit of the common-
wealth ;
5. Postal and telegraphic services ;
6. The military and naval defence of the commonwealth and
the several states.
Then there are matters which may, perhaps, be con-
sidered as a fuller enumeration of the subject of trade
and commerce, such as navigation, fisheries, census,
and what may be called generally mercantile law.
It is also proposed to give to the parliament of tho
commonwealth power to deal with the subjects of
naturalisation of aliens, marriage and divorce, immi-
gration and emigration, the influx of criminals, exter-
nal affairs and treaties, and the relations of the
commonwealth to the islands of the Pacific. All
these matters, I think, require no comment —at any
rate, not at the present moment. Another power to
which I -would call special attention is No. 27, which
reads as follows :
River navigation with respect to the common purposes of
two or more states or parts of the commonwealth.
That is a matter which requires careful consideration,
and which received careful consideration from the
committee, who chose these words as best indicating
the precise object intended. Another, perhaps, some-
what novel subject is:
The control of railways with respect to transport for the
purposes of the commonwealth.
Of course it is necessary for the purposes of the
commonwealth that it should have the control over
all means of communication. Another provision to
which I desire to call special attention is No. 30,
which reads thus :
►
The exercise within the commonwealth, at the request or
with the concurrence of the parliaments of all the states
concerned, of any legislative powers with respect to the
affairs of the territory of the commonwealth, or any
part of it, which can at the date of the establishment
of this constitution be exercised only by the Parliament
of the United Kingdom or by the Federal Council of
Australasia, but always subject to the provisions of
this constitution.
"Wo are aware, sir, that there are many things now
upon which the legislatures and governments of the
several Australian colonies may agree, and upon
which they may desire to see a law established; but
w r e are obliged, if w T e want that law made, to go to
the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and ask
them to be good enough to make the law for us; and
■when it is made we will obey it. I contend, for
myself, as I have had an opportunity of saying
before, that after the federal parliament is established
anything which the legislatures of Australia want
done in the way of legislation should be done within
Australia, and the parliament of the commonwealth
should have that power. It is not proposed by this
provision to enable the parliament of the common-
wealth to interfere with the state legislatures ; but
only, Avhen the state legislatures agree in requesting
such legislation, to pass it, so that there shall be no
longer any necessity to have recourse to a parliament
beyond our own shores Avhen once this constitution
has been passed by the Parliament of the United
Kingdom. With respect to these subjects, it is not
proposed to give the parliament of the commonwealth
exclusive jurisdiction; they will have paramount


jurisdiction; but it is proposed that, until they exer-
cise those powers, the existing laws shall remain in
force, and that, until they choose to make laws to
the contrary, the state legislatures may go on exer-
cising their existing powers. It is only when the
federal parliament comes to the conclusion that it is
necessary to make laws on those matters that the
powers of the states will be excluded, and then only
to the extent to which the federal legislature chooses
to exercise its functions. In addition to the powers
to be exercised in that way, not interfering with the
existing rights of states until the federal legislature
thinks it necessary to do so, it is proposed to give
some exclusive powers to the legislature of the
commonwealth. One of them is to deal with
the affairs of people of any race with respect to whom it is
deemed necessary to make special laws not applicable to the
general community ; but so that this power shall not extend
to authorise legislation with respect to the aboriginal native
race in Australia and the Maori race in New Zealand.
I am sorry that my late colleague and co-delegate
for Queensland, Mr. Macrossan, is not here to ex-
press his opinion on that proposal. I am satisfied,
notwithstanding that during all his political career
he was a representative of northern constituencies in
Queensland —constituencies where the question of
black labour was a burning one —that he would have
most cordially supported the proposal, and would
have insisted upon the necessity of that power
being given to the legislature of the commonwealth
of Australia, and not to the legislature of any parti-
cular state, because the introduction of an alien race
in considerable numbers into any part of the common-
wealth is a danger to the whole of the common-
wealth, and upon that matter the commonwealth
should speak, and the commonwealth alone.
Mr. Donaldson : Mr. Macrossan expressed him-
self to that effect!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Yes, in Brisbane. The
next subject of exclusive power relates to the govern-
ment of any territory which may, by the surrender
of any state or states, and the acceptance of the
parliament, become the seat of government of the
commonwealth. I need say nothing about that
subject. The next subject relates to departments
of government which are to be taken over by
the government of the commonwealth. As soon
as the parliament of the commonwealth takes over
these departments, it must alone have power to
control them ; but hon. members will find later on a
provision continuing all the existing laws of the
colonies on that subject until such laws are made by
the federal parliament. Then there is a formal enu-
meration of “ such other matters as are by this con-
stitution declared to be within the exclusive powers
of the parliament.” That may be said to be a clumsy
way of doing things ; but it was found to be imprac-
ticable to do it in any other way. Before I pass from
the subject of powers, I may mention a subject which
was anxiously considered by the committee—namely,
whether having enumerated so many powers, which
some people may say are to take away the autonomy
of the several legislatures, we ought not on the other
hand to have done as they did in Canada, and enu-
merated the subjects which are left to the state legis-
latures. It would have been, to begin with, un-
scientific, and, in the second place, it would have
been impossible, because I do not think that anybody
could attempt to enumerate them all. But I will
take this opportunity of just mentioning a few of the
subjects which are left, for the benefit of those who
think that this Convention has some sinister object
or desires in some sinister way to deprive the state
legislatures of their autonomy. Their constitutions,
the borrowing of money, the complete control of the
government of the stale, all the laws relating to pro-
perty and civil rights, the whole subject of public
lands and mines, registration of titles, education,
criminal law and its enforcement, hospitals and such
matters, all local works and undertakings, municipa
institutions, imposition of licenses, the administra-
tion of justice, both criminal and civil, and the estab-
lishment of courts, and an absolute power to dis-
pose of their revenue in any way they think fit —these
are some of the subjects, and if they are not enough for
a state to exercise its functions upon, then the state
must be very eager to do a lot of work. I will ven-
ture to ask any member of the Convention, or any
person who thinks that by this scheme too much is
taken from the state legislatures, to take up any
volume of the statutes of the state legislatures, and
see how few of those statutes deal with subjects
with respect to which powers are taken from the
states. Having dealt generally with that branch of
the subject, the committee had next to consider the
vexed question of money bills. As to that, Ido not
think it is likely that any scheme will be propounded
that will satisfy everybody; but the committee have
proposed a method of dealing with money bills which
they, or at least a majority of them, submit with con-
siderable confidence. We recognise that in a federa-
tion the laws —and the laws affecting money as
well as others—must be passed by the consent of a
majority of the people of the commonwealth and also
with the consent of a majority of the states ; but it
must also be recognised that if both houses were to
have absolutely equal rights in respect of money and
taxation bills there would be danger of serious fric-
tion and of the machinery of government not work-
ing. That is not desired. It is not proposed by the
bill to enable either house to coerce the other. It is
proposed, however, to give to the upper house, that
is to say, the senate, that power of veto which must
be enjoyed by any house if it is to be a house of
legislature at all ; but it is not proposed to give it the
power to amend in detail bills for the annual appro-
priation of revenue and for the imposition of taxa-
tion. The senate is, of course, entitled to have its
opinion upon such matters heard. With the excep-
tion of those two classes of bills, it is proposed—and
I venture to think in accordance with the general
result of discussion which took place in the Conven-
tion—to give an equal right of amendment to both
houses ; but, as to those two classes of bills it is
proposed that although the senate shall not be entitled
to amend them, they may,if they so desire, point out to
the house of representatives any objectionable items.
This they will have the opportunity to do, so that it
may not be necessary for them to take the extreme
course of rejecting a bill because they do not like
something in it, or that, on the other hand, they may
not be compelled to adopt something which they
believe to be wrong. They will at least be entitled
to make known their opinion to the other branch of
the legislature. The suggested method, or compro-
mise, as it may, perhaps, be called, has been working
in South Australia for many years, and, I am told,
with great success. I, for my part, feel very confi-
dent in recommending it, as far as an individual
member of the Convention is entitled to do so, to the
consideration and acceptance of the Convention.
Careful provision is made against the coercion of the
senate by what is commonly called tacking—that is,
the putting of a disputed provision into a bill dealing
with the general subjects of appropriation or taxa*
tion. It is proposed that a bill dealing with taxation
shall deal—excepting, of course, in the case of the
imposition of customs duties—with one subject of
taxation only, and that any extraordinary expenditure
shall not be included in the ordinary appropriation
bill of the year. These provisions will give the senate
power to do anything except interfere with the carry-
ing on of the ordinary government of the federation,
and that would be a very undesirable thing for them
to do. Ido not propose to say anything further
now as to that clause. It will doubtless receive
in the Convention as careful consideration as it
received at the hands of the committee. I refer to


clause 55, chapter i. The 2nd chapter deals with
the subject of executive government, which is
declared to be vested in the Queen, and to be
exercised by a governor-general as her representa-
tive. It is to include a government appointed by her
Majesty's representative, and holding office during
his pleasure. This part of the bill practically
embodies what is known to us as the British Consti-
tution as we have it working at the present time ;
but the provisions of the bill are not made so rigid
that our successors will not be able to work out such
modifications as their experience may lead them to
think preferable. It is proposed that the ministers
of state, the number of whom at first, and until the
provision has been altered by the federal parliament,
shall not exceed seven, may sit in either house of
parliament. That is the practice under w T hat we
know as the British Constitution, and no doubt under
the practical working of our constitution ministers
here will also be required to sit in parliament, except
in cases where a minister may for a longer or a
shorter time be unable to obtain a seat there. It is
not proposed that ministers excepting office shall
submit themselves for re-election. Considering the
extent of territory, the distance which some of them
might have to travel, and the possibility of delay and
inconvenience in the administration of the govern-
ment —for these, and many other reasons, it w r as not
considered necessary to insist upon the adoption of
that rule. The appointment of the civil service it is
proposed to vest in the governor-general-in-council.
These provisions introduce what we call respon-
sible government —not necessarily party government,
which is another division of responsible govern-
ment, but a government responsible in name and
form to the head of the state and in substance
to the parliament of the commonwealth. It is pro-
posed that its executive authority shall be co-extensive
with its legislative power. That follows as a
matter of course. In immediately starting the busi-
ness of the commonwealth, it is provided that
certain powers may be taken over at once by the
executive government of the commonwealth, namely
as to customs, excise, posts and telegraphs, military
and naval defence, ocean beacons and buoys and
ocean lighthouses and lightships, and quarantine.
Other matters are left to be dealt with by the federal
legislature from time to time as they may think fit.
The 3rd chapter deals with the federal judicature.
The report of the Committee on Constitutional
Machinery embodies in substance, though not in
form, the recommendations of the Judiciary Com-
mittee. It is proposed to authorise the establish-
ment of a supreme court of Australia to have juris-
diction to entertain appeals from the supreme courts
of the several states—that is to say, there is to be an
optional right of appeal to that court on the part
of any person desiring to appeal —and it is proposed
to give to the parliament of the commonwealth
power to say that all appeals should be taken to
that court instead of to the Privy Council, and that
its decision shall be final, except in certain specified
cases embodying practically the limitations now
applied in the administration of her Majesty's pre-
rogative of allowing appeals to herself from Canada—
that is to say, that when the public interests of the
commonwealth, or of any other part of the Queen's
dominions, are concerned, the prerogative to allow an
appeal to the Queen herself in Council is reserved.
These cases are few in number, and I know that
many members of the Convention think that even
this exception should not be included. Others,
again, are of opinion that there should be a provision
expressly giving the right of appeal to her Majesty
in all cases. It is proposed also to establish what
may be called courts of first instance to administer
the laws of the commonwealth in the different parts of
the commonwealth, and to give these courts in certain
cases jurisdiction which may be exclusive of, or con-
current with, that of the courts of the states. The
next chapter deals with the subject of finance and trade.
We all know that this branch of the subject has given
rise to certain difficulties. The collection of revenue
is comparative!} 7 a simple matter; but when you come
to deal with its distribution after it is collected a
difficulty arises. It is proposed that the federal
parliament shall have the sole power to impose customs
d uties, and also excise duties upon those articles upon
which customs duties are collected, and to grant
bounties ; but that power is not to be taken away
from the states until the Federal Parliament has
imposed such duties ; but when once uniform duties
of customs are imposed for the commonwealth, then
the powers of all the states to impose duties of
customs or excise, or to grant bounties, are to come to
an end. In the meantime the duties will be collected
by the federal officers, and with the control of customs
and excise will pass over the necessary property
belonging to them. In the meantime, also, the
present laws will continue, but as soon as uniform
duties are imposed, the trade of the commonwealth
by any means is to be absolutely free. Every member
of the Convention knew that a provision of that
nature must be in the constitution. A great difficulty
has been experienced in dealing with the question of
the apportionment of the revenue. The provisions
of the constitution in that respect will no doubt
receive very full discussion in the Convention, as
indeed they should, because in considering whether
the states wi l l adopt the constitution or not, it is very
important to be able to make it plain to them that
they will not be doing themselves a serious injury in
trade or revenue. The main principle laid down here
is that after the expenses of the government of the
commonwealth have been deducted from the revenue,
the balance shall be returned to the states as nearly
as possible in proportion to the amounts contributed
by them. That of course is a difficult thing to work
out,
Hon. Members : Hear, Hear !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I ask hon. gentlemen
to bear in mind an observation once made to me by
a very distinguished governor of this colony, that
when there are several courses possible, and you
determine to follow one, everybody at once can see
all the objections to that course, but they say nothing
about the objections to all the other possible courses.
Therefore I ask hon. members when they consider
this difficult question, and when they see all the
objections to the one course proposed, to also look at
the objections to the other possible courses, so that
they may see on which side the objections are the
greater. There are objections and practical difficul-
ties in the way of any mode of adjusting this question
so as to deal fairly with the states and the common-
wealth. I have pointed out how this is proposed to
be done. The great difficulty —and it is a difficulty
peculiar to this constitution, as far as I have any
knowledge—is that the customs revenue of the
colonies in all cases forms a very large share of the
means of meeting the expenses of government; and
as we should take over only a very small part of the
expenditure, the commonwealth would start with an
enormous annual surplus of many millions, which it
could not retain or expend, but must return to the
different states. That is a difficulty almost as great
as the difficulty of making a levy upon the different
states as states. It is a great difficulty, but we have
to face it, and the question is, what is to be done ?
As long as we deal with the existing customs duties
there is no difficulty, because wo know exactly what
each state raises. But this must not be forgotten :
that the circumstances of the various parts of Aus-
tralia with regard to the consumption of dutiable
articles are very different. The consumption in some
colonies is at least double what it is in other colonies.
For instance, one colony may have a very large
proportion of its population composed of persons


who do not consume a large quantity of dutiable
articles, whereas the case might be quite the reverse
with another colony of the group. Take a colony
with a specially sober, thrifty, and frugal population,
like, say, that of South Australia, where there is a
large proportion of non-consumers of dutiable
articles. They would receive very much more than
they paid in customs duties if the surplus were
returned in proportion to the population. In the
case of other colonies which did not possess the same
class of population they would get back much less
than they contributed to the customs revenue.
These facts cannot be lost sight of. If we were a
complete homogeneous commonwealth, with similar
population in all its parts, the conditions would be
equal; but I cannot look forward to such a state of
things when I take into consideration the difference
in the climate in the north and the south, and the
different conditions of life which must always pre-
vail. This difficulty exists, and you must bear it in
mind in solving the question. I myself believe that
some day the difficulty will be found to be so great
that the federal parliament and the parliaments of
the different states will come together and make pro-
vision for transferring on a fair basis such obliga-
tions of the states to the commonwealth as will
absorb all the federal revenue. It must come to
that, because the inconvenience will be found to be
so great. In the meantime we have this great sur-
plus, and we have to make provision to meet the
difficulty. At present we derive a very large share
of our revenue from customs duties ; but it does
not follow that that will always be the case. I
think myself that it will always be the case ; but
that is only a matter of opinion. We must have
power to impose direct taxation, and the imposition
of direct taxation would be as unequal, or it might be
as unequal, as the imposition of customs duties. Eor
instance, a stock-tax might be imposed. I mention
a tax on that particular kind of property because it has
been discussed in many of the parliaments. If such a
tax were imposed, New South Wales and Queensland
would pay about two-thirds of the whole, which would
be somewhat unfair. I point out these matters now
in order to ask hon. gentlemen to bear them in mind
when they are considering this proposal. We felt
that there are so many difficulties in the way that
every member of the committee will feel indebted to
members of the Convention who will debate the
matter fully.
Sir Joinv Beat : Did the committee get any help
from the Einance Committee on that point ?
Sir SAMUEL GEIEEITH : Yes; and I hope we
shall get further help. It is only fair to point out
that in this particular we have not followed the
recommendation of the Einance Committee. The
Einance Committee had not considered the question
of the proceeds of direct taxation. Direct taxation
in proportion to the population would bring about
quite as strange anomalies as there are in connection
with the customs revenue.
Sir John Beat: Why impose taxes which you do
not want ?
Sir SAMUEL GEIEEITH: We do not know
what taxes we may want; and we are framing a consti-
tution for the future. I believe the, customs duties
will be absorbed by increasing expenditure until the
surplus is gone; but in the meantime we must try to
bring about the most perfect fairness we can. The
disposition of the surplus must be provided for in
some way. As I have said, there are great difficulties
in working this out. We suggest, as a means of
working it out, the principle of distribution in pro-
portion to the amount contributed, which, if it can
be worked out, would, I maintain, be perfectly fair.
An estimate should be made of the dutiable goods
consumed in the different states, and the duties col-
lected upon them ; and each state should get credit
for the revenue paid by it to the commonwealth in
respect of the duties on goods actually consumed in
that state. It cannot be done with absolute accuracy.
It is a matter upon which I know experts differ.
Some of the experts in the colonies say it cannot be
done ; others say they see no difficulty whatever in
doing it, and are prepared to show those who say it
cannot be done how to do it. It is not my function
at the present time to do anything more than point
out the state of the matter; it is not my business to
argue on either side. I should say here that pro-
vision is made that until the parliament of the
commonwealth has made the necessary provision for
carrying on the government by legislation, the existing
laws of the states shall apply to the collection of
money, to audit, and to the administration of the
departments, and so on. There is a provision also
that the parliament of the commonwealth may take
over the whole or any part of the debts of the
different states; but as that is a matter involving
each in a liability for the debts of the others, it is
proposed that it shall only be done with unanimous
consent. Chapter y deals with the question of the
states, and I will read the Ist clause, because it is a
very important one, and ought, I think, to remove
from the minds of those who think that we are here
engaged in prosecuting a conspiracy against the
liberties of the states —I believe there are such
people—it ought to remove that impression from
their minds, because we say :
(1.) All powers which at the date of the establishment of
the commonwealth are vested in the parliaments of the several
colonies, and which are not by this constitution exclusively
vested in the parliament of the commonwealth, and all
powers which the parliaments of the several states are not
by this constitution forbidden to exercise, are reserved to, and
shall remain vested in, the parliaments of the states respect-
ively.
That is to say, all existing powers are reserved except
those taken away, and state legislation will remain
until superseded by federal legislation. Then, there
is a clause to which I should refer —the sth of
chapter v—which proposes that the govern or-general
shall be the only medium of communication with the
outer world ; that, in point of fact, Australia is to be
one —one government to the outer world—that all
communications to her Majesty, or anybody else that
are made outside of Australia, shall be made through
the governor-general; that her Majesty’s pleasure
shall be communicated through him in all cases in
which it is necessary to be communicated to any part
or state of Australia. Without some such provision,
of course, we should still be sovereign states, all,
perhaps, pulling in different directions at Downing-
street, and giving rise to the same sort of difficulty
of which we have seen so much in the past few years.
It is proposed, as we were directed to do, to make
provision to enable the parliaments of the states to
deal with the appointment of their governors. We
do not interfere with them. We propose to give them
power to deal with that matter, and that this should
be part of the constitution of the commonwealth.
Colonel Smith : You compel them to go to the
governor-general for confirmation of their bills !
Sir SAMUEL GEIEEITH: Certainly not. It is
not proposed to give the governor-general or the par-
liament of the commonwealth any power of inter-
ference whatever with the states; but to make
the governor-general the channel of communication
with the Queen, which is a very different thing,
and which I venture to think is necessary if Aus-
tralia is to present one united front. It is proposed
not to allow members of the federal parliament to
sit in the local parliaments. Much may be said on
either side, but that is the provision we propose.
With respect to the admission of new states into the
commonwealth, it is proposed to let all those who do


not come in at once come in afterwards—that is, the
existing colonies—and then to allow the parliament
of the commonwealth to admit others from time to
time, and on doing so to impose conditions as to the
extent of representation in either house of parlia-
ment. It may be said that that is unreasonable;
whether such conditions should be imposed in a
particular instance, is a matter, I think, that may be
open to a great deal of argument in each case.
But, take an illustration: Suppose it were proposed
to divide Western Australia into two states, would
it be reasonable to give those two states between
them sixteen members in the senate, or would the
parliament be likely to admit a state under those
conditions P The same question might be asked if
it were proposed to divide Queensland into three
states. Would the parliament of the commonwealth
be likely to agree to give them twenty-four
senators ? I mention that merely to show that the
matter is one that must be considered. Then there
is a provision enabling the parliament of the
commonwealth to deal with the provisional admin-
istration of parts of territories either in Australia or
in the Pacific which are not fit to be admitted to the
full rights of a state. I may mention, by way of
illustration, the north-western part of Australia, and
also Eiji, and New Guinea, which I apprehend will,
when the commonwealth is established, become an
appanage of the commonwealth, and not be
attached, as it is at the present time, to the colony of
Queensland. But the powers of the parliament of
the commonwealth to exercise any of these functions
are expressly limited so that they cannot be put in
force without the consent of the parliament of
the state affected. The rights of the state in
regard to territory and everything else are preserved
absolutely intact. Nothing can be done except by
the consent of the states themselves. The vexei
question of the capital had to be considered, and we
propose that it shall be determined by the federal
parliament; but in the meantime, as there must be
some place where the first parliament shall meet, that
the governors of the several states that come first
into the confederation shall determine the question
among themselves, and that if they are equally
divided in opinion, then the governor-general shall
determine it. There must be some method, and we
suggest that as a reasonable one. With respect to
amendments of the constitution, it is proposed that
a law to amend the constitution must be passed by
an absolute majority of both the senate and the house
of representatives ; that, if that is done, the proposed
amendment must be submitted for the opinion of the
people of the states to be expressed in conventions
elected for the purpose, and that then if the amend-
ment is approved by a majority of the conventions
in the states it shall become law, subject of course
to the Queen's power of disallowance. Otherwise
the constitution might be amended, and by a few
words the commonwealth turned into a republic,
which is no part of the scheme proposed by this bill.
I should say a word before I sit down as to the mode
in which this constitution should be adopted. There
are two ways of adopting a constitution like this.
One is for the Parliament of the United Kingdom
to pass a bill creating a constitution, and then to
leave the different colonies one after the other to
come in and give their adhesion to it, so that
when a certain prescribed number have given their
adhesion, the confederation shall be constituted
by the Queen's proclamation. That is one way,
and it was the plan adopted in the case of the
federal constitution of Australasia, and, as far as
legislation w r as concerned, in the case of the
South African Confederation, which did not come
to anything because the states never came in. The
other way is to frame a constitution, and let it be
adopted by the colonies, or a certain number of them,
and then for the Parliament of the United Kingdom,
at the request of those colonies, to constitute them a
confederation. That is the course we propose ot
follow. This constitution has been framed as an
instrument of government which may be accepted by
a state or not. If a sufficient number of states give
their adhesion to it, then the powers of the Imperial
Parliament, which are the only powers at present
existing for the purpose, should be exercised and a
confederation established. That is what, technically,
I think we were directed to do, though, no doubt, we
should not have hesitated to suggest another plan if
we had seen anything to recommend it. The adop-
tion of this constitution, with such amendments as
the Convention may make, should be followed by a
recommendation—it canbe no more, —to the different
parliaments to make provision for submitting it for
the adoption of the people in such a way as the Con-
vention may direct, with the recommendation also
that when three of the states shall adopt the consti-
tution their governments shall be authorised to request
the Government of Her Majesty in Great Britain to
introduce the necessary legislation. This will, how-
ever, of course form the subject of subsequent and
substantive resolutions in the Convention after the
adoption of the constitution, I have endeavoured to
explain the bill as briefly as I could, and in conclusion
I have only to say that we have given it our best
attention; we have endeavoured, with what success
it is for others to say, to form a plan which, so far
as regards simplicity of structure and language, will
not be unworthy of the English tongue; andas regards
the more important matter, the substance, we have
endeavoured, with what success it is again for others to
say, to lay down abroad and just foundation upon which
a commonwealth may be established in the southern
seas that will dominate those seas, of which any man
may be proud to be a citizen, and which will be a
permanent glory to the British empire.
Mr. WEIXON: I do not know whether it is the
desire of the Convention to continue the discussion
on this motion to-night. If it is not, I beg to move:
That the debate be now adjourned.
Mr. McMILLAN: This might be the proper
stage at which to decide whether the discussion
should be continued practically as a second reading
debate, or whether we should go into Committee at
once. I think it will be well to decide this evening
as to the course which it is intended to pursue. As
far as I have been able to ascertain, the general view
is'that we should go into Committee at once.
Mr. DONALDSON: I have not had an oppor-
tunity of reading the bill, and I do not think that
hon. members who have not been members of the
committees have been able to form an opinion upon
it. Therefore, I think it will be far better to adjourn
the debate now, and to let the discussion of the
whole bill take place before we go into Committee,
because in Committee a member is supposed to speak
only on the clause before the Committee, If we
now discuss the bill as a whole, any amendments
that are to be proposed can be made in Committee
afterwards. It will be far more convenient to have
a second reading discussion of the bill as if it were
before Parliament.
Hon, Membees : No !
Mr. DONALDSON: That is my opinion, and I
would strongly support Mr. "Wrixon’s motion.
Mr. BAKEE : I would point out that it is
extremely unfair for members of the Convention who
have not been on the committees, and who have just
seen the bill for the first time, not to be allowed to
discuss the measure as a whole. The various points
are so interdependent on each other that when we
get into Committee—if we are confined to the parti-
cular clause under discussion—w r e cannot properly
give publicity to our opinions. There are a great
NATIONAL AUSTEALASIAN CONVENTION, 1891


number of members of the Convention who have been
on the committees, and who have had opportunities
during the last fortnight of studying all these points.
But we who have not been members of the com-
mittees think it only right that we should have an
opportunity of placing on record our opinion of the
scheme as a whole. I strongly object to being
debarred from discussing this important measure so
far as it is a whole scheme.
Sir JOHN BRAT: None of us would wish to
prevent the full discussion of the bill; but I trust
that we shall not each consider it necessary to give
our views on the scheme as a whole before going into
Committee and again afterwards to go into every
detail. If we do that we shall find, after we have
gone through the details of the bill, that we shall
have a desire to go into a discussion on the Avhole
scheme as it comes out of Committee. That is the
most important stage at which we shall arrive, what-
ever we may say on the bill as it stands now. It is
not a bill to every detail of which the Committee
themselves are pledged. Certain alterations will be
made in it in Committee of the Whole, and it will be
far more important for us, and for the people of
Australia, to know the opinion of the delegates upon
the bill, as it comes out of Committee than to know
their opinion of it before it goes into Committee. I,
for one, will not agree to prevent members from
giving full expression to their opinions; but I ask
members not to consider it necessary to express their
opinions at too great a length on the bill as it stands
now. I can soon express my opinions upon the bill.
I do not quite like it altogether, but I can say all
that I have to say when we get into Committee.
Although I feel confident that no one would wish to
debar Mr. Baker, or any other member, from giving
full expression to his opinions, I ask him to consider
the importance of letting the people know what we
think of the bill after it comes out of Committee.
Mr. MACDONALD-PATERSON: I cordially
support the motion of the hon. member, Mr. Wrixon,
that the debate be adjourned, and for these reasons:
I think it was suggested —and not only suggested,
but really declared and understood by every member
of the Convention —that when this bill came before
the Convention it would be treated as a bill that was
before us for the second reading. Hon. members
have only to refer to what transpired some ten days
ago to clearly recollect that that was the common
understanding. The next reason is that nearly half
of the members of the Convention were not on any
of the committees at all, and under the circumstances
it is but fair that the request of the hon. member,
Mr. Baker, should be acceded to at once, and that we
should have an opportunity of going through the
bill, which we have only for the first time seen a
little while ago, in order to decide whether we shall
speak on it. If we do speak, lam certain that the
same quality of compression will characterise the
observations to be made on this draft bill which has
been displayed by every member of the Convention.
I sincerely trust that members of the Convention
who think that we are looking to the public opinion
in our separate colonies on the bill as it may come
out of Committee, will not prevent hon. members
from speaking at the present stage.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Convention adjourned at 452 p.m.
WEDNESDAY, 1 APRIL, 1891.
Commonwealth of Australia Bill—Adjournment.
The President took the chair at II a.m.
COMMONWEALTH OE AUSTRALIA BILL.
Debate resumed (from 31st March) on motion by
Sir Samuel Griffith:
That the draft bill to constitute the Commonwealth of
Australia, brought up by the Constitutional Committee, be
referred for the consideration of a Committee of the Whole
Convention.
Mr. WRIXON: I desire to ask the attention of
the Convention for a short time to the consideration
of this bill before it goes into Committee. I think
that is the best course to shorten proceedings and to
save time, for I have generally found in parliament-
ary procedure that where a bill is allowed to go
without discussion on the second reading, on the
understanding that it is to be discussed in Commit-
tee, more time is lost than saved. I wish to point
out certain features in the bill which I should be
glad to see amended ; and I prefer to give notice of
the points upon which I think the bill requires
amendment rather than bring them forward at a
moment’s notice when we are in Committee. I
desire to say that I think our thanks are due to the
Constitutional Committee that has so carefully and
ably discharged its duty in framing the prin-
ciples of the bill, and are also due to my hon.
and learned friend, Sir Samuel Griffith, for the
effective manner in which he has embodied those
principles in the bill. So much ami impressed with
the value of the bill as it stands, that if I could get
no other form of federation than this I would be pre-
pared to take it even as it stands. But, nevertheless,
I think there are certain points in which it requires
amendment, and which it behoves us to endeavour, if
possible, to get amended; because we must observe
that when we go back to our different provinces we
hope to get the bill adopted in those provinces, and
adopted without further amendment on their part.
It is, therefore, very important for us to see what
principles we settle upon here. Also I notice, on
referring to the bill itself, that whenever it comes
into operation it will be exceedingly difficult to
amend it. There must be an absolute majority of
the dominion parliament in the first place, and then
there must be a vote of conventions in all the states,
giving a majority thereto in each separate state,
before any amendments can be made in the bill. We,
therefore, are engaged, in a very serious matter, and
it behoves us to look carefully to the principles of
the bill of which we are asked to approve. I think
the plan of the bill is good. I think it carries out
what we agreed to in certain resolutions in the
Convention. It is not proposed by us, and it
is not proposed in the bill, to make a unified
government. Certain powers are given to the
federal parliament which are specified in the bill,
and everything outside those powers is left under
this scheme of constitution to the states. That is
the scheme which we have had before us, and
that is the scheme embodied in this bill. Ido not
think there need be the slightest fear on the part
of those who represent states —I do not think there
need be the slightest fear as far as that portion of
the bill goes —of the rights of the states being
entrenched upon. The different subjects which the
federal parliament is to legislate upon are carefully
specified, and I think it would be hard, in going over
the list, to point out any topics which do not prop-
erly belong to the federal parliament. If, however,
there are any, if any hon. member of the Convention
thinks there are any, that, of course, will be matter
for full consideration in Committee, and we can
eliminate any power which we do not think ought to
be given to the federal parliament. Therefore, so


far, I think the bill faithfully carries out our view,
and may command our approbation. But there is a
portion of the hill, namely the latter portion, which
is devoted to the states, chapter Y, headed "The
States," which seems to me to depart from this
principle upon which we have agreed, and to interfere
with the states in a manner not consistent with a
unified government. Eor example, I find in chapter
Y a provision arranging for the states having power
to appoint or elect their own governors. Now, I am
not aware of how that comes within our Convention,
or of how it comes within the scope of this federal
government which is not a unified government. It
is not a matter concerned with our federation ; it is
not analagous to the case of Canada, where the
different states were presided over by deputies
appointed by the governor-general. Here are vast de-
pendencies, whose position is not to be interfered with,
except in regard to certain specified topics of legisla-
tion, and we are asked to go out of our way and provide
for them power to elect their own governors. That
seems to me an instance of our gratuitously inter-
fering with what is the business of the states, and
importing into our task —which, I am sure, is difficult
enough already —a new difficulty. I doubt whether
a majority of people will approve of this proposal to
enable us to have an elected governor, with the
system of responsible government known to the
English Constitution. I do not see how the two
would very well work. An elected governor would,
no doubt, be the most powerful politician w r hom his
party could produce, and they would take care to.
run —as the American phrase is—for this office of
governor the strongest political man that they could
get. That is all very well if you are in America,
and if you are dealing with the American form of
constitution; but if you are going to have the
English form of responsible government, I do not
see how the two would fit together. It seems to me
a genuine case of putting new wine into old bottles.
I apprehend that under such arrangement the Vast
prerogatives of the Crown, and they are very vast,
would revive and become a reality in this prominent
politician w r ho would be in the governor's chair, and
who thus would not merely reign, but govern. He
would naturally feel bound hy a spirit of allegiance
to the party w r ho put him there, so that if he had a
ministry for the time belonging to another party, I
apprehend, without any imputation on his honesty,
or the slightest reflection on his general integrity,
that he would be very apt to lean towards facilitating
the party to which he belonged rather than the
party of his responsible ministers. In truth, the
two things are incompatible, and if you mean
to keep up the English Constitution, you had
better not take the American system of electing
governors. I merely point that out to show the
difficulty you have when you go out of your way to
interfere in a matter which seems to me not within
our function, and which is a matter entirely for the
states to determine as they think proper. Another
point in which it seems to me that this bill departs
in chapter v from the principle with which it started
is where it provides that all references to the Queen
from any province or state must be made through
the G-overnor-General. That would be very well if
you had a unified government; but w r ith our vast
territories, with our vast states, I apprehend it would
be found highly inconvenient. Suppose, for example,
that the Attorney-General in any state desired to
convey advice to her Majesty—that would, of course,
be to her responsible adviser at home—with regard
to any bill which was in the province, or with regard
to any proceeding in which the province got involved,
he would be in this somewhat awkward, and, I think,
humiliating position, that he would have to send his
advice and all his papers through the governor-
general of the dominion. That seems to me to be
going out of our way to unify, contrary to the
principle on which we started in the bill, which is
not to unify, but to pick out certain matters which
we give to the federal government, and as to the
rest to leave the states untouched. Another power
which, I think, transgresses the principle on which
the bill starts, and which is also contained in chapter
v, is a power given herein to the federal parliament
to annul the state laws in certain cases. That seems
to me a very serious power, and an inadvisable one.
If the state law has exceeded its functions, there is
no need to annul it, because it is void in so far
as it goes beyond its functions, and any person
affected by it can raise the question in any court
and have it determined by a competent legal tri-
bunal, whether or not the law which the state
has passed is within its functions. That is the
course taken in the United States. A state there
may pass a law which it is quite incompetent
to pass, but the central government never thinks of
annulling it, or of interfering with it, but leaves it to
the operation of the law, and that is found to work
satisfactorily. If a law touches and affects nobody,
no harm is done; if it does touch or affect anybody,
he can go to a competent tribunal and have the law
declared invalid ; but in this case, if we retain such
power as this, we shall put the federal parliament in
the position of sitting as a sort of master over the
provincial or states parliaments, and taking on itself
to judge whether or not a law should be annulled.
I think this is a case in which w r e are exceeding our
power, and are departing from the principle with
which we started. I think also that the provision
contained in another part of the bill, enabling the
federal parliament at any time to confer with regard
to any matter original jurisdiction on the Supreme
Court, and thereby to oust the jurisdiction of the
states courts, is exceeding the lines which we have
sketched out for ourselves, for at any time we might
find that the federal parliament would step in and
take away some important function which the states
courts had been discharging. No limit is placed to
it—no bounds are assigned. I think that that is a
case in which we are departing from the principle of
not having a unified government. lam afraid, sir,
that you will find, if we adopt these provisions, that
not alone are you impairing the principle on which
I understand we go, but you are creating a feeling
of alarm in the states as to how far they are
giving over their rights, privileges, and liberties in
submitting to this federation. Therefore, to that
extent I would be happy to see the bill amended,
and I would be glad if those in charge of the bill
would consider these points before we get into
Committee, because I know from experience how
unfair it is to any one in charge of a bill to start
points and endeavour to make amendments at the
legislative table: nothing can be more unfair. If
amendments are to be made, they ought to be made
on deliberation and consideration, and I therefore
hope that this view which I have presented will be
considered, and that the clauses which I have indi-
cated in chapter Y will not be insisted upon when we
get into Committee. The next point to which I
would ask the attention of the Convention is the
question of state rights and finance. Hon. members,
sir, are aware how this question arises. It is a very
important question, and it is worth thinking over for
a moment how we come to be faced with it. Of course
it arises in this way: We have already agreed, when
the House was sitting in Convention, to the principle
of giving every state, however small, the same repre
sentation in the senate as has any state, however
large. Thus, Western Australia, with 40,000 or 50,000
inhabitants, has precisely the same voice in the senate
with New South Wales, with 1,250,000 inhabitants.
It thus becomes a very serious question what sort of
body this senate is to be, because if you make the
senate a very powerful body and give it a very
controlling position, then most certainly you ar&


providing for the government of the mass of the
population by a very small proportion of the popu-
lation, and the fact' that they live in certain dis-
tricts, or states, does not get over the difficulty. If
you make the senate strong, you enable a few to
govern the majority, and, in particular, if you give
the senate a controlling voice in finance, you
undoubtedly enable it to govern the government.
For nothing is more certain under our English system
of government, where you have the administration
of the day in parliament, than that the legislative
power which dominates finance will really control the
government. Any of us may know that from our
experience in our own province. We know what
would happen if an upper house were able to control
the financial operations of the government. And
undoubtedly in this case of the senate, which will be
a more permanent body than the house of represen-
tatives, and a more select body perhaps, if you give
the senate power over finance, you give to the repre-
sentatives of the very few a great power over the
government of the majority. That is tfie importance
of this whole question. I sympathise with the
efforts which the Constitutional Committee have
made to get over this difficulty. I am quite aware of
the difficulty which it presents, and 1 do not wish to
pose as simply raising objections, and not being in a
position to appreciate the question with which they
had to grapple, and with which they grappled in the
manner which hon. members see in the bill. They
set out that money bills are to originate in the house
of representatives, and they go on to make certain
provisions which are limitations on the ancient rights
of lower houses under the English system, but with
which I quite agree, and which are perfectly reason-
able limitations, namely, that a tax bill is to be con-
fined to one object, and that the appropriation bill is
to be confined to the expenditure for the year; and
then they go on to what we are asked to believe is to
be a settlement of this financial difficulty between
the two houses, and they provide in a paragraph
which is before hon. members, that, with regard to
those bills which the senate may not amend, it at any
time may send a message to the house of representa-
tives asking it to strike out any particular item, and
that thereupon the house of representatives may
eliminate it if it likes. The difficulty which I feel
about accepting this as a solution of the question is
first the ambiguity as to the meaning of the clause,
and secondly, the fact that it makes no provision
for finality. As to what the clause means, I confess
that that is undoubtedly a difficulty, and there can-
not be a better proof of the difficulty than the fact
that we ourselves here now interpret it differently.
Of course it may be useful, I admit, if you simply
want to get a thing passed, because in that light you
can put the provision in two aspects. If you address
a people's-rights man, you can say, " True, that pro-
vision is in the bill, but it means nothing; it is only
providing that that may be done which may be done
now. Any upper house may lay aside any bill, or
send a message down to the lower house, and request
it to be amended, and if the lower house chooses to
amend the bill it may. Therefore, my people's-rights
friend, you need not be alarmed—it is nothing but
the ordinary law." If, however, you want to satisfy
a state-rights man, it can be put in a different light.
You can say, " The mere fact that this new provision
is there shows that something is intended. This
clause makes arrangements for the senate scrutinis-
ing the details of the estimates, which function does
not properly belong to an upper house now; but it
provides for so doing, and it provides the machinery
for it objecting to any item of which it may dis-
approve. If the house of representatives will not
accept that machinery, and will not act upon it, then,
according to the plain meaning of this bill, the senate
is entitled to fall back on its right to reject, and that
not a right such as now belongs to upper houses—a
right to be exercised in an extremity, but a right
to be exercised in the ordinary vindication of its
undoubted privilege under this bill to scrutinise
items in money bills and in the appropriation bill.”
In fact, this power of rejecting in toto money bills,
which is now only the occasional medicine of the
constitution, under this bill will become its daily
food, and whenever the upper house finds that the
house of representatives refrains from respecting its
wishes it is clearly entitled under that clause to throw
out money bills altogether. The difficulty, I feel,
is in our accepting as a solution a proposition which
is two-faced, and which you may read in one way or
in another way, reminding us, in fact, of what we
learnt in our school days of the oracles of old, who,
whenever they had to give a reply to some power-
ful potentate, whom it was disagreeable to offend,
produced a reply in words which might be read in
one way or in another way —in one way giving him
complete satisfaction in regard to his wishes, and in
the other way being quite contrary to his intentions.
That is the sort of oracular deliverance
Sir John Downer : The words are clear enough!
Mr, WRIXON : But the meaning is not. I con-
fess that at first when I read the provision I said,
“ Oh, that is nothing ; it can be done now ; we need
not trouble about it.”
Sir John Brat : Can it be done now ?
Mr. WRIXON: Certainly.
Sir John Bray: In Victoria?
Mr. WRIXON: Unquestionably.
An Hon. Member : No!
Mr. WRIXON ; Of course I do not say in so many
words what is contained here, but the same result can
be accomplished. The upper house may at any time
lay aside a bill.
Sir John Brat: And send a message afterwards!
Mr. WRIXON : I do not say when they send their
message.
Sir John Bray : The hon. member did just now !
Mr. WRIXON: It was a slip of the tongue. It
is a matter of indifference to me when the message is
sent. The point is that it can be done now under the
ordinary parliamentary procedure in regard to any
bill, and it has been done.
Colonel Smith : Asking for a committee !
Mr. WRIXON : Asking for a conference, or for
a committee. Apparently -with a view of strengthen-
ing the state-rights man’s idea of this question, I
notice in clause 54 that the old verbiage of all
acts of Parliament, I think, with regard to money
bills is dropped, and that they are not called money
bills any more, but laws.
Mr. Clark : Proposed laws !
Mr. WRIXON :No; it says laws —“ laws appro-
priating any part of the revenue”
Mr. Clark : They are not laws until they are
passed!
Mr. WRIXON : “Or laws imposing any tax” ;
and indeed it goes so far as, in clause 57, to fall into
a manifest slip such as, of course, might occur in
drafting any bill, because it says :
When a law passed bj the parliament is presented to the
governor-general for the Queen’s assent.
Mr. Clark : That is a slip!
Mr. WRIXON: Of course we all know that a bill
is not a law until it gets the Queen’s assent. But
apparently with the object, I say, of strengthening
the state-rights man’s view, and of showing that really
some new power is to be given, these bills are called
laws, which, I apprehend, is an inaccurate term.
Por example, in the case of an appropriation bill, the
preamble shows that it is different from an ordinary
law. Pinancial grants are grants by the mass of the
taxpayers to the government : they are different
from ordinary legislation, and they are subject to
different conditions. If I could get nothing better,


rather than see federation defeated I would take this
bill. But I am bound to point out that I think we
are only postponing the difficulty, I think we are
creating a difficulty with regard to the large states,
and to our getting the people of those states to assent
to this bill. I think that if the bill is assented
to, and should become law, you are only postponing
the difficulty of this Convention to the federal par-
liament, and that the question will still have to be
fought out as to what is the meaning of this clause,
for [undoubtedly a conflict of powers will exist.
There will be the states-right party in the federal
parliament anxious to make their weight felt, and
there will be the masses of the people represented
in the lower house anxious to govern, and in this
clause I am afraid you only provide a platform
for the fighting out of their differences. It is,
in short, a cul de sac —leading nowhere. There is
no solution. Therefore, I think that if you did
retain this clause, the least you could do ■would be to
add to it a proviso or sub-clause to the effect that
where this did happen, that is to say, that where the
senate sent down a representation with regard to a
certain item, and the lower house would not eliminate
it, the two houses should meet together and vote in
common. You would then have some end to the
question. At present there is none. You lead us
up to a certain point and there you leave us. You
guide the legislative bodies up to a point of antagonism
and there you bid them good-bye. You ought to go
further, and if you keep this method of procedure
you ought to provide either for the two houses voting
together, or, if you like, make a provision that after
a general election the voice of the lower house shall
prevail. That, of course, will not apply to the appro-
priation act, which must be kept separate, and which
cannot afford to wait. The next point to which I ask
the attention of the Convention is the establishment
of constitutional government, and this a question
which I address rather to my learned friend, Sir
Samuel Griffith, and to my other learned friends who
may be here. There is a portion of this bill estab-
lishing constitutional government, and I think it was
truly said yesterday that the effect of that portion
would be to establish in this federation in its ordinary
working responsible government. But the form in
which ministers are to be appointed, I think, wants a
little consideration, because it involves a very serious
point. In clause 4 of chapter ir, page 13, it is
provided:
For the administration of the executive government of the
commonwealth, the governor-general may, from time to time,
appoint officers to administer such departments of state of the
commonwealth as the governor-general in Council may from
time to time establish, and such officers shall hold office during
the pleasure of the governor-general, and shall be capable of
being chosen and of sitting as members of either houses of the
parliament.
How, the point I wish to draw attention to is that I
do not think the provision will convey to those officers
thus appointed by the governor the great power and
authority which, under the English system of govern-
ment, belongs to a responsible minister of the Crown.
That is something distinct from the position of an
officer appointed to administer a department. My
learned friends present will remember the remarkable
case of Buron versus Denman, in which the captain
of a ship of war had illegally destroyed certain pro-
perty of a trader. After that had been done Lord
Palmerston wrote a letter saying that he thoroughly
approved of what the captain had done. An action
was brought by the owner of the property which had
been illegally destroyed, and it was held by all the
judges at home that the mere fact of a minister of
the Crown writing a letter expressing approval em-
bodied the approbation of the Sovereign herself to
that act, although it was admitted, of course, that
she knew nothing whatever about it. That is a very
great power ; but it is a very essential power if you
are to have every day government satisfactorily
carried on. It is a vast power; but it is necessary
that it should be given to a minister of the Crown
under the system, and I am convinced that if the
question were raised hereafter as to whether one of
these officers appointed to administer a department
really stood in the shoes, to use a common expres-
sion, of one of her Majesty’s responsible ministers,
the courts would hold that he did not. They would
say, “ Here is a statutory provision as to what the
position is; nothing is said about responsible minis-
ter ; nothing is said about minister of the Crown
either. The officer is appointed to administer a
department.” ;
Mr. Clark : Head the last line. The clause pro-
vides that the officers shall be members of the federal
executive council!
Mr. "WRIXON: It does not connect them with
the Sovereign.
Mr. Clark: It makes them ministers; it is done
in Canada!
Mr. WBIXON : In Canada the act says ministers
shall be members of the Queen’s Privy Council.
Mr. Clark: It is the same thing here !
Mr. WTtIXON : I apprehend it is not the same.
At any rate, the question has never been raised in
Canada; but I think the question certainly would be
raised here; and, according to my view, I think
there can be little doubt but that the courts would
hold that ministers so appointed did not inherit
all the great powers of the Queen’s ministers, and
which powers are yet necessary for the carrying on
of the Government. If a -few words will meet this
point, I think it is most important that it should be
met. I will now say a few words about the question
of appeal to the Queen-in-Council. I observe that
the bill provides practically that that appeal shall be
taken away in all cases except where the public in-
terests are concerned. That is practically the effect of
the bill. I must say that I consider that a mistake.
I do not think we should take away the right of
appeal to the highest legal authority in the realm.
It is said that this limitation of the bill is based upon
the view which the Privy Council have taken of the
proper reading of the Canadian act, and that it merely
embodies that view. If that be so I would suggest
that we take the terms of the Canadian act also, and
leave the Privy Council, as they doubtless would, to
take the same view of them. That would meet the
difficulty. But as the matter stands you are in this
position ; you hold yourselves out to the world as
saying that you will not allow an appeal to the highest
legal tribunal in the realm unless there be some great
public question involved. But there are vast indus-
trial interests between England and these colonies ; a
vast amount of English capital is invested in these
colonies, there are vast mercantile negotiations and
businesses going on, intertwining one with the other,
and I apprehend that the owners of capital and the
projectors of business in the old country will view
with anything but satisfaction a determination on the
part of these colonies to prohibit them in the case of a
conflict involving large interests on their part from
having the opinion of the best judges in the land upon
the question involved. I would here remark, with
reference to the judicial part of the subject, that I
observe an appeal is given by the bill to the federal
court in criminal eases. That, with great respect, I
think a mistake, and I should be glad to see the pro-
vision omitted. I am not aware that it has been
asked for by any of the provinces, and the effect of
an appeal to the federal court in criminal cases, see-
ing that the court might be sitting at uncertain times,
would necessarily be to cause great delav, and to give
a great handle to persons who could command
means in some cases to render it almost impossible
to carry out the criminal Jaw. lam aware of the
popular and plausible argument, that when you give
an appeal as to a small amount of property, you ought
also to give it in regard to a man’s life. To that I


can only reply that the necessity of the thing is that
the criminal law should be promptly administered,
and I believe you will impede the administration of
the criminal law, and not assist it, if you leave that
provision in the bill. These are the principal points
to -which I wish to call attention at this stage. I
notice that a point which was mentioned in the Con-
vention, namely, that the federal government should
have some power of controlling the railways of the
states, so as to prevent a war of railway tariffs, has
not been dealt with at all in the bill. It is a point
that deserves attention, because if we are to have
perfect freedom of trade between the different pro-
vinces it will be important to enable the federal
government
Mr. Deakin : It is in the bill. It comes under
the general powers, chapter i, clause 52 !
Sir John Downee : Look at clause 12, page 18 !
Mr, WEIXOX: If it is intended to cover that by
the regulation of trade and commerce among the
several states, a question might arise as to whether
it is really covered by that provision.
Mr. Deakin : Then there is the other clause re-
ferred to by the hon. member, Sir John Downer—
page 18, clause 12 !
Mr. WEIXON: lam glad that the question has
been considered, because it is undoubtedly an im-
portant point if we are going to have free-trade
between the states. The language does not seem to
me to be as precise and definite as could be wished,
and it may be a matter for consideration in Com-
mittee whether we should not more definitely point
to the question of controlling railway freights. So
long as we are satisfied that the matter is dealt with,
it will meet the views of the Convention generally.
Mr. Adye Douglas : That was not taken into con-
sideration by the committee !
Mr. WEIXOX; Several members of the com-
mittee seem to consider that it was, and certainly
those clauses to which my attention has been drawn
may possibly meet the case. They do not meet it
expressly, but they may cover it. As long as it is
intended to cover it, that is the important point. It
is a mere matter of verbiage how we do it. There is
another point I wish to refer to. Ido not gather
from the bill that the federal government will have
sufficient control over the revision of the electoral rolls
for its own electorate. There are clauses which give
it power with regard to the conduct of the elections,
but I think the federal government should also have
the power of controlling and revising the electoral
rolls, so as to be able to ensure the purity of the rolls
by which the members of the federal parliament will
be returned. It is a matter which I hope will engage
our attention in Committee. There is only one other
point which I will mention —it is perhaps more a
matter of verbiage than anything else —that is, the
clause which provides that a convicted criminal shall
not be entitled to sit in the new parliament until he
is discharged or pardoned. That is rather an un-
happy clause. It is not a cardinal principle of the
bill; but it is an unhappy provision, and I should be
glad to see it omitted altogether. These are the
chief points to which I will direct the attention of
the Convention. I feel that at this stage the more
■we compress our observations the better it will be,
so as to bring the bill as soon as possible into Com-
mittee, so that we may press it forward there with
all reasonable speed. The subject is a great and a
vast one; it is too great to allow of any small, petty,
or provincial feeling intervening to cause delay or
prevent our united wish that we may be able to make
this bill as perfect as possible, so as to command
the assent of the provinces and the assent of the
people of the whole of this community. I think all
our efforts will be directed to that end, and I hope
the views I have suggested will have consideration,
so as to avoid the necessity of making amendments
when we actually get into Committee.
Mr. B AKEE: I understand that it is the wish of
hon. members, and I am sure it is my own wish, that
this debate should be as short as possible. There-
fore I am not going to address any remarks to any
subject which I myself do not believe is of the
utmost importance. I agree with a great deal that
has fallen from the hon. member, Mr. Wrixon ; but
I do not intend to follow his example by criticising
the whole of the bill, because I think it will shorten
my remarks and meet the wishes of hon. members if
I do not adduce any arguments which may be better
adduced on matters of detail in Committee. There
is only one point to which I will address my remarks
—that is, our old friend, the question of state rights
and state interests.
Mr. Munuo : Our old friend? Old trouble!
Mr. BAKEE: It may be our old enemy, but I
look upon it as an old friend. We are sent here to
form a federal government, and with all deference
and humility, it seems to me that the bill which we
are now discussing is not a bill to form a federal
government. The quintessence of federation is left
out, for this reason : that so far as the states them-
selves through their representatives are concerned,
they will have no voice in matters of federal legis-
lation. It is quite true that equal representation is
afforded to the smaller states in the senate. But
what is the good of equal representation in one
branch of the legislature if you deprive that branch
of the legislature of all its powers ? I quite agree
with the President iu his disapprobation of paper
constitutions. I hold that experience, wherever we
can get it, is a far safer guide than theory, and we
cannot in all federal questions obtain experience
except from one or two countries. But we have in
America a people practically of our own race, speaking
our own language, brought up under the same circum-
stances as ourselves so far as political institutions are
concerned, and w r e should be wanting in wisdom if we
were to refrain from learning lessons from the ex-
perience -which they have gained. I would first of
all point out that according to the experience of
America the federal constitution, although it is re-
duced to writing, yet is an exceeding plastic docu-
ment—that although the form may remain, the sub-
stance is entirely changed by the mighty force of
human nature acting on political institutions. I
crave leave of the Convention to give one or two
quotations from two celebrated American writers in
support of that proposition. Mr. Woodrow Wilson,
whose name is very well know r n to all the members of
the Convention, tells us that
there has been a constant growth of legislative and adminis-
trative practice, and a steady accretion of precedent in the
management of federal affairs, which have broadened the
sphere and altered the functions of the Government without
perceptibly affecting the vocabulary of our constitutional
language. Ours is, scarcely less than the British, a living and
fecund system.
He tells us further on that
the central government is constantly becoming stronger and
more active, and Congress is establishing itself as the one
sovereign authority in that government. In constitutional
theory and in the broader features of past practice ours has
been what A 1 r. Bagehot has called a composite government.
Besides state and federal authorities to dispute as to sove-
reignty there have been within the federal system itself rival
and irreconcilable powers. But gradually the strong are over-
coming the weak. If the signs of the times are to be credited
we are fast approaching an adjustment of sovereignty quite as
simple as need be. Congress is not only to retain the authority
it already possesses, but is to be brought again and again face
to face with still greater demands upon its energy, its wisdom,
and its conscience—is to have ever-widening duties and
responsibilities thrust upon it, without being granted a
moment’s opportunity to look back from the plough to which
it has set its hands.
And Mr. Clason, in a book called the “ Seven
Conventions,” a history of seven of the most cele-
brated conventions in the United States, says :
Within less than a century the Constitution has become
exactly what they who framed it and they who accepted it


neither understood it to be nor meant it to be—a government
of numbers by numbers for numbers, instead of government
by states for states.
Now, if these forces of human nature, to which I
have referred, have had that effect in America, where
the Senate, wEich was supposed to represent the
states, has had not only all the power which the
most strenuous advocate of state rights in this Con-
vention wishes to give the senate here, but in addition
has the great power and privilege of being one of the
chief executive branches of the Government, has the
power of making war and declaring peace —if the
result has been in America that the central govern-
ment has become stronger and stronger ; if the
government has become more and more government
by numbers for numbers, and that the power of the
states, as states, has constantly .diminished in regard
to federal matters —what can we expect if we pass
this bill in its present form ? I cannot understand
those hon. members of this Convention who are so
exceedingly anxious to guard the rights of majorities.
Why, majorities will always look after themselves.
It is the rights of minorities that have to be con-
sidered. It has been stated that the best test of
liberty in any representative government is : Are the
rights of minorities properly guarded ? We need not
apply ourselves with any great assiduity to protect
the rights of the majority, because the majority
always will protect their own rights. It is absurd to
say that the minority is going to rule. As far as I
know, nobody in this Convention has ever set up the
claim which, it has been asserted in the newspapers,
has been made, that the minority shall rule the
majority. I, for one, would not think of uttering
such an absurdity. But it is a very different thing
to claim the right to command and enforce obedience,
and to claim the right to be consulted before a com-
mand is given. That is all we ask for—we who
advocate the rights of the smaller states—that is all
we have ever asked for. What I understand to be
the contention of hon. members who represent Yictoria
is this: that all the powers shall be concentrated in
one branch of the legislature.
Mr. Deakin : No !
Mr. BAKER: I think I shall show that that will
be the ultimate result, that all powers shall be con-
centrated in one branch of the legislature, in which
the majority, and the majority only, shall rule.
What they claim is this; not government for the
people by the people, but government by the people
of Yictoria and New South Wales for Yictoria and
New South Wales and all the rest of the colonies.
That is what it comes to. If all the power is con-
centrated in one branch of the legislature, in wdiich
branch those two colonies, with their large popula-
tions, have a preponderant voice, that is what it
comes to—government by the people of Yictoria and
New South Wales, not only for themselves, but also
for the other colonies. A great deal has been said
in the Convention and outside about these two great
colonies not giving up their rights of self-govern-
ment, the privileges for which they have struggled
so long. I entirely agree with those sentfments ;
but are not the rights and privileges of the 350,000
people of South Australia as dear to them as the
rights of the 1,250,000 people of New South Wales
are to them ?
Colonel Smith : Their interests are identical!
Mr. BAKER: The hon. member says that their
interests are identical. How does he know? If
their interests are identical at the present moment,
how can he tell wEether in twenty or thirty years’
time. they will be so or not ? It seems to me that
the plasticity of this constitution which we are asked
to adopt will be manifested in a very short time, and
that there are four causes which will operate to make
the senate a mere dummy. Eirst of all, there is the
right of the initiation of money bills —and, as Mr.
Wrixon says, finance is government and government
is finance—and is it not an immense power to give
to one house over the other that all financial mea-
sures shall be initiated in that house ? And, in the
next place, there is the refusal to allow the other
branch of the legislature the alteration of money
bills. That of itself is an immense power. Then
when we come to the third point, that we are to
have responsible government, the executive to be a
committee of one house, what will become of the
senate ? Will the senate have any power?
An Hois'. Member :
Mr. BAKER! This bill does not say so. The
hon. member, Mr, Munro, will admit that if we have
a responsible form of government, which means that
the executive shall obtain and hold the confidence of
one branch of the legislature, and of only one branch,
that that branch will undoubtedly be the lower
house, for this reason, if for no other, that that
house has the control of the finances. If that is the
constitution of the senate, what chance is there that
men of character and position, to whom the Presi-
dent has referred, will seek to become members of
the senate ? Will not all the most experienced, all
the most energetic men, all the most able men be-
come members of that house which has the power
concentrated in it ? Is it likely that a man who has
spent his life in directing the fortunes of the country,
in controlling, perhaps a turbulent legislature, will
seek elevation to the senate, where there is really
nothing to do except to register the decrees of the
lower branch of the legislature ? It seems to mo
that these four forces will actually make the senate
perhaps even less powerful than some of the upper
houses at the present time, and that is the reason
why I say that the quintessence of federation is left
out of the bill.
Mr. Gounod : It has a bias against federation !
Mr. BAKER: I understand that one of the great
reasons wdiich actuate the minds of the members of
this Convention who desire to unduly, it seems to me,
curtail the powers of the senate, is the fear of a dead-
lock. They say, “ What is the ultimate solution in
case the two branches of the legislature disagree ?”
Well, we know perfectly well that unless there is an
absolute autocracy all forms of government are liable
to deadlocks. The chance of deadlocks is the price
we pay for our liberties ; but how can anybody who
has had experience in government in these colonies,
where it is possible for a deadlock to occur any day,
not only because of a conflict between the two houses
of parliament; but even if the executive, the govern-
nor, or any other body exercise all the constitutional
powers which are legally theirs, be afraid of a dead-
lock P We know very well that a deadlock is only
obviated by the discretion of those who administer
the government, and what right have we to suppose
that there will be less discretion in both branches of
the federal legislation than in our local parliaments ?
I would again ask to be allowed to give the result of
experience in America in reference to this question
of deadlocks. We know that no deadlock has occur-
red in America for 100 years, although the Senate
there is the most powerful house, and although it has
co-equal powers in every respect, except in the initia-
tion of bills for taxation, with the lower house, and
the reason for this is given by American waiters.
Mr. Woodrow Wilson, after making some prelimin-
ary remarks upon ihe subject, says :
But there is safety and ease in the fact that the Senate
never wishes to carry its resistance to the House to that
point at which resistance must stay all progress in legislation ;
because there is really a “latent unity” between the Senate
and the House which makes continued antagonism between
them next to impossible —certainly in the highest degree
improbable. The Senate and the House are of different
origin ; but virtually of the same nature. The Senate is less
democratic than the House, and, consequently, less sensible
to transient phases of public opinion ; but it is no less sensible
than the House of its ultimate accountability to the people,
and is, consequently quite as obedient to the more permanent


and imperative judgments of the public mind. It cannot be
carried so quickly by every new sentiment; but it can be
carried quickly enough. * There is a main chance at election
time for it as well as for the House to think about.
It is put in another way by Mr. Bryce, where he
gays that the two branches of the legislature in
America are both servants of the same master,
whose will they must ultimately obey, and that that
master is the sovereign people of America. And the
master of both the houses of this commonwealth, if
federation is brought about, will be the people of
Australia. I do not care in what way you frame the
constitution, the people of Australia will mould
and modify it in accordance with their ideas and
sentiments for the moment, although its outward
form may remain the same. I will not detain
the Convention any longer, but I must say that
I am exceedingly doubtful whether, if this bill
is passed in its present form, with such a weak,
impotent senate, the smaller states of Australia can
safely join the confederation. I would call the
attention of hon. members to the wording of clause
51—I do not know whether it is intentional or not—
on this very same question ;
Laws appropriating any part of the public revenue, or
imposing any tax or impost, shall originate in the house of
representatives.
That means nearly every bill that is introduced.
Almost every bill introduced either appropriates part
of the public revenue or imposes a tax or impost. I
know that in South Australia, where w T e have the
same w-ords as these in our constitution, all the im-
portant bills, and four-fifths of all the bills, come
under this category. It is quite true that in the
next clause bills imposing a tax or impost are de-
fined ; but bills appropriating part of the public
revenue are not defined. I do not know whether it
was the intention to convey the same idea in both of
these clauses ; but it seems to me that they contra-
dict one another. Clause 55 says ;
The senate shall have equal power with the house of repre-
sentatives in respect of all proposed laws, except laws impos-
ing taxation and laws appropriating the necessary supplies for
the ordinary annual services of the government.
That is quite contradictory to clause 54.
Mr. Bakton : No : it must be read subject to clause
54!
Mr. BAKER: If that is the intention, why not
put it more clearly, and strike out, in clause 54, the
words “ any part of the public revenue,” and insert
“ the necessary supplies for the ordinary annual
services of the government ?” There seems to me to
be an inconsistency between the clauses, and this
accentuates the point which I wish to make as to the
exceedingly limited powders given to the senate—
powers which, in my opinion, make it incompetent to
perform the duties of a federal senate, and to protect
the interests of the states w r hich ought to be confided
to its care.
Mr. CLARK: There seems a disposition on the
part of some members of the Convention to get into
Committee as soon as possible. I have no wish what-
ever to take up the time of the Convention: but it has
been thought by some members of the Constitutional
Committee that at least one member of it ought to de-
fend the bill against some of the attacks which have been
made upon it by the two speakers who have addressed
the Convention this morning. I had no wish what-
ever to take this particular task upon myself, and I
very much regret that the chairman of the Constitu-
tional Committee, Sir Samuel Griffith, w r as absent
during the whole of the time that the hon. member,
Mr. Wrixon, addressed the House; but, in his absence,
I took a number of notes of Mr. Wrixon’s speech.
I concur wdth the hon. member, Mr. Wrixon, that it
very often saves time in Committee to ventilate some
matters of detail in general debate, so as not to spring
amendments or objections upon hon. members in
Committee. I listened wdth very great pleasure to
the careful and intelligent criticism of the bill by the
hon. member, Mr. Wrixon; and I think I may say
for every member of the Constitutional Committee
that ive shall each and all be only too happy to listen
to any number of speeches of the same kind as his,
showing such a careful study of the bill, such an in-
telligent appreciation of its provisions, and containing
so many suggestions for our consideration with re-
gard to the possible improvement of the measure as
it did. But I think that my hon. friend, Mr. Wrixon,
misconceived the purport and effect of some of the
clauses to which he referred. He devoted his atten-
tion particularly to chapter A', Avhich deals Avith the
states, and he seemed to think that the whole of that
chapter Avas out of place because it did not deal Avith
the question of federal government at all, but Avas an
attempt to interfere with the internal affairs of each
state. But I Avould like to put before the hon. mem-
ber and before this Com r ention what appears to me
to be a very important consideration Avith regard to
this bill, and with regard to the future federation
Avhich we hope will arise under it, and that is, that
every resident of the commonwealth of Australia,
after this bill becomes IaAV, will be a citizen of two
distinct governments, and he has a right to look to
each of those governments for the protection of
certain fundamental rights and privileges ; and this
chapter dealing Avith the states only attempts to
interfere Avith the action of the states in so far as the
federal government thinks it right to do so for the
protection of its individual citizens. I think it hon.
members will read through all the provisions which
appear to interfere with state action, or which do
deliberately prohibit such action in certain subjects,
they will see that it is for the protection of certain
fundamental rights and liberties Avhich every indi-
vidual citizen is entitled to claim that the federal
government shall take under its protection and
secure to him. So much for chapter Yas a, Avhole.
Coming to the clauses in particular which the hon.
member, Mr. Wrixon, criticised, I will refer first of
all to the clause Avhich says that the states shall
adopt what mode they like for the appointment of
their governors. It appeared to me that the hon.
gentlemen had come to the conclusion that this
clause had directly invited the different states to
adopt the system of popular election for their
governors ; but I think no such reading as that can
be given to the language used. It simply leaves the
states to decide for themselves in what manner their
governors shall be appointed. We know that each
and all of them can now obtain an amendment of their
constitution from the Imperial Parliament, enabling
them to alter the mode of appointing their governors,
and this clause simply says that, without having to
go to the Imperial Parliament, they shall have that
right secured to them from the date of federation.
It does not follow that they will go in for the
popular election of their governors at all. In all
probability most of them Avill continue for a long
time to come to have their governors appointed as at
present; and so far from being in any way an inter-
ference with the right of the people to say in Avhat
mode their governors shall be appointed, this clause
leaves them absolutely free to do as they like.
Mr. Cutiibert : What necessity is there for it ?
It is only a saving clause!
Mr. Deakin : Do not argue it now!
Mr. CLARK : I am only replying to the criticism
of the hon. member, Mr. Wrixon, who seemed to
think that this clause was a direct invitation to the
people to adopt the system of popular election. The
next clause to which the hon. gentleman objected
was that which provides that references to the Queen
shall go through the governor-general. I think Ave
are all agreed that the object of federation is to
make us one nation or one community Avith regard
to the outside world; and if we are to be one nation
and one community with regard to the outside world,


we surely ought to have only one channel o£ com-
munication with the outside world. That is the sole
object of that clause. It has no intention whatever
of interfering with the executive government in the
several colonies, or to give the governor-general or
his ministers any power whatever to interfere with
the executive affairs in the several colonies. If hon.
members believe, and can show, that this method of
communicating with the Queen will cause irritation
and produce unforeseen results of a disadvantageous
nature, I am sure every member of the committee
will only be too happy to hear criticisms of that
kind, and, possibly, on reflection, to alter their
opinions with regard to the utility or necessity of
this provision, On one subject to which the hon.
delegate from Victoria referred I am entirely in
accord with him. I refer to the clause authorising
the federal parliament to confer original juris-
diction on the supreme court in additional cases.
Of course it is well understood that every member
of the committee reserved to himself the right
in Convention to differ from any of the details of
the bill. It is not to be expected that fourteen
members would be absolutely unanimous on every
point. Therefore I do not think I am guilty of
any breach of decorum when I say that personally
in the Judiciary Committee and in the Constitutional
Committee I strenuously fought against this pro-
vision ; but I was outvoted. I shall, therefore, be
happy to join the hon. member, Mr. AVrixon, in
attempting to get the clause excised. Then my hon.
friend approached what is perhaps the knottiest and
most difficult question in the whole bill, and that is
the relations of the senate and the house of repre-
sentatives with regard to money bills and the ques-
tion of finality with regard to legislation in general.
I thought that the Convention had substantially
adopted the compromise which is now embodied in
the bill.
Mr. AVrixon: Oh, no !
Mr. CLARK: But if I am wrong in that im-
pression, of course I must only wait to hear what
other objections can be urged against it when the bill
gets into Committee. I will not attempt to discuss
the question now. But I will say with regard to the
question of finality that if there is to be any system
proposed by which finality shall be arrived at in all
matters of legislation, so that the senate may bo
ultimately outvoted ,on any matter whatever, then it
certainly ought to be put on a perfect equality with
the other house with regard to money bills, so far as
the right of amendment is concerned. It is, there-
fore, a choice whether you will accept this compromise
with regard to amendments, or give the senate
absolute power of amendment, and provide some
system of obtaining finality on any matter, whether
it is a money bill or not. The reference which the
hon. member, Mr. AVrixon, made to the use of the
word u laAv” instead of “bill” I believe is perfectly
correct in regard to the use of the word in several
cases. I believe it has been a mere slip on the part
of the draftsman.
Sir Samuel Griffith ; No !
Mr. CLARK: In clause 57 it is evidently a slip,
.because a measure is a bill when it is presented to
the governor-general; it is only a law after it has
been assented to.
Sir Samuel Griffith ; The word may be wrong,
but it was used deliberately!
Mr. CLARK; One of the most important points
touched upon by the hon. delegate from Victoria
was the question of constitutional government. He
seemed to think that the clause providing for the
appointment of officers in charge of the various
departments of the state did not provide for con-
stitutional government as we understand it, with the
very large and necessary powers which a minister of
the Crown always possesses in a British community
having responsible government. I interjected at the
time that I thought the hon. member had overlooked
the last line of clause 4, chapter n, which says that
such officers shall be members of the federal executive
council; and I think the hon. gentleman will find,
upon reflection, that the words that I have quoted
constitute those officers what Ave ordinarily call min-
isters of the Crown, and that, being ministers of the
CroAvn, they will have all the poAvers which the
officers called ministers of the Crown at the present
time in the constitutions of the several colonies by
laAv possess. AVith regard to appeal to the Privy
Council, I understand that the only objection the
hon. member takes to the clause dealing with that
question is that it attempts to set out the interpre-
tation Avhich the Privy Council has already put
upon the language contained in the British North
American Act reserving the right of appeal to her
Majesty-in-Council. If it is simply a question as to
whether we should use the language of the British
North American Act, which was at onetime doubtful,
and a subject of great argument, but which has now
been interpreted, or whether we should use the very
language used by the interpreting authority, I do
not think there ought to be much hesitation in
choosing the direct interpretation, given by the con-
stituted authority of that Avhich before was doubtful
and arguable. That is our justification for adopting
that method, instead of repeating the language of
the British North American Act. On the question
of the control of the raihvay tariffs, I think we have
sufficient power to prevent Avhat are called differ-
ential rates, under the “ power to regulate commerce.”
At least avc knoAV that in America they have passed
an act called the Inter-State Commerce Act, in Avhich
they absolutely prohibit any railway company giving
better terms to any number of its constituents than
they give to others, or better terms to any localities
than they give to others. Now, if in America, where
the railways are all owned by private companies, the
Congress has power in its Constitution to pass a law
which says that no company shall give better terms
or advantages to some of its constituents than to
others, or to some localities than to others, Ave surely
can adopt the same method in preventing one colony
owning raihvays attempting to take traffic from
another b} r running at lovver rates for some people
than for others, or running at lower rates for goods
from some localities than from others,
Mr. AVrixon: A member of the committee stated
that it was not considered by the committee !
Mr. CLARK: Stated it was not considered by the
committee ?
Mr. Adte Douglas ; That point Avas not con-
sidered !
Mr. CLARK : I do not say that it Avas deliberately
considered. I only speak in so far as I am con-
cerned ; and I believe other members of the com-
mittee are convinced that under the poAA r er to regu-
late commerce we have the power to prevent any
colony attempting, by running at lower rates, to take
away traffic from another colony.
Sir John Brat : No !
Mr. CLARK: AVell, I believ T e we have.
Mr. Barton: Each colony has supreme power
within its OAvn boundaries !
Mr. Adye Douglas : That matter Avas never
discussed !
Mr. CLARK : I do not say that it wms ; but I say
that it is the opinion of several lawyers that we have
that power.
Mr. Adye Douglas ; It is not so in America.
The only provision there is this: they must not
charge more to one state than to another. They can
make any charges they like upon their particular
lines ; but they must not give a preference to one
state over another state.
Mr. CLARK : That is not a provision of the Inter-
State Commerce Act, as I will show the hon. gentle-
man Avhen the prope r time arrives. There is only one


other matter to which I will refer. One hon. mem-
ber seemed to think it was undesirable to allow an
appeal in criminal cases to the federal supreme court,
because he thought the execution of criminal law
ought to be speedy. There is no doubt that when a
man’s life is involved, it is a very unsatisfactory
state of things to have his fate suspended for any
length of time. That is one objection, and that is
the great objection, to appeals in criminal cases to the
Privy Council. The hon. member, however, will see
at once that an appeal to a court in Australia will
not create the same lengthy delay as an appeal to the
Privy Council in England does, and beyond that, ap-
peals in criminal cases will not be always in regard
to cases in which capital punishment is concerned.
If the hon. member will look through the reports
of criminal cases in England, I think he will find that
the appeals in capital cases are very few indeed ; but
there are numerous appeals in cases of larceny,
forgery, embezzlement, and fraud ; and in those cases
where life is not involved a man may be kept in
prison until the point in dispute is settled. If it is
settled in his favour he is discharged; if it is not
settled in his favour he is left to complete his
sentence. Ido not think any very serious injury is
done to the individual in cases of that kind, compared
with the benefit to the whole community in obtaining
the best and most authoritative decision on the points
involved for the purposes of future practice. I said
at the outset that I had no wish whatever to trespass
upon the time of the Convention at this particular
juncture; but several members of the Constitution
Committee thought someone ought to take up some
of the points mentioned by the hon. member, Mr.
Wrixon. For that reason only I have trespassed on
the time of the Convention, and I will leave anything
further that may be suggested to me by hon. mem-
bers’ remarks for discussion in Committee.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Motion (by Mr. Suttoe) agreed to:
That the Chairman leave the chair, and that the Conven-
tion resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole to
consider the draft bill.
In Committee:
Clause 1. This act may be cited as “The Constitution of the
Commonwealth of Australia.”
Mr. MUNE-0 : I think that a very important
question arises here as to the title of the federated
colonies. I do not think that the committee suc-
ceeded in securing a happy title. It is a title with
which we are not familiar, and a title which histori-
cally raises rather serious questions—questions that
suggest a good deal of controversy in the minds of
many people. Without taking up the time of the
Committee, I beg to move:
That the word ‘ ‘ Commonwealth” be omitted with a view
to insert in lieu thereof the words “ federated states.”
I think that that will answer our purpose very much
better, and will be more easily understood.
Sir John Downer : Say “ Federation ” !
Mr. MUNEO : “ Federated States” will properly
convey our meaning.
Sir John Downee : So will “ Federation !”
Mr. MUNEO : If you merely say “ Federation,”
that does not convey our meaning. Our meaning is
that we are to be federated states, and for that reason
I move this amendment. Before we go to lunch I
think we should have some understanding as to how
late we are to sit to-day. Some hon. delegates think
that we ought not to have an adjournment after
dinner, and if we are not to have an adjournment
after dinner, I think that we should sit at all events
until half-past 6. I merely mention this matter so
that we shall have an understanding not to run away
at half-past 5 or 6.
Mr. Deakin : Sit to-night!
Mr. MUNEO : If we sit until 6, we shall see
what progress we make.
Sir Samuel Gteipfith : There is no hon. member
in this Convention who is called home more urgently
than I am ; but notwithstanding that, and the great
hurry which I am in to get home, I think that a
great deal more harm will he done by rushing through
business as proposed by the hon. member, Mr.
Munro. I£ I had had this bill put in my hands yes-
terday afternoon, I should certainly not have been
prepared to rush through it either to-day or to-
morrow, or until next week. Some hon. members
may have quicker apprehension and be able to do
so ; but, considering the vast importance of the sub-
ject that we have in hand, I protest against anything
like undue haste. It is better to occupy two or three
more days about it, and get our work done well.
Sir Jons’ Downer : There has been too much haste
already.
Sir Samuel G-eiefitii : As the hon. member says,
there has been too much haste already. I feel that
the work done during the last fortnight has been
almost more than fairly could be done in that time,
and if every hon. member is to be asked to express
his final matured opinion either to-day or to-morrow
I fear that we shall make poor work of it.
Mr. Muneo : We do not want that!
Sir John Beat : I should like some understanding
as to what we are to do this evening. If the majority
of hon. members are prepared to go on, I think that
we should do so. I agree with those who suggest
that we should not hurry, but we should not lose
time. If hon. members are prepared to go on with
the discussion, I trust they will support the suggestion
of the hon. member, Mr. Munro, and go on as long
as hon. members are prepared to do so; but of course
not press any matter unduly to division. I at the
same time agree with the hon. and learned member,
Sir Samuel Griffith, that it is possible to make too
much haste, and I think that the Constitutional Com-
mittee made too much haste in rejecting the recom-
mendations of the Finance Committee as quickly as
they did. T trust that as long as hon. members are
prepared to carry on the discussion, without hastily
pressing for a division, hon. members will be willing,
even at some little inconvenience, to sit in the
evening.
Mr. G-illies : I do not know whether this is to be
considered a conclusive expression of opinion with
reference to the time we are to sit, or whether we
are to return to the subject after lunch.
An Hon. Member-: We can talk it over before
we meet this afternoon !
Mr. DEAKIN: The word proposed has, like every
other word that can be suggested, some disadvantages;
but in the opinion of a majority of the committee, it
possessed more advantages than any other name that
was suggested. In the first instance, it is a distinctly
English word, and a well-known word. It is a title
which has a pacific signification which, from the tone
that has been taken in regard to the defence pro-
posals in the measure, is an advantage. It indicates
that the state is formed for a pacific purpose —for the
common good of its people, for their common-weal.
It is a name which has not yet been applied. It is not
open to the objections which may be urged to such
combiuations as “federal states” or “ united states,”
titles which have already been employed in one part
of the world or another. It is an old word, but it is
a new name as applied to a state. There is no
existing state which is known as a commonwealth,
although Great Britain is frequently referred to both
by orators and political writers as a commonwealth ;
and the word has been already applied on occasions
when speaking of Australia as a whole. It is, there-
fore, a word which I fancy we are justified in
appropriating, and I trust that the Convention will
not lightly change a word which was adopted after
very full consideration by a majority of the com-
mittee, and that even those who may have some


sentiment against the name will take full time to
consider the objections that can be urged to any
other title.
Sir JOHN DOWNER: It is quite true that a
majority of the committee arrived at the conclusion
that it would be expedient to make this new departure,
and adopted a term which has not been usual in
countries under a sovereignty.
Mr. Deakin : Oh, yes, it is usual in countries under
sovereignty !
Sir J OHN DOWNER: Commonwealth is a very
nice word indeed, but it is very important to recol-
lect, as the hon. member, Sir Henry Parkes, pointed
out at a somewhat early stage of the proceedings,
that we have to consider, not only the technical
meaning of the law, but also the popular under-
standing of the law, and the popular understanding
of the word “ commonwealth ” is certainly connected
with republican times.
Mr, Deakin : No !
Sir JOHN DOWNER: It is, in my opinion,
connected with republican times, and it is certainly
disconnected with that loyalty which we all, I am
sure, not only profess, but very honestly feel towards
the Crown.
Mr. Deakin : The most glorious period of Eng-
land’s history !
Mr. Clark ; Hear, hear.
Dr, Cockbtjrn : Was it under the Crown ?
Mr. Deakin : There was then no Crown!
Sir JOHN DOWNER: It may have been the
most glorious period; but as my hon. friend, Mr.
Baker, says, it certainly was not the union under
the Crown, which we are all of us most desirous of
bringing about at the present time. Ido not think
that in the initiation of this matter w r e should mix
up two conflicting propositions—one that we are
thoroughly loyal, and the other that we are going to
adopt in our very initiation a title which is certainly
connected with ideas other than those which are
strictly loyal. Ido not much like the word which
has been proposed in the place of the "word “ com-
monwealth.”
Mr. Munro : I am quite willing to accept a better
one!
Sir JOHN DOWNER: When that is disposed of
I shall suggest that the name be Federal Australia.
Mr. PLAYFORD : In committee I was in favour
of the words “ United Australia,” and then of des-
cribing the parliament of the federation as the union
parliament, so that we might use the expression,
“ union parliament,” right through the bill. But the
word “commonwealth” was carried by a major-
ity, and I am fain to confess, along with the hon.
member, Sir Samuel Griffith, that the more I have
thought over the matter the more I like the word
“ commonwealth.” At first I was—well Ido not say
prejudiced against the word, but I did not care about
it very much, I believe that even if we get a majority
to strike out the word we shall have some difficulty in
getting a majority to substitute any other word. We
shall find in the first place that those who go for the
words “ Federal Australia ” will not be able to carry a
majority, and in the second place that those of us
who were originally in favour of the words “United
Australia ’ ’ will not be able to carry a majority. And we
may find that after all there will be a larger number of us
in favour of the word “ commonwealth ” than for the
substitution of any other word. My hon. friend, Sir
John Downer, has stated that we are not acquainted
with the word “ commonwealth ” in connection with
a monarchy. But if he will go back to English
history, before the time of the Commonwealth, he
will find that that great English poet, Shakspere, con-
stantly alluded to the state of things in England as a
commonwealth. We know very well that it is derived
from common-weal, which is described in the diction-
aries as the meaning of commonwealth.
Sir John Downer: It means differently now!
Mr. PLATFORD: No, it does not. Ogilvie, in
his dictionary, defines the word “ common-weal,” in
the first instance, to mean a commonwealth, and he
introduces this Shaksperian quotation. “So kind a
father of the common-weal.” The writer goes a little
further, and under the heading of “ commonwealth ”
he divides the word into two parts, and gives its prim-
ary meaning and its secondary meaning:
“Commonwealth” is derived from common and wealth,
meaning strictly common wellbeing or common good.
Surely we are all desirous of forming this constitu-
tion so that it shall redound to, the common good of
the people of this great continent.
Sir John Downer : It means common goods now !
Mr. PLAYFORD: The primary meaning of the
word is;
The whole body of people in a state
Surely that is a very good description of what we
mean when we are forming a federal Australia:
the body politic ; the public.
And another Shaksperian quotation is given:
You are a good member of the commonwealth.
So that if we go back to the time of Shakspere we
find that the word is distinctly understood to mean a
state under a monarchy. The secondary meaning of
the word is given as the commonwealth which was
established by Cromwell under the Protectorate,
Now, discarding altogether the secondary meaning of
the word, let us go back to the good old English
meaning of the word in the time of Shakspere.
When we are about to establish a union of these
Australian colonies let us, if we can, hit upon a new
name which shall unmistakably describe what we are
all aiming at, and that I contend is the common well-
being, the common good with regard to the whole
body of the people in a state, the common good of
the whole body politic. This word commonwealth
commends itself to my judgment as the very best
word that we can use, with regard to this union of
the various colonies of Australia. I shall unmistak-
ably support the retention of the word.
Sir GEORGE GREY: I ought, perhaps, to state
to the Convention that I believe I first proposed the
name of “ Federal Australia,” and I thought it was
a good proposition; but when I heard argued out the
question whether the word “ commonwealth” should
not be used instead of the words I had proposed, and
which others thought should be adopted, I was con-
vinced that the word “commonwealth” would be the
better term, and I therefore voted for it. I think it
right to state that I have changed my mind. I now
have no donbt that the word “ commonwealth” is the
better word to use. We are, I take it, assisting to
create a commonwealth in terms of the strictest
loyalty, love, and veneration for the Queen, who is
absolutely made a member of our parliament. It
being quite clear that we seek to do no wrong to the
exalted individual who is made a member of our par-
liament, I think it is quite clear we ought not to be
frightened by a bugbear such as has been suggested
into an alteration of a resolution arrived at after long
consideration.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Like the hon. mem-
ber, Sir George Grey, and the hon. member, Mr.
Playford, I was one of those who did not like the
word “ commonwealth ” when it was first mentioned,
but I confess that I now think it a very good word
indeed. The result of the arguments used in the
committee was to satisfy me that it was better than
any of the other words suggested —better, indeed, than
any other possible word. I think the prediction of
the hon. member, Mr. Playford, will probably be veri-
fied, and that there may possibly be a majority of this
committee who, if the question were put now, would
probably reject the word “commonwealth;” but who,
on the other hand, might not be able to agree to any
word in substitution for it. Would it not, therefore,


be better if the hon. member, Mr. Munro, instead of
proposing the omission of the word, proposed to
insert before it some other word ? If we take the
different proposals one after the other, and if, as I
expect, they are all rejected, we shall probably
come unanimously to the conclusion that the word
“ commonwealth” is the proper word.
Sir John Downer : We must omit the word
before another word can be inserted !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Why?
Sir John Downer; Because it is the parliamen-
tary practice!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Surely parliamentary
practice is made for the convenience of discussion
and determination. Are we the slaves of parliamen-
tary practice ? I do not know of any reason why it
should not be proposed to insert instead of to omit.
If the result of the insertion of a word were to render
necessary the omission of other words these words
would be omitted. I believe there are about half a
dozen members of the Convention who would like to
have inserted the words “ federal states others,
again, like the word “ federation others like the
words “ United Australia;” and these would con-
sequently all combine in the rejection of the word
“ commonwealth.” The course I suggest would be
in strict accordance with parliamentary rule. It is
not the way in which amendments are generally
made, because it seldom happens that it makes any
difference which way it is done, although in this case
it does. I would remind hon. members of the
practical inconvenience that would result if we should
strike out the word “ commonwealth,” and should
subsequently be unable to agree to any other.
Sir John Downer : The hon member assumes
that that will be the case !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Surely any hon.
member is right in arguing upon the possible con-
sequences of any proposed action. I am assuming a
possibility. I assume that if this question were to
go to a division this afternoon there would very
likely be a majority against the word “commonwealth”
and I am equally positive that next Monday there
would be a majority in favour of it. In the mean-
time, 500 or 600 amendments would have been made
in the bill, which would have to be restored to its
original form—amusing work for some one.
Mr. WRIGHT : The hon. member, Mr, Deakin,
in speaking just now, said the word “ commonwealth”
had a special signification. I agree with the hon.
member; but I think it is anything but a savoury
signification, and that it is, therefore, altogether an
improper word to use. It appears to have been
assented to by many members of the committee for
aesthetic reasons rather than for any other.
Mr. Playford : The hon. member evidently believes
in the glorious memory of Charles I!
Mr. WRIGHT : And it is possible that there are
certain members who have in their mind’s eye a
future Oliver Cromwell, who would say. “Take away
that bauble,” meaning by the bauble the allegiance
we owe to Her Majesty the Queen and the United
Kingdom of Great Britain. I think the question
might be solved by striking out the word “ Common-
wealth,” and by merely leaving the words “ Constitu-
tion of Australia.” We are proud to consider our-
selves by birth or by adoption citizens of this great
country, and I therefore think my suggestion would
meet the views of a majority of members of the Con-
vention.
Mr. BARTON: I do not know that there is much
necessity for me to address the Committee, because
I am satisfied with all that the hon. member, Mr.
Playford, has said. But I rise chiefly for the purpose
of referring to the suggestion of the hon. member,
Mr. Wright, that the title “ Commonwealth ” has an
unsavoury signification. How that can be I do not
know. If we arc to be frightened away from the use
of any proper word, or the expression of any proper
idea from the fact that it has been usurped or per-
haps misused by others who have gone before us, we
shall be deterred from doing a great deal we ought to
do. If there are those who think that, under the great
Protector —whose name, as we live longer to under-
stand history, will always be more venerated among
English-speaking people —the process of republican-
ism as associated with the title given to the English
body politic under him was inimical to the common-
weal, and who think that on that account we ought
to depart from the title, I would remind them that it
was a name inherent in the minds of Englishmen long
before that time. If any hon. member thinks, how-
ever, that such a reason should be sufficient to pro-
hibit us from using a title which absolutely designates
all that we desire to designate, then as we go
through this bill I am afraid we shall find ourselves
rapidly denuding it of some of its best features.
There can be nothing unsavoury in a title which
means, according to the best authority, “ the nation,
state, realm, the commonwealth” —the word being
interposed between “realm” and “republic,” show-
ing that it is used to signify the common good, and
that it has that signification whether under a queen
or a republic. “ Nation, state, realm, commonwealth,
republic, commonweal, nationality.” The words used
by Roget as synonymous are among others “national ”
and “ public.” If these are the expressions asso-
ciated by the highest authorities with the word com-
monwealth, why seek better ? Shall we take con-
federation or federation ? I will not give all the
words which are stated as synonymous, because some
of them express almost too much ; but we find these,
“ league, alliance, coalition, confederacy, confedera-
tion.” These are not altogether what we wish to
express, because we know that although we have
embodied the operation of federal action in this
commonwealth, still we seek to constitute a national
government for national purposes. Our purposes of
government may be national Avhile we preserve the ut-
most loyalty to the monarch whom the constitution sets
over us. As the hon. member, Sir George Grey, has ex-
pressed it, we have constituted the Queen a member, and
the highest member, of our parliament. The association
of the Queen with the action of the commonwealth is
distinct, and is firmly embedded in the whole bill.
If that is done, there can be no association of the
idea of republicanism with this bill. However appro-
priate the name “ commonwealth ” may be to a
republic, it has been clearly shown from the quota-
tions made by the hon. member, Mr. Playford, from
Shakspere to be associated in the minds of English-
men with government for the public good —with
government for the people —and as it so expresses in
itself the very essence of government for the good
of the people, and because we cannot suggest any-
thing else which expresses the idea in one word, I
hope we shall retain this name, and I believe that if
we do, we shall all live to be proud of it,
Mr. J. FORREST: 1 objected in committee to
the use of this word, and I have seen no reason
Avhatever to change my opinion. The name is in-
appropriate for more than one reason. In the first
place, it designates too much. If we were founding
an independent nation, and not federating, it might
be a very appropriate term to call it “The Common-
wealth of Australia.” That, however, is not the
case. We are a number of independent sovereign
states desirous of being federated, and avc desire
to have a name which will signify exactly what we
are doing. On the face of it, Ido not think it
can be said that “ The Commonwealth of Australia ”
Avould signify that a number of states had joined
together in a federal union. In my opinion a
much better term Avould be “ the Federated States
of Australia,” which exactly signifies AAdiat avc mean.
That might be regarded as too long, and Ave
might say, “Federal Australia.” Another reason
why this name should not be adopted is, that


in the minds of many people the -word “ com-
monwealth ” is associated with a period of English
history which was not very glorious. There is con-
siderable divergence of opinion as to the good
conferred on England by the Commonwealth. No
doubt many historians believe that it was a very
glorious one, but no one will deny that others hold
an opposite opinion. If possible, we should adopt
something new, and not follow a name which would
give rise to unfavourable opinions such as the term
“ commonwealth ” would certainly give rise to. The
term “ federated states ” would show exactly what we
intend, and if it is desired to shorten the name,
“Federal Australia” would serve the purpose very
well.
Mr. MARMION: It seems rather strange, after
sitting here for a considerable period, that this
assembly should, for the first time, now hear of this
term “ commonwealth.” As a member coming from
a remote portion of Australia, I have been sitting
here many days anxiously and patiently listening to
the words of wisdom from hon. gentlemen, but never
on any occasion did I hear the term “ commonwealth ”
mentioned. After the select committee sat for a
considerable time, and after we had waited patiently
for their report, we were surprised very much to find
that a new term had been imported to denominate
what shall hereafter be the great nation of united
Australia.
Mr. Baeton : It was proposed at a very early
stage in the committee !
Mr. MARMION : I do not allude to the com-
mittee, but to the distinguised assembly which
appointed the committee. One would imagine that
the select committee would act in the manner which
is usual when a deliberative body is selected by a
greater body. In this particular case it seems
curious that the word “ commonwealth ” was chosen.
I can see no reason why we should try to originate
a newfangled idea with reference to the de-
nomination of the new federated Australia that
we are seeking to form. "Why should not the word
“ Australia ” be used in its pure and natural sim-
plicity ? We are all either native-born Australians
or we have chosen Australia as the land of our
adoption, and when we visit other lands we speak of
Australia as our home. Why should we not speak
of this as the constitution of Australia, which would
explain itself not only to Australians, but in all its
purity and simplicity would explain itself to people
who live in the outside world? If a man living in
Europe, Asia, or America, intended to come here,
what necessity should there be for him to say that
he was about to visit the commonwealth of Australia ?
Why should he not say, “ I am going to visit Aus-
tralia?” In the case of America there was a good
reason for using the words “ United States,” because
America forms one great continuous continent, both
North and South, and divided into a great number of
various countries. Such is not the case in Australia.
We are an island, united to a very great extent, and
we hope to be united to a still greater extent under
a federal dominion or nation. Then why should there
be any reason for the use of this word ? It is super-
fluous and unnecessary. Although many hon. gentle-
men may think that the commonwealth was associated
with a glorious period of the history of Great Britain,
yet there are a great number of people living in Aus-
tralia and outside of it who do not consider that it
was a brilliant period in English history. I say it is
our duty here as statesmen, supposed to represent
the intelligence, rising genius, and talents of this
young country, to beware of those old associations
and ideas which may cause discord in the minds of
those who are endeavouring to form this great
nation. I should be sorry to see this word
chosen, and I trust that it will not be chosen, no
matter how euphonious it may be, no matter how
beautiful its meaning may seem in the various
dictionaries which hon. members have been quoting.
I trust that we shall choose a name that will be
simple and easily understood —something that can
be regarded with confidence by Australians and the
world, and recommend the adoption for its simplicity
of the “ Constitution of Australia.” It may be said
that there is some objection, because Ave have two
other colonies which are likely to join the fede-
ration, one called Western Australia, and the other
South Australia; but that is really no great objec-
tion. Canada has two divisions, Upper and Lower
Canada; but no one speaks of coming from or going
to Upper or Lower Canada. It does not matter what
part they belonged to, they speak of going to or
coming from Canada. A person who has been born
in any Canadian state speaks of himself as having
been born in Canada. It will be the same with
Australia. A man will speak of coming from Aus-
tralia, not from the commonwealth.
Mr. Platfoed : What about the “ Dominion ” of
Canada.
Mr. MARMION: You meet with that name when
reading a work which goes into the history of the
country; you do not hear of it in common parlance.
Sir Samuel Geiffitii : We are not writing a geo-
graphy now!
Mr. MARMION: No, nor have I any notion that
I could convey any knowledge to the hon. member’s
mind. lam not so foolish as to imagine that the
Avords I use will have much effect upon those Avho
are listening to me. Whether they will have any
effect or not, I feel sure that if the Avord is adopted
the day Avill come when hon. members will recognise
that Avhat I have said Avas not all folly, but that
there Avas some Avisdom in it.

Question so resolved in the affirmative.
Clause, as read, agreed to.
Clause 2. The provisions of this act referring to her
Majesty the Queen extend also to the heirs and successors of
her Majesty, kings and queens of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland.
Mr. RUTLEDGE : It strikes me that this clause
is capable of some amendment. Ido not know that
it is, strictly speaking, grammatically correct. I
think that the more correct phraseology to express
the meaning of the Committee would be that used in
some of our oavu local acts. I therefore propose :
That the words “ kings and queens ” he omitted with a view
to the insertion in lieu thereof of the words “in the
sovereignty.”
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: There is no objection
that I can see to the amendment. It is rather an
improvement in sound, though it uses a Avord of four
syllables instead of monosyllables.


Amendment agreed to; clause, as amended, agreed
to.
Clause 3 (Power to proclaim Commonwealth of Australia).
Mr. RUTLEDGE: Having in view the provisions
of the bill, which refer to the time of the establish-
ment of the commonwealth, I think that the words
“and establish” should be inserted after the word
“ united,” at the end of the clause. Such an amend-
ment would make the clause clearer.
Sir John Downer : No. The colonies are united;
the constitution is established !
Clause agreed to.
Clause 6. The Federal Council of Australasia Act, 1885, is
hereby repealed, but such repeal shall not affect any laws
passed by the Federal Council of Australasia and in force at
the date of the establishment of the constitution of the com-
monwealth.
But any such law may be repealed as to any state by the
parliament of the commonwealth, and may be repealed as to
any colony, not being a state, by the parliament thereof.
Sir JOHN DOAVNER; I fancy that this clause
needs a slight amendment. It provides for the re-
peal of the Federal Council of Australasia Act, but
such repeal is not to affect any laws passed by the
Federal Council and in force at the date of the es-
tablishment of the constitution of the commonwealth.
But any such law may be repealed as to any state by the
parliament of the commonwealth.
Should it not be that the law may be repealed alto-
gether ? As the clause stands the federal parliament
will be able to repeal a law as to a particular state,
but not in toto. I would just raise the question by
moving:
That in line 2, after the word “ repealed,” the words “ or
may be repealed ” be inserted.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Does not my hon.
friend see that the amendment which he proposes is
not correct ? Of the colonies constituting the
Federal Council some may come into the federation,
but some may not, and the parliament of the com-
monwealth ought to have no power to repeal the
laws of the council affecting those states which do
not come into the federation. I take the cases
of Western Australia and Queensland, which have
fishery laws passed by the Federal Council. If either
of those colonies do not come into the federation,
why should the federal parliament have the power to
repeal their laws ? These laws may, however, be
repealed in any state which is part of the common-
wealth.
Sir J ohn Downer : I agree with the hon. member,
and will withdraw my amendment!
Mr. Marmion : Should not the repeal be made on
the application of the state affected ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: No; because all the
matters that could be dealt with by the Federal
Council can be dealt with by the federal parliament,
Mr. BROWN: I should like to ask the hon.
member, Sir Samuel Griffith, what would be the effect
of this clause with regard to the repeal of the Federal
Council Act during the period that will intervene
between the time at which this bill is passed, and the
time at which, under clause 3, it will come into
operation p There will be a period intervening during
which certain acts passed by the Federal Council, as,
for instance, the Fisheries Act of AYestern Australia,
will be repealed by this bill.
Sir Samuel Griffith : If the hon, member will
read the first part of the clause he will see that this
does not repeal anything !
Mr. BROWN: I see my mistake.
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
Clause agreed to.
Clause 7. The constitution established by this act, and all
laws made by the parliament of the commonwealth, in pur-
suance of the powers conferred by the constitution, and all
treaties made by the commonwealth shall, according to their
tenor, be binding on the courts, judges, and people of every
state, and of every part of the commonwealth, anything in
the laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding; and
the laws and treaties of the commonwealth shall be in force
on board of all British ships whose last port of clearance or
port of destination is in the commonwealth.
Sir HARRY ATKINSON: This will be an act of
the British Parliament, and it may apply to British
ships that may never reach here. Suppose a ship
coming to Melbourne broke down at Gibraltar, any
legal questions arising in connection with her would
have to be dealt with by Australian courts, not by
British courts. By this clause the ship would be
part of the commonwealth.
Mr. Platford : No !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I agree that these
words appear rather startling. They are taken from
the Federal Council Act of Australasia, and were
inserted by the imperial authorities after considera-
tion and in substitution for more limited words that
were proposed by the Convention that met here in
1883. Finding those words there, and considering
that the powers of the federal parliament are only to
make laws for the peace, order, and good government
of the commonwealth, it was thought perfectly safe
to adopt them,
Mr. BAKER ; Do I understand that if a ship
leaves one of the Australian colonies for a British
port, say London, having a British register, until she
actually arrives in Great Britain, the laws of the
commonwealth are binding upon her, and not the
laws of Great Britain F
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: No ; but laws of the
commonwealth, limited to laws for the peace, order,
and good government of the commonwealth, will
apply to her on her voyage. For instance, if it was
necessary to send a prisoner to England, only such
provisions as are essential for the laws of the com-
monwealth outside the 3-mile limit could possibly
apply.
Mr. RUTLEDGE : I would point out that at the
end of the clause the word “whose ” appears to have
been omitted before the word “ port.”
Sir Samuel Griffith : I think that must have
been a mistake in the copying !
Amendment (by Mr. Rutledge) agreed to:
That the word “whose” be inserted before the word, “port,”
line 10.
Mr. BAKER: I may be rather dense, but still I
do not understand this clause. It says, “ The laws of
the commonwealth shall be in force.” That means, I
presume, all the laws. Therefore, if a ship leaves
London bound for any port in Australia all the laws
of the commonwealth will be in force on board that
ship until she reaches here. That is the effect accord-
ing to the wording of the clause, but it surely cannot
be the intention. It appears to me to be a rather
startling conclusion that a British ship leaving Lon-
don, presumably under the provisions of the British
Merchant Shipping Act, shall not be under the
British Merchant Shipping Act. At present, there
is no such thing as a colonial ship; they are all
British ships, and after they are outside the limit of
our jurisdiction at sea, the laws of Great Britain are
in force on board those ships. It is true that we have
power to try persons for crimes committed on board
the ships when they arrive in the colony ; but we have
that poiver by virtue of special acts of the Imperial
Parliament, and. the offenders have to be tried accord-
ing to the laws of Great Britain. As I understand
this clause, it seems to alter that state of things, and
to arrive at a very startling conclusion.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: The words of this
clause to which exception has been taken were framed
by the imperial law officers in 1885 in substitution for
words of a more limited application which we pro-
posed to have inserted. The question arose specially,
as far as my memory serves me, with regard to the
power to legislate in connection with fisheries and
territorial waters outside the jurisdiction andthe extra-
dition of offenders. The laws of the commonwealth


would only have effect within the land territory and
3 miles beyond. Of course parts of the common-
wealth are separated from one another by sea, and
the means of communication between different
parts is, and will continue for a long time to be, by
sea. It is absolutely necessary that these law's
should extend beyond the territorial limit, and we
asked for w'ords which w r e thought w'ould give effect
to that idea. The imperial law officers substituted
the words now adopted, which might possibly be
thought to convey more than w'as intended. But,
on consideration, Ido not think that is the case. I
do not see how any more limited words would give
w r hat wo want. Take the case of the fisheries. A
ship clears from an Australian port to the Torres
Straits fisheries. She goes to no port in particular
there. The laws are to be in force on board of her
all the time she is away and until she returns to her
port of clearance or destination. In the case put
by the hon. member, Mr. Baker, of a ship coming
from England
Mr. Baker ; And being wrecked at Malta!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: There are no laws
that are within the powers of the commonwealth to
pass that could apply to any person on board a ship
under those circumstances. If the hon. gentleman
will look at the words of limitation in the clause
conferring legislative powers on the commonwealth,
I think he will see that no laws in any of those pro-
visions could apply to a person on board a ship
under the circumstances mentioned.
Mr. Gordon : What about the Employers’ Lia-.
bility Act and the laws for the regulation of trade
and commerce ? Suppose you had a conflicting
employers’ liability act as between the common-
wealth and Great Britain ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: The Employers’
Liability Act is a matter affecting the rights of
property in a state. It never occurred to me that
such a thing would be within the powers of the
commonwealth.
Mr. Baker : There might be a question also as to
the law of marriage and divorce !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH; If the hon. gentle-
man will look at the bill he will see that the only
law's which can apply are law's for the peace, order,
and good government of the commonwealth.
Sir John Downer : “ According to their tenor! ”
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: As the hon. gentle-
man reminds me, the words, “according to their
tenor,” were inserted in this clause exactly for the
purpose of indicating that.
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
CHAPTER I. —THE LEGISLATURE.
Part I. General.
Clause 2. The Queen may, from time to time, appoint a
governor-general who shall be her Majesty’s representative in
the commonwealth, and who shall have and may exercise in
the commonwealth during her Majesty’s pleasure, and sub-
ject to the provisions of this constitution, such powei’s and
functions as her Majesty may deem necessary or expedient to
assign to him.
Dr. COCKBURN; I should like information from
the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, or some other
hon. member, as to the exact intention of this clause.
Of course w r e know that, by letters patent, certain
powers are at present delegated to the governors of
the several colonies irrespective of their ministers.
I think there is a feeling in the colonies generally,
and also I think in this Convention, that the powers
of those who hold the important office of ministers of
the commonw'ealth should be in no respect —if it is
possible to avoid it—inferior to the pow'ers of imperial
ministers. In such matters as the dissolution of par-
liament, and the inflicting of capital punishment, I
think the powers of the ministers of the common-
wealth should be absolute—that is to say, that instead
of these two matters of exercising the prerogative
of pardon and the power to dissolve parliament,
being vested solely in tbe governor, they should be
exercised by responsible ministers. I think it is
much better that questions of this kind —the disso-
lution of parliament or the infliction of capital
punishment—being strictly local questions, should
be decided by the local authorities. Unless sorae-
thing is put into writing, I imagine whatever the
Imperial Parliament may do in giving effect to this
legislation, that it will be competent at any time,
for imperial ministers, by letters patent, to continue
to vest in the governor-general those powers which
are at present exclusively vested in the governors of
local states. I would ask the hon. member, Sir
Samuel Griffith, or some other hon. member of the
committee, whether it is intended that the ministers
of the commonwealth should have no power in such
a matter, for instance, as the dissolution of parlia-
ment ?
Mr. Pdayford : The hon. member means the
dissolution of local parliaments !
Ur. COCKBURN: No; the dissolution of the
federal parliament.
Mr. Pdayford : That the governor should not
have power to say whether he will grant his ministers
a dissolution?
An Hon. Member : How about a refusal ?
Dr. COCKBURN: No case has ever been known
for many years—l think for many hundreds of years
—in which the Prime Minister of the Imperial Par-
liament has been refused a dissolution.
Mr. Playford : But the Queen has the power to
refuse it!
Dr. COCKBURN: If the governor-general by
letters patent is instructed to exercise that power,
he will do so. Unless something is definitely stated
on this point, I imagine the letters patent to the
governor-general will be in this particular no
different from the letters patent to the governors of
the different colonies; and I wish to ask the hon.
member, Sir Samuel Griffith, whether it is his inten-
tion, in connection with the commonwealth, with all
the prestige which it will have, that an important
matter such as the dissolution of parliament, which
is purely a local matter, should not be vested in those
ministers who are directly responsible on the spot to
the people of the colonies ?
Sir GEORGE GREY: lam afraid I shall lose
my chance of moving an amendment to this clause if
I do not do it at this stage. I move :
That the words “ The Queen may, from time to time,
appoint,” line 1, be omitted, with a view to the insertion
of the words, “ There shall be.”
The intention is that the governor may be elected.
I feel that in bringing this subject under the notice
of the Convention lam entering upon very delicate
and very debatable ground. But I feel that, in point
of fact, the future of vast multitudes of persons will
depend upon the manner in which this question is
dealt with. This is a question of the interests of
nearly 4,000,000 persons at the present moment who
look to us ; and it appears to me extremely inexpedient
that the power of appointing the governor-general to
rule so vast a confederacy should be left in the hands
of any minister of the day in Great Britain. The terms
used are “the Queen shall appoint;” but we all
know perfectly well that that means that the minister
for the time being shall appoint such person as he
pleases, whilst such appointment might be absolutely
obnoxious to her Majesty herself. The meaning of
the thing is that a friend or any other person chosen
by the minister may be appointed without the people
of this great confederacy being in any way consulted.
I understand that the reason usually alleged for that
by persons who support the appointment being
made by the Queen is that a social appointment is
to be made. That is the term usually applied—it is
a social question, and not a political question. I
contend that the question is twofold, and those two


things cannot be separated. The governor has
political functions to exercise and he has social
functions to exjsrcise, and in either case I hold
that a person so appointed is much less fitted to
exercise those functions than a governor-general
chosen by the people of the country would be. I
do not understand how it can be said that any social
ends whatever, or at all events, of any magnitude,
are attained by the appointment of the governor-
general by the Crown; but Ido hold that social ties
and social questions of the strongest possible kind
require that the governor-general should be elected
by the people of the confederacy. Take the case of
a widowed mother, herself well educated, perhaps
brought up as a teacher in one of your public
schools, and possessing great ability; imagine her
with her orphaned children, deprived of a father,
night after night teaching those children, with a hope
that the highest offices of the state of every kind
may be open to them all. Is not that a social ques-
tion —a social gathering of the highest and noblest
kind ? And hundreds, I may say thousands, of such
social gatherings would be witnessed every night in
this great commonwealth, if all the highest offices
of state were filled by election by the people. If
you follow it out, you will find that in all social
relations of the family—fathers, mothers, children,
brothers, sisters —this question is intimately con-
cerned as being something which binds the whole
family together for common objects, and opens paths
of distinction to every one of them, if they prove
themselves great and deserving men. Why should you
say to all these 4,000,000 of people, "No one of you,
nor any one of the other millions who are to occupy
this country, shall have the slightest chance of
ever attaining to an honor of that kind " —that it
shall always be open, as it certainly or almost cer-
tainly would be, to distant persons with no claim what-
ever upon the inhabitants of this country, all of whom
would be shut out from so great an opening as that
of which I speak. It is more materially necessary
that we should consider this point now, and that we
should come to a just decision upon it, because I will
show hereafter, as the discussion on the bill proceeds,
that in every instance all hope is shut out from the
great masses of the colony to succeed to any one of
the important posts which under this bill will be open
to the people of Australia. I say that, looking to our
duty to our Sovereign, we owe it to her to select the
worthiest man we know to represent her here —to be
certain that the man so chosen is worthy to represent
her; and in no other way than by his being chosen
by ourselves from people whom we know can we be
certain that the worthiest man will be chosen to re-
present the Queen within the limits of the great con-
federacy which we are about to constitute. Consider-
ing the openings that would be given to every inhabi-
tant of Australasia under such a system as I propose,
with so many families, as will necessarily do it, direct-
ing their every exertion and effort to raise up children
worthy of the great opportunities laid open to them,
I ask whether this is not to us a greater social ques-
tion than a few balls and dinners given at Govern-
ment House, at which none but those in the immedi-
ate vicinity can be present ? I ask what comparison
is there between these two things —one great and far-
reaching, extending to millions, the other a mere
sham, as it were, representing what passes in another
place, as if one were looking through the wrong end
of a telescope at some procession that was going on ?
All matters connected with Government House are
diminished here as compared with Great Britain
and the influence exercised there. There it is the
influence of an hereditary monarch descended from a
long line of ancestors. There it is the influence
belonging to certain professions—the army and navy
—who look to receiving honor from the hands of
such a sovereign. Here there are no ties whatever
of th?.t kind; and yet for a mere imaginary show, or
what is called the performance of social duties—•
entertaining strangers and also citizens immediately
surrounding the vice-regal court, which are the only
benefits that are absolutely gained—all those benefits
that I speak of are lost. Let us look at in another
way,which is also worthy of our consideration. What
is the necessary consequence of having a governor-
general of this kind, with an enormous salary, and
vast expenditure upon various subjects—a salary
more than adequate to the duties to be performed F
You will find set down in this bill a salary of
£IO,OOO a year.
The Vice-Chairmans' : I ask the hon. member not
to discuss that matter, as the question of salary is
dealt with in the next clause.
Sir GEORGE GRAY : I find a difficulty in separ-
ating the two questions. They may be separated in
clauses ; but the one argument will hardly carry the
full meaning of what it is necessary for me to say so
that the matter may be understood. 1 hardly see
how it is possible for me to divide the subject, because
if I admit that the governor-general should be ap-
pointed by the Crown, what is the use of my after-
wards arguing about the salary F If, whilst I am
arguing upon what must follow upon the appoint,
ment of governor-general, I cannot refer to the
salary, how can I make the matter thoroughly under-
stood F I w-ould submit, sir, that this is a case in
which clearly it is impossible to separate the two.
Mr. Evsii : Go on !
Sir GEORGE GREY : Well, I can allude gene-
rally to the subject of powers and functions. Limit-
ing myself, then, to the use of the term large salary,
may I say, without naming the exact amount, that
the President of the United States, until but lately,
received £6,000 a year for his salary for ruling
40.000. people, and at the present time I believe
his salary is £IO,OOO a year for ruling 60,000,000
people, and daily augmenting in number. Here we
are expected to pay at least as large a salary as is
paid to the President of the United States for ruling
60.000. people, and to pay a governor-general
nominated by the Crown. I ask is it just whilst so
many poor people have to be taxed to pay their share
of that salary, to deprive them of the honor, and, I
may say of the just pride, of themselves electing some
worthy man, known throughout so great an extent of
country as Australia, to occupy that honorable post,
with the certainty that such an example will operate
upon every individual of the community, stirring
noble faculties in many men, giving hope, perhaps,
to some thousand or more of the people that they
may possibly attain to such an honor? Is it right
to make the people pay such sums of money, and to
deprive them of honors to which they ought justly
and rightly to look F And when, as 1 shall prove by-
and-by, as we go on with the bill, each office is closed
by some restriction or other to all chance of fair
competition in the country, let us, at the very first,
indicate in this clause that this great office shall bo
open at all times to that man in Australia who is
deemed the greatest, and worthiest, and fittest to
hold so noble a post, and to satisfy his fellow-citizens
that they have wisely chosen one who will be an
honor to the whole community. Can any of us believe
that if at the time of the disturbances in the United
States in regard to slavery a man had to bechosenby the
British ministry of the day in London, there was the
slightest hope that such a man as Lincoln would have
come to thefront to achieve the great and noble objects
which he accomplished ? I am sure the universal
admission must be that there would have been no hope
of such a thing. Yet from the forests of the United
States there came one who had been a mere splitter
of timber, worthy justly and rightly to exercise the
highest power for a time in the United States and
to accomplish the great ends at which ho aimed.
Are we in Australia to bo told that we can find no
man worthy to succeed to a post of that kind ? Are


we to be told that we must forego the chance of
selecting a man of that sort, and that some thousands
a year must be expended unnecessarily, when the
money might be applied to great and good objects ?
And if it should be so expended will it be for the
benefit of the people ? No. I say it will be to their
detriment, by depriving them of such just objects
of ambition —objects just in themselves, and which
would soon be dear to the hearts of all. To my
mind, to subject the people of this new federation to
a rule of this kind is to degrade, and not to ennoble;
is to lower them in their own estimation, instead of
raising them in their own estimation ; is to say that
they are not worthy to compete with their fellow-
men in other parts of the world. As far as it rests
with myself, I know that I am venturing upon
dangerous ground. I know that I must raise enmity
in many minds by what I am doing.
Hon. Members : No!
Sir GEOEGE GEEY: But I feel it my duty to
run this risk in order to tell what I believe to be
impregnable truths, and to try to lead this Con-
vention to do that which I am confident will stamp
greatness upon every man who assists in obtaining
that benefit for his country. I believe that those
who force this clause into this bill, instead of not
having done good to Australia, will virtually have
conferred a great benefit upon the country by creating
a necessity for a discussion of this question. If, now
that the question has been raised, it is decided in
favour of the people of Australasia —if they are told
that this great boon is open to them; if this night
we send a thrill from one part of the country to the
other with the news that this great object has been
attained, I say it will have been for all those who
have aided in it one of the happiest days in their
lives, and that they will be benefactors to countless
generations yet to come in having obtained so great
and good an object for them. And further than that,
I say that to attain this object, to gain this principle
will be to ensure for a long period of time the love
of Australasia for England; to remove to a greater
distance all chances of separation between the two
countries, and to lead me, and I believe many others,
to rest assured that a step of the strongest kind has
been taken to strengthen the great union of Austral-
asia for yet centuries to come, instead of endangering
it, as I am certain will be the case, by blocking that
union with the disastrous admission that we must
take from Great Britain such governor-generals as
she may please to send out, and that none of the
citizens of this country may hope to obtain that great
and, shall I call it, magnificent office. Actuated by
these sentiments, I have felt it my duty to raise this
question, and I trust that I shall have some support,
if not a majority of the Convention, in favour of that
which I ask for.
Amendment proposed,
Mr. MUNEO : I am rather surprised at the hon.
member, Sir George Grey, bringing this question
forward at the present time.
Dr. Cockbtjrn : He mentioned it in the former
debate!
Mr. MUNEO : The hon. gentleman was a member
of the committee which drafted the bill. Was not
the matter thrashed out by the committee ?
Sir Samuel Griffith: We are not bound by the
report!
Mr. MUNEO : I do not say we are ; but the hon.
gentleman told us that the arguments made use of in
the committee were sufficient to convince him that he
was wrong, and I thought the same course might
have been followed on the present occasion, because
if he was wrong in his views then most assuredly he
is wrong now. The hon. member tells us that one of
the great effects of electing our own governor-general
would be to put him in the position of Abraham
Lincoln —to give him similar powers and a similar
position. Under our form of government that posi-
tion is occupied by the Prime Minister, and no matter
whether the governor-general were elected or not, he
could not under constitutional government exercise
the functions which Abraham Lincoln exercised. No
governor-general could undertake that responsibility,
whether appointed by the Crown or not. If the hon.
member’s argument were carried out to its legitimate
issue the people of England ought to elect their
sovereign. That is really what it means. The
governor-general is to appear here as the representa-
tive of the Queen. Under our Constitution the
Queen is to be in some sense present among us. The
only way in which we can have her present is through
her representative, and if her representative is to be
elected by ns, and not by herself, he will be not her
representative, but ours." To carry the hon. member’s
argument to its legitimate issue, therefore, he ought
to" say that the people of the empire should elect
their own monarch. .That is what it means. If the
hon. member is not prepared to say that, he ought
not to go to the extent to which he wishes to go. I
do not think, however, that this is a matter to which
we ought to devote much time at this stage; because
since we have already agreed —and we have done
so —that wo are to have a form of constitutional
government under the Crown, we must allow the
Crown the power of being represented in the union.
If we carry out the proposal of the hon. member, the
result would be that we must abandon the proposed
union, and have a union in a different direction,
certainly not under the Crown. The hon. member
said the result of his proposal would be to strengthen
the union with England; but I think few persons
will agree with him in that respect. I think the
people of Australia will agree wdth me that the result
of his proposal would be to weaken the union. We
should, in fact, begin to ask why we were connected
with England at all. If we could appoint our own
governor-general, if we could carry on all our legis-
lation, and do the whole of our business, the question
would soon be asked what we had to do with England,
and then where would the connection be? Ido
not see the necessity for considering the hon. menu
ber’s proposal at the present time. I am proud of
being a citizen of the great British empire, and shall
never fail to bo proud ot that position. I have no
desire to w'eaken a single link binding us to that
empire, whether as regards the appointment of a
governor-general or anything else. I desire to hold
those links sacred, and, if possible, to strengthen
them, and I am satisfied that in making his proposal
-the hon. member is not consulting the feelings of the
people of Australia.
Sir GEOEGE GEEY: I wish to answer a few of
the arguments raised by the hon. member, I under-
stood him to say that Abraham Lincoln would not
be wanted here.
Mr. Muxro : I did not say that. I said that our
governor-general could not do what Abraham Lincoln
did in America!
Sir GEOEGE GEEY: And that in that way he
would have been unnecessary.
Mr. Munro: That he would be unable to do what
Abraham Lincoln did !
Sir GEOEGE GEEY; But the hon. member has
not touched upon this point; What would be the
effect of opening this great office to all, of raising up
Abraham Lincolns as ministers to advise the governor-
general? That is the point. By raising such men, the
governor-general would obtain better adUce than he
would be likely to obtain if the offices were not open.
I have no doubt whatever that this is a complete
answer to that question—that the one thing is to raise
many Abraham Lincolns in the state. Should we bo
the w'orse for it ? They might not be necessary to-day
or at any particular moment, but undoubtedly it would
be a great object. There is another phase of the ques-
tion which the hon. member raised —that it would


amount to severance from the empire if the Queen did
not appoint the governor-general. The Queen does
not appoint the governors now. Ministers advise the
Queen as to who should be appointed ; but I say that
you should rather allow the whole people to give the
advice. Why cannot the united people of Australia
be capable of choosing a man, and advising the Queen
as beneficially as a person who knows nothing about
us, and who may be in the hands of colonists at home
who are spending large fortunes in an endeavour to
get into high life in England, and who may possibly
mislead official persons there as to what the desires
of the colonists are. I have heard no single reason
advanced that would induce me to change my mind
in the least degree. Let me hear some good and
conclusive answers given to my argument, and I will
deal with them ; but do not let the subject be dis-
missed without any reply being made. Let us fairly
argue out one of the greatest questions that can
occupy our minds in connection with this bill. lam
ready to answer any arguments that may be brought
forward ; but I cannot see that there is any weight
whatever in the arguments of the last speaker.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I am, to a great extent,
in sympathy with the object desired to be attained
by Sir George Grey. I believe the highest offices of
the state ought to be open to its own citizens ; but I
do not think it follows that the necessary way to bring
about that result is to provide that the governor-
general shall be directly elected by the people. Pro-
bably the greatest difficulties which have arisen in the
United States are owing to the manner in which the
president is there elected. If you have a direct election
of the president by the people, or such an indirect
election as has been substituted for it there, the practical
result would be that at every election of the governor-
general there would be a canvassing throughout the
whole dominion or commonwealth by the representa-
tives of respective parties, and the governor-general,
when elected, would regard himself as the nominee or
head of a party, and would devote a great part of his
time and attention to securing his re-election. These
are not the objects which the hon. member; Sir George
Grey, desires to attain. lam inclined to think that
this is one of those matters that will work out by
itself. lam much inclined to think that before many
years are over not only the governor-general, but the
governors of the different Australian colonies, will
practically be appointed, not, perhaps, by the direct
election, but with the full consent and concurrence,
known in advance, of the people of these colonies. I
believe the tendency i 3 strong in that direction at the
present time. I know that other members of the
Convention are of a different opinion. I am now
expressing my individual opinion. I believe it will
be to the interests of the Government of England to
appoint the best men, men acceptable to the people
of the commonwealth, and that they will exercise all
proper care to bring about that result. I have no doubt,
especially considering the greatly altered conditions of
the commonwealth, that great weight will be paid to
the wishes of the people, and that some means will be
found of nominations being made, if not directly by
the Australian commonwealth, yet under such circum-
stances as to secure appointments which would be
known to meet with the concurrence of the people of
these colonies. lam of that opinion • I cannot say
how it will work out in detail. I believe, also, that
when the people of Australia are of opinion—and
surely an opinion may be shown in other ways than
by an act of parliament—that it is desirable that a
distinguished Australian should be appointed to the
office of governor-general, some instances will be found
—if, indeed, the course is not invariably adopted—in
which distinguished Australians will be appointed to
the position. That, I take it, is all that the hon.
member, Sir George G»rey, desires to attain ; and it
can, compatibly with the retention of our relations
with the Crown, be attained by leaving the appoint-
ment as it is proposed to be left in the hands of the
Queen.
Mr. KINGSTON : I cannot help sharing the senti-
ments which have been expressed by the lion, member,
Sir George Grey, as regards the desirability of our
possessing the power of at least altering the present
practice with reference to the appointment of governors.
We need not go very far back in our history to recollect
occasions when the public mind was profoundly agitated
on this question, and a desire was very generally
expressed in some of the colonies, at least, that the
people of Australia should exercise a much larger power
in connection with the appointment of governors than
they do at present. Looking at the bill, I find that
this growing sentiment is recognised to a certain extent.
It is recognised so far as the various states are concerned
by provision being made in the bill enabling the state
parliaments to alter the practice as they may see tit.
We should be proceeding wisely and in a way which
we should be able to defend, if we conferred the same
power on the federal parliament. Sir Samuel Griffith
has said that in the natural order of things something
will be done to give effect to Australian aspirations in
this direction. Something has been done so far as
the states are concerned ; and surely it is only a
logical sequence that the same power should be given
to the federal parliament.
Mr. Munro : We have not yet given that power to
the states !
Mr. KINGSTON: The committee have recom-
mended that we should recognise the principle that
the people should decide the question through the
medium of the local parliaments. It is quite logical
that we should urge that the same power should be
given to the federal parliament, I do not think that
the hon. member, Sir George Grey, will be able to
secure a majority at this stage to affirm that in future
we should elect our own governor-general; but I think
he can fairly claim a most substantial support for a
proposition to enable the federal parliament from time
to time to deal with the question, and to make such
provision on the subject as will be in accordance with
Australian sentiment. If he proposes to amend the
clause in the direction I indicate, providing that the
present practice shall continue until otherwise altered,
I shall be happy to support him.
Captain RUSSELL : It is extremely difficult to
follow with any chance of success an address so impas-
sioned, so eloquent, and put in such charming language,
as that of my hon. colleague, Sir George Grey. I
dissent absolutely and entirely from the whole tone
of his speech. I feel that I shall be only doing my
duty by expressing the opinion that if his proposal is
carried it will bring a great evil on Australia. He
gave us a great deal of declamation; he told us about
the unnumbered benefits which were to come to the
rising generation of Australia ; but what they were
he did not explain. He led us to understand that
we have now no men in our colonial parliaments who
are men of note, of ability and independence, or
worthy of public He told us that we had
no Abraham Lincolns amongst us. If I may use such
a word, I would say that that is all nonsense. We
have lots of men who have not so extensive an arena
as Abraham Lincoln had, but who have devoted the
whole of their time, ability, and intelligence to the
service ef the country. They only need a wider arena
to perform deeds equal to those of any statesman.
We have every inducement to make us aspire to the
high positions of premiers and responsible ministers.
So long as that is the case, the mere desire to be elected
governor of his own state, or of Australasia, will not
deter any man from coming into public life, and serving
the country to the best of his ability. But let us go
a little further. If the proposition of my hon. and
venerable colleague be given effect to, we had better
at once tear up the bill we have prepared, because it


will be useless for any purpose whatever. Although
I was a member of the committee which prepared the
bill, I will not say that I agree with the whole of it.
But the whole basis of the bill is responsible govern-
ment. And what do we propose to do if we resolve
that the governor-general shall be elected by the whole
people of Australasia ? We intend either to make him
an absolute dummy, an absolutely useless man under
the thumb of the ministry of the day, or we intend to
confer upon him such absolute power that the ministry
of the day will be absolutely useless and effete. He
must be either an autocrat or a useless image set up
to represent the governor-general, which, I venture
to say, is not what we desire. Further than that,
what are his powers and functions 1 That seems to
be forgotten. And here I will point out to the lion,
member, Mr. Kingston, that we are not by any means
agreed on the question of electing the governors of
the states. The divisions in the select committees on
that question were very close. It yet remains to be
proved that this Convention will by a majority agree
with the principle of electing the governors of the
states. It seems to have escaped the observation of
lion, members who have spoken on this point that the
functions of the governor of a state, and pre-eminently
the function of the governor-general of Australasia, is
that he represents not alone the state or people of
Australasia, but that he is the type of, and represents
imperial interests—the connection which binds the
whole British empire together. Are we to destroy
that ? I believe that my colleague, Sir George Grey,
desires that there shall be separation from the Imperial
Government. The hon. gentleman saj's that it is not
his desire. I can only say that the impression upon
my mind is that such is the case. The hon. gentleman
says that it is not so, and I accept his statement from
the bottom of my heart. But the inevitable result of
the election of the governor-general must be to declare
that the people of England shall have no power what-
soever in connection with Australasia ; that they shall
have no power of dealing with any imperial matter.
I believe that would be an injury to Australasia, and
if it were on that ground only, I would object to the
governor-general being elected by the people.
Sir GEORGE GREY : I feel it necessary to reply
to some of the things that have been said. From the
bottom of my heart I believe that those men who do
not want to have an elected governor are themselves
likely to bring about a disruption between this country
and Great Britain. I believe that the hon. member,
Captain Russell, is the man likely to do that, and not
myself. There are two classes of men in the country.
There are the men who for a long time under the
system of plural voting have exercised a vast influence
—men who will by their wealth exercise a vast influ-
ence as long as there is not an elected governor here.
Honors might, perhaps, be obtained from home. I
said "honors," but I should have said "decorations,"
because the meaning of honors is something given
for great services performed. So long as there are
governors-general sent here from England, so long, I
believe, there must inevitably be what is called an
aristocratic British party resident in Australasia, who
never will cease attempting to carry out their objects.
Such is almost a necessity of the case, and I firmly
believe that those who say that the people here are
worthy to choose their own governors, and ought to
have the powei", are those who are fighting for the
cause of Great Britain and for the union of the colonies
with Great Britain for a long period of time. How
can it be said that there will be no tie to bind the
colonies to England unless we have a governor-general
appointed from home 1 Is there not a sufficient tie in
the fact that we have to send every one of our laws
home for the Queen's approval ? We place ourselves
so absolutely under the power of the British Crown
that every law has to be sent for her Majesty's appro-
val. What stronger tie can there be than that ?
An llon. Member : We do not send all our laws
home!
Sir GEORGE GREY: Yes we do. The hon.
member does not know what he is saying. Every one
of our laws goes home for the Queen’s approval. The
hon. gentleman who denies that knows nothing of the
Constitution. Although our laws are assented to here,
they go home to the Queen. Assent being given to
them here only brings them into immediate operation.
Hon. members are entirely ignorant of what they are
talking about. Full power is given to the Queen to
allow or disallow our laws. There can be no stronger
tie than that binding us to Great Britain. Just fancy
4,000,000 people going to the Queen as soon as they
have an opportunity to make their own constitution,
and saying, “ We will still send every law we make to
that Sovereign whom we—l was going to say almost
adore—in order that she may assent to or dissent from
the measure.” What stronger tie than that can bind
us to Great Britain ? What stronger proof can we
give of our devotion to the British interests 1 What
will a few balls at Government House, or the presence
of a governor here, do to alter that 1 The very gentle-
men who argue in that way say to me ; u First you
make a governor-general something that he ought not
to be; he is advising his ministry instead of his
ministry advising him.” Then immediately afterwards
they say, “ You must have a governor-general appointed
by the British ministry in order that he may let them
know what the British interests are, and look after
them.” The two things are absolutely contradictory.
If hon. members will fairly consider the subject they
will see that. I ask nothing but what is just, nothing
but a right which the people have, nothing which
derogates from the powers of the Crown, nothing which
does any evil to the country, but something which
would confer blessings in every direction. We are
told that there are many Abraham Lincolns here.
Now, I accept that. Suppose the country is in such a
blessed state that it has a number of men of that kind,
how many more would it have if new objects of just
and legitimate ambition were opened to them to rouse
their faculties in a way in which they have never been
roused until the present day, to make them feel their
dignity as men, and not to go home, as I shall to-night
if this is carried,feeling that no fair opportunity is given
to me, not of becoming governor-general, but of exercis-
ing my ordinary faculties when you tell me that I have
no chance of having great offices open to me, that I am
standing on a lower level than my fellow-countrymen in
Great Britain, for they have the chance there of obtain-
ing by influence good appointments which the whole of
the 4,000,000 of Australasia can never know and never
have bestowed upon them. To tell truths of this kind
is called declamation. But I ask, can any one contem-
plate on the one hand without shame the idea that he
is to be shut out from all the great offices of the country,
and on the other hand, can he do anything but feel
great fervour when he contemplates the advantage to
l\is countrymen that would ensue from all those offices
being open to them ? It may be said that this is
declamation ", but I say that it is the honest ti’uth, a
great truth, and a holy truth, which no man can utter
without feeling raised somewhat above his ordinary
mood and manner of life. I admit that Ido feel that,
I rather glory in entertaining this feeling; and I feel
sorry that no single voice is raised to aid me in what
I believe to be a truly great and noble object.
Mr. DEAKIN : If no voice is raised to support
the hon. member, I believe it is because most of
us are utterly unable to take the same view which he
does of this particular office, and of the ambition
which is supposed to exist to All it. I should be loath
to say a single word that would appear to derogate
from the great dignity and honor attaching to the
office of governor of one of the colonies, and much
more to that of the governor-general of Australasia,
a most high, and honorable, and dignified position


But is it a position to which any number of the
people of the colony are ever likely to aspire ? In
my opinion there is nothing in it to arouse the
ambition of those who claim to stand on the liberal
side of the community. What they seek, if they
seek anything, if their ambition is a worthy one,
is to give effect to the principles in which they
believe —to be able to do something, to strike some
blow, to be able to do some small deed which shall
establish their principles in the government of the
country. What can a governor or a governor-general
do to give effect to the highest principles which he
holds? Nothing. What do his convictions count for
in a country such as this is and will be ? He may
cling to his principles with an ardour and devotion
equal to that of any other man, but he of all men in
the community is the one who is debarred from the
privilege of doing anything to advance them. Setting
aside the tacit, the silent, personal influence which
such a man inevitably exercises upon those who sur-
round him, he is as much removed from the interests
and the future of the country in which he lives as if
he were still a resident in the mother country. What
we say is, therefore, that the ambition of the demo-
cracy of this country is an ambition to shape its laws,
to guide its destinies, to widen its opportunities, to
make life in this country better worth living than it
has been hitherto. For this purpose the position of a
representative in any of these colonies is infinitely
superior to that of governor-general. We say that
any man who has received his authority direct from
the people, who is commissioned to devote his abilities
to great tasks, and who joins his fellowmen in per-
forming public duties, fills a position, politically, higher
than the post of social distinction occupied by the
governor-general. When the lion, member points to
the splendid example of Lincoln, the hero of America,
his proposal to make such a man a governor or a
governor-general is almost grotesque. Lincoln exer-
cised powers such as will never be possessed by any
governor-general. If we have any Abraham Lincolns
in this country who desire to fulfil the same destiny, the
position of governor-general is the very last into which,
we should put them. If wo ever possess a man of his
rude, rugged, magnificent nature we should not offer
him an office of this kind which, indeed, he would not
deign to accept, because he would feel that in it his
splendid powers would be wasted. What should we
do with such a man ? I trust that we should make
him premier of Australia ; and I should say then that
he was filling the office for which he was fitted, that
he had stepped into the position in which he could
best employ all his ability, that he had found the
worthy object of his ambition, and that he could fulfil
his own destiny and the destiny of his people. It is
because we take this position, because we cannot see
that the office of governor or governor-general is one
so much to be desired by those who take the demo-
cratic view of it, and because we have a better use to
which to put our great men, that we feel so little
concern about the matter. For my part, if I can see
established in Australia responsible government in the
fullest acceptation of the term—a government in
which the governor can take no action which is
not countersigned by his responsible advisers, who
must answer for their conduct to their parliament,
and in which the governor-general, so far as his
political status is concerned, has no authority what-
ever except to chose his advisers subject to the
approval of parliament, I shall be satisfied. It is
proposed by one hon. gentleman that even his power
of refusing a dissolution should be taken away. It is
proposed to reduce the governor's political powers,
more than ever though he may at any time increase
his social and personal influence. In a community such
as ours, with the future which we believe to lie before it,
the office of governor-general is not one to which a
democrat will aspire. To make it an object of ambi-
tion you must change its character altogether, and
make it an office like that of the President of the
United States —a high executive office in which a man
can carry out his ideas and give effect to his principles.
If you do that, you must consider his election. We
should insist upon it. If he becomes a personage in
the political life of the country, his office must be
elective. We cannot afford to have in our constitution
any man exercising authority, unless he derives it
from the people of Australia. At the present time we
say that the governor-general exercises no such autho-
rity. He exercises the power of the Sovereign of
Great Bx-itain, and no more than the people of Great
Britain feel degraded and limited, because no one
there can hope to aspire to be the monarch of that
country, do we feel degraded and limited because we
cannot aspii'e to be governor-general. We are satis-
fied with all the other offices in the state being
open to us, it being possible for the meanest, humblest,
and poorest to aspire to the highest office in the
commonwealth—that is, the premiership. We feel
no regret through being debai-red from this one cere-
monial office. High though it may be, it is but
ceremonial, and we feel no deprivation in any sense
because it is closed to us. So, while cordially echoing
all the sentiments to which the hon. and venerable
member has given utterance, and though in full
sympathy with his opinions, the younger democrats
must confess themselves to have no sympathy with
him in this particular aim on which he has set his
heart. We cannot help regretting that even on what
we consider a small point, we should not be found
fighting on the same side with him. Our minds,
however, run in such a different channel, and we fix
upon such a different object as the summit of Austra-
lian ambition, that we regard with little favour the
title which seems to him so valuable, but which
appears to the active politician to be little better than
a glittering and gaudy toy.
Sir JOHN DOWNER: Listening, as I do, with
the greatest pleasure to everything that falls from the
hon. member, Sir George Grey, I should be anxious in
every way to agree with him if I could by any means
bring myself to concur in his views. If the hon.
gentleman had commenced his argument by asking
what was the necessity for a governor-general, or for
a governor at all, he might have appealed to the
sympathies of a good many of us, because, as Mr.
Deakin said, the office both of governor-general and
of the local governors must in the nature of things be
so much of the character of ceremonials, and have so
little substantial authority, that had the hon. gentle-
man suggested that we should dispense with these—
as some pei-sons might consider them—baubles, there
might have been a good deal to be said in favour of
the proposition. But when the hon. gentleman, who
I think generally believes in the British Constitution,
at the same advocates with such earnestness, elo-
quence, and seriousness the appointment from amongst
ourselves, and from our own population, of the gentle-
man occupying the position of governor-general, I
would ask him in what position will the governoi'-
general be when he is elected 1 If he is elected by the
voice of the people, does the hon. gentleman assume
that history will not repeat itself, and that the
governor-general will not assume a position some-
thing like that of the President of the United
States, so that the cry amongst political parties will
be, " Who is for the president, and who is against
him ?" If what we want to do is to get rid of the
authority of the Queen, and to make the real
substantial authority of the realm the person in the
position of governoi'-general, the way to do it is to
appoint the governor-general in the way the hon.
gentleman suggests; but if we want to retain the
authority in the people—apart from the question
whether it is to be in the senate or in the house of
representatives, or in both co-oi'dinately—subject to


the authority o'f the Sovereign, it would be inviting
at once an interference with that authority to put at
the head of the government a person elected by the
people, and who, from the very nature of his election,
would speak with authority, and assume a dominion
over the commonwealth, which we are certainly not
prepared to concede. I think the hon. gentleman
must not attribute to any one of us the slightest dis-
respect, or feel hurt because we do not arrive at the
same conclusions as he has arrived at, because,
although, as the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, said, as a
general principle, we think that all authority should
come from the people, and that all officers should be
elected by the people, we are not prepared to interfere
with the cardinal principle of our Constitution, and
that is, that the nominal head of the government
should be only the nominal head of the executive, and
not become a real, substantial, legislative force in the
community.
Sir GEORGE GREY: I have two sets of arguments
which run in very nearly parallel lines to answer.
The first of the two last speakers, I should say, has
overlooked one point altogether. The Sovereign of
Great Britain has a great stake in the empire and in
Great Britain—the preservation of the throne for her
race—and she has also great authority. Hon. gentle-
men also overlook this fact, that on many occasions
the Queen has been the adviser of her ministers. She
has been consulted by them, and her advice has been
gratefully taken. It has been the advice of one
agitated by no political passions, by no feelings of
animosity against different persons such as are
engendered by debate, and in many instances this advice
has been of the greatest possible use to the nation, and
I contend that over and over again crises have taken
place in these colonies where the opinion of a governor
elected by the whole of Australia, who was also a
man of ability, and therefore entitled to respect of the
highest kind, might have been of the greatest possible
use. I believe that if in dealing with all these labour
questions we had such a man, of philosophic mind, of
trained intellect, not agitated by the passions of debate
in parliament, not elected by a certain party in the
state, and therefore representing them and bound to
protect their interests —I believe that if the govern-
ment had had an adviser of that kind many and great
difficulties would have been avoided. He must have
taken their advice, and he would have done so with
cheerfulness and goodwill, and endeavoured to render
it successful when they persisted in it; and that there
should be such a power to help and guide them would,
I am certain, be of the greatest possible advantage to
the country. These arguments apply also to the
speech of the hon. gentleman who last spoke. I feel
sure that if he will reflect over it in his own mind he
will see that it will be far better to have a man of
that kind here than one sent from Great Britain,
possibly bound up strongly with a political party
there, and anxious to create a political party here,
which Government House influence would enable him
to a great degree to do. I believe that the presence
of such a person in the state would be infinitely
more injurious to it than would be the presence of
an elective governor chosen by the people of the coun-
try. I thank the hon. member, Sir John Downer,
for his remarks about the feeling with which the
opposition to all X say has been made. I feel no
anger at all. I am delighted that hon. gentlemen
have spoken as they have; that the whole
matter has been fully and completely discussed. But
all that I have heard simply confirms me in my
opinions more and more. I am satisfied that I am
right. As I stand here I feel satisfied that if to the
people of Australia themselves was left the power of
expressing their views on the subject, an enormous
majority would be found to agree with me, and I
only hope yet that if this mode of appointing the
governor-general is determined upon, petitions will
come to parliament from this country, and I believe
that those petitions will be so largely signed that
parliament will feel that the great strength of
Australian opinion is in favour of the election of the
governor-general by the people, and that parliament
will yield to what it finds to be the belief of the
people, and that that will ultimately become law if a
constitution is to be given to us ; for however hon.
gentlemen may persuade themselves that they have
the opinions of the people with them, I am satisfied
from my knowledge of the persons in various parts
of the country with whom I have been in correspon-
dence that a totally different opinion really does
subsist, and that a much larger majority of the people
than they believe hold the views that I have expressed
to-day, and which I have done my very utmost to get
approval given to by this Convention. lam sorry
naturally that I have failed in my object; but I
cheerfully submit to what is the will of the majority.
I will endeavour to render everything they do success-
ful for Australia in every form, though adverse to my
own views. But feeling all that, at the same time I
feel that I have wisely, and, I believe, justly, advised
the Convention this afternoon.

Question so resolved in the affirmative.
Amendment (by Sir Samuel Griffith) agreed to ;
That the words “her Majesty’s,” line 4, be omitted with
■the view of inserting the words “ the Queen’s.”
Mr. BAKER; I move as an amendment :
That after the word “functions,” line C, the following
words be inserted “as are contained in schedule B
hereto, and such other powers and functions not inconsistent
therewith.”
It will be seen that we are deliberately making the
instructions given to her Majesty’s representative
part of our constitution.
Mr. Clark ; No; subject to the constitution !
Mr. BAKER ; I admit that no instructions can be
given which are inconsistent with the constitution,
but instructions can be given which are additional
to the constitution, and which cover grounds not
mentioned in the constitution.
Sir Samuel Griffith : How 1
Mr. BAKER : Why, under the provisions of an
act a despatch was sent from the Government of
Queensland, I think it was, to England in which it
was stated that the royal instructions to the governor
are part of the constitutional law of the colony, I
believe that is undoubted, and we are affirming that
in this particular clause. Why should we go to
Downing-streetfor any part of our constitution which
we can put into this act 1
Mr. Deakin : What do you propose to put in
then 1


Mr. BAKER : Well, I am not prepared to put in
the whole of the powers and functions which are to
be expressly set forth as having to be performed by
the Governor ; but I want to affirm the proposition
that they shall be, as far as possible, contained in our
constitution. Here is one matter to which I will
allude. In 1878, after the Dominion of Canada had
been formed, they objected to the instructions given
to the Governor-General of Canada. They said that
they did not consider that he was sufficiently amenable
to his advisers, that a good many of the matters upon
which he had instructions from the home Government
were matters upon which he ought to have followed
the advice of his constitutional advisers, and Mr.
Blake, who was the Minister of Justice, wrote several
able despatches on the matter, and proceeded to Eng-
land, I believe, twice. He certainly proceeded to
England once, and after a great deal of trouble, and a
great deal of friction, the home Government gave
way, and they erased from the former instructions an
immense number of instructions which had formerly
been contained in them. Among other things I will
mention one matter which, I think, certainly ought
to be inserted in the schedule of this bill, and that is
as to the manner in which the governor-general is to
exercise the prerogative of pardon. We know very
well that, according to the instructions now extant,
which have never been altered, our colonial governors
have the right of exercising their own discretion ; and
we also know that whenever Downing-street has been
appealed to to uphold a governor in carrying out the
powers which they say he ought to possess, they have
shuffled in the matter. In Canada it has been
provided that the power of the prerogative of pardon
is to be exercised by the Governor-General :
Ist. As to capital cases, with the advice of the Privy
Council.
2nd. As to other cases, with the advice of at least one of
his ministers.
3rd, As to cases in which pardon or reprieve might directly
affect the interests of the empire, or any country or place
beyond the jurisdiction of the Government of the Dominion,
the Governor-General is, before deciding, to “ take those
interests specially into his own personal consideration, in
conjunction with such advice as aforesaid.”
That is clearly laid down, I think. The last portion—
the third subdivision—is quite proper, because he acts
in matters relating to the interests of the empire as
an officer of the Imperial Government ; but in all
other cases it is expressly laid down that he is to act
on the advice of his responsible ministers. That is
only one point. I should like to see in the schedule
to this bill all the powers and functions of the
governor-general which it is possible to define and to
reduce to writing, so defined. Ido not wish that we
should have to go to Downing-street from time to
time to find out what the powers of our constitution
are.
Mr. DEAKIN : The first question that arises
might be as to whether this is the best means of
accomplishing the end which the hon. member has in
his mind. If the hon. member proposes to define the
powers of the governor-general so far as they can be
defined, I am cordially with him. The matter,
indeed, received some attention at the hands of the
committee, though the question as to the method of
definition to be adopted was felt to be surrounded
with difficulty. The solution which I wish to suggest
to the hon. member who has now moved his amend-
ment is that it would be better to embody in the bill
itself anything that we have to say on this subject;
and for my own part, I cannot conceive that it will be
necessary to do* any thing more—if I may repeat what
I was urging a few minutes ago in connection, with
another subject—than to insert in this bill, and to state
on the very face of the constitution, that the Governor
shall invariably act on the advice of his responsible
ministers, that every act of his shall be countersigned
by a responsible minister who shall make himself
responsible by his signature for that particular act.
That will apply even to circumstances under which a
governor-general changes his ministers.
Sir Samuel Griffith : He has got to turn out the
first lot on nobody’s advice !
Mr. DEAKIN : Exactly ; but, as the hon. member
is perfectly well aware, having gone through the pro-
cess so often himself, the incoming ministry invariably
take that responsibility upon their shoulders.
Sir Samuel Griffith : That is not acting on advice,
though !
Mr. Playford : It is acting on his own responsi-
bility !
Mr. DEAKIN : Not at all. However, the ques-
tion is one of phraseology. If we are agreed on the
principle, we can easily embody it in language; and I
would suggest to the hon. member, Mr. Baker, that it
would meet all the purposes of the schedule which he
proposes, and do away with what seems to be an
indirect method of dealing with the matter, to say
directly that the Governor’s powers shall be limited
by the necessity on his part of obtaining the signature
of a responsible minister to every one of his acts.
Mr. WRIXON : It seems to me, sir, that if we
take care, when we come to the portion of the bill
dealing with the executive government, to thoroughly
establish responsible government, we may let this clause
go as it is, because whatever functions are vested in
the governor-general will then necessarily come under
the operation of responsible government, and we need
do nothing further. It is just like the case of the
Sovereign herself. She has vast prerogatives, great
powers ; but however vast or great they are does not
signify to the people of England so long as there is
responsible government established. Therefore, instead
of seeking to limit the powei’s which the Sovereign
may depute to the governor-general, or to schedule
the acts which he may or may not do, we have to take
care to thoroughly establish responsible government,
and if we do that the rest will take care of itself. For
example, take the very point which the hon. member,
Mr. Baker, puts about pardon. I maintain that the
prerogative of pardon is now, in all these communities
where we have responsible government, just as much
under the operation of responsible government as is
any other prerogative, and the thing works in this
simple way : Supposing that the head of the executive
—the governor—desires, we will say, t© hang a man
whom the government of the day think should not be
hanged, they walk out of office, and will not accept the
responsibility. It is all a question of whether they
are not prepared to take the responsibility of any
action of the governor.
Dr. Cockburn : Is it not absurd to have a crisis on
such a matter as that 1
Mr. WRIXON : It is all a matter of consideration
in each case. I do not say that in every case the
ministry will go out of office—not at all; but I say
that that is the way in which the thing works, and it
works for itself. You want no definition or enumera-
tion of the powers. All you have to take care is that
you thoroughly establish responsible government, and
I think that a few words ought to be added to the bill
when we come to that portion.
Dr. COCKBURN : I agree with the remarks of
the hon. member, Mr. Deakin. In fact he has put in
the most succinct language what I was trying to bring
under the notice of the Convention. I think it is
agreed that the exercise of all power should be respon-
sible, and I do think that after the debate which we
have had on the former portion of the clause it will be
all the more necessary to clearly point out that the
governor-general shall not exercise any powers without
the distinct advice of his executive, because if any
one suffered in the debate which has lately taken place
it is the future governor-general. It was pointed out
that his highest function would be to be a dummy, and
that although he was the only link between us and the


Crown, in being that link he was less than the least in
the whole of the colonies—a useless image and a bauble
—and as the vote subsequently taken rather proved
that this high conception of the office of the governor-
general was the opinion of the vast majority in this
Convention, and that his election by the people would
be to create him a real person instead of an imaginary
one, I think it is all the more necessary, as we have
decided to have this imaginary functionary, that his
powers should not be real, and certainly no powers of
life and death should be vested in such an officer as
the majority of the Convention wish to see the gover-
nor-general reduced to. I think that in every way the
voice of the people should prevail, and 1 .certainly
think that we should have had nothing to fear, even
if the hon. member, Sir George Grey, had been suc-
cessful in carrying the amendment which he moved a
little while ago, and in regard to which I had the
honor of voting with him. lam much obliged to the
hon. member, Mr. Deakin, for having suggested a
manner in which the wishes that I had expressed may
be carried out.
Mr. PLAYFORD : There is one point on which I
think you cannot say that the governor-general shall
act with the advice of his ministers for the time-being,
and that is where his ministers ask for a dissolution
of the house.
Mr. Deakin : But then he gets somebody else to
advise him not to dissolve the house !
Mr. PLAYFORD : The hon. member now says
that he would act with the approval of some other
persons.
Mr. Deakin : Yes, responsible ministers !
Mr. PLAYFORD: But he commits the act of
refusing a dissolution to the ministry of the day
before other ministers are there at all.
Mr. Deakin : He finds some one to take the respon-
sibility !
Mr. PLAYFORD : He must act on his own
responsibility.
Mr. Deakin : No, never. “ The Crown can do no
wrong !”
Mr. PLAYFORD: He must act on his own
responsibility.
Dr, Cockburn : To whom is he responsible h
Mr. PLAYFORD : He is, I imagine, responsible
to her Majesty the Queen. I can entirely understand
the position, and I say that under ordinary circum-
stances, and in the great majority of instances, he
must undoubtedly act with the advice of his ministers ;
but there is that one case in which he cannot act with
the advice of his ministers.
Mr. Deakin : That is only a matter of expression—
either with the advice of his responsible ministers for
the time-being or with that of some others who accept
the responsibility !
Mr. PLAYFORD : If the hon. member likes to
put it in that way it does away with my objection;
but in the granting or refusing to grant a dissolution
the govei’nor-general must act on Jus own responsi-
bility, and not on anybody’s advice.
Mr. Munro : The Queen does not do that!
Mr. PLAYFORD : The Queen has the power to
do it, whether she has or has not done it. I know
the Governor of South Australia exercised the power
only a short time ago against the hotr. member who
has asked that the power shall not be allowed to be
exercised.
Mr. Deakin : He evidently found some one ready
to support him !
Mr. PLAYFORD ; Undoubtedly he did. Ail I have
to say in the matter is that we had better leave it as
it is. There is no necessity to define the governor’s
powers,, which appear to me to be small enough at the
present moment.
Mr. Deakin : We want to make them clear, not
small!
Mr, PLAYFORD : We have not felt any incon-
venience with regard to the powers given hy the
Queen in letters patent to the governors, and I think
that we shall not find any difficulty in the common-
wealth.
Dr. COCKBURN : I am arguing simply what I
have always argued ever since I have been in politics
—that is to say, that the exercise of power should be
vested in those directly responsible to the people ;
and I say that the punishment of ministers -who dare
to bring about a dissolution of parliament, unless the
voice of the people is with them, is sudden and fatal,
and that any men who brought about a dissolution of
parliament unless they had the voice of the country
behind them would be politically ruined, if not for
ever, at least for a considerable, time ; and I think it
better to sheet home the responsibility as far as
possible to the ministers themselves. It is all very
w 7 ell to say that they are responsible. The governor,
of course, is responsible to the Queen for the exercise
of his authority. I think that the exercise of such a
large pow r er as that of dissolving the house of repre-
sentatives .should be vested in those directly responsible
to the people, and not in some one responsible to a
distant authority. In advancing the views I have
put forward, I have not been guided by any recent
events in politics, but have simply expressed the
views I have held ever since I first had the honor of
entering parliament.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I would point out,
sir, that the discussion is rather departing from the
amendment before the Committee, which is to define
the powers of the governor-general. I should like to
ask the hon. gentleman, Mr. Baker, if he has
attempted to make out a list of the executive
functions of the governor-general ? I think he would
find it a difficult task, and would have to introduce
general words which would mean no more than the
words now in the clause.
Mr. BAKER ; I am willing to admit that it would
be impossible, and most impolitic to try, to define all
the powers of the governor-general; but I would
point out to the hon. and learned member, Sir
Samuel Griffith, that, as draftsman of the bill, he has
partially done what I am advocating. In clause 57
he has defined the powers of the governor-general in
reference to assenting to bills, and why should we
not do the same in regard to any other matter which
is capable of being defined 1 Take, for instance, the
exercise of the prerogative of pardon. Is there any
sound reason why the duty and the power of the
governor-general should be defined in reference to
giving the royal assent to bills, and not in reference
to the exercise of the prerogative of pardon ? I can
see none. I would ask leave to withdraw my amend-
ment, because I F ink there is a good deal of force
in what the hon. member, Mr, Deakin, said, that
perhaps this is not the best way to attain my object.
I shall, if I am allowed to withdraw the amendment,
consider whether I can draw one or two clauses,
which will come in after clauses 57 and 58, and be a
sequence, as it were, to the example therein set, of
defining the powers of the governor-general.
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
Amendment (by Sir Samuel Griffith) agreed to :
That the words “her Majesty may deem necessary or
expedient ” be omitted with a view te insert in lieu thereof
the words “ the Queen may think fit.”
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
Clause 3. The annual salary of the governor-general shall
be fixed by the parliament from time to time, but shall not
be less than ten thousand pounds, and the same shall be
payable to the Queen out of the consolidated revenue fund of
the commonwealth. The salary of a governor-general shall
not be diminished during his continuance in office.
Mr. BARTON : I propose to omit the words “ the
same ”as being quite unnecessary. The alteration
will, I think, improve the bill.


Sir HARRY ATKINSON : I should like to see
all the words after “ from time to time ” omitted, for
I do not see why we should fix the amount at
<£lo,ooo. I therefore move ;
That the words “but shall not be less than ten thousand
pounds ” be omitted.
Mr. GILLIES : I should like to know from the
hon. member the object of omitting the words. Is it
that there shall be no salary at all 1
Sir Harry Atkinson: No; it is that the federal
parliament shall be left perfectly free to deal with the
question of salary itself.
An Hon. Member : I suppose the hon. member
would do the same with the ministers ?
Sir Harry Atkinson : I should do exactly the
same with the ministers !
Mr. MXJNRO ; I feel that the hon. member, Sir
Harry Atkinson, cannot have considered what he
proposes to do. The governor-general must be
appointed before the parliament is called into exist-
ence, and does the hon. member think that any
one will take the office without some assurance
that he will get a salary of some sort ? Surely
the governor-general ought to know something
about the office he is to fill and the emolument
attached to the position ! If the amendment be made
the result will be that the appointment will be made
without any assurance as to the emolument which
the holder is to receive. The hon, member says he
will make a similar proposal with regard to the
ministers of the Crown. I venture to say that the
two proposals are really unwise, and that we ought
now to attach some decent salary to the office giving
power to the parliament to vary it, but not to reduce
it during the term of office of the gentleman appointed
afterwards. My conviction is that a salary of £lO,OOO
is altogether inadequate for the office. My feeling is
that the gentleman to be appointed ought to be equal
to the gentleman appointed as Governor-General of
India, He ought to be a gentleman capable of being
a cabinet minister in England, and for that purpose
the salary ought to be very much larger than what is
proposed. I do not think it is to the advantage of the
colonies to hawk this position about in such a way
that no man of good standing or position will take it.
When the Constitution of Victoria was agreed to
many years ago, I think the population of the colony
was about only 250,000, and yet they fixed the
governor’s salary at £lO,OOO, with an allowance of
£5,000, making it £15,000 in all. Since then it has
been reduced to £lO,OOO a year, but a house is pro-
vided furnished, so that practically the emolument
comes to £15,000 a year now. Now, this Convention,
representing the whole of Australia, is going to give
the governor-general a salary equal to what is given
to the Governor of Victoria at the present time.
Mr. Clark : You will reduce yours !
Mr. MUNRO : No, we do not intend to reduce
ours. We think the Governor of Victoria is entitled
to the salary, and perhaps more, if we could afford it.
At any rate, I think that instead of striking out these
words, and making the amount indefinite—in fact,
making no provision at all—the words ought to be
struck out with the view of increasing the amount
very considerably.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Another reason why
the words should not be struck out is not only the
importance of the first governor general knowing how
much he is to get—a very important consideration in
choosing him—but that the federal parliament might
simply by reducing the salary cut the connection with
Great Britain altogether. Supposing that it were to
reduce the salary to £lOO or £l,OOO a year ! That is
the reason why in all the constitution acts there has
been the reservation of a fixed sum, which is made
payable to her Majesty, so that she has always money
to pay her governor-general, and therefore can always
secure the appointment in the country of her repre-
sentative with an adequate salary. I agree with the
hon. member, Mr. Munro, that the salary is too small,
having regard to the salary given to the Governor of
Victoria.
Sir JOHN BRAY : I think it is desirable to fix the
salary of the first governor-general. The clause says
that the salary shall not be less than £lO,OOO. It is
very possible, I think, that that expression may lead
to very serious misunderstanding. It is an intimation
to the governor-general that he shall get £lO,OOO a
year, and probably a good deal more than that. He
ought to know when appointed what his salary is to
be, and I think, therefore, that the salary of the first
governor-general should be fixed in the bill. The
words “ but shall not be less than ” should therefore
be omitted.
Sir Samuel Griffith : That would enable the
federal parliament to reduce the salary to £l,OOO !
Sir JOHN BRAY : No, because the clause provides
that the salary shall not be diminished during the
governor’s continuance in office. But lam astonished
to hear it suggested that the federal parliament would
be so supremely ridiculous as to fix a nominal salary
for a governor-general. It is to my mind utterly out
of the question to imagine that such would be the case.
If we leave the clause as it stands we say to the federal
parliament, “We cannot trust you to fix the salary;
we will fix it at not less than £lO,OOO, whatever the
circumstances of the federal government may be.”
Surely if we give the federal government the powers
which it is proposed to give them we can trust them
to see that proper provision is made for the salary of
the governor-general. I think we should fix the salary
of the first governor-general at £lO,OOO, leaving it to
the federal government to fix the salary subsequently.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : The hon. member, Sir
John Bray, surely could not have heard my argument.
Does he suggest that the framers of the constitutions
of the various colonies did not understand their
business 1 This reservation in regard to the salary of
governors is made in the whole of the acts.
Sir John Bray : But there is power to alter the act !
Mr. Gillies : Only by a certain majority !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH ; The salary cannot be
diminished unless by an amendment of the act, and
that is the object of the reservation. The idea is to
secure the means of providing a representative of the
Queen in the colony with an adequate salary. I will
put this illustration. If you give to the federal parlia-
ment absolute power to reduce the salary, some persons
may be constantly endeavouring to earn a little cheap
popularity by proposing reductions. You will have
continual agitations for the reduction of the salary to
£B,OOO, or £6,000 or less. It would, perhaps, be
regarded as a very popular move on the part of some
persons.
Dr. Cockburn : Is that not rather a serious reflec-
tion upon public opinion 1
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I have heard of
persons who, in order to gain a little cheap popularity,
have been capable of that sort of thing. I think the
proposed amendment would be a great mistake. The
salary of course could be altered as part of the consti-
tution; but then it would be only by the deliberate
action of a majority of both houses, and with the
approval of the states.
Sir John Bray: Why not leave the salary to the
federal parliament 1
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : It might then be de-
termined by an accidental majority perhaps at the end
of the session. I understood the hon. member to
suggest that the salary should not be either increased
or diminished during the governor’s tenure of office,
and to argue that if the words “ but shall not be less
than ” were retained, the governor would ' perhaps
expect more than £lO,OOO. I hope, for the reasons
I have given, that the Committee will not omit the
words.


Mr. DEAKIN : There is another contingency pos-
sible, if the hon. member, Sir John Bray, feels that
there is force—and there is force—in the remarks of
Sir Samuel Griffith as to the necessity for protecting
the salary of the governor-general against hasty reduc-
tion, allowing it to be reduced only by the machinery
provided for an amendment of the constitution. The
hon. member can yet press—and very properly—an
amendment omitting the words “ not less than,” be-
cause while this renders it impossible to diminish the
salary without altering the constitution, it leaves it
perfectly possible to increase it by means of an ordinary
bill.
Sir Samuel Griffith : That is as the clause stands
now !
Mr. DEAKUST: If it were desired to provide
£12,000 or £15,000, the extra amount could be appro-
priated by an ordinary act of parliament, because it
would not alter the constitution. I think, therefore,
that the hon. member, Sir John Bray, is justified in
pressing his amendment to the point of rendering it
necessary to alter the constitution, if it be wished to
raise or diminish the salary of the governor-general.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Why—for the purpose of
raising it ?
Sir GEORGE GREY : I entirely differ from the
hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, in thinking that
the power of reduction would be exercised for the
sake of popularity. It is to suppose that a majority
of the federal parliament would make an alteration
from an unworthy motive. It might be thought that
the salary was much too large, and that it was in-
jurious to the interests of the colony to pay such a
large salary. The salary of the governor-general
should be reduced whenever parliament so desires,
and should be increased at any time parliament may
see fit to increase it. I think parliament ought to
have the fullest power in fixing the salary.
Sir JOHN BRAY : I understand that if the amend-
ment of the hon, member, Sir Harry Atkinson, is put,
and it is determined that the words shall stand, the
amendment I desire to move cannot be put.
The Chairman ; That is the case.
Sir HARRY ATKINSON: With the permission
of the Committee, I should like to withdraw my
amendment.
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
Sir JOHN BRAY : I move :
That the words “but shall not bo less than,” lines 2and 3, be
omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words “ and
until so fixed shall be.”
Sir Samuel Griffith : That is exactly the same
amendment; it strikes out the minimum !
Sir JOHN BRAY : It is not the same. My pro-
posal is that the salary of the governor-general shall
be £lO,OOO until it is fixed by the federal parliament.
Surely we ought to intrust the federal parliament with
the power of making proper provision for the salary
of the governor-general, and ought not to make it
necessary to alter the constitution act in order to
alter the salary paid to that official. If we have any
faith whatever in the federal parliament, we ought
not to hesitate to empower them to either reduce or in-
crease the salary as may appear to them to be necessary.
Mr. GILLIES : I should have been pleased if the
hon. member, Sir John Bray, had replied to the state-
ments made on the other side by the hon. member,
Sir Samuel Griffith, in reference to what has been
the universal practice. The hon. member must surely
know that the salaries of judges and other high
officials are fixed by act so that they may bo generally
known ; but this does not prevent parliament from
altering them. If the proposed words arc inserted the
federal parliament may consider it its duty, as soon
as it met, to consider the whole question of salary.
Tf we are to have a suitable person to occupy the posi-
tion of governor-general both he and we ought to
know what salary he is to receive.
Sir Harry Atkinson : It will be fixed permanently
for his term of office !
Mr. GILLIES : I beg pardon ; we have not yet
gone far enough in the clause to decide that question.
The proper thing for us to do is to adhere to the
practice in all constitutional colonies by which the
salary of the governor is fixed. It can be altered by
parliament, as has been done in Victoria, in the proper
way, provided by the constitution. As my hon. colleague,
Mr. Munro, has said, it was fixed at £lO,OOO a year,
and £5,000 a year for allowances. But the salary
could not be altered except in the way provided by the
constitution. That is the case not only with the salary
of the governor, but with the salaries of other high
officials, such as the judges. That is a rational pro-
ceeding. This course is not proposed because there is
any fear or doubt as to the honor or uprightness of the
federal parliament. It is only proposed because it is
desirable in the public interest that every person who
is called upon to occupy a very high position in the
state should know what his salary and emoluments
are. If it is found desirable afterwards in the public
interest to reduce or increase that salary it can be done
by the legislature; but it must be done in the way
provided by the constitution. If we pass the clause
including the words which prevent the salary from
being altered so long as the gentleman who' first fills
it occupies the position, but leaving it open to the
parliament to resolve that the salary shall be reduced
immediately he ceases to hold that position, I venture
to think that what the hon. member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, has indicated might happen. There might be
a gentleman extremely anxious to be popular, or who
might honestly believe that the salary could be reduced
without disadvantage, and he might take steps to
reduce the salary forthwith. Why should we not leave
this question to be dealt with by the federal parlia-
ment, but make it necessary to cany out the alteration
in the same way as other important alterations in the
constitution have to be made 1 Why should we leave
it to a chance vote of the legislature to decide this
question 1 I believe that it would be a mistake to do
so—not because I have any fear of the federal parlia-
ment, but because I think we should adhere to the
practice hitherto followed in constitutional colonies.
If it is desired to alter this provision, let it be altered
in the same way as other fundamental provisions of
the constitution are altered.
Mr. KINGSTON; I understand that the contention
of the hon. member, Mr. Gillies, is this : that if in
future there is a desire to alter the salary of the
governor-general it should be passed in the mode
prescribed in the last part of the bill—that is, a
convention should be called to consider the question,
and there should be no power whatever to give effect
to the desire of the federal parliament, unless by a
reference to conventions of the various states its action
was approved. I utterly fail to see the necessity for
the course suggested. I am in sympathy with the
amendment proposed by the hon. member, Sir John
Bray, to give power to the federal parliament to deal
with this matter as fi’om time to time they may think
fit. In the fii’st instance, the amount has to be fixed
some how or other, and I have no objection to the
amount now proposed, and it is also rendered impos-
sible to alter the salary which is payable to a governor-
general during his tenure of office. Something has
been said with regard to the practice that obtains in
other colonies with reference to the alteration of
salaries of this description. So far as Canada is
concerned, it appears to me that section 105 of the
British North America Act gives to the Canadian
Parliament the power to do what is proposed by the
hon, member, Sir John Bray. The provision is :
Unless altered by the Parliament of Canada, the salary of
the Governor-General shall be £IO,COO sterling.
Dr. Cockburn : And they did alter it—they
reduced it!


Mr. KINGSTON : With regard to Canada, hon.
members who have referred to the practice of other
colonies will finj from the passage I have quoted that
they are not consistent in their contention. Similarly,
with reference to our own little colony, no doubt we
have a provision that certain clauses in our Constitution
Act cannot be altered unless the bills for the alteration
are assented to by specified majorities. So far as
South Australia is concerned, this restriction of the
powers of the legislature only applies to alterations in
the constitution of the two houses, and we have the
fullest power by any act of Parliament—subject, of
course, to the royal veto—to deal with this question
of the salary payable to the Governor in such manner
as we think fit. It appears to me that the precedents
referred to support the contention of the hon. member,
Sir John Bray. Why, then, should we proceed to tie
the hands of the federal parliament and prevent them
from dealing with this question as they may think fit 1 ?
I am not going to take exception to the amount of
salary proposed. I have listened with a great deal of
interest to the arguments which have been advanced
on the subject of the position of the governor-general,
and a late division in this Committee proves that
a very large majority of the Convention are impressed
with the idea so eloquently urged by various delegates,
that the position of governor-general is utterly unfit
for, and unworthy of acceptance by, every citizen of
the Australian commonwealth. Under these circum-
stances there is reasonable ground for doubting whether
ornot we are not erring on the side of excessive liberality
in fixing the amount to be paid to the first occupant
of the office at £lO,OOO per annum. There is no fair
ground, either in precedent or point of principle, for
insisting on the necessity of tying the hands of the
federal parliament in fixing the salary to be paid to
the governor-general. There are much more important
questions with respect to which they have a free hand.
It is inconsistent to give them the fullest power to deal
with those important questions while we refuse to do
so with regard to this question of the salary of the
governor-general. Subject to the qualifications that
the amount in the first instance shall be specified, and
that it shall not be altered during the continuance in
office of any governor-general, I shall do my utmost to
give the fullest power to the federal parliament to
deal from time to time with the salary.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I would call the
attention of the hon. member, Mr. Kingston, to this
consideration—does he or does he not intend to make
the Queen a permanent part of this parliament 1
Does he intend that the commonwealth of Australia
is to be presided over by the Queen 1 If he does, 1
ask, does he intend to provide that distinctly by the
constitution, and does he wish it to be a real con-
nection, or that it may, by a passing whim of the
parliament, be made merely a nominal one 1 This
guarantee of £lO,OOO a year is the only thing reserved
to the Queen under this constitution. We say that
the Queen is part of the parliament, that she is the
head of the commonwealth. We wish her to exercise
this function in the commonwealth ; but we leave it
entirely to the parliament to say whether we shall
give her any allowance for doing so. I maintain
that that is wrong in principle. If the Queen is to be
part of the parliament, and to exercise authority in
the commonwealth, we must have a deputy, and we
are bound to say that we intend to make provision
for the payment of his salary. That must be part of
the constitution, otherwise there need be no salary,
and the governor-general may be a mere shadow.
Mr. KINGSTON : I decline to recognise the con-
nection between Australia and the mother country as
resting on such a slender thread as the payment or
non-payment of a sum of £lO,OOO as the salary of a
governor-general; and I say, with all respect to the
hon. and learned member, that it is unfair to put the
position in a contrary light. The maintenance of the
connection with the mother country was not in the
slightest degree endangered by the provision which
we find in the Constitution of Canada.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Yes !
‘ Mr. KINGSTON : I have quoted the clause.
Sir Samuel Griffith : I believe they tried to
reduce the salary, and the act was disallowed !
Mr. KINGSTON : The connection was not in the
slightest degree endangered by the insertion in the
Canadian Constitution of the provision which we seek
to have embodied in this bill. Sir John Bray’s
amendment seeks to give effect to the same principle,
and the power reserved to her Majesty to assent or
withhold her assent to Canadian acts, will apply
equally to acts passed by the federal parliament of
Australia.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Has the hon. member con-
sidered what a serious thing that is—disallowance ?
Mr. KINGSTON : No doubt it is a serious thing,
and it would be a serious thing if the federal parlia-
ment were likely to disregard the obligation to provide
a suitable sum for the gentleman selected for the office
of govei’nor-general. But I say we have no right to
consider it probable that they would disregard that
obligation. We have had no experience which will
warrant such a supposition. We have no experience
to warrant the suggestion that they will lightly dis-
regard the obligations imposed on them. We have
had power in our colony to make any regulations on
the subject which we might think fit, and I am sure
that the discretion observed in that colony, as in other
places where similar laws prevail, will be sufficient to
rebut the suggestion that the power is likely to be
abused by a legislature which should be trusted with it.

Question so resolved in the affirmative.
Amendment (by Sir George Grey) negatived :
That in line 3 the word “ six” be substituted for the word
“ten,”
Amendment (by Mr. Barton) agreed to :
That in line 3 the words “ the same ” be omitted.
Amendment (by Mr. Deakin) proposed :
That in line 6 the word “altered” be substituted for the
word “diminished.”
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I am under the im-
pression that the first federal parliament will think
£lO,OOO too small a salary for the governor-general,
especially if Victoria continues to pay its governor
£lO,OOO, But Ido not see that we should interfere
in this matter, since it is strictly the business of the
federal parliament. It is the business of the Queen,
and of the whole of the colonies before they come
into the federation to see that the Queen shall be paid
a sufficient sum to enable her to be represented in the
commonwealth ; but I do not see that we should
prevent the federal parliament from increasing the
amount if they think proper.


Mr. DEAKIN : We say, “During his term of office.”
There will be nothing to prevent the federal parliament
from raising the salary of the next governor, though,
if it is improper to reduce the salary of the governor
during his tenure of office it is equally improper to
increase it.
Sir JOHN BRAY ; We have left a very important
question still unsettled, and that is, what is to be the
salary of the first governor general 1 The clause says
that it is not to be less than £lO,OOO, though it
implies that it may be more. Ido not know why we
should not intrust the federal parliament with the
power of increasing the salary, if it thinks proper.
Why should we say that it must not be raised or
diminished 1
Mr. Gillies : It will be contradictory '
Mr. Deakin : The clause is imperfect, not contra-
dictory !
Sir JOHN BE AY : We say it may be more ; but,
at the same time, we say it shall not be altered. I
suggested that we should fix the salary of the first
governor-general at £lO,OOO until the federal parlia-
ment alter it.
Mr. Deakin : That is the proper thing to do !
Sir JOHN BRAY : But I am willing now to leave
it to the federal parliament, and I object to the
amendment proposed by the hon. member, Mr.
Deakin.
Mr. Deakin : We have got the word “ diminished ”
already !
Sir JOHN BRAY: That is to prevent any injustice
to the governor-general; but surely we can intrust the
federal parliament with the power of increasing the
salary. Let us leave a little to their discretion, and
give them a little power, instead of tying up their
hands in the way proposed.
Mr. Gillies : I should like to ask for a ruling
upon the subject. We have decided to retain the
words “ not less than,” and I should like to ask you,
Mr. Chairman, if an amendment can be moved which
would be contradictory to these words 1
Mr. Deakin : It is not contradictory in any sense.
The one is a negative limitation, and the other simply
refers to the salary when fixed. I confess that the
clause is quite imperfect; but it is certainly not
contradictory to say that though the salary cannot be
reduced it shall not be altered during the governor’s
term of office.
The Chairman : The amendment is quite in order.
Amendment negatived.
Mr. Hackett: I observe that the last line and a
half is a virtual adoption of part of a clause in the
American Constitution; but the President there is
practically never absent from the seat of government.
This clause, however, would allow the governor-general
to draw his full salary during the year’s leave of
absence; and I would point out that that leave of
absence rests with the authorities in Downing street.
The clause, therefore, would allow the Colonial Office
to arrange that the governor-general should draw his
full salary during a year’s absence, when an adminis-
trator would have to be appointed in his place, who
would have to be paid a large salary for doing the
work. Who would pay him 1
An Hon. Member : The governor-general !
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
Clause 6 (Governor-general to fix times and places for hold-
ing sessions of parliament —Power of dissolution of house of
representatives—First session of Parliament}.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I wish to call the
attention of the Committee to a point raised by some
hon. members as to whether six months is long enough
to enable provision to be made by the different local
parliaments for the representation of their respective
colonies in the federal parliament.
Clause agreed to.
Clause 8. The privileges, immunities, and powers, to he
held, enjoyed, and exercised by the senate and by the house of
representatives respectively, and by the members thereof, shall
be such as are from time to time declared by the parliament,
and until such definition shall be those held, enjoyed, and
exercised by the Commons House of Parliament of the United
Kingdom and the members thereof at the date of the establish-
ment of the commonwealth.
Mr. AD YE DOUGLAS : I suggest that in the first
line of this clause the word “powers” should be
omitted. Nobody intends, I presume, that the powers
of the House of Commons shall be vested in the
senate or house of representatives.
Mr. Deakin : Not in the senate !
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS: Nor in the house of
representatives. Nobody knows what the powers of
the House of Commons are; but we know what its
privileges are. I beg to move as an amendment:
That the word “ and ” be inserted between the words
“ privileges ” and “ immunities ” with the view of afterwards
striking out the words “and powers.”
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I would point out that
this is a phrase which has been used in so many con-
stitutions that it has come to have a regular recognised
meaning. At the same time, this is not dealing with
the powers of parliament, but with the powers of the
houses of parliament. One of the most important of
those powers is, I presume, to keep order, and to
summon persons before the house, and to give evidence
before select committees, and that is not a power
which falls within the word “ immunities”; nor does it,
I think, fall within the word “privileges.” “Author-
ities” might do if the word “powers” is thought to be
too large.
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS : It is well understood that
the powers of the House of Commons are just what
they choose to declare them to be. There is nothing
fixed nor definite ; and a parliament such as ours ought
not to have power to declare what its powers are, and
to extend those powers as the House of Commons
may do.
Mr. BAKER : As the hon, member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, says, these are well known words. No doubt
they are; but we are establishing a different form of
government altogether. We are establishing a form
of government in which the federal parliament shall
have certain specified powers, and the states parlia-
ments shall have certain specified powers, and I con-
fess that this word “powers” puzzled me when I first
read it. I understood the intention to be as stated by
Sir Samuel Griffith, but I do not think it is at all clear.
-The word “ powers” should either be left out altogether
or the word “ authorities” substituted. There should
be something to show that it is not intended, as would
appear from the clause as at present worded, to give
to the senate and the house of representatives power
to declare that they can do anything they like.
Mr. Deakin : Drop out the “ senate,” then it will be
all right!
Mr. BAKER : Perhaps the house of representatives
might be dropped out too ; that would be the best way,
and let the clause read “ the members thereof. ” Ido
not think the wording of the clause is satisfactory,
although I agree with its intention.
Mr. WRIXON : It seems to me that it would be
better if we followed in tins case the formula adopted
in more than one of our constitution acts, and defined
the privileges, immunities, and powers by saying they
shall not exceed those enjoyed by the Commons House
of Parliament. Then you have a limit; you know
what you are doing, and you define the extent of the
powers and privileges which you are conferring.
Mr. Deakin : Why should we tie our own hands!
Mr. WRIXON : I think it would be unwise to
leave it perfectly open to the federal parliament to
claim anything and call it a privilege. Ample privilege
is.now vested in the House of Commons for every
legislative purpose, and I think that this would meet
the view of the hon. member who raised the point.


Mr. AD YE DOUGLAS: No, it does not. You
have now simply the rules of the House of Commons
as defined up to the pi-esent time; but the House of
Commons could to-morrow declare its present powers
extended in any way it wished, and by the clause as
now worded we would give to the fcdei’al parliament
all the powers of the House of Commons, and surely
that is not the intention.
Mr. Deakin : Yes !
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS ; I see no objection to
giving the federal parliament all the powers of the
House of Commons as defined up to the present time;
but this clause would give to the parliament all the
powers of the House of Commons at any time.
Mr, Wrixon : It would give to the parliament
anything they liked to claim !
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS: There is no legislative
limit to the powers of the House of Commons. They
may extend them as they please from time to time. I
think it would be sufficient if we gave to the federal
parliament only the privileges and immunities of the
House of Commons.
Sir JOHN DOWNER : I confess that I had grave
doubts as to whether or not we ought to give to either
the senate or the house of representatives unlimited
authority with respect to what they might be pleased
to consider their privileges, immunities, and powers,
and if I knew of any intelligent way of limiting the
powers of the federal parliament, I should be glad to
limit the powers of both houses. But after consider-
ation, I have come to the same conclusion as that
arrived at by some members of the committee, namely,
that if we limit the authority of the federal parliament
ultimately to the analogy of the House of Commons, we
shall have the greatest difficulty in finding out what
that limitation really is. I think it would be as well
to let the clause stand as it is, and trust to the good
sense of the commonwealth as sufficient to guide us,
without adopting an analogy with reference to the
House of Commons which we do not understand, and
cannot define.
Amendment negatived,
Mr, ADYE DOUGLAS : There appears to be a
clerical mistake in the fifth line of the clause. In-
stead of the words “ until such definition,” I think
it should read “ until so declared.”
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : The hon. member is
correct; the word “ definition ”is a mistake. The
word originally used in the same line was “ defined,”
but it was altered to “ declared.”
Amendment (by Sir Samuel Griffith) agreed to:
That the words “ such definition ” he omitted with the
view of inserting in lieu thereof the word “ declared.”
Mr. BAKER: I may state that this clause is
copied almost verbatim from the British North
America Act. An act was passed—3B and 39
Victoria —repealing that section which wo are now
going to adopt, and which act says :
And whereas doubts have arisen with regard to the power
of defining by an act 5f the Parliament of Canada, in pursu-
ance of the said section, the said privileges, powers, or
immunities ; and it is expedient to remove such doubts, be it
therefore enacted
It then goes on to say what the clause really meant.
As there were doubts about this clause, and it was
necessary to pass an imperial act to remove them,
eurely it is not wise for us to adopt it.
Mr. Deakin : Read the amendment!
Mr. BAKER : First of all they repeal that clause,
and then they say :
The privileges, immunities, and powers to be held, enjoyed,
and exercised by the senate, and by the House of Commons,
and by the members thereof respectively, shall be such as are
from time to time defined by act of the Parliament of Canada;
but so that the same shall never exceed those at the passing
of this act held, enjoyed, and exercised by the Commons House
of Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireland, and by the members thereof.
Mr, Deakin : That is no better !
Mr. BAKER : I do not know the reasons which
actuated the Imperial Parliament in repealing this
clause which we are now seeking to adopt, and in
inserting the other, but there must have been some
reasons. I believe this act was passed at the sugges-
tion of the Canadian Parliament.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I think there is no
difference in the point raised from the one raised a
few moments ago. The Parliament of Canada never
had power to take any more privileges than were
enjoyed by the British House of Commons in March,
1867, and they did not know how to go to work in
1875 subject to that condition.
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
Part ll.—The Senate.
Clause 9. The senate shall be composed of eight members
for each state, directly chosen by the houses of the parliament
of the several states during a session thereof, and each
senator shall have one vote.
The term for which a senator is chosen shall be six years.
Mr. WRIXON : With regard to this clause, I wish
to say that I will not propose that it be postponed,
because that would lead to inconvenience with regard
to other clauses; but I would observe that, when we
come to determine the position and powers of the
senate, if there should be a majority in the Chamber
to give the senate large powers—certainly any larger
than are now contained in the bill—we must go back
upon the clause and reconsider it; because it will
never do to give equal representation to the smallest,
as well as to the largest states, if the senate is to be a
large and determined power in the constitution. In
passing the clause now without challenge, I wish to
observe that we leave it open to go back to it after we
have settled the constitution of the senate.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I have an amend-
ment to propose in the clause. There is no mode of
returning the names of the senators as chosen by the
governor-general. Certainly a provision of that kind
must be inserted.
Mr, MUNRO : I should like to know if the Con-
vention have fully considered the proposals made in
this clause, first, with regard to the number of senators,
and, second, with regard to the term for which they
are to be elected. A number of our friends are con-
tinually telling us to look back to the grand Constitution
of the United States; but we find that in the United
States they have only two senators for each state. At
the time the Constitution was framed there were only
thirteen states, and two senators for each state, or
twenty-six senators altogether. Now, we propose to
have eight senators for each of the seven states to start
with, amounting to fifty-six senators. I consider that
that number is too large, and that we ought to reduce
it. I think at the outside that six senators for each
state would be quite sufficient. They ought also, in
my judgment, to be elected at times different from
those proposed in the latter portion of the clause. I
think it is too long to leave a period of three years
between each appointment or election, or six years
altogether. In the event of any difficulty arising
there ought to be power to make the appointments at
least every second year. In order to test the question
I move :
That the word “ eight,” line 1, be omitted with a view to
inserting the word “six.”
Mr. CLARK: The hon. member, Mr. Munro,
appears to object to the number “eight,” because
he thinks the senate will be too large a body.
He also says that we calculate on having seven
states to commence with, which will give fifty-six
senators. Although we all hope that we shall have
seven states to commence with, we have to face the
difficulty that we may have only six or only five to
commence with. If we only have five states to
commence with a senate of forty members will not be
too large a body. Another matter which we must
remember is that the number of states in the common


wealth of Australia will never be anything like the
number of states in America. The conditions are
altogether so different that, I think, altogether it is
generally considered very unsafe to prophesy, we may
rest assured there will never be more than about a
dozen states in the commonwealth of Australia. We
may, however, have such a population in the whole
commonwealth as will ultimately raise the number of
representatives in the house of representatives to the
number in the House of Representatives in America.
It may so happen that we may have 300 members in
the house of representatives, and if we should have
anything like that number the senate should bear its
proportion.
Mr. Deakin : Hear, hear. It is easy enough to
increase !
Mr. CLARK : It is easy enough to increase, but
we shall have to increase by an amendment of the
constitution, and I think it is a very bad thing to
tinker with a constitution to meet contingencies as
they arise. I think the constitution ought never to
be amended, excepting upon the discovery of some
radical defect which experience has proved to exist,
or to provide for some totally unforeseen contingency.
If you can possibly provide for probable contingencies,
provide for them at once, and do not devise a
constitution with the deliberate intention, or with the
certainty in the natural evolution of events, that it
will require amendment. I should like to point out
to the representatives of the smaller states—and I
represent a small state myself—that we may only
have four or five representatives in the house of
representatives. Take the colony of Tasmania, or the
colony of Western Australia. If we have only four
representatives in the house of representatives and
eight representatives in the senate, it will only be a
total representation of twelve members, and surely
that is not too large for either of those colonies. I
say deliberately that twelve members are not at all
too many to represent Tasmania in the commonwealth.
If Western Australia is to be entitled to four members
in the house of representatives, twelve members will
not be at all too many to represent that colony. On
that ground alone I would ask hon, members to con-
sider seriously before they cut down the representation.
Mr. BARTON ; If there is any force in the objec-
tion that there might be a large number of states, and
therefore too large a senate in the course of time—
though I do not think there is anything in the
objection—that could be provided for, not by diminish-
ing the number, eight, now proposed, but by making
other provision in case the states should reach a
certain number. If, for instance, we were to have
twelve states—and I think it will be a long time
before we do—it might possibly be worth considering
whether we should not have only six members in the
senate for each state; but probably we shall begin
with five states, and not have more than six or seven
states for a number of years, and surely we shall not
consider that forty members in the senate will be too
many, seeing that the house of representatives will
jegin with 115 or 116 members.
Mr. HACKETT : If all the states of the continent
send members to the senate there will be 48 members,
and if the present proportion, the present unit of
election, is retained at 30,000 for the house of repre-
sentatives, by the time this constitution comes into
force its membership will rise to as many as 120.
That will make altogether 168 members in the senate
and house of representatives. Owing to superior in-
ducements to natural ambition, and also of a more
material character, it is quite certain that a large num-
ber of the best men in the states will gravitate to-
wards the federal capital, and it is provided by section
10 of chapter vof this constitution that no member
either of the senate or of the house of representatives
shall occupy a seat in the local legislature.
Mr. Clark : That is not decided yet!
Mr. HACKETT : If that is carried, it means that
there will be 168 of our best men taken away from
the states for service in the central legislature. That
is a very serious consideration for the states.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : If the number is eight,
it cannot be divided by three. lam disposed to think
that it would be a good thing, sir, for you now to leave
the chair and report progress. This is a matter that
we ought not to go into when we are tired, and a
great many hon. members are tired. After four
hours’ continuous application, they have a right to
be tired.
Mr, Deakin : Wo are going on to-night!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Whether we are or
not, I do not know.
Mr. Deakin : Certainly !
Mr. MUNRO : I intended to move that we should
meet in the evening after dinner, but on consulting
hon. members I found that the majority were in favour
of sitting each day until about half-past 6, but not
later, and for that reason I did not press the matter.
If hon. members are inclined to adjourn to-day at
6 o’clock I do not object.
Sir John Downer : Go on till half-past!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : This one of the most
important clauses in the whole bill, and I do not think
it is fair to begin a discussion on such a clause at
this hour.
Progress reported.

The term for which a senator is chosen shall be six years.

Mr. KINGSTON : I move ;
That the words “directly chosen by the houses of the
parliament of the several states during a session thereof,” be
omitted.
My object in moving the amendment is to introduce
an amendment into clause 10 which would give the
legislatures of the states an opportunity of deciding
this matter for themselves and adopting such system
as may commend itself to their judgment. It seems
to me that a matter which affects solely the repre-
sentation of a state in the senate might well be
left to the state legislature. This point cropped up
in a discussion which took place in the Federal
Council, when the expediency of uniformity was urged
by some members ; but the conclusion which was then
arrived at, and which appears to me at the present
moment to be unexceptionable, was that the federation
were not concerned as to the mode in which the states
selected their representatives as long as the people of
the state were satisfied as to the system adopted, and
the chief object of the system of representation was
gained. And it was felt that it would be an unnecessary


interference with state autonomy to prescribe a hard
and fast rule, which could not be altered except by
means of an alteration of the constitution of the
federation. Of course there is something to be said
in favour of the adoption of a uniform system ; at the
same time it appears to me that there is a great deal
more to be said in favour of allowing the question to
be settled by the deliberate vote of the state legislatures
representing the people. I do not think we would be
justified in adopting the clause as it is, seeing that the
effect of it is to deprive the people of a direct vote in
the choice of their representatives. No doubt there
is a great deal to be said in favour of the system which
is suggested here, particularly on the score of unifor-
mity to which I have already referred. But I would
point out that it does not establish a uniform system
exactly, because when it is provided that the two houses
of the parliament of each state shall select the senators,
we must not lose sight of the fact that the houses of
parliament in different colonies are differently consti-
tuted, and that whilst in some colonies both houses
are elected, in other cases the upper house is purely
nominative, and thereby a vote is given in some
colonies to members who owe their position to the
voice of the people, whilst in the other cases no such
attributes can be claimed in respect of at least one
branch of the legislature. I think that if we were to
decide upon the necessity of prescribing a fixed regu-
lation of the subject, the better course would be to
give the power of election to the people themselves,
of course voting, probably for the whole of the colony,
in a larger constituency than those which are pre-
scribed in connection with the election of members of
the house of representatives. But under all the cir-
cumstances, seeing that uniformity, which is the object
of clause 9, cannot be attained by the means sought,
seeing moreover that uniformity is of less importance
than the giving of satisfaction to the people of the
different states, I propose, therefore, to omit the
words, “ directly chosen by the houses of parliament
of the several states during a session thereof,” with a
view to the subsequent amendment of clause 10 in
the direction of giving each state legislature an oppor-
tunity to decide the question for itself in such manner
as it thinks best. I do not see why we should inter-
fere between the people of the different states and the
exercise of their free choice in the matter of these
appointments.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH ; This matter was very
fully considered by the Constitutional Committee, and,
if I remember rightly, was discussed pretty fully in
the Convention beforehand. Briefly stated, the reasons
which prevailed with the majority of the committee
were these : that it is very important that the senate
of the commonwealth should be in direct touch
with the parliaments of the several states. It has
been found in the United States that the election of
members to the state parliaments may often be deter-
mined by the views held by the candidates as to the
proper persons to be elected to the Senate. Again,
unless the course proposed were taken the senators
would not necessarily be representing the same kind
of constituency at all. For instance, in one state
they might represent the property-holders of the state,
and in another state universal suffrage, and one man
one vcte. The senators ought to be a homogeneous
body, and it was thought that the best way to indicate
that would be to say that they should be directly
chosen by the members of the houses of parliament—
as houses of parliament and not as the legislature.
Mr. Deakin : Separately or conjointly?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: That we leave to
them to settle. But it was thought best to allow the
parliament of the commonwealth to adopt a uniform
mode if it thought fit.
Mr. DEAKIN : There is one point which, I fancy,
was not insisted upon with sufficient force in the
argument of the hon. member, Mr. Kingston. The
colonies are not represented by upper houses of the
same stamp—that is to say, three of them have nominee
upper houses, and even in those colonies which have
elective upper houses, there are restrictive or property
qualifications. Under this proposition you are prepared
to endow members of nominee houses with power
equivalent to that of members of elective houses, and
you are endowing members elected by a limited fran-
chise with equal power so far as their numbers go to
that exercised by the popular branch of the legislature.
A proposition infinitely more acceptable than that
would be that the government should nominate the
senators and be responsible for their nomination.
Mr. Kingston : That might be prescribed by the
state parliament!
Sir Samuel Griffith : And the government might
be turned out of office the next day !
Mr. DEAKIN : Parliament would have it in its
power to take precautions to prevent an accident of
that kind, and even if it did occur, it would be, to my
mind, an infinitely better method, notwithstanding all
its objections, to that proposed in this clause. The
proposition as it stands is not without many advan-
tages. Much might be urged in favour of it if this
were the time to urge it. But it has this disadvantage,
that it interferes with the liberty of the several colo-
nies to select the method they believe the best, and
that it endows members of nominee houses, and mem-
bers of houses elected by a restrictive franchise, with
equal authority, so far as numbers go, with that of
members of houses elected on a popular basis. If
objection be taken to nominations by the government
on account of the possibility of their leaving office,
that is at once met by intrusting the election of mem-
bers of the senate to the popular branch, or to the two
chambers, if both be elected by the whole people.
That would bring the senate into line with the
American Senate, because in the United States the
same body of electors returning the houses of repre-
sentatives return the senates in the several states.
There can be no objection in principle to that proposal.
The Convention would do well to lay down that prin-
ciple—to provide either that the senate shall be elected
by the popular branch of the legislature alone, or by
the two chambers, where they are elected upon the
same franchise.
Dr. COCKBURN : Perhaps the best way would
be to have the senators elected directly by the people,
because the judgment of the people as a whole is
better than the judgment of any section. But that is
going too far. I therefore support the amendment of
the hon. member, Mr. Kingston. In addition to the
difficulty of nominee houses, there is also another diffi-
culty arising out of the election of senators by the
houses of legislature in America. The election of
senators is a matter of great importance, and in the
absence of distinct party lines—of course it is not a
certainty that that would be the case here, still such a
state of things may develop —the election of particular
persons as senators may become a matter of great im-
portance to the state, and the result would be that if
shortly after the election of the local legislature an
election of senators were imminent the question of
election to the local legislature might turn, as it does
in America, upon the persons for whom the candidates
would vote as senators if returned to the local house
of parliament. Therefore you get local matters mixed
up with the personal question of who is to be a
senator, and that is a distinct disadvantage. If our
local legislatures are to perform in the future the im-
portant functions they have performed in the past,
their members should be elected upon the question of
measures rather than upon the question of men ; and
I can conceive that if in future the senators were
elected by the local legislatures the whole question as
to what persons should be returned to the local legisla-
tures may turn upon the pledges given by them as to
their votes for senators. This is a disturbing element,


and I think the best thing we can do will be to give
power to each state to elect senators as their experience
may prove best.
Mr. WRIXON: I fail to follow the force of the
objections urged by the hon. member. If a state
chooses to have a nominee house for the purposes of
all legislation, it should also be allowed to have a
nominee house for this purpose. It is for the state to
say whether it likes a nominee house or not. We do
not interfere with that, and if it has a nominee house
for all purposes of general legislation, why should it
not have a nominee house for this particular purpose 1
Mr. KINGSTON : If it is for the state itself to say
whether it shall have a nominee house or not, surely
we may give to it the privilege of determining the
mode in which it will elect representatives to the
senate. I think, therefore, that the hon. member’s
argument supports my contention. Various systems
have been suggested for the election of senators by the
different states. It has been thought by one hon.
member that the best plan would be to allow them to
be nominated by the government of the day; and
another suggestion, with which I have considerable
sympathy, is that there might be an election by the
whole colony voting as one constituency. The
solution of the difficulty, however, seems to be rather
in the direction of the amendment I now move, namely,
that each state shall, from time to time, settle the
question. Something was said on a previous occasion
as to the impropriety of restricting a somewhat similar
matter by a resolution of this Convention to be
embodied in the imperial bill. Does it not strike hon,
members that there is room for considerable difference
of opinion as to what is the best course ; and why,
under these circumstances, should we deny to the
various states power to decide the question for them-
selves in such a shape as may seem to them best ?
The sole argument used against it has reference to
uniformity. We do not obtain uniformity in the
clause before us. Why, then, should we reject the
amendment which gives to each colony an opportunity
of solving the problem as regards the mode of election
of senators 1 What have the other colonies to do with
the question so long as the state is satisfied 1 If we
carry this clause the result will be that although future
experience may prove to us that a different plan might
be adopted, and one state might be particularly desirous
of adopting that plan, still no effect could be given to
its wish except by an amendment of the constitution,
involving the passing of certain laws by specified
majorities and appeals to conventions of all the states
on a question in which only one state might have a
particular interest. We have had it urged at various
times that we should not interfere unnecessarily with
the self-governing capacities of the different states.
Surely in this matter, simply referring to the mode in
which they should elect their senators, they ought to
have the opportunity of exercising their powers to the
very fullest extent in such manner as they think best.
It is with that object only that I propose the amend-
ment.
Mr. MUNRO : When I first read the amendment
I did not agree with it; but after looking carefully at
the Ist and 2nd clauses I think the amendment is a
proper one, because it leaves to each state the power of
making its own arrangements for electing its senators.
Why should we dictate to the states on that subject ?
There is no provision made in the clause of the bill as
to the mode in which the houses of parliament are to
carry out the election. The Ist clause says :
The senate shall be composed of eight members for each
state, directly chosen by the houses of the parliament of the
several states during a session thereof, and each senator shall
have one vote.
That does not provide how it is to be done. The next
clause says :
The parliament of the commonwealth may make laws
prescribing a uniform manner of choosing the senators.
Subject to any such law the parliament of each state may
determine the time, place, and manner of choosing the senators
for that state by the houses of parliament thereof.
Surely that is sufficient if we strike out the words the
hon. member, Mr. Kingston, desires to strike out.
The 2nd clause makes provision for the first election,
and then afterwards the parliament of each state can
make its own arrangements.
Sir John Downer : How could we get the first
senate 1
Mr. MUNRO : By an addition to the Ist clause,
after striking out the lines proposed, that the local
parliaments of the various states shall make provision
for the first election.
Mr. PLAYFORD : This is a point on which we
can consult the experience of America, where exactly
the same clause has worked for 100 years, I have
never learned that they desire to alter their mode of
electing senators. It is a great deal better that we
should say distinctly that the parliaments of the
colonies should elect the senate in the way they have
said it in America, than that we should leave it to
the different states to decide the manner and mode of
elections. • If the states decided the question we
might have a considerable amount of difference in the
mode. We know that the American system has given
eminent satisfaction; but we have no means of know-
ing whether the system proposed by the hon. member,
Mr. Kingston, would give equal satisfaction. If the
hon. member wishes to carry out his idea, certainly
he should not strike out the words he proposes to omit,
for this reason : you must provide some mode of
election of the senators so as to give the different states
an opportunity of deciding how they will elect them,
because through some obstinate lower or upper house
in some of the states a deadlock might occur, and
they might not be able to decide in time for an
election on any particular lines. Consequently there
would be no persons chosen to represent the state.
The hon. member would, therefore, do better to leave
the words as they are, fixing this mode “ until the
states otherwise direct.” I would very much like to
give the states the power to decide as to the manner
and mode of electing senators if I thought it would be
productive of good results; but with the experience of
the United States before us I do not think we can do
better than to adopt their form of election.
Mr. FITZGERALD: I quite agree with the
remarks which have been made by the hon. member,
Mr. Playford. Our chief consideration should be
which method is likely to give to the senate the very
best men that each colony can send. I apprehend
that this clause does not limit the choice of the states
to the members of their parliaments. They can go
outside for the best men ; and, undoubtedly, if they
feel the importance of the senate to this new common-
wealth, they will seek the very best men, wherever
they are to be found. We can credit the various
parliaments with that patriotic feeling. Undoubtedly,
if you take the power of choice from the parliaments
and give it to the people you have no security of the
same value as to choice of the best men. If the
senators were appointed by a popular vote, that vote
would have to be given either by the colony as a whole
or by subdivisions. Does the hon. member, Mr.
Kingston, consider that the very best men in any of
the colonies would subject themselves to the worry of
a canvass over such an enormous areal With the
election of senators by the colony as a whole you could
not have the same confidence in their choice as you
would in the choice of a parliament. 1 do not say that
the choice of the people would not be valuable. But
for the particular function which the senate has to
discharge in the constitution, there would be much
more security in having the senators chosen by the
representatives of the people than there would be by
the adoption of any other course. It is not because
I think that the people would make a bad choice, but


because I think the parliaments would make a better
one, that I shall vote for the clause as it stands.
Mr. GILLIES: It strikes me that some of the
hon. members who are supporting the motion of
the hon. member, Mr. Kingston, have for a moment
forgotten the object of establishing two houses in
this constitution. The house of representatives will
be elected directly by the people in the various
states; the senate is intended to be a house not directly
elected by the people of the various states, but elected
indirectly by those people. Some hon. members, per-
haps, may entertain the idea that it would be a wise
thing to have the two houses elected on exactly the
same basis. I very much doubt that, so far as our
experience goes. I more than doubt it. The frequency
of the chances of collision would be much more likely
to be numerous than very few. The house of repre-
sentatives, directly elected by the people in the various
states, having granted to it great powers, especially in
the direction in which a popular house of parliament
is most powerful, and being looked upon by the
general community as truly representing the whole
community, not merely a part of it, we must not forget
that it will be very powerful indeed. I do wonder
that gentlemen who have been speaking of state rights
should be among those who advocate leaving it to the
various states to determine whether we should not
have two houses exactly similarly representing the
people. I venture to say that that would be extremely
unwise. Here we have endeavoured as nearly as pos-
sible not only to have a house of representatives repre-
senting the whole of the people,but also a second branch
representing the legislature of each colony. I do not
know whether my learned friend here would like to say,
in the election of members to the senate by any state,
that that should be done by plebiscite, or that the whole
of that state should be converted into one electorate for
the purpose of returning the whole of the members to
represent it. What might result 1 You might have a
state with a constituency of 250,000 electors represent-
ing the whole of the people, and the whole of the mem-
bers of the senate might have to be returned by one
electorate, and they might be able to return the whole
of the representatives by a majority of a few dozen
or a few thousands. . Will any one tell me that that
would be a true representation of the people in the
senate, a true representation of the whole people]
Why, it might bo a representation by a simple majority
of only one interest and one section. I say that no
community could live under such a representation as
that. There would arise from one end of the colony
to the other a howl of indignation at the idea of one
section only being represented, whilst an enormous
minority would not have a single representative. All
the great colonies, as far as the popular assemblies are
concerned, are naturally divided into districts. Why ]
Because it is the desire of the people as a whole to see
that every class of the population in their respective
districts are fairly represented. By that means you
secure the most true representation of the people as a
whole that you can get, instead of having the whole
of the colony as one single electorate returning the
whole of the members to the federal parliament. This
would be perfectly possible under the system which
my hon. friend proposes. He says it should be left to
each state to say how it proposes to return its repre-
sentatives. The original idea was that we were to
have two branches of the legislature, not to be elected
exactly from the same source—the people to elect the
house of representatives, and the parliament to elect
the other, representing, as they do now, substantially
the people as a whole. I concur with my hon. and
learned colleague, Mr. Wrixon, that, after all, we
have nothing to say as to how any one branch of
the legislature of the colony is elected. That is
their business. They have deliberately chosen in
some cases to be content with houses of assembly
elected from the people, and a second house, the
legislative council, in some cases elected by the people,
in other cases nominated. If the people of the colony
are content with having a nominated upper house,
that is their business and not ours, so that to use that
as an argument against allowing the two houses of
any state to jointly, or in any such way as they may
determine, elect members of the senate appears alto-
gether unsound. Ido trust hon. members who have,
I may say, suddenly started this view, because it was
not seriously advocated in the Constitutional Com-
mittee, will take to heart what the hon. member, Mr.
Playford, said. It is not an unlikely thing that if it
was determined by population instead of by the legis-
lature that it should be a plebiscite that a whole
colony should be formed into one constituency, the
second branch of the legislature would never consent.
I say we should be proposing in this case to create
difficulties which are wholly unnecessary. If any one
said that we should not get a true representation of
the opinion of the people in any colony by allowing
parliament to elect members of the senate as they
think proper, I think they are in error. I believe
that if the legislature in each of the states were per-
mitted to select their representatives in the senate,
their selection would fall upon gentlemen who, as a
whole, would satisfy the people. I think that the
proper thing to do is to allow the second branch of
the federal parliament to be elected on a different
basis and under different circumstances from those
under which the members of the popular branch are
elected. I venture to say we shall make a mistake if
we attempt by any means to elect an upper house of
parliament or senate on almost exactly the same basis
as the popular branch. The two are intended to exer-
cise different functions—functions in some respects,
not in all, equal. And I desire to see maintained, not
only in the federal parliament, but also in all the states
on the continent, the principle that the two houses of
parliament shall not be chosen from exactly the same
individuals, but each on some different basis.
Mr, KINGSTON : In regard to the mode in which
the amendment is introduced, it is my desire to meet
the wishes of those delegates who are chiefly respon-
sible for the framing of the bill. I have moved to
amend clause 9, and propose, if the House affirms its
desire to strike out the words in question, to amend
clause 10 so as to provide for a certain system to be
adopted until the legislature of any state provides
otherwise. As to the remarks of the hon. member,
Mr. Gillies, as to the merits of indirect election, I
confess that I do not recognise the system of indirect
election as having any particular virtue. What I
understand we are endeavouring to do is to provide
for the creation of two houses of the federal parlia-
ment, in one of which the people at large will be
represented, and in the other the state interests shall
be particularly conserved. And it seems to me that
under these circumstances, as long as the state itself is
satisfied as to the mode in which the custodians of its
interests are appointed, we have no reason to inter-
fere, and further, as to the reference made by my hon.
colleague to the system which obtains, and has obtained
for a considerable period, in the United States, I think
he somewhat overlooked the fact that the system of
uniformity that was adopted has been subjected to
very considerable criticism ; that there is by no means
that unanimity of sentiment on the expediency of
maintaining it which his remarks would suggest. In
this connection, I would like to refer to a note which
occurs in Bryce.” It is as follows :
A proposal recently made to amend the federal constitution
by taking the election of senators away from the legislatures
in order to vest it in the people of each state is approved by
some judicious publicists who think that bad candidates will
have less chance with the party at large and the people than
they now have in bodies apt to be controlled by a knot of
party managers. A nomination made for a popular election
will at least be made publicly, whereas now a nomination for
an election by a legislature may be made secretly.


Giving the fullest force to the arguments which have
been advanced in favour of the system which is pre-
scribed in the bill, it seems to me that they simply
amount to this : that at the present there is a strong
feeling in favour of the system which is suggested, and
it is unlikely that it will be altered ; it is probable
rather that it will give satisfaction to all the states.
That seems to me to amount to this : that even if we
give power to the states to provide a different mode of
election, they will not exercise it. But is that any
reason why we should prevent them if they should hit
upon a better plan of giving effect to their wishes in
such a manner as would be most expedient 1 It seems
to me that the argument does not warrant the further
conclusion which is suggested, and I trust that the
decision of the Committee will be to give the states
the fullest power to deal with the question as they
think fit. No doubt, in the first instance, it will be
necessary to lay down and provide for a system of
election which shall be uniform. It is highly probable
that a system of the character which we now find
contained within the four corners of the bill will
commend itself to the majority of the states ; but if
that be so, it simply points to the improbability of the
power of alteration being exercised by each state. It
certainly does not warrant the contention that no
power should be given to the state to alter the system
by which it elects its senators, however strongly it
may feel on the subject.
Sir GEORGE GREY : I desire to state that I feel
quite convinced-that the proposal made by the hon.
delegate, Mr. Kingston, is one that recommends
itself for our adoption. His proposal is simply this :
that the states themselves shall have the power of
deciding the manner in which the election of senators
shall be made. All the suppositions that have been
made that we should not give this power because it
might be wrongly used, and all the suppositions made
that it is desirable to give it because it would be wisely
exercised, ought not to influence us. What we do is
not to prescribe any one mode of choice, but to leave
to the states themselves the power of deciding how the
elections shall be conducted. I shall certainly support
that, and for an additional reason, that I am convinced
that the great danger in these elections is that the
power may fall almost entirely into the hands of
capital. I think in the bill, as- it stands, we are in
some instances absolutely legislating to obtain that
end. I think that must be the case where there are
nominated upper houses, which there will be great
difficulty indeed of getting rid of, because a nominated
upper house is not likely to destroy itself. The exist-
ence of a nominated upper house is no proof, as it has
been argued, that the people are contented with it.
Personally I am absolutely discontented with a nomi-
nated upper house, and I have for years struggled in
vain to see it put an end to j and I believe that that
is the case with a very large number of persons in the
whole of Australasia, I shall, therefore, certainly
support the proposal of the hon. member, Mr, Kingston,
which I think is perfectly justified, giving as it does
full liberty to the people of each state to determine from
time to time, as they think tit, the manner in which
the senators shall be chosen.
Sir HENRY PARKES : The hon. and distin-
guished delegate who has just sat down spoke under a
misapprehension, into which I fear other hon. members
have fallen. He distinctly stated that he desired to
leave to each state the manner of electing its delegates.
So do we all, and that is distinctly provided in the
bill; but what the motion of the hon. delegate, Mr,
Kingston, says is quite a different thing. He is not
dissatisfied with the provision made in the bill for the
manner in which each state is to elect its members j
but he does a thing which I think was never proposed
before—he leaves to each state the power to create the
constituency. Now, in every constitution act that I
ever heard of the constituency is created by the act
itself. This bill does that; but it leaves the manner
of the exercising of the rights of that constituency
entirely to the states. It follows as a logical sequence,
I think, that if you leave the creation of the con-
stituency in regard to the senate to the states, you
must also leave the creation of the constituency in
regard to the assembly to the states. I cannot sec
why you should leave the states to create one of these
constituencies unless you go and leave it to them to
create the other constituency also. The hon. member
would divest the bill of all intimation as to what the
constituency* of the senate should be, and the states
would severally have to create their own constituen-
cies. lam entirely in favour of leaving to the states
the fullest possible liberty in saying how they will
elect their delegates; but that- is quite a different
thing from leaving them to create the constituency
from which those delegates are to be elected. Ido
not know whether it is worth while to say a word in
reference to this argument against nominee houses.
Nominee houses exist, and as they exist for all the
high purposes of legislation—they have never existed
with my consent or vote—surely they may exist for
the purpose of electing members for the senate of
federated Australia. The incapacity of nominee,
chambers to elect members of the senate when they
are given full power to make all laws whatever hardly
admits of argument. For my part lam satisfied with
the clause, though it does not exactly represent my
own wishes.
Mr. KINGSTON : I do not wish to trespass upon
the time of the Committee, except for the argument
advanced by the hon. delegate who has just sat down.
He argued that if it is in the power of the legislature
of a state to create the constituency for one house, it
ought also to have the power to create the constitu-
ency for the other. Now, clause 25 gives this power
to the legislature of the state as far as the house of
representatives is concerned. It gives it a power to
define the qualifications of the electors, which certainly
amounts to the creation of the constituencies.
Sir Henry Parkes : Certainly not !
Mr. KINGSTON : It certainly appears to me that,
under the circumstances, the argument of the hon.
gentleman tells in favour of the proposition I have
advocated.

Amendment so resolved in the affirmative.
Amendment (by Sir Samuel Griffith) proposed ;
That line 5 he omitted with a view to the insertion of
the words ‘ ‘ The senators shall he chosen for a term of six
years. The names of the senators chosen in each state shall
be certified by the governor to the governor-general. ”
Sir JOHN BRAY : I should like to ask the lion,
gentleman Avhether he thinks the latter portion of the
amendment is necessary 1
Sir Samuel Griffith : I do really !


Sir JOHN BRAY: It seems to me to be unneces-
sary. Is provision made for the absence of a governor
for any length of time 1
Sir Samuel Griffith : Yes; provision for his
deputy to act is contained in the bill !
Sir JOHN BRAY: If the hon. gentleman under-
takes to provide for it I am satisfied.
Amendment agreed to ; clause, as amended, agreed
to.
Clause 10. The parliament of the commonwealth may make
laws prescribing a uniform manner of choosing the senators.
Subject to any such law the parliament of each state may
determine the time, place, and manner of choosing the senators
for that state by the houses of parliament thereof.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : My hon. and learned
friend, Mr. Barton, has made a suggestion, which, I
think, is of great value—that is, to omit the words,
“the parliament of the commonwealth,” whereever
they occur in the bill, and to put in “ the common-
wealth,” because, as he points out, the parliament is
only the instrument by which the commonwealth
makes the law r s. If the suggestion does not commend
itself to hon. gentlemen generally I will say nothing
further about it. An hon. member, I think Sir John
Downer, yesterday suggested that the expression
“ subject to any such law ” might be misunderstood,
and might be taken to indicate that there must be a
law of that kind. I think that the words are suffi-
cient ; but they are not quite clear, and it would be
better, therefore, to say “ subject to such laws, if any.”
There could be no possible doubt then as to what is
meant. I think that any doubt that arises and is
pointed out ought to be met at once. This instru-
ment ought to be perfectly free from ambiguity. I
therefore move:
That the words “ any such law,” line 3, be omitted with a
view to insert in lieu thereof the words “such laws, if any.”
Amendment agreed to; clause, as amended, agreed
to.
Mr. DEAKIN: I trust that the members of the
Convention will take a little time to consider the pro-
posal which has emanated from the hon. and learned
member, Mr. Barton, which appears to me a most
excellent one, both as regards abbreviation, for which
it offers another opportunity
The Chairman : The clause is passed.
Mr. DEAKIN: I hope the question will be raised
again and considered.
The Chairman : We can recommit the bill.
Clause 12. As soon as practicable after the senate is
assembled in consequence of the first election the senators
chosen for each state shall be divided by lot into two classes.
The places of the senators of the first class shall be vacated at
the expiration of the third year, and the places of those of
the second class at the expiration of the sixth year, from the
commencement of their term of service as herein declared, so
that one-half may be chosen every third year. The term of
service of a senator shall begin on and be reckoned from the
first day of January next succeeding the day of his election,
except in the case of the first election, when it shall be
reckoned from the first day of January preceding the day of
his election. The election of senators to fill the places of
retiring senators shall be made in the year preceding the day
on which the retiring senators are to retire.
Colonel SMITH : I should like to call the attention
of the hon. and learned member, Sir Samuel Griffith,
to the word “ class.” I think that the word “ section”
would be better.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I remember that yes-
terday an hon. gentleman suggested to me that the
words “ in consequence of the first election” are
awkward. They were used so as to avoid a repetition
of the word “ after.” There is, of course, a difference
between the American Constitution and this in that
respect. In America they were assembled “ in con-
sequence of the first election” ; here they would be
assembled in consequence of the governor-general’s
proclamation calling them together; and that is a
difference. We inserted those words after very careful
consideration ; but, nevertheless, objections have been
urged since which I think are worthy of consideration.
Mr. BAKER: I suggested that it would be better
to insert the word “ first” after the word “ is,” so as to
make the clause read, “ As soon as practicable after
the senate is first assembled.” I move :
That the clause be amended by inserting the word “first”
after the word “ is,” line 1.
Sir Samuel Griffith : That is right ; that is the
best amendment!
Amendment agreed to.
Amendment (by Mr. Baker) agreed to :
That the clause be further amended by omitting the words,
“ in consequence of the first election, line 2.
Colonel SMITH : I think that the clause should
be further amended by omitting the word “ classes,”
line 3, and inserting the word “ sections.”
Mr. Fitzgerald : I suggest to the hon. member the
substitution of the word “ groups.”
Mr. Playford : “ Classes” is the word used in the
American Constitution.
The Chairman : Hoes the hon. member, Colonel
Smith, move the amendment 1
Colonel SMITH : Ho, I will not press that; but
the clause says:
The term of service of a senator shall begin on and be
reckoned from the first day of January next succeeding.
A man might be elected in June, and for six months
really not be a member. I would Suggest that the
words “ the first day of January next succeeding” be
struck out. The clause goes on to say :
Except in the case of the first election, when it shall be
reckoned from the first day of January preceding the day of
his election.
He might be elected in December, and might have the
£5OO in the beginning of January. I think we should
make both date from the day of his election. I think
that the clause should read, “ The term of service of a
senator shall begin on and be reckoned from the day
of his election,” and that we should strike out the
words “the first day of January next succeeding,”
otherwise he might be put back six months.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : On consideration the
hon. gentleman will, I think, see that the clause is
properly framed. The intention is that each senator
shall hold office for a term of three years, and that
term must be the same three years. It is intended
that half the senate shall be periodically renewed at
intervals of three years. The parliaments of the dif-
ferent states meet at different times; some meet in
June, some early in the year, and New South Wales
at various times—sometimes in February, often in
November. The election of the senators must be
during a session of parliament. Well, then, if there
is to be a uniform time for renewal, it must clearly bo
some time after the sessions commence. Then you
guarantee that every parliament will have sat, and had
an opportunity to elect senators to take the seats of
persons who retire on a fixed day. That is the only
way to secure uniformity of time of retirement and
certainty that the men will be there. They will be
elected in advance in fact. But if you applied that
rule to the first senators they would sit for four
sessions ; because, when the constitution is brought
into operation there must be a session of parliament
in each state immediately afterwards in order to
provide constituencies and fix the mode of electing
senators, and during that session the houses of par-
liament will elect their senators. That would be
immediately followed by the first session of the parlia-
ment of the commonwealth. The senators will sit
during that session of parliament, which will almost
certainly be in the same year, and they will sit during
the two following sessions; so that though they will
not be in office for three calendar years they will be in


office for three sessions of the parliament. That is
how we worked it out, and I think it will come out
all right.
Sir JOHN BRAY : What the hon. gentleman has
said is quite right so far as the purposes of this section
are concerned as regards reckoning the time of retire-
ment. But in another part of the bill it is provided
that the senators are to be paid for their services, and
the question arises, does the term of service of a senator
for the purposes of payment begin from the date of his
election, from the date when he is sworn in, or from
the first day of January 1
Hon. Members : On the day when he is sworn in !
Sir Samuel Griffith : Surely when his service
begins !
Sir JOHN BRAY : I think we ought to have that
fixed. It seems to me very undesirable to provide, as
su gg es f e d by Colonel Smith, that although a senator
is elected in June, his term of service and payment
for service shall not begin until the following January.
Mr. Clark : He will not do anything until the
following January !
Sir JOHN BRAY : For the purposes of retirement,
a date should be fixed from which the time should be
reckoned; but for all other purposes a senator ought
to be a senator from the day he is chosen.
Mr. Baker ; How can he be when there is another
man in his place 1
Sir J OHN BRAY: 1 can quite see that for the
purposes of this section the provision as contained in
the clause is right; but, as regards other portions of
the bill, it seems to me that it is not right, and the
question ought to be clearly understood.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : So far as the objection
with regard to payment is concerned, there is a good
deal in it, and the matter should be dealt with now.
The clause only deals with the first senators. After-
wards the term of service begins on the Ist of January,
I suppose a senator can hardly be called a senator until
the Ist of January arrives. He will be a senator-
elect, but he will not be a senator really until that
day. If parliament is in session on the Ist of January,
he will walk in and take his seat, and the other man
will walk out, and his pay, I apprehend, will begin on
the same day. But the hon. member has pointed out
a blot with respect to the first senators, A man might
be elected in December and claim twelve months’ pay,
dating from the previous January. This, I think,
would be remedied by inserting in the second paragraph
the words “ for the purposes of his retirement.”
Mr. WRIXON : The matter will want a little
thinking over, because I apprehend a man is not a
senator unless until he presents himself and takes the
oath.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Why not 1 ?
Mr. WRIXON : He might refuse to take the oath,
and so would be disqualified from the beginning. It
is not until he presents himself and takes the oath that
he is really a senator. He is in potentiality a senator ;
but he is not completely clad in that position until he
appears at the table and takes the oath, and I appre-
hend he is not entitled to payment until that takes
place. I would suggest that it is somewhat hazardous
to make an amendment at the table in a bill of this
kind, which has been carefully considered; and if
these matters are borne in mind, they can be after-
wards dealt with by the draftsman. I would depre-
cate any hurried amendment on the spot, where it may
not be required.
Sir HARRY ATKINSON : The clause states that
the term of service of a senator shall not begin until
the Ist January following the day of his election. If
a vacancy occurs, and a senator is elected in June, he
then becomes a senator ; but, according to this part
of the clause, he cannot become an actual senator until
the following January. Though parliament might be
in session, he would be unable to take his seat. I
would suggest to the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith,
that he should take a note of this point, and consider
it. Ido not think we could make any amendment
here that would meet the case. For the purposes of
this particular clause the provision is right enough ;
but I think there will be a difficulty in regard to
payment, and also as to vacancies occurring.
Sir JOHN BRAY : I quite agree with Sir Samuel
Griffith, that if we are not to overlook this question
entirely it ought to be settled somewhere in this
clause, and if the hon. gentleman sees no strong
objection to such a course I shall move the insertion at
the beginning of the second paragraph of the words
“for the purposes of this section.” It would be
manifestly absurd in regard to the first election of
senators to say that if a man is- elected in September
or October the term of his service shall begin from the
preceding January, and that ho shall be entitled to all
the privileges of a senator from that date. It is quite
possible that this may not be the best amendment
that can ultimately be made, but it seems to me clear
that the second paragraph was drawn with the idea
that it applied to this section only and not to other
portions of the bill. I beg, therefore, to move as an
amendment:
That before the words “ The term of service ” lines 8 and 9,
the words “ For the purposes of this section ” be inserted.
Sir Samuel Griffith : That is quite correct: those
are the right words !
Amendment agreed to.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : In reference to the
point raised by the hon. member, Sir Harry Atkinson,
in regard to vacancies occurring by death, the difficulty
would be met by substituting for the words “retiring
senators ” the words “ senators retiring by rotation.”
Amendment (by Sir Samuel Griffith) proposed :
That the words “retiring senators,”line 14, be omitted with
a view to insert in lieu thereof the words “ senators retiring
by rotation. ”
Mr. MARMION: Is this intended to refer to
senators retiring by rotation throughout, or only in the
first instance ?
Sir Samuel Griffith : Always !
Mr. MARMION : It seems to me that there are
two portions of the bill which may be affected by the
proposed amendment. In the first place, unless it is
distinctly laid down in the bill that a senator, though
elected, does not become a senator until the 1 st of Janu-
ary, there will be during that interval twelve senators
instead of eight; because there will be four who will
not retire for some considerable period after the elec-
tion, There is another view of the case. A senator
may be prevented for a period from holding his seat
in the local house of representatives. When he is
elected to the senate, he cannot sit any longer in the
state house of representatives, and if his election to the
senate takes place some time prior to the end of the
year, unless it is distinctly laid down that the mere
fact of his election does not make him a senator, he
will be obliged to retire from the local house of repre-
sentatives.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: There is no doubt a
little difficulty. In the cases of which we have experi-
ence, members of parliament are elected by a con-
stituency that may be said to be in permanent session.
Here we have to deal with the case of a constituency
which is in session only sometimes. We must, there-
fore, deal specially with it. There cannot be more
than eight senators at a time. There will be eight
senators and four senators elect; for a senator elect is
not a senator until his term begins. There is no reason
why a member of the house of representatives should
not be elected to be a senator in June; next January
he becomes a senator and ceases to be a member of
the house of representatives.
Amendment agreed to ; clause, as amended, agreed
to.


Clause 13. If the place of a senator becomes vacant during
the recess of the parliament of the state which he represented,
the governor of the state, by and with the advice of the
executive council thereof, may appoint a senator to fill such
vacancy until the next session of the parliament of the state,
when the houses of parliament shall choose a senator to fill
the vacancy.
Mr. FITZGERALD: I think the Convention should
give a little consideration to this clause. It appears
to me that it would be far better to leave the vacancy
open until the parliament of the state resumed than to
give the governor of the state power to make an appoint-
ment which might not afterwards be ratified by the
parliament. That would be a very humiliating position
to put a gentleman in who had been a senator for
perhaps two or three months.
Mr. Playford : It is only “ may ” appoint!
Mr. FITZGERALD ; It is a “may ” on which in
most cases the governor-in-council will act, and un-
doubtedly without adding to the dignity of the senate,
and possibly to the great humiliation of the occupant
of the office. Seeing that each colony will have eight
senators, I cannot see how the efficiency of the senate
will be at all interfered with because there happens
to be one vacancy, or even two, any more than it would
if there were one or two absentees. I certainly think
it would redound more to the dignity of the senate
that a vacancy should continue until the parliament of
the state resumed. I do not intend to move any
amendment, but merely offer the suggestion for the
consideration of hon. members.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH ; The observations of
the hon, member deserve a great deal of consideration ;
but probably, the senate being a small house, one
member of a state may be of great importance.
Mr. Fitzgerald : It cuts both ways, though !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : One vote may be of
very great importance.
Mr. Fitzgerald : To that state !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I am quite sure that
a populous state like Victoria, which has a proportion-
ately small representation in the senate, would not like
important business to be carried in that house by a
majority of perhaps one or two when one or two of
their senators were dead or had retired.
Mr. Fitzgerald : Still less to have important things
done by a nominee in whose choice the parliament had
no voice!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I do not know ; but
I think the Parliament of Victoria, if nominees were
appointed by the executive council, would practically
be represented fairly for that purpose, because an
appointment would only be made if there were some
urgent necessity for the colony having its full repre-
sentation.
Mr, BARTON : I think there is a great deal in
what has been suggested by the hon. member, Mr.
Fitzgerald. The nominee principle is not entering
into the composition of the senate in general, and it
would seem to be rather an unwise thing to mix up
the operation of two principles in this way. It would
be far better to put up with the occasional loss which
might be suffered by the absence of one senator out of
eight than to have a nominee exercising the important
functions intrusted to an elected senator. In order
that the matter may be fairly considered, I move :
That the clause be amended by the omission of the
following words “the governor of the state, by and with
the advice of the executive council thereof, may appoint a
senator to fill such vacancy until the next session of the
parliament of the state, when.”
Sir JOHN BRAY: It seems to me that the
amendment will hardly accomplish the object of my
hon, friend, Mr. Barton. But I do think it is
necessary to have some provision for filling these
vacancies. It seems to me that we ought not to allow
a senator possibly to be appointed by the government
and to have some person chosen in his place imme-
diately afterwards to represent the colony. Under
these circumstances, it is far better, I think, that the
parliament, if necessary, should be immediately called
together to choose a senator, or the matter could be
delayed if the senate is not likely to meet. I object
altogether to the governor appointing a senator to fill
a vacancy. If the amendment be carried it will only
apply to filling a vacancy that occurred during a recess
of parliament, which of course is not what my hon.
and learned friend means. His idea is that if a
vacancy occurs whether parliament is in session or in
recess it should fill the vacancy. Therefore it is
necessary to strike out the words “during the recess
of the parliament.”
Mr, Barton ; They should go out. I omitted to
include them !
Sir JOHN BRAY : If the hon. member will move
the omission of those words I shall support him.
Mr. Barton : I accept the suggestion of my hon.
friend.
Mr. FITZGERALD : I would suggest that it
would be better to alter the clause to read as
follows :
That when the place of a senator becomes vacant during
a session of the parliament of the state which he represented
such vacancy shall continue until the next session of the
parliament of the state.
Mr. DEAKIN : The vacancy would continue if
you do not make any provision for it. Why this
extraordinary alarm and dread of the action of the
executive 1 What is a senator under the constitution
as proposed 1 ? He is to be elected by the two houses
of parliament. And what is the executive ? The
executive is the acting committee of those houses of
parliament which represents, at all events, a majority
in one of them, and usually a majority in both of
them. What more fitting can it be than that the
temporary committee which acts for parliament in
every other matter when it is not sitting, which
takes upon its shoulders enormous responsibilities in
the discharge of its duties out of session, trusting to
parliament to approve of its action—what possible
objection can there be to the committee taking the
responsibility before parliament meets of appointing
a man to fill a temporary vacancy 1 The house has
the power, and the necessary power if it likes, to
afterwards reject the nominee of the government.
Any advantage that the government may gain is
given to its nominee by the fact of his appointment
for a short time, and the claim he might be con-
sidered to have on the consideration of his fellow-
members on that account. That is the only possible
circumstance which can be alleged against the pro-
position. Surely that is a small circumstance. What
other proposition can be made which can equal the
representative character of an appointment by the
permanent executive of parliament, which parliament
can itself speedily reverse if it so please 1 The
opposition is rather curious, coming as it does from
members of governments who enjoy and exercise
many similar prerogatives by the permission and
with the authority of parliament; and surely, if a
ministry cannot be trusted to make temporary
nominations to a house which is to represent its
state temporarily and in emergency, what is a
government competent to do 1
Sir JOHN DOWNER : The clause is no new-
fangled idea of the committee; but they took it from
the most illustrious commonwealth which the world has
known, and adopted it practically verbatim as nearly
as it could be adopted. In the United States of
America a temporary vacancy is filled by the executive
in identically the same way which is proposed to be
followed here, and certainly no country that we have
ever heard of insisted more on the popular voice in the
selection of representatives ; but still they thought on
the other hand it would be far better to have some mode
of election for a little while, which was not quite the


best that they would like, than be for a time abso-
lutely unrepresented. I can see no objection to the
clause.
Mr. GILLIES : Might I make a suggestion to those
who appear to object to the clause 1 I confess Ido not
see any objection, under the circumstances, to leaving
the nomination to the governor-in-council. I would
suggest, however, that the matter is of no importance
if the federal parliament is not in session, and the
chances are that both the local parliaments and the
federal parliament will be in session as nearly as pos-
sible at one and the same time. If the governor-in-
council were only called upon to make an appoint-
ment to enable a representative of a state to be present
when the federal parliament was doing work, we
might at once meet the case by providing that in the
event of the federal parliament being in session and a
vacancy occurring, a nomination might be made by the
governor-in-council,
Mr. BARTON: I would mention that if an
amendment of this kind is to be made, it had better
come in at the end of clause 20, which provides for
the notification of vacancies. In that case, it would
be better to omit this clause altogether. The 20th
clause reads ;
Upon the happening of a vacancy in the senate, the presi-
dent, or if there is no president, or the president is absent
from the commonwealth, the governor-general shall forthwith
notify the same to the governor of the state which the senator
whose place is vacated represented.
And we might add the words :
and the houses of parliament of the state shall in their next
session choose a senator to fill the vacancy.
Amendment negatived; clause, as read, agreed to.
Clause 15. The qualifications of a senator shall be as
follows :
(1.) He must be of the full age of thirty years, and must,
when chosen, be an elector entitled to vote in some
state at the election of members of the house of repre-
sentatives of the commonwealth, and must have been
for five years at the least a resident within the limits
of the commonwealth as existing at the time when he
is chosen;
(2.) He must be either a natural born subject of the Queen,
or a subject of the Queen naturalised by or under a
law of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland, or of the parliament of one of the
said colonies, or of the parliament of the common-
wealth, or of a state.
Mr. MACDONALD-PATERSON : I observe in
this clause an important qualification—namely, that
an aspirant to the position of senator shall have been
for at least five years a resident within the limits of
the commonwealth. As an Australian of something
like thirty years, standing, I feel that this period is too
short. I think most delegates will admit that you
cannot convert a new chum into an Australian, that
you cannot thoroughly tincture him with Australian
sentiment and knowledge within a period of five years.
Our anticipation is that w-e shall have purely Austra-
lian action, sentiment, and knowledge in the federal
parliament, and if hon, members think they will find
all these qualities in an individual who has lived in
Australia only five years, then I much misapprehend
what I have heard during the last thirty years. I
respectfully urge hon. members to think the matter
over, and with a view to bring it to an issue, and to
hear a little discussion on the part of those who ai’e
older than myself, I move :
That the word “five,” line 7, be omitted with a view to
insert in lieu thereof the word “ ten.”
Mr. J. FORREST : I altogether disagree with the
amendment. I think the clause should contain no
qualification of this sort, and that we should trust the
various legislatures to do what is beneficial and right
in the interests of their respective colonies. The
matter would be perfectly secure in the hands of the
legislatures. Is it likely that a legislature would elect
an unfit person—a person having no knowledge what-
ever of the state he represented 1 So far as lam able
to judge, no such contingency is likely to arise. In
the case of members of the house of representatives no
period of residence within the commonwealth is pre-
scribed as a qualification ; and if you can trust the
people to elect fitting persons to the house of repre-
sentatives without such a qualification, I can see no
reason why you should not place equal trust in the
parliaments of the respective colonies. There is another
point. We propose to form a commonwealth of Aus-
tralia, and are we to prohibit people of our own race,
born in other portions of the British dominions, from
becoming senators until they have been resident in
the commonwealth for a certain period 1 No such
prohibition is placed upon Australians residing in the
old country. Any Australian, resident in England,
can at once, if the electors desire', become a member of
the House of Commons, and I see no reason why a
distinguished Englishman coming to these colonies
should not at once be eligible for the position of
senator if the legislature of one of the colonies desired
his appointment. lam entirely opposed to the amend-
ment, and if I had my way I would place no more
restriction' upon the eligibility of senators than we
place upon the eligibility of members of the house of
representatives.
Mr. AD YE DOUGLAS : When the amendment
now before the Committee has been disposed of, I
propose to move the omission of all the words of the
Ist sub-clause after the first word “ commonwealth,”
The Chairman : The hon. member cannot move
such an amendment unless the amendment now before
the Committee be withdrawn.
Mr. MACDONALD-PATERSON: I am willing,
for the purposes of discussion, to withdraw my amend-
ment.
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
Mr. A DYE DOUGLAS : I beg to move :
That the words “ and must have been,” line 6, be omitted.
My object is to leave the option of choosing a senator
on the same ground as it is left in the case of members
of the house of representatives, whose only qualifica-
tion is that they shall be of full age. It has been
admitted by nearly all hon. members that the house
of representatives is to have charge of all financial
business, and therefore it will be the most important
branch of the legislature. Why should a member of
that house be admitted without any restriction, while
you impose this absurd qualification of five years’ resi-
dence 1 I presume it must be continuous residence, so
that if a man leaves the colony for two or three years,
still having property in it, when he returns he will
have to serve a sentence of five years’ residence before
he is eligible. Cannot trust the states legislatures
or the people to choose the senators ? This is a most
absurd restriction, without sense or meaning.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : The question deserves
consideration. Personally, I confess Ido not like the
idea of this qualification. lam inclined to agree with
the hon. member, Mr. J. Forrest, that the legislatures
should be trusted to elect the best men they can find.
What is the object of this restriction 1 To keep out
new chums, I hear an hon. member suggest. Why
not elect new chums if the states wish to have them
as members ? I believe in trusting the states as
much as possible ; surely they are fit to be trusted to
select a man, even if he has only been four and a half
years in the country, if no better man can be found.
Mr. RUTLEDGE : I think there ought to be some
such qualification. The argument used by the hon.
member, Mr. J. Forrest, was that it is wrong for us
to institute a qualification which does not exist in the
case of a person going from Australia to Great Britain.
The circumstances are entirely different. We depend
in Australia, as the American commonwealth has
depended, on immigration. We must have immigra-
tion on a very extensive scale before we can fully
develop our resources, and accomplish all we hope for


as the result of establishing this constitution. We have
all kinds of national ties coming here. There are fairly
good men among all nationalities, but if the clause is
passed without this qualification a man might come
here and, without any knowledge of, or any particular
sympathy with, our institutions, would be eligible as a
member of the senate. I do not think that that is
quite right. I agree with the hon. member, Mr.
Macdonald-Paterson, that a man without a short term
of residence does nob become sufficiently familiar with
the habits of Australians, with our ways of thought
and modes of action ; and we have a particular kind
of feeling in which certain characters who come here
with new ideas find very suitable opportunities for
carrying out their particular projects. We ought not
to allow Australia to be a field for exploitation by
foreign adventurers. To a great extent we welcome
all foreigners, but we ought not to allow persons who
perhaps have made themselves rather objectionable in
the countries where they have lived to come here, and
under the cover of this very liberal provision seek to
give effect to the views which they were not able to
carry into effect elsewhere. We cannot do better
than follow the example of the United States in this
respect, which have provided that a man must be 30
years of age before he is eligible as a senator. That
is very properly copied in this bill. But it is further
provided that a man must be nine years a citizen of
the states before he is eligible as a senator.
Air, J. Forrest : That is with respect to foreigners.
This deals with our own race !
Mr. EUTLEDGE : We shall have to depend to a
great extent upon foreign immigration.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Are Englishmen to be
foreigners to us ?
Mr. EUTLEDGE : I certainly think that we ought
to require some guarantee from foreigners who come
here that they should be qualified for a seat in the
senate,
Mr. MAEMION : The hon. member, Mr. Eutledge,
has alluded to the necessity for immigration from the
outside world to this young country. In adopting the
line of action which that hon. member seemed inclined
to suggest, we should be placing a protective barrier
on immigration of the best character, and we would
say to men from the outside world of talent and
political ability, that they must reside here for a long
period of years before they could hold that position
to which their ability entitled them. Under the con-
stitutions of most of the Australian colonies, a man
cannot become an elector until he has resided in the
colony for six or twelve months. Until he becomes
an elector, he is not eligible as a senator, therefore
some period of residence must elapse before any new-
comer is eligible. As to the danger or fear of foreign
adventurers being selected by the various parliaments
to fill the high position of senators, surely we have
more confidence than that in those parliaments.
Surely we would not give them such large powers,
unless we thought they would be exercised discreetly.
Do we imagine for a moment that they would place
the great powers given to the senators under the act
in the hands of adventurers and strangers 1 Alay we
not be accused of endeavouring to impose a sort of
protection on the introduction of men of genius, talent,
and political ability 1 Alay we not give in exceptional
cases to men of ability those chances that each and all
of us who happen to be natives, or to have resided
many years in Australasia, will have of attaining to
high positions in the federal legislature 1 It would
be by far the best to strike out the words as suggested
by an hon. member, and wipe out what seems to me a
little blot upon this bill, which we are endeavouring
to make as perfect as possible.
Mr. CLAEK : The only valid argument which has
been urged in favour of the amendment is that used
by the hon. member, Mr. Marmion, that we ought to
trust the legislatures. If the Convention is prepared
to accept the application of that principle in its
entirety, I am silenced ; but it is not prepared to do
that. We have already said that there shall be one
qualification, namely, that a man must be 30 years of
age before he is eligible for a seat in the senate. If
we are going to trust the state legislatures absolutely
let us take away that restriction. There are many
men of genius and talent who are under 30 years of
age. We know that one of the most brilliant states-
men England has ever had was prime minister at the
age of 27, and that we may have very brilliant men
25, 26, or 27 years of age, but you will not allow them
to be elected members of the senate. We have already
put a limit to the discretion of the state legislatures,
therefore the hon. member’s argument is gone.
Mr. AIAEAIION : Hardly, because it is generally
considered that age gives stability and steadiness of
character, though it may not always give a greater
amount of wisdom. There may be reasons for impos-
ing a restriction as to age. Therefore, that argument
does not apply.
Sir GEOEGE GEEY : I desire to say that I agree
with the hon. member, Mr. J. Forrest.
Mr. Munro : For the first time in your life !
Sir GEOEGE GEEY : The hon. member who said
that knows very little of our previous meetings. I
think there is very little in the argument that was
used by the last speaker, that, because you provide for
one qualification, you should therefore impose another.
That is, having made one mistake, you should go fur-
ther. However, whether it is a mistake or not, it
would be no argument. You might say that the
qualification which was put in was a good one, and
therefore you must put in another; but you have to
prove it to be good, first of all. I think it is quite a
mistake to put these conditions into the bill. I can-
not imagine what necessity there is for them in this
young country.
Amendment negatived.
Mr. MACDONALD-PATEESON : I hope hon.
members will excuse my not replying to the argu-
ments which have been adduced, as I am suffering
from an affection of the throat. I will content myself
by moving :
That the word “five,” line 7, be omitted with the view to
insert in lieu thereof the word “ seven.”
After consulting with several hon. delegates I have
come to the conclusion that the substitution of the
word “ seven” will meet the case.
Captain EUSSELL; I hold that five years is
decidedly a long time. We should have some evidence
that a man is a bond Jide Australian before allowing
him to become a senator ; but we ought not to fix such
a long period of residence in Australia as seven years
to make him eligible. I suggest that the word “ three”
be substituted for the word “ five.”
Sir GEOEGE GEEY : I propose what I think will
be a fair test, I understand hon. members to require
that a person shall have a fair knowledge of Aus-
tralian affairs before he is eligible for election to the
senate. Well, then, constitute a board before which
all immigrants can be examined. Then you will not
act unjustly to those who have that knowledge. I
shall propose what I have suggested as an amendment.
Sir JOHN BEAY : I would point out that we
have already a board appointed to ascertain whether a
man has been three or five years in the country before
he is eligible by his having been a member of one of
the state legislatures. A man ought to have some
experience in the country before he is appointed a
senator.
Mr. BAETON : I intend to vote for the omission
of the word “ five,” because I think five years too long
a period. I think that it ought to be reduced to three
years. If a legislature cannot find out in three years
whether a man is fit to be trusted they will never find
it out.


Mr. LOTOH : As far as I am concerned, I shall
have very much pleasure in voting for the clause as
it stands. We have had a lot of argument about
foreigners and strangers, or people who may have
lived in Australia only a few years, not being eligible
for election to the senate. If this privilege is denied
them, because they have been in the colony only a
year or two, what other courses are open to them 1
The parliaments of the states are open to them, and
the house of representatives is open to them when
they have been in the colony a very short time. In
my opinion we want as senators men who have some
practical knowledge of Australia. Let them gain that
practical knowledge if they desire to enter either the
state parliaments or the senate of the federal parlia-
ment. Ido not think that five years is too long a
term during which a man should be in Australia
before he is eligible for election as a member of the
senate.
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
Amendment (by Mr. J. Forrest) negatived :
That the word “five” be omitted with the view to insert
in lieu thereof the word “ three.”
Mr. CUTHBERT : I wish to suggest that at the
end of the clause the words “ for the space of five
years ’ be added. Under the different constitutions
which have been recognised a foreigner does not stand
in the same position as a British subject, even though
he take out letters of naturalisation, and I think it
would be very desirable if the same principle were
recognised in the federal constitution, namely, that a
man is not, because he takes out letters of naturali-
sation to-day, entitled to sit in the senate to-morrow.
I venture to submit for the consideration of hon.
members the desirability of making some limitation
such as I suggest, namely, that for a period of five
years after taking out letters of naturalisation a
foreigner should not be entitled to a seat in the
senate. This restriction is carried to a much greater
extent in the Victorian Constitution, because a
foreigner is not allowed to sit in the Legislative Coun-
cil there until ten years have elapsed since he took
out letters of naturalisation, and inasmuch as it is
provided that a person must be “ either a natural born
subject of the Queen,” or a subject of the Queen
naturalised by law, who has resided in the common-
wealth for five years, and who is 30 years of age,
before he is eligible for election as a senator, I think
we should make this limitation with regard to
naturalised subjects. I believe that the hon, member
in charge of the bill will see that the proposal is not
an unreasonable one, and I hope he will see his way
clear to accept it.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I think there is a
great deal in the suggestion of the hon. gentleman,
and that it ought to be adopted. I therefore move :
That at the end of the clause the following words be added :
—“at least five years before he is chosen.”
Mr. Cuthbert : I accept that!
Amendment agreed to.
Mr. WRIGHT : May I ask the reason of the
words, “orof a state,” at the end of the clause 1 It
appears to me that they are not necessary.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : They have been in-
serted because, although it is proposed to give the
federal parliament power to legislate on this subject,
yet, as an interval may elapse before that power is
exercised, the states may continue to amend their
laws with regard to naturalisation, and the clause pro-
vides that naturalisation under their laws shall be
equivalent to a law passed before the establishment of
the commonwealth.
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
Clause 16. The senate shall, at its first meeting and before
proceeding to the despatch of any other business, choose a
senator to be the president of the senate ; and as often as the
office of president becomes vacant the senate shall choose
another senator to be the president; and the president shall
preside at all meetings of the senate ; and the choice of the
president shall be made known to the governor-general by a
deputation of the senate.
Ihe president may be removed from office by a vote of the
senate. He may resign his office ; and upon his ceasing to be
a senator his office shall become vacant.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : The hon. member, Sir
Harry Atkinson, has pointed out to me an inaccuracy
in this clause. It occurs in the fourth line, in the
words, “ shall choose another senator to be president.”
The retiring president may cease to be a member of
the senate during a recess, and be re-elected before
the next session ; but these words might indicate that
he could not be re-elected.. I propose to make the
clause read, “ shall again choose a senator to be the
president,” and I therefore movo,:
That in line 4, after the word “shall,” the word “ again ”
be inserted.
Amendment agreed to.
Amendment (by Sir Samuel Griffith) agreed to :
That in line 5, the word “another ” be omitted with a view
to the insertion in lieu thereof of the word “a.”
Mr. Loton : How is the president to resign his
office 1
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I do not know of any
instance in which that is expressly provided. The
manner in which I have known the resignation of a
speaker to be communicated to the house is by letter
informing the clerk. In this case the president would
be appointed by the house.
Mr. Loton : In most of the colonial legislatures the
president of the upper house sends his resignation to
the governor !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : That is because he is
appointed by the governor.
Sir JOHH BRAY : I should like to ask what is
the necessity for saying that
the choice of the president shall be made known to the
governor-general by a deputation of the senate ?
I know that it is the practice upon his election to office
for the speaker of the assembly, accompanied by such
members as care to go with him, to go to Government
House to acquaint the governor that he has been
chosen speaker; but this looks a more formal affair.
Is this deputation to be specially appointed, or is the
president to say that he is going to the governor-
general, and request hon. members to accompany him ?
The words, “ by a deputation of the senate,” make it
appear that a formal deputation will have to be
appointed for the express purpose of informing the
governor-general of the election of the president. I,
therefore, move :
That in lines 7 and 8 the words “by a deputation of the
senate ” be struck out
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : The intention of the
committee in using those words was to crystallise the
existing practice. The practice in the colonies varies.
In the houses of some of the colonies a deputation is
appointed • in others the whole body go, or as many
as please. I apprehend that the manner in which
practical effect will be given to this clause will be by
the house directing that the choice of the president be
made known to the governor-general by the president,
with so many members as may think fit to accompany
him.
Sir John" Bray : Take out the word “ deputation ”!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Ho. If you leave it
by the senate, it must be done by written communi-
cation, because the senate can only act by means of
some written document. Another point which I have
omitted to mention is, that it occurred to the com-
mittee that it would be more respectful to the governor-
general to make the choice known by members of the
senate attending personally upon him.
Amendment negatived ; clause agreed to.


Clause 19 (Disqualification of senator by absence).
Colonel SMITH : I desire to ask why it is necessary
that leave of absence shall be entered on the journals
of the parliament? I think that is superfluous.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : It was thought by
the committee that there should be a formal record of
leave of absence. It is a serious matter. It might
be said, “ The senate unanimously agreed that a
member should be allowed to be away ; they all took
it for granted.” Those matters, however, ought not
to be taken for granted.
Clause agreed to.
Clause 22 (Quorum of senate).
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I think it right to
call attention to the condition that the presence of
one-third of the whole number of senators shall be
necessary to form a quorum. I believe, in most con-
stitutions, excepting those of Great Britain—in
which term I include those of the British possessions
—the rule is that a majority of the members of the
house shall be necessary to be present in order to con-
stitute a quorum. There is a great deal to be said
in favour of that view ; but the committee, after
carefully considering the matter, thought it would bo
safe, in the meantime, to say that one-third of the
number of senators should form a quorum.
Clause agreed to.
Clause 23 (Voting in senate).
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I desire to say a word
upon this clause. It will be observed that we have
not used the expression, “ The president shall in all
cases have a vote.” It was thought that, in many
cases, he might not wish to vote ; and if it had been
stated that he should have a vole, it might have been
taken to mean that he was bound to vote in every
division, and this might not be desirable. If we only
gave him a casting vote, a question might be carried
to which he was opposed, and in which his state took
a great interest, because there might be a majority of
one without his vote. In that case his state would be
deprived of its due influence. Therefore, we have
drafted the clause in its present form. He may vote
against a question, and when there is a tie the question
passes in the negative.
Clause agreed to.
Part lll. — The. Home of Representatives.
Clause 24. The house of representatives shall be composed
of members chosen every three years by the people of the
several states, according to their respective numbers ; and
until the parliament of the commonwealth otherwise provides,
each state shall have one representative for every thirty thou-
sand of its people.
Provided that in the case of any of the existing colonies of
New South Wales, New Zealand, Queensland, Tasmania,
Victoria, and Western Australia, and the province of South
Australia, until the number of the people is such as to entitle
the state to four representatives, it shall have four representa-
tives.
Mr, BAKER : Before this clause is decided I should
like to ask the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith,
whether the attention of the committee was carefully
directed to the provisions of the Constitution of Canada
in reference to this matter ? The committee has copied
the provisions of the American Constitution, and they
have still further copied the provisions of the American
Constitution in clause 30, where they say :
The number of members of the house of representatives may
be from time to time increased or diminished by the parlia-
ment of the commonwealth, but so that the proportionate
representation of the several states, according to the number
of their people
I think it will be found that that cannot be worked
out. Where you have a certain number of people
entitled to a representation, you can never have pro-
portionate representation, because in the states there
will always be a fraction over, sometimes more and
sometimes less. That has been found to be the case
in America, and great difficulties have arisen in that
country in working out this problem. As a matter of
fact, it is stated by all the writers on the subject that
there never has been proportinate representation
according to the number of the people in the respective
states. The matter may not be a very important one
now, when there is one representative for 30,000
people ; but supposing that, by-and-by, as we all hope
and believe will be the case, the inhabitants of the
states increase largely in number, and we only give to
each 150,000 people one representative. In that case
the fraction which is unrepresented may be very great
indeed. It seems to me that they have adopted a very
much better provision in Canada, a provision which is
self-acting, and which has another great advantage,
namely, that it has a tendency to curtail a too great
number of representatives. They have, for instance,
fixed that one of the provinces—Quebec —shall be
entitled to a specified number of representatives, and
that all the other provinces shall be entitled to the
same proportion of representatives as their population
bears to that of Quebec.
Mr. Clark : That will not get rid of fractions !
Mr. BAKER : It does to a far greater extent than
does the American Constitution, and it is self-acting,
and it does not call for the interference of the federal
parliament from time to time to alter the number of
people who are entitled to a representative. Ido not
desire to move an amendment, but I wish to ask the hon.
member, Sir Samuel Griffith, whether the committee
carefully considered the two systems, and what are
the reasons why they have adopted the American
system ?
Mr. Playford : Because we could not get a good
basis !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : The answer is that no
state in Australia at the present time corresponds to
the position which was occupied by the province of
Quebec at the time of the establishment of the
Canadian Constitution. Quebec was a thoroughly
well settled state, in which the population scarcely
increased at all, excepting by the natural increase of
births over deaths. There is no state in Australia
which you may say is in that entirely settled condition.
Supposing we had taken, for instance, the state of
Victoria, which, being the smallest and the most
densely populated so far as its area is concerned, may
be said to be the most settled state. It is quite likely
that Victoria may increase very largely. If you gave
a fixed number of members to Victoria the result
would be to reduce the number of members of any
other state which did not increase so fast. If you can
find a state which you are quite sure will increase
most slowly you might adopt that principle; but
whilst the matter is quite uncertain you would run
the great risk of reducing the number of representa-
tives for different states, which, I think, would be
very unfortunate.
Clause agreed to.
Clause 25. The qualification of electors of members of the
house of representatives shall be in each state that which is
prescribed by the law of the state as the qualification for
electors of the more numerous house of the parliament of
the state.
Mr. DEAKIN : Do I understand that it is pro-
posed to add to the powers of the federal parliament
a provision enabling them to fix the qualification
dealing with this question? The hon. and learned
member, Mr. Clark, alluded to this question. At
present the qualification of electors is left absolutely
at the disposal of the different states, without any
power of obtaining uniformity through the federal
parliament, even if the federal parliament so desired.
It is not necessary to interfere with the states in any
way ; but it would be as well to endow the federal
parliament witli authority, if so inclined, to adopt a
uniform qualification for voters for the house of
representatives.


Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH; The hon. gentleman
says that it is not proposed to interfere with the
powers of the state, but he suggests that we should
give power to the federal parliament to do it.
Mr. Bearin' : No ; to fix this qualification !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH ; That is interfering
with the power of the states.
Mr, Deakin ; Certainly not!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : It is a questien as to
which system should be adopted. The committee
have adopted the American system, knowing that
they were a democratic people, who did not fear to let
the states fix their own electoral qualifications ; in
fact, we have adopted their words, “ the qualification
for electors of the more numerous house of the
parliament of the state.” I know there is a good
deal to be said on either side. lam not now con-
tending for either view. lam only answering the
hon. gentleman’s question. We did consider the
matter. The provision is clearly necessary at starting;
and we thought that on the whole it would be safer
to let the parliaments of the states continue to deal
with the question for themselves. It would be very
inconvenient, for instance, if the electors for the
house of representatives were a different constituency
from the electors for the houses of the states. It
would mean two sets of revision courts and two sets
of electoral rolls.
Mr. Deakin : I quite agree; but we ought to give
them the power!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH; It is a question
whether it should be done now or by an amendment
of the constitution. The matter was considered, and
I indicate now, as briefly as I can, the reason.
Dr. COCKBURN : I think there are some matters
which ought to be left to the states. On the other
hand, there are certain definite lines regarding vital
principles which should be laid down as part of the
constitution. Therefore I move :
That the clause be amended by adding the words, “ but no
property qualification shall be necessary for electors of the
said house, and each elector shall have a vote only for one
electoral district.”
I think this follows what we have already passed in
clause 24, where it is laid down that the house of repre-
sentatives is to be chosen by the people of the several
states. I imagine that “the people of the several states”
means without any restriction as to class interests.
Mr. Munro : Or as to sex !
Dr. COCKBURN : I do not think it is well to
raise the question of sex at present; but I do think
that, although the question of woman suffrage has not
got far enough to be seriously debated in this Con-
vention, the question of manhood suffrage has got far
enough, and should, as a vital principle, be embodied
in this, constitution : otherwise we might have a
diversity, one roll obtaining in one state and another
in another state. In one state the will of the people
might be supreme, and in another you might have a
property qualification. I think that it is already
recognised as one of the canons of the constitution, and
need not be argued ; and therefore I have moved that
the principle of manhood suffrage, and also the principle
of one man one vote, be embodied in the constitution,
Mr. MARMION : It seems to me that there is a
certain amount of absurdity about this proposition, if
the hon. member will pardon my making that observa-
tion, for it will be far easier and better to say at
once, and in one clause, that the qualification of
electors of the house shall be so-and-so—that is to say,
that they shall only exercise their right under man-
hood suffrage. That would settle the whole question,
and would be virtually interfering with the right of
the several states by saying that in cases where the
states have not manhood suffrage, they must have it
whether they like it or not.
An Hon. Member ; No !
Mr. MARMION : The hon. gentleman says “No,”
but I should like him to explain. I understand him
to mean that. If he does not, I should like to know
what he does mean. Would it not be an absurdity
again, if, in choosing members of the lesser house, they
were to adopt a conservative principle, and in choosing
members of the greater house, they were to adopt a
more liberal one I The two things could not run
together in one country. The hon. gentleman must
see that at once, and if the hon. gentleman wishes to
put the matter to a practical test, it would be better
to say that the house shall be elected in a certain man-
ner, and that would settle the question once and for
all. Throughout the whole of the discussion the idea
has prevailed that the rights of individual states should
be preserved with regard to their constitution.
Dr. Cockburn ; Except on any vital principle !
Mr. MARMION: Surely this a vital principle in
the election of the bodies politic.
Dr. Cockburn : That is their look out; this is the
look out for all the colonies !
Mr. MARMION ; Perhaps it is ; but if you inter-
fere in the one case you might interfere in all. At
the present time in the majority of the states of Aus-
tralia manhood suffrage is the rule. However, one
man one vote is not the rule throughout Australia,
but only in one state at the present time; and why
should the other states of Australia, because one state
now adopts that principle, be compelled within the four
corners of this bill to adopt it 1 I think the suggestion
is far too radical a one for this assembly to carry out.
Dr. Cockburn : Not too radical for Australia !
Mr. MUNRO : I confess, first of all, that I cannot
agree with the hon, and learned member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, that it will not be necessary to have a separate
roll and registration for these elections. There must
be, for this reason : that you have not in any colony
right through the same principle as is proposed here.
We only propose to give the electors one representa-
tive for every 30,000 people, and there is not one
colony where the representatives number more than
one to every 10,000 or 15,000 persons.
Mr. Playford : We could group the districts !
Mr. MUNRO : If you do that you must have a
special roll for each.
Mr. Playford : No; use the rolls of two or three
districts !
Mr. MUNRO ; The hon. member knows that when
you prepare a roll you say it is the electoral roll or the
ratepayers’ roll for a certain electoral district, giving
its title. If you group three districts together you
must have a different title, and say that it must be the
electoral district of so-and-so. You must use the roll
as you mix them together,
Mr. Playford : No !
Mr. MUNRO; The question that the hon. gentle-
man has raised now is that we are interfering with
the right of the states if we say that an elector for
the federal parliament shall have no property qualifi-
cation, I say that we do not. We leave the
elections for the local parliaments exactly as they are
now, and in this bill it is provided that the people of
the states are to be the electors. If the people of the
states are to be the electors, surely we ought to give
them power
Mr. J, Forrest : Where is that said 1
Mr. MUNRO : In this bill.
Dr. Cockburn : It is implied !
Mr. MUNRO : If it is implied we ought to carry
it out honestly.
Dr. Cockburn : It follows on the other proposition!
Mr. MUNRO : If the people of the state are to
elect the members of the house of representatives, and
if you say that unless they have property they cannot
vote, then it follows, of course, that the election is not
by the people. Only those who have property can vote.
Mr. Clark : How about women 1


Mr. MUNRO : The sooner women are enfranchised
the better for all concerned. If the hon. member is
prepared to move that women shall be allowed to vote,
I shall be quite willing to support him ; but at the
present time we are only dealing with the question of
whether or not the electors of the house of representa-
tives should have a property qualification. I say they
ought not to have a property qualification, and that
they ought not to have more than one vote. That is
the true position to take up in a fair and proper system
of representation.
Mr. MARMION: I do not think the hon. gentle-
man has rightly considered the question. I do not see
how an elector could have more than one vote ; because
if the various electorates are treated as one, how can
a man have a vote for more than one constituency ?
Dr. Cockburn : He can vote four or five times !
• Mr. MARMION ; That is, for various districts.
Mr. Munro : There will be various districts 1
Mr. MARMION : The whole colony, I take it, will
be one district.
Mr. Munro : No; the hon. gentleman is wrong !
Sir GEORGE GREY: This is the most important
question probably that we have to consider in this bill.
I think there can be no doubt whatever that a clear
case can be made out for the absolute necessity of
giving only one vote to each man, and giving every
man a right to vote on the question of returning repre-
sentatives to the central parliament. If hon. gentle-
men will reflect over the circumstances of the case,
they will find that the original idea I believe in every
one of these colonies was that there should only be
one vote possessed by each man. That was the original
conception. That undoubtedly was the conception in
New Zealand. But it was soon found that the words
used might possibly be so extended that a man could
get a vote for each district. The first steps made in
that direction were not contested, and people began
by obtaining a qualification for a second district, and
then a third district, and so it spread until what was
really a great abuse came into existence. The colonies
are all differently circumstanced. We had a hardy
set of people to deal with in South Australia, who knew
precisely what their rights were, and who were deter-
mined to get them ; and I succeeded in obtaining, I
believe, a more liberal constitution than is possessed by
any other part of Australasia. That was the result.
The other colonies are in various conditions. Some, like
New Zealand, have one vote per man, but a nominee
upper house. Then we have other colonies, like New
South Wales, where plural voting prevails to a con-
siderable extent, or the power of plural voting, and
where also there is a nominated council. Then you
have a colony like Victoria, where the right of plural
voting exists also to a considerable extent. There
they have an elective upper house ; but burdened with
a property qualification, which has altogether been
abolished in Great Britain, and in almost every British
country. That is the position of our representation
here. I contend that it is absolutely necessary to
comply with what I believe to be the desire of Great
Britain. Every one of our constitutions was made
by the Parliament of Great Britain, and frequently
made either without the people being consulted, or
even if they were consulted, some provisions were put
in contrary to their wishes. In the British Parlia-
ment we had no representation whatever, and the
result is that Great Britain has drifted into a difficulty
with its colonies—that is, it does not know how to
give the people liberty—full liberty, and the only way
in which it could do it at first apparently is this :
to pass an act to say that every one of the colonial
constitutions should terminate from and after a certain
date, that the act of parliament should prevail no
longer than that time, and that the populations of the
different countries must provide their own con-
stitutions so as to be prepared to meet the difficulty
when their existing constitutions die out. But in the
case now of Australasia, with extraordinary generosity
Great Britain virtually says to this country, “ Make
at once the constitution which best pleases yourselves.
Send that home for our consideration.” And in point
of fact there is that which amounts almost to a
promise, or, at all events, to an understanding, that if
we send home nothing extraordinary or wrong, the
desires of the people will be acceded to; and I have
no doubt whatever that, looking to the present state
of public feeling on the subject of representation, the
general opinion in the minds of British statesmen is,
that we shall establish a constitution in which one
man will have one vote. Now, what do we propose
to do in this bill 1 We propose to evade carrying out
what really are the instructions from Great Britain—
that is, the framing of a complete constitution for
ourselves, by saying at once that we adopt the colonial
constitutions as they exist, and that we give those
constitutions to the states, and that they shall carry
them out. And we are told then that they are to
have the liberty of altering those as they like. But I
say that we give them no fair opportunity of altering
them as they like—none whatever.
Mr. Cuthbert : Why 1
Sir GEORGE GREY: On account of plural
voting. The minority rule the majority.
Colonel Smith : How 1
Sir GEORGE GREY: By plural voting; by the
power of voting for several districts, so that while
most of the voters of the country have but one vote,
the favoured few have many votes, one in each
district, and they exercise a corresponding influence
in parliament, and that parliament so elected
virtually chooses the upper house. The upper house
is not fairly chosen in this colony, nor is it, to my
mind, fairly chosen in Victoria. Therefore, it is
proposed absolutely to cut off all freedom from us,
and we are told it is to preserve the privileges of the
states. What is the privilege 1 The privilege is that
the minority should oppress the majority if they
please. That is what it comes to, and that is the
onus from which we ought to relieve them. Now an
opportunity is given to us so to relieve them. We
have only to put the provision proposed into this
bill—one which I was so glad to hear one of the
delegates from Victoria support. I never felt greater
pleasure. I feared opposition, and to my great
surprise and delight, I found that there was a voice
given in favour of what I believe to be truly just and
righteous. But I do hope that this Convention,
rising to the occasion, will say to the people of
Australasia, “We, having placed in our hands a
noble gift for you, if we please to give it, or to
diminish it, will say that we will not diminish it;
we will take nothing from the great boon we have
the power to bestow upon you, and we give you the
right in your federated parliament of having your
representatives elected under the system of one
man one vote.” Now, if that is done we may remedy
almost everything, because everything depends really
upon the central house, and I feel certain that if that
is done then we shall feel it our duty to introduce a
clause which will give to the states the power of
starting with one man one vote. You will be told,
hon. gentlemen, that this will be making an alteration
in the constitution of the states, and taking from them
a privilege. I say the only privilege taken away will
be the right of the minority to oppress the majority.
That certainly will be taken away; but if the people
choose to have a constitution of that kind they can
instantly restore it. It requires but one vote simply
to say we shall have our old constitution back again ;
a single clause will do it, and they may go on then as
they are going on now. But if the privilege for which
we now contend be not granted, I feel sure that many
years will in some cases elapse before that boon will
be won and gained which now can be instantaneously
given. 1 hope, therefore, that the Convention, rising


to the present emergency, will relieve the parliament
of Great Britain from the difficulty that it has,
knowing the manner in which it has legislated for
the colonies, sometimes without their knowledge,
sometimes without their consent, sometimes in direct
violation of what they asked for, as was the case in
New Zealand, because one ministry—l forget the
name of the premier at the time, but I believe it was
Sir Robert Peel—promised that we should have an
upper house elected by the councils of the provinces;
but the new ministry which came in disapproved of
that, and at the dictation of a single man—a member
of the British ministry—altered it into a nominated
house. Some of us have struggled for years to change
that, and we have struggled in vain; we have not
accomplished it. But give us this boon now; put us
in the same position as South Australia is ; give all the
colonies the right of getting into that blessed haven of
rest, as I may call it, that they have got, and then I
see before the future of Australia a rapid advance in
all that they can justly desire, and a future far brighter
than what will be given to them if the bill, as it is
proposed, is allowed to pass. I, therefore, earnestly
press on hon. gentlemen that in justice to Australasia,
and in justice to Great Britain, the boon we now pray
for on behalf of the people of Australasia should be
accorded to those who are seeking to gain it.
Sir JOHN DOWNER: I entirely believe in the
principle of one man one vote. The only colony in
which it prevails is by no means one of the largest
colonies in the dominion
Sir George Grey : We have it in New Zealand !
Sir JOHN DOWNER ; Whatever colonies may not
have adopted it, the principle is a good one, and must
in the end prevail. But the question we have to con-
sider now is whether or not we shall have a federated
Australia, whether or not we shall go into union, and
whether it is expedient for the purpose of insisting on
views which some of us may hold far in advance of
our time to insist, as a condition of the federation of
Australia, that the views of the smallest portions of
the dominion should be adopted by the largest before
any federation shall take place. That is what appears
to me to be substantially the question. Admitting
that one man one vote is a proper principle, we cannot
shut our eyes to the fact that the infinitely larger part
of Australia does not look at the principle in that way,
and does not adopt that view at all. Under these
circumstances is there any probability of any imme-
diate federation taking place—and we all agree as to
its immediate necessity—if the minority make as a
condition precedent that the majority shall adopt cer-
tain views which happen to be at the time diametri-
cally opposed to their own ? That is not a sentimental
difficulty, but it is a practical difficulty. If we insert
in the bill this condition we shall postpone the federa-
tion of Australia, I hope not for Very long, but at all
events until such time as the majority are educated up
to the elevation of the intelligent minority. Can any-
body of us foretell when that time will be 1 Can
anybody by any possibility name the day when that
millennium will be reached? If so we shall have
something to go upon. But what we are dealing with
now is the immediate question, is it possible to unite
the various colonies of Australia in one dominion,
handing over to that dominion certain powers and
privileges which each colony possesses ; retaining as
far as possible in each colony absolutely intact all the
powers and authorities that they possess at the present
time, and taking them away from them only to the
extent necessary to create a beneficial and lasting
dominion? Now, the United States of America were
assuredly.as democratic as we are. The one great
democracy, the only lasting democracy that the world
has known, so far from considering that there was a
danger in preserving the autonomy of each state so far
as the election of representatives to the national council
was concerned, recognised that principle at once, and,
as far as we know, without much difference of opinion.
The object was to secure a body as a national congress
that represented the views of each state. Which was
the proper tribunal to decide how that body should be
selected but each state? It might be that the mode
of election of one state was, in the opinion of the other
states, absolutely illogical, absolutely unphilosophical,
absolutely wrong perhaps. But the very essence of
the agreement was that it should be the state which
should define how its representation should take place,
and if that representation were unsatisfactory in its
creation or in its working it would be the state that
would have the responsibility of any mischief that
happened, and would have the power to alter it. I
have no doubt my hon. friend, Dr. Cockburn, is satisfied
that one man one vote will be adopted in Australia
before many years have passed. My hon. friend, Mr.
Gillies, from Victoria, may entertain an entirely
opposite view,
Mr, Munro : Oh, no! He is a one-man-one-vote man !
Sir JOHN DOWNER : I have no doubt that many
hon. gentlemen from Victoria entertain entirely oppo-
site views, but whichever views are correct, we really
have to deal with the practical question whether the
minority of the colonies of Australia having adopted
a certain view which they believe, and which I believe,
to be entirely a correct one, are to insist that there
shall be no federatioii of Australia until the larger
colonies and the greater portion of the population
adopt that particular view. I think it would defeat
all federation if we endeavoured to impose any such
limitations. lam sure it is against every principle
of federation which has ever been successful, and we
have before us the illustrious precedent of the one
great democracy of the world, which thought itself
safe in its creation in adopting the method suggested
here, and which has proved by its working that no
injurious results can come from it.
Mr. BARTON : I would ask hon. members who
support the amendment whether there may not be a
better way of obtaining what they desire? If the
principle of one man one vote is one that we should
adopt, it will assert itself, as time goes on, throughout
the continent, and if it does that, it will impress itself .
upon the parliament of the commonwealth. Is it not
worth our while, therefore, to consider whether the
proposition we are discussing should not be only a
temporary one—that is to say, whether the views of
the states in prescribing the qualification of electors
of members of the house of representatives should
operate any further than the first election, and until
the parliament of the commonwealth have otherwise
provided ? If the proposal be a good one the common-
wealth may be relied upon to adopt it. lam in favour
of it myself ; I think the principle is a good one ; and
I have the utmost confidence that the parliament of
the commonwealth will adopt it. But whether that
be so or not, the decision should be left to that parlia-
ment. It is not for us to try to dominate matters in
any way in a question of this sort. It is for us to
give the parliament of the commonwealth, so far as
we can do so, the widest power to execute all that is
necessary, and if we do that we shall prescribe merely
what is convenient in regard to the first election—
that is to say, we shall leave this clause as it is, subject
to a slight amendment at the commencement, requiring
that the clause shall operate for the first election, and
until the parliament of the commonwealth otherwise
provides.
Mr. Gillies : Will the hon. member explain more
precisely what he means ?
Mr. BARTON : I mean that the provisions of the
bill shall operate for the first election, until something
else can be done; but that when the first election is
secured, and when the parliament of the commonwealth
meets, it shall be competent for it to take its own
course as to this matter.
Mr. Gillies : To declare who shall be its electors !


Mr. BARTOH: Precisely—who shall be its electors.
Mr. Gillies : And whether there shall be a high
qualification or no qualification !
Mr. BARTOH : To fix its own franchise. It does
seem to me that if you are going to trust the parlia-
ment of the commonwealth at all, you must trust it to
fix its own franchise.
Mr. Gillies : But it will consist of the states !
Mr. BARTOH : It cannot help consisting of the
states and of the people of the states. But one house
will consist of the states in certain proportions. I
refer to the house which we are told is the nationally
representative house. And surely the franchise upon
which the whole body politic will send its representa-
tives into that national house is a matter that should
be fixed by the house itself, just as the electoral laws
for the legislative assemblies or houses of representa-
tives in the different colonies are fixed. We have
these pow r ers in our respective colonies ; and I suppose
we think we have used them well. Surely it is not
contended that in the course of time it will not be a
wise and necessary thing that the franchise of every
citizen of Australia to the national house shall be an
equal franchise 1
Mr. Gillies ; That would be very desirable !
Mr. BARTOH : It is very desirable indeed that
there should be one national franchise, and that would
be the inevitable result of leaving it to the parliament
of the commonwealth to fix it. If there be any doubt
upon the point, if the parliament of the commonwealth
is not likely to fix a uniform franchise, the only reason
for that course would be a desire to leave things as
they exist in the various states. If that were so,
there would be no departure from the provision of the
bill. But if there is to be a departure, it is desirable
that it* should be taken by the parliament of the
commonwealth, because it is a matter that belongs
more properly to them. I suggest, therefore, that
instead of our agreeing to import the principle of one
man one vote here—although I myself quite agree
with the principle—it is a matter which should be
left to the parliament of the commonwealth itself. If
room be made for me to do so—if I might venture to
ask for an opportunity to do so, for I was not present
a little while ago—l would test the sense of the Com-
mittee upon an amendment, inserting before the first
word of the clause some such words as these : “ For
the first election, and until the parliament of the com-
monwealth otherwise provides.”
Mr. DEAKIH : This involves the question raised
by me in the first instance when the clause was brought
forward, and I would point out now, in one sentence,
to the hon. member, Dr. Cockburn, that in any case
he must adopt some addition to his own amendment.
It will be absolutely impossible to make provision for
the first election of the house of representatives being
held in certain of the colonies, under the restriction he
proposes to add to the clause. To move the amend-
ment without some addition would be to prevent the
first election taking place in certain colonies, and to
defeat federation.
Dr. COCKBURH : My hon. colleague, Sir John
Downer, instanced what had been done in America.
As far as I can read history, the several states
sought out that which was best in the constitution of
each state, and put it into their model constitution,
and it was only because they did that, because they
chose all that was best in the constitutions of the
various states, that they were able to frame a docu-
ment which has been the veneration of all people
since its first enactment. The result is that the con-
stitution is looked upon as a model for other constitu-
tions, and to make a mistake in this respect would be
in my opinion to make a fatal mistake at the very
commencement of our federation. I cannot agree
with those who say that the proposal that manhood
suffrage should find a place in this constitution is in
advance of the times, nor can I agree to argue that
the principle of one man one vote should find its place
in this constitution is to argue in advance of the times.
I think that those who hold other views have yet to
come up to the line upon which the colony of South
Australia stands. I think we should be making a
great mistake if we allowed either the first election
to the federal parliament, or indeed any election, to
take place upon any other principle.
Mr. Deakin : The hon. member cannot help it!
Dr. COCKBURH : I do not agree with the hon.
member. The different colonies will have to frame
electoral machinery, they will have to divide their
colonies up into electoral districts for the election of
members of the house of representatives; and to
abandon this amendment would be a distinct violation
of the principle already affirmed—that the house of
representatives shall be chosen by the people. It has
been very well pointed out by an hon. member that
we should not begin our constitution by putting into
it an inconsistency. If we are going to frame a con-
stitution which is to be a benefit to ourselves, and to
posterity, we must be consistent to vital principles,
and I feel that I cannot give way or accept a com-
promise.
Sir Samuel Griffith : The amendment of the hon.
member, Mr. Barton, comes before the hon. member’s
amendment !
Dr. COCKBURN : That may be; but so far as
the principle of my amendment is concerned, I feel
that I cannot give way. I take it that the house of
representatives, even the first house, is to be of the
people; that our government is to be of the people,
and that being so, our house of representatives must
not be chosen by any other than the people. To
provide otherwise would be a contradiction in terms
which would not be a credit to this Convention. The
possessors of other constitutions have had to fight for
their freedom. The freedom of the commonwealth of
Australia should be simultaneous with its birth ;it
should be free-born. lam of course willing to with-
draw my amendment to enable the hon. member,
Mr, Barton, to move his amendment.
Sir GEORGE GREY : Before the amendment is
withdrawn, I think there are several arguments used
by various hon. members which should be replied to.
I understood the hon. member, Mr. Barton, to argue
that we were not to dictate or rule, while he at the
same time proposed to dictate and rule. What we
have to do is to constitute a totally new legislature,
and we have to call it into existence with all proper
limbs, head, and body, to enable it to act, and act well
and wisely. We have a perfect right to frame the
best and most perfect machine that we can. When
hon. members tell us that we are not authorised to
dictate to Australasia, I reply that we are not the
people who are dictating, but it is those who say this
shall not be done who are dictating to us. Un-
doubtedly the people of Australasia have a right to
start at once on the principle of one man one vote ;
and it is our business to allow them to enter into that
right. The whole of the arguments used to the
contrary are of no avail whatever. With those hon.
gentlemen who argue against this, the argument
always is, “We perfectly agree in the principle; but
do not introduce it now. Let the states do it for
themselves.” To which I say : I do not want, as far
as I am concerned, that the states should do it for me,
or help me, or the state I am in, to do it.
Mr. Baker : Does Hew Zealand intend to join the
federation 1
Sir GEORGE GREY : Hew Zealand wishes the
power to be retained to enter cheerfully into a com-
bination of which it approves. This constitution is
intended to take in all Australasia, and it should bo
so framed. We have no wish to have this done for
us by other people, but our desire is to do it for our-
selves. Why should the men who have so long kept us
out of these rights still say, “Wait, wait a little


longer; we will ultimately do it for you ; you shall
ultimately carry what you wish,” when we can get
what we wish now ? That is our right; let us struggle
for it, and ask this Convention to agree that that
should be done. An hon. member said that Australia
was not prepared for it and did not desire it.
Sir J oiin Downer : I said that many of the larger
states were not prepared for it !
Sir GEORGE GREY : I maintain that all the
larger states are prepared and wish for it. I am sure
I speak the universal wish of Australia when I say
they do want it.
Sir John Downer : Why have they not got it ?
Sir GEORGE GREY : How could they? That is
the very point. How long did it take us to get the
single vote in New Zealand! For how many years
was the bill on the order-paper in vain 1 ? For how
many years have we desired to have an elected legis-
lative council instead of a nominated one 1 ? Because
Ave had no power to get it. Now we are asked to
continue to deprive the people of the power of obtain-
ing these things for some time longer. They say,
“ We will grant it to you.” Who will grant it to us?
Those who have kept it from us so long.
Mr. J. Forrest : Who are they ?
Sir GEORGE GREY : Why evade the point by a
question of that kind? Every one knows that they
are the existing legislatures, in which the people have
never been fairly represented. Who can deny that
plural voting has existed and has exercised a very
great influence ? Who can deny that nominated coun-
cils prevented many things from being done ? It is
impossible to pass any bill without having to consider
whether or not another house will approve of it. No
statesman is certain of carrying in its integrity that
which he desires. We wish now to be allowed to do
for ourselves that which we think necessary for the
good of the country. I feel satisfied that almost every
man in Australia would say that that is his wish.
On every ground I conceive that we are entitled to
have this thing done. Not a single argument used
on the other side has the least weight or potency, and
I am certain that the arguments used against the
proposal can be answered by many hon. members.
Mr. FITZGERALD : I apprehend that this Con-
vention is not the arena in which a question of this
importance should be thrashed out. We are not here
to decide whether or not the principle of one man one
vote should be adopted by the various legislatures.
I am not favourable to that principle; but I do not
intend to go into the arguments. My reason for
supporting the clause as it stands is that in the first
place I regard it as an intrusion upon the domain of
the rights of the various states for this Convention to
dictate to them the principle on which the election of
their representatives should be governed. In the
next place, if we were unwise enough to do so, it
Avould jeopardise very seriously the adoption of the
measure Avhich we hope to send to the states, because
of the resentment which we should naturally give rise
to if we Avere impudent enough to attempt to dictate
to the states and tell them that Ave as representatives
Avent entirely outside the mission we were charged
Avith, by laying down a hard and fast rule that they
were to elect their representatives on a principle
which they had not yet seen fit to adopt. 1 cannot
conceive lioav hon. gentlemen of the experience of
Sir George Grey, and others who support him,
can go in such a direction. We are all anxious
to see some scheme of federation adopted. Surely
we are not going to hamper that with difficulties
by proposing what would have no chanee of
acceptance, and what would involve, as far as
this ConA T ention is concerned, a dispute Avhich Avould
A r ery likely prevent our agreeing upon other and
more important principles. If the states of Australia
prefer to defer the adoption of this system, which may
or may not be inevitable, surely it is not for us to
hurry them forAvard. Their regard for their own
interests Avill lead them to it in the fullness of time if
it is for their interests. Why give them a fillip?
Why urge them in a direction in which, surely, their
democratic spirit is sufficiently advanced to enable
them to travel without any spur of ours ? I hope we
shall not spend much more time on this discussion.
Hon. members Avho have strong opinions on this
subject have aired their opinions and, no doubt, have
also done so on many occasions in their various
colonies. They have satisfied the end for which, no
doubt, this discussion has been raised. As a matter
of principle, as a matter of prudence, as a matter of
duty, I hold that Ave cannot adopt it. As a principle,
we are not agreed upon it 3 and, if we were, it has
nothing to do Avith federation. As a matter of pru-
dence, I hold that it would endanger the whole scheme
by giving rise to resentment in the various states at
our having interfered in a matter Avhich concerns
them, but Avhich does not concern us, Avhich is outside
our commission, which we have no right to touch, and
which, as a matter of legislation, is one of very doubt-
ful expediency. I hold very strong opinions upon the
subject 3 but I hold that it would be a wrong policy
to give expression to those opinions now. I am not
one of those to Avhom the hon. member, Sir George
Grey, has alluded, AVIIO say, " I agree with it 3 but do
not think this the time for it." Ido not agree Avith
it 3 and I think that this is not the time to deal with it.
Mr. BARTON: If the hon. member, Dr. Cockburn's
amendment is withdraAvn I intend to move mine, so
as to give the parliament of the commonwealth power
to legislate on the subject—a poAver similar to that
which is given in clause 10. My amendment could be
carried subject to any restriction which that of Dr.
Cockburn might place upon it. If Dr. Cockburn's
amendment should be negatived, my amendment would
still pave the Avay to the adoption by the federal parlia-
ment of the principle of one man one vote.
Mr. PLAYFORD : It appears to me to be a matter
of principle that Ave ought to adopt a uniform con-
stituency for the election of our members. Whether
Ave can adopt that uniform mode of election at first is
another thing 3 but certainly it should be adopted in
the long run. We said not long ago when it was pro-
posed to give the various states the right to vary the
mode of choice and the election of members of the
senate, "We want uniformity throughout the various
states Avith regard to these .elections." I think Ave
ought to carry that further, and say with regard to the
house of representatives, " Wewantultimate uniformity
in* the matter throughout the various colonies." There-
fore, it appears to me that one of two courses are now
open to us. Either the course suggested by the hon.
and learned member, Mr. Barton, or that proposed by
Dr. Cockburn. One is that for the first election it
shall be as provided by the clause noAv under considera-
tion, but that afterAvards the commonwealth parlia-
ment shall decide and make laws dealing with the sub-
ject, or we may take Dr. Cockburn's proposal to fix it
at once, which, however, I think, we cannot very well
give effect to. It would be very troublesome, at all
events, to have the constituencies and the electoral rolls
ready to give effect at once to the principle of manhood
suffrage and one man one vote. Of the two proposals
I think that of the hon. and learned member, Mr.
Barton, is the best. We can very well say that until
the federal parliament makes a uniform law dealing
with the constituencies which shall elect the house of
representatives we will act under this clause. That
the federal parliament should have the power to make
that uniform law ought to be admitted on all sides.
It should certainly have the poAver to do it. It might
be advisable for us to do it even now, but that is
doubtful. That the commonwealth parliament should
have the power is, I think, advisable. Under the
circumstances, I shall support the proposal of the hon.
and learned member, Mr. Barton.


Mr. DIBBS : I am in favour of the principle of
one man one vote, and the sooner we establish that
principle the better. I look upon the proposal of the
lion, and learned member, Mr. Barton, as being one
purely of an experimental character.
Mr. Barton ; The hon. member does not under-
stand it!
Mr. DIBBS : I understood the hon. member to say
that for the first election the hon. member, Dr.
Cockburn’s principle should stand, and that it should
be altered afterwards.
An Hon. Member ; No ; the other way !
Mr. DIBBS : Then I misunderstood the hon. and
learned member. With regard to what was said by
the hon. members, Mr. Fitzgerald and Sir John
Downer, I may state that the principle of one man
one vote has been affirmed in the legislature of New
South Wales. In our last session it was affirmed in
a bill to give effect to it. That bill was read a second
time. But owing to the natural jealously of the
Government in regard to it the matter was shelved,
the Government promising to bring in a new electoral
bill in which the principle should be given effect to.
If we are to establish federation at all, uniformity in
regard to these elections ought to be one of the prin-
ciples of that federation. From one of the clauses
of this bill we find that there are some thirty-one
matters which we are supposed to federate on for the
purpose of obtaining uniformity, and why in regard to
the house of representatives of the federal parliament
we should not have uniformity of election I fail to
understand. As I have not understood the remarks
of the hon. and learned member, Mr. Barton, I will
say no more in regard to his amendment at present.
I wish to point out that the principle of one man one
vote is already recognised in some of the colonies, and
that in the largest of the states—New South Wales—
the principle has been affirmed, and the present Go-
vernment are pledged to introduce a measure during
the ensuing session to carry it out, and no doubt the
bill will be carried. Under the circumstances, why
should we not now in starting this larger scheme affirm
a principle which is a principle of democracy in its
purest form 1
Mr. GILLIES : I confess that now and again I
have some difficulty in following the views of some
hon. members. I imagined that we all understood in
the formation of this federation that it was not such
a federation as would be a complete legislative federa-
tion—federation as in the case of older states. It is
only a partial federation. It is originated with the
object of enabling the whole of the colonies on this
continent to join together in a union for the purpose
of accomplishing work which could not otherwise be
properly accomplished by the states separately. We
started with that idea, and we really did believe that
on this continent the colonies of Australia would be
able to do a large amount of good if they were able
to join together in a federation of that kind. We
are gradually getting beyond that idea, and we are
forging ahead to such an extent that we propose
to join together on a basis wholly different from
that on which the people in the various states
joined together amongst themselves for the pur-
poses of carrying on legislation and government.
I confess that the view submitted by the hon. gentle-
man sitting below me is not new to the public, or to
the Convention, nor was it altogether new to the com-
mittee who considered the constitution; but as a
proposal in practical politics in relation to this feder-
ation, I believe it is new. We are here, I presume,
as practical men, to do practical business. The prac-
tical business which we are called upon to perform,
each delegate representing his individual state, is to
lay a foundation and to prepare a bill for the purpose
of carrying federation into effect —to draft a consti-
tution. Lines were laid down for our consideration
by our President when he submitted his resolutions
to us, and the idea which they indicated was that so
far as the constitution was concerned, it was to be
framed on such lines as would bring the various
states to join in this federation on grounds which we
all pretty well understood. Now what were some of
the most important of these grounds 1 We believe
that in drafting the constitution, and obtaining
persons to represent the states in the house of repre-
sentatives and in the senate, in order to facilitate
matters, it would be the wisest thing to take the
legislative powers possessed by the several colonies in
their constitutions, and we believe that the basis upon
which we propose to frame these bodies is the most
natural and simple possible. Take all the colonies —
Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland —each of
them have a representation based on a franchise to
which in nearly all cases up to the present time has
there been scarcely any serious objection. The one
question conflicting with it is the “one man one vote ”
principle. lam not going to discuss the grounds
upon which I believe that “ one man one vote”
would be more satisfactory to the people as a
whole than the present franchise; but I say that
the existing franchise here is marvellously liberal. It
is scarcely exceeded in liberality in any country in
the world. We possess under the respective consti-
tutions of the several colonies the greatest possible
liberty that one can conceive that a man might have
under any constitution. What is the result ? We
can make our own laws, and no difficulty has
occurred, except in a few instances where an honest
difference of opinion has existed between men holding
opposite views, but who have been sufficiently liberal
to prevent any serious trouble from arising in any of
the states. But what is the proposal now 1 ? We are
to depart from the constitutions in existence in the
various states, enabling electors to vote for repre-
sentatives in the popular house, and to place in the
hands of the federal parliament the power to say,
“We shall completely subvert these constitutions.”
With what object 1 ? Is it with the object of having
these states represented, or is it with the object of
practically altering their constitutions altogether so
far as their representation in the federal parliament
is concerned ? In my judgment that is altogether
apart from the original object with which we started,
namely, to have the states represented in the federal
parliament practically as they are represented in their
own.
Mr. Fitzgerald ; And in the manner that they
themselves think best!
Mr. GILLIES : With only this difference : that
with respect to the senate the representation is to be
of a different character, because the parliaments of
the various states are asked to send representatives to
the senate in order that that body may be repre-
sentative of the states. But with respect to the
popular branch of the federal parliament, namely,
the house of representatives, that is to be based upon
the representation given to each elector of the various
states in the legislative assemblies of those states. And
why? Because it is true that in each colony the popular
branch of the legislature is representative of the great
bulk of the people. If they conceive that for their
own interest and welfare their suffrage is based exactly
in the way that can best promote their prosperity, they
will consider it an improper interference with their
rights to be called upon to elect members to the house
of representatives upon a franchise different from that
upon which they elect their representatives to their
own house of assembly. And are they not to be the
judges 1 Who else are to be the judges, if they are
not 1 As I said at the beginning, if we were to have
a complete legislative federation, and all the states
were abolished except for merely municipal purposes,
I could understand this body agreeing to a totally
different franchise from that at present existing in any
of the states. But may I, for a second, remind hon.


gentlemen that only the other day we were told by
some hon. members that they had it in contemplation
to submit to their own houses of parliament a bill for
the enfranchisement of women, and if the amendment
be carried we may have the federal parliament passing
a bill, not only based upon the most liberal franchise
that exists in any of the states, but even introducing
a new element altogether, the political effect of which,
I venture to say, no man within these walls can foresee
—namely, the enfranchisement of women.
Mr. Playford : Cannot the hon. member trust the
federal parliament!
Mr. GILLIES : We are not speaking of trusting
the federal parliament. We might as well say, “We
need no provisions in the constitution that will limit
their power or tie their hands in any way.” What the
hon. member practically contends for is that the federal
parliament shall be given a constitution in blank, so
that it can do what it likes, without any limitation
whatever to its powers. That is the meaning of his
interjection.
Mr. Playford : They will represent the people !
Mr. GILLIES : We will trust the federal parlia-
ment on the grounds and on the provisions contained
in the constitution. What is the meaning of the
words “ state rights ” if they do not mean that certain
provisions are to be inserted in the constitution which
will control the federal parliament, which the hon.
gentleman would have us trust implicitly ! His idea
is that we should absolutely pass over to the federal
parliament the rights of all the states individually,
even of the smallest of them. If that were done, we
could swamp them to-morrow simply because we had
a majority. But this is not the object which we have
in view in framing the constitution of the federal par-
liament. We desire to see that every individual state,
whether it be large or small, shall be protected under
the provisions of the constitution. It is in common
justice to the states coming into the federation that
these provisions are inserted in the constitution. Are
we to give them no rights; are we to give them no
claims 1 If they come into the federation they will
come in under certain conditions, and we have care-
fully provided that these conditions shall not be
changed at the ipse dixit of a simple majority. We
take care that the rights of each of the states, even
the smallest of them, shall be preserved, and that
when they have voluntarily come within the federa-
tion upon certain well-known lines, those lines shall
not be departed from unless they have an opportunity
of protesting. We provide that a change shall only
be made by an absolute majority of the federal
parliament, and at the same time that their deci-
sion, whatever it may be, shall be referred to a con-
vention of the electors in each state which must
support the majority of the federal parliament. So
that talking of submitting everything and leaving
everything to the federal parliament is not reasonable.
That is the reason why I say that we are making a
proposal which, I contend, is in contravention of the
distinct understanding upon which gentlemen came
here, representing the various colonies—what to do ?
To see that justice was done to all. Now there is a
new departure. We are to submit new proposals to
be embodied in the constitution which completely alter
the representation of the most popular branches of the
legislatures in the whole of the states. The suggestion
has been made that the federal parliament, under this
proposal, would be in a position to so completely
change the franchise for the election of members to
the federal parliament as to extend the franchise to
women. I assert that, although I have paid great
attention to the consideration of this question, I have
not, up to the present hour, been able to learn from
any one who has supported these proposals what the
consequence of such a violent change would be in our
political institutions. I am not going to say at this
moment that I would condemn a proposal of that kind
if I were convinced that it was one that would promote
the interests of the whole community of men and
women ; but I say that up to the present hour not one
solitary state on this continent has ever attempted to
submit for legislative decision a proposition of that
kind. I object to arbitrary power being given to the
federal parliament to deal with the franchise of the
whole of the people in the way to which I have
referred. If we are to be practical men, if we honestly
believe that it is our duty to carry a rational consti-
tution for a federal parliament, we must, I say, abandon
these fads. Fads they are, at any rate up to the
present hour, and I say we must abandon them.
Dr. Cockburn : Which fads'?
Mr. GILLIES : The hon. gentleman’s proposal is a
fad.
Dr. Cockburn : What! Manhood suffrage a fad !
Mr. GILLIES : No, it is not manhood suffrage ; we
have manhood suffrage, and we are prepared to stick
to manhood suffrage. I claim for our Parliament, the
Parliament of Victoria, the power to frame its laws as
it thinks proper with reference to the right of electors,
or any man. in the community to vote.
Mr. Playford : Have you women’s suffrage in
Victoria ?
Mr. GILLIES : The hon. gentleman cannot keep
quiet; he is bound to speak. Interruption can dp no
good, because it is not argument. In the colony of
Victoria we claim the right to frame our electoral laws
as we think proper—to admit every person to the
suffrage. We claim the right to frame our laws so
that there shall be one man one vote. No doubt that
principle may be delayed for a time; but I believe
that in all the colonies it will come by-and-by. But,
why should we rush this question at the present hour 1
Why should we draw a herring across the track, and
try to prevent—as I believe will be the case if a pro-
posal of this kind is carried—the federal parliament
making such laws as it thinks proper 1 I deny that
right; Ido not think it is desirable. I believe that
if we are going to do real practical work, and to form
a federation, we must be prepared for the present to
abide by the laws on electoral subjects which are made
in each of the colonies ; that the colonies, in returning
men to parliament, shall return those men elected on
the popular basis to the popular branch of the legis-
lature ; and we must be prepared to abide by those
laws so long as they exist. To say that we are to
insist on the colony of Victoria, or the colony of New
South Wales, or the colony of Queensland, or indeed
any other colony, electing persons to the popular branch
of the federal parliament under totally different laws
and conditions to those appertaining to the individual
colonies, has never before been contended; and lam
sorry that the question has been raised at present,
because I am confident we are raising difficulties in the
path of federation which are wholly unnecessary. I
venture to say that there are some matters contained
in the bill now before us which, if persisted in, will
raise new difficulties and new troubles. For what
purpose—with what object 1 ? Surely not for the
purpose of preventing federation ! I say, however,
that they will help to prevent federation. This pro-
posal for federation will naturally encounter, in con-
sequence of natural diversities of opinions in the
various colonies, sufficient opposition, without our
raising new difficulties which it is not necessary to
raise. The man who raises new and unnecessary
difficulties in our path at the present moment is not a
man, in my opinion, who is truly favourable to
federation.
Dr. COCKBURN: The arguments of the hon.
member, Mr. Gillies, were so entirely directed against
the proposal of the hon. member, Mr. Barton, and not
against mine, that I think it is for the hon. member,
Mr. Barton, to answer them, and not for me. I
concur in almost the whole of the remarks made by
the hon. gentleman who last spoke. I think that the


greatest diversity should be left to the legislatures in
everything but things essential. With the exception
of the question of one man one vote I would leave all
the remainder of the realm of diversities to the legis-
latures. I agree that it would be a mistake to cramp
the individuality of the different states by passing a
general law arranging the franchise in every detail.
Just a word with regard to the statement that any
one who advocates that manhood suffrage and the
one man one vote principle should find a place in this
constitution is standing in the way, to some extent, of
early federation. I maintain that it is quite the
opposite. Unless you do this, those colonies which
already possess manhood suffrage and the one man one
vote principle will have to think very seriously before
they suri'ender their liberties and xxxake a retrogade
step. It is a well known saying that in democracy
thei’e is xxo step backwax-d.
Mr. Fitzgerald : What addition will one maxi one
vote give to the people? Why, it is a bagatelle !
Dr. COCKBURN: It gives a gx’eat deal in principle,
and something in px'actice, axxd to ask those who for
many years have exijoyed the principle of oxxe man one
vote to delegate any portion of the functions they now
exei’cise to a body which is not founded on so fair a
basis, would be to ask them to do something which I
questioxx very much whether they would willingly
undertake. Instead of my proposal staxiding in the
way of federatioxx, I am inclined to think that it will
stand in the way of federation if it is xiot earned.
These communities ai’e progi'essive, and they can easily
advance; but it is very difficult for them to go back,
and I do xiot think they ought to go back. I should
be sorxy to see any colony wlxich possessed these privi-
leges surrender Them ixx any respect whatever. On
the other haxxd, I should be very glad to see the other
colonies standing in the back rank come up and take
their places in the rank of fx’eedom ; axxd that is what
they would do. I consider that those who are advocat-
ing the insertion of this fundamental principle of
democracy in our constitution are smoothing the way
to federation, and are xiot placing obstacles in the path,
Mr. Barton : Is the hon. member prepared to with-
draw his amendment, to make room for the other one
to be discussed ?
Dr. COCKBURN : 1 have already stated that I
would allow xny amendment to be withdrawxx in order
that the hon. gentleman may introduce his amendment.
I would point out that the hon. member’s amendment
introduces an entirely different principle, and that it
will in no way qualify the addition of the words aftex--
wards. As it does not really touch the question, I
feel bound in courtesy to withdraw my amendment,
in order that the hon. member may move his amend-
ment first.
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
Mr. BARTON : I move :
That the clause be amended by inserting at its commence-
ment the following words :—“ The parliament of the common-
wealth may make laws presci’ibing a uniform qualification of
electors of members of the house of representatives. Until
the parliament of the commonwealth otherwise provides.”
As I said a little while ago, I have adopted some
woixls parallel with those in clause 21, referring to
the senate, so that the parliament may with reference
to the house of representatives, as well as to the
senate, have the power of prescribing a uniform
manner of choosing members. Ixx dealing with this
matter before, I did not make myself sufficiently clear
to my hon. friend, Mr. Dibbs. What I mean by this
amendment is this ; The clause as printed in the bill
pi’escribes the qualification of each state to be adopted
as the qualification for electors of members of the
house of representatives. To that I object, because,
whatever opinion may be held from time to time by
the majority in the commonwealth, I see no reason why
the majority, as exex-cising their functions through the
parliament of the commonwealth, should be deprived
of the opportunity from time to time of expressing
that opinion by prescribing the franchise. I believe
that, although we are giving to the various states, in
the first instance, the power of sending members to
the house of representatives, elected upon *the fran-
chise for the time being of the more numerous house,
still that is a power which ought never to be intended
to be perpetuated in the constitution, because there
can be nothing more desirable than that there should
be a uniform basis of election for members of the
house of representatives, and there certainly can be
nothing more undesirable than that members of
the house of representatives, being elected upon
different suffrages in different states, should be met
with the argument that they are either more con-
servative or xnox’e democratic in the manner of their
election than those who represent other parts of the
commonwealth. We have to recollect that, with
respect to the house of the commonwealth—that which
may be more accurately described as the main house of
the commonwealth, the national assembly—we should
endeavour to represent uniformly the nation. I use
this word “ nation” without in any sense implying
that it is a nation independent of the British empire.
Well, if it is a sensible thing that there should not be
an opportunity left for argument between hon. mem-
bers coming from one state and those from another as
to the basis upon which they are elected by the people
—if it is a desirable thing that the people of the whole
commonwealth, being fellow-citizens, and being equally
fellow-citizens for that purpose, should vote equally—
then there can be no question, I take it, that the suffrage
throughout the commonwealth should be uniform. It
has been very stoutly and warmly argued by the hon.
member, Mr. Gillies, that we should leave things as
proposed in the bill; but I cannot see my way to assent
to that, as anything but a temporary proposition,
because I do not see how we can well say that we have
constituted a free parliament for the commonwealth
tinless we give that parliament power to choose the
franchise upon which the parliament shall be elected.
Mr. Donaldson ; And interfere with state rights !
Mr. BARTON : I do not see why the hon. gentle-
man should say “ and interfere with state rights” unless
this franchise is an uneven, and in that sense a rugged
one. I do not see why the hon. member should
assume that a parliament elected on a uniform basis as
prescribed by the commonwealth would be more likely
to interfere with the interests of the states than would
one elected on a totally uneven basis. What is the
reason for the fear ?
Mr. Donaldson: The states of America never
insisted on this!
Mr. BARTON : What have I to do with that 1
Are we building an American constitution ?
Mr. Donaldson ; We are taking a copy from it
where advisable!
Mr. BARTON ; We are taking a copy from it
where advisable; but we are exercising our own judg-
ment as to what is advisable. It is no argument to
say that a certain provision is in the Constitution of
the United States; but if I find that it is applicable
to the condition of this country I have no hesitation
in taking the form of words, if they arc fit words, in
which it is embodied in the Constitution of the United
States. However, it is no argument to say that a
certain principle or provision is in the constitution of
one country or another. What we are concerned about
is whether a pi’ovision is adapted to the needs of this
country. Then there can be no harm in adopting the
words if they are fit words. There is no plagiarism,
as suggested, for if certain words have stood the test
of time, and are adapted for carrying out our wishes,
wo should take them, unless we can find better ones,
Ouradoptingthose words doesnot imply any superiority
in the constitution from which we adopt them, unless
the idea contained in those words has first commended
itself to our judgment.


Mr. J. Forrest : Why did not the hon. and learned
gentleman do this in committee ?
Mr. BARTON : I did express my views on this
question in committee. From the beginning I have
held the opinion that if we constitute a free parliament
in a free country, we must give the house most directly
responsible to the people the right of fixing the fran-
chise. You must allow not only that house, for that
is a mere form of words, but the people, to fix their
franchise. We must therefore look to the people of
the commonwealth to constitute a franchise upon
which they shall be represented in the house of
representatives. If we do not, we are not adding to
the liberty of the states or people; but are taking
something away. There is no inconsistency between
this position and the strongest advocacy of state
interests where they are concerned. There is another
house—an elected one —that is to directly represent
the states, and it is a reasonable and consistent thing
to give to the legislatures of the states, if they are
adopted as the electoral body, the right of choosing
their representatives in the senate in the manner they
deem best. But that does not affect the argument as
regards the house of representatives one bit. It is
the house directly representing the people, directly
representing the commonwealth itself, and is expected
to work, as we hope it will, with the house which
represents the federal principle.
Mr. Gillies : And form one homogeneous state ?
Mr. BARTON : Yes; and form one homogeneous
state. He who says that they will not form one
homogeneous state together might as well argue that,
where there are two houses, one with manhood suffrage,
and another with a property qualification, you cannot
form a homogeneous state. There you have class repre-
sentation; but here you have not; that is the difference.
Mr. Gillies : But there are six or seven colonies
to come in!
Mr. BARTON : What have I to do with the number
of colonies ? The principle, if good, is good for six or
sixty. What certainly did not appear to me to be
clear in an. argument on my proposal, addressed to the
Committee by one hon. member, is this: upon what
form of reason it was contended that, although we
might constitute a house of parliament directly repre-
senting the people elected on popular suffrage, and
allow the people, as represented in that parliament, to
make their laws, so far as the form of the constitution
allows them, and to present them to the other house
for concurrence, we should refuse them permission to
make their own laws as to a franchise which shall
be satisfactory to the whole people. It seems to be
suggested that any one who thinks that state interests
should be preserved in the senate is also compelled to
abandon any idea of equal democratic representation.
That is not so, and I feel as strongly my principle in
this matter as I feel strongly my principle with refer-
ence to election to the senate, and I trust that this
amendment will be adopted, and that we shall not seek
to fetter the hands of the commonwealth in any way,
that we shall not seek to take away from the parlia-
ment of the commonwealth the power of prescribing,
as the representatives of the people, how the people
shall elect members to that house. I have already
said that this amendment, if adopted, will not interfere
with the amendment of the hon. member, Dr. Cock-
burn. If the amendment is adopted, and the clause
as it stands follows it, and then the amendment of Dr.
Cockburn is proposed, the result will be this ; the
amendment of Dr. Cockburn, if adopted, will qualify
the whole of the clause, and introduce the principle
he wishes to introduce, whatever system of election
ensues; if, on the contrary, the amendment of Dr.
Cockburn is rejected, it will not prevent, and it ought
not to prevent, the parliament of the commonwealth
from legislating if it chooses in the direction of one
man one vote, or in the direction of any other popular
reform; and, therefore, instead of fettering the proposal
of Dr. Cockburn, if he should chance to lose his amend-
ment, the amendment which I suggest will leave a way
by which that popular principle can be proposed and
fought out in the commonwealth.
Amendment proposed.
Mr. BAKER : What is the good of raising
unnecessary difficulties 1 We shall have quite enough
difficulties to overcome without placing any unneces-
sary impediments in the road of federation. I wish
to remind hon. members of what has taken place in
Canada with reference to this matter. The clause in
the Canadian Constitution which deals with this ques-
tion is in somewhat similar words to those now pro-
posed by the hon. member, Mr. Barton. And what
has been the result 1 ? For a considerable time the
Canadian Parliament did not exercise the powder of
instituting a uniform system of election, and as long
as they so refrained everything went well, and the
people were satisfied. But in an evil hour they exer-
cised their power, and nothing else they have done
has given rise to so much ill-feeling and so much
friction. The people in the different provinces of
Canada turned round and said, “ Why shoukl you
deprive us of that system of election to which we are
wedded, and to which we are accustomed? Why
should you force upon us something we do not want ?
What has it got to do with you how we elect our
representatives to the national assembly, if we elect
them and that election satisfies us?” I wish to point
that out to hon. members, because, inevitably, when
we go back to our different colonies and ask them to
assent to this constitution, we shall meet enemies at
all hands; and, undoubtedly, what has happened in
Canada will be raked up against us, and it will be
said, “ See how the people in Canada have had their
privileges and rights interfered with unnecessarily by
a provision such as this ; and now you ask us to give
power to the federal parliament to enact such a law,
which has worked so detrimentally in Canada.” I
think we ought to take warning by what has happened
in that country.
Mr. WRIXON : I shall be unable to vote for the
amendment of the hon. member, Mr. Barton. It
seems to me that we are losing sight somewhat of the
object we had in view. We are not now forming a
unified nation. We are only forming an arrangement
by which a number of states can come together for
the accomplishment of certain objects that are common
to all. I think the less we intrude into the arrange-
ments which each state makes for being represented in
the common parliament, the better. If it is right that
we should so intrude, and should inquire how they
arrange to be represented, then I think we have just
as good a right to go to the upper house as to the lower
house, and I do not see why %ve should not object in
some cases to nominee upper houses. New South Wales,
for instance, has a nominated upper house, of which
my hon. friend, Mr. Barton, I believe, is a member.
Well, if we want to scrutinise the machinery which
each state provides for returning members to the
federal parliament, we might raise an objection to
colonies returning them through a nominee upper
house, on the ground that many of us do not agree
with such an institution. But we do not propose to
interfere with any colony having a nominee upper
house. We leave it full and equal power with the
colony that has an elective upper house ; and just in
the same way, I think, we should leave it to each state
to determine for itself by what electoral machinery it
will x'eturn the men whom it chooses to represent it in
the house of representatives of the federal legislature.
I think there is truth in what the hon. member who
preceded me said, namely, that Canada has got into
difficulties by this very step, and by taking upon itself
to interfere with the electoral machinery and arrange-
mentsof the different provinces subject to the Dominion
Government, and I have no doubt that we should give
dissatisfaction if we topk a similar step.


Mr. KINGSTON : I think it is rather a pity that
some arguments which we have heard addressed to the
Convention in connection with this clause were not
advanced at the time when we were discussing the
propriety of establishing a uniform system in connec-
tion with the election of senators, because I am satis-
fied that had they been put with the force with which
they have now been put, the small minority who were
found recording their votes in favour of allowing each
state to settle the matter for itself as it thought best
would have been converted into a large majority. I
thought, and still think, that it is just as well to refrain
from interfering with the states in the decision of these
questions for themselves, and I cannot see my way to
support the amendment moved by the hon. member,
Mr. Barton, which would have the effect of giving the
federal parliament power to remove the subject from
the jurisdiction of the states. Of course there must
be some limitation as to the powers of the states in
connection with the decision of the question. We are
surely justified in laying down some rules for their
guidance, and when the proper time comes I shall be
found recording my vote in favour of the amendment
indicated by my colleague, Dr. Cockburn. The two
questions are, of course, involved in this amendment—
the one as to the propriety of insisting upon a property
qualification as portion of the electoral franchise for
the national assembly, and the other the expediency of
prohibiting any elector having more than one vote in
connection with the return of a member to the lower
branch of the federal parliament. These two pro-
positions have been referred to in a variety of ways.
One hon. delegate, who, I believe, will find one of
the principles at least embodied in the legislation
of the country of which he is a distinguised statesman,
has referred to them as "fads." Ido not propose to
enter into a discussion of their merits, for I imagine
that we all have preconceived ideas on the subject
which we are not likely to alter during the short
ai'gument which can take place on the floor of this
Convention. I have a strong belief in the propriety,
when we are establishing a constituency for the return
of members to a national assembly, of insisting on the
right of each individual to one vote in virtue of his
individuality, of recognising that right and conceding
it to him on that ground, and denying it to him on
all other grounds ; and it is for that reason that I
shall record my vote in favour of the amendment.
But, subject to those qualifications which appear to
me as sufficient to mark out the nature of the con-
stituency which is to be intrusted with the privilege
of returning members to the national assembly, I
would leave the matter in the hands of the states
themselves to settle as from time to time they think
fit. At the same time, does it not strike those who
have recorded their votes at a previous stage of this
debate in favour of establishing a uniform system for
the choice of senators, that it is rather inconsistent to
lay down within the four corners of this bill a rule for
establishing uniformity to the extent of depriving the
people of all right of direct choice of senators to repre-
sent them in the upper house, and at the same time
to refer to proposals to lay down a few broad lines on
the subject of the nature of the qualifications to be
possessed by the electors for the national assembly as
an unwarrantable interference with state rights, and an
impudent intrusion on the rights of each separate colony
to settle the matter for itself ? Surely if we had a right
to interfere as regards senators, we have an equal right
to interfere with reference to the other branch of the
national parliament. I sympathise with the argu-
ments which have been advanced against unnecessary
interference, and I shall resist the amendment which
proposes to put under the control of the federal par-
liament the power of the states to deal with these
matters for themselves as from time to time they think
fit. At the same time I think we shall be abundantly
justified in laying down broad principles absolutely
essential, it appears to me, to the establishment and
maintenance of democratic government in connection
with this federation. For these reasons I shall be found
voting in favour of the embodiment within the four
corners of the constitution of the principles which are
contained in the amendment of which my hon.
colleague has given notice.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I think, so far from
there being any inconsistency in the bill as it is
framed, it is perfectly consistent with respect to both
houses. With respect to the senate, we have provided
that the electors for the senate shall be the persons
who are appointed by the constitution of the state to
make laws for the state ; and with respect to the
house of representatives, we say that the constituency
shall be the persons who are appointed by the con-
stitution of the state to elect the lawmakers for the
state. The two principles are identically the same :
there is no inconsistency. I rose, however, to say
that I had entertained a little doubt in listening to
the arguments as to which is the sounder view. But
there is one aspect of the question which I think has
not been considered by the advocates of the amend-
ment of the hon. member, Mr. Barton. If we give
the parliament of the commonwealth power to fix a
uniform qualification, who is to say that they may not
limit the qualification instead of extending it 1 That
is by no means an improbable contingency.
Mr. Playford : That is very improbable !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Just suppose a sudden
wave of fright passing over Australia in consequence
of labour troubles or something of that kind, and the
federal parliament saying that it would not aliow f itself
to be elected by such people, and passing a law limiting
the franchise. Such a law could not be got through
the parliament of the states, but the smaller number
of members coming from each state might be willing
to take the responsibility of passing it in the federal
parliament, It might happen; such things have
happened. At any rate, I think that danger is quite
sufficient for us to say that the parliament of the
commonwealth should not do it ; but if it is to be done
it should be done by a change in the constitution.
These are the reasons which induce me to come to the
conclusion to vote for the bill as it stands.
Hon. Members : Question !
Mr. Playford : We have had enough of this !
Sir GEORGE GREY: Surely we may be heard !
It seems to me that we have had to listen to many
speeches to which some reply ought to be made. I
wish first to say this : that the hon. member for
Victoria used an argument which I have often heard
used in similar debates when there was a struggle
going on between two parties, and he warned us that
those on his side were practical men and meant
practical business. Now, we are practical men, and
we mean practical business, and we are more likely to
fight with some energy because the effort is to deprive
\is of rights which are dear to all men. The effort is
to say this: that we who are in possession of power,
and an unusual power; that we who enjoy plural
voting ; that we who enjoy legislative councils Avhich
are either based upon a property qualification or have
absolute power; that we, possessing all these advan-
tages, are determined that you shall not enter into all
your rights as free men, the undoubted rights that you
have. I say, therefore, we mean practical business also.
Now, whatis the actual purport of the amendment which
is now before the Committee 1 It is nothing more nor
less than this : That it being probable, and exceedingly
probable in point of fact, that you will gain a majority
on this question, you propose then to establish a
machinery made up of the existing machineries which
will enable you to hold every one of the advantageous
powers that you have now in your possession. I say
it is our business to resist that attempt, and not to
consent to the proposal which is now before us. We
are told that it is meant for a temporary purpose. It


is quite true that it has a temporary purpose ; but
what is created for a temporary purpose is the power
of saddling a permanent thing upon Australia, and
therefore I say that such an amendment ought not to
be allowed to pass. I feel satisfied that our duty is
not only to oppose the amendment, but to adhere to
the proposal which will then come before us : that is,
a proposal which shall ensure a free vote to every
citizen of Australia. Eor I contend that if we set up
in perpetuity the same form of government which has
gone on for so long a period of time we shall be doing
harm to Australia to an extent which we can scarcely
conceive. I say that the present form of government
possessed by these great stateshas notgiven contentment
to Australia, has not given peace to Australia, has
not carried Australia forward to that pitch of
advancement which it might under another system of
government attain. I believe that if the government
had been in the hands of the people of Australia
instead of in the hands of wealth, which is the real
position it now occupies, the troubles now existing in
Australia would not have been heard of, and that the
whole position of the population of the country and of
its commerce, would have been far more advantageous
than it is at the present moment. I can see no reason
whatever for continuing such a government when the
Parliament of Great Britain has given us the power, in
point of fact, to put the government of the country in
the hands of the people, to be administered by the
people and for the people. It is for that we contend as
practical men. Hon. members may, if they please, call
this a fad ; but I say that the real fad is that by which
a small portion of the population are determined to main-
tain a power over their fellow-men greater than they
ought to claim, or greater than they can justly carry on.
I shall, therefore, oppose this particular amendment.
Sir PATRICK JENNINGS : I have only a word
or two on this subject. I think it would be an unwise
departure from the principles which we have sought
to embody in this bill to insert the words proposed by
the hon. member, Mr. Barton, or to agree to the pro-
posal of the hon. member, Dr. Cockburn. I think
nothing could be more disastrous than any gratuitous
interference with the constitutions of these colonies
with regard to their electoral laws. We have accepted
the constitutions of the various parliaments so far as
the election of the senate is concerned, and we may
safely take the same course with regard to the house
of representatives. It would be safer and easier in
every way to inititate the working of this great scheme
without dictating to the several colonies an alteration
of their electoral laws. These laws have been made
by the people of the several colonies, and the people
can alter them from time to time so as to admit of the
introduction of any new proposal such as that of one
man one vote. It will make very little difference in
the representation of New South Wales whether we
here adopt the principle or not. lam not personally
opposed to it; but I do not want to go back to the
electors of the colony and tell them that they cannot join
the federation until they have adopted it. I think it
would be extremely unwise to hamper the bill in that
way. And with regard to nominee houses, surely, if
a state wishes to have a nominated upper house, it can
have it. The ministers who nominate the members
of that house are responsible to the people. They live
by the breath of the people ; they live by the will of
the majority of the popular house. It has been
admitted that one-half of the colonies of Australia,
that is to say, four of them, still have nominee houses
Take the case as it stands. New South Wales,
Queensland, Western Australia, and New Zealand,
that is, four out of the seven states, have nominated
upper houses. It is their own affair in each state as
to whether they will maintain or alter the system.
I myself am in favour of an elective basis ; but I
cannot refrain from saying that when a great struggle
took place in Victoria, one of its most democratic
political leaders at that time thought he could do
better with a nominated than with an elective upper
house, because in point of fact, as those who object to
nominated upper houses properly tell us, they are
weaker than elective houses. But I will not argue
that point. I go upon the broad facts of the case.
You have in Australia four provinces out of seven
with nominated upper houses, and there would be an
inconsistency, since you do not alter the elective basis
of the lower' houses, in dictating to those colonies that
they should not have nominated upper houses. I
therefore regard this proposal as in some degree going
beyond the work we have to do. It has been said
that we can safely leave • various things to the
parliament of the commonwealth. Why not leave
this particular matter to that -parliament ? Why
should we tie their hands 1 Why should we prescribe
what they shall do h I have no doubt that from time
to time, as occasion arises, alterations will have to be
made in the constitution, and I think we may safely
pass this clause as it at present stands, leaving the
parliament of the commonwealth quite unfettered and
unhampered in regard to their future actions.
Mr. DIBBS : I was prepared in the first instance to
vote for the amendment of the hon. member, Mr.
Barton ; but after hearing the various speeches which
have been delivered, I think there would be some
danger in giving to the senate of the federal parlia-
ment power to reduce the franchise, although no
doubt if such an attempt as has been suggested were
made, it would lead to revolution. It is our place to
make the bill as clear as possible with regard to the
powers of the federal parliament. While I propose to
vote against the amendment of the hon. member, Mr.
Barton, I hope the hon, member, Dr. Cockburn, will
push his amendment to a vote.
Amendment negatived.
Dr. COCKBURN : I now move :
That there be added to the clause the following words :
“ But no property qualification shall be necessary for elec-
tors of the house of representatives, and each elector shall
have a vote for one electoral district only. ”
Ido not think it necessary for me to say anything further,
except to express the hope that hon. members will see that
this necessary provision is inserted in the constitution.
Sir HENRY PARKES : I shall give my vote
against this amendment. One objection I have to
such an amendment being submitted is that it places
persons who entertain views such as I do in a false
position. At a proper time I should be prepared to
deal with the question embodied in the hon. member’s
amendment; but I say that this is not the proper time.
All that we have to do in this constitution bill is to
bring the federal parliament into existence, and that
parliament will find the means of giving due shape to
its own electoral system. I think it is almost pre-
sumptuous for us to declare what shall be a principle
in that electoral system. When the federal parlia-
ment is in existence, it will, like other similar bodies,
soon find out the proper system under which its mem-
bers are to be elected. All that we have to do is to
bring the parliament into existence. I have under-
stood all through these discussions that one opinion
concurred in by all sides was that there should be as
little interference with individual states as possible.
I have adopted that view, and have sought to carry it
out in good faith throughout our proceedings, inter-
fering in no way whatever, except in so far as it is
necessary to do so, to bring into existence a federal
constitution. When that is once in existence, it can
cut any knot that it is necessary to cut, and can shape
its own course, as every other political body in the
world has done. I shall vote against the amendment;
but Ido not desire to be understood as in any way ex-
pressing my view as to its policy. That I will do at the
proper time; but this, in ray judgment, is not that time.
Dr. COCKBURN : It seems to me that the proper
time to lay the foundation is before you erect the


fabric, and no effort should be spared to make that
foundation firm and secure. As for bringing the
federation into exsstence*being our only aim, I think
our aim should also be to bring it into existence in
such a way as shall secure for it a healthy life.
Sir HENRY PARKES : There is a principle in
the hon. member’s amendment which he does not appear
to see ; that is, the principle of prescribing what shall
be the basis of the federal electoral system. If he is
right in introducing this subject now, according to his
view, any other hon. gentleman would be right in
introducing the principle that the qualification should
be a property qualification for the electoral body. It
would be just as consistent, just as logical, as the
course he has taken.
Mr. Fitzgerald : Or that the system of voting
should be proportionate!
Sir HENRY PARKES : Precisely. The course I
take cannot be disputed ; it is simply to bring the
federal parliament into existence with the least
possible disturbance of the several states, and then
leave that parliament to shape its own course and to
say what its electoral system shall be.
Mr. DIBBS : I believe that the people of New
South Wales will be more alarmed by the speech just
delivered by the hon. member, Sir Henry Parkes,
than by anything which has yet occurred. The hon.
member says that all that it is our duty to do is to
bring the federal parliament into existence, and that
it will cut the knot of all these difficulties. But
before powers are given to the federal parliament by the
people of New South Wales, they will want to know
on what foundations the fabric is to be built. When
this parliament is brought into existence every colony
will have to make a concession of some of its liberties.
Mr. Gillies : No concession of liberties !
Mr. DIBBS: We are asked to create a federal
parliament that will do all the work afterwards. We
have a right to lay the foundation first, otherwise we
shall create a federal Frankenstein. Before the people
of New South Wales consent to create such a parlia-
ment they will want to know on what terms it is to
be constituted, and what powers are to be given it.
If we carry out the views of the hon. member, Sir Henry
Parkes, and other hon, members who have spoken, we
shall call the parliament into existence, and then it
can do what it likes with regard to the various states.
Mr. Gillies : We do not say that; quite the contrary!
Mr. DIBBS: That is the drift of what was said.
Sir Henry Parkes : I said exactly the contrary !
Mr. DIBBS: All our business, the hon. member
said, is to call into existence a federal parliament
which will do all that is required. Ido not believe
that New South Wales will be prepared to call a
federal parliament into existence on such terms.

Question so resolved in the negative.
Clause, as read, agreed to.
Clause 26 (Provision for case of persons not allowed to
vote).
Dr. COCKBURN : I think that some alteration is
needed in this clause. As far as 1 can see, this clause,
like clause 24, was framed with the idea that the
house of representatives would be elected by the
people, and that all the people, that is, those who are
usually electors, should have a vote. The clause seems
to have been framed with the idea of excluding only
alien races, and it provides that a deduction shall be
made in the number of representatives each state is
to have on account of those races. It will be as well,
therefore, to make a reduction on account of those of
our own people who, by the negativing of my amend-
ment in a former clause, will be precluded from exer-
cising their votes. By negativing my amendment that
each individual should have a vote in virtue of his
manhood, we disfranchise a certain number of those
who otherwise would have been electors. I ask the
hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, whether it would
not be fair to make a deduction hero, and to strike
off the number of the disfranchised persons from the
population entitling each state to a certain number of
representatives 1
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : In reply to the hon.
member, I was about to say that if a clause like that
were put in, it would have the effect of compelling
Western Australia at once to do away with its pro-
perty qualification —a very good result. But we have
already agreed to give them four members in any case,
so that it would not have that effect. The hon. mem-
ber is quite logical. In the American Constitution it
is provided in words somewhat similar to these that
when the right of any free man 21 years of age is
denied he shall not be counted in the number of the
population. I recommend the Committee to pass the
clause as it stands.
Clause agreed to.
Clause 29 (Periodical reapportionment).
Captain RUSSELL : There is no time prescribed
in this clause as to when the apportionment shall be
made. I think it is necessary to prescribe the time
in order to avoid confusion. The clause says after
each census, but that would not suit the case, because
there might be an election before the apportionment
could be made. In New Zealand a date has been
fixed when the apportionment shall take place.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : When it ought to be
made is as soon as possible. It will probably be about
a year. It might be six months. We might be able
to make it in three months.
Captain Russell : I think it is three months in
New Zealand !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I am certain that the
returns of the census could not be got in in Australia
in three months.
Sir JOHN BRAY : Who is to make the appor-
tionment 1
Captain Russell : We appoint commissioners in
New Zealand!
Sir JOHN BRAY : I do not think it ought to be
necessary to make a law to carry out these appor-
tionments. It ought to be cai-ried out in a simpler
way than that.
Mr. Clark : It would complicate the clause to do it!
Sir JOHN BRAY : We ought to do it. It may
be that a whole session will pass before the apportion-
ment takes place. I would ask the attention of the
Constitutional Committee to this matter. We ought
to provide that it shall be done as soon as possible
after the census, and there ought to be some mode of
doing it provided.
Mr. J. FORREST: There is no doubt that the
smaller colonies will labour under a great disadvan-
tage if they have to wait ten years before they get
their proper representation. In the colony which I
represent we shall have a larger representation in the


beginning than we are entitled to. But if the colony
progresses, as we believe it will, great dissatisfaction
will be expressed if we have to wait ten years before
we get our proper proportion of representation. It is
not likely that there will be another census throughout
the empire for another ten years, so that it is rather a
hard and fast line to draw. If, however, members
representing the other colonies are satisfied, I am not
prepared to propose an amendment.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : With reference to the
suggestion of the hon. member, Sir John Bray, as to
the mode of declaring the result of the census, that
will be merely a ministerial function. The census
will be officially taken, and will be made public, I
agree that there ought to be some official mode of
declaring it, and I would suggest that thqse words be
inserted, “ and shall be declared by the governor-
general after each census.’'
Mr. BAKER: There are a few words in the
American Constitution which would get over the
difficulty pointed out by Sir Samuel Griffith, namely,
that “ the Convention may by proper legislation pro-
vide ” for the matter. I believe the insertion of some
such words would be the best way to meet the case.
Undoubtedly the federal parliament will have to pass
a law dealing with the subject. It is one of the first
things that they will have to deal with. I think we
had better leave the clause as it is.
Sir Samuel Griffith : I will not move any amend-
ment.
Clause agreed to.
Clause 32. The qualifications of a member of the house
of representatives shall be as follows :
(1.) He must be of the full age of twenty-one years, and
must when elected be an elector entitled to vote in some state
at the election of members of the house of representatives;
(2.) He must be either a natural born subject of the Queen,
or a subject of the Queen naturalised by or under a law of the
Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland, or of the parliament
of one of the said colonies, or of the parliament of the com-
monwealth or of a state.
Mr. DEAKIN ; Although the majority this morn-
ing took a contrary view, it appears to me that we
should be only consistent if we inserted in the quali-
fications of a member of the house of representatives
a parallel qualification to that which was affirmed by
a large majority of the Committee in the case of a
member of the senate. I think we should insert in
this clause the words “ and must have been for three
years at the least a resident within the limits of the
commonwealth.” In the case of a member of the
senate, it was five years, but I fancy that three years
would suffice in the case of a member of the house of
representatives, I therefore move :
That in line 5, after the word “ representatives,” the
following words be inserted : —“ and must have been for three
years at least a resident within the limits of the common-
wealth, as existing, at the time when he is elected.”
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I hope this is not
going to pass as a matter of course. Why should we
limit the electors of the states in choosing their mem-
bers in the federal parliament any more than in
choosing their representatives in their own parlia-
ments? What reason can be given for doing this
except that we choose to do it. I confess I cannot
see any argument at all in favour of the amendment,
and I should like to hear one. If no argument is
given I hope the amendment will be negatived. We
shall not live always, and why should we put our dead
hand upon the rights of the electors of the states
which will exist after we are dead and gone? Surely
they can be allowed to choose the men whom they like
best. They will choose the men whom they know,
though I believe a case occurred in New Zealand
lately where the electors were glad to avail themselves
of the services of a gentleman of large experience in
the English Parliament who had just arrived there.
Why should they not be allowed to elect such a repre-
sentative here if they choose ?
Mr. J. FORREST : It seems to be thought by some
hon. members that no one is eligible as a member of
the federal parliament unless he has had large experi-
ence in Australia ; but the matters that will come
before the house of representatives, or that come before
any parliament, are not all local questions requiring
local knowledge. There are many other questions that
have to be considered, and we often find that men who
have had no experience in Australia are very valu-
able members of parliament; at least, that is my
opinion as the result of my small parliamentary
experience. Although they are deficient in matters
requiring local knowledge, in other matters their
knowledge and experience is very valuable indeed. It
seems to me that there is a marked difference between
admitting as a member of parliament one of our own
race and admitting a foreigner. Therefore, I would
not at all object to put a restriction upon those who
become naturalised, and who wish to enter parliament.
I should not object if they were forced to live a
number of years in Australia before they became
eligible to be members of parliament. But it seems
to me unfair, and altogether improper, to place a
restriction upon one of our own race who chooses this
part of the world as his home, and to say that he
must remain so many years in the colony before he
can take part in the federal government. If we did
so, we might find the strange anomaly that a man who
was occupying a distinguished position in the legisla-
ture of one of the states—it might be that of prime
minister of one of them —was ineligible to be a
member of the house of representatives. I hope this
narrow and selfish view, if I may call it so without
giving offence to any one, will not find any place in
the bill. It seems to me that since we are only a small
number of people —not more than 4,000,000, and
occupying 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 square miles of
territory—we should not say to our fellow-subjects in
other parts of the world, “ You can come to Australia;
but, if you come here, you will be under disabilities,
and you will not be able to take part in the govern-
ment until you have resided here for five years if you
wish to become a senator, or for three years if you
wish to become a member of the house of representa-
tives.”

Mr. DEAKIN: There will naturally be a conse-
quential amendment in the next part of the clause.
My hon. colleague, Mr. Cuthbert, will move an
amendment, in order that the provisions with regard
to naturalised citizens may be the same as those with
regard to other citizens.
Amendment (by Mr. Cuthbert) agreed to :
That the following words be added to the clause : —“at
least three years before he is elected.”
Clause, as amended, agreed to.


Clause 37. The place of a member of the house of repre-
sentatives shall become vacant if for one whole session of the
parliament he, without permission of the house of representa-
tives entered on its journals, fails to give his attendance in
the house.
Mr. GORDON : I move as an amendment:
That the words “ one whole,” line 2, be omitted.with a view
to the insertion of the words “ four consecutive weeks during
It appears to me that as members are to be paid £5OO
a year it is not right to allow a member the
opportunity of nursing his seat during a whole session
without the leave of the house, and in defiance, per-
haps, of the wishes of his constituents.
Mr. DEAKIN : Surely four weeks is a little too
short. A member who neglects his duties will certainly
be brought to book by his constituents. I am in
sympathy with the hon. member, but I would suggest
that he should increase the period to eight or ten weeks.
Sir JOHN DOWNER : I entirely agi’ee with the
amendment. It appears to me that when a man is
paid £5OO a year he should not be absent from his
duty for four weeks without giving some reason for it.
Any reasonable explanation which he can give will
always be accepted. That system has existed in the
South Australian legislature for a long time.
Mr. FITZGERALD : This is really a very small
matter. I hope the feeling which will actuate mem-
bers of this highly responsible body will be such as to
induce them not to be absent, and that consideration
of pay will have no influence with them. I think the
clause may be safely allowed to pass. We might very
well trust that no member would be absent without
good and sufficient reason. To tie a member down to
two, three, or five weeks, appears to me to be a reflec-
tion upon the character of this future parliament which
is unworthy of the Convention,
Mr. MUNRO : It appears to me that hon. members
wish to make an exception in regard to members of
one chamber, and not of another. Surely, if the repre-
sentatives who have not to go to the trouble and
expense of an election are to be allowed to remain
away a whole session, without being interfered with, it
is not fair play to those who have to go to the trouble
and expense of an election, to declare their seats vacant,
if they are absent for a month.
Mr. Gillies : It is state rights!
Mr. MUNRO : Well, it is personal wrongs.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I should like to know
whether this provision is in force in any parliament in
the world ?
Mr. Playford : Yes, in South Australia !
Mr. Gillies ; That is the most exceptional country
in the world !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I remember that a
session of parliament was once called in Queensland.
Two members were absent the whole of the session,
and of course they lost their seats. They never heard
of the session until after parliament had been prorogued,
although they were in the country. That may happen
in this instance. Who knows but that a session may
be held, and a.member may be away at the other end
of the world, and who is to say that parliament will
give him leave of absence ? Let his constituents deal
with him.
Sir HARRY ATKINSON: I shall vote for the
limited time, but with the view of recommitting clause
19, and putting the same restriction in that.
Dr. COCKBURN : I shall vote for the excision of
these words, for I think that a whole session is far too
long a period for a member to be absent. On the other
hand, in voting for the excision of these words, I do not
bind myself to vote for four weeks, which I think is
rather too short. I think that we might very well say
two months. I hope that my hon. friend, Mr, Gordon,
will accept this suggestion.
Mr. BAKER : Either eight or four weeks might
be longer than a session. Parliament might be suddenly
called together, and the session might not last a week
and as the hon. and learned member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, pointed out, some members might never have
heard of it.
Amendment negatived ; clause, as read, agreed to.
Clause 38. Upon the happening of a vacancy in the house
of representatives, the speaker shall, upon a resolution of the
house, issue his writ for the election of a new member.
In the case of a vacancy by death or resignation happening
when the parliament is not in session, or during an adjourn-
ment of the house for a period of which a part longer than
seven days is unexpired, the speaker, or if there is no speaker,
or he is absent from the commonwealth, the governor-general
shall issue or cause to be issued, a writ without such resolu-
tion.
Dr. COCKBURN: 1 would ask the hon. and learned
member, Sir Samuel Griffith, what is the meaning of
the words “ upon a resolution of the house ”? It seems
to me that that is unnecessary. I think the fact of a
vacancy occurring should, without any intervention of
a distinct resolution, cause the speaker or the president,
as the case might be, to issue a writ for a fresh elec-
tion. I think that any delay in this matter might be
very serious to the smaller states, who have only a
small number of representatives, and, without liking
to suggest that party considerations or state rights
considerations might interfere so as to delay a resolu-
tion, I would suggest that it would be better to strike
out those words, and, as I know is the case in South
Australia, and, I believe elsewhere, let the speaker,
directly a vacancy occurs, proclaim it, and issue a writ
for a fresh election. Ido not think it is well that any
unnecessary delay should occur even in regard to our
state legislatures ; and it is all the more necessary that
no delay should occur in the case of members of the
house of representatives, who would have a double
duty to perform—to look after not only the people of
Australia as a whole, but also to a certain extent the
special privileges and rights of the states they repre-
sent. I move :
That the clause be amended by the omission of the words
u upon a resolution of the house,” lines 2 and 3.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I would point out to
my hon. friend that he has omitted to consider that
vacancies in the house might occur by a great many
means, and that there must be some judge as to
whether the vacancies have occurred. It is provided,
for instance, in clause 44 :
If any question arises respecting the qualification of a
member, or a vacancy in the house of representatives, the
same shall be heard and determined by the house of repre-
sentatives.
If those words were left out the speaker would be the
judge. Some one might come and tell him, “ So-and-
so has become insolvent ” ; that might or might not
be true. Some one might tell him, “ So-and-so has
become a government contractor.” How is the speaker
to know whether that is true or not ?
Mr. Fysii ; That would be a very awkward question
for the house to decide !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: If a member had
either taken the oath of allegiance to a foreign power
or had been convicted of a crime, how would the
speaker know that ?
Mr. Gillies : What is the meaning of the words,
“ upon the happening of a vacancy ” ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH ; Whenever the seat of
a member becomes vacant.
Mr. Gillies : Who is to determine it?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : The house.
Mr. Munro : That would not do !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Is the hon. member
aware that every constitution provides for it ? The
stereotyped words are, “ Upon a resolution of the
house declaring such vacancy.” When a member of
the house becomes either a government contractor or
a bankrupt, does the speaker exercise the power of
declaring that member’s seat vacant ? I have known


instances where serious questions have arisen as to
whether the writ should or should not be issued—in
cases of bankruptcy, for instance. Suppose a man is
adjudged a bankrupt, and lodges an appeal against the
adjudication, would not the house, under those circum-
stances, decline to issue the writ until it knew the
result of the appeal 1 Of course it would. Some one
must exercise that discretion, and it cannot be left to
the speaker. In every parliament of which I know
this is the practice.
Dr. OOCKBURN : The exceptional cases that the
hon. and learned member mentions—such as members
becoming government contractors—arc already pro-
vided for in clause 48, where it is laid down that in
those cases either the senate or the house of repre-
sentatives are to be the judges. I take it that this
clause applies more to vacancies such as those caused
by death.
Sir Samuel Griffith ; No !
Dr. COOKBURN ; In clause 44 it is laid down
that where the question respecting the qualification of
a member, or a vacancy in the house of representatives,
is debatable at all, it is to be determined by the house
of representatives. I think that in all cases where the
fact of a vacancy can be called in question there should
be an adjudication either by some tribunal of justice
or by some resolution of the house. But in the case
of a vacancy occurring in consequence of death, it is
not necessary to declare the vacancy by a resolution.
I am speaking of the time when the house is in session,
and legislation is in active operation.
Mr. Fitzgerald : No harm, then !
Dr. COOKBURN : There might be harm. One
vote might make all the difference ; and there might
be a certainty that when the vacancy was filled up
it would be known on which side the vote would be
given; and that might make all the difference in the
world. I say, leave it to the speaker to act on his
own motion, and not on a resolution which might be
brought forward for party purposes ; and we know
very often that party feeling does run very high.
Mr. Fitzgerald : How would it be when the facts
were disputed 1
Dr. COOKBURN : Where there is any dispute, it
would be governed by clause 44. I think it is a
mistake to retain the words to which I object; but, if
the feeling of hon. members is against me, I do not
wish to occupy their time. I think the words are
superfluous, and it would be better if they were left
out. But, although I have moved that they be struck
out, I will not divide the Committee on the question.
Mr. DONALDSON : I think there is a great deal
of force in the contention of the hon. gentleman.
There will be large constituencies represented in the
federal parliament, and it will take a considerable time
before a member can be returned, and several more
days might elapse before he could attend in his place
in parliament, and during that time very important
questions might be hanging in the balance. I do not
believe in any state being practically disfranchised
through not having an opportunity of returning a
member in a case where he would lose his seat through
insolvency, or perhaps through treason, or through
being convicted of an infamous crime. All these dis-
qualifications are provided for in clause 44, and I do
not think there can be the slightest objection to pro-
vide for them in this clause; in fact, I think there
can be no doubt that words should be added to the
clause to provide for a case in winch a man is con-
victed of either treason or an infamous crime. I can
understand that Avhen a man either resigns or dies
the speaker has power to issue a writ to have the
vacancy filled ; but I know that in Queensland, in a
case of insolvency, a vacancy once existed for some
time after the meeting of the House. It was reported
to the House early in the session, of course, but before
the writ was issued and returned some three or four
weeks elapsed, and I believe that a longer period than
that will be required in connection with the federal
parliament. I have no strong feeling on the point,
but I believe we would be acting fairly by inserting
these other provisions in the clause.
Amendment negatived; clause, as read, agreed to.
Clause 41. Every house of representatives shall continue for
three years from the day appointed for the return of the writs
for choosing the house and no longer, subject nevertheless to
be sooner dissolved by the governor-general.
Sir JOHN BRAY: I would ask Sir Samuel
Griffith if he has considered the practice in the different
colonies at the present time in regard to the duration
of parliaments! In-South Australia the practice is
that the house shall last three years from the date of
its first meeting.
Sir Samuel Griffith : The committee considered
the matter carefully !
Sir JOHN BRAY: lam not going to propose an
amendment, if the matter was fairly considered by the
, committee ; but it seems to me that it might be rather
inconvenient to fix the period of three years from the
date of the return of the writs.
Mr. Macdonald-Paterson : There might be three
or four batches of writs !
Sir JOHN BRAY : Exactly, The writs are not
necessarily all returned on the same day. The electoral
laws of the different colonies will remain in force, and
in some instances there is a difference of three or four
weeks in the return of the writs.
Mr. Donaldson : That is so in Queensland 1
Sir JOHN BRAY : It would, therefore, be absurd
to fix the date as that appointed for the return of the
writs. I think it should be three years from the first
meeting of the parliament, and in order to test the
feeling of the Convention on the question, I beg to
move, as an amendment:
That after the words “for the,” line 2, the words “first
meeting” be inserted with the view of striking out other
words.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : The hon. gentleman
asked whether the committee considered this question.
They did consider it, and they thought that if they
adopted the suggestion just made the effect would be,
in very many instances, to give members of parliament
a longer life than three years. We considered that a
member of parliament should be a member of parlia-
ment as soon as he was elected ; he must then, or very
soon afterwards, make his arrangements for the meeting
•of parliament.
Mr. Munro : Does this bill provide that he shall be
paid from the day of his election!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : It means that as it
stands. If we provide that the three years shall date
from the meeting of parliament, and parliament does
not meet for a considerable time after the election—
and a month or possibly three months might intervene
—we shall practically be giving the members a longer
life than three years, and we did not desire to frame
a bill which would enable a man to be a member of
parliament for more than three years. As to this
particular phrase, it was taken from the English Con-
stitution. The practice in England has been that when
the House of Commons is dissolved, the Gazette which
contains the proclamation, or one issued concurrently,
also contains a proclamation summoning a parliament
to meet on a given day, and all the writs are appointed
to be returned on that day.
Mr. Donaldson : That has not been done in Queens-
land !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : It has not until lately
been the practice in Queensland ; but it has been the
custom in England. The time required there is very
short, and probably it would not make very much
difference; but the meeting of parliament might be
postponed beyond the day for which it was first sum-
moned. I have known that to happen before now,
and it may happen frequently again. Taking all these
matters into consideration, we thought it best to adopt


the proposal in this clause, and in doing so we followed
the old established form, the meaning of which has
been ascertained by long practice, and one advantage
of which is that it always secures a dissolution before
the last day. There being some doubt in the matter,
we though it wiser to adhere to the old form.
Sir JOHN BRAY; I am very glad to hear that
the committee considered the point, although I think
they arrived at a very unwise decision. The hon.
gentleman who last spoke is mistaken in what I take
to be the drift of all parliaments. No parliament
lives out the full term of its existence. It is always
dissolved before it actually expires, and so it would be
in this case. The practice almost invariably is for the
the house to be dissolved, and a new house elected,
before the expiration of the three years, the object
being that there shall always be a parliament in exist-
ence. The intention is not that the members shall be
elected for three years, but that they shall absolutely
serve for three years, and the three years ought, for
the sake of convenience, to date from the first meeting
of parliament; at any rate, we ought to ensure that all
the members shall be elected for the same term, and
that one member’s time shall not expire three or four
weeks before the term of another member, as might be
ho case under this clause.
Sir Samuel Griffith : No !
Sir JOHN BRAY: I think so, because the date
appointed for the return of the writs is not necessarily
the same in every district.
Sir Samuel Griffith ; The clause does not say that
each member shall sit for three years, but that the
house shall endure for that time !
Sir JOHN BRAY; But the house consists of
members. At any rate, the operation of the clause is
not very clear, and I would ask hon. members to agree
to the amendment I have proposed.
Mr. BAKER: The hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith,
says that this clause is not intended to fix the term
for which members of the house shall hold office, but
to fix the duration of the house itself ; but there can
be no house without members. If the writs are
returned at different dates, members of parliament will
hold office for different periods.
Sir Samuel Griffith : No !
Mr. BAKER : That is how it strikes me. If the
writ of one member is returned three weeks before
that of another, the first man will be a member of
parliament for three weeks longer than the other.
Mr. Barton : The writs are appointed to be returned
on the one day !
Mr. WRIXON : I must say that the amendment of
the hon. member, Sir John Bray, commends itself to
my mind. Until parliament meets, and the members
present themselves, you do not really know who is a
member of parliament and who is not. Up to that
time a man is only returned to serve in parliament,
and it may be that he will not take the oath when he
presents himself at the table, or it may be that he is
disqualified, and, therefore, until the house meets, and
the members take the oath, and qualify themselves,
you do not know who are members of parliament and
who are not. It seems to me, therefore, that you have
one uniform date at which you know those who really
are members of parliament when you start from the
first meeting of parliament. But if the day of the
return of the writs is uncertain, you will not know
who are members of parliament until they are actually
sworn in.
Mr. FITZGERALD ; I apprehend that all candi-
dates who are returned are members of parliament,
and are entitled to all the privileges of the position.
If they refuse to take the oath or commit any act
which deprives them of the right of membership, they
divest themselves of those privileges quite as much as
they would by resignation ; but until that happens
they are members. But the point is that no period is
mentioned within which parliament must be summoned
after the date of the return of writs. According to
the clause the governor, acting under the advice of
his executive council, may take no action for nine
months, and persons may be members of parliament for
nine, or possibly ten, months before parliament is
convened. I submit to the consideration of the Con-
vention whether some limit should not be provided in
the clause within which it should be compulsory to
call parliament together, even if it were only to have
an adjournment immediately afterwards. In that case
the roll would be called, members would take their
seats, and it would be known who were the members.
I intended, if the amendment of the hon. member, Sir
John Bray, had been adopted, to ask the Convention
to assent to the insertion of these words, “The meeting
of parliament, which shall besumrnoned within a period
of not longer than two months from the date of the
return of such writs.” Ido not know whether this
point was considered by the Constitutional Committee,
but if it was, perhaps the hon. member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, will be kind enough to give us some reasons
why no reference is made to it at all in the clause 1
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I shall endeavour, if
I can make myself heard, to answer my hon, friend’s
question. I have in ray hand the Constitution of New
South Wales. It originally provided that
every legislative assembly of the said colony hereafter to be
summoned and chosen shall continue for five years from the
day of the return of the writs for choosing the same and no
longer subject nevertheless to be sooner prorogued or dissolved
by the governor of the said colony.
That provision was amended by what is called the
Triennial Parliaments Act, which uses exactly the
same language :
shall continue for three years from the day of the return of
the writs.
And the Electoral Act—a later act—contains this
provision :
The day to be fixed for the meeting of parliament after the
return of writs for general election shall not be later than the
seventh clear day after the date on which such writs shall
have been made returnable.
It is assumed, it will be observed in the clause, that
the English practice is observed, that all the writs are
returnable on one day.
Sir John Bray : That is not the practice in all the
colonies!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : No, because we have
drifted, unfortunately, into another practice, and the
return of the writs has been treated in many of the
colonies—in Queensland for a long time until lately
•—as something quite different from the meeting of
parliament. The theory is that the writs are all
returned to the Queen at Westminster on the same
day, the members bringing them themselves, and that
parliament is then constituted. That practice has
been departed from in the colonies, and I think
several make the writs returnable as soon as possible
after the elections. It is simply an accident arising
from want of sufficient familiarity with the Constitu-
tion they were following. I agree with the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. Fitzgerald, that a day ought to be fixed for
the meeting of parliament. I would suggest*the
adoption of the provision in the New South Wales
Electoral Act.
Mr, Fitzgerald : Seven days might be too short!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Whatever time it is,
it ought not to be long.
Mr. Fitzgerald : I should suggest thirty days !
The Chairman : I would ask hon. members to dis-
pose of one amendment before they suggest another.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I was addressing
myself to the amendment before the Committee, and
giving reasons why it is more convenient to pass the
clause as it is, agreeing that a subsequent provision be
put in to the effect suggested by the hon. member,
Mr. Fitzgerald.


Mr. GILLIES : I would like to draw attention to
die fact that it may be very inconvenient for a govern-
ment to be tied down to meet parliament within a
certain period after the election. We have known
cases in which that would have been extremely incon-
venient. We have known, I suppose, in all the colo-
nies, that it has been advisable to allow some time to
elapse after the election has taken place.
Colonel Smith : We want to stop that!
Mr. GILLIES : It is provided in every colony that
parliament shall be elected for a certain period, and
shall expire at a certain period. Let me give an illus-
tration, which is not solitary to Victoria. The Parlia-
ment of Victoria will expire next February, the election
will take place very shortly after the dissolution,
probably in March, and if you are going to insist that
it shall meet within thirty or forty days, Parliament
will be called together in April.
Colonel Smith ; The bon. member did that himself
after the last election !
Mr. GILLIES ; It might be extremely inadvisable
to meet at that time, and it might be advisable that
the meeting should be postponed. It has not up to the
present time been determined that parliament shall be
absolutely called upon to meet at any particular period,
except on the determination of the governor-in-council,
who will call parliament together, and who will be
responsible. With reference to the determination of
the question as to when the duration of parliament
should begin, it has been set out in numerous cases as
the time when parliament is called together. The
provision in our act runs in this way :
The present and every future legislative assembly shall
exist, and continue for three years from the day of the first
meeting thereof, and no longer, subject, nevertheless, to be
sooner dissolved by the Governor.
I believe that provision is also contained in the Con-
stitution of New South Whales
Sir Samuel Griffith : No; I read the provision in
the New South Wales Constitution !
Sir John Bray: It is in the South Australian Con-
stitution !
Mr. GILLIES: Of course, in the different colonies,
the return of writs has been sometimes settled differ-
ently. The return of writs in cities is generally
shorter than anywhere else. The return of writs for
towns, and portions of surrounding districts, is a little
longer, and then the return of writs for very large
agricultural areas is longer still.
Sir Samuel Griffith: That is because people
blunder!
Mr. GILLIES : That is an assumption on the part
of the hon. member which I think is wholly unwar-
ranted. We are speaking of the experience of legisla-
tion for the last thirty years, and to say that it is a
blunder is in my judgment quite an error.
Sir Henry Parkes ; The practice in New South
Wales at a general election is to make all the writs
returnable on the same day !
Mr. GILLIES : That is not the case in some of the
other colonies. What we are considering now is the
question whether it is desirable to fix the term of three
years for which the parliament will exist from the
time at which it meets? That is the question. The
writs may be returned in one month and parliament
may not meet until three months afterwards. Under
the provisions contained in some of our constitutions
a time is fixed for the meeting of parliament.
Sir Henry Parkes : In New South Wales the writs
are returnable, in case of a general election, on one day,
and Parliament must be convened within seven days !
Mr. GILLIES : That is very true ; but that pro-
vision is not made in a number of local acts.
Sir Henry Parkes : It is made in the New South
Wales Electoral Act!
Mr. GILLIES : What we have to consider is the
most convenient way. The principle is that parlia-
ment is to exist for three years. Does parliament in
reality exist for three years if it be elected on say the
Ist March, if return of writs be due at the end of
March, and it meets seven days afterwards ? As I
have pointed out, it is frequently not advisable for
parliament to be called together within seven days of
the return of writs. As a matter of fact, several of
the colonies do nob have their parliaments meeting at
that time, and it appears to me that the proper time
from which to date is when the governor-in-council
requires parliament to meet—that is, that the term of
the existence of the parliament should be three years
from the day of meeting, not earlier. The parliament
would then exist three years from the commencement
of business, and that appeal’s to me to be a fair and
correct way of looking at the question. I think the
Convention would do well to adopt that view. If
parliament is to exist for three years, it is in reality
called upon to exist for three years from the time of
its meeting.
Sir JOHN DOWNER : I think the hon. member,
Sir Samuel Griffith, and the hon. member, Sir John
Bray, are aiming at one and the same thing, although
each hon. member has a different way of putting the
matter. As the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith,
pointed out, really the writs are returnable on the day
parliament meets, and members are expected them-
selves to return them. We, however, have got into a
different usage. We preserve the constitutional words
in some cases, but we have departed from the consti-
tutional usage. In South Australia we have used
words not to meet the old constitutional principle, but
to meet the modern usage, and it is proposed now to
return to the old words, which admit of a different
interpretation. Surely the shorter way would be to
put the clause in the form suggested—from the day of
meeting. The hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, has
shown that strictly and constitutionally the day of
meeting and the day of return of writ mean the same
thing. If they mean and should be the same thing,
why not say so ?
Dr. COOKBURN : I think it is a bad thing to
give to a parliament power to prolong its own life,
and yet if we adopted the suggestion of the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. Gillies, and made the parliament exist for
three years from the date of its first meeting, we
should practically give it that power. A ministry
might find it extremely inadvisable to call parliament
together soon after a general election. They might,
representing a majority of the lower house, postpone
the day of meeting for almost a year. They could
not go beyond that time, because the constitution
provides that not more than twelve months shall
elapse between the first day of a session and the last
day of the preceding session. A ministry, however,
would have it in its power to prolong the life of a
parliament considerably.
Mr. Fitzgerald : And the ministry might, after a
general election, be in a minority !
Dr. COOKBURN : That would be still worse than
the case I have already put. In any case, it would be
a bad coui'se to give the ministry such a power. I
think some provision should be made that the writs be
returned within a certain time after a general election.
Mr. Fitzgerald ; Or that parliament should meet—
that is the point!
Dr. COOKBURN : It does not matter much which
—it comes to the same thing.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I suggest that it would
be convenient to at once settle the question whether
the day appointed for the return of writs should be
the date, or whether the day of meeting should be the
date. To leave the question vague and uncertain as
to when parliament should meet is, I admit, a most
dangerous thing. The period of the existence of the
parliament becomes uncertain if it is to date from the
date of the meeting. The object of the hon. member,
Sir John Bray, is to fix the period from which the
three years is to date. I want not only to fix that,


but to make the period not more than three years.
The hon. member secures one part of the object, and
makes the term absolutely definite from which to count
the three years, but he leaves the actual duration
uncertain and indefinite. The hon. member is definite
in form, but not in substance.
Sir HENRY PARKES : I think that unless some
definite provision is made we shall leave matters in a
somewhat dangerous position. I think I am quite
justified in stating a case that occurred in this colony,
and which led to the present restriction in the electoral
law. A government in former years in New South
Wales dissolved parliament. In the general election
it was decisively defeated, but it nevertheless kept
parliament from meeting, if I remember aright, for a
period of six weeks, and just before it met tendered its
own resignation, so that after the defeat had actually
taken place at the polls, this particular government to
which I now allude actually kept the new parliament
from meeting for a long period. That is the circum-
cmnstance which led to the provision in our present
electoral law—that parliament must be convened within
seven days from the return of the writs. It seems to
me that it would be possible for men to do exactly
the same thing in the federal parliament if the pro-
vision stands as now proposed, and I should think it
would be better to fix a period for the final return of
the writs, and to insert a provision similar to that in
our electoral law—at all events, it can do no harm—
that the government must call parliament together
within seven days of their return. In our case the
provision has been found to work extremely well.
Mr. PLAYFORD ; If that provision be inserted it
does not matter whether we fix the date of the com-
mencement of the life of the parliament at the return
of the writs or at the meeting of parliament, because
both must take place within seven days of each other.
All we want to do is to fix a date at which the life of
parliament shall commence. I think if we adopt the
proposal of the hon. member, Sir Henry Parkes, it
will meet the case. It is immaterial, hoxvever, whether
we make the date that of the return of the writ or that
of the day of meeting, if only seven days can elapse
between the two things.
Mr. Gillies : Can all the writs be returned at the
same time ?
Mr. PLAYFORD : I think a time can be fixed at
which the writs can be returned from all parts of the
colonies, because the date of return, if fixed intelli-
gently, would be some considerable time after the
actual election. Some hon. members seem to have
confused the date of the election and of the return of
the writs as if they occurred at the same time. They
do nothing of the sort. The return of the writs may
be subsequent to it, and may vary in time and date.
In our colony we have the writs returned at different
dates. In other colonies they have them returned on
one day. The old constitutional form in England is
to have them all returned on one day; and it was
intended by the committee that they should be returned
on one day. This does not refer to the mere election
of members. Therefore, there will be plenty of time
on the return of the writs for members to be present,
and a date should be fixed for parliament to meet after
the return of the writs. For the reasons given by Sir
Henry Parkes, I think we should adopt the words
which are contained in the New South Wales Electoral
Act.
Mr. MUNRO: The difficulty is the difference
between the territory of New South Wales or any
other colony and the very large area of territory
which this bill has to deal with. If there had been a
contested election in East Kimberley, the member for
that district could not have been present at the meet-
ing of parliament within seven days after the return
of the writ. The question is, what time should be
fixed 1 Are we going to fix the time for the expira-
tion of parliament at three years after the date of the
return of the writs 1 I assume that all the colonies
will come into the confederation in the course of time.
Just imagine what might happen if parliament had to
meet seven days after the return of the writs from
New Zealand ! A steamer might break down, or
there might be a storm, and the government might be
turned out of oflice owing to the non-arrival of their
supporters from New Zealand. We must fix some
time from which the three years are to begin ; and I
think the proper time is the meeting of parliament.
Colonel Smith : We will fix a time for the return
of the writs !
Mr. MUNRO : The hon. member is only thinking
of Victoria, where all the writs could be returned in
forty-eight hours ; but for the whole territory of Aus-
tralia we must allow a reasonable time.
An Hon. Member : What is reasonable time 1
Mr. MUNRO : It is for those who have to travel
over the territory to say, I think that the proper
time to fix for counting the three years would be the
date of the meeting of parliament.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : There is evidently
some confusion still in the minds of hon. members.
For instance, the hon, member, Mr, Munro, says it will
take a long time for members to come from the different
places to the parliament; but surely the members can
come as fast as the writs can come. The question is
not of the actual return of the writs, but the date
on which the writs are directed to be returned. When
parliament is dissolved the day is named. An hon.
member has been talking of the day appointed for the
return of the writs as if it was the day on which the
pieces of paper were actually received. It is nothing
of the kind. When parliament is dissolved, and the
writs are issued, a clay is fixed on which the writs are
to be in, and if we adhere to the English practice it
will be the day already named for the meeting of
parliament. According to the English practice, there
is always a parliament either summoned or prorogued.
Coincident with the dissolution of the old parliament is
the proclamation calling the new parliament.
An Hon. Member ; We have departed from that!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I know ; but is every
departure that is made from the English Constitution
to be regarded as the English Constitution? In the
minds of some hon. gentlemen every dei>arture made
in their own colony, perhaps by inadvertence, from the
English Constitution is regarded as the essence of the
Constitution.
An Hon. Member : It is an improvement !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : How is it an improve-
ment ? Some hon. members have spoken as if the date
for the return of the writs was the date of the physical
receipt by post. That is not the case. There is no
difficulty whatever. A date must be fixed in the first
instance before the writs are issued. It must be one
day, and that is the day from which the three years
count. That is fixed at the date of the dissolution.
Sir JOHN BRAY: I do not see why, when wo
have a practice in vogue in several of the colonies
which we understand, by which the term of the par-'
liament is fixed from the first meeting of parliament,
we should go back to a practice fixed 200 years ago in
England. If we have a practice that works well, wo
should adhere to it. It seems to me that we should
have a fixed time for the meeting of parliament, and
the idea is that the house of representatives shall not
continue to exercise its powers for more than three
years. If w T e adopt the amendment I suggest, fixing
three years from the time of meeting, the parliament
cannot do anything after that term. They cannot
exercise any legislative powers before they meet.
Sir Samuel Griffith : They can draw their salaries!
Sir JOHN BRAY : I think it is quite right that
they should ; but I think it is right, as the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. Fitzgerald, says, that no government should
be allowed to put off indefinitely the meeting of par-
liament. Seven days would be too short a limit, and


we might make it thirty days. I would ask the
Committee to say what we mean. Let us have a fixed
time from which the house of representatives shall
count its three years, and let that time be the date of
its first meeting. It is all very well to say that the
date fixed for the return of the writs is not the date ;
but let us say what we mean. The date for the return
of writs might be put off indefinitely by some ministry.
I ask the Convention to say plainly that parliament
shall not exercise its powers for more than three years,
and after a parliament has met on a certain day, unless
it is sooner dissolved, it should cease to exist three
years after that day, and parliament should be called
together within a certain time after the last writ has
been returned.
Sir HENRY PARKES : I am very unwilling to
refer to anything done in the colony which I represent,
and I only do so now because what I am about to
refer to seems to me singularly in point. In the
Electoral Act under which we now live, for which I am
personally responsible, there are several restrictions.
First of all, it is provided that for a general election
the writs shall be issued within two days. That
restriction arose from an abuse of the law, that is,
from an unnecessary delay in the issue of the writs.
Our present Electoral Act provides that such writs
shall in every case be made returnable on a day not
later than the thirty-fifth clear day after the date of
the issue thereof. In the first place, it is rendered
impossible for the government for the time-being to
delay the issue of the writs, and, in the second place,
it is rendered impossible to delay the fixing of the date
of the return of the writs beyond a reasonable term.
Then it is distinctly provided that the date fixed for
the meeting of Parliament after the return of the
w'rits shall not be later than the seventh clear day
after the date of such return, so that under our law it
would be utterly impossible for the government in
office to tamper in any way with the Parliament.
They must issue the writs; they must make the writs
returnable within a given time, and they must convene
Parliament within seven days. All these restrictions
arose out of actual abuse of the law, that is, delay in
issuing the writs, delay in making them returnable,
-and delay amounting to a long time in calling Parlia-
ment together. It appears to me that Sir John Bray’s
amendment would leave this power in the hands of
the executive government still; they could delay calling
parliament together unless we had some provision that
they should call parliament together not within seven
days, but within fourteen or tw'enty-one days, or what-
ever may be deemed a sufficient time for the larger
constituency. I think w r e shall make a great mistake
if we do not fix the law so definitely as not to leave
anything in the hands of the executive for the time-
being, which can be so manipulated as to delay the
convening of the new parliament.

Question so resolved in the affirmative.
Amendment (by Sir John Bray) agreed to :
That the words “return of the writs for choosing” be
omitted.
Amendment (by Sir John Bray) proposed :
That the following words be added to the clause : —“ The
parliament shall be called together not later than thirty days
after the day appointed for the return of the writs for a
general election. ”
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I would suggest t°
my hon. friend that thirty days is too long a time.
He still seems to think that the duration of the
parliament dates from the time when the writs come
in, instead of from the time at which the writs are
returnable. This you may make as distant as you like.
Sir Henry Parkes : Thirty days is too long !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I believe seven days
is enough.
Dr. COCK BURN” ; The clause has now really
returned to its original form —that is to say, the time
of the return of the writs is still practically the date
from which the duration of the parliament is to be
reckoned, and we are far from the position pointed out
by the President, of taking out of the hands of the
government the power to prolong the life of the parlia-
ment by delaying the return of the writs. As the hon.
member, Sir Samuel Griffith, has said, the writs may
be made returnable at as distant a day as you like.
Parliament is to meet within thirty days from that
time, and the life of the parliament is to date from its
first meeting, so that we have not yet attained the
object at which we are driving. I would ask the hon.
member to amend his amendment by striking out the
words “ for the return of the writs.”
Mr. PLAYFORD : I think that as far as this
matter is concerned we need not try to frame an
electoral law. ISTo doubt the commonwealth parlia-
ment will do that, and will meet the contingency
pointed out by the President. All that we want to
do is to fix the date at which the federal parliament
will begin its work, and having done that the parlia-
ment will no doubt make all the necessary provisions
with regard to the electoral laws very shortly after
they meet. We are simply wasting our time now.
Amendment agreed to ; clause, as amended, agreed
to.
Clause 43 (Continuance of existing election laws until the
parliament otherwise provides).
Mr. BARTON : I think there is too much verbiage
in this clause. It reads ;
The manner of conducting elections for the more numerous
house of the parliament, the proceedings at such elections,
the oaths to be taken by voters, the returning officers, their
pow’ers and duties, the periods during which elections may be
continued, the execution of new writs in case of places
vacated otherwise than by dissolution, and offences against
the laws regulating such elections .....
I think the words “elections for the more numerous
house of the parliament” would be quite sufficient.
We need not go into the proceedings at elections and
so forth, because if we use the word “ elections” it
covers all that.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : If the hon. member’s
suggestion were adopted the whole of the existing
electoral laws would be incorporated. The clause is
intended to be a selection of the provisions of the
electoral laws which might fairly be incorporated,
that is, as to the manner of conducting elections, the
proceedings at them, the oaths to be taken by voters,
the powers and duties of the returning-officer, the
periods during which elections may be continued, the
execution of new writs in cases of places A’acated
otherwise than by dissolution, and offences against
the laws regulating such elections. If the hon.
member’s suggestion were adopted, however, the
clause might as well read, “ The laws in force in the
several states regulating” such elections shall apply.
I know that the matters referred to in the clause
must be provided for ; but what else there may be in
the several electoral laws I do not know.


Mr. WRIXON : I venture to suggest that it will
he better to refer these mere drafting points to the
hon. member in charge of the bill. The whole time
of hon. members who are kept here away from their
business is taken up in considering points of drafting.
Only one man can properly draft a bill, and I know
that it is a most risky thing to consider amendments
in the verbiage at the table. I think these suggestions
should be sent to the hon. member in charge of the
bill, as otherwise we shall be kept here interminably.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I do not at all agree
with the hon. member, Mr. Wrixon, that this is a
matter of drafting; it is a substantial provision.
Clause agreed to.
Clause 45. Each member of the senate and house of repre-
sentatives shall receive an annual allowance for his services,
the amount of which shall be fixed by the parliament from
time to time. Until other provision is made in that behalf
by the parliament the amount of such annual allowance shall
be five hundred pounds.
Mr. WRIXOX: I am not going to violate my
own rule, and raise a point on the drafting here,
except to suggest to the hon. member in charge of the
bill that the wording is not, I think, the best that
could be adopted. I think that to describe the pay-
ment mentioned in the clause as an allowance for
services is a misdescription. It is really an allowance
for the reimbursement of expenses.
Mr. Clark : We argued that out in committee !
Mr. WRIXOX: I should prefer to see the word-
ing which is used in some of the statutes of those
colonies which have adopted payment of members,
namely, that it should be put as the reimbursement
of expenses, because otherwise you get into the public
mind the idea that members of parliament are actually
paid a salary for their work, which they are not.
Mr. MARMION: I do not see why these woi’ds
“ for their services” should be included at all. Why
not say that each member of the senate, and of the
house of representatives, shall receive an annual
allowance 1 I move as an amendment:
That the words “ for his services,” line 2, be omitted.
Mr. GILLIES : I beg to move *.
That the Chairman report progress, and ask leave to sit
again to-morrow.
If hon. members will take the opportunity of looking
at the laws in the several colonies, with reference to
the payment of members, they will find that a series of
provisions ought to be inserted in the bill which are
not inserted. If they look at the New South Wales
act, they will find provisions which take into con-
sideration the salaries that are paid to ministers, to
officials, and so on. Some provision is required in
order to guard against officials being paid double.
When a member of parliament becomes a minister
of the Crown, the amount he was previously paid as
a member of parliament lapses. There is no pro-
vision of that kind in the clauses of this bill. It is
not at present contemplated in this bill to make any
other pi’ovision than the bald provision already made,
Surely it is not contemplated that in the event of a
member of parliament who was being paid <£soo a
year accepting office, he is to receive his salary as a
minister of the Crown plus his salary as a member of
parliament. We have to consider these questions in
a rational manner ; and to settle a matter of this
kind without consideration is not likely to commend
it to our own judgment, and certainly not to the
judgment of the public.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I certainly think
that we have done as much work as we are likely
to do well to-day, and I doubt very much whether
the Committee is prepared to give proper attention
to further work to-night. I should like to say a
word or two in reference to what the hon. member,
Mr. Gillies, has stated in regard to the absence
of provision on matters of detail. The omission
was intentional so far as the drafting committee was
concerned, because we thought it was not our business
to encumber the constitution with matters of detail.
One cf the first things to be done by the parliament
of the commonwealth in its first session would be to
settle the salaries of ministers, and a great number of
other matters of that kind. We have, therefore,
given them power to deal witli this subject. We did
not think it necessary to make this in any sense a
payment of members bill. We lay down, however,
the principle that they are to receive an annual
allowance for their services, and we thought that it
should start in the first instance at £5OO.
Motion agreed to ; progress reported.

Commonwealth of Australia Eili —Adjournment.
The President took the chair at 11 a.m,
COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA BILL.
In Committee (consideration resumed from 2nd
April) ;
CHAPTER I. —THE LEGISLATURE.
Tart IV. —Provisions relating to both Houses.
Clause 45. Each member of the senate and house of repre-
sentatives shall receive an annual allowance for his services, the
amount of which shall be fixed by the parliament from time to
time. Until other provision is made in that behalf by the
parliament the amount of such annual allowance shall be five
hundred pounds.
Upon which Mr. Marmion had moved, by way of
amendment;
That the words “for his services” he omitted.
Amendment negatived.
Mr. A. FORREST: I wish to draw the attention
of the Committee to the amount of the allowance to
ho paid to the members of both houses of the
Eederal Parliament. The allowance will amount to
at least £lOO,OOO for the different states, and I think
it would be better if it were left to each colony to fix
the amount of the payment to members.
Mr. Munro : Oh, nonsense !
Mr. A . FORREST: I am sure that the colony which
I have the honor to represent will ob ject most strongly
to pay its members anything like £5OO a year. At
the present time we have no payment of members,
nor are we likely to have it in Western Australia;
and if we allow this amount to stand in the clause,
we shall find that the local parliament will move in
that direction. The colony is not in a position to
pay any large sum as an allowance to its members,
and I protest most strongly against this Convention
in anyway pledging the local parliaments to the pay-
ment of £5OO per annum to members to attend tho
senate silting in Sydney or Melbourne. I am cer-
tain that in our colony we can get men to come for
a far less sum than that; in fact, I believe we can
get men to come without payment at all. It has
been a principle of our Parliament for many years,
and will be, I hope, for years to come, that members
shall have that amount of good feeling towards their
country that they will not ask the country to pay
their expenses. I trust, therefore, that the Com-
mittee will leave it to the different state legislatures
to arrange for the payment of their members.
Clause, as read, agreed to.
Clause 4S. Any person —
(1) Who has taken an oath or made a declaration or
acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience, or adherence
to a foreign power, or has done any act whereby he
has become a subject or citizen or entitled to the
rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign
power; or
(2) Who is an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent, or a
public defaulter; or


(3) Who is attainted of treason, or convicted of felony, or
of any infamous crime;
shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or
member of the bouse of representatives until the disability is
removed by a grant of a discharge, or the expiration of the
sentence, or a pardon, or release, or otherwise.
Sir SAMUEL GEIFFITH: I think, in line 14,
after the word “ expiration ” the words “ or remission ”
ought to be inserted.
Mr. WEIXON: If my bon. friend will allow me,
before the amendment is put, I wish the Convention
to consider whether it is necessary to have these
words at all:
until the disability is removed by a grant of a discharge or the
expiration of the sentence, or a pardon, or release, or otherwise.
It seems to me that it would be better to leave out
those words, and to provide that if a man is convicted
of treason, felony, or an infamous crime, he shall be
disqualified.
Mr. Cla.uk : Eor ever ?
Mr. Mdneo : Yes !
Mr. AVEIXON: There is a great awkwardness in
saying that a man is not to be chosen until he is
discharged; but in addition to that, looking to the
broad principle, if a man is convicted of one of these
serious crimes, I do not think it is an unreasonable
thing to disqualify him for a position of trust which
he would receive as a member of parliament. It is
not an additional penalty upon him. It is done
much on the same prudential motives which would
induce us not to nominate such a man as a trustee in
our private affairs.
Mr. Cla.uk : It is left to your own choice!
Mr. WEIXON : Here you say, on the face of your
law, that a man convicted of a serious offence is dis-
qualified until he gets out of prison. That, I think,
is a mistake, and it would be well to omit the words
I have quoted.
Sir Samuel Guiffith : You mean that it should
read “ who has been attainted ” !
Mr. "WEIXON : There is one case I admit which
ought to be provided for. It is the case, and the very
unusual case, of an innocent man who may have been
convicted and afterwards pardoned. But I propose,
after leaving out the words 1 have quoted, to add a
few words providing for that case.
Sir Samuel Guiffith : The hon. member should
say “who has been attainted,” otherwise the clause
would be ambiguous!
Mr. WEIXON: Certainly I w'ould say, “who has
been” instead of “who is,” and then I w r ould strike
out the words I have quoted with a view to insert
these words:
Provided that nothing in this section shall apply to any
person who shall receive a free pardon from the Crown.
Amendment (by Mr. "Wnixoix) proposed :
That the word “is,” line 10, be omitted, with a view to
insert in lieu thereof the words “has been.”
Sir GEOEGE GEEY: The proposed amendment
raises a point of considerable importance. A bill
was sent home to the Imperial Parliament some time
ago containing a clause in the form in which this
amendment would make this particular clause. On
the question being argued in parliament it was
decided to add to the clause words similar to those
it is now proposed to strike out. I was satisfied,
from the discussion which took place upon the sub-
ject, that the provision as originally drawn by me
was wrong, and that all hope of reform ought not to
be cut off from a man. It is proposed, not only to
give him the punishment the law has allotted to his
offence, but when he has undergone that punish-
ment, you send him forth with a brand upon him
which he can never wipe out. There is less danger
really in allowing a man who has undergone the
sentence the law has imposed, and ‘which ho was
entitled to receive, to afterwards go free, and thus
have a chance of reformation—there is much less
harm done to the community in that way than in
condemning a man to an unknown punishment. The
judge in delivering his sentence would not take this
other matter into consideration, and yet the addi-
tional heavy penalty is inflicted on the man. He is
literally sent out a pariah among his fellow-country-
men without any hope of being restored to bis former
social status. By no good conduct could he relieve
himself of the result of the errors of his past life.
His children ivould also know that their father had
been guilty of a crime of which they might not
otherwise have heard, and disgrace might be brought
upon a family for-one or two generations. I think
it would be better to leave the clause as the British
Parliament left it.
Mr. EUTLEDGE : I hope the Committee will not
accept the amendment; and I hope hon. members
will carefully consider the influence which it would
be likely to have. Take the ease of a man who may
be convicted of what may be technically called a
felony, although it might not be more than the
stealing of a £5-note. He Avould be at once stamped
as a man belonging to a class who could not by any
subsequent good conduct establish a claim to such
recognition as is implied in the possibility of election
to the federal legislature. I consider, also, that we
are doing an injustice to men who may perhaps have
passed all their lifetime in Australia, whose antece-
dents are all known. If any one of these men had
made a slip in his early youth, it w'ould at once
become known. We are thus establishing a condi-
tion of things decidedly disadvantageous to those
who have passed the whole of their lifetime under
the eyes of their fellow-Australians as against a man
who may come here to-morrow, and about w'hom
no one may know anything. In our liberality yester-
day we decided to make any man who comes hero
from abroad, and who has fulfilled the usual six
months’ residence, enabling him to be registered as
a voter in any one of the states, eligible for election
to the house of representatives.
Mr. Clark: No; we agreed to a three years’
residence!
Mr. EUTLEDGE: I am glad to hear it; but I
Ihought we were defeated on the point. But take
the case of a man who has been here three years, and
of whose antecedents we know nothing at all. He
may have been guilty of slips in his youth in Eng-
land, or in some other part of the Avorld, of which we
know nothing, and our ignorance of those slips would
render him eligible for election to the house of repre-
sentatives. Ido not think we ought, by a deliberate
vote of this Convention, to establish the principle
that a man w’ho has fallen in his early life —it may
be under circumstances of temptation —can under no
possible circumstances redeem himself, and render
liimself eligible for a position implying trust and
confidence on the part of his fellow-man. I think
we ought to hesitate before we revert to a condition
of things which I am sure existed only a groat many
years ago, if indeed it ever existed in any portion of
the British dominions. I hope the amendment will
be rejected.
Mr. MUNEO : I understood the hon. member,
Sir George Grey, to lay great stress the other day
upon the point that we should raise a high standard
to which our young men might aspire. I venture to
say that you can have no higher standard for our
young men than the knowledge that if they are con-
victed of a felony they will cease to have certain civil
rights they formerly possessed.
Mr. Clark : For a time !
Mr. MUNEO: Not only fora time, I think. An hon.
member has said that this law belongs to olden times ;
but it is the law of Victoria at the present moment.
Mr. Dines : That does not make it a good law!
Mr. MUNEO : I believe it is a good law. You
are about to frame a constitution applying to a very
extensive area, and you may find that a man who has


been in one of the colonies convicted of murder, and
Avho, according to our DAV ought to be hanged, has,
through some particular circumstances, been ordered
to receive three lashings of tAventy-five lashes each
and tv\ r enty-one years in irons, going to another colony
Avhere his previous character would be unknoAvn, and
there associating Avith honest men in making laws for
the federation. I say it would be a disgrace to the
federation if you Avere to alloAv such a thing to take
place. We know perfectly well that the result would
be not to put upon crime the stamp that ought to be
put upon it. I say that the man Avho has broken the
1 aw of the land to such an extent as to be convicted of
JI felony ought not to be alloAA'ed to make laws for a
free people, and for that reason I strongly support
the amendment of my hon. friend. It would make
the clause correspond to the law in Victoria at the
present time. We are very proud of that law, and
Ave should be very sorry to see it repealed.
Mr. CLARK : The last speaker seems to think
that because a certain provision is law in Victoria,
that is quite sufficient reason for its embodiment in
the federal constitution ; but all the wisdom of the
Avorld is not concentrated in Victoria lIOAV any more
than it has been concentrated there in years gone
by. There has been impressed upon the laAvs of the
colonies from time to time the mark of their local
and social origin, and Ave know very well that this
particular clause was introduced into the Victorian
Constitution with regard to special circumstances in
the past history of Australia. I think it Avould
be a great pity to preserve such a record in the
constitution of the commomvealth, and so revive
Avhat I am sure all free-born Australians Avould
rather bury and forget. I think the argument put
forward by Sir George Grey is all-sufficient to con-
demn the proposed amendment. It is an attempt
by anticipation to affix to particular crimes a greater
punishment than the parliament of the common-
Avealth may, in its wisdom, affix to them. We are
attempting to tie the hands of that parliament, and
to say that, in addition to AA r hatever punishment the} r
think sufficient to impose for these particular crimes
in the future, we will add this punishment, and
render it impossible for them to alter it. The hon.
member talks about this being a disgrace to the
constitution. Surely it Avould be a disgrace to our
constitution if beforehand AA*e said that every puuish-
ment hereafter inflicted shall be intensified by some-
thing which had no relation Avhatever to the par-
ticular circumstances under which the man committed
the offence. The hon. member, Mr. Wrixon, him-
self admits that there ought to be exceptions to
the particular rule laid doAvn. He says we should
make exceptions with regard to men who receive free
pardons. The hon. gentleman's experience in Vic-
toria will enable him to recall many cases where the
Executive had good reason to believe that the con-
victed person Avas innocent, but there was not
sufficient evidence to justify the Executive in going
through the form of granting a free pardon, although
he has been allowed to go free. Other cases have
occurred Avhere men have served their full term,
after Avhich evidence ha 3 been discovered showing
that they were innocent. The hon. member, Mr.
Munro, says that once a man is convicted he should
never thereafter be allowed to associate Avith honest
men in making laws. Does he Avish us to infer from
-that that Ave can guarantee that every man AVIIO will
sit hereafter in the parliament of the commomvealth
will be absolutely free from all dishonesty ?
Mr. MUNRO : Until he is convicted!
Mr. CLARK : Simply because he has not been
convicted he is to be treated as a man superior to
another man, who, perhaps in his youth, twenty or
thirty years before his election, has been convicted of
some offence. 'The only Avay to carry out that
principle in its entirety would be to add the Avords
i" has been, or ought to have been, convicted," andto
make the speaker sole judge of the moral qualities
of every candidate for parliamentary honors, AVo
should then, certainly, be a model nation, and we
should set a high standard before our young men
such as no nation ever erected, or would attempt to
erect.
Dr. COCKBURN: I do not believe in eternal
punishment; therefore I shall vote against the
amenndment. If a man were wrongly convicted, and
afterwards pardoned, this provision would exclude
him.
An Hon. Member : No !
Dr. COCKBURN : I understood that that was
intended. Take the war of secession in America. I
do not know whether any of the seceders were con-
victed of treason, but they could have been, and the
result of a provision such as this would have been the
exclusion from the Congress and Senate of some
of the very best men in America. Take, again, the
fathers of the United States Constitution. I think
we had better leave this alone.
Mr. DIBBS : There is one thing which will easily
adjust this difficulty. AVo must have some regard
for the common-sense of the people who have to give
their votes for members of parliament. It is a strong
ground to take, that we should not pass a restrictive
law of this character to further punish a man who lias
already paid the full penalty inflicted by the law for,
perhaps, a minor offeiice. We should simply admon-
ish him to “turn from his wickedness and live.” AVe
may very well trust the electors to do what is right.
Mr. Muneo : But the electors will not know any-
thing about it!
Mr. DIBBS: In Victoria, of course, they would
know about it. I could go to Victoria and name
people who sat in parliament and in the government,
and yet who were previously convicted of treason.
I could go to Queensland and And people Avho have
occupied seats in parliament
Mr. Fitzgerald: And afterwards in the House of
Commons!
Mr. DIBBS : AVho w r ere previously accused of
treason.
Mr. Fitzgerald : And who were convicted!
Mr. DIBBS: I could mention instances of mem-
bers of parliament there who were previously Irish
rebels, who struggled for home rule. The hon.
member, Dr. Cockburn, says he does not believe in
eternal punishment. I quite agree with him, and I
think that when a man has once paid his debts, either
to individuals or the state, he should be allowed to
go free, and he should be regarded as having given
full satisfaction. We must leave everything to the
intelligence of the electors, who will have the aid of
the press, which, in New South AVales, is particularly
searching in its mode of action. No man will ven-
ture to seek to be a senator of the commomvealth of
Australia if there is any charge against his character,
because he can rely upon the press stirring the thing
up from the bottom. Let us do what is fair and
right. AVhen a man has once paid his debts, let us
say that they shall not be cast up in his teeth. I
often notice that in the criminal courts when an
unfortunate w r retch has been found guilty by a jury
the judge asks an officer of the court, “ Has this
prisoner been convicted before?” I maintain that
when once a man has served his punishment it is not
right to ask such questions,
Mr. Gillies : It is a question of habit and repute !
Mr. DIBBS : No, it is simply a question as to
whether a man has been convicted previously, and the
unfortunate man probably pays twice over for some
insignificant crime. I shall vote against the proposed
amendment, because I am prepared to rely upon the
common-sense and intelligence of the electors, aided
as they will be by a powerful, and I was going to say,
unscrupulous, but I prefer to say searching press,
which will not allow r any man to occupy a public
position without probing his character to the bottom.


Mr. J. FORREST: I wish to ask the hon. member,
Sir Samuel Griffith, whether the last part of this
clause might not be struck out ? It has a signifi-
cance which Ido not like. One would imagine that
we are likely to have a lot of persons attainted with
treason, or guilty of felony, as members of parlia-
ment. It seems to me that the clause would be
equally as good if the ivords “ by a grant of discharge,
or the expiration of the sentence, or a pardon, or
release, or otherAvise ” were struck out. I quite agree
Avith the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, that there
is a good deal to be said on both sides of this question,
and that we do not want such people to bo members
of parliament. But at the same time Ave do not
want to shut out altogether those people Avho may
have done wrong. I feel considerable difficulty about
it; but I think the clause should be allowed to pass
if the Avords I have referred to are struck out.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Of course the Com-
mittee can strike out those words if it likes. But.
the result will be that nobody will knoAV exactly what
the clause means. That is the only objection to it.
Question —That the word proposed to be omitted

or by any person in trust for him, or for his use or benefit, or
on his account, undertakes, executes, holds, or enjoys, in the
whole or in part, any agreement for or on account of the
public service of thecommonwealth, shall be incapable of being
chosen or of sitting as a senator or member of the house of
representatives while he executes, holds, or enjoys the agree-
ment, or any part or share of it, or any benefit or emolument
arising from it :
If any person, being a senator or member of the house of
representatives, enters into any such agreement, or having
entered into it continues to hold it, his place shall be declared
by the senate or the house of representatives, as the case may
be, to be vacant, and thereupon the same shall become and be
\ r acant accordingly :
But this section does not extend to any agreement made,
entered into, or accepted, by an incorporated company consist-
ing of more than twenty persons if the agreement is made,
entered into, or accepted for the general benefit of the com-
pany.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: An hon. member
yesterday called attention to the' repetition in this
clause of Avords that were not necessary, having
regard to the provisions of clause 38. I moA r e:
That the following words be omitted, lines 12 to 15 :—“ be
declared by the senate or the house of representatives, as the
case may be, to be vacant, and thereupon the same shall
become and be vacant accordingly,” Avith a view to insert
the words, “ thereupon become vacant.”
Amendment agreed to ; clause, as amended, agreed
to.
Clause 49. If a senator or member of the house of representa-
tives accepts any office of profit under the Crown, not being
one of the offices of state held during the pleasure of the
governor-general, and the holders of which are by this consti-
tution declared to be capable of being chosen and of sitting
as members of either house of parliament, or accepts any
pension payable out of any of the revenues of the common-
wealth during the pleasure of the Crown, his place shall there-
upon become vacant, and no person holding any such office,
except as aforesaid, or holding or enjoying any such pension,
shall be capable of being chosen or of sitting as a member of
either house of the parliament.
But this provision does not apply to officers of the military
or naval forces who are not in the receipt of annual pay.
Mr. DIBBS : I shall propose the omission from
this clause of any words that would debar any person
holding a pension from having a seat in parliament,
I do not see why a gentleman who has a pension which
he has legitimately earned should be prevented from
having a seat in either house of the legislature.
Having in view the discussion which took place on
the 46th clause, why should we exclude any one
lawfully enjoying a pension which he has honestly
earned ? 1 should like to hear some explanation of
the matter.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: It applies only to
pensions during pleasure. The object is to prevent
persons who are dependent for their livelihood upon
the government, and who are amenable to its influence,
from being members of the legislature. There is no
reason that I can see why a man who has served his
country, and to whom a permanent pension has been
allowed, should not be permitted to sit in the legis-
lature. But a “ pension during pleasure ” might be
given; and the holder of such a pension should
certainly not be allowed to become a member of
parliament.
Sir John Brat : Why should we contemplate the
possibility of such things ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I cannot sympathise
with the lion, gentleman in thinking that our fore-
cast at the present time includes all possible contin-
gencies. Ido not think that such a thing is likely to
happen; but, so far as I know, human nature has
not changed much in the last 300 or 400 years, and
such a thing might happen again.
Sir JOHN BRAY; I agree with the hon. member,
Mr. Dibbs, in thinking that these words should be
struck out. It does not seem likely to me that the
commonwealth will provide for pensions during
pleasure, and I do not think that the words are
necessary. I would, however, ask the hon. member
whether it is not necessary to except in this clause
the speaker and president ?
Sir Samuel Griffith : They are not under the
Crown !
Sir JOHN BRAT: They hold offices of profit
under the Crown, though they are not appointed by
the Crown. I shall support the proposal of the hon.
member, Mr. Dibbs.
Mr. KINGSTON : Although it seems improbable
that there will be a case of a pension created during
the pleasure of the governor-general, still it seems to
me highly desirable to provide against such a con-
tingency. To permit a member to sit in the federal
parliament whilst he was liable to be controlled by
the governor-general by the withdrawal of his pen-
sion, would be a great mistake, and, as provisions
similar to this are contained in the various local con-
stitutions, I trust that this will be retained.
Sir GEORGE GREA^: We must all admit that
what has been may be again, and there can be no
doubt that not very many years ago pensions held at
pleasure did exist to a considerable extent in England,
and were a vast abuse. Now, one object in putting
these words in is that they would make it impossible
to resume this practice here without due warning
that an illegal act was about to be done. We thus
stamp illegality upon the proceeding.


Sir HARRY ATKINSON: Ido not quite see
the effect of the clause with regard to naval and
military officers. Would it not exclude officers and
privates belonging to what are called the partly-paid
forces, who are receiving a small payment of £0 or
£7 per annum ?
Mr. THYNNE: I think that the hon. member,
Sir Harry Atkinson, has touched a very important
point. The clause, as I read it, is intended to exempt
from the disability created, men who are receiving
only a small remuneration, perhaps for a certain
number of days during each year, but not permanently
employed in the defence force. The exception, how-
ever, applies only to officers. As one looking for-
ward to the day when our defence forces shall be
entirely a citizen army, I think that both non-com-
missioned officers and men should be dealt with in
this clause. I, therefore, beg to move :
That in line 13, after the word “ officers ” the words “or
men” be inserted.
Mr. Clark: Say “members” !
Mr. THYNNE : Very well. Then I shall move :
That in line 13 the word “ members” be substituted for the
word “ officers.”
Mr. BURGESS: I think it would be well to have
this point cleared up. In my own colony I unfor-
tunately suffered from the operation of a similar
clause. Under our constitution no member of Par-
liament, except those holding office as responsible
ministers of the Crown, can accept any salary or
emolument from the Government. I was an officer
in the defence force, and Parliament passed a bill
providing for the payment of all the officers of that
force, and I was then compelled by the Attorney-
General to retire from my seat in the House, resign
my commission as an officer, and afterwards submit
myself to my constituents for re-election. That
being so, I think it would be well if this point could
be cleared up, so that there may be no mistake
about it.
Mr. THYNNE : I think my first proposal is the
better one. I therefore ask to be allowed to with-
draw my amendment, so that I may insert after the
word “ officers ” the words “ or men. ’
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I think the criticism
directed towards this clause is sound; the clause is
not nearly sufficient as it stands, and I have with mo
a similar clause in the Queensland Constitution Act,
which includes several cases not here dealt with. It
reads thus:
This section shall not apply to any person in receipt only of
pay, half-pay, or a pension, as an officer of her Majesty’s navy
or army, or who shall receive any new or other commission in
the navy or army respectively, or any increase of pay on any
such commission, nor to any person who is in receipt only of
daily pay as an officer or member of the defence or volunteer
force of Queensland, and is not employed permanently, or at
an annual salary.
There is no doubt that the clause requires amplifica-
tion, and it would be convenient if it were postponed.
Clause postponed.
Part V. — Powers of the Parliament.
Clause 52 (Legislative powers of the parliament).
Mr, GORDON : It appears to me that we ought
to take the sub-clauses which enumerate the powers
of the parliament separately. It would be impossible
to discuss the whole of the clause at once, and to
make our arguments, covering the whole ground, to
be appreciated by hon. members. I would like to
ask whether the clause could not be put in sections,
so that each sub-clause could be treated by itself?
The Chairman : That cannot be done with a
clause ; but hon. members can pursue the well-
known practice of moving an amendment in one
part of the clause, and then going on to the next.
There is an unwritten practice, too, for one hon.
member to give way to another who wishes to move
a prior amendment.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: It is the practice in
some parliaments, when a clause is verj r complicated,
as this is, to put it to the Committee in sections, and
it would bo convenient to do that now. I do not
know that wo are bound by any hard and fast rule
of parliament.
The Chair man : I am quite willing to adopt any
course which will suit the convenience of hon. mem-
bers.
Preamble postponed.
Sub-clause 1. The regulation of trade and commerce with
other countries, and among the several states.
Mr. BAKER : I should like to know from the lion,
member in charge of the bill whether the question
of the advisability of giving powers to the federal
government to alter, for federal purposes, the gauge
of railways in any one or two states, was considered
by the committee ?
Sir Samuel Griffith : No ; it was not!
Mr. BAKER: I desire to ask whether the hon.
gentleman considers that this sub-clause is wide
enough to cover that matter ?
Sir Samuel Griffith: I do not think so !
Mr. BAKER: I would point out that by-and-by,
when the different states contain much larger popu-
lations, when they come much closer together, and
when the inter-communication between them is much
greater, this question of railway gauges will assume
very large proportions, and it seems to me that it
would be advisable to give the federal parliament
power, at the federal expense, to alter the gauge of
any line of railway where it is considered advisable
that it should be done. Of course Ido not say that
the parliament would do it, and I dare say it would
not bo done for a great many years to come; but
it might, and probably will, in years to come, be
advisable, if not to adopt a uniform railway gauge
for the colonies, at all events to alter the gauge of
certain specified intercolonial lines, so as to make
them of one gauge. This is a matter, I think, of
considerable importance. Perhaps this is not the
proper sub-clause in connection with which to deal
with the matter. I will, however, take an opportu-
nity, before we get to the end of the clause, of
inserting a sub-clause to the effect I have mentioned.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : In answer to the
hon. gentleman, I would point out that sub-clause 29
is the only one in the list which the committee con-
sidered covered a matter such as that which he has
mentioned. The committee, however, had not the
matter under their attention specially. It would
require a mutual agreement of slates before it could
be carried out,
Mr. GORDON: I would suggest that the point
raised by the hon. member, Mr. Baker, would be
more likely to come under sub-clause 0. The subject
has already been raised in connection with the ques-
tion of the defence of Australia. I should like to
ask the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, whether he
thinks the sub-section will confer on the federal
parliament sufficient authority to regulate railway
tariffs on intercolonial lines ?
Sir Samuel Griffith : I do not think so !
Mr. GORDON : Which clause will ?
Sir Samuel Griffith: The chapter on finance
and trade contains a provision, in section 12, which
was considered very carefully by the committee in
connection with that subject.
Mr. GORDON ; Then I shall move, subject to
further criticism of the sub-clause, the postponement
of its consideration, with the view of inserting words
which will cover that condition.
Sir Samuel Griffith : It should be a separate
paragraph, then !
Mr. GORDON: It maybe argued that the subject
will be covered; but the hon. gentleman who is
principally responsible for the bill thinks it is doubt-
ful.


Sir Samuel Griffith ; It is not covered by this
sub-clause !
Mr. GORDON: And it is not clearly and specifically
covered by the other. It is important that it should
be covered. I shall move an amendment later on.
Mr. CLARK : I have already expressed the opinion
that under this clause the federal parliament would
have power to control railway tariffs to a certain
extent. Ido not know whether the language I used
overstated the case I meant to put before the Con-
vention ; but I remember that what I stated was
disputed at the time by certain hon. members. In
the first instance, I would say that this sub-clause is
about the very widest one in the whole of the clause.
It contains the widest power which we propose to
give to the federal parliament. Under a similar power
conferred upon them, the Congress of America have
from time to time introduced very startling legisla-
tion, which the Supreme Court has sustained ; and it
is very hard to say what legislation will yet be enacted
under that power by the Congress of America which
the Supreme Court of that country will not sustain.
The most startling and revolutionary act passed by
the American Congress under that power is known
as the Inter-State Commerce Act; and although
that act sets out by stating plainly that it refers
only to common carriers carrying goods from state
to state, or from territory to state, or from foreign
countries to several states, yet the historical origin
of that act points to the control of commerce
within the slate. The state of Illinois passed a
law to regulate the tariffs upon the railways, within
its own borders, and a case under that act was
brought before the Supreme Court. The law was de-
clared to be unconstitutional, although it purported
to regulate tariffs only within the state on the
ground, as stated by Judge Miller, that the' regula-
tion of commerce as a whole throughout the whole
of the union was transferred from the states to the
federal government. That is a very strange fact in
connection with the history of that act. Immediately
after that judgment was delivered the Inter-State
Commerce Act was passed, and up to the present
time it has gone thus far : it prohibits any one rail-
way company from running at lower rates even
within a state on one lino or another, if the lino upon
which they arc taking the goods for a lower freight
is part of a line of communication running out of the
state. I would say that, on parallel grounds, if any
colony in Australia attempts to reduce its rates on its
own lines when that line is connected with another
line going into another state, and reduces the rates
for the purpose of drawing traffic from outside its
own borders —bringing goods from another state
within its own—it would come within the provisions
of an inter-state commerce act similar to that now in
force in America ; but so long as any state shall carry
goods absolutely within its own boundaries, and does
not attempt to attract traffic over its border, it could
not, of course, bo touched. How far the Inter-State
Commerce Act of America will be interpreted by the
Supreme Court of that country, and how far legisla-
tion under this sub-clause would be sustained in Aus-
tralia, is, of course, a matter of speculation. It is
impossible to say definitely what the power is. I
only know from the history of the act in America
that it is one of the widest powers given to the
federal government, and its future developments are
altogether unforeseen and immeasurable.
Mr. GORDON : It appears to me undesirable
that we should leave anything to the interpretation
of this sub-clause which, being admitted to be an
important principle, ought to be laid down in it. If,
whilst we are drafting this bill, we can possibly state
specifically an important point such as this, it is very
much better than to leave the interpretation of it to
the court, and I think that course will save a great
deal of trouble. I shall move an amendment to the
sub-clause.
Mr. DEAKIN: I hope the hon. member will not
move an amendment immediately. The question is
evidently one of the utmost deiicacy and difficulty,
and will require to be approached with the greatest
caution. lam so thoroughly in sympathy with the
hon. member in the object he has in view that I think
the clause merits, by its recommittal —if it is not
possible to postpone the subsection —the fullest
attention of the Convention. It is perfectly clear
from what the hon. member, Mr. Clark, has said, that
these words have an undefined significance in America,
which is valuable in one direction, but perilous in
another. lam sure that the states will jealously
resist any attempt to interfere with their management
of their own railways or their own affairs. Therefore,
if we desire to impinge upon that in any way for
federal purposes, we should make it perfectly clear
where the federal control begins, and where it ends,
and for what purposes it may be used. To do this, I
think, will necessitate an amendment of perhaps
some length, or, at all events, consideration of the
subject in all its parts with the greatest care; and I
would suggest that the hon. and learned member who
is in charge of the bill might see his way to put this
suggestion in a form which will fit in with the other
provisions of the bill. The sense of the Committee
should be taken generally upon the matter; and, if
it be in favour of the views of the hon. member, Mr.
Gordon, it might suit him just as well to leave the
particular form which the amendment should take to
the hon. member who has drafted the bill.
Mr. EITZGERALD: I quite concur in the
remarks which have just fallen from my hon, and
learned friend. I think that, considering the
magnitude of our railway systems and the importance
to the various states of the revenue from their
management, 110 point would be more fiercely con-
tested and opposed than interference by the federal
government in their management, unless on such
broad and patriotic ground that the justice of it
would be recognised by every state. I apprehend
that it is of the utmost importance that there should
be no possible doubt in the minds, not only of every
hon. member here, but also of any one outside, as to
the extent to which any interference in the manage-
ment and control of the railways could be brought to
bear by any federal authority.
Mr.'MOORE: I think that as far as this sub-
clause is concerned the difficulty could be met by the
excision of one word and the insertion of another
by striking out "among" and inserting " between,"
which will leave it perfectly clear what is to be
understood by the sub-clause. Then it would read:
"The regulation of trade and commerce with other
countries and between the several states." That
would not allow any interference with the internal
management of railways in any of the states, but
simply regulate the commerce between the several
states. I think that we ought to jealously guard the
autonomy of the several states, and therefore this
clause requires very careful consideration. I think
the suggestion I have made would meet the case.
Mr. EITZGERALD : It would not be broad enough !
Sir JOHN DOWNER: No doubt we ought to
carefully conserve the autonomy of every state, but
we ought also to be equally careful that the main
principle of this federation is carried out. This
matter when before the committee was thought to be
sufficiently met by clause 12, page 18. I suggest to
my hen. friend, Mr. Gordon,that he should carefully
consider that clause, and on that move any amend-
ment that may occur to him to bo necessary, for that
which is under the heading " equality of trade" is
the proper branch of the subject in which to deal
with this matter. 011 questions of doubt we ought
to be as specific as we can ; but as a general rule in
framing a constitution it is much better to use large
general words which are all-embracing, and take in
every branch of certain subjects, than to come down


to detail, and so limit the operation of the general
words. I fancy that the words in clause 12, page 18,
are sufficient; but if the lion, member who has
brought this matter before the Committee does not
think they are, I would suggest to him that that is the
place in which he should make any necessary amend-
ments.
Mr. WEIXON: I think there would be doubt as
to whether the words of the clause to which my hon.
friend refers are sufficiently precise to meet this par-
ticular case, especially if we bear in mind that the
only reference to railways is in subdivision 28 of this
clause, which gives control of the railways for one
particular purpose, and has nothing to do with the
question of border freights. There is that one point
Avhich wo want to reach —to prevent hostile tariffs on
the railways, and rivalry between the particular
states; and I think it is a matter for consideration
whether it might not be better to put in an amend-
ment of that alone —the particular thing we want—
rather than go into general words.
Sir JOHN DO WINER: So far as the internal
control of railways is concerned, we do not want to
interfere in the slightest degree, and sub-clause 28
was put in in order to give a limited control over the
railways in matters where the interests of the
commonwealth were concerned—in war questions,
and things of that kind.
Mr. Wrtxon: It does not touch this point!
Sir JOHN DOWNER: No, neither by extension
nor by limitation, and I do not think it will need to
be interfered with.
Mr. GORDON : I shall move the postponement
of the sub-clause. Looking at the matter from the
point of view of the colony of South Australia, it
appears to me that unless we have specifically stated
here the right given to the federal parliament to
control railways on certain lines we shall very likely
miss the whole coairaercial benefit of this federation.
I would ask the hon. and learned member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, and the Committee, whether if I move the
postponement of this sub-clause they will consider
the question ?
Mr. Playeoed : I do not think this is the place to
put it!
Mr. GORDON: In this sub-clause, dealing with the
regulation of trade and commerce, such an amend-
ment would naturally fall in with the scope of this
clause more clearly certainly than with the scope of
the clause which the hon. and learned member, Sir
John Downer, pointed out, uuder the heading,
“equality of trade.” There is no question of equality
of trade. It is a specific point which did not arise
in America, but which arises here, because of the
peculiar circumstances of these colonies. It is a
difficult question to determine right off, and if the
Committee will consider the question I will move the
postponement of the sub-clause.
Sir HENRY PARKES : I trust the hon. member
will not move his amendment right away. Clearly if
he desires to have this question submitted to the
Committee, ho ought to move his amendment in the
distinct shape of a sub-clause by itself. There is
nothing to prevent his talcing that reasonable course,
and he would be liable to do something which he does
not really intend if he were to mix it up with this
sub-clause. Let the hon. member frame a sub-clause
to come in at any place he has thought of, and submit
his view in a distinct form at a subsequent stage in
our consideration of the clause. There can bo no
objection to that.
Mr. Gordon : I accept the hon. member’s sug-
gestion !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I should like to know,
as far as possible, what it is the hon. gentleman is
driving at ? This matter has received the anxious
consideration of committees during the last fortnight,
and of the drafting committee specially in the choice
of words. There were long discussions in committee
on this point. Does the hon. member wish that the
federal parliament shall have general control of rail-
ways ?
Mr. Gordon : No !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: The hon. member
does not want the control of tariffs in the states at all.
An Hon. Member : Yes he does !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Well, what does he
want ?, Before you can attempt to formulate an idea,
you must know what the idea is.
Mr. GORDON: I will put my proposition in a
concrete form. Broken Hill, which belongs to the
colony of New South Wales, is on the South Aus-
tralian border. Wo will assume for the purposes of
this argument that to reach the sea-coast, we have to
travel 5300 miles from Broken Hill. The trade there
is very valuable to us. I have heard some New
South Welshmen say that it is very valuable to them.
If, notwithstanding that 390 miles of railway carriage
to reach the coast in South Australia, the New South
Wales Government chose to build a line which would
take 800 miles to reach the sea-coast, and to run
upon that line
Sir Henry Parkes: I knew it was some broad
federal thing!
Mr. GORDON; And to run upon that line at a
rate lower, or as low. as South Australia maintained
on their 300 miles of line, it would absolutely do
away with the whole of the benefits of free-trade.
It is a simple proposition. The hon. member sees it
as clearly as possible, and what I am aiming at is
that the federal parliament shall have power to
prevent the imposition of cut-throat railway rates, so
that each colony shall have the benefit of its own
geographical position as a port of shipment or a
depot.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Now I know the
hon. members idea, I may tell him that I considered
it in consultation with, amongst others, our lately
deceased colleague Mr. Macrossan, months ago, and we
came to the conclusion that the only form of words
that would express it was “control of railway tariffs.”
You will not find any shorter words to do it, if that
is what is meant. It is a fair issue for us —do we
intend to give the federal parliament control of
railway tariffs; or do we intend to let the states do
what they like? We must mean one or the other;
we cannot mean both. The two ideas are quite
opposed to one another, and there is no middle
course between them that I can see. Wo have tried
at various times to find expressions to indicate the
control of certain tariffs only ; for instance, the
control of lines of railway communicating from one
colony to another, leaving the states, of course,
absolute power with regard to local railways—and
wo have had very great difficulty in defining the
matter. Ido not think you will be able to use any
words except “ control of railway tariffs.” Well the
committee did not see their way to recommend any
such general proposal. The extent to which they did
see their way to make a recommendation is contained
in clause 12 of chapter iy, and it is not by absolutely
prohibiting anything of the kind from being done,
but by giving the parliament of the commonwealth
power to make a law to annul any law made by a
state which would really interfere with freedom,
which would be prohibitive of trade going through a
state to its natural port. That is the only extent to
which we could see our way to go.
Mr. Gordon : If you give the colonies the power,
why not say so f
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: We have given them
the power in those words. I can assure the hon.
gentleman that this section of chapter iv occupied
the committee for some hours, and I think that if he
will look at it he will find that it will bear very close
scrutiny.
Mr. DONALDSON: I think this discussion
touches upon one of the most important matters that


could be considered by the Convention. I have
long held the opinion that we cannot have complete
federation unless the whole of the debts of the xlus-
tralian colonies are taken over by the federation, and
also the public works. I am confident that the more
this is looked into the more will the fact impress
itself upon the minds of the Convention. I think
the federal parliament should have full power to
take over these debts and assets. "What has been
the greatest cause of friction between the different
colonies up to the present time P Nothing has caused
more friction than the practice of imposing differen-
tial railway rates, and so filching trade from a
neighbouring colony. That has been done for years
past, and the ill-feeling engendered has been intensi-
fied year by year, until it has become very strong
indeed ; in fact, I know of no other cause of strong
feeling between the people of these different com-
munities than that which has arisen from commerce.
If we attempt in the way suggested to interfere with
the tariffs of the various colonies, we shall at once
interfere w r ith state rights, because the colony owning
the railway will immediately say, "We wish to ruii our
lines on such commercial principles as will enable
them to pay interest on the cost of construction."
Some railways, if they were unduly interfered
with in regard to tariff, would not be able to com-
mand any trade at all. Take, for instance, the
railway that runs from Sydney to Bourke, about
500 miles in extent. If the rates upon that railway
were not low, nearly all the traffic would go down the
Darling, because every one knows that carriage by
steamer is much cheaper than carriage by railway.
At the present time very low rates are charged on
this railway for the purpose of bringing the trade to
Sydney. I need not, of course, go into particulars
now, but I question very much whether, owing to the
very low rates prevailing, this railway is made to pay.
Then, again, take the railway running down the
Murrumbidgee to Hay. We know that the rates are
very low upon that railway, and that it is worked at
a dead loss to the state. But at the same time a rail-
way has been constructed, and if we were to insist
upon a uniform rate per mile throughout the whole
of that district the railway would have hardly any
traffic at all, and the result would be a great loss to
the state. That, 1 maintain, would be unduly inter-
fering with the interests of the state, and would, of
course, cause very great fiiction. Let the federal
parliament have power to take over the whole of the
railways, and also the debts of the colonies, and things
will go on much smoother. While I agree with the
principles of the bill before us, and must give credit
to the sub-committee for the great care they have
exercised in its preparation, I am of opinion that it
does not go far enough. Some of the colonies think
their railways are such good property that they would
be doing an injury to themselves if they allowed them
to be taken over by the commonwealth. But I main-
tain that nothing of the kind will occur. They would
not lose anything, because they would not have to
pay the interest on the debt, for which they have to
provide at the present time, and the amount of money
they would receive in the shape of customs and other
revenue would be exactly the same as under the pre-
sent proposal. Eor some years, at all events, accounts
would be kept between the states, and the surplus re-
venue would be distributed in the way proposed under
this bill. This would include railway revenue as well
as customs revenue, and I am sure the system would
have a good effect upon the community generally.
Why should we wish to bring trade to any particular
port by running railways to the borders of another
colony, and there levying a differential railway rate?
Eor whose benefit? Merely for the benefit of the
persons who send their goods by that line, and a few
persons at the seaport to which the goods go. This
is the way some of our cities are built up at the cost
of the country. The complaint can be made with
regard to nearly all tlic country districts throughout
Australia, that large benefits are given to the capitals
at the expense of the country. If the whole of the
railways were under the control of the federal govern-
ment that would not be the case, because they would
be worked for the common good, and so as to bring
trade to its nearest port. Although this matter has
been considered by many members of the Convention,
I know they are not prepared at the present time to
consent that the colonies should give up their rail-
ways. But I venture to say that in the future this
question will bo a great bone of contention between
the various colonies, and I fear that federation, if it
takes place, will not have the good effect we desire
on that account. "Whilst on the subject of railways,
I might say a little more. I think there is not a
colony in the whole of the Australasian group that
has not got to its limit so far as railway construction
is concerned. There is no part of the world which,
for its population, has such an extent of railway
communication as exists in Australia. The progress
that has been made in this respect during the last
few years has been enormous. But all the railways
have been constructed out of borrowed money. Tew
of the lines of late years have paid interest on the
cost of construction. There is not a colony at the
present time in which the taxpayers have not to find
a considerable amount over and above the receipts
from their public works to pay the interest on the debt.
Mr. Plateoed : Yes !
Mr. DONALDSON : If South Australia is an
exception, she is the only exception.
Mr. Muneo : And Victoria !
Mr. DONALDSON: Victoria does not pay all
the interest on the loans.
Mr. Muneo ; She has done so !
Mr. DONALDSON: Cau the hon, gentleman tell
me in what year she did it ?
Mr. Muneo : A couple of years ago there w r as
£34,000 to the good !
Mr. DONALDSON; And strong questions have
been asked since about the way in which those
accounts were kept. I have been given to under-
stand that some charges were not made against the
account which should have been properly placed
against it, and I know that strong exception has
been taken to the correctness of the balance-sheet.
I do not wa'sh to make any charge, or to say anything
offensive about this matter, but I know that for the
present year the railways have not been a success in
Victoria.
Mr. Muneo : How does the hon. gentleman know ?
Mr. DONALDSON : I follow the accounts closely
enough to know that the railways are not paying the
interest on the cost of construction.
Mr. Muneo : They are coming right!
Mr. DONxiLDSON: And I venture to say that
if Victoria goes on in the way it has been dciug or
proposes to do, she will be greatly behind in the
next few years.
Mr. Gillies : Do not discuss the action of the
different colonies—they wall do as they think right!
Mr. DONALDSON: It is quite right that they
should, while things are in their present condition ;
but, taking all the colonies in a group, I venture to
say that the colonies have gone to the limit of their
borrowing powers, or very nearly so.
Hon. Members : No !
Mr. DONALDSON: That is my opinion, to which
I am going to adhere, notwdthstanding the great
number of noes I hear.
Mr. Mukeo ; They have only started.
Mr. DONALDSON: They have only started, but
they will have to give a better account in the future
for some of the works they carry out, or else the
English money-lender wall close his pocket against
them. At the present time there is considerable
difficulty in floating loans, and I am sure the difficulty
will be greater in the next few years,.


Dr. COCKBURX : Only a ring formed —that is all!
HON. MEMBERS : Question !
Mr. DONALDSON : I am speaking to the ques-
tion quite as much as the hon. gentleman who preceded
me. Of course if the chairman says I am out' of
order, I am quite prepared to sit down; but I think
considerable latitude should be allowed upon this
subject, which is a very wide one. It is certainly not
contained within the four corners of this bill, and it
should, I think, be included, in order to make the
federation perfect. I do not desire, however, to
express my opinion in such a way as to offend the
representatives of any colony. Railway construction,
I repeat, has been going on very rapidly, and all this
has been done with borrowed capital. We have been
spending altogether, I suppose, in Australia from
£6,000,000 to £L(),000,000 per annum.
Colonel SMITH : Not all borrowed capital!
Mr. DONALDSON : Nearly all. lam aware that
some of the Victorian railways have been constructed
out of receipts from land sales. Are we able to spend
at this rate in the future ? I know perfectly well
the difficulty there has been in restraining the con-
struction of railways. I have had sufficient experi-
ence of that. Rings are formed for the purpose of
getting railways built, and I question if some of the
railways are going to be profitable to the states. If
the railways are placed under the control of the
federation I am sure that a good case will have to
be made out before the construction of any railway
is undertaken—and it will, I believe, be for the salva-
tion of Australia generally. If we go on expending
million after million of money on railways which
will not be profitable, we shall land ourselves in such
a position that the burdens of the taxpayers will have
to be increased to an enormous extent in order to
meet the loss on the undertakings. My purpose will
be perfectly served by a discussion of the question,
whether or not the whole of the railways should
belong to the federation ? I am in a minority, but
I venture to say that before a great number of years
are over our heads the opinion will strongly prevail
that the whole of the public works of the colonies,
along with the public debts, should belong to the
federation. See another advantage that we would
have in regard to the present as well as future
debts : The federation will, I am sure, be able to
borrow at a much lower rate of interest than the
colonies can borrow at now. There Avould be a
considerable saving in the percentage, as the hon.
member, Mr. McMillan, showed the other day. If
we interfere largely —and we are unduly interfering,
I maintain —with the states by taking away their
customs revenue, a great deal of that money will be
spent on the cost of government, and the states will have
no control over that money, except the balance
which they will get back from the federal parliament.
The federal government may be extravagant, for
my experience is that nearly all governments com-
manding large surpluses are extravagant. They may
have the control of £8,000,000 or £10,000,000, and
need spend only £2,000,000; but what is to prevent
them from spending £3,000,000 and distributing only
£7,000,000 amongst the various states ? That is
going to be a real bone of contention in the future;
and it would be far better, therefore, to give the
control of the railways to the federal parliament. I
feel that I am in a delicate position, inasmuch as the
railways of Queensland are not paying as well as the
railways of other colonies; but at the same time there
would be a small sum to be paid back to that state,
because it would be deducted from the customs
revenue. However, I believe this question has been
considered in a cursory way by hon. members. I feel
that they have made up their minds on the question,
and that the railways are not going to become the
property of the federation. Of course, as an indi-
vidual member, I accept that position; but at the
same time I take this opportunity of saying that I do
not believe tbe federation will ever be complete until
the public works of tbe various colonies are handed
over to the control of the commonwealth.
Sub-clause agi’eed to.
Sub-clause 3. Raising money by any other mode or system
of taxation ; but so that all such taxation shall be uniform
throughout the commonwealth.
Sir HARRY ATKINSON": Do I understand that
the Convention is prepared to give to the federal
parliament the power of levying taxation, without at
the same time taking over the debts of the colonies ?
I venture to say that, if you do, there must of
necessity be several bankrupt colonies before long,
because you take away the power of taxation which
each colony possesses. I want to know, if you take
away the power from our state parliament to levy
customs duties, how the state can raise sufficient
revenue to pay its way ? If any one can tell me, I
shall be happy to hear the answer.
Mr. McMillan : Direct taxation!
Sir HARRY" ATKINSON: The charge now im-
posed upon all property in New Zealand is Id. in the
£. I say we could not tax property to any greater ex-
tent than that without driving a large portion of our
movable capital into other colonies where it would
receive much better interest for present investment.
That is a serious point which I venture to say will
apply to other colonies in the same way. Ido not
wush to raise any unreasonable discussion; but
I should not be doing my duty to my colony if I
did not point out at this time that, unless we are pre-
jiared to take over the liabilities when w r e are taking
over the power of taxation, avc can never have a
satisfactory federation, because, I say, as one with
every desire to raise the money in the colony, it can-
not be done ; and I speak with some authority on the
question. If w r e are not ripe to take over the respon-
sibilities of the colonies, then we cannot possibly
take over the right of unlimited taxation, because it
would take away the power of a colony to fulfil its
obligations with the outside world.
Sir JOHN BRAY : I think there is a great deal
in the point raised by the hon. member, Sir Harry
Atkinson. I think w r e ought seriously to consider
whether we shall give this power of additional taxa-
tion unless we are prepared to say that the federa-
tion shall take over a good deal more of the
responsibilities of the different colonies than avo
suggest they should do at the present time. There
is no doubt whatever that the difficulty will be great
in the appropriation of this money. At the present
time w r e do not propose to impose on the common-
wealth the duty of appropriating more than about a
third, at the outside, of the revenue which they
will receive from customs duties. 1 think we
are rather premature in authorising the common-
wealth to impose unlimited taxation in any manner
they please in addition to imposing customs duties.
It seems to me that we ought to withhold this power
until Ave are prepared to giA r e them some duties to
discharge in connection Avith it. lam not prepared
to adopt the suggestion of my hon, friend, Mr.
Donaldson, that the railways of the different colonies
should be taken over entirely by the commonwealth ;
but I do say that Avhen avc are proposing to authorise
the collection of customs duties amounting in all
probability to £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 a year, we
ought to impose on the federal government the duty
of spending that money for the benefit of the com-
monwealth. We ought not for a moment to entertain
the idea of giving the power of collecting so much
larger an amount of revenue than is required, with
the intention of afterAvards returning it to the
seA r eral colonies by some unscientific method. I shall
be glad to hear from any member of the Constitu-
tional Committee Avhy they have proposed this general
poAver of imposing taxation. It seems to me entirely
unnecessary. Personally, I feel that we ought not
to give the federal parliament this poAver unless we


know to a greater extent than we do at the present
time the purposes to which the revenue is to be
applied.
Mr. McMILLAN : It seems to me that if you
are about to create a federal body with sovereign
power, it cannot be limited in its power of taxation.
It is part and parcel of the case that you cannot
dictate in any sense or particular the class of taxa-
tion that shall take place in the future. We have
given over the customs revenue, and no doubt there
will be a surplus. It seems to me, however, that you
may go too far, and do too much as well as too
little. In framing this constitution, I think the
power to deal in the future, say, with the rail-
ways or with the national debts of the colonies,
and all these other matters, ought to be left
to the possible evolution of the constitution, for no
doubt when it is framed all the elements of public
life in these colonies will be brought into one focus.
Those questions which we see from a local aspect
will have a more general aspect, as far as the whole
of Australia is concerned ; and to limit the greatest
and necessary power of any state, the power of
taxation, which lies at the bottom to a certain extent
of all government, would be to at once stultify the
whole constitution you bring into existence. Not-
withstanding the many fears wdiich may possess those
representing certain colonies, it seems to me that we
are going into this federation with the hope that the
central power will be animated by a sense of justice
to the whole of the colonies, and it would certainly be
a step backwards, and we should at the same time
practically stultify the whole of our work, if we were
to stop short of the sovereign power necessary to the
creation of a state. It also occurs to me that we are
liable in this case if we omit powers of direct taxation
to enunciate a policy which has no right to be
enunciated at the present stage of our procedure. I
am not sure that we should not by our very silence
enunciate the policy that there should be no direct
taxation in the sovereign state.
Sir John Brat : Strike out the words !
Mr. McMILLA.N; The matter is one upon which
I see no possibility of unanimity of opinion, and to
strike out the general power of taxation would, to my
mind, be practically bringing these proceedings to a
close at once. It is an absolute necessity that this
power should be vested in the sovereign state irre-
spective of the consequences.
Mr. BAKER: I would remind the hon. member,
Sir John Bray, that every power ought to be com-
mensurate with its object, and that there ought to
be no limitation of power to effect an object which is
in itself incapable of limitation. Who can pretend
to say what the result of this federation will be in
time to come ? We may have to spend our last
shilling or to sacrifice our last man in our own de-
fence. We do not know what the expenditure of
the federal government may be, and to limit the
power of taxation would be to altogether misunder-
stand a fundamental principle of government. It is
utterly impossible in a federal form of government
to attempt to limit the power of taxation in any way
whatever.
Captain RUSSELL : I think the last two speakers
have failed altogether to appreciate the point raised
by my hon. colleague, Sir Harry Atkinson. I did
not by any means understand him to say that he did
not approve of a system of direct taxation forming
part of the taxation of the commonwealth. But he
did raise the practical question as to what would be-
come of individual states if you took away from
those states one of their chief means of raising
revenue ? If you take away this means of raising
revenue, you deprive certain colonies of the means
wherewith to discharge their liabilities. How is it
possible to get away from the fact that in this clause
it is proposed to grant to the commonwealth power
to take away from the colonies every penny of the
revenue they now derive from customs'? There are
enormous responsibilities resting upon every colony,
and they must bo met. What my hon. colleague
wanted to point out was not that the commonwealth
should not have absolute power in the matter of
taxation ; but that having that power, it should also
take over proportionate responsibilities. If, in other
words, you take away from the several colonies the
means of paying their debts, it is evident that you
put them in a position of being unable to meet their
liabilities. Being unable to raise taxation sufficient
to pay the interest on the money they have borrowed,
they will, as my hon. colleague suggested, be reduced
to a position of bankruptcy.
Mr. PLAYEORD : We are not considering, at the
present moment, what responsibilities we "will take
over from the several colonies. The question we are
considering is the power we will give to the parlia-
ment of the commonwealth in the matter of taxation ;
and so far as my reading extends, no commonwealth
in the world has existed, or can exist, without possess-
ing unlimited power of taxation. It is so in the case
of the United States, in the case of Canada, and also
in the cases of Grermany and Switzerland. If you take
away the general power, and draw the line at customs
and excise duties, then those who believe in a free-
trade policy will have no hope whatever of being able
to give effect to that policy. We want the people of
these colonies to be perfectly free so far as taxation
under the commonwealth is concerned to decide what
form or mode of taxation they will adopt for the
raising of the necessary revenue. If you limit the
power of the commonwealth in the way suggested,
those who hold free-trade views will never be able to
give effect to them.
Mr. THYNNE; It seems to me that the point
raised by the hon. member, Sir Harry Atkinson, does
come within this clause, for there can be no doubt
that in giving to the federal parliament these powers
we must necessarily give to it the power to take
advantage of every resource of the colonies when it
may become necessary to meet the stress of times.
We must, at the same time, consider that we are by
one of these sub-clauses taking away from the several
states their principal sources of revenue. I would
remind the hon. member, Mr. Playford, that this
source of revenue is now pledged by each colony to
its debenture holders, and we are proposing to take
away from the debenture holders a security pledged
to them, and to hand it over to a body which will not
be under the control of the several states,
Mr. EitzGteeald : We are giving a first mortgage.
Mr. THYNNE : Since the hon. member refers to
mortgage, I would say that we are postponing to an
unlimited extent, at the pleasure of the federal par-
liament, a first charge, which the debenture holders
have upon a portion of our revenues,
Mr. McMillan : There is no such charge; the
credit of the state is involved !
Mr. THYNNE : If the credit of the state is
pledged its revenue is pledged, and in many loan acts
I think the expression “ first charge upon the
revenues of the colony” is used,
Mr. McMillan : Only in one act!
Mr. THYNNE: The colonies are now proposing
to give away this security, and the consequence will
be, as suggested by the hon. member, Sir Harry
Atkinson, that any one of the colonies being unable
from misfortune to meet its engagements with its
creditor, the federal parliament will of necessity and
duty be bound to come to the rescue and take the
responsibility upon itself.
Mr. Plxyfoei) : There is no harm in that!
Mr. THYNNE : That may be ; but it is very much
better that we should make provision for it now, and
not after the credit of any one of the states has been
injured.
Mr. Platfoed : It will come in later on in the bill!


Mr. THYNNE: At this stage, when we are dis-
cussing the powers of the federal parliament, every
portion of the bill comes more or less under our
review. I take it that w r e can now refer to any
portion of the measure, and that we can compare
with this, its central clause, any other provision. If
we take away from the colonies their principal sources
of revenue, we must also take upon ourselves the
responsibilities of those colonies.
Mr. BIRD: Although it be quite true, as the hon,
member, Mr. Playford, has put it, that we are not
now discussing directly the responsibilities we are
going to hand over to the federal government, yet
the question is so intimately associated with the
powers of taxation we are going to confer upon that
government that it has been very properly raised by
the hon. member, Sir Harry Atkinson. If we w r ero
going to limit in this particular bill the responsi-
bilities which the federal government are to have
thrust upon them, it might be well to limit their
powers of taxation ; but inasmuch as their responsi-
bilities are not limited, and may be, I hope, far in
excess of anything which this’bill indicates, it be-
comes a question for consideration whether we ought
not to do what has been done in every other federa-
tion that I know of—that is, to confer on the federal
body full powers of taxation. It would be a weak
and helpless thing if it had not the power to raise
all that is required for the fulfilment of its obliga-
tions. I hold strongly that, together with this power
of taxation proposed to be given in this clause, there
should be thrust upon the federal government the
whole obligation for the debts of the colonies. No
doubt some arrangement will have to be made to give
compensation to those colonies whose debts are small.
Unless we take that course, we are proposing to give to
the federal government far more revenue than we need
give to it. We shall only want about £2,000,000 for
federal expenditure, while we shall be giving the
federal government about £10,000,000. It seems
absurd to give the federal government power to collect
£10,000,000 that it may have the pleasure of handing
back £8,000,000. Until full provision is made for the
working of a uniform tariff and the fulfilment of all
the obligations which shall eventually be permanently
thrust upon the federal government, I should prefer
that the federal revenue should be secured by a con-
tribution levied upon the various colonies. If we
pass this clause, we can only reasonably do so in
view of our intention to impose upon the federal
government the obligation of discharging the lia-
bilities of the colonies with regard to their public
debts. I trust that the clause as now before us will
be agreed to, and that in that we shall have to some
extent an indication of the determination of the Con-
vention to impose upon the federal government before
we have done with this bill the obligation of the debts
of the colonies.
Mr. DEAKIN : It is useless for the Convention to
impose upon the commonwealth any duties which the
several states are not prepared to surrender. What
the hon. member assumes as the premiss of his argu-
ment is, that the several colonies will be only too
willing to hand over their railways and other public
works to the federal government.
Mr. Bird : No ; that they should hand over their
debts!
Mr. DEAKIN: The proposition, as amended by
the hon. member, is much simpler and much more
tempting to the colonies. That is, they should keep
their assets and hand over their liabilities. The
proposition would be much more tempting to the
colonies than to the federal government.
, Mr - Claek : Figures show that it is quite prac-
ticable.
Mr. DEAKIN: I did not rise, however, for the
purpose of entering into these questions, because,
although they are related to the matter in hand, they
do not appear to be very pertinent. The special
purpose for which I rose was to protest against the
inadvertent use of language which even, in the
course of debate, may lead us into serious diffi-
culties. Not one, hut several hon. members, have
used the phrase that this clause would “ take
away” the power of taxation at present pos-
sessed by the several states. I can imagine
nothing more calamitous than that such an idea should
be adopted by any of the communities that compose
Australasia. This clause could not possibly, except
in the narrowest and most restricted meaning of the
word, take away any power of taxation from any
colony. Suppose this clause is passed, the same
unlimited power of taxation as is possessed at the
present time by the colonies will be retained by them
in every respect, except as regards duties of customs
or excise. With regard to direct taxation, which
we are more particularly discussing, the colonies will
possess in future every power which they now
possess. Consequently, no power is taken away
except the power of imposing duties of customs or
excis?. Neither is it fair to say that the creditors of
the colonies are losing the priority of their mortgage
on the assets of the colonies. There is nothing in
this clause which will give the federal tax-gatherer
any priority over the state tax-gatherer. On the
contrary, in the natural order of things, owing to the
transference of the customs revenue to the central
government, the several colonies, or some of them,
may be brought face to face with the question of
direct taxation, long before such a question is likely
to be raised in the parliament of the commonwealth.
Consequently the direct taxation will be in existence
in the colonies before it can be imposed by the com-
monwealth. The commonwealth will find, therefore,
that the priority in time will have been gained by the
states. In no part of this clause is priority given to
the federal government in the matter of the right
of levy. All that can be said is that necessarily
there is a certain point at which the taxable
resources of the community will cease, and that
when powers of taxation are possessed by the com-
monwealth there will be less revenue for the
colony which at present has the sole power of taxa-
tion. That is undoubtedly true ; but that is a point
at which we are never likely to arrive. What is
proposed to be given in this clause is that unlimited
power of taxation which must accompany the un-
limited responsibilities of the commonwealth. One
of the foremost of its duties, that in fact which
created this Convention, was to provide for the
common defence of Australasia, and it may be
necessary to devote not only the last ship, but the
last shilling to that object. It is impossible to cast the
duty of defence on the government of the common-
wealth without giving them unlimited taxing power.
An Hon. Member: In the case of a blockade,
there would not be much income !
Mr. DEAKIN : All the more reason for granting
unlimited powers of taxation. If one source of
revenue is cut off, they should certainly have another.
However much force there may be in Sir Harry
Atkinson s contention that it will be necessary for
the federal parliament, if it gets the revenue of all
the colonies, to consider the question of taking
over their liabilities, it does not follow that
we in this Convention should attempt to de-
termine what are the liabilities which the common-
wrealth should accept. We are bound to prepare
such a constitution as will enable the common-
wealth to come into existence on terms fair to all
the colonies; but we are not authorised to go one
step further. We are not called upon to undertake
what will be the duty of the federal parliament, or
to discover what particular expedients should be
resorted to. We provide hereafter one source of
revenue of which the colonies are to be deprived—the
customs revenue; and we provide a certain method by
which any surplus remaining after the payment of the


obligations of the commonwealth may be disposed of
so that the several colonies will be justly dealt with.
Whether the particular proposal in the bill is or is not
the best, the fact remains that Ave have provided a
safety-valve so that in the rather unlikely event of there
being a surplus for a length of time we can deal with
it. In the constitution there already exists not only
special powers Avith Avhich the commonvA r ealth is
endowed, but there is the power of referring other
matters to the commonwealth by the colonies. I
hope Ave shall secure the privilege to the several
colonies of requesting the federal parliament, with
the consent of all the states, to take over their
railways or other public vvorks, or do any other
matter or thing which all the states may agree is
desirable in the interests of the whole people. All
that should be possible. Under the bill the federal
parliament should be able at the instance of the
states to undertake any or all such obligations. It
is a much wiser course to give that Avide latitude of
choice, than to attempt now to forecast the future,
and to determine Avhat it shall or shall not take over.
AUe were not sent here for that purpose, and the
federal parliament of the future will not thank us
for attempting to anticipate AA r hat they should do.
AVhat will the federal parliament be ? It will not
bf% as some members seem to infer, a foreign body,
taxing the people of the colonies without regard to
their obligations or the debts already incurred. The
same constituents avlio return the members of the
local parliaments will be the people who Avill re-
turn the members of the house of representatives,
Avhich will have the sole right of initiating
taxation. And are avc to suppose that the people
having once taxed themsrlves through their several
legislatures will again Avish to impose taxes for the
mere pleasure of taxing ? Have we ever found any
of our constituents so anxious to increase their bur-
dens that avc should expect to find them insisting upon
their representatives laying heavy taxes upon them
for purposes not clearly and absolutely defined ?
An Hon. Member : One kind of taxation might
suit one colony, and not another !
Mr. DEAKIN: That is possible ; but there can
bo no difference as to the taxpayers’ interests as
between one colony and another. It can never be
the interest of a man to pay more taxes than he can
help. If the hon. member thinks that because a
citizen belongs to a community Avith a larger area he
is more ready to put his hands into his breeches’
pocket, his experience has been limited in respect to
taxation.
Mr. Maemton : What I say is that one kind of
taxation might suit one state, and that another kind
might suit another state !
Mr. DEAKIN; That is true ; but it is foreign to
the issue. Surely we need feel no alarm in endowing
the commonwealth w r ith these large powers of taxa-
tion, since they can only be exercised wlien the need
commends itself to the people of the commomvealth,
Avho are also the people of the several states whose lot
we are asked to commiserate.
Mr. EitzGeeald : And when you have an upper
house to control it ?
Mr. DEAKIN : I think it is unkind, Avhen strug-
gling with one misfortune, to be reminded of another.
The difficulty of dealing Avith taxation cannot be
mitigated by remembering that we have an upper
house. I rose simply to point out that if these
debates are, as they will be, criticised by the enemies
of federation, it is desirable that our language should
be as accurate as possible, and avc should hasten
to explain even apparent misconceptions which may
arise from the language of hon. members. I rose to
show that we are not taking anything away from the
colonies, not injuring their credit, and also that this
alarm as to the exercise of the power of taxation by
the commonwealth is greatly dissipated by the recol-
lection that it is the people of the states who will
compose the commonwealth, and who will tax them-
selves. We may rely, therefore, in giving them these
ample powers on their not using them against them-
selves. Members have spoken of the commonwealth as
if it was outside Australasia; but the commonwealth
will be the people of Australasia. The power of
taxation will only be exercised with the conseut of
the people of Australasia; and we need not fear its
exercise. It will only be enforced when such an im-
perative need arises as will commend it to the people
of the country, who will return representatives to
parliament for the purpose of imposing special
taxation for the special ends which they have in view.
We have not to protect the people of the federated
states against themselves, and there is certainly no
one else to protect them against in this regard. The
commonwealth consists of the people ; and this power
of taxation can only be exercised by and with the
consent of the people.
Mr. THYNNE: Before the clause is passed I
would like to reply to the argument of the hon.
member, Mr. Deakin. He stated that in certain
circumstances the power of taxation by the local
state parliaments would be undoubtedly affected by
the provisions of the bill. In clause 3, chapter y, it
is provided that Avhen the law of the state is incon-
sistent with the law of the commonwealth, the law of
the commonwealth shall prevail. It is quite easy to
realise circumstances under which a tax, say upon
land, might be imposed by the state, and made a first
charge upon property, and a similar impost might be
levied by the commonwealth; but the state law!
would have to come second, and the commonwealth]
would, therefore, have the first helping out of thel
fund for providing that particular tax.
Mr. Deakin : That is quite possible ;
Mr. THTNNE: It is quite possible, and of course,
in theory, it is quite feasible. There is another
matter to which 1 intended to refer a little earlier.
It would be a great pity if we had in the bill any
provision which would tend to raise opposition to its
provisions when going through the Imperial Parlia-
ment, and I am quite sure that unless we make some
provision here by w’hich the rights of our several
states’ creditors are sufficiently protected, the Imperial
Parliament will be inclined, and I think justified, in
taking some steps to procure the necessary security.
My own opinion is that the federation could very
well take over the debts of the several states, looking
to the customs for the means of paying them without
interfering with the state management of the rail-
ways.
Mr. BURGESS ; I must confess that I think it is
very expedient that full provision should be made in
connection with our finance matters —and, mark you,
this clause really touches upon finance—and that the
federal government should take noon itself some
further obligations than those that aie proposed. At
the present time the federal government takes upon
itself simply the cost of the civil government and
finance, and for that purpose they have placed at
their disposal a sum based upon what might be called
a protective tariff. I think it would be absolutely
necessary to enforce such a tariff if ever we
were to have federation of the colonies. This would
place in their hands a sum of over £9,000,000.
JN r ow, Ave know that all colonial governments, and
I presume that the same remark Avould apply to
the federal government, having such an enormous
surplus as there would be under such cir-
cumstances, and not being tied down in any way,
Avould certainly be liable to become extravagant, and
it would, therefore, be wise and well on our part to,
as far as possible, guard against that extravagance.
I think we can Aveli guard against it, and I belieA r e
that the objection to which the hon. member, Mr.
Thynne, referred can be removed if, in' connection
with this matter, we authorise the federal govern-
ment to take over the various responsibilities AA'hich


we have in connection with our colonial indebted-
ness. If any one will take the trouble to look into
the subject as the members of the Finance Com-
mittee did, they will find that the sum at the
disposal of the federal government, after making full
provision for all ordinary expenses, will fully cover
the amount of interest that would be payable upon
the total indebtedness. At all events, I am quite
convinced that it is so within a very small sum
indeed, and it would then be merely necessary on
the part of the federal government to state what
should be the mean indebtedness of the colonies
which it should take over, and then either to debit
or to credit those colonies, according to the amount
of their specific indebtedness. In matters of this
kind we cannot be too careful. Let us recollect that
one of the principal objections that will possibly be
raised by some of our fellow-colonists in connection
with this movement will be, that we are calling upon
them for an additional sum for general government,
and they will naturally ask, “ What are you going to
give us in return for this ; if we are to be called
upon for extra taxation, what are you going to give us
in return? ” And unless we can show, as we ought
to show, that there are some distinct advantages to
be gained, I think that in many of the colonies strong
objections will be raised. In connection with this
matter, the remarks of Sir Harry Atkinson must
not be overlooked. Taxation through customs is
the sheet-anchor of all our colonial finance ; and if
we hand over all rights in connection with customs
and excise, it will be a matter of extreme difficulty,
to put it in mild language, for some of the colonies,
more particularly those colonies that have already
had to resort to direct taxation, to carry on their
respective governments. I trust, therefore, that
whilst we are considering this sub-clause, hon. mem-
bers will bear in mind the very great importance
of the subject, and that if we do not make pro-
vision for it now, special care will be taken to do so
later on.
Mr. DONA.LDSON; This is a subject that is
worthy of the fullest consideration and discussion.
It would certainly be absurd to try to limit the
powers of the federal parliament. Wo cannot do
that. Any parliament, to be effective in the future,
must have the full power to be able to levy whatever
taxation they require to carry on the government of
the country. We have not the slightest idea noAV
what will be required in the future. Therefore,
we must trust all these poAvers to the parliament.
Looking at the matter in regard to the immediate
future, we have to bear in mind that, according to
the proposals as Ave are now dealing with them, the
federal parliament will collect from customs from
£8,000,000 to £0,000,000; and, according to the
information we haA r e obtained, the total expenditure
will be only about £2,500,000. Of course that would
mean that a large surplus would have to be handed
back to the states in proportion to the amount Avhich
had been contributed by them. That is fair enough,
so far as it goes ; although I fear that in the future
it will cause some trouble, and, as the hon. member,
Mr. Burgess, has pointed out, any parliament
having such a large surplus as that is very likely to
be extravagant. We know that the states have no
control Avhatever, nor should they have control,
over the expenditure of the federal parliament. The
federal parliament should do whatever they please
Avith the money, although there-is an understanding
that any surplus should be handed back. But not
having obligations, as all the stales have at present,
of providing interest on loans, hoAv do avc know the
position the federal parliament may take up by-
and-by ? Supposing the federal parliament were
dominated by free-traders, They might say, “There
is no necessity to levy large customs duties; avo av ill
reduce them one-half.” At the same time they might
submit a scheme embodying a direct form of tax a-
tion. As was pointed out by the hon. member, Mr.
Thynne, they might go in for a land tax. The states
will then be left in this position: That, getting back
a smaller amount than they anticipated from the
federal parliament, they will not have sufficient to
pay the interest on their loans. They will therefore
be cut off, in the first instance, by not being able
to levy customs and excise duties ; and if they are
compelled to raise money by other means they will
probably have to double or treble the direct taxation
of the people of the state. That is an awkward
position in which to be placed, and it is one that is
worthy of the gravest consideration. Ido not think
any form of federation will be complete or satisfac-
tory, unless the debts at least of the whole of the
states are taken over by the federal government.
Mr, DIBBS : I move as an amendment:
That after the word “money,” line 1, the words “if
required for defence purposes in time of war ” be inserted.
I move this amendment for the purpose of limiting
the power of the federal government. Where the
customs and excise revenue will provide £8,500,000
a year, and where the probable expenditure in time
of peace is £2,500,000 a year, there is no necessity
to allow the indiscriminate power provided in the
sub-clause.
Mr. MUNRO : Perhaps, if I call the attention of
the hon. member to another clause in the proposed
constitution bill, he will see that his amendment will
not only not be required, but that it will really act
against the intentions of all those gentlemen who
wish the federal parliament eventually to take over
the debts of the various states. It is stated in
clause 13, chapter iv—
The parliament of the commonwealth may, with the con-
sent of the parliaments of all the states, make laws for taking
over and consolidating the whole or any part of the public
debt of any state or states, but so that a state shall be liable
to indemnify the commonwealth in respect of the amount of
a debt taken over, and that the amount of interest payable
in respect of a debt shall be deducted and retained from time
to time from the share of the surplus revenue of the common-
wealth which would otherwise be payable to the state.
Therefore, if the lion, gentleman confines this power
to raising money by any other mode of taxation only
in case of war, all that is intended to be done in the
clause I have referred to will be defeated. I think
the best plan is to allow the sub-clause to stand as
it is, and if any further amendment is required it can
be made in the 13th clause of chapter iv. The
intention of the framers of the constitution has been
to make the constitution as flexible as possible, so
that arrangements can be made between the various
states and the commonwealth when the time comes
to make them.
Amendment negatived; sub-clause agreed to.
Sub-clause 4. Borrowing money on the public credit of the
commonwealth.
Colonel SMITH: I purposely abstained from
addressing myself to the last sub-clause, because the
whole question of the new dominion is involved in
their borrowing power, and this sub-section deals
with that point. I thoroughly concur with what
fell from the hon. member, Mr. Bird, the Colonial
Treasurer of Tasmania, and from the other hon.
members sitting behind him. I think we should take
power in this sub-clause to enable the dominion
government to borrow sufficient to consolidate the
whole of the debts of all the colonies. I venture to
say that if that power is given they will raise quite
sufficient money from customs and excise, without
touching one penny of the railway revenue of any
one of the colonies.- They will be enabled to do
what is required by a system of taxation from customs
—a plan that has been adopted by every federal
government that has ever been formed in the world
up to the present moment.
Mr. BuitGESS ; And excise !


Colonel SMITH : It has been done in the case of
Germany. When their revenue was less than
£6,000,000 a year they increased it from that source
alone up to £26,000,000 per annum. What was the
result ? All the states were brought into the union
without any pressure, without any special taxation
being placed upon them, and they came into it in the
pleasantest possible manner. The various colonies,
I suppose I am within bounds when I say, are now
paying on an average 4 per cent. If we allow the
dominion parliament to take something like
£9,000,000 for the purpose of paying back £7,000,000,
I agree with some hon. member who said it is the
most clumsy way of doing it. I think that with the
money which they receive they should have the
obligation of consolidating the whole of the debts of
the colonies. If they consolidate the whole of the
debts of the colonies, I agree with the hon. member,
Mr. McMillan, that they will be enabled to borrow
very advantageously upon the whole territory of the
Australian dominion —upon all their revenue, be-
cause that virtually will be in their hands. It
will not disarrange the finances of the country
by adopting a system of this description, and all
the colonies will be anxious to come into the
federation, because the dominion will be able to
borrow on the security of the entire colonies —the
enormous public properties they possess —within %
per cent, of, or at all events something near, what
consols are now in London. We should be enabled
to do this by having a dominion parliament, with
power to impose taxation, if it is necessary, beyond
the amount at which the debts of all the colonies
would be consolidated, and the dominion would take
the responsibility with the funds that we are going
to give to them. We are giving them, I think, within
a few hundred pounds —certainly within £1,000,060
—of what would be necessary to pay the interest on
the whole of the national debt of the Australian
colonies, and I say that all the colonies then would
be anxious to come in. It is merely a question of
accounts —merely a question of sending to the under-
treasurers of the various colonies, and getting them
to meet together to decide how each colony stands
as regards the others —merely a matter of arrange-
ment. It was so in Canada. Exactly that process
was adopted in Canada. Some portions of Canada
borrowed more than others, and the matter was
adjusted, and it ought to be adjusted here. I would
ask the hon. and learned member, Sir Samuel Griffith,
and the other gentlemen who are dealing with this
matter, whether they could not give powers, not only
for borrowing money on the public credit of the
commonwealth, but also for the purpose of paying
interest on the whole of the indebtedness of the
whole of the colonies ?
Sir Samuel Geiffith : This covers everything!
Colonel SMITH: I should like a special clause
inserted, because I think it is most undesirable that
we should hand to the dominion parliament some-
thing like £9,000,000 with a view to their giving
back £7,000,000. We ought to consolidate the whole
of the indebtedness of the colonies, and if we con-
solidate the whole of the indebtedness of the colonies,
I venture to say there will not be the slightest diffi-
culty in getting them to come into the federation,
because then they would understand that, with the
money handed over to the dominion the obligations
would be met, and the advantages would at once
be manifest. Supposing the dominion borrowed
£20,000,000, there would be a saving of □- per cent,
interest, which would amount to £500,000 in a year.
Probably w r e might get it for something less, but I
thorouglily agree with the hon. member, Mr. McMillan,
that the dominion will be able to borrow money at 3
per cent. English consols we know are less than
that; and I believe that we should borrow' money,
not only at 3 per cent., but also at par, wdiich would
be a manifest advantage. I venture to say that
within a few years that could be done, which means
that we would get £ LOO for every £IOO debenture,
and pay 3 per cent, upon it. I would ask hon. dele-
gates to think this matter over. I think that we
ought to make it compulsory that the whole of the
indebtedness of the colonies should be adjusted, and
that the dominion parliament would express its
willingness, and should have the power conferred
upon it, to do this, and then we should disarrange the
finances in the least possible way. Every colony
knows what it is paying for interest now ; and if
that is paid for them on an adjustment that could
be easily settled by competent accountants, I believe,
as I said before, it would be a great advantage,
and all the colonies would be anxious to join, be-
cause they would get public money much cheaper,
and the dominion parliament would have the power
that is conferred in the last sub-clause to impose
taxation if the revenues from the custom and excise
were not sufficient. I think that if that were done
the sting of the last clause would be taken away,
because under the last clause we have given them
power to impose any taxation they please; and my
hope and belief is that the effect of the last clause
will be this: if they have to pay the public interest
due upon all the indebtedness of all the colonies,
they will take care that they get enough from the
customs and excise to do it. That is one reason why
I am very anxious to see, if possible, this power con-
ferred with the view of its being exercised. If I
had my way, I would make it compulsory that they
should exercise it within a reasonable time. It would
meet one great difficulty that I have seen all through
the proceedings of this Convention, and that is, that,
in having a uniform tariff, they will not be desirous
of imposing direct taxation : and I think it is very
undesirable they should impose direct taxation. We
know that nothing has been resisted so much in any
of these colonies from time to time as attempts at
direct taxation. The human family seems to be con-
stituted like this : you can put as much as you like
on the customs ; and when people pay duties on their
daily food and garments, they do not think much
about the matter; but ask them for half the amount
direct, and there is at once great objection. There-
fore, I am glad to hear, if it be agreed, that that
power is given; but, I should like some clause inserted
in the bill, which would make that compulsory on the
dominion taking over £9,006,000, which I venture to
say they will be enabled to increase from £9,000,000
to £12,000,00U by an adjustment of the tariff that
will be oppressive to none and equal to all. Once
it is known that that power was not only conferred
upon them, but also that they must exercise it within
a reasonable time, I say federation is accomplished.
You do not disturb the finances of the treasurer of any
of the colonies. With the money that we hand over to
the central government, at the same time we say, "Now
you must pay our interest; you must adjust our
accounts; you must see how much we borrowed
more than someone else, and adjust the matter." I
say that what has been done in Canada, an English-
speaking community, under the British Crown, we
can and ought to do here. I quite concur with the
hon. member, Mr. Bird, that we ought not to hand
over to the commonwealth more money than it re-
quires. In asking each colony to contribute its
share, the difficulty would be that one colony might
refuse, and the whole thing would fail. Therefore,
you must give the commonwealth the money direct,
and, having done so, you must show them what they
are to do with it. You must say, "We do not want
it back again ; but, having taken all our money, you
must pay some of our debts, and the way to begin is
to pay the interest on those debts." While I agree
that we should hand over the revenue to the common-
wealth, I think we should at the same time, insist that
they should consolidate the debts of the various
colonies, and readjust them in proportion to the


amount borrowed. I believe that one thing of itself
would do more to cement and fasten the various
colonies together in one whole than anything else
we could possibly accomplish.
Mr. McMillan : Had we not better discuss this
when w r e come to the special clause dealing with the
subject r
Colonel SMITH •' That is the very thing I sug-
gest ; but here is a sub-clause which says, “ Borrow-
ing money on the public credit of the common-
wealth.”
Mr. Baker : Does the hon. member object to
that ?
Colonel SMITH : I think the hon. gentleman must
have been absent during my remarks, because the
whole gist of what I have said has been in favour of
the commonwealth having the power not only to
borrow, but also to consolidate the whole of the
debts, so as to be able to pay the interest. What I
wish to avoid is that it shall have nothing to pay back
to the various colonies.
Mr. Baker : That is not the point now; we will
come to that by-and-by !
Colonel SMITH: I think my remarks are rele-
vant to the question of borrowing. If anything is
proposed by-and-by which shall carry out what I am
now recommending, I shall be satisfied, and I shall
expect the assistance of the hon. gentleman, who has
taken a great deal of trouble over this matter. What
I wish is that it shall not be a matter of option, but
a matter of absolute compulsion, and that if the
commonwealth takes over this money, it shall expend
it for the benefit of the various colonies in the way I
have suggested.
Mr. MACDONALD-PATEESON : There has
been a general consensus of opinion in the Conven-
tion to-day that this sub-clause 4 should pass, and
with all respect I think that the remarks of the last
speaker were premature, and that his speech would
more properly come in on clause 13, at page 22. I
mention this with the object of endeavouring to
curtail discussion of the character introduced by the
hon. member, Colonel Smith, at this stage of the
debate. At the same time, I take the opportunity of
stating that the whole of Australia will be greatly
disappointed if we do not in this Convention go fully
into the question of the public debt. At an earlier
part of the proceedings, the hon. delegate, Sir Samuel
Griffith, invited reference to a measure which he
recently introduced into the Queensland Parliament,
in which he said we would find a list of the subjects
proposed to be relegated to the general government,
and those which would be left to the three provinces
into which it is proposed that Queensland should be
divided. In that draft occur these words, which we
are now invited to adopt:—
That matters of general concern, including the administra-
tion of the public debt, should remain under the control of
one legislature and one executive, having jurisdiction over the
whole of the present colony of Queensland, until the establish-
ment of an Australian federation, when their functions should
pass to the legislative and executive authorities of the
federation.
Here is a proposal which indirectly affirms that
immediately upon federation taking place the
administration of the public debt shall pass into the
hands of the central government.
Mr, MAEMION : I do not know whether I have
misapprehended the remarks of some of the previous
speakers, and especially those of Colonel Smith; but
it seems to be suggested that the commonwealth
should have power to borrow money on the public
credit, not only for its own purposes, but also lor the
purposes of the several states —that, in the first
instance, it should absorb the debts of the several
states, and afterwards, I suppose, borrow money on
account of the states. If the indebtedness of the
states is taken over, I presume the future borrowing
power will have to be given to the federal parlia-
ment.
Mr. Platfoed : Not necessarily !
Mr. MAEMION : This matter was fully discussed
by the Committee on Finance and Trade, and it was
so difficult to deal with, that it was thought desirable
to leave it to be settled by the federal parliament.
The greatest difficulty was felt to be this : that if the
federal parliament took over the present liabilities of
the various states it would be absolutely necessary,
in the event of any of the states desiring to borrow
thereafter, that they should be compelled to refer any
loan bill they might pass to the federal parliament.
That was one of the greatest difficulties that was
encountered.
Colonel Smith : The municipalities in Victoria
borrow on their own account!
Mr MAEMION : I am not talking of munici-
palities ; I am talking of states. The difficulties
surrounding this question are so great that consider-
able time will be required to settle it. Fully half a
day, if not longer, was devoted to the question by a
body who had the opportunity of dealing with it in
a conversational way, and, as I said, the difficulties
were found to be so great that it was thought advis-
able to leave the question open to be dealt with by
the federal parliament. I thought the hon. mem-
ber’s object was to add some words that would
express the meaning which I have endeavoured to
convey. If that is not the case, then of course I am
mistaken, and I quite agree with those who think
the discussion should be postponed until we arrive
at page 18.
Mr. THYNNE : By this sub-clause we propose to
give to the federal parliament an unlimited power of
borrowing money on the public credit of the common-
wealth ; but there is no provision in any part of the
bill that I can find which in any way restricts or limits
the objects for which they may borrow money. In one
of the drafts that were considered by the Finance
Committee, I observed a paragraph giving to the
state parliaments the power of appropriating money
for the purposes for which they are entitled under
their constitution to appropriate money. That prac-
tically limited the power of raising taxation or bor-
rowing money to the purposes which they are
authorised to administer under the bill generally. I
think it is rather a mistake that that limitation of the
right of appropriating money has been left out. I trust
that the hon. gentleman in charge of the bill will
restore the paragraph to the bill. The hon. member,
Mr. Clark, has pointed out that under sub-clause 1,
reasoning by analogy from decisions given in the
United States, an enormous power may be given to
the federal parliament. I think that to give this
unlimited power of borrowing money without any
restriction as to the objects for which it may be bor-
rowed, is placing the federal parliament in a position
in which it becomes, and justly becomes, an object of
suspicion on the part of the state parliaments and
the different peoples.
Sub-clause agreed to.
Sir SAMUEL GEIFFITH: Before you, sir, put
the sub-clause “ navigation and shipping,” I wish to
mention a matter to which my hon. friend, Mr.
FitzGerald, called my attention a little while ago. I
thought he was going to mention at this stage the
question of controlling munitions of war. I will not
take the argument from his mouth, but will afford
him an opportunity of saying what he desires to say
by moving :
That the following stand as sub-clause 7 of the clause ;
“ Munitions of war.”
Mr. FITZGEEALD : I offered a suggestion to
the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, in order to
ascertain whether or not the question had been con-
sidered by the committee. Considering the import-
ance with which we all regard the subject of defence,
I thought it might be of very great value indeed to
the federation that it should have control over the
manufacture of munitions of war. It might occur,


for instance, at some point in the commonwealth, that
the local government, through carelessness or for
some other reason, were inattentive to the manufac-
ture of such munitions, which might be a menace to
the commonwealth. Therefore, with the view of
eliciting information, I suggested that it would he a
very important power to put in the hands of a federal
government. Ido not think it requires much argu-
ment to recommend the suggestion to hon. members.
It appears to me that if we are actuated by a desire
to give the federal authority control over the federal
defence it might be a subject of great danger indeed
if it did not also have the power of framing regu-
lations for the manufacture of munitions of war.
Mr. McMILLAN : This is an amendment, which,
I think, is scarcely necessary. Surely the power to
control the military and naval defence of the colonies
covers everything. It is not natural that it would
undertake the control of the military and naval
defence without having munitions of war and every-
thing necessary for the defence of the commonwealth.
Colonel Smith: Yes; hut not of regulating the
manufacture of munitions of war, which may he in
private hands, and which may be exercised to the
great danger of the commonwealth !
Mr. BARTON: It is quite clear to me that the
power of dealing with munitions of war is included
in the power of dealing with the military and naval
defence of the colonies.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I understood my hon.
friend to refer rather to the danger of munitions of
war being manufactured and exported to the injury
of the commonwealth. That is a different subject
from the defence of the commonwealth. It may be
necessary to absolutely prohibit the manufacture and
exportation of munitions of war.
Mr. PLAYFORD : I think the sub-clause dealing
with military and naval defence includes the power
of dealing with the manufacture of munitions of war
if it is thought necessary to exercise that power for
the safety of the commonwealth. In the United
States they have not required the provision, neither
in Canada, nor in any other part of the world.
An Hon. Member : But they have in Switzerland !
Mr. WRIXON: It would seem to me that the
point raised by my hon. friend, Mr. Fitzgerald, is
well worthy of consideration, because we forbid by
the bill any state to raise or maintain a military
or naval force of its own. It may be necessary, in
order to carry out that provision, to control the manu-
facture of munitions of war; therefore, I think it
would be well to take power to that effect.
Amendment agreed to ; sub-clause agreed to.
Sub-clause 13. Banking, the incorporation of banks, and the
issue of paper money.
Colonel SMITH : I should like to ask the hon.
member, Sir Samuel Griffith, if the word “ banking”
covers the possibility of establishing a bank for the
commonwealth ?
Sir Samuel Griffith : I should think not!
Sir JOHN BRAY : I should also like to know
whether the sub-clause would include savings banks p
Is it intended to interfere with the establishment of
savings banks in the different colonies ? If not, we
ought to insert the words “ other than incorporated
savings banks.” I do not think it is necessary for
the federal government to interfere with them. They
are managed in almost all the colonies at the present
time in a different way.
Mr. Donaldson : The federal government is to
take over post-offices!
Sir JOHN BRAY: But there are savings banks
other than those in connection with the post-offices,
and I think it would be better to exclude them from
the operation of the clause.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Of course there are
two kinds of savings banks in Australia. There are
what may be called private savings banks —that is
to say, savings banks under the management of
directors —and there are also the post-office savings
banks. They would be taken over, I presume, with
posts and telegraphs.
Mr. Dexkin : No; money orders would, but not
the post-office savings banks !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Yes; the hon. member
is right. Those banks belong to the treasury in each
state. I fail to see, however, why, in providing for
the general safety of the commonwealth, savings
banks should not be an object of federal legislation
as well as other matters. Some savings banks have
been known to go insolvent.
Mr. GILLIES : The government is in reality res-
ponsible. Of course they are not liable in the case
of general savings’ banks, but in other cases they
would be bound to pay in the case of anything
untoward happening to the banks.
Mr. THYNNE ; I think it will be found that sub-
clauses 13, 15, and 16 deal with civil rights in pro-
perty, and I would ask the Convention to consider
whether it would not be wiser, even although there
were a little inconvenience on account of the want
of uniformity in the law, to leave to each state full
and complete control over all questions of civil right
in property ? The issue of paper money is a matter
perhaps with which the federal parliament should
deal; but banking, bills of exchange, and promissory-
notes, and bankruptcy and insolvency, I think might
be left to the state parliaments. Complaints have
been made in the past that these matters have not
received equal attention in the different states ; but
that has been on account of the large amount of
work the different parliaments had to perform in
connection with other branches of legislation, which
will now be taken over by the federal parliament, and
they would, therefore, have ample time to deal with
these other matters. I think we ought to lay down
the principle that the states should deal with all
matters of civil right in property, and that we should
not break in upon that rule by the inclusion ot these
several sub-clauses. I ask hon. members to consider
the matter also from this point of view: that persons
interested in the states and in the state parliaments
might, if these reservations are made, be likely to
look more favourably upon this scheme of federation
than they would otherwise do.
Mr. MACDONALD-PATERSON : I regret that
I am unable to agree with the observations of the
hon. member, Mr. Thynne. The laws relating to
bankruptcy, to banking, to bills of exchange and
promissory-notes, are laws which we would all be
happy to see upon a level footing all over Australia.
I unhesitatingly say that the absence of uniformity
as to these several matters has tended very much,
especially within the last fifteen or twenty years, to
clog the wheels of commerce and finance. It is a
trouble, for instance, to Victorian capitalists to find
that we have in Queensland a law which does not
exist in Victoria. While the disparity in the law is
not of much moment, still it is these little grains of
sand falling in between the wheels of commerce,
causing hesitation in investment in different parts of
Australia, which do so much to clog the w'hole
machinery. I trust hon. members will endeavour to
maintain a uniformity of law in these respects.
Sub-clause agreed to.
Sub-clause 19. The status in the commonwealth of foreign
corporations, and of corporations formed in any state or
part of the commonwealth.
Mr. MUNRO ; We have agreed to sub-clause 13,
dealing with the incorporation of banks, and I do
not see why a similar provision should not be made
in regard to the incorporation of companies. Why
should they not be under the control of federal
officers ? At the present time the law as to incorpora-
tion is different in the different colonies, and the
result is extremely unsatisfactory in many cases. I
do not see why we should not make the same provision


in regard to the incorporation of companies as we
have made in regard to the incorporation of banks.
We might introduce at the commencement of the
sub-clause w r ords to this effect: “ The registration or
incorporation of companies.”
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I do not think we
should. There are a great number of different cor-
porations. For instance, there are municipal, trading,
and charitable corporations, and these are all incor-
porated in different ways according to the law
obtaining in the different states.
Mr. Munro : But as to trading corporations !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : It is sometimes diffi-
cult to say what is a trading corporation. What is
important, however, is that there should be a uniform
law for the recognition of corporations. Some states
might require an elaborate form, the payment of heavy
fees, and certain guarantees as to the stability of
members, while another state might not think it worth
its while to take so much trouble, having regard to
its different circumstances. I think the states may
be trusted to stipulate how they w'ill incorporate com-
panies, although w r e ought to have some general law
in regard to their recognition.
Sir JOHN BRAY: I think the point raised by
the hon. member, Mr. Munro, is worth a little more
consideration than hon. members seem disposed to
bestow upon it. We know what some of these
corporations are; and I think joint-stock companies
might be incorporated upon some uniform method.
In South Australia, a banking company is not
allowed to be incorporated under the Companies Act;
still, there is nothing in Victoria of which I am aware
to prevent a banking company from being registered
there as a limited company and opening a branch in
South Australia a few days afterwards. I think it is
necessary, therefore, to have some uniform law.
There is nothing in which the public should have
more confidence than in banks which are in any way
recognised by the state ; and I think we should have
some uniform system of incorporating banks. Many
companies, although doing business under different
names, are, in reality, banks.
Mr. Munro : The banks are incorporated under
the Companies Act in Victoria!
Sir JOHN BRAY : You can establish financial
companies, which you do not call banks, but which
answer all the purposes of banks. We have provided
that the federal parliament shall legislate as to the
incorporation of banks ; but there is nothing to pre-
vent the incorporation by the states themselves, quite
apart from the federal parliament, of trading com-
panies which will do all the ordinary business of
banks. If it is desirable to entrust legislation as to
the incorporation of banks to the federal government,
there is no reason why we should not say that the
registration of financial companies doing all the busi-
ness of banks should be dealt with in the same man-
ner.
Sub-clause agreed to.
Sub-clause 21. The service and execution of the civil and
criminal process and judgments of the courts of one state or
part of the commonwealth in another state, or part of the com-
monwealth.
Mr. BAKER: I should like to know whether sub-
clause 21 or 22 will include the recognition in one
colony of probate issued in another colony ? It can
hardly be called a civil or criminal process or a judg-
ment, nor can it be called a public record or judicial
proceeding. I want to know if this point has been
considered by the sub-committee, and if they are quite
sure that probate issued in one colony will be recog-
nised in another colony? There is at present a great
deal of unnecessary expense and trouble in the regis-
tration of probates and letters of administration
issued by one colony in another colony. It is not so
easy a question as at first sight it appears, because
persons often die possessed of property in more than
one colony.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I think that probate
of a will must be regarded as coming under the
heading of a judicial proceeding. It is the official
recognition by a court of judicature of the will of a
person. In addition to that, there is the committal
of the administration of the estate to some person.
I do not think we ought to interfere with that.
Mr. BAKER: Supposing, as is probable, that one
colony passed a law providing that probate and suc-
cession duties should be paid, and paid only on the
property in that colony, and that is universally
recognised by the other colonies, the consequence
would he that no probate or succession duties would
be paid in other colonies where the same man had
property. That would be the case if a resident in
South Australia died possessed of Broken Hill shares,
and the probate in South Australia was ipso facto
recognised in New South Wales.
Sir Samuel Griffith : No !
Mr. BAKER: That is what I want to obtain
information about. One reason why I have brought
this matter forward is, that in South Australia last
session a probate and succession duty bill was intro-
duced, providing for two distinct principles. In the
first place, if a man died after being domiciled in
South Australia, all the property he had, wherever it
might be situated, was to pay probate and succession
duties in South Australia. Another principle was
also sought to be included ; that was, that if the man
was not domiciled there, and held property in South
Australia, that property should also pay probate and
succession duties. I only point this out to show
what different laws may be passed by the various
colonies. I wish to know whether, under this clause,
cases of that kind will be met? It seems to me that
they will not be met. I should like to see the federal
parliament authorised to make laws concerning pro-
bate and the issue of letters of administration. All
those difficulties would then disappear.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH; I think the difficulty
the hon. member suggests is not likely to arise.
This is a clause to enable the federal parliament to
make a law recognising a judicial proceeding —that
is, probate; but it recognises the probate for what
it purports to be—that is, the proof of the will and
the committal of the administration of the property
in that state to some person. The committal of the
administration of the property in any state is a
matter for that state. Another state will recognise
the probate ; but they do not necessarily commit the
administration to the same person. They will recog-
nise the will as far as the judicial proof of it extends,
and no further. With respect to succession duties,
the court recognises the revenue law as a law, but it
only applies within the state which made it. That
question has never come into contest. But so far as
a revenue law might be in force in South Australia,
providing that certain probate and succession duties
should be payable there, no court would recognise
that as creating an obligation to pay duties in Vic-
toria and New South Wales. I do not think this
will enable the parliament of the commonwealth to
require committal of the administration of an estate
in one state to the same person to which it has been
committed elsewhere, and I do not think it is intended
to go so far.
Mr. BAKER ; If that is the state of the case, the
same results will continue as accrue at the present
time —that is to say, if a person dies having property
in different colonies, his successors will have to go to
the expense and trouble of obtaining administration of
the estate in all the colonies. That is an unnecessary
expense and trouble which might be done away with
under a federal form of government.
Mr. CLAK.K; I think the hon. member does not
see the full effect of this clause. I take it that this
will enable the federal parliament to do what all the
colonies can now do conjointly, and what several of
them have done. Tasmania, New Zealand, and


Queensland have passed intercolonial probate acts,
whereby the probates issued in any of those colonies
can be received and registered in the courts of the
other colonies. It required the action of the several
legislatures to do that. This sub-clause will enable
the federal parliament to do that in one act for all
the colonies. I take it that is the intention of the
clause.
Sub-clause agreed to.
Mr. KINGSTON: I desire to propose a new
clause, to follow sub-clause 22, as follows :
The establishment of courts of conciliation and arbitration,
having jurisdiction throughout the commonwealth, for the
settlement of industrial disputes.
I do not propose to discuss the question at any
length ; but I think, in view of the magnitude of the
recent industrial disturbances which have affected
Australia and the whole of the civilised world, it is
desirable, when we are framing this federal constitu-
tion, that we should at least consider whether we
cannot do something in the way of avoiding, diffi-
culties of the character to which I have referred. I
am not in favour of conferring unnecessarily any
powers on the federal parliament. I have hitherto
seized various opportunities for advocating the ex-
pediency of leaving the settlement of matters of
purely local concern to the local legislatures. But
we cannot avoid recognising this fact—that in
disputes of the magnitude to which I refer, which
affect not only one, but all the Australian colonies,
it is utterly impossible for any local legislature to
constitute a tribunal competent to deal satisfactorily
with the question. The adoption of the amendment
which I now indicate will not in the slightest degree
interfere with the powers which are at present
possessed by the various state legislatures to legislate
within their state limits. It seems to me that there
is only one way out of this industrial difficulty which
will commend itself to the good sense of the general
community. It is impossible, having regard to
the disastrous effects which are occasioned to
society generally, to leave the contending parties
to fight the matter out to the bitter end, and
the only means which occur to me by which
some good can be done is the appointment of
a tribunal qualified to investigate the matters in dis-
pute, to reconcile the parties if possible, or, if such a
course be impossible, to pronounce an award which
will fix what, according to the decision of the court,
is right and proper to be done, and will carry with
its pronouncement the means of its enforcement.
Conciliation and arbitration therefore seem to me the
only means of doing anything towards the settle-
ment of the difficulties to which I refer. Hon. dele-
gates will recognise that courts having competent
jurisdiction cannot be established by the local legis-
latures. I would therefore ask the Convention to
assist me in procuring the insertion of the amend-
ment Avhich lam moving, which will simply give the
federal parliament the power to deal with a most
momentous question in a way which I trust will com-
mend itself to the good sense of this Convention.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: If the court is to
have jurisdiction throughout the commonwealth,
surely it will be a federal court. That being so, the
amendment ought to be inserted in that part of the
bill which deals with the federal judiciary. If it is
intended to empower the states to establish such
courts, they can do it already.
Mr. Kingston : It is not i
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: We could have pro-
vided for all the judicial powers in this section if we
had wished to do so. If it is desired that the common-
wealth should have power to establish such a court
as the hon. member suggests, upon which I do not
now express any opinion, provision ought to be made
for it in the part of the bill which deals with the
judiciary.
Mr. KINGSTON: I am very desirous to meet the
wishes of the hon. and learned member responsible
for the form of the bill, as regards the moving of the
amendment, though I do think there is much to be
said in favour of proceeding with the discussion of
the question at the present time ; because, in the
natural order of things, it will hardly be proposed to
confer upon the ordinary federal judicature the
powers which could be only properly exercisable by a
commercial tribunal such as that which it is proposed
by the amendment to establish. I might also empha-
sise the fact that this is simply a proposal to confer
upon the federal parliament power to legislate with
reference to the establishment of these courts, and
though no doubt the terms of the amendment show
that a federal court having jurisdiction to deal with
the entire commonwealth is contemplated, it may be
contended that will hardly be a federal court in the
ordinary acceptation of the provisions contained in
the subsequent portion of the Act dealing with the
establishment of a federal judicature. However, as
I understand the hon. and learned member much
prefers that the amendment should be deferred to a
subsequent stage, I shall be happy to meet his wishes,
and ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
Sub-clause 23. Immigration and emigration.
Colonel SMITH ; I should like to ask Sir Samuel
Griffith the exact meaning of these two words, “immi-
gration” and “emigration”? The colony which I
represent objects to immigration unless the immi-
grants come at their own expense. For many years
we have abandoned the system of assisted immigra-
tion. I should like to know, therefore, if power is
to be conferred upon the dominion parliament to over-
ride the local parliament in reference to this matter ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: The words as they
stand are as general as they can be, and should be
read with the introduction :
The parliament shall, subject to the provisions of this con-
stitution, have full power and authority to make all such laws
as it thinks necessary with respect to immi-
gration and emigration.
That is wide enough.
Colonel Smith : Rather too wide!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: It will enable them
to keep out Chinese, Hindoos, or other aliens—even
English, if necessary. It will enable them to impose
conditions, if found necessary, such as America has
imposed to prevent pauper and other undesirable
immigration. It may under some circumstances be
a very useful provision.
Sub-clause agreed to.
Sub-clause 27. Eiver navigation with respect to the
common purposes of two or more states or parts of the com-
monwealth,
Mr. McMILLAN : This is a sub-section that I
think requires some kind of elaboration, which prob-
ably those who have drawn the bill may be able to
undertake. The sub-section means more than the
river navigation. We want the control of the rivers
as regards the use of the water, and, furthermore, it
is necessary to have some control over the tribut-
aries. As we know in connection with the Murray,
there may be tributary streams to check the flow
of water from which might have such an effect
as to render the river useless. It seems to me—
although I do not propose now to indicate any actual
amendment—that there ought to be some very general
powers with regard to the control of the river, not
merely for navigation purposes, but also for purposes
of irrigation and the conservation of the water. That
I look upon as one of the most important matters in
connection with the whole scheme of federation. We
have large rivers which are absolutely essential to
future schemes of irrigation and the conservation of
water. These run through different colonies, and if


economically managed by one power, equitably deal-
ing with all the rights of the different states, they may
be great sources of wealth in the future. Con-
sequently it seems to me that a clause ought to be
introduced into the Bill which will give the central
government general powers to deal in some equitable
way with the different rights of different states, and
with the general conservation of all rights with re-
gard to these rivers.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: The hon. member’s
observations certainly demand attention. The sub-
ject was considered pretty fully by the committee,
and a form of words which was suggested, and which
at one time we were disposed to adopt, was, if I
remember rightly, “ river navigation and the conser-
vation of water, with respect to any purposes, &c.”
I think myself that it would be an improvement to
have these words. The delegates for colonies border-
ing on great inland rivers, however, know more about
the subject than I do. I move :
That, in line 1, after the word “navigation” the words
“ and conservation of water ” be inserted.
Mr. Cuthbebt : And distribution!
Mr. Deakin : That would belong to the states !
Mr. GILLIES: I should like to ask whether the
meaning of the amendment is to give to the federal
parliament the control of the conservation of water ?
Mr. Deakin : It is only “ with respect to the com-
mon purposes of two or more states ” !
Mr. GILLIES: The question of the conservation
of water would scarcely be raised between two states.
Any question as to local conservation, however,
might be seriously affected by the legislation of the
federal parliament with respect to conservation. The
control of water conservation belongs to the indi-
vidual states, and they undertake it; but if there were
legislation with respect to conservation generally
that would affect the tributaries of any particular
river, lam afraid that we should get too deep into
the subject, and that there would be trouble. Some
of the colonies deeply interested in water conserva-
tion might decline to join this federation if they
thought that the whole of their conservation schemes
might be interfered with by the federal parliament.
I think it should be made perfectly clear that their
schemes will not be interfered with.
Mr. Dkakin: It does not apply !
Mr. BARTON: I would suggest to the hon. mem-
ber, Sir Samuel Griffith, that he should withdraw the
amendment. Surely it is not intended to transfer to
the federal parliament the power of legislation for
the purposes of the commonwealth with respect to
the general conservation of water. That is a matter
for the taking away of which from the individual
states there is no reason whatever. Matters relating
to irrigation and so on, which are intimately con-
nected with property and civil rights, and which we
are all prepared to leave to the several states, ought
certainly not to be dealt with by the federation. 1
can see no reason why control with respect to these
matters should be transferred from the states to the
commonwealth, and I think that the idea of the
commonwealth being given power to take over con-
trol with regard to them will cause very great alarm.
I trust that the amendment wijl be withdrawn.
Mr. PLAYFORD : What I understand the amend-
ment to mean is that, supposing by any water con-
servation at the source of a river, navigation on that
river might be stopped, the parliament of the com-
monwealth would have power to step in and conserve
the rights of the states which were injuriously
affected. I think that the clause will give full effect
to this intention without putting in the words “ and
conservation” at all. Conservation on the upper
branches of the river Murray might tend in the future
to make that stream unnavigable, since the water taken
for irrigation might never find its way back to it,
and what we are now proposing to do is, 1 understand,
to give over to the dominion parliament the charge of
the navigable rivers, and, therefore, the conservation
of the interests of those colonies which require to
have the rivers kept open.
Mr. McMILLAN: As I see by sub-clause 29
matters generally may be referred to the federal
parliament, this matter might probably, I think, be
referred by the states concerned to the parliament.
No doubt if the amendment were carried it would
place a very large power, which might be abused, in
the hands of the federal parliament, and which would
cause irritation in the different local parliaments. I
therefore urge my hon. friend to withdraw the amend-
ment, and leave the matter to be settled under sub-
clftiisG 29
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I moved the amend-
ment because it was suggested in the committee, and
I knew that members of the committee would be
familar with it. I admit that I do not like the term
myself. The hon. member, Mr. Bird, has suggested
another expression, which I think it would be a great
improvement to use ; that is, the words “ navigation
and use.” South Australia, Victoria, and New South
Wales are, however, more interested in this matter
than is the colony which I represent, and their
delegates will know more about it.
Mr. Gillies : I am afraid of inserting words which
might be so wide in their meaning as to cause trouble !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: There was not a single
line in this clause which gave the committee so much
trouble as this did, and the result of all our trouble,
which was very great, is the phrase before the Com-
mittee.
Mr. DEAKIN: It may be as well to point out
one circumstance in connection with this matter —
namely, that conservation may be absolutely essential
to navigation, and it may, therefore, be taken to that
extent to be implied in the words already used. As
a matter of fact, even upon the magnificent streams
of America, steps are now being taken to conserve
water at the heads of the rivers to preserve a regular
flow in the summer season. The idea that the hon.
member, Mr. Playford, had in his mind is, therefore,
so far, provided for in the clause as it stands. For
my own part, 1 think that some such words as those
suggested by the hon. member, Mr. McMillan, would
be very advantageously added in this place. The
introduction of the word “ conservation” would have
permitted the conservation of water for the purpose
of irrigation.
Mr. Played bd : Leave that to the states !
Mr. DEAKIN : it may very well be left to the
states; but it is an indisputable fact that water
conservation will be absolutely necessary to the future
of one or two of the states, and it will be a matter of
great difficulty for them to cope with all the difficul-
ties of the question by any of the legislative powers
which they now possess. Each state can legislate
within its own borders ; but that is a different thing
from passing a measure which will exactly dovetail
in with the legislation of another colony, so as to
permit of joint action and joint responsibility. If
the matter cannot be dealt with by its reference to
the federal parliament, what ought to be a national
question will become a local question, whereas if you
introduced the words suggested, you would enable
all these issues to be dealt with federally as occasion
arose.
Mr. McMILLAN: With respect to the remarks
of the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, suppose there were
an extensive scheme of locking these rivers for the
purpose of navigation, would that be covered by the
sub-section ?
Mr. Deakin : It depends on whether it is for the
common purposes of two or more states!
Mr. McMILLAN : Perhaps the best thing to do
would be to allow the sub-clause to pass as it stands,
and to consider very carefully the whole question,
with a view to the adoption of some amendment
afterwards. It is a very difficult matter to deal with,


and I do not think it can be dealt with off-hand at
the present moment. The best thing to do would be,
taking note of the debate, to allow the sub-clause to
pass as it stands, and, perhaps, to introduce another
sub-clause afterwards.
Sir JOHN BE/AY : I may state that the Finance
Committee recommended, on this point, as follows :
That the federal government should be empowered to
legislate on the following subjects : —lntercolonial rivers, and
the navigation thereof.
We felt, and it is clear from what has been stated that
most hon. members feel, that there is something more
than the navigation of the rivers with which the
federal parliament ought to be empowered to deal.
The words I have quoted, however, did not meet with
the approval of the Constitution Committee, and
consequently they were abandoned. Still the Finance
Committee were strongly impressed with the idea
that there was something besides the navigation of
the rivers which required to be controlled by the
federal parliament.
Mr. Deakin ; Infinitely more important than
navigation!
Sir JOHN BEAT; It is true, as has been pointed
out by the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, that by leaving
the words as they stand, you may do more than is
intended, and may prevent people taking water from
a river at all by saying that it is necessary for the
purposes of navigation. The subject is a very impor-
tant one ; and it will require most careful considera-
tion before it is finally dealt with.
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
Sub-clause agreed to.
Sub-clause 28. The control of railways with respect to
transport for the purposes of the commonwealth.
Mr. GrOEDON: I move:
That the following words be added to the sub-clause :
“ and the regulation of traffic and traffic charges upon rail-
ways in any state in all cases in which such regulations are
required for freedom of trade and commerce, and to prevent
any undue preference to any particular locality within the
commonwealth or to any description of traffic.”
The amendment attempts to meet a patent difficulty
which, if not met, may upset the whole of the com-
mercial advantages of federation. If, notwithstanding
intercolonial free-trade, it is possible for any colony
to run a competitive line which will deprive an adjoin-
ing colony of the advantages of its position, then
intercolonial free-trade is a mere fiction, so far as the
colony which is deprived of its geographical position
is concerned. We must certainly have some power
in the federal parliament to regulate differential rates
on competitive lines, that is to say, upon lines open
simply for the purpose of competition.
Mr. Barton : Will not sub-clause 12, chapter iv,
meet the difficulty ?
Mr. GfOEDON; I think not. At any rate, it is
open to doubt whether it will or not. If we mean to
do this, why should we not say so specifically ? It is
possible that sub-clause 12 of chapter iv may meet
the difficulty; but the matter would have to be left
pretty much to the interpretation of the law courts
to give it that distinct application, and the constitu-
tion will be sufficiently legalistic as it is without
relying too much upon the interpretation which the
courts of law will place upon the general words. It
seems to me that this is an important matter; it
certainly is important to some of the colonies. If
we mean it, we had better say so, and if we
do not mean it, we had better say we do not
mean it, so that the colonies may fairly under-
stand the terms upon which they come into the
federation, and so that they may understand the
dangers they may have to face, and the contingencies
which may exist in the commonwealth. The amend-
ment embraces a large proposition, and it may be
possible to cut it down to meet the exigencies of the
case. I have, however, made it as large as possible,
and I think it ought to be made as large as possible
to cover what is required. I hope that it, or some
amendment of it, will meet with the approval of the
Convention.
Sir SAMUEL GrEIFFITH : I should like to ask
who is to be the judge as to whether the charges
were required or not ?
Mr. GrOEDON : Parliament of course !
Sir SAMUEL GfEIFFITH: Then all the words
of limitation are mere surplusage. If the regulation
of traffic charges is to be made in all such cases as
parliament thinks necessary for certain purposes, we
may as well leave out the words of limitation
altogether and say, “ the regulation of traffic charges
upon railways.”
Mr. Gordon : They are not federal traffic charges,
but state charges!
Sir SAMUEL GfEIFFITH : Exactly, they are for
a limited purpose. If parliament is to be the
absolute judge, what is the use of the words of
limitation ?
Mr. McMILLAN: I think it is as well to face
this question at once. I do not think the parliaments
of the country under existing circumstances would
bind themselves to absolutely do aw r ay with differen-
tial rates at the present moment. There may be a
great many contingencies to bring about differential
rates. I do not say that the question of free-trade
between the colonies is bound up with that of the
differential rates. We may have keen competition
between the different colonies in the way of carry-
ing on their respective businesses, and at the same
time we may have free-trade across the borders as
far as customs duties are concerned. I will take a
case. Supposing the central power has the right to
the navigation of the rivers, and supposing, by a
further power we may give them, they have the right
to lock them and create a large traffic in a certain
direction away, say, from New South Wales; and
supposing New South Wales had spent some millions
of money in constructing a railway right to the edge
of those rivers. Do you mean to say we are bound
to accept any regulations on two totally distinct
matters —the regulation of the river traffic and the
regulation of the railway traffic —both from the cen-
tral government, although there may have been
millions of money spent upon the one and very little
money spent upon the other, or vice versa ? It
seems to me that if we are to allow anything like
this at all it must be in regard to the taking over of
the whole of the railway systems, the unification of
the railway systems of the colonies; but we have
not got so far, and it would be very dangerous for us
to get so far. Starting, as we did, at the early stage
of our proceedings, with an anxiety to give very little
to the central government, we are now, it seems to
me, running the danger of giving too much and
leaving too little for that centrel government to do
in the evolution of its political life. As far as rail-
ways are concerned, and speaking with regard to the
debt too, some hon. delegates seem to imagine that
the two matters are absolutely intertwined with one
another. I may say to those delegates who seem to
me to be a little misty in their view of this question,
that you may have a consolidation of all the debts of
the colonies under the central power, and you need
not necessarily have anything to do with the particu-
lar assets which make up those debts. Well, if the
states are liable for their debts and for the interest on
those debts, and if they are, as it seems to me they must
be to a certain extent, the authority for deciding where
their lines of railway should run, you cannot, at any
rate at the present stage of our Australian existence,
where the conditions are so very different in the
various colonies, attempt to take away the control of
those railways. And if you do not take the control
of the railways, each railway system must be governed
according to the particular conditions that surround
it. Personally, as a matter of principle or theory, I
should like to see the abolition of differential rates,


when the time comes when it is possible to abolish
them, and to have a mileage system throughout the
whole of the continent; but we are dealing with each
state at the present moment on the supposition that
each state retains its own railway system, and has to
pay the interest upon the debt incurred in bringing the
railways into existence. Consequently, if the experts
of those railway systems say that, in view of river
navigation, of competing colonies, and of steamers
going along our coasts, they must must have some
system of differential rates in order to secure a general
result, it would be madness on our part to introduce
any hard and fast principle in this constitution which
would practically override the opinions of the railway
experts of the different colonies. It seems tome that
these are matters which it is far better for us to leave
to the general evolution of things, which will come
about in due time, than to deal with them by this
general sub-clause introduced into these powers by
which certain things can be relegated by the different
parliaments to the central parliament. A great deal
that we are trying to introduce now will, no doubt,
be ultimately carried out.
Mr. BIRD: I quite agree with a great deal of
what has fallen from the hon. member who last spoke;
but I think it should go without saying that if the
states are to keep their railways in their own
possession they should have control of the tariff of
those railways; and if we adopt the amendment now
before us, it would necessitate the adoption of a
similar restriction with regard to other state action.
For instance, it might be that a state would own or
charter a fleet of steamers, and lay them on to the
ports of some neighbouring colony for the purpose
of bringing the traffic from those ports to ports of its
own, and thus bring about the very thing which it is
feared by the hon. member, Mr. Gordon, would be
brought about by differential railway rates ; so that
if we adopted the hon. member’s proposal we should
be compelled to prevent the states not only from
imposing differential railway rates, but also from
taking action in regard to any other mode of com-
munication by which the same result would be brought
about. I think w r e should reject the amendment,
and leave the states entirely free to regulate their
own railway traffic so long as the railways are in
their own hands.
Dr. COCKBURN: From another aspect of the
case, I think arguments can be advanced in favour
of the amendment of the hon. member, Mr. Gordon,
I think free-trade is bound up with the question of
differential rates. A remission of railway rates on
the manufactures of any state might be equivalent to
a bonus given to the manufacturers. Take the case
of two adjoining states, in one of which manufactures
are established, and a large capital invested in them,
whereas in the other manufactures are just in their
struggling infancy. The tendency is for the large
manufacturers to attempt, by underselling, to crush
out the smaller manufacturers, and if the state, by
making large remissions in the railway rates, are
allowed to carry the products of the manufacturers
of the one state, so that they will be practically free
from charge, it is equivalent to giving a bonus to the
manufacturers, and diminishes that actual protection
which free-trade always acknowledges is due to mileage.
This principle is protection in the best possible way
commercially. Unless we abolish the possibility of
differential rates, we might destroy the only protec-
tion which acts through mileage against distant manu-
facturers. I think that free-trade without dis-
allowing differential rates, will fall short of its object,
and will tend in an indirect way to bring about the
granting of bounties by states.
Mr. DEAKIN: If the contention of the hon.
member, Dr. Cockburn, be correct, there would be no
necessity for his hon. colleague to move this amend-
ment. Jf, as he contends, any differential rates are
equivalent to an interference with freedom of trade,
there can be no question that clause 12 of chapter iv
does definitively and absolutely prohibit any such in-
terference. For my own part, taking sub-clause I of
clause 52, which we have passed, together with tho
clause which we are approaching, it does appear to
me that a very strong case could be made out under
the bill as it stands for arguing that the authority is
already vested, in the commonwealth, to deal with
the case the hon. member proposes. The argument,
however, which he might fairly urge is, that on a
question of this delicate and difficult nature it is
very desirable that there should be no possible room
for doubt, and that the hon, member, the chairman
of the Constitution Committee, has already indicated
there is doubt in his mind as to the sufficiency of the
present provisions. Under these circumstances, fol-
lowing his colleague’s argument, I would suggest to
the hon. member that any amendment made would
come very much better in clause 12, chapter iy. If
for instance, it read that “ the parliament of the com-
monwealth may make laws prohibiting or annulling
any law or regulation or differential rates made
by any state or authority constituted by any state,”
it then appears to me that he would be taking
as absolute a power as he could desire. The
only question is whether that power would not
be too absolute. I do not suppose that any one
can dispute the argument of the hon. member,
Mr. McMillan, that the imposition of differential
rates under many circumstances would be perfectly
legitimate. There can be no desire to interfere
with them, and there should be no authority in the
Commonwealth to interfere with them, except, in so
far as their action interfered with the federal prin-
ciple. But that would need a much narrower and
closer definition than the amendment, which does not
err either in its explicitness or scope. It embraces
all the hon. member desires, but also a good
deal more than is necessary, and, if moved in tho
form he has adopted, might give rise to a good deal
of doubt and suspicion in the several parliaments.
Sympathising with the hon. member, and with the
end he has in view, I question whether this wide
amendment, if accepted by the Convention, would
be accepted by the parliaments of the different
colonies.
Mr. FITZGERALD: I suggest to the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. Gordon, that if he hampers the states in
their control over their own railways, he will certainly
interfere very materially with what may hereafter
be, in their wisdom, considered a proper and wise
policy, namely, the leasing of those railways. If any
of the states determine to lease their railways, surely
the imposition now of conditions which might affect
the terms which could be obtained under such leasing
would be a very serious infliction upon those states.
I apprehend that unless the Convention see that it is
absolutely necessary that some restriction should be
placed upon the fullest power over the railway system
of each state, they will be very cautious indeed
in imposing any such restriction. The railways
represent a large sum of money, the policy of
governing the railways is one which requires men
of considerable power to direct it, and I think
the Convention would act very unwisely if it inter-
fered in the slightest degree with the fullest and
most absolute discretion in the exercise of that con-
trol.
Mr. CLARK; I sympathise very much with the
object that the hon. member, Mr. Gordon, has in
view in moving the amendment. But I believe the
criticism offered by the hon. members, Sir Samuel
Griffith and Mr. Deakin, is well founded, namely,
that the amendment expresses in language much too
wide the particular object which he has in view. I
think the hon. member, Mr. Gordon, must agree that
the argument of the hon. and learned member, Sir
Samuel Griffith, in particular, was well founded. At
any moment it chose tho central government could


pass an act regulating the rates from one end of the
commonwealth to the other. All the hon. member
and bis colleagues want is power to prevent some
particular wrong being done, or what they regard as
a wrong, and I think that object would be more
definitely and successfully achieved by an amendment
of this desertion:
And the prevention of discriminating rates being charged,
for railway services by an/ state, company, or person, so as
to give any preference or advantage to any particular person
or class of persons, or any locality, or any particular descrip-
tion of traffic.
Those are very much the words that are used in the
Inter-State Commerce Act of America. There they
legislate only with regard to private railways, none
of the states owning railways. I can conceive at
once that a number of difficulties might arise as to
how this law should be enforced against the states.
A¥e could easily enforce a law against a private
person by saying that he shall be guilty of an offence
and prosecuting him if he breaks the law.
Sir Samuel Griffith : In the case of a state we
could declare the state law to be invalid !
Mr. CLARK: But whatever difficulties there
might be in the way of administering the law, I think
the amendment I suggest definitely points to the evil
which the hon. gentleman desires to cure, while it
does not go beyond the particular object aimed at.
It does not give the federal parliament power to do
anything more than prevent the specific evil we wish
to provide against.
Mr. BAKER : I do not think the amendment just
proposed would meet the case. Take, for instance,
the railway between Melbourne and Geelong. The
Victorian Government spent a considerable amount
of money in making a railway from Melbourne to
Geelong, and why should we give the federal parlia-
ment power to prohibit them from so fixing the rates
on that railway as to enable it to compete with the
steamers running between Melbourne and Geelong ?
1 believe the Victorian Government lowered the rates
on that line for the express purpose of competing
with the steamers, and enabling the railway to pay
the interest on the cost of construction.
Mr. CLARK: The Inter-States Commerce Act in
America is managed by a commission who have very
large discretionary powers as to whether or not they
will allow a departure from the strict lines of the act,
and that might meet the particular, case to which the
last speaker has referred.
Mr. KINGSTON : It has been suggested that the
amendment of the hon. member, Mr. Gordon, would
have the effect of enabling the federal legislature to
deal with the question from time to time as it thought
fit, and to usurp to itself powers which it is not
intended should be conferred upon it. The decision
of the matter will not rest with the federal legislature.
It will rest with the federal courts, which it is
expressly provided will be charged with the interpre-
tation of the constitution, and which by their
decisions v\ ill control anything in the shape of the
improper exercise or assumption of power on the
part or the federal legislature. Therefore the sug-
gestion that the amendment will enable the federal
legislature to deal with the question, utterly irre-
spective of the principle laid down by the hon. mem-
ber who moved it, is not well founded.

Question so resolved in the negative.
Amendment (Mr. Clark) negatived;
That the sub-clause be amended by the addition of the
following words:—“ And the prevention of discriminating
rates being charged for railway services by any state, com-
pany, or person so as to give any preference or advantage to
any particular person or class of persons, or any locality or
any particular description of traffic.”
Mr. BAKER: I move :
That the sub-clause be amended by the addition of the
following words :—“ The altering of the gauge of any line of
railway, and the establishing a uniform gauge in any state or
states.”
I do not say that at the present time there is any
great reason why such an addition should be
made; but we must look ahead a little. We
know that the railway systems of the different
states are gradually drawing closer and closer toge-
ther. We do not know what the mineral resources
of any colony are; it is possible that at any moment
enormous mineral treasures may be found in different
parts of the interior, and an enormous traffic may
spring up. It is only right and proper, therefore, I
think, to give the federal parliament the power of
dealing with this question.
Mr. Munro : At the cost of the federation ?
Mr. BAKER: Of course.
Mr. MunrO: Then say so !
Mr. BAKER; That is assumed.
Mr. Gillies : Has the hon. member any idea how
much it will cost ?
Mr. BAKER: I shall come to that directly. Of
course I admit it must be at the cost of the federa-
tion, because I presume that the federal parliament
will not pass such a law unless it thinks it is neces-
sary for the good of the whole commonwealth. The
inhabitants of the states of Victoria, New South
Wales, and Tasmania are perhaps not very familiar
with this question, and it has not been so plainly
brought before them as it has been brought before
the inhabitants of South Australia. In South Aus-
tralia we have two railway gauges. We have already
met the Victorian system with a 5 feet 3 inch gauge;
we are extending our railway north to meet the
Queensland system with its 3 feet G inch gauge, and
we shall rapidly meet the New South Wales system
with its 4 feet 8|- inch gauge. It has been proposed
in our parliament —even by the Government, I think
—that we should pull up some 300 miles of our rail-
ways and relay them with a 4 feet 8£ inch gauge, in
order to meet the railway system of the great colony
of New South Wales.
Mr. Playford : Never !
Mr. Kingston : Not by any Government!
Mr. BAKER; It has been seriously proposed and
earnestly discussed. I bring the question forward to
show that it is bound by-and-bye to become an
important question. Any hon. member who has
travelled in America knows what an important ques-
tion it has become there. He knows that railways
with different gauges starting from different points
have gradually met, and that the different gauges
have involved an enormous annual expense.
Mr. Playford ; No such state of things exists in
America. The lines that go from the coast on one
side to the coast on the other are all of one uniform
gauge!
Mr. BAKER: I think the hon. member is mis-
taken, and if he has travelled on the Ohio to Denver


line, he must know that there are two different
gauges, and that one of the burning questions of the
day in America is the establishment of a uniform
gauge. The question may not arise here at the pre-
sent time ; but it is very possible that it will arise in
the not far distant future. It may be that for de-
fence purposes a line of railway will be required to
connect the capitals of the colonies ; or it may be
that a railway on which there is an enormous goods
traffic passing through two states will require to be
of a uniform gauge. I think it is advisable to give
this power to the federal parliament. The expense
of doing the work all at once may be too great, and
therefore I put it in the form that they can establish
a uniform gauge in any state or states, so that it may
be done by degrees. I hope the amendment will be
carried, because it is a power which we might safely
trust the parliament of the commonwealth not to
exercise unless it were necessary for the common
good.
Amendment negatived.
Sub-clause 30. The exercise within the commonwealth, at
the request or with the concurrence of the parliaments of all
the states concerned, of any legislative powers with respect
to the affairs of the territory of the commonwealth, or any
part of it, which can at the date of the establishment of this
constitution be exercised only by the Parliament of the United
Kingdom or by the Federal Council of Australasia, but always
subject to the provisions of this constitution.
Mr, BAKER: I desire to know whether it is
intended by this clause to take from the Parliament
of Great Britain the power to pass laws for this
country ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: We do not take any-
thing away from the Parliament of Great Britain.
We say that the parliament of the commonwealth
shall have the same poivers as the Parliament of the
‘United Kingdom in respect to certain matters.
Sub-clause agreed to.
Mr. THYNNE: I move:
That the following stand as sub-clause 3 . —“ The appropria-
tion of any moneys raised by the commonwealth for any pur-
pose authorised by the constitution.”
The object of the provision is to limit the power of
.the commonwealth to borrow money, or to raise
money strictly for the purposes with which it is
authorised to deal under the constitution. It is a
provision which I think is necessary for the protec-
tion of states.
Mr. CLARK: I thoroughly sympathise with the
object which the hon. member has in view, namely,
to confine the federal parliament strictly to the
powers conferred upon it by the constitution, and
not to let it in any indirect way, by the appropriation
of money, exercise a power which is not directly con-
ferred upon it. But I am of opinion that the
constitution has already sufficiently protected the
people, because, although the parliament might
attempt to do what I have just described, I am very
sure that the supreme court would very soon declare
any such law invalid. Therefore, the only object
which we could gain by inserting the provision would
simply be to plainly and legibly place before the
federal parliament this prohibition upon its powers.
I do not think we need do that when we know that
this prohibition upon an undue extension of powers
does positively exist, and will be interpreted by the
proper tribunal when the time comes. Surely we do
not require to state the prohibition in so many words,
to use an old expression, so that a child may under-
stand it.
Mr. Thynne : Where is the prohibition in the bill
now ?
Mr. CLARK : It is in the fact that only certain
distinct powers are specifically delegated to the
federal parliament, and that they cannot exercise any
powers other than those which are specifically dele-
gated to them. If the hon. member can show me
any general words in any part of the bill which
appear to go beyond the intention of delegating
specific and limited powers to the federal parliament,
I shall then feel compelled to support the hon.
member’s amendment, because I thoroughly sympa-
thise with his object. But Ido not want to burden
the constitution with any unnecessary provisions.
If the hon. member has discovered any general words
of the nature I have indicated, I should feel pleased
if he will direct my attention to them,
Mr. TIIYJNNE: The general words arc in sub-
clause 4:
Borrowing money oil the public credit of the common-
wealth.
No restriction is placed upon the purposes for which
the money may be borrowed. Although the hon.
member has, in connection with sub-clause 1, shown
very clearly and distinctly the way iu which the
powers of the Federal Government of the United
States have been extended from time to time under
the words “ trade and commerce,” I say that the
extension of powers which might be made under that
sub-clause are nothing as compared with the exten-
sion of powers which might take place if this uncon-
trolled power of borrowing money were given. I
submit that there is nothing in the bill from end to
end limiting the power of the commonwealth to
appropriate money for any purpose it thinks desirable
for the benefit of the community. In this way I
say you give to the federal parliament a power which
is a danger, and I wish to avoid that danger. The
hon. member, Mr. Clark, evidently agrees with me
that it is proper that a limit should be observed, and
if that is so, it is better to express the limit, than to
depend upon a judicial decision which we cannot fore-
tell will be made in the direction we now desire. It
is better that we should render reference to a court
upon such a subject unnecessary. I trust, therefore,
that the amendment will be adopted.
. Mr. Gillies : Do I understand the hon. member
to contend that the federal parliament could appro-
priate £1,000,000 for Mr. Parnell, for instance ?
Mr. THYNNE : Possibly it might appropriate the
sum of £I,OOO a year to remunerate Mr. Gillies for
the services he is supposed to have rendered to the
colonies of Australia. I think the power of the
parliament should be limited, particularly in view of
such a possibility, and that it should not have the
power to go outside the strict limits of the constitu-
tion in any expenditure it may make. Otherwise we
shall have no confidence in it.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I entertain consider-
able doubt as to whether words of the kind suggested
by the hon. member should not be inserted. The
question was considered very fully in committee, and
at the last moment it was agreed to leave the words
out; but it does not follow that the committee were
right, or that there is not a serious doubt upon the
subject. I entertain great doubt still; but my doubt
is occasioned only by sub-clause 4. While, on the
one hand, the parliament is not empowered to appro-
priate money for any other purposes than those
indicated, the appropriation of money is incidental to
the borrowing of it, and to that there appears to be
no limit.
Mr. Plateord: The amendment will place no
limit upon it!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: If we were to make
the 4th sub-clause read, “ Borrowing money on the
public credit for the purposes of the commonwealth,”
it might meet the case.
Mr. Kingston : The hon. member will find a
general provision as to appropriation in clause 3,
page 16.
Mr. MUNRO : These are questions which legal
gentlemen will have to interpret for us. We laymen
naturally want to know what the words mean. What
I should like to ask is whether, if this amendment is
inserted, and parliament deals with the question of
the consolidation of the loans of the various colonies,


it would be empowered to borrow money to deal with
those loans ? The borrowing in that case would not
be for the purposes of the commonwealth, and I
should like to know whether the limitation contained
in the hou. member’s amendment would interfere
with such a course. I do not know whether it would
or not.
Mr. Cuthbert : Certainly not!
Mr. MUNRO : It must be borne in mind that the
borrowing would not be for the purposes of the
commonwealth, but for the benefit of various states.
A clause we are going to deal with by-and-by provides
that the federal government may consolidate the
loans of the various states in order that money may
be borrowed at a cheaper rate, and in order that the
states may be put in a better position. But the
states will still be liable for the amount, and as long
as they are liable the borrowing must be held to be
for the benefit of the slates and not for the benefit of
the commonwealth. That being so, I should like to
know to what extent the limitation sought to be
introduced by the hon. member would affect the
question ?
Mr. DEAKIN ; The remarks of my hon. colleague
are an illustration of the innumerable difficulties that
will arise if you commit yourself to this proposition,
which is on first presentation very taking and seems
legitimate. Unfortunately, however, the result would
be to bring into existence for those purposes a rigid
constitution. You would have the appropriation acts
of the federal parliament scanned through and through
to ascertain if the parliament had not, to meet some
pressing need, or in some unforeseen contingency,
stepped outside the strict powers given to it. To
provide against such a case it would be necessary for us
to go through this measure from the. first line to the
last to see that every conceivable purpose legitimately
belonging to the commonwealth was included within
its four corners, so that every appropriation might
be justified. Otherwise, in case of a sudden emer-
gency, the federal parliament would find itself com-
pelled to go back to the constitution to discover
whether by good fortune the contingency could be
brought within the scope of any particular section.
Why should we not trust the federal parliament in
the making of appropriations? Do hon. members
suppose that the electors will not eagerly watch every
expenditure of money raised by their taxation?
Should we not trust the representatives, who will go
to their constituents and receive a mandate at their
hands ? If you cannot trust them to make appro-
priations in what can you trust them ? Why should
you make your constitution in its financial aspect so
rigid as to render the government liable to be fre-
quently called upon to justify before the courts an
appropriation which has been agreed to by both
houses of parliament ? The result must be that the
discovery that the constitution has not been so drawn
as to meet all possible cases of appropriation,
Mr. THYNNE : The speech just delivered by the
hon. member is a strong argument in favour of having
every provision in the bill so loose and elastic as to
allow the federal parliament to do in all matters
exactly as it chooses.
Sir Henry Parkes : How can we prevent it ?
Mr. THYNNE: By placing stringent limits on
its powers in this constitution.
Sir Henry Parkes : We cannot do that!
Mr. THYNNE: What is the use of our devoting
days to the specification of the particular powers
which are to be conferred upon the federal parlia-
ment if we, at the same time, admit words which will
enable it to do anything it chooses?
Mr. Munro: Will the hon. member kindly
answer my question ?
Mr. THYNNE : With regard to the consolidation
of the public debts, that would not be interfered
with, because the appropriation of money received
by the commonwealth for the consolidation of the
debts of the states would be a purpose authorised by
the constitution. Therefore, the operation of the
section to which the hon. member, Mr. Munro,
refers, would not be interfered with by the amend-
ment which I propose. It appears that the question
of the appropriation of money is becoming a vital
part of the whole of this constitution. If it will be
necessary, as the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, says, to
go over the whole bill again to see that we have
given the federal parliament all necessary powers,
then lot us do so; but I strongly object to any con-
stitution which will give the federal parliament
power to overshadow and crush out the operation of
the local parliaments. The argument offered is not
a good answer to the absolute necessity that exists
for having the power of the federal parliament
strictly limited on the important matter of finance.
Mr. CLARK: It is only fair to the hon. member,
Mr. Thynue, to say that he has drawn my attention
to a clause which has a much wider and more indefi-
nite operation than I imagined it would have. With
regard to that clause, I think his proposed amend-
ment would be useful. I do not sympathise with
the speech of the hon. member, Mr. Deakin. It is
not an answer to the argument of the hon. member,
Mr. Thynne, because the hon. member, Mr, Deakin’s
argument was in favour of absolute power being
given to the federal parliament, to which this Con-
vention says it will not commit itself.
Sir SAMUEL GRIEEITH : I would ask the hon.
member, Mr. Thynne, to withdraw his amendment.
He will see, on consideration, that it is not really a
power, but a restriction of a power, which he pro-
poses,
Mr. Thynne ; I intend it to be such !
Sir SAMUEL GRIEEITH : Then this is not the
proper place for it. It was in the clause as the
drafting committee prepared it; but I think it is in
the wrong place—it should come in in clause 3,
chapter it.
Mr. THYNNE: I accept the suggestion of the
hon. member, because I see that the words would
come in much more appropriately in the clause he
has referred to.
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
Clause 53. The parliament shall, also,, subject to the
provisions of this constitution, have exclusive legislative
power to make all such laws as it thinks necessary for the
peace, order, and good government of the commonwealth
with respect to the following matters : 5
(1.) The affairs of people of any race with respect to
whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws
not applicable to the general community; but so that
this power shall not extend to authorise legislation
with respect to the aboriginal native race in Austra- 10
lia and the Maori race in New' Zealand ;
(2.) The government of any territory which may by sur-
render of any state or states and the acceptance of
the parliament become the seat of government of the
commonwealth, and the exercise of like authority 1
over all places acquired by the commonwealth,
with the consent of the parliament of the state in
which such places are situate, for the construc-
tion of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards,
quarantine stations, or for any other purposes of 20
general concern;
(3.) Matters relating to any department or departments
of the public service the control of which is by this
constitution transferred to the executive government
of the commonwealth ; 25
(4.) Such other matters as are by this constitution de-
clared to be within the exclusive powers of the
parliament.
Amendment (by Sir Samuel Griffith) agreed
to:
That the word “legislative,” in line 2, be omitted.
Mr. THYNNE : I was unable to attend the com-
mittee when this clause was discussed. We purport
here to give exclusive power to the federal parliament
to make laws with respect to the affairs of people of
any race with respect to whom it is deemed necessary


to make special laws not applicable to the general
community. It seems to me that that will conflict
with the pow r ers reserved to each of the several
states under clauses 25 and 26, chapter I, of this
bill, -where the states have reserved to them the
power of excluding from the franchise any particular
race or class of people whom they think it is unde-
sirable should be intrusted with the franchise. AYe
give the states power to make a special law, while in
this clause we give that power exclusively to the
federal parliament. I do not know whether the hon.
member in charge of the measure has given this
point full consideration.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I do not think there
is any inconsistency. Each state is allowed to pre-
scribe w'ho are to be its electors —it may say any-
thing it pleases about that. I do not think that an
electoral law saying that only British subjects shall
vote can be said to be a special law applicable to the
affairs of the people of any race for whom it is
thought necessary to make special laws not applicable
to the general community. I think that would be
rather a far-fetched construction of the provision.
Mr. THYNNE: If a law w r ere passed saying that
the natives of the South Sea Islands would not be
permitted to exercise the franchise, that -would be a
special law dealing with the affairs of that race, and
not applicable to the general community. The state
is given power to do that in one part of this bill,
while in this part that power is reserved exclusively
1o the federal parliament. I think there is a con-
flict between the two provisions.
Mr. DEAKIN: There is another point I think
the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, should look
into. That is, whether the exclusive power contained
in the Ist sub-clause would not prohibit any indi-
vidual colony from dealing with such a question in
the interim until the commonwealth thought it neces-
sary to take action in the matter? AYould it not be
as well to leave power to any state to deal with such
questions until the commonwealth undertook to
legislate, as in other cases ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I think this should
be an exclusive power on the part of the federal
parliament.
Mr. Deaklx : But only when the commonwealth
GXGTCISGS lt<
* Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Then it would not
be an exclusive power.
Mr. Deakin : It would become exclusive so soon
as the commonwealth thought fit to exercise it!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: So it will be with
every other power which the commonwealth takes
• into his hands. The intention of the clause is that
if any state by any means gets a number of an alien
race into its population, the matter shall not be
dealt with by the state, but the commonwealth will
take the matter into its own hands.
Mr. DEAKIN: There is great force in the hon.
and learned member’s argument as to that being the
proper thing to do; but, until that is done, will the
state have power to take action ? Suppose the com-
monwealth does not interfere, will it be said that the
states shall be prohibited from doing that which they
can do at present ? I agree with the hon. and learned
member that the commonwealth should possess the
exclusive power if it chooses to exercise it; but is it
not undesirable in a bill for the constitution of the
commonwealth to impose a disability on the states ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: AYhat I have had
more particularly in my own mind w T as the immigra-
tion of coolies from British India, or any eastern
people subject to civilised powers. The Dutch and
English governments in the east do not allow their
people to emigrate to serve in any foreign country
unless there is a special law made by the people of
that country protecting them, and affording special
facilities for their going and coming. I am not sure
that that applies to Japan. It might apply to the
Government of China, but I do not know whether it
does. I maintain that no state should be allowed,
because the federal parliament did not choose to
make a law on the subject, to allow the state to be
flooded by such people as I have referred to.
Mr. Gillies : AYould this clause prevent any state
from making a law on the subject until the federal
parliament did so ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Yes; and I maintain
that it ought to be so.
Mr. Gillies : AYho, except the federal parliament,
is to determine to what race this applies ?
Mr. AD YE DOUGLAS : It seems to me that in
giving this exclusive power you are doing what you
do not intend to do. Suppose that people of an alien
race from India or China went to Queensland, and
the commonwealth did not choose to pass a law
dealing with the matter, not being interested in that
particular question, is the state parliament not to
make a law to exclude those aliens ? It seems to mo
that by putting in the word “ exclusively ” you are
doing what you do not intend to do, and you are
giving no power to any state, when invaded by a
foreign race, to protect itself. It cannot do so, be-
cause the exclusive right rests with the commonwealth.
Mr. AYRIXON: Ido not think that the point put
by Mr. Deakin has been sufficiently met. He has no
objection whatever to the federal parliament dealing
witht his subject. The point is whether, until the
federal parliament touches the matter, the hands of
the states arc to be tied altogether.
Mr. Gillies : I do not think they are!
Mr. AYRIXON: Exclusive legislative power is
given to the federal parliament. That would exclude
the states.
Mr. GILLIES : The hon. member has not noted
the point which I made. The clause says :
The affairs of people of any race with respect to whom it is
deemed necessary to make special laws not applicable to the
general community.
I say that, until the federal parliament deals with
that, and determines the race to whom it is applicable,
you cannot tell what race it is. They have to make a
special law to deal with the matter.
Mr. AVRIXON : The practical result of that is,
that the state can do nothing until the federal parlia-
ment acts. That ought to be met by giving the state
pow r er to act, the matter to be taken out of the hands
of the state the moment the federal parliament takes
it up.
Mr. CLARK: The argument is the other way.
This exclusive pow r er can only be exercised with regard
to a race respecting whom it is deemed necessary to
make special laws. AYho is to deem it necessary ?
The federal parliament; and it must give evidence by
legislation that it has deemed it necsssary, and until
it does that the exclusive pow r er does not exist. The
states can proceed to legislate on the matter until the
federal parliament gives evidence that it has con-
sidered the subject and come to a conclusion upon it.
Mr, FitzGerald : Is that conclusion agreed to by
the hon. and learned member in charge of the bill ?
Sir Samuel Griffith : I am disposed to think
that that is right. 1 did not think so a few minutes
ago, but I am impressed by the argument!
Mr. DEAKIN : It is at least open to contention.
The words—
The affairs of people of any race with respect to whom it is
deemed necessary to make special laws not applicable to the
general community
might as w r ell apply to the colony as to the federal
parliament. The clause deals with the parliament of
the commonwealth throughout, but in this particular
part it uses the impersonal reference “ to whom it is
deemed necessary.” If that is amended by saying
“ to whom the parliament of the commonwealth deem
necessary,” I shall be satisfied, as it will remove all
doubt. AYe ought to make the intention clear.


Clause verbally amended by the insertion of tbo
words “ affairs of the” before the word “ aboriginal”
in the first sub-clause.
Clause, as, amended, agreed to.
Clause 5 k Laws appropriating any part of the public
revenue, or imposing any tax or impost shall originate in the
house of representatives.
Mr. WRIXON: I would suggest a trifling amend-
ment in this clause. I think that the word “ laws” is
not a very happy expression as applied to measures
appropriating public revenue. I think it better to
keep to the old phraseology of “bill.” It is quite
true that a money bill is a law.
Mr. Clark: It does not appropriate till it is a
law!
Mr. WRIXON: There is a difference between
money bills when they become laws and other bills,
as we all may see by the preamble of an appropria-
tion act and the preamble of different bills granting
money. They are, in fact, grants of money by the
taxpayers to the Government. There is an awkward-
ness in using the word “ laws” instead of- “ bills.”
It may give a certain force to the contention that
money bills are like other bills, and are to be dealt
with in the same way ; but except for that I do not
think it is the best term to use, and I should prefer
to have the word “bills” inserted instead of “laws.”
I move:
That the word “laws” be omitted, with the view to insert
in lieu thereof the word “ bills, ”
Mr. CLARK: The hon. member, Mr. Wrixon,
will admit that this is only a verbal criticism even at
the best, and as we have used the word “ law” all
through, I think it would be well to have the bill
consistent with itself. It is only a matter of habit
that we have used the word “ bill” heretofore in our
local legislatures, but the people of the commonwealth
will soon acquire the habit of reading the word “ law,”
I shall, however, have no objection to inserting the
word “ proposed,” lower down.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I hope the hon. mem-
ber will not press the amendment. He does not
propose to make the alteration throughout the bill.
Mr. Wrixon : Yes, I do. I would make it in
clause 55 !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Would the hon. mem-
ber go right through the measure and use the techni-
cal term “ bill,” which scarcely anyone but members
of parliament understands, instead of a word with
which everyone who reads it, whether layman or politi-
cian, is acquainted ?
Mr. Gillies : Why did not the hon, member use
the word “laws” after the word “money” at the
heading of the clause ?
Amendment negatived.
Mr. BAKER : I beg to move :
That in line 1, after the word “appropriating,” the words
‘ ‘ any part of the public revenue ” be omitted with a view
to the insertion in lieu thereof of the words “ the necessary
supplies for the ordinary annual services of the government.”
If hon. members turn to clause 55 they will see that
the words which I propose to insert here are the
words used there. I have moved this amendment
for two reasons. The first, and perhaps the least
important, is for the purpose of facilitating the
conduct of public business. Eveiy important bill,
and nearly every bill, which is introduced, contains
some small clause that appropriates part of the public
revenue, and the consequence, at all events in the
colony from which I came, and I believe in other
colonies, has been that nearly every bill has to be
introduced in the lower branch of the legislature,
which takes up nearly the whole of the session in
considering the bills, and towards the end of it they
are rushed up to the other house, which must either
reject them or consider them in a very imperfect
manner. That has been the result of the law in
South Australia, and the consequence has been thp.t
the Legislative Council there have felt compelled to
summarily reject a great many bills —bills of hundreds
of clauses —which they have been asked to pass
in a few hours, because each of them appropriated a
portion of the public revenue, and had therefore to
bo introduced in the lower branch of the legislature.
This has not been at all beneficial to public legislation,
and as the words used in the clause are exactly the
same as those contained in the Constitution of South
Australia, I presume that the same thing will occur
in the federal parliament. My second and more
important reason for moving the amendment is this :
I am not going to fight over again the question of
the relative powers of the federal senate and the
house of representatives ; but, as we know, the effect
of the bill will be to render the powers of the federal
senate very much less than those of the federal
house of representatives, and I do not wish to un-
necessarily curtail those powers as they are curtailed
by these words. The words, “ any part of the public
revenue,” contradict the provisions of clause 55,
which says:
The senate shall have equal power with the house of repre-
sentatives in respect of all proposed laws, except laws imposing
taxation and laws appropriating the necessary supplies for the
ordinary annual services of the government.
But if the same words were used in both clauses they
would bo consistent with one another. If, however,
clause 54 stands as it is, clause 55 will contradict it,
because it says that no bill may originate in the
senate which does not impose taxation or appropriate
the necessary supplies for the ordinary annual
services of the government,
Mr. Clark: The two clauses must be read to-
gether !
Mr. BAKER : Yes, but they are absolutely con-
tradictory. One says one thing, and the other
another. Ido not know whether it was intended to
put in these words in clause 54 for the express pur-
pose of contradicting clause 55, but that is what they
do, and I cannot help thinking that in dealing with
this clause the Constitutional Committee followed the
rules which apply to ordinary upper houses, and
which have no application to the federal senate, and
therefore put in these words ; and when they came to
consider the question dealt with in clause 55 they
used words that had another significance. lam not
going to discuss the matter over again; but I desire
to place my opinion on record by moving this
amendment.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: The intention of
the clause as framed is that all laws for the expendi-
ture of money, whether for the annual services of
the government, or for the construction of railways,
arsenals, ships of war, or anything else, shall origi-
nate in the house of representatives ; and I think
that is what the words mean.
Mr. Baker: Why are different words used in
clause 55 ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: The hon. gentleman
thinks that because all such laws miat originate in
the house of representatives the senate will not have
equal power with the house of representatives with
respect to all proposed laws excepting those in
respect of which their power is limited. The restric-
tion, however, does not apply until the proposed law
has been introduced; so that there is no inconsistency.
Mr. BAKER : I understand that the hon. member,
Sir Samuel Griffith, draws a distinction between a
law and a proposed law. First of all he uses the
word “ law” when he really means something which
is not a law but a bill, that is, a law in its incipient
stage; and then he uses the words “proposed law”
to refer to a bill after its introduction—that is, to
mean a law in its second incipient stage. I should
rather say that a bill was a proposed law before it
was introduced than after it was introduced and had
passed one stage. I confess I may be dense in
understanding the two clauses, but I did not draw


any distinction whatever between the words “ pro-
posed law,” in clause 55, and the word “ law,” in
clause 54, nor do 1 think that anybody else would,
unless he happened to have been a member of the
Constitutional Committee, who may have considered
the matter, and have drawn some subtle distinction.
However, 1 am not going to argue the question over
and over again. We have argued it all out, and I
have no doubt we have made up our minds upon it.

Clause, as read, agreed to.
Clause 55. (1.) The senate shall have equal power with
the house of representatives in respect of proposed laws,
except laws imposing taxation and laws appropriating the
necessary supplies for the ordinary annual services of the
government, which the senate may affirm or reject, hut 5
may not amend. But the senate may not amend any
proposed law in such a manner as to increase any proposed
charge or burden on the people.
(2.) Laws imposing taxation shall deal with the im-
position of taxation only. 10
(3.) Laws imposing taxation, except laws imposing duties
of customs on imports, shall deal with one subject of tax-
ation only.
(I.) The expenditure for services other than the ordinary
annual services of the government shall not he authorised 15
by the same law as that which appropriates the supplies
for such oidinary annual services, but shall be authorised
by separate law or laws.
(5.) In the case of a proposed law which the senate may
not amend, the senate may at any stage return it to the 20
house of representatives with a message requesting the
omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein.
And the house of representatives may, if it thinks tit, make
such omissions or amendments, or any of them, with or
■without modifications. 25
Mr. WRIXON : I would now call the attention of
hon. members to the new sub-clause which I propose
to add to this clause, with some verbal amendments
which the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, has sug-
gested, and which I am quite agreeable to accept.
The new sub-clause which I pi’opose to move would
be numbered 0, and it would read as follows:
If the house of representatives decline to make any such
omission or amendment, the senate may request a joint meeting
of the members of the two houses, which shall thereupon he
hold, and the question shall be determined by a majority
of the members present at such meeting.
Mr. BAKER : I desire to move an amendment
before that is put. I move :
That all the words in paragraph 1, after “law's,” line 3, he
omitted.
That, I admit, is going straight to the point. This
is the most important question in the bill, and it has
already been often discussed. It is a question which
will determine whether we are going to have a
federation, or whether the bill will be one for the
annexation of the smaller states by the large popu-
lations of Alctcria and New South Wales. That is
what it will resolve itself into, and that is what will
be the effect ot the hill. As I have already stated, I
am not going to discuss the matter over again ; but
I think it is only right and fair that I and those who
agree with me should have an opportunity of placing
our views on record, so that, when we go back to the
colonies that have sent ns hero, they may know what
view we have taken of this matter.
Dr. COCKBURN : I support the amendment. I
think the framers of this clause find themselves in a
dilemma. The clause is one of two things. It either
decides that the houses have not co-ordinate powers,
that is to say, that the senate is, in the first place,
placed in a position of distinct inferiority to the house
of representatives ; or if, in an indirect manner it
gives those powers to the senate which it appears to
have taken away from it, it is a flimsy texture of words,
and a mass of ambiguity, which will form no proper
foundation for a lasting constitution. If it really
takes away the important powers of veto in detail
from the senate, then it strikes at the very root of the
principle of federation, because the principle of
federation is that there should be houses with co-
ordinate powers —one to represent the population, and
the other to represent the states. We know the
tendency is always towards the central authority,
that the central authority constitutes a sort of vortex
to which power gradually attaches itself. Therefore,
all the buttresses and all the ties should be the other
way, to assist those who uphold the rights of the
states from being drawn into this central authority,
and from having their powers finally destroyed. The
whole history of federation in America, whether it
be the United States or Canada, has proved this : that
the tendency is towards centralisation, and away
from that local government which is inseparable
from freedom. I have heard it said that those who
advocate state rights are taking a conservative view
of the question. I would like to know since what
time have centralisation and democracy been asso-
ciated ? Those who advocate stale rights advocate
local governments, under whose shadow alone demo-
cracy can exist. There is nothing in common between
centralisation and democracy, and if you handicap a
house, which is erected, to preserve state rights, what
have you to prevent the establishment, in this huge
island of Australia, of a strong central government
which is local only to one portion of the continent,
and as far as the rest of the continent is concerned
is distant and central? I maintain that a central
government, just inasmuch as it never can be asso-
ciated with the power of the people, is inseparably
associated with tyranny, arising cither from ignorance
or design—frequently from ignorance—because a
central and distant government can never properly
appreciate the local conditions for which it is to
legislate. I am surprised that any one in this Con-
vention should for one moment say that to strengthen
in every way the rights of the states, as such —to
protect in every way the local institutions - is the
conservative mission. The whole history of federation
has proved it is otherwise. It was in the name of state
rights, when the question of the Constitution of
America was being discussed, that the most fervent
appeals to liberty that ever stirred the human breast
were made, and all those opposed to state rights
were the conservatives, the monarchists of that time.
The strongest upholders of state rights from time to
time have been those in favour of government by the
people, and it is only when you have state rights
properly guarded, and safeguard local government,
that you can have government by the people.
Government at a central and distant part is never
government by the people, and may be just as
crushing a tyranny under republican or common-
wealth forms as under the most absolute monarchy.
I do hope that hon. members will not allow them-
selves to be hoodwinked in this matter. It seems that
the crushing majority in favour of the state rights
that are essential to federation, which we had at the
commencement of this discussion, has dwindled away.
I maintain that unless the state rights are in every


way maintained—unless buttresses are placed to
enable them to stand up against the constant
drawing towards centralisation —no federation can
ever take root in Australia. It will not be a federa-
tion at all. It will be from the very start a
centralisation, a unification, which, instead of being
a guardian of the liberty of the people, will be its
most distinct tyrant, and eventually will overcome
it. I do hope that we shall find that those who took
a clear view at the commencement of our meetings
have not been seduced from the views they then
held, and that, as at the commencement of the
debate, there will be a majority to vote with the hou.
member, Mr. Baker.
Mr. DEAKIN : The hon. member, in his impas-
sioned harangue, did not define state rights, nor
define the difference that will exist between the
bodies which will, in his opinion, guard state rights
—that is, the local legislatures—and the legislative
body that will represent the commonwealth. Surely
the hon. member need not be reminded once more
that the same body of people who will elect the state
representatives on the one side will elect the repre-
sentatives of the commonwealth on the other. The
only difference is in the bundles in which these people
are made up. The hon. member has chosen to base
the whole of his argument on democracy and demo-
cratic rights. Will he proceed to show us how it is
less democratic to intrust to the whole body of the
people of Australia the control of their destinies
than to intrust it to the same people, bound up in
different bundles ?
Dr. Cockburx: One is central and the other local
government ! •
Mr. DEAKHS" : That is no answer as regards
democracy. In almost every state the popular
chamber represents manhood suffrage ; but in no less
than throe states on the continent of Australia there
are nominee upper houses. Is there to be any
nominee upper house in the , new legislature of the
commonwealth? Where there are not‘nominee
upper houses in Australia, there are upper houses
elected on a limited franchise ? Is a house in the
commonwealth to be elected on a limited franchise ?
1 maintain that the constitution of the commonwealth,
as drawn in the bill, is more democratic than obtains
in any state at the present time. We shall have the
people’s house elected by the whole body of the
people, no nominee upper house, and no house
elected on a limited franchise, except so far as the
chambers with limited franchise may have votes
in the different states in the election of senators.
'J he legislature of the commonwealth will be more
democratic than that of the states, and the constitu-
ents of the commonwealth will be exactly the same as
those of the states. The hon. member said that in the
course of history we should find one division of parties
—the democratic ranged on the side of state rights,
and the conservative ranged agains. t.jem. Will he
tell us then that, in the United States of America
during the recent disastrous controversy which rent
that nation from side to side, the representatives of
the southern states, who claimed the state rights he
claims to-day, were the democrats of America; and
will he tell us that Abraham Lincoln, and the states
of the north, Ixllo resisted disunion, and the extreme
and extravagant doctrine of state rights, were the
conservatives of America ? Will he tell us that the
democratic population of America was to be found
ranked on the side of those who claimed the right of
secession and absolute privileges of the states, or will
he tell us, as he must, that it was the democracy of
America which gave its verdict for union, and against
any extravagant doctrine of state rights. In the
history of Switzerland, to which he is so fond of
referring, the hon. member can find precedents that
might justify him in some of his suppositions were
they not balanced by precedents in an opposite direc-
tion, Switzerland has tried both plans —has tried
unification, and rejected it, and trying federation,
which he considers democratic, has found it equally
a failure.
Ur. Cockbuek : And has now what I am contend-
ing for!
Air. DEAKIN”: And has found at last that it was
necessary to adopt some such happy medium as I
shall show is adopted in this bill.
Dr. Cockbuen : Exactly what the hon. member,
Air. Baker’s amendment is !
Air. DEAKIN: I will come to that in a minute.
One more argument. Cherishing, as I do, quite as
warm a feeling towards local government, and quite
as great a reverence for the powers of local govern-
ment as 'the hon. member himself does, I give
ray next illustration with some reluctance ; but it
w ill at all events show what lam only at present
concerned to show—that is the erroneousness of the
hon. member’s claim that history proves the demo-
cratic character of state rights as against the rights
of centralisers. I ask the hon. gent'eman to turn to
the republic of France, and note what has been the
policy of all its democratic leaders since Gambetta
first laid his policy before its parliament. I do not
say that the policy is a right one; but I do say that
the hon. gentleman’s history is all wrong if he neglects
the centralising tendency of the policy which from
the time of Gambetta until now has been handed on
from leader to leader of the Left and been embodied
as the first principle of the democratic policy of
France. Without approving of that doctrine, 1 say
that the hon. member’s hisvory is incomplete, and
that there can be shown as much democratic prece-
dent for centralisation as he can show for state rights.
But the hon. member, returning to his former argu-
ment with great force, says that in Switzerland the
two houses are co-ordinate, and therefore he desires
the two houses in this new commonwealth to be co-
ordinate. But w T hat I wish to point out to the hon.
member —although in that case, and in the case of
the United States, I can only reply to his former
illustration by my former arguments—is that there
he is speaking of a government not responsible in our
sense of the term —a government that is shaped upon
entirely different lines. There are many like myself
who would be perfectly prepared, if we were bound
to change our present constitutions altogether, to
adopt the Swiss system, with its co-ordinate houses,
its elective ministry, and its referendum, by which the
electors themselves Avere made masters of the situa-
tion ; but while we would be prepared to consider
a proposal of that kind, the Swiss relation of the two
chambers has no analogy whatever to a constitution
such as ours, in which it is proposed to retain respon-
sible government, and in which the government must
be responsible to the people’s chamber. Eesponsible
government, so far from being less democratic than
Mr. Baker's proposal wmuld make it is more demo-
cratic by far —not more democratic than the Swiss
Constitution, if you take it as a whole, but certainly
more democratic than this constitution would be
with an upper house co-ordinate with the popular
chamber. We have had the experience of several
centuries on some points, and one century at least to
warn us of the danger of endeavouring to establish
anything like co-ordinate poAver between two houses
Avhen the responsible government has its chief seat
and authority in one. To do so would be to shift
the centre of graA r ity of our political constitution. It
would be to alter the balance of power to such an
extent as to render the constitution strange to us,
something of which v>e have no knowdedge, as to
wdiich precedents w r ould offer us no guide, and as to
which w r e could form no idea of the future.
Air. Baker :We ha\ T e no knowledge in the present
case!
Air. DEAKIN: Wo have quite sufficient know-
ledge of the kind of federation we are about to
establish. If you establish two co-ordinate houses


with equal powers as regards all legislation, and
equal authority in the transaction of business, and
place a responsible government in one of those two
houses bound to answer to the demands of its con-
stituents, the whole body of the people, and pit it
against the house which draws its representation
from the legislatures of the several states, you will
simply provoke an internecine conflict on a more
colossal scale than anything which has ever been
Avitnessed in a constitutionally governed country.
But I am not concerned in answering arguments
which have gone to some length in this direction. I
am only concerned at the present moment in following
up the contention of the hon. member with reference
to democracy. How can he justify his argument for
intrusting co-ordinate rights to a house which is not
directly elected by the people, Avhich is elected in
part by nominee chambers and by members elected
Avith a limited franchise—how can he intrust to such
a chamber an equal authority Avith a chamber elected
by the Avhole body of the people ? He says that his
anxiety is democratic. How is it possible for any
one with those words upon bis lips to contend that a
constitution Avhich checks and limits the power of
the people, as he would have it do, which places an
absolute veto in its path—a veto not coming from
the people directly, is a democratic constitution ?
Those Avho argue for constitutional government find
themselves in a somewhat strange position when they
see the extraordinary combination in the last division
of reactionary radicals and iconoclastic conservatives
sitting together on the same bench. To see men
whose avowed object is to place all authority at once
and unreserA r edly in the hands of the electors sitting
cheek by jowl with gentlemen Avho will adopt any
motion, no matter hoAV circuitous, no matter how
vague, how hampered, and how inconsistent so long
as it defeats universal suffrage
Mr. Hackett : Name!
Mr. DEAKIN: I could name one or two if I
desired to enter into a personal argument, and cer-
tainly the gentleman who has interjected Avould be
one of the first.
Mr. Hackett : As an iconoclast or a reactionary ?
Mr. DEAKIN: I should say that the hon. gentle-
man is a combination of both. I will not enter into
reminiscences as to the hon, gentleman’s opinions ;
but I Avill say that a gentleman Avho in Australia, in
the nineteenth century, deplores the loss of the
personal power of the monarch, and the loss of
the power of the English Lords, as compared with
the poAver of the Commons, is to my mind an
anachronism. Ido not wish to be diverted by any
of these pleasant passages Avith an old personal
friend and associate of mine from the point, which
was that of the constitutional bearings of democracy.
I am not concerned at present with any other ques-
tion. No other has been raised. I should like the
hon. member, Dr. Cockburn, to ask himself how he
would submit to the people of South Australia— shall
I say the fierce democracy of South Australia —a
proposition such as has been embodied in this clause
—a proposition Avhich Avould give them in the con-
stitution of the commonAvealth far less poAver than
they now enjoy under their OA\ r u constitution —a con-
stitution which would embrace them, it is true,
within a federation, but which Avould leave them in
that federation less trusted than they are in their
own colony ? I would ask the hon. gentleman to
recollect that we are not here for the mere exercise
of our own opinion as to Avhat might be absolutely
the most perfect constitution that could be framed.
If we Avere, there are certain important amend-
ments which, for my own personal satisfaction, I
should like to see introduced even into this
bill. But they would be amendments in exactly
the opposite direction to those Avhich the hon.
member desires to make; and the reason why I
should Avish to make them in an exactly opposite
direction to those of the hon, member would be to
commend this bill, even more than I believe it is
already commended, to the democracy of Australia;
because I believe that if we indulged in any scholastic
exercises of the kind proposed in order to meet
imaginary state rights we might as well consign the
bill at once to that limbo of political forgetfulness
which is bounded by the boards of a blue-book. ~\Ve
should place this bill in vain before the democracy of
Australia if we presented it with a provision on its
forefront for the establishment of two co-ordinate
houses, one of which, though not elected by the
people, would have power to negative all that was
done by the house directly elected by the people.
Of course, if this were a general argument, I should
be pushing that point too far. I am perfectly pre-
pared to accept this constitution as it stands in the
bill. I believe it to be a good and workable consti-
tution, and one which the people themselves can
shape under its own provisions hereafter into any
form they may desire it to take; and I believe
important reforms will be carried in the early future
under this constitution by means of the powers of
amendment which it affords. lam only pressing the
argument in an extreme form now, because I am
replying to the still more extreme utterances of the
hon. member, Dr. Cockburn. I shall be quite con-
tent to let the question between us be decided by
the verdict of the masses of the people, given by
their own vote, on this constitution as against the
amendments which the hon. member has suggested.
As far as I know the people of my own colony, at
all events, I venture to say that they would accept
a constitution of this kind, while for democratic
reasons they would indignantly reject a constitution
which contained a proposal for the extravagant
embodiment of state rights, and the elevation of a
co-ordinate senate as a rival to the chamber which
they themselves created to express their will.
Dr. COCKBUEIS' ; First of all I would like to say
that in using the word “ democracy ” —and I think it
might be as well that we should come to an under-
standing as to what we mean by the term —1 meant
government by the people, the one form of govern-
ment only under which freedom is possible. The
hon. member who last spoke asked if I would trust
such large powers to a senate not directly represen-
tative of the people. I use, in reply to that, the old
argument which has been used over and over again—
that there is no reason whatever why the senate should
not be made just as representative of the people as
the house of representatives. The hon. gentleman
asks if I would intrust such powers to a house partly
elected by nominee members ? I protested also
against that. But you must take the constitution as
it is, if it is passed ; and, as against the flaw which
the hon. gentleman has detected in the senate, I set
up the flaw which we have found in the house of
representatives, and I would ask him, would he agree
to intrust freedom to a house partly based on the
exclusion of manhood suffrage, and elected by plural-
ity of votes ? Is not that as fatal a flaw in regard to
the house of representatives as is the other in regard
to the senate ? It is far worse.
Mr. Deakin: The house of representatives will
soon alter that!
Dr, COCKBUEN: I am astonished to hear my
hon. friend talk of centralisation as a system under
which the government of the people can flourish. It is
the first time I have ever heard any statesman of re-
pute give utterance to such an extraordinary statement.
Mr. Deakin : Gambetta!
Dr. COCKBUEN: I consider that the whole ques-
tion was summed up at the conference at Melbourne
last year by Sir John Hall, when he said that
democracy, which is government by the people, de-
mands that the government should be within sight
and hearing of the people. Surely the hon. gentle-
man will not attempt—surely the English language


was never meant to be so twisted as to say that
centralisation can in any way be compatible with
democracy or with the power of the people ?
Mr. Dearth : Gambetta !
Dr. COCKBURN: Local freedom and government
by the people are inseparable.
Mr, Dearth : Hear, hear !
Dr. COCKBURN : Surely the hon. member docs
not mean for a moment to assert to the contrary !
Now, a very ingenious argument —an argument which
I foresaw at an early stage of the debate, and partly
anticipated then —was raised by the hon. member in
regard to the war of secession. I was speaking of
the old parties —the party which was headed by cen-
tralisers such as Hamilton, and the party, headed by
Jefferson, for local government or state rights. After
a time, as I mentioned in a former debate, the party
questions got confused, and by nothing so much as
the war of secession, because then, very strangely, that
party which had always made for liberty and state
rights claimed, by a curious irony of fate, as a part of
their right under their claim of state rights to establish
and maintain slavery. The party of liberty became the
party of slavery, and the party for centralisation be-
came, by most curious historical irony, the party in
favour of freedom. It was that confusion of thought
that entirely abolished the old lines of parties in
America, and, as a matter of fact, the parties in
America no longer exist. They were destroyed ; all
the reason of their existence was destroyed by the war
of secession. Liberty and slavery got so mixed up that
no one knew where they were. The centralisers were
for liberty, the people for local freedom were for
slavery, and the result has been, as has been well
stated by Mr. Goldwin Smith, that the issues are so
confused that the two casks representing the old
parties, the federalists and the democrats, no longer
retain the odour of the liquor with which they were
once filled. So that any argument taken from that
source is very ingenious, but is entirely opposed to
fact. The whole issue has been traversed and de-
stroyed by that miserable war in which for once
the states rights men happened to be wrong; and,
although they were the exponents of freedom from
the very commencement of the constitution, they set
themselves against the very essence of freedom and
personal liberty. I think the hon. gentleman will
not attempt to press that.
Mr. Clarr : That version will stand correction yet!
Mr. McMillah : There is another view!
Mr. Dearth : Quite another view !
Dr. COCKBURN: Well, history is capable of
very different interpretations. However, I think
nothing is clearer than that the parties destroyed
themselves over that business, and nothing which has
occurred since can be traced to the old parties.
There is no doubt that this confusion of thought in
America, this destruction of the states rights party
by allowing themselves to be besmirched with the
infamy of slavery, has been fraught with very dis-
astrous results to the Government of America as a
government by the people. What with the con-
stantly eating power of the central government
taking away from their powers on the one side,
and what with the growth of municipal powers
on the other, the area of action for the state gov-
ernments has become extremely limited—has be-
come so limited that we can no longer look to
America as that great field in which the problems,
social and industrial, of the future are to be -worked
out. Why, the local parliaments in America meet
only once in two years as a rule. I maintain
that the great function that Australia has to perform
among nations is to work out the great social and
industrial problems with which we find ourselves face
to face. That can only be done with all the prestige
that a government can secure. It can only be done
—and I know my hon. friend agrees with me in this
■ —with local governments. It cannot be done by
central influence ; it can only be done in experimental
plots. That is the reason why I tremble at the
thought of the prestige of state governments being
sapped, because it is necessary that they should have
all possible prestige in order to have an authority
adequate to work out these problems. I am afraid
if from the first you handicap the states rights, seeing
that the tendency is all the other way, —if from the
first you remove those buttresses which are necessary
to maintain those states rights, it will be one declivity
from the present local governments down to centra-
lisation. I can see nothing to stand in the way but
states rights, which, I maintain, all those who believe
in government of the people by the people ought to
the very utmost of their power to uphold.
Sir Samuel Griffith : What are the buttresses ?
Dr. COCKBURN: You take away co-ordinate
powers as to everything.
Sir Samuel Griffith : As to what ?
Dr. COCKBURN : As to money bills. Except as
to the introduction of measures the two houses have
co-ordinate powers in the two great federations of
the world. What is the central government to do ?
It is, first of all, to have the collection of £8,000,000
or £9,000,000 right away, and to have the right of
imposing any other taxation. We all know that the
tendency of all governments, and rightly so, is to
augment their own importance and to act up to the
full extent of their authority. We give the federal
parliament all the money and we give them powers
which are simply enormous. Under the heading of
military and naval defence of the commonwealth,
they can do almost everything. They can make
roads ; they can build railways ; they can lay sub-
marine cables ; they can erect enormous public works.
You give them the power under that one heading of
spending nearly the whole of the money.
Sir Samuel Griffith : What about the buttresses?
Dr. COCKBURN : I say that unless we give full
power to the senate to veto appropriations in detail,
and unless we give them that power without the
slightest ambiguity, then we remove the only but-
tress which state rights have. I said at the com-
mencement of my remarks that those who framed
this clause were in a dilemma. In America the con-
stitution was not based on ambiguity. The men
there who earned credit for themselves for all time
saw distinctly what they were aiming at, and then
expressed their thoughts in the most nervous English
possible, without the slightest trace of ambiguity.
This clause is, I say, ambiguously expressed, and
either really gives to the senate the power of veto in
detail, or it takes away from the senate that power.
It takes away the only safeguard which the state
rights have to avoid this machinery, which is being
started under the name of federation, from becoming
a central government; a unification of the whole of
Australia; a government so central and so distant
from many parts of Australia, that I maintain it is
inconsistent with the continuance of our local govern-
ment, especially with the maintenance of our separ-
ate states as experimental plots in which we can
work out the problems of the future, and in which the
new world may be looked to to redress the wrongs
of the old. I do hope that the state rights party
have not shown themselves at the very commence'
ment to be of such a character that after a few days
they can be seduced from the views which they
so rightly held at the commencement of our pro-
ceedings, and which they strengthened in every way
by precedents gathered from every confederation
which has stood the test of time.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I believe I am one
of the persons referred to by my hon. friend, Dr.
Cockburn, as the state rights party. I expressed my
opinion very plainly some weeks ago on this subject.
I do not think the principles I then maintained are
in the least degree departed from in this clause as it
now stands ; but I have always felt in dealing with


this matter that where there arc two strongly opposed
opinions in this Convention, unless we dealt with the
subject in a spirit of compromise, there .would be no
chance of arriving at a conclusion.
Mr. Dibbs: The majority have sometimes given
way to a small minority !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Ido not think so.
I think a reasonable compromise has been effected.
I do not intend to make a long speech ; still less do
I intend to indulge in any declamation. But I
should like to answer one observation made by the
hon. member, Dr. Cockburn. Ho tells us that this
clause is ambiguous. It is not ambiguous; it
expresses exactly what it means —exactly what is to
happen in every case where there is a difference
between the two houses. Where it fails in expres-
sion is this: it does not profess to prophesy what
will be the result of its wmrking under the constitution
wo propose to establish. In that sense there must
necessarily be clauses in a constitution which are
ambiguous. Who can say what will be the develop-
ment in the course of some thirty or fifty years of
some of the clauses we are now passing? Who can
tell what will be the precise manner in which these pro-
visions will work out ? Who can tell what will be the
practical operation of them ? What we propose to
do is perfectly plain. As to all laws, except two
classes, the rights of the two houses are completely
co-ordinate. As to the ordinary annual appropria-
tion bill, the senators have to express their wishes
in a manner different from that in which they express
them in regard to other bills. The same Avith regard
to taxation bills. And with these exceptions the
powers of the two houses are co-ordinate. I think
it is a very reasonable compromise, and that all those
in this Convention who really desire to see a federa-
tion of Australia brought about might fairly accept
it or something like it. Because, remembering the
old maxim—l do not know who first used the Avords—
“ that those who want the end must Avant the means,”
it is of no use for hon. members to profess to want
federation while they refuse to accept the means
necessary to obtain it. lam quite certain that unless
a compromise something like that proposed bo ac-
cepted, federation cannot be brought about.
Mr. Munro : Hear, hear. It will be utterly im-
possible !
Dr. Cockburn : That is to say, that those who
want unification will not abandon their aim.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I do not want unifi-
cation. I strongly object to it. lam perfectly satis-
fied that under this constitution there Avill be no
unification, because state rights will be perfectly pre-
served. That is my opinion, at any rate. Ido not
propose to make any further obsenutions. I will
merely repeat that if members of the Convention
really desire a federation they will not vote against
the only possible means of obtaining it.
Sir JOHN DOWNER: I do not think anyone
can doubt that my desire is to see federation brought
about. With me it is not at all a new-fangled notion.
From the very initiation, within my parliamentary
experience, of federation proposals I have been always
found a strong supporter of them. Upon this
question I scarcely think that those who take the
view I take of this matter —because they sincerely
entertain certain view r s as to the lines upon which a
true federation can be permanently maintained—
should be necessarily subject to the reflection that
they are not sincere in the cause of federation.
Sir, I think that if we are to have a federation of a
permanent nature it must, on its initiation, be founded
upon a perfect understanding, and on the most com-
plete good faith. If there be any ambiguity in
the language or in our intentions which is capable
of being interpreted by one portion of the dominion
in one direction and by another portion in another,
the true basis of federation has not been arrived at,
and instead of founding our arguments on mutual
good-will and a perfect comprehension of each other's
intentions, we are at the very outset sowing discord,
and I am sure will not be able to appreciate the
results which may follow. One reads the views which
are expressed by newspapers upon this question from
time to time, and one also hears the views expressed
here on the subject by various delegates. We are
told by one branch of the public press —which, if it
does not always represent, does sometimes to a large
extent direct public opinion—that the basis of this
bill is the recognition of the inferiority of the upper
house of the legislature proposed to be established —
the recognition of certain lines, which, in my opinion,
are absolutely inapplicable, although well known to
the English people, and which have been here in effect
faithfully preserved, the only v r ariation in sub- 1
stance from old constitutional lines in the bill
now before us being that the senate is- authorised
legislatively to do what it now does without legis-
lative authority. The law of the constitution, as
was well said by Bourinot in his essay on Cana*
dian federation, consists, not merely of the letter
of the law, but also of wdiat he calls the convention
of the laAv —understandings superadded to the law
which in strictness he says are not the law at all;
but which still have all the force and authority of
law, because they are the basis on which the law is
made. Our understandings superadded to the law
have all the force of public opinion to back them up,
and in this instance I say we ought to have a most
complete and perfect understanding as to what we
intend by this ucav departure in legislature. We
ought not only to settle Avhether or not, if it comes
to the bitter end, the senate representing the states
will have the practical power of substantially ex-
pressing its voice in matters upon which the legislative
councils of the different colonies are prohibited from
expressing theirs ; but whether, in addition to that,
it is the general understanding of delegates here in the
first instance, and beyond that altogether, whether
it is the general understanding of the people of
Australia, that that is to be the position of affairs.
Now, if the hon. member, Mr. Wrixon, in the very
able speech he delivered the other day, directly
expressed what this law is intended to be, and in so
speaking expressed the views of the delegates here
and of the people of Australia, I have A r ery little to
say. If we were now for the first time making a
constitution, if we had no precedents to guide us, no
traditions to influence us, it Avould matter little
whether Ave gave this power of amendment, if after-
wards we gave a power to substantially bring about
the same result, although in a different xvay. But
if this constitution is to be interpreted by analogy
and relation to constitutions that have preceded
it, with those with which we are most familiar, and
if this power of making a request is, after all, to
be merely an ad misericordiam appeal from the
senate to the house of representatives to oblige them
by making this or that amendment, the senate telling
them in effect in the same breath that if they will
not make it they, the senate, will not insist upon it,
then this provision, clear as it may be in the letter,
is nevertheless a delusion and a sham, and will bring
about in no way what the wurds would express.
That is the ground which I take. I had some notions,
which I baA T e expressed in the course of the debates
which xve have had, as to the kind of executive that
ought to exist. I am willing, on reflection, to leave
those altogether out of consideration, provided that
the two branches of the legislature are established in
proper relation to each other. I am quite satisfied
to leave it to Avhat has been constantly termed the
natural evolution of things to determine what shall
be the test of the durability of the executive, so long
as we have first settled the basis on which the two
branches of the legislature are to co-exist. If in
effect we have denied the senate the power of amend-
ment, though Ave mean them to have it in substance,


then we are not ingenuous. If, on the contrary, we
mean to make it appear that we are giving the power
of amendment in effect, while in substance we do
not intend it, then we are more disingenuous. My
objection is simply this: That the foundation of all
true federation should be in perfect sincerity and in
perfect mutual understanding, and I object to the
mode which has been adopted here, in which you
either give the substance, assuming not to give it, or
in which you adopt the converse of that proposition.
That is practically all I wish to say about it. "With
the senate as it ought to be, and I believe will be, and
as we have made every provision for making it, the
only true aristocracy, to use the words of the hon.
member, Sir Henry Parkes, an aristocracy of ability,
of worth, and in the general estimation of the public —
if that body, selected from the very best of the people,
surrounded by safeguards to ensure the best selection
is not fit to have power given to it co-ordinate with
the power of the other branch, selected more indis-
criminately and less carefully, I fail to see any
logical reason for the difference in their.authority.
All the analogies which have been drawn, both with
the House of Lords and the House of Commons,
have no application whatever. The analogies with
reference to the legislative councils and legislative
assemblies have more relation, but still those bodies
are by no means analogous. At all events, we have
surrounded in our bill the election of the represen-
tatives in the upper branch of the legislature with
every means to ensure their worthiness. We have
insisted upon their being resident in the dominion
for five years, whereas in the case of members of the
house of representatives wo have only insisted that
they should have resided three years. We have
insisted that the senators shall be above 80 years of
age, whereas for the house of representatives man-
hood has been considered to be a sufficient qualifica-
tion. We have insisted upon the senators being
selected by the elected of the people, whereas the
others are elected by the people themselves indis-
criminately. We have taken every means following
the analogy of the United States to ensure our senate
being as eminent in its personnel as that remarkable
body has always been eminent. For what could we
have been surrounding this body with all these pre-
cautions if it were not with the object of recognising
the states as entities with co-ordinate rights, acting
together with the other branch of the legislature, and
as a result taking care that those who represented
them should bo endowed with every qualification to
fit them for so onerous a position ? In this bill I
thiuk we are making a mistake. The powerful sen-
ate, as I believe the first senate will be, will no doubt
prove that the statements of the hon. member, Mr.
Wrixon, are absolutely accurate, and the result will
be a conflict amongst the states immediately arising
from misunderstanding, for which we, placed here to
bring about mutual understanding, cannot say for a
moment that we are not to some extent responsible.
It is on these grounds that I support the amend-
ment.
Mr. McMillan : I do not know whether it is the
desire of the Committee to take a vote on this matter
to-night. My own opinion is that we ought not, and,
as I wish to move an amendment, -which I should
like to have put in perhaps better phraseology than I
can command myself, 1 would much rather that the
debate should be adjourned now.
Air. Deakin: The hon. member. Mr. Munro, is
prepared to speak !
Mr. McMillan : In'that case, I will give way.
Air. MUNKO : We have now arrived at the point
where we have to decide whether or not our labours
shall bo in vain.
Air. Adte Douglas : No!
Mr. AIUNEO : Surely I have as much right to
express my opinion to that effect as the hon. member
has to say “no.” I confess that if there were no
other consideration than my personal view, I should
at once reject the compromise ive have arrived at, be-
cause I am entirely in favour of responsible govern-
ment, and responsible government can only exist by
the power of the government to control the finances.
I say that the compromise submitted on the present
occasion is one which, if I were only to consider my
personal view, I would at once reject as utterly un-
worthy of a free people to accept. I have, however,
to take into consideration the views of those opposed
to me, and I have a right to respect those views. See-
ing that those views go altogether contrary to mine,
I am willing to yield largely in order to have those
views given effect to. But I do know this, that if
the clause is carried as now proposed it will take all
the power that we possess, and all our influence, to
get our people to accept it. I also know that if it
be amended in the direction proposed, it will be
absolutely impossible to get the people of Victoria
to accept it. That being so, I feel the responsibility
of the position which I occupy. I have come to the
colony of New South Wales on the present occasion
with the determination to do everything in my power
to secure federation. I am not going to take up
much time. I want to know exactly how we are
placed. I say that I am prepared now to accept the
compromise arrived at by the Constitutional Com-
mittee, because I wish to respect the views of others.
But if wo arc to depart from that compromise, I am
satisfied that it will be utterly impossible for me to
ask the people of Victoria to accept it. I know
what their views are ; and I say that 1 should not be
justified in asking those people, who have the abso-
lute right now to make their own laws, to tax them-
selves as they think proper, to pay their debts as
they think proper, and do whatever they can as a free
people —to give up their rights and give up their
privileges and to be put in a position in which a
minority is to rule. The concession we are making in
accepting this proposal from the Constitution Com-
mittee is a concession which, as I have said, it will be
all we can do to justify. Being heart and soul infavour
of federation, I. am willing to accept a compromise ;
but I tell hon. members seriously that if they want to
have federation, and want the larger colonies to be
included, they will not accept the amendment, be-
cause if that amendment is accepted, it will be
utterly impossible for us to agree to it. I do not
think it will be of any use for me to go into the
question as to what the effect of the amend-
ment will be, or what the effect of the clause
as it is will be; all I have to do at present is to
deal with the matter from a practical point of view.
I ask myself, and my brother delegates here, are we
or are we not in favour of federation ? If we are
in favour of federation, we shall concede as much as
we can. The utmost that I could possibly concede
is what is contained in the clause as it stands.
Mr. Wrixon: With the amendment of which I
gave notice !
Air. MUNRO: I say most distinctly that the
clause as it stands does not accord with my views at
all. The clause as it stands is a restriction upon
public liberty, upon the rights of the people to tax
themselves. If I had my own way, I should have a
totally different clause ; but under the circumstances,
and to give way as far as I can to the views of other
people, I am willing to accept it. But I say in all
earnestness, that if the amendment of the hon.
member for South Australia is carried, as far as the
colony of Victoria is concerned, it will be utterly
impossible for us to attempt to federate.
Air. McMILLAN : 1 think 1 had better make
now the few remarks which I intended to make, and
indicate the kind of amendment which may possibly
be a compromise for both parties. We have had
some language of a rather peculiar and drastic char-
acter during the last couple of hours, and it has
been said that some of us have been perverted from


the faith with which we started in the Convention.
I am no pervert from the faith with which I started,
but, like other hon. members, I must accept the fact
that compromise is necessary when such divergent
interests appear to be concerned. Ido not pretend
to be a profound student of constitutional history,
but I have had the honour of listening to many
speeches in this Convention, and in a practical way,
and with my own common sense, I have tried to dis-
sect the views put forth by hon. members, and with all
due deference to those high constitutional authorities
—and lam particularly sorry to differ from my hon.
colleague, Sir Henry Parkes, and that very able man,
the ex-premier of Victoria, Mr. Gillies—men whose lead
I can follow, I think, on almost all political matters—
still in spite of their opinion I hold that it would be
far better, and would work better in the future, if
we allowed the senate, outside the appropriation bill
for services of the year, to have power to amend
money bills. I do not hold for one moment that
that senate, attracting the best men of Australasia
within its four walls, would be of that pettifogging
character that it would interfere with every little jot
and tittle connected with the expenditure sanctioned
by the house of represensatives. lam reminded, and
I only quote from memory of years ago, of the saying
of a man from whom we glean a great deal of our
political wisdom, that great and acknowledged power
is not injured either in appearance or in fact by an
unwillingness to exert it. The men who compose
that assembly will deal very carefully with all matters
connected with the people. They will know that the
lower house will have an appeal to the people —an
appeal which they cannot resist, and they are not
likely to lower their dignity by continual jealousy of
and wrangling with that assembly representing the
whole of the country. Ido not take up the position
which some hon. members take with regard to the
upper house as representing the different states of
Australasia. I know that that is one of the prominent
features connected with its functions, but at the same
time we are trying to erect a kind of government 011
the basis of previous constitutions. We, for good or
for evil, say that it is necessary to have two houses of
parliament; and I want to know, if you have two
houses of parliament, what is the good of the second
house unless it has the power of review, the power of
suggestion, and the power in every way of co-ordi-
nately dealing with legislation ? Now, let us look at
the progress of events. When our new constitution
comes into force, the first thing that will engage the
federal parliament will be a tariff bill —a taxation bill
for the whole of the colonies ; and will anybody say
that there will be any difficulty in a new departure
like that, in the very first great act of the new legis-
lature, with the upper chamber of that legislature,
not a nominee chamber, not an upper chamber like
the House of Lords, but an upper chamber, if not
itself directly drawn from the people, at least elected
by those who are drawn directly from the people ?
There is no doubt that between the divergent views
of the two parties there must be some compromise ;
but it is possible to make a compromise without at
the same time giving up every portion of the
principle. I must say that I would sooner see this
constitution not come into effect than see anything
done that would, to .any extent, lower or degrade
that properly co-ordinate branch of the legislature.
There are two ways of doing everything, and the
proposed mode of sending suggestions from the
properly co-ordinate chamber to the other chamber
is, to my mind, the most clumsy, the most undigni-
fied, and the most humiliating procedure that could
ever be enacted. Talk about following the lines of
the British Constitution! Why, you introduce here
a new principle which was never heard of before.
It has been heard of in South Australia, but I do not
Relieve it has ever been enacted.
Mr. PL4-T?ORP : It has worked for years!
Mr, McMILLAN : In South Australia.
Mr. Playpoed : Yes!
Mr, McMILLAN: But it has not been enacted.
Mr. Playpoed: No, but it has been in operation.
It has been agreed to !
Mr. McMILLAN: lam speaking o£ an enacted con-
stitution. As my hon. friend opposite said, the
senate will not come to the lower house in the digni-
fied position of a chamber offering advice, and giving
suggestions by right of its legislative power.
Mr. Playpoed: They would if it were so enacted !
Mr. McMILLAN : They would come, as has been
properly said, with an ad misericordiam appeal,
asking the other chamber to be gracious and kind
enough to take their suggestions into consideration.
Mr. Playpoed : No !
Mr. McMILLAN: We must remember that we
are making what is called a paper constitution. It
may be well enough for us, in the liberal spirit of our
debate, to say that we do not intend this to be an
undignified procedure; but once it is crystallised into
an act of parliament you will have the lawyers through-
out Australia dealing with it as a paper enactment,
and would it not be a fair inference for any member
of the house of representatives to say, “ This upper
chamber has no right to dictate to us ; the constitu-
tion only gives them the right to make ad misericor-
diam representations ; they are not in any way equal
to us ”? I use this very strong language to show
that I am still of the opinion with which I entered
the Convention with regard to the judiciousness on
our part, with the view of carrying out federation, of
giving both houses co-ordinate powers. Still, there
must be some compromise, if we are to bring about
federation at the present time. What I should pro-
pose would be this : Of course, it is allowed on all
hands that it would be very inconvenient for the upper
house to interfere with the different items in the ap-
propriation bill, which simply appropriates re-
venue and carries out a settled policy involving no
new departure ; but no upper house would care
to interfere with such a bill, because there is no
doubt that the executive authority would be
more or less represented in the lower house. How-
ever, we now come to deal with the question of
a new policy, with the question of taxation, which
must be one of the more radical questions in any
federation of this kind. What I should propose —
and it is not essentially different from the present
proposition, but, to my mind, will maintain the
dignity of the upper house—is that the upper house,
when it receives these money bills, should have a
right to discuss them, and to amend them in the
same way as they do any other bills.
Sir Hekey Paekes : No !
Mr. McMILLAN: Then their amendments will
go down to the lower house, not as suggestions, but
in the ordinary constitutional way. Supposing the
lower house accepts half of the amendments and
rejects half of them, we can make it absolutely
necessary when the bill is returned to the upper
chamber for that body to either accept or reject it.
Mr. Playpoed : It is the same thing, only in
different words !
Mr. McMILLAN : You get the same thing ; but
you do not introduce a miserable subterfuge, which
degrades and lowers the dignity of the upper chamber.
Sir Heney Paekes : It in no way degrades it!
Mr. McMILLAN : Let us look at the question a
little further. Anybody would think that this power
of veto was to be dormant; but surely if you give
the power of veto, you give one of the strongest and
most powerful motives for the rejection of the whole
measure.
Colonel Smith : A great deal too strong !
Mr. McMILLAN: The hon. gentleman would give
the upper house nothing at all. The means which I
propose would to a certain extent, bring about
finality. There can be no finality between bodies of


this kind, except by compromise and mutual concession,
or, in the case of the lower house, by ultimate appeal
to the people. By adopting the proposal I suggest,
you do not strain the constitution; you do not put
within the four corners of this enactment something
which, by inference, may be said to show clearly that
the upper house is on a lower status than the lower
house, with which it is to be co-ordinate. It seems
to me that if my proposition is adopted, you allow
the members of the upper house to go through the
bill in the ordinary way upon the ordinary lines, and
instead of their amendments going down as sugges-
tions, they go dow r n in the first place as amendments
—as indications of what they require to be done, if
they are to pass the bill. Of course at all times, as
now in the case of every ordinary bill, they are quite
open to agree to a compromise, even upon their own
amendments. And when the bill comes back, I sug-
gest that it should either be accepted or rejected, so
as to bring about to a certain extent finality. This,
I believe, would be a much more acceptable form of
carrying out what I can only conceive is a very
clumsy device, and it in no way derogates from the
dignity of the upper house ; but at the same time
keeps together the ordinary form of our constitution,
and will, I believe, in every way effect what is at-
tempted to be effected by the clause. The reason I
asked for an adjournment was because I would rather
have my own views put into shape by a legal member
of the Committee, and I shall then be very glad to
see a vote upon the question. I cannot vote for the
sweeping amendment of the hon. member, Mr. Baker,
because I still think that the appropriation bill should
be left entirely in the hands of the lower house for
convenience more than for anything else. It deals
with the appropriation of revenue to be raised on a
policy to which the upper house has previously
agreed, and it does not stand on any analagous
footing whatever with the new policy adopted with
regard to money bills. That is all I have to say, and
1 should like very much to be able on Monday to test
the feeling of the Committee on the subject.
Sir HENRY PARKES : I only rise to say that if
an amendment of the character which is suggested is
moved, I shall feel it my duty to submit another
amendment restricting the senate from amending or
touching in any way bills appropriating revenue, or
imposing new burdens upon the people.
Progress reported.
ADJOURNMENT.,
Motion (by Mr. McMillan) proposed ;
That the Convention do now adjourn.
Mr. BROWN: On the motion for the adjourn-
ment of the Convention, I take the opportunity of
expressing my very great regret that urgent private
business will compel me to leave Sydney to-morrow.
I need not say that, having taken the interest I have
taken in this important subject, it is a matter of great
regret that I am compelled to leave before the work
of the Convention is completed, as I hope it will be.
I rise more for the purpose of expressing now —as I
shall not have the opportunity of expressing it at a
more fitting time hereafter —the obligation which I,
in common with other members of the Convention,
feel that we are under to the Government and people
of New South Wales for the manner in which we
have been received on this important occasion. I do
most sincerely hope that the difference of opinion
that has arisen amongst the various delegates will be
arranged, so that when the work for which this Con-
vention was called together is completed a measure
will be placed before the citizens of Australia which
will meet with their approval, and that we shall find
that our work here has not only not been in vain,
but that we have contributed to the building up to
the great Australian union which we are all desirous
pf seeing established, I regret that I am compelled
to leave. I have not taken any very active part in
the debates of the Convention because I have found
from time to time that the ideas I should have been
inclined to express have been taken up by others.
Therefore I did not think it necessary to trespass on
the time of the Convention. I have, however, fol-
lowed the debates very carefully, and I think those
who estimate the work of the Convention by the
mere number of the hours during which it has been
sitting here formally would form a very inadequate
idea of the work which has been accomplished.
Yery much work has been done by the committees,
to whom we are very much indebted, and very much
more work also, I am satisfied, has been done by the
private consultations of hon, members with one
another. I desire, as I have stated, to take this
opportunity of returning my sincere thanks to the
people and the Government of New South Wales for
the manner in which we have been received here, and
to congratulate you, sir, on the success so far
achieved.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Convention adjourned at 6.17 p.m.
MONDAY, 6 APRIL, 1891.

ADDRESS.
The President : I have received a letter from
Tuckurimba, which I request the secretary to read.
The secretary read the following letter .
Tuckurimba, 27 March, 1891.
The Hon. Sir Henry Parkes,
President of the Federal Conference.
Sir, —As secretary of the Tuckurimba Progress Committee,
I feel very much gratified to have to forward to you the
following resolution, which was unanimously adopted at our
meeting, very largely and representatively attended, on the
24th instant:—
That this committee desire to convey to the Federal Conference, through
its president, the hope that its deliberations may result in the forming of
a united Australian nation; and that this resolution be sent by our
secretary to the President of the Federal Conference now sitting at Sydney.
I have, &c.,
Henry M. McCaughey.
COMMONWEALTH OE AUSTRALIA BILL.
In Committee (consideration resumed from 3rd
April) ;
CHAPTER 1. —THE LEGISLATURE.
Part V.—Powers of the Parliament.
Clause 55. (1.) The senate shall have equal power with
the house of representatives in respect of all proposed laws,
except laws imposing taxation and laws appropriating the
necessary supplies for the ordinary annual services of the
government, which the senate may affirm or reject, but 5
may not amend. But the senate may not amend any pro-
posed law in such a manner as to increase any proposed
charge or burden on the people.
(2.) Laws imposing taxation shall deal with the imposi-
tion of taxation only. 10
(3.) Laws imposing taxation, except laws imposing
duties of customs on imports shall deal with one subject
of taxation only.
(4.) The expenditure for services other than the ordinary
annual services of the government shall not be authorised 15
by the same law as that which appropriates the supplies
for such ordinary annual services, but shall be authorised
by a separate law or laws.
(5.) In the case of a proposed law which the senate may
not amend, the senate may at any stage return it to the 20
house of representatives with a message requesting the
omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein.
And the house of representatives may, if it thinks fit, make
such omissions or amendments, or any of them, with or
without modifications. 3


Upon which Mr. Baker had moved, by way of
amendment:
That all the words in sub-section 1, after the first word
“ laws, ” line 3, be omitted.
Mr. THYNNE: I think this question deserves a
little more consideration than is proposed to be given
to it by some hon. gentlemen who wish to see it
disposed of immediately. We have now come to one
of the clauses of the bill to which a great deal of
importance is attached by, I think, every member of
the Convention. It is a clause the effect of which
may have such an influence in directing the opera-
tions of the commonwealth and its parliament in the
future that I think it would be unwise for us to pass
over this important matter without giving it the very
fullest consideration we are capable of giving it. In
dealing with this question I propose to occupy the
time of the Convention for a few minutes, and to
enter into a very careful consideration of some of the
matters which have arisen in this debate. The line
of thought which has urged me to get up and speak
has been suggested by an observation which was made
on our last meeting day by the hon. delegate, Mr.
Deakin. He then, no doubt, introduced into the
debates a new style of argument compared with what
had been adopted in this Convention, in the manner
in which he criticised the action of certain members
of the Convention in taking their seats in a particular
division that took place. The words which he used
struck me very much at the time; first of all,
because of the very forcible condemnation with which
the hon. gentleman uttered them, and, in the next
place, they struck me with surprise that of all the
members of this Convention the hon. member, Mr.
Deakin, should be found the one man in it who
would venture to attack any members of the
Convention for the position they took on that
occasion. The words the hon. gentleman used were
something to this effect, so far as I can recollect
them. He said, “ The extraordinary combination in
the last division, reactionary radicals and iconoclastic
conservatives sitting together on the same bench, was
enough to startle any member in any house in a con-
stitutionally governed country.”
Colonel Smith : That is quite right!
Mr. THYNNE: That the hon. member, Mr.
Deakin, should have been the person in this Conven-
tion to make that attack upon any member of it, is a
matter that struck me with great surprise, because,
in the history cf these colonics if there has ever been
a union of “ reactionary radicalism and iconoclastic
conservatism,” that horn member and his colleagues
in Victoria have proved it in history.
Mr, Muneo : What has that to do with the
business before ns now ?
Mr. THYNNE: It has a good deal to do with the
business, and the hon. gentleman will, 1 think, see
before I conclude that it has ; at any rate, in some
minds it has a very important bearing on the business
before the Convention. In political matters one may
see these violent conjunctions of opposing parties and
these strange combinations. They are justifiable in
the face of extraordinary crises. They are only
justified when something arises which overshadows
all the leading points of the party organisations of
the country. Then, and only then, it is that states-
men are at liberty with credit to themselves to post-
pone the advocacy and the enforcement of their
political principles when it amounts merely to a
temporary withdrawal of them to allow the danger
of the.crisis to pass by. But we have seen these gentle-
men who are so ready to attack the motives or the posi-
tion of other delegates —we have seen for seven long
years what I may call an extraordinary connection of
radicalism and conservatism living and thriving under
the powerful influence of ray hon. friend, Mr,
Deakiu; thriving to an extent which I think is
absolutely without precedent in any part of the
British dominions. Ido not refer to these matters
for the sake of making a retort or an attack upon
those hon. gentlemen; but the train of thought
which was suggested by that hon. gentleman’s remarks
has led me to question what ought to be the influence
which these delegates should have upon the members
of the Convention in dealing with the important
question of the relative position of the several states
to the federal parliament. Now, any set of men
advocating seriously and entertaining strong opinions
upon political matters, and who for some unknown
reason w r ill abandon their views for such a long term
as seven or eight years cannot but undergo some
deterioration. They must suffer some deterioration
in their political prestige and principles by what can-
not I think under any circumstances be justified;
and the people who have not been, as the hon. gentle-
man says, startled by the extraordinary sight of these
two opposing elements sitting, not merely on the same
bench in a casual division, but sitting in the same
ministry, conducting the affairs of the colony for
seven or eight years —a period, I think, almost with-
out precedent in these colonies —the people whose
sense of political propriety and of the correct conduct
of political affairs has not been startled by that
extraordinary combination, and have submitted to it,
must also have suffered some of the deterioration
which their leaders underwent. I think these
extraordinary combinations of reactionary radical-
ism and iconoclastic conservatism —I like the sound
of those words —really have an effect which is not
good either for the members of the combinations
or for the men who follow them in their political
career. Another sentiment which has been ex-
pressed by hon. gentlemen has struck me with a great
deal of suprise. The hon. gentleman professes
to be a great leader of democracy, and yet he is
incapable or professes himself to be incapable of
accepting the position which the hon. member, Hr,
Cockburn, so clearly laid down: that it is necessary
to protect the real rights of the people, as far as
possible, by having a strong local government. The
hon. gentleman goes in for advocating complete cen-
tralisation. I must say that I am very much
astonished to find that the democracy of Victoria,
of which I take the hon. gentleman to be the leading
representative, is of that description. And when I
look back upon the history of popular thought in
A’ictoria; when I look back upon the great victories
which, in times gone by, democracy has won, I am
afraid to sav under other leaders, I cannot but think
that they have for a moment forgotten the object for
which they combined originally, and have now des-
cended from being a democracy for the establishment
of liberty to a democracy seeking some less worthy
object. I would again for a moment, sir, ask to be
permitted to refer to the working of this combination.
1 was very much interested some time ago in reading
of a traveller in Russia being pursued by the fierce
wolves that infest the steppes, and who in terror of
his own destruction from their teeth sought to gain a
short respite by throwing overboard one of his own
children. I do not say that my hon. friend, Mr.
Deakin, or any of his colleagues, have adopted the
extreme course which the unfortunate traveller felt
himself, in his terror, obliged to do; but I think
that these combinations, these unholy associations, for
a moment, have sustained their existence by casting
behind them with a very profuse and liberal hand—
not exactly the children who were coming after them,
but certainly the means of sustenance, the life-blood
of their existence, by those extraordinary expendi-
tures of which the Victorian people are now so
strongly complaining.
Mr. Muneo : Question!
Mr. Gillies : What has the hon. member to do
with that ?
Mr. THYNNE : I do not say that Victoria is the
only colony in the group which has pursued this
course ; but I think I am justified in alluding specially


to that colony, because of the extraordinary position
which its delegates take up in the Convention. The
representatives of no other colony take up the position
here which they do. The members of the Assembly
from Victoria present one solid phalanx in this Con-
vention. With two notable exceptions, which I will
mention presently, I think there is practically no mem-
ber of the Convention who advocates the extreme
view which they do. I cannot but express, if the
hon. member will allow me, my great sympathy with
the Premier of Victoria in having to succeed in the
management of its affairs.
The Chairman : Order. I have allowed the hon.
member to go on now for some time ; but I must call
his attention to the question before the Convention,
which is a proposal to omit all the w r ords in the Ist
sub-clause after the word “ laws.” It appears to me
that the hon. gentleman is not discussing that ques-
tion, but the policy of certain Victorian politicians,
which, I think he must see is irrelevant.
Mr. TIIYNNE: I bow to your ruling, sir. My
object was not to discuss Victorian politics, which I
do not profess myself to be capable of doing with
much effect; but I thought that on this clause I
should be justified in arguing with my colleagues in
this Convention against what seems to me to be the
stand taken almost alone by the representatives of
Victoria. I have endeavoured, in the remarks I have
been making, to explain, as'far as it is possible to do
so, the reason why the representatives of Victoria
have taken in this Convention an almost isolated
course. This is the crucial clause of the bill. Upon
the provision we make with respect to the legislation
of the federation depends its very existence.
Dr. Cockburn : The question is whether we are
to have federation or unification !
Mr. TIIYNNE: Quite so —whether we are to
have federation or unification. The w'hole case
depends upon the course the Convention take with
reference to this clause, and for that reason I am
venturing to speak somewhat fully, and I will now
add a few remarks which may, perhaps, be held to
bear a little more directly upon the point at issue. I
think I am within the rules of debate in referring to
the attitude a certain section of the Victorian
delegates have taken in this Convention. "Was there
any feature in our proceedings which struck members
of this Convention at the commencement of our
sittings so forcibly as the peculiarly selfish position
we all thought the representatives of Victoria took
up in what was called their claim for a guarantee ?
That claim was argued very strongly by the hon.
member, Mr. Dcakin, and that hon. member was
supported by the hon. member, Mr. Munro.
Mr. Munro : No!
Mr. THYNNE : I understood so.
Mr. Munro : But I say no !
Colonel Smith : That is passed and settled !
Mr. THYNNE: I think the delegates of Victoria,
coming soraewdiat hastily to this Convention, mistook
the real interests of the people of Victoria in taking
up the position that they did, and having been once
mistaken
Mr. Munro : Surely there is nothing of this in the
clause!
Mr. THYNNE: lam sorry the hon. members from
Victoria seem to feel so keenly the remarks I am
making.
Mr. Munro: We feel that the hon. member is not
talking upon the subject before the Committee; that
is all!
Mr. THYNNE; I am'sorry these gentlemen are
so sensitive to a little criticism. I have surely not
been unduly severe.
Colonel Smith : Oh dear, no. We are quite en-
joying it !
Mr. THYNNE: I would point out this: that if
the Premier of Victoria felt it necessary to repudiate
one portion of their claim, ho might find it equally
necessary, before the Convention is over, to withdraw
from the position which he and his colleagues ought
not to have taken up on the question of state rights.
Mr. Monro : We each express our own judgment!
Mr. THYNNE: I am afraid my hon. friend,
Colonel Smith, feels a little sore at my remarks.
Colonel Smith : Not at all. I am quite enjoying
them!
Mr. TIIYNNE: I have, however, to make to the
hon. gentleman something in the nature of an
apology. I regret that the hon. and gallant gentle-
man, for whom I have a great deal of respect, and
whom we are all very glad to see in this Convention,
was so ready to talk of packing up his portmanteau
and running away from us. I at first thought the
hon. gentleman was not taking up a position which a
gallant gentleman ought to occupy; but I have
changed my views with regard to the hon. gentle-
man’s object.
Colonel Smith : I have also changed my mind!
Mr. TIIYNNE: I think the hon. gentleman has
been playing the part of an able tactician, and that
he has been making merely a feint to retire, that his
feint has been nearly successful, and that even gentle-
men from Victoria, and many other members of the
Convention, are on the brink of being led into a
trap which the hon. gentleman, in his able general-
ship, has laid for them. In other respects, if the
hon. member has not converted very many mem-
bers in the Convention to his own way of thinking
he has certainly advocated the claims of Ballarat
very extensively.
Colonel Smith : A very fine place is Ballarat!
Mr. TIIYNNE : I have nothing more to say with
reference to the hon. member. With regard to my
hon. friend, Mr. Wrixon, another delegate from Vic-
toria, we find that it has hitherto been almost the
invariable rule in Australian politics that distinguished
statesmen who have left the colonies for a short time,
on business howsoever important, have found it neces-
sary to undergo on their return some period of polit-
ical quarantine before returning to political power.
I do not hesitate to express my own feeling that the
gentlemen comprised in this particular section of the
Victorian delegation do not express here the better
thought of the Victorian people. If they do ex-
press that better thought, if the Victorian people
have really taken up in their hearts the position these
gentlemen represent, the question arises in my mind
as to whether, under those circumstances, they have
yet risen to the federal atmosphere—to an atmo-
sphere entitling them to come into this Convention.
I should not feel very much aggrieved if they had
not come in, because I feel that it will not be very
long before they will bo made to ask for admission
to the federation, which I hope will be brought about
sooner or later as the result of our discussions. Apart
from the hon. gentlemen of whom I have already
spoken, there are two prominent and able members
of the Convention who, to a certain extent, support
the views to which I have referred. One of these
is our very highly respected and venerated Presi-
dent, Sir Henry Parkes. I have listened care-
fully to every word that has fallen from him ; I have
sought in his words for some guidance and assist-
ance in coming to a conclusion on some of the most
important questions with which we have had to deal ;
but I must say I have not heard fall from him anv
clear description of the form of government we shall
have to adopt here, because at one time while the
ton. member has spoken of a federal government
in terms to which I cannot but give my hearty
adherence, he has, at other times, spoken of follow-
ing the example of the British Constitution as far
as it is possible to do so. Up to a recent period I
have been left in some doubt as to what would
really be the hon. gentleman’s definition of what
our federal parliament should be. I have not
heard in his many able speeches that clear definition,


that clear division of the points at issue, for which
I had hoped, and which I still hope to receive
at his hands. I speak, of course, with the very
greatest respect for the hon. gentleman; and I will
now pass on to another exception to the general rule
in this convention. I refer to the hon. member, Mr.
Blayford. He has, I think, put forward in this Con-
vention the most important objection to giving the
senate and house of representatives coequal powers.
His objection is that if we give the two houses coequal
powers, we cannot have responsible government. I
am not very much afraid of that, although it seems
to me —and I have at the same time great respect for
the opinions of a gentleman who has had such a large
experience in the working of responsible govern-
ment —that responsible government is one of those
things that will adapt itself to almost any circum-
stances which may arise. It has evolved itself from
a system of government in which there has been
practically coequal powers between two houses at
one time or other, and I think it may be trusted still
to establish itself among English-speaking people in
these colonies. It is a thing which it is extremely
hard to define. You cannot lay down lines upon
which it may or may not act; but I think, even
under coequal houses, with a little forbearance
and common-sense which we will expect to find in
those two houses, a system of responsible government
will not only exist, but it will exist in a better con-
dition than it does at present. I wuuld ask the hon.
member, Mr. Blayford, with his great practical ex-
perience and practical mind, whether he prefers to
preserve responsible government for the federation
at the risk of its destruction in the states, or whether
he prefers to have responsible government preserved
in the states at the risk of some slight modification
of it in the federal parliament ? In the scheme, as
it stands at present, it is proposed that a very large
and most important section of the revenue of each
colony shall be handed over to the federal govern-
ment. In looking over some figures last night I
found that from Victoria something over £3,500,000
of their revenue will be taken away by the federation,
and I dare say it will be the same in proportion in
the other colonies. I would ask the hon. member,
Mr. Blayford, how he will explain the future work-
ing of responsible government, which, if it does any-
thing, places upon the administration as its greatest
duty the financial management of affairs in each
colony. How can responsible government be main-
tained in these colonies when they have no means of
ascertaining how much of their revenue is to come
back to them, and when they have no means of in-
fluencing effectually the expenditure of the money
taken into the federation ? Next year, or the year
after federation has been accomplished, how can the
treasurer of any colony prepare with any confidence
a financial statement P How can he tell how much
money he is likely to get, or what his revenue is to
be ? It will be very difficult for the treasurers to do
so for many years until, with our usual adaptability
to circumstances, we get accustomed to the new cur-
rent of affairs.
Dr. Cockbubn : They need not count on getting
much back!
Mr. THYNNE : My small contribution to the dis-
cussion on this point is this : That unless the parlia-
ments of the colonies have by their representatives in
the senate an effective voice in preventing extrava-
gance in the federal parliament, those parliaments
will never be able to count upon their revenue, or as
to what their means of sustenance will be. The
federal parliament will be like the hunter sitting at
his table with his hounds around him, waiting to have
cast to them the bones which are left after he has had
his meal. The states will indeed be in a subordinate,
a degraded position ; and they will never be able to
maintain their influence or the power which I at least
am desirous they should maintain.
Dr. Cocksure : They will exist on charity!
Mr. THYNNE : On charity, or what may he
worse, on favouritism, or, at any rate, on principles
which will not be likely to conduce to the self-respect
of the parliaments of the different states or of the
people whose affairs they administer. With regard to
the clause itself, I think that these words, “The ordi-
nary annual services of the government,” form one of
those elastic terms which mean nothing at all, which
will form no restriction. It is certainly a very poor
sentence upon which to distinguish the lines accor-
ding to which one house of parliament may act under
certain circumstances and may not act under other
circumstances. There are two distinct parties in this
Convention upon this question. One party says,
“ With the clause as it stands now, we are practically
getting all that we ask.” The other party says,
“ We are making concessions, and we are, at any rate,
preserving the power of one house somewhat at the
expense of the other.” If this clause is intended by
one party'to unduly curb the power of the senate, I
think that the clause in its present form ought not
to appear in a constitution act framed in Australia.
If, on the other hand, it is intended to operate, as I
am afraid it will, inimically to the interests of the
states composing the federation, it is not one that
ought to appear in our constitution. In any case,
it is really only a form of regulation of parliamentary
procedure between the two houses and one which I
think we ought to leave entirely to the capacity and
good sense of the two houses which we hope to see
elected under this constitution. I am afraid I have
trespassed on the feelings of some hon. gentlemen,
but I have been obliged to do so in order to explain
as well as I could the reason why I give my support
to the amendment moved by the hon. member, Mr.
Baker,
Mr. BIED : I hope the members of the Conven-
tion generally have spent Sunday more profitably
than, I think, the hon. member, Mr. Thynne, has
done. I think that, instead of going to church, like
a good Christian, and listening to a sermon from a
minister, he has spent yesterday in preparing a ser-
mon for Victoria in general and the representatives
of Victoria and some other hon. members in par-
ticular. However pleasant that sermon may have
been to deliver, I do not think it will produce more
effect on those who listened to it than was produced
by many of the sermons delivered yesterday on those
who went to hear them. I performed the good
Christian’s part, and went to church twice ; there-
fore, I have had no time to prepare such a sermon as
that just delivered, which travelled over a field wider
than that which the question before the Convention
would permit. But I feel bound, in view of the
vote I intend to give on this question, to say a
few words in justification of that vote. In speak-
ing on this question on a former occasion in
this Convention, I expressed strongly my belief
that the senate ought to have co-ordinate powers
with the house of representatives. More par-
ticularly I then said it ought to have co-ordinate
powers if it were elected, as it ought to be elected,
directly by the people. Now, we have altered some-
what the constituency of the senate, or, rather, we
have not adopted that constituency which I believe
would have been the best. But, under the circum-
stances, with a senate constituted as it is to be consti-
tuted under the clause we have already agreed to, I
still feel that there could be no harm whatever, but
only the conferring of a right —and a proper right—
upon the senate, if we gave to it those powers which
we are asked to give to it by the amendment of the
hon. member, Mr. Baker. I cannot understand why
there is such a great fear expressed on the part of
several members of the Convention as to giving the
senate such powers as those. I think it must arise
very largely on the part of those hon. members from
their having had no such experience as some of us


have had in other colonies as to the working of
similar powers when possessed by the upper houses.
As is well known, in Tasmania the upper house has a
considerable power in dealing with money bills ; but,
beyond the annoyance naturally felt by the lower
house when their measures are seriously amended by
the upper house, no great evil, if any, has resulted iii
the long run. And so in South Australia ; I under-
stand that a practice which runs very much on the
lines proposed in this bill has been in operation
there, and has worked fairly well. Therefore, with
such experience as we have had in South Australia
and Tasmania of partial or complete power in regard
to money bills being possessed by the upper house, it
seems to me exceedingly strange that there should be
so much hesitation and unwillingness to give to the
senate more power in regard to money bills than
is possessed by several upper houses in the colonial
legislatures. Considering that we shall have in
the senate as good men certainly as we shall have
in the house of representatives, men as well able to
judge upon the various matters brought before them
as any in the house of representatives, does it not
strike hon. members as strange that they should not
have the right even to express their opinion upon
matters of expenditure or taxation in the way in
which some hon. members w r ould wish to prevent
'them from doing ? If we acknowledge that those
who are to be members of the senate are men of
good standing, men of good judgment, men chosen
by the elect of the people, together with some who
are nominated by the governments of the various
colonies, who are supposed to nominate those who
are in many respects representative men —if w r e are
going to have men of this class, why hesitate to give
them the pow r er claimed for them by some to deal
with bills of all kinds ? But whilst I hold strongly
that the amendment ought to be carried, and that
the senate ought to have this pow r er, yet knowing, as
I do, that Victoria and New South Wales are
hardly likely to join the federation if any greater
concession is made than is already in the bill in
regard to the powers of the senate, and desiring, as
I most strongly that we should not insist upon
provisions which may possibly—or, I should say,
probably—-have the effect of excluding such colonies
as Victoria and New South WAles from the federa-
tion, I feel that, however strong one’s views are in
regard to the powers wdiich the senate ought to
possess, we ought to have consideration for the
interests of the federation as a whole, and not to
push our principles so far as to exclude colonies like
those.
Mr. Donaldson ; Eather sacrifice all the other
colonies!
Mr. BIED: No. I do not consider that by the
proposal now before us all the other colonies are
being sacrificed, but that there is a large concession
made to them. The concession made in the bill is
perhaps a larger concession than some hon. members
appear to think it. Ido not know really whether, if
they had the power to amend money bills and send
their amendments to the lower house embodied in a
bill, the senate would have any more power than they
will have under the concession now placed before us.
There is 'just this difference; Instead of embodying
their amendments in the bill and sending it down to
the representative chamber, their amendments will be
embodied in a message and sent down for the consi-
deration of the house of representatives, the message
accompanying the bill. Therefore, in the house of
representatives there would be the same consideration
given to the proposed amendments of the senate as if
they were in the bill and sent back in the ordinary
way.
Mr, Adye Douglas : If clause 5 is struck out,
what then ?
Mr, Cutioert : There is no danger of that!
Mr. BIRD: I am going to argue for the clause
standing in the bill as it is, believing the concession
made there to those who want to have co-ordinate
powers given to the senate is one that gives more
than some members appear to think. 1 feel that
whatever the views of the senate are, they can be ex-
pressed in the shape, provided for here, and will
receive due consideration from the house of represen-
tatives when brought before it—as due and full con-
sideration as if they were stated in the bill in the
ordinary way. lam so anxious that without great
sacrifice of principle we should secure the federation
of the colonies—and by no means should we pass a
provision that would exclude Victoria and New South
Wales —that I am quite prepared to agree to the
concession proposed in the bill, and not to press
for a further amendment giving a larger con-
cession, as is proposed by the hon. member for
South Australia. I felt it right to say this in justifi-
cation of the vote I shall give, as, having spoken as
I did on a former occasion, I might have been for
the sake of consistency compelled to vote for the
amendment. But considering the expressions of
opinion that we have had, and particularly the state-
ment from the premiers of New South Wales and
Victoria that neither of those colonies can join the
federation if the senate is to have powers equal to
those of the house of representatives, I am disposed
to vote against Mr. Baker's amendment, and thus
agree to a compromise for the sake of the federation
of the whole of the colonies.-
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS: The speech which the
hon. member has just made is one I might have ex-
pected from him, that is to say, that he would argue
one day in one way and vote in the opposite direc-
tion the next day. Either the senate ought to main-
tain its position, or it ought to give it up at once
without any condition whatever. Is the senate to
have any powers at all, or is it to retain such powers
as it was intended to give it ? When we started it
was proposed to give the states equal representation
in the senate, because they had virtually no power in
the house of representatives. Therefore, you say
you will make it up by giving them power in the
senate. The sth portion of the clause gives a most
extraordinary method of providing -ways and means
to do nothing, because any legislature at present has
power within itself to do what that clause expresses,
and hon. members must have been aware of it.
When this clause was agreed to in committee, it was
understood that it was merely put in the bill in order
that it might be debated in the Convention. The
amendment of Mr. Baker for striking out these ex-
ceptional matters puts the senate in its proper
position—it gives it power to exercise a right which
they possess in taxing their several provinces in the
way in which they think they are justified in tax-
ing them. How are Ave to get on in the smaller
colonies simply because Victoria and New South
Wales said something on the subject ? On the last
occasion we heard that those colonies were divided.
It is not because the President and the Premier of
Victoria have said that the colonies which they repre-
sent will not agree to this provision that Ave are to
assume that those colonies will not accept it. And
why should not the smaller colonies say, "We will
not agree to the bill" ? If they do so we shall have
a very fine arrangement between Victoria and New
South Wales, which, we know, cannot agree upon
any subject Avhatever, and are therefore sure to come
to grief in this matter. It is a well-known fact, and
we had experience of it on Eriday last, that these
colonies cannot agree. Immediately any question
arose between them it had to be set aside. They could
not agree on river navigation, upon railway manage-
ment, or upon any other subject.
Mr. Muxno: They agreed upon eA r erything!
Mr. ADAE DOUGLAS : They agreed upon every-
thing! Yes, they agreed to carry a bill which Avill


not be satisfactory to tbo other colonies. The
majority of the representatives of the smaller colonies
have stated that the proposed arrangement is not
suitable to them ; but they are to be left out of con-
sideration because some of the representatives of the
two big colonies have said that they will not agree to
the amendment. I say that a bill must be passed
which will be accepted in all the colonies, not one by
which one or two of the colonies will bo able to
domineer over the rest. The big colonies will have
sufficient power without being permitted to domineer
in that way. You might as w'ell say that Victoria
and New South "Wales are to settle the law s of the
W'hole of Australia as pass this clause as it is. That
is the meaning of it.
Colonel Smith : No !
Mr. AD YE DOUGLAS : Then what is the mean-
ing of it, if Victoria and New South Wales are to
have a representation of nine-tenths in the house of
representatives, and the house of representatives is
to control the senate ?
Mr. Muneo : They w ill pay nine-tenths of the taxes !
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS: What has that to do
w r ith it ? The individual citizens will not pay more
taxes, though conjointly they may pay more.
Mr. Mukeo : Taxation and representation must go
together!
Mr. ADYE DOUGrLAS : Have we not taken the
United States Constitution as our example in fram-
ing this bill; but w'hat does it say ? Does it not say
that the smallest states shall have the samereprescnta-
tion as the larger states, and did not many of the
small states at first remain out of the union until it
w T as arranged that they should have equal power ?
Colonel Smith : They were not offered the same
conditions as are offered now'!
Mr. Mooee: No!
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS: Well, you can make a
constitution between New' South Wales and Victoria;
but you will not have Tasmania, Queensland, and
South Australia in it. We know what Victoria has
done in the past. She has tried to cripple the smaller
colonies, and has put her foot down upon us, and a
big foot it is. Eut we are not to be dragged into
this federation wdicther we like it or not. I am
surprised that the hon. member who told us about
the sermon he heard yesterday should turn round
and go back upon himself and jump Jim Crow in
this Convention. In Tasmania his conduct will be
reprobated, and w'e shall know' how to treat him w'hen
he gets back there. We understand these things
there, and we are not to be domineered over,
notwithstanding this talk about the big colonies.
The hon. member, Mr. Munro, happens to bo
at the head of affairs in Victoria just now;
but a few months ago the hon. gentleman opposite
was in his place, and at the next election the
hon. member will probably be moved out again.
Eirst, w'e say that the senate and the house of
representatives shall be equal, and then w'e try to clip
the w ings of the senate, and prevent them from doing
anything; but I hope the delegates from the smaller
colonies will not yield to this oppression, to this
domineering, to these threats of the packing up of
carpet-bags and going away. Those wdio make them
might as w'ell go aw'ay, because the other colonies will
not join them in the federation they propose. I
trust that the delegates from the smaller colonies
will not be deterred from doing their duty tow r ards
those colonies by anything w'hich has taken place
here, or by the attempt which has been made to put
dowm argument by force and threats that “ we wall
take off our traps, and remain no longer amongst
you.” 1 say that the smaller colonies have justice on
their side. They ought to be represented in the
senate as w r as agreed upon at the starting-point, and
they should not be prevented from exercising the
game rights and privileges there as the larger colonies
exercise, without regard to their population.
Mr. J. FORREST: My object in rising is not to
tell lion, members that I have changed my opinion,
but to say that I intend to vote, as I said I would
vote at first, for the amendment of the hon. member,
Mr. Baker. It seems to me that this is the only
clause in the bill which would give security to the
colonies with small populations, and I feel certain
that it would be very difficult indeed to induce those
colonies to join the federation if we told them that both
of the great colonies, Victoria and New South AVales,
would have more representatives in the lower house
than the whole of the other colonies put together,
unless we could at the same time tell them that the
various colonies would have equal representation in the
senate, and that the powers of the senate, and of the
house of representatives, would be co-equal and co-
ordinate. It seems to me that the senate which will
be chosen under this bill will be very different in its
composition from our present upper houses, and will
not be imbued with local politics and local disputes,
but will be an august and experienced body, and I
hope will be thoroughly representative. If they will
not be thoroughly representative, all I can say is, that
I hope that some other means will be devised by
which they will become as thoroughly representative
as the lower house, and that no occasion will be left
to those who are opposed to having any upper house
to taunt them with not representing any one but
themselves. It seems to me that the proposal to
make the lower house superior to the senate can only
result in lowering its prestige, in making it appear to
the people of Australia an inferior body—a body
with a disability upon it. Can anyone say that the
upper house, as it is proposed to create it under this
bill, will be less experienced, less wise, less patriotic,
and less able than the house of representatives? I
believe that they will be, if anything, a superior
body, thoroughly representative, wise, and patriotic,
and I see no reason why we should be unwilling
to give them full power to deal with all matters
connected with the legislation of the continent in
all classes of bills. Wo have heard a great deal,
during our rather protracted deliberations, from the
delegates representing the larger colonies which
we have never heard from those representing the
smaller colonies. AVe have heard no threats that
they will pack up their carpet-bags, and that their
colonies will not accept the bill, from those repre-
senting smaller populations. AVe heard one large
colony say, through its premier: " A ictoria will
not have the bill," and a little later we heard
that " New South AVales will not have it." I think
it will be time enough to say that these colonies will
not accept the measure after it has been referred to
them in the proper manner, and surely before we
separate some means will be devised for referring
this matter to the people of the colonies. But can
anyone at present say that the Colony which he
represents is prepared to accept the bill when we
pass it ? I say that no one here has authority to
make such a statement. Equally the rule applies
that if they cannot say the colony will accept it they
cannot say that the colony will reject it. AVe have
been sent to the Convention to frame a constitution
in the best way we can, and when we have arrived at
our conclusions will be the time to say whether the
bill is one which the people can accept or not. AVe
have come to the Convention, I maintain, on perfectly
equal terms, although some of us have come from
colonies containing small populations. AVe do not
come here to be threatened ; we, who represent small
populations, have our duty to perform equally with
those who represent large populations. AVe heard
harangues the other day as to what the democracy of
Australia would receive, and as to what the demo-
cracy of Australia would not receive. I suppose
these sentiments came from those who would be
leaders of this great democracy. It seemed to me
that a considerable amount of jealousy was imported


into the debates by the rival candidates —those who
wish to be the sole leaders of what they call the
democracy of Australia. I can only say that, as far
as I am personally concerned, I have a duty to per-
form to the Parliament which sent me here, equally
to that of the Premier of Victoria, and I shall have
to answer for my vote when I return in the same way
as he or any other member of the Convention will
have to do. How can I, then, go back to the colony
I represent, and tell the people that, by my vote, I
left them to the complete mercy of the larger popu-
lations? They would naturally say, “ Why you are
going to annihilate us, and to leave us entirely at
their mercy.” I might reply, “ They are magnani-
mous, generous people ; they will not do anything
that is wrong or harsh.” The answer would be,
“ Eemember that we are now an autonomous state,
and we do not wish to be left at the mercy of any
one.” It would be no argument for me to say “You
must trust to the magnanimity or generosity of the
people of the larger colonies.” It seems to me that
if a union is to exist it must be on terms just to all
the people of Australia.
Mr. Mtjnro : Hear, hear !
Mr. J. FORREST : It would be ridiculous for any
one of us, representing small colonies, to return to
our homes and to tell the people that they would be
represented in a house containing nearly 100 mem-
bers by four members, and that they would have
equal representation in the upper house ; but that
that representation would not possess coequal powers
with the representation of other colonies. I think
the best course to pursue is to pass the bill in the
best way we can, and in accordance with the views
of the majority of the members present. I hope,
however, we shall have no more threats as to this or
that colony not joining the federation.
Mr. Muneo ; That is what the hon. member has
done !
Mr. J. EOEEEST : I have never said that the
colony of Western Australia will not join, nor am I
in a position to say so ; neither am I in a position to
say they will join. I am, I think, exactly in the same
position as the hon. member for Victoria, Mr. Munro.
Let us pass the bill in the best form we can, whether
we gain our own ends or not, but let us have no more
threatening, because I do not like it, besides, this is
not the place for threatening.
Mr. PLAYFOED : I have been very much aston-
ished in listening to the views put forward by some
hon. members. We have been deliberately told that
unless we give equal powers to the senate we go for
unification, and that if we do give equal powers to
the senate we go for federation. That is a most
absurd statement. Hon. members well know that it
depends upon the power which you give to parlia-
ment, whether you take power from the senate
or not, and not as to the distribution of that power
between the two branches of the legislature. It is
not a question as to whether you distribute powers
this way or that as regards state rights; but it is a
question as to whether you take from the states cer-
tain powers and give them to the parliament. We
are now discussing, not the taking of powers from
the states, but as to how we intend to distribute the
legislative powers of the commonwealth between the
two houses—the senate on the one hand and the
house of representatives on the other; and the
question of unification or federation does not come
in. It will be just as much a unification, even if the
senate have very small powers compared with the
other house, if you take away the powers from the
states, and give them to the central parliament as a
whole; and it will be as much a federation if they
have large or small powers. The question of unifica-
tion has nothing to do with the point at present
under discussion. The hon. member, Mr. Thynne,
asked me one question which I will attempt to
answer. Responsible government, he asserted, could
adapt itself to any circumstances. I will ask the
hon. member does he know where responsible govern-
ment has ever adapted itself to the circumstances of
two coequal houses? Nowhere in the world. I sup-
pose the hon. member has read history sufficiently to
enable him to know that in England we never obtained
responsible government until the coequal power was
taken from the House of Lords. At one time, in
fact, that House had greater power than the Com-
mons ; but Ave never obtained responsible govern-
ment in the mother country until the power of the
House of Lords Avas taken aAvay and lodged in the
House of Commons. I hold to the opinion I have
previously expressed 011 this point, that I believe you
cannot carry on responsible government satisfactorily
Avith two absolutely coequal houses. That is an
opinion Avhich I haA'e expressed from the first. I
have also expressed myself to the effect that person-
ally I have not the slightest objection to ask the people
of this great continent to agree to a commonwealth
in which the two houses shall be coequal, and in
which the executive shall be elected by the tAvo
houses in the same Avay as is done in Switzerland. I
find, however, in speaking to hon. members on this
subject, that there are very feAV Avho agree Avith me.
Even a number of those who are in favour of coequal
powers being given to the senate will not go in for
doing away Avith responsible government. Therefore,
so far as this question is concerned, it seems hopeless
to argue upon it. I hold to the opinion that respon-
sible government cannot Avork satisfactorily with two
houses coequal in power. Another point, upon Avhich
I wish to say one or two words, has reference to the
statement Avhich has been made to the effect that
Avithout equal power the small states will be ridden
over rough-shod by the larger states ; that, as the last
speaker stated, the smaller states will be practically
at the mercy of the larger states. Will any intelli-
gent man take up this proposed constitution bill
and examine the proposals contained in clause 55,
and tell me that the smaller states Avill be at the
mercy of the larger states ? First, they have equal
representation; secondly, they have equal powers
011 all matters, excepting money bills, relating to the
ordinary annual expenditure 011 the ordinary service
of the year, and dealing with taxation. They have
the power of amendment in regard to all but two
classes of money bills —the power of absolute amend-
ment coequal with that of the other house. With
regard to those two particular classes of bills, they
have a right to suggest to the other house amend-
ments in any clause or parts of a clause. The Con-
stitutional Committee have adopted precisely the mode
adopted in the Colony of South Australia, where it has
been in force for between twenty or thirty years. We
have Avorked under that system for between twenty
or thirty years. The upper house have the right to
make suggestions, and those suggestions—taking the
case as showing lIOAV the system would Avork if it
Avere adopted for the commonwealth —have been as
respectfully treated and considered by the lower
house as any amendment Avhich has ever been made
in connection with any bill. They have been quietly
and intelligently debated in the lower house ; they
hav T e been agreed to either with or without amend-
ment, or disagreed to, as the case may be, and they
have been sent back to the legislative council pre-
cisely in the same Avay as is proposed here. Ever
since we made the compact in consequence of the
claim of the Legislative Council in South Australia
to coequal poAvers with the House of Assembly in
dealing with money bills, except as regards initiation
—ever since we entered into that compact, nearly
thirty years ago, we have never had the slightest
trouble with regard to the working of the compact.
It has Avorked in the most harmonious manner, and,
so far as the Legislative Council is concerned, I
have never heard a single member of that body—and
I have been in the Parliament since 1868 —utter a


wish that the compact should be broken in any way,
though in the Lower House a late treasurer brought
forward a motion only a year or so ago to the effect
that we should break the compact between the two
houses because it gave the Legislative Council too
much power. With the right on the part of the
senate, in the first instance, to veto any measure
brought before it; with equal powers in respect to
all proposed laws, except those imposing taxation,
and appropriating the necessary supplies for the year,
which the senate may affirm or reject; with a right
to insist that any bill dealing with new taxation shall
be so subdivided that only one subject at a time can
be dealt with —with the senate possessing all these
powers, and with the immense preponderance of votes
which the smaller colonies will have in the senate,
how can any man in his senses say that the smaller
colonies need have any fear whatever of being over-
ridden in the legislation of the country if this
proposal is adopted ? I fail to see any such danger.
I try to look at the matter with a dispassionate eye.
I try to look at it from the standpoint of a smaller
colony, being myself a representative of a small
colony. I think I can foresee as well as any member
here what the course of legislation is likely to be,
and I have come to the honest conviction that if these
clauses are carried the senate will have all the powers
they ought to have, and that to give them any more
power would be injurious to the interests of the
commomvealth. The people of the community as a
whole must rule. You cannot get away from that,
and if you do not provide that this shall be to some
degree, at all events, the effect of your legislation I
fail to see how it will be possible to induce the larger
colonies to come into the federation. I shall support
the clause as it stands in preference to the amend-
ment. I desire to say that Ido not agree with the
amendment of the hon. member, Mr. Wrixon. As
to the bugbear that has been raised, that the smaller
colonies are going to be overridden, and their in-
fluence destroyed by the larger colonies, if we do not
give the senate equal power with the house of repre-
sentatives, I contend that that is a mistake. It is a
myth ; it does not exist, and will not exist if the
constitution is adopted in the form now proposed.
Mr. KINGSTON : I shall be found recording my
vote against the amendment, and as the position
which I now intend to take, may at first sight appear
to be somewhat inconsistent with the sentiments I
have previously expressed, I should like to give my
reasons for the vote I intend to record. My reasons
are shortly these: that the senate, as it will be con-
stituted under the provisions of the bill which we
have before us, will be entirely different from the
senate as I hoped it would have been constituted
under the measure which recommended itself to the
adoption of the Convention. A good deal was made
during the course of the initiatory debate of the
resemblance which it was supposed might exist
between the senate and the upper branches of
legislature as we are generally accustomed to them;
but emphasis was laid, and it appears to me most
properly, on the probability that there would be
little or no resemblance between the two chambers,
but that the senate, as created by the constitution of
the commonwealth, would be simply a body elected
by the same electors voting in different constituencies.
Now, I would venture to ask if this is the position
under the bill ? I hold that it is not; that it is
altogether different. Instead of the senate represent-
ing the same body of electors as those who will
return members to the house of representatives, it
will represent a much more limited class. We have
provided that the senate shall be chosen by the two
houses of the various local parliaments. We have
distinctly prohibited the people of the various states
from the exercise of any power which they might
desire to possess as regards the direct choice of
their representatives in the senate. The sense of the
Convention was taken on a direct motion affecting
the question, and we now find it declared as the
deliberate will and purpose of the Convention that
the people as a whole shall be deprived of any direct
vote in the choice of senators, and that the power
of election shall be confided to the two branches of
the local legislature. What does that amount to ?
It amounts to this : That an equal voice will be
accorded in all cases which are most favourable to the
exercise of popular rights to a limited class, repre-
sentative not of the general body of the people, but
of persons possessing a property qualification. That,
I say, will be the case in the most favourably situated
colonies. In all such colonies there is a provision
requiring a property qualification in the electoral
franchise for the upper house ; but, further, there
are cases in which it can hardly be said that the
members of the upper house are in the slightest
degree brought in touch with the main body of the
electors bv any system of representation. We have
before us the case of the great colony in which we
are at present assembled. Here the popular voice is
in no sense or degree exercised in the election of
members of the upper chamber. A similar rule
obtains in Queensland and New Zealand, and also, I
understand, for a limited time in Australia.
Is it fair, I ask, under all these circumstances, when
the senate, as it appears to me, is simply created for
the protection of state rights and state interests, to
say that we will permanently —or at least until an
alteration is made in the constitution —deprive the
electors of the different states of the opportunity of
settling this matter for themselves as they think best ?
I would have been perfectly agreeable —and I
have hitherto argued in favour of giving the senate
large powers in the direction of the protection
and preservation of state rights and state inter-
ests —if the senate were constituted by the direct
voice of the people; but lam not prepared to advo-
cate any such course when I find that instead of a
senate of the character which I had hoped would be
constituted under the constitution that we propose
to adopt, we have altogether a different body —one
in which there is no guarantee that the voice of the
people will prevail —and that an equal vote in the
decision of the election of senators is confided to
sections of the community in some colonies, and in
other colonies to those who may simply happen to be
the nominees of the government that is in power.
A great deal was previously made of the improba-
bility of a deadlock, and, of course, if the electors
were the same, though divided into different con-
stituencies, as was well pointed out, there would not
be much probability of any such lamentable occur-
rence ; but we have had some experience of dead-
locks in other colonies, and, although we need not
fear them if the people to whom the senate were
responsible were the same people as those to whom
the house of representatives was responsible, yet
when we notice, and must notice, that they are not
the same, but altogether a different constituency,
and there is no power given to the local legislatures,
however much they desire to alter the provisions on
this score, then it seems to me that there is great
risk of a deadlock. I, for one, have no faith in a
senate that is constituted without direct election by
the people —over which the people have no control,
or over which the people have only the control, to
the most limited extent, which is provided here—and
I will never give a vote either in this Convention or
elsewhere for confiding larger powers 'to such a
senate than are proposed within the four corners
of the bill. Eather should I be found supporting
any amendment which might have the effect ot
confining the attention of the senate to matters with
which they are properly charged. I have always
understood that the object of calling the senate into
existence was the preservation of state rights and
state interests. I thoroughly sympathise with the


suggestion which during another period of this de-
bate was made, that within the four corners of
the act which we propose to pass we should for
the guidance of the senate lay down the principle
which we hope and expect will direct them in the
discharge of their senatorial duties. So far as I can
understand that principle, it is that the wall of the
people as expressed in the house of representatives
should prevail, and should not be interfered with by
the senate in the slightest degree, except in cases
where state rights and state interests are involved.
Holding these views, if an opportunity were given
me to vote on an amendment such as that which
■was indicated, by which the senate’s power of amend-
ment was to be confined to cases in which by their
own deliberate resolution they affirmed that it was
necessary for them for the protection of state rights
and state interests to amend any particular measure
which was sent up to them, I should be found voting
in favour of it. But the way in which we have got
it at present is that the senate —a body which
appears to me to be constituted in a highly objec-
tionable manner, out of touch with the people,
removed by the express provisions of this consti-
tution from the possibility of popular control —in a
great many cases are given unlimited pow'ers of
amendment—a powder of amendment which they
could exercise whether state rights or state interests
w r ere or were not involved. I think it is a bad thing
that they should have these powers, and, as regards
the matters which we are now discussing, having no
faith in a body so constituted, I shall do whatever I
can to prevent their having the larger powers which
it is sought to confer upon them, and I do hope that
I shall have an opportunity to vote for a limitation
of the authority w'hich even this clause proposes to
confer upon them.
Mr. SUTTOR: With regard to the senate, it is
my intention to vote for the wdiole bill, and nothing
but the bill. I desire to compliment the sub-com-
mittee who drafted the bill on the able manner in
which they dealt with this important question —on
the very able compromise wdiich they have brought
about. It appears to me that this compromise might
be described as w'hat is known in mechanics as the
result of a balance of forces. We began this debate
with extreme views on all sides. We had the hon.
and learned member, Mr. Deakin, on the one side,
and the hon. and learned member, Mr. Barton, on
the other, whom I described, in the address which I
had the honor to deliver to the -Convention on the
resolutions, as being the two poles of the discussion.
I am convinced that the more we discuss the question
the more we shall be satisfied that the sub-committee,
w'hich perhaps consisted of the most able members
of the Convention, have, in their deliberations, made
a happy compromise, which all the colonies should
accept. I confess that I cannot but express my sur-
prise at what was said by the hon. member for
Western Australia, Mr. J. Uorrest. He is one of
the pets of this Convention. His colony has four
representatives to commence with, when, so far as
population is concerned, it is only entitled to one
member and a half.
Mr, Hackett : How does the hon. member make
that out ?
Mr. SUTTOR : There is to be a member for every
30,000,000 people; but Western Australia will start
with four members, although it has a population of
only 40,000.
Mr. Hackett : The hon. member should wait for
the census!
Mr. SUTTOR: The hon. member will not say
tliat the population is 60,000, and if it w 7 ere 60,000,
Western Australia w r ould be entitled to only two
members, but it is to get double the number that it
is entitled to. Western Australia will also have the
same representation in the senate —eight members—-
as is given to the population of the larger colonies.
Seeing the eminent gentlemen who were on the sub-
committee, I am willing to put myself in their hands
and to vote for the bill as brought down by them.
Mr. LOTON : The question before the Convention
at the present time with regard to the powers that
the senate shall have in the federal parliament, I
think is worthy of a little more consideration. The
hon. delegate from South Australia, Mr. Kingston,
put before us the fact that we have given the senate
equal powers with the house of representatives on a
very great number of subjects—on all subjects, in
fact, as was pointed, out by the Premier of South
Australia, with the exception of appropriation and
taxation. I think that the hon. member, Mr. Kingston,
also pointed out that the senate, as constituted,
would not be worthy of the same amount of confi-
dence, because of the manner of its election, as it
might otherwise have been. At the same time, if he
can afford to give the senate the same power as is as-
signed under about thirty clauses in this bill, how is
it that the hon. member cannot go a little farther,
and give them the same power under the other two
clauses? Now, in considering the question of the
power of the senate and of the house of representa-
tives, it is very important to my mind to see exactly
what powers it is proposed to confer on the federal
parliament. "What are the powders ? The powers are
contained in thirty-one clauses ; but we have been
told on several occasions that finance means govern-
ment, and government is finance. Well, the very
subject on which it is intended to limit the power of the
senate is the very question of finance. One of the
first subjects, I suppose, to engage the attention of the
federal parliament w r ould be the question of the tariff.
What w r ould be the relative proportions and powers
of the different states when the question was con-
sidered ? Take the four smallest populated colonies
at the present time. Their representation in the
house of representatives would not equal the repre-
sentation of either Victoria or New South Wales at
the present time. I leave out New Zealand, because
I suppose they are too large, at the present time to
think of joining the confederation. But, taking the
four smallest colonies, their pow r er in the house of
representatives w r ould not equal the power of Vic-
toria or New South Wales. And the same in regard
to the amount which they would be taxed. The
taxpayers will have to pay equally; the tariff is to be
uniform.
Mr. Munro : The larger colonies will pay the
larger amount!
Mr. LOTON: Not exactly. They are to have a
uniform tariff, and Victoria, supposing New South
Wales stands out, would be able to dominate the
four smallest populated colonies, by imposing a tariff
against the outside world. We are to have, I sup-
pose, an extraordinary state of things when we enter
the federation between Victoria and New South
Wales. Victoria is quoted as a highly protectionist
colony,
Mr. Mcjkro : You could throw out the bill, could
you not ?
Mr. LOTON: New South Wales, on the other
hand, boasts of being a free-trade colony.
Mr. Dibbs: What’s that? There is no boasting
about it!
Mr. LOTON: I have noticed for some time past,
in looking down the customs tariff, that New South
Wales imposes against an outside colony a duty of
a penny in the pound on butter. That is not free-
trade, at all events, for the working-men of New
South Wales.
Mr. Dibbs : Our free-trade is a sham !
Colonel Smith : A good deal of it is!
Mr. LOTON: However, I suppose we shall have
an extraordinary state of things between Victoria and
New South Wales; and if they join the federation,
as no doubt they will, they can easily dominate the
tariff of the commonwealth.


Mr. Munro : But the others can throw it out!
Mr. LOTON ; What will be the important ques-
tion that will arise in the first instance ? It will be
the question of imposing a protective tariff against
the outside world, and Victoria, there is no doubt in
the world, will say, “We want, we must have, and
we shall have, if it is possible, a high protective tariff
against the outside world ” ; and New South Wales
possibly will follow her because she can afford to do
so ; but at the present time the other states are not,
I say, in a position, and will not bo in a position for
a long time to go in for a policy of that kind. I
shall not follow that argument further than to state
it; but that is my opinion. Now, take the other side
of the question. What can these four outside
colonies with the smallest populations do, even if you
give them co-ordinate powers on these particular
questions, against New South Wales and Victoria
combined ?
Mr. Bird : Veto them !
Mr. LOTON: Very little; they have not the
power.
Sir John Brat : They can reject!
Colonel Smith: The domination is all the other
way!
Mr. LOTON: They can reject the whole of a bill,
whatever power you give them, but not a portion.
What would the voice of the thirty-five members for
these outside colonies be in a senate of 130 members ?
What would be the use of their voice in the senate
unless you give them some power ? I maintain that
unless you give equal power to the members of the
senate on the questions of appropriation and taxation
you may as well do away with the second house alto-
gether. If they are simply to register the edicts of
the house of representatives, we may as well do away
with the senate.
Sir PATEICK JENNINGS: I feel bound to
make an explanation. In discussing the constitution
of the senate in the debate on the main question, I
expressed the opinion that we ought to have a strong
and powerful senate. I believe we ought to have a
variety of distinct opinions as to what the measure
of strength should be of that senate. I may plainly
say that after reflection, and looking over the mode
by which the committee to whom the task was given
of endeavouring to reconcile these conflicting opinions,
I am impressed with the conviction that they have
decided in a wise and moderate manner. I shall not
refer to any ebullition of feeling on the part of that
remarkably stalwart stripling of a new colony in the
shape of Western Australia, who comes forward and
asserts itself with the most manly vigour. I feel
that the exuberant - patriotism of those who have come
so far ought to be admired if we cannot all agree
with them. But I think they have really inverted
the proposition. I think this is not a case of the
larger states domineering over and dominating the
smaller states. I am very much inclined to think
that the smaller states are in the position of lecturing
and hectoring and domineering over the larger states.
We know that the representation in the senate is
perfectly equal in each case ; and we know, more-
over, that this idea that New South Wales and
Victoria will be always united to oppress the other
colonies, is about the most unlikely thing in the
world. I think they are very likely to split; and if
they disagree, then our friends from South Australia
can form a corner on the one side, and our friends
from Queensland can form a corner on the other,
and they make common cause with whichever
state they think is right. But I do not believe
there will be a tendency to split up between colonies
having all the same opinions. There will be parties
in the senate, as there will be parties in the house of
representatives, and that party feeling will be the
solvent of the questions before them, and will prevent
one mass vote being given by the senators. AVe
cannot follow the model of the United States Consti-
tution, because our constitution is totally different.
AVe cannot, as a senate, perform executive functions
when we have responsible government and a ministry
responsible to the house of representatives. There-
fore, I think any allusion to the constitution of the
United States Senate would be altogether in vain ;
and believing, as I do, that a happy mean has been
arrived at, I shall not be inclined to support any
amendment of this clause.
Mr. HACKETT : I hope the Convention will allow
me a few words in order to explain my position, as I
find myself, I regret to say, differing from a majority
of my hon. colleagues from the colony we represent.
In fact, I find myself in the smallest minority
possible —a minority, I think, of less than the number
of representatives the hon. member, Mr. Suttor,
would allow us, according to our population, in the
senate. But perhaps hon. members will allow me,
in the first instance, to say a word as to some indig-
nant remonstrances that fell from the hon. member,
Mr. Deakin, in debating this clause on our last day
of meeting. I might explain that the vote I gave on
that occasion was given in consequence of a com-
parison of language, and solely for that reason —not
with any idea of altering the powers of the two
bodies, but solely from a comparison of the language
of clause 55 with that of clause 51. I was under the
impression that the words in the Ist sub-section of
clause 55 and the words in clause 51 were meant to
cover the same subject, and from long experience we all
know how highly disadvantageous it is, and howgreatly
it conduces to friction and trouble if the selfsame sub-
ject be referred to and defined in different language. If
it were intended to attach to the words “ appro-
priating any part of the public revenue,” a meaning
different from that attached to the words “ appropri-
ating the necessary supplies for the ordinary annual
service of the government,” it is not explained. I
was left under the impression that they were meant
to cover the same ground, and on that conclusion I
voted to bring them into harmony and consistency.
I must say that I remain, to a great extent, uncon-
vinced by the many arguments used by advocates of
what may be called the popular view—that is to say,
I do not share the apprehensions of many hon.
gentlemen that if you endow these two bodies with
coequal powers, there is any fear of an absolute
stoppage of government, as is, I suppose, meant by
the use of the word “ deadlock.” There is almost
certain to be a little friction at the commencement;
but after a while each body will find that it is of no
use attempting to coerce a body which stands on as
strong ground as itself, and ultimately the order of
the day will be concession and compromise. Still
less am I moved by reference to the power of the
people. The power of the people, it is said, will be
lodged in the house of representatives. But go round
the question as you may, put it into any shape or form
you like, it remains the same thing—for many years
to come the house of representatives will be the
house of two states, while the senate will be the
house of all the states. New South AUales and A7ic-
toria, as is well known, will outvote the other states
in the house of representatives by at least three, and
perhaps four, to one. Therefore, I should not
accept this compromise if I believed the clause w r ould
take away any of the essential powers of the senate
in asserting the manifest rights of the smaller states.
But does it mean such an inroad upon their pow r ers
and privileges ?Is it w r orth our wiiile to accept an
amendment rejecting this compromise—a course
which, to put it in plain words, will have the effect
of wrecking the whole scheme of federation F
Mr. J. Eorrest : AVho says so ?
Mr. HACKETT: AVe are assured by gentlemen
who speak in the name of a majority of the people of
Australia that that will be so.
Sir John Downer: AVe had better go without
federation than have it on their principle !


Mr. HACKETT: For my part, I think it would
be less cumbrous and more satisfactory if the right of
amendment were given in the same form as that in
which it is given in the South Australian Constitu-
tion, and in which it is given and exercised in Tas-
mania. This compromise goes as nearly as possible
towards giving the senate the real power as anything
that can possibly be produced in default of the
American system.
Sir JOHN DOWNER: Does it give them the real
power ?
Mr. HACKETT: Above all, I protest against it
being said that we are accepting a degrading compro-
mise—that this compromise, if acted upon, would put
the senate in a degraded and undignified position.
How can that be so ? What difference is there be-
tween the course proposed and things as they now
stand in some of the colonies P In those colonies
in which the upper house possesses the right of
amendment if it desires to make an amendment it
sends down the amendment in the bill. Under this
compromise it would send down the amendment with
the bill. If this Convention is to break up upon
such a ground as that, upon such mere straw-
splitting as the question whether bills shall be sent
down with amendments in them or tacked on to them,
the sooner we give up all ideas not only of federation,
but of political self-government, the better, because
we are unfitted for either. Sir, something of this
kind has been and is in operation in at least two
colonies in the group. The hon. member, Mr.
McMillan, seemed to think that the arrangement by
which an amendment in a money bill could be com-
municated by message to the lower house, though
nominally in force in South Australia, was not opera-
tive. All I can say is, that in the first assembling of
our two houses in Western Australia, when this very
question came up, we carefully studied matters in
South Australia, and we were convinced, from the
frequent, the effective, and the conciliatory application
of the system, that it was a course of procedure that
deserved consideration. The result was that in the
very first question that arose between our two houses
we adopted the South Australian mode of procedure,
and in consequence an amendment of a highly
desirable character was made in legislation relating
to finance. Therefore, I look upon the practice as
the established practice of Western Australia as well
as of South Australia. This power, so far from being
degrading, is really a power which is lodged in another
branch of the parliament. I refer to the governor
representing the Queen. Under most of our con-
stitutions, he can communicate —I do not say as to
money bills, but as to other legislation—by message
any amendment he thinks it desirable to make in a
bill after it has passed both houses. And the same
procedure would be adopted as to dealings between
the senate and the house of representatives in regard
to financial legislation. lam prepared to vote for
this compromise, and mainly on these two grounds.
We have already decided that bills dealing with money
questions —bills imposing a tax or appropriating any
part of the revenue —shall originate in the house of
representatives. That clause was carried unanimously.
What is now proposed ? Not only that bills dealing
with money questions shall originate in the house of
representatives, but that all amendments dealing with
money bills shall also originate in that house. I say
that the advocates of this compromise are entitled to
press that parity of reasoning to its utmost and most
stringent logical consequences. In fact, the relation-
ship that will exist between the senate and the
house of representatives as to amendments will be
almost the same as that which exists between the
governor and the house of representatives as to
money bills—that is to say, the governor may and
does suggest a money bill for the consideration of
the house of representatives. The senate is to do
almost precisely the same thing, It is to send amend-
ments in money bills to tbe house of representatives
for its consideration. Therefore, if we look to mere
logical consistency, the proposal to allow the amend-
ment of money bills to originate in the lower house
as well as the bills themselves, recommends itself to
the most favourable consideration of the Committee.
Thesecondreason w r hy I shall vote for this compromise
is that it leaves the door open for evolution. It is
quite possible that in years to come the senate may
prove itself to be the more trusted, the more able,
and the more patriotic body. If so, it will be the
most popular body, and no number of constitutional
shackles which you can devise will take away from
it its power, or reduce it one scintilla. On the
contrary, however you may bind and fetter it, it will
discover means to make its wishes know r n and to
enforce them ; and the people also will find ways to
support them. This compromise rather indicates than
determines the balance of political forces in the con-
stitution. It leaves their ultimate adjustment and
readjustment to time. Time, and time alone, can show
us where the political equilibrium will lie ; and it is no
small credit to the framers of this compromise that
they have borne that so clearly in mind and have
allowed -within certain limits the senate to exert the
power wduch its own conduct will make apparent and
effective. For this reason I shall have great pleasure
in supporting the clause as it stands.
Mr. BAKER: At the request of the hon. member,
Mr. McMillan, I ask leave to withdraw my amend-
ment in order to propose another. If my amendment,
as I first proposed it, is negatived, the amendment
which the hon. member, Mr. McMillan, wishes- to
move will not be admissible. I would like to say a
few words in reply to what has been said on this
question. We have heard a great many arguments
which were used before on this subject; but we have
had the matter put in a somewhat new form by two
of my colleagues from South Australia. The hon.
members, Mr. Playfoi’d and Mr. Kingston, both put
it that they are prepared to make sacrifices.
Mr. Platfoed : I never used the word!
Mr. Kingston : I did not!
Mr. BAKER: The hon. member, Mr. Playford,
did not use that word, but he said he was prepared
to make a compromise; he did not advocate that
which he himself thought absolutely the best, but he
was prepared to give way in order to bring the matter
to a conclusion.
Mr. Kingston : I did not say anything of the sort!
Mr. Platfoed : Nor did I!
Mr. BAKER : I understood the hon. member, Mr.
Playford, to put it that responsible government must
exist; and, in order that this fetish of responsible
government should exist and be carried out, he was
prepared to sacrifice the interests of South Australia.
Mr. Platfoed; No!
Mr, BAKER : I have heard of people who were
prepared to sacrifice themselves on the altar of their
country ; but I never before heard people talking of
sacrificing their country on the altar of responsible
government.
Mr. Platfoed : That is unfair !
Mr. BAKER : I do not think it is at all unfair.
The hon. gentleman has a right to his own opinion.
Mr. Platfoed : The hon, member has no right to
put words in my mouth which I never used !
Mr. BAKER: The hon. member did not use
those very words; but that was, as I understood
him, the effect of his arguments. The hon. member,
Mr. Playford, has told us that this system of sugges-
tion wdiich is proposed in this bill has been in force
in South Australia for twenty years, and it has
always worked well; that all the suggestions made
by the Legislative Council have been respectfully
treated. As a matter of fact, the Legislative
Council never does make any suggestions at all with
respect to tariff or appropriation bills. They never


think of making a suggestion with regard to an
appropriation bill. They never make any suggestion
in the case of a tariff bill.
Mr. Platford : Yes; they have done so!
Mr. Kingston: And also in the case of loan bills !
Mr. BAKER : I do not remember any suggestion
having been made. If the hon. member says that
ignoring suggestions is treating them respectfully,
he is quite right. That is the usual treatment they
meet with.
Mr. Platford : No !
Mr. BAKER: When a bill comes to us which is
technically a money bill, but which is really a bill
dealing with a question of general policy; and con-
taining a few money clauses in it, when w r e make
suggestions that do not deal with the money clauses,
they are generally respectfully treated; but if we
venture to make suggestions on money matters, they
are ignored.
Mr. Platford : Nothing of the sort!
Mr. BAKER : I assert that they are. I and those
who think with me are afraid that the same practice
will be carried into effect with reference to any
suggestions made by the senate if the clause is
passed as it now stands.
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
Amendment (by Mr. Baker) proposed ;
That the word " except,” line 3, he omitted.
Sir JOHN BRAT: Ido not think I should have
troubled the Convention with any remarks on this sub-
ject, but for the fact that an hon. member from South
Australia, Mr. Baker, has displayed such lamentable
ignorance of what is going on in the Parliament of
that colony. The hon. member, to my knowledge, has
been a member of the Legislative Council for a great
number of years, yet he tells us to-day, us who know
more about it than he does himself, that this power
of suggestion, exercised by the Legislative Council
of South Australia, is in fact a myth,—that when
suggestions are made, they are, generally speaking,
ignored.
Mr. Baker : I did not say so.
Sir JOHN BRAT: The hon. member said that
suggestions were made, and, generally speaking,
were not respectfully considered.
Mr. Baker : I did not!
Sir JOHN BRAY: And the hon. member took
the hon. member, Mr. Playford, to task for having
said that the suggestions of the Council were always
respectfully considered. He cannot deny that.
Mr. Baker : I do not deny that!
Sir JOHN BRAT: I say it is a mistake. lam
sorry that the hon. member said that. If we are
going to question what each member likes to think,
and to put our own interpretation on any explanation
that he chooses to give, that is not the way to for-
ward the business of this Convention. Our business
is to determine what we shall do to meet an
undoubtedly very difficult question. I will point out
to hon. members as a recent instance of what took
place in South Australia, that, in 1887, a tariff bill
■was passed by the Legislative Assembly. I have here
a copy of the proceedings of the Parliament of South
Australia. The Legislative Council made certain
suggestions with respect to that tariff bill
Mr. Platford : Twenty-five altogether !
Sir JOHN BRAY: I will not trouble the House
by reading them all; but they suggested that men’s
boots and shoes, No, G and upwards, should be
charged 335. per dozen pairs, glass bottles at certain
rates, bags, sacks, and so on; that between twenty and
thirty different items should be included in the tariff.
A message was sent to the Assembly, and a day or
two afterwards it was resolved that the suggestions of
the Legislative Council should be accepted.
Mr, Platford : Every one of them !
Sir JOHN BRAY: That is as clear proof as
possible that this practice of the Legislative Council
making suggestions has worked well in South Aus-
tralia, and the Legislative Council have not hesitated
to exercise their power to make suggestions.
Mr. Platford: And they were always respectfully
considered!
Sir JOHN BRAY : Nor has the Assembly, on the
other hand, hesitated to consider their suggestions
fairly and respectfully, and, where possible, to agree
to them. I must say, as one who tries to take a fair
and impartial view of this question, that I believe
both sides are making too much of this particular
matter. I do not think this is the crucial question
in the bill. I have sufficient confidence, not only in
the parliaments of the different colonies, but also in
the people of Australia generally, to believe that they
have no desire to do a wrong. Even if it were
possible, and I do not think it possible, that tbe
governments of New South Wales and Victoria
were both anxious to do wrong to the people of the
other colonies, I do not believe that the people of
Victoria and New South Wales would follow their
governments in attempting such a course. I say,
speaking as an Australian, that I believe the Aus-
tralians desire federation. I believe they have confi-
dence in each other, and I believe that the 1,000,000
of people —speaking in round numbers —in the other
colonies have perfect confidence in the 2,000,000
people in New South Wales and Victoria having the
same objects, the same interests, and the same desire
to maintain the prosperity and advancement of the
whole of the colonies. I say, on the other hand, that
I shall be quite satisfied to give the senate full power
with respect to everything except the ordinary appro-
priation bills. I think it would be a lamentable
thing to give the senate power to interfere with the
ordinary annual supplies of the government. It
would possibly clog the whole of the work of the
government, and the senate w r ould not be directly
responsible to the people. I do not want to go into
the question of what is federation, or unification, or
anything else; but I take it that it is the desire of
every Australian who wishes to see free government
in Australia to have the government of the people
by the people, and not by the states; and whether I
represent a small state or a large state I will be no
party to giving any authority or any government for
the time being the right of nominating persons who
shall exercise a power superior to that exercised by
the people themselves. The question now before us
as to the mode of adjusting the differences between
the two houses will settle itself in the course of time
as the two houses proceed with their work, and I, for
one, would deprecate the tying down too tightly in a
bill, and saying too definitely what the powers of
each house are to be. I am not going to pro-
nounce a definite decision on the matter, however,
until I hear clearly what the amendment of the hon.
member, Mr. McMillan, really is; but whatever
form the government may take, I, as one of those
elected by the people, claim that the people of Aus-
tralia must in the end make their will prevail. It is
impossible for any of us, whatever the colony from
which we came, to suppose that the 2,000,000 people
in New South Wales and Victoria would consent to
be dictated to by the senate as to the amount of
taxation that they are to endure, or as to anything
more than the disposal of that taxation for the pur-
poses of the federal government. It appears to me
that the really important part of the bill, that relat-
ing to finance, has to be decided later. I do not
propose to go into this matter now, although to a
certain extent it is connected with this clause,
because it really provides how taxation measures are
to be dealt with; but I ask hon. members on either
side not to attach too much importance to this ques-
tion, I say that anybody who talks about one colony
making a sacrifice for the sake of another does not
understand it, and will have to begin at the beginning
before he can know anything about it. There is no


sacrifice whatever. The senate is composed of an
equal number of representatives from each colony,
and the people have the right to elect a certain num-
ber of members to the house of representatives, and
I have the fullest confidence that those who are
elected to the house of representatives will deal
justly with the whole of the people of Australia. I
think we ought to ridicule the idea that the people
of New South Wales and Victoria would be
so utterly wrongheaded as to combine together
merely for the purpose of doing an injustice to
the other colonies. I do not believe that it is
possible that the governments of these colonies
could combine for this purpose, and I ridicule the
notion that they could get any considerable portion
of the people to follow them if they adopted such a
course. I ask hon. members to consider the question
reasonably. I should like representatives from the
smaller colonies to consider Avhether the people of
Australia are to have a full voice in the disposal of
taxation. No form of government should deprive
them of the full opportunity of exercising proper
influence in the raising and disposal of taxation.
It appears to me that the most important provi-
sions in the bill are those relating to the disposal
of the revenues of the federal executive council, and
I trust that we shall make up our minds not to leave
them as they are now. The surplus revenue will
probably be returned to the people ; but I quite
agree with the hon. member, Mr. Thynue, that the
uncertainty as to the amount to be returned, or
as to the time at which it will be returned, must
embarrass the treasurer and the government of each
particular colony, if there is any doubt whatever
about it. If we make up our minds to place in the
hands of the federal government a considerable
revenue, we should also make up our minds that they
shall have full use for that revenue. I shall listen
with care to the amendment of the hon. member,
Mr. McMillan, but in the meantime I ask hon. mem-
bers not to insist on anything so unreasonable as
that the senate which represents the states shall
have the power of over-riding the representatives of
the people in the taxation of the people, and the mode
of disposing that taxation when raised.
Mr. BAKEE : I am glad that the hon. member,
Sir John Bray, has called the attention of the Com-
mittee to the particular suggestions made by the
South Australian Legislative Council to the House
of Eepresentatives in 1887, because they entirely
prove the statement which I advanced, that sugges-
tions when made on matters of detail, and unsub-
stantial, were considered and agreed to ; but that
they would not be considered at all if they materially
affected the provisions of a money bill.
Sir John Bray : Show it by the records !
Mr. BAKEE : I shall show it by the record of a
motion moved by the hon. member, Sir John Bray,
in the very case which he brought before the Com-
mittee this afternoon. First of all, the ruling of the
Speaker w r as called as to Avhether it was in the power
of the Legislative Council to make the small sugges-
tion Avhich they had made. The Speaker ruled that
it Avas in their poAver, and the hon. member, Sir John
Bray, then moA'ed :
That the ruling of the Deputy-Speaker be printed and
taken into consideration on some future day, and that in the
meantime the suggestions of the Legislati\ r e Council re the
Tariff Revision Bill, not being such as materially affect the
policy of the bill
That is to say, being trivial amendments.
be considered in Committee.
Does not that prove that in substance I Avas right,
although I admit that my memory was at fault, and
I apologise, for saying that the Legislative Council
never made any suggestions in a tariff bill ?
Sir Henry Paekes : It does not much matter
Avhether they did or not!
Mr. BAKEE: No. However, these suggestions
were agreed to because they did not affect the policy
of the bill.
Mr. Playeord : The policy of the bill was pro-
tection —they would have thrown the measure out if
they did not believe in its policy.
Mr. BAKEE ; The House of Assembly said it
does not matter at all in these small questions,
inasmuch as they do not materially affect the policy
of the bill.
Mr. McMILLAN; I think at this stage I had
better let the Committee know the character of my
amendment.
The Chairman ; This amendment must bo dealt
with fifst.
Sir John Bray : The hon. member. Mr. Baker,
has withdrawn his amendment, and only proposes to
strike out the word “except.” We want to know
how that would fit in with the amendment of the hon.
member, Mr. McMillan ?
Mr. McMILLAN : I shall not refer to my amend-
ment if it is not in order. I simply wish to say that
when the amendment of the hon. member, Mr.
Baker, is disposed of —I hope in the negative —I
shall propose my amendment,
Mr. Munko : The hon. member had better go on
with it at the right time !
Mr. McMILLAN: I understand that although
we are working under the rules of the House of
Commons, some amount of latitude is allowed us.
Mr. Munko : We shall not be allowed to speak on
the hon. member’s amendment now !
The Chairman : I would point out to the Com-
mittee that if I allow the hon, member, Mr.
McMillan, to do what he proposes, I shall have to
allow every hon. member a similar privilege, and 1
think that would lead to a great deal of irregularity,
which is undesirable.
Mr, McMILLAN: I understand that the hon.
member desires to omit the word “except,” in order
that a sweeping amendment may be brought forward,
giving the upper house the right to interfere with the
ordinary appropriation bill. From that I absolutely
dissent. As I said before, there is a very great
difference between the tvvo cases. In an appropria-
tion bill we simply appropriate money on a policy
which has been previously agreed to ; and it is with
regard to the appropriation, and not with regard to
the details of the bill, that I desire to give the privi-
lege to the upper house of dealing with it; conse-
quently, I wish to say that, notwithstanding the
amendment which I intend to move, I am utterly
opposed to the upper house amending an appropri-
ation bill.
Sir JOHN DOWNEE : If the views of the hon.
member, Sir John Bray, were adopted and met with
general acceptance, 1 think it would be absolutely
unnecessary for us to bother about a senate at all.
I understood the hon. gentleman to say, with great
emphasis — certainly he Avas speaking in a manner in
which he did not speak previously —that, so far as
federation was concerned, the voice of the people of
Australia—that is, of the individual units —must be
predominant; and for that reason, and, as I under-
stood the hon. gentleman to say, for that reason
alone it would be impossible to think of giving the
senate powers co-ordinate and coequal with those of
the house which directly represented the people. I
can only say that if those are the views of the hon.
gentleman, let hiip carry them out to their legitimate
issue, and the colonies will cease to exist as entities;
the unification of the empire, so far as it relates to the
colonies, will be complete, and our individuality as
colonies will be absolutely destroyed. It is quite im-
possible to talk of the voice of the people being ab-
solutely predominant, and in the same breath to
state that there shall be a senate which is to have
authority which may not necessarily work in the
same direction as the general voice of the people. I


agree with the lion, gentleman that the voice of the
people must prevail, but with those safeguards iu
respect of each colony which are absolutely neces-
sary to preserve them in their present independence ;
and it is from that point of view that, throughout, I
have maintained that, to make this exception in
respect of money bills, or in respect of tax-
ation bills, was, at the very start, to indicate
the inferiority of the senate, whilst all the pro-
visions of the bill go to show what a superior
body we intend to create. The hon. gentleman says
no constitution could possibly exist with coequal
authority in the senate and the house of representa-
tives ; and at the very same time he has before him the
only enduring democracy that the world has ever
known, in which for upwards of 100 years that
authority has existed, at least co-ordinate, or, where
they were not co-ordinate
Mr. Gillies : Not nearly co-ordinate !
Sir Hemet Pabkes : Where is that ?
Sir JOHN DOWNER : America.
Mr. Playeoed : There is no responsible government
there!
Sir JOHN DOWNER: I will say a word about
responsible government in a minute; but I take it,
the government is for the people, and not the people
for the government. So far as America is concerned,
the power of the senate is not merely co-ordinate
with that of the house of representatives, but in some
particulars it is absolutely supreme ; and yet no one
will admit that the senate has lost repute or has been
lessened in the opinion of the people. On the con-
trary, we know perfectly well that the very humblest
of the people look with veneration to the senate,
whilst they are extremely critical about the body
which, if this argument were followed out, would
more completely represent their own voice. I come
now to the remark of the hon. member, Mr. Play-
ford, that they have no responsible government there.
Colonel Smith: They have a revolution there every
four years !
Sir JOHN DOWNER : That is no argument either
way. If their government is a perfect government
without a responsible ministry, so much the worse
for the responsible ministry argument, because it
shows that a responsible government may well exist
without a responsible ministry. To follow the argu-
ment of the hon. member, Mr. Playford, to its legiti-
mate end, there should be no second house at all.
The argument of the hon. gentleman is, “ You cannot
have a responsible ministry if you have two houses
with equal authority.” I contend that the argument
of the hon. gentleman is no argument at all, because
the question is not whether we are to have a re-
sponsible ministry, but whether or not we are to
form a government which shall preserve the entities
of the states, and yet, at the same time, bring about
federation on proper terms in respect of matters which
the states choose to hand over to them. Supposing
responsible government will not coexist with this it is
a matter which I in no way care about. What I am
certain of is that if this be a good thing the govern-
ment will be equally good, and will adjust itself to the
exigencies of its circumstances. But, as a matter of
fact, in some countries of Europe two co-ordinate
chambers exist, and yet responsible government
exists. The government always must be responsible ;
the only question is as to whom the government is
responsible. The government, says the hon. member,
Sir John Bray, must be responsible to the people.
Whom does he mean by the people ? He means
the people represented in the popular house.
Sir John Beat : Not necessarily!
Sir JOHN DOWNER: He means the people in
the popular house, either as it exists at the time
when some question arises, or as it exists after a
general election. The hon. gentleman means that; and
what he is endeavouring to do in connection with
this attempt which we are making, not at all to give
up our own local government, not at all to sacrifice
the liberties of our colonies which have worked so
excellently for all of us—at the very time that he
asserts that there will be no federation unless we
very carefully safeguard the liberties which we as
colonies individually possess, he, in almost every
matter of vital moment, proposes to hand over each
colony to a general body in which, so far as the smaller
colonies are concerned, they will have no practical
representation at all; and whilst he wants to preserve
the figment of a body which will seem to treat the
states as states, and give them equal representation
he wants to absolutely take away the substance which
we are seeking for, and to divest the senate of all
substantial authority. I say now, as I said at an
early stage of our debates, that if one house can
make and unmake governments alone, that house
will, as a necessary corollary, absolutely rule the
country. That body which governs the executive
must necessarily govern that which the executive
have to execute.
Mr. Gillies : This amendment does not touch
that question !
Sir JOHN DOWNER : This amendment deals
with the whole question, or is intended to do so. Of
course, it all depends whether these money bills are
of any importance at all. If the money bills have
the importance in legislation which the hon. member,
Mr. Gillies, attributes to them ; if legislation is
finance and finance is legislation, which I do not be-
lieve ; if this matter is of such super-eminent im-
portance, that it will be absolutely impossible to
legislate without taking very great care about it;
if these views are true, then I say it is absolutely
absurd that we can preserve the rights of every
colony at the same time that we hand over to the
general population of Australia the whole govern-
ment. If on the other hand, it means very little, if
other questions in which their rights are preserved
are of so much more importance, why make so much
fuss about the matter ? I care not which way you
take it. If money is everything, and everything is
money, then the senate ought to have as great a voice
as any other body. If it is a matter of secondary
importance, then why do the larger colonies make so
much trouble about it ?
Colonel Smith : It is not the larger but the smaller
colonies that make all the trouble!
Sir JOHN DOWNER: Of course, they are mak-
ing all the trouble. They are taking the trouble
which the humblest of us would take to preserve that
which is his own, and to resist the aggression of an
invader.
Mr. Muneo : You are the invaders. You want to
take away our privileges !
Sir JOHN DOWNER: Wo wish to take away
no privileges whatever. On the contrary, we say we
are going into rather a speculative venture
Mr. Muneo : And you want to get the plunder
from us!
Sir JOHN DOWNER: It is unworthy of the
hon. gentleman to say that. We are all anxious to
enter upon a new venture. The only question is as
to the terms on which we should initiate the agree-
ment, and with regard to that we have two instances
which have not worked well and only one instance
which has worked well, and all the arguments about
the government of the majority by the minority, and
about the larger states being made subordinate to the
smaller, and the more exaggerated language which
demeans itself to such a word as “plunder”—all these
arguments, I say, are dragged in when the light of
experience shows that no such result follows. I agree
with Sir John Bray that in the end the people must
rule.
Mr. Gillies : Who are the people P
Sir JOHN DOWNER: Why, the senate and
the house of representatives. The hon. member,
Mr. Kingston, holds the view that had the senate


been elected in the way he desired, it shoidd have
co-equal authority with the other branch of the legis-
lature ; but because the majority here have come to
the conclusion that it will be better to have some
different mode of election by the people in the first
instance from the ordinary mode of election, my hon.
friend says that he would rather see the powers of
the senate curtailed than extended, and that no great
authority should be given to persons so elected. In
putting forward that argument, the hon. gentleman
has given us proof of the strength of his own views,
which, when worked out, come to this: that rather
than take care that his colony and other colonies
should have an adequate representation in the senate
and an adequate voice in national concerns, unless
the senate is constituted in the precise method of
which he approves he would rather sacrifice the liberty
of his colony than forego his own individual views.
AYhether the senate is elected by the local legisla-
tures or by the people, whom do the members from a
particular state in that body represent ?
Mr. Kingston : It depends upon how they are
elected!
Sir JOHN DOWNER: They represent their own
colony, and they are a power in their own colony.
Mr. Deakin : They represent classes —that is all!
Mr. Kingston : The class that return them !
Sir JOHN DOAYNER: They represent all classes,
whereas the hon. member, Mr. Kingston, only wants
one class represented. Every portion of the com-
munity is thoroughly represented.
Colonel Smith : They only represent the money
bags !
Sir JOHN DOWNER: Even as far as the elec-
tion of the senate is concerned the local legislative
assembly would have much larger pow r er than the
legislative council, AYho can question that ? And
how can anybody say that a body so elected will
represent the classes, and not the community gener-
ally
Mr. Kingston : AYhat was our experience in
South Australia last year in regard to the Eederal
Council Bill ?
Sir JOHN DOAYNER; I am not talking about
the Eederal Council, which I always held in high
estimation.
Mr. Kingston : Did not the Legislative Council
wreck that last year ?
Sir JOHN DOAYNER; As a matter of fact the
Legislative Council never cared very much for the
Eederal Council at any time.
Mr. Kingston : They wrecked it last year on class
representation !
Mr. Playford : They wanted the propertied
classes to have as much voice as the masses of the
people !
Sir JOHN DOAYNER : If that matter wants ad-
justment, let it be adjusted; but do not let a man
who comes from any particular colony say that
because the election of the senators is not in the
precise mode that he would like, he will sacrifice the
rights of his colony in regard to representation
rather than not carry out his own views.
Mr. Kingston : I did not say anything of the
sort!
Sir JOHN DOWNER: I have taken the same
position in this matter ever since the question was
first initiated. I can understand no federation that
would bring success or be lasting —and in this I am
sure Sir Henry Parkes will agree with me —unless
founded on what is just and right; and I cannot
understand anything being founded on justice and
righteousness which will put the minor colonies in
the position of being liable to be entirely over-
whelmed by the larger populations of certain colonies.
Hon. Members : Question! Question !
Sir GEORGE GREY: Hon. gentlemen seem to
be very anxious to prevent the voices of members
being heard. I think the whole of this debate has
been a great mistake.' Hon. gentlemen have been
talking of preserving the liberties of the people, the
liberties of the house of representatives, the liberties
of the senate. They have been talking of imaginary
things. There are no liberties at all. Let us follow
out the question. How is the house of representa-
tives to be created ? By fair voting ? No voice can
answer yes. All know in their hearts that no fair
voting is to be allowed. AYhat of the plural voting?
I am told that in one colony of Australia so far does
plural voting go that it is exercised by paper
votes being sent; that is, one man, if there were
twenty-five electorates, would have twenty-five votes,
lie would vote in as many districts as he could per-
sonally, and vote by proxy in the others. Is that fair
voting?
Mr. Macdonald-Paterson : There is no voting by
proxy!
Mr. Playford : That is not the question !
Sir GEORGE GREY : I believe it is the case in
Western Australia.
Mr. Munro: Unhappy Western Australia !
Sir GEORGE GREY: Unhappy Western Aus-
tralia, yes; but, in truth, unhappy Australia
altogether under that system. I say that the house
of representatives would in no way represent the
people, but would represent simply the landowners
of the colonies. That is the usual way, except in
South Australia and in New Zealand. If New
Zealand becomes a member of the confederacy,
except in those two places anything like fair voting
would be absolutely unknown, and the house of
representatives would not represent the people but
would represent capital. The state legislatures are
not allowed to represent the people, but are forced
by the present laws to represent capital, and, that
being so, bon. members say that the state legislatures
shall elect the senate —that is, a constituency unfairly
and unjustly created is to return the senate —and
then hon. members debate as if it were a matter of
the greatest consequence to the liberties of the
people of this country whether the senate or the
house of representatives shall have the greater power.
What care.we for their power? It is the power of
capital alone, and squabbles between two parties of
capitalists little interest the people at large. That
is how the question stands. I say, therefore, that
the debate is really useless, and what will follow
from this? I fear that what will follow is that,
when the question comes of this constitution being
accepted by the people, it will be said that it is the
state legislatures who are to vote as to whether it
shall or shall not be accepted—that is, that upon
that great all-absorbing question the people of
Australasia and New Zealand shall have no power
to determine what their fate is to be.
Mr. Munro : AAc will take care of that!
Sir GEORGE GREY: How r can it be taken care
of?
Mr. Munro : AYe will send it to them !
Sir GEORGE GREY : But, then, how will the
people vote ?
Mr, Playford : Yea or nay !
Sir GEORGE GREY: How will the people vote
with plural votes against them ? You refused to let
them have the power of voting man by man.
Mr. Munro : I voted with the hon. member !
Sir GEORGE GREY: Yes, the hon. gentleman
did ; but lam speaking of the House. I was grateful
to the hon. member for the vote that he gave, and I
believe that his name will stand high in Australia for
having given it. AYe may be few in number, but
the time will come wdien it will be thought the more
honorable that we, as few in number, should have
fought this great question, and at last brought it to
a successful issue; for if fair voting is not given to
the people, I feel certain that from one end of
Australia to the other the people will resolve upon
petitions to the parliament in England, and expose


the true state o£ things, and be saved from a
constitution being imposed on them which is
merely a sham constitution, as is the proposed
constitution that we are calling into existence.
It is not worth our while further to debate this
subject, and I shall say no more upon it; but I simply
reaffirm absolutely—and I know that I am speaking
the truth, which cannot fairly bo contradicted —that
under this constitution there is no fair voting what-
ever allowed to the people of Australia, in any part
of it, and that the only persons who do exercise it are
those who have obtained it in former days, by
struggles in some cases protracted through years,
and that if this constitution is imposed upon them
it will ultimately lead to such contests amongst the
people themselves that I feel certain that disorder,
distress, and discomfort will exist yet for many years
in Australia, which would bo totally avoided if this
Convention would at once do that justice to their
fellow citizens to which they are entitled. When
we are told, as I heard an lion, gentleman say just
now, that we are taking an example from America as
to what we should do about the senate, I say that that
has no relation whatever to us, because in America
there is the system of every man having one vote.
Their institutions are based upon that, and if ours is
based on this system of plural voting, in which one
man may exercise, perhaps, more than twenty votes
against one of his fellow citizen’s, then I say there is
no justice in this country, that it matters not to us
what the constitution is, that we are simply governed
by a few persons, who will naturally look to their
own interests. My hon. friend opposite said it abso-
lutely was, and should be, kept a government of the
people, for the people, and by the people ; but I say
that it is not a government of the people, it is not for
the people, and it is not by the people. In not one
of those respects does such a government exist here,
and in not one of those respects will a government exist
which is established under the absolute resolutions
which we have adopted in the act which we are about
to try and force on the country. I think we might
drop all consultation on the subject. To us it is indif-
ferent whether it is the senate that has this power, or
whether it is the house of representatives that has
the power. The one thing that we have to do with
is that the people of Australasia have not the power,
and yet they are the persons in whose hands it should
exist.
Mr. DIBBS; When the debate on the main
question took place in the early days of this Conven-
tion, had a vote been taken 1 think the question
would have been decided in favour of the principle
laid down in the amendment of the hon. member,
Mr. Baker, in the proportion of something like 10 to
3. One naturally asks, what has the Convention
done; what mysterious influence has been at work
in the star chamber of the select committee to cause
thirty men to come round to the views of ten ?
When we first started, this question would have been
so settled as to create a senate that would have been
worthy of the federation. The hon. member, Sir
Henry Parkes, who held certain views before the
sub-committee was appointed, seems to have talked
the select committee round to what the hon. member,
Mr. McMillan, calls a wretched compromise. It is
an absolute compromise, as wretched as wretched can
be, for it is laying the axe to the root of an indepen-
dent senate upon which, as in the case of America,
the people, the democracy, would look with confidence,
and upon which they would rely for the good of the
country. So far there has been no speech which
answered that made since lunch by the hon. member,
Sir John Downer, who, I think, put the matter very
clearly. As he savs, there is the experience of
America for more than 100 years, with a powerful
senate, and democratic America to-day believes in the
senate as therein constituted. What we are asked to
do by this clause, as it is printed in the bill, is not to
follow the lines of the British Constitution ; but the
framers of the bill, and those who sat in the sub-
committee upon it, have followed the lines of the
American Constitution. When it is proposed to
give the senate the power of the American Senate,
hon. members go back to the worn-out theory of the
British Constitution as regards the House of Lords,
or any nominee chamber. I for a long time have
believed in the existence of a nominee upper house.
To-day Ido not. To-day I believe in an elective
upper house, and looking at our colony —for that
one's OAVII colony is the place where we get the most
experience—and seeing the appointments made from
time to time by ministers in poAver of men utterly
unfit to be senators or legislators, I think the time
has arrived when that poAver should be taken out of
the hands of ministers, and in some form left in the
hands of the people. From what is proposed here
one would imagine that the people would have no
voice in the election of the senate. The people will
elect their representatives, and the house of repre-
sentatives Avill elect the members of the senate.
Surely that is election through the people by the
mouths of their representatives, who are responsible
to their constituents for their election to the senate.
I do not know a more refined process by Avhich you
could make a more perfect, and independent, and
probably intelligent senate than that. It is for that
reason that I hold that the senate to be of any power
at all must be framed on the direct lines of the
American Senate, and have coequal powers with the
house of representatives. All the arguments which
can be used in regard to responsible government and
the house of representatives have been fairly stated
by the hon. member, Sir John Downer, and I have
heard nothing yet in reply to them. The house of
representatives will decide the fate of a ministry, and,
after all, there will be responsible government by the
action of the house of representatives. Now Ave
know perfectly well that the feeling has arisen in
England, and that even some of the most distin-
guished statesmen in England are endeavouring to
reform the constitution of the House of Lords, and
I hope they may succeed. We know perfectly well
that there has been no attempt on the part of the
democracy of America to lessen the influence or
power of the senate ; but that as time rolls by, with
the experience of 100 years, the senate still holds
the affections of the people. Why we should
attempt—and I borrow the words from my hon.
friend, Mr. McMillan, again—to degrade the senate
of federal Australia is a matter beyond my concep-
tion. That is the second point where I cannot
realise my position. I was led away by the speech
of the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, and those
who spoke with him on the main debate. My mind
was then made perfectly clear that when the time
arrived for me to record my vote it would be in
favour of creating a powerful senate. But what
is the mysterious influence that has been at work
with hon. members that thirty should bow the knee
to ten ? I should like to hear the history of that
secret conclaA r e, that select committee, where thirty
men gave way to ten. Who has jibbed on the busi-
ness ? Who has turned traitor on the principles
which they ad\ r ocated here in eloquent speeches, and
which misled young men like myself to permit my
mind to believe that a strong senate Avas good for the
country ? But now we have this maudling proposi-
tion put forward for the senate to make suggestions
to the house of representatives. We knoAv perfectly-
well in nine cases out of ten in Avhat manner the
suggestions Avould be receiA r ed. Our great desire for
the future good of this country should be to create a
powerful senate. Kemember we haA r e no property
qualification for the senate. The qualification
in the bill for a senator is that he shall have reached
a certain advanced age, and shall have resided
a certain time in the country. Beyond that, money


or capital is in no way represented in the senate,
and the humblest man who may be fit for the position
may be elected through one of the various state legis-
latures to the highest position in the land —to the
senate. As you have made the qualification so slight
for the position of senator, there are men in the
democratic classes who will aspire, and who will un-
doubtedly reach, by reason of their talents and
character, the highest position which the country can
confer on any citizen —a senatorship. Why should
we ask the senate to be a mere recording house;
why should we give the senate absolutely less power
than a nominee house —less power than the nominee
house of New South Wales possesses to-day, and less
than other nominee houses possess ? We know that
from time to time—and we shall hear of it when our
Parliament meets —some very curious appointments
are made, even in our own colony within the last
few weeks—appointments which clearly convince
those who have given the slightest thought to the
question that a nominee house is not good for the
interests of either the states or the federal parlia-
ment.
Mr. Playford : That is nothing to do with us !
Mr. Miikro : They will take a part in the election I
Mr. DIBBS : They will; but you have your senate
elected by the states, and give them co-equal power,
as I would, then you would find that in the states,
where the nominee chamber exists, and where it has
been used so disgracefully as it has been in
times past, if not lately, the people would insist
upon changing the state constitution and introducing
the elective principle. Por my part, I am beginning
seriously to change my mind upon the old nominee
system, and I am coming gradually round, and with
very good reason, to believe that an elective upper
chamber is necessary for the states, even if we adopt
the proposal in this bill, even if the hon. member, Mr.
Baker’s, amendment be carried, of having the members
of the senate elected by the various states through the
state parliament. Now, what we are trying to provide
for is how to get overthe possibility of a deadlock, con-
stituted as the senate will be. An idea has got into
the minds of hon. members that the smaller states
will rule the larger, or that the larger will rule the
smaller. A way to get over the difficulty is to adopt
to a large extent the Norwegian system, which, in its
working, prevents the possibility of a deadlock in the
carrying out of the functions of the two houses.
Under the Norwegian system, as hon. members know,
in the event of a deadlock occurring aud a bill being
sent back from the house of representatives to the
senate, and refusing to acknowledge the senate’s
amendments, both houses meet as one house, and the
question is there threshed out and settled on one
vote. If that system be adopted without any refer-
endum to the people, or without anything of the
kind, the whole question of a deadlock falls to the
ground. That is the form of parliament which it
appears to me hon. members are trying to bring
about.
Mr. Playford ; That settles the senate straight!
Mr. DIBBS : Never mind if it did. It would
bring a finality to the question, for, after all, we must
assume that the members of the senate will be as
intelligent as the members of the house of represent-
atives. If we were proposing to put the inmates of
the various lunatic asylums in the senate, then you
might wish to create the senate in the way you are
seeking to do under the bill. But if we wish to fill
the senate with the nominees of some corrupt govern-
ment, then fence their powers round in every possible
form in order to safeguard the liberties of the
people. But where the senate is elected from the
house of representatives, which may be just fresh
from the hustings, and where the house of representa-
tives is responsible to the constituencies, I say that
by the adoption of that refined process you will have
a chance of getting a more intelligent, and better
educated, and a senate of such a character as may
with safety be trusted with co-equal powers with the
lower house, provided that there is, however, some
mode such as is contained in the Norwegian Con-
stitution of settling a deadlock which may occasion-
ally occur by one united vote. Por my part, I shall
give my vote in favour of the amendment of the hon.
member, Mr. Baker. I shall then give my vote in
favour of the principle to which a majority agreed
three weeks ago. I shall give my vote in the
direction in which my mind was influenced by the
speeches wliicb I heard three weeks ago, for nothing
has been said since the committee reported to the
Convention to change my mind or the minds of hon.
members. If the hon. member, Mr. Baker, fails in
carrying his amendment, then the next best course
open is the proposal of my hon. friend, Mr. McMillan,
which we shall have to take as a sort of via media
between the extreme view of the hon. member, Mr.
Baker, aud the constitution as proposed in the bill.
But at the present time I shall give my vote to make
the senate worthy of what Australia shall become,
not a degraded institution, not a senate whose
members may be the most inferior, instead of the
best men the country can produce, but a body of men
whose weight, whose experience, and whose intelli-
gence will be felt throughout the country ; a senate
which, as in the case of America, will command the
full confidence and respect of the people.

Question so resolved in the affirmative.
Amendment negatived.
Mr. McMILLAN; I shall say very little in placing
my amendment before the Committee. I propose to
retain sub-clause 1 down to the word “government.”
It will be necessary to propose the amendment in a
certain w r ay, because Ido not want the excision of
sub-clause 4. I shall propose an amendment to
follow" on after the word “ government,” and then, if
my amendment be carried, 1 shall propose the excision
of sub-clauses 2 and 3, allowing sub-clause 4 to stand,
and moving afterwards the excision of sub-clause 5.
The clause, as amended, would read as follows :
(1.) The senate shall have equal powder with the house of
representatives in respect of all proposed laws, except laws
imposing taxation and laws appropriating the necessary
supplies for the ordinary annual services of the government.
(2.) In respect of law's appropriating the necessary supplies
for the ordinary annual services of the government, the senate
shall have the power to affirm or reject, but not to amend.
(3.) In respect of laws imposing taxation, the senate shall
have the power to amend ; but if any proposed law imposing
taxation is amended by the senate, and is afterwards
returned to the senate by the house of representatives, the
senate shall not have the power to send the proposed law r
again to the house of representatives with any amendment in
it to which the house of representatives has not agreed, but
shall either affirm or reject it.


The only matters to which I intend to refer in putting
this amendment before the house are: first, the
question with regard to the bearing of the senate on
state rights; and, secondly, its bearing with regard
to responsible government. Now, as far as the
question of state rights is concerned, I do not argue
that the upper chamber is absolutely and essentially
intended to conserve those rights. If I have any
feeling at all in the matter, I think that, personally,
I tend more towards the principle of unification than
of federation, and the action I take now 1 would
take if we were assembled here to declare the unifi-
cation of Australia under one political government.
I stand up for the rights and liberties of the upper
chamber, which, I believe, would be a solid bulwark
of the liberties of the people of this country, and when
that chamber is elected, if not directly, at any rate
indirectly by the people —that is, elected by those who
are directly elected by the people—l hold that any
analogy sought to be drawn between that chamber and
the House of Lords or a nominee chamber is utterly out
of place. Furthermore, with regard to responsible
government, I do not hold that the question of res-
ponsible government is touched at all in this matter.
It has been said here that the most important matters
coming under the view of the legislature are not con-
nected with finance at all; and we know that most of
the questions upon which governments stand or fall
have nothing whatever to do with finance. If the
upper house has the power not only to veto but to
amend bills involving great questions of public policy,
affecting the whole social interest of the people —
surely if constitutional and responsible government
can exist under such a state of affairs in regard to these
subjects, it is absurd to fear that constitutional and
responsible government are going by the board
because we allow the upper house the power of
amendment. I simply reiterate these views in order—
as I am taking upon myself a heavy responsibility —
that I may be free from misapprehension. I do not
consider the question of an appropriation bill is at all
analogous to a bill creating a new policy. The appro-
priation bill simpl} r covers the expenditure based
upon a policy previously agreed to, and upon which
the upper house, according to my amendment, would
have a perfect right to record its decision by way of
amendment. I believe that this is a fair and reason-
able compromise. I believe it is an improvement on
the mode suggested for exactly the same purpose,
and to bring about the same results, by hon. gentle-
men of the Constitutional Committee, and it is with
the full confidence that it will be accepted as a com-
promise that I now submit it to the Convention. I
move:
That the words “which the senate may affirm or reject,
but may not amend. But the senate may not amend
any proposed law in such a manner as to increase
any proposed charge or burden on the people,” be
omitted.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: My hon. friend, Mr-
McMillan, is quite right when he says that he
assumes a very serious responsibility in proposing
this amendment, because this subject after several
days’ debate in the Convention, received the anxious
attention of the committee for several days and from
every point of view; and they did not adopt this form
of words without carefully choosing every word, and
considering how the proposed scheme would work
out in practice. I shall be able to show in a very few
minutes that whatever merits there may be in this
amendment of the hon. member’s, he has not only not
given it half the consideration winch the committee
gave their proposal; but, also that, while I believe
he brings it forward with a view to strengthening
the power of the senate, he is distinctly weakening
the power of that body, and taking away the most
beneficial powers proposed to be given to it under
the suggested compromise. I will deal, first of all,
with the case of appropriation bills. The hon. member
does not propose to leave out the 4th paragraph of
the clause, which provides :
The expenditure for services other than the ordinary annual
services of the government shall not be authorised by the
same law as that which appropriates the supplies for such
ordinary annual services, but shall be authorised by a separate
law or laws.
Supposing the senate were of opinion that there was
a violation of that provision, that there was some-
thing in an ordinary appropriation bill violating that
rule, and which, no doubt, the house of representa-
tives would take out if its attention were called to it
by the senate. The amendment of the hon. member
would prevent the senate from doing so. In fact,
while the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th paragraphs of this clause
carefully guard against tacking, the hon. member
would actually facilitate tacking, while at the same
time he shuts the mouth of the senate, compelling
them either to swallow the whole bill or to throw the
public service into confusion by rejecting it. Does
the hon. member mean to do that? Surely he has
not thought out the subject, or he would have drawn
up the amendment in a better form. These objec-
tions with regard to appropriation bills occur to me
at the moment. On the other hand, the hon. member
proposes to give the senate the power of increasing
taxation, which was not proposed before. Then there
is this extraordinary proposal: Instead of the senate
making a request that an item in a bill which they
regard as objectionable should be omitted, ■which
request would be considered by the house of repre-
sentatives, no doubt in conference with the senate,
so that they might come to an amicable conclusion,
the hon. member absolutely prohibits a conference.
He says that if once an alteration is made in a tax-
ation bill it must be made in the form of an amend-
ment, when it is to go direct to the house of repre-
sentatives, and unless they instantly adopt it the
thing is at an end.
Mr. McMillan : My amendment does not provide
necessarily that there shall not be a conference !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Yes ; because if the
house of representatives say they will not agree to
the amendment there is an end of it. All the facili-
ties that are offered by this compromise, which was
carefully thought out, for allowing the two houses to
come to an understanding, are swept away. They
are at once to be placed at arm’s length. The senate
is really to have no alternative but to reject the
whole measure, or accept items which they consider
objectionable, and which the other house might be
willing to omit.
Mr. McMillan : The clause, as it stands, does
not provide for a conference any more than my
amendment does!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : The amendment
prohibits a conference, because, if once an amend-
ment goes back to the house of representatives, there
is no chance offered for a conference.
Mr. McMillan: Nothing of the kind!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : That may not be what
the hon. member means, because the proposal is so
preposterous that I do not believe that the hon.
member would deliberately make it. I am, however,
criticising the amendment as it is placed before hon.
members. As soon as an amendment is made —and
it must take that form—it is sent back to the house
of representatives, and if it is not acceptable to the
house of representatives, all compromise is at an end,
except by dropping the bill. Surely that is not an
improvement on the proposal contained in the bill.
I entreat hon. members in considering this subject to
bear in mind what was pointed out by the President
at the beginning of the Convention. We shall never
arrive at a satisfactory conclusion unless we meet in
a spirit of compromise. Some hon. members seem
to have disregarded that spirit altogether. Ido not
think the clause in the bill is by any means in the
best possible form, but I believe it is in the best


attainable form, which is a different thing. It may
be that being in the best attainable form, it is really
in its best form, because w'e are here to do the best
we can for Australia, and if this is the best thing that
can be done with a chance of securing the assent of
the people of Australia, w r e ought to adopt it,
although our ow r n individual opinions would have
led us to cast the clause in a different form. I hope
sincerely that hon. members will regard the question
from that point of view, and that the hon. member,
Mr. McMillan, will not press his amendment.
Mr. FITZGERALD : I think that it w r as incum-
bent upon the hon. member, Mr. McMillan, to ex-
plain in what way this amendment of his could be
more in accordance with the dignity of the senate,
and, therefore, more in accordance with the immediate
object he had in view, than the clause he wishes
to expunge, .fudging from a long experience in the
upper branch of a parliament in not one of the
smallest of the colonies, it appears to me that if the
upper house had the power to amend in the first
place, and return the bill with an amendment to the
house of representatives, the house of representatives
fully knowing that if they refused to accept the
amendment, and sent the measure back to the senate,
they could force the senate to reject or to accept the
measure, the house of representatives would regard
it as tantamount to an invitation not to consider any
amendments made by the senate, so placing the
senate in the position in winch they would have been
if they had had no power to alter the measure in the
first instance. I do not see how it enhances the
dignity of any branch of the parliament to give it
power to amend a bill, while at the same time you
place it in the pow r er of the other branch of the
legislature to send back a measure to the senate a
second time, and force that branch to say “ aye” or
“ no ” without the power of amendment. I say that,
in the spirit of compromise, which is the raison
d'etre of this Convention, it is far more dignified and
more in accordance with the value winch the upper
chamber should have in the legislature of the pro-
posed commonwealth, that the senate should not
make an amendment in a measure, but should signify
their desire to meet in a friendly spirit with the house
of representatives. If they could give a manifesta-
tion of their desire as to the direction in which an
amendment should be made, surely that would place
them in a more dignified position than to do as the
hon. member, Mr. McMillan, proposes. I think the
hon. member has entirely mistaken the effect his
amendment would have. It would tend to lower the
dignity of the senate, it would be practically sug-
gestive of altercations between the two houses, and
it is at variance with the spirit winch has led so
many of us to yield our sincerely held opinions as to
the importance of giving the senate power over all
legislation. I do not think that this Convention,
after affirming that principle in a spirit of compromise,
will be led away from that spirit and adopt a course
which, instead of increasing, would lower the dignity
of the senate, w r hich would be suggestive of alterca-
tion and dispute, and w r ould invariably, in case of a
dispute, lead to the senate taking a lower place in
the respect, not only of the world, but of the people
of these colonies.
Mr. PLAYEOEI3 : It is astonishing to me that a
gentleman should get up and say that he is fighting
for the rights and privileges of the senate, and at
the same time propose to take away the rights and
privileges which w r e in committee agreed that they
should exercise. The * principle of tacking, of in-
cluding in one bill two separate subjects, will be
allow r ed if the amendment is adopted. The hon.
member proposes to strike out paragraphs 2 and 3,
which distinctly prevent the tacking on to a taxation
bill of any other subject than the one subject of
taxation. It prevents two subjects of taxation from
being mixed up together, so as to give the senate
power to throw out any bill without interfering with
any other subject whatever. The hon. member, Mr.
McMillan, appears to have altogether misunderstood
the position. I have no doubt he believed that in
proposing his amendment he was conserving the
rights of the senate, but he is not conserving the
rights of the senate in any sense; and so far as the
matter of form is concerned, the difference between
sending down amendments from the senate, and
sending suggestions is the difference between tweedle-
dum and tweedledee. The practical result will be
the same whether amendments or suggestions are
sent from the senate to the house of representatives.
The hon. member proposes that the amendments
shall not be dealt with by the senate in the
ordinary way; but if the house of representatives
disagree with the amendments made by the senate
in the bill, then there shall be no option for the
senate but to accept or reject the bill in tolo. If we
make a difference in substance, why not have a
different form to mark that difference in substance ?
It would be a great deal better to say to the senate:
“ Send down your suggestions, and we will agree
with them or disagree with them,” than to say,
“ Send them down in the form of amendments,”
because in dealing with them in the form of
amendments you alter the substance of the amend-
ment altogether, and insist that they shall deal with
the question in a totally different manner. I would
ask the Committee to agree to the clause as it stands.
It was most carefully considered by the members of
the Constitution Committee. Time after lime the
question came up, and it was considered from the
standpoint of conserving the rights and privileges
and giving as much power as we consistently could
to the senate. I contend that the amendment will
have precisely the opposite effect.
Mr. THYNNE : As a member of the Constitution
Committee, I did not approve of this clause as pro-
posed, because I believe that the senate should have
coequal powers in all these matters with the house
of representatives ; but that principle has not been
adopted by the Convention. I will, therefore, sup-
port the clause which has been brought up by the
Constitution Committee as being, as I think, the
next best provision that can be made.
Amendment negatived.
Mr. WIiIXON : I wish to ask the attention of
the Committee for a moment whilst I propose a new
sub-clause to stand as sub-clause 6. I will not
detain the Convention long, but hon. members will
see the position in which the question now is. We
have arrauged to give the senate the right to send
down proposed amendments to the house of repre-
sentatives. Those amendments the house of repre-
sentatives may or may not accept as they think
proper. This proposed power extends to the appro-
priation bill as well as to every other bill, and 1 am
afraid that in working it will be found to be pro-
ductive of confusion and conflict. lam convinced
that a similar power, if exercised with regard to the
appropriation bill in any of our provinces, would
lead to such confusion that the government could not
be carried on unless you had some means of securing
finality, and I am afraid that in passing this now
and postponing any means of settling a difference if
it arises—a difference on such a critical measure as
an appropriation bill —we are only postponing the
difficulty from this Convention to the future domin-
ion parliament. We are not agreed as to how it will
work ; as to whether the house of representatives
will be compelled under moral pressure to accept the
suggestions of the senate, or whether the house of
representatives would be just as free as any lower
house now is to disregard any proposal made by the
upper house to interfere with its appropriation act.
Some think the clause will give the senate some new
powers; others think it will not. Whatever we
think, we leave the matter entirely without any


provision for settling the difficulty when it arises.
It may be asked, why settle things ? The reason is
because you provide new machinery ; you recognise
the right of the senate to scrutinise the appropriation
bill, and in giving that right you inferentially make
it their duty to scrutinise the items in that bill, and
not to pass the bill if it contains items of which they
disapprove. I feel that there will be that difficulty ;
and there is no means of settling it if it arises. I
will, therefore, propose the new sub-clause as it is
printed, with one or two amendments which the hon.
and learned member, Sir Samuel Griffith, has sug-
gested. I move:
That the following stand as sub-clause (6) ;—“lf the house
of representatives decline to make any such omission or
amendment, the senate may request a joint meeting of the
members of the two houses, which shall thereupon be held,
and the question shall be determined by a majority of the
members present at such meeting.”
Under that there can be no deadlocks; finality is
reached ; the machine will work. If you have no
such arrangement, I do not know how you will deal
with the ordinary finances of the year. If there is
any considerable division in the house of representa-
tives, the senate, in voting with them, would be able
to carry their point. On the other hand, if the
senate is pretty unanimous, and the house of repre-
sentatives is divided, then the senate by joining the
minority in the house of representatives w r ould have
its way. I admit that if a large proportion of the
members of the house of representatives were deter-
mined on any view, they would be able to carry their
view, and I think it is only reasonable that it should
be so. I do not think there should be anything to
enable the wish of the majority of the people, as
expressed in the house of representatives, to be over-
ridden. I submit my amendment for the considera-
tion of the Convention, as I think it desirable that
we should not overlook a difficulty, which certainly
will arise hereafter.
Sir SAMUEL GEIFFITH : I would ask the hon.
member, Mr. Wrixon, if he has considered the matter
from this point of view P The senate need not ask
for a joint meeting unless it likes, and it would not
ask for it unless it counted heads and saw that it
would have a majority; so that by his proposal the
senate would be able to coerce the house of repre-
sentatives,
Mr. W rixon : And rightly so whenever they had a
majority, but whenever they had not a majority, of
course, they would not!
Sir SAMUEL GEIFFITH: Whenever they had
an opportunity they would enforce their views as
against the house of representatives.
Mr. FitzGerald : Take the other view !
Sir SAMUEL GEIFFITH : Then I do not think
that the senate would call a meeting.
Mr. Donaldson : They would be taunted for not
doiug so!
Mr. FitzGerald : Take the other view, that the
house of representatives would not agree to the
meeting if they thought they had a majority!
Sir SAMUEL GEIFFITH : From every point of
view I think the amendment is a dangerous one, and
I confess that I have no love for these artificial means
of settling differences between the two houses.
Mr. FITZGEEALD : It appears to me that if the
senate had this power it would close the door to their
having the power which we desire to give them, of
sending down suggestions with regard to amend-
ments which they wanted to see adopted. If the
house of representatives were aware that the senate
had still a reserve, they w T ould say, “ Oh, we will
not have a meeting”—in other words, the action
of the house of representatives would depend upon
the number of heads which they could count in their
favour, and the meeting would not be held. More-
over, has it not for many years been brought before
the notice of members of parliament in these colonies
that these mechanical means of settling disputes are
worse than useless ? If we already place reliance
upon the spirit of moderation and justice, and the
high, honorable feeling of the men who enter the
parliaments of these colonies, and believe that they
are governed by high motives, and not actuated by
the desire for paltry victories over their opponents,
how much more can we place reliance in the great
parliament which we hope to create. Can we have
the great national life which we all say we shall call
into existence by federation without an enhanced
sense of national honor ? Must not the two go
together ; and, if we have both, cannot we rely upon
the proper spirit and motives which will actuate the
members of both houses, and believe that questions
of difference will not lead to confusion, and that the
members of the federal parliament will not bo
governed by the consideration of party or personal
politics, but by the interests of the country at large ?
I hope that we shall trust the parliament, and not
leave the provisions of the bill as they are.
Mr. DEAKIN : For my own part, I wish to enter
my dissent from the views of the last speaker, and
the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith. As I under-
stand them, they are opposed to what they term a
mechanical" method of settling differences between
the two houses. But unless we are to be frightened
by a word, we should welcome every means that are
just for settling the disputes which may arise between
two bodies clothed with co-ordinate, or at least large
powers, and charged with the highest duties. I
should be in favour of any means shown to be just
to the electors of the country of settling disputes
when they arise, and I think my hon. colleague is to
be commended for having submitted this amendment
to the Committee. Not that it appears sufficiently
perfect in its details to encourage us in making any
strong effort for its adoption, because, having already
tested the feeling of the Constitutional Committee
myself, I have discovered that, so far as it was a reflex
of the Convention, it was opposed to the employment
of any such means; but lam convinced that in the
future the electors under this constitution will be
compelled to take advantage of its provisions to
amend it in such a way as to provide for the settle-
ment of deadlocks when they arise.
Mr. MUNRO : They will never arise!
Mr. DEAKIN: lam convinced that what the
hon. member, Mr. Wrixon, proposes for the joint
settling of differences between the houses will
be an excellent arrangement so soon as those houses
are equally responsible to the electors. During this
debate it was endeavoured to be argued that the
upper house represented the masses and not the
classes, to which the obvious reply is that the
classes are represented in the house of repre-
sentatives, and then in the upper house, which
is based on a limited franchise, they are given a
second representation. The chief objection to my
hon. friend's proposition is that it would increase the
power of tho class houses by means of this joint
sitting. The justice and moderation to which the
hon. member, Mr. FitzGerald, alluded, are not
always to be found in houses indirectly elected by
the people. So, for the opposite reason to that
which actuated my hon. friend, it appears to me that
it is not desirable to accept this proposal at the
present time. I rise, however, for the purpose of
saying that the proposition of the hon. member, Mr.
Wrixon, is an attempt to improve upon a clause
which certainly needs great improvement. For my
own part, I believe that the powers intrusted to the
senate under this clause —the new powers—are of
the largest and most serious character.
An HON. MEMBER : Too large !
Mr. DEAKIN: I believe that the day will come
when the electors of this country will demand that the
powers granted by this clause shall be considerably
restricted. It may be, however, if the development


of the country is to lead, as some hon. members
suppose, to the election in each case of upper houses,
which will be directly responsible to the people them-
selves, that the demand may take another direction.
But certainly so long as the upper chambers are
maintained on their present narrow basis, so long
will the electors of the commonwealth of Australia
object to the exceptional powers given to the senate
by this clause. They will certainly lead to conflict,
and I, for one, w r ould be no party to setting my seal
to these provisions which are forced upon us
under existing circumstances were I not convinced
that with a responsible government answerable only
to one chamber, and that chamber responsible
to the whole people, victory is assured to the popular
party. But it will be victory after strife, and after
strife that we shall regret.
Amendment negatived ; clause, as read agreed to.
Clause 56. It shall not be lawful for the house of representa-
tives to pass any vote, resolution, or law for the appropriation
of any part of the public revenue, or of the produce of any tax
or impost, to any purpose that has not been first recommended
to that house by message of the governor-general in the session
in which the vote, resolution, or law, is proposed.
Sir JOHN BRAY: I would ask the hon. member,
Sir Samuel Griffith, what is the difference between
“ any part of the public revenue ” and “the produce
of any tax or impost ” ? I should imagine that the
produce of any tax or impost would become part of
the public revenue, and I think that if these words
are inserted they will give rise to a good deal of con-
fusion by-and-bye. It has been determined that the
imposition of a fine or penalty is a tax, and suppos-
ing part of such a fine were to go to the informer,
would the bill containing that provision have to be
introduced by a message from the governor? I do
not think we ought to require any message from the
governor for any bill except an appropriation bill.
Before moving any amendment, however, I would
like to know from the hon. member whether it is in-
tended that these words shall mean anything more
than the appropriation of the public revenue.
Sir SAMUEL GRIEEITH: The phrase is a familiar
one in most of the constitutions.
Sir John Bray: No !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: It occurs in all the
constitutions that I have seen, and applies particularly
to cases of which many occur in Queensland, and
some occur no doubt in the other colonies, where a
fund is raised under a particular law for a par-
ticular purpose. The money is. not paid into the
general revenue, but forms a special fund adminis-
tered for the benefit of the people who raise it. Take,
for instance, the stock assessment fund, or the brands
fund, which are raised by contributions from owners
of stock, and the money collected is appropriated
entirely for their benefit. It would not be convenient
to mix such matters up with the ordinary revenue.
Sir JOHN BRAY: I move :
That in lines 3 and 4, the words “ or of the produce of any
tax or impost ” be struck out.
It seems to me that if the object w r ere to raise a stock-
tax and appropriate it in a certain way, the measure
dealing with it could very properly bo introduced by
a private member who had a knowledge of the sub-
ject. That would not in any way interfere with the
appropriation of public revenue, or prevent the
government from carrying on its ordinary duties of
administration. If this clause stands as it is printed
nobody but a member of the government could intro-
duce a bill having such an object, because you must
get a message from the governor, and a private mem-
ber could not get one. It seems to me that the words
arc entirely unnecessary.
Mr. GILLIES : I am afraid the hon. member has
not altogether thought out this clause. It may come
to this : that a bill may bo introduced into parliament
which imposes a tax. If that tax is there and then
proposed to be appropriated to some purpose it will,
and it ought to, require a message.
Sir John Bray : Not unless it is part of the public
revenue!
Mr. GILLIES: These are parts of the public
revenue.
Sir John Bray : Then the words are not necessary.
Mr. GILLIES: I am pointing out to the lion,
member that if, in the same bill, it is proposed to
make an appropriation, it is usual to have a message
from the governor. If an ordinary tax is proposed
the money naturally goes into the public revenue ;
blit if it is proposed to be appropriated to some
other purpose a message will be required. Ido not
think there is any doubt about that. This is the
same form as is used in the Constitution Act of New
South Wales, which states :
It shall not be lawful for the Legislative Assembly to
originate or pass any vote, resolution, or bill for the appro-
priation of any part of the said consolidated revenue fund, or
of any other tax or impost, to any purpose which shall not
have been recommended by a message.
Amendment negatived ; clause agreed to.
Clause 57 (Royal assent to bills).
Mr. DIBBS: The second portion of this clause
seems to me to be a novelty in responsible govern-
ment. Is the governor-general to be the governor-
general and executive? The latter portion of the
clause seems to me to be perfectly useless.
Mr. Munro ; Some verbal amendments may be
required to be made in a bill!
Clause agreed to.
Clause 58. When the governor-general assents to a law in
the Queen’s name he shall by the first convenient opportunity
send an authentic copy to the Queen, and if the Queen-in-
Council within two years after receipt thereof thinks fit to
disallow the law, such disallowance being made known by
the governor-general, by speech or message, to each of the
houses of the parliament, or by proclamation, shall annul the
law from and after the day when the disallowance is so made
known.
Dr. COCKBURN: I think the period of dis-
allowance is larger than is necessary. It was all
very well many years ago, when the communication
with England was long and tedious; but now we
have such rapid means of communication that I
think two years is too long. I think it might
very well be reduced by one-half or one-fourth. Six
months or a year would be quite sufficient. There
is nothing more vexatious than uncertainty in these
matters. I think we should also lay down upon
what subjects the J)° wer of veto is to be exercised.
"We shall all agree that in questions of domestic
legislation
Mr. Gillies : We are not all agreed on the ques-
tion of the establishment of a republic !
Dr. COCKBTJRN : There is no question of that.
We want to establish such a commonwealth as will
exist with the least strained relations with the
mother country. Nothing gives rise to such vexa-
tion as a veto upon questions of domestic legislation.
Take the case of Canada.
Mr. Munro : Two years is the period fixed under
their Constitution !
Dr. COCKBURN: I know; but it was fixed
many years ago. There is nothing more irritating
than vetoing of domestic legislation. In the case of
Canada, one of the first acts of the federal govern-
ment was to reduce, by act of parliament, the salary
of the governor-general from £lO,OOO to £0,500 a
year, and this act, which w r as purely one of domestic
legislation, was vetoed by the Imperial Government.
I think the more w r e confine and define the limit of
veto, the less risk there is of inharmonious relations
with the mother country. I therefore move :
That the word “ two,” line 4, be omitted with a view to
the insertion of the word “one.”


I also intend to move:
That the following words be added to the clause : —“ Pro-
vided such disallowance shall be exercised on such
subjects only as affect imperial interests, and are
specified in schedule B.”
Sir GEOEGE GEEY: The Committee have re-
ceived this proposal rather with ridicule. Members
are probably not aware that this formed part of the
laws of New Zealand for many years, and worked
admirably, and was approved of at home. It saved a
great deal of trouble, and was really a very great
privilege, and, in point of fact, the clause which
enacted this was repealed, as I might say accidentally,
that is, an amending law was passed in which no
provision was made for the continuance of the system.
I am certain it was an entire oversight. It was
generally admitted in Great Britain that by narrow-
ing the number of acts sent to the Crown we very
much reduced the probability of any dispute taking
place between the Crown and the colony. The
arrangement was made in this way: The law did not
state the number of subjects upon which acts need
be sent home ; but it stated the actual subjects upon
which laws made must be transmitted for the Queen’s
allowance or disallowance. The system worked ad-
mirably, and never presented the slightest incon-
venience, and was thought a wise provision; and I
cannot myself see any objection to its insertion here.
I think it would be best, perhaps, to postpone the
subject, and to have a clause carefully drawn, which
would make members more clearly and fully under-
stand how much advantage was gained in point of
clerical work, independent of delay of time, and in-
dependent of any possible rupture between Great
Britain and the colony on the subject of the allowance
or disallowance of laws.
Sir SAMUEL GEIFFITH: I think, so long as
the Queen is an integral part of the parliament, it
certainly follows that, theoretically, she has the
power of diagreeing with a proposed law ; otherwise
we merely make two branches of the legislature for
dealing with those laws. With respect to the time,
the period of two years was probably fixed a long
time ago, and the question arises, are two years too
long? The object is, of course, to allow full com-
munication between her Majesty’s Government in
England and her Majesty’s Government in Aus-
tralia, before the extreme power of disallowance is
exercised. The term may not be too long. I re-
member the case of a law passed by the Federal
Council just two years ago affecting the fisheries in
Western Australia. It was very much objected to
by the people there. It is only in respect to cases of
that kind —the fisheries at Western Australia, North-
western Australia, and Torres Straits—that there is
likely to be any trouble. The people specially con-
cerned are entitled io be heard. When their views
have been placed before her Majesty’s Government
in England the imperial authorities will want to know
the views of the Australian government; and it does
not follow that the first communication on either side
will say all that is to be said on the subject; and if
you insist upon the time being limited to one ye r,
you may be insisting upon a very important thing
being done hurriedly. In the particular case to which
I refer the question was finally decided by telegram.
Mr. Gillies : If you do not give them time, the
chances are that they will disallow !
Sir SAMUEL GEIFFITH: Yes. In the case
referred to the time allowed was twelve months, and
the communications were carried on hurriedly. The
twelve months were on the point of expiring, and the
measure had to be disallowed or assented to. In that
case the time was found to be too short in which to do
the work satisfactorily. That was a comparatively
small matter, but the matters in respect to which any
question would be likely to arise under this constitu-
tion would be of much greater importance. I would
suggest that the words should be allowed to stand.
Mr. MAEMION: The hon. member, Dr. Cock-
burn, said that in questions of domestic legislation it
was not advisable that the Queen should have the
power of disallowance, and the hon. gentleman in-
stanced a case which he considered to be one of
domestic legislation. But it struck me that a diffi-
culty might arise as to what were questions of domes-
tic legislation ; and I do not think the hon. gentle-
man was particularly happy in quoting the case of the
salary of the governor-general being cut down by the
local legislature. So long as we give to the Queen
the power of appointing the governor-general, we
ought to allow her some exercise of discretion as to
the salary her appointee shall receive. Tinder this
bill the connection between the British Crown and
Australia generally is so very slight that we ought
not to do anything calculated to weaken it. The
time will possibly arrive quite soon enough for the
connecting link to be cut altogether, and we should
at any rate do nothing in this Convention to hasten
that time.
Amendment negatived.
Amendment (by Dr. Cockburn) negatived:
That the following words be added to the clause :—“ Pro-
vided that such disallowance shall be exercised on such
subjects only as affect imperial interests and are specified in
schedule B.”
CHAPTER II. —THE EXECUTIVE GOVERNMENT.
Clause 4, For the administration of the executive govern-
ment of the commonwealth, the governor-general may, from
time to time, appoint officers to administer such departments
of state of the commonwealth as the governor-general in
council may from time to time establish, and such officers shall
hold office during the pleasure of the governor-general, and
shall he capable of being chosen and of sitting as members of
either house of the parliament.
Such officers shall be members of the federal executive
council.
Sir JOHN BE AY: It seems to me that if we
want to preserve the power of the senate this is
where we should do it. I therefore propose :
That after the word “ governor-general,” line 6, the
following words be inserted : —“ and not less than two of such
officers shall be members of the senate.”
I think we ought to provide that some of the execu-
tive officers of the government should sit in the
senate, and not leave the matter entirely open, as it
is at present. I think we should provide that they
should be all members of parliament, and not
merely that they should be capable of being members
of parliament. As a matter of practice, we know
that they will all be members of parliament. Ido
not think there is any doubt about that. But if
the senate is to exercise a proper influence in the
management of the executive affairs of the country,
we ought to provide that at least some of the execu-
tive officers of the government shall hold seats in
that branch of the legislature. I shall propose also
that the words, “capable of being chosen and of sit-
ting as members of either house of the parliament,”
be struck out, so as to provide that the remainder
shall be members of the house of representatives.
Mr. GULLIES : I would suggest that the hon.
member ought not to press his amendment. We have
not said in this bill that any member of the govern-
ment shall sit in parliament; but we know it will be
necessary that they should do so. We have said it
is not necessary, though recognising that the prac-
tice has been for members of the executive govern-
ment to sit in parliament. I will tell the hon. mem-
ber a circumstance that arose in Victoria. There was
an occasion on which a government was formed for
the time being, and that government could not obtain
a representative in the Legislative Council. If a
provision such as he suggests had been in force, the
government would have been obliged to retire from
office. Although I was a political opponent of that
ministry, I have no hesitation in saying that at that
time it unquestionably possessed the confidence of a
majority of the people, and had a large majority in


the assembly. I ask the hen. member whether, be-
cause it could not just for the time being obtain a
representative in the upper house, a government
should be compelled to retire from office ? The
government to which I refer did afterwards succeed
in getting a gentleman to represent them in the
Council. While we do not insist that members of the
government shall sit in the assembly, I think it would
be a mistake to provide that they shall hold seats in
the senate.
Mr. MARMION: I should like to ask the last
speaker whether there is anything in the Constitu-
tion of Victoria which requires that there shall be a
member of the Legislative Council in the ministry ?
Mr. Gillies : No; but four of the ministers must
be members of parliament!
Mr. MARMION: The case is not quite analogous;
because, if we inserted the provision proposed, the
government would take care to have some one in the
senate to represent them.
Mr. FITZGERALD: I think the amendment is
hardly required. Any minister wishing to conduct
the business of parliament satisfactorily would find
the senate quite capable of guarding its own honor,
and he would uot be so ill-advised as to put a marked
slight upon the council by having no member of the
government with a seat in that chamber. I think
we may safely leave these things to adjust themselves.
The good sense of the parliament is the best protec-
tion we have that they will work without friction.
Amendment negatived.
Mr. WRIXON: There is one point with regard
to this clause to which I wish to call the attention of
the hon. member in charge of the bill, and with
regard to which I propose to add a few words at the
end of the clause. This clause may be said to con-
stitute responsible government in the dominion. It
provides that the governor-general may appoint
officers to administer departments of state, and it
declares that such officers shall be members of
the federal executive council. 1 have no doubt
that the effect and operation of that will be to
constitute a system of responsible government
in the dominion ; but the question which I think
requires some consideration, and some slight addi-
tion to the clause, is whether it will clothe them with
all the vast constitutional powers which, under the
system of the English government, belong to respon-
sible ministers of the Crown. I myself do uot believe
that it will. The greatness of these powers, and how
vast is the authority which any responsible minister
of the Crown exercises in binding the Crown and
the Sovereign, is well known, of course, to all my
legal friends, and was well illustrated in the old case
which I mentioned to the Convention before, namely,
the case of Euron and Denman. The Supreme
Court of Victoria has held that similar words in our
Constitution Act do not carry with them any such
implied authority to the minister who holds any such
office, on the ground that the statute that created the
office and defined his duties is not held to carry with
it the larger powers to which I have adverted.
Sir Samuel Griffith : There are no words like
those in your constitution !
Sir John Downer ! Nor in any constitution !
Mr. AVRIXON: The words, “ Such officers shall
be members of the executive council” ?
Mr. Clark: All that the hon. member wants is in
that!
Mr. AVRIXON : Of course that is the matter
which I am mooting. In my opinion it is not; but
it is a matter for consideration; and, whatever opinion
may be taken of it, I myself think that the matter
should be put beyond doubt; for, unquestionably, in
carrying out responsible, every-day government, it is
highly important that the ministers of the Crown
here should, in regard to all Australian matters, be
invested with exactly the same presumptions of
authority and ratification from the Crown as apply
to the English minister with regard to all English
matters.
Sir John Downer: That does not arise out of
responsibility.
Mr. AVRIXON : I think it does, or, at any rate,
it is a question of how we should express the idea.
I myself would propose that we add to the last
sub-clause “ and responsible ministers of the Crown”;
and I believe that then the court would interpret
that with reference to ordinary constitutional usage,
of which they would take judicial notice, and it is
well known, of course, in England what a responsible
minister is. It is known as a matter of fact and con-
stitutional law. The courts recognise that, and if we
declared that these officers were responsible ministers
of the Crown, I believe the court would impart to
that definition the knowledge which they would get
from reading in the light of ordinary constitutional
law. I point out this difficulty, and to meet it would
propose, as an amendment:
That the following words be added to the clause :—“ and
responsible ministers of the Crown.”
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: It seems to me that
what the hon. gentleman wants to arrive at is
already very clearly laid down in the bill. “Responsible
ministers of the Crown” is a term which is used in
common conversation to describe the form of govern-
ment that we have. It is really an epithet, but a bill
is not the place for an epithet. AVhat we should put
into the bill is a definition of the powers and tone l ions
of the officers —not call them by names. AVe might
as well say that they shall be called “ Honorable.”
The executive government is vested in the Queen.
The Queen cannot act in person. She, therefore, by
her governor-general, appoints officers to administer
departments of state. Is not that exactly expressing
the real theory of government —the head of the
state, through her officers, administering departments
of state? The common name by which they are
called is “ministers of the Crown,” and because
they hold office during pleasure, which pleasure
is exercised nominally by the head of the state,
but in reality by parliament, they are called res-
ponsible, because, if their conduct is such as not
to give satisfaction, they have to answer for it by
going out of office. The whole theory of responsibility
is contained in clauses 1 and 4. To say that they
shall be called ministers of the Crown would m t
make them so more than they are already. The
powers of officers are not vested in them because
they are called responsible ministers, but because
they are ministers, and the decision of the Supreme
Court of Victoria, as I understood it, was that the
Constitution of Victoria did not confer upon the
colonial ministers of state the same powers as are
held under the English Constitution by the English
ministers.
Mr. Gillies : Nor do any of the other Australian
constitutions !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: No.
Mr. Deakin : Does this, in the hon. member’s
opinion, convey it ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I do not know any
other form of words that would convey it more
clearly. The Queen is the head; she appoints dif-
ferent ministers of state, and they are responsible,
and we define the extent of the executive power
which they are to administer. What more could
there be ? I think it is absolutely complete.
Sir JOHN BRAY : I think that there is a
deal in the suggestion thrown out by the hon. and
learned member, Mr. VVrixon. The officers are
meant to be called “ ministers of the Crown,” and
no doubt the hon. and learned member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, intended to provide for it; but Ido not
think that the clause does provide for it. “ For the
administration of the executive government of the
commonwealth” —that is what they are appointed for.
Mr. AVrixon : They are heads of departments !


Sir JOHN BEAY: Not to administer the govern-
ment as provided by this constitution ; but they are
appointed to administer certain departments of state,
and the question might arise whether they were really
responsible ministers or simply officers administering
such departments of the state as the governor-in-
council may from time to time establish. It is true
that the clause goes on to say that they shall be mem-
bers of the executive council, and I think it is as right
to assume that as to assume that they are responsible
ministers of the Crown. lam quite willing in any
way to assist the hon. member to carry out the idea
that prompted the drafting of the bill, so as to make
it read properly ; but I do say that we ought to
provide that they shall be something more than
officers administering departments of state. They
will be officers administering the entire government
of Australia.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Clause 4 begins with those
very words !
Sir JOHN BE AY :
For the administration of the executive government of the
commonwealth the governor-general may from time to time
appoint
officers, not to administer the executive government,
but to administer certain departments of state. Each
minister when appointed is responsible for the
administration of a certain department; but there is
nothing in the clause to indicate that ministers are to
administer the entire government of the common-
wealth. I think that in order to make the meaning
clear we ought to insert the words proposed by the
hon. member, Mr. Wrixon.
Mr. CLAEK : I think that both the hon. members,
Sir John Bray and Mr. Wrixon, have been officers of
state in their respective colonies, and have been
in the position of responsible officers of the
Crown. I would ask them to consider, when they
held office, what made them responsible ministers ?
Was it the fact that in one case the hon. member
was administering the Treasury department, and
in the other case the Attorney-General’s depart-
ment ; or was it not the fact that in addition to being
officers of state they were also members of the execu-
tive council ? That is what made them responsible
ministers. If the officers under the commonwealth
are both officers appointed to administer departments
of state and also members of the executive council
they will be in the exact position that both hon.
members have been in in their respective colonies
when they have been called responsible ministers,
and nothing else which can bo put in the bill can
make them more so.
Mr. HEAKIN : I wish to point out to the hon.
member, Mr. Clark, that he has not, in my opinion,
exhausted the situation by the definition he has given.
He has brought to his aid all that part of the clause
which would render these ministers the heads of de-
partments, and the other part which makes them also
members of the executive council. But there are
two points to be considered in that connection. First
of all, in Victoria a man remains an executive coun-
cillor after he has ceased to be a minister, after he
has ceased to be the head of a department of state.
Mr. Clark : And in Tasmania, too !
Mr. DEAKIN: There is no distinction here be-
tween those who are executive councillors and not
ministers, and those who are executive councillors
ani ministers. And then, in the second place, it
.might bo contended that the authority here given to
the federal executive councillors is an authority which
is vested in them as a whole, sitting in council. It
is a body which advises the governor, and on whose
advice the governor acts ; but it does not clothe the
ministers individually with that power and authority
which ministers in Great Britain possess as respon-
sible ministers of the Crown.
Sir Samuel Griffith : They act as the Queen’s
ministers, and in the Queen’s name !
Mr. DEAKIN: But there are numerous acts in
the administration of departments every day, and
occasionally important acts, which are undertaken
on the authority of a single minister, which do not
necessarily come before the executive council as a
whole.
Mr. Clark : What words in the Victorian Consti-
tution give that power ?
Mr. DEAKIN: We have not the words in our
Constitution.
Mr. Clark : Nor in any other constitution !
Mr. DEAKIN: Nor in any other constitution.
As my hon. colleague, Mr. Wrixon, interjects, it was
held that we were acting illegally because we exer-
cised, and claimed to exercise, such a power.
Mr. Clark : We are all alike !
Mr. DEAKIN : Certainly ; but it is not our desire
that ministers under the commonwealth shall be in
the same position as ministers under colonial consti-
tutions. If there is a doubt as to the authority of
a state minister, there should be no doubt as to the
authority of a minister under this constitution.
Surely it is a reasonable thing to claim. The hon.
member, Sir Samuel Griffith, for instance, in his
statement, which was perfectly clear, proceeded to
construe the words of this clause by very considerable
implications by a knowledge of the system of govern-
ment as we have it, and of its working; and with
that knowledge in his mind, by means of this clause,
he certainly made a consistent statement. But it is
exceedingly dangerous to trust to these implications
which have been challenged in the past, and which may
be challenged in the future on so vital a point as this.
In fact, I do not know any point in the bill which is
more vital than the question whether those whom the
governor calls to his councils to undertake the admin-
istration of the state are really responsible ministers of
the Crown in every sense of the term. In the first
instance, the power of the Crown itself is nowhere
defined, and cannot be defined under this constitution.
It is vast and vague; but all the power which the
Crown exercises, ministers must be able to exercise
when the need arises, and it can scarcely be possible
even in this constitution, excellent as it is in most
respects, to embody all possible contingencies. It is
quite open for ministers of the commonwealth in the
discharge of their duties to undertake actions which
it would be impossible to define within the four
corners of the bill—to undertake actions which it
may be were not departmental actions, which were
outside any department which had been constituted
up to that time; and which, therefore, they had
received no authority from the governor-general to
deal with, and then we should have ministers referred
to this limited and rigid constitution for the title-
deeds of their authority; whereas it would be
indisputable in the same cases in Great Britain that
the Crown had power to meet such contingencies,
and that having such power, the responsible ministers
of the Crown were able to exercise the authority
of the Crown in this very respect. Let the hon.
member choose what words he will—and I am sure
my colleague is no stickler for a particular phrase —
but surely he will admit that just as the powers of
the Crown are vast, vague, and undefined, so are the
powers which responsible ministers are at times re-
quired to exercise. Let him use any form of words he
pleases which will convey to the ministers of the com-
monwealth the same power of acting with that vast and
vague authority, under any and every circumstance,
which is possessed by ministers of the Crown in
Great Britain. Let the hon. member do that,
and he will meet the wishes of my colleague. lam
perfectly certain that if we accept anything less than
this for the ministers of the commonwealth we shall
be failing in our duty, and we shall in a sense even
limit the power of the Crown itself, since we shall
provide no machinery by which it can work out its
will in any particular emergency. Why should we


limit the power of the Crown; why should we limit
the power of the people ; why should we diminish
the authority of ministers of the Crown, who act for
the Crown, and in the name of the people? Why
should we not put in the clause any phrase the hon.
member prefers, so long as it conveys without a
scintilla of doubt to the ministers of the common-
wealth all the powers which are possessed by ministers
of the Crown in Great Britain ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I am trying to get at
the ideas which are underlying the argument of hon.
gentlemen. I confess I have not got at them yet.
The hon. member, Mr, Deakin, talks about the
powers exercised by the ministers of the Crown in
Great Britain. They do not differ in any respect
from the powers exercised by ministers of the Crown
in any other country.
Dr. Cockburn : They are much superior to the
powers of ministers here !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Not in the least.
Mr. Deakin : The powers of our ministers are
limited, and theirs are unlimited!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : What is the power
to be exercised ? The sovereign power of the state.
The head of the state, being one person, cannot do
everything himself. He, therefore, has ministers,
servants nominally of himself, but really of the
people, to do that work for him. They are called
ministers, but it is the power of the head of the state
which is being exercised all the time. What more
words can you use for the purpose of saying that ?
He shall appoint proper officers to do it.
Mr. Deakin : Hear, hear !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: That is what we
have said. The power is vested in the Queen. For
the administration of that power, officers shall be
appointed. What more can you say? Can you go
on and say that when they are appointed they shall
have power to do their duty, or say that they shall
exercise such functions as are usually exercised by
officers of state ? It is all reasoning in a circle.
The officers of state will exercise the functions of
officers of state, and the officers of state are the same
in England as anywhere else. The more you reason
about the matter, the more you will find yourself
getting into a circle, and coming back to your starting
point. What additional power is there ? If the hon.
member will point out any power which can be
exercised by the sovereign authority which is not
expressed by the words, I shall not only be willing,
but anxious to supply the defect. But I cannot see
the defect he is pointing to. He assumes that
English ministers have peculiar and extra powers. I
should like to know what they are ? They exercise
the prerogative powers, of course, and the hon.
gentleman, I think, has confused the argument used
in Victoria as to whether colonial ministers have
power to exercise the. prerogatives of the Queen
with the question whether they have power to
exercise the functions conferred upon them by the
constitution. The argument in the Victorian court
was whether a certain royal prerogative could be
exercised by a colonial government. We cannot
propose by a sweeping provision to say that all the
royal prerogatives shall be exercised by the governor-
general-in-council. That seems to me to be the
nearest to what the hon. member is driving at. If
that is what he means, then it is a question for fair
consideration whether we ought to put such a pro-
vision in the bill. But nothing short of that will
cover all that he has been arguing for.
Mr. DEAKIN; I would say briefly, in answer to
the hon. gentleman, that in the very case to which he
has referred, the Supreme Court of AActoria held
that the words “ responsible minister of the Crown ”
appeared in certain statutes passed by the Victorian
Parliament since the passing of the Constitution;
but that they did not appear in the Constitution Act,
and a majority of the bench declared that if they had
been inserted there they would have made a very great
difference in the way in which they would have
regarded ministerial authority in the colony.
Sir Samuel Griffith : But the Privy Council
said that was wrong !
Mr. DEAKIN : As far as I am acquainted with
their judgment, the Privy Council did not enter
upon that particular issue at all. They have not
even considered the point, to say nothing of giving
an opinion upon it. The judgment, therefore, re-
mains for what it is worth as a judgment of the
Supreme Court. If the words my hon. colleague
desires to introduce had been inserted in the Vic-
torian Constitution Act, the ministers of Victoria
would have had greater power than they now possess.
The words the hon. gentleman has just suggested,
conveying sovereign power to ministers, would be
amply sufficient. Those words should be embodied
in this constitution.
Sir Samuel Griffith: That is to say, that all
the royal prerogatives should be exercised by the
governor-in-council!
Mr. DEAKIN: Exercised by him through his
ministers. Unless that claim be put forward in our
constitution, we shall have taken and be taken to
have accepted something less, and we shall be always
liable to be challenged with having exceeded the
authority of the constitution with which her
Majesty has been pleased to endow us. Why should
we leave the matter open to doubt ? Why should
we leave the ministers of the commonwealth liable
to be challenged in the exercise of their duties to
the people they represent ? Why should we not
now put forward the claim of ministers of the com-
monwealth to act for her Majesty and for the people
of the commonwealth as if they were her Majesty’s
imperial ministers, excepting, of course, in cases
where imperial interests are concerned, which would
necessarily attach to the British Government and
the Imperial Parliament? The hon. member, Sir
Samuel Griffith, seems to have considered a phrase
that would be acceptable, and if, especially after
this debate, we were to fail to adopt some such
words, we shall be taken to have admitted and
accepted at the outset a limited authority which, I
am sure, the commonwealth would never willingly
accept.
Mr. FITZGERALD: I should like to ask Sir
Samuel Griffith whether, in his opinion, the effect of
the insertion of these words would be to enlarge the
scope of either the duties or prerogatives of respon-
sible ministers ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: In my opinion, they
would not; and I think, at the same time, that they
are extraordinary words to put in an act of parlia-
ment. No other words I know of would cover that
for which the hon. member is asking, and it is rather
a singular thing to ask the Imperial Parliament to
do for Australia a thing which it has never done for
itself.
Mr. Deakin : Of course not. They have no
need ; they have a vast reserve of power. Theirs is
an unwritten constitution!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : To ask the Crown in
one short sentence to surrender, in respect to Aus-
tralia, all its prerogatives is rather an extraordinary
thing to do. At this moment I believe no one knows
what they all are. No one could at once enumerate
them all; and hon. members may rely upon this,
that the enumeration would be carefully gone
through, and that if there were one prerogative con-
cerning which there was the slightest doubt—that is,
with regard to its inclusion—parliament would not
pass it, and it would be quite right, too. We might
ask for it; but would it not be a pity to lose the
constitution because one point could not be granted ?
For instance, one of the royal prerogatives is to
declare war. What about that ?


Mr. FitzGerald : That is what the hon. member,
Mr. Deakin, would like !
Mr. Deakin : No, I would declare peace !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: The mere mention
of that one instance is sufficient to show that such
sweeping words cannot be inserted.
Mr. Deakin : We can make an exception in favour
of imperial interests. We have no desire to inter-
fere with the imperial prerogative in matters of war
and peace!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I take it that the
proper place for such a clause would be the enacting
part of the bill.
Mr. Deakin : No ; when we are dealing with the
executive government. The governor-general has
power for everything, and delegates it !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: No; in this case
there would be a surrender bj the Queen, which
would have to be in the enacting part of the bill,
■which applies to all the Queen’s dominions.
Mr. FitzGerald : Canada did not ask for it!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : At all events, I would
ask hon. members to pause before they determine
upon asking the Queen to surrender all her prero-
gatives in Australia. For my part, I believe that all
the prerogatives of the Crown exist in the governor-
general as far as they relate to Australia. I never
entertained any doubt upon the subject at all —that
is so far as they can be exercised in the common-
wealth. Certainly the putting in of such a phrase as
has been suggested ought not to be done without
very grave consideration.
Mr. THYNNE : I think the two contending parties
might be reconciled without any material addition to
the clause, but with only a slight rearrangement of
it. I would ask the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith,
to follow me while I read the clause as I propose to
leave it:
The governor-general may, from time to time, appoint such
officers as may be necessary for the administration of the
executive government of the commonwealth. Such officers
shall hold office during the pleasure of the governor-general,
and shall be capable of being chosen and sitting as members
of either house of parliament. Such officers shall be members
of the federal executive council, and shall administer such
departments of state of the commonwealth as the governor-
general-in-council may from time to time establish.
Sir Thomas Mcllwratth : That would not do !
Mr. TH YNNE : As the clause stands it encourages
the idea that ministers are dissociated from the com-
bination to which we are accustomed, and that they
would be appointed to administer certain departments,
but not to generally advise the governor.
Mr. DEAKIN; I trust the question will not be
allowed to pass before the Convention has fully con-
sidered it. The objection of the hon. member, Sir
Samuel Griffith, to the amendment of my hon.
colleague is really an objection to the phrase
“ responsible minister of the Crown.” The hon.
member says it is an “epithet,” but nevertheless it
points in two very valuable directions. It points, in
the first instance, to the exercise by ministers of all
powers in the Crown, and, in the second instance, to
the responsibility of those ministers to parliatnei t for
every action they take in their ministerial capacity.
In both of these respects the phrase, although it may
be called an epithet, is an extremely valuable one.
Why not meet the case by striking out the word
“ officers,” and make the clause read:
The governor-general may from time to time appoint respon-
sible ministers of the Crown.
Sir Henry Parkes : The hon. member would not
find such a phrase in any English law !
Mr. DEAKIN: It is used in a number of our
acts.
Sir Samuel Griffith : It has been used by inad-
vertence in Victoria!
Sir John Downer : Is the hon. member sure the
words are in the Victorian act ?
Mr. DEAKIN: They are not in the Constitution
Act, but they are in several other Victorian acts.
They are not required to be used in Great Britain,
where the constitution is unwritten; but since we
are trying to reduce a constitution to words, since we
are setting down in black and white what the execu-
tive relations of the government are, I think we
should be definite. Complete as is the skeleton of
constitutional government which the hon. member,
Sir Samuel Griffith, has given us in these clauses, I
maintain that it is, after all, only a skeleton, and
that the life which is implied by its being adminis-
tered by responsible ministers has yet to be imparted
to it. We do not desire to introduce words which
might seem to claim for Australia royal preroga-
tives ; but we do wish to introduce words claiming all
the prerogatives of the Crown directly relating to
Australia. What we say is that these clauses, as
they stand, do not with sufficient distinctness make
that claim, and that we should seize every oppor-
tunity of placing points of this importance beyond
all dispute, that we should embody in these clauses
the claim of ministers of the commonwealth to exer-
cise all the prerogatives of the Crown which may be
necessary in the interests of the commonwealth. I
would ask the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, to
himself suggest a phrase, and in default of that to
accept my hon. colleague’s amendment. 1 would
suggest words claiming that as regards the interests
of the commonwealth, ministers of the Crown here
should have the same powers as have ministers of the
Crown in Great Britain, distinguishing Great Britain
of course from the empire at large.
Sir Samuel Griffith ; N o more than the ministers
of France, Germany, or the United States !
Mr. DEAKIN: In Great Britain there is the
peculiarity that, living under an unwritten constitu-
tion, it is never known what new departures may be
taken.
Sir Samuel Griffith: It is absolute power to
administer the sovereignty of the state !
Mr. DEAKIN: Exactly; surely all the limits
that we want of that absolute power in the common-
wealth is, so far as it relates to the commonwealth,
to exclude all prerogatives relating to the empire
outside the commonwealth. There is no pretence to
claiming the power of proclaiming peace or war, or
of exercising power outside our own boundaries ; but
let us have it stated plainly in the constitution that
the officers here, called heads of departments, shall
be absolutely ministers of the Crown. We know
what that means.
Sir Hknry Parkes : That is exactly what we do
not know.
Mr. DE iKTN: And there is this great advantage:
we do not know what the royal prerogative is. We
have not exhausted its meaning. Had we not better
take words which are used in common speech, the
meaning of which we have not exhausted, when we
are all at one in making the claim for the people of
the common wealth that their parliament and ministers
shall have all the powers necessary to administer the
affairs of the commonwealth p No one has argued
for this more strongly than the hon. member, Sir
Samuel Griffith. If he is convinced that the clause
gives that power, while other members of the Com-
mittee are convinced that it does not, would it not
be better to carry out the principle which we have
followed throughout, and let us have no doubt on
the point? Let us make the most explicit, indis-
putable, unmistakable claim to this power.
Sir John Brat : The hon. member’s suggestion
will not do that!
Mr. DEAKIN: By calling these officers respon-
sible ministers of the Crown, they will be empowered
to meet all unanticipated contingencies.
Sir Samuel Griffith : The words do not convey
that meaning to my mind!


Mr. D KARIN": They did to the Supreme Court of
Victoria. We had a number of judges stating that if
these words were contained in the Constitution Act
of Victoria they would adopt a different attitude,
and hold that ministers had greater power than they
now have, those words not being in our Constitution
Act. Why not employ those words in this constitu-
tion, and place our meaning beyond doubt ?
Sir SAMUEL GKIFFiTH : It is difficult to
know what is our meaning which it is desired to put
beyond doubt. I agree that in this bill our meaning
should be placed beyond doubt, but we must first
find out what is our meaning. The hon. member
uses the word “ responsible,” which simply means
this : that ministers take the brunt of the advice
which they give in the exercise of sovereign
power of any kind. That does not give them
any additional power. The word “ responsible ”
only means in that case that the ministers take the
blame. It is not a question of giving authority, it is
a question as to who is to be punished for the im-
proper exercise of authority. The word “ministers ”
means no more than “ officers of state.” It is only
another epithet. Ministers of the Crown means
officers of the Crown where there is a Crown.
Mr. Deakin : The words mean something more
than that!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : The argument is be-
coming so refined that it is impossible to distinguish
the differences.
Sir John Beat : You do not call them officers of
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Clause 4 says that,
for the administration of the executive government,
there shall be officers to administer such departments
of state as the governor may prescribe, and he is to
act on their advice. These are expressions that have
been used so often that they have become stereo-
typed ; but I think the only authority for using in
an act the words “ responsible ministers of the
Crown ” is an error on the part of a draftsman in
Victoria. It has not been followed by any of the
other colonies. In some customs act somebody or
other used the words “ responsible minister,” and
the Victorian judges thought that, having been so
used, there was something defective in the Constitu-
tion Act. I do not draw that inference ; I think that
the defect was in the subsequent Act.
Mr. WRIXON: I am convinced that the Con-
vention is making a serious mistake. We are asked
to pass this clause in exactly the same terms that
would suit a Crown colony. Every word in this clause
would apply equally to ministers and officers in a
Crown colony which was about to be founded. I
would be happy if any better phrase could be ob-
tained than 1 have suggested. 1 think these amend-
ments should be drawn up by the gentleman in charge
of the bill. The words “ responsible ministers of the
Crown ” were used in Victoria, not as the hon. mem-
ber, tSir Samuel Griffith, thinks, by mistake, but are
used repeatedly, and I think most justly, because no
principle is better understood than that the courts
take judicial notice of all things —mercantile, political,
and so on. And the political meaning, under the
Constitution of England, of “ responsible minister of
the Crown,” is perfectly well known. What is
desired is this : that a minister in Australia shall have
the same position with regard to the Crown, in all
matters Australian, as a minister in England has with
regard to all matters English. We desire to have
that object carried out. I am sorry the Convention
does not attend to it, because I am sure we are
making a mistake.
Mr. KINGSTON: We are very much indebted to
the hon. member, Mr. Wrixon, for calling attention
to this matter. There is no hon. member who has
had more practical experience, in view of recent
events, of the necessity,for making some provision of
this kind. His attention has been drawn to the
matter by the litigation which has lately taken place
on a very nice constitutional question. A decision
was pronounced by some, at least, of the Victorian
judges which forms the position for which the hon.
member contends, namely, that it is necessary to make
an amendment in the bill in order to give ministers
of the Crown in Australia certain prerogative rights
which arc exercised by ministers in England for the
benefit of the community. When we are legislating
for the creatiou of a constitution for the common-
wealth which we hope to establish here, we should
at least profit by the experience of past years in
order to clothe the officers of the commonwealth with
all the powers which may happen to be necessary for
the preservation of the rights of the community.
There is no more important power than the one
which was in issue in the litigation to which I have
referred ; that is, the right of the representatives
of the executive ministers to act without recourse
to parliamentary authority in order to prevent
aliens from effecting a landing on our shores. We
should render ourselves liable to be accused of
negligence if we did not make every effort to see that
this question was perfectly clear, so that in future
we should have the power which was questioned
in connection with the late litigation, and which
at present there is some doubt whether the colonial
governments possess. We have the decision of some
at least of the Victorian judges that the power is not
possessed by Victorian ministers ; but that if certain
phraseology had been employed, they would possess
the power. We do not know to what extent that
decision may have been qualified by the judgment of
the Privy Council; but it seems from the telegrams
that it is doubtful as to whether or not that decision
has in any respect been qualified. There is some
room for objection to the employment of the word
"responsible." We know what we wish to do. We
desire to confer on the executive ministers the right
to exercise this prerogative as far as the common-
wealth is concerned ; but I do not think we desire
to expressly perpetuate the system of responsible
government. I am certainly an advocate for the
continuance of that system ; but in view of the dis-
cussion which took place at a previous stage, I think
we have done well hitherto in avoiding the use of the
term " responsible," in avoiding the use of any
expression which it might be urged would have the
effect of preventing us from altering our practice
with reference to responsible government in future
as occasion may require. I hope the hon. member
who has moved the amendment will leave out the
word to which I have referred, and to which it seems
that objection can fairly be taken. At the same
time, I will promise him that I will do all I can to
assist him in achieving the object which he has in
view in a manner which will not be open to the
objections which I have urged. It occurs to me
that something of the sort might be done if we
amended section 1 on page 17, which vests
the executive power and authority of the common-
wealth in the Queen, to be exercised by the
governor-general. Possibly some words might be
inserted to show that that executive power and
authority which would be exercised by her Majesty's
representative under the advice of a responsible
ministry would extend to the exercise of the prero-
gative which it is now desired to confer; but at the
same time I sympathise with the remark made by
various hon. members that it is a very delicate ques-
tion. We should look very closely at the way in
which we make any amendment on the subject. The
object in view is one which I am convinced we ought
to strain every nerve to achieve, and I shall be glad,
indeed, if the hoD. member who moved the amend-
ment can arrange with the hon. and learned member,
Sir Samuel Griffith, for some satisfactory mode of
effecting what I believe to be a purpose which will
commend itself to all.


Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I have been all along
trying to meet my lion, friends for the purpose of
removing any doubt. A form of words has occurred
to me since I spoke last, which I believe would
relievo the minds of hon. members, and does not
appear open to any objection. I would propose to
add to the clause the words “ and shall be the
Queen’s ministers of state for the commonwealth.”
I would suggest that the hon. and learned member
should withdraw his amendment.
Mr. WRIXON : I shall be happy to withdraw my
amendment, as I think that the addition to the
clause of the words suggested by the hon. and learned
member will adequately carry out what I desire.
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
Amendment (by Sir Samuel Griffith) agreed to:
That the words “and shall be the Queen’s ministers of
state for the commonwealth ” be added to the clause.
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
Clause 6. There shall be payable to the Queen out of the
consolidated revenue fund of the commonwealth for the
salaries of such officers a sum nob less than fifteen thousand
pounds per annum.
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS : I would ask the hon,
and learned member, Sir Samuel Griffith, whether it
was intended that the £15,000 should be divided
among the Ministers of the Crown, however few
they might be ? There might be only three.
Mr, Munro : If they do the work, why should
they not get the money ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I think there ought
to be power to control that. We contemplate seven
ministers being required at the start, but the parlia-
ment will settle how many ministers there shall be.
I think it would be better if this were not made a
rigid provision of the constitution.
Sir John Brat : The clause says, “ not less than
£15,000.”
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Why should the par-
liament not have power to reduce the amount? I
think it would be better if the operation of this
clause were limited in the same manner as the next
one. It is clearly a matter for the parliament, the
provision being an initial one.
Amendment (by Sir Samuel Griffith) agreed to :
That the following words be inserted before the word
“ There,” line 1 : —“ Until other provision is made by
the parliament.
Mr. J. FORREST : I should like to ask the hon.
member whether he proposes that the salaries of
ministers of the Crown should be altered by parlia-
ment at any time it chooses, that is, that during any
session any member shall be at liberty to move a
reduction in the ministers’ salaries p That would be
a provision not usual in the constitutions with which
I have had anything to do. It should only be done
by an alteration of the constitution. If there is a civil
list it can only be altered in the way providedfor amend-
ing the constitution. If ministers’ salaries are to be
altered at any time great power will be placed in the
hands of members, and they may annoy ministers by
having a great controversy every time the ministerial
salaries come under review. The clause says that the
amount for ministers’ salaries shall not be less than
£15,000. Personally, I do not care what the amount
is; but it seems to me that ministers of the Crown
should not be subjected to the indignity, every time
an appropriation act is before parliament, of having
their salaries discussed in the assembly. In the colony
which I represent, it is as difficult to touch the civil
list as it is to alter any other part of the constitution.
Mr. HARMIO N : I have not had experience of the
voting of large sums of money, but I have some idea
in regard to the credit that should attach to a minister
of the Crown ; and when we are building up a fabric
which is intended to be a lasting structure, and of
which the foundations shall be strong and durable, we
ought to be careful how we deal with this matter. I
agree with my colleague in saying that it would bo a
pity if parliament should have the power, without
considerable trouble, to alter the salaries of ministers,
and could bring them under discussion every year. It
seems to me to be rather discreditable, and, to a cer-
tain extent, to take away from the dignity which
surrounds the position. I dare say the committee,
after considerable attention to the matter, arrived at
the conclusion that £15,000 per annum was little
enough to enable the ministers to maintain their
high positions; and after the amount has been
arrived at, it seems to me that there should be a great
deal of difficulty surrounding its reduction, though
there should still be the power to increase it.
Mr. A. Forrest: No doubt.
Mr. MARMION: lam afraid the hon. member is
rather inclined to regard these things from a narrow-
minded point of view, but I have been accustomed to
look at them from a higher standpoint, and to think of
the future as well as of the present. Remembering
that in the future the responsibility and power of these
ministers may be largely increased, and that instead
of ruling over 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 people, they
may rule over 20,000,000, I say that the difficulties
surrounding the alteration of their salaries should
be made as great as possible, and I agree with my
hon. colleague that it would be a pity if any amend-
ment should be made in the clause.
Amendment (by Sir Samuel Griffith) agreed to:
That the words “ a sum not less than” be omitted with a
view to the insertion in lieu thereof of the words “ the
sum of,”
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
Clause 8. The executive power and authority of the com-
monwealth shall extend to all matters with respect to which
the legislative powers of the parliament may be exercised,
excepting only matters, being within the legislative powers
of a state, with respect to which the parliament of that
state for the time-being exercises such powers.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: This afternoon I have
had circulated an amendment which I propose to
make in this clause. It does not alter its intention,
though it certainly makes it shorter. As the clause
stands, it contains a negative limitation upon tho
powers of the executive; but the amendment will
give a positive statement as to what they are to bo.
I move:
That in line 2 all the words after the words “ extend to”
be omitted with a view to the insertion in lieu thereof
of the words “ the execution of the provisions of this
constitution, and the laws of the commonwealth.”
That amendment covers all that is meant by tho
clause, and is quite free from ambiguity.
Amendment agreed to ; clause, as amended, agreed
to.
Clause 10. The control of the following departments of tho
public service shall be at once assigned to and assumed and
taken over by the executive government of the common-
wealth, and the commonwealth shall assume the obligations
of all or any state or states with respect to such matters,
that is to say —
Customs and excise,
Posts and telegraphs,
Military and naval defence,
Ocean beacons and buoys, and ocean lighthouses and
lightships,
Quarantine.
Mr. WRIXON : I have been favoured with certain
suggestions with regard to the bill by my learned
friend, the Attorney-General of Victoria. These
have been laid before the hon, member, Sir Samuel
Griffith. One of them deals with this clause, and I
wish to ask the hon. member if he has considered the
point raised, and whether he is of opinion that the
clause sufficiently meets the objection of my hon.
friend ?
Sir Samuel Griffith : Will the hon. member
state the objection to the Committee ?
Mr. WRIXON : I shall be very happy. This
clause hands over to the federalgovcrnment a num-
ber of departments —customs and excise, post and


tel egraphs, military and naval defence, and others. The
Attorney-General of Victoria has pointed out that
our Customs Department includes a great many
other things, as, for example, the Immigration Office,
the Mercantile Marine Office, the Powder Magazine
Office, the Fisheries Department, and the Marine
Board, and he desires to know whether it is intended
under the bill to take over the whole of these from
the operation of the local government, or whether
the general government are to be strictly confined to
customs and excise ? That is the difficulty Avhich he
raised
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: It seems to me that
the meaning is pretty plain. The clause says the
commonwealth shall assume the obligations of any
state “ with respect to customs and excise.” If, in a
coastal town, the customs-house officer is pilot or
lighthouse-keeper as well, it will not take over those
functions.
Mr. GILLIES: The same remark would apply to
the posts and telegraphs, which include other depart-
ments, I do not see that it is possible, under the
clause, for the federal government to take over such
departments. They would have to be specifically
mentioned before they could be included in the obli-
gations of the commonwealth.
Mr. FITZGERALD: Is it understood that the
state governments will entirely surrender control of
country post-offices, delivery of mails, and everything
connected with the postal service?
Mr. Platford ; Yes !
Mr. Adte Douglas ; Absurd !
Mr. BAKER: Before the question is put, I would
ask if the Committee have considered the question of
telephones ? Of course, it is not a very important
matter; but the telephones are worked by the same
staff as the telegraphs, and if the central government
took over the telegraphs, and the local governments
retained the telephones, they would have to establish
new departments.
Mr. Gillies : Telegraphs include telephones !
Mr. BAKER: Of course, if the word “department”
governs the words “posts and telegraphs,” and tele-
phones are included, I am quite satisfied.
Mr. AD YE DOUGLAS: This clause gives over
to the general government the whole of the depart-
ments mentioned, before the federal parliament
comes into existence. It seems to me that it is
undesirable to hand over the whole of our post and
telegraph departments, which in the colony I repre-
sent include other departments, to the federal
government. That ought not to be done until the
parliament properly arranges matters, and carries
them out in accordance with the provisions of clause
52, which deals with the powers of parliament. All
these powers are handed over to the executive
government at once. It seems to me to be sufficient
to hand over to the executive government the cus-
toms and excise departments, leaving the other
departments to remain until parliament meets, when
the several states will have had the opportunity of
separating departments affecting telephones, stamps,
and so on, from the other departments with which
they are connected.
Sir Samuel Griffith : They will do that before
in anticipation!
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS: It is not likely that
they will do it until they know exactly how far the
commonwealth parliament intends to operate upon
these matters. The expressions used are of a general
nature, and there may be taken over a great deal
more than we intend to *be taken over. Therefore I
think it would be as well to omit the words “ posts
and telegraphs ” from the clause. Military and
naval defence matters are not of so much importance.
Matters relating to ocean beacons and buoys, and
03ean lighthouses and lightships, however, are in the
same position as posts and telegraphs. In Victoria
and Tasmania these matters are connected with
different departments ; therefore I think it would be
well to limit the immediate assumption of control to
matters affecting customs and excise, and military
and naval defence.
Amendment (Sir Samuel Griffith) agreed to :
That in line 5, the words “ all or ” be omitted.
Amendment (Mr, Adte Douglas) negatived:
That in line 8, the words “ Posts and telegraphs ” be
omitted.
Amendment (by Mr. Adte Douglas) negatived:
That in lines 10 and 11, the words “Ocean beacons and
buoys, and ocean lighthouses and lightships,” be
omitted.
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
Clause 11, All powers and functions which are at the
date of the establishment of the commonwealth vested in
the governor of a colony with or without the advice of his
executive council, or in any officer or person in a colony,
shall, so far as the same continue in existence and need to 5
be exercised in relation to the government of the common-
wealth, with respect to any matters which under this
constitution pass to the executive government of the
commonwealth, vest in the governor-general, with the
advice of the federal executive council, or in the officer 10
exercising similar powers or functions in or under the
executive government of the commonwealth.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I understood that the
hou. member, Mr. Wrixon, intended calling atten-
tion to this matter. Amongst the memoranda with
which that hon. gentleman has favoured me, made by
Mr. Shiels, it is pointed out that in some instances
power is vested, not in an individual, but in a board.
For instance, matters affecting ocean lighthouses are
dealt with by marine boards, I therefore move:
That in line 4, the word “person”be omitted with the view
to the insertion of the word “authority.”
Amendment agreed to.
Amendment (by Sir Samuel Griffith) agreed to:
That in line 10, after the word “officer,” the words “or
authority” be inserted.
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
CHAPTER 111. —THE FEDERAL JUDICATURE.
Clause 1. The parliament of the commonwealth shall have
power to establish a court, which shall be called the Supreme
Court of Australia, and shall consist of a chief justice, and so
many other justices, not less than four, as the parliament
from time to time prescribes. The parliament may also from
time to time, subject to the provisions of this constitution,
establish other courts.
Mr. KINGSTON: At an earlier stage in tbe
discussion of this bill I withdrew an amendment
which I then moved in favour of giving legislative
powers to the federal parliament for the establish-
ment of courts of conciliation and arbitration. I did
this because it was pointed out by the hon. member,
Sir Samuel Griffith, that it would be more convenient
to effect au} r amendment the Convention might desire
in the clause which wo are now discussing, dealing
with the federal judicature. I propose to move now
the addition of words to this particular clause, which
will give the federal parliament power to establish
federal courts of conciliation and arbitration for the
settlement of industrial disputes. The amendment I
desire to make consists in the addition to the clause
of the following words :
. including courts of conciliation and arbitration for the
settlement of industrial disputes.
I am not going to travel over ground upon which I
have previously touched. This simple fact remains—
that in view of the extent of the organisations which
take part in these industrial disputes, having ramifi-
cations throughout the whole of Australia, it is im-
possible for any one colony to legislate for the crea-
tion of a tribunal which can deal satisfactorily with
them. Under these circumstances, it resolves itself
into this question : whether we shall sit idly by and
allow the contending parties to settle the matter for
themselves, disregarding the disastrous results which
invariably accrue from the prolongation of these


disputes ; or whether wo shall do what we can for the
purpose of creating facilities by which these disputes
may be avoided or their duration shortened ? I do
not think it possible for the question to be answered
in any other w ay than by a recognition of the duty
which it appears to me is imposed on us in the crea-
tion of this constitution to make provision for the
erection of courts which will satisfactorily deal with
questions of the magnitude of those involved in indus-
trial disputes. A federal judicature is proposed
to be created. Various branches of jurisdiction
will no doubt bo conferred upon it; but I make
bold to say that there is no more important branch
of jurisdiction which can be given to it than the
necessary jurisdiction for the investigation of troubles
of the character to which I refer, and their decision,
according to the substantial justice of the case. At
the present moment various schemes are occupying
the attention of the different local legislatures having
for their aim the supply of facilities for the preven-
tion of these disputes ; but I am sure that every one
who has felt it his duty to consider the question will
recognise the force of the argument, that local legis-
lation cannot satisfactorily deal with the question.
I do not propose at this stage to indicate on what
lines I venture to consider legislation should pro-
ceed ; but I think that if at the time of the late
labour troubles we had had something in the shape
of a federal tribunal, having the confidence of entire
Australia, having for its sanction Australian legisla-
tion, public sentiment would have been of such a
character that the disputing parties wmuld practically
have been forced to refer their disagreement to this
tribunal for settlement, and to abide by the result.
All I ask in submitting this amendment to the notice
of the Convention is this; that we may recognise
that it is a question with which the federal parliament
should have powmr to deal. If we do not take the
powmr now, it can only be obtained by an amendment of
the constitution. Surely it is a power which should
exist, however much room there may be for difference
of opinion as to the precise way in which it should be
exercised. I merely refer in the amendment I move
to the establishment of courts of conciliation and
arbitration. The first duty of the proposed tribunal
would no doubt be to endeavour to reconcile the
parties. The second would be, in default of success
in the endeavour to bring about a reconciliation
between the contending parties, to pronounce a
decision according to the justice of the case, which
decision should bind the contending parties for a
limited period, and which should be capable of
enforcement. Courts of conciliation and arbitration
appear to me to be highly desirable of establishment
in view of the matters to which I have called atten-
tion, and it is with the sole purpose of enabling the
federal legislature, when it sees fit and in such mode
as it deems most expedient, to call these tribunals
into existence that I move this amendment.
Amendment proposed.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I should like for my
own satisfaction, before voting on this question, to
know how the hon. gentleman makes out that his
amendment is not an interference with property and
civil rights ? That is the difficulty I feel. If courts
of conciliation can be established, if anything can bo
done to settle Inbour disputes, I think it is a power
the federal parliament might very w r ell have. But I
have been trying for the last three months to see how
it could be put within their function 'without inter-
fering with the proper function of the states, and I
have not been able yet to answer that question.
Mr. DEAKIN : The hon. member, perhaps, might
answer another difficulty which has suggested itself
to me. I am cordially with him in all he desires to
accomplish, and believe that much could be achieved
in this direction by such legislation as he has out-
lined ; but I fail to see that it can possibly become,
for a very long time to come, a proper subject for
federal legislation. On the contrary, I fear that if
this power were given to the federal legislature, it
might he exercised less satisfactorily than it would he
hy the individual colonies. There must he in such a
matter as this, a certain amount of experimental
legislation. The colonies, left to themselves, may
take different, and, to some extent, diverse paths;
and from the knowledge then gained, the federal
parliament may legislate in the future. The hon.
member’s amendment, I take it, would not prevent
the exercise hy the several colonies of their present
power of legislation on this question.
Mr. Gillies : It would!
Mr. Kingston: Not at all!
Mr. DEAKIN : I imagine that the bestow al of this
power on the federal parliament would not operate to
the exclusion of the pow T cr at present possessed hy
the several colonies, until the federal parliament
did actually legislate. If this provision would
operate as a prohibition to the local parliaments I
should be compelled to vote against it. But I think
it simply gives the power to the federal parliament
in the future, and possibly there cannot he much
objection to that, unless it be on the ground sug-
gested by the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith. I
certainly think we should do something to prevent or
even discourage the several colonies from dealing
with this problem each in its own way, because only
after the path has been trodden by the several
colonies, and trodden in different ways, will it bo
probable that the federal parliament will ever bo
moved to bring into existence so immense an organi-
sation as would be necessary to cope with the indus-
trial disputes of Australia.
Mr. DIBBS : I think the idea of the mover of the
amendment is to give power to the federal parlia-
ment to establish such courts. Long before federa-
tion would become an accomplished fact conciliation
courts would, no doubt, be established in the various
colonies, or at least some of them would have
attempted to legislate with a view to a settlement of
the question. Already the subject has been intro-
duced into the Parliament of New South Wales and
favourably received, and the hon. member, Mr. Kings-
ton, has, 1 believe, introduced it into the Parliament of
South Australia ; and I have no doubt that when the
minds of the people are brought to bear on the
advantages of conciliation, legislation will be passed
in various colonies which will pave the way to a law
of conciliation being ultimately passed by the federal
parliament. I see no harm in the insertion of words
giving the federal parliament power to establish such
courts if it thinks necessary.
Mr. KINGSTON : Referring to the remark which
fell from Sir Samuel Griffith, if I understand the hon.
gentleman rightly, his objection is to the establish-
ment of any court of conciliation or arbitration.
Sir Samuel Griffith : No !
Mr. KINGSTON : Then I fail to comprehend the
argument of the hon. delegate. I understand him to
say that the establishment of these courts by the
federal legislature wmuld bo an interference with
civil rights.
Sir Samuel Griffith : With property and civil
rights !
Mr. KINGSTON: Does the hon. delegate object
to it on the ground that state matters should be regu-
lated by the states themselves P
Sir Samuel Griffith : Certainly; property and
civil rights are left to the states!
Mr, KINGSTON: Then I understand that the
objection of the hon. delegate is not as to the propriety
of the establishment of courts of conciliation and
arbitration; but as to the expediency of leaving
these matters to be dealt with by the states them-
selves.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Yes, that is the point
which I take.


Mr. KINGSTON: The position that I ventured
to take was that the states could not deal with these
questions to the extent of the creation of a federal
tribunal—could not deal wdth them to the extent of
calling into existence a court competent to pronounce
a decision having force not only in the particular
state, but also throughout the commonwealth; and,
taking, as I believe I am justified in taking, the hon.
member’s argument to amount to this—that he
admits the propriety of legislation on the subject,
but thinks the authority to legislate should be con-
fined to the states themselves —I venture to say that
it is wanting in force, because he does not recognise
the strength of the position that the states have no
powder to legislate for the creation of a federal
tribunal. With reference to the remarks of the hon.
delegate from Victoria, Mr. Deakin, if I thought
that the amendment which I indicate would prevent
the states from legislating within their own boun-
daries or that it w r ould affect the free exercise of
their powers within their limits with regard to the
creation of tribunals of this sort, I w r ould not for a
moment dream of moving the amendment; but it
cannot have any such effect, and I am sure that the
hon. member will see it. The amendment I moved
does not place even the same restriction which, as
regards a great variety of subjects, is placed upon
the action of the states in matters of very considerable
moment. There are cases in which the commonwealth
and the state will have concurrent powers of legisla-
tion. Even in those cases it will be necessary to any
restriction of the state rights that the federal power
shall be exercised ; but in this case it is not a question
of concurrent legislative powers. The state has no
power whatever for the creation of a federal tribunal,
and with the view of giving the federal parliament
a pow T er which otherwise neither commonwealth
and state will possess I ask the Convention to
consent to the amendment. No doubt a variety
of arguments might be advanced as to the mode
in which federal legislation should proceed—as to
the precise direction which it should take—as to
the details of the scheme that would commend
itself to the good sense of the federal parliament,
but having listened to the criticisms to which my sug-
gestion has been subjected, I confess that I cannot see
any valid reason why the federal parliament should
net have the power to deal with the question. Why
should we at this early stage in the constitution of
the commonwealth resist the proposal to give the
parliament authority to deal with it when the occasion
arises, and when a scheme is propounded which will
commend itself to the good sense of the majority P
Mr. Gillies : Does this amendment give the par-
liament that power ?
Mr. KINGSTON : The amendment which I now*
propose would give the federal parliament the power
of legislating with reference to the establishment of
courts of conciliation and arbitration iu such a way
as they think fit.
Mr. Gillies : In what clause?
Mr. KINGSTON: The clause now under consider-
ation. As I have previously pointed out, I move the
amendment at this stage of the bill, as no doubt the
judicature, if created, would have most important
functions. If we do not assent to an amendment of
the chai’acter now indicated, the federal parliament,
shortly after its constitution, might be desirous of
dealing wnth this question, and a scheme might be
propounded which commended itself to the good sense
of a large majority of both houses, but it w r ould be
utterly powerless. It could do nothing, and the states
themselves would be similarly situated. Under these
circumstances it does appear to me that the force of
the arguments is altogether in favour of giving the
power, however much the federal parliamennt may
deliberate, and whatever room for difference of
opinion there maybe as to the precise way in which
it should subsequently be exercised.
Mr. GILLIES : I should like to have the atten-
tion of the hon. and learned member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, for a minute. There is a proposal made
here that the parliament should be able to establish
certain courts, and that these courts shall be able to
deal with laws having reference to conciliation and
arbitration. I want to know if, iu the event of these
words being added, there is in the bill any power
given to the parliament to deal with this subject ?
Sir Samuel Griffith : I do not quite understand
the hon. member’s question !
Mr. GILLIES : In this bill we have dealt with a
series of provisions giving the parliament of the
commonwealth power to deal with certain questions ;
but this question is not included. I desire to know
whether merely giving the courts of law power to
deal with a question of this kind necessarily involves
the power of the legislature to legislate on the
subject ?
Mr. EITZGERALD : I should like to supplement
the remarks of the hon. member, Mr. Gillies:
Suppose the federal court gave a decision which was
at variance with that of the courts of the various
states, which would rule ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : The question which
the hon. member, Mr. FitzGerald, asks is rather a
difficult one to answer. In America the supreme
court in each state is supreme in its own limits, and
so is the federal supreme court supreme in its
limits, and the same point might be decided in two
different ways, and both decisions be executed in the
same state. In reply to the hon. member, Mr.
Gillies, I think that the last paragraph in clause 52
would give the legislature power to legislate on the
subject. The words are :
Any matters necessary or incidental for carrying into execu-
tion the foregoing powers, and any other powers vested by this
constitution in the parliament or executive government of the
commonwealth.
That leads me to another question—how would the
decision of a court of conciliation be carried out ?
Mr. Gillies : That is a question for the act
itself!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I confess I feel very
great doubt whether the provision should or should
not be put in here. I do not think the hon. member,
Mr. Kingston, has removed the difficulty that I felt
as to its being an interference w r ith property and
civil rights. Does the hon. member mean that a
court of conciliation might direct that the W'ages of
workmen should be raised ?
Mr. Kingston : That is a question of detail!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: It is a question of
principle. Does the hon. member mean matters of
principle like that, because that might entirely
depreciate the value of property in a state, or drive
an industry out of a state? From that point of
view, my vote will be determined in the matter. I
think, much as I desire to get this power for the
federal parliament, that we ought to hold fast by the
principle that we are not going to interfere with the
rights of property in the states.
Mr. GILLIES : I would suggest to the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. Kingston, that it would be wise to await
the result, and to see whether the colonies themselves
could not do something. I can quite understand
the hon. member’s difficulty, and have appreciated
it for a long time. The labour question is not a
question that belongs merely to any one colony; but,
as we have had experience, it permeates all the colonies,
and a movement originating in one colony is made
disastrous in its effect, not only in that colony, but
in all the other colonies. It would be w r ise, if pos-
sible, to induce all the colonies to come to an under-
standing on the subject with reference to the
framing of a law which would bo fair to all parties.
If the hon. member will leave the question a
little longer, with the view of enabling the
various governments to come to some conclusion,


then they might refer it to the federal parlia-
ment. Under the bill they would have power to
refer the question to the federal parliament to
deal with, probably on lines which they might
be able to suggest. But I do not believe that in
the first instance the federal parliament would be
likely, in consequence of the inherent difficulty of
the subject, to deal with it without being first advised
by the various legislatures, or, at any rate, by
the various colonies. • The question is full of diffi-
culties ; the lion, gentleman acknowledges that him-
self, and I think he would do well to leave it for some
little time to the state governments to endeavour
to consider the matter among themselves, and to see,
in the event of their not being able to legislate
unitedly, whether they might not refer the question
to the federal parliament.
Mr. PLAYFORD : In a case of this sort, if the
insertion of the words can do no harm, and they may
do good, why should we hesitate to insert them ?
We all admit, I imagine, that these industrial
troubles do not belong to one colony alone. Labour
has federated, and capital has federated, throughout
the colonies, and the experience of the late strike
shows most unmistakeably, or, at all events, shows us
in South Australia, that a strike may be ordered
from New South Wales, and that our people will
obey the order; but that as far as our local laws are
concerned, we are practically powerless to deal with
the question. We all admit, therefore, that the
subject, if dealt with at all, will have to be dealt
with by the parliament of the commonwealth. Until
the parliament of the commonwealth deals with the
subject, the states are not prevented in any w r ay
from dealing with it. lam quite certain that the
parliament of the commonwealth w r ill not take any
action until public opinion throughout the colonies
begins to call upon them to make a law upon the
subject, and to endeavour as far as possible to settle
these disputes without the loss that is always
occasioned to both sides by a strike. The object will
be to prevent the possibility of strike in the future,
as far as we possibly can. There will be no harm
whatever in inserting the words which the hon.
member proposes. It is one of those provisions
which will not be exercised until the voice of the
community demands that it shall be. For these
reasons I shall cheerfully support the amendment.
Mr. KINGSTON: The hon. member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, asked me if I proposed that the courts of
arbitration and conciliation should have power to
decide the rate of wages. Ido not propose anything
of the sort, for I do not propose any details as
regards the powers which should be conferred upon
the courts. I think that a question of the sort Sir
Samuel Griffith asks could be put with equal force
for the purpose of securing the rejection of many
clauses in the bill. The power is given, for instance,
to the federal parliament to legislate in such matters
as marriage and divorce. Surely the hon. member
might, with the same propriety, ask in what direction
it is intended by those responsible for the appearance
of that provision in the bill that legislation on those
subjects should proceed. That matter will be
discussed, no doubt, and decided by the federal par-
liament when the necessity arises. The simple ques-
tion now is: shall the federal parliament have power
to deal with this question? It is admitted that a
power of this kind cannot be exercised by the states.
A suggestion is made that the subject may be
referred to them in the roundabout way which is
proposed in another section of the bill. Why not, if
we recognise the necessity of doing something, give
the absolute power within the four corners of the
bill a power which, of course, will only be exercised
with that discretion which the federal parliament
will naturally be supposed to possess, and which will
not be exercised "before Australian sentiment is ripe
for legislation on the subject ?

Question so resolved in the negative.
Clause, as read, agreed to.
Clause 6. Notwithstanding the provisions of the two last
preceding sections, or of any law made by the parliament of
the commonwealth in pursuance thereof, the Queen may in
any case in which the public interests of the commonwealth,
or of any state, or of any other part of the Queen’s dominions,
are concerned, grant leave to appeal to herself in council
against any judgment of the Supreme Court of Australia.
Mr. WBIXON: I beg to move:
That the clause be amended by the omission of the words
“in which the public interests of the commonwealth, or of
any state, or of any other part of the Queen’s dominions are
concerned” be omitted.
Letting the clause stand generally, that the Queen
may grant leave to appeal. I hope this Convention
will not mark the inauguration of a new constitution
by cutting us off from the right of appeal to the Queen
in England. I believe there is a strong and wide
feeling among a large portion of the people of these
colonies that they would not like to have that power
taken away from them, and if my amendment be
agreed to the Privy Council would put the same con-
struction upon the bill as they put upon a similar
provision in the Canadian act, allowing appeals only
in special cases. That is the desire of us all. I am
quite willing that the federal parliament should attach
any conditions as regards costs that may be desirable
to prevent vexatious litigation, but I hope the Con-
vention will not mark this early stage of our intended
inauguration of a constitution by separating this
part of the empire from the right of appeal to the
Queen, making it the only part of her Majesty’s
dominions in that position.
Mr. Playford : Our own court of appeal will be a
court of appeal to the Queen. It will be the Queen’s
court.
Mr. WEIXOX: Our police courts are the Queen’s
courts ; but we are talking of an appeal to the Queen
as the head of the empire, and I should be sorry to
see this portion of her Majesty’s dominions placed in
a position different from that of any other part of the
empire, rendering our law liable to the uncertainty
necessarily attaching to such a course.
Mr. DIBBS : I think the proposal to establish an
appeal court within these colonies is a mistake, as far
as the suitors are concerned, and that the proposal is
more the outcome of sentiment than of practical
necessity. The idea has been that we should give to
our own people—l was about to use the word
“subjects,” but the time has not yet arrived for
that—an appeal court of their own, and that
we should take away from them the right of
appeal, making them almost foreign subjects. The
idea exists in the minds of certain gentlemen that
it will cheapen the cost of litigation to the suitor,
if we have an appeal court in our own territory.


Having had considerable experience in appeals to
the Privy Council, I would say that it is cheaper to
appeal to the Privy Council, to have a thoroughly
unbiassed court, a court in which the highest legal
talent of the empire ought to be available for the
hearing of cases, than it would be to appeal to any
appellate court which might be established here. Of
course, I hold that, as British subjects, we have the
right of appeal to the Queen, and I, therefore, shall
support the amendment of the hon. member, Mr.
Wrixon. To take away from the people of this
country the right of appeal to the throne is to com-
mence to sap the foundations of a union under the
Crown, the principle upon which our federation is to
be established. If we are to be under the Crown let
there be one form of law~, let there be one set of
decisions ruling in every part of the empire. If we
are to carry out what evidently some gentlemen
desire —I do not say that lam among the number—
having our own appeal court, we should have to
practically hoist our ow r n flag, and we should then
have our ow r n decisions to guide all the courts of the
colonies. I believe a majority of hon. members who
support the proposal go for the sentiment of the
thing rather than for the reality. We shall have
certain decisions of the appellate court of the com-
monwealth of Australia—if that name is to be ad-
hered to—and certain decisions of the Privy Council
of England running at the same time within the same
empire. There can be only one final appellate court
in the empire, and that I believe should be the Privy
Council of England. I base that opinion upon con-
siderable experience of the Privy Council and of
litigation in the courts of this colony. I maintain
that it will be absolutely cheaper to take cases to the
Privy Council and settle them there at once, with
all the respect due to that great court of appeal, than
to establish an appellate court here.
Sir JOHN DOWNER : I do not think the ques-
tion of expense w-as so much considered by the com-
mittee as the question of having a national court. It
was the determination to settle our own affairs
amongst ourselves that had much more to do with
the question than the incident of expense, which we
thought would probably be lessened, although for the
purposes of this discussion I will assume that it will
be substantially the same. The chief reason wliich
actuated the committee in coming to this conclusion
was that we believed we had reached a stage of
national life in Australia in which we were fairly
competent to manage our own concerns, not merely
political but judicial as w r ell. Whilst w r e agreed to
follow the course which Canada pursued and to allow
appeals, the words w T ere general in that case, but they
have had a limit placed upon them by the Privy
Council in their decisions. We thought it would be
well to follow the course which was followed in
Canada, adding the limitations which judicial decisions
have imposed upon the more general words. There-
fore, Ave are not going beyond what has been done
before. Although many of us may think we are
doing less than we are disposed to do ourselves, at all
events there will be few of us who will not consider
we ought to have gone at least as far as we have gone
in the bill.

Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: There is a mistake
in this clause, which does not express the intention
of the drafting committee or of the other committee.
The last two lines—
The parliament may confer original jurisdiction on the supreme
court of Australia in such other cases as it thinks fit.
read much more widely than was intended. They
were intended to he read in connection with the list
in the preceding section. Of course, within that list
it is quite right. There is no reason why the supreme
court should not have original jurisdiction in them if
parliament agrees to give it.
Mr. Weixon: Concurrently with the other courts?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Yes. I move that
the last paragraph he amended to read as follows :
The parliament may confer original jurisdiction on the
supreme court of Australia in such other of the cases enume-
rated in the last preceding section as it thinks fit.

ADJOURNMENT.
Motion (by Mr. McMillan) proposed :
That the Convention do now adjourn,
Mr. BARTON: Perhaps I may be allowed to
explain that I was unavoidably absent when clause 55
of chapter I was dealt with this afternoon. If it is
permitted to me to say so I very much regret that I
was not present, as, having been concerned in the
labours of the Constitutional Committee, and having
also, I may fairly say, had some share in the drafting
of the bill, I do not like it to be supposed that I was
deliberately absent on that occasion, I wish to say,
therefore, not being entitled by order to give my
reasons, that I should most deliberately have sup-
ported the clause as it stands in the bill had I been
present.
Mr. ABBOTT: I beg to ask you, sir, and the Con-
vention, to excuse me from attendance to-morrow. I
have very important business to attend to, and I
hope that some other member of the Convention will
take my place to-morrow. If it should not be con-
venient for any hon. member to do that, I will put
aside my engagements, although they are very im-
portant, and be here to act as Chairman of Com-
mittees. I 'would ask some hon. member to take my
place to-morrow.
Hon. Membees : Mr. Barton!
Mr. BARTON: We shall no doubt find a gentle-
man who will gladly occupy the hon. member s place,
but it will be very much better not to decide any-
thing to-night. We all have our engagements; but
I, for one, should be happy to bear my part, and I
am sure that Sir John Bray will bear his; and there
are other gentlemen of experience in the chair who
will also be available. ,
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Convention adjourned 6‘7 p.m.

wealth of Australia Bill.
The President took the chair at 11 a.m.
CHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES.
The President : It has been intimated to me that
the Chairman of Committees will not be here to
preside in Committee to-day, and I understand that
the Hon. W. Moore, the President of the Legislative
Council of Tasmania, is willing to take the chair for
this day only. Perhaps the lion, member, Mr. Barton,
will move that the hon. member, Mr. Moore, take the
chair in Committee for this day only.
Motion (by Mr. Barton) agreed to :
That the Hon. W. Moore take the chair in Committee for
this day only.
PERSONAL EXPLANATION.
Sir GEORGE GREY: Before the orders of the
day are called on, I wish to make a personal explana-
tion, Yesterday, when the motion of the hon.
member, Mr. Kingston, as to courts of conciliation
came on, I was called out of the House to sign an
important law paper, I hurried back as soon as I
could, but I was unable to vote on the question.
Had I been present, however, I should have voted
with the ayes.
COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA BILL.
In Committee (consideration resumed from 6th
April) :
CHAPTER IV'.—finance and trade.
Clause 3. No money shall be drawn from the treasury of
the commonwealth, except under appropriations made bylaw.
Mr. THYNNE : When we were discussing the
clause relating to the powers of the federal parliament,
I called attention to the very great power that was
given to borrow money without any practical restric-
tion, and I then proposed an amendment which would
have the effect of restricting the powers of the federal
parliament for the appropriation of money absolutely
to the purposes authorised by this constitution. At
the suggestion of the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith,
however, I withdrew that amendment, with a view to
having it introduced in this part of the bill. I there-
fore move :
That the following words be added to the clause :—“and
for purposes authorised by this constitution.”
Mr. MUNRO : I think the members of the Com-
mittee will require a little more explanation before
they adopt an amendment of this kind. Are we to
understand that the amendment means that, when
making up the estimates for the year, it will be neces-
sary for the treasurer of the commonwealth to take the
opinion of the law' officers of the Crown as to whether
every item does or does not come within the constitu-
tion 1 If that is what is proposed, I think the amend-
ment will be a most dangerous one. If that is what
will have to be done, there is no know'ing where the
matter will end. My opinion always has been that
we have quite enough to do with lawyers as it is,
without throwing new business into their hands. We
ought to allow the executive of the commonwealth to
exercise their own judgment as to the moneys to be
dealt with and appropriated in the ordinary way ;
but, if they have to consult the law officers of the
Crown upon every item, the result will be an inter-
minable difficulty, which we shall not be able to get
over,
Mr. THYNNE: In answer to the hon. member,
Mr, Munro, I might say that the object of the amend-
ment is to emphasise the strict lines which ought to
exist in regard to the spheres of duty of the two
separate parliaments which have force in these colonies,
and that the federal parliament should be required to
restrict itself to those subjects with which it is intended
by the constitution it should deal, and that it should
not be at liberty to trench upon the functions which
are reserved to the several states by the expenditure
of money which is not contemplated in the objects of
the constitution. I think that this is a very necessary
provision, and it is well that we should have it clearly
understood that the constitution which we are now
preparing is not to be an all-absorbing one, which will
wipe out, by slow or rapid degrees, as the case may bo,
the whole of the functions of the local parliaments.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : This subject has
received a good deal of attention from me at different
times within the last few months. I was under the
same impression as the hon. member, Mr. Thynne,
for a long time. I heard a little discussion about it
here the other day; it was discussed a great deal in
committee, and the result is that I have come to
the conclusion that this provision is not necessary.
Whether other hon. members have come to that con-
clusion Ido not know. I have, however, been thinking
about the matter for several months. It seems to mo
that the words in the Ist clause of the chapter—
shall form one consolidated revenue fund. . . this
constitution.
contain all the limitations we can really insert, how-
ever many words we may use to express them.
Amendment negatived ; clause agreed to.
Clause 4. The parliament of the commonwealth shall
have the sole power and authority, subject to the provisions
of this constitution, to impose customs duties, and duties
of excise upon goods for the time-being the subject of cus-
toms duties, and to grant bounties upon the production or 5
export of goods.
But this exclusive power shall not come into force until
uniform duties of customs have been imposed by the parlia-
ment of the commonwealth.
Upon the imposition of uniform duties of customs by the 10
parliament of the commonwealth all laws of the several
states imposing duties of customs or duties of excise upon
goods the subject of customs duties, and all such laws
offering bounties upon the production or export of goods,
shall cease to have effect. 15
The control and collection of duties of customs and
excise and the payment of bounties shall nevertheless pass
to the executive government of the commonwealth upon
the establishment of the commonwealth.
Colonel SMITH ; I should like to ask the framers
of the bill how they propose to meet the difficulty
which arises in the 3rd paragraph, which states that,
upon the imposition of uniform duties there shall be
free-trade amongst the colonies 1 I think some time
should be fixed after the imposition of the duties,
because it will probably take something like twelve
months for those duties to be brought into effect, and
it may happen that the merchants, especially of some
of the colonies, may import goods in very large
quantities, and virtually swamp the market for some-
thing like two years. It would be much wiser if some
limit were fixed, after the imposition of the duties,
before free-trade can come into operation amongst the
different colonies. Otherwise we may have one colony
swamping the others by rushing goods into their mar-
kets to the injury of the existing manufacturers. I
would suggest to the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith,
to allow the word “ Upon,” in the first line of the 3rd
paragraph to be struck out, and that the words
“ twelve months after,” be inserted in its place. By
this means free-trade will not come into existence for
twelve months, and the stocks which have been taken
in hand with the view of swamping the various local
markets will be somewhat exhausted. With the view
of testing the feeling of the Committee, I move :
That in line 9 the word “ Upon” be omitted with a view to
the insertion of the words “ Twelve months after.”
Mr. MUNRO : This question was very fully dis-
cussed by the Finance Committee, and I confess that
I arrived at the conclusion that the effect would be
exactly the reverse of what my hon. friend proposes


I will point out to him how it would be the reverse.
When the new parliament meets, and makes arrange-
ments for imposing customs duties, the day and hour
upon which they will come into operation will only
be known to the executive, and they will bring them
into effect suddenly. There will, therefore, be no time
for piling up large quantities of goods in the manner
referred to by the hon. member. The hon. member will
see what would happen on the other hand. Supposing
the federal parliament comes into operation on the
Ist January of any year, and you fix that this part
of the law shall only come into operation twelve
months afterwards. In that event, up to the 31st
December, all that possibly could be piled up would
be piled up, because the importers would know the
exact day upon which they would be shut out;
whereas, under the other arrangement, they would be
in doubt, and would not know exactly ——
Colonel Smith : But for twelve months they could
not send their goods across the border without pay-
ing duty. That is my point!
Mr. MUNRO: The hon. member must see that
if the new duties come into effect twelve months
after their imposition, a time is fixed, and that would
be an indication as to when they could send the
goods in.
Colonel Smith ; I do not see the point at all!
Mr. MUNRO: The hon. member must see the
point when others see it, and when those who have
had to feel the effect of it in former times also see it.
The hon. member will remember what did happen in
Victoria when a similar thing was proposed. It was
proposed in one session of parliament to alter the law
with regard to certain goods, and the tariff failed that
session; but a hint was given to the public as to what
the tariff was likely to be, and the result was that
free goods were brought into the colony to swamp the
market for the next two years. The proposal of the
hon. member would act in that direction, for a date
would be fixed on which the tariff would come into
operation, and the result would be that people would
be piling in goods until that day, whereas when the
date is in doubt they cannot do it to the same extent.
The hon. member and everybody else must know that
those smart enough will take advantage of changes
and be prepared to make the most profit they can
make out of them; but they cannot take the same
advantage when the time is in doubt as when it is
fixed.
Mr. McMILLAN: I do not think that the hon.
member, Mr. Munro, sees the drift of the arguments,
neither do I, myself, agree with the hon. member,
Colonel Smith; but if the hon. member, Colonel
Smith, wants to carry out his ideas, he will have to
make his amendment a little different, because it
would create an absurdity. He says, “ One year
after the imposition of uniform custom duties by the
federal parliament,” but the moment the federal par-
liament imposes uniform duties, they must come into
operation; therefore, the hon. member, if he wishes
to give a breathing time of twelve months, will cer-
tainly have to alter the clause a little more thoroughly
than by the insertion of the words “ twelve months.”
Whilst I am on my feet I may say from practical ex-
perience that I do not care when a tariff'comes into
operation. It makes very little difference. People
will go on trading very much as before; and as long
as there is an interval of doubt with regard to future
duties to be imposed, men will generally take their
cue from the debates of a parliament, such as the
federal parliament that will be created then, and will
act accordingly. When once the parliament has
decided on a uniform tariff, I am perfectly certain,
from a commercial point of view, the sooner it comes
into operation the better.
Sir JOHN BRAY: I think the suggestion made
by the hon. member, Colonel Smith, is worthy of a
little consideration, although I cannot support the
amendment in the way in which he proposes it. It
appears to me that we might provide that on a date to
be fixed by the federal parliament the intercolonial
duties should cease. I do not think that we should
fix twelve months; but on the other hand, is it right
to absolutely say to the federal parliament, “ Im-
mediately you impose customs duties, the customs
duties of the several colonies shall cease”?
Mr. Gilltes : You do not want two sets of customs
duties !
Sir JOHN BRAY : I admit that. But the point
to which the hon. member, Colonel Smith, refers is,
that if we had free-trade to-morrow we should have
goods in one colony which had been imported free of
duty competing with goods in another colony upon
which duties had been paid; and the amendment to
some extent removes the inequality.
Mr. Munro ; How can we do it ?
Sir JOHN BRAY : The question is, whether we
should leave the federal parliament to see if they are
able to do it, or say to them, “You shall have no
discretion in the matter; but immediately you make
these uniform customs duties, all other customs duties
on goods shall cease to have effect.” I think it will
be desirable to give the federal parliament a little
power in this matter. It may be, and I think it would
be, true that it would be found that you could not
have two customs tariffs in force at the same time, and
the result would be that immediately a uniform tariff
came into operation free-trade might exist between
the colonies. But is it necessary to tie the hands of
the federal parliament in the way proposed in the
clause ? I think it is not necessary ; and I ask the
hon. member, Colonel Smith, not to press his amend-
ment, .but to substitute one saying that upon a date to
be fixed by the federal parliament, and after the
imposition of uniform duties, all other customs duties
shall cease, so as to give the federal parliament time
to postpone intercolonial free-trade for a few months
if they think fit to do so.
Sir Samuel Griffith : The clause as it stands
contains all that the hon. member, Sir John Bray,
desires!
Mr. LOTON : It appears to me that uniform duties,
when they are imposed by the federal government,
will mean uniform duties, not as between the various
states, but as against the outside world—the customs
duties existing at the time, as between the different
states, will come to an end. The point put by the
hon. member, Sir John Bray, was this: he said that
if the uniform duties were to come into operation at
once it would enable the free-trade colonies to have an
advantage over the others. But if six months further
time is to be given after the uniform duties are
imposed, the position would be this: Supposing, under
the uniform duties, the tariff was 25 per cent, where
it is only 10 or 15 per cent, now, what position would
a free-trade colony be in, where there are no duties at
all ? As the matter is proposed to be dealt with by the
hon. member, Sir John Bray, the people there would
still be able to import for six months free of duty,
while the people in the other colonies would have to
go on paying the protective duties which they have
imposed at the present time, and the position in New
South Wales, or any other free-trade colony, at the
end of the six months would simply be that people
would have piled up as many million pounds’ worth of
undamageable goods as possible, would hold those goods
in hand at the end of the six months, and would have
paid no duty at all on them ; whereas the people in
the other colonies would have had to continue paying
the protective duty that they have at the present
time. To my mind, speaking as a commercial man,
whenever these uniform duties are imposed, they
must come into operation at once—the public should
have no opportunity at all of taking advantage of
the situation.


Mr. DONALDSON : One matter that has been
lost sight of in the discussion will be in the minds of
all hon. members who have been in governments.
Where a reduction of duties is made, it is usual that
the new duties shall come into operation at a certain
time, as it would be rather unfair on a holder of
goods who has paid high duties upon them that com-
petition should go against him the day after the
passing of the new tariff. I think that is the point
which the hon. member, Colonel Smith, has tried to
provide against; but in endeavouring to do that he
is placing a tremendous restriction on trade if his
amendment is carried, that twelve months shall elapse
before free-trade shall take place between the various
colonies. No doubt some of the colonies that levy
much lower customs duties than others would have
an immense advantage after the passing of a uniform
tariff, inasmuch as they would be able to send their
goods to colonies where higher duties have been
imposed, and undersell the persons who had imported
there. Whilst I do not agree with the amendment
in the way it is proposed, I at the same time agree
that the federal parliament, in passing a tariff bill,
should make the same provision as is made by all other
parliaments, namely, that where reductions take place
the new duties should not come into operation till after
a certain time, whereas the increases should be made
immediately. I do not wish to fetter the hands of the
federal parliament too much. They should be the best
judges of their own matters, and I think we should
have sufficient confidence in them to believe that they
would act fairly and justly to the whole community.
Therefore, the bill as it stands, in my opinion, is much
better than the amendment of my hon. friend.
Mr. DEAKIN : The discussion has drifted upon
two apparently different lines, and the question
answered by my colleague, Mr. Munro, is one of quite
a different nature from that which the hon. member,
Colonel Smith, intended to bring before the Com-
mittee. It is not a question of whether you should
frame a tariff, and having framed it, publish it to the
world, and postpone its coming into operation for a
given time.
Mr. Munro : That is what I meant!
Mr. DEAKIN; Exactly. Because that would be
simply to invite the importers to flood the country
with all the goods upon which it was intended to
impose high duties. Such a proposal as that would
not be listended to for a moment by any body of
sensible men. But is it not certain that the manu-
facturing interests of the whole of Australia will be
subject to an enormous stress of competition even
without the publication of that tariff? It is perfectly
true that until the federal government brings down
its proposals no business man will be able to say upon
what goods duties will be imposed, or to what extent
they will be imposed. But does it require any such
indication as that to put commercial men on the qui
vivc ? Will not the fact that probably protection and
free-trade will be submitted to the country by rival
leaders and by candidates in all the constituencies be
the first warning? Will not the return of the parlia-
ment with a majority of its members known to hold a
certain opinion be another indication ? And will not
the importers of all the colonies if they see that a pro-
tectionist majority is being returned to the federal
parliament, at once take steps to fill their warehouses
to the brim ?
Mr. Dibbs : No I
Mr. DEAKIN : Of course they will; and the fact
is, that under these circumstances the influx of goods
will be to that colony which imposes the lowest duties,
especially to a colony which practically imposes no
duties. To this it may be replied, and not unfairly,
that although the ports of that colony are open, they
will be as much open to the merchants resident in the
other colonies as to the merchants in that particular
colony. So that it is not a question of the importers
of New South Wales against all the rest of the con-
tinent ; it is a question of all the importers of all the
colonies making use of New South Wales or any other
colony in which duties are low to introduce large
quantities of goods with the view of having them
on hand at the time when protectionist duties are
imposed and then selling them at a large advance.
That is the danger to be guarded against. That is the
very real and very substantial danger which the hon.
member, Colonel Smith, had in his mind, and which
he desired to meet by his amendment. It appears to
me, however, that the amendment will not meet it, and
I say with some reluctance that at the present time
I do not see any amendment which can meet it, because,
if you consider it for a moment, it implies the imposition
of two tariffs. If it is desired to have a uniform tariff
established, and yet at the same time to maintain the
intercolonial tariffs for a given time afterwards, you
have two tariffs maintained in each colony. Surely
that is an impossibility ? Under which tariff are goods
which present themselves for admission, either at the
border or at the seaboard, to pay duty ? It is clearly
impossible to have two tariffs in operation, one for the
protection of our industries as against the importations
of a neighbouring colony with lower duties, and the
other against the outside world. Under these circum-
stances I think we have no resource, unless it be to
adopt some amendment which may give the federal
legislature a wider latitude of choice than the clause
appears to present. The hon. member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, considers that the hands of the commonwealth
parliament are not tied by the clause. That is perfectly
true as regards either the framing of the tariff or the
date on which it shall come into operation. But there
is no indication of any further power being given to
them, if it can be given—and I consider that is a
matter of grave doubt. But the point of the hon.
member, Sir John Bray, is surely worthy of great con-
sideration in view of the grave importance of the issue
as to whether it would not be possible to add words
to the clause, indicating that it is intended to endow
the parliament of the commonwealth with every
liberty of dealing with this question so as to be just
to the several states. What we desire to do is, know-
ing that there must be something like a commercial
revolution when a uniform tariff is imposed through-
out Australia, to render that revolution as easy of
acceptance and assimilation as possible by the indus-
tries of the various colonies —not to expose those
who have invested their capital in manufactures to
any greater shock than may be absolutely essential.
This risk is not peculiar to Victoria —it pertains to
every colony in the group which possesses any duties,
and under which industries have grown up. Is it not
possible, I would ask the hon. member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, to introduce some words to indicate that this
Convention contemplated the commonwealth parlia-
ment taking into consideration all the circumstances of
the case, when imposing a uniform tariff, of which, of
course, it could give no warning without increasing the
danger ? It should be indicated that power is given to
devise any expedient, if expedient be possible, to miti-
gate this temporary industrial crisis which must occur
when a uniform tariff is imposed.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I should like to know
what the hon. member is driving at a little more in
detail before I answer his question.
Mr. PLAYFORD : There is only one point on
which I should like some information from the ton.
member, Sir Samuel Griffith. This clause says the
exclusive power of levying duties of customs and
excise shall not come into force until uniform duties
of customs have been imposed by the parliament of
the commonwealth. Now, we cannot wait for them.
Directly the treasurer of the commonwealth announces
to the federal parliament his tariff, it will be at once
telegraphed to the various colonies, and the duties will
be collected on that basis. The only point, therefore,


is, will these words cover that case ? It will be seen
at a glance that, unless the duties are at once collected
the importers will be clearing goods under the old
tariff wherever it suits them, all through the common-
wealth. Will these words, I ask, give power to the
treasurer of the commonwealth to instruct the various
customs officers throughout the commonwealth to
collect the duties which he has presented to the parlia-
ment of the commonwealth to consider ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : The hon. member no
doubt is aware that, although that is done in the case
of every new tariff proposed, it is done contrary to
law, and the parliament afterwards indemnifies the
treasurer. The only way is to give the tariff a retro-
spective effect. The tariff will come into operation in
the same way as tariffs do now. I doubt myself,
however, very much whether in the case of the first
tariff it will be so. I doubt whether parliament itself
would think it desirable that it should be retrospective
in its' effect. That, however, is a matter for them to
determine.
Mr. Playpord ; They will lose revenue if they do
not most fearfully !
Mr. GILLIES : In the event of a proposal on the
part of the treasurer to increase the duties, the
increased duties will be collected, and in the case of a
proposal to decrease the duties a bond will be taken,
as is usual in all the colonies, so that in every indi-
vidual case where a duty is increased in a particular
state, and left as it is in another state, the increase in
that particular state will be collected from the time
the treasurer announces his proposals.
Mr, DONALDSON : That is the practice ; but we
must bear in mind that we shall then be dealing with
one tariff, although previously we had four or five
tariffs.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Oh, no !
Mr. DONALDSON: Yes; the tariffs of the various
colonies.
Mr. Munro : Only one new tariff!
Mr. DONALDSON : There has not been much
difficulty in the past where only one tariff was being
altered ; but here is a new tariff coming into opera-
tion to take the place of all the tariffs in existence at
the present tim 6. I say there will be very great
difficulty in the case. Of course where the proposal
is to reduce the duties the revenue will be collected
on the lower rate, and a bond given in the case of the
bill not being passed. But there are a great many
inequalities about this. The more you look into it the
greater the difficulties which present themselves. If
we were to put restrictions in at the present time, I
fear they would act adversely as far as the federal
parliament is concerned.
Mr. Munro : The federal parliament will be able to
manage it!
Mr. DIBBS : The hon. member, Colonel Smith, sees
a difficulty, but has not suggested a remedy to meet
the case. We all know that the commercial element
in the whole of these colonies is particularly keen.
Commercial men are in the habit of keeping their eye
to windward, in view of any possible change in the
tariff. As the present Colonial Treasurer of New
South Wales knows, when any alteration in the tariff
is pending, his shadow is haunted by a variety of com-
mercial men who endeavour to glean from him the
direction the change will take. I, myself, have known
of large fortunes being made in New South Wales by
men engaged in the wine and spirit trade. They have
succeeded in ascertaining, from the utterances of the
colonial treasurer of the day, the direction of the con-
templated change before the delivery of the budget
speech, and on one of these occasions a large quantity
of rum was taken out of bond, and commercial men
were the gainers by that transaction to the extent of
some thousands of pounds, while the revenue was the
loser. But let us take our experience; let us take the
actual facts. Within the last three or four years a
government in this colony succeeded in carrying
through Parliament a tariff bill imposing ad valorem
duties of 5 per cent. That bill was denounced by the
free-trade party as being the rankest protection, but
when that party came into power they gave twelve
months’ notice of their intention to take off these par-
ticular duties, with a result exactly similar to that
which the hon. member, Colonel Smith, has in his
mind. The free-trade party, who objected to the 5
per cent, duties, and called them the rankest protec-
tion, imported goods, and put them into bond until
the twelve months’ notice, had expired, thus making
a haul of £70,000. That was perfectly legitimate
commercial work ; but I think some words should be
put into this clause to prevent a contingency of that
kind. A simple remedy occurred to my mind when
the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, was speaking. Why
not insert words to the effect that the new tariff of the
commonwealth should be the tariff of Victoria'?
Mr. Munro : That is too thin !
Mr. DIBBS: What did the hon. member tell the
interviewing reporters in Melbourne the other day 1
He told them several important things. They were
all published in the Sydney newspapers, and I should
like, if possible, to get at the truth in the hon. mem-
ber’s mind, and also to ascertain from the Colonial
Treasurer of New South Wales whether he was a
party to the alleged compact. It seems, judging from
what the hon. member, Mr. Munro, said, that the
Finance Committee appointed by this Convention have
arranged what the tariff of the future commonwealth
of Australia shall be.
Mr, Munro : They have not!
Mr. McMillan : Only in the hon. member’s imagi-
nation !
Mr. DIBBS: I will read what the hon. member
said.
Mr. Munro : What is it from 1
Mr, DIBBS : The Sydney Morning Herald.
Mr. Munro : It would be a bad job for the hon.
member if everything which appeared in the news-
papers in reference to him were true !
Mr. DIBBS : The article to which I refer is headed,
“ Mr. Munro on the Federation Convention ; a gloomy
outlook.” I pass over the gloomy outlook.
Mr. Munro : That has disappeared !
Mr. DIBBS:
There has evidently been some private arrangement in the
Finance Committee between the colonial treasurers of the,
respective colonies.
Mr. Munro : Who said that 1
Mr, DIBBS : Mr. Munro.
Mr. Munro : I never did !
Mr. DIBBS : Then I ask the hon. member to deny
it..
Mr. Munro ; I do deny it!
Mr. DIBBS : Then I will bring the hon. member
face to face with the Sydney Morning Herald and with
the Melbourne reporters who interviewed him.
Mr. Munro : It is quite enough to be brought face
to face with the hon. member !
Mr. Loton : And how does the hon. member know
that any one of the present colonial treasurers in the
various colonies will be treasurer of the federal
government ?
Mr. McMillan : There will be plenty of candidates,
because there will always be a surplus !
Mr. DIBBS : It is quite true that if this scheme
comes into operation the treasurer of the federal
government will always have a surplus, because at the
outset the various colonies will be asked to hand over
their customs and excise revenue to a government that
cannot spend more than 10s. in the £, handing back
to the colonies the balance, if they do not find some
means of spending it to conciliate their supporters.
When the various colonies come to look into the
question they will have to determine how far they will
permit the federal parliament to put everything into


one sack, and if there should be any surplus to dole
out to each colony, as a sort of sop, a few shillings per
head of their populations, the colonies themselves
being, in the meantime, governed from some source
not provided in this bill. I should like to know
whether it is true that the treasurers of the various
colonies sitting in the Finance Committee of this Con-
vention have agreed among themselves that the future
tariff of the commonwealth shall be upon the lines of
the Victorian tariff? If that arrangement has been
made, and especially if the free-trade Treasurer of Hew
South Wales has agreed to the course, then the whole
difficulty can be easily overcome by putting into the
bill we are now discussing words to the effect that, on
the constitution becoming law, there shall be one tariff
in the colonies, that tariff being the tariff'of Victoria.
Mr. Burgess ; But what the hon. member states
with regard to the treasurers coming to an agreement
on that point is not true !
Mr. DIBBS : According to the a Sydney Morning
Herald, Mr. Munro was asked this question :
But, independently of the point in dispute, there appears
to have been almost unanimity ; none of the distrust antici-
pated regarding the surrender of fiscal control by the indi-
vidual colonies seems to have been shown ?
And he answered :
No. Everything in that respect has been amicably settled.
The delegates talked the matter over among themselves some
time ago, and arranged it all. Our work on the Finance
Committee, of which I was chairman, consisted merely of
settling details. It is generally admitted among the delegates
that the tariff adopted by the federation must be the Victorian
tariff against the outside world, with intercolonial free-trade.
I should like to know whether this matter has been
already arranged, because the people of Hew South
Wales are anxious to have an answer. They want to
know whether they are to have intercolonial free-trade
and protection against the world on such a basis. Will
the hon. member, Mr. Munro, deny the existence of
this arrangement ?
Mr, Munro : I have already denied it two or three
times !
Mr. DIBBS : Hot in the newspapers.
Mr. Munro : I do not deny anything through the
press!
Mr. DIBBS : The Sydney Morning Herald has a
large circulation in this colony, and in that appears
the report that this agreement was made by the
Finance Committee, imperilling the political existence
of our own Colonial Treasurer. I ask these rival
candidates for the treasurership in the common-
wealth
Mr. Munro ; I am not in it!
Mr. DIBBS : I ask them whether there is any
truth in the statement ? If there be no truth in it,
the sooner it is emphatically denied the better, not
only for the reputation of the hon. member, Mr,
Munro, but also for the free-trade reputation of my
hon. friend, the Colonial Treasurer of Hew South
Wales. If this has been already arranged
Mr. Munro : Even the report does not say it has—
it does not speak of any arrangement!
Mr. DIBBS : This was not written by Coulston, the
man under the hon. member’s bed \ it was written by
a reporter in open daylight, and the people of free-
trade Hew South Wales want to know if their Colonial
Treasurer has consented to give up his free-trade ideas,
and to make the fiscal policy of Victoria the policy of
the future commonwealth 1 I think that if there be
any ground for this rumour, the easiest way out of the
difficulty would be to make the amendment I have
suggested.
Sir John Bray: Will the hon. member move it?
Mr. DIBBS : I will with pleasure; but in the first
place I should like an explanation from the hon.
member, Mr. Munro.
Mr. Munro : If the hon. member will sit down I
will make it!
Hon. Members : Question !
Mr. DIBBS : I have occupied less time than has any
member of the Convention. 1 have been a very patient
listener. I have received on one day information
which has been cancelled by a complete change of
front on the part of those who gave it on the following
day—notably, in reference to the state rights question.
I wish the hon. member, Mr. Munro, to deny this
report.
Mr. Munro : I do not deny all that is contained in
the report; but I certainly deny what the hon. mem-
ber has said !
Mr. DIBBS : I will teach my hon. friends here,
especially from Hew South Wales, who are pledged to
vote in a certain way, that I stand here entirely as a
free lance. I have been within these walls too long
to allow my mouth to be shut at a moment’s notice.
If we are to have intercolonial free-trade, is ft to be
assumed that we are to have protection against the
outside world? If so, the sooner that is stated boldly
and distinctly, the better chance there will be of
federation being approved of by the people of Hew
South Wales. At present all that we know is the
statement of the press, made on the authority of the
hon. member, Mr. Munro, which leaves some of the
Hew South Wales members in the unenviable position
of having to make an explanation. While they are
making their explanations I will write out an amend-
ment expressing my views.
Mr. McMILLAH: The hon. member, Mr. Dibbs,
is always a curious mixture of humour and assertion.
How, there has been some misapprehension—and of
course by the enemies of my own party this misappre-
hension has been circulated very broadly—with regard
to the proceedings in the secrecy of the Finance
Committee ; and perhaps it is better to make a clear
explanation of what actually did occur, because some
figures will be used in the course of this debate which
may increase the misunderstanding. When the dele-
gates particularly connected with finance operations
came to Sydney, they required certain figures to be
worked out on certain bases, and I told them that the
Government Statistician of this colony would be very
glad to work out—of course in a mechanical way—
anything they desired that might illustrate the subject
in any way whatever. In doing that, I think I only
showed the ordinary courtesy which I might expect to
be shown to myself by the government statistician of
another colony. When the Finance Committee met,
they thought it was well to have all the suggestions of
all the members of the committee worked out purely
pro formd with a view to the whole question being
thoroughly discussed. Of course, as hon. members
know, in a committee of that kind many subjects may
come up for discussion, many views may be put for-
ward, but it is only the crystallised report of the com-
mittee that has any right to go before the world. How,
the hon. member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, decided
that a certain calculation should be made up for all
the colonies on the basis of the Victorian tariff. That
was entirely his own suggestion. The Government
Statistician worked it out for him in a purely
mechanical manner, and I believe that the desire of
the hon. member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, to have
those figures before him is entirely answerable for the
whole of this rumour. But it is very unfair and
ungenerous to deal in this way with any of the figures
that came before the committee. All that the com-
mittee are answerable for—all that I am personally
answerable for as the free-trade Treasurer of Hew
South Wales—is the absolute report that was fur-
nished to the Convention. That is a clear explana-
tion of the whole matter. Of course the desire of the
hon. member, Mr. Dibbs, in this debate is to practi-
cally commit this Convention to a tariff against the
world upon a protective basis. We all know that
there must be a customs tariff, but certainly we
are going far beyond our province if for one moment
we attempt to dictate what shall be the fiscal policy of


the future. The free-traders of New South Wales
have gone so far—that is, myself speaking for others,
and my chief at the head of the Government—we
have gone so far that we say it is absolutely necessary
in order to have any union that we place in the hands
of a federal parliament the whole question of the tariff
of the future. Then, if we, as free-traders, fall, we fall.
Mr. Dibbs : You have fallen already !
Mr. McMILLAN : We shall have to give way to a
majority of the whole of the colonies, because we simply
rocognise the rule which guides us in our own parlia-
ment, which guided the hon, member, Mr. Dibbs, the
leader of the Opposition, when he gave way to the
present Government of this colony, although it might
only have had a majority of two or three. That rule
must guide us all in this case if we are to come under
a union. Consequently it is very unfair that this
rumour should be circulated, and it is very ungenerous
on the part of the hon. member, Mr. Dibbs, to try to
fix this Convention to vote on any resolution referring
to the fiscal policy of the future.
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH : I demur entirely
to the explanation just given by the hon. member, Mr.
McMillan. I want to refer first to the real point that
the hon. member, Mr. Dibbs, brought against the hon.
member, Mr. Munro. I read the account of the inter-
view when I was in Brisbane. When I came down
here, finding that nobody had made mention of it, I
thought it was a burlesque. It is a burlesque, because
it is so far from the truth, and I did not think it was
worth while to waste the time of the Convention by
bringing it up. But I do not want an explanation of
how the rumour came about to be made by the hon.
member, Mr. McMillan. I want to hear a denial
from the hon. member, Mr. Munro, that he said such a
thing to a reporter, or that he was the origin of such a
report; because I give my testimony that the subject
of fixing the tariff for the future was understood to be
left to the federal government, and there was not one
word ever said about it up to the day that I left. I
consulted my colleagues afterwards, and they said it
was not mentioned on the only day I was absent. I
want to hear that denial. I now come to another
point which was referred to by the hon. member, Mr.
McMillan. It is a point on which, I think, the
Finance Committee failed most egregiously in the
performance of their duty. The hon. member, Mr.
McMillan, hints that there might be some information
put before the committee which it was right should
be furnished to them ; but that, having given their
report, they were not bound to give the information
on which the report was based. Now, any one looking
at the report of the committee will see at once what a
bald thing it was, and they will be struck by the fact
that the only important part of that document is one
respecting which there is not a single table published
or any proof given as to the conclusion arrived at. At
the same time, a lot of useless tables, about twenty in
number, are given, although no reference is made to
them in the report. Now, why were the tables to
which I refer suppressed 1 It is useless for the hon,
member, Mr. McMillan, to say that they were sup-
pressed because the committee were afraid that the
rumour would do harm. The best way was to give
the whole of the information, and there was no reason
whatever for suppressing it. The hon. member, Mr.
McMillan, is wrong when he says that this was infor-
mation got at my suggestion, and obtained by me
from the Government Statistician. I would recall to
his mind the fact that the Government Statistician
was called before the committee, and the committee,
through the chairman, instructed him to work out
certain calculations on the Victorian tariff. It was
not I who personally instructed him.
Sir John Bray : I thought the hon. member did!
sir thomas Mcllwraith ; it was the
chairman. The facts of the matter are these:
certain calculations based on an imaginary tariff had
been made up by the Government Statistician. The
hon. member, Sir John Bray, questioned the accuracy
of the imaginary tariff, and of course as long as it
was known to be an imaginary tariff we only wanted
to get the result of it. I told the committee that
what I wanted to prove could be established by
taking any tariff and working out the same calcu-
lation. I offered the hon. member, Sir John Bray,
to take the tariff of South Australia.
Mr. McMillan: Was not the information obtained
by the hon. member before the committee met 1
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH : That is a very
different thing altogether. What I say is this : that
I asked the hon. member, Mr. Munro, to tell the
Government Statistician plainly what to do. But I
had been getting the information for myself privately,
and it was the committee who ordered the Govern-
ment Statistician to prepare the information.
Mr. McMillan : That was afterwards !
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH: I did not tell
the committee. All that I told them was that I was
getting some information, and I offered to take any
tariff. The hon. member, Mr. Munro, asked that we
should take the Victorian tariff, and the whole of the
committee agreed to that as an experiment. That
table is suppressed, and not only that table, but other
important tables bearing on the matter. Is it not
an absurd thing to take evidence and then to hand
in a report omitting the principal part of the
evidence 1 We have not the whole of the evidence
suppressed, but only a portion of it, and that the
portion dealing with a vital part of the report.
Mr. MUNRO : This is one of the things which
always arise from having secret meetings. We ought
to have done all our business publicly, so that every-
body would know what we were doing. The charge
made by an hon. member, Mr. Dibbs, that I said we
had all agreed that the Victorian tariff should be the
tariff to be adopted, is not true. I said nothing of
sort. What I did say was that I took a calculation
on the Victorian tariff to ascertain what the effect
upon the revenue of the various colonies would be,
and we found, what does not appear in any of the
tables, as the hon. member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith,
says, the effect to be marvellous—that the actual import
duties received altogether in Victoria is only 11 per
cent. ; in South Australia, 21 per cent. ; in Western
Australia, 24 per cent. ; and in the other colonies, 18
per cent. So that the actual amount raised by means
of import duties in Victoria is the lowest of that of
all the colonies, except New South Wales, That is
the result of the tables that were calculated for us on
the basis of the Victorian tariff. That is the informa-
tion which I gave—that if we wanted the import
duties levied in any of the colonies we must accept
either the free-trade tariff of New South Wales or the
protectionist tariff of Victoria. There is no getting
away from that, because they are the lowest.
Sir Thomas Mcllwraith : That is only the hon.
member’s opinion. It is not expressed by the com-
mittee !
Mr. MUNRO: I am talking of the results of
the calculations. The result of the calculations was
that one was 5 per cent, and the other less than
II per cent., and the rest very much higher. lam
not expressing an opinion, but making a statement
of fact. If the future parliament wants to levy import
duties they must take one or the other of those tariffs.
To say that I said that the Finance Committee or
anybody else had come to any arrangement about the
adoption of any tariff is altogether wrong. I said
nothing of the sort, as every one knows that not one
of us may be a member of the federal parliament, and
that parliament must make its own arrangements.
The statement as to these tables being calculated, as
the hon. member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, said, is
absolutely true. The calculations were made. I
should have wished that all the calculations should


have gone among the appendices to the report. I did
all I could to get that done, but there was an objection
on the part of the committee, and as I had been going
for compromise, I yielded to that objection and agreed
that the tables should not be published.
Mr. BURGESS : I think it a matter of regret that
the hon. member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, was not
present on the last day when the Finance Committee
met. We had the advantage of his presence at every
meeting except the last, when I think Mr. Donaldson
took his place as a representative of Queensland. In
justice to the hon. member, Mr. McMillan, I must
confirm what he has stated with reference to the way
in which the calculation about the Victorian tariff was
brought about. It was very necessary that the Finance
Committee should have some idea, based upon some
fixed tariff, as to what result any alteration in our
customs duties would have upon the sums which the
colonies have hitherto derived from that particular
source of revenue. The hon. member, Sir Thomas
Mcllwraith, having intimated that he had previously
asked the Government Statistician to prepare a return,
based upon the Victorian tariff, and the Government
Statistician having stated that he had that work in
hand, we thought that it would be well that it should
be completed and brought before the committee, and
that was, perhaps, the reason why the Victorian tariff
was taken as the basis of our calculations. Later on
—on the last day—when it became necessary to decide
which tables should form the appendices to our report,
the hon. member, Mr. McMillan, very properly brought
under our notice the fact that it might give colour to
the rumour that he was in favour of a protective
tariff being established, if we put in the Victorian
tariff alone as the basis of our calculations, and it was
for that reason, and that reason alone, that that par-
ticular table was not inserted in the appendices.
Sir Thomas Mcllwraitii : That is only one. There
were three others!
Mr. BURGESS : That is only one. There were
three others which, upon consideration, it was thought
were not required; and I think the committee were
perfectly justified in submitting those tables, which
they thought had some bearing upon the report. It
will be our duty to more carefully inquire into this
matter when we come to sections 9, 10, and 11, I
merely rose to say that we simply took the Victorian
tariff because, as a matter of fact, it was in course of
preparation. The probability is that, if that tariff
had not been suggested and the work partly done,
some other tariff would have been taken in lieu of it.
Colonel Smith : I will, with the permission of the
Committee, withdraw my amendment.
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
Amendment (by Mr. Dibbs) proposed :
That the following words be omitted :—“ Upon the imposi-
tion of uniform duties of customs by the parliament of the
commonwealth all laws of the several states imposing duties
of customs or duties of excise upon goods the subject of
customs duties, and all such laws offering bounties upon the
production or export of goods, shall cease to have effect,” with
the view to insert in lieu thereof the following words; —
“That upon the constitution becoming law and the common-
wealth being established, the tariff now existing in the pro-
vince of Victoria shall be the tariff of the commonwealth
until otherwise dealt with by the parliament.”
Mr. MARMION: I would ask the hon. member
why he proposes the tariff “now” existing in Victoria
should be adopted ?
Amendment negatived; clause, as read, agreed to.
Clause 5. Upon the establishment of the commonwealth,
all officers employed by the government of any state in any
department of the public service the control of which is by
this constitution assigned to the commonwealth, shall become
subject to the control of the executive government of the
commonwealth. But all existing rights of any such officers
shall be preserved.
Mr. GORDON : I should like to ask the hon. gen-
tleman in charge of the bill what will be the position
in regard to officers who are entitled to pensions ?
An Hon. Member : The clause provides that their
rights shall be preserved !
Mr. GORDON : But on which government will
the responsibility rest—the state government or the
federal government? In some colonies there is a
pension list, amounting to £300,000 or £400,000. In
South Australia we have, fortunately, no pension
list. I think it should be clearly understood that the
federal government will take over these liabilities,
dating from the time when the officers are transferred.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : This is a matter of
detail which it is quite impossible to go into in the
constitution. The committee, after full discussion,
thought it would be sufficient to provide that all exist-
ing rights should be preserved, leaving it to the execu-
tive government of the commonwealth and the other
governments to work out the details between them.
Mr. DIBBS : The question raised by the hon.
member, Mr. Gordon, is a very important one. The
officers in the civil service of New South Wales have
paid large sums into a superannuation fund, from
which they are entitled to draw pensions, and it is
important to know whether, if they are transferred to
the federal government, their pensions shall be trans-
ferred also.
Mr. Munro ; The clause provides that all existing
rights shall be preserved !
Mr. DIBBS : Does that mean that the federal
government will take over the liability ? The tendency
seems to be opposed to the granting of pensions by
the commonwealth ; but in New South Wales several
thousands of persons have for years past been paying
4 per cent, of their salaries to a pension fund, and if
they are transferred to the federal government it
ought to be provided that the arrangement with regard
to their superannuation fund should be continued.
The clause would appear to have a prejudicial effect
upon the civil servants to whom I have referred, and I
think it requires explanation.
Mr. GORDON : I beg to move :
That the following words be added to the clause :—“But the
commonwealth shall not be responsible for any pensions
agreed to be paid by the states. ”
Amendment negatived ; clause, as read, agreed to.
Clause 8. So soon as the parliament of the commonwealth
has imposed uniform duties of customs, trade and intercourse
throughout the commonwealth, whether by means of internal
carriage or ocean navigation, shall be absolutely free.
Colonel SMITH : This clause absolutely fixes the
time. Would it not be better to leave that to be fixed
at the discretion of the federal parliament ?
Mr. Gillies : It will be fixed in the act!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Surely the parliament
when it imposes a tariff will say when it shall come
into operation.
Colonel Smith : This clause says “ so soon as ” !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : The duties will not be
imposed until the tariff law comes into operation. The
hon. gentleman seems to contemplate that the federal
parliament may settle a tariff and give six months’notice
of its coming into operation. I doubt very much
whether a parliament would do anything of the kind.
Clause agreed to.
Clause 9. The revenue of the commonwealth shall be ap-
plied in the first instance in the payment of the expenditure
of the commonwealth, and the surplus shall be returned to
the several states in proportion to the amount of revenue
raised therein respectively, subject to the following pro-
visions :
(1) As to duties of customs or excise, provision shall be
made for ascertaining, as nearly as may be, the amount
of duties collected in each state or part of the common-
wealth in respect of dutiable goods which are after-
wards exported to another state or part of the common-
wealth, and the amount of such duties shall be taken
to have been collected in the state or part to which the
goods have been so exported, and shall be added to the
duties actually collected in that state or part, and
deducted from the duties collected in the state or part
of the commonwealth from which the goods were
exported;


(2) As to the proceeds of direct taxes, the amount con-
tributed or raised in respect of income earned in any
state or part of the commonwealth, or arising from
property situated in any state or part of the common-
wealth, and the amount contributed or raised in respect
of property situated in any state or part of the com-
monwealth, shall be taken to have been raised in that
state or part :
(3) Until uniform duties of customs have been imposed,
the amount of any bounties paid to any of the people
of a state or part of the commonwealth shall be deducted
from the amount of the surplus to be returned to that
state or part:
(4) Such return shall be made monthly, or at such shorter
intervals as may be convenient.
Sir JOHN" BRAY : An amendment of which I
have given notice provides for a different manner of
apportioning the surplus revenue to that provided in
the bill. This clause proposes that the revenue of the
commonwealth shall be applied in the first instance to
the payment of the expenditure of the commonwealth,
the surplus to be returned to the several states in
proportion to the amount of revenue raised therein
respectively. Ido not think it needs much thought
to see that if we are going to endeavour to ascertain
the amount of revenue raised in each colony after the
establishment of free-trade we shall have to maintain
as great an army of customs officials as we do at the
present time.
Mr. Munro : No !
Sir JOHN BRAY : We shall have to maintain even
a greater number, because it does not require much
foresight to imagine that the principal ports of Aus-
tralia will be more than ever the means by which
goods will be received from other parts of the world,
and distributed amongst the several colonies; and it
will be almost impossible, with all the checks that
human ingenuity can devise, to find out the ultimate
destination of these goods. We all know that merchants
and other people like to buy in the biggest market,
and it is quite possible to suppose that Sydney and
Melbourne will become the emporiums from which the
other colonies will be to a great extent supplied ; and
if goods are imported into Sydney or Melbourne, and
there purchased, and sent afterwards to different parts
of Australia, we shall have to follow them to their
ultimate destination, in order to know what colony
should be credited with contributing the customs
duties. It seems to me that we shall do away with
half the benefit arising from intercolonial free-trade
if we attempt to put any check upon the distri-
bution of goods in the manner proposed. In the
published tables hon. members will see the amount
contributed by the various colonies in the shape
of customs duties. The amount per head in New
South Wales is at present less than that in any other
colony, and South Australia comes next. It seems to
be imagined that whatever tariff is devised certain
colonies that now pay a comparatively low amount
per head will continue to do so in comparison with
other colonies. But I take it that if we wish to
establish a proper system of federation we ought to
assume that any uniform customs tariff that bears
fairly on the inhabitants of Australia will result in
the inhabitants of each colony paying the same per
head pro rata as the inhabitants of Australia generally
pay. If we attempt to suggest, as we do in this bill,
that it is not only possible, but probable, that a tariff
will be imposed which will compel the people of one
colony to pay a far greater amount through the
customs than the people of another colony, and that,
after providing for the federal expenditure, we shall
have to return to the people of each colony, not an
amount in proportion to its population, but an amount
to bo estimated on the assumption that a certain
quantity of dutiable goods had been consumed by
each inhabitant of the different colonies—if we
attempt to do this, we involve ourselves in calcula-
tions which cannot fail to give great dissatisfaction.
The true remedy is to provide that the whole of the
federation revenue shall be expended for the general
benefit of Australia. If we could do that, and so
ensure that there should be no surplus, we should be
accomplishing a very good thing indeed. I do not
know that it is impossible to secure that object at the
present time ; and I intend, at a subsequent stage, to
propose a clause by which the commonwealth shall
be liable for the public debts of all the colonies, and
that each colony shall be liable to the commonwealth
for its debts exceeding a certain amount; that is to
say, we will take the lowest amount any one colony
owes at the present time, and say that that shall be
the basis on which the debts of the different colonies
shall be taken over.
Mr. Kingston ; The rate per head !
Sir JOHN BRAY : The rate per head. The clause
which I intend to propose reads as follows
The commonwealth shall be liable for the public debts of
each state existing at the time of this act coming into opera-
tion, and each state shall be liable to the commonwealth for
the amount (if any) by which the public debt owing by the
state shall exceed the amount of pounds per head of
the population of such state.
Colonel Smith : Where does the hon. member intend
to bring that in ?
Sir JOHN BRAY : I shall bring it in later, but not
in this clause. If we can devise some fair scheme by
which the public revenue of the commonwealth shall
be expended for the public benefit of Australia, let us
do so ; but do not let us encumber the scheme with
the idea that each particular mode of taxation is to be
levied to an extent greater than is required for the
public purposes of the commonwealth, and that in
each mode of taxation, whether through the customs
or by excise duties, there will be a surplus to be re-
turned to the different colonies of Australia, and that
that surplus is to be estimated on the basis of the
amount paid to each colony as far as it can be ascer-
tained. As far as customs duties are concerned, I
believe it will be absolutely impossible, when we have
free-trade between the colonies, to determine what
amount could fairly be reckoned as having been raised
in each particular state. I believe it will be more
than ever difficult to get the returns for that purpose.
At the present time, with customs officers on each
border, it is to some extent possible to do it ; but when
intercolonial customs duties are abolished merchants
and other people will be less careful than they are
now to ascertain the amount of goods passing from
one colony to another. It will not be considered so
necessary as it is now ; but if you carry out the idea
that the surplus is to be divided on the assumption
that each colony is to be credited with the customs
duties derived from it, it will be absolutely necessary
to take some account of these goods. But let us
rather agree that if there is a surplus it shall be
divided on the basis of population, though I hope
that there will not be a surplus, and that no more
money will be raised than will be required for the
purposes of the commonwealth. Even if we adopted
a free-trade tariff, the customs duties would be far
more than required for the duties which we have
already suggested should be undertaken by the
commonwealth. The customs duties for New South
Wales at the present time under a free-trade tariff—
Colonel Smith : Under what?
Sir JOHN BRAY : Under a so-called free-trade
free-trade tariff—amount to a very large sum—£l
14s. fid. per head.
Mr. Munro : It is about £2,000,000 altogether in
New South Wales now—£l,9oo,ooo !
Sir JOHN BRAY: Taking that as the basis on
which our customs duties will be raised in the future,
we have not provided anything like enough duties for
the federal government to absorb such a sum. We
are not going to have free-trade, and at the same time
establish an elaborate system of checks on goods pass-
ing from one colony to another, so as to ascertain


what the duties which each colony would be supposed
to contribute are. We shall lose the benefit of feder-
ation if we attempt anything of that kind. I there-
fore ask hon. members to agree that if there is a
surplus it shall be returned to the colonies on the
basis of population, and to assume that if we have
uniform customs duties, they will bear equally upon
the people of Australia, or if we go in for direct tax-
ation, we shall devise a scheme which will bear fairly
upon them, and that we ought, if possible, to avoid
giving the federal government control of a large
amount of revenue not required for the purposes of the
commonwealth. However careful the senate and the
house of representatives may be, we shall inevitably
find that a government with a large surplus will
develop a system of waste and extravagance, and we
must, therefore, saddle the commonwealth with an ex-
penditure that will be something like proportionate to
the revenue intrusted to them to expend. In the first
instance, I ask hon. members to agree to strike out the
words whch I have indicated, and 1 shall subsequently
ask them to declare that the commonwealth shall be
liable for the debts of the different states, and that
each state shall be liable to contribute to the common-
wealth, besides a certain sum, the amount of its liability
beyond that sum.
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH : I have a prior
amendment to make. I move :
That in line 3, after the word “ commonwealth,” the words
“ which shall be charged to the separate states in proportion
to the numbers of their people ” be inserted.
Hon. delegates will see that in this part of the clause
the drafters of the bill have departed from the recom-
mendation of the Finance Committee, though I do not
understand the reason for that.
Mr. Munro ; In the whole of the clause ?
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH : No; one part of
the clause is quite in accordance with the committee’s
recommendation; but that part to which I am now
referring, with the omission of the words which I wish
to insert, is quite inconsistent with the proposal of the
committee. I would draw attention to a paragraph
in the first page of their report, which reads thus :
It is therefore recommended that the revenue from customs
and excise be devoted, first, to the payment of all expenditure
authorised by the federal government, such expenditure to be
charged to the several colonies according to population.
Hon. members will see that the clause departs alto-
gether from this recommendation, which says that the
revenue of the commonwealth shall in the first instance
be applied to the payment of the expenditure of the
commonwealth, that supposing revenue to the extent
of £8,000,000 is raised by the federal government,
the whole expenditure of the federal executive is taken
from that lump sum, and the balance is distributed by
this clause, not according to population, as recom-
mended by the committee, but in proportion to the
amount contributed by each colony, which is a perfectly
different thing altogether and very unfair, and I have
got the Government Statistician to compute the effect
of distributing the money in this way. The method
by which the colonies are to be charged is by a per-
centage on the taking of the customs in each colony,
which will be different in each colony because the
contributions will be different. We shall not all pay
the same amount per head, as we should by the recom-
mendation of the committee. The average cost of the
government of the different colonies is 11s. sd. per
head of the population. The bill, as it at present
stands, however, would make them pay something
quite different to that amount. I have had a calculation
made out, based on the understanding that the Victorian
tariff should be universally adopted, and the result is
that instead of New South Wales paying 11s. fid. per
head of her population she would pay 13s. Id. ; that
instead of Victoria paying 11s. fid. she would pay 12s.
4d. ; that instead of Queensland paying 11s. fid. she
would pay 15s. 4d.; that South Australia would pay
only Bs. 4d. instead of 11s. fid.; that Western Australia
would pay 12s. 2d. instead of 11s. fid.; that Tasmania
would pay 10s. 6d. instead of 11s. fid., and that New
Zealand would pay 9s. Id. instead of 11s. fid. I
should like to see some very good reason given why one
colony is more difficult to govern than another colony,
according to population. The principle was affirmed
by the Finance Committee, without demur, that
the cost of government should be charged accord-
ing to population; but the manner in which it is
now proposed to be charged will, unless my amend-
ment is carried, have the effect I have stated. Why
should that be ? Can it be shown that there is that
difference in the cost of the government of the various
colonies to which I have referred 1 I can see no
reason why it should be so. If there is any reason to
be given it ought to be given by some member of the
Finance Committee. The principle that the cost
should be in proportion to the population was not
demurred to by the committee, and why it should
have been altered I cannot understand. That is all I
have to say at present in reference to the amendment.
Of course, I shall have to refer to the methods alluded
to by the hon. member, Sir John Bray, at a later
stage.
Sir John Bray : We do not require the words
proposed to be inserted by the hon. member at all.
The commonwealth collects the revenue ; they expend
what they want for the purposes of the common-
wealth, and they return the balance.
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH : Quite so; but I
have given reasons, I think, why the words are
required. I have shown that the provision in the
clause will fall very unequally upon the different
colonies, and that it will not carry out the recom-
mendation of the Finance Committee. Take the
converse proposition. Supposing the committee had
met, and the Convention had not previously decided
that the federal parliament was not to have the
administration of the whole of the customs, would any
proposal have been arrived at other than that each
colony should contribute to the general government
according to population 1 That is all I want them to
do—to contribute according to population, and not
according to the amount of revenue raised. Supposing
we had taken another course and had said, “We will
place the revenues from the pastoral lessees of the
colonies in the hands of the general government,”
would that have been fair! I should think that the
pastoral lessees are pretty well worked out in Victoria;
but the rents from pastoral leases form an important
part of the revenue of Queensland ; and if a course of
that kind had been adopted, and it had been decided
that general expenses should be paid out of this kind
of revenue, we should find that Queensland, through
her pastoral lessees, would have to pay the great part
of the expenses of the government of the country.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : The hon. member,
Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, has asked why so great a
departure was made from the reconimendation of the
Finance Committee, and, no doubt, the matter requires
explanation. 1 will endeavour to state the arguments
as they presented themselves to the Constitutional
Committee when they had to deal with this matter.
The drafting committee took the report of the
Finance Committee and embodied it in the bill exactly
in the terms in which it was brought up. By that
proposal all the surplus revenue over the expenditure
of the commonwealth after the imposition of a uniform
tariff was to be paid back to the several states in
proportion to the numbers of their people. I hat course
involved that the expenditure should be in the same
proportion, because what is retained would be in the
same proportion as that which is given back. There
is no doubt about that. If you define the principle
upon which the return is to be made you also define
the principle upon which the expenditure is to be
borne. That recommendation of the Finance Com


mittee, however, dealt only with the customs and
excise duties. When we came to deal with the matter
in the Constitutional Committee we found that,
having proposed to give parliament absolute powers
of taxation, we were bound to deal with the possibility
that they should raise revenue from other sources than
customs; and the only way in which we could see it
was fair to return direct taxation was in proportion to
the amount raised. It was pointed out, in reference
to some particular branches of taxation, that the
burden would fall almost wholly upon certain states.
My hon. colleague has given the case of revenue from
pastoral properties. We took the case of a stock-tax
or a gold-tax, which are burdens which would fall very
unequally on different colonies. It is quite fair, there-
fore, that these would not be returned according to
population.
Sir John Bray ; It would not be fair to raise them
for federal purposes !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH; Still it might be
necessary to raise them for federal purposes. The
hon. member will see that we have to face contingen-
cies. The hon. member assumes that we are going to
live on a protective tariff. That is very likely ; but
it is equally conceivable that our successors may be of
a different opinion to us, and may resort to other
methods of taxation. I object to argue on the assump-
tion that all knowledge is with us. I think that only
limited knowledge is with us, and that we must, at
least, admit the possibility of our successors being as
wise, or wiser, than we are.
Mr. Munro : They will have more information
before them !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : That is so. This is
the difficulty which met us. It being clear that, as to
some portions of revenue, at any rate, the return should
be in proportion to the amounts in which it is received
—in proportion to the contributions of the different
states—we felt it hard to justify charging the cost of
government at per head. Ido not know that this
point was very much considered ; but it certainly
appeared to be an anomally that you should return
the money upon one basis and charge the expenditure
upon another. In those colonies from which the
contribution per head is greatest the cost of government
is usually greatest too, for very much the same state
of society as induces a larger contribution per head—
certainly of customs—involves an increased cost of
government per head. lam indicating the arguments
that occurred to the Constitutional Committee. We
had a great deal of difficulty in coming to any satis-
factory solution of the matter ; but at last we modified
the recommendations in the report of the Finance
Committee which had been embodied in the bills before
us by making a more general provision with respect
to all revenue. The Finance Committee themselves
were of opinion that this was the proper rule until
there was a uniform tariff. Then, why does it cease
to be fair afterwards 1 I recognise that it will be very
inconvenient afterwards.
Mr. Burgess : On account of the percentage of duties
paid in the various colonies !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : If they were likely to
be equal in the several colonies, the system per head
of the population would be the proper one. Are they
likely to be equal, 1 ?
Mr. Burgess : Bound to be in the course of time !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I say that they are
absolutely certain to be unequal, when you consider
the different conditions of various parts of Australia—
as unequal afterwards as before. That will be found
from the tables worked out by the Finance Committee.
It is not a uniformity of tariff that will bring about
a uniformity of product. We knew also that on the
system of return per head, South Australia would get
back a great deal more than she ever contributed
without any deduction whatever for the cost of govern-
ment. That colony would get back all the customs
revenue paid by her people, and a great deal more,
and never contribute a farthing towards the cost of
government. Having that before our eyes, could we
bring up a bill formally proposing such a scheme 1
We could not expect to keep it secret. The public
would want to know how it was worked out; and,
with those facts before us, we were bound to depart
from the report of the Finance Committee. This
matter had our anxious consideration a whole even-
ing, and was discussed from many points of view.
The proposal in the bill seems to be fair. It involves
inconvenience ; but let hon. members weigh the
inconvenience and injustice of any rival scheme,
and say on which side is the balance of incon-
venience. There is inconvenience on either side.
There is great inconvenience on this, but no injustice ;
on the other side, there is less inconvenience, but
there is the greatest injustice. I would sooner take
the inconvenience than the injustice. We must be
quite clear what we are doing in this matter, because
a mistake made in settling this basis will involve the
rejection of the constitution by any colony that is
unfairly treated by it. The desire for federation is not
so great that people will submit to manifest injustice;
and I do not think that the people of Queensland
would care to pay South Australia’s share of the cost
of the government of the commonwealth, and give
them a handsome subsidy per head as well.
Mr. Playford : We do not want anything but
what is fair !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I am sure that my
hon. friend, Mr. Playford, does not want anything
unfair ; but we must be able to demonstrate that this
is fair and is likely to work out fairly. I rose parti-
cularly to answer the challenge given by my hon.
colleague—to explain why we departed so far from the
Finance Committee’s report—and I hope I have suc-
ceeded in doing so.
Sir THOMAS MoILWRAITH : I understand the
hon. gentleman’s argument to be that the committee
admitted there was a great difference in the cost of
government in the different colonies. From what facts
did they conclude that there was such a difference in the
costof government in the different colonies that in South
Australia it would be Bs. 4d. and in Queensland 15s. 4d.
per head 1 They had not the facts before them.
Mr. Playford :
Sir THOMAS MoILWRAITH : I could have quite
imagined such a sentimental argument coming from my
hon. friend, the Premier of Victoria.
Mr. Munro ; Oh dear, no !
Sir THOMAS MoILWRAITH : Not that the hon.
member would believe in that argument, although he
would say the great bulk of these customs duties are
contributed by people who drink whiskey and that
sort of thing—and therefore, the more customs duties
they pay, the more gaols and reformatories we shall
want That is a sentimental argument; but it is not
used by sentimentalists, and how can it be used by an
astute lawyer like the Hon. the Premier of Queens-
land 1 What we want to know is, first—is it a true
proposition that we should contribute towards the
expenses of government in proportion to population ?
Let us settle that. I want to know if that is true 1
There has never been any dissent from it in the
Finance Committee, nor have I heard any one dissent
from that proposition.
Mr. Playford : That is done on an imaginary tariff!
Sir THOMAS MoILWRAITH: If that is admitted
to be true, you have to charge each colony according
to its population towards the general expenditure, and
return it the balance which it has contributed to the
general state. That is what we want to do. We want
to return the actual balance.
Colonel Smith : And charge each one alike !
Sir THOMAS MoILWRAITH ; No, hand them
back the actual balance. If one colony has contri-
buted £2 10s. a head through their customs, and-if it


is ascertained that the cost of the general govern-
ment is 10s. a head, we should return them £2 , If
another colony has constributed £3, and 10s. per
head is deducted from it towards the cost of general
government, we should return them <£2 10s. Is that
not absolutely fair ? I will put it in another way,
for I heard the hon. member, Mr. Playford, say,
“ This is done on an imaginary tariff.” It is not an
imaginary tariff. These calculations were based on
the Victorian tariff, but if anybody objects to them
the same calculations were made by the hon. member,
Mr. McMillan, months ago, and he had them when I
came here ; for when I went for the same information
I found that he had it, and I got it the next day.
This is one of the suppressed tables which I think
never should have been suppressed, for they bear so
directly on the argument before us. It is a remark-
able thing that every table that bears on that has
been suppressed. It is called table “ H,” and the
heading of it is “ Revenue which would be derived
from each province if in addition to duties on alco-
holic drinks, tobacco, opium, &c., duties equal to 13
per cent, ad valorem were levied on foreign produce
imported.” I think these calculations are the idea of
the Colonial Treasurer—at all events, they were
worked out by the Government Statistician. The
way they got a general ad valorem duty of 13 per
cent, was this : they put fixed duties on all such
things as spirits, opium, tobacco, and so forth, and
they chose a tariff which would, on the general impor-
tations, give the full amount of the contributions
through customs for the previous year. That they
found to be 13 per cent., and if they had the
whole of that there would be a universal tariff of 13
per cent. This is how it works out: If the principle
of the bill, so far as regards the clause that I am
seeking to amend, is carried out, and the colonies pay
for the general government according to their contri-
butions through this tariff, and not according to
population, New South Wales, instead of paying 11s.
5d., would pay 12s. 6d.; Victoria, 135.; Queensland,
145.; South Australia, ss. 3d.; Western Australia,
18s. Id.; Tasmania, Bs. 6d.; and New Zealand, 11s. 4d.
Mr. Douglas : On what calculation is that based ?
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH: On the tariff they
have explained.
Sir John Bray : An imaginary tariff!
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH: An imaginary
tariff—a tariff of the actual existing fixed duties on
spirits and tobacco and an imaginary tariff of 13 per
cent, on the importations, which will bring it up to
the tariffs as they exist now. I know well that you
get different results from different tariffs; but it is
impossible to make a tariff of general application in
the colonies that will not come out with the same
results, and that is to prove that making the colonies
contribute to the general expenditure according to
the amount of their customs revenue is a wrong prin-
ciple, will be unequal, will depart from the principle
of payment according to population, and will fall very
heavily on some of the colonies —for instance, on
Queensland and Western Australia. Hon. members
say it is an imaginary tariff when I use the Victorian
tariff, and it is an imaginary tariff when I take a
tariff made up by the Government Statistician. I
should like to know how they can get at the effects
or results unless in this way? We have to fancy
something that will be done, and see what the result
will be. That is clearly proved as far as this part of
the clause is concerned. Ido not want to go into the
facts referred to by the hon. member, Sir John Bray,
because that would lead very likely to a longer debate.
But this is a much simpler matter. The simplicity of
it is tb at each colony shall pay according to its popu-
lation, and after its proportion of the general ex-
penditure is deducted, the actual balance of its con-
tribution shall be handed back, and not an average be
made of all the colonies.
Mr. BURGESS : The hon. member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, asked the Committee just now why the com-
mittee recommended a different course being taken,
when we had a federal tariff, from that which we re-
commend at the present time. If the hon. member
will refer to the table that has been printed showing
the incidence of the customs duties now levied in
Australasia he will at once see that is was absolutely
necessary, as a matter of justice, until the federal
tariff came into operation, that the balance, after the
payment of the general expenses, should be returned
in proportion to the amount raised. Now, for instance,
let me take two colonies, New South Wales and Vic-
toria, practically with the same population. Victoria
raises £2,890,000 under her tariff, while New South
Wales raises only £1,900,000. It would be, therefore
very unfair to say that at the present time, with
varied tariffs —tariffs showing that in one colony you
collect only £1 14s. 6d. per head, whilst in another
colony the amount is over £4 per head —the unex-
pended balance should be returned to each colony in
proportion to its population. The committee thought
that after the federal tariff had come into operation
it would then be fair not only to charge the whole
of the expenses of the federal government against
the customs and excise revenue, but also to distribute
the balance on the basis of population. I think that as
the hon. member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, has referred
to the way in which South Australia would be benefited,
it would be well to look at the other side of the ques-
tion. Let us deal with the question we have absolutely
before us. The hon. member proposes that the ex-
penses shall be charged at per head of the population.
If we do that, what shall we find ? We shall find that
South Australia, in connection with her postal and
telegraph service alone, will be giving up a revenue of
over £30,000 per annum, whilst Queensland will be
benefited at the expense of the federal government, on
that service alone, to the extent of over £113,000.
That is not much, the hon. gentleman says; but if he
will just take the trouble to look into the figures on
the basis of a population of 422,000 persons, he will
see that it means something like ss. per head of the
population of Queensland, the payment of which will
be taken over by the federal government, and the
inhabitants of the colony will be relieved to that ex-
tent. And so it is with other colonies in other ways.
The average cost of defence, I find, is to be 3s. 3d. per
head. In some of the colonies—in Victoria, for
instance—the defence force costs now 6s. 3d. per head,
so that there again that colony will be relieved to the
extent of 3s. per head in connection with its taxation.
Take, again, the postal service of that colony. I think
the present loss is something like £50,000 per annum,
and the committee calculated in their estimate that,
with the reduced postage to the United Kingdom, that
amount would be increased to over £BO,OOO per annum.
In considering all these matters, the committee thought
that, while they were prepared to recommend that the
various colonies should be relieved of those charges, on
the other hand, they should share in the general bene-
fits which would be derived from the establishment
of a uniform tariff. These, sir, were the reasons
which actuated the committee in making the recom-
mendations which they did; and I maintain that
if you decide that, after the federal tariff is estab-
lished, the expenses shall be charged on one basis, and
the balance returned on an altogether different basis—
I maintain that if you depart from the recommenda-
tions of the Finance Committee, you will act in defiance
of the resolution of the Convention, that trade and
commerce between the federated colonies shall be
absolutely free, and you will altogether intensify the
annoyances and embarrass trade more than it has ever
been embarrassed in the past. I think that, viewed
as a matter of absolute fairness to all the colonies, it
is right that, if we are prepared to take over the whole
of the responsibilities by which we relieve some colonies,


we should be equally prepared to distribute the unex-
pended balance, and possibly benefit those that have
been injured in some other way.
Sir JOHN DOWNER : It is rather difficult to deal
with the proposal now before us, without dealing with
the whole question. It is quite impossible to consider
the question as to the distribution of the expenditure
of the government, without also dealing with the other
question as to the manner in which any surplus revenue
—which is quite certain to accrue—is to be disposed
of. The proposal of the hon. member is that we should
distribute the expenditure according to population and
the surplus according to contribution, and he has
quoted figures to show the exceedingly unjust incidence
of any proposal such as is contained in the bill as
brought before the committee, and which follows the
report of the Finance Committee. The hon. mem-
ber took South Australia and Queensland as two
extreme cases, and he made the Queensland contribu-
tion 15s. 4d., and the South Australian Bs. 4d. But
he did not take into consideration the other matters
referred to by the hon. member, Mr. Burgess, and
that when the post-offices and other institutions are
taken over, the incidence would adjust itself, because,
as the hon. member, Mr. Burgess, pointed out,
Queensland, by the giving up of her post-offices, would
gain at once 55., reducing her contribution to 10s. 4d.
South Australia, on the other hand, would immediately
lose 25., instead of getting a profit of £30,000 at the
rate of 2s. per head of her population, and the result
would be that, so far from the colony being placed in
an advantageous position in comparison with Queens-
land, both colonies would be placed in identically the
same position. Surely the hon. member cannot seri-
ously propose that one rule is to be applied to the dis-
tribution of the expenditure, and another to the distri-
bution of the surplus. But there is something which,
as it appears to me, is altogether above and beyond
this, and that is the question as to whether we seriously
mean to have any federation at all. I have heard
many hon. members, and particularly the hon. member,
Sir Henry Parkes, speak most strongly of the terrible
position in which the colonies were placed through the
interference between them created by the customs-
houses on their borders. Those customs-houses may
be as great a curse to the colonies as hon. gentlemen
have described them to be; but, at all events, they
are established only for the purpose of each state pro-
tecting itself against individuals, possibly within its
own boundaries, and possibly in other states. Now we
are asked to agree to something still more invidious
than the custom-houses to which hon. members object,
inasmuch as each state would have to protect itself,
not against individuals within its own borders, or in
other communities, but directly against the other states.
We should initiate this federation, the basis of which
is to be a kindly and friendly feeling throughout
Australia, with states having mutual distrust of one
another, and having to impose barriers far more mis-
chievous in their operations than the custom-houses
which now exist. The representatives of the larger
colonies who take this view also forget
Mr. MUNRO : We have not expressed our views !
Sir JOHN DOWNER : I do not know what view
the hon. member, Mr. Munro, takes; but Ido know
that the hon. gentleman has certain views upon the
matter, and as far as each of the larger colonies is
concerned, if they object to the just and equal method
recommended by the Finance Committee, and if they
can show that in its immediate incidence some loss or
inequality might arise, so far as a particular colony is
concerned, I would ask them to recollect one other
thing, that is, the strong disposition to centralisation
everywhere—the strong inclination of every one to go
to the largest centre of population. When these
customs barriers are removed, undoubtedly, as the
hon. member, Sir John Bray, has said, the smaller
colonies will obtain their goods, to a much larger
extent than at present, from the larger centres.
Therefore, a large portion of the benefit of this
arrangement must be reaped by the larger colonies ;
so that, even if they sustain some incidental loss,
it will be much more than made up to them by
their commanding position, and the attractions that
would offer to the population of Australia generally.
Having listened to the hon. member, Sir Thomas
Mcllwraith, and looked at his figures, I do not think
there is any reason for departing from the report of
the Finance Committee. Apart from that altogether,
with such shifting communities, one colony having
most population one day, and another colony having
most population a little afterwards, it would be
inexpedient for us to endeavour to make any
arrangement based on the assumption that the relation
of the population of the colonies to each other will
continue as at present. From every point of view—
from the grand national point of view on which this
federation is endeavoured to be launched, from the
point of view of the interest of the commonwealth,
from the point of view of mutual good feeling between
the states, from every consideration that patriotism
and public feeling could urge—we should start on the
basis which the Finance Committee recommended,
recognising in this distribution nothing but population,
and restore the clause which the Finance Committee
recommended, and which was inserted in the bill when
it came before the Constitutional Committee.
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH : The hon. member,
Sir John Downer, has just made a speech which I
would have made myself. I do not want to do anything
else in my amendment than to stand by the recom-
mendation of the Finance Committee
Sir John Downer : Then that is all right!
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH : That has been my
contention all through, and hon. members must have
misunderstood me. The amendment I have moved is
to insert certain words after the word “common-
wealth ”
Sir John Downer: So far I agree with the hon.
member!
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH ; In order to com-
ply with the recommendation of the Finance Commit-
tee :
That the revenue from customs and excise be devoted first
to the payment of all expenditure authorised by the federal
government, such expenditure to be charged to the several
colonies according to population.
That is the whole of my amendment at the present
time. I do not wish to propose any more.
Sir John Downer : The hon. member does not want
the other !
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH : I am not going
to pledge myself to support Sir John Bray’s amend-
ment. I shall have other facts to bring forward on
that. I am not opposing the recommendation of the
Finance Committee.
Sir John Bray : That is what the hon. member is
doing!
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH: I take the first
recommendation of the committee, and say we should
carry that out. I have declined to reply to the hon.
member, Sir John Bray, until his motion is brought
forward, when I will be prepared to give my reasons.
Sir JOHN DOWNER: I knew what the hon.
member meant, because there was a telegram before
the Constitutional Committee representing the hon,
member’s views in an unmistakable manner, and I
have no reason to think that he has since changed his
opinion.
Mr. McMILLAN : I think most hon. members
will recognise that this is one of the most difficult
questions which have come before the Convention.
The difficulty arises out of this : No matter what
arrangement you may make, it will not be an abso-
lutely symmetrical arrangement. There is no arrange-
ment conceivable which will work at the present time,


and which will work equitably in the future under
other conditions. I think it was due to the Conven-
tion that the hon. member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith,
should have stated that this is an amendment on
which there would be a consequential amendment ;
because we are liable to debate two absolutely incon-
gruous things. The question is: Are we going back to
the position of the Finance Committee, or do we intend
to accept this as a whole, or only partially 1 There
are actually three propositions before us —first, the
proposition of the hon. member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith,
amending the first part of this clause and leaving the
second part to stand as it is. Then there is the propo-
sition that we should take the bill as it stands. There
is a third proposition, that after making the amendment
proposed by the hon. member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith,
we should go right back to the original report of the
Finance Committee. We should have the issue
clearly before us at present. The recommendation
of the Finance Committee was this : that we should
practically take the basis of population all through.
We debated the question whether that was fair under
existing circumstances, and we made a provision by
which existing circumstances should be dealt with on
a separate basis, leaving it open afterwards to the
federal parliament to go back to the population basis.
That was the position taken up by the Finance
Committee. Personally, as far as I am concerned,
although there might be some inequality and apparent
injustice to my own colony or to another, I thoroughly
agree with the hon. member, Sir John Downer, that if
we are going to federate at all we must accept these
inequalities. But it seems to me that it would be
better, perhaps, as a whole, if this amendment of the
hon. member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, be accepted, to
go right back to the population basis. I know very
well that that population basis would have a very
curious effect with regard to South Australia. In
fact, according to a set of figures which were made
out, South Australia would get its government, to a
certain extent, very cheaply. At the same time, we
must have some kind of symmetry, even if it turns
out to be unequal in its incidence. As the colonies
increase in volume, a great deal of inequality will
disappear, and I would very much prefer the hon.
member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, to declare that he
wishes to restore in toto the recommendation of the
Finance Committee. That would be absolutely fair,
and at the same time it would leave it open for the
parliament of the future to carry out arrangements on
the most equitable lines according to their mature
consideration.
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH : I have not the
slightest hesitation in declaring that I am perfectly
prepared to stand by the recommendation of 'the
Finance Committee,
Sir John Bray: That is all I want!
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH: But what is that
recommendation 1
Sir John Bray; I will show what it is !
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH : I know that the
hon. member is going to put a construction on the
report on account of two or three words which were
omitted after I had left the committee—that is, that
the whole arrangement is to be changed after a uniform
tariff is established.
Sir J ohn Bray : That is the report of the committee!
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH: That is the report
1 do not agree with. The hon. member, Sir John
Bray, will remember the position in which it stood.
J lie whole of the latter part of the recommendation
was mine. The hon. member, Sir John Bray, put
forward a further recommendation, and I said, “Well,
I have no objection to that.” That forms the first
four lines of the sth paragraph of the report, and in
the hon. member, Sir John Bray’s manuscript there
occurred the words “a few years” or “ some years.”
Sir John Bray: The words were “some time after”!
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH : I will take those
words, and the recommendation read in this way :
“ That some time after a uniform tariff has come into
operation the surplus revenue may fairly be distributed
amongst the various colonies according to population.”
I said that I agreed to that at once. I admit the
principle that a time will come when the populations
of all, the colonies will approximate. I urged that
myself, and had no hesitation whatever, nor have I
any hesitation now, in saying that the principle on
which I insist shall be revised by the federal govern-
ment at any time within five, ten, or fifteen years.
That is what I said at the meeting of the committee.
But it is a very different thing to say that as soon as
a uniform tariff is arranged it shall have a certain
effect, that is, that the surplus shall be distributed
according to population. That I never agreed to, nor
did any member of the committee advocate it. The
hon. member, Sir John Bray, did not advocate it. His
own words were that after some years the time would
come when we might fairly distribute any surplus
according to population ; but the time has not yet
come to do it.
Sir JOHN BRAY: It was unfortunate for the
Finance Committee that the hon. member, Sir Thomas
Mcllwraith, had to leave when he did; but if he is
content to accept the recommendation of the Finance
Committee which was included in the first draft bill
prepared by the Constitutional Committee, I shall be
satisfied. I felt, and we all felt, dissatisfied with the
proposal that we were to estimate the revenue of each
colony, charge so much per head for the cost of govern-
ment, and return the surplus in that way. No one
was satisfied with that proposal. No definite proposal
was submitted for some time to overcome the difficulty;
but at last we got one, the words of which are in the
report:
That after a uniform tariff has come into operation the sur-
plus revenue may fairly be distributed amongst the various
colonies according to population.
That is all I ask the Committee to agree to. When a
uniform tariff is adopted we have to assume that that
tariff is based in such a way as to fall fairly upon the
whole of the people of Australia, and also that it will
not be necessary to keep a check as to the goods cross-
ing each border, so as to be able to reckon up the
amount of dutiable goods consumed in each colony.
If we have to do this we shall lose half the advantages
of federation and destroy the benefits of intercolonial
free-trade. If trade between the colonies is to be as
this bill provides, in language as clear as any that can
be used, absolutely free from one end of the continent
to the other, it is utterly inconsistent with that idea
to have an army of customs officers, or whatever else
you may call them, to find out the value of the goods
sent from one colony to another. If there is to be
free-trade there should be no inquiry, and no means of
ascertaining the amount of dutiable goods consumed
in each colony. Perhaps it will simplify the matter
if, instead of proposing the amendment in the way in
which I did, I am allowed to propose, in lieu of clauses
9 and 10, the draft clause prepared by the Constitutional
Committee, and 1 will do that, with the permission of
hon. members, when the amendment of Sir Thomas
Mcllwraith is disposed of. That clause is as follows :
9. After the imposition of such uniform duties the surplus-
revenue derived from duties of customs and duties of excise
on goods the subject of customs duties, remaining over and
above the necessary expenditure of the commonwealth, shall
be paid to the several states in proportion to the numbers of
their people. Such payments shall be made monthly, or at
such intervals as may be deemed expedient.
That is clause 9of the first draft bill. Then it goes on
to provide that in the meantime after these uniform
duties have been imposed the revenue is to be applied
in the way suggested by the hon, member. Whilst
the duties are unequal, whilst the people of one colony
are paying more than the people of another, they are
fairly entitled to any surplus revenue obtained from.


them according to the amount which they pay. I
will move that, as it simplifies matters and means the
same thing. It will come more clearly to hon. members,
and will convey exactly the recommendation of the
Finance Committee, which seemed to meet with the
approval of the Constitution Committee in the first
instance, I presume that it will be necessary first to
dispose of the amendment now before the Committee.
I would ask the hon. member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith,
to consider this : If the idea of a commonwealth for
the people of Australia is to consist in making each
colony pay so much per head in proportion to popula-
tion, then the idea of this free interchange of goods
and uniform customs tariff is perfectly unnecessary.
There is a much simpler way of getting so much
per head than saying, “We will take away f frorn you
the right to impose customs duties, we will impose
duties for the benefit of the whole people of Australia,
we will reckon up how much your colony pays separ-
ately for the benefit of Australia, and return to you as
much as we assume you have paid on the basis of your
population.” I say that any figures made up on this
idea will be utterly unreliable, will cause great dis-
satisfaction, and break down all attempts to establish
a commonwealth.
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH ; If I were in the
happy position of the hon. member, of advocating the
cause of a colony that was going to benefit so largely,
I should appeal with the same happy smile to my
opponent to take my view of his actions without find-
ing it necessary to urge any reason. But being placed
where I am, and having to defend my action, knowing
that my constituents will ask the reason for the votes
I have given, I want to be changed by reason, not
by an appeal in such general terms as that which
the hon. member has made. Why did we not hear
this appeal in the Financial Committee? There were
only two general propositions before it until I left,
I was only absent one day, and we had arranged
everything. The hon, member, Sir John Bray,
agreed to put the whole of his recommendations
alongside of mine, and the committee did not disagree
with that. After I had left they made a very material
change in the whole thing by leaving out what I always
insisted on—that the change should take place only
after a certain time. But the whole of the facts
pointed to one thing, and that was that at the present
time it would be unequal to all the colonies—in fact,
politically iniquitous —to apply the principle that the
hon. member was in favour of at that time. Now, what
is the principle which he is advocating at the present
time in his very mild way ? I wish he had brought
forward the facts which were before the committee,
and which satisfied them. We had figures in the tables
which have been left out of the report of the committee,
and which influenced the committee most materially in
coming to a conclusion. They produced a report which
showed the effect of the uniform tariff on the impor-
tations of the colony in 1889, the latest date to which
the statistics were at the disposal of the Government
Statistician. We had that table before us, and this
is what that table meant. Of course there have been
discx-epancies found which altered the figures to some
extent, but which do not alter the principle. I ought
to have prefaced my remarks by saying that I am
forced into this discussion, which is quite alien to the
amendment which I have proposed, by the continual
attempt made by other delegates to force the discus-
sion on their proposed amendments. I have been
always restraining myself in speaking about my
own amendment, and I ought not to be liable to attack
from the Colonial Treasurer of New South Wales
for not having declared what I intended to do in
reference to another amendment. I have not the
slightest hesitation in declaring that I mean to
oppose it. I would have given that answer at once
if I had been asked. I had no intention of sup-
pressing my opinion on the subject, but I did not
express it because it had nothing to do with the amend-
ment with which I was dealing. The hon. member,
Sir John Bray, in bringing forward this bigger ques-
tion, is confusing the matter. My amendment was a
very simple matter; his is a bigger question, and it
forces me to go into that question, although in so
doing I am going away from the subject of debate.
The result of that information, which we had before
us for 1889, was that, according to this uniform tariff,
after each colony had contributed pro raid in propor-
tion to population to the expenses of the central
government, and had had the amount of the surplus
returned to it according to population, New South
Wales, instead of paying 12s. per head for the expense
of government, would have paid 14s. 2d.; Victoria,
instead of paying 125., would have paid 16s. Id. ;
Queensland, instead of 125., would have paid 19s. lOd. ;
South Australia, instead of paying 125., would have
paid nothing whatever ; she would have got the whole
of her customs revenue back, and, in addition, a con-
tribution from the fund of 11s. per head of popula-
tion. This is how this principle would work, of dis-
tributing the surplus according to population. Western
Australia, instead of paying 12s. for the cost of govern-
ment, would have paid £1 15s. Bd., the largest contri-
bution of all. Tasmania is in the same happy position
as South Australia; she gets back the whole of her
customs revenue, and Is. 6d. per head of her popula-
tion as a bonus from the other colonies. New Zealand
is in a sort of medium position ; she pays 9s. 5d.,
instead of 125., to the cost of the general government.
Sir Samuel Griffith : What would Western Aus-
tralia have to pay ?
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH: She would have
to pay £1 15s. Bd.
Mr. Burgess : This is all imaginary !
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH : Hon. gentlemen
will insist upon saying that it is imaginary; but we have
to suppose a tariff, to see what the effect of it will be.
I have worked out the facts with regard to the
Victorian tariff, and they bear me out in ray argu-
ment. It is possible that a tariff like the Victorian
tariff may be adopted. 1 do not say that I will
advocate it. I do not express an opinion as to the
advisability of a tariff of that sort. But what I say
is that if the Victorian tariff is adopted, it will bring
about results approximating to thoselhave enumerated.
Sir John Bray : No !
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH : I will give the
hon. gentleman the figures, which will be distributed
in print in the course of half an hour. According to
those figures, South Australia does not appear as what
I might call a defaulter to the extent that she does at
present; but she is still pretty low down in the list.
We shall have to contribute a certain amount to her
out of our revenue, and make her a present besides
of the whole of her customs revenue. Hon. members
will ask, how does this come about ? It is quite easy
to see how it comes about. The South Australian
tariff, considering the amount of duties on specific
articles and ad valorem duties, is far the heaviest in
the Australian colonies —I am not quite sure about
New Zealand, I have not given her tariff very much
attention; but then it does not produce anything.
What is the use of putting a duty of £5 on a silk
gown, if no one wears a silk gown—if only cotton
gowns are worn ? What is the use of placing a duty
of 14s. a gallon on good Scotch whiskey when the
people swill their own acidulated wines ? The tariff,
as I say, does not produce anything. That is how it
comes about that the figures are so frightfully unequal.
Is it not very absurd to say we will return the contri-
butions according to population, while South Australia
has paid so little in proportion to its population into
the general fund ? Then look at another table which
was suppressed, and which bears so minutely on this
subject—table H. The Colonial Treasurer of New


South Wales led us to believe—l think unwittingly—
that he had only suppressed the tables that applied to
the Victorian tariff.
Sir John Bray: Only the imaginary tables. The
actual facts were given !
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH: With regard to
the tables being imaginary, I repeat again that it is
only by imagining a probable or possible tariff that
you can arrive at the facts. I have no objection, as
I told Sir John Bray in the Finance Committee, to
take any tariff' he proposes. I suggested that we should
take the. tariffs of all the colonies; but this was not
agreed to, because the Government Statistician objected
that the preparation of such a table would take too
much time. I did not anticipate that this Committee
would sit so long, and I regret that we did not have
the information furnished. But let us take table H,
which was suppressed. It is very interesting. It
shows the “ revenue which would be derived from each
province if, in addition to duties on alcoholic drinks,
tobacco, opium, &c., duties equal to 13 per cent, ad
valorem were levied on foreign produce imported.”
The average amount raised by the whole of the Aus-
tralian colonies is £2 6s. 4d. per inhabitant. Deducting
12s. from that, the amount contributed by the different
colonies is very unequal. New South Wales contri-
butes £2 Bs. sd. ; Victoria, £2 10s. 4d. ; Queensland,
£2 14s. 2d.; South Australia—this is the cause of the
enthusiasm—£l3s. 4d.; Western Australia,£3 9s.lid.;
Tasmania, £1 12s. lOd.—there is a little mild enthu-
siasm in that quarter too ; New Zealand, £2 3s. Bd.
That makes an average of £2 6s. 4d. If we deduct
from the amount raised per head by the different
colonies the sum of 125., the cost of the federal
government—lls. sd. is the actual amount, but I have
taken a lump sum ; it does not affect the argument—
the result is an average amount to be returned out of
the surplus of £1 14s. 4d. per head of the population.
The full amount to which New South Wales is entitled
—that is, if she gets back the real balance due from the
amount she has contributed to the customs—is £2 Bs. 5d.,
which, less 125., would leave £1 16s. 5d., instead of
£1 14s. 4d. She contributes, therefore, a bonus to
South Australia and Tasmania of 2s. Id. per head of
her population. Victoria contributes about double
the amount. She ought to get back £1 18s. 4d., and
according to population she only receives £1 14s. 4d.,
or 4s. less than she is entitled to. Queensland, accord-
ing to the principle agreed to by the committee, ought
to get back £2 2s. 2d., instead of which she only
receives, according to population, £1 14s. 4d., or
7s. lOd. per head less than she is entitled to. South
Australia actually gets back all her customs and £1 3s.
per head of the population in addition.
Mr. Playford : The figures must be wrong. South
Australia cannot get back £1 3s. per head in addition
to the £600,000 which would be raised from customs
revenue !
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH : If the hon.
gentleman will wait until I have finished the table,
I will allow him to reply. There is no doubt what-
ever about South Australia getting this money back.
Western Australia will raise £3 9s. lid. per head of
her population, and she ought to get back £2 15s. 1 Id.;
but, as she only gets back, under the proposal of
the hon. member, Sir John Bray, £1 14s. 4d., she
will contribute £1 Is. 7d. to the defaulting colonies.
Tasmania would contribute £1 12s. 10d., and she
ought to get back £1 os. lOd. ; but as she would get
back £1 14s. 4d., she would be presented with a bonus
of 13s. 6d.
An Hon. Member : If these figures are printed,
why cannot the hon. member distribute them?
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH: No, these are the
suppressed papers. Now, I have offered to apply this
principle to every imaginable tariff, and surely if it
applies in every case I have proved it thoroughly.
If the hon. gentleman thinks it is such a splendid
argument to say that it would only apply to an
imaginary tariff why does he not bring forward a
tariff to which it would not apply?
Sir John Bray : I want to base my argument on
facts !
Mr. Playford : The hon. member has taken the
worst year of all in dealing with South Australia—
the year when we had a 3-bushel per acre harvest!
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH : That is another
thing, and we will give the representatives of South
Australia every latitude with regard to it, I did not
know until the hon. gentleman told me that I had
taken a bad year for South Australia. If I had
known, I should have picked another year; but if I
had gone further back I should have had to give
reasons for doing so.
Mr. Macdonald-Paterson : We had a bad year in
Queensland, too !
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH: At all events, I
have taken the latest statistics. The hon. member,
Mr. Playford, asks how it is that when South Aus-
tralia contributes £1 3s. 4d. they will actually get
back £1 3s. more than that amount. It is simply
because the average amount to be returned, if it is
returned per capita , will be £1 14s. 4d., which will
leave £1 3s. to be handed back, if the amendment
of the hon. member, Sir John Bray, is carried. By
their mode of distribution Queensland will get a
great deal less than she ought, and New South Wales
and Victoria will be in the same position, while New
Zealand will be dealt with very well, and Western
Australia will be the biggest victim of all, though
South Australia and Tasmania will actually get back
the whole of their customs, and a large bonus in
addition. Those are the facts that came before the
committee. What are the facts that have come
before us since? I have here a table which was
made out this morning, and which I would have had
put before the Committee days ago had I known that
these tables were suppressed; but I did not know it
until last night. It shows what would be the result,
if, instead of adopting this imaginary tariff, we should
adopt the Victorian tariff. New South Wales would
then have to contribute to the expenses of the federal
government, instead of 11s. 5d., 14s. lid., supposing
the distribution were made according to the amend-
ment of the hon. member, Sir John Bray; Victoria,
instead of contributing 11s. 5d., would have to con-
tribute 13s. 3d. ; Queensland, instead of 11s. 5d.,
would have to pay £1 3s. Id.; and South Australia,
instead of paying anything, would receive a bonus of
£1 Is. 3d. per head of the population. Western
Australia is the only colony that would be square.
She would have to pay 11s. 6d. instead of 11s. 5d., or
Id. more than she ought to pay; Tasmania would pay
6s. 5d., and New Zealand Is. 6d. I use 11s. sd.
instead of 12s. because the Government Statistician
in compiling this table has taken the latest returns.
The effect of applying a uniform tariff to the various
colonies would be to punish all the large consumers of
goods. Those who contributed most would be mulcted
to benefit those who contributed least. But that is
not an equitable system of distribution. I now want
to illustrate another argument advanced against my
amendment by the hon. member, Sir John Bray.
He said that we had enough trouble at the present
time to ascertain the amounts to be paid at
the customs, and if we were to keep up the
existing system we should get no advantage from
the federal government. I differ entirely from the
hon. member, Sir John Bray, as to what it would
cost to ascertain the amount paid in the shape of duty
on articles actually consumed in the different colonies.
I do not think there would be any great difficulty in
regard to the matter at all. Quite independent of
that, however, the matter is one which ought to bo
faced, so that our statistics may be placed on a proper
basis. No one has a higher appreciation of the


talents of Mr. Coghlan and Mr. Hayter in getting up
the statistics of the various colonies than I have.
These gentlemen are worthy of all praise, and the
books they issue are a credit to the colonies. I
admire these gentlemen greatly, and I often have
reason to be grateful to them for the information
they communicate. They cannot, however, deal with
information which they do not obtain, and a great
deal of information which they do not obtain should
and ought to be obtained, if necessary, at considerable
expense. Take, for instance, the question as to how
South Australia figures as an exporter and importer.
One is surprised on looking at the terribly large
amount of imports of that colony in proportion to the
population and to the known trade ; but when we
take into consideration the fact that the whole of the
silver and the lead which comes from Broken Hill
figures twice in the statistics of the colony—first, on
going into the colony at the Broken Hill boundary,
and then on going out at Adelaide, or whatever other
port it is shipped from, we can understand why
the figures are so large. Another fact in regard
to South Australia is that all the wool that
comes down the Murray figures as an import of
that colony, when it comes into port from the
river, and then it figures as an export on going
out. With regard to New South Wales, all the gold
coming from Mount Morgan figures as an import,
and as an export, too; and, possibly, it figures also as
an import and export of Victoria. All these statistics
therefox*e are misleading, and I contend that we ought
to go to considerable trouble and expense in having
them correct. There can be no trouble whatever in
arriving at what I want to arrive at, and that is, the
amount of money paid by the different colonies on the
goods consumed in those colonies. The matter is not
one which should be put on one side; let it be referred
to practical men who are acquainted with business
and with statistics, and I will guarantee that they
will furnish a report that it will cost less to obtain the
statistics properly and correctly than the Queensland
Government alonewill have to hand to South Australia
for these bonuses, through the peculiar mode of distri-
bution they advocate simply because it is the only
practical mode. It is not the only practical mode ;
it could be done perfectly well otherwise. With regard
to South Australia there is very little difficulty, and
with regard to the other colonies there is very little
difficulty; and the difficulty would be far more than
counterbalanced by the advantage to the colonies in
knowing, thoroughly, the extent of their business, the
extent of their manufactures, the amounts imported
and exported, and other information which we do not
possess at the present time. Hon. delegates seem to
imagine that there is some kind of symmetry between
distributing the surplus according to population and
charging the different colonies for their government
according to population. I do not see at all where
the symmetry is obtained in establishing a system
of that kind, because the one question has nothing
whatever to do with the other. The two proposi-
tions, that each colony should contribute accord-
ing to population, and that the surplus should
be distributed, as nearly as possible, according to
the amount actually contributed to the revenue, are
perfectly consistent. We give the colonies back what
belongs to them after having charged them with their
share of what it costs to govern the country. Is there
anything at all to show why it is going to cost to govern
Queensland, federally, double what it is going to cost
to govern South Australia ? I cannot give any reason.
The hon. member, Mr. Burgess, says that all the
disadvantages will be far more than counterbalanced
by the advantages which are going to be given to
Queensland financially. He instances the fact that
we would make a profit out of the post-office of South
Australia, and that a very heavy loss would be incurred
by undertaking the post-office arrangements of Queens-
land. There is something in that idea, and if it had
been brought before the committee, I, for one, would
have said, " Adjust the methods at once ; I have no
objection whatever that it should be adjusted ; but
remember that you will be adopting something like a
different principle." The South Australian Postal
Department is profitable, I believe, because it is a bad
one, and is administered for revenue purposes. The
Queensland Postal Department is a good one, and is
administered for the accommodation of the public,
and we know perfectly well that we may lose by it.
I have no doubt that when the new policy comes into
operation, and the federal government takes charge of
the postal departments, a good system of management
and greatly increased accommodation will be adopted,
and that the postal department of South Australia
will cost as much as the postal department in Queens-
land. The difference entirely arises from the want
of postal accommodation in South Australia. I
know from experience that the accommodation to the
people who write and receive letters is worse in that
colony than in any other. I can therefore understand
why they obtain a profit from their postal depart-
ment. When matters are assimilated, I have no
doubt there will be no occasion for grumbling. At
all events, I, for one, would at once agree to handing
over our proportion, so that there should not be any
loss. But why raise a question of that kind here ?
The time to discuss questions of that kind was at the
committee meetings. I was prepared to discuss the
question, but it was put before the committee and
was passed over with the whole of the facts before us
as to the revenue and expenditure of the postal
systems in the different colonies. Why was it not
brought up ? It was certainly not brought up on the
understanding that a proposition such as that which
is to be moved by the hon. member, Sir John Bray,
would be accepted by the Convention. The hon.
member, Sir John Bray, says that unless we act in a
wide spirit it will be hopeless to expect that we can
obtain federation. I would tell him that I have been
as keen an advocate of federation as any one in the
country, and that the only way to obtain federation is
to make it reasonable to the people who have sent us
here. Unless we do that we have no chance whatever
of federating, and it is to remove any blocks of that
kind that I insist on fair play being given. Unless
we can show that fair play has been allowed, and that
we have stood up for the interests of our various
colonies, we shall have to defend ourselves before our
constituents. I deprecate exceedingly the attempt
which has been made by the hon. member, Mr.
McMillan, to suppress information in connection with
this matter. I think that if that information had
been universally distributed amongst the delegates
we would have had a far more thorough understanding
on the matter. It looks, as some hon. member has
characterised it, as though there had been secret
meetings of the Finance Committee. I have no inten-
tion of making anything secret in connection with
that committee myself, and all this information ought
to have been distributed broadcast. It is information
on which we are bound to act. The information con-
tained in all those tables is true. It is made up
by one of the cleverest men in the colony, and it is
information that we can thoroughly trust. It is
perfectly reliable. I say that it ought to have been
disseminated broadcast. We ought to know the
ground on which we stand. How could we possibly
accept an amendment such as that of the hon.
member, Sir John Bray? We should either have to
acknowledge, when we go back to our constituents,
that we did not understand the matter when the facts
were put before us, or, what would be a great deal
worse, that we were knaves and did not make use of
the information in order to get justice for the difier-
ent colonies. I can quite appreciate the motives that
actuate the hon. members, Sir John Bray and Mr.


Playford, in standing up for their own colony. I
remember the blank look of one of those hon. gentle-
men when table E was put before him. I know that
he must advocate the cause of his colony, and for that
I was prepared; but I am perfectly satisfied that
when South Australia understands the facts she will
be as glad to come into the federation on the pro-
posals that we made as on any other fair terms.
Mr. McMILLAN : I think that my hon. friend
has been very severe on me, and rather unfair. If
he has done anything at all to-day he has proved that
the Victorian tariff is impossible in the future ; and
I would remind him that although he has selected one
tariff, it is by no means a model one, and is not a
tariff upon which any determinate results can be
based, because, as very few people perhaps know, the
Victorian tariff is a very curious one. I understand
that about one-half of the articles come in free in
a so-called protected colony. To take a tariff of
that kind, which is . adjusted for purely local wants
and exigencies, and to bring out any general results,
may, of course, be useful as being approximate, but
cannot be reliable for the future. It seems to me
that, as we are in the spirit of compromise, a very
fair compromise can be considered which would
practically restore the spirit of the recommendations
of the Finance Committee, if we pass the amendment
moved by the hon. member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith,
and then, after the word " shall," in line 3 of the
clause, insert the words " until the parliament other-
wise provides," thus making the clause read, " and the
surplus shall, until the parliament otherwise provides,
be returned to the several states in proportion," &c.
That was really the intention of the Finance Com-
mittee. We knew that we had a very difficult thing
to deal with at present—that there was an absolute
injustice staring us in the face according to present
conditions—but we did hope that in the new tariff,
and under different conditions, a simpler and more
symmetrical principle could be applied. The hon.
member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, is not fair in his
argument with regard to the respective colonies. He
says, why should each colony not get back its propor-
tion of its customs duties ? But when we federate all
the formal and merely provincial boundaries that
divide us will be done away with, and we shall be
restored to our geographical boundaries. Who will
for one moment say that if these colonies were par-
celled out again, Victoria would not probably have up
to the Murrumbidgee 1 I should be very sorry ever to
yield her an inch of territory more than she has, as
we have got the territory ; but does anybody shut his
eyes to the fact that the trade of that region is almost
entirely absorbed by Victoria 1 And if it is absorbed by
Victoria, when she has heavy duties, with drawbacks
and ail the possible restrictions of trade, surely the great
bulk of goods that will be imported into Riverina
will come through the Custom-house of Victoria, and
according to the argument of my hon. friend, those are
really the customs duties of New South Wales. The
whole spirit of this is entirely anti-federal. I allow
that there is a tremendous difficulty. I allow that my
hon. friend, in going back to his own colony and
putting those figures before the people there without
very broad explanations and without a very liberal
spirit attached to them, would have a very difficult
task. But I hold that those figures, although abso-
lutely correct on the basis upon which they are made
out, are not fair figures in this debate. lam willing
to go so far as to accept those figures as the present
condition of things. But if I accept them as the
present condition of things, I do not admit that any
one has a right to say that that will be the condition
of things in the future. All the existing tariffs have
been made out with a view to local exigencies. They
have been made out with a narrow, provincial eye,
and my hope for free-trade, as I have said before, is
that when the unification, to a certain extent, of the
colonies is complete, and when one common tariff is
decided upon, it will not be a tariff to suit exactly
either Victoria, or Queensland, or South Australia,
but will be a tariff fair to all; and if that tariff is fair
to all, allowing for certain differences that must
always occur, it ought to work out very differently, on
a symmetrical basis, from the Victoria tariff instanced
by the hon. member. Therefore, I give notice now,
if the Committee will allow me, though it is a little
out of order, that when my hon. friend’s amendment
is moved and passed, which I trust it will be, I will
move to insert after the word “ shall,” in line 3, the
words “ until the parliament otherwise provides,”
thereby giving the parliament, when it has come
together in its true constituted federal spirit, a chance
of dealing with the thing on the only lines upon
which it can be dealt with—the broad lines of federal
union,
Mr. AD YE DOUGLAS : It is difficult to follow the
hon. member for Queensland, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith,
in his argument. He is like an unfortunate juryman
who has all the rest of the jury against him, I under-
stand that he was willing to adopt the opinion of the
committee; but directly that was advocated by the
hon. and learned member, Sir John Bray, he at once
receded from that position. He then, in order to carry
out, as it were, the position which he maintains, says
that everybody is wrong except himself. The committee
is accused of suppressing documents, the hon. member,
Sir John Bray, is accused of misstating facts, and so
we get into this abominable position. If anybody
will take up the document that the hon. member was
so exceedingly anxious this Convention should see,
they will observe at once the fallacy of the whole of
his argument. The argument is founded upon the
supposition that the Victorian tariff is to be adopted.
If any one will take the trouble to look at the figures,
they will find that Queensland would have to pay
£665,000 more than South Australia. Of course,
such a tariff would not be adopted. The common-
wealth would take care, as mentioned by the hon.
member, Mr. McMillan, that the tariff should operate
fairly amongst all the colonies. There is a most remark-
able thing again with respect to the position of South
Australia and Queensland. South Australia has
apparently a very sober population ; but, on the other
hand, Queensland is a most intemperate country,
Queensland goes in for £564,000 worth of intoxicants,
and South Australia for only £207,000 worth, being a
difference of £357,000 spent upon intoxicants. On the
general revenue also, according to Victoria, Queensland
would pay £679,030, and South Australia £327,000,
making a differenceof £351,000, showing how fallacious
is the foundation upon which the hon. member, Sir
Thomas Mcllwraith, insists upon his argument. I think
that we here should take the opinion of the Finance
Committee as being the correct one, and we should
endeavour at once to bring our labours upon this
particular point to a close, instead of debating it as
we have been doing for some three hours. The hon.
member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, will try to disguise
or keep back this great fact that, in respect to the
federal government taking over the postal arrange-
ments, £112,000 at the least is saved to the one
colony, while £30,000 is lost to the other, making the
difference in the figures just about even on that point.
Again, we find in reckoning the revenue that the
amount per head for the whole of the inhabitants of
Australia should be £2 6s. sd. I imagine that the
federal government will try and make these figures
correspond as nearly as possible with respect to the
general arrangements. The hon. member talks of
Queensland; but the amount for Queensland at the
present time is £3 7s. 10d., whereas if that colony
comes into the federation it would be only £2 6s. sd.
How he is so persistent in carrying on this argument
I am at a loss to understand. No doubt, in any
federal arrangement the whole of these matters will


be carefuly considered, and the only plan to adopt is,
it appears to me, that the whole of the revenue shall
form one pool out of which the expenses shall be paid,
and the balance shall be returned to the several
colonies according to population. If that is done it
will save all trouble. The clause in the bill will get
rid of none of the difficulties existing at the present
time. A man who travels from Sydney to Melbourne
would be liable to have his portmanteau examined,
and a man going there from Tasmania would have to
go through the same ordeal if there happened to be a
disagreeable customs officer. I understand that one
great object is to do away with these difficulties and
the expense as well, and we can only do that on the
principle of paying the revenues of the federated
colonies into one pool, paying the expenses of govern-
ment out of that pool, and dividing the balance
amongst the several colonies according to population.
I hope that that system will be carried out, and that
the proposal of the hon. member, Sir John Bray, will
be accepted.
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH : The hon. member,
Mr. McMillan, has offered a compromise, and offered
it in a spirit which, I think, is quite worthy of this
Convention, namely, the spirit of conciliation, for the
purpose of bringing about federation. I do not want
to say a single word that would detract from the high
trust that I have in the federation working well. I
believe in remitting a great deal to them, and so far
as the hon. member’s suggestion is concerned, I have
that trust in the federal government as to be satisfied
to refer the whole matter completely to them. I do
not want to have my ideas so fixed that it will require
an alteration of the constitution to bring about an
exact adjustment of the finances. I have the most full
confidence that the federal parliament will work so
well that they will do justice to all, and in that spirit,
therefore, I am perfectly prepared to accept my hon.
friend’s suggestion.
Mr. BIRD : I am very glad that the hon. member,
Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, has been induced under
pressure to state his intentions with regard to the
amendment to be proposed by the hon. member,
Sir John Bray, for if he had not done so, I should
have been somewhat disposed to support his amend-
ment, because I desire that the expenditure of the
commonwealth shall be borne pro rata, according to
the population of the various states. But while I
hold that view, I certainly hold that the revenue,
after a uniform tariff has been established, should
be regarded as having been contributed equally in
the same way by the populations of the states \
or, as it has been put, that we should have simply one
purse into which the whole of the revenue contributed
to the commonwealth shall go, and out of which the
federal expenditure shall be paid, the balance being
distributed according to the population of the states.
Since the hon. member has stated that he intends to
oppose the amendment of the hon. member, Sir John
Bray, I cannot help feeling that the adoption of his
amendment would introduce into this clause a larger
measure of inequality, and, to use a phrase of his own,
of political iniquity, than it now contains. For I feel
sure that the adoption of his amendment, which would
spread the expenditure of the commonwealth equally
according to the population of the various states,
would produce that inequality in the federation which
I hope we are all desirous of avoiding. I do not like
this clause at all; to ray mind it is the worst clause,
or, perhaps, I should rather say it is the only bad
clause in the bill, for it introduces that principle of
inequality which is to be deprecated, and certainly
deprecated above all in a body which we are going to
term a commonwealth, I trust that the principle of
having one purse, out of which the whole of the
expenditure shall be paid according to the population
of the various states, will be adopted either in one
form or another. It is just possible that the amend-
ment suggested by the hon. member, Mr. McMillan,
as a compromise, may be the best way out of the
difficulty at the present time; for I should certainly
have felt that the parliament of the commonwealth
would be disposed to act upon that principle of
fairness which was embodied in the recommenda-
tions of the Finance Committee. And, if we are
not likely to agree either to the amendment of the
hon. member, Sir John Bray, or to that of the hon.
member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, probably our wisest
course would be to consider carefully, and perhaps
adopt, after such consideration, the amendment
suggested by the hon. member, Mr McMillan. I
could not help feeling, while listening to the remarks
which fell from the lips of the hon. member, Sir
Thomas Mcllwraith, that we have hardly become
possessed yet of the true spirit of federation. I could
not help asking myself, while he spoke. Has it really
come to this : that such a pettifogging, parochial
spirit of selfishness is to be embodied in a clause of
this bill constituting a commonwealth as to take into
consideration the question whether Queensland drinks
a little more whiskey than South Australia, or
whether the populations of some of the larger and
more settled states clothe themselves in costlier
raiment, or perhaps spend their wealth on plate, and
jewelry, and so forth, to a larger extent than some of
the populations in outlying places far remote from
those centres where the world of fashion congregates 1
Surely, if we are going to federate at all we must
learn to lose sight of all these trifling differences, and
feel that we are all one ; that in the federation we
are going to have a customs union in the truest and
best sense of the word ; a union for postal and tele-
graph purposes ; a union for defence purposes ; and
that all expenditure in connection with carrying out
those purposes shall be borne equally by the various
states in proportion to their population after a uni-
form tariff is established. Of course, until a uniform
tariff is established, there must be some provision
such as is set out here, and such as was indicated by
the recommendations of the Finance Committee for
distributing the surplus revenuue to the various
colonies, after meeting the expenses of the federal
government for the first year or two. Therefore, I
felt that when the hon. member, Sir John Bray,
indicated his amendment in the first instance, it
was defective in leaving the bill without a provision
for that interim action; but he has now suggested, as
an amendment of that, that the clause which was in
the draft bill, and which truly embodied the recom-
mendations of the Finance Committee, should be
submitted to the Committee. I shall feel it my duty,
if we go to a division on that, to support an amend-
ment which will restore the clause as originally placed
before the Constitutional Committee ; and if, on the
other hand, the Committee shall think it more desirable
to leave the whole matter to the parliament of the
commonwealth, I shall then doubtless feel it to be best
to adopt the suggestion of the hon. member, Mr.
McMillan, in that respect. But Ido trust that in all
these matters we shall show somewhat more of the
true federal spirit, and that we shall lose sight of the
trifling losses and trifling gains of one colony or the
other, and that we shall all agree that in all these
respects we are, and mean to be, thoroughly one.
Mr. BAKER : There is one statement made by the
hon. member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, that I cannot
allow to go uncontradicted. He asserted that the post-
office service of South Australia was carried on for the
purpose of raising revenue, and not for the purpose of
affording facilities to the public. Ido not know what
opportunities the hon. member has had of ascertaining
in what manner the postal service of South Australia
is carried on, but I give his assertion the most emphatic
denial. I say that there is no colony in this group in
which the postal service is better managed that it is in
the colony of South Australia, or in which it offers


greater facilities to the public. I have known of
instances in which persons who have taken up
runs in the far interior, where they have been
separated from the rest of the colony by long
distances, without any water carriage, have applied
to the Government of South Australia to establish
a postal service for their particular stations, which
applications have not been granted; but that is
no reason whatever for asserting that the postal
service of South Australia is not managed for the
benefit of the public, and that it is not well managed.
I say that it is, and I think I have had greater oppor-
tunities of forming an opinion than has the hon.
member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith.
Sir THOMAS McILWEAITH ; I never made the
assertion that the postal service of South Australia
was not well managed. What I said was that it was
managed for the purposes of revenue, and not for the
purpose of affording the greatest degree of accommo-
dation to the public. I made no reflection whatever
upon the Government of South Australia.
Mr. Playford; The hon. member certainly did.
He said the postal service was not managed for the
convenience of the public!
Sir THOMAS McILWEAITH : Certainly I did;
but that is a question of policy. It is not a reflection
upon the Government.
Captain EUSSELL: We have got intoa remarkable
position. As a matter of fact, we are debating one of
the most important clauses in the bill, and, together
with it, three or four amendments the wording of
which we do not know, and some of which are not
before the Committee at all. There is, of course, one
amendment before the Committee; but allusion is
repeatedly made to amendments that are to be moved;
and until they are absolutely before us, we scarcely
know what we are discussing. Unfortunately for all
of us, however, I think we are drifting further and
further away from federation. Whatever else we may
be aiming at, we are certainly not aiming at that. I,
at any rate, came here in a loyal and honest endeavour
to support federation. There are two principles, it
seems to me, which may be fairly discussed—one is a
federation of Australasia, and the other is a unification
of Australia. Whatever may be said in eulogy of com-
promise, I am afraid we may carry our desire to com-
promise so far that we shall have rather a unification
of Australia than a federation of Australasia. We
are getting into this absurdly anomalous position—
that although we call what we are adopting federa-
tion, we are, in reality, drifting into unification. We
have not, however, the courage of our opinions to go
for either federation or unification. If there is to be
a unification of Australia —and that, I am afraid, is
what we are drifting into—it can be accomplished
only by realising that we are one nation, and that the
people of Australia are one people. All this talk
about customs-houses, and the contributions of one
and another portion of the colonies to the general
revenue, must at once be set aside. Hon members
argue, it seems to me, as though we were for ever to
remain as we are—that Victoria and New South
Wales having a preponderating influence on the conti-
nent of Australia, are to remain with that preponde-
rating influence for all time. Now, I venture to say
that although New South Wales undoubtedly has
from many circumstances an enormous lead, and may
possibly retain that lead for many years, perhaps for
centuries, to come, the day will yet come when, I will
not say all, but many parts of Australia will be as
populous as those portions which are now the most
populous. Therefore, if we are endeavouring to create
a constitution not for to-day, but for people unborn,
we ought not to look upon the subject from the narrow
point of view as to which of the colonies produces
most revenue or consumes the greatest quantity of
dutiable articles; but we ought so to frame our con-
stitution that it shall apply to all parts of Australia
without unnecessary interference with the various
constitutions in the immediate future. I venture to
say that the lines upon which we are proceeding will
satisfy no one. I myself believe that unless we take
more time to deliberate upon what we are doing, the
bill we shall pass—for of course we shall pass a bill—
will be so many waste leaves, and nothing else.
Hon. Members : No 1
Captain EUSSELL : Hon. members may say “ No,”
and to a certain extent I agree with them; but I look
upon the measure as the bringing together of a great
mass of material, which, to use the metaphor of the
builder, has yet to be shaped before it can be erected
into an edifice, or which, if you regard it as food, has
yet to be assimilated ; and the conclusion to which I
have arrived is that we, as a body, are not fitted to
come to a decision upon these points. Delegates who
have listened to the addresses delivered since the com-
mencement of these debates, must realise at once that
we have all most materially modified our opinions
since we first came here. And it is desirable that we
should do so. But if, in the crude, undigested state
in which our views are at the present time, we are
found materially changing our opinions in so short a
space of time, will any one say that in the course of
six months we shall not still further have altered
them 1 I venture to say that by that time many of
us will be found holding opinions different from those
we now hold. And if that be the case with us, how
much more will it be the case with the colonies we are
here to represent! We came here knowing little or
nothing about federation; but the people who sent us
here knew still less, and if we have so increased our
knowledge that we are able to materially alter our
opinions upon material questions in the course of
these several weeks, how much more will the people
in the various colonies be inclined to alter their
opinions before they come to a decision as to whether
they will or will not accept the bill we frame ? I
myself believe that we should only be doing right—
perhaps I stand alone in the opinion—although enter-
taining it I will enunciate it—that instead of our
coming to any conclusion at once this Convention
ought, sooner or later, to adjourn for six months. If
we are at present unable to agree upon a basis of
federation, that of itself would be a very serious
drawback. If, on the other hand, we bring up a bill
which is so based upon compromise that the major
portion of the colonies will not agree to it, I am afraid
we shall also have retarded the cause we are here to
advance.
Mr. Playford : What is the question before the
Committee ?
Captain EUSSELL : It is not often that I trouble
the Convention, certainly not so often as my hon.
friend, and if I have not stuck absolutely to the letter
of the bill, I have not delved into the pages of history
from the time of the ncient Eomans, as the hon.
member has so often done. I would point out one
respect in which I think we have done extremely
wrong. We have not had the courage to view the
matter completely. We have already passed one
clause which will offer a fatal objection to any of the
smaller colonies, at any rate, coming within the scope
of the federation.
Mr. Playford : That clause is not under considera-
tion now !
Captain EUSSELL: Then I will not refer speci-
fically to any clause. I will confine myself to general
principles.
Mr. Playford: I rise to order. We are discussing
now clause 9 of chapter iv, and I think we ought to
confine ourselves to that clause. If we wander over
the whole subject of federation, we shall never finish
our labours. lam sure my hon. friend, Captain
Eussell, will forgive me for calling attention to


his remarks. We are doing things on business lines,
and we should confine ourselves to the business
before us.
The Chairman : I think the hon. member is quite
in order.
Captain RUSSELL : The clause before us is so
excessively wide that there is scarcely any subject
within the range of federation which cannot be fairly
alluded to. There are provisions in the bill whereby
the whole power of levying duties of customs and
excise is to be taken away from the states and vested
in the federation. There are also provisions whereby
the power of direct taxation shall be taken from the
states and shall be vested in the federation.
Mr. Munro ; The federal parliament is to be per-
mitted to impose direct taxation !
Captain RUSSELL: Yes, permitted to this extent:
We know the major power will be in the common-
wealth, and if the customs and excise duties are not
sufficient for the federation, what will be left for the
states ? In addition, the federal government will
have power to borrow to any extent it chooses for
any purpose. It will, therefore, have the power to
pledge the security of all the states, and to take all
powers of taxation, while we practically relieve the
states of nothing whatsoever, No small, weak state
dare enter into a federation like that, because we
cannot get away from the sad fact that there are heavy
obligations and enormous debts; that interest has to
be paid to the bondholder in England. So long as that
is the case the bondholder in England will raise such
a hubbub and put such pressure on the Imperial Par-
liament—because the whole of his security will be
taken away—that the Imperial Parliament will
throw great obstacles in the way of Federation
unless provision is made for the payment of the
foreign bondholder in a way not provided for here.
Under these circumstances this debate upon the
extent of the consumption of dutiable goods in one
colony or another is futile, and is merely beating the
aii’, and until we come to the true basis of either a
proper confederation, with limited powers, or the
unification of Australia—which I am afraid we are
all aiming at—we are really wasting our time.
Mr. KINGSTON : I only rise for the purpose of
putting a question to the hon. member, Sir Thomas
Mcllwraith, to whose persistent advocacy of his views
on this subject I have listened with a great deal of
interest. I have in my hand a table headed,
“ Methods of distributing the surplus revenue,” and
I understand that this is one of the documents which
was prepared under the instructions of the hon.
member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, and which he has
plaintively alluded to as having been suppressed.
Mr, Munro : No ; that was never before the com-
mittee !
Mr, KINGSTON : However that may be, the
figures in the return are of considerable interest, and
I am particularly struck by the first column, headed
“ Customs revenue which would be raised under the
Victorian tariff.” What I desire to know is : How
are those figures arrived at 1 Are they arrived at on
the basis of the imports at the present time ?
Mr. Donaldson : For 1889 !
Mr. KINGSTON : Under these circumstances they
are utterly misleading, and worse than worthless.
What is the position ? The different colonies have
different tariffs. In South Australia we have a tariff
which has been adopted, not for revenue purposes,
but for protective purposes, and which lias had the
undoubted effect of limiting our imports and increas-
ing our local manufactures. Other colonies are not
so situated,
Mr. Donaldson : What about Victoria 1
Mr. KINGSTON ; Even with regard to Victoria,
I have it on the best authority that our tariff is
infinitely more protective than the Victorian tariff;
that whilst we collect something like 20 per cent, in
the shape of duties on imported goods, owing to the
large number of lines which, in Victoria, are admitted
free, the percentage which they collect on the total
value of their imports does not amount to 11 percent.
When we consider that the adoption of a uniform
tariff must alter the existing differences in the amount
of imports, is it fair to base a calculation of the pro-
bable results of a uniform tariff on the present value
of the imports under the different tariffs of the various
colonies 1 It is utterly unfair and misleading. Suppos-
ing the South Australian tariff' were reduced to the
level of the Victorian tariff, what would be the natural
result ? Our imports would increase. Supposing, on
the other hand, that the New South Wales tariff were
raised to the level of the Victorian tariff, what would
be the inevitable consequence 1 The imports would
diminish. Are we, in total disregard of what must be
the inevitable result of a uniform tariff, to be asked
to lay down within the four corners of this bill a hard
and fast rule based on the existing state of affaii’s
which in the natural order of things must be altered ?
The suggestion is utterly untenable. If the figures
are based on the conditions to which I call attention,
they are liable to the criticism to which I have felt it
my duty to subject them.
Mr. Donaldson : Where is the criticism ?
Mr. KINGSTON : That to base a calculation as to
what will be the contribution of the whole of Australia
under a uniform tariff' on facts and figures relating to
the quantity of imports at the present day when we
have varying tariffs which, of course, affect the amount
of imports, is utterly unfair.
Mr. Donaldson : Mere assertion !
Mr. KINGSTON : The hon. member says it is mere
assertion. I invite him to prove the fallacy of it.
Surely he will recognise this : that the - placing of the
various tariffs of the different colonies on a uniform
basis will alter the inequalities which at present exist,
and which are fairly enough attributable to the differ-
ence in the fiscal systems which obtain in the different
colonies. If the figures are based on the imports of 1889,
it seems to me that they are worthless. If they are
not so based, I should like to know on what founda-
tion they rest, for it appears to me that they either
rest on the worthless foundation to which I have
called attention, or they are matters of pure specula-
tion, which can afford us no reliable guide in the course
which we propose to lay down as to the distribution
of surplus revenue.
Sir JOHN BRAY ; The amendment before us is
not the one which I intend to move. I ask hon. mem-
bers to vote against this amendment, with the view
of substituting a clause included in the draft bill by
the Constitutional Committee on the recomendation of
the Finance Committee.
Mr. MUNRO : I understand that if this amend-
ment is carried the Colonial Treasurer of New South
Wales will move another which will leave it open to
the Parliament to make future arrangements which
will be satisfactory to all parties, instead of making
the clause hard-and-fast, as it is now. Am I to
understand that that is agreed to ?
Mr. McMillan : Yes !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: The effect of this .
amendment, if carried, with the one indicated by the
Colonial Treasurer of New South Wales, will be to
leave it for the federal parliament to make its own
arrangement for the distribution of the revenue when
a uniform tariff is established. That will restore the
bill exactly to the form recommended by the select
committee, with this exception only, that it will be
for the federal parliament to say when it shall bring
in a new system of distribution.

Question so resolved in the affirmative.
Mr. McMILLAN : I now move :
That after the word “ shall,” line 3, these words be inserted,
“ until uniform duties of customs have been imposed.”
I shall afterwards propose that there be added at the
end of the clause the following words :
After uniform duties of customs have been imposed the sur-
plus shall be returned to the several states in the same manner
and proportion, until the parliament otherwise prescribes.
That leaves it open to the parliament to alter it; but
it does not necessarily indicate that it shall be altered.
I may say at once, in view of the debate that may
follow, that I do not think we ought to indicate to the
parliament that there is any defect in our handiwork;
but we should leave it open to them under the altered
conditions and under a tariff which we cannot foresee,
to alter the process if they think it right to do so.
Mr. Adye Douglas : Will the hon. member inform
us what was the meaning of the report of the Finance
Committee, which stated that when the uniform tariff
came into operation the surplus revenue should be
distributed according to population 1
Mr, McMILLAN: I intended to explain to hon.
members that this is a compromise.
Mr. Adye Douglas : Oh, another compromise !
Mr. McMILLAN : That, while we do not go back
entirely upon the report of the Finance Committee, we
leave it open to the federal parliament to carry out to
the letter, if necessary in the future, that particular
report, or any report they like to adopt.
x\mendment proposed.
Sir JOHN BRAY: I understand that the hon.
gentleman intends afterwards to propose what should
be done after the uniform tariff is imposed. The present
amendment carries out the recommendation of the
Finance Committee, that until uniform customs duties
are imposed the surplus shall be returned according to
the amount of revenue raised in each colony ; but the
question comes in, what is to be done after the uniform
tariff is imposed 1
Mr. McMillan: This amendment is merely a sugges-
tion of the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, with a
view to make the clause perfect!
Sir JOHN BRAY : I am quite content to take this
amendment.
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH: I should like to
understand whether the hon. gentleman is going to
take the other too 1 ? Unless hon. members opposite
are prepared to say they will accept the other amend-
ment, we shall reject this one.
Sir JOHN BRAY ; As far as I am personally con-
cerned, I.recognise that the feeling of the Committee
is against the proposal I made, and I do not want to
interpose any unnecessary delay. But I would ask
hon. gentlemen who take the view of the case opposed
to mine, to say that we will let the federal paidiament
prescribe what is to be done with the surplus. Do not
say that this is to bo continued until the act is passed,
because the act may never be passed; but say that after
the federal parliament has established a uniform tariff,
it shall prescribe what is to be done with the surplus.
Mr. McMillan : We can fight that out on my
second amendment!
Sir JOHN BRAY : I am quite willing to accept
the words at the end, “ After a uniform customs tariff
has been established the surplus shall be returned to
each state in such manner and proportion as the
federal paidiament may prescribe.”
Amendment agreed to.
Clause further amended verbally.
Mr. McMILLAN : It has been suggested that the
most convenient place for my amendment would be
after sub-section 3, and then sub-section 4 will be a
separate paragraph of the clause. I therefore move :
That after sub-clause 3 the following words be inserted as a
new sub-clause:—“ After uniform duties of customs have
been imposed, the surplus shall be returned to the several
states or parts of the commonwealth in the same manner and
proportions, until the parliament otherwise prescribes.”
That does not direct the parliament to make the dis-
tribution in a different way from that in which we
have proposed, but it gives them a free hand in the
matter.
Sir JOHN BRAY: I do not want to delay the
Committee by enlarging on this point; but I think that
those who have carried it against us ought to consider
that we are not satisfied with the position, and instead
of simply leaving the matter to the federal parliament
to deal with if it thinks fit, they should make it the
duty of the federal parliament to prescribe how the
surplus shall be divided immediately they meet. In
the one case we say, “ This system can go on as long
as you like ; you need not alter it ”; and in the other
which I suggest, we say that the federal parliament
shall determine how the surplus shall be divided.
They may say that the system proposed is the best
system, and continue it; or, on the other hand, they
may say that the surplus shall be divided according to
population. As we cannot all be satisfied as to the
proper mode of distributing the surplus, I think we
might all agree that the federal parliament should
prescribe what in their opinion is the proper method
of distribution. I therefore move, as an amendment
on the amendment of the hon. member, Mr. McMillan:
That in line 4, all the words after the word “common-
wealth ” be omitted with a view to the insertion in lieu thereof
of the words, “ in such manner and proportion as the parlia-
ment may prescribe, ”
That will bind the parliament to provide some means
for distributing the surplus. If they cannot provide
a better means than there is in the bill, they will
continue that; but if they can provide a better means,
they will provide it.
Mr. MUNRO : While personally I should like to
assist the hon. member, Sir John Bray, all I can in
this matter, I am afraid he is creating an unnecessary
difficulty. While we are all anxious to leave the
matter to the parliament to decide in a proper and
equitable manner, if we insist that their first act shall
be to decide it, they will not be in a position to have
the necessary experience to make a just and equitable
arrangement. I think that the proposal of the hon,
member, Mr. McMillan, is more satisfactory than that
of the hon. member, Sir John Bray, because it gives the
parliament power to make a fresh arrangement if they
think fit, and the necessity for such an arrangement is
bound to be thrust upon them if there is any inequality
or injustice existing, because the representatives from
those parts of the commonwealth where it exists will
bring it forward. But to compel the parliament to
make this aiTangement before it has had time to go
into the matter carefully, and ascertain whether there
is any injustice or inequality, is to cause unnecessary
trouble and friction. I should like to vote for the
amendment of the hon. member, Sir John Bray, if I
could; but I think that the amendment of the hon.
member, Mr. McMillan, is more just and equitable,
and likely to be more satisfactory to all.


Mr. THYNNE : It seems to me that the hon.
member, Sir John Bray, has forgotten some of the
clauses which we have already passed. He now pro-
poses that the mode of distributing the surplus shall
accompany the bill imposing the federal tariff; but
we have already provided that a taxation bill shall
contain only one subject of taxation, so that practically
his proposal now is that the federal parliament shall
not pass the tariff until they have first of all passed a
bill by which the surplus is to be distributed. That
increases the difficulties in the way of passing a
federal tariff at all, and I think would make them so
great as to leave in perpetuity the present system of
taxation in each colony.
Mr. AD YE DOUGLAS : I presume that the object
of the hon. member, Sir John Bray, is to have some-
thing of a final character. The amendment proposed
by the hon. member, Mr. McMillan, leaves everything
just as it is. The colonies of New South Wales and
Victoria will retain their tariffs as at present, and
nothing can be done in the federal parliament to bring
about a uniform tariff’; and so we shall go on as we
are now for the next ten or twelve years. That is
not the object of this Convention. The object of the
Convention is to have a uniform tariff of some kind as
speedily as possible.
Mr. Munro : The amendment of the hon. member,
Sir John Bray, will prevent that!
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS : The amendment of the
hon. member, Mr. McMillan, will postpone the day as
long as possible.
Sir Samuel Griffith : No ; but the amendment of
the hon. member, Sir John Bray, will do so !
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS : The amendment of the
hon, member, Mr. McMillan, leaves the mat ter
entirely open.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : It seems to me that
putting the sub-clause in the form proposed might lead
to the most serious consequences. I anticipate that
there will be very little difficulty in framing a uniform
tariff. I anticipate also that there will be a great
deal of difficulty in determining how to distribute the
proceeds. If the parliament agrees to a uniform
tariff, either one or two things must happen; it must
either, in the same session, by another bill, provide
for its distribution, which they may not agree upon
in that session, or there will be a large surplus in the
hands of the federal government which cannot be
distributed at all. Serious difficulties may thus occur.
Mr, DEAKIN ; The amendment of the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. McMillan, says that “ after the imposition of
duties” this question may be considered by the
federal parliament; and the amendment of the hon.
member, Sir John Bray, has the effect of rendering it
imperative that, after the imposition of duties, the
federal parliament should undertake this question.
Mr. Fitzgerald : And coincidentally !
Sir Samuel Griffith : Immediately !
Mr. DEAKIN : Neither the word “coincidentally”
nor the word “immediately ” is used ; and as I read
the amendments they have neither the effect of
requiring the federal parliament to “ immediately ” nor
yet “ coincidentally ” undertake this task. The only
word indicating the time at which it has to be under-
taken is the word “ after,” which is surely indefinite
enough for all purposes. I do not wish to occupy
time if I am under a misapprehension, but I think the
point ought to be made clear, because any concession
which can be made to meet the views of the large and
important minority who voted in the last division
should be made ; and when that concession is in the
direction of giving greater liberty to the federal par-
liament, of allowing the commonwealth to settle its
own affairs, it has behind it another strong argument
to which we are bound to pay attention. I will say
nothing more until the exact words of the amendment
are read.
Sir Thomas Mcllwraitii : It is circumscribing the
action of the federal parliament!
Mr. DEAKIN : I think that is a wrong word to
use. It is requiring action from the federal parlia-
ment, but it is leaving the federal parliament thoroughly
free as to the direction which that action shall take.
Sir Thomas Mcllwraitii : They must take action !
Mr. DEAKIN : They must take action, and the
only word which implies time is the word “after.” If
there is any such implication, as the hon. member, Sir
Samuel Griffith, fears, I am sure the hon. member,
Sir John Bray, will be perfectly willing to alter his
amendment. As I understand it, all that is desired
is simply to require the commonwealth to deal with
this question as soon as it conveniently can after the
passing of a uniform tariff. It will be an easy matter
to adopt the necessary words to remove any further
implication from the amendment, and by that means
we should have the great advantage of rendering this
clause acceptable to the Committee as a whole.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: The hon. member,
Mr. Deakin, has lost sight of this point, that we have
laid down a fixed rule so long as there are various
customs tariffs : but as soon as there is a uniform
tariff we wish to let the federal parliament make any
rule it pleases. We must, however, provide for the
interval. The amendment of the hon. member, Sir
John Bray, leaves no interval, but it leaves the sur-
plus incapable of distribution until the federal
parliament has made a new law on the subject.
Mr. DEAKIN : As I understood the hon. member,
I did not think he intended that.
Amendment upon the amendment negatived.
Amendment agreed to; clause, as amended, agreed
to.
Clause 11, Preference shall not be given by any law or
regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of one part of
the commonwealth, over those of another part of the com-
monwealth, and the vessels bound to or from one part shall
not be bound to enter, clear, or pay duty, in another part.
Amendment (by Sir Samuel Griffith) proposed :
That the word “ bound,” line 5, be omitted with a view to
the insertion of the word “required.”
Mr. BURGESS : Before the amendment suggested
by the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, is put, I
think it would be well that he should explain exactly
how he would obtain the statistics which will be
necessary from the various colonies, in order to dis-
tribute the customs revenue on the basis which has
just been agreed to, if we are to give any effect at all
to the clause under consideration. I take it that what
we have just agreed to, instead of allowing trade to
be free, will embarrass it more than it has ever been
embarrassed in the past. I am confident of that; and
the result of the working will prove that the state-
ment I am making is correct. If, in addition to that,
you pass this clause, by which any vessel leaving one
port and sailing to another will have to enter out, or
clear, or report, you will never be able, I maintain, to
obtain the information which will be absolutely neces-
sary in order to enable you to give effect to the clause
which we have just agreed to. Again, I would point
out that cases will arise in regard to dutiable goods,
goods carried under bond from one colony to the
other, in which it will be absolutely necessary for a
vessel to be entered out and cleared in the ordinary
way in order to prevent smuggling or anything of
that kind.
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH : I do not think
this clause has been sufficiently considered, and it is
quite open to the objection raised by the hon. member,
Mr. Burgess. Take the case, for instance, of a vessel
—and the whole of the American trade is conducted
very much upon this principle—coming from Boston
to Melbourne. She delivers some of her cargo there,
and goes on to Sydney, and afterwards goes on to
Brisbane. How do the last three lines of the clause
apply in a case of that kind ? Why should she not


discharge her cargo, as she does now, in Melbourne or
Sydney, pay the dues, and go on to the next port, and
pay dues there too 1 It has also been overlooked that
the dues referred to in the clause are part of the local
revenue. What business have we to say that the state
shall not impose a local revenue 1 We have only taken
charge of certain powers connected with navigation;
we have not taken over the ports of a colony, and we
have no business to take over the x’evenue of a colony.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : This is one of the
celebrated clauses in the American Constitution, one
of the few clauses taken from it, and I am very much
disposed to think it would have been better if it had
stopped at the end of the first sentence. I certainly
think that it would be better to omit all the words
after the word “ commonwealth.”
Mr. DIBBS : This clause provides for free-trade
between the ports of the various colonies. A simple
provision for a similar purpose was made by the colony
of New South Wales eight or nine year's ago in one of
the Marine Board bills. It was enacted that a vessel
paying either tonnage or hai’bour dues in one port
should be exempt from paying them in any other port
in the colony. I think that the word “ duty ”in this
clause is a mistake, and that either “ tolls ” or
“ harbour dues ” should be inserted in its place. We
would to a certain extent be robbing various states of
a portion of their revenues ; but for the good that
would x’esult it would be as well to make the law as it
is clearly intended it should be, by striking out the
word “duty.” Then a vessel that paid dues at Sydney
would be exempt at Melbourne, Hobart, or any other
port in Australia. The similar rule which we made
here eight or nine years ago has answered very well.
Mr. Playford : I think we had better leave the
words as they are. They have been ixx the American
Constitution for over a hundred yeai's !
Mr. DIBBS : Can the hon. member tell us what
they meant a hundred years ago 1
Mr. Playford : We know what they mean to-day !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: This is a veryimportant
clause. Vessels will really be bound to enter. Ido
ixot know what the term “ enter ” exactly means ; but
the captain will have to go to the custom-house, and
state tlxat he is going to start, if only for statistical
pui’poses, and he will have to take out shipping papers
when he goes away, and pay some kind of dues. I move :
That the clause be amended by omitting all the words
after the word “ commonwealth,” line 4.
Mx\ DIBBS : I would ask, supposing we had one
gauge of railway through to the Victorian capital,
would it be xxecessary for a train to “clear ” when she
arrived on the boi'der ?
Sir John Bray : Railways do not come from foreign
parts!
Mr. DIBBS : We are not going to call Hobart a
foreign part. If federation is brought about, will
Melbourne be a foreign part 1 I am illustrating the
matter. It is said that for statistical purposes it will
be necessaxy for vessels to have intercolonial cleax-ances.
Formerly a vessel carxying 100 tons of coal from
Newcastle to Sydney entered here, and after she had
discharged her cax'go “cleared,” before going back to
Newcastle. All this gave needless trouble to the
captain. But now a vessel takes out a clearance oxxly
once a year. If we have trade between Sydxxey and
Melbourne across the boi’der without any interference
by customs laws, or for statistical purposes, why should
we not have trade equally free between Sydney and
Hobart 1 A citizen of Sydney has as much right to
take a vessel free into Hobart or Melbourne as to
cross the border free of duty by rail. Infox’mation for
statistical pui’poses can be obtained in another way.
The clear object of intercolonial fx’ee-ti’ade is to sim-
plify trade in evexy possible shape, and ships should
be allowed to go from one port in the colonies to
another without having to take out cleai’ances or
make entries each time.
Mr. MUNRO : I understand that the reason why
the amendment was proposed was that it does not
bind the federation to a certain course, but leaves the
federation to make its own arrangements. That is
really what it does; it does not compel them to do
anything.
Mr. THYNNE : I sympathise with the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. Playford, in his respect for this clause,
because it has been taken from the United States
Constitution. I think we ought to hesitate before
we eliminate the latter part of it. The hon. member,
Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, suggests the difficulty in the
case of a ship from Boston discharging part of her
goods in Melbourne or Sydney, or in any other port.
Sir Thomas Mcllwraith ; The same thing applies
to all the mail ships !
Mr. THYNNE: Under this clause those ships
would not be affected in the slightest degree. In the
words “ and vessels bound to or from one part shall
not be bound to enter, clear, or pay duty in another
part,” the words “another part,” refer to some place
other than the port from which the vessels are bound
or the port to which they are going. The hon.
member, Mr. Dibbs, has really pointed out an
instance that this clause is intended to provide for :
that is, that a vessel coming from Melbourne to
Newcastle shall not be required to pass entries at
Sydney, nor that any regulation of that kind under
the constitution shall be permitted which would give
a preference to any one port or part of a district over
another. I think that the words “ another part ”
apply to some place other than either the place from
which the ship is coming or that to which she is
going. In the place from which she is coming she
has had to pay her ordinary dues, and she will have
to pay in the place at which she arrives. This clause
has come down really as the result of some of the
oppressive navigation regulations of the old time in
the United States. That is no doubt the origin of
it, and with the hon. member, Mr. Playford, I have
every respect for the operation of this clause as
preventing what has happened in the past, and what
may happen in the future, and to keep our constitution
free from the danger against which the Americans
thought it necessary to. provide.
Amendment agreed to; clause, as amended, agreed
to.
Clause 13. The parliament of the commonwealth may, with
the consent of the parliaments of all the states, make laws
for taking over and consolidating the whole or any part of
the public debt of any state or states, but so that a state
shall be liable to indemnify the commonwealth in respect of
the amount of a debt taken over, and that the amount of
interest payable in respect of a debt shall be deducted and
retained from time to time from the share of the surplus
revenue of the commonwealth which would otherwise be
payable to the state.
Sir JOHN BRAY : With reference to this clause,
hon. members will be aware that I intimated a short
time ago that in my opinion we ought to throw on
the commonwealth immediately the responsibility of
the debts of the various colonies. It is quite true
that so far as relates to the colonies themselves it will
be necessary to make some adjustment of the amounts
that have to be borne by the commonwealth ; but,
still, in order that the states of Australia may reap
the benefits to which they may fairly look forwai’d,
from federation, it seems to me absolutely necessary
that we should provide that the commonwealth shall
undertake the responsibilities that have been incurred.
I therefore propose to move in substitution for this
clause, a clause which has been handed round, in prixxt,
I believe, to hon. members, and which reads as follows:
The commonwealth shall be liable for the public debts of
each state existing at the time of this act coming into opera-
tion, and each state shall be liable to the commonwealth for
the amount (if any) by which the public debt owing by the
state shall exceed the amount of pounds per head of
the population of such state.


It has been suggested that it would be well to make
each state liable for the full amount of its debts, and
not to provide, as I propose to do here, that a certain
fixed amount of so much per head of the population
should be intrusted entirely to the commonwealth. I
think, however, it is preferable that we should do it in
the way which I suggest here, and should distinctly
say to the commonwealth, "We intend to saddle
you with the responsibility of paying the interest on
these debts, and the debts themselves up to a certain
amount to be agreed upon, at per head of the popula
tion." If we do not do that we shall, as has been
indicated by several lion, members throughout this
discussion, be intrusting the commonwealth with a
revenue which will largely exceed their requirements,
and which will cast upon them the very difficult
and delicate task of determining how it is to be
returned. It seems to me it would be far better for
us to say at once, "You have to undertake not simply
the collection of a certain amount of revenue, but you
have also to undertake a certain amount of liability
in connection with that revenue. We shall leave
you to determine how you can fairly do this best
in the interests of all the states." In carrying this
amendment, I would point out that we do not in any
way interfere with the right of each state to borrow
what it requires for its own purposes. I, for one,
would not be inclined to do that. I feel that each
colony has its own future to work out, and must be
allowed its own way of working it out, and that the
federal government is not to say to all these different
states, " You have borrowed so much money, and you
must not borrow any more." But I say that we ought
to provide that the federal government shall undertake
the responsibility of the debts of the various colonies
at the time this bill comes into operation, and if any
other clauses may be necessary to adjust this more
definitely than my amendment, I trust they will be
agreed to. But I do ask lion, gentlemen to consider
the fact that, if we trust the commonwealth with the
collection of a large amount of revenue, the least we
can do, in order to place the treasurers of the different
colonies in a fair position to calculate their revenue
and expenditure, is to say that, while a certain amount
of their revenue is taken from them, at the same time
they shall be relieved of a certain amount of their
expenditure, which amount can be calculated so as to
act fairly and equitably between the various colonies.
In my opinion, if we neglect to take this opportunity
to do this we shall fail in the duty we have under-
taken. lam quite willing to admit, as has been stated
by the lion, member, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, that,
when the Finance Committee were considering this
matter, I was not prepared at once to ask the federal
government to assume this responsibility. But I was
one of those who suggested that we should include
a clause in our report the clause which is now
before the Committee—which would empower the
federal parliament at some future time, with the con-
sent of the different state parliaments, to take over
our debts and liabilities. It seems to me, after fully
considering the matter, that in simply empowering
them to do this we are not doing all that we ought to
do—that we ought not to empower them, but that
we should require them to do it as far as we fairly
can in the interests of the states and of the federal
government itself. As between the commonwealth
and the outside public, the commonwealth will be
liable for all the debts, and as between the common-
wealth and the states, each state will be liable for an
amount which exceeds so much per head of the popu-
lation. The commonwealth is to look to each colony
for its portion of the debt, and for its proportion of
the interest on the debt, and so far as the treasurers
of the different states are concerned they will know
that not merely a large amount of their revenue is
taken away, but that a large portion of their liability
js removed from their shoulders. It will save a great
deal of confusion if we can agree to some such scheme.
I trust the Committee will agree to some such scheme
as that indicated by my amendment, because I am
one of those who feel that we ought not simply to
leave it to the federal government to determine how
they shall spend the large amount with which they
are intrusted; but that we shall, as far as we can,
form an equitable mode of distribution, at the same
time as we intrust it to them. I therefore move, in
the first instance :
That the clause be amended by the omission of the words
“ The parliament of,” line 1. ,
Sir Samuel Griffith : Are wo to understand that
the whole question of taking over the debts is to be
discussed on this amendment 1
Sir John Bray : Yes !
Mr. Dibbs : Why not move to omit the Avhole
clause for the purpose of putting something else in, so
that we may discuss the whole question h
The Chairman : The parliamentary course would
be to negative the clause, and to propose a new clause
subsequently.
Amendment proposed,
Mr. DEAKIN: The extreme gravity of the proposal
which is now before the Committee is scarcely likely
to be undervalued. This is a deliberate proposal to
saddle the commonwealth at the outset of its career
with a debt of considerably over <£100,000,000.
Mr. Munro : £180,000,000 !
Mr. Baker : £143,000,000, excluding New Zealand!
Mr, DEAKIN; With a debt of nearly£lso,ooo,ooo,
even excluding New Zealand. Then, sir, it is per-
fectly clear, and I take it that the lion, member, Sir
John Bray, is seized of the fact, that his amend-
ment, if carried as a whole, would only be the first
of a series of clauses which would be required to deal
with this question in its consequential aspects.
Nevertheless, it raises the financial issue at once.
The prospect is one from which, like the lion, member,
Sir John Bray, I must confess, I would have shrunk
at an earlier stage of our proceedings; but in listening
to the debates which have taken place on the financial
questions in connection with the commonwealth,
especially in listening to the discussion to-day in
connection with the surplus, the disposal of which
has proved so great a task to the Committee, I must
confess myself prepared to take a very much more
favourable view even of this startling proposition than
I should have done a few days ago. The more we
consider it, the more I think we shall agree that the
plan which we submit to the people of the various
colonies, by which their governments are deprived of
an immense source of revenue, and by which the
commonwealth is endowed with an enormous surplus
from the very day on which it comes into existence, is
certain to be used against us by all opponents of this
bill. It will be said that the several states have a
poor guarantee of receiving anything if you intrust the
commonwealth with such powers as are embodied in
this measure —if you intrust it with this amount of
money, and require it, before returning anything to
the colonies, to discharge any and all of its obligations.
We shall be told again and again by those who desire
to oppose the commonwealth that the colonies will, in
the course of a year or so, see nothing of the customs
revenue they are now asked to surrender. Upon this
point I think the remarks of the lion, member, Sir
Harry Atkinson, a day or two ago were extremely
pertinent, as they were also the chief cause of modify-
ing my own opinion on the subject. The position he
put is one that will recommend itself to those friends
of the commonwealth who desire at the outset that its
policy shall be one of strict economy. Perhaps it
would be premature to pass too positive an opinion
at the present moment; but assuming that calcula-
tions were sufficient to assure us that we were not
undertaking too extreme a step, it certainly would
be an enormous advantage in commending this measure


to the people of the various colonies if, instead of
their being asked to surrender an immense revenue,
without any definitely determined return, they were
shown that the revenue taken from them is at once
applied to purposes in which they are immediately
interested that if, on the one hand, we deprive
them of that source of revenue which keeps their
coffers full, we, on the other hand, deprive them of
liabilities which empty their coffers. I believe that
certain calculations have been prepared which tend to
show that it would be possible, even with a customs
revenue based upon a tariff such as that of Victoria,
for the federal parliament to discharge the whole,
or almost the whole, of the interest on the debts
of the colonies of Australia, if not of Australasia.
That being the case, the question is certainly worthy
even at this late stage of our deliberations, of the
most careful consideration of the Committee, whether
on the faith of such calculations we might not take
a bold step that would put us before our consti-
tuents in quite a different position —in the position
of recommending a commonwealth that from its com-
mencement will have liabilities requiring from those
who may be intrusted with its direction the strictest
scrutiny of every particular of public expenditure,
and thus imbuing them at the outset of their career
with habits of close economy. This would be a
great recommendation from both points of view—as
relieving the states immensely, and as, in another
sense of the term, relieving the commonwealth of that
surplus about which we have had such a warm debate.
It may be necessary, before we finally commit our-
selves to the proposal that other clauses, to make the
scheme complete, should be adopted. But the diffi-
culties we have had to encounter upon the floor of this
chamber with regard to the surplus are trifles com-
pared with the difficulties we shall have to encounter
on the hustings when we are face to face with our
constituents and with the opponents of federation.
This question of the finances will be used against us
to the utmost extent, and I think we should have a
good answer if we were to adopt this proposal, and
that we should at the same time be giving to federa-
tion a great momentum. The desire of being relieved
of a largo measure of liability will operate as power-
fully with the colonies in favour of federation as a
design to deprive them of customs revenue may meet
with resistance. If this proposal can be justified, I
take it that this bill will go commended to the various
colonies much more than it would in its present aspect.
I rose in default of other hon. members, who did not
appear willing to debate the question at so early a
stage. I trust the treasurers of the various colonies
will give us the benefit of their experience, because if
this proposal be as feasible as it now appears, it will
be a most advantageous one to adopt in the interests
of the commonwealth.
Mr. McMILLAN : I should like to explain my
position in this matter, because it is perhaps rather a
curious one. I thoroughly believe in the consolidation
of the debts of the colonies ultimately; but I think
we have just reached that stage of our proceedings
when we are liable to go too far. I believe we are
going beyond the principles we ought to lay down for
ourselves in dealing with the question of federation.
My hon, friend, who has just resumed his seat, sees
very clearly, as possibly do other hon. members, that
if we take over the debts of the colonies, and make
ourselves liable for the interest, we shall get rid of
this dangerous surplus. I am quite willing to confess
that in the hands of some treasurers that surplus
would be a very great danger indeed. But there are a
great many consequences arising out of such a course
as is pi’oposed. In the first place, if you take over all
the debts you must regulate the borrowing in the
future, and with colonies under such different condi-
tions it seems to me that if we now enter upon this
dangerous ground we shall open for ourselves a battery
of opposition on the part of some of the colonies which
it will be absolutely impossible to silence. In dealing
with this question as a whole, what I take it we have
to do in regard to salient questions of great importance
in connection with the future is to see that the federal
parliament has power to deal with them. But these
questions, which it may be necessary to deal with in
the future, are great bones of contention at the present
time, and it would be foolish for us, in view of the
necessity to make this bill palatable to our parliaments,
to enter upon new departures which may receive the
utmost opposition.
Colonel Smith : Who is to oppose them 1
Mr. McMILLAN : I am endeavouring to explain
in the most ordinary English I can adopt. Take the
position of New South Wales as compared with that
of Victoria. Victoria is a comparatively consolidated
colony; it has a railway system which, at any rate for
certain purposes, has practically opened up the whole
of its territory; but New South Wales and Queens-
land are practically only beginning to open up theirs.
They have done a great deal. We, in New South
Wales, have done a great deal; but we have in hand
at the present moment schemes with reference to our
railway system which will involve loans, and the very
policy we are now adopting may be looked upon in the
future as an anti-federal policy. Consequently, if you
attempt to take over the debts as they stand now, you
must carry consequential clauses that will deal with
the future policies of the colonies.
Mr. Deakin : Why 1
Mr. McMILLAN : Certainly, because you cannot
have two classes of debts.
Mr. Deakin : Why not 1
Mr. McMILLAN : Surely the hon. member, if he
has any pretension to a knowledge of finance, does not
believe that we should have a consolidated common-
wealth debt in respect of works already carried out,
and that we should have new debts, at the same time,
on the part of the various provincial parliaments.
Mr. Deakin : We are bound to have that in any
case !
Mr. McMILLAN : The only advantage of consolid-
ating the debts of the colonies is that all borrowings
for large undertakings may be under the auspices of
the federal government. The hon. member does not
surely propose for one moment that we should con-
solidate these debts, amounting in the aggregate to
£181,000,000, and that we should then alloAv New
South Wales to expend £4,0(f0,000 or £5,000,000 of
loan money borrowed under different conditions and
guarantees. Let the hon. member consider what that
would open up, and he will see that it is absolutely
impossible. I appeal to any financial man. The
whole benefit arising from the dealing with this
question consists of the unification of stock. Of
course, there will be municipal loans, guaranteed by
the provincial governments or raised in other ways,
but for all large undertakings, if once the federal
parliament takes over the present debts, it must
negotiate and control future loans.
Mr. Deakin : Why 1
Mr, McMILLAN : If I am liable for certain debts,
if I am liable for money borrowed for certain under-
takings, surely I must have control of those under-
takings more or less. Surely, before a loan would be
projected by one colony, it should have the recognition
of the federal government. Then look at what you
would open up. Not that I say it may not be opened
up in the future—but it will be a very debatable
question in the different colonies. You open up the
question with regard to the great public undertakings
of the different colonies being canvassed in the federal
parliament. Ido not say that it will not come to
that; but the federal spirit will have to be in existence
some years, and will have to grow beyond its present
proportions, before that will be assented to.


Mr. Dibbs : If we agree to this clause, we may as
well procure a hundred weight of dynamite and blow
the whole thing up !
Mr. McMILLAN: That would be a veritable
bomb-shell. If we simply give, as this bill gives, to
the federal parliament the right to negotiate with the
other parliaments—and I believe a great deal will be
done in future by negotiation, and that a great deal
will be undertaken by negotiation that is not provided
for in the four corners of this constitution—and if we
imply by this clause that such a thing may be a benefit
in future to all the parties concerned, we shall go as
far as we possibly can. I warn hon. members who are
anxious to see this federation carried into effect, that
if they vote for the amendment they will agree to a
proposal which will do more to shatter the whole
fabric we have been trying to erect than almost any
other point of contention we have had before us could
effect.
Mr. Deakin : Why 1
Mr. McMILLAN : I even go so far as to say that
I hope the loans will be consolidated, and that some
arrangement may be made in the future which will be
consonant with, the views of the different colonies.
But, at the same time, I see that that very project is
surrounded with enormous difficulty, and that it is not
we who have to thrash out that difficulty. It must
be a matter for the future. I certainly think that
those who are in favour of a bill which will be accept-
able to all the parliaments of the different colonies
should negative the amendment now before us.
Colonel SMITH : I confess I am somewhat surprised
at the remarks of the hon. member, Mr. McMillan.
At the Melbourne Conference, and in the opening
debate at this Convention, the hon. gentleman was
strongly in favour of some course of this kind being
adopted.
Mr. McMillan : In the future, certainly !
Colonel SMITH : He stated at Melbourne that he
had not the slightest doubt that in the course of time
the dominion parliament would be able to borrow
money not alone in London, but on any of the bourses
of Europe at from to 1 per cent, less than the price
at which individual colonies can borrow now. That
would ultimately result in a very large saving. It is
intended to hand over to the federal parliament a
revenue of £9,000,000, while the expenditure of the
federal government would only be about £2,250,000.
The balance would have to be refunded to the different
states. I contend that each colony might retain all
its railways, while the customs revenue, if properly
applied by the dominion parliament, would not only
pay the working expenses of the dominion, but would
also pay the whole of the interest on the public debt.
If the hon. gentleman had said that we ought to divide
the loans which have been expended on reproductive
works from the loans which have been expended on
non-reproductive works, I could have understood him.
It might be necessary to divide the loans in that way,
and let the various colonies be responsible for the
money expended upon the non-reproductive works.
I quite agree with the hon. member, Sir John Bray,
that we ought not to ask the federal parliament to
refund any of the revenue ; but it should take over
obligations from the states, such as the payment of
interest on the debts which have accrued. Wo ought
to place ourselves in such a strong position that the
dominion parliament could guarantee loans. For
instance, they want a railway in Western Australia
about 800 miles long. If that project commended
itself to the dominion parliament, they might say,
“ On certain conditions we will guarantee that loan
for you.” That would make a difference of at least
£ per cent., and possibly more on the amount borrowed,
and the expenditure would do more to open up that
enormous territory than anything else that could be
done. I hope hon. members will not be led astray
by the hon. member, Mr. McMillan, because he blew
hot at Melbourne, and he blows cold here.
Mr. McMillan : No; lam quite consistent!
Colonel SMITH : He has given us no reason what-
ever in support of his views. He says that all this
may be done by and by, but when we open the door
for him he wants to close it. Such a proposal would
be of advantage not only to the larger colonies, but
to the whole group, and I hope hon. members will not
hesitate to prepare the way by adopting the amend-
ment of the lion, member, Sir John Bray, so that the
federal parliament may have the power to do this if
they think it is desirable. The hon. member, Mr.
McMillan, talked about opposition to this proposal.
Who will oppose it ? Will any of the parliaments
oppose a proposal that the colonial debt should be
taken over and consolidated? Not a single parlia-
ment in the whole group would do so. lam surprised
that the hon. member, Mr. McMillan, who is a
financial man, should raise objections to this proposal
after speaking so strongly in favour of it at Mel-
bourne.
Mr. McMillan : Perhaps the hon. member will
allow me to explain that what I said was that the
union of the colonies would very largely increase
their credit. I still think that whether or not the
debts are consolidated the mere fact of federation
will increase the credit of the colonies.
Colonel SMITH : All I contend for is that the
power should be given to do this. The hon. membei’,
Mr, McMillan, said that if this clause were passed, a
number of consequential clauses ought also to be
passed. Why should not that be done, and why
should not the debts be consolidated? When the
colonial debts become due, and a fresh loan has to be
floated, it would be infinitely better if that operation
were carried out by the dominion government. One
hon, member has gone so far as to say that we have
already reached the limit of our borrowing powers.
If so, it is far better that the whole of the debts
should be dealt with by a federation.
Mr. DIBBS : It is too bad for the hon. member,
Colonel Smith, to taunt the hon. member, Mr.
McMillan, with what he said at Melbourne last year.
He then spoke under the influence of the very gener-
ous treatment which the New South Wales represen-
tatives received there. The delegates were not then
bound down to particulars. It is when you come to
the details of a bill that you have to call things by
their names. With the details which are now placed
before us it cannot surely be expected that the hon.
member, Mr. McMillan, will speak in the “hifalutin”
strain in which he spoke at Melbourne. This is a
hard matter of fact. What would be the effect of
this proposal on New South Wales? And the hon.
member, Mr. McMillan, knows perfectly well that if
he proposed in our parliament a constitution with
such a clause in it as that now suggested—l do not
know whether the parliament would be carried out on
a shutter, but the hon. member certainly would be.
The Parliament of New South Wales is not at present
prepared to federate its debt. I notice that hon.
members have been talking about what a nice con-
venient thing it would be if the commonwealth were
to take over the debts of the colonies ] but what about
the other important side of the question ? What
about federating the assets ? That is the most import-
ant question. The people of New South Wales
believe that as far as the assets are concerned they
stand in a position superior to that of even our
wealthy neighbours in Victoria. I suppose the differ-
ence in the London market is 97 and 103 for 3| per
cent, debentures.
Mr. Munro : Nothing like it !
Mr. DIBBS : I should be prepared to guarantee the
floating of a Victorian £3,000,000 loan if it was wired
to England that the Convention had unanimously
agreed that the commonwealth should take over the
O


debts. I think the Convention is going decidedly too
far. This clause should come out of the bill altogether.
We started on our enterprise of endeavouring to frame
a constitution in a moderate way. The modesty of
the speakers, and the small length which they proposed
to go in inserting merely the thin edge of the wedge of
federation people could appreciate. The idea gradually
grew step by step until unification became the object.
That was the idea with which we started ; but it
appears that as hon. members found themselves away
from the public eye they began to talk wildly and
boldly, and now they propose that the commonwealth
shall start with a debt of £181,000,000. The proposal
is so diametrically opposed to the interests of New
South Wales that I am certain that if it were stated
that the government proposed to submit to parliament
a scheme of federation, our debts to be thrown in, and
with our debts our assets, the thing would be scouted
on every hustings in the country. The matter is going
too far. If we sat another month or two we should
have the hon. member, Mr. Deakin, coming forward
with a proposal to do away with,the commonwealth of
Australasia, and to have a flag of our own. That will
come next. We are going too far in asking that the
federal parliament should take over the whole of the
public debts. I agree with the hon. member, Mr.
McMillan, that that will come in time. No doubt our
public debts will become federated, but to attempt
now to rush the people of the various colonies to give
up the whole of their assets, and tie their hands as to
future borrowings, limiting their right to so much per
head of the population, would be an outrage on the
people, which, as far as this colony is concerned, would
make any attempt at federation an impossibility. I
am certain that it would only be necessary to nail up
on the hustings the announcement that it was proposed
to hand over the assets of New South Wales to a
federal parliament
Sir John Bray : There is no such proposal!
Mr. DIBBS : How stupid we are in New South
Wales ! If you take over the liabilities surely you
must take over the assets with them !
Hon. Members : No !
Mr. DIBBS : It would be a farce for the com-
monwealth to accept liabilities amounting to
£181,000,000, and to have no security over the
assets. The thing is an absurdity on the face of it.
It only requires that we should sit a little longer for
some more foolish proposal to be made. The assets
must go with the liabilities ; you cannot separate
them. Our liabilities at present are secured on our
assets; and if the commonwealth takes over the
liabilities, they want something more than the revenue
derived from customs duties to cover the liabilities.
Mr. Deakin ; The customs revenue is more than
the interest now !
Mr. DIBBS : Some figures were given us by Sir
Thomas Mcllwraith, and I have a paper here which
contains the amounts.
Mr. Deakin : The interest is under £7,000,000,
and the customs revenue is £8,600,000 !
Mr. DIBBS ; The interest is shown by the paper
in my hands to be £7,545,000, with loans amounting
to £181,847,271.
An Hon. Member : That includes New Zealand !
Mr. DIBBS : What are the New Zealand dele-
gates here for ? I presume that the federation is to
include the whole of Australasia, or those gentlemen
would not be here. The total loans outstanding is over
£181,000,000, and the interest payable is £7,545,000.
Mr. Deakin ; Turn to page 32. The total amount
of the import duties is £8,600,000 !
Mr. DIBBS ; How are the expenses of the federal
government to be defrayed ?
Mr. Deakin : They would have £1,500,000 !
Mr. DIBBS : Then you are going for some form of
property taxation ; that is what will follow.
Colonel Smith : No !
Mr. DIBBS : Will the hon. member, Sir Thomas
Mcllwraith, say now what the proposed cost of the
federal government is to be ?
Sir Thomas Mcllwraith ; It was the Treasurer of
New South Wales who stated it!
Mr. DIBBS : I do not believe the Treasurer of
New South Wales, lam told that the expenses of
the federal government will be £2,250,000 per annum,
and there would be £7,500,000 for interest, making
altogether £9,750,000, and the customs revenue under
the tariff will be about £8,700,000.
Mr. Deakin : That is the present tariff. We shall
have a great deal more !
Mr. DIBBS: It clearly shows that property will have
to be taxed considerably to make up the deficiency.
Mr. Deakin : No ; you have the post-office, too !
Mr. DIBBS : Our post-office and the post-offices
generally are not sources of income.
Mr. Deakin : And you will have a saving in the
interest !
Mr. DIBBS : I admit that when the day comes
when the colonies of Australia are united as the
United States of America have united, our public
debt will be more saleable in the markets of the
world where the money comes from. But then the
whole thing would have to be changed to accomplish
that. At present we are dealing with a federation
which is not to be a union, but only a loose form of
federation, and, in addition to that, it is proposed
that the commonwealth should take upon itself a
most extraordinary responsibility in regard to our
debts, whilst it is given no control over the assets.
To my commercial mind, if you assume liabilities you
must have the control of the assets. Say what you
will, if the liabilities are pooled the assets must be
pooled to. I may, by way of warning, say, that if you
want to excite the antipathy of the whole of New
South Wales towards federation, the idea of handing
over our liabilities to the commonwealth, and with
them the assets of the country, will produce that
result.
Mr. Clark : No !
Mr. DIBBS : The people in England will look at
the matter with a clear eye. They will say, “ These
colonies are pooling their debts for the purpose of
getting cheaper money. What assets and what security
have they 1” We will reply that we offer the security
of the whole of Australia ; therefore the common-
wealth if it takes the liabilities must take .also the
assets. 1 remember a friend of mine, who was an
Irishman, going once to a gentleman in charge of one
of the English banks established here, and wanting to
satisfy him that he was entitled to borrow from the
bank a loan of £40,000. The banker very naturally
asked him for a balance-sheet showing his assets and
liabilities. He brought a list of his assets, and the
banker at once said, “ Now, I want to see a list of
your liabilities,” and the Irishman turned round and
said, “Do you want to insult me?” We should insult
the people of England if we attempted to consolidate
our debts and did not show them that the assets were
there attachable to the liabilities. Any consolidation
of debts must be accompanied by a consolidation of
assets. The people of New South Wales will be no
parties to allowing their assets to be thrown into one
common pool—at least at the present stage.
Mr. BIRD : Nothing that has taken place since the
Convention met has astonished me so much as the
position now taken up by the New South Wales
delegates, Mr. McMillan and Mr. Dibbs. Prior to the
light thrown upon Mr. Dibbs’ opposition to the proposal
to take over the whole of the debts, which he indicated
in his belief that the assets of the colonies must go
with the liabilities thus taken over, I was really
wondering on what grounds either he or Mr. McMillan
could raise any objection or have any fear in regard
to the consolidation of the debts.


Mr. McMillan : I never said that the assets and
the debts should go together. I said that future ex-
penditure would have to be controlled !
Mr. BIRD: If the hon. gentleman objects on
another ground than that of Mr. Dibbs, I can only say
that I am still more surprised that he takes up the
position he does; because it seems to me that there is
some ground of objection to handing over all the
liabilities of New South Wales if all the assets are to
go with them \ but on what ground objection can be
raised to the liabilities being taken over if the assets
are to be held by the colony itself, I am at a loss to
see. Nothing but gain can accrue to New South
Wales or any other colony by allowing the common-
wealth to take over all the liabilities. Surely, as soon
as it is possible to convert the existing loans from the
somewhat high rates which some of them now bear to
lower rates—a process which may be taken in hand
even before some of the bonds mature, and which
certainly can take place as the obligations fall in—as
soon as that can be done, there is no doubt that the
commonwealth will be an infinite gainer. In the
course of time we shall save, in the matter alone of
interest on the public debts of the colonies, sufficient
to cover the whole of the expense of the federal govern-
ment, apart from the services and outside matters of
that sort belonging to the conduct of the federal govern-
ment. Surely the prospective gain of £500,000 or
£750,000 —or it may amount in the course of time to
nearly £1,000,000 —in the matter of interest alone, is
a saving in connection with the debts of the colonies
that ought to lead every member who has to do with the
financial affairs of any colony, to jump at once at the
proposal to hand over the debts to the commonwealth.
The hon. member, Mr. McMillan, seems to fear that
this will interfere somewhat with the future borrowing
of the various colonies. I cannot see how difficulty is
going to arise even there. If, a few years after the
debts existing at the time of federation were taken over,
the hon. gentleman, as the treasurer of New South
Wales, desired to borrow £4,000,000 or £5,000,000
for public works, and knew that by getting the guaran-
tee of the federal government he could secure that loan
at per cent, less than by going into the market on
his own account, surely the people of New South
Wales would raise no objection to the federal govern-
ment being asked to borrow the money.
Mr, McMillan : Yes, but under this proposal you
could not borrow at all without their leave !
Mr. BIRD : Under the proposal as it now stands
provision is simply made for taking over the debts,
Mr. McMillan ; The present debts !
Mr. BIRD : Yes.
Mr. McMillan : It would be absurd to take over the
present debts without also taking over future debts !
Mr. BIRD : I quite agree with the hon. gentleman
that the words seem to indicate a necessity for some-
thing further, and we shall have to insert a clause
which will provide for dealing with debts of states
which may come in aftenvards, for the consolidation
of those debts, and also for securing further loans
for the states already in the federation who may
want to increase their indebtedness for the purpose
of extending their public works. That is an addi-
tional clause which, I think, we will all agree
to insert. That being so, I fail to see on what
ground the treasurer of any colony in the group
can object to the commonwealth taking over the
liabilities as now proposed. The hon, member, Mr,
Dibbs, appeared to be unable to see, notwithstanding
the interjections that were thrown out while he spoke,
that the liabilities of the colonies could be taken over
while the assets in the shape of railways and other
reproductive works were not taken over. If we hand
over to the commonwealth sufficient revenue for the
purposes of the general government, and of paying
the interest on all the debts, surely in a sense we give
it assets enough. It needs nothing more. It has
been stated by two or three hon. members that figures
can be produced showing that if we hand over the
whole of the customs revenue to the commonwealth,
it will not only have ample funds to pay interest on
the debts now existing, but also sufficient for the
purposes of federal government. Perhaps I may be
allowed to refer to some figures which 1 have taken
the trouble to prepare in order to show that in almost
all the colonies the customs revenue is more than
ample to cover the interest on the debt. In New
South Wales the customs and excise revenue, taking
as a basis the year 1889, amounts to £2,200,000,
while the total interest on the debt is only £1,800,000,
leaving a balance of £400,000, which is more than
sufficient to pay the share of the colony in the cost of
the general government. In Victoria Ave find a still
better condition of things, for while they contribute a
revenue of £3,040,000, the interest on their debt is only
£1,672,000. Queensland is in a similar position, her
customs revenue being over £200,000 more than the
interest upon her debt. South Australia is an excep-
tion; the revenue from her customs and excise amounts
only to £573,000, while the interest on the debt is
£878,000. I apprehend that a large proportion of the
public debt of South Australia has been incurred in
the construction of the trans-continental telegraph
line, and as that will be one of the items of property
to be taken over by the commonwealth in connection
with the postal and telegraph departments, South
Australia will be relieved to a very large extent of this
excess of interest on the debt over the revenue pro-
vided. And so I might go through all the colonies.
Taking the figures as I have taken them, the fact is
patent that there is more than enough revenue pro-
vided by the colonies at the present time to pay the
Avhole of the interest on their public debts without
handing over any other assets whatever, and it is
perfectly plain that, in order to continue this condi-
tion of things, whatever alterations are made in the
tariffs taxation must be imposed only to such an
extent as to keep up the relative proportion between
the tAvo amounts. I feel very strongly Avith those Avho
have held that in giving over all these revenues to the
commonAvcalth Ave ought to hand over with them
liabilities equivalent thereto, and that it is most
dangerous to leave in the hands of the commonwealth
such a large surplus as there will be unless these debts
are handed over to it. For these reasons, which I
trust Avill commend themselves to the judgment of the
Convention, and especially of those members of it
Avho have expressed their strong opposition to the pro-
posal of the hon. member, Sir John Bray, I feel com-
pelled to support to the utmost of my power the
amendment which he has moved. The only question
about which I am uncertain is Avhether Ave should fix
the amount which the hon. member has left blank.
My own idea is that Ave should endeavour to fix it at
some such sum as £4O per head, which represents the
minimum indebtedness of any of the colonies; but
that is a matter of detail which may be left out of
consideration; though, if we leave it open to the
federal parliament to decide, we incur some of the
dangers that Ave want to avoid by throwing the whole
of the debts of the colonies upon the commonwealth ;
because the federal parliament might fix the limit
beyond Avhich the colonies should be liable at so lOAV
an amount as to defeat our object. My own idea is
to fix the amount at something like £4O, leaving the
rest to be provided for by the colonies themselves in
due course. This, however, is a point of minor im-
portance and otherwise I agree Avith the amendment
of the lion, member, Sir John Bray.
Mr. MUNRO : I am afraid we are entering upon
very dangerous ground. There is not the least doubt
that it would be of great advantage to the colonies to
have their debts taken over by the commonwealth.
It Avould be very convenient for many of us if some
one would take over our debts and be responsible for


them ; but we have to take into consideration the
whole consequence of this proposal, and I feel that in
the clause as it stands we are going as far as prudence
authorises us to go, because the clause provides that
the commonwealth may make arrangements with the
parliaments of the various colonies for the purpose of
taking over their debts. It has been said that in
handing over the debts of the colonies to the common-
wealth you do not also propose to hand over the
assets; but I think that would be a very imprudent
course. I do not think that it would be wise on the
part of the commonwealth to take over debts amount-
ing at the present time to <£181,000,000, and which
will probably in a short time amount to <£184,000,000
or £185,000,000, or, in round numbers, about
£200,000,000, unless some arrangement of a satis-
factory character is made to the effect that the
colonies whose debts the commonwealth takes over
shall not run into other large debts, because if you
relieve them of their pressing liabilities and leave
them to run into debt again just as they think proper,
the result may be disastrous.
Mr. Gillies ; That is a very important point!
Mr. MUNRO : It is the essence of the whole ques-
tion. If the colonies want to be relieved of their
debts merely with a view to incurring other debts,
they will gain no relief, because they will be respon-
sible for the interest of the debts which the common-
wealth takes over, in addition to that of their future
debts. And it seems to me that there will be a still
greater difficulty for the states to meet if the common-
wealth is to take over their existing debts, and to have
power to borrow on its own account, on the English
market, for its own purposes, without guaranteeing
the future loans raised by them, inasmuch as those
loans will be at a heavy discount, because no single
state could occupy the same position in the market as
the commonwealth would occupy.
Mr. McMillan : You could not have two classes of
stock !
Mr. MUNRO : Then you must have one of two
things. The commonwealth must take the responsi-
bility of all the borrowing, or prevent future debts
from being incurred without its consent.
Mr. Fitzgerald : No loan could be raised by any
state without the authority of the federal government!
Mr. MUNRO : Are hon. members prepared to
take the responsibility of saying to the parliaments of
their various colonies, “ You shall not borrow another
shilling without the consent of the federal govern-
ment” 1
Colonel Smith : A municipal corporation can borrow
without the consent of the state parliament, and why
should not the state parliament have a similar power?
Mr. MUNRO : The hon. member is going away
from the question with which I am dealing. The
municipal corporations that borrow upon the security
of their own assets can only do so upon the authority
of an act of parliament giving them that power ; but
the parliament that gives the power to borrow did not
take over their debts. What is proposed now is, that
the commonwealth should take over the existing debts
of the colonies ; and I say that, if it takes over those
debts, we must either provide that it shall become
responsible for all future debts, or prevent future debts
from being incurred without its authority. Arc hon.
members prepared to take up that position 1 I ven-
ture to say that very few of us are ; and unless we are
prepared to take up that position, we cannot at the
present time deal intelligently with the question. In
the clause we take all the authority which we can
prudently take with a view to beginning the federa-
tion ; and at a future time I should be delighted to
see the commonwealth take up the position which it is
now proposed that it should take; but I do not want
to see it done until they can do it effectively, and with
advantage to everybody concerned. If the amendment
proposed by the hon. member, Sir John Bray, is agreed
to, the result will be that the Convention will not be
able to close for a fortnight or three weeks, because wo
could not, as men responsible to our various colonies
and to the commonwealth, come to a conclusion on this
question without taking time to consider its defects,
and to work out all the details in connection with it
to see what the result would be. All that we have
undertaken at the present time is to put a provision
in the Constitution Bill by which the common wealth
may make arrangements in the future with the parlia-
ments of the various states. That will give them time
to go into the matter and deal with it in an intelli-
gent manner, which will be satisfactory to all con-
cerned ; but if we, who have no authority to do any-
thing of the sort, provide that the debts of the colonies
shall be taken over by the commonwealth we must, as
I said, continue to sit here for a fortnight or three
weeks longer to work out the details of the 'proposal
so that we may see what its effect will be. I trust
that we shall confine ourselves to the provisions of the
clause as it stands, and I am sure that they go as far
as we can prudently go at the present time.
Mr. GILLIES : I agree, generally, with the speech
of the hon. member, Mr. Munro, not but what I
would like, if under existing circumstances we cculd
see our way, to adopt the amendment submitted, with,
unquestionably, certain modifications which would be
necessary to carry out any such proposal under the
circumstances. 1 had no doubt, at the moment the
proposal was submitted, of the result, I was as con-
fident as I am that I stand here that it would have
no support from New South Wales j on the contrary,
that it would receive the strongest possible opposition
on grounds which I need not now mention, but which
I am perfectly certain are quite within the knowledge
of members of the Constitutional Committee. I think,
from that point of view, it would be quite unnecessary
to discuss the question at this stage, because I feel
conficfcnt that we should be informed by the delegates
of New South Wales that they would decline to recom-
mend to their parliament any such proposal. Although
great results might be accomplished by the proposal—•
and I can quite well understand some of the views
which have been urged in support of it—l feel per-
fectly certain that the time is not ripe to enable us to
carry out anything of the kind. I think it is better,
under the circumstances, not to say too much on the
subject, because I feel confident that all we might say
would be quite in vain.
Amendment negatived.
Sir JOHN BRAY : Before the clause, as a whole,
is submitted, I desire to say frankly, as I have said
before, that when we first met I was not prepared to
make this proposal, but the matter has been growing
in my mind, as it has in the minds of other hon.
members. I think that it is a mistake on our part
not to have some such provision as that which I have
suggested. I can only say that I never for one
moment intended that by adopting the course I have
proposed, or by adopting the course defined in the
bill, the different colonies should be prevented from
borrowing whatever money they require for their
own purposes. They can do that on their own credit.
An Hon Member : Without the leave of the com-
monwealth 1
Sir JOHN BR AY : Yes ; the commonwealth may
guarantee loans in certain cases ; but no one would
suggest that, in the absence of that, the separate
colonies should be prevented from borrowing. I
trust, although I am not able to carry the proposal,
that the commonwealth will take early steps to
achieve the objects I have suggested, because it
appears to me, as I have already stated, that the
great defect of the bill is that we do not sufficiently
and definitely define the means of appropriating the
revenue with which we propose to intrust them.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : It has been suggested
since the clause was drawn and brought up by the


committee that power to take over the debts under
certain circumstances ought to be accompanied by a
corresponding power to take over the assets, under
conditions.
Mr. Gillies : There is power in the clause to make
terms !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I am very much dis-
posed to think that this will happen ; that the federal
parliament will take over the trunk lines of railway—
perhaps one, perhaps several. Why should they not
have power to do so ? I entertain some doubts as to
whether they have that power. Several hon, members
spoke to me on the subject, and I think the matter is
worthy of consideration. I think it would be
desirable to give express power for the taking over of
any public works of any of the states by the federal
parliament, of course with the consent of the parlia-
ments.
Sir John Bray : Put it in another clause !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : This is the place to
put it. I doubt very much whether they possess the
power. If we consider it worth while to give them
the power, the clause should read :
May make laws for taking over and consolidating the whole
or any part of the public debt of any state or states, or for
taking over any public works of any state or states.
I mention the matter because several hon. members
have asked me to do so.
Mr. THYNNE : In the next clause restrictions are
placed on the power of the federal parliament which
are very much greater than the power given for the
amendment of the constitution itself. We provide in
another part of the bill that the constitution itself,
and even this very clause, may be altered without the
consent of all the states in the confederation, and now
we propose to insert this clause restricting the action
of the commonwealth, which cannot act in the direction
desired unless every state concurs. It seems illogical
to require that the concurrence of every state in the
commonwealth should be insisted upon, whilst we can
alter the constitution itself with the consent of a certain
proportion of the states. I think there should be some
alteration in the clause, and that a majority of two-
thirds of the states, or something of that kind, should
be required. This will enable the federal parliament,
with some reasonable prospect of doing practical busi-
ness, to investigate the question of taking over the
debts. But if the parliament of the commonwealth
cannot enter upon the question unless they are satisfied
that every one of the state parliaments is agreeable
to work with them, they will be discouraged from ever
undertaking it.
Clause, as read, agreed to.
chapter v.-the states.
Clause 1 (Continuance of powers of parliaments of the
states).
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I desire to make a
verbal amendment in this clause. It states :
All powers which at the date of the establishment of the
commonwealth are vested in the parliaments of the several
colonies, and which are not by this constitution exclusively
vested in the parliament of the commonwealth, and all powers
which the parliaments of the several states are not by this
constitution forbidden to exercise, are reserved to
I think that that expression is not adequate, A great
many of their powers which they are not forbidden to
exercise might be withdrawn from them by the exer-
cise of similar powers by the parliament of the com-
monwealth, and the clause would be more accurate
and less liable to criticism if it read, “and which are
not by this constitution exclusively vested in the par-
liament of the commonwealth, or withdrawn from the
parliaments of the several states.” I move :
That the words “ and all powers which,” lines 4 and 5, be
omitted, with the view to insert in their place the words “ or
withdrawn from.”
Mr. GILLIES : Say it in express enactment. The
hon. and learned member, Sir Samuel Griffith, will,
perhaps, remember that a statement was made by an
hon. member of the Convention to the effect that the
power of borrowing money having been granted under
this bill to the federal parliament will exclude the local
legislatures from being able to borrow money. I be-
lieve there is no foundation whatever for that state-
ment.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: None whatever.
Words like “express enactment” do not mean any-
thing.
Amendment agreed to.
Amendment (by Sir Samuel Griffith) agreed to :
That the clause be further amended by omitting the words
“are not by this constitution forbidden to exercise.”
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
Clause 5. All references or communications required by the
constitution of any state or otherwise to be made by the
governor of the state to the Queen shall be made through the
governor-general, as her Majesty’s representative in the com-
monwealth, and the Queen’s pleasure shall be made known
through him.
Mr. GILLIES : I propose to ask the Committee to
omit this clause. Ido not desire to make many obser-
vations. I believe that we were not called upon by
our respective colonies, who gave us authority to come
here, to interfere in the slightest degree whatever
with the governments of the states. • In addition to
that, it is not necessary. The mere fact that a local
parliament passes a bill, and that that bill, if it has to
be sent home, must be sent through the governor-
general, and not through the governor of the state, I
feel confident will create a great d&al of irritation in
the various colonies.
Sir Samuel Griffith ; Not at all!
Mr. GILLIES : I can say to the hon. gentleman
that it has created a great deal of irritation in some
of the colonies already, and I have contended con-
stantly that where a provision is not necessary to the
creation of the constitution it ought not to be inserted.
It is far better to err on the safe side. It is a mere
piece of imagination that there is anything inconsistent
in creating a governor-general, and in allowing a
governor to communicate with the Crown. There is
no inconsistency at all, and in my judgment it is not
necessary that a clause of this kind should be inserted,
because unquestionably it interferes with the present
position of state governors, and I consider that ought
not to be done. We ought not to create anything
likely to beget antagonism to any portion of this bill.
We shall have trouble enough without that; and I
confidently believe that everything of this kind that
we insert in the bill will beget opposition elsewhere,
where we do not desire opposition.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : In my opinion this is
a very important provision, but I doubt very much
whether this late hour of the day is a good time to go
into the matter. What the hon. member, Mr, Gillies,
maintains is that after the establishment of the com-
monwealth, the governments of the different states
should be in direct communication with the Queen’s
government in London, each pulling in different
directions, as they have done before.
Mr. Gillies : No !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : That is what the lion,
member proposes.
Mr. Gillies : Certainly not!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Well, the hon. mem-
bers proposes to leav.e that state of things existing. I
have always maintained that one of the principal
reasons for establishing a federation in Australia was
because the governments were always pulling in
different directions. Australia speaks with seven
voices instead of with one Voice. Now, the hon.
gentleman wishes that Australia should continue to
speak with seven voices instead of with one voice.
Mr, Gillies : Only on matters appertaining to
themselves !


Dr. COCKBURN : On matters appertaining to them-
selves they should not want to communicate with the
Imperial Government at all !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I maintain that minis-
ters in Australia are to be the Queen's ministers for
the commonwealth, and any communication affecting
any part of the commonwealth which has to be made
to or by the Queen, should be made with their know-
ledge. Without that we shall not have the voice of
one commonwealth in Australia. I maintain that this
argument is quite indisputable. The lion, member's
argument amounts to this : somebody will not like it;
some people object to it, and it is not absolutely
necessary. I admit that it is not absolutely necessary ;
but I say it is necessary if we are going to establish a
real commonwealth in Australia. I think the idea is
that there is to be but one government for Australia,
and that we shall have nothing more to do with the
Imperial Government except the link of the Crown.
We recognise the Crown, but do not desire to have the
governments of Australia all trying to attract the
attention of the Secretary of State in Downing-street.
Mr. GILLIES : We cannot prevent them from having
agents-general!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Certainly not; but
the agents-general will be limited to their functions as
commercial agents.
Mr. GILLIES Will they?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : They will no longer
be diplomatic agents. I maintain that Australia is
to have only one diplomatic existence, and, therefore,
only one diplomatic head, and one diplomatic mouth-
piece in any other part of the world. Those are my
reasons. I hope the matter will not be considered a
light one. I think it is very important indeed.
Sir JOHN DOWNER : I agree with the hon. and
learned member, Sir Samuel Griffith, in attaching
great importance to this matter, but I consider that it
is only important in the way in which the people in
the various colonies will look upon it; and, in my
opinion, they will look upon this as being another
instance in which they give up a great deal more than
the circumstances of the case require. I take it that
we came here under practically the same commission,
with instructions to confer together as to the surren-
dering of such powers as were necessary to create the
commonwealth, but with the strictest injunctions to
retain to each colony all the powers not absolutely
necessary for the commonwealth. We all agree that
in every matter which relates to the commonwealth
and the Crown, the governor-general shall be the only
medium of communication between the people and the
Crown; but as to matters which are in no way
committed to the commonwealth, which are to proceed
in precisely the same fashion as they did before, and
as to which the commonwealth is expressly excluded
from exercising any jurisdiction whatever, surely it is
thoroughly superfluous to put in a clause which gives
the appearance of limiting the authority that is
intended to remain unlimited, and to give the governor-
general an apparent authority, which many of the
colonies, and many of the people of the colonies, will
think a real authority, to interfere in matters which
exclusively concern the states themselves. There are
a few matters on which the colonies even now have to
communicate with the Imperial Government—a few
bills which they have to reserve ; but with bills which
relate to their own internal economy, what on earth
has the governor-general of the commonwealth to do ?
Why should not the same procedure which has been
adopted in the past prevail in the future? We want
now to use every means of encouraging the colonies to
enter into this federation; and, as has been well
stated by the hon. member, Mr. Gillies, heaven knows,
the difficulties in our way are quite enough, without
wanting to unnecessarily accumulate them. Many will
attach an importance to this provision which it really
does not possess, and will say that, while pretend-
ing to maintain the autonomy of the colonies in those
particulars in which we have not expressly surrendered
it, we are, in reality, making ourselves entirely subsi-
diary to it on other questions. What does it all come
to 1 It might come to a question of creating great
disputes between the commonwealth and some state.
An amendment of the state constitution might not,
perhaps, commend itself to the judgment of the
executive of the commonwealth for the time-being.
Mi'. Baker ; That has nothing to do with it; that
is not the question !
Sir JOHN DOWNER : The bill would have to be
reserved for her Majesty’s assent; it would have to go
through the executive of the commonwealth.
Mr. Baker : Through the governor; not through
the executive !
Sir JOHN DOWNER: Through the executive in
substance.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Why not ?
Sir JOHN DOWNER : I shall say why not, if the
hon. member will wait a little. It will have to go
through the executive of the federation, who would
make, no doubt, such minutes and recommendations
on the matter, with which they had nothing in the
world to do, as might happen to occur to them at the
moment. If it is asked, would you invite conflict by
allowing each state to legislate independently, without
the executive of the commonwealth having any oppor-
tunity of expressing their opinion as to whether or
not they are legislating on matters within their juris-
diction ?—I would say in answer to that question,
“ No ; I wish them to have every information as to
what is going on in every state.” There will be no
difficulty in every bill, before it becomes an act, being
sent to them for their consideration to make such
recommendations on their own account as they like.
But I say that, so far as each colony is concerned, it
appears to me an absolutely gratuitous act, having
most carefully endeavoured to preserve all their rights
in every instance in which it is not absolutely necessary
to surrender them, for the mere sake of what I consider
a figment, or, as it is put by the hon. member, Sir
Samuel Griffith, rather an unpleasant reality, as it
might prove in the case I have mentioned, to deprive
themselves of the constitutional rights which they as
colonists have at the present time, and to give up a
portion of their self-governing rights which will in no
way that I can see assist the commonwealth, but will
certainly, I think, degrade the colonies in their own
estimation.
Mr. BAKER: I do not think there is in this Con
vention a stronger advocate of state rights and state
interests than 1 am ; but, still I strongly support the
clause as it stands, for it seems to me that one of the
very fundamental ideas of a federation is that, so far
as all outside nations are concerned, the federation
shall be one nation ; that we shall be Australia to the
outside world, in which expression I include Great
Britain ; that we shall speak, if not with one voice,
at all events, through one channel of communication
to the Imperial Government; that, as it has been put,
we shall not have seven voices expressing seven dif-
ferent opinions, but that her Majesty’s government
in Great Britain shall communicate to her Majesty’s
Government in Australia through one channel of
communication only. My hon. colleague, Sir John
Downer, with whom I generally agree, but with whom
I strongly disagree in this matter, has put it that as
regards the communications which will be sent to the
home Government through the governor-general, the
executive of the commonwealth, can in effect exercise
some power. But it does not seem to me that the
clause provides for anything of the sort. It simply
says that the governor-general shall be the channel of
communication. It does not say, and it does not
appear to me to mean, that the executive of the com-
monwealth shall have the right to veto any bills passed


by the different states, or shall have the right to re-
commend her Majesty to disallow any such bills. It
does not appear to me to go to that extent at all.
Mr. KINGSTON : What is the good of it 1
Mr. BAKER : The good of it is this : That to the
outside world—to Great Britain—we shall be the
Commonwealth of Australia, and not seven separate
independent states, acting in seven different manners,
even so far as great Britain is concerned. It is a
matter, I think, of very great importance, and I quite
agree that the clause ought to be retained.
Sir HENRY PARKES : It really does one good
to hear so sound a sentiment from my hon. friend, Mr.
Baker, to which I entirely respond. I cannot under-
stand, for the very life of me, how we can aspire to be
one Australian people under the Crown and have several
channels of communication with the Crown. We must
either be a nation or we must be a chain of unfeder-
ated states. I have been surprised at the attitude
taken up by my hon. friend, Mr. Gillies, because I look
to him almost for guidance in this Convention, and I
have been surprised that he should take up a position
which appeal's to me to be so untenable. I am very
glad, and I think I may in some measure congratulate
myself that I have been capable of sufficient self-
restraint not to take a very prominent part in the
discussions of this Committee, because I have always
found that some member or other to some degree,
sometimes more and sometimes less, had fully expressed
my sentiments, and I was not desirous of delaying the
proceedings. But there has been one feeling through-
out our discussions, especially of late, which if regarded
seriously would be almost distressing, and that is the
feeling of delegates to resolutely look on particular
parts of Australia. If we are federating, trying to
unite the whole, we must keep our eyes broadly fixed
upon Australia as a whole, and we must, to a very
large extent, endeavour to lose sight of geographical
lines of separation and peculiarities in different states
of society. If we aim and aspire to be one Australian
people, we must try to look upon Australia as a whole,
and I think I can take to myself some credit for
having taken this view from the very first. No person
has heard me speaking of New South Wales, and I
must say the delegates from New South Wales have
been pretty free from this local feeling.
Sir THOMAS MCILWEAITII : Oh !
Sir HENRY PARKES : So much is that the case
that at times I have found myself with no support
whatever from my fellow-delegates, showing that we
have not acted together. In some of the most im-
portant steps taken by my fellow-delegates I have not
even been consulted, so that we have not banded
together as against the rest of Australia; nor am I
aware that the name of New South Wales has been
very often on our tongues. For myself, I say that
throughout the proceedings of this Convention I have
desired to keep my eyes steadily upon the Australian
people, and I feel as much interest in that portion of
the Australian people in Western Australia as I do in
that portion who are in New South Wales. lam just
as anxious for the security of their rights and for
their prosperity as I am in respect of those matters in
our own colony, and I cannot understand how we can
rise to the level of a federation unless, as the hon.
member, Mr. Baker, says, we insist upon being known
to the outside world by only one channel. If we have
a governor-general he will be the chief representative
of the Crown, and as such he ought to be the only
channel of communication with the Crown from this
continent of Australia. That reminds me of words I
have heard here on several occasions, that various
bodies were being stripped of their dignity. Re-
peatedly we have been told that the senate would be
stripped of its dignity if certain things were done. I
am at a loss to conceive how anything which comes
into existence by the drawing up of this constitution
can be stripped of any dignity. Whatever dignity,
or character, or standing it has it derives it from this
constitution, and unless something is afterwards done
in an aggressive manner, it can be stripped of nothing.
Wo strip a state government of no dignity, no
position, no character whatever when we say that
there shall be only one channel of communication
between the nation of Australia and the Sovereign
whom we acknowledge at the other end of the world.
Each state will be as free as it is now to make its
representations to the Crown, the only difference being
that the representation must be transmitted through
the greatest and the only proper channel between
this young nation and the Crown. I instanced, I
remember, when this matter was being considered by
the Constitutional Committee, the case of the navy.
If a state governor had any power in dealing with the
Crown, how would it be in any intercourse with the
officers in charge of any branch of the naval forces we
have in these seas for our defence ? Any one must
see that the utmost confusion must arise unless
dealings with the admiral of the station were conducted
solely through one channel —that of the governor-
general. If we keep the position defined by the bill
now before us, with one unit between us and the
Crown of England, we must not allow any other
person whatever, whether a governor of a separate
state, or be he who he may, to communicate with us
in affairs relating to the empire outside, except
through the governor-general of the colony. It does
not appear to me to admit of much argument to show
that that must be the case. As to jealousies that may
arise, I cannot see that any jealousies can arise, when
the thing appears to be so reasonable under the new
order of things we shall bring into existance under a
federation. 1 trust the clause will be passed as it
now stands. It was considered very minutely by the
committee empowered to consider it, and it has so
much to recommend it, and there is so little to recom-
mend a number of channels of communication between
the commonwealth and the outside world, that I can-
not believe but that the committee will pass it as it
stands in the bill.
Mr. WRIXON : I should feel greatly impressed by
the arguments urged by the hon. member, Sir Henry
Parkes, if it were proposed to constitute a unified
government in this country. I should then see the
force of my hon. friend’s arguments. I think there
might be great virtue in that unified government
whenever we are ready for it \ but it is not proposed
to have a unified government now. It is expressly
provided that we take certain rights to the federal
government, and that everything not so taken is left
to the state; and I am afraid that by this provision
requiring them to communicate in all matters through
the governor-general, while you add nothing to the
real union of the different provinces, you will excite a
well-founded distrust and jealousy in them as to what
their real position is to be, and as to how much you
are going to take from and leave with them. After
all, it is a mere matter of etiquette—that is, as to
what mouthpiece the different communications shall
pass through.
Hon. Members ; No !
Mr. WRIXON: Well, it is a matter of etiquette
in relation to graver matters, and while you gain
nothing with regard to the real unity of the provinces,
yOu impair their sense of independence, and are apt
to inspire them with feelings of jealousy. If it were
proposed in this clause to limit this means of com-
munication to matters such as the hon. member, Sir
Henry Parkes, has alluded to, namely, the imperial
navy to matters common to the whole of Australia—•
I could then understand it; hut that is not what is
proposed here. It is proposed that no one of these
provinces shall have the least communication in regard
to the most local matter with the Sovereign, unless
through the governor-general. Now that, I take it,
is a position inconsistent with the station which we


mean to assign to these provinces in the new dominion.
They are not small provinces, they are great dominion
states, they will have large populations, and I can see
nothing inconsistent with their position in this con-
federacy in their having in their own governor a
means of communication with the Sovereign direct.
I can conceive of no more confusion in that arrange-
ment with regard to the dominion of Australia than
now exists with regard to India, where you have a
governor-general and governors of the different depen-
dencies. lam afraid that, while we gain nothing in
reality by this clause, we give cause for jealousy to
the different provinces, making it more difficult for
them to communicate their views to their Sovereign.
Mr. DEAKIN : The illustration my hon. colleague,
Mr. Wrixon, has just given is, I fancy, a little unfor-
tunate. There are lieutenant-governors in India;
but no lieutenant-governor communicates with the
India office except through the governor-general, and
that is the course of procedure sought to be established
by this clause. My hon. colleague regards this matter
in the light of etiquette, and considers that it is of
comparatively small value, except in so far as it is
likely to arouse feelings of jealousy on the part of the
colonies, which, he considers, are being deprived of
nothing, but which, in their own opinion, are being
deprived of an important mode of procedure. If that
is the hon. member's only objection, I think it applies
just as forcibly against his own contention as
against the clause. If the several colonies are really
losing nothing, there is on the other side a great
gain. The hon. member said he would support
the clause if we were establishing a perfectly unified
government. Those who have opposed every federal
proposal contained in this bill have said they would
accept it if we were to have a unified government.
But, sir, we are to have a unified government for the
particular purpose with which this clause deals. Read
the list of powers which are to be intrusted to the
federal parliament, and there remains one broad
general impression on the mind, which is, that in all
foreign affairs—if we may use the term—that in all
national affairs, the parliament of the commonwealth
is to represent the whole people. What are the com-
munications which will proceed from the various colo-
nies to Downing-street 1 Ninety-nine per cent, of
them must inevitably be of a more or less national
character. If the hon. member implies that the clause
is so wide that it will embrace in the net, not only
large questions of policy, which he admits should pro-
ceed through the governor-general, but also the minor
questions, which, in the language of the hon. member,
Sir John Downer, are of exclusively local concern,
what injury will be done to matters of exclusively
local concern if they are sent through one channel,
instead of many? As the hon. member, Mr. Baker,
has said, it is not a loss of power on the part of each
state. No colony will be gagged or compelled to make
representations which it does not wish to make ; nor
will any of their representations be prevented from
reaching the Secretary of State for the Colonies.
Mr. GILLIES : There will be loss of prestige !
Mr. DEAKIN : They may lose some prestige, but
then we come back to the old question: Is not that
loss balanced by a far greater gain on the other side 1
Our losses of the past have not been simply losses of
prestige, but very real and practical losses to the colo-
nies of Australia, because they have spoken through
many channels instead of one 1 Should we have lost
New Guinea if we had spoken with one voice instead
of witli seven 1 Should we have had such an unsatis-
factory state of things as exists at present in the New
Hebrides if Australia spoke with one voice? No.
Imperial Ministers have invariably said that what
they waited for, and desired to listen to, was the voice
of Australia, and that if they failed to act in a particular
emergency, it was because of the confusion of voices
which they heard from these colonies. It cannot be
claimed that the confusion of voices will be prevented
even by this clause. Any colony which desires to make
representations can do so in future just as much as in
the past; but passing through one channel, and passing
under the criticism of the chief imperial officer repre-
senting the Crown in Australia, they will have given
to them not only the unity that comes from passing
through one channel, but they will be open to com-
ment by that officer and his advisers, so that the
Imperial Government, when it receives those repre-
sentations from any particular state, will at the same
time be made aware of the manner in which any pro-
posal is regarded by the executive officers of the com-
monwealth. If that is not to be the case, what will
be the commonwealth ? It will not be even a bundle
of sticks; it will not even be tied together; on the
contrary, each state will stand apart, making its own
representations, even on matters of national concern.
Mr. GILLIES : No ; only on its own affairs !
Mr. DEAKIN : I understood that the hon. member,
Mr. Gillies, was opposed to the whole clause, and that
he did not suggest any amendment.
Mr. GILLIES : I oppose the whole clause, because it
is not necessary !
Mr. DEAKIN : Unless this clause appears in the
bill there is nothing to prevent each state from making
representations on any matter without in the least
referring to the general government. There is nothing
to prevent each state making privately and secretly
representations against the policy pursued by the
governor-general and his ministers, or against the
legislation which they are proposing. If the states
will lose something in the way of prestige or etiquette,
is that much to lose when we are on the other side
gaining the great advantage of having all the affairs of
Australia with the mother country dealt with on settled
principles and definite lines ? So long as each colony
is allowed to make its own terms with the Colonial
Office, and so long as each question is dealt with
separately, we have no more security than the good
judgment of English officials that the representations
of one colony will receive the same attention and con-
sideration as are given to the representations of another
colony. If, however, representations pass through
one channel, they will be bound to receive attention
and consideration, and to be dealt with on the same
principles. The very question which the hon. mem-
ber, Sir John Downer,.referred to, that is, the amend-
ment of the constitution of a particular state, is one
on which the governor of the commonwealth is entitled
to be heard, and it is very much better that it should
be heard through a definite and recognised channel
rather than that we should have a state government
making representations independently, and the cen-
tral government making representations independently
to Downing-street, while the Downing-street office
would have to return the representations of the
federal government to the state government, and
the representations of the state government to the
federal government. That would indeed be a very
inconvenient method of carrying on communications
if we ever have the unfortunate spectacle of a state
government being pitted against the common-
wealth government. The states will lose nothing,
comparatively speaking, by this proposal. It does not
deprive them of a power, it only fixes a channel of
communication. State communications would reach
the colonial office just as expeditiously through that
channel as if they were sent independently, and they
would be dealt with quite as expeditiously, while on
the other hand there would be enormous advantages.
The secondary question introduced in connection with
this clause is really bound up with the same principle.
There would be but one governor-general, but one
means of communication with the imperial authorities,
and that is through the governor-general. It will
follow of necessity that there will be but one repre-
sentative for diplomatic matters in Great Britain, one


agent-general, and that will he the representative of
the commonwealth. The several states would always
remain independent with regard to one another, but
with regard to the outside world they ought to appear
undivided. On the other hand, allow the governors
introduced by the Imperial Government into different
parts of this continent to make representations to the
home Government. They will receive different in-
structions, and they will make different representations
as to the opinions of the people with respect to any
question which may arise. Those representations
may be made in a conffdential manner without any
reference whatever to the central authority. In what
position should we then place the central executive ?
Not in the position of men charged with the respon-
sibility of the affairs of Australia, and charged with
the surveillance of all the affairs of Australia, supreme
with regard to all matters outside its borders and
with regard to all national matters. They would be
unacquainted with negotiations proceeding between the
several members of this confederacy and the Imperial
Government. They would be absolutely unacquainted
with them, and the matters might never be referred,
to them. Is that a desirable state of affairs? Upon
this clause hangs the essential principle governing the
relations of Australia to the mother country in future.
If this clause is defeated the proposed governor-general
will cease to be a governor-general. He will become
one governor among many, and he will lose the dignified
position in which this constitution proposes to place
him. You will not only deprive the governor-general
of his influence, but you will deprive the commonwealth
of its influence. You will deprive the commonwealth
of that single voice which would carry weight by its
diplomatic representation in the mother country. Do
this, and you will strike one of the severest blows at
Australia as a commonwealth and in its relations with
the mother country.
Mr. FITZGERALD : It appears to me that there
is only one recommendation in favour of the proposal
of my hon. friend, Mr. Gillies, and that is, that it will
flatter the self-esteem of the colonies by allowing them
to have direct communication with the home Govern-
ment, and to that extent it may facilitate the obtaining
of their sanction to the proposed federation. Though
I admit that it would have that effect, the arguments
on the other side are so overwhelming that I can
hardly imagine that the Convention can be influenced
by that consideration, which is utterly dwarfed by the
enormity of the case which has been presented on the
other side. I will make one remark in reply to my
lion, friend, Mr. Deakin, who referred to the lieu-
tenant-governors in India. I believe it is quite true,
unless a change has been made recently, that the
governors of the provinces of Madras, Bengal, and
Bombay communicate with the authorities in London
direct.
An Hox. Member : That is not a federation !
Mr. FITZGERALD : I know that it is not, but
India was referred to. The governors of the presiden-
cies of Madras and Bombay in all matters connected
with their own presidencies communicate directly with
the office in London. But that has nothing to do with
the case. I am sorry that my friend, Mr. Gillies,
should take such a provincial view of this question.
If we are to federate, I believe that these colonies
must speak with one voice, and let us hope that the
power that union will give us will make it a voice that
will be respected throughout the world.
Mr. CUTHBERT : I am sorry that I cannot agree
with the last speaker. I certainly attach a great deal
of importance to this clause, and I think it is one well
worthy to be debated a little longer. I did not under-
stand when certain resolutions were proposed by the
hon. member, Sir Henry Parkes, that it was intended
to concede to the federal parliament any powers beyond
those enumerated in the constitution. And if this
question had been presented to us at the commence-
ment, as to whether the position of the respective
governors throughout the different colonies was to be
lowered in public estimation, I think a great number
of delegates would have said that this was a power
that it was not intended to hand over to the federal
parliament. I agree with those hon. members who say
that the federal parliament ought to speak with one
voice as far as all federal matters are concerned. But
when it comes to dealing with purely local matters it
is a different thing. If the parliament of Queensland
or Yictoria determined to pass a certain law of a
purely local character, and they asked the assent of
the governor to that law, and it became necessary for
the governor of that colony to communicate with the
home authorities, why should the governor-general be
brought into the matter at all, and why should the
position of the governor of the colony be lowered ? I
say that if there are not words of restriction inserted
in this clause you might as well sweep away the
governors throughout the colonies, as they will be
reduced to such a very low position that I question
whether you will get men of high attainments to come
out and take those positions. It is a matter that
deserves a great deal of consideration.
Mr. FITZGERALD : How will the governor of the
colony know whether a bill is inconsistent with the
laws of the federal parliament ?
Mr. CUTHBERT : He has only to look at the
constitution. He will know by the advice of his
attorney-general whether the law is inconsistent with
any powers intrusted to the federal parliament. In
addition to that we have the safeguard of the judiciary,
the judges who are to be appointed for the special
purpose of ascertaining whether the state legislation
goes beyond the federal legislation. For these reasons
I strenuously oppose the clause as it stands. If the
bill goes to Yictoria in thi3 particular form, there will
be the strongest objection to it.
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS : I cannot understand the
position taken up here to-night, that the governor of
a colony is to be a mere superintendent of that colony.
I consider that the governor of the colony will still
maintain his position, and only those matters in which
the federal parliament is concerned should be beyond
his jurisdiction. It seems as if the object were ; —and
if it were, I would go with it at once—to cut the
painter. We all profess that we do not wish to do
anything of the sort, yet we are gravitating to it as fast
as we can. We say we are to be a nation —one people
regulating the whole of our affairs ; and yet we are not
to be in that position. Hon. members have taken up
a most extraordinary attitude. They say that the
governor of a colony like Yictoria is to have no power
whatever of representing the feelings and views of his
government and people except through the governor-
general, who may have no interest whatever in that
colony. Supposing the seat of the federal government
were at Hobart, and the governor-general were there,
would the people of New South Wales submit to havo
all their communications sent through him, and thus
to become nonentities, as it were ? Certainly not.
They would claim the right, whatever the law was, of
being heard. No doubt in regard to large matters
affecting the whole commonwealth, the governor-
general is the person through whom communication
should pass. But the governor of the colony ought
not to be denuded of all power, and entirely cut off
from communication with the mother country. I hope
that it will not be attempted to put the governors of
tho colonies in such a low position that they will not
be able to make any representations of their views
and opinions to the home authorities, except through
the governor-general. The states should retain as
much power as possible, and surrender as little as
possible to the federal parliament. But we are work-
ing the other way ; we are giving the whole of the
power to the federal parliament, and trying as fast as
we can to divest the states of any power whatever.


I trust that this meeting will not separate until it
has provided that the governor of a colony shall have
the power to make known the views of his people to
the home authorities without the intervention of the
governor-general. I believe the lion, member, Mr.
Fitzgerald, was correct in stating that the governor-
general in India exercises power in regard to matters
in which India as a whole is concerned, but that each
lieutenant-governor makes direct representations to
the home Government in inference to matters con-
nected with the presidency over which he is placed.
I consider that we are interfering with the state
governments, and I shall do all I can to prevent
those governments being deprived of that authority
which they ought to have through their governors.

Commonwealth of Australia Bill—Hour of Meeting—a
Plebiscite.
The President took tho chair at 11 a.m.
COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA BILL.
In Committee (consideration resumed from 7th
April):
CHAPTER T. —THE STATES.
Clause 5. All references or communications required by the
constitution of any state or otherwise to be made by the
governor of the state to the Queen shall be made through the
governor-general, as her Majesty’s representative in the
commonwealth, and the Queen’s pleasure shall be made known
through him.
Sir JOHN BRAY : This question was discussed
at some length yesterday afternoon, and is, no doubt,
exceedingly important, though I feel that, perhaps,
too much has been made of the idea that the colonies
would be deprived of a great deal of their liberty if
the clause were carried. But at the same time we
must all recognise the fact that we have started this
constitution with the idea that no state shall be
interfered with unless it is absolutely necessary, and,
as far as I am aware, we have certainly not advanced
any reasons to show that it is absolutely necessary
that all references or communications required to be
made by any state to the home Government should bo
made through the governor-general. I agree with the
proposition so ably and clearly put forth by the hon.the
President, that, so far as Australian matters are
concerned—that is, matters relating to tho common-
wealth as a whole—we must have only one voice, and
all communications must go through the governor-
general. But I would ask, is it necessary to go
further than that, and say that every act passed by
the local legislatures of the separate states shall be
transmitted to England through tho governor-general,
and the question of its allowance or disallowance be
made known through him P I say that it is not
necessary. It appears to me that although in practice
all communications relating to the commonwealth as
a whole, and many other communications, may go
through the governor-general, it is unwise to provide
in the Constitution Act, as a matter of law, that no
state shall be able to communicate with the Queen
except through the governor-general. Although such
a provision may not in itself deprive the states of
any great power, it may be implied by some that the
position of governor in each colony is unnecessarily
degraded, and it will be felt that not only the position
of the local governors, but even that of the local
governments, is unnecessarily deprived of some im-
portant privileges. If, however, the clause were
limited to communications relating to tho whole of
the commonwealth, no one could object to it.
Sir Henry Parkes : The commonwealth cannot
be separated from the states !
Sir JOHN BRAY: It is separated from them.
At the present time we allow each state to make its
own laws with regard to a great many subjects, with-
out any interference on the part of the commonwealth,
and why should we say to the states; “ Although you
possess the right to make certain laws without any
regard to the commonwealth, still you must not send
them home to the Queen for allowance or disallowance,
except through tho governor-general”? Although
I do not attach the importance to this matter which
some hon, members have attached to it, it seems to me
to unnecessarily restrict the power, the freedom, and
the authority of the governors and the governments
of the several states, and I trust that the hon. tho
President, and other hon. members who think with
him, while maintaining their own opinion as to the
desirability, and perhaps the absolute necessity, for
all matters relating to the commonwealth to go
through the governor-general, will not say that it
must be an absolute law under the constitution that
no governor of any state is to communicate, under
any circumstances whatever, directly with the Imperial
G-overnment. I trust that hon. members will seo
that this will settle itself as circumstances arise, and
we shall, perhaps, provoke opposition to tho bill if wo
insert in it a clause restricting the powers and
privileges of the several colonies and of their govern-
ments.
Mr. KINGSTON: I agree with the criticisms to
which tho hon. member, Mr. Gillies, has subjected
this clause. I consider that it contains the most
mischievous provisions, and that, if passed, it would
have the effect of throwing the most unnecessary
difficulties in the way of the acceptance of the con-
stitution by the people of tho various colonics.
Something has been said about the propriety of
all communications from the home Government
on matters which properly come within the sphere
of the government of the general commonwealth
passing through the governor-general and no one
objects to that. If the clause only provided for
that it would be utterly unobjectionable. But
what it does provide is that it is impossible for a
single act to be passed by a local legislature, even
with regard to a matter Avhich is purely local, with-
out it being forwarded to the homo authorities, so
that they may exercise their power of disallowance,
or consider whether they should or should not assent
to it, through the governor-general. What does this
amount to ? Is it a matter of form or is it not ?If
if is a matter of form it is only productive of delay
and inconvenience. Suppose in South Australia a
law of purely local concern, in no way interfering
Avith the powers of the commonwealth, or touching
any matter within tho jurisdiction of the common-
wealth, this clause requires it to be sent to Sydney
or to Melbourne for the consideration of the federal
government before it is forwarded home for consent
or consideration as to the exercise of the power of
disallowance with regard to it, If this is a matter of
form, it is objectionable on the score of inconvenience
and delay, and if it is not a matter of form, and the
federal government are to express an opinion upon
these measures, the provision is still worse. It
seems to me that when you provide in a constitution
that an act must be forwarded through the federal
government to tho home authorities, you give to tho
federal government the opportunity and tho right to
express their opinions on a matter of local legislation,
and Avith Avhich, so far as the other provisions of the
constitution are concerned, they ought to have nothing
to do,
Mr. Bird : But which they Ayould exercise !
Mr. KINGSTON: And which they Avould exer-
cise. If avc desire that the federal government shall
have control over local legislation, let us say so.
But it has been our object from first to last to


mark out two different spheres in one of which
the federal parliament shall be supreme, and in the
other of which the local legislatures shall he supreme.
Surely when we have done that we have done
sufficient; and does it not appear to hon. members
generally, that it is altogether indefensible to provide
for requiring—for that is what it amounts to —the
federal government to express an opinion upon a
simple question of local legislation before it is for-
warded for the approval of the home Government?
I am thoroughly at one with those who say that
in matters of Australian concern the Australian
people should speak with one united voice; but
whilst I assent to that proposition, I am altogether
against giving the Australian people, as a whole, the
right of unnecessarily interfering in a matter of
purely local legislation. It is impossible to consider
the clause without recognising that it must amount to
a grant to the federal government of the power of veto.
Colonel Smith : It is virtually a power of veto !
Mr. KINGSTON: Exactly. Any proposition to
do anything of that kind will be resented by the
people of the different states, and properly resented.
As the hon, member, Coloncd Smith, says, it ap-
proaches to the power of veto.
Sir Samuel Griffith; Nonsense!
Mr. KINGSTON: The hon. member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, dissents from that view. Surely, if the
federal government are to express an opinion upon
it at all, it will be entitled to some weight, and if
they can recommend, surely they can also disapprove,
and if a bill —a matter of purely local concern —is
forwarded to the home authorities, with an expres-
sion of disapproval by the federal government, that
appears to me to he a near approach to conferring on
the federal government the power of veto, without
stating it in express terms within the four corners of
the bill. I shall be glad indeed if it is proposed to
limit this provision to matters properly within the
scope and the jurisdiction of the commonwealth.
There can be no objection to that. If you wish to
give the power to the federal government of reviewing
the acts of a local legislature, say so ; hut do not let
us have a clause such as that which is now proposed,
which, it appears to me, will have the effect of doing
what I do not think there is anyone in this Com-
mittee would attempt to justify.
Mr. GORDON : I have been unable to follow the
arguments of hon. members who have advocated the
retention of this clause. The hon. member, Sir
Henry Parkes, who gave, perhaps, the most solid
reasons for its retention, argued that it was desirable
because it was necessary that Australia should speak
with one voice on matters affecting its concern.
Quite true, on matters affecting the concerns of Aus-
tralia; hut this clause touches purely local matters.
On the question of an alteration, say, of the e'ectoral
laws of New South Wales, and the number of the
members of its houses of parliament, it is absurd to
say that the united voice of Australia is required.
That is beside the question altogether. The true
sentiment which lies behind the retention of this
clause was shown by the I on. member, Mr. Dcakin,
when he gave the analogy of the lieutenant-governors
of India, some of whom are required to commu-
nicate to the Queen through the governor-general.
That is the sentiment lying behind the retention of
this clause —to make the governors of the colonies
lieutenant-governors, and that is just what the colo-
nies will not put up with. It may he a matter of
sentiment; but, after all, sentiments govern politics,
and politics arc largely sentiment. I. am certain
that 1 he colonies will not permit their governors to
he placed in the position of lieutenant-governors,
and to be subsidiary in local concerns to the gover-
nor-general. I should ho disposed to go further.
1 fail to see why the colonies should he required to
make any reference to the home Government at all
upon such purely local matters as a change of their
constitution, and I think an amendment upon that
point would save the necessity of further argument.
With that view, and without detaining the Convention
any longer, I may say that it is my intention to move
the following clause :
That notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in the constitution of any state, it shall not he hereafter
necessary to refer to the Queen any proposal to change such
constitution.
Dr. COCKBURN: I should like to justify the
vote that I shall have to give on this matter, because
it will be rather dissonant with the votes I have been
giving throughout the sittings of the Convention. I
shall vote for the clause as it stands, and also for the
the amendment intended to be proposed by the hon.
member, Mr. Gordon, because I take it to ho essential
to federation. It is the very definition of a federa-
tion that, as regards external affairs, the federation
shall be one state, and only have one moans of com-
munication, and in regard to internal affairs the
federation should be many states
Mr. Gordon : These are not internal affairs !
Dr. COCKBURN : These are internal affairs, and
it is one of the principles of federation that, in in-
ternal affairs, there should he complete autonomy.
In local affairs, why do you want to go outside the
state at all ? Dor the alteration of the constitution
of a state, why should you go outside the boundary
of that state ?
Mr. Kingston : That is another thing !
Dr. COCKBURN: It is all wrapped up in the
same thing. External communications should only
be made on questions concerning the commonwealth
generally, and the proper vehicle of communication
for them is the governor-general. In questions of
local affairs, such at the amendment of the constitu-
tion, to which the lion, member, Mr. Gordon, has
alluded, electoral laws, and so forth, or even the
abolition of the two chambers —as in the case of
Ontario, where they are starting with one chamber —
external authority has no concern whatever.
Mr. Gilliks : How would the bill be assented to ?
Dr. COCKBURN : It would be assented to, of
course.
Mr. Clark : By the governor!
Dr. COCKBURN : The practice in the United
States is that the states have sovereign power, and
have absolute control over their own constitutions.
The only authority to which they are subject is that
of the judiciary, which interferes, and besides that,
the states have reference to any of those authorities
in framing their constitution which properly remain
with the federal government. In Switzerland the
slates have complete power to change their constitu-
tion, only they send for ratification to the centxal
government. In Canada, which is parallel with our
case, the states have power to change their constitu-
tions. There is no reference to any central power.
It is essential in local matters that you should have
autonomy without reference to external authority.
In Canada, where, in addition to the tie of fed-
eration, there is also the bond under the Crown,
there is no reference whatever to Downing-atrect it
the state wishes to change its constitution. There the
federal authority have power of veto, but it is recog-
nised now in Canada that the power of veto is vexatious,
and it is falling into disuse, aucl I do not think the
power of veto will be exercised there much longer.
Colonel Smith ; You are giving the power of veto
under this clause!
Dr. COCKBURN: Just as it is necessary, in
every principle of federation, that there should only
ho one channel of communication to the outside
world, so it is also necessary, in regard to strictly
local matters, there should lie complete autonomy.
Therefore I shall vote in favour of the clause witli
the intent also of supporting the amendment of the
hon. member, Mr. Gordon.


Mr. Clajbk : Yote for both!
Dr. COCKBURN: Yes, vote for both —that is the
proper thing. They are both essential principles of
federation, and in my opinion they are the very
principles on which federation should be founded.
With regard to what has been said, that you may
have interference on the part of the executive if all
communications have to go through the governor-
general on their way to Downing-street, I will ask
whether you may not have that interference whether
those communications go through that channel or
not ? If a state government does anything that the
federal parliament does not like, will they be silent
as regards Downing-street, and who will have the
greatest voice—the governor of an individual state
or the authority speaking in the name of all Aus-
tralia ? If hon. members think that they are going
to get rid of friction in this way they are making a
great mistake. They will certainly have a slender
thread by which they can communicate with the
imperial authorities; but on the other hand the
federal authorities will have a much stronger tie, and
if there is any desire on the part of the central
parliament to tyrannise over the states, they will be
able to speak to the authorities in Downing-street in
a voice so much superior that in any case there will
be friction. What we had better do logically is to
pass this clause as it is, as being absolutely necessary
if we are to frame a solid federation —that is to say,
there should be only one voice as regards external
affairs —and proceed further to say, what is also
essential to federation, that, as regards local affairs,
there shall be complete autonomy.
Sir GEORGE GREY: I would suggest to the
Convention that the true mode of proceeding is to
insert a clause in the bill which shall enact that the
only laws which it shall be necessary to submit for
the Queen’s approval shall be those which the
general legislature makes. Hon. members may be
certain that we shall not give offence to the home
Government, There is a provision, in the case
of New Zealand, which exempts all laws from the
Queen’s assent except those passed by the General
Assembly. I think that if we did that we should
preserve the power of the federation in the highest
possible way. I feel certain that our great object is
to avoid all possible friction with the home Govern-
ment, and every act withdrawn from their super-
vision—the people here being enabled to pass it with-
out sending it home for approval —is really removing
one stumbling-block in the way of non-interference
with the affairs of this country. A clause to that
effect could be inserted in a very few words indeed ;
and the clause we are fighting about need not be con-
sidered at all.

continue as at the date of the establishment of the common-
wealth, until altered by or under the authority of the parlia-
ments thereof, in accordance with the provisions of their
respective constitutions.
Mr. GORDON : I rise to move:
That the following words be added to the clause ; —“ But it
shall not be necessary to reserve any proposed altera-
tion of the constitution of any state for the Queen’s
pleasure to be made known.”
This position has been so eloquently argued by the
hon. member, Sir George Grey, and other hon.
delegates, that Ido not intend to labour it now. I
simply propose the addition of these words.
Sir GEORGE GREY: I want to move a further
amendment, to the effect that it shall not be neces-
sary to transmit any law made by a state for the
Queen’s approval.
The Chairman : The hon. member can move that
after this question is decided; whichever way it is
decided the hon, member can propose that.

Question so resolved in the negative.
Sir GEORGE GREY: I rise to move :
That the clause be amended by the addition of the following
words :—“ But it shall not be necessary to reserve for
the Queen’s pleasure any law made by a state.”
I wish to point out that we are asking for nothing
which has not been done, and which has not been
assented to unanimously by both houses of the
Imperial Parliament. This provision is taken from
the New Zealand Constitution Act, in point of fact,
not in these very words or exactly this form, but hon.
gentlemen will see that is all that is necessary,
because we have not to reserve any power to the
general legislature of the commonwealth. They have
the power under previous clauses, so that the thing
which is brought about is this: there are fewer
subjects upon which differences can arise between
Great Britain and the commonwealth of Australia.
It will remove a great number of acts entirely out of
the way of disputes taking place upon them, and, as
I say, we are not asking for anything which has not
been accorded cheerfully and willingly on a former
occasion, and I feel sure that the greatest guarantee
we can have of peace among ourselves, and peace
with Great Britain, is by assuming powers which
parliament will undoubtedly confer upon us if we
apply for them in the proper form.

Question so resolved in the negative.
Clause, as read, agreed to.
Clause 7. In each state of the commonwealth there shall be
a governor.
Sir JOHN BEAT : It occurs to me that there is
no necessity whatever for this clause. We retain
the constitutions of the different colonies, and every
one of these constitutions says that the governor is
to exercise certain duties in regard to it. Why, then,
should we say in this act that every state shall have
a governor ? I think it is exceedingly inadvisable to
include the provision. We recognise that the con-
stitutions are to remain as they are unless the various
colonies themselves alter them. Why include in this
hill a provision which might possibly prevent the
colonies from altering their constitutions ? Every
constitution provides for a legislature and for a
governor. Why, then, should we say that each state
shall have a governor. If we say that there shall
be a governor, why should w r e not also say that
there should be a legislative council and a house of
assembly ? The Governor is, at the present time,
part of the several constitutions, and it is absolutely
necessary to carry out the provisions of any con-
stitution act in Australia that there should be a
governor.
Sir SAMUEL GEIFEITH: I do not remember
the history of this clause in the Constitutional Com-
mittee. I am trying to recollect it; but I cannot
remember that there was any particular discussion
about it.
Sir John Downer: There was!
Sir SAMUEL GEIFFITH; One reason for the
clause, however, occurs to me. It is desirable that
the states should know that the heads of the states
are to be called governors, and not lieutenant-
governors or administrators. There is a great deal
of difference between them. Here we are now accus-
tomed to the term “ goA r ernor,” but in olden days that
was not the case. In Tasmania the governor was for-
merly called lieutenant-governor, while the governor
of New South Wales was called the governor-
general of Australia, all the other governors being,
more or less, subordinate to him. My hon. friend,
Mr. Kingston, reminds me that the governor in South
Australia was formerly called lieutenant-governor.
There is a considerable difference between the two
things. It may be thought by some hon. members
merely a matter of words, perhaps; but I have heard
of a controversy going on of late when the question
arose as to whether an admiral would take prece-
dence of a lieutenant-governor when a lieutenant-
governor is administering the government of a colony.
That is a point that occurs to me now, and it may be
of importance. We indicate by this clause that there
are to be governors of states, and I think that that is
the proper term to indicate that the states are
sovereign.
Clause agreed to.
Clause 8. The parliament of a state may make such provi-
sions as it thinks fit as to the manner of appointment of the
governor of the state, and for the tenure of his office, and for
his removal from office.
Mr. GILLIES : In the Constitutional Committee
we had a lengthy discussion upon this question. As
a reason for the insertion of this clause, it was
contended that the people of any state or colony
should have an opportunity to determine whether
the governor should, or should not, be elected. It
was argued, on the other hand, that there could be
no objection to the insertion of this clause, because
it did not lay down the provision that there should be
an election, but merely gave power to the various
states to determine whether a governor should be
elected or not. This clause does a little more than
that. No doubt the concluding portion may be said
to be a corollary of the first portion :
The parliament of a state may make such provisions as it
thinks fit as to the manner of appointment of the governor
of the state, and for the tenure of his office, and for his
removal from office.
I say that if that be done in any colony it com-
pletely changes the relations hitherto existing between
the colonies and the Crown. The Crown at present
appoints the governor and determines his tenure of
office; it also determines, if necessary, his removal
from office. The Crown may remove a governor
from office whenever it thinks proper; but it is pro-
posed to limit the power and authority of the Crown to
do that. If the Crown once permitted any colony
to adopt a provision such as is contained in this clause,
that is, if any colony were to pass a law providing
that the governor should be elected by the people,
and the Imperial Parliament were to assent to
that law, and the Queen’s assent were also given,
what would happen? As was pointed out on several
occasions in the Constitutional Committee, the posi-
tion would be a most inadvisable one. The party
which for the moment was predominant in the pro-
vince would support the election of a governor who
belonged to their side. The governor would at once
become a strong partisan, or he would not be elected,
In addition to that the whole colony would be his
constituency, and he would require to canvass it from
one end to the other and solicit votes in the same
way as they would be solicited by any gentleman
seeking a seat in a legislative assembly. Now, for a
gentleman proposing to take up the independent
position of a governor, to see that fair play is given
to both parties in the state, that is an extraordinary
proceeding. A gentleman sitting below me contended
the other day that if a premier asked a governor to
dissolve parliament, the governor was bound to dis-
solve it at that minister’s request. That would mean
of course that if the governor were a friend of the
ministers—who had absolutely helped to put him
there—he would be under such obligations to them
that he would naturally take sides with his ministers,
and would give them as many dissolutions as he
decently could. That would be an unfortunate posi-
tion for the governor; nay, worse than that. As I
have already told the hon. member, Sir Henry Parkes,
without disrespect to him, if I were a citizen of a
community which proposed to elect its governor, I
would do all that I possibly could to prevent his
election as governor. That hon. gentleman occupies
a public position in this country which would make
him far too powerful for the place of governor.
Sir Henry Parkes : Wo have not reached that
stage yet!
Mr. GILLIES : It is a stage we are asked to
reach, and which I object to reach. The hon. member,
if he aspired to the position of governor, would go
through the length and breadth of the colony making
some of those grand toned orations which touch the
hearts of the people, and I have no doubt that ho
would be elected almost unanimously. After he
secured his seat in the saddle it would be a most
difficult thing to dislodge him.


Sir Samuel Griffith: That is the trouble in
Chili just now!
Mi*. GILLIES : I do not think that we should
create such troubles unnecessarily. If New South
Wales passed such a law we should have a gentleman
occupying the position of governor who is not sup-
posed to manage all the affairs of the state, because
that is supposed to be left to his ministers. His
ministers would give him advice, and he would calmly
tell his ministers that he would not take their advice,
and he would dismiss them from office. In fact he
might come to fighting parliament, and he might
appeal to the whole of the electors of the colony for
the purpose of maintaining himself in the position
he had assumed. On the other hand, if his minis-
ters were not sufficiently independent, and if they
were prepared to bow the knee and worship the idol
occupying the position of governor, what would they
be ? They would simply be puppets. My hon. col-
league said the other day that the governor-general
and all the governors were intended to be puppets
and nothing else. However, if anyone elected under
such circumstances possessed strong individuality
and great force of character, what would be the
result ? His ministers would be puppets, and instead
of working under constitutional government, we
should be destroying our constitution. Instead of
ministers being responsible to the state, they
would be responsible practically to the governor,
and the governor would bo the power in the state,
and not the ministers. Consequently we should
be subverting our constitution, and with what
object ? What are we to gain by creating an
autocrat, and by making the governor the pre-
sident of the state during his term of office ? If ho
is elected for four years, like the President of the
United States, he may be maintained in office for the
whole period in spite of his ministry. That would
not be a desirable state of things. The first position
of affairs would not be desirable. It is not desirable
that a gentleman who is to occupy that position
should be called upon to go through the length and
breadth of the colony to solicit the votes of the elec-
tors. That is not the proper course for an officer
who is intended to occupy a position of impartiality.
A man who would be required to go through that
ordeal is not the kind of governor who should be ap-
pointed in the interests of the people. What has
been the objection to the present state of things ?
The Crown appoints the governors, and how many cases
have occurred within our knowledge and experience
in which the governors have not taken up a proper
constitutional position ? Very few indeed. The great
body of them have acted strictly within their limits,
and have, as a rule, accepted the advice of ministers
when constitutionally given. If the governor de-
clined to accept their advice they had the power of
retiring from office, and the governor was obliged to
take practically from parliament the men to occupy
their position. I trust that the Committee will
strike out the clause. It was never asked for by any
of the colonies; it is not necessary to this bill; and
the principle it proposed to lay down is not con-
sistent with constitutional government as we know it.
Mr. PLAY FORI): I see nothing in this clause
which in any way conflicts with the principles of
responsible government. All that this clause says
is that the people of the different states shall
have the right of saying how their governors shall
bo appointed in future, and if the people of a state
choose to make their governor an autocrat, I do not
know that we need trouble our heads about that.
They have a perfect right to choose their gov-
ernor in future. There has been friction in the
past with regard to the mode in which governors are
nominated at home by the ministry, who know very
little about the requirements of the colonies, and we
know that the people appointed to these governor-
ships have been objected to by different colonies, so
that the home Government have been placed in a
very awkward and disagreeable position through
having, as in the case of Queensland very recently, to
withdraw the gentleman first appointed, and to sub-
stitute another in his place. If the people in the
colonies say that they desire to make an alteration in
the mode of appointing their governors, I do not see
why we should say that they will abuse it, and that
they will make such an alteration in the law that it
will work badly, and that all the evils which have
been conjured up by the hon. member, Mr. Gillies,
will result. It does not follow that if power were
given to the people to appoint their own governors
they would resolve that he should be appointed by
the ministry of the day. It does not follow either
that the governor would be appointed directly by the
people, as was suggested by the hon. member, Mr,
Gillies, Avhen he alluded to the probability of the hon.
member, Sir Henry Parkes, standing for election,
being returned, and afterwards becoming a perfect
tyrant or autocrat. They will take care to provide
what shall be the powers of the governor, and we
distinctly say in the clause that the people can pro-
vide for the removal of the governor from office in
certain cases. I have not the slightest doubt that
we can trust the people of the various states, if
they do make an alteration in the mode of appoint-
ing the governor, to make provision which would
jirevent any man from becoming an autocrat or tyrant.
All that wo propose to do is to give a power
which they have not at the present time in the states,
and which, I think, it is very desirable should bo
given. In South Australia we have had trouble in
connection with our governors. We have had to
protest against persons being appointed whom rumour
said were unsuitable. We have had to do more than
that, and we consider that we have a right to require
the home Government before anybody is recom-
mended to her majesty for appointment to give us a
quiet intimation about it, so that if we have a per-
sonal objection to him our voice may be heard,
Mr. Baker: To whom—the ministry or the people?
Mr. PLAYFORU : The ministry on behalf of the
people. I think it only right, because wo know, from
common rumour, that a most objectionable individual
was likely to be foisted upon South Australia, and
we had a right to object. I contend that by putting
this clause in the bill we shall be giving power to tho
people to say whether they wish the present arrange-
ment in regard to the appointment of governors (o
continue, or whether fresh arrangements shall bo
made, by which they shall have a voice in tho
appointment of governors if they wish it. I see no
harm in allowing them to have it under the conditions
here laid down.
Mr. MUNRO : I quite agree with my hon. friend,
Mr. Gillies, that we ought when the time comes to
oppose the election of our own governors. Ido not
believe in electing our own governors. But, at tho
same time, I do not see that this clause necessarily
compels the colonies to elect their governors. It
merely gives them the power to do as they think
proper. Ido not see any harm in tho clause in that
respect; but I say that the colonies have far too
little power at the present time. For instance, we,
in Victoria, went through an immense amount of
suffering through the fact that a governor was
removed because ho took the constitutional advice of
his government.
Mr. Gillies : No. lie claimed power to borrow
money on behalf of the Queen, and she told him that
he had no such power!
Mr. MUNRO: He took the advice of his ministers.
Mr. FitzGerald ; In a course which he knew to
be illegal. Ho became a party man !
Mr. MUNRO : Let the hon. member put any con-
struction he likes upon it, the fact remains that a
governor who acted on the advice of his ministers
was recalled.


Mr. Gillies : He was not recalled for that, but
for writing that letter without the advice of his
ministers, and against their advice.
Mr. MUNRO ; Ho was recalled because twenty-
two executive councillors, who had no right to do it,
petitioned against him. That is why he was recalled.
Those executive councillors were blue conservatives.
Mr. Donaldson : And his reply to that was that
he could not work with them.
Mr. MUNRO: Of course not, after they had done
such an improper act. Surely the people have a
right to support a governor when ho his acting on
the advice of his responsible ministers. The hon.
member says that the governor to whom I have
referred acted illegally, and that he wrote a certain
letter ; but he was recalled because the petition of
the twenty-two executive councillors went to the
British Government asking for his recall. He was
recalled against the will of the people, and the result
was a fearful amount of suffering in Victoria for
years afterwards.
Mr. Fitzgerald : And a lesson which they will
not forget.
Mr. MUNRO : I trust that this clause will be
passed : and that if such a lesson is ever taught them
again the people will act upon their rights, and insist
that a governor who takes a constitutional course
shall not be removed by the action of any tories.
Mr. Gillies : "Wash your dirty linen at home ; do
not bring our quarrels here !
Mr. MUNRO : "Who introduced the quarrel?
Mr. Gillies : I did not. I never said a word
about it!
Mr. MUNRO: I am referring to the historical
fact that the governor was recalled because he took
the advice of his ministers.
Mr. Gillies : That is not an historical fact!
Mr. FitzGerald : It is not a fact at all!
Mr. MUNRO: The hon. member says it is not,
and ho is introducing what he is calling dirty linen
himself.
Mr. Gillies : Who raised the question ?
Mr. MUNRO: The hon. member raised the
question by objecting to the clause and introducing
matters which had nothing to do with it. The whole
speech of the hon. member was in regard to some-
thing that might happen after the people had exercised
their right under the clause, not in regard to the
clause itself. His own statement was not with re-
gard to the effect of the clause, but as to the effect
of the law that might be made under it. I believe
that the clause is properly in the bill, and I think
that the people ought to have the power, if they are
tyrannised over by anyone outside, to take steps to
put themselves right.
Mr. McMILLAN: It seems to me that there is a
great deal in the contention of the hon. member, Mr.
Gillies, and a great deal of argument that has been
used up to the present time has been quite outside
the point to which ho refers. We have heard a
great deal about the maladministration of a certain
governor ; but what has that to do with the question ?
Suppose a bad appointment has been made on a
particular occasion, is the whole system to be knocked
out of existence because one foolish man has taken a
certain course ? This is one of the clauses in which
we are going far beyond what I conceive to be the
functions of the Convention. Let us examine the
question of the position of the governor at the pre-
sent time. All that any parliament up to the present
time has said is, that the responsible minister of the
day —that is, the prime minister or his cabinet —
should be consulted with regard to the appointment
of a governor. That is as far as ever wo have gone.
But to give to a colony the right to appoint its own
governor—not to appoint a man from home, not to
appoint a man ousidc the politics of the colony, and
outside a certain araont of interference which would
bn natural on his part, but to allow us to appoint a
man in any way from among ourselves, or even by
process of election, is simply against the whole
scheme of the constitution that we are setting up
We propose for the central government a constitu-
tion which will avoid all the trouble arising out of the
election of a president which occurs in the United
States of America. But having avoided that danger
in the central constitution, we are now trying to
make an opening, as an hon. member very ably put it,
for the president in our provincial parliaments to
be elected, and it seems to me that we are, in this
case, absolutely erecting a different class of consti-
tution for the provincial parliaments from the con-
stitution which we have decided upon for the central
government. And I certainly think that if this
clause cannot be amended in such away as to continue
the present system by which governors are appointed
from people outside our party politics, it will be far
better to omit the clause altogether.
Mr. CLARK: Two of the speeches to which w r e
have just listened -were totally irrelevant. They
might well have been delivered if the clause had said
that hereafter the governor of each colony shall be
elected by popular vote ; but this clause says nothing
of the kind. It simply says that each colony can do
what they like with regard to the appointment of
governor. The hon. member, Mr. Gillies, has posed
here as a great advocate of state rights, and has
deprecated warmly any interference of the central
government, or of this Convention, with the internal
affairs of the colonies, yet he would interfere most
deliberately by saying that the people of the colony
shall not have a voice in the way in which the
governor shall be appointed. He held up a terrific
picture of the consequences of popular election.
But if this clause is passed it does not follow that
any governor would be elected by popular vote.
Mr. Gillies : Then what is the use of it!
Mr. CLARK: It says that if they do want to have
the right to appoint the governor by popular vote
they shall have it. And are we here to say that
they shall not do what they like ? The election of
governors is not a thing unknown to the constitu-
tional relations of the mother country with the
colonies. A number of the original thirteen colonies
of America elected their governors before the time
of the revolution. Rhode Island and Connecticut
did it, and in Maryland the office was attached to
the families of the Calverts and the Penns. Those
colonies were not amongst the most disloyal. The
disloyalty and discontent in America arose in
colonies where the governors were appointed by the
Crown. I can quite conceive that the time may
come when the appointment in England of governors
for the colonies will be a source of irritation, and
more likely to cause discontent than the system of
appointing governors locally.
Mr. Kingston : It has caused trouble already!
Mr. CLARK: It is a possibility which the hon.
member, Mr. Gillies, might well contemplate in his
intense desire to keep up the connection with the
mother country, fearful as ho is of anything that
may happen to change the constitutional relations of
Great Britain with the colonies,
Mr. Gillies : There is an intense desire on the
part of some people to get rid of the connection !
Mr. CLARK ; There is nothing of the kind in the
present proposal. The simple object is that the
people of each colony shall be allowed to govern
themselves in whatever way they think fit. I have
more faith in the general character, in the con-
stitutional instincts and traditions, and in the wishes
of the people of these colonies than to think they
will adopt a mode of electing their governors with
such consequences as the hon. member has predicted.
Mr. Gillies : Why not leave them alone ?
Mr. CLARK :We are leaving them alone. That
is the very thing we wish to do, and not tie them
down to the present system for all time.


Mr. McMillan : We are not here to propose
amendments in the constitutions of the states !
Mr. CLARK: We are not proposing any such
amendment. We have already taken away from the
separate states so much of their power that their
relations with the mother country will inevitably be
changed hereafter. No man in his senses can say if
this constitution is adopted that the relations of the
separate colonies to the mother country and to the
Crown will be anything like what they have been in
the past. We have already altered the relations of
the colonies to the Crown by what we have done,
supposing this Constitution is adopted; and'it is
only a logical conclusion to our labours, only a ne-
cessary supplement to them, to add this clause, which
says that in the changed relations which we have
created, and which will necessarily arise under this
constitution, the states shall have power to adapt the
position of the executive to those changed relations.
Mr. BAKER : It appears to me that this clause,
and also clause 7, are not only unnecessary, but
altogether out of place. We came here to frame a
federal constitution, and not to alter the constitutions
of the states. I admit that we were obliged by force
of circumstances to refer to the constitutions of the
states in some particulars, and, perhaps, to alter them ;
but why should we make alterations further than is
absolutely necessary ? It seems to me altogether
outside our warrant to do so. It is altogether outside
the purpose for which we came here. The people of
the different colonies are quite capable of looking
after themselves, and if they want their constitutions
altered you may depend upon it they will have them
altered without any aid from us. I think it would
be far better to strike the clause out.
Mr ADYE DOUGLAS: I think it must be well
known to many hon. members of the Convention that
this is a fad of the hon. member, Mr. Clark.
Mr. Clark : Some people call them convictions;
other people call them fads ?
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS: We know very well the
opinions of the hon. gentleman on constitutional
subjects ; but the simple question before us is this :
Is it necessary to insert a clause like this in the bill,
when the people have the power under their existing
constitution to do this thing if they like ? As the
hon. member, Mr. Baker, has said, we started on the
principle that we would not interfere further than
was necessary with state rights. We are now asked
to interfere with these rights. It is like the Irish-
man going along with his coat trailing on the ground,
asking, “ Who will tread on my coat? ” Is it desir-
able to throw out such a challenge ? Or, it reminds
one of the story of the Irishman who, seeing a stone
lying by, said, “ There is a stone ; but don’t throw
it! ” This is the same thing. There are several
other clauses which have gained admission into the
bill, and which, like this one, are simply the fads of
the hon. member, Mr. Clark. I think the Conven-
tion should adhere to the intention with which it
started, to insert nothing in the bill interfering with
the rights of the states.
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH: There is no
doubt a great deal in the argument, that this does
not necessarily bring about the election of governors
in the different states. But I look upon it as a dis-
tinct hint to the states, that they may adopt the
elective system if they like. It is an invitation, in
fact, to the states to change the present mode of the
appointment of governors. If any misfortune could
happen to the colonies greater than another, it would
be that they should have the power to elect their
own governors. A greater blow could not be given
to responsible government than by the election of
governors by the peoples of the states. I thoroughly
go with the hon. member, Mr. Gillies, in his pro-
posal to strike out the clause, because if embodied in
the constitution it would serve as an invitation to
the states to act in a particular way, and I do not
want the states to act in that way. What the hon.
member, Mr. Gillies, has said about an elected
governor, who has lived his life amongst us, is per-
fectly true. You cannot have two powers in a state.
You cannot have a responsible ministry and a
governor keeping his thumb on that responsible
ministry and making them bis servants. The minis-
try of the day are the governors of the country. I
desire that matters should remain in that posi-
tion. No doubt under the present system there
are difficulties. The hon. member, Mr. Playford,
instanced a case that occurred in Queensland.
I remember that case very well. But did I draw
the conclusion from all that took place at that time
that it would be better to resort to the system
of elective governors, or the appointment of a man
whom we knew as a colonist ourselves ? No. No
man in the colony during the whole of that strife was
more opposed to the system of elective governors
than I was. All that took place on that occasion was
significant enough. But it has had the effect of
making the present mode of appointment possibly
better than any other. All we object to is this. We
saw from information obtained that the Government
were likely to commit a great mistake and select a
man as governor—very likely through ignorance, as
I believe it was —whose appointment would violate
the moral sense of the whole community, as it actually
did. Then it became the duty of the Premier to
telegraph to the home Government and say that if
they were advised by people in the best position to
advise them, they were making a mistake in sending
out a governor to the colony whom the people con-
sidered unfit for the position. The Imperial Govern-
ment could then take only one course, and that was
to follow the advice thus tendered, which they did,
and I believe they will always do so. I believe we
ought to know who is going to be appointed as
governor, so as to be able, if we wish, to make a pro-
test.
Mr. Playford : They will not give it!
Sir THOMAS McILWRAITH : I do not believe
we shall ever see a case in which they will refuse to
do so. They did it in our case. They drew back
as soon as they saw they had made a mistake ; and I
think if the home Government make a mistake in an
appointment, they should have an opportunity of
withdrawing. But do not let us do anything to raise
a power in the state against the responsible ministers.
We must keep the power of the latter intact; and
although the present proposal may do no harm, as
some suggest, I think it is an invitation to the people
to act in a wrong direction, and for that reason I
shall vote against the clause.
Mr. THYNNE: In listening to the arguments
against this clause I have been struck with the want
of trust displayed in the good sense of the people
and those who lead them. The inhabitants of the
colonies, guided as they have been by such leaders as
Mr. Gillies, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, and others, are
not likely to rush without reason into any sudden
change in the mode of appointing their governors.
I would venture to point out a very important con-
sideration in dealing with this clause. We have had
from the remarks of the hon. member, Sir Thomas
Mcllwraith, an illustration of the functions which
the ministry of the federation are likely to have to
perform in the future. I think they will be the
ministry whom in the future the Crown is most
likely to consult, and on whose advice the Crown is
most likely to act in the selection of the governors
of the different colonies, and it is necessary for the
protection of the states, if at any time it should
happen that the power of nominating the state
governors should be abused, that they should have
power to prevent the abuse from continuing. That
is my reason for believing that the clause is abso-
lutely necessary for the protection of the states,
and as we have gone, I am afraid, rather far in the


opposite direction hitherto, I trust that the Committee
will leave the slight protection afforded to them by
the clause in the bill.
Mr. MACDONALD-PATERSON: I should like
to say a few words before the question goes to a
division. I think it w as very unwise to insert this
clause in a draft bill for the constitution of a
commonwealth at all, and I think it was un-
wise on the part of hon. members to advocate the
election of the governors of the different states,
as some hon. gentlemen have done during the last few
weeks. There was no mandate given to the mem-
bers of the Convention to introduce the question here ;
and I believe that if it had been mooted at all as one
to which we were invited to give our attention, and to
be embodied in the clause such as this, many of the
delegates here now would not have come at all,
because the people of the states have never asked a
higher authority than this delegation to discuss and
decide the question. Why should we take upon our-
selves the duty of providing for the execution of the
functions embodied in the clause when the people of
the different colonies have never referred the question
to their own parliaments P To be consistent, we
should embody in the bill a provision giving the
people permission to elect the governor-general.
But the hon. member, Mr. Clark, asked, “ A\ r hy
should the people not have this power ?” My answer
to that is, thal no state in Australia has ever asked
for it I say emphatically that we are going altogether
outside our runctions in attempting to discuss or deal
with this question. There is another point to which
I wish to draw the attention of the hon. member, and
that is, are we not here to do everything we can to
introduce into this bill all matters that will forward
federation in the eyes of the people, and to exclude
every item that will promote dissention and perhaps
disaster ? But I hold that if we pass the clause we
shall set the people by the ears, because there are in
every colony doubtless people who advocate such a
clause as this ; but there are, on the other hand, those
who desire to leave things as they are, and we shall
endanger the acceptance of the bill, the fulfilment of
our aspirations for federation, and the consummation
of our hopes, if we do not exclude the clause, which
will result in the strongest dissension in the different
colonies. I sincerely trust that the division, if it
takes place, will emphatically indorse the observations
of the hon. member, Mr. Gillies, and others, and show
to Australia that we have no desire whatever to dis-
integrate their existing constitutions even in this re-
spect.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Various objections
have been made to this clause, some of which seem
to me, speaking with great respect to the hon. mem-
bers who expressed them, somewhat imaginary. The
hon. member who has just sat down seems desirous
to leave things as they are. So do I; but I do not
desire to compel things to be left as they are. I do
not wish that we should insist that there is so much
wisdom with us that we should compel everything to
remain as it is. I contend that we should give every
facility to others to alter their arrangements if they
think fit.
Mr. .1. Forrest : They can do that now !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Yes, but how ? With
the assent of the Parliament of Great Britain. But
have we not maintained that we shall not want the
help of the Parliament of Great Britain when this
constitution is agreed to ?
Mr. Gillies : We shall require the Parliament of
Great Britain to pass it!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Yes; and after that
we do not want them to interfere any more, and those
who think with me are following a consistent view
when we take up that position. That being so, what
are we to do with the different states ? We do not
want the parliament of the commonwealth to interfere
with the states’ constitutions, nor do we want the
Parliament of G-reat Britain to interfere with them.
What is the alternative ? They must either allow
their constitutions to remain stereotyped, or have the
power of altering them themselves, subject to the
Queen’s veto.
Mr. Deakin : Have they not that power now ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Not without the
assistance of the Parliament of Great Britain.
Mr. Deakin: What will be the effect of this
clause
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: To render it un-
necessary for them to go to the Parliament of Great
Britain to obtain an alteration of their constitutions.
Mr. Gillies : If they did it for one, they would
do it for all!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Exactly; but the
hon. member cannot get rid of the idea that we are
still to be in leading-strings and not go alone.
Mr. Gillies : That is what you are asking in the
bill!
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Once and for all.
There are only two ways of getting rid of the inter-
ference of the Parliament of Great Britain: either by
revolution, or by asking the British Parliament to
give us leave once and for all to manage for our-
selves.
Mr. Gillies : Revolution is very well introduced,
and in great taste !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: The hon. member
would retain for the Imperial Parliament the power
to deal with these questions. But the constitution
will be imperfect if we have to go to the Imperial
Parliament to obtain permission to do anything. On
the other hand, it is not proposed that the state
should ask the commonwealth for permission to act
as they choose in the matter, because that would
interfere with state rights. As to the election of
governors being inconsistent with responsible govern-
ment, does the hon. member know that responsible
government has been going on in Europe for years
with an elective president?
Mr. Gillies : A totally different state of things !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Not at all in prin-
ciple. The question is whether elective governors
are inconsistent with responsible government No
doubt there are great difficulties with every system
of government; but all the South American repub-
lics have responsible government with elective go-
vernors.
Mr. Gillies : Are they not nicely governed ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: That is another
example of the hon. member’s style of argument.
Because the people of the South American states
from their disposition and history do not govern
themselves very well, that is put down to the fact
that they have elective presidents and responsible
ministers; but it is absurd to put the two things
down as effect and cause, especially when we see the
same form of government in operation on the con-
tinent of Europe. And, as the hon. member, Mr.
Clark, pointed out, elective governors were found in
America, before the Declaration of Independence, to
be quite consistent with loyalty to the Crown. Hon.
members seem to think that the instances that have
come under their own notice are the only instances
in history; but history shows us that loyalty
does not depend upon the form of government.
Loyalty is a sentiment which will exist quite irre-
spective of the form of government, so long as there
is connection between us and the Crown. For these
reasons I say that the constitution would be incom-
plete without a provision of this kind, because it
would be necessary to have recourse to the Parlia-
ment of England to provide a change.
Mr. FITZGERALD: Notwithstanding what the
hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, has said, I consi-
der that it would be diametrically opposed to the
best interests of this country if we sanctioned or
invited, as we do by this clause, the parliaments of


the various states to elect their own governors, Ido
not think it necessary, to gentlemen of common sense,
to give at length the reasons why danger would fol-
low that method of appointment. We all know that
the case which has been referred to is an exceptional
one which ought to be a warning to us. The Ameri-
can republics and the American states are on a
different platform to that of these colonies. Wo
know that powerful families exercised commanding
influence in those states. We know that the repre-
sentatives of those families, as has been stated by
the hon. member, Mr. Clark, really keep the gover-
norships as heirlooms. There is really little danger
to popular rights so long as appointments of that
kind are made. Here, however, we absolutely give
an invitation to the various states to alter their
method of the appointment of governors, and to pro-
ceed at once to election. Election by what ? By
popular vote ! Election at certain recurring periods,
to throw the whole country into confusion, for the
appointment of whom ? Eor the appointment of a
governor-general, who ought to be above party politics,
whose best efforts ought to be devoted to reconciling
party divisions, who ought not to be, as in the case to
which the hon. member, Mr. Munro, referred, a man
who came down from his lofty position, and, en-
amoured of the applause of the people, became, dur-
ing a wave of cyclonic fury which swept over the
country at the time, instead of a governor, a partisan.
The home Government recognised in a just manner
the grave fault which that governor committed, and
removed him from his high position. The effects of
that man’s mistake have not yet been wiped away
from that colony. It is one of those unhappy re-
membrances which I am sorry have been referred to ;
but it points a moral in this case. It shows us that
if the states were to appoint a governor the same
feelings would probably actuate him. Probably he
would forget, in the old fire of party feeling, his
position of independence, his position of impar-
tiality, and take sides with one party or the other,
and continue the existing unhappiness instead of
doing his best to get rid of it. The invitation
contained in the clause appears to me to amount
almost to a direction. I hold that there is a ten-
dency in these colonies, to which we cannot
close our eyes, of advancing further and further in a
democratic direction ; and it is undoubted that some
of the most populous of the colonies would choose
this form of the election of their governors. I can
imagine nothing which would be more prejudicial to
the future interests of the country. I sincerely hope
the advice of the hon. member, Mr. Gillies, will be
taken, and that the clause will be expunged. It
seems to me to be the one blot upon the bill. As
the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, has stated, we
give no direction ; we merely leave the matter open.
Amongst men of common-sense we know what this
invitation amounts to, and the manner in which it
will be availed of. Let us go to the Imperial Par-
liament for any change in the method of the appoint-
ment of governors. If the will of the people pre-
ponderates in favour of a change, the Parliament of
England will not object. Let us not, however, ex-
cite party feeling; but let us continue in the path
which has brought us happiness, and which has not
interfered with the freedom of the people of the
colonies.
Mr. UIBBS: The clause, as it stands in the bill,
is a necessary sequence of the clauses which precede
it. The Convention has deliberately taken away the
rights of the states one by one. AVe have denuded
the individual colonies of their rights and liberties,
and have reduced various states, if the bill becomes
law, to the position of municipalities. Surely we
should have the right to elect our own mayors, be-
cause that is what the governors will be. They will
not, indeed, hold such a responsible position as does
the Mayor of Sydney at the present time. The hon.
member, Mr. Gillies, was very hard upon the hon.
member, Sir Henry Parkes, in the satirical speech
which he delivered.
Mr. Gillies : I paid him a great compliment!
Mr. DIBBS: I know the hon. gentleman paid
him a compliment; but it was a left-handed one.
The idea of trotting out the hon. member, Sir Henry
Parkes, as a candidate for the office of governor of a
state is a downright outrage on that gentleman’s
feelings. He has no idea, if I can judge his character
aright, of occupying such aposition as the governor of
a state, who, by the preceding clauses of the bill, is
reduced to a position of utter insignificance. I fancy,
if the hon. gentleman aspires to anything at all, he
aspires to the position of governor-general. I think
I am near the mark in gauging the feelings of the
President of the Convention when I say that nothing
short of the position of governor-general will suit his
high ambition. Of course we know very well that there
is another appointment which, in due time, he will go
for, and that is the position of president of the new
republic; but to taunt him in the meantime with
aspiring to the position of governor of a state, a
position which will be rendered exceedingly paltry
by the removal of the whole of the rights of the states,
is an insult for which I think the hon. member who
committed it ought to apologise. I trust the hon.
President will accept in sincerity my gauge of his
character, that he aspires to the highest position this
country will ever give, and that he will take office, in
due time, as governor-general, with the title of Baron
Hampton.
Captain 11USSELL: There is one point to which
I should like to draw attention. I thoroughly dis-
agree with those delegates who have spoken of the
clause as a logical sequence of the previous clauses of
the bill. It seems to me, as the hon. member, Sir
Samuel Griffith, who has an equally-balanced mind,
has said, that if it is desirable that the states should
elect their own governors, the governor-general of
Australia should also be elected. I venture to say
that this is an indication to the people of the
various colonies that the method of appointing
governors at present is unsatisfactory, because, if it
is satisfactory, what is the necessity of drawing the
attention of the people to that which they have
already in their power; if they choose to exercise it?
Sir Samuel Griffith : No, they have not!
Captain RUSSELL; I am one of those who see
no objection to referring important matters to the
Imperial Parliament : but 1 cannot help thinking
that it is undesirable that wo should be obliged to
refer many matters to the Imperial Parliament. It
seems to me that if we are to remain a part of the
great British Empire, it is undesirable that we
should by any means weaken that respect for the
Queen, which I believe must come about by our
seeking to elect her representative ; because, if wo
are to elect our own governors, the fountain of
honour and power will be removed from the Queen
and centred in the people of the various colonies;
and I, for one, do not believe that that is the wish
throughout the colonies. In the colony which I
represent, and probably throughout Australia, there
is a fervent belief in the principle of one man one
vote; but if we proceed in the direction of electing
the governors by the people, we shall, according to
my idea, make a distinctly retrograde step. y\.ny
advantages which may accrue —and I do not say they
will be all advantages —from the adoption of the
principle of one man one vote will bo distinctly
imperilled if, in addition to that principle, wo have
one dictator into the bargain. So sure as we have,
under the ordinary system of responsible govern-
ment, a governor elected by the whole of the people,
he will cease to be a governor in the sense in which
we now regard the word, and ho will become, in
a short time, an absolutely irresponsible dictator,
who will override the wishes of the people, and who


will, I believe, sooner or later, bring about a disturb-
ance of that true government of the people by the
people which is so desirable.

Question so resolved in the affirmative.
Clause 10. A member of the senate or house of representa-
tives shall not be capable of being chosen or of sitting as a
member of any house of the parliament of a state.
Mr. BIRD : I should like to raise the question
whether a member of either the senate or the house
of representatives ought to be disqualified from being
chosen as a member of the parliament of a state. It
is all very well to say that he shall not sit; but I do
not think that we ought to prevent him from being
chosen whilst holding a seat as a member of either
the senate or the house of representatives. Desiring
a seat in the local parliament he might think it de-
sirable to offer himself as a candidate, and I do not
think that we ought to prevent him from doing so.
It will be quite sufficient, I apprehend, if we provide
that he shall not at the same time sit as a member of
both houses. I therefore move :
That the clause be amended by omitting the words “ being
chosen or of.”
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH; This matter w r as dis-
cussed by the committee, who were of opinion that
members of the senate and the house of representa-
tives ought not to become candidates for seats in their
own local legislatures.
Mr. Playford : I think not !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : That is how I under-
stood the opinion of the committee. My own indi-
vidual opinion does not agree with this provision at
all ; but that is neither here nor there. I am going
to stand by the bill. It is provided by the next
clause that if a member of a state parliament is
elected to the parliament of the commonwealth with
his own consent his seat is to become vacant. The
theory is that he, being a member of the parliament
of the commonwealth, may not offer himself as a
candidate for a state parliament. You cannot pre-
vent a man from being nominated. Jf a man, with
his own consent, were put upas a candidate and were
elected, that would be inconsistent with his retaining
his seat in the state parliament. But it is proposed
by the amendment to allow a member of the senate,
nevertheless, to be chosen as a member of one of the
houses of parliament of the state. What will hap-
pen then ?
Mr, Bird : He resigns his seat in the senate, and
takes his seat in the state legislature !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: There is nothing to
say that he shall do so.
Sir John Bray : He will not be allowed to sit !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : He would not be
allowed to occupy both seats. If he were incapable
of sitting, there would be a petition against him, his
seat would he declared vacant, and the election would
simply be wasted. I am arguing, of course other
people’s views, for I do not believe in this restriction
at all.
Mr. PLAYFORD : So far as I recollect, the com-
mittee did not intend to prevent a man, simply
because bo was a member of either the senate or the
house of representatives, from standing for a con-
stituency of a state parliament or vice versa; but
that when he was elected he would have to resign
his position as a member of either the federal or the
local parliament. If hon. members read the clause
which has just been quoted by the hon. and learned
member, Sir Samuel Griffith, they will see that that
idea is certainly carried out in that clause, which says
that if a member of a house of the parliament of a
state is with his own consent chosen as a member of
the parliament of the commonwealth, he must resign
his former position. The clause was worded pur-
posely in that way, so that a man should not be com-
pelled to give up his position in the local legislature
until he was elected to the federal parliament; and
I understood that clause 10 was intended to carry
out the same idea—that is, that if a man who
happened to be a member of either the senate or the
house of representatives chose to stand for election
to the parliament of any state, he should not be com-
pelled to resign his position in the senate or the
house of representatives, as the case might be, until
he was elected to the state parliament; but that
when so elected he would bo compelled to resign his
other seat.
An Hon. Member : This clause compels him to
resign his seat in either the senate or the house of
representatives before being chosen as a member of
a state parliament!
Mr. PLAYFORD : Yes, But if the hon. gentle-
man will look at clause 11, he will see that the
member is not compelled to resign his seat until
chosen as a member of the federal parliament, and
clause 10 should bo worded similarly. As a member
of the committee, that is what I understood was the
wording of the clause. AVh did not intend him to
compel him to give up one position until he was
elected to the other, but that when elected to the
state parliament he should give up his position in
the senate or the house of representatives; or, if
elected to the federal parliament, he should give up
his position in the local parliament.
Mr. ADYE DOUGLAS : I think the hon. member,
Mr. Playford, is confounding the two clauses. One
clause relates simply to the senate and the house of
representatives, and the other to the local parliament
only. It was discussed a good deal in the committee,
who came to the conclusion that if a man is in the
senate, or the house of representatives, he must resign
his seat in that house before he can contest an elec-
tion for a seat in a state parliament, and if he is
chosen without his consent he will have to resign the
other seat. The two clauses are entirely separate and
distinct from each other ; one does not infringe in any
shape or form on the other.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: If it is proposed that
the election of a senator, or member of the house of
representatives, to a local parliament, shall turn him
out of the senate or the house of representatives, the
proper place to put that in is in the part dealing with
the parliament of the commonwealth —not here at all.
The intention of this provision is plain enough—that
a member of the parliament of the commonwealth
shall not become a candidate for a seat in a state
legislature.
Mr. Bird ; Why should he not ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I feel a difficulty in
arguing this question, because I do not believe in the
principle at all; but still the committee were almos't
unanimously of that opinion, and I want, therefore,
to make the bill consistent. If we are going to
make that a disqualification—and it is really a dis


qualification —of members of the senate or house of
representatives, this is not the place to do it. The
proper way would be to strike out this clause, and
put in a clause in that part of the bill corresponding
with clause 11. The words should be the same
in both cases, if that is what we mean, and the
proper language is that in clause 11 ; but then a
clause similar to that should be put in in Part I of the
bill, if that is what is intended. I can look upon it
impartially. I do not believe much in these restric-
tions ; but if they are to be in, I believe the way
we have it is the fairest—that a man who is chosen
from a state parliament to the federal parliament
loses his seat, and cannot get his seat back until ho
ceases to be a member of the federal legislature.
Mr. Platpord : We never intended that!
Sir SAMUEL GEIFFITH: That is what I
understood was the intention.
Mr. GILLIES: There are two questions involved,
one is the idea contained, in clause 10, which sets out
that a member of the senate shall not be allowed to
become a member of a state legislature so long as he
is a senator. The idea was that they should not go
down—that they might go up ; but if they did go up,
and were elected to the senate, they should cease to
be members of the state parliament.
Sir JOHN BEAY: It seems to me that it might
prevent a member of the senate, whose time is just
expiring, from offering himself as a candidate for
the house of representatives. Supposing there are
two elections coming on almost together, and ho is a
little doubtful as to whether he will be elected to
the senate again, and he decides to offer himself for
the local parliament, why should he not be allowed
to do so ? I think that if the hon. member, Sir
Samuel Griffith, will consent to make the clause read
in the same form as clause 11 it will meet all we
wish.
Sir Samuel Griffith : It should be in the other
part of the bill !
Sir JOHN BEAY; We cannot put it in there
very well.
Sir Samuel Griffith: Wo shall have to re-
commit the bill!
Hon. Members : No !
Sir Samuel Griffith : This is not the place for
it. This is dealing with the states !
Sir JOHN BEAY: If the hon. member, Mr.
Bird, will withdraw his amendment for a time I
shall propose to make the clause read in the same
form as the other.
Mr. FitzGerald: Postpone the clause 1
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I would point out
that this clause is dealing with states and state
legislatures, and that to put in a disqualification of
senators here would be absurd. We have dealt with
that in one part of the bill. Anyone looking to the
constitution to see the disqualification of senators
will look to that part of the constitution, and not
here.
Sir JOHN BRAY: Under the circumstances, I
think it would bo best to strike out the clause
altogether.
Mr. Clark : No : postpone it !
Sir JOHN BEAY: No; it would be better to
strike it out. Then, on the understanding that the
hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, will take an oppor-
tunity to recommit the bill, a new clause can be put
in. If we are going to strike it out afterwards, what
is the use of postponing it ? None of us agree to it
as it is, so we had better strike it out.
Mr. BAKE 11: I hope we shall have no recom-
mittal of the bill, because if we do we shall not get
home for another month.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I wish to know what
tbe Committee want ? I really do not know what
the opinion of the Committee is. One or two want
no disqualification, others want a member ofthe house
of representatives to be eligible for election, but that
i£ elected lie shall lose his seat, while another view is
that he shall not be eligible at all. Which is it to be?
Sir John' Brat : We shall soon test that!
Sir SAMUEL GEIFFITH: We had better test
the question on the words “ chosen or.”
Mr. PLAYFOED : Personally I do not believe in
any disqualifications at all. lam quite willing to
excise both clauses, and to let the people of the states
elect them if they think fit as members of one house
or the other.
Mr. Gillies : And bo members of both houses ?
Mr. PLAYFOED ; Yes, if the electors choose to
elect them. Failing that, this is Avhat I want to do.
I do not want to disqualify a man from standing
while he is a member. All I want to say is that now
you have been chosen you shall resign the former
position you held as a legislator for the whole
country. I want to limit the effect of it as much as
possible. Personally, I am quite willing to vote
against this clause, and the succeeding clause.
Sir JOHN BEAY : In order to test the feeling of
the Committee, as the hon. member, Sir Samuel
Griffith, suggests, I shall move, if the hon. member,
Mr. Bird, will withdraw his amendment, to insert the
word “If ” at the beginning, with a view to make
the clause read as follows :
If a member of the senate or house of representatives shall
be chosen as a member of the parliament of a state, his seat
in the senate or house of representatives shall become vacant.
Mr. BIED: lam quite willing to withdraw my
amendment, because I believe that in order lo attain
the object we have in view it will be better to have
clause 10 read in harmony with clause 11. If the
hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, is agreeable to put
it in in the proper place, I think it will make the
bill more harmonious, and secure the objects which I
think the majority of this Convention have in view.
Mr. Munro : No!
Mr. BIED : The hon, member says no.
Mr. Munro : I am going for the bill as it stands !
Sir John Brat : It is wrong !
Mr. BIllD: I should bo sorry to think that the
hon. member would prevent a man who may have
one or two years still to run as a member of the
senate from standing as a candidate for a seat in the
local legislature if he desired to change his position.
Mr. Munro : Let him resign if he wants to go
into the other!
Mr. BIED: lie may hold some position in the
government of the commonwealth or of a state, and
be unwilling to give up one until he secures the other.
Mr. Munro: Why should he? You give him
double pay!
Mr. BIED: Double pay! lie cannot hold the
two offices together. As the hon. member, Sir John
Bray, is asking for the very same thing as I am, and
as the method he has adopted will I am sure secure that
end better, I ask leave to withdraw my amendment.
Mr. GILLIES : May I be allowed to say that the
hon. gentleman does not lake another view of the
case which it appears to me is worthy of consider-
ation ? A gentleman who may be a member of the
senate may not desire or care to go in for a seat in
the lower branch of the legislature; but somebody
else may be standing who he is determined shall not
have a walk-over, and so he retains his seat as a
member of the senate, and contests the other, I do
not believe in that proceeding. If they really desire
to descend from the high position they occupy in the
senate, and think they can be of greater use in one
of the state legislatures, let them resign their seats.
Sir SAMUEL GEJFFITH: I think the bill as it
stands will give the greatest satisfaction; that is the
conclusion at which I have arrived.
The Chairman: Is there any objection to the
withdrawal of the amendment of the hon. member,
Mr. Bird ?
Mr. Gillies: I object!
Amendment negatived.

Question so resolved in the affirmative.
Clause 11. If a member of a house of the parliament of a
state is, with his own consent, chosen as a member of either
house of the parliament of the commonwealth, bis place in the
first-mentioned house of parliament shall become vacant.
Mr. KINGSTON: I must protest against the
passing of this clause. We have hitherto professed
an anxiety to avoid any unnecessary interference
with the constitutions of the states, and this clause
seems to me to err in the direction of interfering with
those constitutions without any cause whatever. The
clause provides that if a member of one of the local
houses of paidiament is chosen a member of either
house of parliament of the commonwealth, his seat
shall become vacant. As far as South Australia is
concerned, we have specified in our Constitution Act
various circumstances leading to the disqualification
of a member. These are common to similar pro-
visions in other constitution acts of the Australian
colonies. Wo declare that if a member of either
branch of the legislature shall become bankrupt or
insolvent, or shall become a public defaulter, bo
attained of treason, bo convicted of felony or any
other infamous crime, or become of unsound mind,
his seat in the legislature shall thereby become vacant.
It is proposed by this clause to declare, in addition
to these various disqualifications, that of the election
of a member to the parliament of the commonwealth.
Why should we do that? Where is the necessity
for any such interference ? If the states desire, let
them make the amendment themselves. We have
given them the fullest powers with reference to
alterations of their constitutions. Why should we
prevent them from exercising those powers in such a
way as to them shall seem fit ? For my own part,
I think it would be a great pity if we were to do any-
thing which might have the effect of preventing
members of the local legislature from sitting also in
the parliament of the commonwealth.
Mr. Baker : Or being elected governors besides!
Mr. KINGSTON : There are objections perhaps
to that course which do not apply to the matter now
under discussion. We surely do not wish to reflect
in any way upon the status hitherto occupied by
members of the local legislatures. I have heard on
various occasions in this Convention expressions
of an anxiety to keep the local legislatures and
the parliament of the commonwealth in touch. I
believe that was the chief reason which led to the
adoption of the plan whereby the senate is to bo
elected by the two houses of the local parliaments.
Surely if you are desirous of keeping the parliament
of the commonwealth and the parliaments of the
states in touch you are not adopting a provision
which will have that effect when you say that no
man shall sit in the two parliaments. If the local
legislatures arc satisfied that their members should
be elected to the parliament of the commonwealth,
why should they not ? Why not leave it to them to
determine the question from time to time as to them
may seem most desirable? As our Vice-President
has from time to time put it, why should we assume
to ourselves all the wisdom necessary for finally
deciding this question ? Why should we in a matter
that can fairly be left to the decision of the states,
say that we, in this Convention, have considered it
to such an extent that we shall not permit the states
to deal with the question ; but shall lay it down once
and for all that any member of a local parliament
who may be elected to the parliament of the common-
wealth shall thereby vacate his seat. Surely it is a
matter in which the local legislatures are chiefly
interested, and why should they not have the power
of dealing with it ? I hope the clause will be re-
jected. If the states parliament consider that elec-
tion to the commonwealth parliament shall be a dis-
qualification they can pass a law to that effect, as
they have already done in the case of certain other
events which are held to disqualify a man from sit-
ting in a local parliament. Why should we say,
without consulting the states, that the mere fact of
an additional honor being conferred on a member of
a local parliament, by his election to the parliament
of the commonwealth, shall disqualify him from sit-
ting in the state parliament, and that during the
whole term of his office the state shall be prevented
from availing itself of his valuable services in the
direction and management of their local affairs.
Clause agreed to.
Clause 14, A state shall not, without the consent of the
parliament of the commonwealth, impose any duty of tonnage,
or raise or maintain any military or naval force, or impose
any tax on any land or other property belonging to the
commonwealth.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: My attention has
been called by one of my colleagues to the fact that
there are no corresponding words in the bill pro-
hibiting the commonwealth from taxing state lauds.
In order to remove that objection, I move:
That the following words be added to the clause : —“nor
shall the commonwealth impose any tax on any land
or property belonging to a state.”
Mr. Gillies : Is it contemplated that in the case
of Crown land belonging to the states, that land may
]jg taxed P
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: It will prevent that
being done.
Amendment agreed to ; clause, as amended, agreed
to.
Clause 18. Full faith and credit shall be given in each state
to the laws, the public acts, and records, and the judicial
proceedings of every other state.
Amendments (by Sir Samuel Giueeitii) agreed
to:
That the words “ in each state ” be omitted with a view to
insert the words “throughout the commonwealth,”
and that the words ‘ ‘ every other state ” be omitted
with a view to insert the evords “ the states.”
Clause, as amended, agreed to.
CHAPTER VI.—NEW STATES.
Clause 1 (Admission of existing colonies to the common-
wealth).
Coloilel SMITH : Is it not desirable that the par-
liament of the commonwealth should have the power
to state the conditions upon which any colony that
does not join now may join hereafter ? I would sug-
gest that words be added at the end of the clause to
1 ho effect that if any colony does not think proper
to join the federation at first, it should only be per-
mitted to come in afterwards on such terms and
conditions as the parliament of the commonwealth
may determine. The condition of affairs may be
altogether altered Avhen other colonics may wish to
join, and if they stand out now to suit their con


venience, it is only fair tliat the federal parliament
should have power to impose conditions in future.
I would suggest for the consideration of the hon. and
learned member, Sir Samuel Griffith, whether we
should not add at the end of the clause the words
“ on such terms and conditions as parliament may
determine.”
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: The proper way
would bo to leave the clause out altogether; then
the next clause would govern the matter. Eut I
think we understand that we are dealing with all
the existing colonies of Australia. That all will accept
the constitution at once is not to be expected. I
recognise the force of what the hon, member says;
but if it is desired to impose a limit, we had better
say ten years, or something like that.
Mr. Gillies : And impose new conditions ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : And impose new con-
ditions. I think it would be a mistake.
Clause agreed to.
Clause 4 (Alteration of limits of states) verbally
amended and agreed to,
CHAPTER VIII.—AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION.
The provisions of this Constitution shall not be altered
except in the following manner :
Any law for the alteration thereof must be passed by
an absolute majority of the senate and house of represen-
-5 tatives and shall thereupon be submitted to conventions, to
be elected by the electors of the several states qualified to
vote for the election of members of the house of rep-
resentatives. The conventions shall be summoned, elected,
and held in such manner as the parliament of the com-
-10 monwealth prescribes by law, and shall, when elected,
proceed to vote upon the proposed amendment. And if
the proposed amendment is approved by conventions of
a majority of the states, it shall become law, subject
nevertheless to the Queen’s power of disallowance. But
15 an amendment by which the proportionate representation
of any state in either house of the parliament of the com-
monwealth is diminished shall not become law without the
consent of the convention of that state.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : Some doubt has been
expressed whether the words, “ proportionate repre-
sentation of any state in either house of the parlia-
ment of the commonwealth is disminished,” suffi-
ciently cover the case of the minimum number of mem-
bers for any state. I am not quite sure that they do.
We say that the minimum number for any state shall
be four. The point should not be left open for
argument. It may be advisable to put in the words,
“ or the minimum number of representavies of a state
in the house of representatives.” I suggest, however,
that the words, “ or minimum number of represen-
tatives of any states in the house of representatives,”
be inserted after the word “ commonwealth,” line IG.
Mr. MUNRO: I should like to call attention to the
manner in which the constitution is to bo amended.
First of all, there must be an absolute majority of
the two houses. That is right enough; but when
the matter is referred to the conventions it is a
majority of the states. That gives the states on two
occasions the power of vetoing the action of the
representatives of the people. The people are repre-
sented as a whole in the first chamber only. The
states in the senate can veto the action of the house
of representatives, and when you go into conventions
you treat them as states again. I do not think that
that is a proper principle. I think that in a matter
of that sort numbers ought to have some weight in
the federal convention. According to this clause it
will not be so. My attention has been called to the
matter by a communication from my learned colleague
in Melbourne, who points out that by this proposal
a minority will have the power of veto twice.
Mr. GILLIES: The question as discussed in the
Constitutional Committee was that an amendment of
the constitution was a very serious matter. Each
state comes into the constitution on a basis contained
in the constitution to be agreed to by the various
colonies, and subsequently passed by the Imperial
Parliament, Any alteration of that constitution
may be a very serious thing to one or more of the
states, and the states w r ould naturally contend that
as they had made a bargain, entered into an agree-
ment —a written agreement, without which they
would not have entered the federation at all —no
part of that agreement ought to be lightly set aside,
and that it ought to require the greatest considera-
tion, not only of the majority of the people as repre-
sented in the conventions, but a majority of the state
representatives as representatives, otherwise a state
might say, “You are proposing an amendment to
the constitution of such a serious and important
character affecting us, that we never would have
joined this federation if we had known that such a
course would have been taken.” I think that amend-
ing the constitution is a most serious matter, and that
no state ought to be compelled to submit to an amend-
ment of the constitution when it has not a right to
withdraw from that constitution, certainly not to
amendments which would really press improperly
upon its state rights. The committee felt every pre-
caution ought to be taken that before an amendment,
it may be of a fundamental character, affecting two
or three states, was permitted, the sanction should be
obtained of a majority of the states which had come
into the Convention under a certain written agree-
ment —that that agreement should not be overturned
without a majority of the states affected concurring
in the course adopted. That was the view which
obtained in the Constitutional Committee, and I
think it is not unfair.
Mr. MUNRO : Whilst it is not unfair to give the
states power of veto in this direction, under this
clause we are giving them the power twice.
Mr. Baker : Each state gets the same power
twice!
Mr. MUNRO: Yes; but the people as a whole
only get the power once. Suppose that an amend-
ment of the constitution is proposed in the house of
representatives, and by a bare majority, which happens
to be the number that is present at the time, a certain
amendment is carried.
An Hon. Member : It must be an absolute majority
of the House!
Mr. MUNRO: They may have an absolute
majority of the members present.
An Hon. Member : No; of the whole house !
Mr. MUNRO : What I want to point out is this :
Suppose that an amendment which seriously affects
the larger colonies is made inadvertently. They
have no power to protect themselves, because once
the amendment goes to the other chamber a ma jority
of the states decides the matter, and then when it
comes to be referred to the people it is referred to
conventions, in which they vote as states again, so
that the power of numbers does not tell; if a mistake
is made in the first instance, the people have no
power to remedy it.
Mr. Cuiiibert : Who appoints the conventions?
Mr. MUNRO : The conventions, it is true, are
appointed by the electors ; but they count as states
only.
Mr. Cuthbert : But they are chosen by the
people!
Mr, MUNRO : What I want to point out is this:
that in dealing finally with an amendment of the
constitution, Western Australia, with 45,000 people,
will have an equal voice with New South Wales,
with a population of 1,250,000, and it will have an
equal voice also in the senate.
Mr. Gillies: The hon. gentleman overlooks this
part of the clause :
The conventions shall be summoned, elected, and held in
such manner as the parliament of the commonwealth pre-
scribes by law, and shall, when elected, proceed to vote upon
the proposed amendment.
He will see that the whole matter is to be deter-
mined by the federal parliament.


Mr. MUNEO : But the clause provides further
on, that the conventions shall vote by states. It
does not matter how the conventions are appointed,
the final result is that the states vote as states on
any amendment of the constitution.
Mr. Gillies : Passed by a majority of the two
houses—the house of representatives and the senate,
in which is contained representatives of the states!
Mr. MUNEO : That is what I am pointing out.
Tliere is no referendum, such as exists in Switzer-
land—that is, a reference to the people—hut there is
to be a majority of the states in two instances. In
the first instance I admit the house of representa-
tives has power to deal with the matter; but that
chamber can only vote once on the question, whereas
the states vote twice.
Mr. Gillies : There must be a clear majority !
Mr. MUNEO : I admit that in the first instance
there must be a majority of the representatives of the
people; but the states have a clear majority in the
senate, and again they have a clear majority in the
decision of the matter by the conventions. So that
the states as states vote twice and the people only
once.
Mr. Gillies ; The hon. gentleman forgets that the
people represented in the commonwealth as electors
vote in the first instance in’the house of representa-
tives, and there must be a clear majority !
Mr. MUNEO : I quite admit that there must be a
clear majority in the house of representatives in the
first instance ; but surely the hon. gentleman must
see that while the clear majority of the people vote
only once, the clear majority of the states vote twice.
I really cannot understand why the hon. gentleman
cannot see that the referendum is not to the people
of the commonwealth as a whole, but to the states.
Mr. Gillies : In the first instance, through the
house of representatives, it is !
Mr. MUNEO : I admit that. But suppose a mis-
take is made by the house of representatives, then
the states vote once in the senate and again by con-
ventions.
Mr. Kingston: The hon. gentleman wants a
reference to the whole of the people of Australia in
one convention!
Mr. MUNEO : Yes.
Mr. Baker: “‘Come into my parlour,’ said the
spider to the fly ” !
Mr. MUNEO : Surely, in an amendment of the
constitution the same power ought to be given to the
people as a whole as is given to the states separately.
An Hon. Memree : The reference is only for
ratification!
Mr. MUNEO : I admit that; but I contend that
it should be a reference to the people, and not to the
states. If hon. members are willing that the clause
should go as it is I shall not interfere, I am only
calling attention to what I conceive to be the injustice
of the proposal to refer the question to the people
and not give them the power of deciding it.
Mr. DEAKIN : I do not think the Committee
attaches to the argument of my hon. friend the
weight to which it is entitled. The clause as it stands
enables the states to pass a verdict twice upon any
proposed reform of the constitution, and they have
therefore any advantage that may arise from a second
voice in addition to their first voice. That is to say,
the question being as to whether it is in the interests
of the states as states to pass a particular reform
they have first their vote in the state house, the
senate, and they have also their vote in the state
conventions.
Mr. Playfobd : Which are elected by the people !
Mr. HE AKIN: That does not affect the issue.
The conventions are elected by the people, but
according to this clause their votes only count by
states. What the Premier of ATctoria suggests is
this : that suppose seven colonies join the federation,
and a certain amendment of the constitution is
carried in the house of representatives against the
will of three of the most populous colonies. It is
true that cannot be done without the consent of the
majority of the representatives, including a large
number of representatives of those throe colonies ;
but my hon. friend supposes an instance in which a
reform is carried through the house of representatives
with the consent of a certain number of representa-
tives of the larger colonics, but against the will of
the people of the larger colonies. It then passes to
the senate, which accepts it with satisfaction. Then
it goes to the conventions, and the four smaller
states approve of the amendment, perhaps by very
small majorities, while the three larger states, by
overwhelming majorities, endeavour to reject it. My
hon. friend says that in such a case the numerical
majority is altogether ignored ; that not only might
the number of votes recorded against the amendment
be immensely greater in the larger states, but the
majorities by which it was negatived in those
states might be more than all the votes cast in
its favour in the other states, and yet the amend-
ment would be carried. Desiring as we do to
protect state rights in every possible way, it is
fairly open to argument as to whether this is not a
little too much safeguard. How to adjust the
balance it would be hard to say on the spur of the
moment. It might be suggested—though it is only
a suggestion on the spur of the moment—that if a
proposal for an amendment of the constitution
originated with the house of representatives, the
present plan that gives the states two opportunities
of rejecting it might be adopted ; but if, on the
other hand, a reform originated in the senate it would
only be fair to enact that, in addition to the safe-
guard of the house of representatives, the numerical
majority of votes recorded should decide the issue,
and not the number of states. Ido not think the
suggestion is worth very much, but the plan would be
more equitable than that which is at present proposed,
because as the clause stands a reform originating in
the senate in the interests of states-rights party —if
there ever is a states-rights party —antagonistic to
the larger colonies, if it could run the gauntlet of the
house of representatives, would be sure to be carried
by the conventions, while, on the other hand, a reform
which the house of representatives desired to see
passed, after it had run the gauntlet of both houses,
would be rejected by the conventions of the states.
The point is worth considering.
Mr. DONALDSON : I think the best remedy for
this would bo to make the majority two-thirds in the
first instance. That is the principle laid down in the
American Constitution. Not only must a reform of
the constitution be carried by a majority of two-
thirds of each house, but also by a majority of the
states.
Mr. Deaktn ; That would not help this point!
Mr. DONALDSON : The illustration given by the
hon. gentleman just now is most improbable, and it
is hardly worth our while, at this late hour, to discuss
the question at any great length.
Mr, Deakin : It is very improbable !
Mr. DONALDSON : Therefore I think it is hardly
worth our while to take up time with it in this way.
Eor my own part, I wish to make the amendment of the
constitution as difficult as possible. When the states
have cnce entered into federation in good faith, I
think their interests ought to be safeguarded, so that
no amendments may be made in the constitution in
the future which would prejudice them. At the same
time, I am prepared to take the bill as it is, believing
that any amendment in the future will be desirable,
and not detrimental to the interests of any state.
Mr. BLAYEOED : The clause does not carry out
what I think was agreed upon in the Constitutional
Committee, namely, that before any amendment of
the constitution could be made we should not only
have a majority of the states, but also a majority of


the people in its favour. I understood that that
principle was embodied in the clause ; but, on read-
ing the clause through I find that it is not contained,
in it. It appears to me worthy of consideration
whether we should not insist that before any amend-
ment of the constitution shall be made, there must
be, in addition to a majority of the states, a majority
of the people in its favour.
Mr. Fish : Does the hon. member mean the people
of each state ?
Mr, PLATFOED: No ; a majority of the whole
of the people. The people of the states are always
agreed to what the house of representatives may
determine on their behalf, and if you had no doubt
about the mind of the people, there would be no
necessity to refer the question from the house of
representatives to the people themselves. But in the
remission of the question to the people of the common-
wealth, you want to get the view of the people of all
the states, and not the views of their representatives
in the house of representatives.
Mr. Gullies ; And the hon. member would sacri-
fice the colony!
Mr. PLATFOED : I am not prepared to sacrifice
any colony, but I desire to look after the interests of
the people quite as much as to look after the inter-
ests of the states.
An Hon. Membeb : This is a double check;
Mr. PLATFOED: Tes, and I want to hold the
balance equal. I think my action here has shown
that I am not led away by any desire to unfairly pro-
tect the interests of the smaller as against the larger
states, I want also to protect the interests of the
larger as against the smaller states, and it appears to
me that the double check is necessary.
Mr. (Tillies ; The danger is all the other way !
Mr. PLATFOED: I do not think it is. The
Swiss Constitution, which has worked exceedingly
well, provides that any alteration in it shall be
effected only by an expression of the views of the
majority of the states, and also of a majority of the
people. But this clause certainly does not carry out
that idea. It leaves it entirely to the Convention
or the states to say whether the constitution shall or
shall not be altered. I think with the hon. member,
Mr. Munro, that the Swiss provision ought to be
embodied in the clause, so that in addition to a
majority of the states there might also be a majority
of the people.
Mr. DEAKIN: I trust the clause will notbe passed
without some little further consideration. The pro-
position of the hon. member is one which I should
have made myself, or, rather, which I was consider-
ing, but for the obvious objection to me that it ful-
fils too much the idea of the hon. member, Mr.
Donaldson, o£ making reform almost impossible. I
take it that one of the first principles of the constitu-
tion is that we present it to the several colonics, not
as a complete constitution, but as one which they
can make complete ; not as a constitution necessarily,
adapted to their needs and desires, but one which
they can themselves adapt to those needs and desires.
The amendment of the hon. member, Mr. Playford,
is fair, and the only possible objection that can bo
raised against it is that it makes the carrying of
amendments in the constitution extremely difficult.
But the question is whether that is not desirable in
order that the amendments that are carried may be
equitable. The proposal that was carried in the
Constitutional Committee, and commended to the
Convention, was, that first a majority of the states,
and then of the whole of the people, be required
before any amendment be carried. The matter ought
not to be lightly passed over, nor should there be an
acceptance or a rejection of the clause without
debate.
Mr. GILLIES : There is some misapprehension
about this matter. It is said that there shall be a
majority of the states, and then of the people; but
in the house of representatives there is a majority of
the people.
Mr. Muneo : No. Eepresentatives very often
vote against their promises. We want to refer the
question to the people!
Mr. GILLIES: The people elect their representa-
tives. We ought to remember that they are not
delegates. They are elected by the people to do the
people’s work in the way they think advantageous to
the commonwealth. And who are the others that
are to be elected to the convention ? Are they
not in the same position—elected by the people?
Does the hon. member desire to apply the same
observation to them as ho does to the members
of the house of representatives ? But are they
more the representatives of the people than the
members of the house of representatives ? Not
at all. They will represent the people in the same
way and to the same number, neither more nor less.
Mr. Muneo : No ; the hon. member does not un-
derstand the position at all!
Mr. GILLIES : We shall never understand the
hon. gentleman’s position. A man is elected to the
senate on one subject only, while a member of the
house of representatives is elected on several sub-
jects, though he represents the people just the same.
The second representation to the convention is no
different. The members all represent the people
who are on the electoral roll and qualified to vote for
the election of members to the house of represen-
tatives.
Mr. Muneo : The people vote as states !
Mr. GILLIES: In addition to this, the people
vote as states.
Mr. Muneo : They only vote as states !
Mr. GILLIES : There are not two elections so far
as the states are concerned ; there is only one elec-
tion, that is to the senate. The other is a distinct
election to the house of representatives, and to con-
ceive that the representatives of the two large states
are going to combine together for the purpose of
ruining one of the other states is ridiculous. They
will represent such a tremendous majority in the
the house of representatives that it is inconceivable
that they would adopt such a course.
Sir GEOEGE GEET : I think the hon. member,
Mr. Gillies, has entirely misunderstood the question.
Mr. Gillies : I have misunderstood all the hon.
member’s questions!
Sir GEOEGE GEET : And I have misunderstood
all those of the hon. gentleman —or rather, I believe
I have not misunderstood them, but have fathomed
them. I deny that those in the Chamber of Eoprc-
sentatives in New Zealand represent the people
there, and the hon. member knows in his own heart
that that is so in Victoria. He cannot deny it.
Mr. Gillies ; I do deny it!
Sir GEOEGE GEET; The hon. member would
deny anything if he denies that!
Mr. (Tillies : I return the hon. member’s compli-
ment !
Sir GEOEGE GEET : I assert that in point of
fact the system of plural voting prevailing—
Mr. Gillies : At it again!
Sir GEOEGE GEET; Tes; I am endeavouring
to destroy what I believe to be one of the greatest
abuses in existence. Every opportunity has been
taken to cover it from the Parliament of Great
Britain. The hon. gentleman stated here one day
that nothing could exceed the liberality of the con-
stitution of Victoria—that it was impossible to con-
ceive of anything more liberal. Well, I cau conceive
of something more liberal, and I contend that it is
most illiberal, and that the people are not repre-
sented in any way whatever. I stand up here and
say that to claim that in the young commonwealth of
Australia the persons in the chamber of representa-
tives will represent the people is an unfair way of


putting the statement before the public, because they
represent only capital in point of fact. It is well
known to all hon. gentlemen present that in some of
the states there is no fair representation at all. It
approaches it more nearly, perhaps, in Victoria, in
Van Diemen’s Land, in South Australia, and in New
Zealand, than it does in any other place; but, still,
in Victoria, there is no fair representation of the
people at the present day. Some persons can exer-
cise seven or eight votes at an election as against one
vote of another man. Can it be said that the people
are fairly represented under such circumstances ?
It is property that is represented; not people, not
individual living men, not individual interests of
families, of wives, and of children, but the bare soil
of the earth. That is what is represented—that is to
say, territory is represented ; the land is represented.
Mr. G-illies : That statement is not well founded.
Sir GEORGE GREY: Then there is no solid
foundation of anything in the world. I say that the
representation is a representation of the dry and
senseless soil; and that human beings, who have such
great interests at stake, are not represented at all.
The term “ chamber of representatives ” is used, but
they represent the soil of the earth, and do not repre-
sent real living human beings, upon a fair scale. That
is the point, and I contend that we ought not to be
led away by statements of that kind, but that we
ought to face the actual difficulties, tell the actual
truth to the people of the commonwealth of Aus-
tralia, and not lead them to believe they are fairly
represented, and that they have one of the most
liberal constitutions in the world. It is quite evident
that when the chamber of representatives is got
together upon the basis of property, or upon the
basis of small pieces- of land, of which one individual
holds a great many, and has a vote for each, that
what is actually represented is property.
Mr. Gillies : That is not so!
Sir GEORGE GREY: Well, one is confounded
absolutely. Here is a plain, certain fact in existence.
Does the hon. gentleman deny that what gives the
vote is property, and not human beings ? Can he
deny that P
Mr. Gillies : Certainly !
Sir GEORGE GREY : Well, I maintain directly
the opposite, and I will maintain it against the hon.
gentleman upon his own ground in Victoria. I will
maintain it against him at a public meeting, and I will
guarantee to a certainty that I will carry the whole
meeting with me to a man, and no one will have the
audacity to stand up and say that it is human beings
alone that are represented, and that the dry soil of
the earth is not the true thing which is represented.
I contend that we ought always to fairly put that
point before the people of the country, and especially
before the British Parliament. Let them know the
true state of the case here. Let the whole thing be
fairly put before them by the people of New Zealand,
if the representatives of the people of New Zealand
will not do it. The only reason why they will not do
it, if they do not do it, is because New Zealand is
not fairly represented. I contend, therefore, that
what we are now asking for is not to oppress the
states ; but to deliver the states from the dominancy
of capital—to let the people of the states walk forth
as free men—to let each man have the right to one
vote; and, being thus truly represented, let us do
that which a large number of us are anxiously trying
to do in this bill; but do not let us conceal from the
people what the actual facts are. I shall certainly
support the clause as it is. I do not think it is
perfect by any means; but I believe it is fairer to
the people of New Zealand than the contrary proposal
would be.
Sir SAMUEL GRIEEITH: I think there is a
great deal of force in the contention of the hon.
member, Mr. Munro. There is a possibility that an
amendment of the constitution might be carried
against the wish of a majority of the people of Aus-
tralia.
Mr. Platford : It was never intended, though !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : It was never intended.
How would this form of words meet the difficulty ?
And if the proposed amendment is approved by the con-
ventions of a majority of the states, and if the people of the
states whose conventions approve of the amendment are also
a majority of the people of the commonwealth, the proposed
amendment shall become law.
Mr. DEAKIN : One objection to that might be
that the hon, member has fixed a majority of the
people of the commonwealth. Is that necessary ?
The hon. member, I presume, means a majority of
those who vote. Is it necessary to require a majority
of the people of the commonwealth ? If the occasion
is considered to be one of sufficient importance to
send a majority of the commonwealth to the polls, it
would certainly be equally satisfactory and equally
in accordance with the rule of the majority if, instead
of the last words of the amendment, the hon. member
substituted “a majority of those who vote at the
polls.”
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: The hon. gentleman
will see that what he suggests is mixing up the idea
of a plebiscite with the idea of a representative body.
Nobody might oppose it, and in some of the states
all the members of the Convention might be elected
unanimously. How would you deal with the matter
then ?
Mr. Dearth : Does the hon. member mean that a
majority of the people of the commonwealth must
vote on one side or the other ?
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : As the clause stands,
it means the conventions of the majority of the states.
Say there are four states. If these four states com-
prise a majority of the people of the commonwealth
then the amendment becomes law ; but if these four
states are the four smaller states, and the conventions
of the larger states disapprove, then it would not
become law, and I do not think it ought.
Mr. Dearth : Does the hon. member think that
form of words is quite clear P
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : It counts simply the
number of people in the states ; that is the basis of
representation in this bill altogether. The words I
have suggested meet the objection, I think.
Mr. PLAYFORD : They meet the objection in a
clumsy manner ; because hon. members will see that
the convention, which may absolutely approve, so far
as an individual state is concerned, or disapprove of
the proposed alteration, as the case may be, may have
only a majority of one, and may comprise only an
exceedingly small majority of the people of that
state. I maintain that this clause is based on a
mistake altogether. It would have been a great
deal better to adopt the Swiss mode of referring al-
terations of the constitution to the people than to
adopt this mode of convention, because in this mode
of convention you can never ascertain correctly the
views of the people. You only ascertain the views
of the men who have been elected members of the
convention. The Swiss system is a far preferable
one. Under that system you must have a majority,
in the first instance, of the people of all the states
combined; and you must have a majority of the
electors in more than half the states with you at the
same time. Thus, on the one hand you have state
interests conserved, and on the other hand you have the
interests of the people as a whole conserved. If you
refer such matters as an alteration of the constitution
to a convention, you are met at once with this diffi-
culty ; that you cannot tell exactly how your people
vote ; because, in one state, the proposal may be
carried by a very small majority, which, with a large
minority added by another state, may altogether
upset your calculations. With regard to conven-
tions, you never can calculate as to the number of


the people; but only as to the majority of individual
states. That is all you can do. You, therefore, can-
not combine the two principles that are combined in
the Swiss mode of deciding these matters. The
whole clause, as I contended in committee, is founded
on a wrong principle. The principle of having con-
ventions to decide whether an alteration of the
constitution should, or should not, be adopted is not
nearly so good as the system which they have in
Switzerland, where the alteration must be submitted to
the vote of the people, and also to the vote of the
majority of the states, and there must be a majority
of the states as well as a majority of the people.
You cannot do that with a convention. We shall have
to do away with this clause so far asthe convention is
concerned, and by referendum remit the question to
the people, w'ho will say either “ yes ” or “ no ” to
the proposal, and w r ho will have to decide by a
majority of the states in the one case, and by a
majority of the people in the other.
Mr, Gillies : You will never carry a constitution
with that proposal in it!
Mr. PLAAEORD : With a referendum ?
Mr. Gillies : Not at all!
Mr. PLAYFORD : A great deal more easily than
you would carry this proposal under wdiich the
majority of the people cannot express their views, but
a majority of the states can. I wish w 7 e could arrive
at such a mode of deciding on any alteration of the
constitution that, on the one hand, the voice of the
states could be effectually heard, and on the other
the voice of the people. I do not want to propose
anything that would have the effect of letting the
voice of the states be paramount, and the voice of the
people practically now'here. That is, no doubt, the
position. You w T ant the tw r o principles combined, as
in Switzerland, or you will never have a satisfactory
reference.
Mr. Gillies : We will not have the Swiss system !
Mr. PLAYFORD : We shall have to have what
the people of the country agree to,
Mr. Gillies : They will not agree to that !
Mr. PLAYFORD; I think they will. I think
that the people, taking them as a whole, and I am
sure that the smaller states will say, “ It is only fair
that the voice of the whole people should be con-
sidered as well as the voice of the states. If we in
the states have-the powder to put a stop to a proposal
because the majority of the states are opposed to it,
so the states with the largest number of people
should have the power when the majority of the
people of the commonwealth are against it, and it
shall not become the law of the land.” No one in
his senses will argue that it is fair that the minority
of the commonwealth shall be able to make an alter-
ation of the constitution of the commonwealth. If
that is not fair, the people are quite willing to say,
“ If we cannot carry a majority, first of the people,
and secondly of the states, no alteration of the con-
stitution shall be made.” I say that this is fair on
the one hand to the states, and on the other hand to
the people. The states have no more right to say
that, simply because they have a majority, though not
of the people, they will override the people, than the
people, on the other hand, have a right to say,
“ Because we have a majority of the people we will
override the states.” Let us deal fairly in both cases.
That is all I want, 1 do not care how it is brought
about, so long as it is thoroughly understood that
the people, on the one hand, shall not override the
states, and that the states, on the other hand, shall
not be able to override the people.
Dr. COCKBURN : I cannot agree with everything
said by the hon. member who last spoke. 1 think
that majorities will always take care of themselves ;
but I do most heartily agree with wdiat he said with
regard to conventions, which I think are altogether
an error in theory, and useless in practice. They
were proposed in America as a barrier against the
popular will. Those who advocated and established
conventions meant them to be a direct check on the
popular will. On any question so vital as the
amendment of the constitution the people have a
right to be consulted directly, without any conven-
tions whatever. In conventions the issue is obscured
by personal considerations, and people pronounce a
decision quite different from what is required—that
is to say, wdiether they approve of the proposed altera-
tion of the constitution, apart from all side issues. I
suppose it is pretty well admitted —I should be sur-
prised if any objection were taken —that before this
constitution becomes a fact it will be referred to the
people themselves directly. I should like to know if
any hon. member of the Convention holds a different
opinion ?
Mr. Gillies : Certainly ; dozens do !
Sir Samuel Geiffith : I do, for one ; I think it is
absolutely impossible!
Dr. COCKBURN: I am surprised. This is such
a complete alteration of the conditions under which
people are now' living in the colonies that it is an
absolute revolution—the measure is thoroughly re-
volutionary. It is no reform; it is such an altera-
tion of the present constitution that it amounts prac-
tically to a revolution, and surely in a case of this
sort, w'here there is such a complete alteration of the
conditions under which the people are now governed,
they are entitled to speak directly, without any
convention whatever to express their will through
their own votes, and not to have to delelgate
their power of voting to any individuals whatever.
I maintain that wdiatever the opinion of some hon.
members may be now, they will find that when
they propose this constitution in their parliaments
and to their people, the people will insist on this
right. I am inclined to think that, just as they will
insist on this right in the establishment of the con-
stitution, so they will in regard to any alteration of
the constitution. "What possible objection can there
be to referring the issue directly to the people ? There
can be no objection unless w r e are afraid of the verdict
of the people.
Sir Samuel Geiffitii: Why should the people
not make laws direct ?
Mr. Donaldson : What is the use of parliament
at all P
Dr. COCKBURN: One thing is certain : in
America the conventions were established for the
one purpose which I have mentioned.
Sir Samuel Griffith ; I deny that; they w r ere
established for a directly opposite purpose !
Dr. COCKBURN: I only take the authorities
that we have. Take Bryce.
Sir Samuel Geiffith : Does he say that?
Dr. COCKBURN: He says that the conventions
w r ere established as a check on the popular will, and
democracy has ridden right over them. I say that
you can impose wdiat barriers you like; but you will,
sooner or later, find the popular will prevail.
Sir John Downee : That is no argument against
it!
Dr. COCKBURN: It is; and I say that it is no
use trying to thwart the popular will.
Sir John Downee : That is another matter !
Dr. COCKBURN: You cannot stop its current,
and it is w 7 ell not to attempt to divert it. By making
the people, either in approving of the constitution at
its initiation, or in approving of any alteration, pro-
nounce their opinion through any mediator whatever,
you confuse the issue. It is better to go direct to
the people and ask them to say aye or nay; that is
government by the people.
Mr. Gillies : What does the hon. member mean
by going to the people of the commonw'ealth and
asking them to say aye or nay ? _
Dr, COCKBURN : I mean going to each elector in-
dividually, and asking him, “Are you in favour of this
proposed constitution, or of this proposed amendment


of the constitution under which you live? —say
‘yes’ or ‘no’ directly, without any confused issue—•
without saying whether you wish this man or another
to be your exponent.” The doctrine of the wise man
elected to the convention and exercising his judgment
cannot altogether be depended on. The people will
take care, no doubt, in most instances to know how
he is going to vote before they elect him, and if they
could do so in every instance it would be all right;
but you only defile the stream by diverting its di-
rection. Anything that stands in the way of the
popular will I take to be a misfortune in government
by the people. It can only be a check which causes
the waters to accumulate, and what is a gentle flow
becomes a torrent. As the hon. member, Mr. Play-
ford, with whom I agree, does not propose an amend-
ment, I move :
That the words “conventions to be elected by” be omitted.
Mr. Gillies : What does the hon. member mean
by the electors of the state P
Dr. COCKBURN : I certainly do not mean such
a pure body of democracy as I should have liked to
see when first we started with this constitution.
Mr. Gillies : What does the hon. member
mean ?
Dr. COCKBURN : I mean what I say —the
electors of the several states.
Colonel Smith : By a majority of each state !
Dr. COCKBURN : By a majority of the people
of each state, from whom this constitution originated.
I mean that they and no others shall be consulted ;
that the appeal shall not be to the convention, but to
the people themselves.
Colonel Smith : I wish to ask the hon. member,
Dr. Cockburn, if he carries out his amendment,
whether it will not mean, in fact, a majority of the
majority of the states ?
Dr. Cockburn : Hear, hear !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: The amendment
fairly raises the question of conventions as against a
plebiscite; I certainly challenge the accuracy of
the hon. member’s statement as to the history of
conventions. Ido not believe the historical view is
correct as to the object for which conventions were
introduced; but certainly the purposes for which
they have been used have been absolutely in the
interests of democracy. It is an institution thor-
oughly used in America. No amendment of the
constitution is made without a convention. The
people of that country, who are practical people,
recognise that millions of people are not capable of
discussing matters in detail; they deal with general
principles, and select men whom they trust to deal
with details. That is the principle of conventions.
That is why I think they are far preferable to a ple-
biscite. If the question were to be simply a kingdom,
or a republic, there might be a plebiscite upon that.
But suppose the question were settled in favour of a
kingdom, what would be the basis P How many
other questions would you have to put? You must
have a complicated document, and in order that the
electors may exercise an intelligent vote they must
be thoroughly familiar with every detail. Is that a
practicable state of things ? Will you ever get the
electors to vote under those circumstances ? I think
not. Those are the reasons why I think a conven-
tion is better than a plebiscite. I should like per-
sonally to see it left to the federal parliament to
determine in what way the question shall be sub-
mitted, but I am quite content that the clause shall
be adopted. I believe that on the whole it is the best
way, and I recommend the Committee to take that
view.
Mr. DEAKIN: I do not propose to enter into
this question at length, because I have had an oppor-
tunity already of arguing it in the Constitutional
Committee, where the advocates of the referendum
were in a comparatively small minority. But, surely
the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, has misled the
Committee in the view which he has put forward with
reference to conventions. What does this clause
say ? It says that for any proposed amendment of
the constitution to become law a majority of conven-
tions or the conventions of a majority of states must
agree to it. How ?
Sir Samuel Griffith : By vote !
Mr. DEAKIN : Will they agree to it as delibera-
tive bodies, one amending it in one particular, and
another amending it in another particular ?
Sir Samuel Griffith: No!
Mr. DEAKIN: Exactly. The conventions are
simply to be called together to say yes or no. The
hon. member says that the electors themselves can-
not say yes or no to these complicated propositions,
or to the complicated propositions which may pos-
sibly be proposed as an amendment of the constitu-
tion ; but they can elect men who will only be able
to say yes or no, with just as little reason, or with
just as little opportunity of amending, or shaping a
particular proposal to their wishes, as the original
electors. Surely the conventions, with their hands
tied as they are tied by this clause, and as, in my
opinion, they ought to be tied, if they are there at
all, can only give exactly the same answer as the
electors. Eor my part, 1 would much prefer to go
to the electors in the first instance. The amend-
ments of the American Constitution have been made
on such broad lines, they have involved such simple
propositions that they have come readily within the
grasp of every elector who has been called upon to
give judgment on them. I believe this bill which
the hon. member has drawn is sufficiently compre-
hensive to form the basis and the framework of the
future constitution of the commonwealth for genera-
tions to come, and that any amendment which may
require to be made in it will be made in short,
succicnt propositions for an alteration of its prin-
ciples, which can be submitted with case to the
people of the country, and on which the people
of the country can give their judgment with cer-
tainty and with knowledge. The intermediary
conventions, such as the hon. member proposes,
gives none of the advantages of a deliberative body.
They can only say aye or no, and therefore you
simply introduce between the amendment of the
constitution and the people, a body of men who are
elected to say simply yes or no, and not to exercise
their reason in any way. I ask the Committee in
what respect is that any better than asking the
electors themselves, in the first instance, to say yes
or no ? The electors will only vote for a man who
says yes, if they wish yes, or for a man who says no,
if they wish no, and there is an end of the business.
Why cannot the electors write yes or no on ballot
papers? To enter into the whole question of the
proper relation of the referendum to representative
government would be to unduly trespass on the
attention of the Committee. But I protest alto-
gether against the doctrine that the referendum in
any way interferes with representative government
or lessens the dignity of parliament. In (Switzerland
the people have the power of demanding a referen-
dum and obtaining it when they so desire; but in
the majority of cases it is exercised after the houses
have already legislated, and as a check upon the
houses. On the floor of this Chamber I have not
hesitated to state again and again that though as
between the two chambers I am glad to see any
proposal which strengthens that in which the people
are best represented, still as between the chambers
and the people there is no choice, and the power of
general review and of general judgment should
be left as far as possible with the people as it is
now by our general elections, by sending minis-
ters to their constituents, by our adoption of
the principle in local option clauses. We are adopt-
ing the principle of the popular vote more and more


into the present framework of representative and re-
sponsible government. It is not in the least foreign to
it, but can be grafted upon it as an assistance to Par-
liament if they desire to obtain distinctly and without
the introduction of foreign matter the verdict of the
people on any particular question. I shall vote for
the amendment, and trust we shall see this clause so
amended as to substitute in each case a direct refer-
endum on all proposed amendments of the constitu-
tion so as to obtain the opinion of a majority of the
people in the majority of the states,
Mr. BAKEE : The hon. member, Mr. Deakin, has
asked what is the use of the people electing persons
to say “ yes ” or “ no ” to any proposition when the
people themselves may say “yes” or “no” without
having an election at all. I will tell him one use, at
all events. If people have to be elected to these
conventions they will go before the electors and
explain both sides of the question to them. For how
otherwise are the people to understand the question ?
Mr. Deakin : That will be done in any case !
Mr. BAKEE: Why will it be done ?
Mr, Deakin : It will be done by those who desire
the amendment and by those who oppose it!
Mr. BAKEE: Who are the persons who will take
the trouble to canvass the country from one end to
the other and explain to the people the object of the
proposed amendment ?
Mr. Deakin : Their representatives in parliament?
Mr. BAKEE: It is all very well to say it will be
thrashed out in parliament; but how many persons
go to parliament to hear the debates ?
Mr. Deakin : It will be thrashed out before the
people!
Mr. BAKEE: By whom?
Mr Deakin : By those who are advocating and
are responsible for the suggestion !
Mr. BAKEE: What I understand by a referen-
dum is this : The federal parliament will pass a bill
to alter the constitution, and the alteration will not
come into force until it is referred to the people. If
it is to be referred to the people, whoso duty is it,
whose interest is it, to go before the people all over
the colony, in different localities, and explain
directly to them the object of the proposed amend-
ment ?
Mr. Deakin : The interest of the party that
brought it in!
Mr. BAKEE : The members of the federal parlia-
ment will not do that.
Mr. Deakin : Yes they will!
Mr. BAKEE: If they do then, I say their nature
will be different from the nature of ordinary mem-
bers of parliament. They will not do so. But if
there is a direct election one party will take one side
and one party the other side, and under the stimulus
of a contested election both sides of the question
will be put to the people, who will be able to under-
stand it, and thus be in a far better position to say
to their representatives in the convention, “You
shall or you shall not vote for this proposition.” It
appears "to me to be one of the fundamental objects
of conventions to induce persons to come forward and
make the round of the constituencies, explaining to the
people that which they are asked to vote upon. If
that course is not pursued, I do not know of any
other persons who would carry out the duty. We
are told that if we pass this amendment we shall
agree to the Swiss system of referendum. But that
is not correct. Under that system the question is,
in many cases, referred to the people twice. There
are two referendums, so far as an alteration of the
constitution is concerned. First of all, the people,
by referendum, say to parliament that it is desirable
to make the alteration.
Mr. Munro : That is the initiative —not the re-
ferendum !
Mr. BAKEE: What I say is, that so far as an
alteration of the constitution is concerned, there is
often a double referendum. The initiative is not
necessarily connected with it. There is a compulsory
initiative so far as an alteration of the constitution is
concerned, and there are two referendums. If we
adopt the Swiss system we shall have to go a great
deal further than the amendment goes. I shall vote
for the clause as it stands. I prefer it to the pro-
posed amendment of it.
Question —That the words proposed to he omitted
stand part of the clause —put. The Committee
divided :
Ayes, 19 ; noes, 9; majority, 10.
Ayes.

Bray, Sir John Kingston, Mr.

Dibbs, Mr. Suttor, Mr.
Grey, Sir George
Question so resolved in the affirmative.
Amendment (by Sir Samuel Griffith) agreed to:
That the word “the ” be inserted after the word “by,” line
15.
Sir SAMUEL GEIEEITH: I move:
That the following words be inserted in place of the word
“ it,” line 12 :—“ and if the people of the states whose conven-
tions approve of the amendment are also a majority of the
people of the commonwealth, the proposed amendment ”
Those words provide for any amendment being
approved by a majority of the people.
Dr. Cockburn : Does that mean a majority of the
people who vote ?
Sir Samuel Griffith; No.
Mr. MUNEO: It means a majority of the popu-
lation of the states, apart from the convention!
Dr. COCKBUEN: Ido not think it is necessary
to make the amendment, because I think popular
majorities can always take care of themselves.
Amendment agreed to.
Mr. KINGSTON: I would ask the hon. member,
Sir Samuel Griffith, whether it is intended by the
bill to provide that an assent on the part of the
Queen’s representative shall be necessary to an
amendment of the constitution if it receives the
approval of the various conventions? As the clause
stands, it provides that the proposed amendment, if
approved by the conventions,
shall become law, subject nevertheless to the Queen’s power of
disallowance.
The words would warrant the suggestion that no
royal assent was intended, and I should like to know
if that is really the intention of the hon. member in
charge of the bill ?
Sir SAMUEL GEIFFITH: The words in the
clause are not the right ones, and the hon. member’s
criticism is quite correct. I move :
That the words, lines 13 and 14, “ become law subject
nevertheless to the Queen’s power of disallowance,” be omitted,
with a view to insert “ be presented to the governor-general for
the Queen’s assent.”
Amendment agreed to.
Sir SAMUEL GEIEFITH: A doubt has been
raised as to whether the concluding words of the
clause are sufficiently explicit as to the minimum
number of representatives, and I doubt whether they
are. I move:
That after the word “commonwealth,” line 16, the following
words be inserted :—“ or the minimum number of representa-
tives of a state in the house of representatives.”
Amendment agreed to ; clause, as amended, agreed
to.


CHAPTER I. — THE LEGISLATURE.
Fart IF. — Provisions relating to loth Houses,
Postponed clause 49 (Place to become vacant on accepting
office of profit).
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: It was pointed out
when we came to this clause that the.proviso except-
ing officers of the military and naval forces is insuf-
ficient, and in fact it is. I move ;
That the proviso, “ But this provision does not apply to
officers of the military or naval forces who are not in receipt
of annual pay,” be omitted with a view to the insertion in
its place of the following proviso “But this provision does
not apply to a person who is in receipt only of pay, half-pay,
or a pension, as an officer of the Queen’s navy or army, or
who receives a new commission in the Queen’s navy or army,
or an increase of pay on a new commission, or who is in
receipt only of pay as an officer or member of the military
or naval forces of the commonwealth, and whose services are
not wholly employed by the commonwealth.”
Mr. DIBBS : I would ask the hon. member why
naval and military officers should have a special
privilege which is not proposed to be granted to
officers of the civil service of a colony w r ho may
have rendered good service to ihe country, and have
retired on pensions? Why should they be debarred
from becoming senators or representatives? I do
not think that the hon. member has in this amend-
ment followed the direction of the consensus of
opinion manifested by the Convention a few days
ago. He proposes to make the clause clear so far as
naval and military officers are concerned, but he
ignores altogether the undoubted right which the
civil servants of the various states should possess
when they leave the service if they can find con-
stituencies which will elect them. I should like to
make an amendment in the clause in the direc-
tion I have indicated, if 1 could see a chance
of obtaining the support of hon. members. If
hon. members are tired of discussion, I would
let the matter go; but it is rank injustice to our
own people to disqualify them, while we are confer-
ring favours on imperial officers.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : The hon. member
asks me why it is so ; and ray answer to him is that
it is not so. The hon. member asks why a distinction
is made; and my answer is that a distinction is not
made. There is nothing in the clause to disqualify
civil servants who have retired on pensions.
Mr. DIBBS: I believe that the hon. and learned
member proposes to omit only the last two lines of
the clause ; but the other portion disqualifies our own
people.
Sir Samuel Griffith : No !.
Mr. Tiitnne : They hold pensions under an act,
not during pleasure !
Sir Samuel Griffith : The only pensioners during
pleasure are military pensioners !
Mr. DIBBS: I want to know why a civil servant
who has served his country for twenty years and
honestly earned his pension should lose his civil
rights ?
Sir Samuel Griffith : He will not!
Mr. DIBBS : Under the clause as I read it a civil
service pensioner is debarred from the privilege of
becoming a member of the parliament.
Amendment agreed to ; clause, as amended, agreed
to.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I intend to propose
a new clause, dealing with the mode of reckoning the
population. The clause was in the bill as prepared
by the drafting committee, but the general committee
struck out the clauses to which it referred. Those
clauses having been reinserted, it is necessary that
this clause also should be reinserted. I move:
That the following new clause be inserted, to stand clause
3 of chapter vn :—“ In reckoning the number of people of a
state, or other part of the commonwealth, the aboriginal
natives of Australia shall not be counted.”
New clause agreed to.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I will now move, sir,
that you leave the chair, and report the draft bill to
the Convention with amendments. There are verbal
amendments required in some of the clauses, how-
ever, and the bill will have to be recommitted for the
purpose of dealing with them.
Bill reported with amendments.
Motion (by Mr. Abbott) proposed :
That the report be now adopted.
Amendment (by Sir Samuel Griffith) agreed to :
That all the words after “That” be omitted, with a view
to insert the following :—“ the bill be recommitted for
the reconsideration of clause 8; chapter i, clause 52, para-
graphs 21, 22, 29, and 30 : clause 53, and chapter vn, clause
1.”
In Committee (Recommittal) :
The following clauses were verbally amended: —
Preliminary clause 8; chapter I, clause 52, paragraphs
21, 22, 29, 30; clause 53.
CHAPTER YII. —MISCELLANEOUS.
Clause 1. The seat of government ©f the commonwealth
shall be determined by the parliament
Mr. DIBBS: I move :
That the words “ determined by the parliament” be
omitted, with a view to the insertion in their place of the
words “Sydney, New South Wales.”
I am perfectly satisfied that this Convention has no
right to close its proceedings without giving an
expression of opinion as to where the capital of the
future commonwealth should be. I should fail in
my duty as a representative of Hew South Wales if
I did not ask the Convention to unanimously record
their vote in favour of the amendment, lion, mem-
bers made very light of the matter when they heard
this notice of motion being given, and the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. Munro, made the remark “We want it in
Melbourne,” and another hon. member said, “We want
it in South Australia,” and so on. There is one place
alone which the people of New South Wales will
accept as the capital. If they are to give up all
their privileges and a large portion of their liberties,
which this bill will take from them, they must, at
least, have some regard to their antiquity, and their
natural advantages, to the fact of their being cen-
trally situated, and, above all, to the fact that New
South Wales is practically the mother of all the other
colonies. I will divide the Convention on the matter.
Those members who represent New South Wales will
be traitors to their colony, and the representatives of
the other colonies who vote against me will be
ungrateful to the colony from which they sprang,
and will be neglecting the interests of the whole of
the commonwealth, if they do not give me the full
measure of their support on this motion.
Sir GEORGE GKEY: I understand that in order
that a division may be taken it is necessary that a
seconder should bo found for the motion. lam so
desirous that every possible consideration should be
bestowed on any claim that the colony of New South
Wales may put forward that I have undertaken on
this ground to second the motion. I take this oppor-
tunity of saying that in former days, when all was at
stake in New Zealand in the dangerous position in
which the native war had placed us, the first colony
to give us assistance was New South Wales. The
Governor, Sir George Gipps, helped by the people
of New South Wales, gave us every assistance in his
power to bestow in the shape of money, troops, arms,
and ammunition —in fact, all the munitions of war ;
and, in addition to that, by his own advice and
counsel, he afforded great assistance indeed to the
colony of New Zealand. Now, I have an opportunity,
to some extent, of repaying the debt of gratitude that
I contracted so long ago. I shall always feel grate-
ful in the extreme. I second the motion.


Question —That the words proposed to he omitted

Bill reported with further amendments.
A PLEBISCITE.
Sir GiEOEGE GEET rose to move :
That previously to the bill “to constitute the common-
wealth of Australia ” being laid before the British Parliament,
it should be submitted to and adopted by a majority of a
plebiscite of the people of Australia, at which each voter
should give a single vote.
He said: I maintain that where a great event is to
be brought about in a country, the greatest probably
which can ever occur in its history, it is right that
before such a new form of constitution as has been
proposed is forced upon the colony of New South
Wales a plebiscite of the people should be taken for
the purpose of determining whether or not a majority
of those who vote on the occasion are in favour of
that constitution being adopted by Australasia. It
is needless, sir, for me at present to press on this
motion at great length, I believe it is a self-evident
proposal that I am making, and that probably it will
be assented to without difficulty—that at least is my
hope. I shall have an opportunity of replying to any
arguments urged against it. Saying, therefore, simply
this—that I believe every man, especially every head
of a family, has an absolute and just right to give a
vote upon so great and momentous a question—l
submit the motion to the Convention.
Question proposed.
Dr. COCKBUEN : I move :
That the question be amended by the insertion after the
word “Australia,” line 4, of the words “ and a majority of the
people of the several colonies.”
We require not only a plebiscite of the people as a
whole, but a plebiscite of each colony. This pro-
vision I think the hon. member has omitted from the
motion, which I shall have much pleasure in sup-
porting as proposed to be amended.
Sir GEOEGE GEET: I believe that when a
plebiscite is taken it is a majority of the whole voters
which is considered. If hon. gentlemen desire it in
the way proposed I shall raise no objection; but I
understood that the other is the usual way.
Mr. GILLIES: This amendment will defeat the
motion, because it will be a majority of the people .of
the states instead of a majority of the people.
Dr. Cockbubn : A majority of both!
Amendment proposed.
Sir SAMUEL GEIFFITH: I think it is consistent,
at any rate, with the view wo have taken throughout
our labours on the constitution to hold that it
should be adopted by the states separately, and not
by the people of Australia as a whole, because a
majority of the people of Australia as a whole might
be comprised within two states, so that the motion in
the form in which it is moved would certainly be
entirely inconsistent with the whole lines which we
have adopted from the beginning of our proceedings
to the end. With respect to the adoption of the
constitution by a plebiscite, that matter was discussed
at an earlier period of the day in the Committee,
and the conclusion then adopted was that, with res-
pect to amendments of the constitution, they should
be submitted to conventions. I gave notice just now
of a motion for to-morrow proposing that the mode
in which the different colonies should adopt the con-
stitution be left to them. I have my own idea as to
which is the best way; other people may have
different ideas as to which is the best way. I
am disposed for my part to think that it would be
wiser either to leave it to the states themselves,
by their parliaments, to say in what way they will
take the opinion of their people, or else to adopt
the plan of conventions. But I do not think a
plebiscite of the people is the best way of ascer-
taining their opinion upon a complicated matter like
this. Ido not know any instance where so compli-
cated a matter as a new constitution has been sub-
mitted to a plebiscite. I do not purpose at any
length to give the reasons for coming to that con-
clusion, but it is sufficient, I think, to point out that
a very large proportion at least of the electors would
not have made themselves thoroughly acquainted
with the constitution before they voted upon it.
There would be no one specially interested in making
them acquainted with it. The ordinary influences
that operate and secure a full vote on matters of
moment would be to a great extent wanting. There
would be wanting the personal interest of candi-
dates. For these reasons I believe that a plebiscite
with respect to a constitution like this would not
result in obtaining the deliberate opinion of the
majority of the people of the continent, and being
of that opinion of course I cannot vote for asking
their opinion in that manner.
Mr. DEAKIN: So far as the affirmation of the
principle goes, I should be compelled to vote for the
motion, if it were possible to give it effect consistently
with the constitution to which we have already
agreed. I simply wish at tlm outset to indicate a
difference of opinion from my hon. friend, Sir Samuel
Griffith, believing, as I do, that the electors would be
made fully acquainted with the merits or demerits of
the constitution, and feeling certain that there would
be no want of representatives of the people holding
views favourable and unfavourable to the constitution,
who would come forward on public platforms and in
the press to discuss it. But my difficulty is that
agreeing with the amendment, I can scarcely see my
way to agree to the motion, cordially as I indorse
its principle, for this reason: the constitution as it
stands contains a provision that it is to be adopted
if any three colonies will consent. We may not
unreasonably suppose that the legislatures of all the
colonies would be willing to remit the question of
the acceptance or the rejection of the constitution to
a vote of their people. The consequence may easily
be that four states may agree by majorities to accept
it, and three states may agree to reject it, and yet if
this motion were carried the fact that there was a
majority of voters in those three states which had
decided to remain outside the union, would operate
as a bar to the four states which desired to take
advantage of the constitution, and would thus directly
defeat the object which we have in view. lam
perfectly well aware that this resolution is only an
expression of opinion by the Convention, and that
we have no means of enforcing it. But it involves
this inconsistency. I am thoroughly with the hon.
gentleman in the opinion that this constitution should
be submitted to the people, and that it should be
submitted by plebiscite or referendum, and that each
voter should give a single vote. Upon all these
matters, I am in accord with the hon. gentleman.
As the resolution stands, it might seem to indicate


that a majority of the people in the colonies which
do not intend to join in the federation might prevent
its adoption by the people of the colonies willing to
accept the constitution. I am sure that is not the
hon. member’s intention; but, as the resolution
stands, it does seem to involve that inconsistency,
and, unless it be removed, I shall feel unable to vote
for it.
Mr. MUNRO : It appears to me that there is
another and still more fatal objection to the resolu-
tion than that just pointed out by my hon. colleague.
AVe received from our various parliaments a man-
date to come here for the purpose of considering and
reporting upon a constitution ; consequently when
we have done that our mission is ended, and for us
to say in what way the colonies are afterwards to
deal with the matter appears to me to be a piece of
impertinence. AYe are sent here to do a particular
work. lam happy to say that that work has, to a
large extent, been done, and that it has probably
been done successfully. But for us now to dictate
to our masters w r ho sent us here would be, it appears
to me, to make a great mistake. I should object to
any resolution of the kind, no matter how much it
might be in accord with my views. My desire is that
we should not exceed the authority given to us.
Mr. FITZGERALD : I presume that if this ques-
tion were submitted to the vote of the people at all,
it would have to be upon the broad question as to
whether we should have federation or not. It is
opposed to all common-sense to ask for a vote of the
people upon a constitution involving complicated
details such as are contained in this bill. How could
a simple “yes” or “no” apply to such a constitution
as that we have adopted? A portion of it might, in
the opinion of certain people, be very desirable, and
one clause might be very undesirable. Is it suggested
that the whole scheme of federation should be thrown
aside because there is a single point in it which does
not receive the support of a majority of the people ?
It appears to me that the answer given to the resolu-
tion by the hon. member, Mr. Munro, is complete.
AYe are here to do a specific work, which we have
accomplished. And it is not for us to dictate to the
various parliaments what action they should take to
ascertain the feeling of the people of the respective
states. I apprehend, with the hon, member, that in
so doing we should be going outside the limits of our
commission. A plebiscite may be a very desirable
thing in the abstract; but I fail to see why on every
possible occasion those who favour that principle of
ascertaining the people’s will should advocate its
adoption. In my opinion we should be making a
great and signal blunder if we were to adopt this
resolution.
Mr. DIBBS: I intend to vote for the resolution,
and to endeavour so to amend it that it will more
clearly express the views of the mover. Hon. mem-
bers are probably aware that a plebiscite is the fairest
way in which the people of these colonies could bo
asked to express their opinion upon the question.
Before this constitution is finally adopted, it will
have to go before the people.
Mr. Munro : Through the parliaments !
Mr. DIBBS : It will have to go before the people.
Mr. Dkakin : It will bo adopted through both the
parliament and the people !
Mr. DIBBS : It will have to go before the parlia-
ments first, and if the parliaments accept it, it will
be necessary to ascertain the opinion of the people.
Nothing can be more simple than to ask the people,
the plain question whether they are in favour of the
constitution as passed by their parliament or not.
AYhere is the complication, as suggested by the hon.
member, Mr. Fitzgerald ? AVhat complication can
arise in asking the people this simple question ?
Mr. Munro : Parliament will decide in what way
the matter is to be put before the people.
Mr. DIBBS: They will decide by approving of,
disapproving of, or amending the constitution.
Mr. Munro : Why dictate to the parliaments as
to what shall be done ?
Mr. DIBBS : It is merely an expression of opinion,
Mr. Deakin : Hear, hear ; it is not binding !
Mr. DIBBS : And it will have the effect of showing
to the people of the various colonies the fairness of
this Convention—that its members are anxious that
the people should honestly join with them in establish-
ing a federation. Now, if the question of federation
or no federation he submitted to the various con-
stituencies—l speak now of New South Wales —the
question will be mixed up with the question of free-
trade and protection, or with some sectarian cry, and
the people will not honestly and clearly express their
opinion with regard to federation. Nothing can be
more simple or easy than for the various parliaments to
deal with the constitution as it has been framed here.
If it be approved of by the various parliaments, then
let a plebiscite be taken, let the people be asked
whether they are in favour of or against the federa-
tion as approved by their parliament. I have no
desire to complicate the question, and I should like
to move an amendment to the effect that the constitu-
tion should be submitted to and adopted by a majority
of plebiscites of the people of the several colonies.
Dr. COCKBUEN : I ask leave to withdraw my
amendment.
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
Mr. DIBBS ; Then I move:
That all the words after the word “ by” be omitted with a
view to insert the words “ majorities of the plebiscites
of the people of the several colonies.”
Mr. FitzGerald : What does the hon. member
mean by “ majorities of the plebiscites” ?
Mr. DIBBS: That there shall be a plebiscite in
each colony.
Sir George Grey : I accept the amendment of
Mr. Dibbs.
Motion amended accordingly.
Mr. GTLLIES: It appears to me that, notice of
motion having been given by the hon. member, Sir
Samuel Griffith, to consider this question to-morrow,
it is scarcely fair that we should be forced to con-
sider it to-night. It is a very important question,
and we ought not to hurry it. It will require all
our consideration to enable us to arrive at a con-
clusion which will be satisfactory to all the colonies
as to the way in wffiich this question is to be sub-
mitted, and I think we are scarcely prepared to
decide upon an arbitrary motion of this kind, and, so
far as the amendment now proposed is concerned,
we have had no notice of it,
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I think we ought to
adopt the constitution ourselves before we decide
upon the manner in which that constitution is to be
accepted by the states, and before we ask the parlia-
ments to adopt the constitution in a certain way.
Sir GEORGE GREY, in reply: This motion has
been on the order-paper for a long period of time,
and whatever may be the form of constitution which
we adopt to-morrow, it will not in the least inter-
fere with this resolution. It is almost essential
before we adopt the proposal to be made to us
to-morrow that we should know the exact manner
in which the people will have an opportunity of
deciding this question. This is a step preliminary
to the other, instead of one that ought to follow it.
I feel that my proposal is so fair, so just, that I can-
not imagine any objection can be made to it in its
present form. I fear myself that the proposal which
will be made will be that each state shall be made
to adopt the constitution by the legislature of each
colony adopting it. I fear that is the intention, and
I say, in point of fact, that the legislatures of the
several colonies at present in no way represent the
people. AYe have here a very anomalous form of
437
NATIONAL AUSTRALASIAN CONVENTION, 1891. '


constitution put upon us by the British Parliament
without any of us being heard—at least that was the
case in most instances—or without our being repre-
sented in the Parliament which gave us those consti-
tutions. I think that now we should affirm that we
will not accept any constitution except upon the con-
dition of its being submitted to the people in the
manner proposed in this motion. We have a perfect
right to propose that. If any other form be adopted
it would be a great injustice to New Zealand ; that
is to say, if it is left to the state legislatures to decide
whether or not the constitution shall be adopted,
because the constitution is to my mind absolutely
unfair to the people of New Zealand. We have not
provided any fair form of representation for the
people which is at all consistent with the advanced
views of the present time. I feel certain that it
would be an unjustifiable act on our part to attempt
to force this constitution on New r Zealand by resolving
that the question of the adoption of the constitution
is to be settled by the parliaments of the several
colonies as they now exist. I shall, therefore, press
the resolution, and I think I am dealing justly
with the whole of the people in proposing that
if they desire to have this constitution at all,
every man who pleases may vote upon that ques-
tion upon the principle of one man one vote. I
feel certain that if that is not acceded to the
probability is that the people of New Zealand will
absolutely reject the constitution. Let every man
express his opinion. That would be a means of
educating the people on political questions. I
believe that the discussions which have taken place
here have exercised already a very great influence
upon the people of Australasia. They begin to look
at matters in a very different light from what they
formerly did. I feel confident that if allowed to
express their opinion upon the constitution from
one erd of the country to the other, the people will
become fully instructed on every question connected
with it, and they will, in fact, be better able to
judge as to what will be for their own interests than
we possibly can be. Unable as we are to sympathise
with many of their views, ignorant as we are of
many of their sufferings, their wants, and the
troubles which they have to undergo, I say we are
not fair judges whether they ought to be subjected
to a certain constitution or not. It is our duty to
obtain for them such privileges as I now stand up to
claim.

ADDRESSES.
The President : I have received an address from
the Sydney Chamber of Commerce. I should
explain that this address is dated 11th March last;
but I have no recollection of its being received. A
copy of it has been made, which the secretary will
now read, and also an address from the Chamber of
Commerce at Suva.
The following addresses were read by the secre-
tary ;
Sydney Chamber of Commerce,
Sydney, llth March, 1891.
The TTon. Sir Henry Parkes, G.C.M.G., President Australasian
Federation Convention, Sydney, New South Wales.
Sir, —I have the honor to inform you that at the first
meeting of the committee of this convention since the open-
ing of the Australasian Federation Convention (held this day)
the following resolution was unanimously adopted :
That the Sydney Chamber of Commerce cordially welcomes the delegates
of the Australasian Federation Convention, watches with profound interest
their deliberations, and hopes their labours may eventuate in the
increased commercial prosperity of Federated Australasia.
I have, &c.,
Henry Charles Mitchell,
Secretary.
Chamber of Commerce, Suva, Fiji,
Ist April, 1891.
Gentlemen, —I have the honor, on behalf of the Suva
Chamber of Commerce, to offer my and their sincere con-
gratulations to you, as members of a convention assembled for
a purpose so important to the welfare of the whole of the
Australasian group.
Although Fiji has no representative among you, yet no less
is she included amongst the colonies of Australasia. My
chamber, cognisant and proud of that fact, desire therefore to
add their testimony to that of the other colon’es to the import-
ance of the work you have undertaken, and to mark its sense
of the efficient manner in which it is being conducted.
Wishing you all success in your onerous undertaking. I
have, &c., Henry H. Marks,
Chairman, Suva Chamber of Commerce.
COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA BILL.
ADOPTION OF COMMITTEE’S REPORT.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: I rise to move:
That the draft bill reported from the Committee be adopted
by this Convention.
I do not propose to make any lengthy speech in
support of this motion. In bringing up the draft
bill from the Constitutional Committee, I had the
opportunity to explain briefly its provisions, and they
have since been very fully considered in the Com-
mittee of the whole Convention ; but the alterations
made in the bill have not in any way affected
its principles. They have left me nothing new
to add, and I do not feel disposed to make a speech
merely for the sake of speaking. I only desire, if
I may, to offer my congratulations to the Convention
upon having proceeded so far in their work. I, for
one, believe that the constitution which we have
framed, although it probably does not meet exactly
the views of any member of the Convention, will
probably commend itself to a large majority of us.
Indeed, the probability is that it is the best constitu-
tion that could be framed with any chance of accept-
ance by the people of the colonies. I am satisfied
that the more it is considered by them the more they
will be inclined to come to that conclusion. Without
further preface I submit the motion to the Convention.
Question proposed.


Mr. DIBBS: I do not rise with the view of
offering any lengthy remarks, but to elicit certain
information. I would like the hon. member who
has had charge of the bill, and who so largely helped
in its preparation, and so ably carried it through
Committee, to offer some explanation which would
make one or two of the clauses a little clearer. I
would first direct the hon. gentleman’s attention to
chapter i, clause 52, tub-clause 3. By this sub-
clause power is given to the commonwealth to raise
money
by any other mode or system of taxation ; but so that all
such taxation shall be uniform throughout the commonwealth.
Then, if the hon. member will turn to chapter v,
clause 1, he will find these words:
All powers which at the date of the establishment of the
commonwealth are vested in the parliaments of the several
colonies, and which are not by this constitution exclusively
vested in the parliament of the commonwealth, or withdrawn
from the parliaments of the several states, are reserved to,
and shall remain vested in, the parliaments of the states
respectively.
It seems to me that some little explanation is required
as to whether the powers of which the colonies now
stand possessed of raising money by any mode of
taxation which they think fit, is taken out of their
hands, and left absolutely with the proposed common-
wealth parliament.
Sir Samuel Gbiffith : No ; the federal parlia-
ment has power to make laws on certain subjects,
and until it does so the powers of the states remain,
Mr. DIBBS : I know that; but when the common-
wealth has dealt with customs and excise, the sole
power of dealing with customs and excise will remain
in the hands of the commonwealth, and not of the
states. It is about clause 52, sub-clause 3, that I
particularly want information, and I am sure the
people of the colony will be very glad to have some
explanation of the matter from the hon. member.
This sub-clause will give the commonwealth exclusive
power of raising money by any form of taxation.
Sir Samuel Gbiffith : No; concurrent power!
Mr. DIBBS: Where is the word “concurrent?”
I failed to gather from the debate that there was any
means of raising money except by taxation. The
clause says that, “ so that all such taxation shall be
uniform throughout the commonwealth” it shall be
left in the hands of the commonwealth. I feel sure
that hon. members will be glad to be perfectly clear
on this point, because the bill will be discussed in the
various parliaments, and we shall have to face our
constituents upon it. It is therefore necessary for
us to have the fullest information, so that we may be
able to place it before the people through the parlia-
ments. I want it to be clearly understood that the
states have not forfeited their rights of taxation by
allowing the 3rd sub-clause of clause 52, part v,
relating to the powers of the commonwealth to raise
money, to pass as it stands in the bill. To make my
meaning clear, I will put a case: Take the case of
New South Wales. This colony requires to raise, in
round numbers, something like £2,000,000 for the
annual payment of interest on our public debt. We
shall require, in all probabilit}', to go to the country
for a land-tax and an income-tax, and what I wish to
arrive at is as to whether the states will be able to
look to land and income as sources of revenue when
this constitution becomes law, and when the 3rd sub-
clause of clause 52 stands as portion of the law of
the land.
Sir Samuel Gbiffith : Yes !
Mr. Munbo : Certainly !
Mr. DIBBS: Then let the explanation be made
known. Let it be understood that the people of
Australia will be liable to two forms of taxation in
the shape of income-tax and land-tax ; that the com-
monwealth may agree to a land and income-tax, and
that the states will have left to them the power of
also agreeing to an income-tax for state purposes.
If the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, will make
that perfectly clear, we shall know how we stand.
Whilst the hon. gentleman is making the explanation,
I trust he will also make another explanation. This
bill has been framed in a remarkably short space of
time, and has been passed in a shorter time than any
such important bill has been passed in any other part
of the world.
Mr. Abbott : It only took nineteen days for the
American people to form their constitution ! •
Mr. DIBBS: The hon. member speaks from his
knowledge of history, which he has read with his
eyes and understood with his elbows !
Mr. Abbott : That is the hon. gentleman’s usual
courtesy!
Mr. DIBBS: When the hon. gentleman makes a
statement which is at once corrected by those around
him, he might apologise for the interruption. We
are here, not to deal with matters of courtesy, but
to perform a solemn duty; and we have a right
to obtain all the information we possibly can. After
to-day there will be no opportunity of asking ques-
tions and obtaining information, and we shall only
have the ex parte statements of the strong advocates
of federation, or the strong opponents of federation.
The hon. gentleman who has prepared this bill is the
proper person to give us any information which is
required, and I know he will cheerfully do so. An-
other point on which I desire information —and not
myself alone but other members of the Convention —
is in regard to what is termed the inspection law.
On page 20 of the revised copy of the bill, and in
clause 13, it is stated :
A state shall not impose any taxes or duties on imports or
exports, except such as are necessary for executing the inspec-
tion laws of the state ; and the net produce of all taxes and
duties imposed by a state on imports or exports shall be for
the use of the commonwealth ; and any such inspection laws
may be annulled by the parliament of the commonwealth.
If the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, will add to
his other obligations to the Convention, and to myself
personally, by giving some information as to the
meaning of the expression, “ inspection law r ,” I shall
esteem it a favour. I only ask these very important
questions because the public will require to know
whether, by adopting this constitution, they are
granting to their own state parliaments the power of
taxing land and income, and whether they are giving
an equal power to the commonwealth parliament—
whether each parliament will have that power, or
whether it is reserved to the commonwealth to make
one uniform system of land-tax and income-tax
throughout the country.
Sir SAMUEL GKIFEITH: If the members of
the Convention will allow me to answer the hon.
gentleman I shall be very glad to do so. The hon.
gentleman asks whether the powers of taxation, other
than those relating to customs and excise, will be ex-
clusively vested in the federal parliament, or whether
the other parliaments will also possess those powers.
There is no doubt that all the parliaments of the
states will have precisely the same powers of taxation
as they have at present, with the sole exception of
the right to impose customs and excise duties, after
a uniform tariff has been established. It is possible
that both parliaments might impose taxes on the
same thing. That cannot be helped. lam sure the
federal parliament would never impose direct taxation
excepting in a case of great national urgency. The
other question the hon. gentleman asks is as to what
is the meaning of inspection laws. Import duties
might be imposed under the guise of inspection laws.
Eor instance, a stock-tax might be imposed, and it
might be termed an inspection tax ; the cattle might
be inspected with the object of seeing whether they
are suffering from pleuro-pneurnonia, and 10s. ahead
for the inspection might be charged. The clause
dealing with that matter is the same as the one con-
tained in the Constitution of the United States, to


prevent states imposing import duties under such
pretences. They may very properly pass inspection
laws for instance in the case of stock suffering from
disease, or in the case of tea, kerosene, explosives, or
articles of that kind ; but if they have the power to
do that it should be for the purposes of inspection
only, and they ought not to use the power to place a
restriction on trade.
The Vice- President took the Chair.
Sir HENET PAEKES : I hope I shall have no
need to offer apologies for saying a few words at this
stage of our business. I naturally must have, in
some measure, a special interest in the event which
has taken place. It is only some seventeen months
ago since the proposal for holding this Convention
was first made, and I think I may say with all sin-
cerity I never in my most sanguine moments,
expected that we should reach this great and impor-
tant stage at so early a date. It is a pleasure to me
to recognise the voice of the hon. member, Mr.
Munro, as the first definite voice that gave me en-
couragement. About the time when my letter to
the hon. member, Mr. Gillies, was sent at the end
of the year 1889, the hon. member, Mr. Munro,
made a speech to his constituents at Geelong, and I
noticed, naturally enough, that in that speech he
emphatically and unreservedly expressed his con-
currence in the proposal then made. Another
gentleman here was the second to give me a word of
concurrence and encouragement, very soon after
what fell from the hon. member, Mr. Munro —that
is, Sir Thomas Mcllwraith. I could not for a
moment suppose that events would march so rapidly
as they have done, and a few months afterwards I
was most pleasurably surprised by the cordial
support to this proposal offered by the late premier
of Victoria, the hon. member, Mr. Gillies, and also
by the hon. member, Mr. Deakin. Since then things
have gone on with increasing speed, until we have
arrived at the conclusion of the work of this Con-
vention. I have no more to say in words of that
character; but I desire now to offer my most sincere
congratulations to the delegates from the different
Australian colonies, not simply on the result of their
labours, but also on the admirable tact, the untiring
perseverance, and the disposition to consider each
others’ views, which have characterised the whole of
the proceedings of this Convention. Naturally in
an assembly of forty-five gentlemen, many of them
leaders of public opinion, it could not be otherwise
than that there would be strong differences of
opinion ; but, however strongly marked those differ-
ences of opinion have been, they have never sunk
into what could be called vituperation, or even
distrust—not in one single instance to my knowledge.
We must make fair allowances for men’s feelings and
for their different modes of giving expression to those
feelings ; but, on the whole, the proceedings of this
Convention have been marked by a regard for each
other, and by a disposition to reach the great end we
have had in view with as much harmony as possible,
which, I think, is in the highest degree creditable,
and I think that the work which we have performed,
taken as a whole, may be considered a great and
valuable work. I can speak very freely of the con-
stitution bill prepared, because I have had no direct
hand in the preparation of it, nor any hand at all,
beyond stating my reasons in the committee appointed
for that purpose, and offering such suggestions as
occurred to me. I venture to think that it would be
very difficult to find any document of the same
character, which, in the manner in which it has been
reasoned out, and the clearness with which its prin-
ciples are expressed, would be very superior to the
document which we have produced, and I venture to
think that all these colonies may, and I dare to
prophesy, although it is rather a dangerous thing to
prophesy, that they will be quite satisfied with the
result of these labours. There have been points of
dissent and contention, naturally enough, in coming
to our conclusions; but again I venture to think
that those points of dispute, as time rolls on, will be
fouud to have been best treated in this bill. I allude
specially to the powers of the senate, to the position
of the governor-general, and to the status of the
governors of the colonies. I venture to think that
experience will show that the compromise arrived
at has been, considering the adverse opinions held
by hon. gentlemen, a wise, temperate, and successful
compromise. The more the bill is discussed, I
feel persuaded the better it will be for it, and I
am certain that in the light of discussion all those
compromises will appear to have been wise and just.
I do not think that I ought to be restrained from
making some reference to the opponents of federation
outside this Convention. We may bo sure that the
bill will meet with perhaps virulent opposition.
We know with what violence of feeling, with what
violence of expression, every great work at every
period of history has been assailed by those who
were opposed to it, and still more by those who
assailed it for no reason at all, and under no guidance
that could be intelligible. We know that at all
times in the mother country when great constitu-
tional changes have taken place —not less in America
—the most violent and unscrupulous expressions of
opinion and exhibitions of conduct were indulged in
by persons who manifested them not so much from
their opposition to some particular constitutional
change as from their disposition to do mischief. I
was reading in a book, which I think, lies on the table,
that during the administration of Washington a
rabble which filled the streets of Philadelphia cried
out that Washington should be- dragged out of his
house and dealt with by the populace; and in the
same book it is stated that the second President of
America was held in such detestation by some persons
that when a mother brought her infant son to the
baptismal font and desired him to be christened
"Thomas Jefferson" —Thomas Jefferson Jones, for
example—the minister peremptorily refused to
christen him, and stated that he would rather
christen him Beelzebub. I read in the same book
of one pious old gentleman who raised his head from
his dying pillow and cried out that he believed in
Jesus Christ and the resurrection, but that he had
a wholesome hatred for the devil and Tom Jefferson.
When such manifestations of feeling as that have
been excited against the men who are now regarded
as public benefactors, we also may expect to
meet with abuse. The first class who will adversely
criticise the work of this Convention will be the
uninformed and the reckless. They are always
ready to denounce any work which they cannot
comprehend, and they exist everywhere—in New
South Wales, in Victoria, in South Australia, and in
all parts of these colonies-; but it is worthy of
remark, and I think I am quite entitled to point out
at this moment that, of all those who so far have
criticised in adverse terms the work of this Conven-
tion, there is not one that has given a clear reason
for the course he has taken, nor one that has stated
the case with any degree of veracity and truth. I
will give examples. We have been accused of giving
away the liberties of New South Wales, and no doubt
the hon. gentleman opposite, Mr. Gillies, and the
hon. gentleman behind me, Mr. Munro, will hear
that we have given away the liberties of Victoria. I
have 110 doubt that my athletic friend, Mr. Kingston,
will hear the same thing in South Australia. But 1
want to ask what liberties we have given away ? I
suppose the liberties of a free people consist in the
protection of their possessions, their lives, their pro-
perty under the laws of the country, and the protec-
tion of their free exercise of the franchise which they
enjoy under the constitution. Have we touched
cither ? Have we given away any security under the


laws of the country ? Have we given away, in any
degree whatever, the liberties enjoyed under the
political institutions of this country ? We rather—
not rather, but in a marked degree—extend the pro-
vince of law, and endeavour to make it more access-
ible and more completely satisfactory to all classes
of the country; and, in regard to the liberties of the
people of this country, so far from giving away
any particle of these liberties, our efforts tend
to vastly extend them. The people of New South
Wales, for example, enjoy every atom of liberty
which they enjoyed before, but their liberties
will be circumscribed only by the shores of
Australia as a whole. Now they have liberty
and political power confined to a very small space on
this continent—then they will have liberty and power
extended over the whole of the colonies. How we
can be accused of giving away the liberties of the
people when the direct contrary is the case —when we
have greatly and benevolently and justly extended
the liberties of all classes of the people—passes
understanding. Then we are accused of giving away
the lands. I will take New South Wales again,
though of course, the case might be stated in con-
nection with any one of the other colonies. We are
accused of giving away the lands of New South
Wales. That is so incorrect that I think I shall be
pardoned if I characterise it as a shameful perversion
of the truth ; for, so far from giving away one inch
of the lands of New South Wales, we have taken
special care to guard the lands, and the territorial
rights, as they stand at the present moment. And
this remark applies to all the other colonies. Then,
again, we are told—and this, especially, is aimed at
New South Wales—that we have given up the con-
trol of our inland rivers, the Murray and the Darling.
We have done nothing of the kind. What we really
have done in this bill is to allow the federal govern-
ment to so regulate these rivers that their navigation
and traffic shall be best promoted in the interests of
all the conterminous colonies. Is not that simply
just ? If, in regard to the Murray and the Darling,
this is done, what becomes of the Murray which I
believe flows fully 200 miles through the territory of
South Australia ? Would not that be in our interest ?
Does not New South Wales, does not Victoria
desire to use the Murray for all the purposes of
trade ? And if the Murray and the Darling in New
South Wales are controlled in the interests of all
Australia, in the interests of all the neighbouring
colonies, is not the Murray in its flow through South
Australia, with South Australian land on both its
banks, and no other, equally conserved in the
interests of New South Wales ? So that I think I
am fully justified in saying that the persons who
have set up to denounce our work have no case what-
ever, and they attempt to put forth no case which is
not based upon gross misrepresentation of facts, and
which cannot be supported by reason. It is proper,
at this stago of my observations, to point out that if
we are going to federate, if we are in earnest in our
desire to make an Australian nation, we must to a
very large extent, look to the whole of Australia. I,
as a citizen of New South Wales, so far as I may have
influence, must look to Victoria, to South Australia,
to Western Australia, to Queensland, and to the
new colonies which are sure to come into existence
just as much as I look to New South Wales, when I
am viewing any matter in a federal light and as a
federal transaction. No doubt it will be our duty to
see that our respective colonies are not injured in
the administration which may follow, and very
possibly at no very distant date, upon our work o"f
the last five or six weeks. No one can complain of
that. So far from complaining of it, the man would
be hardly fit to have a home in any one of the
colonies who did not guard his own particular state
from intrusion, from trespass, and from wrong. But
we must look beyond all that; and we must look to
the national powers, the national rights, and the
national progress of the government which we are
about to erect, and this government would be imper-
fect indeed if it had not a voice in the determination
of how our inland navigation, let the question arise
in whatever colony it may, is to be controlled for the
benefit of these congeries of states—for this new
nation made out of five or six hitherto separated
colonies. Now it is very unpleasant to dwell—and Ido
not intend to do so —upon a subject of this character ;
but when we find persons endeavouring to awaken
animosity in the public mind against the work of the
Convention, who give no reason for what they are
doing, who cannot, apparently from some defect in
their intellectual structure, state any case with ac-
curacy, we may well, I think, state how ill-founded
their accusations are, and may well be pardoned for
stating the naked truth. I think I have exhausted
the category of anathemas hurled at us by certain
people out of doors. I think I have pointed out that
in every case these vituperative attacks are based either
upon ignorance or upon a wilful misrepresentation of
the real facts. We have arrived now at the finish of
this bill, in which I think every delegate may justi-
fiably take a clear pride. This bill, I have no doubt
whatever, will be ratified by the people of these col-
onies. I have no doubt whatever in my mind that
the large colonies will ratify this bill. I see nothing
in it which can possibly germinate into a valid ground
for withdrawing the popular assent from its pro-
visions. I see as much as we could possibly expect in
the measure to commend it to the approval of nearly
all classes of the people in these free states. I offer
these observations on the motion for the adoption of
this report, because it appears to me the proper
time. Looking to the future from the point at
which we have now arrived, I feel that I only state
the plain truth in stating that this bill, for the pre-
paration of which my hon. friend. Sir Samuel Griffith,
deserves so much praise, will be a document re-
membered as long as Australia and the English
language endure. That is a bold expression,' but
not an extravagant one. The colonies must federate,
or, in other words, they must come together,
and be one some day or other. I will assume for
a moment that that day has not arrived now. If
that be the case, it cannot be far off ; and when-
ever the time comes this admirably drawn bill,
so clear, so instinct with the true spirit of well-
ordered liberty, so instinct with a true appreciation
of stable and sober laws, so pervaded by the very
spirit of toleration and mutual consideration—that
come whenever that day may. this bill must be in the
foundation of the edifice of federal liberty, It can
never be forgotten, it can never be depreciated, it can
never be made less than it is to-day ; and supposing
another constitution should be framed by other men,
to a very large extent the provisions of this bill must
be embodied in that constitution, so that this Con-
vention has breathed into this bill the breath of an
immortal life. As long as these colonies exist, as
long as the language we speak exists, this will be one
of the great foundation stones in raising towards
heaven the temple of the nation's liberties. We may
well then be satisfied. I must say my own attendance
here has been somewhat exacting. I think the atten-
dance of my hon. friends, the delegates from Queens-
land, must have been equally so. All must have made
great sacrifices; but we may well be satisfied with
what we have done. Under any circumstances, no
body of men could have done much more, and I, for
one, do not think that misrepresentation will have
much power in diverting the attention of the public
from the true merits of our labours. I support the
motion for the adoption of this report with every
possible feeling of concurrence. 1 have no doubt the
motion will be carried unanimously, and I have no
doubt whatever that our approval will be re-echoed
by the best portions of the population of all these


coloniea. Our labours, under our commissions, are
so far at an end. But some of us will have to figbt
the battle of the bill in the parliaments, and before
the peoples of these countries. I shall enter upon
that task with a light heart, and a conscience that tells
me we have done well, that we have done our best, that
we have not been diverted by any inferior object, and
that, almost without exception, we have engaged in
our work with a wholeness of soul and the exercise
of our best thoughts. The result of our labours, I
say unhesitatingly, will be generally approved by all
the most thoughtful of the population, by all those
in fact who are most competent to form an opinion
on so difficult, so complex, and so hazardous a labour
as ours has been. I give my support to the motion
of the hon. member, Sir Samuel Griffith, and I have
no doubt whatever that the support I give will fairly
represent the support the bill will receive from the
people of this country.
Mr. MUNRO : 1 do not think it is necessary for
me to say much on the present occasion. In fact,
the time has now arrived when we must be departing
for our colonies, the work we undertook having been
completed. I quite agree with the hon. member,
Sir Henry Parkes, that, under all the circumstances,
we ought to be satisfied with the work that has been
done. Personally, I must say that the present posi-
tion of affairs is altogether better than that I expected
to see about ten days ago. Coming together, as we
did, from the various colonies, under a mandate from
our parliaments, to frame a constitution, each of us
coming with life-long convictions, and with a deter-
mination to do what we could to make the constitu-
tion the best one possible, of course it was to be
expected that there should be a large amount of
difference of opinion, and that our opinions should
be very strongly expressed. But I am happy to say,
with you, sir, that while that was the case there was
little or no personal misunderstanding amongst us.
J, for one, feel that it is a high honor to have
a member of this Convention. I shall feel, for
the -rest of my life, the pleasure of having met
the hon. gentlemen sent here as representatives of
the various parliaments on an occasion like this, to
exchange views and consider this great question. To
all of us, I think, that is a pleasure we shall not
forget. Of course we knew a number of these hon.
gentlemen by name from the important positions
which they occupy in their various colonies, but we
have now met face to face, and I, who have expressed
my views as strongly as anyone as to what the con-
stitution should be, feel that each one who has
addressed the Convention, from the first day until
now, has done so with an honest intention to get the
best constitution possible for the various colonies.
Some have differed very materially from me in their
views, but I am bound to acknowledge that they felt
as strongly as I did that their own views should be
given effect to. We feel, of course, that in the bill
before us none, perhaps, has obtained all he would
like to get, and it may be that we would all like to
get a great deal. I quite agree with you, sir, that
the best thanks of this Convention are due to the
gentleman who drafted the bill, and who managed in
such an excellent manner to put the various compro-
mises in such words that we could easily understand
what they meant, and so that we could feel that
justice had been done to all of us. I was very glad
indeed to hear you refer to the fact that I was among
the first to give in my adhesion to your views when
you announced that we must have a federal parlia-
ment. I remember the circumstances very well. I
had the honor of meeting the late Governor of New
South Wales, Lord Carrington. He felt very
strongly with regard to this matter, and he asked
me what my views were. I told him that he
could convey to the hon. member, Sir Henry Parkes,
my congratulations on the position he was taking
up, and that I believed as far as Victoria was
concerned we should assist to the best of our
ability in carrying out federation. I then had to
address my constituents, and of course gave expres-
sion to my views in that direction. lam sure we all
feel, as you, sir, feel, that our work is not finished;
that it is practically only begun. AVe have now a
constitution of which we may well be proud, but we
have to go back to the various colonies and con-
stituencies and put the question before them. Ido
trust and hope that the aspirations, especially of the
rising generation of Australians, for a united Aus-
tralia will be given effect to under this constitution.
I hope that the little difficulties of adjustment that
may arise at the initiation of this constitution will
not prevent any of the colonies from joining. I
know, for instance, that our friend from New Zea-
land, the hon. member, Sir George Grey, feels
greatly disappointed because we did not depart from
our instructions so far as to insist upon an alteration
of the constitutions of the various colonies.
Sir GEORGE GBEY : What instructions ?
Mr. MUNRO : Our instructions were to frame a
constitution for the Australian colonies that would
be just to all the colonies ; and I venture to say
that no man would assert that it would be just to
the colonies for us to insist here upon an alteration
of their electoral system before we framed a consti-
tution. I venture to say that gentlemen who repre-
sent the various constituencies in the colonies have
a perfect right to exercise their own judgment with a
view to carrying out the views of their constituents,
and we have no right to interfere with them in that
direction. I am thoroughly with the hon. gentle-
man in his views on the question of one man one
vote, and believe that principle should be given effect
to in our laws. But that is not our business here.
It is not our business to interfere with local legis-
lation. We must allow the various colonies to do
what they think fit in that direction. I trust that the
result of the debates here will be to incite all of us in
the various colonies to see that that principle shall
be carried into effect at the earliest date possible; but
to have any dispute on that point now would be
entirely out of place, because this is not the arena for
it. We came here for a very different purpose, and
I feel that we have done good work. Of course we
are told that we have given away the rights and
privileges of the people. ■ I feel, on the contrary, that
we have enlarged all the privileges of the people —
that we have enlarged the scope of the enterprise of
all the colonies. AVe shall have opened the country
from one end to the other to every man in it as soon
as this constitution shall have been adopted, so that
we shall all form one people. I shall not feel, for
instance, in voting for representatives to the federal
parliament, that my power is limited by the Murray
on the one side and the sea on the other. I shall feel
that the power of that vote extends to Carpentaria in
one direction, and, if Western Australia joins us, to
Ereemantlc in the other. If that be so, surely, instead
of giving away our rights and privileges, we are
enlarging them. AVe are enabling our friends in
Western Australia, who are at present cooped up in
one-third of the continent to vote in such a manner
that their power will extend from one shore of Aus-
tralia to the other, and enabling them to feel that
instead of being part of a small colony they are part
of a powerful commmonwealth, of which we may well
be proud. I have great pleasure in supporting the
adoption of the report.
Mr. HE A KIN : While I do not desire to detain
the Convention, it yet appears possible to add one or
two words of a general nature upon the final stage
which we have now reached. It is rather too early
for us to separate ourselves from our work and its
details so as to be able to regard it dispassionately as
a whole. The task on which we have been engaged
for the last six weeks has been onerous and arduous
to an almost unparalleled degree. Critics who look to


the record of our debates, admirably rendered as
they have been by the Hansard staff of this colony,
will not derive even from that excellent statement a
full view of all the circumstances which have been
operating upon the minds of hon. members. Thore
is much unstated in that record, because the delegates
to this Convention have practically lived together for
six weeks in private as well as in public intercourse,
and from the natural action and reaction of mind
upon mind have been gradually shaping their
thoughts upon this great question. The bill which
we present is the result of a far more intricate,
intellectual process than is exhibited in our debates;
unless the atmosphere in which we have lived as well
as worked is taken into consideration, the measure as
it stands will not be fully understood. And now the
hour has struck for our departure, and the work, so
far as we can shape it, is about to leave our hands.
The time for construction has passed, and the time
for criticism .has begun. So far from presenting
ourselves as a phalanx resisting criticism from the
public outside, we have courted it from the outset.
Every important step, and every practical step in
shaping the constitution has been taken in the
full light of day. We send it to the people of
Australia, not only informing them of the reasons
in favour of the particular provisions we have
adopted, but with information contained in the
record of all the reasons that could be urged
against them. If there are enemies of federation,
if there are hostile critics, I undertake to say that
none of them will be able to present arguments
against these proposals which may not be found in
some form already embodied in our debates. We
come before the public, not in an attitude of resistance,
but of confidence. The whole process of constitution-
making has, as far as possible, taken place under
their eyes, and they will form their judgment on the
whole of the facts. Those who turn to the pages of
this Hansard , recollecting the report of the meeting
held in Melbourne twelve months ago, will surely be
struck by one important circumstance, and that is
the immense distance which has been travelled since
the Conference of 1890. A reader of the speeches
delivered on that occasion must be struck by their
obvious and their necessary generality. Eederation
was then in the air, and only in the air ; even after
the conference it still remained to a large extent with
but a phantasmal existence. To-day it has taken
form, and shape, and substance. It is reduced to
type ; and one form of federation, at all events, is
presented for the criticism of the whole continent.
Every member who was present at that Melbourne
Conference, with the solitary exception of Sir John
Hall, an able representative of New Zealand, is a
member of this present Convention. One other,
whose presence we were fortunate enough to enjoy
at both meetings, whose ability we all appreciated,
and whose upright public spirit we all revered, the
late Mr. Macrossan, has been unfortunately taken
from us during our proceedings. But, with one
exception, the whole of the members who took
part in the Melbourne Conference have joined in
this Convention, and although they may be sup-
posed to have exercised a natural influence on the
course of the debates, yet the actual product—the
actual result of the practical working of this Con-
vention is something very different from what even
the wisest of those persons dreamed of twelve months
ago. You, sir—and who more competent to pass a
judgment? —have said that the celerity with which
this movement has advanced has taken even you by
surprise, and those who feel called upon for historical
and political purposes to gauge it by its public records
will re-echo and reiterate your verdict when they
compare the excellent but shadowy work done by
that conference twelve months ago with the solid
practical outcome which we are presenting to-day. I
take it that we may remit this bill to our constituents
with some confidence, since it is a natural outgrowth
of the constitutions already existing in Australia,
of which we ourselves have had experience, striking
its roots back to that British Constitution from
which the free institutions of our race have sprung.
It does not present the same features as the con-
stitution of the mother country, nor yet is it
identical, by any means, with any single constitution
which can be found in Australia; but it ought to be
a source of confidence to note that it has proceeded
on the same well-grounded lines and well-proved
methods which have received the sanction of our
people in all these colonies. This constitution will not
present itself to them as something strange, foreign,
or abnormal; but as something which their own
experience will have prepared them to understand and
appreciate. The work of our hands, although it will
bear traces of the study of the constitutions of the
United States and of Canada, and of constitutions
even more remote, is yet distinctly an Anglo-Saxon,
saturated through and through with the spirit and
confidence of self-government, which has been char-
acteristic of the race. This may encourage us to hope
that our constituents will extend to it the same con-
sideration which they require to give to all political
expedients. They willnot have expected as the outcome
of our deliberations a scheme which any particular
section or party would consider perfect; without
deifying compromise, they should admit that the very
fashion in which it has been shaped offers one of the
best guarantees for its futuro harmonious working.
If those who occupy the proud position of repre-
senting the people of Australia under this new
constitution, meet and deliberate on the many diffi-
culties left for their solution, and to which we have
only opened the doors, in that same spirit of modera-
tion which has been exhibited in these discussions—
with the same tolerance, fair-mindedness, and anxious
disposition to arrive at a reasonable compromise—
and surely we are entitled to expect more rather than
less from them—then the people of these colonies
need feel no hesitation whatever in setting their seal
to the draft bill which we have had the honor of
preparing. Without entering upon details, which
have been sufficiently dealt with for practical pur-
poses during the debate, let me add that for my own
part I should have preferred to see the second
chamber no antithesis of the first in any respect, but
simply a body for the securing of that permanence
and stability which are necessary for good govern-
ment, gifted with authority to discuss and powers to
delay sufficient to make it certain that no popular
measure could find its way to the statute-book unless
it were proved to have have been well reasoned upon
and approved of by the people in the maturity of their
judgment. Though I should have preferred to see
the upper chamber more strictly limited to functions
of that kind, yet I cannot conceal from myself the
fact that it will be elected by select constituencies—
constituencies which will keep the central govern-
ment in touch with the local governments of the
various states, and which should produce harmony
between the working of the state parliaments and
the central parliament. A body of this dignity,
and charged with such important functions, may
reasonably be awarded a higher position than that
of the upper house of any single colony. I should
have preferred to see the fiscal question dealt with
in a different fashion; not by way of imposing any
policy on the future parliament of Australia —I am
perfectly satisfied as to what that policy will be—
but by way of giving confidence to those who have
invested capital in our manufacturing industries.
Although I should have preferred this, yet my confi-
dence is unabated in the ultimate result of the fiscal
liberty conferred. I do not believe that there is any
real danger to protection from that source. What
I desired to do was to allay the fears—not altogether
unreasonable, if not sufficiently well founded —of


those who look forward with apprehension to the
passing of a uniform tariff, possibly a lower tariff
than that at present in force in some colony upon
some articles. And, finally, on the question of the
amendment of the constitution, it appears to me that
the proposition which I think the hon. and learned
member, Sir Samuel Griffith, had in his mind when
he spoke of preparing amendments of the constitu-
tion by conventions —the practice which obtains in
the separate states of the American Union, where
the question of the amendment of the constitution
is remitted to conventions, and the several amend-
ments prepared by them are then submitted to a
direct vote of the electors. That would, in my
opinion, have been a more satisfactory manner of
providing for future changes of the constitution than
that which has found its place in the bill, and which
bears a closer analogy to the provisions in the Consti-
tution Act of the United States Central Government.
These are, however, comparatively minor points, and
I think we should all be prepared to defend this
constitution before our constituents on the ground
that in its spirit, its form, and its character it is
thoroughly liberal and thoroughly democratic. The
hon. member who appeared to fear the electoral pro-
visions of this constitution most, the hon. member
from New Zealand, Sir George Grey, has, I feel
sure, not yet sufficiently acquainted himself with the
accurate facts with regard to plural voting and its
influence in these colonies. Neither in this colony
nor in Victoria does the influence of that vote exist
to the extent which he supposes. lam confident
that in our own colony, out of its ninety-five seats,
not more than ten seats are materially affected by
plural votes. For all that, I am cordially and
thoroughly at one with the hon. gentleman in his
opposition to the principle and practice. The Vic-
torian Assembly has already passed a measure for
the abolition of the system. That measure forms part
of the government programme for next session. I
believe it stands an equal chance of being adopted in
the great colony in which we now are. Consequently,
the probability is that in the two most populous
colonies of Australia the principle of " one man one
vote" will be established at a very early date—long,
I trust, before the foundation of this constitution.
That being so, I fancy that the fears to which the
hon. member, Sir George Grey, has given expression
in many ways in regard to this subject are not well
founded. South Australia and New Zealand have
already adopted the principle, and I believe that
New South Wales and Victoria, if not Queensland
as well, are on the eve of adopting it. The bill as it
stands does not embody all that some of us desired in
the matter of powers. In the Constitutional Com-
mittee it was contended that under the heading of
statistics there was sufficient authority to establish
an agricultural department, such as exists in the
United States ; and it was thought premature at this
stage to endeavour to take any federal step in the all
important question of water supply, or in the equally
important subject of the consolidation of the debts
of the colonies. It was thought inadvisable to
attempt to make any movement in these directions,
although there are, I believe, a large majority of the
members present who trust and believe that in the
early future the federal parliament will see its way,
with the consent of all the colonies, to add these to
the list of powers which this constitution confers.
It might be possible, were it necessary, to attempt
to answer by anticipation some of the contentions
which are certain to be urged against this bill by the
opponents of federation. That is a task to which
we shall probably have many opportunities of addres-
sing ourselves in other places. It may reasonably
be said, however, that imperfect as this measure is,
it contains within itself the essential principles of
popular government; it contains within itself the
power which will permit the people to modify and
shape it in accordance with their future needs ; it
provides for that free and full discussion of public
affairs, that reasonable consideration of them by the
public at large, and that close criticism of them by
the chambers charged with that special duty, which
is the best guarantee for the passing of wise laws.
Those who oppose it, disparage, in the first instance,
their own people, and in the second instance the
people of the neighbouring colonies. They disparage
their own people if they fear that meeting on a
fair and equal field, and, appealing to the judg-
ment and reason of the whole commonwealth,
they will not be able to securefor their state
all the just consideration Avhich is its due in
every matter in which its interests are affected.
They disparage themselves in the first instance if
they put forward any such plea of personal feeble-
ness, and they also disparage the people of the
neighbouring colonies if they contend that they are
not equally fitted with themselves to enter into the
discharge of the duties devolving upon the citizens
of a free commonwealth. What is the fact at the
present time with regard to the political condition of
these colonies, entirely independent, as they have
been, of one another ? Is it not manifest and re-
markable, that though each colony has been left to
follow it own course, without any regard to its neigh-
bours, the laws of all are governed by exactly the same
principles ? One of the most familiar features of col-
onial politics is that any law which has been passed by
one colony is almost immediately afterwards adopted
by its neighbours, if it is found to be successful in
its working ; and the consequence of this has been
that though some may have been quicker and some
slower, every colony has advanced upon the same road.
Their institutions have been shaped in the same
spirit, and in the same direction. Taking statute-
book by statute-book, and comparing one with the
other, the differences sink -into insignificance, while
the main general features of likeness assert them-
selves on every page. Do we need a stronger
demonstration than this of the natural unity of the
people of Australia with regard to all the political
questions which have agitated them in the past, and
are agitating them in the present; and do we need a
better guarantee than this for those who apparently
fear that the instant they step outside the ring-fence
of their own colony they will be committing the des-
tinies of their people to alien races, with other aspi-
rations and other ideals ? On the contrary, to pass the
artificial boundary of one colony and enter another,
involvesno changein the political atmosphere. Theone
has just the same quality as the other, and one finds
among the people across the border identical aims, and
even identical means employed to gain them. I
trust that these considerations will be sufficiently
obvious to commend themselves to the electors of
this country, whose judgment, in the first instance
sought through their parliaments, and then directly
will ultimately decide the fate of this bill. Let them
note that this constitution has been framed in no
spirit of haggling; that it was impossible to measure
the territory of one by the territory of another inch
to inch ; that it was impossible to gauge the possibi-
lities of one against the possibilities of another to an
ounce ; that it was a matter of practical impossibility
to obtain a division of the financial responsibilities
to a penny or a farthing. What has been done has
been to secure substantial justice for all the col-
onies of Australasia. It will not be by any con-
sideration of bargain and sale, or purchase and ar-
rangement, that the people of this country will be
governed. On the contrary, I believe they will rise
to the height of this great crisis. They will see in
this proposal for union the first pulse-beat of their
national life. They will behold in it possibilities which
even the most sanguine will not dare to pourtray.
They will realise that if this is not the best of all pos-
sible constitutions it is the best that can be framed and


accepted at the present time. They will admit that it
has been wrought by representative men of all the
colonies in a spirit of equity, with all the ability and in
the light of all the experience they possess, and they
will rely with confidence upon its results. They will
feel that the national spirit can now embody itself in
this commonwealth in a higher, a broader, and a
nobler form than has ever been possible in the past.
They will welcome it as an enlargement of their poli-
tical, their social, and their commercial life, as a gift
of new ideals, and will recognise that by taking this
first step upon the path of national development
they have entered upon a new career, which pro-
mises much in the future, in addition to what may
be achieved individually by the still powerful states
within their own borders. Let them estimate how
rich the harvest of union may be by recalling the
fruits of their independent exertions in the past.
Sir JOHN DOWNER: It would seem rather a
graceless and unthankful thing to introduce into an
atmosphere of such perfect harmony even one single
note of discord; but, while I intend to support the
motion now before the Convention, and in the future
to do all I can to assist tho cause of Australian
federation, I fear now, as I feared during the time
the bill was in Committee, that we have not in every
instance adopted the best method, that we have not
risen to that lofty sphere from which the hon. mem-
ber, Mr. Deakin, addressed us just now ; but that we
have voluntarily, with our eyes wide open and under-
standing exactly the difficulties we were creating,
introduced propositions into our new constitution
which, up to the present time, have created much
misunderstanding, and must inevitably in the future
produce discord. The two great questions which
were so much considered and discussed in Committee
were the questions as to the position of the individual
states and the fiscal question. As to the first, I can
only say that having listened most attentively to all
that has been said by the hon. gentlemen who advo-
cate the bill as its stands at present, and having had
the advantage of constant private intercourse with
them, and so of hearing both publicly and privately the
arguments in support of their contentions, I still say
unhesitatingly that the clauses referring to what have
been called the state rights are distinctly intended and
understood by one portion of the Convention in one
direction, and as distinctly intended and understood
by another portion of the Convention in another
direction ; and I say that it is not a good thing to
begin that which ought above all to be founded on
perfect good faith and perfect mutual understanding
with the introduction of a system which we know
perfectly well is differently interpreted by different
minds, and which we know equally well is intended
to be worked out differently by different members of
the Convention. If, as the hon. member, Mr.
Deakin, says, the larger colonies who supported the
view which is contained in the bill as it now stands
do understand that the senate, selected so carefully,
exalted so greatly, is, apart from the question of the
numbers of the people who elect it, or of its members,
to have a lofty position equal to the other branch of
the legislature—if that is the general understanding,
whatever the words may be, I care very little, because
there can be no doubt that the interpretation of the
constitution will be governed at least as much by the
general understanding of its meaning as by the
precise words in which that meaning is expressed. I
do not think that it is possible that the constitution
is after all sufficiently elastic to enable the senate to
be all that, personally, I would desire it to be, and to
exercise all the authority I would desire it to exercise;
but, unfortunately, the words used are sufficiently
elastic to be interpreted by one portion of the Con-
vention in one way, and by the other portion in
another direction. I sincerely hope that no trouble
may come out of this. The difficulty which we have
was met by a commonwealth which has stood th
test of time, and their compromise we might, I think,
have well adopted in this instance. As to the fiscal
question, there again I fancy, if I may be allowed to
say so, provincialism was not displayed upon our
side. It was displayed rather on the side of some of
the larger colonies, and it will not be a good beginning
to a perfect system of federation between the colonies
for the destruction of customs-houses, to make all
Australians, whatever the colony to which they may
belong, really the people of one country, and to
provide against the necessary watchfulness and
sometimes conflict that I think must happen between
the states in properly safeguarding their own indi-
vidual interests. lam sorry to obtrude these con-
siderations at this stage of the Convention. Although
disagreeing with much that has been said, and having
serious fears as to the difficulties which may arise
from some of the provisions of the bill, I intend to
support the motion, and no doubt I shall be found in
the future, as in the past, a consistent advocate for
everything which may ultimately result in the union
of Australia.
Mr. BAKER: I wish to say as little as possible
on this occasion, because the strong feelings that
have been engendered by debate and collision may
perhaps lead me to take a view which, on calmer
consideration, I should not take. I would, however,
like to put it on record that I express no opinion at
the present time, but hold myself open upon calmer
consideration of the provisions of the bill to take
such action as it appears to me the interests of the
people of Australia and South Australia should
induce me to take. Ido not wish to discuss, and I
shall not discuss, the matters which have been
brought forward by the hon. member, Mr. Deakin ;
but I wish to put upon record the position which I
now take, because I am afraid that unless I do so, if
I afterwards come to the conclusion, which I hope I
shall not come to, that it is not my duty to advocate
this constitution, I shall be placing myself in a false
position.
Dr. COCKBURN: I join with the hon. gentlemen
who have already spoken in my appreciation of the
way in which the work of the Convention has been
done, reflecting as it does great credit upon those
responsible for its management. No doubt the bill
represents the will of a large majority of the Con-
vention, though, as one who has pretty generally been
found voting with a minority, I cannot join in
approval of all its provisions. On the other hand,
I recognise that it has very valuable features, though
I fear that it has also very great faults. It appears
to me to tend more to unification than to federation,
and, to a great extent, to be founded on a distrust of
the popular will. However, I can only say that I
hope a calm and dispassionate view of the whole of
the events may lead me to the conclusion that these
flaws may not be of so vital a nature as at present I
am bound to regard them. •
Mr. J. EORREST : I should like to congratulate
the Convention, and also you, Mr. President, upon
the result of our labours. Although this draft bill
may not meet with the approval of all of us —in fact,
some portions of it have been carried by very narrow
majorities, when, I believe, the result would have
been the reverse in some important instances had all
the members of the Convention been present —still, I
feel that it is a very valuable production, and one
that cannot but be of great benefit to those who are
to consider this question; and it seems to me that
a fair result has been obtained. I quite agree with
you, sir, that- the federation of these colonies must
come sooner or later, and the question arises in my
mind whether this is the most favourable time, or
whether some future time would not be more favour-
able. I unhesitatingly say that, so far as I
can judge, the difficulties which surround the
question now will not be less as time goes on ;
and therefore, if any one is of opinion that the


federation of the colonies is necessary, I am
convinced that no more appropriate time can be
chosen for it than the present, because, as the colonies
grow larger, and as our interests become more diverse,
the difficulties now existing will be increased many
fold, and no more opportune or convenient time will
be found in the future than in the present. Our
work is about completed. It will be for the people
of the different portions of Australia to say whether
they will accept or reject the constitution which has
been framed. It will be my duty to place the bill
before the people of the colony I represent in its
proper and true light. It will be my duty, and the
duty of those associated with me, to explain the
features of the bill to the people of Western Aus-
tralia. It is not for me, at the present time, to say
what their decision may be. As far as I can judge,
the terms of the bill are, to the larger colonies, which
are connected by several means of communication,
and especially of railway communication, sufficiently
good. Even if the bill does not meet with their
entire approval, the conditions laid down in it are
sufficiently fair and just to those colonies to enable
them to federate. As far as I am able to judge, the
colony which I have the honor to represent seems to
be in the worst position, the principal reason for this
being that we have no means of communication with
the other great colonies. Before we can have com-
munication, excepting by sea, with any part of these
colonies, 1,500 miles of railway will have to be con-
structed over a country at present uninhabited.
Mr. Mukeo ; Federation would hasten that!
Mr. J. FOEEEST: The one great obstacle which
I see in the way of our joining the federation, the
one great obstacle which it will be difficult for us to
overcome when we place the matter before the people
of Western Australia, will, 1 hope, soon be re-
moved. I sincerely congratulate the Convention on
the result of our labours; and I especially thank
those gentlemen who have given so much time to the
preparation of the bill. Foremost amongst them I
must mention the name of the hon. member, Sir
Samuel Griffith. I feel sure that without his assis-
tance, and the able and willing assistance of other
legal gentlemen, we should not have been in the posi-
tion in which we find ourselves to-day, of having
passed the bill through the Convention. I also de-
sire, before concluding, to thank you, Mr. President,
and the hon. member, Mr. McMillan, and the Go-
vernment of New South Wales, for the extreme hos-
pitality and kindness which have been extended to us
during the Convention. Although our labours have
been arduous, and we have had a great deal to do, and
have been kept very closely at work, they have been
very much lightened by the great hospitality and
kindness which we have received from you and mem-
bers of your Government, and in fact, from all the
people with whom we have come in contact in New
South Wales.
Sir THOMAS McILWEAITH : I have no inten-
tion of adding to the very eloquent perorations which
have been made upon our month’s work by the
different speakers who have preceded me; but I
should feel myself to be ungrateful if I sat down
without expressing my gratitude to one hon. member
who has been of immense benefit to myself. I men-
tion him now, because his labour commenced long
before ours in the Convention —I mean the hon.
member, Mr. Baker. I am glad to hear, from the
manner in which my remarks have been received,
that hon. members of the Convention so cordially
agree with me.
Mr. PLAYFOED : I think that all that is neces-
sary to be said on the present occasion as to the
quality of the work that we have turned out has been
said by the President. As we have all been more or less
engaged in the perfecting of this measure, it seems
very much like self-praise on our part to compliment
ourselves upon our labours. The work we have
accomplished will have to he criticised by the people
outside. They will very possibly look at it with
different eyes to ours, and we shall have to meet
their criticisms when the proper time arrives, and
defend our work in the best way we can. One
thing which I trust will be brought about through-
out the colonies in connection with federation is this:
that the question of federation will not be put before
the people mixed up with party politics.
Mr. Dibbs: It certainly will in New Sout^ 1
Wales!
Mr. PLATFOED: I trust that we shall en-
deavour to separate it distinctly from party politics.
I can say for the opposition in South Australia, and
for the ministry and their supporters, that that is
what we intend to do. We intend to keep the
question of federation altogether distinct and sepa-
rate from questions of party politics ; and I am sure
we shall find in South Australia, when the question
is remitted to the people for decision, ministerial
supporters taking one side, and opposition sup-
porters taking another, in certain cases, and vice
versa , we shall find them acting not in accord so far
as party politics are concerned. I may say, person-
ally, that, taken as a whole, although the constitution
does not meet with my approval in a great many
particulars, I look upon it as one to which we can
fairly ask the people of South Australia to agree.
It must necessarily be a compromise. We have
had to compromise on many points; but,
taking the bill as a whole, I shall only be
too pleased to do all I possibly can to get the
people of South Australia to agree to it, because
we have made provision that if it is the wish of the
majority of the people of the colonies to alter the
constitution in any one particular, it can be so altered
with considerable facility. There is only one other point
to which I wish to allude, and that has been alluded to
by the leader of the Opposition in South Australia, the
hon. member, Sir John Downer. The hon. member has
not expressed himself definitely as to whether he will
be able to agree to recommend this constitution to
the people of South Australia, because of that one
point in particular. I hope the hon. member will
consider the matter again, and I trust that when ho
does make up his mind he will be found agreeing to
recommend the adoption of the bill to the people of
the colony. The point to which the hon. gentleman
alluded was the one upon which we arrived at —a
compromise in regard to the powers of the senate.
I w r ould say to him that, considering the compromise
which was arrived at was the compromise which was
arrived at in South Australia over twenty years ago,
between the Legislative Council of that colony and
the House of Assembly, and that that compromise
has worked so exceedingly well for that period, we,
in making the compromise contained in the bill, have
not departed from any powers we possess ; that is, we
have not gone outside the colonies to adopt a mode
by which we may get over the difficulties of'co-ordi-
nate powers between the two houses. We have,
however, adopted a system which has been in opera-
tion in one of the colonies for many years, with very
happy results. Therefore we have just as much
right to say that by adopting the South Australian
compromise, which has worked so well for so many
years, we have adopted a compromise which will work
well for the commonwealth of the future, as we have
to say that if we had adopted the American system,
which I contend exists under different conditions
and apart from responsible government, it also would
have worked well. I do not know that I need say
anything more on the subject. I only trust that it
will be found that within the next four or five years
at the outside the federation of the colonies, either
on the basis that we have laid down here, or on a
somewhat similar one, will become the law of the
land for all Australia.


Mr. RUTLEDGE: In rising to support the adop-
tion of the report, I do not think that many words
are necessary. You, sir, in the address with which
you favoured the Convention this morning, gave
expression to the feelings that were uppermost in
my own mind, and it would be an impertinence on
my part if I were to attempt, in my humble way, to
repeat the sentiments to which you have given such
happy expression. I think, sir, that the introduction
of matters of detail into the discussion that is now
going on is rather unfortunate, and I hope that, on
this, the last day on which we are to assemble to-
gether, we shall have as few references as possible
to the matters which have separated us in opinion
during the time we have been together. I am sure
that, as men, we are separating with feelings of high
mutual regard. As has already been said by one
hon. gentleman, most of us have been familiar with
each other's name and reputation for a long time;
but we have lacked the inestimable advantage of
personal acquaintance with the men with whose
names and doings we have so long been familiar.
I confess, for my part, that I have undergone a
process of education whilst I have been in the Con-
vention. I came here with my ideas pretty rigidly
formed on certain subjects; but I have found that,
whilst my mind has been operated upon by the
influence of superior minds around me, I have been
forced to modify some of the views which I have
heretofore held. I came here, for example, as a
strong advocate of state rights, of which my hon.
friends, Mr. Baker and Sir John Downer, are such able
exponents; but, whilst I have been here, I have come
to see that in order to accomplish the great object
which we all have in view it is indispensable that
some of those views on the subject of state rights
should be modified. Ido not think that we are
chargeable with adopting any unworthy compromise
in what we have done. I recognise the fact that we
are here as reasonable men. We are, as jar as
possible, bound to respect the views which each holds
on questions on which men may be expected to hold
different opinions. I have, from the first, recognised
the fact that without the inclusion of New South
Wales and Victoria the federation of these colonies
would be a gigantic farce. I have also recognised
that without a modification of some of the views that
I held on the subject of state rights it would be
impossible for those colonies to become members of
the federation ; and I have, therefore, not only felt
the force of the position in which I have found
myself under these circumstances, but, by the force
of the arguments which have been employed in
support of the position taken up by those large
colonies, I have also felt myself compelled to ac-
knowledge that, to a certain extent, the views which
[ held ought to be very considerably modified. I
think that we ought, as far as possible, to separate
now with the feeling that in this Convention we have
set an example which we may well hope the consti-
tuencies throughout Australia will follow. Those
to w r hom we shall have to appeal for the ratifi-
cation [of our work are men with divergent views,
such as we ourselves have entertained ; but, inas-
much as we in our position here have endeavoured
to meet each other's views in a spirit of compro-
mise, and in a true federal spirit, so we have set an
example which we may hope those to whom we
shall have to address ourselves hereafter will follow ;
and I am quite sure that, by reason of the example
which we have endeavoured to set in this respect,
we shall ensure the adoption of this constitution
throughout these colonies by immense majorities
everywhere. I was glad, sir, to hear what you so
well said with regard to the document which now
embodies the constitution of Australia. I have mar-
velled at that document. When I remember that
only a few days were at the disposal of the gentle-
men to whom was assigned the important duty of
preparing that document, I am constrained to ask
myself which I admire most —the skill with which
the work has been done, or the immense industry
expended, in so short a time, in producing such a
document. It is a document of which we all may well
be proud, and I am quite sure that we are proud of
it. I depart with feelings of gratitude to the people
of New South Wales for the admirable manner in
wdiich they have treated us while we have been here,
with feelings of admiration for all those who have
been associated with me in this Convention, and for
the manner in which the gentlemen upon whom has
devolved the responsible duty of reporting our pro-
ceedings have done their work. I leave with the
belief that I shall be a better man, and that my colony
will derive some advantage from the benefit which I
have received by my association with the eminent
men who have formed this Convention,
Sir GrEORGE GREY: Sir, I cannot but join
cordially in the opinions expressed by every bon.
member as to the manner in which this constitution
has been prepared, and I say that we owe the hon.
and learned member, Sir Samuel Griffith, a debt of
deep gratitude. He was courteous to all; he was as
industrious as a man could possibly be ; he was as free
to acknowledge any mistake that he had made in a
proposal offered as the most innocent child could have
been—so fairly, so freely, did he at once say, “ I am
•wrong, I see it.” I saw in him qualities which would
adorn any statesman, and I formed the highest
possible opinion of what he will ultimately attain to
in Australasia, To the hon. and learned member,
Mr, Clark, the Attorney-General of Tasmania, we
also ow’e a very great debt of gratitude. lie was
equally industrious, equally patient, equally skilled
almost in law I will say, and I felt that throughout
to those two hon. gentlemen we were very greatly and
deeply indebted. Now, upon this bill itself it is not
necessary for me to say very much. I cannot help
feeling that it has partly been wrongly put before
us to-day. Everybody who differed from the bill has
been found to be wanting in some qualities —some-
times in temper, sometimes in justice, sometimes they
were of a very quarrelsome disposition, and must
differ from everything; then, it was perfectly plain
that there was no ground whatever for differing from
this measure, which was perfect in itself —as perfect
as a measure could be—and that nobody but the
most unreasonable person could join in denouncing
it in any way. There was one great mistake through-
out all those arguments. We were ordered to pre-
pare a federal constitution for Australasia, and in
my belief we were bound to prepare one which should
have been a model to the world, in which the liberty
of our fellow men should, in every respect, have been
fairly established ; but nothing of the kind has been
done in this constitution. I say, in no instance that
I can recollect has so powerful a party in one body
supported unanimously that which I believe to be
wrong. I sincerely believe that they believe it to be
right. I cannot help thinking they were hardened
in this course on account of their having so long
enjoyed powers which I think they ought never
to have possessed. The human mind becomes
under such circumstances accustomed to that which
is wrong, and becomes right. 1 differ
altogether from hon. gentlemen as they have
spoken to-day on the subject of the plural vote.
The hon. member, Mr. Heakin, tells us, or announces
to the world, that 1 am much mistaken in attributing
to that circumstance such power as I do, and he says
he believes that in the case of Victoria only ten seats
out of ninety are much influenced by the vote.
Mr. FitzGerald : Influenced at all!
Sir GEORGE GREY: “Influenced at all!” I
think that he did not say that.
Mr. FitzGerald : It is perfectly true, though !
Sir GEORGE GREY : A single double vote would
exercise some influence. The hon. member w T ould


never have spoken in so loose a manner as that—l
do not recollect him saying it; but he said that only
ten out of ninety were so influenced. Well, that
means an immense number, and it becomes a very
serious matter indeed. But not only that : there is a
certain degradation to human beings who are obliged
to submit to such a system. When plural voting
was very prevalent in Hew Zealand, I felt debased;
I felt that I was not in a proper position in the
country. I looked with pity on little children rising
up, as I believed, to be placed under such a system
in which persons who had secured wealth in any
manner whatever were to exercise so great an
influence, and that no virtue, no goodness, unless
they were wealthy, could secyre them anything but
the single vote given as the common suffrage of the
country. Hon. gentlemen who surround me are
nearly every one accustomed to this system. Every
one of them for years has been practising it to some
extent, I know in some cases to a very considerable
extent. Can Ibe told by the hon. member, Mr.
Deakin, or by any other person, that where some
people absolutely possess and exercise twenty-five
votes, it is a matter of no consequence at all, and that
I am exaggerating the facts ?
Mr. Deakin : I did not say it was of no conse-
quence !
Sir GEORGE GREY : That I am exaggerating the
facts very much !
Mr. Deakin : Hear, hear !
Sir GEORGE GREY : What exaggeration could
properly represent such a thing is as stated here—that
even thirty votes have been so exercised by one man ?
Well, I contend that the whole of this constitution
bas been passed deliberately with the view of starting
with this system established as a part of it.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Ho !
Sir GEORGE GREY : It is so framed.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Ho; we are opposed to the
system as much as the hon. member is !
Mr. Munro : And we mean to alter it, too !
Sir GEORGE GREY: The answer is easy.
“ Opposed to the system as much as lam !” Then
refuse to vote for this bill, which is establishing it in
the country.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Ho ; it does not!
Mr, Playford : It is in the country now !
Sir GEORGE GREY: It maintains it in the
country.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Ho !
Sir GEORGE GREY : It hands it on. It distinctly
says, in every case of any consequence whatever, the
inhabitants of the states are to vote as they have voted
up to the present time.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Until they themselves think
fit to alter it!
Sir GEORGE GREY: Ah, ah! “Until they
themselves think fit to alter it !” In the first place,
what right have we to subsist on their bounty ? Our
parliaments gave us the power to do away with this
system in the bill, and that is what I say we should
have done. I say that the bill should begin, as such
federation bills usually do, by indicating that the
electors should have certain powers, and then proceed
from that to the rest of the bill. But these powers of
the electors have never been touched, and I say it is
impossible that any human mind who has not been
accustomed to such a system could have thought it
was a desirable thing to place in this new law. That
is where the great mistake is. We have asked nothing
unfair. We asked that the states should have the
power of saying what their own qualifications should
be—that is, by single vote they should determine
what they should have ; and if, as hon. gentlemen in
this Convention almost universally maintain, the
colony is enraptured with this plural vote system
Sir Samuel Griffith : Ho !
Mr. Deakin ; We say it is going to be thrown out.
We say it is dying fast; nobody believes in it. I do
not believe there is a man here who does !
Sir GEORGE GREY: How has it been in existence
so long ?
Mr. Deakin : We attacked it; and we shall attack
it this session again !
Sir GEORGE GREY : If everybody is against it,
how does it exist ?
Mr. Deakin : I say nearly everybody here is
against it!
Sir GEORGE GREY: How, then, have they
allowed it to remain so long in operation ? What
certainty have we that the men who have maintained
it in operation for years, who have established various
rules to give it greater force—such as allowing people
to vote by proxy in Western Australia, so that they
can vote over vast districts of country
Mr. Marmion : I beg the hon. gentleman's pardon.
There is no such thing as voting by proxy in Western
Australia. There is a system of voting by ballot—a
scheme which has not been in vogue in any other
colony, but which at the same time gives the same
right to a person to vote by pure and simple ballot, as
if he appeared at the polling-place where his vote is
to be given.
Mr. Dibbs ; What is the system ?
Mr, Marmion : It would take rather too long for
me to explain it.
Mr. Dibbs : It is by letter !
Mr. Marmion : He votes by letter, but not by
proxy. The things are utterly different.
Sir GEORGE GREY: Ah, ah !
Mr. Marmion : If I had time —and I do not wish
to take up the time of hon. gentlemen—l could easily
explain that the system is utterly different, and that
the system which we have in operation
The President : I must remind the hon. member
that the hon. member, Sir George Grey, is in posses-
sion of the Chair.
Mr. Marmion : I beg pardon, sir.
Sir GEORGE GREY : I should be grateful to the
hon. gentleman if I were wrong; but I still maintain
that I am right.
Mr. McMillan : A proxy can go into any person’s
hand !
Sir GEORGE GREY: However, it is voting by
letter. Why should I think even of making much of
this point? How is it that you have your elections
on different days ? Why do you do that in Hew
South Wales? If all the elections were upon one
day, it would prevent a man from going to so many
polls. But here the same thing nearly is done as is
done in Western Australia by ministers being allowed
to fix the elections on different days. I say, as far as
I am personally concerned, I felt so aggrieved, whilst
I was held down under a system of that kind, with a
considerable weight upon my mind, that I strove for
years to get rid of it, and it took many years to get
an end put to plural voting. I believe that, unless
by compunction, caused by what has been said in this
Convention, and said outside on the subject, men’s
hearts are moved into a different line from that in
which I have often heard them speak in past days,
years may elapse before the system of plural voting is
done away with, unless we refuse to accept a consti-
tution in which such principles are embodied, because
what really takes place is this : throughout that bill,
although the first batch of representatives are chosen
by the electors under the plural vote system, members
having secured their places in the house, they choose
the ministry. I say that ministers are chosen under
the system of plural voting, and that those ministers
appoint persons to an upper house.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Ho ?
Sir GEORGE GREY : The same principle obtains.
It is the parliament which selects ministers, and the
parliament has been elected under the plural voting


system. That system runs throughout the whole of
the proceeding. The arguments used to-day com-
mending this constitution, and lauding it for the
manner in which it has been ignore the fact
that it begins with unfair voting, almost the entire
power being given to capital. The states ai’e the places
in which the liberties of the people should be secured,
and in which there should be real local self-govern-
ment. It is the necessary test under this, or under
any similar constitution. I say that the people have
all the power of self-government taken out of their
hands by this constitution as it stands. When you tell
me that you intend to alter all these things, I answer
with the question, “How comes it that they exist now,
if you have all along intended to alter them 1” Either
there are difficulties in your way you could not over-
come, or you are using this language under pressure.
I have no certainty that if we adopt the constitution be-
fore this is done, before the people of the states have
this absolute power bestowed upon them, it would not
be extremely difficult afterwards to obtain it. lam
certain no sane men will consent to put their necks
under this new yoke—for in my belief it is a yoke
of a most oppressive kind. Why not let us all walk
out into the light of day free men—each man with
an equal vote, each man with that right preserved
to himself, his children, his family and his rela-
tives 1 Why should not such have been the case 1
Are not the ties that bind him to life equally precious
to every human being, whether rich or poor 1 And
why should he not be enabled to take the necessary
steps for his own liberty 1 The time will arrive when
it will be thought incredible that a rule should have
existed under which only one qualification was given
to a human being for himself, as a human being, and
under which twenty-five or thirty qualifications were
given him on account of that number of plots of land,
held by him in different places ; and that it was in
virtue of such a qualification that some beings exercised
over their fellow-men a power which ought not to be
exercised at all. I will not now delay this Convention
by entering upon the subject at greater length ; but I
could prove that acts of the greatest cruelty have arisen
from the causes of which I speak; that great tracts of
land—hon. members may laugh—have been under
their influence given away in a manner in which they
ought not have been : and that in consequence of
regulations to which I object, people of the native
races have been expelled from their territory without
the least compensation of any kind whatever, purposely
that the land might be given to certain persons. I will
simply add in conclusion that, as far as I am concerned,
I will to the last contest this question until I see that
justice—as far as it is possible to obtain it—is done to
my fellow-men. I still hope that before hon. gentlemen
determine to force this constitution upon the country—
or, rather, that before they try to do so—they will even
at the last moment invest their minds with some pity for
their fellow-men, and will recommit the bill, in order
that the objectionable clauses—and there are only two
or three—may be struck out, and in order that a
single vote may be given to every man in the country.
We shall then start our constitution upon a perfectly
fair basis. Ido not say that the bill does not contain
many good provisions. Why should it not do so 1 It
lias been largely made up of provisions taken from
similar constitutions, and of course only the best of
those provisions have been so selected. To me it is
sad to think that when we might have achieved so
great and noble an end, when Australia might have
walked forth truly a free nation into the light of
freedom, every man enjoying his own rights, we should
have refused to allow to be placed in this constitution
a right which the British Parliament are anxious to
bestow upon the people of this country, and which
we have unnecessarily, and, as I believe, wrongfully
withheld.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
ADOPTION OF THE CONSTITUTION.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH rose to move :
That this Convention recommends that provision be made
by the parliaments of the several colonies for submitting for
the approval of the people of the colonies respectively the
constitution of the commonwealth of Australia as framed by
this Convention.
He said : The Convention has now, in accordance with
the mandate imposed upon its members by their several
parliaments, considered and taken the necessary steps
to report upon a constitution forthe federal government
of Australia. It is necessary, before their recommenda-
tions can have effect, that the people of the several
colonies shall adopt the constitution. The question
naturally arises, how should that adoption be mani-
fested 1 At the present time the only bodies known to
the constitutions of the different colonies which can
express the will of their people, are the parliaments;
and it may be suggested that the natural bodies to
adopt the constitution should be the parliaments of
the several colonies. The hon. member, Mr. Playford,
this morning, in speaking on the motion for the
adoption of the constitution pointed out what he
considered might be a very serious objection to the
adoption of that form of procedure, that is, that the
question of the adoption of the constitution might be
mixed up with party .politics. If, as I anticipate, it
would not be thought fit that any parliament should
take so important a step without clearly obtaining the
opinion of the electors upon the subject, still it would
be very difficult to submit the question for the opinion
of the people at a general election. Take, for instance,
the question of protection and free-trade. One man
might be a protectionist, and in favour of this consti-
tution ; another man might be a free-trader and op-
posed to the constitution. If a general election took
place, and the question were submitted for the approval
of the people, the decision, I am afraid, would depend
upon whether the electors were in favour of protection
or free-trade rather than whether they were in favour
of or against federation. Therefore, it is very desir-
able that as far as possible the question should be
kept distinct. On the other hand, it does not seem
practicable for us to dictate to the various colonies
how they shall submit this question for ratification.
My personal opinion is that it should be submitted to
the vote of a convention or parliament elected for that
purpose only by the electors who vote for members
of the more popular branch of the legislature. I
do not think that we have any right, or that it
is within our instructions, to dictate to any colony
which is the best course. After consultation
with several leading members of this Convention
the form of words in this resolution seemed to indi-
cate what we think is the best course to be adopted,
without presuming io dictate to the parliaments of the
colonies. I know what course, as at present advised,
I should feel disposed to take if it fell to my lot to
propose it. I should ask the Parliament of Queensland
to authorise the summoning of a special convention,
consisting of the same number of members as the
members of the Legislative Assembly, and elected by
the same constituencies, whose duty it would be to
vote “aye ” or “ no ” forthe adoption of this constitu-
tion ; and to provide that if the constitution is adopted
by the convention it shall be considered as adopted by
the colony.
Colonel Smith : Does the hon. member propose that
this should be done by each colony separately 1
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH: Yes; each colony
must deal with the question separately, as an inde-
pendent state. The second of these resolutions —I
suppose we had better take them together
Sir John Bkay : Take them separately !
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : The second resolution
was arrived at by the Constitutional Committee.
That committee did not think the first resolution was
within their province, as it was not referred to them.


The second was certainly within their province. As
it seems to be considered convenient to move the
resolutions separately, I shall do so. I would take
this opportunity of observing that this motion by no
means indicates that the members of this Convention
disapprove of the principle of one man one vote. I
believe that a large majority of the members of the
Convention are in favour of that system. But I am
sure I speak the opinion of the majority when I say
we did not think it was within our province to dictate
to the people of the colonies as to what should be
their electoral qualifications, or to insist that there
should be no federation till all the colonies arrive at a
uniform system in that respect.
The President : I understand that the hon. and
learned member has moved only the Ist section of his
resolution. But, to enable hon. members to under-
stand the matter, I will read the other section of the
resolution, which he has not moved :
That the Convention further recommends that so soon as
the constitution has been adopted by three of the colonies,
her Majesty’s Government be requested to take the necessary
action to establish the constitution in respect of those colonies.
Sir JOHN BRAY : I wish to say that I think the
constitution would be more likely to commend itself
to the people of the colonies if, instead of inserting the
word “approval,” we used the word “consideration.”
As it stands, the motion seems to imply that we must
ask the people to accept this constitution or none at
all. I would ask the hon. and learned member, if he
does not attach much importance to the words in the
motion, to agree to the alteration which I have suggested.
I am quite with you, sir, under whose able presidency
the Convention have assembled, in saying that we
have reason to congratulate ourselves that we have
met in a spirit of compromise, and have come to a
general agreement with regard to federation. But
still, if we are asked individually for our opinion on
some matters in reference to the basis of the constitu-
tion, I think it is quite possible that we may be
compelled to differ from them. I am hardly sanguine
enough to believe that the people of all the colonies,
or that the people of any one colony, would be willing
to give their absolute approval of this constitution
without reserving to themselves the right to make or
suggest amendments for future consideration in some
way. It seems to me that if we were to put in the words
“ consideration of the people,” instead of the words
“approval of the people,” we should thereby invite them
not merely to consider what we have done with the
view of saying “yes” or “no,” but to consider how
far they are agreeable to accept the constitution.
And if they find that, in their opinion, it is absolutely
necessary that some amendments be suggested, it may
be necessary—it probably would be necessary—to have
another convention in a few months to determine how
far those suggestions could be adopted. But I know
from the manner in which the proposals with regard
to the Federal Council were dealt with, that if we
ask the people of the different colonies to say definitely
whether they will take this as a whole, or reject it as
a whole, we shall not put it in what they will consider
a fair spirit. If we say, “We submit this for your
approval or disapproval, and do not invite you to
make any recommendations for its alteration,” they
will think that we are not approaching them in the
spirit in which we should approach them. Although
I do not wish to press this proposal against the
opinion of those who have been acting on the Consti-
tution Committee, and who have considered the effect
of the words which we are asked to agree to, I would
ask the members of that committee to consider seri-
ously whether they think it fair to say to the people
of Australia, that they must either approve or dis-
approve of this constitution, to show whether or not
they are in favour of federation. I believe that the
people of Australia generally are in favour of federa-
tion ; but, at the same time, I am one of those who
think the people may say that there are some particu-
lars in regard to which they believe this constitution
might be amended.
Colonel Smith : And suppose amendments are sug-
gested, how would you decide upon them afterwards ?
Sir JOHN BRAY : Another convention would
have to be summoned to see how far the details could
be arranged. It would be very pleasant to many of
us to go away with the idea that we have in the
course of the last few weeks framed a constitution
which, without amendment, will be acceptable to the
people of Australia. lam one of those who think
that we can hardly do that. Time will have to be
allowed, not only for the people to consider, but also
for ourselves to consider, the effect of what we have
proposed. As you, sir, very ably and very clearly
indicated, public opinion in reference to this question
has grown considerably during the last twelve months,
and I believe that public opinion will grow still more
during the next few months, and that what hon.
members think are absolute difficulties in our way will
appear as nothing compared to the objects which we
seek to accomplish. But Ido say that many points
have been suggested throughout the Convention which
will have to be fully and carefully considered by the
people, and which, I believe, a little more considera-
tion, a little further time, would induce many of us to
absolutely agree to. There is the point raised by me
when discussing the bill in Committee as to the taking
over of the public debts of the colonies. I feel more
strongly than ever that one of the greatest recom-
mendations you could possibly make to the people of
Australia to induce them to adopt the constitution of
the commonwealth would be some means of taking
over, on a fair and equitable basis, the public debts of
the colonies. Although on first contemplation this
appears to be a great task—a task beset with very
great difficulties—l am content to admit that there
are great difficulties, and that some mode of adjustment
would have to be adopted in reference to it; still I
believe that it is the one object which, more than any
other, would commend itself to the people of Australia
when they began to realise the advantages that would
accrue from their having a general debt of the common-
wealth of Australia rather than debts of individual
colonies.
Mr. Dibbs : You can only do that under complete
unification!
{Sir JOHN BRAY : I say that is a point which
requires to be further considered. I admit that
when we first assembled the most that I thought we
could do would be to get the commonwealth to take
over the debts with the consent of the various colonies ;
but the idea has grown to firm conviction that not
only ought the commonwealth to be empowered to do
it, but that it ought to be the duty of the common-
wealth. It is the only direct and immediate means
by which you can afford the separate colonies the
relief that they ought to have when you take over the
customs revenue that they at present collect. Ido
not propose to discuss the details of the bill in other
respects ; but I will say this, that as far as the finan-
cial proposals are concerned, I am firmly convinced
that the Convention has made a mistake in not adopt-
ing the whole of the recommendations of the Finance
Committee. I have talked with people in this colony
and with others, who say that it will be absolutely
impossible to carry out the mode of distributing the
surplus provided for in the bill.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Certainly not; so long as
they have separate customs duties !
Sir JOHN BRAY : Yes, we continue them until
the parliament makes a new law. I admit that meets
the case to some extent. But the suggestion I made
was that the parliament should make a new law
immediately.
Mr. Deakin ; So they will!


Sir JOHN BRAY ; I admit that we have improved
the bill to this extent, that we say that this system
shall only continue till the parliament does make a
new law. But we are leaving for the future what
ought to be done to-day—there is no doubt about
that. In many respects in this bill we deliberately
say to the parliament of the future, “We are going to
leave you to do certain things,” which things I am
satisfied we ought to do now. We say to them, with
reference to the public debt of the colonies, “ You may
do it,” but. I contend that we ought to do it. With
regard to the financial adjustment of the surplus, we
say to the new parliament, “ You may do it,” while I,
as a member of this Convention, feel that we ought to
do it. We are relegating to a parliament in the future
a duty we ourselves ought to perform. However, I
do not wish to go into that question now. We had
far better, if we wish to get the approval of the people
of Australia to our work, submit the constitution for
their consideration, and not for their absolute approval.
If we submit it for their approval only, we invite
them to say, “ We will have this or we will have
nothing.” We ought to say to them, “ We have met in
Convention ; we have discussed the different matters
in a fair and liberal spirit, with a view to a com-
promise ; this is the best possible arrangement we
have been able to arrive at, and we ask you now not
absolutely to approve or disapprove of it, but to
consider it, and express your opinion upon it.” It is
not possible to imagine that the several colonies will
be prepared to say absolutely yes or no to the bill as
it now stands. The most we ought to do is to ask
them to fully consider the matter; and if it becomes
necessary in the course of time, to propose amend-
ments in the bill, those amendments may be dealt with
by another convention of representatives of Australia,
in order that the people may deliberately determine
the basis of their new commonwealth. I beg to move,
as an amendment:
That the word “ approval ” be omitted with a view to insert
in lieu thereof the word ‘ ‘ consideration. ”
Mr. WRIXON: I intend to support the amend-
ment. I think our object is, how we can best get this
bill which we have passed adopted by the different
colonies. That is the object we have in view. In
carrying that out we must remember that, to a great
extent, this subject comes down upon the people from
above. They have not yet considered it. The electors
generally have not yet entertained the subject; and it
will be our duty, when we get back to our different
colonies, to compel them to consider it, to bring it
before them, and to enable them to form their opinions
on it one way or the other.
Colonel Smith : Within what time 1
Mr. WRIXON : In the quickest time we can.
But I would take leave to say that the matter of a
year or two is of little consequence compared with
the importance of framing a constitution which will
thoroughly satisfy us after we have adopted it. I do
not in the least share in the anxiety that this constitu-
tion should be adopted next year or even the year
after. My anxiety is that it should commend itself
to the peoples of the different colonies, and be adopted
by them in such a shape that it will be lasting and
satisfactory. The mere verbiage of course may seem
of small importance—whether we say “approval ” or
“ consideration ” may not seem of much moment. Yet
there is a great deal involved in it. If we simply put
it that we submit this constitution for the approval or
disapproval, aye or no, of the people of the colonies,
the whole tiling is very likely to miscarry. As the
people are dealing with a subject which is somewhat
new to them, and with a constitution which they have
had no opportunity of fully considering, this may
jeopardise the whole thing. If we want to succeed
we must take the electors into our confidence. We
must ask them to consider the points we have been
considering, and deal again, if need be, with the ques-
tions with which we have dealt. It may be that if that
were done, the process I apprehend being that each
parliament would pass a bill enabling a convention in
each colony to meet to deal with the question, a sub-
sequent national convention would be necessary to
finally adopt the bill. That may be so ; but even then
it would only mean a delay of perhaps a year, and the
plan would have the advantage of bringing the peoples
of the different colonies wholly with us, and of pre-
venting any chance of wrecking this great scheme on
which we are engaged. If, therefore, the hon. mem-
ber, Sir John Bray, presses his amendment to a division
I shall vote with him.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I should like, before
the matter goes further, to point out how the proposal
of Sir John Bray strikes me. The hon. member
avowedly says he wishes each colony to consider this
constitution and amend it. Now, cannot he see
exactly what that means'? We have laboured here
for weeks endeavouring to frame a constitution; we
have met conflicting views; we have endeavoured to
arrive at compromises; each colony has had strong
views of its own, and its representatives have surren-
dered those views for the purpose of arriving at a com-
promise. The hon. member proposes that all that work
should go for naught, that this constitution shall be
sent back to each colony. Take, for instance, the colony
of South Australia. They will insist that the distri-
bution of the surplus revenue shall be according to
population, and that the senate shall have absolutely
equal rights with the house of representatives, and
they will approve of the bill only if the compromises
arrived at on these two important points are abso-
lutely set aside. The colony of Tasmania will agree
on certain other conditions, that is to say, if other
important compromises are set aside. The other col-
onies will do the same. Victoria will say, “We are
not satisfied. This compromise is not what we wanted.
We will vote for the bill, provided you set aside this
compromise and Queensland will say the same. All
our labours in the way of conciliation and compromise
wili be entirely thrown to the winds if we submit to
the people of the different colonies a draft for their
consideration in which they can make thousands of
amendments if they think fit. That is how the matter
strikes me. lam satisfied that if any hon. member of
this Convention desires to postpone federation no better
mode could be adopted than to invite these various
amendments, as Sir John Bray proposes to do.
Mr. BAKER : Although I am not at all satisfied
with this constitution, and voted with the minority
on most occasions, I cannot conceal from myself, nor
do I think any member of the Convention should
conceal from himself, the fact that this constitution
must be swallowed by the colonies as a whole.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Or not at all!
Mr. BAKER : Exactly—one or the other. To
invite the different colonies to make such amend-
ments as they think tit is to absolutely waste all the
time we have spent here. The proposal seems to me
to be absurd, and I cannot see that any answer can
be made to the argument of the hon. member, Sir
Samuel Griffith. I hope the Convention will not
accept the amendment of ray colleague, Sir John
Bray. It is in express words absolutely inviting the
colonies to start again on the work of forming a con-
stitution. What did we come here for ? We came
here to try if we could frame a constitution, but now
the hon, gentleman deliberately proposes that the
colonies should put aside all our efforts and start
afresh themselves. That is what it comes to, and I
hope the amendment will not be carried.
Mr. MUNRO : I think there is a way out of the
difficulty if we follow a precedent that will satisfy
both sides. It took about five months to form the
American Constitution, and when it was submitted
to the states for adoption, they had to say “ aye” or
“no”; but they were allowed in their conventions to


make any recommendations they thought proper with
regard to future amendments, and those amendments
were taken into consideration by the new congress
when it met. That is the proper time to deal with
such amendments. If we are going to frame a
constitution here, and then send it to the various
colonies to be altered as they think proper, the thing
will be interminable. If we adopt the American
plan, and allow the different colonies in their own
conventions to prepare a schedule of any amendments
they would like adopted, and let those amendments,
as a whole, be referred to the new parliament when
it meets, then the wishes of the people will be given
effect to, if approved of. But to ask us to adopt the
proposal of Sir John Bray is simply to say that all
our work shall be laid aside.
Mr. SUTTOR : I do not know whether it is the
intention of the Convention to accept the proposal of
the hon. member, Sir John Bray ; but if it is not, I
would suggest that the words “ for the approval of ”
be struck out, with a view to the insertion in lieu
thereof of the words “as soon as possible to.”
Sir Samuel Griffith : For what purpose 1
Mr. GILLIES : It appears to me that there are
only two ways in which this constitution can be satis-
factorily considered by the colonies. As some hon.
members have advocated from time to time, there
might be a referendum to the people, so that they
could say “yes” or “no” to it; or assuming that
there are considerable objections to it—and it will
probably take some time before we can understand
what those objections may be, and whether they will
be insuperable—a bill might be submitted to each
legislature, asking them to provide for the election of
delegates to represent their colony at a convention,
which should meet and consider the question, their
determination to be absolutely final, and the consti-
tution which they adopted to be transmitted at once
to the Imperial Government. If we do not take this
course, I do not see that there is any other way of
dealing with the difficulty, except by getting a “yes”
or “no ” approval or disapproval from each colony. I
can quite see that if each colony is called upon to
make amendments in the constitution there will be no
end to them, and it will be very difficult to come to a
conclusion upon ; but if each parliament passed an act
providing for the creation of a convention, the members
of which would have power to absolutely determine
all these matters, we should obtain finality.
Sir Samuel Griffith : Does the hon. member think
they would do it 1
Mr. GILLIES : I think they would; but there is
this difficulty : Take the case of either New South
Wales or Victoria. I think it is acknowledged that it
would be very much to be regretted if either of those
colonies could not approve of the constitution, and
were to refuse to join the commonwealth. It would
be a great pity; but it might come about owing to
their insistance upon two or three amendments, not
by any means of a vital character, and which they
might he willing to resubmit to a convention, to which
they had given complete authority to finally determine
the whole question. If we do not do that, I see no
other way of arriving at a final determination than by
a “ yes” or “no” decision with regard to the bill as it
stands on the part of each colony. But it seems to
me that it would be a great pity to take a final answer
upon the bill as it stands if there were a possibility of
one of the large colonies refusing to join the federation
simply because of the omission of one or two provisions
which they thought ought to have been inserted, or
because of the presence of one or two provisions which
they thought ought to have been struck out. I think
it would be a great pity, though it might happen if
some of the colonies absolutely refused to join the
commonwealth. There is no doubt, however, that by
a convention having complete authority to deal with
the whole question, we should obtain finality, and I
think a sufficient number of colonies would agree to
the constitution as it might then be amended to admit
of its being sent direct to the Imperial Parliament.
To invite the colonies to make amendments in this
bill would, I think, be a pity.
Mr. DIBBS : I intend to vote for the amendment
of the hon. member, Sir John Bray, and I shall do so
with the strong conviction that all we are endeavour-
ing to do here is in the interests of the people of
Australia, and that if we wish to work for the good
of Australia, and in the interests of the people, we
we must consult them and get their approval at every
stage of the work which we have in hand. It must
be borne in mind that the first intention with regard
to the Convention was that the constitution when it
was framed should go direct to the Imperial Parliament.
Sir Samuel Griffith : No !
Mr. DIBBS : Yes, that was the intention—not the
intention expressed in the Convention ; but before the
Convention was appointed—that the constitution
should go direct to the Imperial Parliament.
Mr. Munro : No !
Mr. DIBBS : It is all very well to say no; but the
hon. gentleman was not in Sydney at the time the
subject was being considered, because his duties have
kept him in Victoria.
Mr. McMillan : It was not the intention !
Mr. DIBBS ; How can the hon. member say that ?
He has never been within the mind of the Presi-
dent of the Convention. I have been a listener and
a searcher after the truth, so as to ascertain it as far
as possible, and in the speeches which the Premier
originally made with regard to federation, though not
in his later speeches, he stated that the constitution
upon being framed by the Convention, should go
straight to the Imperial Parliament.
Mr. Baker : Then what was the object of our
reporting to the several parliaments 1
Mr. DIBBS : All that was afterwards changed, and
we were authorised by our various parliaments to come
here and draft a constitution.
The President : Do I understand the hon. member
to say that I gave expression to that idea 1
Mr. DIBBS : Yes ; I do.
The President : Then I can only say—and I ought
not to be called upon to say it in this place —that I
utterly deny having done so.
Mr. DIBBS : Of course I take the hon. member’s
denial ; but having followed every letter and speech
that has been made on the federation question, from
the time the hon. member raised it in Queensland
eighteen months ago up to the present, it seemed to
me clear that his original intention was that the con-
stitution should go straight from this Convention to
the Imperial Parliament. However, it has been deter-
mined by our several parliaments that we should come
here and draft a constitution; but I would ask hon.
members to bear in mind that the parliaments who
sent them here have never had authority from the
people to send us; and to attempt any rapid mode of
dealing with the question without giving the people
from one end of Australia to the other an opportunity
of considering it on its merits, is to invite opposition
to federation. If you want to build a staunch ship
you must lay your keel strongly on the stocks, and
you must go on firmly until it is finished. So it is
with the ship of state. You must go on with it
slowly and strongly, until you launch it in all the
glory of a federal constitution. But if you endea-
vour to rush the matter through or to obtain the
opinion of the people by a plebiscite, you court
disaster. Step by step you must put in the found-
ation and build your structure, and you can only build
the structure firmly when you have the hearty con-
currence of the people. To make any endeavour to
take a bare “ yes ” or “ no ” decision with reference to
the constitution will be to thwart the efforts being
made towards federation. We must not be afraid of


the people, and this desire to hasten through the work,
so that we may not have to do it all over again, is mere
bunkum. The people must go with us in this matter,
and unless we have them with us we must not attempt
it. They must be educated up to the question ; but
it will take time to educate them, and there will be
no solidity in the constitution unless from first to last
we have them fully with us. lam in favour of the
amendment of the hon. member, Sir John Bray, and
I would go further and say, let a parliament, elected
on the one issue only—"Shall Australia be federated?"
—send members to a convention to revise this con-
stitution, and improve it. It is undoubtedly capable
of being improved, and time will develop the improve-
ments necessary. When that convention has approved
of the constitution, we may take a plebiscite, and then,
if the people agree to the constitution, it will last.
But any attempt to force it, or to display haste, will
be to destroy all we are trying to do.
Mr. ABBOTT : I do not suppose it entered the mind
of any man in the community of New South Wales or
any other of the Australian colonies that this bill was
to be submitted to the parliaments to be accepted or
rejected. lam quite sure that in our own legislature
—and I have followed the debates as closely as I could
in the other legislatures—those who proposed that this
Convention should be held proposed that whatever the
result of the Convention might be, an appeal should
be made to the people to enable them to say whether
there should be federation or not. It was never sup-
posed in our legislature that the Parliament existing
at the present time should be asked to accept the bill
prepared by this Convention, and I am quite sure that
no other paidiament in Australia ever supposed such
a thing. It was always intended that whatever the
result of this Convention might be, it should be sub-
mitted to the parliaments, and from the parliaments
to the people, and you yourself, Mr. President, in the
legislature of New South Wales, I have heard over and
• •
over again state that under no circumstances, what-
ever the result of the Convention might be, should
there be any legislation upon it without a direct appeal
to the people themselves. I think it is almost need-
less to say that that was the object of our own Parlia-
ment in appointing delegates to this Convention, so
that, combined with the delegates from the other
colonies, they might put a definite proposal before the
people of Australia. I agree with my hon. colleague,
Mr. Dibbs, when he says that we must lay a sure
foundation, and that sure foundation must be the
approval of the people of the various colonies. As I
said before, it was never intended that any measure
brimdrm about federation should be initiated in the
parliaments without first appealing to the people of
the country. I do hope that we shall have many
opportunities of speaking to the people before we
determine upon a federal union under any law ; and
I am quite sure that that was your intention when
you made the proposal to our own legislature.
Mr. PLAYFORD : It appears to me that we really
have no policy but to remit the question to the people
in the form of "yes or no." If we adopt any other
course it will only result in absolute confusion. One
colony will suggest one amendment, and another colony
will suggest another amendment. The colonies gene-
rally will suggest a great number of amendments, so
that the convention which would be called together
would have to frame another constitution. Do you
expect that people elected for one particular colony,
and going to the convention with instructions to
carry a certain proposal, will be likely to come to a
fair compromise ? Do hon. members think the mem-
bers of a convention, brought together under such
circumstances, receiving instructions from individual
colonies to carry out certain views, will be likely to
compromise matters as we, unfettered by any special
instructions excepting for the formation of what we
believe to be a just and equitable scheme for the
federation of the colonies, have compromised them ?
Do hon. members suppose that anything of that kind
will result ? What, then, will the final result be ?
After the convention has agreed to something, will
not the people say, "You must remit it to us again " ?
Will they agree to the work of that convention ; will
they say they will be bound by a majority of the con-
vention, when their representatives have, very likely,
received definite instructions to adopt a certain course
of action ? Will they not say that what has been done
by a majority of the convention must still be submitted
to the people 1 Will it not be better, under the cir-
cumstances, to take the " yea" or the " nay" of the
people at once ? If they say "nay," we shall, no
doubt, through the press, ascertain the reasons why
they are not in favour of federation under certain
circumstances, and under what circumstances they
would be in favour of it. We may thus, ultimately,
have another convention and another appeal to the
people. It will be a great deal better to ask the
people at once ; but how can you ask the people to
express their \iews and opinions on the details of the
bill ? No two persons who go to the poll would vote
alike. The idea appears to me to be out of the ques-
tion. It cannot be carried out. As I have already
stated, my idea is to put the question to the people
directly, and let them say " aye" or " no."
Mr. DIBBS : Does the hon. member mean to put the
whole of the bill, and nothing but the bill, before them?
Mr. PLAYFORD : If a number of them vote
"No," and say "We would have gone for federation
if the lines had been different," we can have another
convention subsequently, and we can frame another
constitution ; but you will never frame a constitution
if those who are elected by the people of the various
colonies for the purpose of framing it, receive definite
instructions as to the course they are to pursue,
because, under those circumstances, there will be no
possibility of compromise. There is no federal consti-
tion in the world in regard to which that course has
been adopted. It was never adopted in America. It
was never adopted in Canada, where the question was
to be answered by " Yea "or " Nay." It was never
adopted in Switzerland, and, as far as I know, it was
never adopted in the German federation. It has
never been adopted ; and, if you will look clearly into
the matter, you will see that it cannot work. It is
impossible to ascertain the exact views of the people
on all these different points, and they must therefore
say " Yea "or " Nay." There is one point, however,
on which the people may express their views. Public
opinion throughout the various colonies will make the
fact known that it is desired that at the earliest pos-
sible moment certain alterations should be made in the
constitution on certain leading lines, and when the
new parliament of the commonwealth is formed, that
parliament will be able to make those alterations in
the same way as alterations were made in the Consti-
tution of the United States when it was framed.
That will be a far more satisfactory method. The
people of the colonies, and the press will no doubt
express their views, and if there is a unanimous expres-
sion of opinion in favour of alterations in the constitu-
tion, they can be made by the parliament of the common-
wealth immediately after it has met, and in a much
more satisfactory manner than can possibly be made by
any convention specially elected for the purpose. I
think the mode proposed is the only satisfactory one.
We were appointed, as I understand, by the parlia-
ments of the various colonies for the purpose of
drafting a constitution to be submitted to the people
for them to say "yea" or "nay "to it; and if they say
that many of the clauses are of such a character that
they cannot agree to them, although, at the same
time, they may be in favour of federation, they will
vote against them with the view, eventually, of the
appointment of another convention to draft a bill
which will better suit their views. That would be


the result of what the hon. member himself proposes.
Therefore, I think it would be a great deal better to
vote for the clause as it stands in preference to the
suggestion of the hon. member, Sir John Bray, who
proposes that the matter should be considered by the
people. I do not mind if the words he proposes to
insert are inserted before the word “approval.” Of
course, it is understood that the people will consider
the matter before they give their approval, so that no
harm will be done by inserting the words “ for the
consideration and approval of the people.”
Question —That the word proposed to be omitted
stand part of the question—put. The Convention
divided.
Ayes, 24; noes, 7 ; majority, 17.

Question so resolved in the affirmative.
Sir GEORGE GREY : I move :
That the resolution be amended by inserting after the word
“ respectively” the words “ at a plebiscite on the principle of
one man one vote.”
The clause would then read as follows :
That this Convention recommends that provision be made
by the parliaments of the several colonies for submitting for
the approval of the people of the colonies respectively, at a
plebiscite on the principle of one man one vote, the constitu-
tion of the commonwealth of Australia as framed by this
Convention.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
ESTABLISHMENT OE THE CONSTITUTION.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH rose to move:
That the Convention further recommends that so soon as
the constitution has been adopted by three of the colonies,
her Majesty’s Government be requested to take the necessary
action to establish the constitution in respect of those colonies.
He said: This is a recommendation from the Con-
stitutional Committee. It is impossible to know how
many colonies will adopt the constitution. It might
happen that only Western Australia, Tasmania, and
Queensland would adopt it, in which case I have no
doubt that her Majesty’s Government would not
recommend the parliament of the United Kingdom to
pass it into law; but I do not anticipate that con-
tingency. On the other hand, supposing the three
colonies on the eastern seaboard, or that New South
Wales, Victoria and South Australia, adopted it,
there would be no reason why we should wait any
longer. I need not give any further reasons.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
REPORT OF PROCEEDINGS AND DEBATES.
Resolved (motions by Mr. McMillan) :
That the President forward copies of the Proceedings and
Debates of the Convention to his Excellency the Governor of
New South Wales, for transmission to the Eight Hon, the
Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies.
That the President forward copies of the Report of the
Proceedings and Debates of the Convention to the repre-
sentatives of the colonies at this Convention, for presentation
to their respective parliaments and for general distribution.
VOTES OF THANKS.
Mr. MUNRO : Our duties being now ended, I
have been requested to propose a very important
resolution which I have not the least doubt will be
carried not only unanimously, but with enthusiasm :
That the thanks of the Convention be given to the Hon,
Sir Henry Parkes, G.C.M.G., President ; the Hon. Sir
Samuel W. Griffith, K.C.M.G., Vice-President; and the
Hon. Joseph Palmer Abbott, Chairman of Committees of
the Whole, for the services rendered by them to the Con-
vention.
I am quite sure that all the members of the Conven-
tion will agree with me in saying that we are under
a great obligation to those gentlemen for the atten-
tion which they have given to the business, and the
manner in which they presided over our meetings. 1
had the pleasure and the honor of proposing you, sir,
for the position of President, and I am quite sure we
all feel that you have been the right man in the right
place. Ido not think it would be wise now to dwell
on these matters, for we all know and appreciate the
services which have been rendered.
Mr. PLAYFORD ; I second the resolution with
very great pleasure.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
The PRESIDENT: It seems to me that it is my duty
at this stage to express my acknowledgments, and it
will be the duty of the other two gentlemen named
in the resolution to express theirs, I feel myself very
sensibly the compliment paid to me. I accepted my
nomination to the office of President, not, perhaps,
with much misgiving, but I can say safely with no
desire for that office to the exclusion of any more
acceptable member of the Convention. Since I have
occupied the chair I have received such uniform
courtesy, so much kindness, so much consideration
for any failings of mine, and so much appreciation of
my small services, that lam more than gratified. It
is, of course, a great distinction to preside over a body
so distinguished as this Convention. We have amongst
us, I think, no fewer than fourteen or fifteen gentle-
men who either are prime ministers, or have occupied
that post; and it must be assumed, even if we had no
personal knowledge, that the colonies would only send
as their representatives their best men. The Conven-
tion is composed of men whose names are historically
known already, and it is a great distinction indeed to
be promoted to the high station of presiding over the
deliberations of these distinguished men. I appreciate
that myself very deeply, and I return my sincere
thanks for all the courtesy and kindness I have
received, with the assurance that I shall not soon
forget the many acts of consideration which have
been shown to me by hon. members, I can say
nothing more, except again to express my grateful
acknowledgments for the distinction conferred upon
me, and also for the various acts of kindness and
courtesy extended to me during the time I have
occupied the chair.
Sir SAMUEL GRIFFITH : I desire also to offer
my acknowledgments to the Convention for the com-
pliment paid to me in including me in this vote of
thanks. My duties as Vice-President of the Con-
vention have not, I am happy to say, been very
arduous, as you, sir, have been able to perform the
functions almost throughout the whole of our sittings.
The functions which fell to my lot as chairman of the
Constitutional Committee were more arduous. In
respect to them I desire to express my special acknow-
ledgments to the gentlemen who were on the com-
mittee with me for the help which they gave me, and
especially with respect to the difficult work of drafting
the bill, or being responsible for the drafting, which
fell to my lot as chairman. I desire to express my
thanks, as an individual, to the hon. member, Mr.
Clark, Attorney-General of Tasmania, and to the hon.
member, Mr. Kingston, lately Attorney-General of


South Australia, who were originally associated with
the drafting committee, and also in no less degree to
my hon. friend, Mr. Barton, of New South Wales,
who took Mr. Clark’s place when he was laid up, and
who devoted himself to that work as strenuously and
as industriously as any man with whom I ever had
the pleasure of working, and I venture to say that I
have done a good deal of hard work in my time. I
have also to express my acknowledgments to the Con-
vention for the uniform courtesy and consideration
with which they have treated me. I have felt some-
times that I was, perhaps, a little too insistent on my
views; but I hope they will pardon me. I, for my
part, shall leave this Convention with the most plea-
surable feelings. I had the pleasure of knowing nearly
all the members personally before—l think there were
only three members whom I did not know before ; old
acquaintances have been renewed, and I feel, as ray
hon. colleague from Queensland said this morning, it is
impossible to go away from a meeting of this kind
without profiting very greatly by intercourse with so
many minds. I hope that what will follow on our
work will be as satisfactory as it seems to us at the
present time.
Mr. ABBOTT : I have to return my thanks to the
Convention for the honor which they did me in electing
me Chairman of Committees, and 1 have to thank hon.
members for the very little trouble which thev gave
me in the discharge of those duties. I hope that in the
future, occupying the position which I do in this legis-
lature, I shall have as little trouble in maintaining
law and order as I have had during the discussions of
the Convention in Committee. It is an honor to be
associated with such a Convention, and I am quite
sure that, whatever the result may be, the bringing
together of so many public men from the different
colonies will be of lasting benefit to every one of the
colonies. Again I thank hon. members.
OFFICERS OF THE CONVENTION.
Mr. MUNRO : I beg to move :
That the thanks of this Convention be given to Frederick
William Webb, Esquire, secretary, and to his assistants, and
also the members of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff of
New South Wales, for their services to the Convention.
I wish simply to say one word in support of this
motion, and it is that the members of the Convention
feel that these gentlemen have discharged their duties
in an admirable manner. As one who is always com-
plaining of the slowness with which the Hansard of
Victoria is published, I highly appreciate the smart-
ness with which the members of the Hansard staff of
this colony have performed their work. I was per-
fectly surprised to find a proof copy of Hansard at our
hotels each morning, containing the previous day’s
Rebates ] and looking through the reports from time
to time, I was equally surprised to find so few mis-
takes, lam sure that Mr. Webb has discharged his
duties in an equally satisfactory manner, and that his
assistants are also entitled to our thanks, lam sure
hon. members will unanimously join in passing this
vote of thanks in the most hearty manner.
Mr. DIBBS : Before the morion is put from the
chair I should like to say that I indorse every word
uttered by the hon. member, Mr. Munro, with regard
to the officers who have given their time and services
to the Convention. As a representative of New
■South Wales, I should like also to make a suggestion,
and I know that it has only to be made to receive at
your hands, sir, a generous and hearty response. We
should bear in mind that these gentlemen are civil
servants of New South Wales, and that they have
not only given us the benefit of their services during
the last six weeks, but have devoted a large amount
of time, out of what is really their vacation, to their
duties in connection with the Convention. I feel
that the Government of New South Wales should
recognise the value of the services of these gentlemen.
I refer not only to the Parliamentary Reporting Staff,
but I include the secretary to the Convention and
other officers down to the humblest officer employed
in these buildings, and who might, but for this Con-
vention, have been enjoying a holiday. I hope the
whole of them will receive at the hands of the Govern-
ment that generous recognition of services which is
characteristic of the colony of New South Wales ; and
I have no doubt that the suggestion once made—even
if it should not already have occurred to your mind,
sir—will receive from you a generous and hearty
response.
The PRESIDENT : The hon. member, Mr. Dibbs,
having so lively a sense of the justice and propriety
of the present Government, may rest assured that his
suggestion has only to be made to be followed. If it
be not out of place, I may state that the Government
have very few pleasures amid the arduous duties they
have to perform, and that the keenest pleasure of all
is to adopt any suggestion coming from so amiable a
quarter.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
The PRESIDENT : Perhaps I may be permitted
to say, on behalf of Mr. Webb and the other officers,
that from a long personal knowledge of these gentle-
men, I feel assured that they would spare no effort,
and that they would draw very largely upon their
capabilities of endurance in order to give satisfaction
to this Convention. I think I may thank the Con-
vention on behalf of Mr. Webb and the other gentle-
men referred to in the resolution for the kind manner
in which it has expressed its sense of their services,
and I believe I may add, that although the per-
formance of those services has diminished much of
the time for enjoyment which during the parlia-
mentary recess they would have had, they still have
felt a sincere and high-toned pleasure in rendering
their services to the Convention at this important
epoch of our history. I thank you on behalf of Mr.
Webb and the other gentlemen for the manner in
which the resolution has been carried.
DISSOLUTION OP THE CONVENTION.
The PRESIDENT : I think it would be the most
becoming course not for any motion of adjournment
to be made, but for me to declare that this Con-
vention having done its work is now dissolved. Of
course it will meet no more. I have no doubt its
work will be heard of, and it would be unbecoming in
me to indulge in any words at this stage, or to do
more than declare that the proceedings of the Con-
vention have come to an end. I now ask the dele-
gates to rise in their places and to give three cheers
for her Majesty the Queen.
Hon. members rising in their places gave three cheers for the
Queen.
At the instance of Colonel Smith, cheers were also given for
the hon. the President of the Convention.
Sydney : George Stephen Chapman, Acting Government Printer.—lB9l.
