INTRODUCTION
by
PRIME MINISTER AND ACTING MINISTER FOR DEFENCE
1. In approving the issue for general information and
guidance, of this brochure on the functions and organisation
of the Defence Department and of the Higher Defence Machinery,
I would refer to certa in special features.
2. The present functions of the Minister and Department are
an evolution from nearly fifty years' experience of Defence
Ackninistration, since the establishment of the Cormionwealth in
1901, The organisation is therefore flexible and capable of
adaptation to meet progressively the changes indicated by ex-
perience to be necessary.
3. The recent war emphasised a definite trend towards the
closer relation of the Services through the Joint Service
Departmental machinery. This also had its counterpart in the
operational sphere in the appointment of Commanders-in-Chief
commanding naval, land and air forces, and functioning with
joint staffs of the three Services. The closer integration
of the three Services and their unified command and employment
have Involved a new conception of co-operation and strategical
employment. Another important feature was the development of
machinery to provide a link between the Commander of the uni-
fied Forces and the Government, A similar trend has not been
evident to the same degree in the realm of the internal admin-
istration of the Services in which the feature of separation
is more marked. Nevertheless, amalgamation has been carried
out in one important sphere, and the possibilities in other
directions are being explored. All of these trends are indi-
cated in the charts of organisation.
4. The whole question of Post-War Defence Policy is affected
by the impact of scientific development on the types of weap-
ons and armament for the various Services. Prominence has
been given ty the Government to Research and Developnent in
its Post-War Policy, and a new feature of the Higher Defence
Machinery is its expansion in this direction.


5. A corollary to the Policy pursued by Australian Govern-
ments for some years for the improvement of the Machinery for
Co-operation in British Commonwealth Defence, is the inclusion
in the Australian Defence Organisation for the first time, of
a special set-up and procedure for dealing with matters of co-
operation at both the Governmental and Official levels. Spec-
ial reference is made to the basic principles arising from the
Prime Ministers’ Conference in 1946 on Machinery for Co-opera-
tion in British Commonwealth Defence, the effectiveness of
which will largely depend on :-
(i) The uniformity of such organisation.
(ii) The capacity to function efficiently in war, and the
necessity to so function in peace that modifications
necessary to meet war requirements can be introduced
automatically and without any disruption in the
organisation.
6. Of particular interest in the trend of Higher Defence
Organisation in the United Kingdom and United States, to which
reference is made on a comparative basis, is the action
recently taken to appoint Ministers for Defence, and to create
Departments of Defence with appropriate Joint Service Machin-
ery.

II. THE MINISTER AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE
3. FUNCTIONS.-
A Minister and Department of Defence have existed since the
establishment of the Commonwealth in 1901, Prior to the last
war, the Defence Department embraced the three Services and the
Munitions and Supply machinery, the Defence Committee which is
responsible for advice on Defence Policy and Joint Service mat-
ters, and an over-all Secretariat which, through its central
Finance Bran in, also exercised financial control over the
Defence Vote.
To provide for war expansion, separate Departments were
formed for the Navy, the Army, the Air Force, Munitions, Air-
craft Production, and for Supply other than Munitions and Air-
craft. The Secretariat of the Department and the Defence Com-
mittee machinery became the Defence Department with responsibil-
ity for over-all Defence Policy and for conduct of the business
of the War Cabinet and Advisory War Council,
The present functions of the Minister and Department are
accordingly an evolution from nearly fifty years’ experience
since Defence was made a function of the Commonwealth, and have
been assigned and defined from time to time by the Government or
the Prime Minister.
Subject to the authority of Cabinet and the Council of
Defence, the Minister and Department of Defence are responsible
for :-
The formulation and general application of a unified Defence
Policy relating to the Defence Forces and their require-
ments, including
(a) Co-operation in British Commonwealth Defence and the
Defence aspect of the Charter of the United Nations.
(b) The supply aspect of Defence Policy, including the
review of production programmes and capacity.
(c) The scientific aspect of Defence Policy.
(d) The financial requirements of Defence Policy, and the
allocation of the funds made available.

IV. MACHINERY FOR CO-OPERATION IN BRITISH
COMMONWEALTH DEFENCE
15. BASIC PRINCIPLES.-
The following are the baale prlnclplei arising from the
Prime Ministers' Conference in 19M>, to which the Machinery for
Co-operation in British Commonwealth Defence should conform J-
(l) Be based upon the national defence organisations to be
maintained in the United Kingdom and in each Dominion.
(ii) Ensure that final co-ordination of, and executive de-
cision on, all matters of high defence policy are
achieved by agreement between Governments of the
United Kingdom and of the Dominions,
(ill) Provide the maximum degree of co-ordination on defence
matters which the sovereign status of the members of
the Commonwealth allows.


(iv) Provide for discussion of Dominion views on world security
problems.
(v) Be sufficiently flexible to cope with the varying outlooks
and resources of the different countries of the Common-
wealth.
(vi) Be framed so as to be capable of undertaking the direction
of effort in war in accordance with the strategical sit-
uation that may prevail.
(vii) Be capable of interlocking with that of other nations on a
Regional and World basis in accordance with the Charter
of the United Nations.
(viii) Be capable of functioning efficiently in war, and so
function in peace that modifications necessary to meet
war requirements can be introduced automatically and
without any disruption in the organisation.
(ix) Be capable of acting as the agents for the British Common-
wealth, either in peace or war in respect of Forces
assigned to a Government and of expansion, if necessary,
to undertake (vi).
16. THE APPLICATION OF THE BASIC PRINCIPLES TO THE AUSTRALIAN
DEFENCE MACHINERY.-
The United Kingdom, Australian and New Zealand Governments
have agreed to the following procedure relating to the use of
the Australian Defence Machinery for matters of Co-operation in
British Commonwealth Defence
(i) Government representation: The High Commissioners for the
United Kingdom and New Zealand will be invited to at-
tend meetings of the Council of Defence when matters
affecting those parts of the British Commonwealth are
under consideration.
As the sovereign control of its Policy is retained
by each member of the British Conmonwealth, and as the
Council of Defence is a statutory advisory body to the
Australian Government, any recommendations which it may
make on subjects of a British Commonwealth relation,
are matters for consideration by the Governments con-
cerned.
The proceedings of the Council will not limit, in
any way, the channel of direct communication between
Governments.


(il) Representation on the Official Level: The Governments of
the United Kingdom and Hew Zealand will maintain in
Australia a Joint Service Representative and Staff who
will be accredited to the Defence Department.
The general principle in regard to representation
on the official level will be that the Joint Service
Representative will be invited to attend meetings of
the Defence Gonmittee and Chiefs of Staff Conmittee
when matters affecting his country are under considera-
tion, Where necessary, he will also accompany his Gov-
ernmental Representative to the Council of Defence as
an advisor.
As each member of the British Oomnonwealth is re-
sponsible for its own Policy, and as the Defence Com-
mittee and Chiefs of Staff Conmittee are part of the
machinery of the Australian Defence Department, which
is administered by the Minister for Defence, the Joint
Service Representative will be responsible to and in-
structed by his Government, High Commissioner, or
Superior Service Authority in such a manner as his
Government may prescribe.
Similarly, members of the staff of the Joint Serv-
ice Representative will be invited to attend meetings
of the Joint Service Machinery subordinate to the
Defence Committee and Chiefs of Staff Committee.
Reciprocally, the Australian Government will have the right
of similar representation on the same basis on the corresponding
machinery of the United Kingdom and New Zealand.
As stated by the Prime Minister to Parliament last year,
though the above arrangements are limited to co-operation be-
tween the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, between
whom a special defence relationship has been established in the
Southwest Pacific Area and because of Common commitments which
have been accepted, it does not preclude their extension to
other parts of the British Commonwealth.
17. CHART.-
The portion of Chart No.l in Italian shows the use of the
Australian Machinery for matters of Co-operation in British
Commonwealth Defence.


V. THE IMPORTANCE OF UNIFORMITY OF ORGANISATION
ON A BRITISH COMMONWEALTH BASIS
18. THE FURTHER BASIC PRINCIPLE OF UNIFORMITY OF ORGANISATION.-
It will be apparent that the degree of effectiveness of the
basic principles in paragraph 15, and particularly those repeat-
ed below, will largely correspond with the extent of the uniform-
ity achieved in the Defence organisation of the members of the
British Commonwealth :-
(vlil) Be capable of functioning efficiently in war, and so
function in peace that modifications necessary to meet
war requirements can be introduced automatically and
without any disruption in the organisation.
(lx) Be capable of acting as the agents for the British Com-
monwealth, either in peace or war, in respect of
Forces assigned to a Government, and of expansion, if
necessary, to undertake the direction of effort in war
in accordance with the strategical situation that may
prevail.
It is important to bear in mind the principle of standard-
isation of organisation that has been laid down by an Imperial
Conference. The development during the war of the Machinery for
the Higher Direction of the war efforts of the members of the
British Coninonwealth and the Allies, and the trend towards the
closer integration of the three Services and their unified com-
mand, have emphasised its importance. The provisions of the
Charter of the United Nations relating to the military require-
ments for the maintenance of peace and security, and the employ-
ment and comnand of forces placed at the disposal of the Secur-
ity Council, also confirm the soundness of this principle.
19. CHART.-
Chart N 0.3 is included to show the Machinery for Higher
Direction in the Southwest Pacific Area in the recent war, in
relation to the Australian Government Machinery.
20. THE TREND OF THE UNITED KINGDOM HIGHER DEFENCE ORGANISATION.-
In relation to this description of the Australian Higher
Defence Machinery, it is of interest to mention the recent de-
cision of the United Kingdom Government to create a Ministry of
Defence.


The functions of the Minister have been defined as follows
Ministry of Defence Act:
The Minister of Defence shall be in charge of the formu-
lation and general application of a unified policy relating
to the armed forces of the Crown as a whole and their require-
ment s.
Command Paper on Central Organisation for Defence:
The Minister of Defence will be responsible for
(a) The apportionment, in broad outline, of available re-
sources between the three Services in accordance with
the strategic policy laid down by the Defence Com-
mittee. This will include the framing of general
policy to govern research and development, and the
correlation of production programmes.
(b) The settlement of questions of general administration
on which a common policy for the three Services is
desirable.
(c) The administration of inter-r Service organisations,
such as Combined Operations Headquarters and the
Joint Intelligence Bureau,
It should be noted that the United Kingdom and Australia
have now both arrived at the same broad organisation :-
(i) A higher Defence body as an adjunct to Cabinet. In
Australia it is the Council of Defence. In the
United Kingdom it is the Defence Committee which is
constituted as follows s-
The Prime Minister.
The Minister of Defence.
The Lord President of the Council.
The Foreign Secretary.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer.
The Secretary of State for War.
The Secretary of State for Air.
The First Lord of the Admiralty.
The Minister of Labour,
The Minister of Supply.
The Chiefs of Staff are in attendance and such other
Ministers and officers as may be required are invited
to attend meetings according to the subjects under
discussion.
(ii) A Minister and Department of Defence.


(iii) A Departmental advisory body on Defence Policy. In Aust-
ralia it is the Defence Committee. In the United King-
dom it is the Chiefs of Staff Committee which comprises
the Chiefs of Staff of the three Services with a repre-
sentative of the Ministry of Defence in attendance.
The Chairman of the Defence Research Policy Committee
also attends whenever matters affecting his functions
are discussed.
(iv) Separate Service and Supply Departments responsible under
their respective Ministers for their separate spheres
of administration within the defined Defence Policy.
21. THE TREND OF THE UNITED STATES HIGHER DEFENCE ORGANISATION.-
The United States has also recently created machinery for
the co-ordination of Defence Policy, and the following are its
main features
(i) The creation of a National Security Council corresponding
to the Council of Defence in Australia, with the fol-
lowing membership ;-
The President (corresponding to the Prime Minister).
(In the President's absence he may designate
another member to preside.)
The Secretary of State (corresponding to the Minister
for External Affairs).
The Secretary of Defence (corresponding to the
Minister for Defence).
The Secretary of the Navy (corresponding to the
Mini ster for the Navy).
The Secretary of the Army (corresponding to the
Minister for the Army).
The Secretary of the Air Force (corresponding to the
Minister for Air).
The Chairman of the National Security Resources Board
(approximating to the Ministers for Munitions and
Supply).
Other persons may be designated as members by the
President from time to time.
(ii) The appointment of a Secretary of Defence similar to the
Ministers for Defence in Australia and in the United
Kingdom, his functions being defined as follows :-
Under the direction of the President he shall -
Establish general policies and programmes for the
National Military Establishment and for all of
the Departments and agencies therein;
Exercise general direction, authority and control
over such departments and agencies;


Take appropriate steps to eliminate unnecessary
duplication or overlapping in the fields of
procurement, supply, transportation, storage,
health and research;
Supervise and co-ordinate the preparation of the
budget estimates of the departments and agencies
comprising the National Military Establishment;
formulate and determine the budget estimates for
submittal to the Bureau of the Budget; and
supervise the budget programmes of such depart-
ments and agencies under the applicable appropri-
ation Act,
(iii) The establishment of Joint Service Machinery corresponding
to the Defence Committee in Australia and the Chiefs of
Staff Committee in the United Kingdom. The Joint Chiefs
of Staff in the United States comprises the Chiefs of
Staff of the three Services and the Chief of Staff to
the Commander-In-Chief, if there be one,
(iv) The creation of Centralised Joint Intelligence Machinery
along the lines of the Joint Intelligence Organisation
recently approved in Australia, which is similar to that
in the United Kingdom,
22. COMPARATIVE STATEMENT.-
Attachment No.U is a tabular statement showing in summarised
form a comparison of the Higher Defence Organisations of Aust-
ralia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
VI. MACHINERY FOR NATIONAL PLANNING
FOR AN EMERGENCY
23. PREPARATIONS IN PEACE EMBRACE PLANNING FOR AN EMERGENCY.-
To achieve a balanced Defence Policy, it is necessary to
ensure proper co-ordination of the Navy, Army and Air Force, the
Supply Organisation and the civil economy which supports the
direct military effort. The Defence Machinery must provide for
the co-ordination of these as integral parts of the National
Defence Policy. In peace, it is a question of funds and man-
power and material resources that should be allocated for
Defence. In war, it is a matter of how the aggregate national
financial, manpower and material resources can be allotted to
maintain the most effective and balanced war effort. The prep-
arations in peace must embrace the planning for an emergency.


24. REVISION OF WAR BOOKS AND CONSTITUTION OF MACHINERY FOR
NATIONAL PLANNING.-
The basis of these plans is the Commonwealth War Book and
Departmental War Books, which are to be revised in the light of
the experience of war-time policy and administration and likely
contingencies.
The first step has been approval for the appointment of a
Commonwealth War Book Officer who will be the Executive Officer
in connection with War Book work, and will be responsible for
the compilation of the Commonwealth War Book, its maintenance
up to date, and for co-ordination of Departmental War Books with
the Commonwealth War Book,
Appropriate inter-Departraental machinery will be constitut-
ed to deal with the wide range of subjects covered by the War
Books.
25. CIVIL DEFENCE.-
As mentioned by the Minister for Defence in his statement
of Uth June on Post-War Defence Policy, important new
aspects of Civil Defence have been under consideration for some
time. Adequate measures for the defence of the civil community
against attack by atomic and biological weapons must be based on
proper scientific investigation which has not yet reached a
stage to enable planning and other measures to be soundly devel-
oped.
When this stage has been reached, it will be possible for
the Defence Committee and the Defence Scientific Advisory Com-
mittee, which has liaison with overseas sources of information,
to advise on this matter. It will then be possible to establish
a Committee on Civil Defence, representative of the Commonwealth
and State authorities concerned, to recommend the plans and
measures that should be taken.
26. CHARTS OF ORGANISATION.-
As the Defence Machinery is expanded to provide for National
Planning for an Emergency, the attached Charts of Organisation
will require to be supplemented to present a complete picture of
the full machinery.


The portion of the chart in italics shows the use of the Australian Machinery
for matters of Co-operation in British Commonwealth Defence.
