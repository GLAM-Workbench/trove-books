THE
SPRAY
OF
WOODBINE




I pressed unto my lips
the spray
Of Woodbine that thou
gav?st to me;
As, wakening from sweet
dreams I lay,
And then again I
dreamed of thee.

With me this spray
will e?er be bound
Whithersoe?er my foot-
steps rove ;
For ?mid its tender
leaves are wound
As round my heart-
deep thoughts of love.




How thee I love until
I die, ?
Though ne?er shall die
my love for thee, ?
Then on my breast
this spray shall lie,
And still shall bear me
company

Beyond the grave,?
whose earthly bars
Ne?er stay the Spirit?s
Heavenward flight,?
Beyond the regions of
the stars,
Into the radiant Realms
of Light.




For who shall say in
that fair land
There bloom no lovely
blossoms rare ?
That in the groves by
that far strand
No sweet bird music
fills the air?

That in the landscape
ne?er are seen
The graceful forms on
earth that moved,
In azure skies, or
waters green;
All things that God hath
made and loved ?

THE SUN AND THE EARTH
Thus spake the loving
Earth unto the Sun,?
?Shine on me, smile on
me, till my path?s run ;
When thou art shining
bright, glorious on high,
Gracious and splendid,
how blissful am I.
Joy is my portion, I know
but one care
Other dark planets thy
radiance share
Shine on me, smile on
me, from thy fair sky,
If thou desertest me
then shall I die.?

THOU AND I
I am the Moving Earth,
thou art the Sun
Shine on me, smile on
me, till my life?s done.
Light o?ercomesdarkness
whene?er thou art nigh,
In thy bright presence
how joyous am I.
Thine is my constant
love, now, evermore,?
Give me in turn, dear
Heart, all thy fairstore;
Shine on me, smile on
me, love me for aye,
If thou desertest me
then shall I die.?




THE KINGFISHER?S
THRONEROOM

THE KINGFISHER?S
THRONEROOM
A fairy nook
Where sunbeams play
Beside the brook
The livelong day.
Low hid it lies
Beneath the bank,
Where stiffly rise
The rushes dank
Stern watch and ward
That constant keep
To safely guard
The blooms that sleep
Those reeds beside
Upon the pool,
Where softly glide
The currents cool.
Like anchored boats
Those lilies sweet;




Securely floats
The flowery fleet.
Gay butterflies
Of brilliant hue
One there descries
A bright winged crew.
In the shallows
Fish are plying
Where the mallows?
Shade is lying.
They pass along
With lazy fin
The stems among,
Now out, now in.
And all the sky
Is sweet with song
Of birds on high
The trees among.




Fain would I wander
hence, afar
O?er leagues of land
and sea;
If I for my bright
guiding star
For evermore had
thee.

WHEN I'M WITH THEE




When I?m with thee,
when I?m with thee,
How fair the world
appears to me; ?
The flowers put on a
brighter hue,
The skies assume a
deeper blue,
The sun himself in
welcome warm
Sheds golden radiance
round thy form;
Ringing amid the leafy
trees,
And borne afar upon
the breeze,
Sweet songs of birds
my heart rejoice,
Yet not as doth thy
sweeter voice :
The world is very fair
to me
When I?m with thee,
when I?m with thee.


; ?, V v . ? v


The sea in shimmTing
beauty gleams
As, wand?ring on ?neath
silv?ry beams
Of mystic moonlight,
thou and I
Along the shore roam
happily.
With thou beside me
perfect joy
Fills all my soul, no
stern alloy
Of grief or pain can
wring my heart,
For Happiness reigns
where thou art;
Care spreads his wings
flies far away,?
And Love alone holds
joyous sway
The world is bright
and fair to see
When I?m with thee,
when I?m with thee.

But when thou?rt absent,
0 how drear
The scenes we loved
do now appear ;?
The flowers themselves
all seem to pine,
As glist?ning dew drops
tear like shine
Upon their drooping
heads; and low
The sighing winds
through branches blow
Of trees, whence all
the birds are fled,?
Waving so mournfully
o?erhead,
?Farewell,? ?Farewell,?
they seem to say,
?Farewell for ever and
a day.?
The gloom will only
cease to be
When I?m with thee,
when I?m with thee.

The day will surely
come, dear Heart,
When we shall never
have to part,
But dwell together
evermore ;
Fain would I reach
that distant shore,
Where pain of absence
never mars
The eternal joy; there
?midst the stars
We?ll walk together,
hand in hand,
In that far undiscovered
land.
If first I reach the
Pearly Gate
There will I thee, my
Love, await
I only wish those
Realms to see
When I?m with thee,
when I?m with thee.
