Ej
. . . FOOTPRINTS IN THE SANDS OF TIME”
HE faithful survey of a hundred years is a task that
forces humility upon the chronicler. There is so
much to record, such magnificence to tribute, that
the silent word seems so utterly inadequate; the
mind endeavouring to encompass it, all too frail
and transient. These pioneers have wrought upon the canvas
a picture approached with only a hope of understanding, and
with the reverence of a beholder of some glorious masterpiece
—work that has survived the agent of its execution. Truly
“Men live in deeds, not years.”
So, let us think of these pioneers in terms of their
works—not unmindful of the difficulties under which they
laboured—and works that have meant so much to us. They
made possible the security, the comfort, and a great part of the
happiness we enjoy to-day. They carved for us in this new land
a greater destiny than perhaps they knew.
It is meet that we pause awhile with on our lips a prayer
of thankfulness for their courage; in our hearts a song of joy
that they possessed such vision; that they left for us such in-
spiration. ... In the story that follows there must be gaps;
not always will it be possible adequately to reconstruct the
picture; nor to give full measure of praise to all who deserve
it. Hence, here, let us urge that sincerity and earnestness are
the pillars upon which this story has been reconstructed—that
gladly would a worthier monument have been created to their
memories had the mind been able to rise to such heights, and
the records rather more complete.
Let us now get the atmosphere of colonisation at a
time when British statesmen were building an empire. Homer,
the Greek poet, had pictured the world as a circle begirt by
“the great strength of ocean,” and it was into these uncharted,
practically unknown southern oceans, that Captain Cook ven-
tured in 1770. Eight years afterward, on a further voyage of
exploration, he was killed by natives at Owhyhee, in the Sand-
wich Islands.
In 1 830, Captain Sturt discovered and explored the River
Murray, and six years later this colony was founded. Edward
Gibbon Wakefield was the advanced political economist who
devised the successful colonisation scheme under which small
areas of land were sold and the proceeds used to bring out
additional settlers. By an Imperial Act of 1834 the minimum
price of land was fixed at 12/- per acre; a body of Commis-
sioners, of which George Fife Angas was a member, being
appointed. The Commission, gazetted on May 3, 1835, was
empowered to borrow £250,000 for the assistance of immi-
grants and costs incidental to founding the colony.
Mr. Angas, born at Newcastle, England, on May 10,
1 789, early saw failure of the Commission, and withdrew from
it in October, 1835, to establish the South Australian Company,
of which he became first chairman and held office for twelve
years. When he resigned, the nation and the Board expressed
appreciation of his services in a resolution attributing to him
the success of “establishing for Britain the flourishing colony
of South Australia.”
Through his secretary in the colony, Mr. Chas. Flaxman,
Mr, Angas acquired the fee simple of a large area of splendid
country in the Barossa Ranges, including the sites of Lindsay
Park and Angas Town. That South Australia should be free
from the shadow of convict settlement that marked the earlier
colonies, the Act of Establishment ordered that “No person


T—
;■ • ' .v \V::5
or persons convicted in any Court of Justice shall at any time
or under any circumstances be transported as a convict to any
place within the limits hereinbefore described.” In 1836, Mr.
Angas sent out the German geologist and mineralogist, Menge,
whose report stated, ‘‘l am certain that we shall see the place
flourish, and vineyards and orchards and immense fields of corn
throughout. It will furnish huge quantities of wine, it will yield
timber for our towns, and superior stone and marble abounds
for buildings.”
Mr. Menge saw possibil- p
ities that still are undeveloped,
for on March 9, 1 840, he advised
Mr. Angas that he had traced . , W
the River Gawler out of Flax- ’ » ;• * v 0
man’s Valley, through Light’s
Pass and Angas Park, and found I- >. ~
it carried more water than the *
River Torrens. For months, he I®
said, he had waited for it to flow,
and had convinced himself that HuSI
the river was buried in a number *
of valleys headed and formed by I r k
springs. He had opened one of j
these springs and found flowing IMBBHBIOimk
Water even in the dry months George French Angas’s Impression of Angaston in the Early ’Forties
He considered it possible for these springs to supply suffi
cient water to irrigate the Barossa Valley, and to be made to
flow into the stream below Gawler to such extent as to make it
navigable by boats. Here it should be mentioned that in later
years when dry seasons came, many of the springs to which Mr.
Menge referred were opened up. The sub-terrene was found
to be changing; supplies—once copious—from these springs,
dried up; wells that previously had held an abundance of water
went dry; and hollows that were swampy fifty years ago are
now firm ground. The idea of a big subterranean stream be-
neath Angaston and Nuriootpa is still held by many; but was
not accepted when investigations were being made in regard
to the water schemes for these centres.
A number of special surveys were made in 1839, each
of 4,000 acres; seven of which, in the neighbourhood of Angas
Town, were purchased by Charles Flaxman for Mr. Angas.
This was done without Mr. Angas’s authority, and occasioned
him some financial embarrass-
ment, although ultimately prov-
ing some reward for what Mr.
Angas had done for the colony.
Angaston was surveyed
by Messrs. Anthony Forster and
James Smith in 1841, and it
may be wise here to pause and
behold the surrounding country
as the early settlers saw it. Great
gum trees flourished everywhere,
and from one of them on the
Angas estate, William C. Hodder
later cut from the 30 ft. trunk
300 6 in. x 6 in. posts and ten
strainer posts.
The path by which the
first settlers came lay along the valley surveyed by Rowland,
and the track blazed by Colonel Light in 1837. It forked at
a point south of where Nuriootpa now stands, and which Chas.
Flaxman named Angas Park (or Angas Para), leading thence
to the peak of the Ranges in a line from Angas Park to Pen-
rice. Crossing the hill, this path led down to the valley that
later was to contain Angaston. Many years elapsed before
the direct route from Angas Park to Angas Town (now bitu-
menized) was made; and before the building of the stone-arch

bridge at the western entrance to Ang-
aston in 1865. Joshua Crann had the
what then were known as Salter’s min-
ers’ cottages on the right. There seems
to have been another fork leading to
the road behind the Baptist Church.
The new direct approach to the bridge
called for extensive cuttings, and the
undertaking was of such importance
that the Governor, Sir Dominic Daly,
Kt., came up to open it. Miss Salter
had the honour of christening the new
bridge. (What is known as Fechner’s
Bridge was not built till 1868, and was
christened by Miss Mary Kealley). To
welcome His Excellency, Mr, Jas. Hill,
tinsmith at the Preserving Works, made
a welcome sign of preserve tins, whilst
Mr. Yates sen. led a Band comprising
also James, Charles, Sam and Thos.
Yates, the two Haberechts and Charles
Bauer, Another ford, at Mambre
Brook, remained till 1929, when the
present concrete bridge was built.
How Nuriootpa Got its Name
To revert to the old track; It was
originally made by blacks, at that time
in large numbers here, and having
Nuriootpa as a centre for dealings and
big corroborees. In fact, this was the
source of the town’s name. Charles
Flaxman’s designation “Angas Park”
applied only to a portion of the land,
and is considered to be an adaptation
of the native name. Their own land
they called Para; that on the other
side of the river they called Angas
Para. The Archives Department states
that the name “Nuriootpa” has always
been a puzzle in nomenclature, the most
likely derivation being from the native
word having reference to a place of
barter. The locality was always used
as a central meeting place for natives,
who regarded it as neutral ground.
Blacks from the western country
brought poles and other articles that
Murray River blacks wanted, and Nuri-
ootpa was the native mart.
William Jacob, of Moorooroo, said
he never knew the aborigines to barter
their goods anywhere else. Mrs. I.
Klemm, who lived at Nuriootpa in
1852, said the first name she knew for
the place was Angas Park, and that it
became known as Nuriootpa as the vil-
lage grew and bridges were built. The
blacks used to camp under a gum tree
at a street crossing in the settlement.
They made it a resting place in April
and May when they went to Adelaide
for their annual supplies of blankets;
and there was no doubt the name they
gave the place had a pleasing signifi-
cance (vide Mitchell Library manu-
script of Rodney Cockburn).
A big tribe was more or less per-
manently located at Nuriootpa, an-
other occupied the hills around Angas-
ton, and a third is known to have ex-
isted around Springton and Eden Val-
ley. Not always friendly, they were
a source of concern to families when
the menfolk went for supplies, or were
some distance away clearing or hunt-
ing. The weird sounds they made at
nights mingled with the howling of
dingoes, whilst in summer there was
the ever-present menace of reptiles.
Always the children had to be guard-
ed. Mrs. G. C. Thyer, who came to
Flaxman’s Valley in 1849, told of the
nights of terror when she sat in a hut
lacking doors and windows, her babe
clutched to her breast. Such were the
conditions met by district Lutherans
who landed from the “Prince George”
in 1838, among them: Mr. and Mrs. Ch.
Jantke, Mr. and Mrs. G. Bothe and
family, Mr. and Mrs. G. Petras and
family, Mr. and Mrs, J. G. Schilling
and family, Mr. and Mrs. C. Schilling
and family, Mr. and Mrs. G. Hartmann
and family, Mrs. M. Rau and family,
Mr. and Mrs. J. Kluge and child, Mr.

Mrs. Ch. Zilm and family, Mr. and Mrs.
G. Knispel and family, E. Engelhardt,
A. Thomas, Ch. Rau, Ch. Weber, and
J. and Ch. Knispel.
Mr. Johann Gottfried Schilling and
family, coming to Angaston in 1842,
made their home in a dug-out with
thatch over the top, on the place where
the Bank of Adelaide now stands; and
when Mr, J. H. Angas came to the col-
ony in the following year, Mr. Schill-
ing met him at Port Adelaide and
contract and Jas. Bidge was the build-
er. Considerable difficulty was experi-
enced in getting a firm foundation for
the bridge, which is one of the few
surviving relics of the days when key-
stones were used in such work. The
road, which previously went through
the property left of the present road,
forded the river and came out below
Opening of the Union Church, Penrice Gully, in 1844.

brought him to Lindsay Park in a bul-
lock dray. Mr, Schilling (after whom
Schilling Street was named) acquired
about half a section of land along the
Angaston Creek, up to what now is
Holmes’ Corner, and extending along
Yalumba road. At the corner he built
his large thatched home, where many
early settlers found a welcome on their
arrival in the new land. After a few
years, Mr. Schilling took up several
sections of land; he and Mrs. Schilling
rearing a large family. The property
was subsequently sub-divided into
building blocks as the village extended.
Postal services were inaugurated here
in 1846. From one of Mr. Schilling’s
sons, Christian, another Angaston
street derived its name.
Charles Millyard, who with his sons
Thomas and John, opened up the coun-
try from Springton to the River Rhine,
came out on the “Barduster” in 1839.
Mrs. Millyard (nee Mary Green), com-
ing in the same year in the “Prince
Regent,” went with her husband to
Springton in 1843 —and for nearly five
years the couple did not see another
white person. Mr. Andreas Dallwitz,
who came out with his parents, Mr.
and Mrs. Johann Dallwitz, in February,
1847, and lived for some time at
Angaston, told a similar story of the
trials that beset pioneers, and of how
the natives roamed the hills and came
to the huts of settlers for bread or
anything else they could beg. Mr. Wm.
Chinner can recall corroborees on the
flat that now is Murray street, and the
difficulties attendant on getting sup-
plies from Adelaide per bullock dray
over the rough bush track.
In 1843, Mr. G. F, Angas sent his
eldest son, John Howard Angas (then
19) to manage his estates in the new
country, and with him on the “Madras”
came also Mr. and Mrs. Henry Evans
(the latter being Mr. G, F. Angas’s sec-
ond daughter) and their infant son,
Henry Angas Evans. Mr, Evans sett-
led first at German Pass, then after
building the old Lindsay Park home-
stead, moved to Keyneton. He intro-
duced to that district more cattle, sheep
and horses, and started fruitgrowing.
Comes here the link with one of An-
gaston’s first public buildings the
Union Church in Penrice Gully, erect-
ed in 1844 with a large contribution
from Mr, Angas, in order that settlers
might have a free place of worship,
irrespective of class or creed. For the
Baptists a baptismal cavity was built
in. It was, in fact, Mr. Angas’s ideals
of religious freedom, combined with
admiration of Teutonic industry, that
prompted him to help so many Ger-
man settlers to the colony; settlers who
founded Klemzig and Tanunda.
The discovery of copper on the pro-
perty of Mr, Dutton and Capt. Bagot
at Kapunda in 1843, practically brought
Nuriootpa into being, and it was about
this time that Mr. William Coulthard
built the first hotel in Nuriootpa —a
two-roomed place of slabs on the site
of the present Nuriootpa Hotel. Two
years later the Burra mines opened,
adding to the importance of Nuriootpa
as a camping place on the track to and
from Adelaide. Another track was be-
ing made toward the River, and where
the trails branched at Nuriootpa, it
was not an uncommon sight to see up
to 200 bullocks herded along the banks
of the Para, whilst camps were scat-
tered about the flat. It was not till
1854, however, that Mr, William Coul-
thard laid out the township.
Colonisation was proceeding rapidly
around the ’thirties, Mr. Johann
Gramp, who came in 1837, ten years
later began wine-making operations at
Rowlands Flat; Mr. James Trescowth-
ick was proving that first class fruit
could be grown in Flaxman’s Valley;
William Salter and his son Edward
(1839) were planting vines in the gully
near Angaston that bears his name,
and some of those vines are still bear-
ing. Joseph Keynes started in 1839
to develop Keyneton as sheep-raising
country, a purpose in which his son,
Richard R. (who came in 1857) ma-
terially helped. Samuel Smith (1845)
and later his son Sidney, were found-
ing Yalumba Winery, and William
Hum in 1850 began his tree nursery,
Mr. and Mrs. J. G. Schilling (1838)
and development of “Springhead” as a
grazing proposition, devoted then to
dairying. Henry Holmes arrived in
1839, and it was his son Charles who,
in 1862, established the carrying ser-
vice maintained to-day by the latter’s
son Walter (although it does not now
extend to Adelaide and Freeling as in
the early days).
In 1844 there was a small cottage
where now Angaston Hostel stands,
and Mr. Jas. Wishart was offered the
large block for £3O. The main road,
however, lay through Penrice, and Mr.
Wishart chose to build there. The old
two-storey building (clearly seen in a
picture elsewhere of fruit waggons)
was built in 1849 by Thos. Nock and
his son-in-law, Samuel Kealley, who
had purchased the block. It is inter-
esting here to note how the value in-
creased. The post office was there in
1879, Miss Windscheid being in charge.
Mr. Prince had portion for a baker’s
shop, the business being purchased by
Herbert Parish, who offered about
£2300 for the property. It was declin-
ed. Mr. Geo. Cadd then took the build-
ing over and for many years conduct-
ed a boarding house and shop there.
In 1928 it was bought by Mrs. Gaert-
ner, Freeling, whose son-in-law, Mr.
Ted Dohnt, carried on for a time. It
reverted to the Kealley family, and
was bought by Mr. John Dallwitz and
razed in 1929. Now the site carries a
modern Tourists’ Hostel.
Getting back again to 1846, copper
lodes were being discovered near An-
gaston, one yielding 33 per cent. In
the early ’fifties the Crinnes Mine was
opened, but it was not until 1857 that
gold was found in Tanunda Creek, and
led to formation of the Angaston Pros-
pecting Syndicate in 1896. There was
a revival in 1906, when among the con-
cerns floated were Angaston Golden
Mile, Angaston Gold Mining Syndicate
and the Golden Gate Company. The
first had £4,000 capital, the second
£I,OOO, and the last-named £21,600.
Golden Gate (still being worked by
fossickers) once had a return of 149/-
per ton on 159 tons of ore. The North
Rhine Copper Mines were operating in
1856, continuing till 1860, when flood-
ed shafts stopped operations and the
plant was moved to Wallaroo. Moppa

gold mines came into prominence in
1892, but by 1896 had petered out.
Mr. Ben Butler re-opened them in 1900
when 21 ozs. was obtained from 4£
tons of ore.
Shean (1850), Edward B. Scott, Will-
iam Wright, John Fairclough, William
Plant and Edward A. Schulze (1852).
The survey had been applied for by
Charles Flaxman, who selected 4,000
acres, in 1839. Some of the first land-
holders in the vicinity of Nuriootpa
were; Matthias Lange (1846), Gott-
fried Handke (1849); Carl F. Keller,
Johann W. Kriebel, James and Robt.
Frew, Christoph Warnest, Christian
Hahn (all 1850); Johann C. Mattner,
J. F. Lange, Henrietta Smith, Wilhelm
Pfeiffer, Wm. R. S. Cooke, Johann C.
F. Houser, Johann Sporn; Phillip,
Levi and John Hallett, Anthony For-
ster, John Ridley (1851); Gottlieb
Schultz, Carl Kriebel, Gottlieb Grocke,
Gottfried Kruschel, Heinrich Luhrs,
Samuel Teppich, Gottlieb Teppich, Jo-
hann Kleinig, Andreas Schneider, Jo-
hann Pannach (1852); Fredk. Wright,

and John Wirsing, Gottlieb Wirsing,
Gottlob Obst, William Coulthard, John
Hector, Gottfried Kappler, Ludwig
Russack, Carl F. Graetz, Carl F. Ditt-
rich, John Mickan, Luke M. Cullen, A.
G. Roesler and G. Noack (1853).
Among early purchasers of land in
Angaston were Henry Holmes, George
Watson (1846); William Crabb, Wm.
A. Hughes (1847); James Joyce, Sam-
uel Kealley (1848); and William Dod-
dridge and David Yickerstaff (1849).
Around 1847 the colony suffered a seri-
ous lack of coinage, and some peculiar
entries in the books of that time indi-
cate many payments in kind. The
Bransons came to Greenock in 1847;
Miss Ellen, a surviving daughter, hav-
ing a record of 40 years as Method-
ist organist, led the singing for 51
years, and was S.S. superintendent for
21 years. Theodore Schell was among
the first white children born at Nuri-
ootpa, whilst Carl Krieg (born 1861)
was eldest of a family of twelve of
Mr. and Mrs. Carl Krieg, The son,
Carl, who married Dorothea Kalleske,
daughter of Greenock pioneers, was
for 20 years from 1885 in his father’s
tannery at Nuriootpa, where his uncle,
had the brickyards then.
It was in 1847 that Angaston’s first
cemetery was laid out, the first inter-
ment, on May 5, being William Deni-
thorne, who had been associated with
the mines at Greenock. The district’s
mining engineer was Captain Rodda,
who laid out Penrice, and died there
in 1861. To accommodate the influx
of miners, Mr. Edward Salter built the
houses near the stone-arch bridge that
were known as the miners’ cottages.
Before passing from Captain Rodda,
mention must be made of the sinking
of the Crinnes mine during the early
’fifties. Captain Rodda was largely as-
sociated with this venture that yielded
some valuable copper. On the opening
day people came from all parts of the
district, and the honours were com-
pleted with the roasting of a bullock
that all might be catered for. Lack-
ing modern facilities, however, the mine
had subsequently to be abandoned on
account of water filling the shafts. A
portion of the old chimney still stands
on Mr, H, G. Salter’s property. Cap-
tain Rodda owned almost all the land
in and around Penrice, and built the
first flour mill there.
Early Nuriootpa Settlers
It has been previously stated that
Nuriootpa was laid out in 1854, and
to elaborate this it is necessary to get
back to 1841, when Section 156, Hun-
dred of Nuriootpa, on which the town
was laid out, was surveyed by William
Jacob, and granted to William Coul-
thard in 1850. Although the plan of
Nuriootpa was deposited in the Regis-
try Office in 1856, allotments in the
town were conveyed by William Coul-
thard prior to that year. Some of the
first purchasers were: Hans T, Isaach-
sen, Christian W. H, J. Lange, Andrew
The first train to Angaston, September 8, 1911. The line from Gawler to
Nuriootpa was opened on May 15, 1911. The length from Gawler to Ang-
aston is 26 miles 51 chains, and the capital cost of construction, £238,332.
Louisa M. Roenfeldt, Greenock, was
born at Hope Valley in 1843, being a
daughter of Johann Gramp (1837).
John Lowke, teacher for fifty years,
was also born locally, and later mar-
ried Miss A. R. John. He was for 64
years a Lutheran Church organist. In
1844, Rev. W. Oldham (Independent)
was minister in the little church just
built in Penrice Gully. Rev. G. Stone-
house represented the Baptists, who,
ten years later erected their own
church in Angaston, and Rev. James
Sawle was here in 1847. So rapidly
had the settlement grown that postal
facilities were extended in 1846, the
telegraph line coming 20 years later.
Mr. G. F„ Angas came out and settled
here in 1851, and two years afterwards
the Angaston District Council area
was proclaimed. By 1856 Shows were
being held.
Angaston’s requirements were sup-
plied by the Radford Bros., with whom
in 1855 James Hague became associat-
ed, he having come out from Manches-
ter with his brother Edward. Hermann
Radford was a butcher; Edwin was a
carpenter. Jas. Hague was engaged
by Samuel Kealley to manage a branch
store at Nuriootpa, but in 1860 he
opened a store on his own account at
Penrice, transferring to Angaston in
1861 when, with his brother, they be-

Mr. and Mrs. Garrett, whose son, Charles, was born
there, were developing Rocky Valley in 1851. Wil-
liam Clark (whose sons have just donated 2£ acres
of land in Dean Street for a reserve) had been
closely allied with Mr. G. F. Angas in the manage-
ment of the estate, and he became Angaston’s first
land and estate agent; being succeeded by his son,
Augustus. Eldest son of the Lobethal pioneer, Fer-
dinand Zimmermann, Johann F. was born in 1855,
and later came to Nuriootpa. He took over the
Angas Park Hotel for two years; was a teacher,
Clerk then Chairman of Mobilong Council; married
Miss Maria Louise Paech, daughter of another pion-
eering family; and was founder of Nuriootpa Race
Club with £4O stake, in 1900. A series of wet race
days eliminated it, then in 1906 Mr. Zimmermann
revived the fixture with Mr. W, Coulthard as presid-
ent; later, however, it lapsed again. George Lem-
mon was the next licensee at Angas Park Hotel,
and Mr. Zimmermann afterwards returned to con-
duct a store at Nuriootpa.
Carl Domeyer was Nuriootpa’s butcher in
1855, and used to walk to Angaston delivering or-
ders. Johann Erhard Gramp, who later took over
the Angaston properties of Gottlieb Geusch and W.
Trescowthick, was born at Rowlands Flat in 1856.
Mr. Hatch was Nuriootpa carrier then, and his son,
George, was born in 1860, working subsequently
with John Coulthard. The blacks were so trouble-
some at Nuriootpa during the early ’sixties that a
stockade had to be built around the little homes. The
Nuriootpa School appeared on a list of 36 erected
or in progress by 1859; the first head teacher being
James Poole in 1860, when 28 children attended.
Mr. Poole resigned toward end of the year and
there was no master for a while. In 1876 the
School was transferred to the Council of Education,
and in 1878 the Moorooroo Board of Advice was
formed, comprising Thos. W. Charlesworth, M.A.,
Wm, Strother and Nicholas Player. In 1879 a new
schoolroom was built, and completed on December
30. In 1922, Nuriootpa became a Higher Primary
School; later reaching High School status; whilst in
1937 it is expected that the building of a High
School will have been accomplished. Successive
head teachers have been: Jas. Poole 1861, Carl Taeu-
ber 1863, Price C. Jervis 1864, William Gunther in
1870, Otto Tepper 1873, Thos. A. James 1878, Wm.

Again taking up the thread in 1860, Angaston
Block 14 Company was operating with 20 men get-
ting out stone and keeping 18 waggons going—the
agitation for a railway from Gawler having been
started, A commission in 1874 advised construc-
tion of a line from Adelaide to Murray Bridge and
one through Kapunda to Morgan; but far-sighted
John Howard Angas urged a main-line connection
with Melbourne by way of Barossa Valley on to
Blanchetown, thence to the Victorian border, and
his plan visualised a connection from Blanchetown
through Wentworth to Sydney. Other interests
got the line over the Mt. Lofty Ranges, the Morgan
line was sanctioned shortly afterwards, and not
until 1907 did Parliament sanction the line to Ang-
aston.
Mr. and Mrs. Johann August Riedel landed
in 1863, and made their way to Nuriootpa, where
18 months later Mr. Riedel opened as shoemaker;
the business afterwards being carried on by his
son Gustav Heinrich Otto, who was five when they
came out. After nine years in business, Otto Rie-
del became a teacher at North Rhine, and in 1926
was farewelled after 37 years’ work in the Luther-
an School. During that time he was organist in the
North Rhine Lutheran Church, conducted the choir
and was cornetist in North Rhine Band. In 1862
H. E. Olafsen had a watchmaker’s shop at Nuri-
ootpa and did business in Angaston also. He took
over the Angas Park Hotel in after years, and sub-
sequently became barman for Mrs. McDonald at
the Commercial Hotel, Angaston. Also in 1862,
Charles Holmes began his carrying service.
Tragedy, too, had its place, for on his 21st
birthday (August 30, 1872) James and Isabella
Heard, of Angaston, were suddenly bereft of their
fourth son, James. He had gone the long trip to
Adelaide in his dray to get supplies, and on the an-
niversary of his birth was thrown from his seat on
the dray, a wheel passing over him with fatal re-
sults. In was in this year that the savings Bank

opened at Angaston. Also in 1872
the stone wall over Sedan Hill was built
by J. Harris sen., of Towitta and his
brother-in-law, Mr. Tremlett. Mr Thos.
Ludlow (born 1854) came to Angaston
with his young bride (Eliza A. Ragg-
att, 1856) in 1874 and opened his
coachbuilding and painting business.
By this time the Nuriootpa Flour Mill
was in operation, worked by Carl H.
A. Ludewig (landed 1872) in partner-
ship with Mr. Bock; Mr. Ludewig hav-
ing previously worked in his uncle’s
mill at Greenock.
1881, another at the International Ex-
hibition in New Zealand in 1882, one at
the N.S.W. Royal Show, and a fourth
at Gawler Show on March 13, 1884.
In regard to wheat, Chas. and Dave
Radford were getting 50-bushel crops
off land near Angaston. Chas. Tres-
Oowthick was Angaston photographer
in 1884; Wm. and C. Zeuner were
mail contractors, and behind Rev. John
Hannay’s was the baptismal pool. Mr.
J. H. Angas in 1886 gave an 18 ct.
gold medal worth £3O for the best stu-
dent (practical and scientific) at Rose-
worthy College; the first winner being
W. G. Treloar (now Truro Council
Clerk). Matthew Netted was black-
smith in 1880, and in 1888 F, Leach
sen. had Angaston Hotel.
Greenock Sports started in 1890
with Rudolph Tummel as secretary;
the Oddfellows’ Lodge, under whose
auspices they were conducted, having
as its secretary for 43 years Mr. W.
B. Seebo. Messrs. H. B. Nenke, C.
Kobelt and Julius Nenke were others
prominently associated with the sports,
for which Matt. Schluter has now been
secretary for 36 years.
On the staff of R, Tummel’s store
at Greenock in 1897 was Julius Wm.
Mattiske, who, in partnership with G.
Heinrich, went into a store at Stock-
well, extending in 1904 to Tanunda,
where the business of Heinrich and
Mattiske was founded. Mr. Mattiske
subsequently joined Mr. T. Sage in
the Angas Park Preserving Co., of
which the former was managing direc-
tor. In 1912 he bought Salter’s Pack-
ing Shed at Angaston.
Barossa Masonic Lodge, No. 49, re-
ceived its warrant on November 9,
1905, the initial meeting being held
in the Baptist Schoolroom. Wpl. Bro.
Dr. D. Carr was first W.M., and had
as Wardens Bros. R. H, Ball and G.
Heinrich; Wpl. Bro. G. Sharp as D.C.,
and Bro, J. C. Williams as secretary.
Past Masters still associated with the
Lodge are Wpl. Bros. C. H. Ohlmeyer,

Wpl. Bro. F. J, Rosenberg.
Weddings in 1875 were interesting
events, following on feather-picking
parties. When Mr. and Mrs. Johann
Gustav Rudiger, Moculta, were mar-
ried on April 15, 1875, they arrived at
Light’s Pass Church in a springless
German waggon drawn by two horses;
the waggon having been used, drawn
by two bullocks, when Mrs, Rudiger’s
parents (Mr, and Mrs. Johann G. Stie-
ler; the former, carpenter at Light’s
Pass in 1858) made their trips to
Light’s Pass from Moculta, where they
settled around 1860.
Angaston Show then had a section
for shearers in which Mr. J. G. Rudi-
ger competed in a class of 28; a dinner
being held that night. Shearers got
up to 18/- per hundred, whilst general
wages ranged from 8/- to 30/- and
35/- in the good times. Wheat was
down to 1/6 a bushel and soared to
7/-; butter in the difficult seasons was
sold for 6d. per lb.; eggs brought 3d,
a dozen.
1880 found fruitgrowing extensively
developed; Jas. Forbes being manager
of Angaston Fruit Preserving Com-
pany, with which were associated John
Archibald and Mr. Young (secretary).
The factory was east of the foot of
Bald Hill, and 25/- per cwt. was paid
for apricots and peaches; quinces were
worth 5/- a case. This company won
a medal at Adelaide Royal Show in
Prior to the advent of the railway, thousands of cases of fruit had to be carted
from Angaston. Pictured here is one of the caravans which in 1901 shifted
2200 cases of apples (mostly Cleopatra) to Port Adelaide for export. The
teams shown are those of Messrs. A. Salter, Chas. Holmes (2), H. Finn (2), W.
Patching, Sam Giles, Sam Brooks and W, Giles.
Participating in the International
Rifle Match of 1905 were Mr. and Mrs
E. S. Matthews, Tarrawatta. They
scored heavily for the Lord Roberts
Cross in bronze, and gained medals
in interstate competition, Mrs. Mat-
thews won Tarrawatta open champion-
ship silver cup; two gold medals and
the open championship at Victor Har-
bour; and a silver bowl at Tarrawat-
ta. Mr. Matthews won Tanunda Small
Bore Championship, Victor Harbour
gold medal, and Tarrawatta gold med-
al for highest score over the three
ranges. He also won the city open
championship and his name is on the
Association shield, finally won by G.
Pumpa (Eden Valley) third time.
And here this outline must close —
not because of any lack of material,
but because of the limitations of the
booklet. Perhaps in 1941, when the
district will complete its own first hun-
dred years, “The Leader” will be pri-
vileged to again take up the threads
so regretfully laid aside now.
Angaston is 1138 ft above sea level;

Bank of Adelaide was the first
to offer banking facilities to
the men on the land and as-
sist settlement by advancing
freely. In those districts the
Bank of Adelaide blazed the
trail.
The Bank of Adelaide is
a South Australian Bank, the
only private bank having its
head office in Adelaide. It is
thus able to give immediate
decisions on all matters sub-
mitted for consideration. The
interests of the Bank are
identical with those of the

spells prosperity for the oth-
er. The Bank of Adelaide

District Council Valuation Grows to £1,058,400 in Eighty Years
Angaston Council was formed on
June 20, 1853, when William Salter,
Dr. Horace Dean, Richard Rodda and
William Coulthard were appointed by
the Governor, Sir Henry Young, Kt.
George Fife Angas was appointed by
the Council, but did not take office
until January 10, 1854, At the initial
meeting the oath was taken on motion
of Crs. Rodda and Salter; Cr. Dean
being elected Chairman. At the next
meeting Cr. Salter was elected treasur-
er. Applications were called for the
position of Clerk at £lO per annum;
but there was no response, and it was
not until March 18, 1854, that Mr. C.
von Bertouch was appointed at a sal-
ary of £l2O per annum.
As the Police force in these early
days had few officers in the country,
Councils appointed special constables,
who were duly sworn in and supplied
with stout staves. Those appointed
for Angaston district a month after
the Council had been formed were
Messrs. George Liersch, Gottfried Schil-
ling, Humphrey Peppered, Samuel
Klemm, Herman Radford, Jas. Rossi-
ter and Stephenson H. Scaife,
the object of the meeting was fully
gone into.
First Rate Was 1/- in the £
The Council suggested a rate of 2/-
in the £. Messrs. Foott and Radford
were of opinion that this would be too
big a hardship on settlers, and moved
that the rate be 1/-; their proposition
being carried by a large majority. Of
the amount of the original assessment
there is no record, but rates actually
collected for the year 1853-54 totalled
£314/13/-. A Government Grant of
£3BO was obtained, bringing the Coun-
cil’s income for the year to £7Bl/11/74.
The expenditure amounted to only £215
5/10, leaving a credit balance of £566
5/94. Eighty-three years later (at
June 30, 1936) rates collected amount-
ed to £3872/14/6, Government Grants
were £2089/10/-, and the total re-
ceipts £7200/9/9.
The Council’s comparatively large
surplus in 1854, and failure of crops
in 1855, induced Council to refrain
from levying a rate in that year. In
1856 a rate of 1/- in the £ was again
declared, and as it was estimated to
yield £460/17/9, the assessed value of
properties in the area at that time must
have been £9,217; or a total value in
fee simple of £184,355.
Possibly the most accurate indica-
tion of district progress is afforded by
the steady improvement in values till
1920, after which the total soared. At
beginning of the present decade there
was a drop in land values due to the
world-wide economic chaos; but the fol-
lowing table is indicative of the dist-
rict’s remarkable growth:
Rates for the years 1856, 1886 and
1911 were 1/- in the £; in 1920, 1/54
in the £; and in 1936, 1/6 in the £.
The peak rate was 1/8 several years
ago. From 1911 onward a health rate
was also levied. The present rate of
1/6 in the £ produces the following
amounts from the various Wards:
Ward Fee simple Annual Rate
South 369,880 18,494 1,387
North 86,260 4,313 323
Nuriootpa 329,380 16,469 1,235
Moculta 83,040 4,152 311
Stockwell 82,560 4,128 309
Flax. Valley ... 107,280 5,364 402
The Council embraces an area of
95 square miles, within which there
are 29 miles of main roads and 207
miles of district roads; a total of 236
miles. Prior to 1922 meetings were held
in various buildings, then at the In-
stitute for some years, and then in
that year the present Chambers were
erected on the corner of Murray Street
and Volunteer Avenue, at a cost of
£1,138; Mr, G. N. Dallwitz being the
contractor.
Get £2,584 Road Plant
Angaston Council in 1925 pioneered
the system of penetrating macadam-
ised roads with bitumen, a section at
the Nuriootpa railway entrance being
experimentally treated. This proved a
success, and a big stretch from Angas-
ton Post Office to the National Bank
was done in 1928, having since requir-
ed only one dressing. The Council’s
most ambitious undertaking, however,
was the installation in 1927 of its own
stone-crushing and road-making plant.
The Penrice marble quarry was opened
in 1921, and for a time work was done
by contract; the Wards later supplying
their own men. In 1926 the Council
put 3074 cubic yards of spalls from
this quarry onto main roads in connec-
tion with the Local Government De-
partment scheme for reconstruction of
important highways.
G. W. Chinner, 16 Years Chairman
The first assessment was prepared
by Mr. J. S. Plush for £l5, and notices
were printed in English and German
calling a meeting to declare a rate.
The settlers were informed of what
the Council had done, but refused to
take any action in regard to declaring
a rate. Council felt the necessity of
making highways, clearing spaces and
beginning such other progressive acts
as would develop the settlement. A
further meeting was called for Feb-
ruary 20, 1854, and Cr. A, Shannon
presided over a good attendance. He
1856 1886 1911 1920 1936
asked ,the German-speaking residents Capital Value £184,355 £292,460 £493,700 £670,660 £1,058,400

The Council at that stage was ad-
vised that the Department was unable
to send up its own plant; but made
an offer, accepted by the Council, un-
der which the latter installed its own
road-making plant on a subsidised bas-
is. The total cost was £2,584/17/2;

Although the plant was designed to
operate right at the job, it was found
that repeated handling of metal made
this uneconomical. Representations
were made to the Electric Supply Co.
to extend their mains to the Penrice
quarry, and when this was done the
crusher, electrically powered, was in-
stalled as a permanent unit, advan-
taged by further modifications. The
metal is now tipped direct into the
crusher, which deposits it in bins from
which it pours into trucks that can
be driven beneath.
The quarry is conducted as a separ-
ate concern with subsidiary banking
account; Wards and private users hav-
ing to pay for metal taken. The Coun-
cil’s financial statement on June 30
last showed that earnings had been
£2,209, expenditure £1,916; leaving a
surplus for the year of £292/13/6.
Since installation of the plant, con-
struction of roads by contract has prac-
tically ceased; the Council employing
its own men with special knowledge
of the work. The highest outlay in
wages and salaries was in 1933, when
£4,428 was paid. Last year payments
under this heading totalled £3,820.

POSTAL SERVICES IN 1846, AND THE OLD MAIL COACH DAYS
Postal service was established in An-
gaston in 1846; money order facilities
being extended in 1859, and telegraph
communication with Adelaide in 1866.
In the very early days the business was
transacted by a local agent, but in
1866, Ebenezer Keynes was duly ap-
pointed as first postmaster and oper-
ated the service in conjunction with
his drapery store, then situated in the
row of buildings razed six years ago
to make room for the modern bunga-
lows east of the Guide Hall.
In 1867, Samuel Kealley took over
the duties, he at that time having a
general store on a site just west of
the Tourist Hostel. A few years after-
ward, this place was burnt down, and
Mr. Kealley moved into the two-storey
building he and his father-in-law, Thos.
Nock, erected in 1849. A son, Frank
Kealley, took over the Post Office in
1877, and two years later Miss M. A.
Windscheid had charge in the same
building.
AT NURIOOTPA
Nuriootpa records indicate that the
first duly appointed Postmaster was
Mr. W, Strother, in 1866, when tele-
graphic facilities were extended to the
town; Mr. Jervis being the operator
and having the equipment in the school
building. Mr. E. M. Marsh came in
1875, and after three years, Miss Wind-
scheid took over and held the office for
a year. She was then moved to the
Angaston Office, and Miss R. Kealley
filled the position from 1879 till 1883,
when Miss N. G. Gliddon came.
In 1879, Mr. Wm. Chinner assisted
Mr, Burnett, an Adelaide contractor,
to erect what is virtually the present
Post Office, although in 1927 it was
reconstructed and enlarged. Miss M.
A. Windscheid continued as Postmist-
ress until 1883, when Miss R. Kealley
was appointed; being succeeded five
years later by Mrs. A. I. Shoebridge.
In 1900 Mrs. M. C. Crawley was in
charge, and when Mr. J. Inglis came
in 1906, telephones were coming into
use, Yalumba and the doctor having
the first lines. Mr. J. S. Phillips was
appointed in 1920, and the present P.
M,, Mr. H, H. W, Storch, assumed
office in 1921, On January 1, 1922,
continuous telephone service was secur-
ed, there being 144 subscribers con-
nected to this exchange to-day.
Mr. Perry started this run in 1878
and maintained it for 34 years. Green-
ock then was a camping place for over-
landers and all the waggons from the
Plains to Freeling. Carl F, Handke
had a smithy there about 1854, moving
later to Lyndoch where he married
Miss Lydia Zils. Mr, J. F. C. Jaensch,
who was Greenock blacksmith in 1870,
considered Thos. Perry one of the fin-
est men in the colony with a five-horse
team, his only accident being on Goad’s
Hill when a wheel came off and the
coach capsized. Mr. Jaensch, who af-
ter 50 years handed the business to his
son, contended that Greenock in the
early ’nineties put up some of the best
fights in the State. The old drovers
who used to camp there would back
themselves for £5 —among the champ-
ions being Mick Slattery, Ike Hitch-
cock, Chris. Pollard, Chris. Bartel and
Jim Kennedy. Sam Heath came from
Swan Reach to take over the hotel,
which later passed to Mr. Boettcher,
who subsequently went to Angaston,
and then to Broken Hill. Late in the
’nineties, W. E. Petney (schooled at
Truro with Edwin Baird, Will Miller
and others) had the mail line in the
other direction from Angaston. For
22 years he took the mail coach to
Sedan. Later the run was extended
to Swan Reach. He carried the first
mail there, and continued for 6i years.
Miss F. M. Mitford was her successor
in 1885, her long term of office ending
in 1912, when Miss E. A. Harwood
became postmistress. The first tele-
phone—to Messrs. Tolley, Scott and
Tolley’s—was connected in 1914, and
by 1916 the business had grown suffi-
ciently to justify a postmaster. Mr.
T, F, H. Walker was appointed, and
was succeeded by Mr. C. R. Dudley
at the close of a year; Mr. D. M.
Hawke taking charge two years later.
Mr. J. A. Davies came in 1924, whilst
during the following year the up-to-
date Post Office pictured elsewhere was
evolved from the old premises. On
August 4, 1928, Mr, A, F. Kealley, the
present postmaster, was appointed.
The big winery at the western en-
trance to Angaston—now the Vintners
—was opened as Wynvale Winery by
Cr, G. W. Chinner on March 6, 1928.
Mr. Reginald Collins was governing
director, and Mr, C. A. Pollitt the
manager in South Australia. After a
few years the concern was bought by
the Vintners Company Limited,
Mr. Thas. Perry and the Angaston-Freeling Mail Coach.

Mr. G. N. Dallwitz, widely known
Angaston builder who, among other
large buildings, erected the new High
School at Clare, started business in
1912, the first contract being a house
now occupied by Mr. Bartsch adjoining
Angaston Bowling Green. In 1914-15
there was a serious lull in the building-
trade, and during the period Mr. Dall-
witz took up ordinary labour at 6/- per
day of nine hours. Brightening in 1916,
trade became very brisk within a few
years, and as there was a shortage of
bricks, cement and galvanized iron, Mr.
Dallwitz, to cope with his contracts,
had to take over Penrice Brickyards in
January, 1919. He continued there till
1929, during which time over three mil-
lion bricks were produced. As the de-
mand still exceeded supplies, he bought
six acres of ground at Gawler late in
1922 and erected kilns, drying sheds
and plant in record time. From Janu-
ary, 1923 until he sold out some years
later, an average of 20,000 bricks a
week were manufactured. The busi-

ness was during this period expanding.
On the large number of homes and
commercial buildings within a 75-mile
radius of Angaston, Mr. Dallwitz at
times had as many as 45 men employed
in the building trade alone. The peak
was reached in 1927-8, when he paid
£8360 in wages; 90 per cent, to men
living in the district. For some years
Mr. Dallwitz carried on the business
known as Dallwitz Limited, Nuriootpa,
now conducted by Mr. H. L. Sheard.
Mr. Dallwitz, who in February, 1932,
was made a Justice of the Peace, has
been associated with almost every com-
munity institution in the district, in-
cluding the Show, Hospital Board, Bar-
ossa Masonic Lodge, Flower Show and
Liedertafel. He holds that nothing
can take the place of persistence—tal-
ent will not do it, genius often is un-
rewarded, the world is full of educated
men who are failures; but determin-
ation stands alone as the vital factor
in achieving success. “Press on,” he
adds, always has solved the problems
of the human race, and always will.

AngaSton Guide Hall was Baptist Church, Built in 1854
The venerable building, opened for
its last service on April 28, 1929, and
since has been Angaston Girl Guide
Hall, once was a Baptist Church, with
a history full of incident. It was built
in 1854, the foundation stone being
laid by the Hon. G. F, Angas, M.L.C.,
in November of that year, and the Rev.
James Sawle being the first minister.
The movement to establish this church,
however, began on June 18, 1849, when
a meeting was held at the residence of
Mr. James Smith. The Rev. T, Q. Stow
attended by invitation, and the gather-
ing included seven independents, four
Baptists and one Presbyterian.
Rev. James Sawle accepted office as
pastor of the new body; Mr. Kealley
being appointed secretary and treasur-
er in connection with a subscription
list that was thereupon opened, and
for which Messrs. Smith and Radford
were canvassers. At a public meeting
on April 22, 1853, it was reported that
£6BB/13/7 was in hand, so appointment
of trustees was proceeded with, those
chosen being Messrs. James Sawle,
Samuel Kealley, Samuel Smith, Henry
Evans, John Howard Angas, William
Salter, Thomas Radford, James Smith,
William Oldham and Henry Giles.
Mr. J. H. Angas previously owned
the property upon which the church
was built. The architects were Messrs.
Cocking & Aggett, Adelaide. Under
the trust deed, to which the names of
Charles Masters, William Yates and
Ebenezer Keynes were added in 1855,
the building was simply designated as
a Chapel for Divine Worship. The
original cost was £2,679/3/2, and sub-
sequent alterations to the roof added
£300; £2,979 in all.
When the congregation left the old
Community Church in Penrice Gully,
they had £7 in hand; Paedo-Baptists
subscribed £857, Baptists £1,618; the
general public contributed £408; pro-
ceeds of a bazaar at the opening were
£278; and sale of the scaffolding yield-
ed £9. In April, 1855, the Rev. John
Hannay became minister at a salary of
£2OO a year, and during six years of
his ministry, 68 names were added to
the membership, which then included
28 Paedo-Baptists and 41 Baptists.
Over the signatures of Samuel Smith,
Henry Evans, William Salter and Wil-
liam Yates, church members received
early in 1860 a letter indicating that
it was the belief of many that the min-
ister had departed from the original
conception of a Union Church as in-
dicated in the trust deed. Legal opin-
A view of Angaston in 1896, with the Post Office in the foreground, Angas-
ton Hotel and behind it the old Market Place and the Congregational Church
ion was sought, and favoured this con-
tention. A special meeting was held
on May 15, 1861, whereat Messrs. Keal-
ley and Clark moved that the church
be regarded as a Congregational
Church, managing its own affairs. An-
other motion by Messrs. David Ran-
dall and Gates was to effect that the
building was not the property of the
Baptists nor any particular denomin-
ation; and yet a further one by Messrs.
Masters and Wishart held that the
attitude and conduct of the minister
had not been at variance with the prin-
ciples set out in the trust deed.
Records seem to indicate that the
contentious subject was the introduc-
tion of baptism by immersion, which
had been carried out by Mr. Hannay
at a pool in the river just, behind what
is now Dr. Drever’s residence. Feel-
ing became so intense that the issue
was taken to court. The Hon. G. F.
Angas said he had given the land for
a Union Church. Wisely he added that
it was a virtue of liberty to have the
right to differ, and it appeared to him
a non-essential point whether the sub-
ject for baptism went to the water, or
the water was brought to him.
Church deacons during this troublous
period were Thomas Radford, Charles
Masters and James Wishart. The Sun-
day School was shown during the court
case to have been in existence before
the Church, it having been decided at
a meeting on October 30, 1849, to
identify the school with the church,
and that Mr. Nesbit be asked to act
as superintendent. Mr. Smith was the
next superintendent, and a move made
in 1858 to separate the school from the
church was resisted. The Bible Class
of that period included William Chin-
ner, Mary Chinner, John Williams,
Catherine Venning, Eliza Charlotte
Gates, Joseph Dunkley Gates, S. A.
Player and Maria Kealley, who held
that Rev. Hannay had not in any way
influenced that body.
The Congregational Church was
built after the legal decision, and Mr.
Hannay received from 57 members of
his congregation a letter of appreci-
tion of his ministry. With the excep-
tion of one year, the Baptist Union
had contributed toward maintenance of
a minister here, and when Rev. John
Hannay concluded his work, there fol-
lowed the Revds. William Clare, P.
Lush, Geo. Berry, James Barker; Pas-
tor E. H. Kentish; Revds. William Gil-
mour, E. J. Henderson; Pastor Drum-
mond, Rev. J. Paynter, Pastor H. W.


Masters, Rev. W. N. Campbell, Rev. H.
D. Archer, Pastor Christian, Rev. F. J.
Steward, Pastor H. L. Vawser, Rev.
J. A. L. Ramsey, Rev. S. A. Paris, Rev.
C. O. Lundberg and Pastor A. P.
Mann.
Mr. Jas. Wishart was secretary for
many years, and was followed by Mr.
Robert Perry, Mr. Thos. Ludlow, and
Mr. W. Patching (9 years), then Mr.
Wilf. S. Smith in the closing stages.
Mrs. W. Patching was for many years
associated with this and the Methodist
Sunday Schools, giving 40 years’ ser-
vice altogether. Among the successive
organists have been Mrs. W. Salter,
Miss Ruth Chinner, Mrs. Swann, Miss
Kealley, Miss Nock, Miss Ada Cadd,
Miss F. Perry and Mr. Hedley Blue,
Mrs. C. H. Turner (14 years), Miss
Emmie Short (10 years), Mrs. A.
Thamm (whose talented daughter Bar-
bara is now an A.L.C.M.), Mr. Percy
Jarrett, Mrs. W. Patching and Mrs.
C. O. Lundberg.
During Mr. Robt. Perry’s time the
church had a fine orchestra, and as
many as 24 choristers sang to the ac-
companiment of the eight musicians.
These, under Mr. W. Bruce Smith (in-
strumentalist and conductor) were
Miss J. Trescowthick, Mrs. Atkinson,

church came from the Lindsay House
property, and the beautiful carving
over the main entrance was done by
Thomas Osborne. For many years the
Baptist Union also owned the proper-
ty on the hillside of the road leading
south past Angaston pumping station;
and it was used as the Manse.

Mr. W. Salter presided, and Rev. W.
Oldham was secretary of a public meet-
ing held in Angaston on May 4, 1847,
for the purpose of establishing a public
Cemetery. Mr. J. H. Angas, on behalf
of his father, offered a choice of sev-
eral sites, and the meeting accepted an
acre in what then was the north-east
end of the township. A subscription
list was opened to enclose the land
within a stone wall 5 ft. high, and to
build a bridge over the creek.
The little cemetery was situated at
rear of where the Angaston Mill now
stands. The trustees appointed were
(Messrs. J. H. Angas, Wm. Salter, Rich-
ard Rodda, Jas. Smith, Jas. Sawle,
Henry Holmes, Geo. Watson, Wm.
Kealley, Wm. Doddridge and Revs. G.
Stonehouse and W. Oldham. The wall
was built by Mr. Alexander Wishart
for £5B/12/-; tenders also being re-
ceived from Mr. Venning and Mr.
Harding.
It is recorded that Mr, Wishart had
to wait some time for his payment, ul-
timately completed by contributions of
£2/4/- by Mr. J. H. Angas and £1 each
from Mr. Swann and Capt. Rodda. In
September, 1848, Mr. Sawle agreed to
officiate at burials, and Mr. Chinner was
appointed as sexton. The fees, total-
ling £l, were made up of 6/8 each to
sexton, parson and trustees; this latter
sum being remitted where there was
no desire to buy the plot.
Mr. Dawall was secretary till 1851,
and Mr. Salter (treasurer) reported £5
8/- in hand. Mr. Radford, who left
for the gold diggings in 1851, was
asked for an estimate for a gate. The
legal firm of Bartley & Bakewell made
no charge for preparing the deed, and,
with Mr. G. F. Angas (who donated
the land) were thanked at a meeting
in May, 1853. Mr, Peacock engrossed
the deed gratis, whilst Mr. Clark copied
it into the minute book.
Messrs. Smith and Holmes were ask-
ed to build a bridge across the creek
“as reasonably as possible.” Mr. Sam-
uel Smith, now sexton, undertook to
put the ground in order. Mr. Masters
presided at the meeting on May 2,
1855, when Messrs. Salter, Smith and
Kealley were also present. Mr. Dodd-
ridge joined the committee in 1856, and
in 1858, Mr. W. G. London was made
sexton.
Few Babies Survived
The charge for burials was increased
to 25/-; a financial statement showing
subscriptions £143/15/4, and expend-
iture, including the wall and bridge, as
£139/2/5. Thereafter meetings lapsed
for a while, and in 1866 the was
found too small. In all, 223 burials
had taken place there, and it is sig-
nificant that 66 were infants under one
year, and 128 were children under ten
years.
Most of those laid to rest in the little
ground were of Cornish origin, with
here and there in the records a Ger-
man name associated with the pioneer-
ing. In recent years many re-inter-
ments in the present cemetery took
place; closing records of the old plot
being in February, 1919, when the Dist-
rict Council asked relatives to remove
remains still reposing there.
On September 24, 1867, twelve dist-
rict citizens acquired from Mr, Johann
Gottfried Hanisch four acres of land
on the Angaston-Nuriootpa road and
there instituted a cemetery as a private
concern. They were Messrs. Jas. Jep-
son, Chas. Holmes, Chas. Radford, John
Hurst, David Tavender, Richard Wil-
son, Wm. Short, Jas. Harris, David
Ward, H. H. B. Peppered, David Mut-
ton and Sam Stockwell.
By 1903 all these gentlemen had died
with the exception of Mr. Holmes, who
consented to transfer of the cemetery
to the Angaston District Council; this
being effected on April 15 of that year.
Mr. Holmes, worthy townsman, was
laid to rest there on May 22, 1911.
It is interesting to note that in the 10-
year term 1868-78, twenty of the 112
interments were infants and 36 others
were children under ten years. During
the last decade only 15 of the 138 were
under one year, whilst only five were
between one year and ten.
HOW REV. SAWLE DIED
Rev. James Sawle, working hard in
1854 for his new Congregational
Church in Angaston, was destined
never to occupy its pulpit. In the
spring cart in which he used to get
about the district, he was going to
Gawler for a meeting on November 1,
1854, when an accident occurred in
which his hip bone was broken as well
as the bones of his right hand, and he
suffered such internal injuries that,
when the foundation stone was laid on
November 3, his life was slowly ebb-
ing away. And the records add, “The
church lost a man of earnest piety and
remarkable natural gifts.” Two of his
sons-in-law, Nicholas Player and Sam-
uel R. Hall, placed in the church a tab-
let to his memory, obtained from Truro
in Cornwall, England.

ANGAS RECREATION PARK WAS OPENED IN 1877
The ground now known as Angas
Recreation Park, was handed to the
people of Angaston by George Fife
Angas, whose son, John Howard An-
gas, performed the ceremony on De-
cember 28, 1877. It was estimated
that over £3OO would be required to
fence the property and lay it out as
a recreation ground. Toward this sum
the donor contributed £l5O.
The site was regarded as ideal, its
undulating nature having particular
appeal. Mr. Plummer, of the New Inn,
catered with luncheon. Mr. J. H, An-
gas presided, the vice-president being
Mr, E, Salter, J.P. Speakers to the
various toasts were Messrs. J. Dunn,
jun., M.P., F. Basedow, M.P., Rev. W.
Clare, Mr. W. Clark, Mr. Loutit, Mr.
E. Salter, J.P., Mr, Wishart, Mr. J. E.
Gooden, Rev. T. O. Mell and Mr.
Charlesworth. The area of the park
then was 21 acres.
The first committee comprised Mr.
J. Hague (president) and Messrs. E.
Salter, Loutit, Trescowthick, J. Wish-
art jun., Roberts, McFarlane, Hannay,
Hum, Clark, Forrester and Clare. Mr.
Loutit was initial secretary and treas-
urer. The tablet which stood in front
of the Show Hall until a few years
ago, indicated that sufficient progress
had been made to permit the opening
to take place a year later.
The original trustees were Messrs. G.
F. Angas, Henry Mansfield, Jas. Hague,
J. H. Angas, Jas. Wishart, Andrew
Loutit, Wm. Clark, Edwin W. Rob-
erts, Edward Salter, Wm, Chinner, Jas.
Trescowthick, Herman Radford and
Wm. Hum. The trust deed set out
that anyone paying the annual sub-
scription had a right to use the park
at any time, “residents of the District
of Barossa’’ only were entitled to vote
at the annual meeting, and sport on
the Sabbath was prohibited.
The first cricket match was played
on the new ground on December 28,
1877, Messrs. Thos. Hum and Sam
Plush participating. Later the oval
was laid out by Messrs. W. Sibley and
Jas. Liddle. The old stone portion at
rear of the present refreshment booth
was one of the first buildings, serving
as dressing shed and shelter. The first
modest Show Hall was erected in 1895,
the oval was fenced in 1901, and a
year later the bandstand was put up.
In 1903 a monumental tablet was plac-
ed on the slope in front of the Show
Hall, but on account of altered con-
ditions in regard to park maintenance,
the inscription had become misleading,
and it was demolished in 1934.
Most of the men originally associat-
ed with the Park planted the pines that
now add such beauty to the ground.
A bequest of £5OO by Mr. J. H, Angas
enabled the committee to build the
pavilion to his memory in 1905, at a
Committee of Angaston A. H. & F. Society, 1914.

cost of approximately £200; balance of
the money being spent in metalling the
drive around the oval and up from the
front entrance gates. So many gaps
had occurred in the ranks of trustees
by 1909 that new appointments were
made, these being Messrs. C. H. Angas,
W, Hague, R. Player, W. Sibley, W. B.
Holmes, W. G. Smith, J. H, Mansfield,
J. E, Swann, F, Salter, E. E. Tres-
cowthick, T. Hum and J. E. Gramp.
Mr. Jas. Hague was chairman until
1877, after which chairmen were ap-
pointed as meetings were held; the
next definite appointment being that of
Mr. R. H. Ball in 1901. Mr. W. Patch-
ing was chairman from 1912 till 1914;
Mr. G. W. Chinner till 1918; Mr. W.
Patching till 1920; Mr. J. B. Maley till
1928; and Mr. Patching till 1933, when
Mr. W. Sibley (who was made a life
member in 1930) was made president
after having completed 32 years as
secretary. Mr. Loutit was first secre-
tary and treasurer, but in 1879 the of-
fices were divided with Messrs. Jas.
Hague and Roberts acting respectively.
Mr. Ball became treasurer in 1881, and
operated until 1899, when he assumed
the secretaryship in succession to Mr.
Dick (appointed in 1894).
Mr. J, E. Swann was the succeeding
treasurer, then came Mr. E. T. Odgers
in 1914, Mr. K. Robinson from 1926,
Mr. W. B. Higgs in 1933, and the pres-
ent treasurer, Mr. R. B, Hutchens, in
1936. Mr. F. Holmes succeeded Mr.
Sibley as secretary until 1936, when
Mr. E. Feist (present secretary) was
appointed; the committee now compris-
ing Messrs. W. B. Holmes, L. Zimmer-
mann, P. Yates, F, Holmes, R. B.
Hutchens (treasurer), G. S. Watts and
K. Robinson. In 1913 the croquet


lawns wete laid down, and during the
war years extensions were made to the
luncheon booth.
For years there was a desire to grade
the oval, which had a fall of 20 feet,
but as this was estimated to cost well
over £lOOO, no move was made till
1927, when a highly successful carniv-
al yielded £158; Mr. J. B. Maley then
being president, Mr. W. Sibley secre-
tary, and Mrs. P. S. Smith organizer
of the ladies’ committee. In 1929 an-
other similarly successful carnival was
held, Mr. F. Holmes being the organ-
izer, and £163 being raised. This pro-
vided means for metalling the road in
from the traffic entrance, an advance
with which the Tennis Club laid down
new courts, and permitted the grading
scheme to be undertaken in 1930.

Jepson (old Angaston boy and manag-
er for Fox Films) saying it was an
honour as well as a pleasure to provide
the whole programme gratis. Mrs. P.
S, Smith was presented with an inscrib-
ed jardiniere from Angaston citizens
in appreciation of her part in the un-
dertaking.
In 1934 the Park was extended by
purchase of two acres of land on the
south side for £BO, which was collect-
ed, Men who since 1878 have serv-
ed on the committee are Messrs. San-

Floods, Frost, Heat, Etc.
1889 —Big flood in August, carried
away some bridges and did a lot of
damage over a wide area.
1890 —Flood as result of heavy rains
throughout the State.
1894 —During March a heavy hail-
storm did a great deal of damage, the
stones being of such size that a large
number of birds were killed.
1913 —Cloudburst over district, 3f
inches of rain falling in f-hour at Ang-
aston. The river overflowed; Angas-
ton Institute supper room was inun-
dated and 6 ins. of water lay on the
Institute hall floor. Messrs. Les, Mut-
ton and L. Dodson were just saved
from drowning whilst rescuing Mrs. A.
J. Mutton at rear of the buildings east
of the Masonic Hall, The cloudburst
occurred on February 13.
The grading, done by voluntary lab-
our, was one of the district’s biggest
achievements. On the big day there
were 250 men, 32 horses and drays,
Yalumba tractor and scoops —more
than 2,000 tons of soil being shifted
from south to north end of the oval.
Both before and after the big day, a
large number of men toiled to prepare
everything, led by Messrs. G. W. Chin-
ner and W. Patching (who did most
of the ploughing); and later levelled
and finished the new ground. Mr, F.
Holmes was organizer of the magnifi-
cent effort, Mr. J. R. B. Bartsch led
the Moculta contingent of 20 men and
six drays, Mr. W. Pech saw to Rocky
Valley support, and Mr. Reg. Johnson
co-operated with Penrice people.
It would not be possible adequately
to tribute all who helped, but mention
must be made of Mrs. P. S. Smith’s
organising of the ladies’ share; they
catered admirably for the big day and
several week ends. When the job was
finished, a complimentary picture show
was given by the Institute Committee

side of the building, which was un-
floored, with steps into the main hall
and secretary’s office. Since 1896 the
society has spent £1,500 on buildings
and extensions. Total cost of the hall
built about 1895 was £6OO. In Sept-
ember, 1897, £1 was expended for
planting a hedge around the Park; in
January, 1898, a well on the property
was deepened at a cost of £l/10/-; in
November, 1901, £6 was contributed
toward cost of a fence around the
oval; and in February, 1904, new coops
for poultry were obtained for £7.
Couch grass was planted on the oval
in 1906, costing the society £5; and
the galvanized tank at rear of the Show
Hall was bought in November, 1907
for £5. The 1913 extension of the
Show Hall, already referred to, cost
altogether £440, which was followed in
1918 by a donation of £2O toward cost
of building the present front portion
of the luncheon booth onto the old
stone structure that still stands at the
rear. In 1920, coops, trestles and other
fittings were purchased from the
old Nuriootpa Show Society for £3O,
following which the present poultry
pavilion was erected at a cost of £llO
18/1.
Four years later general improve-
ments were effected worth £4l/10/9,
then in 1926 the new road was made
for vehicular traffic on the eastern side
of the Park, the society contributing
£75 toward the cost. Other general
improvements in that year were stated
at £34/14/2. The buildings were all
painted in 1928 for £46/10/-, whilst
in 1929 £2 was spent on additional
flower stands, and £3l in altering the
poultry coops to cope with record dis-
plays, and in additions to the poultry
pavilion. The publican’s booth was
put up in 1930 for £4O; then in 1931
sheep classes were re-introduced and
yards erected at a cost of £l5. In
1932 the roof of the southern annexe
was raised and a floor put in level with
the Show hall; the cost being £94/15/-,
In that year, too, flower cups costing
£6 were bought on half shares with the
Floricultural Society, the poultry pav-
ilion was netted-in at a cost of £4/19/5,
and added boards for tabling were pur-
chased for £5/12/4, In 1938 three ad-
ditional electric lights were installed
in the Hall for £6/6/-.
In May, 1927, the building was con-
nected with the water mains and show-
ers were installed; but this was done
by the Football Club, which is respon-
sible for water rates and meter rent.
It was in 1908 that solid timber ob-
stacles displaced the brush hurdles, and
the Motor Parade was introduced in
1913, being later developed by Mr. E.
J. F. Crawford and others. In 1915,

a result chiefly of extensions, the over-

£4OO, apart from trophies.

AngaSton Was Centre of Education in the Early Days
Angaston’s present School was built
in 1878 and originally accommodated
160 children. It was, however, not the
first school here, for in 1861 there were
two other institutions in successful op-
eration. On one, conducted by Mr.
Edward Planter Nesbit, the Council of
Education of that day reported, “Mr.
Nesbit’s school has always supplied an
education of superior character. It is
amply furnished with material for or-
dinary school purposes as well as for
conducting scientific investigations.”
The average attendance was 51.
On the other school, conducted by
Mr. Richard Thomas, the Council of
Education report stated, “This school
supplies a good plain education, and is
conducted with great care and dili-
gence.” It had an average attendance
in 1861 of 41 pupils, Mr. Nesbit’s
School was in charge of William J.
Ellis in 1869, and in 1870 it closed.
That conducted by Mr. Thomas carried
on until 1877, although in the latter
year Mrs. Maria Thomas (who later
went to Tarrawatta School) was in
charge.
Other schools were conducted by
Henry Marshall, Mrs. Todd (both Ger-
man Pass), Rev. Jas. Leonard (in the
basement of the Old Institute), Mrs.
Evans, Mr, Ellis and Mr, Payne (the
latter two in Dean Street, opposite the
“Leader” office); Miss Loutit’s “Caith-
ness” Girls’ School; and Miss H. Tuck-
er’s Girls’ Grammar School.
Coinciding with erection of the State
School at Angaston in 1878, what was
known as the Moorooroo Board of Ad-
vice was formed to have the oversight
of both the Angaston and Nuriootpa
Schools. Members of the Board were
Thomas W. Charlesworth, M.A. (chair-
man), William Strother, J.P., and
Nicholas Player. Angaston’s initial
teacher under the new order was Mr.
Theodore Niehuus in 1879.
Succeeding teachers have been Messrs
Alfred Holloway in 1880, John Prisk
junior in 1886, E. Stephen Masson in
1889, Fred W. Liebing in 1892, John
H, Snell in 1899, James B. Maley in
1906, Ferdinand J. W. Schneider in
1927, and the present Head Teacher,
Mr. Leslie H. Dennis in 1936. In 1892
the Angaston Board of Advice was
elected, the Moorooroo Board having
apparently disbanded; members of this
new Board being Messrs, A. Shannon
(chairman), E, W. Roberts, R. H. Ball,
R. H. Goerecke, J. H. Walden and J.
E. Juttner.
In 1898 an additional classroom was
added, whilst the ensuing year saw
land purchased for agricultural pur-
poses. Additions to the residence were
made in 1912, Following structural
alterations to the School buildings in
1920, additional land was purchased
and the School completely remodelled
in 1929. Since 1916 the School Com-
mittee has had charge, Mr. Wm. Sib-
ley having been chairman practically
since inception, whilst Mrs. W. Hum
(Sec. since 1924) followed Mrs G. Tav-
ender, Mr. G. Cadd and Mr. Odgers.
Woodwork and domestic arts were
added to the curriculum in 1928, fol-
lowing a highly successful fete organ-
ized with this object in view, £lO6 be-
ing raised. The committee then com-
prised Mr. W. Sibley (pres.), Mrs. W.
Hum (sec,), Mrs. H. Broomhall, Revs.
W, J, Williams and F. J. Lehmann, Mr.
P. P. Thorn (treas.), and Mr. Wilf. S.
Smith, Mrs. P. S. Smith was presid-
ent of the ladies’ committee. The An-
gaston Welfare Club, responsible for
erection of shelter shed, new pictures,
books and many other improvements at
the school, was inaugurated on June
5, 1930; Mrs. F. Schneider being the
first president.
Miss Lee was first secretary of the
Club, and was followed by Miss Phil.
Clark and Miss Phil. Mulcahy for short
periods, Mrs. G. L. Holmes then ac-
cepted the office, and was followed by
Mrs. H. Craker and Mrs. Wilf. Smith;
the present secretary being Miss N.
Mather. With the departure of Mrs.
Schneider this year, Mrs. W. Plum was
elected president. Mrs. W. Bruce
Smith has been treasurer for five
successive years.
ANGASTON CROQUET CLUB
Croquet has been played in Angas-
ton since the early days, when crino-
lines were worn. Clubs then were of
a more or less private nature, and
even now it is the practice to admit
new members by ballot. The present
Club is more than 25 years old, Mrs.
E. T. Odgers, present president, being
one of the original members. The
lawns then were on the site of the pres-
ent Children’s Reserve; a move to the
Park being made in 1913, when Mrs.
P. S. Smith (patroness) generously ad-
vanced funds for laying down the pres-
ent two beautiful greens, nicely hedg-
ed and with little clubhouse. The ad-
vance, subsequently repaid, was free of
interest, and, including the laying on
of water, that corner of the Park now
represents over £250 in assets of the
Croquet Club. Past presidents have
been Mrs. W. Salter, Mrs. P. S. Smith,
and Mrs. T. Hum. Mrs. E, T. Odgers
has now held office for eight years.
Succeeding secretaries have been Miss
Loutit, Mrs. Player, Mrs. McNaughtan,
Mrs. Bruce Smith, Mrs. Keightley, Mrs.
W. Wishart, and the present officer.
Miss B. Radford.


ANGASTON’S FIRST BAND WAS FORMED IN 1856 BY WM. YATES
Angaston’s first combination under
this heading was the Sand Scrub Band
formed by William Yates in 1856. With
him were his sons Samuel and James,
as well as Messrs. Aug. Haberecht and
C. and L. Bauer. This Band played at
the opening of the railway to Kapunda;
going over to the mining town in a
spring cart with one horse. They also
played at Hamilton races about that
time. Another early Band was that
of Mr. Gotthard Henschke, of near
Moculta. This Band used to come into
Angaston and play on the old Market
Green, where the Institute now stands.
The first truly Angaston Band was
founded about 1874, its members being
Messrs. Chas. Chinner, Chas. Hodder,
Chas. Doddridge, Adolph Schultz, Chas.
Brown and Jas. Brown (drummer);
Mr. Henschke coming into Angaston
as their instructor and conductor. The
Band soon gained other members, but
an opposition body was started in
Penrice by Messrs. Chas. and James
Yates, of the old Sand Scrub Band.
When the ranks of both bands became
depleted through players leaving to get
work elsewhere, an amalgamation of
the two bodies took place.
Back row —Bern, and Gus. Gramp; Second row —R. Spendiff, H. Johnson, P.
Jarrett, Wilf. and Bruce Smith, S. Barratt, F. Kurtz, A. Barratt, W. Yates;
Third row —Tom Discombe, Chas. Barratt, Jas. Yates, Chas. Chinner, Geo.
Cadd; Front row —G. King, H. Doddridge, Stan. Patching, Alb, Doddridge.
The Band at this period had smart
uniforms and cap, the total cost, £35,
being raised by bandsmen. From 1902
till 1905 the additional members were
Messrs. W. Wishart, Alb. Barratt, H.
Johnson, G. Wishart, Bruce Smith,
and Wilf. Smith. During this period
the total income was £B6. Mr. Chas.
Barratt was re-appointed conductor;
Mr. Geo. Cadd being secretary and
treasurer.
Toward cost of the Bandstand in
Angas Recreation Park, the Band also
made contributions. In 1906-7 addi-
tional members were Messrs. Syd.
Barratt, A. Doddridge and P. Jarrett;
revenue for the period being £4B, from
which a donation of £2/2/- was made
to the Children’s Hospital. From 1902
till 1907, Mr. J. E. Swann donated all
the carbide used for lighting.
Additional members during 1908-10
were Messrs. W. Yates, H. Doddridge,
S. Patching, B. Gramp, F. Kurtz, Bob
Spendiff, T. Discombe, J. Bradshaw,
G. King and G. Gramp; the income
having now reached £lOO.
ling in horse-drawn vehicles, it went
as far afield as Mannum and Pt. Wake-
field, playing at practically every town
between Angaston and those centres.
Bandsmen were often absent for sev-
eral days on these engagements, play-
ing for outings in the afternoon, and
for dances at night. For a number of
years the Band practised without a
urated on June 20, 1900; Mr. Chas.
Barratt being band-master; Mr. H. W.
R. Yates, secretary; Mr. Geo. Cadd,
treasurer; whilst the other members
were Messrs. Chas. Chinner, J, Yates,
Jas. Johnston, Walter Barratt, Harold
and Edgar Barratt, Chas. and Edwin
Trescowthick, Geo. and John Tres-
cowthick, H. Mansfield, R, Thomas, A.
An allocation was also made to Mr.
John Hatch, who had the misfortune
to have a hand blown off in an accid-
ent at the marble quarries. Valuable
help was received by the Band in these
days from Ernst Kindler, Chas. Scholz
and Os. Krieg, of Nuriootpa.
Every year Angaston Band used to
go to Lindsay House to play on Mr. G.
F. Angas’s birthday anniversary. The
appreciated honour invariably resulted
in bandsmen being well catered for,
and each member receiving a sover-
eign, The Band played at opening of
Angas Recreation Park on December
28, 1877; and a year later attended
and played at the funeral of its loyal
supporter and benefactor, Mr. Angas.
Angaston Band of that day was one
of very few in this State, and its ser-
vices were in great demand. Travel-
conductor, but later Mr. Chas. Barratt
became bandmaster. At one time —
in the Federal Band period—he and
his five sons were players.
The Federal Band
Angaston Federal Band was inaug-
Thamm, Reg. Yates and Alf. Henschke.
During the first two years the in-
come amounted to £B9, and the follow-
ing charities received contributions:
Children’s Hospital, Farmers’ Seed
Wheat Fund, Distressed Farmers’
Fund and the Angas Recreation Park.
For five months during this term,
the Band was fortunate enough to
have the services of Mr. Kiesel; a Ger-
man military bandsman, as conductor,
marked improvement and enthusiasm
resulting. A Bb bass instrument for
£2O was added. Mr. H. Schiller be-
came a member in the following year,
and Mr, W. Bruce Smith became con-
ductor, filling the office very ably.

During 1913-14, Messrs. Bert Gramp,
Cliff Cadd, Les. Duncan and A. Hill
joined. Mr. Bruce Smith relinquished
the baton, and Mr. Duncan became
conductor. Messrs. Geo, Sharp and
W. J. Bailey, and Messrs. A. J. and
D. L. Mutton supplied carbide free
from 1907 till 1914, and on May 6
of that year, Mr. E. T. Odgers was
responsible for a move that merged
the organisation into a Town Band.
The Federals handed over, free of debt,
Bb and E bass instruments, tenor
horn, bass drum, music, and an acety-
lene gas plant and fittings.
ANGASTON TOWN BAND
A guarantors’ committee was form-
ed, comprising Messrs. F. G. Cowan, R.
Player, W. H. Codrington, H. W. R.
Yates, C. H. Turner, C. E. Netted, J.
Dallwitz, L. N. Salter, F. Salter, W.
G. Smith, P. S. Smith, E. E. Trescow-
thick, A. J. Mutton, F. Thorn, J. W.
Mattiske, W. B. Holmes, W. Sibley,
A. W, Sleader, Rev. J. G. Wright, and
Mr. E. T, Odgers (secretary). The
privately-owned instruments were pur-
chased from members of the former
Federal Band, and the Angaston Town
Band was definitely established. Fill-
ing gaps that occurred in the guaran-
tors’ committee have been Messrs. G.
A. Trescowthick, W. H. Batten, G. N.
Dallwitz, P. P. Thorn, D. S. Keightley,
J. P. Richardson, J. Richens, G. W.
Chinner, K. Robinson and W. H.
Thorn.
Mr. Herb. Johnson gave valuable ser-
vice as secretary during this period,
Mr. L. S. Duncan became conductor,
and was succeeded in 1915 by Mr. W.
Bruce Smith, in recognition of whose
splendid work a silver-mounted baton
was presented by the Band in 1916.
Several years later Mr. Albert Barratt
(now with Hindmarsh Band) took over,
bandsmen giving him an inscribed gold
watch when he left in 1924. Mr. W.
Bruce Smith again stepped into the
gap, then Mr. Geo, Hayes; Messrs. C.
Chinner and M. Kindler deputising in
their absence. Mr. Ron. Dawe, pres-
ent conductor, took charge in 1929. In
1934 his sterling services were recog-
nized by gift of an inscribed silver-
mounted baton.
Following Mr. Herb. Johnson as sec-
retary have been Messrs. R, Raethel,
A. Barratt, C. Cadd (9 years), Derek
Weber, C. Nixon, R. Frost and Harold
Wilksch; Mr. C. Nixon being the pres-
ent secretary. The building of a ro-
tunda with practice room beneath, es-
timated to cost £250, was planned by
Messrs. John and G. N. Dallwitz as an
improvement to the Children’s Reserve

in 1927; but the scheme was not pro-
ceeded with. The retirement of Mr.
Chas. Chinner in 1982, was marked by
a social and presentation of an inscrib-
ed gold medal acknowledging his 58
years’ service as a bandsman.
In June, 1932, the Band was recon-
structed, instruments vested with the
District Council, and a Band Execut-
ive elected by bandsmen and towns-
people. Mr. G. N. Dallwitz was elect-
ed president, with Mr. E. Feist as sec-
retary. Following an anonymous loan
of £6O, free of interest, a Band Drive
was made in 1934, realising £176, The
Queens on that occasion were Misses
O. Sibley, E. Wiesmann, I. Shemmeld
and P. Stephens; Messrs. R. Frost and
K. Robinson being organizers. New
instruments were then purchased, and
the Band last year successfully par-
ticipated in D-grade competition at the
Tanunda Band Contest.
Following Mr. Dallwitz as president
have been Rev. C, R. Dadds, Mr. E.
Feist, Mr. R. Dawe and Mr. E. T.
Odgers (now in office). The present
executive comprises Messrs. E. T. Od-
gers, M. Kindler, V. Modistach, R. W.
Dawe, C. Nixon, C. Cadd, D. Weber
and H. Wilksch. Mr, Wal. Barratt has
been librarian since his return in 1919
from the War, he having continuously
been a bandsman for about 40 years.
He was a member of the 50th Battalion
Band in France, and his colleague*
Wilf. Smith was in the band of the
39th Battalion, whilst Syd. Barratt was
conductor of the 43rd Battn, Band,
The Angaston Band’s assets are now
valued at £364, players being now uni-
formed in caps, dark serge trousers
and grey dustcoats.
THE OLD ANGASTON P.S.A.
Affectionate reference is still made
to the good effect of Pleasant Sunday
Afternoons conducted in Angaston ab-
out 25 years ago. A feature was the
playing of a set of fifty bells, of which
Mr. A. R. Sibley was custodian. They
were brought from England and given
to the Society by Mr. John Howard
Angas, whose accountant, Mr. J. A.
Thomson was first president of the so-
ciety. On the bells numbers in five
parts were played by Mr. Chas. Barr-
att, his sons Edgar, Walter and Harold,
and Mr. H. W, R. Yates; together with
Messrs. R. Perry, Thomson, G. Cadd,
Wilf. Wishart and P, Jarrett. Mr. F.
Thorn followed Mr. Thomson as presid-
ent, then Mr. W. H. Codrington, then
Mr, A. R. Sibley.

Angaston Institute’s Rapid Growth Since Modest Genesis in 1856
Angaston Institute was founded in
1856, when a library and reading room
were secured in premises in Murray
Street, adjacent to the present Masonic
Hall, The late J. H. Angas was initial
president, holding office till 1904, when
he died.
By 1867 the membership had grown
considerably, there were 800 volumes
available, and the need of further ac-
commodation was felt. A public meet-
ing, called to consider the situation,
decided to take steps for erection of
a Mechanics’ Institute, comprising a
library, reading room, and hall suit-
able for public meetings.
The proposal was left to a commit-
tee comprising Messrs. W. Clark, E.
Hague, J. Hague, T. Hague, J. Plan-
nay, J. Harris, C. Holmes, J. John-
ston, £l. Keynes, J. Lewis, PI. Mans-
field, D. Mutton, E. P. Nesbit, H. H.
B. Peppered, H. Radford, E. W.
Roberts, W. M. Short, N. Tallack, G.
Thomson, J. Wishart and J. Wishart
jun.
This committee met on August 20,
1867, and decided that a Mechanics’
Institute be built and vested in trust-
ees elected by the subscribers at a
general meeting. Mr. G. Thomson was
appointed treasurer, and Mr. E. W.
Roberts secretary, of the Building
Fund. Contributions in cash or work
were solicited by a committee embrac-
ing Messrs. W. Clark, J. Hague, J.
Plarris, J. Johnston, E. Keynes, E. P.
Nesbit and G. Thomson.
About this time, members of the
Loyal Park Lodge, 1.0.0. F., whose
meetings were held in the hotel room,
decided to erect a Lodge Room. They
conferred with the Institute Committee
and it was agreed that building funds
be pooled on consideration of a lodge
room being provided in the new Instit-
ute. Mr. George Fife Angas donated
the site in Murray Street.
Of the 11 trustees, the Lodge elected
three and the remainder were appoint-
ed by Institute subscribers; this be’ng
done at a meeting on October 7, 1867,
when Messrs. Chas. Plolmes, Jas. John-
ston and Edward
Planter Nesbit
were appointed
by the Lodge;
and the Revds.
John Gibson and
John Hannay,
and Messrs. John
Howard Angas,
William Clark,
Henry Evans,
James Hague,
Ebcnezcr Keynes
and Win. Salter
as subscribers’
representatives.
The tender of Messrs. Win. Chinner
and H. Radford (masonry) and Jas.
Wishart (carpentering) was accepted
for the two-storey building on May
6, 1868; Mr. Thos. Nock being appoint-
ed overseer of works. The walls were
built by Messrs. J. and A. Wishart,
and the plastering was executed by
Messrs. Tallack and Radford. The
ground plan provided for a build'ng
34 ft. x 62 ft., and the main hall was
to be 30 ft. x 45 ft.
The building was formally opened
by Mr. J. H. Angas in October, 1870,
when Mr. T. Hague, who was then
treasurer, reported that the building-
had cost £1,336/0/9; piano and fur-
n'shings, £77/17/2; totalling £1,413
17/11. Toward this, £325/9/9 had
been subscribed; Mr. G. F. Angas giv-
ing £l6O in addition to the land. A
bazaar yielded £236/5/11, entertain-
ments £27/13/7, Adelaide Institute
£5O, and Government Grant £soo—a
total of £1,299/9/3, which left a debt
of £ll4/8/8 on the new budding.
Proceeds of the opening entertain-
ment were £4O/5/-, and the remaining
liability was quickly cleared. Small
rooms on the
upper floor were
at first used as
the library and
reading room;
but in 1884 the
large basement
room used by
Rev, Jas. Leon-
ard, 8.A., as a
school, was va-
cated, and after
one end had
been partitioned
off as a library,
this portion of
the premises was used for the many
years of extension that followed.
Those days were not without their
sidelights. One occurred in 1885, when
a number of non-subscribers claimed
a right to use the Institute reading-
rooms on the grounds that the In-
stitute was subsidised by the Govern-
ment, and such subsidy was condition-
al upon any reputable member of the
community having the privilege of go-
ing there to read. The committee re-
ferred the issue to Adelaide author-
ities and found that the public had
this right on Saturdays only. In 1896,
however, the Minister of Education
secured legislation opening subsidised
Institute reading rooms to the public
during regular hours daily.
By 1900 the growing community felt
the need for a larger hall, and various
schemes for extension were explored.
Six years later a sub-committee com-
prising Messrs. Wainwright, R. H. Ball,
A. C. Clark, R. A. Perry, Roberts and
Cooper, recommended to the trustees
that the stage be incorporated in the
main hall and a new stage be carried
out from the back wall 20 ft. on piles;
the lower space to be enclosed for
dressing rooms. The trustees approv-
ed of this being started so soon as
£lOO of the estimated £2OO cost was
in hand.
The proposal failed to materialise,
and in 1907 it was decided to sell the
old building if a new site could be
bought. Messrs. Chas. Holmes, J. E.
Swann, Jas. Hague and P. A. Roberts
were deputed to wait on the Council
and ask for the vacant triangular
property known as the Market Green.
In the middle of the block was a big
gum tree, around which the Council
roller and other implements were kept.
Council approval was given, and
upon this land arose the present In-
stitute, already becoming inadequate
for the needs of this growing com-
munity, and to be extended by the ad-
dition of an £B6O supper room and
kitchen as a Centenary effort.
At a general meeting of subscribers
on August 6, 1907, a motion to sell
the old Institute (minus fittings) to
the Barossa Masonic Lodge for £550,
was carried unanimously. The title of
the new site was then transferred to
the Institute trustees, together with a
caveat that the old Institute would not
at any time be used for hire in oppos-
ition to the new Institute.
Mr. R. H. Hewett’s tender of £2687
was accepted for construction of the
new Institute with imposing two-storey


front and 60 x 42 ft. main hall; An- in 1909 and a further £2O/7/- in the
gaston marble being used. Among the following year. The trustees were au-
efforts to raise funds were skating thorised to take out a mortgage cover-
evenings conducted at Yalumba by ing the balance of cost of the building,
Mr. P. S. Smith and his committee, and it was ceremoniously opened on
as result of which £55/3/- was netted December 13, 1911.
First Community-Owned Cinema
Mr, D. S. Keightley was instigator
of a move whereby Angaston Instit-
ute in 1914 pioneered in Australia the
community-owned Picture Show. The
cinema plant, costing £270, was financ-
ed by debentures. Mr. A. E. Ophel
was the first operator, and Messrs. D.
S. Keightley and W. H. Codrington
the initial managers of the Cinema
Board that was elected from the In-
stitute Committee. Coinciding with
the slump occasioned by the drought of
1914, and then the outbreak of war,
the low returns and disappointments
called for a lot of courage; but they
held to their objective, and by August,
1918, the liability had been eliminated.
Returns in subsequent years went
to improve the plant and help the In-
stitute, so that by 1920 the plant was
valued at about £4OO, whilst the weekly
show had earned £9OO, of which £260
was devoted to local and patriotic
funds. Moving with the times, the
Institute in 1931 installed a “sound”
plant costing £638. This again was
financed by the issue of debentures;
£l5O having been repaid to date, and
another £l5O ready for liquidation in
the near future. With the exception
of a remaining £lOO, the balance is
due to one Angaston citizen who has
consented to it remaining.
Mr. Codrington was succeeded as
Cinema Manager by Mr. S. Davey,
who was succeeded by Mr. R. M. Hardy
and then the present Manager, Mr. C.
Trescowthick, who is assistant operator
to Mr. W. Yates. The present Cinema
Board comprises Messrs. W, Sibley,
W. J. Bailey, H. W. Yates, G. Cadd
and C. Trescowthick, who, with other
members of the Institute Committee,
give their services as ticket-sellers,
door-keepers and ushers at the weekly
picture show.
In 1920 the mortgage on the Instit-
ute was reduced to £l,OOO, and it now
stands at £650. The library, in 1867
containing 800 volumes, has been con-
siderably extended, and a juvenile sec-
tion added until 4,886 volumes are
now available.
Mr. C. H. Angas was for a long time
Chairman of Trustees, and Mr. James
Hague secretary; the latter being suc-
ceeded by Mr. Wm. Hague. Among
others who have held office are Messrs.
J. E. Swann, E. Salter, L. N. Salter,
C. Holmes, S. O. Smith, R. Player, P.

opposite the site of his present prem-
ises. Long hours and careful atten-
tion to business soon produced ex-
tension. Stocks of tobacco, cigarettes
and some fancy goods were carried.
Still the business grew. No small mea-
sure of the credit for this expansion
is due to Mrs. Summerton, who was
a wonderful help, and the only assist-
ant at that period. Together, they
planned further extensions, and as the
shop was too small, they decided to
build new premises on the other side
of the street. When this was done, a
billiard saloon was added, drapery and
other lines were stocked; the propor-
tions of an up-to-date department store
being slowly reached. The new pre- merton’s early-day customers still ex-
mises had become inadequate by 1924, tending their patronage although in
when further expansion took place; some instances many miles away. The

T>ERT. SUMMERTON, Nuriootpa, is
associated with one of the busi-
ness romances of this district, an in-
dication that “there is always room at
the top.” He started from zero, and
in addition to building up one of Nu-
riootpa’s leading businesses, has played
a prominent part in the life of the
town, helping in a dozen different di-
rections, but always shunning positions
of prominence. He was only twelve
when he left school and started as a
parcel boy in a Gawler drapery store.
At 14 he left to learn the hairdressing
trade, and when 19 went to Freeling
to manage the hairdressing business
which, two years later, he bought. That
was the start of his business career.
After six years at Freeling, he sold
out, and in 1911 went to Nuriootpa
where he opened a hairdresser’s shop
on the west side of Murray Street,

FIRST NURIOOTPA LUTHERAN CONGREGATION GATHERED IN 1862
The story of Lutheran Churches in
this area reaches to the start of settle-
ment itself. Pastors who came out with
pioneers went from place to place as
means could be found, sharing the pri-
vations and lending greater brightness
to the services held in homes of sett-
lers. There is little record till the early
’sixties, when Pastor Niquet is found
operating from Light’s Pass as a dist-
rict centre, and travelling per German
waggon to Nuriootpa, Gnadenfrei and
the smaller communities.
One of the homes in which services
were held was that of Mr. and Mrs.
Frank Roennfeldt; the latter being the
eldest daughter of Mr. Johann Gramp,
who came out in 1837. She was born
shortly after the arrival of her parents,
and, coming with her husband to Nuri-
ootpa about 1862, they pitched their
tent and later built their home; blacks
at that time being very plentiful.
The congregation came together in
1862, foundation members being Mr. and
Mrs. C. Krieg, Mr. Schaedel, Mr. and
Mrs. F, Roennfeldt, and Mr. H. Scholz.
When the public school was built at
Nuriootpa, services were held there, the
Rev. J. Reusch having succeeded to
the pastorate, which he held until his
death in 1897. In 1866 a move was
made to erect a church. Subscriptions
came in freely, and the congregation
got together in a fine voluntary effort
by which the stone was obtained and
carted and other work done. Mr. S.
von Bertouch (then Clerk of Court at
Tanunda) laid the foundation stone on
June 11, 1867.
The building was finished without a
ceiling, and not until 1897 was an or-
gan secured, the cost then being £6O.
The first trustees were Messrs. Heln-
rich Scholz, Carl Friebe, Ert-
mann Geier, Carl Krieg, Gottlieb
Kaerger, August Staehr and Wil-
helm Sommer. The church, nam-
ed after St, Peter, was opened
on November 10, 1867, with be-
tween sixty and seventy mem-
bers. The contractor was Mr.
Friederich Liebich, and the res-
ponsible committee included
Messrs. H. Scholz, A. Staehr, W.
Weger, F. Roennfeldt, H. Schae-
del, C. Krieg and others.
Mr. Sonnberg was the first
church warden, and was follow-
ed in turn by Messrs. Ed. Sauer,
C. A. Gravfe, J. Keller and G.
Riedel. The first child christen-
ed in the new church later be-
came Mrs. Aug. Sauer; whilst
the first marriage was that of
August Teppich and Augusta
Klante. After the death of Rev.
J. Reusch, the Rev. G. E. Hege-
lau filled the pastorate until 1899
and was succeeded by Rev. P. E.
Kaestner, who had ministered for ten
years when he met with a fatal accid-
ent at Gawler.
Rev, A. Hiller succeeded for two
years, after which Rev. R. Held, the
present pastor, took charge. Records
for a time after 1867 are incomplete,
but changes shown in trustees indicate
that Messrs. W. Thamm, K. F. Kruger
and K. Kindler held office, being suc-
ceeded by Messrs. Scholz and Staehr,
who served for many years; and more
recently by Messrs. A, Staehr, W.
Thamm, J. F. Zimmermann, R. Russ-
ack, E. Roennfeldt and J. Keller,
In 1917, when the church celebrated
its fiftieth jubilee, the trustees were
Petri Lutheran Church, Nuriootpa
Messrs. F. Russack, J. Keller, E, Kind-
ler, A. Liebich and A, Lange; a gap
being caused by the death of Mr, Kind-
ler in 1919. Mr. A. G. Kretschmer
was church warden in 1917, and the
present officers are Messrs. C. Schu-
bert and J. B. Warnest.
The lay readers have in turn been
Messrs. E. Sauer, R. Staehr, Thamm,
H. Scholz, J. Keller, J. Tamke, G. and
O. Krieg. For many years a day
school was conducted in conjunction
with the church, succeeding teachers
having been Messrs. Roneke, Droege-
mueller, Rieschieck, F. Zimmermann,
Krichauff and Schulz; Miss Geyer be-
ing in charge for three months before
the school was closed.
When the organ was obtained in
1897, the chair was usually filled by
the teachers until Miss Sophie Riedel
took charge, and had the honour of
officiating at the fiftieth anniversary.
Miss Riedel was followed by Miss Ida
Schmaka until her marriage, when Miss
Frieda Juncken took over and was as-
sisted for a time by Miss Lorna Krieg.
Mr. Norman Lange is now assisting
Miss Juncken, who has given many
years of faithful service.
Up till 1913 the church was floored
with stone slabs, which that year gave
place to modern flooring mainly as re-
sult of a fine effort by the ladies who,
with a very successful fete, raised £l5O.
New seating was also added. For a
number of years Mr. G. Krieg was sec-
retary, and when he relinquished office
in 1923, Mr. J. B. Warnest filled the
position for a while, and was succeed-
ed by Mr. J. Gersch, the present sec-
retary.
Mr. H. Scholz was a great Sunday
School worker and was superintendent
of the original Sunday School. In the
years that have followed the position
has been filled by Messrs. Thamm, E.
Sauer and O. J. Krieg; the latter in
1917 having as assistants Misses Ida
Schmaka and Emma Krieg; the pres-
ent assistants being Messrs. J. Gersch
and C. Juncken, and Misses E. War-
nest, S. Materne and L. Zadow.
Rev. P. Braun was principal speak-
er with Rev. R. Held when, on Novem-
ber 11, 1917, the Church held its 50th
Jubilee. At the mission festival in the
afternoon, Revds. J. Meier and J. H.
Zwar officiated, and Mr. O. J. Krieg
conducted the choir. More years of
faithful service saw the wings across
the end of the building erected in 1923

at a cost of over £700; wholly met
two years later, when a bell fund was
opened.
On November 20, 1927, the deep-
toned bell sounded from an inspiring
tower when the church was re-opened
on completion of the tower and after
renovations had been made. The cele-
bration marked also the 60th anniver-
sary attended by more than 500 peo-
ple who contributed £6O in collections
for the building fund.
On September 22, 1935, Mr, O. J.
Krieg completed 25 years as Sunday
School superintendent and choirmaster.
After the service Pastor Held gave a
brief address of appreciation. Mr. C.
Juncken conducted the choir that day,
and the pastor’s tribute was supported
by Mr, A. G. Kretschmer (chairman
of the church committee) and Mr. John
Gersch for the Sunday School and the
teachers. Mr. Krieg was handed a
beautiful large biblical picture from
the choir and congregation; whilst the
scholars, per Gordon Warnest, gave him
a valuable illustrated bible. Mr, Krieg
had at that time been a lay reader for
twelve years.
On September 27, 1936, Mr, J. Kell-
er’s 70th birthday was made the oc-
casion of presentation of a large bible
in recognition of his 38 years as lay
reader and 36 years as an elder. He
was a trustee for 32 years till 1934,
when, with Mr. A. E, Lange the only
other surviving trustee, they resigned
in order that the Church could be in-
corporated.
A Young People’s Society was form-
Ed in 1914, and is now carried on with
Mr. C. Juncken as president, and Miss
F, Juncken as secretary, A Ladies’
Guild, of which Mrs. Held is president,
was also formed and has done excell-
ent work. Rev. R. Held started Eng-
lish confirmation classes six years ago.
With the assistance of Mrs. Held, he
for some years gave religious instruc-
tion to about fifty children on Satur-
day mornings. At present this work
is being carried on by Mr. J. F. Jacob
and Miss S. Materne.
The tower and renovations had cost
£1286, of which £1037 was collected and
raised by a series of splendid efforts
by ladies of the congregation; leaving
only about £250 to be made up. The
tower cost £857, the bell £l3O, and the
remainder represented painting the new
front, enlargement of the balcony and
other improvements. Mr, J. B. Trae-
ger had the contract for the tower;
Mr, H. G. Scholz did the masonwork;
Mr. A. E. Cartwright did the painting
and decorating; and Mr. H. Juncken
was responsible for the balcony exten-
sions.
But we have moved ahead too quick-
ly, and must return to the stage when
the foundation stone of the tower was
laid, for then were made several beauti-
ful tributes to earnest, faithful stew-
ardship, It was on August 14, 1927,
that Rev. R. Held (who in 1936 com-
pleted 25 years ministry) accepted from
Mr. O. J. Krieg the inscribed silver
trowel with which he had laid the
beautiful block of marble presented
and engraved by Mr. Jul. Habich.
Mr. O. J. Krieg was chairman of
the building committee, which compris-
ed also Messrs. J. Keller, A. Mickan,
A. Liebich, A. E. Lange, F. Russack,
G. Schild, G. C. Kaesler and C. Juncken
with Mr. J. B. Warnest secretary. Mr.
J. Gersch, church secretary, nicely ex-
pressed the thanks of the congregation
to all who had in any way helped.
One of Nuriootpa’s Smithies in 1891
This smithy, conducted by Mr. Carl Kindler, was where Mr. A. L. Siegele’s
Garage now stands. In the picture, from left to right, are Messrs. Carl
Kindler, E. Schroeter, Neumann, Ern. Kindler, little Hedwig Kindler and
Mr. W. Pfitzner. Jack, a son of Mr. Ern. Kindler, (now in Brisbane) won
his Bachelor of Engineering degree in 1927. Nuriootpa’s other smithy was
built in 1893 by Mr. J. F. Scholz, of Light’s Pass, who sold it to Mr. Chas.
Kleinig (later of Laura). The building, which was located further along Mur-
ray Street, was demolished in June, 1928.
The Girl Sports
One of Nuriootpa’s talented Concert
Companies in later years was the Girl
Sports, who in 1918 did great work
to aid patriotic funds. Miss Vera Kel-
ler was president; Miss May Krause,
secretary; and Mrs. R. G. Alexander,
Miss Clarrie Baker and Miss Erica
Robin were pianistes. Mrs. D. Hawke
assisted with the costuming. Their lat-
er efforts were mainly directed toward
raising funds for the Soldiers’ Memor-
ial Hall, for which they got £305/19/4.
After opening of the Hall in 1926 they
disbanded. Among the members were
Misses Rita Sauer, Hilda Hatch, Frieda
Baker, Elma Kindler and Vera Hatch
(who were the “male” section), Ida
Schmacka, Ivy Robin, Mandy Glaetzer,
Elsie Otto, Maisie and Una Brimage,
Stella Sauer, Dorothy and Nita Scholz,
Jean Allmond, Melva Sieber, Kath.
Timmens, Hilda Ash, Anna Craig, Lucy
Neumann, Lottie Lane, Mary Hatch,
Frieda Mattner, Irene Zhierski, Dora
Albanus, Frieda Juncken, Laura Hatch
and Francis Warnecke. The company
was really organized to raise funds for
the purchase of a new piano for the
old Institute.

SHEARD’S SERVICE STORES, NURIOOTPA.
and there followed in turn Mr. Shepherd, the Misses Trewin, Mr. Bickford, Miss A. J. Loutit, Mr. R. S. Drake,
and then Kretschmer Bros. Mr. Sheard bought the Angaston business from Mr. H. H. Caudle on August 1 ,
1932, placing Mr. J. Tehan in charge. Mr. Tehan in 1936 was made manager of the drapery department
at Nuriootpa, and Mr. H. E. Craker became manager of the Angaston branch. Both the Angaston J
and Nuriootpa Stores have been modernized; bearing now little resemblance to the establishments of jfy
a decade ago. The Angaston Store links with the early days through its founder, the late H //
H. Haves, who was on the staff of the late Jas. Hague’s Angaston Store, and later traded on
the River Murray in the days of the “Queen,” one of eighty paddle steamers on the Murray. JTS
Whilst the business carried on by Mr. Hayes catered
only for apparel, it has under Mr. Sheard’s guidance been
developed along general store lines and now takes its place as
one of Angaston’s leading business institutions. Progressive-
ness is the keynote of Sheard’s Service Stores; the principal,
who knows business from the big city store viewpoint and
that of the commercial traveller —in both of which he had
experience—believing implicitly in the great future of this
district. All the firm’s work is done locally in addition to
providing employment for 15 people. Mr, Sheard weekly
visits the city in order to keep in touch with business develop-
ments, and to secure for patrons the best that is offering in
what lines are not directly imported. In the realm of publicity
Sheard Service Stores is the only country establishment that
has produced a special issue of its district journal.
Sheard’s Service Stores
For fifty years the name of Sheard has been associated
with Barossa business enterprise, beginning with the late Alfred
Sheard, who in 1886 opened Gawler’s first department Store
after having gained experience in such famous emporiums as
William Whiteley’s, in London. Shortly after he opened, a bank
crash and unemployment occurred which would have eliminated
a less ambitious man, and he was rewarded later by seeing his
enterprise grow and in knowing that he had been a factor in
the community progress of that period.
Mr. H. L. Sheard, a son, and proprietor of the Nuriootpa
and Angaston Stores bearing the honoured name, is Chairman
of Nuriootpa Centenary Committee in addition to other public
offices. He took over the Nuriootpa business on April 29, 1929,
retaining Mr. A. G. Kretschmer as manager. Mr. Kretschmer s
record of community service over many years is one with few
equals in the district, and he links the present business with past
associations, for he was a partner with Mr. O. Kretschmer, and
afterwards managed the grocery department for Messrs. Dallwitz
Limited. Back in the ’7o’s, Mr. Strother had a store on this site,


Magnificent Memorial Hall takes Place of Institute built in 1876
Nuriootpa’s magnificent Memorial
Hall of to-day was erected in 1925 as
a tribute to her sons who participated
in the Great War. They were all made
honorary life members of the Institute,
their names listed as follows on a beau-
tiful Honour Roll: G. Below, A. Chap-
man, W. Chapman, B. Devlin, J. Dev-
lin, A. Domeyer, T. Dunstone, G. Gully,
C. J. Hatch, S. E. Jantke, A. John, E,
John, P. John, O. Jungfer, F. Bullock,
C. Kindler, R. Nenke, B. Riedel, H.
Sauer, Capt. R. Q. Scott, W. J. Keller,
F. M. Kernich, E. Modistach, A. Nenke,
E. Nenke, W. Nenke, E. Plush, L.
Plush, S. Plush, P. Russack, A. Schulze,
E. Schulz, S. E. Tolley, A. Wuttke,
Mr. A. E. Cartwright’s row of shops
now represent the remodelled Institute
Hall that served for so many years.
It was founded in the early ’seventies
by Mr. J. G. O. Tepper, then the head
teacher at Nuriootpa State School, who
at that time was conducting a library
at the school. So enthusiastically did
he urge the building of an Institute
that Mr. J. Coulthard donated a site
in Murray Street; this being taken over
on November 27, 1876, by the follow-
ing trustees: Wm. Strother, John Coul-
thard, H. Emil Olafsen, Chas. Williams,
Ludwig Warnecke, August Riedel and
Friedrich Otto Windscheidt.
The building, for which Mr. Tepper
was initial secretary, was erected by
Mr. Friedrich Liebich, and comprised
a main hall 46 x 33 ft., library 14 x
ft., passage 14 x 16?. ft., and read-
ing room 14 x ft. The earliest re-
cords are of 1883, when J. H. Angas,
M.L.C., was president, but Mr. Wm.
Strother (vice-president) invariably
filled the chair, although at one meet-
ing when purchase of a chessboard was
decided on, Mr. B. D. Lange was in
charge.
Mr. S. H. Davey was secretary until
1891, when he handed over to Mr. M.
T. Ellis, who also was librarian, until
1897. Mr. Ellis, however, continued
as secretary until 1898, when a public
social was accorded him as a mark of
appreciation of his splendid work. In
1883 there were on the committee
Messrs. Lange, Trotter, Olafsen, Bock,
Riedel and Warnecke. Striking com-
parison with to-day is afforded by the
insurance then; £2OO on both furnish-
ings and books.
Mr. Trotter was next librarian, at-
tending around 1884 to 800 English
volumes and 585 in German. In that
year a Gymnasium Club was formed.
Mr. J. Coulthard became Institute pre-
sident, and Mr. Liebich had a place on
the committee. Revision of the rules
gave-to members the right to eject any-
one found mutilating library papers, or
talking excessively.
The Nuriootpa Cricket Club of 1884
booked the hall for a concert, and were
relieved of hire charge if the proceeds
did not exceed the liabilities. In 1887,
an exchange of books was arranged
with Angaston Institute; Mr, J. H.
Angas then being patron; Mr. D. J.
McNamara president, and Mr. Davey
secretary. Messrs. Robin, Coulthard
and Hall had been added to the com-
mittee; with Messrs. Ellis, A. Riedel,
L. Warnecke and Liebich.
In October of that year, Messrs. Sage
and Seward Plush were committeemen;
the former also acting as auditor until
1888, when Mr. Basham was appointed.
Mr. J. Coulthard stepped into the pre-
sidency in 1888, the committee then
including Messrs. A. Riedel, M. A.
Thiele, A. B. Robin, G. Basham, Geo.
Sage, L. Warnecke, C. B. Domeyer and
Trotter, Mr. Trotter was also the li-
brarian, officiating until late in 1898.
Messrs. Ellis and Basham were res-
ponsible for the introduction of skat-
ing, which materially improved the fin-
ancial position. Mr, L Warnecke suc-
ceeded Mr. Olafsen as vice-president,
and Messrs. Riedel, Jeffries, O. Schae-
del and Grant were committeemen. In
those days fruitgrowers were mindful
of the gain represented in co-operation,
for there is record of a charge of 2/6,
room hire for Association meetings.
Lack of funds obstructed a proposal
that Goethe’s and Schiller’s works be
placed in the library, whilst accounts
were passed for payment with the sig-
nificant rider “when funds are avail-
able.”
The position was eased in 1890, when
a Cake Fair yielded £4B; Mr. Waden
being a new member of the committee
then. Mr. Davey in 1891 resigned the
secretaryship after long and valuable
service. Two years afterward, Mr, W.
J. Ponder (vice-president) had with
him on the executive Messrs. C. B. Do-
meyer, G. Sage, G. Riedel, H. A. Olaf-
sen, H. Krieg, G. Jantke and J. L.
Severin. Mr. W. Maywald painted ex-
terior of the hall for £4/5/-; no fur-
ther improvement being possible on ac-
count of the stringency which, in 1894
made necessary a three-months’ over-
draft. Messrs. T. Sage, P. Warnecke,
R. Richardson and Jonge had given
service as auditors.
At the annual meeting in 1894 there
was a debit balance of £B/2/1; 120
books had been added to the library,
total of which now stood at 1815. The
officers elected were: J. H. Angas, pat-
Ron; J. Coulthard, president; W. J.
Ponder, vice-president; M. T. Ellis, sec-
retary and treasurer; and O. Jonge, G.
Sage, A. B, Robin, A. Liebich, H.
Sauer, H. Krieg and G. Riedel, com-
mitteemen, The secretary was instruct-
ed not to permit card playing in any
part of the hall, and to have the In-
stitute garden done up in the cheapest
manner.
So far the hall was not provided with
a permanent stage, this being put in
in 1894. In February of the following
year, Barossa A, H. & F. Society ap-
plied for use of the hall and grounds
for its Show on February 28; this be-
ing granted sans any charge. Nurioot-
pa Quadrille Class was booming, rep-
resentations being made to this body
to help the Institute. The only alter-
ation in personnel at the ensuing an-
nual meeting was the addition of
Messrs. Rieschieck and P. Warnecke
to the committee.
By 1896 the Government grant to
Institutes had come into operation, and
this £2O, with £l3 from memberships
and £l2 from hall hire, gave a credit
balance of £l6 on the year; the librar-
ian having been paid £lO/10/-. New
names at next annual meeting were Mr.
J. H. Keuper and A, Wood (commit-
teemen), Mr. H. B. Nenke joining in
1897, when Mr. A. B. Robin became
vice-president.
In 1889 the Institute was managed
by Messrs. J. Coulthard (president),
A. B. Robin (vice-president), M. T.
Ellis (secretary), H. Juncken, T. Sage,
E. O’Brien, J. H. Keuper, H. Krieg,
P. Warnecke and A. Riedel, In 1900
Mr. J. H. Daniels went on; Messrs. L.
Warnecke and Trewin being auditors.
Mr. J. F. Zimrnermann became librari

an in 1901, whilst Mr. Trewin had been
made vice-president and Mr. W. Liddi-
ard was a new member of the com-
mittee.
The annual meeting of 1902 attract-
ed three subscribers; that of 1903 be-
ing even worse. Of the £42 income,
£ll was derived from subscriptions.
The surplus was only £4/12/-, but by
1905 there was a credit of £25. Mr.
J. Drinkwater had now taken over the
secretaryship. Five years afterwards
the executive comprised Messrs, Wm,
Coulthard (president), J, Drinkwater
(secretary), H. Juncken, A. B. Robin,
E. Kindler, J. Richards, B. Zimmer-
mann; improved finances permitting
£23 being paid off a loan of £34 from
Mr. Wm. Coulthard, and an acetylene
gas plant being installed.
Mr. C. Krichauff resigned after a
long term as librarian, and when Miss
Daniels (who followed) gave up the
position, Miss Horwood took over. Mr.
J. G. O, Tepper, initial secretary, was
made patron in 1910, when Messrs. J.
Keller, Jas. Carroll and Pitman were
also associated with the executive, of
which Mr. A. B. Robin became presid-
ent in 1911; Mr. W. Coulthard being
vice-president, and Messrs. C. A, L,
Virgo, J. Richards and A. H. Paech
filled vacancies on the committee.
New Trustees
During the year forty cathedral
chairs were bought. Mr. H. Juncken
succeeded to the presidency in 1912,
when Mr. Keller came back and was
a year afterwards made vice-president
to Mr. Virgo. Thirty feet of new land
at rear of the hall was purchased from
Mr. Pfeiffer for £l5, and in that year
the Barossa & Light Band Contest was
held at Nuriootpa, Mr. Riedel resign-
ed as a trustee, and as all others ex-
cepting one had passed on, new ap-
pointments were made embracing
Messrs. A. B, Robin, W. Coulthard, J.
Keller, H. Krieg, L, Warnecke, W.
Appelt and Seward Plush.
Messrs. R. Field and Waterman join-
ed the management in 1914; but the
latter later withdrew, and Mr. W. Ap-
pelt filled the gap. The early closing
of hotels, introduced at end of 1915,
gave a stimulous to membership, which
by 1919 had reached 43, The peak was
91 members in 1930. Mr. R. E. Baird
followed Mr. Paech in 1915, whilst Mr.
A. G. Kretschmer went on in 1916.
Mr. Virgo (widely popular manager
of the National Bank branch) still re-
tained the presidency, with Mr. W.
Appelt as vice-president.
Mr. J. Drinkwater Leaves
A flagstaff was erected by the com-
mittee at Nuriootpa Post Office corner,
but after serving for the War years,
it was removed when the Post Office
was re-modelled. Mr. J. Drinkwater’s
long and useful association with the
Nuriootpa School ended with his trans-
fer in 1917. He had been Institute
secretary for over 12 years. Mr. C. R.
Dudley filled the office for a while, and
Mr. R. G. Alexander took over in 1918,
when Messrs. C. Warnecke and Davis
were committeemen.
Some idea of heavy calls upon the
hall in wartime may be gathered from
the cost of lighting (carbide) —£5 in
1914, £2B in 1918. September, 1919
saw the lamentable death of the presi-
dent, Mr. C. A. L, Virgo, to whose
memory a framed enlarged photograph
still hangs in the Institute, his com-
munity labours touching almost every
worthwhile institution, and his last
great public service being in connec-
tion with the War Tank elsewhere re-
ferred to, and from which he deliver-
ed stirring appeals.
£7,000 Memorial to Her Heroes
Need for a larger hall and a call for
fitting commemoration of the town’s
part in the Great War, resulted in a
proposal to erect a Soldiers’ Memorial
Hall; Mr. W. Coulthard giving a block
of land valued at £lOO, next the old
Institute. The first big effort was in
November, 1919, when Nuriootpa Day
realised £550. Of this sum, £2OO was
raised by little Queens —Gwen Kretsch-
mer, Edna Sleader, Stella Scholz and
Mr. Wm. Coulthard
Ethel Appelt. Mr. W. Appelt was pre-
sident of the committee; Mr. W. Coul-
thard treasurer, and Messrs. Field and
R. G. Alexander secretaries.
Plans for the new hall carried an
estimate of £4295. (The completed
building, plus improvements, however,
cost £7,000). Mr. A. Liebich, the con-
tractor, was a son of the builder of the
old Institute which seemed diminutive
by comparison. The main hall measur-
es 80 x 44 ft., with ceiling 23 ft. above
the floor; stage 20 ft. deep and 23 ft.
wide. Mr. W. Coulthard laid the foun-
dation stone in June, 1924; Mr. Jas,
A, Craig (a returned soldier) presiding
at the ceremony.
On the building committee were
Messrs. W. Coulthard, W. Appelt, A.
S. Gillingham (secretary), J. A. Craig,
A. E. Cartwright, Tim Sage, O, J.
Krieg, A. G. Kretschmer, D. Hawke
and P. G. Edwards. A monster car-
nival in October, 1924, preceded the
opening and, inclusive of a subsidy of
£125 from Mr. W. Coulthard, £1,201
was raised by the magnificent effort.
The carnival executive comprised Mr.
W. Coulthard (president), Mr. Jas. A.
Craig (vice-president), Mr. C. B. Robin
(secretary), and Mr. W. Tuohy (or-
ganizer and publicity officer).
Of the big carnival total, £548 was
raised by a Queen Competition for
which candidates were Mrs. R. Baird,
Mrs. W. E. Deßavin, Mrs. P. G. Ed-
wards and Mrs. A. S. Gillingham. Sec-
retaries of the respective committees
were Messrs. A. G. Kretschmer, O. J.
Krieg, P. G. Edwards and A. S. Gill-
ingham.
The Memorial Hall was officially
opened by Sir Henry Barwell on Sun-
day, June 7, 1925; Rev. LI. Lewis con-
ducting the dedication service, and
Rev. H. S. Atkin the service inside the
hall. Fittings and furniture had by
that date involved £1,500, and the to-
tal cost was £6,000, of which £1,200 re-
mained to be made up. Thus, in less
than five years, Nuriootpa had raised
£4,800. Further improvements brought
the total cost to £7,000 —and to-day,
only about £l5O remains to be met.


Of the £4,800 referred to, Nuriootpa
Days had yielded £3,335; Girl Sports’
concert party, £306; dances £7B; and
the Opening Bazaar provided £l7l,
with a further £B5 from the Opening
Ball. The old Institute was offered by
auction, and was bought by Mr. A. E.
Cartwright for £6OO. A further £5OO
accrued at Nuriootpa Day in 1926;
the Queens being Misses Ruby Gertig,
Hilda Schild and Jean Lowe, who paid
in £231 from their efforts.
Mrs. W. R. G. Sharpe was president
of a big Fete in 1928, which brought
in £510; Mrs. H. Pitman being secre-
tary. In conjunction therewith, and
supplying £284 of the total, was a suc-
cessful Baby Competition, won by
Lindsay Cartwright with 27,176 votes.
The other competitors were Roma
Knispel, Ross Leslie, Doug. Pfeiffer,
Jean Warnest, Glenda Lowke, Beth.
Fisk, Joyce McCrea, Ron Schubert and
Denise Chapman. This reduced the
Hall debt to about £5OO, and Nurioot-
pa ladies are deserving of particular
credit for succeeding efforts that have
so materially helped; the Fete in 1930
being one of the best since, and nett-
ing £lO7.
Launch Institute Pictures
An Institute Picture Show was com-
menced on the Saturday following the
opening of the Hall in 1925. Mr. W.
Tuohy was operator and manager, his
associates on the Cinema Board being
Messrs. W. Coulthard, J. A. Craig, P.
G. Edwards, J. B. Dallwitz and O. J.
Krieg, with Mr. C. B. Robin as treas-
urer. Later Board members were
Messrs. A. E. Cartwright, A. S. Gill-
ingham, Arch. Heath, M. Trigg and J.
Leslie.
During the first six months the cine-
ma, after paying rent, showed a profit
of £lOO. During 1926 the profit was
£2OO after £73 had been paid as rent
to the Institute; £lO5 profit plus £64
rent in 1927; and £lOO plus rent in
1928. Then came the big depression,
and profits disappeared; coincidently,
sound pictures were introduced, and
the show was closed down. Since then,
several private enterprises have cater-
ed, the most successful being Mr. R. C.
Williams (conducting the present Nuri-
ootpa Talkies) who in 1936 established
a regular Wednesday night show of
high standard.
While Saturday nights were vacant,
the Institute Committee conducted sev-
eral dance series, that of 1934 realising
£132. Mr. A. Hatch throughout gave
his services as M.C. gratis. And now,
properly to tribute those who have
served, it is necessary to go back to
1920, when the executive comprised
Messrs. J. G. O. Tepper (patron), \V.
Appelt (president), W. Coulthard
(vice-president), R. G. Alexander (sec-
retary), H. Field, A. G, Kretschmer,
H. Krieg, H, Juncken, J. B. Warnest,
Sayer and A. E. Cartwright.
In 1921, Messrs. D, Hawke and O.
Krieg went on, and a year later Mr.
W. Coulthard was again president,
holding the office until 1935, when Mr,
C. B. Robin (present president) took
office. Mr. J. A. Craig became vice-
president, and Mr. R. Hatch secretary,
in 1922. Mr. C. B. Robin took over
Nuriootpa Sold.ers’ Memorial Hall
the secretaryship in 1923, and in 1924
Messrs. A. S. Gillingham and P. G.
Edwards joined the executive.
A year later, Mr. R. E. Baird was
made a trustee; Messrs. A. E. Cart-
wright and A. G. Kretschmer having-
been appointed in 1921. Miss Elma
Kindler followed Mr. Theile as librar-
ian in 1928, whilst on completion of
the new hall in 1925, Mr. Wm. Mann
was made librarian and caretaker, hold-
ing office till 1934, when Mr. Fred
Maywald (present officer) succeeded
him.
Messrs. B. Dallwitz and C. Juncken
joined the committee in 1925; Mr. W.
R. G. Sharpe in 1926; Messrs. M. Trigg
and C. B. Robin in 1928; and Messrs.
J. P. Ralph and A. F. Kealley a year
later. A Player-Piano was bought in
1925 for £2OO. The rear of the pro-
perty was vacant until 1927, when the
Nuriootpa Bowling and Croquet Clubs
secured a 42-year lease at £5 per an-
num. In 1928, Nuriootpa was made a
University examination centre, the In-
stitute annually being used. Mr. J.
Leslie became secretary in that year,
holding office till June, 1932, when Mr.
C. B. Robin was appointed for remain-
der of the term; then Mr. F. May-
wald (present secretary) accepted the
position.
Mr. A. G. Kretschmer was made
vice-president in 1930, Mr. H. Draper
also joining the committee, with Dr.
F. W. Hoopmann added in 1931, Mr.
A. J. Allen in 1932, and Mr. M. M.
Sexton in 1933. The present execut-
ive comprises Messrs. C. B. Robin
(president), Wm. Coulthard (vice-
president), F. Maywald (secretary), A.
G. Kretschmer, A. E. Cartwright, A.
F. Kealley, Dr. F. W. Hoopmann, B.
R. Hasting, W. H. Craig (the latter
two joining in 1935), and J. S. Lord
(appointed this year).
The present trustees are Messrs. R.
E. Baird, A. E. Cartwright, Seward
Plush, J. Keller, W. Coulthard, O. J.
Krieg and A. B. Robin. The library
now includes 2,000 volumes, and the
Institute owns a fine concert piano,
bought some years ago with proceeds
of concerts organized by Mr. W. R.
Dempster and his talented company,
“The Gloomchasers.”

FOOTBALL INTRODUCED AT ANGASTON IN 1870 BY PETER NIQUET
Angaston’s football history dates
from early in the 70’s, when Peter Ni-
quet, later of Mt. Gambier, was cap-
tain of a club here, and probably the
founder. Among the stalwarts of that
period were Bill Doddridge, Tom Hiles,
John Gilbert, George Swann, Jack Pra-
ter, Rev. G. Berry, W. Woods and H.
H. Hayes, The teams in those days
were twenty a side, inclusive of four
men in the ruck, and Angaston goals
faced east and west —goals then being
the only score recognized.
The only gain accruing from a be-
hind was the right to kick off. When
out of bounds the ball was invariably
thrown in; whilst the start of a match
and resumption after each goal differ-
ed from the present system of bounc-
ing the ball at centre. In those days
the team winning the toss had the right
to kick off from centre.
A line across the field divided the
opposing teams, each defending its own
area. The team kicking off delivered
the ball into their opponents’ territory,
whereupon the forwards would follow,
and spread across the field to appoint-
ed positions. The game was based on
English lines, and later developed a
technique that is Australia’s own.
Angaston football under the old rules
was established on a scientific basis by
Frank Hayes, born here, who went to
Melbourne in the ’eighties and won a
prominent place in the Richmond, Vic-
torian League team. As a forward he
was a marvel, and his mastership of
the place kick may be gauged by the
regularity from which he could score
goals from as far as 60 yards out.
For a while he played for Medindie
(now North Adelaide) in S.A. League,
and after his return to Angaston about
1883 he was several times selected to
play for the Northern Division in the
match against Southern —then the big-
gest annual fixture on the S.A. Foot-
ball League calendar.
Bouncing the ball at centre to start
play, then a new rule, was introduced
to Angaston about 1890 by Mr. J. B.
Maley, who accompanied a visiting
Truro team as umpire—a position he
occupied after having won distinction
on the field. When later he was presi-
dent of Angaston Club he won similar
admiration for his administrative judg-
ment and love of fairplay.
In those days Angaston played
matches against Truro, Kapunda, Kap-
unda North, Roseworthy College,
Greenock and Tanunda when the lat-
ter had a team. The first Barossa and
Light Football Association was inaug-
urated in 1894 with A. Basedow as sec-
retary; the participating teams being
Angaston, Greenock, Kapunda and
Kapunda North.
F. H. Richardson (Angaston) was
appointed secretary in 1895, when D.
James became president. In the foll-
owing season, Greenock could not see
its way clear to join, and the Associa-
tion was allowed to go into recess un-

til 1908, when H, Juncken (Nuriootpa)
became president, and Matt. Schluter
(Greenock) took over the secretary-
ship—a position he still holds.
R. M, Hardy was Association presid-
ent in 1920 and 1921, whilst W. E.
Symons, who has been president since
1933, took the office after having been
secretary and president of Angaston
Club. To return to the Association
lapse of 1896-1908, it is found that
popularity of the sport was unrestrict-
ed here. In 1904, seven matches were
played against district teams, the total
scores being 61-98, whilst only 5-18
was registered against them.
Became Brilliant League Men
In 1905 Angaston played 11 matches,
scoring 83-119 to 23-48. Of the 25
premierships contested since resusci-
tation of the Association in 1908 (and
there was another suspension, 1916-18,
during the War), Angaston won 13.
There are, however, other Angaston
stalwarts who should be mentioned as
having been successfully taken up by
the League—Bow Read (Victorian),
Glyn Trescowthick (North Adelaide,
and an interstate goal-keeper), F.
Leach (South Adelaide), A. Pfitzner
(Norwood), K. Obst (Port Adelaide),
and W. Tonkin and B. Mattiske (West
Adelaide). Mattiske also in 1936 won
distinction as interstate goal-keeper.
Angaston, too, has supplied many
brilliant Association players. Frank
Chinner was a noted ruckman in his
day; Bow Read thrilled with his high
marking, whilst as a rucking combin-
ation, he and Bill Friend have never
been excelled. For 25 years continu-
ously, W. Friend was rover and for-
ward for the blue and whites, and then
took on umpiring. H. Ames was noted

Mr. J. B. Maley (Head Teacher at
Angaston School) was president of the
Angaston Football Club for 15 years,
until his transfer in 1927; and other
secretaries have been C. Trescowthick,
1919 and 1920; H. Broomhall, 1921;

Standing—Otto Traeger, George Cadd, and Richard Dobson.
Seated —Thos. Cadd, Will. Smith and Fred. Haberecht.
Charles Hodder and William Tres-
cowthick introduced cycling to this
district in 1880, when the “Penny far-
thing” bicycles made their appearance.
Angaston Cycle Club was formed in
1883, the 14 members being Messrs.
Wm. Trescowthick, W. S. Smith, F. J.
Tallack, Geo. Cadd, Dan Vaughan, O.
Traeger, A. Geyer, P. Tate, F. Haber-
echt, Aug. Henke, Tom Cadd, E. Cock-
ing, Chas. Trescowthick, R. Dobson
and Joe Vaughan.
Members of this Club cleared the
first cycle track in the Park, and some
keen racing took place with Philip
Tate, Wm. Smith, Aug. Henke, Fred
Haberecht as outstanding performers.
Later came the cycle with two regular
wheels, and then the racing machine
was developed. Here should be men-
tioned William Fowler, who competed
in Adelaide and injured his hand in a
bad spill. Other notable racing cyc-
lists were G. W. Chinner, F. G. Chin-
ner, Edwin and John Trescowthick,
and Geo. Trescowthick. The big-
front-wheel machines called for a lot
of skill, whilst racing on them was an
achievement in itself.
THE TOWN CLOCK
Angaston’s Town Clock, now prom-
inently placed on the Council Office
was apparently purchased by the Coun-
cil in the early days, for it has given
service for nearly a century, and was
overhauled and repaired in 1870. For
very many years it was on the front
of the old Angaston Post Office, and
when that place was re-modelled in
February, 1927, it was lodged with Mr,
D. S. Keightley, and later transferred
to its present location.
Holmes and C. Spring joint secretaries
in 1933; these latter carrying on in
1934, when Mr. F. Thamm became pre-
sident, Mr. G. Hayes has held the
presidency since 1935, with H, H.
Young as secretary.

Methodism Pioneers District Outposts of Early Days
The story of district Methodism, or
Wesleyan Methodism as it was in the
beginning, is one essentially associated
with pioneering, taking in the little
settlements in a far-flung service call-
ing for miles of travelling; sometimes
on horseback; sometimes on foot. The
centre was Greenock, where a church
was built in 1854; and in 1885 the
Tanunda people were discussing erec-
tion of a building, whilst Nuriootpa,
Towitta and other centres were regu-
larly being ministered to, mainly by
local preachers.
In the years that followed, men like
Mr. James Mutton would walk 20 miles
to take a service; held at times in the
homes of settlers; soft glow of the old
oil lamps suffusing night services with
an added comfort. The history, there-
fore, reaches beyond 1864, when the
present Angaston Church was erected
at a cost of £1057, inclusive of furn-
ishings and cartage of much of the ma-
terial. One of the most prized posses-
sions was a harmonium, insured for
£2OO, or just £lOO less than the build-
ing itself.
The land was bought from Mrs. Bat-
ten for £47, and toward the end of
1863, Mr. David Tavender contracted
for the building, with Messrs. Hayes
and Peter Brown doing the woodwork.
Messrs. Jas. Sibley and Watson sup-
plied the stone, and Mr. T. S. Plush
glazed the windows. The Revds, J,
Pope and J. Hannay conducted the
opening services on September 18, 1864,
and the ensuing tea and social brought
the day’s receipts to £6B.
Mr, H. Holmes headed the list of
donations toward the new church with
£5O; others who helped to make up the
total of £370 contributed being: Mr.
J. Treloar £B5, Hon. G. F. Angas £3O,
Messrs. G. Watson and Wm. Pollard
each £2O; Messrs. H. Mansfield, N.
Tallack, Wm. Short, J. Hurst, Wm.
Salter, J. H. Angas, Mrs. J. H. Angas
and Mrs. Ferrett each £10; C, Holmes
£6; R. G. Payne, J. Harris, Jas. Tres-
cowthick, M. P. Batten, T. H. Davey
and Jas. Ridgway each £5.
The church bell was mounted on
April 18, 1865. In order to complete
the building, £4OO had been borrowed,
and in the difficult years that follow-
ed, eight and ten per cent, interest
was paid thereon. The struggle was
maintained until 1868, when the cir-
cuit stewards sought permission to sell
a property the church had at Barton.
The early ministers who visited the
circuit were usually accommodated by
church members, and it is recorded
that, in 1870, Mr. Tallack was thank-
ed for having extended this service
for the preceding three years.
Another worry was in regard to
horses for ministers and local preach-
ers. The animals had regularly to be
bought and sold, and there was a com-
plaint in 1879 that the horse was dan-
gerous and would have to be replaced.
Mr. Chas. Holmes invariably provided
a hack in emergencies, supplementing
this help by generous donations of chaff
supplies.
Among the early local preachers,
who took services at Tanunda, Green-
ock, North Rhine and Towitta, were
Messrs. E, Davey, N. Tallack, H. (af-
terwards Revd. Henry) Holmes, W.
Pollard jun., Jas. Mutton, M. Nettell,
Wm. Carmichael (who later married
Miss Pollard and went as a missionary
to the South Sea Islands), J. Andrew
and A. Barrett (who when 75 years old she was made a class leader. Later in
cycled to Port Augusta). the year the death of Mr, Watson was
Up till 1881, a house in Penrice was marked by deep affection. Mr. W.

at opening of the new century; Mr. A.
J. Mutton becoming a steward and
taking up local preaching, together
with Dr. Dawkins.
Mr. S. W. Bailey was conducting
services at Collingrove in 1902 at the
expressed wish of Mr. Angas, who gave
an annual subscription of £lO toward
the church. Mr. Pollard passed away
in 1903, and in that year Mr. D. L.
Mutton started as steward and local
preacher, and he is still devoted to this
work after 33 years. Misses Netted,
Trewin (2), Watson, Holmes, Andrew,
Mrs. Holmes, Mrs. P. Roberts, Mrs.
Thompson and the wives of stewards
were appointed in 1904 as a commit-
tee to work in the interests of the
church. In October, 1904, Mr. W. H.
Codrington was a steward and local
preacher.
Mr. H. Parish was made a steward
in 1911, and Messrs. E. T. Odgers and
A. T. Pitman in 1912, when Mr. Swann
retired as circuit steward after many
years of faithful service. Mr. Swann
was for fifty years secretary of the
Methodist Trust and for 36 years sup-
erintendent of the Sunday School. Mr.
E. T, Odgers, who is still a local
preacher, was Sunday School superin-
tendent in 1916, when his assistants
were Mr, D. L. Mutton and Misses von
Bertouch and Sleader; Miss Carpenter
having left when she took up nursing
in Adelaide.
In 1917 Misses R. Sleader, Edna
Shemmeld and Mr. D. M. Chittlebor-
ough (also a local preacher) were on
the staff; and in 1918, Misses McDer-
mott, Niquet and Conrad and Mrs.
Lillecrapp. Earlier superintendents
were Mr. F. Chapman in 1881, and Mr.
Thompson in 1888. Mr. Odgers, now
in charge for 22 years, has on his staff
Messrs. A. J. and D. L. Mutton, and
Misses Nesta Mather, Audrey Barrett,
Jean Liddle and Betty Doddridge.

nes (who has been treasurer for nine
years), and F. Holmes (secretary).
Mr. W. Giles, veteran starter for
sporting events throughout the dist-
rict, took his place on the field years
ago. He played in Barossa & Light
Association football in 1908, and was
a competitor at Greenock Sports 35
years ago. In fact, he has not missed
the Sports there for 35 years, and for
the last 22 years has been starter.
The Angaston Branch of the Agri-
cultural Bureau was formed on July
12, 1888, when Messrs. A. Molineux
and Krichauff (of the Central Bureau)
were present and indicated the lines on
which the new scheme for interchange
of ideas among producers operated.
Mr. E. Salter was first chairman of
the branch; foundation members being
Messrs. Sidney Smith, A. Shannon, J.
Mr. E. R. Feist, President
C. Jacob, F. C. Smith, W. Clarke, W.
Hum, C. Domeyer, G. Sage, A. John-
son, W. Trescowthick, W. Bainger, M.
Andrews, G. F. Stange and W. Sage.
Mr. A. B. Robin was next chairman,
and was followed by Messrs. Sidney
Angaston Agricultural Bureau Branch
Smith and Will Clark. The secretary-
ship was carried on by Mr. S. O. Smith
for three years, then that wonderful
bureau worker, Mr. E, S. Matthews,
held office from 1896 till 1922, The
membership in early days was limited
to 15. Professors Custance, Laurie
and Perkins were a great help, as also
was Mr. G, Quinn and other Depart-
mental officers.
S.A, Fruit Inspectors who came from
this branch were Messrs. P. Trimmer,
T. Sage, G. L. Wishart and S. O. Smith.
Spraying of fruit trees was introduced
at Mr. Jas. Trescowthick’s (where the
first spraying in S.A. was done), and
by Messrs. F. C. Smith, W. Sage and
A. B. Robin, The branch won first
prize for District Exhibit at the Royal
Show in 1913 and 1914 against keen
competition. Life membership (after
20 years’ service) has been conferred
by the Advisory Board on Messrs. S.
Plush, S. O. Smith, R. Player, E. S.
Matthews, A. Friend, W. Sibley, W.
Patching and W. Giles.
For a short time the branch lapsed
and was revived in 1926, when Mr, K.
Robinson was elected secretary, and
has filled the office till to-day. Mr.
G. L. Wishart as President, was suc-
ceeded by Messrs. Wilf. Smith, H. F.
Lock, Wm. Patching, W. P. Codring-
ton, H. Linton, R. Sibley, O. Linke
and E. Feist. Messrs. W. Codrington,
H. Linton and Wilf, Smith have won
the Lower Northern Pruning Cham-
pionship, and in addition to successes
at Angaston Show, the branch compet-
ed at the Royal Show in 1933. Frost-
Combating and Fire-fighting organiz-
ations were fostered by the branch,
which has gained a lot of information
as result of annual trips to various
centres of interest in the State.

Penrice Church, Built 1854
Next to tlie Union Chapel of 1844,
the building that is now Penrice Lu-
theran Church is the oldest in this
district. Unfortunately the records
of its genesis have not been preserved,
but it can be established that it was
erected prior to 1855, for in that year
Mr. Jas. E, Smith was christened there,
as was Mr. Fredk. Thorn, shortly af-
terwards. Penrice was then a thriving
Penrice Lutheran Church
place, with much promise from the
quarries and mining. The little church
was built by Methodists, and one of
its earliest preachers was the Revd.
Caldwell. There were others who oc-
cupied its pulpit and are listed in the
story of the later Angaston Methodist
Church.
The larger building at Angaston was
able to provide for Penrice adherents
as Angaston grew, and it was a desire
to add what later became the Davey
Hall that led to disposal of the Penrice
property to Angaston Congregational
congregation early in the present cen-
tury for £lOO. Mr. Edwin Davey gave
a similar amount, £5O was anonymous-
ly donated by an Angaston lady, and
with £294 from the opening fete, the
Davey Hall costing £320 and built by
Messrs. J. and A. Wishart, was paid
for. It is attached to the Angaston
Methodist Church and is now used for
meetings and church functions.
In 1919 the picturesque Penrice
Church was purchased from the Con-
gregationalists by the Lutherans for
about the same sum as had been paid
for it. The congregation, however,
existed prior to that time, for Pastor
F. J. Lehmann started to conduct ser-
vices in the Angaston Institute in 1912.
He settled in Angaston during the fol-
lowing year, and in January, 1918, his
congregation consisted of several fam-
ilies; the living room of his home being
used for worship until the church was
bought. Then in a bad state of repair,
it was renovated and, on September
14, 1919, was re-dedicated as a Luth-
eran Church.
In 1927 a new roof was jut on, the
interior was thoroughly done up, and
a fibrolite ceiling was fitted at a cost of
about £lOO. Mr. and Mrs. J. Graetz
are responsible for maintaining the
well-kept garden that now lends so
much attractiveness to the building.
The congregation now numbers over a
hundred souls. The organists here have
been Mrs. P. H. Henke, Mr. G. Sae-
genschnitter, Mrs. Oscar Linke and
Miss Stella Jericho.

ODDFELLOWS’ LODGES IN ANGASTON, NURIOOTPA AND STOCKWELL
The Loyal Park Lodge, Manchester
Unity of Oddfellows, was founded in
Angaston on December 14, 1855; the

aston. Stockwell Lodge was opened
on August 21, 1863, and was success-
fully carried on for 25 years; being-
conducted in German, in which lan-
guage the records were also kept. The

Angaston Hostel, opposite the Children’s Reserve
In one of the most delightful spots in Angaston is the Hostel; with
the pretty Reserve in front, centre from which district tours may conveniently
be made, and but a few steps from the business centre. Post Office and other
facilities. It affords for tourists and others a place offering at a very reason-
able tariff all the comforts and convenience of home.
The fine building, erected to Mr. John Dallwitz’s order, incorporates
every modern convenience, and has a spacious balcony that can be used for
dancing, or for enjoyment of the delightful summer evenings. It was opened
by Miss Alex Sage on Friday, September 4, 1931. Furnished throughout on
modern lines, there is a roomy lounge, large dining room with five tables, and
a well-appointed kitchen. Charming taste has been shown in the fittings, the
subdued lighting and those little appointments that appeal.
The large, airy bedrooms are on the upper floor, connected by wide
passage. Here is another spacious lounge, whilst conveniences are handy and
modernly equipped. Exquisite taste is evidenced by the tonings on every hand
—it is an augury of the service throughout, the special likings of clients hav-
ing everywhere been carefully considered and anticipated. Perhaps the reason
lies in Miss Sage's long experience—it is certainly endorsed by the regular
bookings. It is the sort of place you desire to stay at again.
On one side of the beautiful stairway is access to the daintily-
appointed tearooms, where ice cream, confectionery, cool drinks and light re-
freshments are served. Septic system is installed throughout, whilst rain and
reservoir water are available for patrons. Beneath the front portion of the big
building is a spacious cellar. Hot water is installed in the building.
The Barossa Studio, Nuriootpa.
Pictured above is the imposing building containing the Barossa Studio,
opened in July, 1936, for Mr. Ted Geyer. Mr. Geyer, who has had a long
association with photography, and has been connected with some of the leading
studios in this State, decided that this district should have its own modern
place, eqidpped with the very latest cameras, enlarging equipment, developing
and printing units, backgrounds, and the usual accessories of the up-to-date
studio —in fact, giving a service equal to that of the city.
On completion of the buildings, Mr. Geyer spared no expense in in-
stalling the very best equipment; arranging also for the new scheme of lighting
that permits of ideal portraiture at any hour. Individuals, groups, or parties
can now be photographed in the studio at times convenient to themselves, and
with maximum results. Special cameras and lenses permit the taking of out-
door pictures in that pleasing manner that yields a perfect impression of the
scene, gatherin'? or building; with panoramas where required.
Photography is to-day such a popular hobby that developing and print-
ing of amateurs’ snaps calls for the best possible service—not only in the
actual operation, but in advice and help. In this direction the Barossa Studio
specialises. Full equipment is carried for the expeditious handling of all films
sent in, and where enlargements are required, there is apparatus for bringing
out all the loveliness of the original in a big picture.
Barossa Studio is also developing a big connection for Gift Pictures.
There is nothing so very intimate, so really one’s personal gift, as a portrait.
They have the added advantage of being so inexpensive. Just one aspect
should be emphasised: For the best results, the nicest pose and artistic re-
touching it is always advantageous to make the appointment early.

Anga£ton Congregational Church, 1861-1936
Angaston Congregational Church in
a large re-union gathering in 1928 cele-
brated its 50th jubilee, reviewing a
half-century wherein many ministers
and church workers had given splendid
service to both church and community.
While Angaston was still young, those
of Congregational adherence worship-
ped in the Union Church of 1844, then
in the church that later became Bap-
tist. As the various denominations in-
creased, the need was felt for churches
representative of them, and on Octo-
ber 2, 1861, a meeting prayerfully
formed a fellowship of 14 members and
founded the Congregational Church in
Angaston.
There were present on that occas-
ion Mr. R. L. Coward, Mr. and Mrs.
William Salter, Mr. and Mrs. Samuel
Smith, Mr. Sidney Smith, Mr. and Mrs.
Henry Evans, Mr, Edward Salter, Mr.
W. Yates, Mr. Wm. Birks, Mrs. E. W.
Roberts, Mrs. Wm. Green and Miss
Elizabeth Smith. The first deacons,
elected at that meeting, were Messrs.
Samuel Smith and Wm. Salter, At a
meeting 11 days later, on the motion
of Mr, J. H, Angas, it was decided to
try and get a resident minister at a
salary of £2OO per annum. A proper-
ty was obtained as minister’s residence,
and shortly afterward what is now the
Congregational Hall was erected by
Messrs. Jas. and Alex. Wishart for
£1227/12/-, total cost; two-thirds of
the sum being paid immediately.
Negotiations for the present church
were begun on December 20, 1877, and
on May 13, 1878, Mr. J. H, Angas,
J.P., laid the foundation stone; total
cost of the new building being £2163.
For some time after formation of the
church, services were conducted by
Rev. R. L, Coward and lay preachers.
Rev, John Gibson, just out from Eng-
land, was called to the pastorate on
April 16, 1863, and after Hi years’
ministry, resigned and returned to Eng-
land in December, 1874. Rev. Robt.
N. Morris, 8.A., who followed in 1875,
resigned in January, 1877, and return-
ed to Sydney. The Rev. Thos. E. O.
Mell, of Tasmania, came, and during
his two years here the present church
was built.
Ministers who followed were Rev.
Alfred Jones, of Glastonbury, Eng-
land, July 1881 till October 1888; Rev.
John E. Kelly, of Dunedin, New Zea-
land, December 1888 till his death on
October 6, 1890; Rev. Wm. M. Grant,
of Port Chalmers, N.Z., from May 29,
1891 till January, 1907; Rev. F. Vicary
Pratt, M.A., of Katoomba, N.S.W.,
1907 till August, 1910; Rev, John G.
Wright, of Truro, S.A., from October
2, 1910, till April 2, 1916, when illness
caused him to relinquish his work, and
he died nearly a month later; Rev. H.
G. Nelson, November 6, 1916 till 1924;
Rev. W. J, Magor, 1924 till 1926; Rev.
W. J. Williams, 1926 till 1934; and
Rev. E. W. Weymouth, present min-
ister.
Mr. Wm. Birks, first church secre-
tary, was succeeded by Mr. Wm. Clark,
who after many years, handed the of-
fice to Mr. Loutit for a short time.
Rev. Jas. Leonard’s 10-year term end-
ed with his death in August, 1891.
Thereafter the duties have been car-
ried out in turn by Messrs. F. C.
Smith, Art. Salter, J. E. Snell, A. T.
Friend, R. Player, J. E. Smith, L. S.
Plush, P. Thorn, W, Bruce Smith and
now W. Trescowthick.
In the early days a mission was open-
ed at Rocky Valley, and was several
times temporarily abandoned. Services
were held till 1893 at Mr. Jas. Fowler’s
home. On May 20, 1894, the Rocky
Valley Church was opened; total cost
of the building being £l7l/18/10, and
services are now held regularly. Rev.
Angaston Congregational Church
L, Robjohns, 8.A., (now at Keyneton)
began similar work among the gold
miners in the vicinity of Mt. McKenzie,
and this was later continued for many
years by the Rev. Pratt until closing
down of the mines brought about the
cessation of these services. Mount Mc-
Kenzie residents, however, requested
a continuance, and for some years this
was done.
In April, 1911, trustees of the Ang-
aston Congregational Church purchas-
ed from the Methodists the historic
church at Penrice, which was opened
by the Rev. J, G. Wright on April 28,
1911. A Sunday School, formed there,
was carried on by Mrs. R. Player and
other teachers, there being about 30
scholars. There has been a Sunday
School at Angaston since formation of
the church, Mr. Samuel Smith being
the first superintendent. He was suc-
ceeded by Mr. Edward Salter, Mr. Ful-
ton Salter, Mr. Walter Sage, Mr. Fred
Thorn, Mr. Percy Yates and now Miss
Vera Smith. Mr. F. Thorn relin-
quished in 1921 after having been a
teacher for 47 years, and received a
presentation; as also did Miss B. Rad-
ford, who in 1921 started the kinder-
garten, which she carried on till June,
1927, when she resigned.
Special services of recognition were
conducted to the memory of Mr. Sam-
uel Smith, who died on June 15, 1889,
aged 77, he having been a foundation
member, deacon and S.S. superintend-
ent; Mr. John Howard Angas, who
joined the fellowship in 1867, was a
generous supporter, and died on May
17, 1904; Mrs. J. H. Angas, who died
in April, 1910; Mr. Richard Player,
whose memory is also perpetuated by
a Communion chair and Bible given
by Mrs. Player; Mr. William Hum,
who joined the church in 1863 and at-
tended regularly until the last year of
his life, and who passed away on Dec-
ember 14, 1916, aged nearly 90. There
were many others for whom In Mem-


oriam services were held, together with Rice, Miss Elva Rice, Mrs. Weymouth,
those who fell in the War and whose Mrs. Seward Plush, who has been
names are engraved upon an artistic conductress of the choir for 14 years,

■p LECTRICITY and WATER

Because water from the Warren res- Angaston extension was estimated to
ervoir gravitated only to the lower cost £25,580. In February, 1925, a
entrance of Angaston and would have public meeting was held in Angaston
to be pumped and stored for any town to protest against the delay in carrying

voir of 250,000-gallon capacity, the £24,791, the supply was gazetted as
being put in operation on January 27,
1927. It is interesting to recall, how-
ever, that there were many supporters
of a scheme advanced mainly by Mr.
Jas. Liddle about 1900 for the tapping
of a large subterranean basin which
he maintained was located behind
the Angaston Flour Mill.
Electricity, May 29, 1925.
When Mrs. G, W, Chinner, wife of
the Chairman of the Angaston Council,
switched on the electric light on June
5, 1925, she saw the materialisation of
efforts for only four years. That night
Sir David Gordon and Sir Geo. Brook-
man (Directors of Adelaide Electric
Supply Co.) were entertained by Coun-
cillors at a private dinner. Electricity
was available on May 29, the official
opening being deferred till all street
lights were connected.
The original scheme was organized
by Messrs. F. Johnson and K. Robin-
son toward the end of 1921, and on
June 19, 1922 they laid full details be-
fore the District Council. It involved
a loan of £7,000 for a continuous ser-
vice plant for Angaston, and a further
£3,000 to connect Nuriootpa. A profit
of £250 was figured upon 180 consum-
ers (who had been canvassed) using
25,000 units a year at 1/2 per unit.
With Mr. A. W. Murray (now man-
ager of the Bordertown Council plant)
as technical advisor, the organizers had
several conferences with Council, who
heartily supported the scheme; and the
Hydraulic Engineer’s Department gave
an undertaking to use current for its
pumping here. A 70 and a 25 h.p.
super-Diesel engines were proposed, be-
ing located near where the present
pumping station is so that the crude
oil fuel would gravitate from tankers
on the railway. Cost of mains alone
was estimated at £7,000.
Messrs. D. S. Keightley and J. E.
Swann sponsored the Angaston motion.
carried by 150 votes to nil, that the
Council take a poll in regard to the
loan of £12,000. Messrs. A. B. Robin
and C. J. Habich were the movers at
Nuriootpa. Councillors visited various
centres with generating plants and en-
thusiastically sanctioned the poll. Cr.
Chinner, Messrs. D. S. Keightley, R. M.
Hardy and others gave valuable assist-
ance to the organizers, who had to
explain the project also at Stockwell
and Moculta. At the poll on August
26, 1922, the loan was vetoed by a
majority of 68 votes out of 1019.
The good work done, however, in-
duced Barossa Electric Supply Co. (a
Tanunda venture) to place before the
Council a contract for supply of elec-
tricity if sufficient consumers were
forthcoming. To ascertain this, meet-
ings of ratepayers were held, at one of
which it was stated that Tanunda Coun-
cil had signed in 1920 a contract for
supply of electric energy till 1940.
On April 28, 1923, Adelaide Electric
Supply Co. placed before the Council
a proposal to extend its mains from
Gawler through Freeling and Greenock,
provided 200 consumers in Angaston
and Nuriootpa could be guaranteed.
Council accepted this proposal on the
understanding that the work was com-
pleted within two years; and the poll,
taken on July 7 in only Angaston and
Nuriootpa, resulted: 643 for and 47
against. The service is carried on
high-tension 33,000-volt lines to Ang-
aston and Nuriootpa and broken down
by transformers to 400 and 200 volts.
In the vestibule at Angaston Institute
is a beautiful leadlight partition erect-
ed in 1933 to the memory of Mr. J.
P. Heggie, who in the previous year
left a bequest of £5O to the institution
he so highly esteemed. Another be-
quest of £lO/10/- was made by Mr.
Joseph Rice.

DiSlrid Achievement in The Great War Period, 1914-1918
The Great War took its toll on this district, but many ot
the men who went have, like Lieut. Colonel E. T. Dean, D.5.0.,
(now President of the Show Society), Jas. Craig (Chairman of
the Co-operative Winery), and others, returned to fill a great
sphere in civic life, Anzac Services on April 25 each year com-
memorate the heroism, with community appreciation undimmed
after a score years—the large gatherings still contributing to
provide a measure of relief for the men still suffering as residt
of their War services.
Not only did the district provide men. There stands the
record of £28,410 raised in one month —October, 1918 —after
four years’ efforts. During that month the War Tank “Haig”
visited the district, and the late Mr. Virgo (then banker at
Nuriootpa) addressed meetings in connection with the Seventh
War Loan. To gain its Honour Flag, Angaston district was asked
to raise £25,000 —the same sum as Glenelg with 30,000 people.
But when the final tally was made, the district had gained its
Honour Flag, and had invested £27,000 in that one Loan —after
contributing to War funds £l4lO in Australia Days: Angaston
£450, Nuriootpa £220, Light’s Pass £220, Mount McKenzie £l2O,
and Keyneton £4OO.
Mr, John Dallwitz, as local War Loan Secretary, did a
lot of splendid work. Angaston scholars in that month brought
their cash contributions to £254; and it would not be possible
to assess the War efforts of the Red Cross and various patriotic
bodies. Nuriootpa established another record by putting up £450
for the Seventh War Loan in five minutes. Then when the French
Mission visited the district and General Pau was got out of bed
to join the celebration that heralded the signing of the armistice,
the district looked as confidently upon the new era. Its quota
for the Peace Loan of 1919 was fixed at £lB,OOO, but £24,700 was
subscribed and won the bronze tablet now in the Institute.
Angaston district Soldiers’ Monument, pictured on this
page, cost over £lOOO. Mr. C. H. Angas, who headed the list of
contributions with £3OO, designed the upper portion, representing
St. Michael’s triumph of Right over Might. By April, 1919 the
full amount of £650 had been raised for the bronze figure, which
was cast in England, and after the base had been prepared a
mound was built by a wonderful series of voluntary efforts which
also surrounded it with gardens.
On Anzac Day, 1921, the monument was unveiled by Mrs.
C. H. Angas. After a brief service in the Institute, there
was a procession to the monument. Following the Band was

Impossible as it is to adequately tribute the work done
during this period, mention must be made of the Cheer-up
Society, with Mr. Fulton Salter as president; Mr. R. M. Hardy,
secretary; Mr. E. E. Woods, treasurer; and Mr. E. T. Odgers as
auditor. Subsidiary efforts under its aegis supplied comforts for
the men at the front, who had been publicly farewelled,- and who
later were greeted at the Railway Station, Band in attendance.
This society obtained 75 medals for presentation to them. In
June, 1917, Mrs. C, H. Angas was patroness of the Knitting Club;
Mrs, I j, N. Salter, president; and Miss Min. Smith, secretary.


Mrs. P. S. Smith and Mrs. A. Salter
were organizers of the Concert Com-
pany that so materially helped on Aus-
tralia Days; whilst, in addition to the
work done by Mr. S. O. Smith, Mrs.
Smith had a stall at the Sale yards
and raised a good sum. Mrs, Alex.
Wishart and Mrs. G. Cadd were named
in reports as other outstanding work-
ers. For the Red Cross Fete in 1918,
Mrs. C. H. Angas threw open her Lind-
say Park grounds; the effort yielding
£450; and when the War ended, Mr,
J, B, Maley and his scholars at Angas-
ton had contributed £674 toward War
funds.
Visit of “Renown” Sailors
When the battleship “Renown” visit-
ed South Australia with the (then)
Prince of Wales, Angaston on July 8,
1920, entertained 300 of the sailors
under Lieut. Denham. Mr. E, T.
Odgers (District Clerk) was organizer
of the entertainment committee, whicli
included also Messrs. G. W. Chinner
(Council Chairman), J. P. Heggie, R.
M. Hardy, C. E, Nettell, S. Hill Smith,
O. Seppelt, L. N. Salter and S. E,
Tolley. The huge task of catering was
undertaken by a ladies’ committee in
charge of Mrs. P. S, Smith and Mrs.
Reusch. Cr. Chinner extended the civic
welcome. Total cost of the undertak-
ing was £72/17/6, toward which dist-
rict wineries contributed £5O.
The case containing trophies, now
located in the vestibule of Angaston
Institute, was placed there by public
subscription (£9) in 1927,
The fine crimson curtain at Angas-
ton Institute, with golden monogram
“A.1.” in laurel wreath, was installed
in 1925 at a cost of £67, raised mainly
by the efforts of Mr. and Mrs. H.
Broomhall.
Angaston’s present Police Station
was built in 1863. Prior to that, Pol-
ice Officer Dundas was in charge, his
quarters being in an old building some
distance behind the present Co-oper-
ative Packing Shed. Mounted Cons-
table Howe succeeded him, and then
Mounted Constable Plummer; but re-
cords were not kept until 1878, when
M.C. Deckert came. He was appointed
Senior Constable with rank of Corporal
in 1881, and became Sergeant in 1897;
being transferred to Adelaide as Bar-
racks Master in April of that year.
In those early days Angaston provid-
ed a valuable member for the Constab-
ulary in Trooper James Heggie, who
served in this area as well as doing
splendid work in other parts of the
State at a time when the blacks were
troublesome and a lawless element was
beginning to appear.
After Sgt. Deckert came Senior Con-
stable Dowling in 1897; M.C. Finch in
1899; Corporal Rumball in 1903; Sgt.
Hurley in 1904; and M.C. Grosser in
1905; M.C. Mullen, 1910; M.C. Reg.
Reed, 1918; M.C. Sheridan, 1923; M.C.
Lewis, 1928; M.C. Rosenberg, 1933.

C. Swan, Wm. Johnston, Thos Gepp,
J. T. Keats (from 1915), G. W. Hal-
combe (1920), S. D. Ronald (1923), W.

Gun-play in Murray Street
One of the most exciting incidents
in local Police work was arrest of an
alleged murderer following a revolver
duel in Murray Street. A Chinese gar-
dener in Adelaide had been shot, and
when Constable Grosser was advised
that the wanted man had camped near
Keyneton, he got away on his horse
and searched the locality. Capt. Otto
Thorn (just back from the Boer War)
and Mr. Wm. Sibley were chatting in
Sleader’s butcher shop (where the An-
gaston Garage is now situated) when
a stranger, answering the description
of the wanted man, drove up, but de-
cided after a moment’s thought to go
further.
In his sulky, he went as far as C. E.
Nettell’s cycle shop (where the Hostel
is now) and took in a cycle to be re-
paired. Mr. Thos. Perry (Hill & Co’s,
noted coachman) was there, and Con-
stable Grosser galloped up, hot on the
trail. He was about to make an arrest
when the stranger suddenly jumped
past him and across the street, where
he opened fire, Capt. Thorn quickly
got a rifle, but at a signal from the
Officer, stood ready. Constable Gros-
ser’s first shots brought one of the
man’s arms limply to his side, and he
rushed for shelter under the old bridge.
Constable Grosser finished the duel
from behind a tree, getting the man
to surrender and later brought him be-
fore the Adelaide Court, where he was
deemed to be mentally unbalanced and
was sent to a home.
Old Police Station Still Serves
Early in 1900 a move was made by
residents to have the old Institute (now
Masonic Hall) acquired for a Police
Court and Station, and another unsuc-
cessful agitation was begun in 1923,
when the Bank of Adelaide premises
were suggested as suitable. The Comr.
of Police and Inspector Birt made an
inspection in August of that year, but
considered the present old building
quite suitable if renovated. Renova-
tions were carried out, and since then
the District Council has made several
further representations without suc-
cess.
A local possession of value realised
by few pe >ple is the painting of the
British Coat-of-Arms which is hung
behind the Bench in Angaston Court.
The fine piece of artistic work has fre-
quently been praised by visiting Magis-
trates, but there is no record as to
who was the artist, or how it came
into possession of the Court.
A font to the memory of Captain
Ryder, who fell in the War, 1917, was
dedicated in Collingrove Church on
December 1, 1918.
Above the entrance to the hall at
Angaston Institute is an engraved and
framed plate placed there in April,
1920, by Angaston Returned Soldiers,
in grateful recognition of the work
done by ladies of the district during
the War period.


15 Years’ Effort Yields Di£tri& Hospital Valued at £12,000
Angaston District Hospital, to-day
valued at over £12,000, is a monument
to community effort for just sixteen
years. Prior to 1919 there were pri-
vate hospitals, and although handicap-
ped by lack of equipment and accom-
modation such as the bigger institu-
tion of to-day affords, they gave a
wonderful service. Perhaps one of the
best equipped and laid out was that
conducted by Sister Shields, and when
she relinquished her local association,
the Local Board of Health took over
her appliances. In April, 1919, Sister
Kitson decided to re-establish a pri-
vate hospital,, but sufficient support
was forthcoming to apparently justify
a community-owned institution.
The proposition was initially discus-
sed at a public 'meeting on July 16,
1919; Cr. J. P. Heggie presiding, and
Dr. Morris (then Inspector-General of
Hospitals) being present. On the mo-
tion of Messrs. D. S. Keightley and E.
T, Odgers the following motion was
carried: “That a poll of ratepayers in
the District Councils of Truro, Keyne-
ton, Blanchetown, Tanunda and An-
gaston be taken on the proposition that
a District Hospital be erected, the site
to be decided by the Government and
District Councils concerned, and that
a special rate of one penny in the
pound be levied for maintenance.”
This scheme never reached fruition,
for a later meeting at which about 80
people voted, turned down the proposal
by a majority of six. The matter was
not allowed to stand there, however,
and on January 21, 1920, Cr. J. P.
Heggie presided over a public meeting
which accepted the offer of Dr, Cowan
to sell for £l7OO the former home of
The District Hospital, Angaston, as it was in 1925
William Hague (one-time State Treas-
urer); Dr. Cowan donating £5OO to-
ward the hospital scheme. The adjoin-
ing piece of land was bought from Mr.
W. H. Codrington for £l2O, and the
estimated cost of remodelling the pro-
perty for a public hospital was £4,000.
Mr. E. T. Odgers was elected secretary
of a Hospital Committee.
The work proceeded, and a Board
of Management was appointed. Mr.
L, N. Salter was first president; the
other representatives being Messrs. J.
E. Swann, G. W. Chinner, D. S. Keight-
ley and W. Sibley (Angaston); W,
Petras and E. E. Kleemann (Tanunda);
O. J. Krieg (Nuriootpa); E. R. Mickan
(Stockwell); F. C. Linke (Moculta);
P. R. Evans ''Keyneton); and Mr. E.
T. Odgers, secretary. The House Com-
mittee appointed comprised Messrs. L.
N. Salter, D, S, Keightley, W. Sibley
and J. E. Swann.
The building was opened as a public
hospital on October 1, 1920, Nurse
Richards being in charge as matron.
The first baby, arriving that morning,
was Kevin, son of Mr, and Mrs. Cliff
Wishart (now at Eden Valley). The
initial operations entailed an overdraft
at the bank, this being guaranteed by
Messrs. L. N. Salter, G. W. Chinner
and Dr, Cowan.
The official opening was one of Ang-
aston’s big days; £520 being made by
a special effort, an outstanding feature
of which was a Returned Soldiers’
Ugly Man CompetiPon, won by Mr.
Harry Davies. Other candidates were
Messrs. W. G. Marsh, Doug. Jackson,
J. T. Sowerby, H. Lock and W. Craig.
The big fete held on that day was
organized by a Ladies’ Committee with
Mrs. P. S. Smith as president, and Mrs,
J. E. Swann as secretary. Mrs, C. H.
Angas declared the fete open. Dr.
Morris officially opened the Hospital;
and with him on the dais were Mr. D.
S, Keightley (Chairman of the Board
of Management), Mr. J. E. Swann (as
Chairman of Trustees), and Mr. E. T.
Odgers (secretary). The grounds had
previously been placed in order by a
series of working “bees” organized bj r
Mr. Josh. Whelan.
At the first annual meeting of sub-
scribers, held on October 31, 1921, Mr.
Odgers reported that 38 babies had
been born during the year, 140 patients
had been treated, and there were 48
operations. Additional buildings and
improvements during the year involved
a further £1,600. Two beds were don-
ated by the Angaston Red Cross at a
total cost of £5O; Mr. and Mrs. P. S.
Smith gave another bed, and the Red
Cross branch at Keyneton made a don-
ation of £4O.
In 1925 a scheme was advanced un-
der which life membership was con-
ferred upon donors of £l5/15/-, and
certificates as original life members
were issued to Col. E. T. Dean, Mrs.
Dean, Dr. W. A. Pryor, Mr. R. R.
Keynes, Mr. J. Keynes, Mr. R, N.
Keynes, Mrs, M, A. Evans, Mr. P. R.

J. P. Richardson, Mr. J. E. Gramp, Mr.
G. W. Chinner, Mr. F. A. H. Hahn,

beds, two cots for children, and ten
cribs for babies. The kitchen was re-
modelled last year, and scullery, laun-
dry, airing and drying rooms added to
the more commodious staff quarters.
Nuriootpa’s
Court Officials
Nuriootpa was served by the Angas-
ton and Tanunda Police until in 1911
there was a sudden influx of workers
in connection with the building of the
railway line, and an officer was station-
ed there. Foot-Constable Eaton was
the first officer, his quarters being in
Murray Street, in a house owned by
Mr. Schadel (adjacent to Mr. Joseph
Hatch’s). There also, temporary cells
were built.
Constable Gassner followed, the
police quarters during his time being
transferred to a house further along
Murray Street, close to the Para Riv-
er. Foot-Constable M. Barry was ap-
pointed to Nuriootpa in 1914; Cons-
table Kelly in 1915; M.C. R. Reed in
1916; and then M.Cs. E. J. Davis in
1918; W. P. Dermody in 1919; C. D.
McCrea in 1922; R. A. Pyne in 1928;
and F. C. B. Theile (present officer,
and an old Nuriootpa boy) in 1933.
In 1927 the present well-appointed
Police Station with Court room and
residence, on the Greenock road, was
built for approximately £2,100; Con-
stable McCrea moving into his new
quarters in June, 1927.
District’s Only Woman Justice.
Mrs. R. E. Baird (nee Dorothy A.
Martin) is the district’s only woman
Justice of the Peace since her appoint-
ment at Nuriootpa in 1932. She is
the first woman here to have had that
honour conferred upon her; her prac-
tical knowledge and sympathetic nature
being of incalculable service in delicate
litigation where the presence of a wom-
an is particularly desirable. She has
served on the Bench at Nuriootpa and
Angaston as well as having tempered
justice with kindly consideration in
many matters that did not come up for
hearing.
Other Justices who have officiated
at Nuriootpa are Messrs. T. A. Pitman,
W. Appelt, L. Salter, L. W. Habich,
G. W. Krieg, F. W. Gursansky, S. E.
Tolley, F. P. Shipster, J. A. Maywald,
M. E. Heuzenroeder, H. B. Scholz, J.
Dallwitz, J. A. Craig, M. M. Sexton, A.
O. Nettelbeck; and Messrs. P. G. T.
Kernich and H. B. Braunack, who are
also Justices for Greenock district.

In the Federal House.
Patrick McMahon Glynn, first mem-
ber for Angas in the Federal House of
Representatives, had a wonderful re-
cord. He had been a member of the
State Assembly for 1887-1890 and 1895
till 1901, having been Attorney Gener-
al in the brief Solomon Ministry. He
entered the new Federal House in 1901,
and was defeated by Joel Moses Gabb
in 1919. He was Attorney General
1909-10, Minister for External Affairs
1913-14, and for Home and Territories
1917-20; being made K.C. in 1913.
Mr. J. M. Gabb won the seat in 1919
by 9468 to 9217; defeated Mr. George
Ritchie (11,192 to 8,090) in 1922; and
was then defeated by Mr. W. Langdon
Parsons (20,428 to* 20,178) in 1925.
In 1928 Mr. Parsons defeated M. B.
Woods (25,372 to 17,325), but was him-
self defeated by Mr. J. M, Gabb in
1929 (25,679 to 21,239). Mr. Gabb
easily retained his seat in 1931, when
he polled 37,719 to Mr. D. S. Fraser’s
11,390.
Before the ensuing Federal elections
there was a re-distribution, and in 1934
Mr. Charles Allan Seymour Hawker
was elected for the new Division of
Wakefield, his total being 31,493, that
of M. A. Smedley (Labour) 9,274, and
W. T. Duggan (Douglas Social) 7615.
In each instance the representatives
have been men of outstanding character
who followed the path dictated by their
reasoned judgment. Mr. Gabb was dy-
namic; Mr. Parsons, the quiet diplomat;
whilst Mr. Hawker, returned soldier,
has declined Ministerial honours, and
combines all the virtues of a states-
man in his quiet unassuming nature.

STOCK WELL HUNT CLUB, FORMED 1893
Forty-three years ago a few young
men from Ebenezer and Stockwell went
out on a selected Saturday during May
or June in the surrounding district for
a day’s shooting. A year or two
later others had joined, making Stock-
well the starting point and concluding
their annual gatherings with crowning
of the king and presentation of trophies
at the local hotel. Originally the out-
ings were for one day, made per spring
waggon either to St. Kitts or east of
Dutton.
Setting out before dawn, the first
rays of the sun found members ready
at the starting point of the day’s shoot-
ing. The weather seemed then much
wetter, and bitter cold was often ex-
perienced in the open conveyance. The
spirit of the hunters, however, never
waned, and after a few years the out-
ings were extended to two days, which
necessitated camping out for a night
in some deserted farm hut; and where
this was not possible, behind some
bushes or an old friendly strawstack.
A few more enthusiastic hare hunt-
ers from Light’s Pass and Moppa join-
ed the party, and with the advent of
motor transport, the outings were ex-
tended to three days. On each trip
more than 100 miles were covered,
new fields being explored each year.
Of late years, since hares have made
their appearance in fair numbers and
extra large size from the Victorian bor-
der toward the River Murray, the an-
nual outing has been to country east
of the River. Three years ago a re-
cord score of just over 100 hares and
five foxes, besides numerous rabbits,
was established.
It has been the custom for the hunt-
er scoring the largest number of points
to be crowned “King” of the year’s
outing, and this coveted honour has
been won by the following members
on more than one occasion: Gus. John
(Stockwell), Will Boehm, Jack and
Gottlieb Hahn (Light’s Pass) and Otto
Grosskopf (Moppa), Paul Zander has
for the last 20 years without mishap
conveyed the party on their outings in
his motor lorry.
In all the years there has never been
the slightest unpleasantness. Present
members of the club are Messrs. Gus.
John, John Dallwitz, Adolph Mader,
Will Boehm, John Hahn, Gottlieb
Hahn, Paul Zander, Albert Pfeiffer,
Alfred Nitschke, Otto Grosskopf, Emil
Schultz and Paul Sporn; whilst junior
members include Gordon and Ernst
Boehm, Bernie Sporn and Roy Gallasch,
Mr. Arthur Reusch has been appointed
first aid officer and official photograph-
er; Mr. John Dallwitz is known as
“the Commandant,” and Mr. Gus. John
as “Gunner.” These latter two arc
original members, still going strong.
The Hope of Angaston Tent No. 17,
Independent Order of Rechabites, was
founded on December 15, 1886 by the
late Bro. J. E. Swann; other foun-
dation members being David Swann,
W. S. Smith, Geo. Cadd, Dan Vaughan,
Alex Wishart, F. J. Tallack, G, L.
Swann and Robert Smith.
Bro J. E. Swann was appointed as

business interests made necessary his
resignation. Bro. Albert Sibley was
appointed to the vacancy, and has now
been secretary for 39 years. Bro. G.
Cadd has also served for very many
years as the Treasurer and Sick Pay
Officer.

Nuriootpa Band since 1880; Rotunda Opened in 1935
Nuriootpa Band was founded in
June, 1880, mainly through the efforts
of Mr. Otto Riedel, who then was a
clarionet player in Angaston Band.
When Messrs. Friedrich and Rudolph
Gilgen, Swiss musicians, came to Nuri-
ootpa in 1880, Mr. Riedel saw the op-
portunity to form a Band in his home
town, and he arranged for the initial
financing. Mr. F, Gilgen accepted the
conductorship, other foundation mem-
bers being Messrs. R. Gilgen, Otto Rie-
del, Carl Kindler, Ernst Kranz, Emil
and Richard Thamm, Wm. and Carl
Scholz, Gus. Riedel, Fred Kraehe and
Chris. Linke. The latter two came res-
pectively from Gnadenfrei and Sep-
peltsfield.
Warnecke; and when the latter died
in 1915, his place was filled by Mr.
Joe Hatch. Record was made at the
1919 annual meeting of the fine serv-
ice given by the late E. Kindler, and
Mr. O. J. Krieg, elected to the vacancy,
acted also as secretary; Mr. W, Appelt
being made president. Band property
in 1920 was valued at £IG4. During
the year Mr. Chas. Scholz was tendered
a social in recognition of 42 years’ as-
sociation with the Band, and an arm-
chair was given him. As an outstand-
ing euphonium player, he won numer-
ous medals in competitions, and con-
tinued playing for 54 years (1932).
When he passed in May, 1935, full
musical honours were accorded at the
graveside.
The first set of instruments cost £BO
and, with exception of a French sax-
horn, were imported from Switzerland.
Messrs. Gilgens’ carpentering and me-
chanics’ shop in Murray Street, served
as first practice room. The same pre-
mises were also used for practices of
the early Gnadenfrei Band (that cen-
tre being re-named Marananga in
1917). This Band had also engaged
Mr, F. Gilgen as conductor, but as
his trips to Gnadenfrei involved quite
an outlay for travelling expenses, the
enthusiastic bandsmen preferred to
walk to Nuriootpa for practice—s to 6
miles each way. Among Gnadenfrei
bandsmen who practised at Nuriootpa
were Messrs. Kraehe and Linke (men-
tioned in Nuriootpa Band), Albert
Fritsche, Carl Kobelt, Wm. Keller, Ja-
kob Krebs, Carl and Heinrich Otto,
Rudolph Tummel and Ern. Kranz.
When Mr, Gilgen left Nuriootpa, Mr.
Otto Riedel took the baton. Then
came Herr Anton Wolf, noted Aus-
trian violinist. He had come to Aus-
tralia with a touring Austrian Band
which disbanded while here. Herr
Wolf found his way to Nuriootpa, and
accepted the Band conductorship there.
Mr. Ern. Kindler succeeded Herr Wolf
about 1896, holding office until his
death in 1919. He was a very fine
cornetist and frequently played in the
ranks when other conductors could be
found. One of these latter was Mr.
Kiesel, German cornetist, who also con-
ducted Angaston Band for a time. He
led Nuriootpa in the old Barossa and
Light Band Contests; Mr. Adamson
had charge for another; Sgt.-Major
Steele had the baton for 1912 contests,
and Mr, W. Thorne (S.A. Railways
Band conductor) acted in 1913.
Among early bandsmen were Messrs.
E. Schaedel, T. Tscharke, B. Thamm,
A. Liebich, W, Coulthard (also secre-
tary for a long period), Joe and Will
Hatch, Carl Krieg, W. Atkins, George
and Fred Lange, W. Scholz and Gus.
Krieg—some of them continuing with
later bandsmen: Martin Kindler, Ed.
Zimmermann, W. Ash, Oswald Krieg
(present conductor, who succeeded W.
Coulthard as secretary), Chas. and
Martin Glatz, R, Radford, P. Laucke,
Jack Traeger, Gus. Keller, Bert. Riedel,
A. B. Schulz and B. Weidenbach.
Helping Nuriootpa in competition
work were also Messrs. Chas,, W. and
A. Barratt, W. and B, Smith and H.
Johnson (of Angaston Band) who oft-
en walked to Nuriootpa for practice.
The Band’s first trustees were Messrs.
H. Juncken, C. Scholz, G. Krieg, L.
Mr. A. G. Kretschmer became presid-
ent when Mr. Appelt left Nuriootpa in
1921, and in 1924 Mr, Jas. A. Craig
was appointed, with Mr, R. Hatch as
secretary. The Band went into recess
after 1925, but was enthusiastically re-
vived in 1930, with Mr. W. Jarrett as
conductor, Mr. O. J. Krieg as band-
master, and Mr. R. Hatch secretary.
Meanwhile, Mr. J. B. Traeger (State
champion double Bb bass player and
former Nuriootpa bandsman, then play-
ing with Tanunda) taught a good num-
ber of young men to play. In 1931,
when Mr. A. G. Kretschmer was made
president and Mr. A. P. Beckmann
secretary, Mr. Traeger became conduc-
tor on Mr. Krieg’s retirement, and re-
tained the position till 1936. The band
entered several competitions and usual-
ly shared in the awards; whilst under
Drum-Major Bert Boehm, one of the
leading marching combinations in S.A.
was developed, yielding numerous
quickstep and street-march prizes. At
Tanunda in 1934 they won £35 in all.
Nuriootpa Band Rotunda, opened on June 2, 1935.


|rc& jf g-K. Vj m
Mr. M. Sexton was president in 1932
with Mr. L. Fiebig secretary; trustees
then appointed being Messrs. R. E.
Baird, A. L. Siegele, W. Boehm and
A. G. Kretschmer. The Band was fit-
ted out with uniforms, and a ladies’
committee was elected with Mrs. E.
Zimmermann as president and Mrs. R.
E, Baird secretary. Mr. N. R. Barratt
was ensuing Band president and Mr.
H. Gabel (still in office) secretary in
1933. A drive for funds for new in-
struments that year yielded £220, of
which £l5B was derived from a Queen
competition in which candidates were
Misses Mavis Crook, Melva Fiebig,
Daphne Sexton and Irene Hausler; the
latter winning with 11,548 votes. Mrs.
N, R. Barratt was at head of the ladies’
committee during the effort.
Build £320 Band Rotunda
Mr. F. W. Boehm was made presid-
ent in 1935, and he with Messrs. J. B.
Traeger, H, Gabel, R. E. Baird, H, L.
Sheard and A. R. Summerton were a
committee to inspect sites for a band
rotunda and practice room. On their
recommendation a block of land at the
northern end of the town was purchas-
ed from Mr. J. Krieg for £l4O, and Mr.
J. B. Traeger built the rotunda for
£321/10/-. The handsome structure
was opened on June 2, 1935 by Mr. W.
Coulthard, who had given £lOO toward
it. Messrs. H. L, Sheard, A. R. Sum-
merton and Tolley, Scott & Tolley, Ltd.
each gave £5O. A year later the build-
ing and land, etc. —costing about £5OO
was free of debt.
Another effort in 1935 fitted bands-
men with leggings and boots at a cost
of £43, £25/10/- of which, however,
was refunded by bandsmen who made
these their own property. Mr. A. R.
Milway was made president this year,
and Mr, O. J. Krieg succeeded Mr. J.
B, Traeger as bandmaster. Nuriootpa
bandsmen who served this year are;
Messrs. E. Tamke, R. E. Hahn, D
Krieg, E. and G. Boehm, F. and R.
Boehm, D. and K. Boehm, F. Grosser,

the position. Mr. A. B. Schulz was
secretary in 1910; Mr. J. Habich in
1911; Mr. A. Stelzer in 1915; and Mr.
P. B. Schulz (present officer) was ap-
pointed in 1921.
Soon after establishment of the So-
ciety, the other three boundaries were
newly fenced. The cemetery was meas-
ured, plots pegged, the grounds tidied,
and a beautification scheme instituted
under which four cotton palms and 50
roses were planted in 1911. Further
rose plantings have since been made,
the pruning having been done gra-
tis by Mr. Seward Plush, of Dorrien.
The state of the road from Greenock
highway to the cemetery, particularly
in wet weather, was for a number of
years a matter of concern to the soci-
ety; but after conferring with Angas-
ton Council, the latter agreed in 1931
to metal the road, the society contrib-
uting £2O toward the cost. To mark
the State Centenary, attractive new en-
trance gates have this year been erect-
ed; the total cost, inclusive of pillars,
being £23/7/5. The present executive
comprises Messrs. C. Warnecke, P. B.
Schulz, J. Habich, A. Stelzer, J. Tamke
and J. Keller. The latter, who is vice-
president, is also curator.
One of the first flour mills in S.A.
was constructed by Mr, Christian Sie-
gele who, with his wife, came out in
1864. He was later associated with the
old Mill in Penrice, and then went to
the Mill at Truro. His services were
sought in Queensland, and while there
his son, Mr. J. C. Siegele was born. A
year afterward the family returned to
Stockwell. In later years Mr, J. C. Sie-
gele had the blacksmith’s shop at Nu-
riootpa, which subsequently was taken
over and developed as a garage by Mr.
A. L, Siegele, who opened a branch
of the smithy at Angaston, where pre-

Whete T.S.T. Brandy is Made
E, A. Tolley, was born in Adelaide 74
years ago, and on completion of his
education in Adelaide, studied in Lon-
don under Professors Thompson and
Bloxarn, going afterwards to gain ex-
perience in the south of France. In
1888 Mr. E. A. Tolley and his brother
Douglas were allied with Mr. Thomas
Scott, the Bermondsey Distiller, in the
founding of Tolley, Scott & Tolley; Mr.
D. A. Tolley having been born in Sur-
rey and come out with his parents at
WHEREVER hospitals exist T.S.T.
brandy is known and valued. In
the homes of the wise it is kept for
any emergency; in the well-ordered
residence, or wherever men gather, it
has a place of prominence, symbolising
the spirit so typical of Australians
whether of a century ago or to-day.
Men of stability and judgment invari-
ably call for T.S.T, Brandy—choicest
product of the Angas Park Distillery,
owned and controlled by Messrs. Tolley,
Scott & Tolley since the early days of
South Australia.
The distillation of brandy has re-
ceived their specialised attention to a
degree that has built up a big Austra-
lasian and export trade, every bottle
bearing the Government guarantee and
the reputation of a firm unassailable
in the business world. The endorse-
ment of judges is indicated by the host
of awards that have been won over
many years. Mr. Scott, one of the
partners, died over thirty years ago,
and since that time the Tolley family
has controlled the destinies of this im-
portant enterprise.
Mr. S. E. Tolley, Nuriootpa, is chair-
man of the board of directors, and has
associated with him Mr. L. J. Tolley.
The original founder of the firm, Mr.
a slack season, 3,000 gallons of proof
brandy are distilled each day from
15,000 gallons of wine. In a busy peri-
od this quantity is trebled.
The whole of the bottling is carried
out under Government supervision, and
never was the demand greater than it
is to-day. The advance made by this
firm, together with the remarkable
popularity of T.S.T. Brandy, is indi-
cated by the stock of no less than a
quarter of a million gallons of brandy
and wine, while a bonded store built
about eight years ago accommodates
a further 100,000 gallons. Still more
recent extensions bring the storage now
to over 500,000 gallons.
Thus the fertile land of this district,
its clear sunshine and well-directed in-
dustry, has established another source
yielding fame as well as wealth for
Barossa. Mr. Douglas Tolley owns a
magnificent vineyard of upwards of
100 acres, situated in the Hope Valley,
which also is considered one of the
show wineries of the State. Plere, how-
ever, the product is chiefly wines of
light dry type. All T.S.T. Brandy is
matured in the wood for at least two
years before being sent to distributing
agents to meet the insistent demand
for T.S.T. —Australia’s best brandy.
a very early age. The firm commenc-
ed operations at Stepney, and after
extensions in Adelaide, placed a com-
plete and up-to-date distillery at Angas
Park in 1904. In 1908 the winery of
Messrs. S. & W, Sage, Nuriootpa, was
acquired with 40 acres of vines, and
further additions have brought the
present holding to 600 acres of vines
in full bearing. Up to 5,000 tons of
grapes are each season crushed to meet
the firm’s requirements, whilst even in

residents, over 200 trees have been
planted during the past season, and
the scheme is to be continued during
next season.
Mr, Dallwitz has been an Angaston
Councillor for four years, and was ap-
pointed Chairman during the current
year. He was made a Justice of the
Peace in 1910. For several years after
his arrival in Angaston, he Was an
active member of the Angaston Rifle
Club, holding for some time the office
of secretary. During the Great War
he was secretary of the local Recruit-
ing Committee and War Loans Com-
mittee. Elsewhere in this publication
is acknowledged his service for many
district institutions, including the A.
H. & F. Society, of which he has been
secretary and president; the Floricul-
tural Society (present president); and
Angaston Hospital Board.
He has held office as president of
the Bowling Club, and greatly enjoys
that game, whilst, with other members
of a “clan” known as the Murray
Wanderers’ Fishing and Angling Soci-
ety, he greatly enjoys the periodical
outings to the River Murray. Since
the society has been in possession of
its own chalet on the banks of the
Murray, he has been its secretary and
treasurer. As one of the two original
members of Stockwell Hunt Club start-
ed over forty years ago, he joins in
the annual three-days outing—and he
pays the Bachelor Tax.
Pictured here is Angaston
Bowling Club’s picturesque
clubhouse. It cost £427, and
was opened in November,
1927. Mr. G. N. Dallwitz
was the architect and builder.
The Angaston Bowling Club
Angaston Bowling Green, one of the
town’s show places, nicely hedged and
in a pleasant spot, was opened in Jan-
uary, 1923; Mr. R. M. Hardy being
the first president, and Mr. D. Sj
Keightley (who did a wonderful lot
of organizing for years before) the
first secretary. Ten of the original
32 members are still actively associ-
ated with the club. Mr, J. M, Paterson
was the next president, and was foll-
owed by Messrs. G. W. Chinner, John
Dallwitz, G. N. Dallwitz, D. S. Keight-
ley, J. E, Swann, F. H. S. Johnson,
and now G. W. Chinner. Mr. D. S.
Keightley was succeeded as secretary
by Mr. W. J. Bailey, and for a num-
ber of years now Mr, Albert Scholz
has held that office. Past champions
of the club have been Messrs. J. T.
Sowerby, W. J. Bailey, B. S. Tres-
cowthick, F. A. M. Kindler, H, S.
Blunt, G. V, Lewis, G. Trescowthick
and C. Trescowthick. The office of
Green Manager, held for many years
by Mr. O. Ritter, is now filled by Mr.
G. W. Chinner. Following erection
of the Clubhouse in 1927, the ground
has been improved, gardens planted,
a flagstaff put up, and the clubhouse
fitted with every modern convenience.
Mr. P, S. Smith, valuable supporter
since inception, this year presented the
club with his debenture of £lOO on
its falling due for repayment, an act
that was greatly appreciated.


Nuriootpa’s Centennial Park Eliminates Old Recreation Ground
The establishment of Centennial
Park, commemorating the State’s first
hundred years, relegates to the past
Nuriootpa’s original Park, founded in
1894. Situated on the north side of
the old Kapunda road, a little beyond
the Fifth Street intersection, the old
ground on which many big sporting
contests have been decided, was about
eight acres of scrub land, bought from
Mr. C. Krieg for £7O. The deposit of
£1 was paid on October 5, 1891, and
the balance in 1894. The prime mover
in establishing the park was Mr. S. H.
Davey.
The trust deed, dated May 19, 1894,
was signed by Messrs. Carl Krieg, Lud-
wig Warnecke, George Sage, John
Coulthard, Seward Plush, C. A. Riedel
and Henrick E. Olafsen, who were ap-
pointed trustees at a public meeting
on October 9, 1891. Community efforts
resulted in the raising of £ll2 by May
2 of the following year; a sports meet-
ing having yielded £32, and public sub-
scriptions £BO. Messrs. D. &J, Fowler
gave £5/5/-, and Mr. J. H. Angas £5.
The ground had been cleared and
an arena laid out by 1904, when Mr.
H. Krieg, who was president, had with
him on the committee Messrs. A. W.
Sleader and J. H. Keller (vice-presid-
ents), M. T. Ellis (secretary and treas-
urer), T. Sage, J. Drinkwater, Wm.
Coulthard, H. Juncken, H. Jantke and
E. Cartwright; Mr. J. F. Zimmermann
being auditor. Trees on the western
side of the ground, however, were still
being removed, some being used for
fencing the park; and in their place
Nuriootpa scholars under Mr. J. Drink-
water planted thirty sugar gums.
Mr. Polst planted a further 270 trees
on behalf of the committee, each mem-
her of which contributed 5/6 toward
the £2/15/- involved for planting. An
abnormally dry summer followed, dur-
ing which the trees were watered with-
out charge by Mr. H. Jantke. The 50
trees that died were replaced in 1906.
Mr. T. Sage gave posts for a big swing
erected in 1904. Mr. J. H. Keller made
the box, Mr. H. Juncken the stays and
Mr. Ellis contributed the ironwork for
which Mr. Sleader gave the material.
Mr. W. Coulthard lent free for two
years £lO toward cost of ring fencing.
In 1905 older trees in the park were
topped, and Nuriootpa Football Club
was allowed use of the oval, provided
they erected goal posts of sawn timber
and painted them. Mr. E. Kindler
joined the committee in 1905; Messrs.
W. Coulthard and E. A. Tolley being
the vice-presidents.
Thereafter interest waned, and for
five years meetings were not held. Mr.
Ellis’s resignation of the secretaryship
in 1910 resulted in a meeting of 23
subscribers, the balance sheet present-
ed to them showing £7/13/- in hand.
A new committee was elected compris-
ing Messrs, A, C. Joliffe (patron), H.
Krieg (re-elected president), W. Coul-
thard, H. Richardson, H. Juncken (as
vice-presidents), C. A. L. Virgo (secre-
tary), W. Appelt, H. Jantke, A. Pit-
man, B. Zimmermann, A. E. Cart-
wright, J. D. A. Drinkwater, J. Car-
roll, C. Scholz, J, Keller and E.
Kindler,
In 1911, Messrs. W. Coulthard and
H. Juncken were vice-presidents; with
Messrs. L. Zimmermann, E. Crambrook,
C. J. Habich and R. E. Baird commit-
teemen. A rule was added to the con-
stitution forbidding the introduction of
intoxicating liquor on the grounds on
picnic days, and the military authorities
were given free use of the grounds
for drill. Mr. Ellis, who had taken
over secretaryship of Nuriootpa district
Show, sought co-operation of the com-
mittee by lending the Show buildings
for drill instruction.
Messrs. Jos. Hatch, A. R. Summerton
and P. Goldsworthy joined the com-
mittee in 1913, when Mr. J. Keller was
made a vice-president, as was Mr. H.
Krieg a year later, when he vacated
the presidency in favour of Mr. C. A.
L. Virgo, whose place as secretary was
taken by Mr. A. G. Kretschmer. In
1914 the Show Society gave a donation
of £l5 to the Park, and then for the
War period the meetings were dis-
continued.
Subscribers met on February 19,
1920, when there was an attendance
of 49, and the new committee, elected
on March 2, comprised Messrs. A. Say-
ers (president), H. Krieg, J. Hatch, W.
Coulthard, H. Juncken, J, Keller, A. G.
Kretschmer and A. E. Cartwright
(vice-presidents), J. B. Warnest (sec-
retary, in office till 1936), A. H. Paech,
O. W. Kretschmer, I. L. Braidwood,
S. Hatch, C. J, Habich, W. Appelt, Carl
Warnecke, O. J. Krieg, F. Liebich, H.
A. Scholz, R. Bahnisch, T. Rothe, A,
Schiller and A. Neumann,
Move to Erect Grandstand
Messrs. H. Juncken and I. L. Braid-
wood were the sub-committee which in-
vestigated the possibility of altering
the old Show building so as to form a
grandstand and dressing rooms; but
they considered that the material was
unsuited and would result in a lot of
waste. They submitted a plan for the
proposed grandstand to cost about
£225. Seven tenders were received in
response to the oner to sell the old
buildings. The highest was from the
Producers’ Supply & Butter Co., for
£212, which the committee considered
inadequate.
The old Show building was then con-
verted into a large shelter with dress-
ing rooms at rear; Messrs. J. Hatch,
W. Coulthard and W. Appelt being the
sub-committee in charge. Cost of the
alterations and new material was £59,
and £5/12/1 was expended on painting.
The surplus material was sold for £27
12/4. This work involved a temporary
loan of £29, advanced by Mr. Wm.
Coulthard and repaid in 1922.
Mr, Seward Plush being the only re-
maining trustee residing in the district,
a meeting of ratepayers was held on
May 26, when Messrs. O. J. Krieg, J.
E. Plush, Cyril Warnecke, A. R. Sum-
merton, J. B. Traeger, G. C. Kaesler
and J. B. Warnest were appointed. In
the following year, Mr. A. G. Kretsch-
mer was president; Dr. Deßavin, M.
J. Timmens, W. Coulthard, H. Juncken,
J. Keller, J. Hatch and A. Cartwright
vice-presidents; and Messrs. A. J, Chap-
man, A. Lange and W. Tuohy were
also on the committee. In 1922, Messrs
S, Turnbull, L. Nenke, J. Ford, A, L.
Siegele, E. Knispel, E. Hoffmann and
P, G, Edwards held office; Mr, J. A.
Craig being an additional vice-president
in 1923.
On payment of a rental of £l/1/-
a year (increased in 1929 to £l/11/6),
Nuriootpa Tennis Club was in 1921 per-
mitted to put down asphalt courts for
its exclusive use. In all the club im-
posed four courts, and in 1926 the
Park Committee advanced £2O at five
per cent, interest, to enable the Tennis
Club to erect a shelter shed and kitch

en. The loan was repaid a year later,
when difficulty arose in regard to the
admission of tennis players to the park
when it had been hired to other in-
stitutions. In 1929 Mr. W. S. Jarrett
(banker and noted organist) placed the
issue before the Park Committee, and
Messrs. A. Lange, W. R. G. Sharpe and
J. B. Warnest were deputed to draft
new rules whereby free access was giv-
en to tennis members by a private en-
trance to the grounds.
sident and held office till 1936. Mr. A.
G. Kretschmer joined in 1929, and be-
came vice-president in 1931, when Dr.
Hoopmann was a committeeman.
The executive in 1932, which has held
office until the old park ceased to exist
as such, comprised Messrs. A. E. Lange
(president), A. G. Kretschmer (vice-
president), J. B. Warnest (secretary),
O. W. Kretschmer, A. B. Gersch, A.
Schiller, M. Sexton and Dr. F. W.
Hoopmann. Thus closes the story of
Nuriootpa’s original park; the property
being offered by tender, but withheld
for later sub-division into building al-
lotments. Disposal, however, had not
been finalised when the Centenary cele-
brations took place.
The limits offered by the old Park
in regard to beautification, prompted a
move to secure the new site which, on
November 4, will be officially designat-
ed “Nuriootpa Centennial Park.” The
old Park Committee called a public
meeting in March, 1920, to consider
buying from Mr. W. Coulthard the
then-vacant block of land fronting
Murray Street, adjacent to the old In-
stitute. The acres was, however,
found to be too small for the purpose,
and subsequent sub-division yielded
Memorial Avenue and allotments now
carrying ten residences, the Memorial
Hall, bowling and croquet greens, a
shop, and the new Coulthard Memorial
Church,
A half-inch service from the Warren
water supply was laid on to the Park
in 1920. There followed the peak foot-
ball period when hire of the ground at
£2, plus 10 per cent, of takings, to the
local club returned £B/4/9. In 1926,
trees around the oval were grubbed to
afford increased car-parking space, and
the oval was graded under direction
of Mr. A. Lange, whilst in 1928 a |-
chain strip of land on the east and 1-
chain on the north sides of the oval,
was purchased from Mr. J. E. Krieg
for £6O/11/6.
The extension was paid for by pub-
lic subscription, with a donation of £9
2/6 by Mr. W, Coulthard, who had
offered to give 25 per cent. Addition-
al trees were then grubbed near the
oval, which was enlarged and a new
ring fence erected. The question of
Sunday sport came for decision in 1929,
the Park Committee prohibiting match
or tournament play on that day.
The large committees, introduced in
1920, were discontinued in 1925, when
the executive consisted of Messrs. P. G.
Edwards (president), W. Tuohy and
W. R. G. Sharpe (vice-presidents), A.
Lange, O. W. Kretschmer and A. Schil-
ler. In the following year Mr. F. Hol-
zerland (then Stationmaster) and G.
C. Kaesler were on the committee, and
Mr. B. Gersch joined in 1927. There-
after Mr. A. E. Lange was elected pre-
Nuriootpa Cricket Team of 1901.
Back row —Messrs. H. Juncken, L, Tabe, Seward Plush, P. O’Brien, Ned
O’Brien, T. Sage, W. Coulthard, E. Kindler and F. Sauer. Front row —
Sam Plush, F. and P. Warnecke, L. Zimmermann and J. Hatch.
In June, 1927, Mr. W. Coulthard of-
fered to donate the corner block fac-
ing Stockwell and Light’s Pass roads.
The offer was declined on account of
a dip at centre of the land, and after
Mr. Coulthard had refused an offer of
£l,OOO for it, the property was bought
at £5O per acre for the High School
to be built shortly. Early this year
the Centennial Park Committee bought
from Mr. Coulthard 184 acres at £5O
per acre —just half the amount Mr.
Coulthard had declined to accept for
it. He also headed the project with
a donation of £250. Dr. F. W. Hoop-
mann, Messrs. H. L, Sheard and A. R.
Summerton each gave £5O, and other
generous contributions followed.
The new grounds embrace an oval
600 ft. x 400 ft., and beautification
schemes suggested by the Government
Town Planner, are now in hand. The
executive in charge of the work com-
prises Messrs. H. L. Sheard (president),
Dr. Hoopmann and O. J. Krieg (vice-
presidents), J. S. Lord (secretary), H.
Gabel (assistant secretary), A. Reusch
(treasurer), E. L. Gooden, J, B. Trae-
ger, H. B. Scholz and A. Milway. The
Nuriootpa Centenary effort aims at
raising £2,000 for the new Park, and
magnificent response of townspeople
has made this now almost an accom-
plished fact. A Queen Competition,
won by Miss Myra Rohrlach with
35,402 votes, raised £400; the other
Queens being Misses Kath. O’Brien,
Gwen Kretschmer and Bona Schiller.
Mrs. A. B. Robin, on May 27, 1927,
officially opened the new gates at Nuri-
ootpa School, presented by the Welfare
Club, Mrs. Sharpe then being president.


Mt. McKenzie
Roesler (treasurer), C. and E. Roesler,
and J. Droegemueller. For several
years Mrs. W. Wegener was secretary.
Mount McKenzie was originally an
aboriginal reserve, game being plenti-
ful, and a good supply of permanent
water being found in the upper reaches
of the North Para River. When in
1892 the land was cut up for home-
steads, it became known as “The
Blocks,” the first areas being purchas-
ed by Messrs. John Hearl anti G. A.
Droegemueller.
Always progressive, the community
played a notable part in raising funds
for patriotic purposes during 1914-18;
an indication of which is afforded by
the Australia Day of 1918 when £l2O
was raised, Mr. C. J. Jackmann being-
secretary. Others on the general com-
mittee were Messrs. G. and J. Droege-
mueller, R. Kitching, E, Roesler, R.
Denholm, P. R. Evans, E. Lambert, O.
Richter, C. and T. Roesler, G. Boehm;
Mesdames G. Droegemueller, J. Hearl,
O. Richter, G. Bradshaw, J. Mulcahy,
and Misses Knightley, Stewart, Hilda
Garrett and Sophie Roesler. Among
others who helped prominently were
Thelma Johnston, Jessie Doddridge,
May Lambert, Alma and Edie Droege-
mueller and Mr. F. Henke. The Baby
Competition was won by Amy Droege-
mueller; the other candidates being
Murray and Ernest Randall (twins),
Vera Fowler and Nora Kitching.
HALL BUILT ENTIRELY BY
VOLUNTARY LABOUR.
The telephone exchange was open-
ed about 1920, and in 1926 the fine
hall, pictured here, was erected largely
by voluntary labour —a magnificent co-
operative effort. The hall, 41 x 25 ft.
was built in five months by the working
“bees”; about £3OO worth of materials
being used. The site is a li-acre block
bought from Messrs. Heath Bros, in
1923 for recreation purposes; the trust-
ees being Messrs. E. Roesler, S. Brad-
shaw, W. Meakins, J. Droegemueller, T.
Roesler, F. Henke, W. Wegener, T.
Pfeiffer and G. Droegemueller. The
building committee comprised Messrs.
F. Henke, O. Richter, G. Bradshaw, G.
Boehm and G. A. Droegemueller. The
foundation stone was laid by Mrs. P.
R. Evans on August 31, 1926, and the
building was opened by Mr. C. H.
Angas at a fete on November 6 of that
year. This fete marked the close of
a Queen Competition, yielding £156
12/-, and won by Miss Nella Droege-
mueller; the other competitors being
Misses Elsie Henke, Gladys Bradshaw
and Irene Richter. The Hall Commit-
tee then comprised Messrs. G. A. Droe-
gemueller (president), S. Bradshaw
(secretary), J. Betties and E. Nenke
(fete treasurers), F. Henke, O. Rich-
ter and G. Boehm. Mr. Droegemueller
is still president, and now has on his
committee Messrs. G. Boehm (vice-
president), O. Parbs (secretary), T.
Mt. McKenzie School had its genesis
in the Tarrawatta establishment on Col-
lingrove Estate, Mr. J. H. Angas hav-
ing placed Mrs. Maria Thomas (for-
merly of Angaston, where she had a
school on Moculta road) in charge. The
Tarrawatta School was gazetted as a
State School in 1879, Mrs. Thomas then
being the teacher. She was succeeded
in 1895 by Miss Lucy M. Fishe.
NEW STATE SCHOOL
OPENED IN 1906
The settlement at Mt. McKenzie in-
creased, and in 1906 a new State School
was built there in lieu of that at Tar-
rawatta, Mr. Angas having donated a
site. Miss Fishe was succeeded in 1910
by Miss Susan E. Moore, and follow-
ing her have been Miss Edith R. Milne,
1914; Miss Nora Knightley, 1918; Mr.
Victor R. Murphy, 1919; Mr. Wm. S.
Catford, 1923; Miss Francis E. Har-
man, January, 1925; Eric E. Nenke in
September, 1925; Sidney C. Wakeford,
1927; Darcy J. G. Frick, January, 1929;
Howard A. Pfitzner, July, 1929; and
Frank Redstone (present teacher) in
1933.
The progressive community has kept
Its school up-to-date, and has for a
long time held an annual picnic wherein
each succeeding year has reached a
higher standard. It would be difficult
to name and give credit to all who have
assisted in connection with the picnic,
but a special tribute should be paid to
the succeeding teachers who have in-
variably been enthusiasts. The pres-
ent members of Mt. McKenzie School
Committee are Messrs. J. Merrotsy
(chairman), A. Atkinson (secretary),
Ed. Roesler (treasurer), B. Pfeiffer, T.
Tscharke, R. Zeunert and W. Wegener,

MR. O. J. KRIEG’S NURIOOTPA BRICKYARDS
Its imposing chimney stack, that can be seen for such a distance, makes
Nuriootpa Brickyards a landmark. The enterprise was- founded in 1881 by
the late Hermann Gustav Krieg, widely known in the early days as “Uncle
Gus.” Mr. O. J. Krieg, the present proprietor, is a nephew, and assumed
control in 1920, when modern plant was installed in order to cope with the
increasing demand. Included in the installations was a wire cutting machine
for the quicker cutting of the clay, and moulding and pressing plant that per-
mitted production to be in-
creased to one and a half
million bricks per annum.
A long and careful study of
requirements has led to
lection of the best raw ma-
terial in the district, and
with the new boom in build-
ing, Mr. Krieg is being kept
busy. The kilns produce
first class brick, together
with glazed and ornamental
lines, border tiles and other
items for the builder.
Perhaps Mr. Krieg is as
well known for his musical
career and the work he has
over many years put in for
the community. For twenty
years he was secretary of
Nuriootpa Band, and has
just resumed conductorship
—an office he previously fill-
ed for ten years. He has
had charge of St. Petri choir
for 27 years, during which
he was also a teacher in the
Sunday School. He still is
a seal-holder of the Church,
and has been a lay reader
since 1916. He succeeded
his father as a trustee of the
old Park in 1918, and is
vice-president of the new
Centennial Park. For 12
years he was on Immanuel
College Board, and he has
been an enthusiastic member
of the Tanunda Liedertafel
ever since its inception.

Moculta, Gruenberg and Gnadenberg Pioneered in 1850
Moculta originally was the head-
quarters of a large tribe of natives,
and they had an extensive burial
ground a little north east of the pres-
ent township. The settlement had its
genesis about 1850, when portion of
Mr. Abraham Shannon’s estate was
cut into building blocks with suitably
intersecting streets named respectively
David, William, Sarah, Jane and Eliza-
beth Streets, after members of the
Shannon family. The main street, also
that at the southern end of the town,
remain unnamed. Mr. Altmann acquir-
ed the property on the western side of
the town, and when this also was cut
into allotments, an additional street
was laid out and named Altmann
Street.
ta’s first blacksmith, his smithy being
at the corner of main and William
streets. Nearby was Mrs, Jaehne’s
store, later taken over by Mr. E.
Hentschke, who afterwards built a new
store at the southern end of the town.
Messrs. Groch (bootmaker) and Ben
Boehm (saddler) were other Moculta
business establishments about 1888.
Early in the township’s history, Par-
rot Hill Creek, which meandered
through the settlement on its way to
Duck Ponds Creek, was diverted along
Elizabeth Street. Developed contem-
poraneously with Moculta were Parrot
Hill (the actual hill is in Mr. Alb.
Schilling’s property) and Gruenberg
districts, to the south of the town.
Gruenberg was settled from 1850 on-
wards by members of Pastor A. L. C.
Kavel’s Lutheran congregations from
Klemzig and Hahndorf. Among these
early settlers were Joseph Altmann and
family, S. Bartsch and family, G. Flie-
gert and family, S. Krause and family,
S. Klemm and family, S. Jaeschke and
family, the Rothe family, Gottlob Linke
and family, Mr. and Mrs. W. Fischer,
J, T. Fietz, Kroppel, Schirmer and
others.
They were visited at intervals by
Pastor Kavel, who conducted services
in the homes till 1855, when a building
was erected (adjacent to the present
church) to serve as church and school.
The name Gruenberg was given, indi-
cating a green hill. Among settlers
who arrived about this time and later
were several Schilling families from
Light’s Pass and Angaston, among
them Gottfried, Gottlieb, Christian,
Wilhelm, and their father Johann Gott-
fried Schilling (the latter from Angas-
ton) ; Schliebs, E. F. Drescher, Aug.
and Wm. Staude, J. T. Hentschke, G.
Rueger, Wallent, N. Stanitzky, Schulz,
Rohrlach, Lindner, Schwartz, Gogoll,
Pfeiffer, J, G. Neumann, Joseph Neuda
and others.
At Parrot Hill the Gnadenberg Lu-
theran congregation was founded in the
late ’fifties; the present church being
built with thatched roof in 1860. The
property transfer from Aug. Henschke
is dated 1863, initial trustees being
Aug. Henschke, Johann Gottlieb Fied-
ler, Johann Gottfried Schneider, Fried-
rich Fechner and Hermann Rohrlach.
The trust deed is dated 1872, new trust-
ees then being Johann Friedrich Wm.
Schupelius and Carl Weckert. Incor-
poration of the church was effected on
December 18, 1894.
Among other early settlers, many of
them with their families, were Gott-
fried Stieler, J. Samuel Kroschel, Jo-
hann G. Klemm, A. F. W. Bradtke, F.
W. Graske, J. G. C. Schulz, J. F. W.
Kalisch, Heinrich Rohrlach, J, G.
Bartsch, C. A. Marks, J. F. Mattschoss,
J. G. Geister, Gottlob Kroschel, J. H.
H. Drescher, F. W. Linke, J. G. Linke,
P. Gotthard Henschke, C. A. E. Bradt-
ke, J. G, Rosenzweig, Mrs. A. D. Enk-
elmann, Aug. Lindner, Kokegei, Alb.
Budich, Modistach, F. W. Liesfeld,
Kramm, Kubenk, Aug. and Leopold
Schmidt, E, Hoenke, Chas. Jones, Wm.
Blackburn, Binder, Lindner, Ad. Wach-
ner, Jaensch and Guthe,
A number of these settled in Parrot
Hill district, where Mr. Allert opened
a store and conducted the Post Office;
these latter facilities being now centred
at Moculta. Mr. Cowlon was Mocul-
In the early ’eighties also, Mr. Aug.
Linke established a smithy at southern
end of the town, opposite Hentschke’s
store, and it developed into a noted im-
plement factory. Messrs. Heinrich and
Friedrich Linke and J. H. Drescher
were next associated with the venture,
which afterwards changed hands sever-
al times and ultimately was known as
C. & B. Linke’s. Centralisation of sec-
ondary industries and distance from the
railhead were severe handicaps that
required only the depression to close
what had been a great enterprise.
The Altmann family was prominently
associated with pioneering of Moculta
district, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Altmann
being among the first settlers. Mrs.
Altmann (nee Baumann) was born in
1808, lived to over 92 years, and left
149 great-grandchildren. Mrs. August
Altmann (wife of one of the sons who
remained in the district) was famed for
her skill in medicine, her ministrations
being of inestimable value to the com-
munity. One of her sons, Carl, who
went on to study medicine, gained dis-
tinction. The other son, Wilhelm, who
died at Loxton in 1933, took over the
family holding and for a long period
was local mail contractor. He instal-
led one of the first power separators,
and twice a week went to Freeling with
the cream from milk collected on a big
round of the farms spread about.
Moculta State School, 1936


“Mutter” Graske rendered signal ser-
vice in those early days as midwife;
ushering in many babes who later be-
came hefty young men who cleared the
scrub and laid out farms. With the
help of his young sons Reinhold, Fritz,
Hermann and Paul, Mr. J. F. Matt-
schoss cleared stone from the Shannon
Station and built the boundary wall
extending miles. Wheelbarrow,
sledge and bullock waggon with wood-
en rollers in lieu of wheels, were used
in the big job. The church in these
times played a vital part in lives of
pioneers who had left their native land
on account of religious persecution.
The little Gruenberg Church, built in
1855 for worship and as school, was
solely devoted to the latter use when
the present church was erected in 1864.
For the fiftieth jubilee in 1914, an im-
posing tower was added; in this being
hung a fine bell donated by a member
of the congregation.
Pastor Kavel was minister in charge
from 1850 till 1857; then followed Pas-
tors Staudemeier till 1858, C. Auricht
till 1860, J, G. Rechner till 1900, J. J.
Stolz till 1929, P. H. Hass till 1936,
and Rev. B. Reuther, present incum-
bent. Of layreaders who have conduct-
ed worship, Mr. A. Altmann holds the
record of fifty years, 1853-1903. Others
have been E. Hentschke, S. Krause, W.
Fischer, Rothe, S. Wallent, H. Drescher,
C. Schilling, Schwartz, W, Kroschel, W.
Altmann, C. Leschke, B. Linke, J.
Wilksch, and the present officers; G.
R. Schilling since 1898, F. W. G. Linke
since 1899, P. R, Schilling since 1932,
and R. F. Linke since 1936.
Gnadenberg Church, built in 1860,
was incorporated in 1894, when pro-
vision that 18-year men should have full
voting rights was made in the deed. A
beautiful tower was added to the build-
ing in 1904. Pastor Meyer is presumed
to have visited some of the Gnadenberg
Lutherans prior to building of their
church, and succeeding ministers were
Pastors Appelt, Bode and F. A. Hoss-
feldt (1892-1928); then the present
minister, Rev. T. Hebart. Among early
layreaders were Messrs, C. Weckert
and Aug. Kroschel; then followed Gott-
lieb and Gottfried Fechner, H. Pasch-
ke, R, Rosenzweig and present officers,
C, J. Koch, Ted Wilksch, Gus. Hensch-
ke and Ben Rosenzweig. Mr. C. J.
Koch was church secretary from 1897
till 1932, since when Mr. A. Fechner
has served. A Sunday School has also
been conducted since 1930, the teach-
ers since inception being Messrs. Arn-
old Fechner, C. Paschke and Miss A.
Koch. Mr. F. Krieger taught for a
short time, and Miss Nora Henschke
till 1934, when she was succeeded by
Miss Nita Henschke.
Gruenberg and Gnadenberg conduct-
ed an independent day school in the
early stages. Those who taught in
the original Gruenberg Church build-
ing were Messrs. Geyer (1855-60), D.
H. Lemke (1860-62 and 1867-75), Dith-
mer (1862-67), and R. Rieschieck (1875
till 1876) when he went to the Moculta
School, established by Mr. D. H. Lem-
ke in 1875, and later taken over by the
congregation. Mr. Rieschieck taught
here till 1887. When the Gnadenberg
Church was built in 1860, a school was
conducted there until 1868, when a lit-
tle wattle and daub place was built by
Mr. Sommer, schoolboys having to help
by treading straw into the clay.
Those who taught at Gnadenberg
were Messrs. Miethke, Gellert, Aug.
Giersch, Miss Andre (who continued in
charge for a time after she had become
Mrs. Lindner), Messrs. D. H. Lemke,
E. Hoff, E. von der Heide and Zibell.
Soon after Gruenberg had taken over
the school at Moculta, they conferred
with Gnadenberg, and thereafter the
two congregations conducted it as a
joint venture until, with all other Lu-
theran schools, it was closed by the
Government in 1917. The house built
by Mr. Lemke for his school in 1875
is still used as a teacher’s residence,
having been purchased from him with
an allotment of land for £l5O. Messrs.
W. Linke, H. Drescher and Marks were
the school committee in 1878; the first
trustees being Messrs. Aug. Linke, J.
C, Schilling, J. G. Linke, J. G. Rosenz-
weig and J. A. Jaeschke. Mr, A, Linke
was school secretary.
Mr. F. A. Presser, F.V.C.M., present
Chairman, Moculta School Committee
When attendance increased to over
eighty scholars, a move was made for
larger premises, and Messrs. F. Linke
and E. Hentschke circulated subscrip-
tion lists which yielded all but £2OO of
the required amount, in spite of the
adverse seasons that were being experi-
enced. Mr. Aug. Linke presented to
the congregation an allotment he had
purchased from Mrs, Groch for £3O, ad-
joining the teacher’s residence, Mr.
Liebich secured the contract for erect-
ing a new school, and following laying
of the foundation stone by Rev. J. G.
Rechner, the official opening took place
on October 22, 1882. Mr. Basedow did
the carpentering, and residents gave a
lot of voluntary help in connection with
the building.
Messrs. C. A. Schilling and J. H. H.
Drescher were first trustees, whilst the
committee comprised Messrs. W. Linke
and E. Hentschke. Mr. R. Rieschieck,
initial teacher, had as assistant Mr. T.
Schwartz; the former acting until 1887,
then Mr. J. Rechner was appointed
and served till 1891, when Mr. J. A.
Tamke succeeded. Messrs. W. Linke
and G. Pfeiffer were on the school com-
mittee in 1889; Mr. E, Hentschke tak-
ing the latter’s place in 1892. In the
following year Mr. Linke had with him
as trustees Messrs. E. Hentschke and
G. Klemm; Mr. Tamke resigning as the
teacher after! eight years’ service. Mr.
J. F. Jacob was appointed; the school
committee now comprising Messrs. W.
Altmann and G. Klemm, succeeded in
1904 by Messrs. H. E. Hentschke and
C. Linke; Miss Krichauf being appoint-
ed assistant teacher during the year.
Messrs. J. Wilksch and G. Schilling
joined the committee in 1907, when the
buildings were renovated; trustees at
this period being Messrs. F. W. Linke,
C. A, Schilling and G. Klemm, to whom
H. Drescher and H. A. Hentschke were
added in 1907 as signatories of the deed
of incorporation. Miss L. Wilksch be-
came assistant teacher in 1908, her
successor after three years being Miss
Erna Riedel, of Keyneton. In 1910 the
committee was Messrs. G. and F, Schil-
ling, and it was in this year that the
first picnic was held in grounds still
used for the purpose, and lent by Mr.
E. Hentschke, In the following year
seal-holders were Messrs. C. A. Schill

ling and B. Linke. Miss Riedel resign-
ed in 1912, when Miss Fechner was ap-
pointed, then came Miss O. Rattaey,
and Mr. R, Raethel in 1915.
In 1913 Messrs. F, Schilling and W.
Wilksch were committeemen; and in
1916 Mr. Altus became assistant teach-
er. Mr, F. Jacob had completed 19
years as head teacher when the school
was closed during the War, but he was
retained by the congregation until 1921
as religious teacher on Saturdays and
Sundays. He left then to accept the
position of Postmaster at Light’s Pass.
On July 9, 1917, the institution became
a State School, with Mr. Jas. O’Neill
as head teacher and Mr. W. A. Robin-
son assistant. Miss Kelly was assist-
ant in 1918, Mrs. Lee being appointed
three months later. Elected in April,
1918, to the first school committee were
Messrs. F. C. Linke (chairman), G. B.
Linke (sec.), Mr. and Mrs. C, F. Schil-
ling, Mr. C. J, Koch, Mrs. W. Altmann
and Mrs. H. A. Hentschke.
Mr. N. Preece became H.T. in 1919,
with Miss R. Wedding as assistant. In
1920, Mr. L. F. Tabe was committee
chairman; Mr. G. B. Linke secretary,
and Messrs. C. J. Koch, W. Altmann,
C. G. Presser, H. Wilksch and J. G.
Bartsch were other members. Mr. J.
O’Neill returned in 1921, and in 1922
the elected committee embraced Mr. L.
Tabe (chairman), Alf. Schilling (sec.),
Bert. Bartsch, H. Wilksch, G. B. Linke
and Mrs. H. G. Bartsch and Mrs. J.
G. Bartsch, Diminished attendance in
1923 resulted in transfer of Miss Wed-
ding, and Vera Mattschoss became the
monitor for several years. In 1923 the
congregation built a shelter shed on
the property; new names on the com-
mittee being Messrs. H. Steinert and
W. Rudiger, Mr. O’Neill, founder of
Moculta Choral Class, went in 1924, Mr.
F. Jennings coming for a short time,
then Mr. M. Tohl was appointed in
Scholars at Moculta Lutheran School
August. Mr. L. Tabe continued as
chairman until 1929, when Mr, Alf.
Schilling assumed office.
It was during this year that Mr. and
Mrs. Aug. Kroschel’s golden wedding
was honoured. They had spent all
their lives in the district, Mrs. Kros-
chel (nee Hausler) having given valu-
able service as a nurse. In 1929, a
wonderful community effort yielded
£l3O, enabling Mr. Tohl to add wood-
work and domestic arts to the curric-
ulum. Mr, Tabe was president, and
Mr. F. A. Presser secretary for the
wonderful effort. Miss Louise Linke
was winning queen in a competition
that returned over £6O; the other can-

Nuriootpa and AngaSton Anglican Churches, Founded 1904
The Anglican Church, established in
this district early in the present cent-
ury, had its genesis at Nuriootpa,
where, prior to 1904, the Anglican ser-
vices were taken by the Rector of St.
George’s, Gawler, and the Chaplain of
the Bishop’s Home Mission Society. On
October 6, 1904, St, Boniface’s Church
at Nuriootpa, was dedicated by‘Bishop
Harmer, and services thereafter were
taken monthly by the Organising Chap-
lain of the Bishop’s Home Mission
Society, the Rev. E. A. Forbes and
his assistants, Revds. F. R. Morze, C.
E. Dewdney and J. Colville. Later
came Archdeacon W. J. Bussell, the
new Organizing Chaplain, and Revds.
A, McCully and S. S. Moncrieff.
In 1911 the congregation became at-
tached to Angaston Parish, with Rev.
W, B. Docker as Priest-in-Charge. A
valuable service has always been rend-
ered by the lay readers, who in turn
have been Messrs. W. S. Welbourne
1909-10; A. H. Paech, 1910-20; J. B.
Richards, 1911; F. P. Shipster, 1921-
22; J. A. Craig, 1923-34; and A. Mc-
Lay, 1934-36. On November 1 of this
year the foundation stone will be laid
of additions baptistry, porch and
vestry; Archdeacon R. W. Walker per-
forming the ceremony.
Miss Sage was first organist, and
was followed in turn by Mrs. Field,
Mrs. W. E. Deßavin, Miss S. Fellen-
berg, Mr. A. McLay and Miss Ham-
pel; the latter being the present organ-
ist, The choral combinations have in
several instances been outstanding. Mr,
J. Drinkwater had charge of the first
choir; Mrs. W, E. Deßavin later or-
ganized a Boys’ Choir; and Mr. W. R.
Dempster was responsible for the high
standard of a subsequent choir.
Mr. W. H. Milway retired two years
ago after sixteen years admirable ser-
vice as Sunday School Superintendent.
Miss C. Francis filled the vacancy, re-
tiring three months ago, whereupon
Mr. A, R. Milway became superintend-
ent after being for 16 years connected
with the Sunday School. The present
teachers are Mr, B. Kretschmer; Misses
Y. Hampel, L. Kretschmer, M. Theile.
St. Boniface’s Church of England, Nuriootpa
ST. HUGH’S, ANGASTON
Services at Angaston began about
the same time as those at Nuriootpa,
the Masonic Hall being used by Arch-
deacon Bussell till 1910. Rev. W. B.
Docker was the first Priest-in-Charge
in 1911; and on March 22, 1912 the
first St. Hugh’s Church was licensed.
That building, of wood and iron, is now
used as the Parish Hall.
The ministers who fol-
lowed were Rev. R. E.
Freeth, 1914-16; Rev. H.
H. Coles, 1916-18; Rev.
W, H. Sage, 1919-22; Rev.
LI. Lewis, 1922-33; and
Rev. E. O. Auricht (pres-
ent minister) since 1933.
A bequest of £5OO by Mrs.
C. H. Angas started the
movement for a more suit-
able building, and numer-
ous efforts were organized
to raise funds. One of
the most successful of these
was a fete in 1928 which
yielded £9O; a sum Mr. R.
F. Angas subsidised pound
for pound. The founda-
tion stone was laid on Jan-
uary 31, 1931, by the pres-
ent Bishop of Adelaide,
who on April 11 of that
year dedicated the build-
ing. The total cost was
£1135; the architect being
Dean W. Berry.
Mr, W. H. Codrington
has an unique record of
faithful service, having
been lay-reader since com-
mencement of the church
here. Other lay-readers
include Messrs. A, Stock-
man, A. H. Paech, C. F. Beeton and
G, H. Raethel. Mr. J. P. Richardson
was a warden for many years. When
the first services were held, Miss Molly
Ball acted as organist, and was follow-
ed by Miss Ferry and Miss Isabel
Mansfield in 1916. The latter (now
Mrs. C. J, Johnson) still occupies her
place at the organ, and has had the
assistance of Miss Hilda Tucker, Miss
Beryl Betties and Mrs. J. Inglis.
During Rev. Docker’s time a Sunday
School was started in Angaston Ma-
sonic Hall, with Miss Molly Ball and
Miss Barker in charge. Miss V. Nein-
dorf later joined the staff, then Mrs.
J. Inglis and Miss Fewster. Mr. Thos.
Mitchell followed, having Miss Thelma
Mansfield as assistant, whilst Miss Isa-
bel Mansfield was pianist, and continu-
ed after her marriage. Both Mrs, C.
J. Johnson and Miss T. Mansfield have
given many years of valuable service
to the Sunday School. With these two
ladies, Mr. K. Robinson was superin-
tendent for about five years, being suc-
ceeded by Mr. Maurice Mattiske and
later by Miss Thelma Mansfield. Miss
Beryl Betties then became pianist. In
recent years Rev. E. O. Auricht com-
menced a Bible Class; Misses T. Mans-
field and Joyce Leschen took charge of
the kindergarten. Miss V. Neindorf
was pianist for a while, and now Mrs.
Auricht fills the position.
The Anglican Rectory, adjoining St.
Hugh’s Church, was built in 1920.
The pretty ivy-covered chapel that
is now St. Faith’s, Collingrove, was
built in the ’fifties by Mr. J, H. Angas
for private services, and for a long
time the services were conducted by
Angaston Congregational ministers.
