Fellow Colonists,
. new School of, pseudo, Political Economists, whose chief Luminary
is i ened by Mr. Disraeli unto a Wild Man broke loose from a cloister,
has befooled Mr. Bull into the assumption of what is styled a ?New
Attitude against Colonies, by which he is to get from them more, by
giving them less. 11l usage of Colonies stripped Mr. Bull of those
famous ones now blossomed into the Great Republic?this ?New
Attitude ?of his may strip him of those he has left. The Lunatics
who have led him into it affect to think that, in a Nation?s Affairs,
having is the same as Gaining, that National Security is well purchased
y ational Insignificance, and that National Compactness is National
Strength : a ?craze? which might fitly prompt our suggesting to them
that when they have succeded in persuading Mr. Bull to denude him-
selt ot Canada, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and his rum and
sugar Lands, they should seek to crown their work by persuading him
o strip himself of India and England, Scotland and Ireland, Jersey and
Wales, to pare down his army and navy to one regiment and a gunboat,
and to concentrate and consolidate the British Empire in the Isle of Man. V
I his new an d huckstering design of Mr. Bull?s has, naturally called '
torth various Views as to the best way of frustrating it; and, in humble
contubution thereto, I, as an Old Colonist, venture, herein, to submit
mine. ?
?, e tO , Premise them by observing that a famous public organ
ot Mr. Bull s, the potent mouth-piece of his rich and ruling orders, and
one much inspired by Matthew Arnold?s ?British Philistinism,? has
lately entreated that in any approaching discussions between Colonies
and Crown, all trope and metaphor avoided, spade be called spade, and
seems to think that in settling its future Policy each side should confine
itself to looking at that which would be best for itself, and not distract
itself by looking at that which might be good for the other. This may
smack of the spirit in which two pedling Shylocks might meet to trick
each other in a bargain, rather than of the spirit which should animate
Britain s Home Empire and Britain?s Colonial Empire in amicably
adjusting their future relations?but, in deference to a big Journal (the
burly Polyphemus of the Press) and to that ?Materialism of the Till?
it so loudly sings?well aware, too, that the ? sugared False ?is far
more reading, far more profitable writing, than the ?bitter
irue I m the following remarks, will call spade, spade, two and
two plain four, and seek only to show what Young Australasia would
gam by a certain Policy, and not what Old England might lose.
ihis premised, permit me to say that so far as Australasia is concerned,
the View which this ?New Attitude? of Mr. Bull?s compels me to take
is tins that, (with inspiration and encouragement drawn from the
magnificent career of those kindred Colonies which raised the Stars
and Stripes,) Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland,
/l lid, wAi <*/a (a<x-\(.&UiS&e(C jsKtdi'efa wc be >U(? '
/jY? IfaxtyklUeat cl (OrolA<2


Tasmania and New Zealand* would now best advance their political,
social and industrial growth, progress, and prosperity, by amicably
separating from England and federating into an Independent State.
And I will show the soundness and justness of such View by first
laying before you the following series of short synoptical Propositions
exhibiting, at a glance, the fundamental facts and truths on which it
rests, and then by commenting on such few of them as may seem to
need any word of illustrative expansion.
I.?That the contrast exhibited between the United States and
Canada affords indisputable proof that British Colonies, federating into
an Independent State, marvellously outstrip British Colonies supinely
content to remain such?the latter with almost as good a start in life
as the former, now counting only about 4,000,000 People, seldom heard
of in the world?the former, nearly 40,000,000, filling the world with
their fame.
2.?That no Land, supinely content to remain the mere Colony, the
mere Dependency, of another, can ever become nationally great; and
that its People are ever supercilliously looked down on, and politically
and socially ill treated by those of the dominant State, as being an
?inferior? and half alien Race. (Expanded , page B.J
3.?That the Citizens of a British Australasian Republic, like the
kindred Citizens of the American Republic, would command infinitely
higher political and social rank status and consideration in the World
than could, ever, mere subordinate Australasian Colonists.
4.?That, deluded by the fallacies and fictions of her pseudo Econo-
mists and political Quacks, and misled by other moonshine, England is
growing insensible or indifferent to the value of Colonies, and forgetful
of what She owes to them?and that, in regard to their real importance
to Her as compared with that of Old World Countries, she distorts the
'?Small? into the ?Great,? and the ?Great? into the ? Smalla
State Toothace afflicting any little tinpot Crown or Duchy, such as
Greece or Small German, exciting more care and sympathy in Court
Circles and among her ruling orders than do calamities such as those
lately desolating, and, possibly, again to desolate, one of her Great
Australasian Colonies, in New Zealand.
5, ?That the ?heroic spirit of Colonization? and the love of the
Colonies, inspiring Bacon, Raleigh, Statesmen of the Elizabethan Age,
and generations of their successors, the spirit which has done so much
* New Zealand is now, virtually, as nigh Australia, as Scotland and Ireland were
to Westminster in the days of the Union?while further triumphs of the good Genii
of Electricity and Steam may ? put a girdle round about the Earth (Antipodean) in
forty minutes,? and bring Australia?s most distant city within 100 hours? reach of a
Federal Capital.


to raise a little Island of the North Sea into the Mistress of half the
Woild, no longer animates England?s Rulers, and that, in ideas and
aspirations, divers of these are becoming cramped and insular, parochial
rather than imperial, penny wise and pound foolish.
9* That when, last Session, the shameful treatment, the dire distress,
of Young New Zealand was, at last, permitted to be made the subject
of Debate ; and notwithstanding its being a matter affecting the honour
and fair fame of England more than any parliamentary Question of the
present Century, only 10 out of 658 M.P.?s were found sufficiently
interested in it even to utter a word on it!!?foolish Nero fiddled
Rome was burning?a Debate on Oyster Culture, Game Laws, Cock-
fighting, Cab Fares, would have brought scores of Honourable
Members on their legs.
That the insensate policy of England, dictated by the selfish
fears of her Ruler and Employer Classes, which treats her hideous
Wen of Pauperism,? her plethora of Labour, her semi-starvation of
Labourer, with the costly quackery of Poor Laws, instead of with the
cheap, certain, final, cure of ? State Emigration,? bodes ill for the
wisdom of her future Policy in other directions ; and suggests the doubt
whether a State, so blind to the interests of her ?Home? Empire, can,
wisely, be entrusted with any interests of a ? Colonial? Empire.
B*?'That j n flyers great questions of national Policy debated in the
imperial Parliament?such as War, National Defences, Transportation,
State Emigration?the Australasian Colonies may have as great a stake
as England, Scotland, Ireland, or Wales ; and that, while they are
without voice or representation, there, they are without their due and
just political rights. That the amusing but pernicious delusion of the
Colonial Office that it, the Colonial Office, represents Colonies in
the imperial Parliament, is one not shared in by Colonists. That, as
seen by Jamaica and New Zealand, when ?crass clamour? against
Colonists is rampant in the Commons, it either joins therein, or dams'
with faint defence, or dozes. That, the sole merit it boasts, that <Tf
having given British Constitutions to British Colonies, is hollow, inas-
much as had they not been ?given? they must have been ?taken??
and that, generally, the Colonial Office, as an Institution, sympathizing
with, protective of, and practically useful to, Colonies and Colonists,
has no claims to their confidence or respect, but is a monstrous Imperium
in imperio which should be cut down and rooted up.
9.?That the argument that Colonies have no ?right? to representa-
tion in the imperial Parliament, or to the services of Imperial Troops,
because they pay no imperial Taxes, is one far more specious than
real inasmuch as through and by the immense export and import
Trade they create for the Parent State, and in other ways, such as in
helping to relieve her from her costly, pauperizing, ?Pressure of


Population,? they do, virtually, furnish, and supply a large portion of
her ?home-staying? People with part of the ?ways and means? of
paying imperial Taxes ; and do, thus, substantially, pay a quota of
imperial Taxes, just as much as if they carried it, direct, to the imperial
exchequer ?and do, generally, help to create and keep up the wealth,
strength, power, prestige, and renown of the British Empire as much
as does, probably more than does, any ?home? portion of it where the
population is, numerically, the same.
10.?That Mr. Bull?s grumbling allegations that Colonists owe Him
a vast ? Debt of Gratitude ? ?that He has benefited them far more than
they Him, and that they cost Him more than their worth, are allegations
grossly untrue, and, to Colonists, most offensive and unjust. (Expanded ,
page 9.J
11. ?That British Colonies, with no ?Voice? in the British Parlia-
ment, are, necessarily, made subject to having Foreign War brought on
them by that Body, even in utter opposition to their own views, wishes
and interests. That, in such event, the ludicrous, but none the less mons-
trous, alternative left them, is, either, that of submitting to see their
Shores and Cities ravaged by such War, or that of ?taxing? themselves in
aid of fighting it. The former, a course no British Colony could take?
the latter, virtually, despotic Taxation without atom of Representation.
That if the practise were reversed ?if it were Mr. Bull?s ? Colonial ?
and not his ?Home? Empire which declared War for the Nation,
without consulting Him, and, thus, brought hostile Squadrons on His
Coasts, to the serious damage of his next Budget, Mr. Bull would
instantly awake to the gross injustice and absurdity of such ? War
Declaration ? Arrangements.*
? Since this Proposition was framed, the following passage, confirmatory of it, from
the Earl of Derby?s Speech in the Debate in the House of Lords, on ?Colonial
Relations,? Feb. 14, 1870, has met the writer?s eye
? I do not think that in the present state of things or in any state of things like
the present, much difficulty is likely to arise; but we have this to bear in mind, that
we cannot expect a state of peace always to continue. Take, for instance, the case
of Australia. The ties between this country and Australia are undoubtedly strong
enough to all appearance, and I believe strong enough in reality. Rut we know,
nevertheless, that under present circumstances there is no strain whatever upon
them. The strain would arise if we unfortunately became involved in some great
European quarrel, and if, as the consequence of that quarrel, the Australian colonists
found that their commerce was interrupted, that they were suffering heavy losses,
and obliged to put themselves in an attitude of defence , and this on account of some
dispute in Europe about which they neither knew nor cared. This is a state of things
which, if it ever arises, may lead many of the colonists to take a view which they do
not take now as to the greater advantages of a position of independence. That I
look upon as being the danger of the future, the rock ahead as regards the mainten-
ance of the empire. Ido not say that it is a state of things for which I have any
remedy to propose, hut it is at least something to see when a danger is likely to
arise, and not to be taken unprepared, as unfortunately has been very much an
English habit of late in reference to many foreign and colonial questions.?


12.?That though, as yet, more latent than expressed, the very rea-
sonable fear exists that the growing supremacy, in the Councils of
England, of Manchester, and the Economists, (whose Huckster policy
towards England?s magnificent Colonial Empire is to get from it all
which can be got, and to give it nothing in return, the policy which
lost Spain her splendid Colonies and reduced her to comparative insig-
nificance) may eventually dwarf England?s rank, status, power, and
renown in the World to that of a Holland ; when, ? political connexion ?
with her might become the reverse of safe or beneficial for rich and
tempting Colonies.
13.?That the following considerations warrant the belief that the
Australasian Colonies would be more secure from ? foreign aggression?
as an united, independent, Australasian Republic, than as separate,
isolated, undervalued, neglected, Dependencies of a waning Power,
15,000 miles away from them, the other side of the globe.? Ist, that, as
they would enter on their Nationality pure and free from all past
quarrels with Nations, no Nation would be moved to molest them
through old jealousies, or real, or fancied injuries of the Past. ?2nd, that
secure, as they would be, of the cordial sympathy and moral support of
the Great Republic of the West, (and also, it is to be hoped, of that of
such portion of the British Lion as might be left), no Nation in the
world would dare to molest them through wanton lust of territory.?
3rd, that old and new world foreign States and Powers, would rejoice
to see a young Australasian Republic born into the world, and that,
partly, in the selfish hope that its birth might ? weaken ? the great,
dominating, Parent State.?4th, that, in some great European or
American convulsion, the British Crown (represented by that imperial
Parliament wherein Colonies have no voice,) might have to declare War
against some great naval, and military Power, or combination of
Powers?that in such conjucture, the Australasian Colonies, as rich
exposed Dependencies of the Crown, would, assuredly, be attacked, (as
nearly occured even in the Russian War) when again , as now, in New
Zealand, the Crown having been instrumental in bringing War on the
Colony, might, again , as now, in New Zealand, under some specious
paltry plea or pretext, evade its honourable obligations, refuse succour
to the Colony attacked, and leave it to its fate. (Expanded page 11.)
14.?That an Australasian Republic, founded on wise laws, peopled,
mainly, by the English, Irish, Scotch, and German races, with a deep
natural Exchequer in millions of acres of virgin wild Land, and with
vast auriferous, mineral, pastoral, and agricultural resources, could, if
needed for her more rapid development, negociate Loans on London or
New York money markets far more readily and advantageously than
could separate Australasian Dependencies, denied, as they would be, the
? Imperial Guarantee.?


15.?That the religion of Manchester that ?it is ever best to
buy in the cheapest market,? and that Free Trade, as good for the whole
world, ranks second only to Christianity, is not the belief of Colonies
legitimately aspiring to get enough home-grown Bone and Muscle to fit
them for becoming Independent States?and that should a young Aus-
tralasian Republic ever shape the marble for British Worthies, it is
Goldsmith, rather than Cobden, who should represent Political Econo-
mists. That the Fiscal Policy of an Independent Australasian Republic
would not be subject to any injurious ?Veto-Pressure? which the
British Crown, incited by England?s Free Trade Fallacies and by the
growing political supremacy of her Cotton Spinners and Shoddy Kings,
might, some day, seek to put on the Tariff Legislation of subordinate
Colonies ?as, indeed, the Chamber of Commerce of the Bold Men of
Bradford now proposes should be done. (Expanded page 14. )
16.?That with a Population of less than 2,000,000, but with ample
verge and space, fresh fields and pastures new,? for 50,000,000, the
great fundamental vital ?Want? of Australia and New Zealand ?a
Want which, in its progress of supply, would supply most other Wants?
is, of necessity, the WANT OF MORE PEOPLE ?the Want of that
more capital and labour, energy, enterprise, art, and skill ever, by the
? golden stream ? of Emigration, flowing from the Old World to fructify
the New. That, in the last fifty years, while only one million British
Emigrants have settled in British Colonies in America, four millions
have settled in the adjacent United States, and that as German and
Continental Emigration has been wholly to the latter, it may fairly bo
estimated that, in the last half century, for every one emigrant family
settling in America under the British Flag, six have chosen to settle
under the Stars and Stripes. That though the United States superiority
over Canada in easiness of access and other advantages partly accounts
for her superior attractiveness as an Emigration Field, yet that the vast
preponderance of Immigration' into the former, the spectacle of more
than 1,000 Emigrants, a day, for the last year, landing in New York,
alone ; the spectacle of nearly half the Emigrants to Canada moving
away, afterwards, to the States, does most surely show that Europe?s
? new-home seeking hosts? do much prefer settling where they blossom
into Citizens of an Independent Empire, than where they fade into
mere Colonists of a Dependency?and that this pregnant fact, alone ,
should carry great weight in determining Australasia to cease to
be the latter, and to become the former.
17. ?That everything which Australasian Colonists have to sell and
have to buy in the markets of the World they would sell and buy just
as profitably, were they an Independent State, as they do now, in their
mean position of mere Dependencies ?nay, perhaps, even more profita-
bly?and that the foregoing Truths and Facts show that in all which
makes Civilized Communities strong, rich, respected and happy, they
would, in reality, be far better off INDEPENDENT than DE-
PENDENT.


18.?That notwithstanding what is coarsely sneered at as their
? effusive ? loyalty, shown in the welcome of a Prince (so ? princely ?
with his Presents) who would have been an equally attractive spectacle
in the republican United States, the great Australasian Colonies, cannot
for ever, remain mere ? Appendages ? of any State, mere Satellites of
any Sun ?but that, aroused by their democratic, ? colonial-born ? Sons,
who will eventually rule, must, sooner or later, awaken to the fact that
a Country almost as big as Europe, and one of Nature?s richest, may
legitimately aspire to some far higher destiny and career than that of
gold-digging and wool-and-tallow-growing for Mr. Bull.
19.?That, with the same ?Breed of Men? in each, the ludicrous
spectacle of a ? tight little Island ? in the North Sea affecting to rule
and guide an immense Country like Australasia, thousands of leagues
distant and remote the other side of the globe, is a Spectacle not to be
justified or excused by any alleged causes or reasons which Mr. Bull
and his Councillors can construct, and put forth.
20:?That when the British Colonies in America raised the Stars
and Stripes, their position, in regard to real power and resources and
chances of maintaining the high Station they had taken, was inferior to
that of our six Australasian Colonies of to-day. And that, though
Australasia, more distant from those old world stores of ? Wilderness-
subduing ? Capital and Labour which have done so much to create, to
build up, America, and also less favoured in Natural Gifts, could never
aspire to blossom into so mighty an Empire as the great ? Queen of the
West,? yet that Australasia, possessing a territory nearly as large as the
whole of Europe ; possessing even in these, her half-infant, days, a
population soon exceeding 2,000,000 of the British Race; a public
revenue of �10,000,000, with an export and import Trade approaching
�70,000,000 ; a Climate embracing latitudes suitable for every domestic
animal, every grain, grass, root, and fruit of the British Isles, with
others, where flourish vine, olive, orange, mulberry, maize, cotton, and
tobacco plant; a Country possessing stores of gold, iron, copper, coal,
timber, and exhaustless capabilities of supplying Europe with three
great necessaries, wool, meat, tallow ; a Country possessing an immense
ocean coast line, indented with harbours ; holding a position isolated
from all.aggressive ?annexing? Powers, a position remote from all
possible base of hostile operations, and yet nigh to the great marts and
markets of India, China, and Japan, has, assuredly, that within Her
which, with Man?s present improved arms and weapons for subduing
the Waste and ?making the desert blossom like the rose,? might soon
expand her into one of the stongest and most flourishing of Young
Nations which New or Old World has ever seen.*
* With a view to, and pending their Independence, the Six Australasian Colonies
would be wise and politic to cultivate active commercial and social relations with the
powerful Citizens of the United States ?and, as the first step thereto, now that the


Even in this compressed form, the substantial Truth of most of
these Propositions, is, I think, self evident ; and Nos. 2, 10, 13, and
15 are all which can need any word of illustrative expansion.
The first, is that Colonists are supercilliously looked down on, and
politically and socially ill treated, by the People of the Parent State, as
being a sort of ? inferior,? and half alien, Race?and how true this is
of Mr. Bull and His Colonists the following glance will show.
British Colonists composed of British Emigrants and the Descendants
of such, will now soon be 6,000,000 ; and had such great Emigrant
Body lacked the spirit and energy, the pluck and hardihood, to move
off to New Lands, had they, like tens of thousands of their Countrymen,
timidly, fastidiously, clung to natal Shores, the present crowded Popu-
lation of our narrow British Isles must have been several millions more
than it is ; when the Crime and Pauperism, the political, social, and
industrial ills and evils of England might have been double what they
are, and sought a cure even in bloody Revolution. By their mere
Exodus, then, it is clear that Britain?s Emigrant Armies, which have
created her Colonists, have most substantially ?benefited? Britain.
Indeed, adequately, valueing this first great national service of Exodus,
and then glancing at the gigantic extension of Christian Civilization
and of British Commerce which it has produced, we must see that no
Nation, of any era, can ever have been more substantially ? benefited,?
more enriched and strengthened, by the voluntary action of any large
body or portion of its Citizens, than Britain has been by that of her
Emigrant Citizens, now blossomed into her Colonists. In truth, to
these, our present England of anno domini 1870 may owe as much of
her ?greatness? as to any other class or order of her Citizens ?be they
her Agriculturists, Traders, Artizans, Soldiers, Sailors, Lawyers,
Parsons, or Peers.
But how does Mr. Bull ?treat? this Colonial Portion of the Nation
to which he owes so much ? Politically, he suffers it to manage its own
affairs, much as he does his Little Pedlington, or his Stoke cum Pogis ;
but, in the Great Council of the Nation, he gives the 6,000,000 British
Colonists no more place or power, no more voice in the great national
questions there affecting them, no more part in the administration of
that immense national Revenue which they so help to raise, than he
gives Pole or Gaul, Kaffir, Hottentot, or Hindoo ; and contemptuously
tosses over their great national interests to be dealt with by the puny
Secretariat of an abnormal Imperium in imperio, styled the Colonial
Office of Downing Street ?often presided over by some smooth Lord,
shuddering at the coarse Colonist ? coming betwixt the wind and his
Rail has brought New York within a week of San Francisco, to unite in subsidizing
a great direct oceanic ?Steam Highway? from that great Port, by the Polynesian
Islands and New Zealand, to Melbourne and Sydney : ?thus, opening between them-
selves and the greatest ?Wilderness-Subduing? People of the World a smooth
summer-sea path, attractive of American energy and enterprise, galvanizing and
fructifying their torpid wastes, and, generally aiding them in their work of doubling
their power and resources in a few decades.


nobility,? and eyeing him much as gorgeous Butterfly might eye indus-
trial Bee, or meritorious Grub..
Socially, too, Mr. Bull?s demeanour to Colonists is the reverse of
agreeable or just. Remember, it is not the particular Locality, not the
land and water, the hills and dales, of Albion, but the ?Breed of Men?
inhabiting Her, which has made Her one of the World?s most famous
spots. The same Breed of Men inhabits Canada, Australia, New
Zealand ; and the Citizens of Toronto, Ottawa, Melbourne, Sydney,
Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobarton, Auckland, New Plymouth, Wellington,
Nelson, have just as much right and reason to blazon their banners
Cressy, Trafalgar, Waterloo, just as mucl^Teascm r to enrol among
their national Worthies, Shakspear, Bacon, Milton, Locke, Newton,
Raleigh, Drake, Blake, Cook, Flinders, Franklin, Livingston, Faraday,
Stephenson, Watt, as have the Citizens of London or Liverpool, Man-
chester or Birmingham, Bristol or Bath. In birth, blood, lineage, honor,
integrity, courage* intellect, education, charity in its widest sense, suc-
cessful conduct (n* the affairs of Life, our 6,000,000 British Colonists
are, at least, the Peers of any equally large body of Bulls dwelling in
our little North Sea Cradle Isles. Yet, England?s Mr. Bull ever regards
the Colonist as an animal ?inferior? to himself, holds him Small Deer,
holds him a poor ?half-alien? thing, a sort of sham Briton, not staunch
at Beef and Beer, ?while, as if this were not enough, Mr. 8., smitten by
some strange obliquity of vision, some bovine contempt of facts, is now
actually beginning to bellow that Colonists ill use him! ?that they
? bleed ? rather than ? feed ? him, and that a wise Bull would toss
them adrift.
The next Proposition which may receive a little illustration is No. 10.
Its gist is that Mr. Bull, untruly and offensively, asserts that Colonists
owe Him a vast ? Debt of Gratitude,? and that they ?cost? Him more
than their worth. First, let us glance at the ? Gratitude ? account, and
see how it stands in relation to Australia and her Colonists. Mr. Bull
inaugurated his possession of the magnificent Land of Gold and the
Golden Fleece by converting it into a penal Sewer for his ? Convict
Matter.? Attracted by its natural gifts, portions of his surplus masses
gradually emigrated to it. But they did this of and by themselves?
and so far from Mr, Bull at all smoothing their rough path to the New
Land, and their first steps in it, so far from his regarding them as the
most precious and profitable Shipment which ever left his shores, He
long suffered them to scramble to the Wilderness with no more care or
concern for them than had they been a bovine and not a human exodus.
As their numbers increased, He accorded them certain rights of Self-
Government ?but these were as much their own inherent birthrights
as they were his own; and these, accorded by a Parent State to a
Young Wild Land Dependency, are no more than so many additional
means and instruments whereby and wherewith, as much for the good
of the Parent State as for that of the Young Land, the ? Desert is made
to blossom as the rose,? the Wilderness the more quickly subdued, and


made the earlier and larger consumer and producer of Mr. Bull?s
exports and imports. And his accordance of Representative Institu-
tions to Australia no more imposed on her any ? Debt of Gratitude ? to
Him than his feeding his Ox or Ass imposes it on them for the food
He gives them to maintain and increase their strength to do his work.
Certainly, under the Old Regime, Mr. Bull would have sought to
defend Australia against Foreign Aggression or Attack. But
Australia was ever as much His Possession and Property as She was
that of those who happened to be the first to emigrate to and settle
in her?and to claim gratitude from others for protecting our own is
much like claiming the Humane Society?s gold medal for saving
Ourselves.
Then, turn to Mr. Bull?s grumbling allegation that Colonies and
Colonists entail on Him more cost and trouble than they are worth;
and, again , let Australia refute Him. In Trade repayment alone,
Australia, even in the last ten years, even in these her mere Stripling
days, has raised for Mr. Bull raw produce (chiefly gold and wool) and
purchased and consumed His Manufactures and Shipments, to the
aggregate amount of some � 200,000,000. This is a Trade of no less
than � 20,000,000 a year, created by Australian Colonists for Mr. Bull,
the profits of which, including those of the vast shipping tonnage of
Mr. Bull?s which it creates and employs, estimated, say, at �lO per cent,
even, would represent a sum of no less than � 2,000,000 every year
put into Mr. Bull?s capacious pocket by Australia ?and as, exclusive of
what He spent in early days on His own Convicts, His entire annual
expenditure on Australia has probably not averaged �lOO,OOO a year,
here is a pretty bit of picking from Her which one would have thought
might have spared us his grumbling about a bare bone ! This magni-
ficent Trade, too, is now annually increasing at the rate of nearly ten
per cent., or actually doubling itself in a decade.
But, in helping to relieve Mr. Bull of his pauperizing ?Pressure of
Population? and of the many social industrial and political ills and
evils caused Him thereby, in helping to create and maintain for Him
that ?Strength-giving? prestige and renown among Nations which
His magnificent Colonial Empire notoriously does, Australia has
enriched Him with far more than this annual regal tribute of Trade;
and could Her entire Dr. and Cr. account with Mr. Bull be stated and
displayed in figures of �. s. d., we should probably find that for every
shilling She has cost Him She has paid him a pound, back.*
Of course, with Colonies studding every Sea, Mr. Bull will now and
then have some of them ailing, and needing the aid of his arm or credit
or purse?as now in New Zealand, and formerly in Canada and the
Cape. But this is the exception, not the rule?while, in some cases,
notoriouly, in New Zealand, Mr. Bull?s own wild treatment of the
ailing produced or intensified the ailment.
* Mr. Bull?s blind Guides tell Him that so long as His Emigrant Masses get
shovelled out somewhere it is, to Him, no matter where. But even in the Manchester,


In short, were the scales to fall from His eyes, Mr. Bull would surely
see that no Empire, of ancient or modern days, has over drawn such
strength and treasure from COLONIES as He from His ; and may
lest assured that in the days when a famous Traveller shall stand on
broken arch of London Bridge to sketch the ruins of St. Paul?s, and
when some Gibbon shall be relating the ? Decline and Fall of Britain,?
it will be held by the World that among the many great and glorious
achievements of the British ?Breed of Men ? the Creation of Britain?s
Colonial Empire, despite the existence of such an Institution as
Mr. Bull s Colonial Office, was that which best displayed the Strength
and Vigour of the goodly Race.
Proposition 13, is that, with an AMERICAN ALLIANCE, our Six
Australasian Colonies, federating into an Independent State, would be
more secure from Foreign Aggression than, now, they are, in their
mean position of separate, isolate, undervalued, neglected, Dependencies
of a remote and waning Crown ; and a word or two in expansion and
illustration of it may place such grave fact in still clearer light.
Though the World is now at Peace, yet its events of the last quarter
of a century show us that the duration of the World?s Peace cannot be
relied on ; and that even in such short historic period there have
occured among Nation?s events quite as odd, unexpected, unforseen, as
that England may, some day, find herself forced into War with some
Great Power, or combination of Powers. Now, it is clear that, in such
conj uncture, England?s defenceless, gold-renowned, Australasian Colonies
would be points of easy and early attack, as they were designed to be
even in the Russian War ; and the grave practical Question which
it behoves them, seriously, to ask is whether, in such case, England
both could and would , effectually, aid in their protection and defence?
and, further, assuming She both could and would, whether her pseudo
Economists and ? Till Deists ? would not do it with so much of growl
and grumble, moan and groan, as to render her aid more painful to
accept than it would be worth.
. First, let us glance at England?s power to render an ?attacked?
Australasia any really effective Aid. Tis obvious that it would only be
her Naval Arm which could help. Any Nation, or unholy combina-
tion of Nations, which made War on her must needs be, and would be,
strong ?strong both in Troops and Ships?and what with India and
Ireland to keep down, and her own arsenals and cities to protect, She
might have no Soldier to spare for mere Colonies. Her Navy is, un-
doubtedly, strong?but, relatively to the Navies of other Powers, not
probably, half so strong as in Nelson Days?while, as seen in the
or ?Till,? aspect of the question such Guides, as usual, lead Him wrong?for where
his Emigrants, settling in the United States, are annual Buyers of His exports to the
amount of eleven shillings per head, His Emigrants, settling in Australia, are annual
Buyers of His exports to the amount of nearly eight pounds, per head.


Crimea, and in many a bloody battle wherefrom Mr. Bull?s Bull-Dog
pluck has brought him victor, his constitutional contempt of danger,
his innate natural slowness in preparing for action, in stripping for
fight, might allow hostile flying Squadrons, in two or three divisions, to
sack Australasia?s every sea-board City, and sweep her coasts of half
her mercantile marine, ere his Admiralty had got even an additional
gunboat into her Seas.
Nevertheless, we know it is not so much the question of whether
England could, as, whether She would, effectively aid her Australasian
Colonies in War which She had brought on them. To us, to millions
of our Countrymen, it is nationally humiliating that such a Question
should have to be asked. But, we cannot close our eyes to the fact
that the shameful ? CASE OF NEW ZEALAND,? together with the
growing prevalence in her councils of those new ideas and aspirations
which divers of her Press and Legislature declare shall, hencefoi th,
inspire and guide her future Policy in the World, do, most justly, raise
such Question.
Glance at this ? New Zealand Case.? ?Tis notorious that from the
first hoisting of the British Flag in New Zealand, down to a date em-
bracing a period approaching a quarter of a century, Mr. Bull?s Downing
Street Colonial Office, to which He has madly entrusted the Home
Management of his Colonial Empire, kept the Native Race so jealously,
so exclusively, in its own imbecile hands that, in this long training
period, the Colonists had no more share or part in the fatuous 1 olicy it
pursued towards the Savage than had the People of Middlesex or Kent.
?Tis notorious that, in this long period, the Colonial Office so grossly
mismanaged the Savage as to pamper and inflate him into that turbulent
Rebel he has become ; and it is equally notorious that the Colonial
Office having raised this Native Devil, and sick and weary of him,
contrived to get the Young Colony to take him off its hands. It asserts
that this was done at the desire of the Colonists but it is notorious
that had the North Island Colonists, those who suffer from the firebrand
and tomahawk, been suffered to detect that it was the design of Downing
Street to foist the Savage on them, and, then, wholly to desert them in
disasters the Savage might bring on, they, would, to a man, have indig-
nantly denounced the selfish scheme, and told the Colonial Office, in no
silken tones, that it was never the mad wish, any more than it was the
just duty, of a body of British Emigrants, pioneer Settlers in a Wild
Country which the British Crown had chosen to create a British Colony,
to take on themselves, in addition to their own hard but legitimate task
of subduing the Wilderness, the far harder task of subduing a race of
well-armed warlike, turbulent, Savages - especially, when and after the
inborn ferocity and audacity of such Savages had been inflamed, tenfold,
by the Crown?s Colonial Office having suffered them to come braggart
out of conflicts with the Queen?s troops, and, for twenty years, to spit
on all British Law.


But even if the Colonial Office had never meddled with the Maori,
and it had been the duty of the Pioneer Settlers to subdue and civilize
him, and if, after sustaining the massacre of their women and children,
with hideous atrocities from a Wild Beast Foe, if, after sustaining the
ruin of hard won properties and prospects, if, after crippling themselves
with a more crushing Public Debt than so small a body of People had
ever done before, they found themselves too weak to achieve such Task,
surely any generous enlightened Parent State would eagerly have
helped such overmatched Children, in disaster, and not, as Mr. Bull has
suffered his Colonial Office to do, have stripped them of the last Soldier
left them when it was known that such a step might desolate their every
frontier Settlement and shock Europe with scenes rivalling a hideous
Cawnpore.
Yet when, despite that ?suppressio veri, that suggestio falsi? haze
and mist wherein the real Truths of the New Zealand Case are sought to
be concealed from the World by Press Fictionists and crass Red Tape,
Scribes, it is seen that Mr. Bull has deserted a Young Colony in
desolating War brought on her, partly, by him ; and when the belief is
expressed that having, thus, deserted one Colony, he might, thus, desert
any other , hardy apologists start up and entreat us to remember that
New Zealand is merely an instance of Mr. Bull?s deserting a Young
Colony in a barbarian , internal , War which he helped to bring on,
and that he would never do the like in any civilized, foreign, War
which he helped to bring on a Colony. But if the expressive word
may be printed, this, obviously, is ?Bosh??inasmuch as the mere
character or complexion of any war which Mr. Bull might help to
bring on a Colony, and in which he might afterwards desert such
Colony, could <n� more lessen or excuse his disgraceful culpability
therein than the character or complexion of a man?s face or coat could
lessen his right to justice in an English Court.
We must see that when England is in any way instrumental in bring-
ing War on a Colony it cannot, as regards Her responsibility therein,
be of a feather?s weight in what way. And the sole plea under which
Mr. Bull could urge that it would be ?wrong? in him to desert a
Young Colony in any Foreign War which he had been instrumental in
bringing on, but ?right? in him to desert a Young Colony in any
internecine Domestic War which he had been instrumental in bringing
on it, would be the plea that such Domestic War was not of gravity
sufficient to demand his Aid, but was more one of the Street Riot
character, suppressible by the Colony?s Constables. But Mr. Bull well
knows that such Plea will not do for him in New Zealand?well knows
that in various campaigns 10,000 of his own Redcoats, backed by 5,000
Colonials were baffled if not defeated by the Savage*?and well knows
that the true cause and reason of his deserting Young New Zealand
has not been that put forth for him, not the humbug about its not being
his ? duty? to see her well out of the disasters his Colonial Office had so
helped to bring on, but his coming very clearly to see that, in New
* See Appendix A, page 20.


Zealand?s Maori, lie had ? caught a Tartar,? whom to subdue and civilize
would cost him more than his crazed Economists told him he could
afford.
There is, too, something odiously specious and un-English in one of
the reasons put forth, by certain of Mr, Bull?s councillors, for deserting,
in distress, a Young Colony like New Zealand, and for denuding
Colonies, generally, of Troops. Whether it be in the withdrawal of his
Redcoats from Canada, to save them from being bagged by Brother
Jonathan ; whether it be in the stripping of poor little Natal and the
South African Settlements, surrounded as they are by tens of thousands
of Savages, of the handful of Troops hitherto left them ; whether it be
in the recalling of the last Soldier from Young New Zealand, they tell
us Mr. Bull does such things, partly, because the doing of them may
bring out the pluck and develop the muscle of his Colonial Offspring?
and, doubtless, Children of all sorts are judiciously treated when, in
moderation, they are made to help themselves. But conscience must
tell Mr. Bull that his doing this in the case of his New Zealand Bantling
is much akin to the Strong Man involving some Stripling in a deadly
conflict, and then deserting him, therein, on the plea that, alone and
unaided, he might fight his way out of it and come, all the stronger, from
it?a plea which Mr. Bull, the Cotton Spinner of anno domini 1870,
may deem good, but which in Bull of Trafalgar and Waterloo Bays,
would have answered with a ?kick.?
The ? Case of New Zealand,? too, becomes far more pregnant as a
?warning? of what other of Mr. Bull?s Colonies might expect, when
we see that one of his most powerful Ministers since the days of Pitt,
Ml not, now he is in Office, carry out the just views he
expressed in favour of aiding New Zealand. Ahbm Mr.
doggedly determined to desert the Young Colony, that he might evgru ,
unship any Premier who dared to thwart him therein, and, p^ 1 1 cl J&& f
Gladstone pockets his words and insures his place*
In short, no plainer case than this of New Zealand of the desertion of
a Young Colony in War and Disaster brought on partly by Mr. Bull?
no plainer case of that which Lord Bacon denounces as the national
Sin of ? destituting a Plantation,? cfm well occur again ; and the doubt
and suspicion it most warrantably arouses is this?that what Mr. Bull?s
new Lights and Guides have blinded him into doing in New Zealand,
they may blind Him into doing elsewhere.];
These various considerations, then, together with the certainty that
whenever the Australian Colonies chose to federate into an Independent
Republic they might secure the Alliance of the most powerful Nation
in the World, the kindred and sympathetic People of the ? Stars and
Stripes,? must, I think, prove Proposition 13 to be substantially true.
The gist of Proposition 15, the last which can need any word of
expansion, is that Young Colonies, aspiring to gain strength for rising
into an Independant State, are wise and politic in putting some
? See Appendix B, page 23. f See Appendix C, page 23,


? protective ? Duty on Imports. Whatever may be the boasted merits
of Free Trade for an Old, full-blown, Country, such as England?and
the reaction now setting in against it, together with the piteous spectacle
of England?s legions of Paupers and hordes of the half starved, would
show them to be very small?the following recent remarks by an
Australasian Statesman, as Mr. Mill, himself, would, I think, admit, are
indisputably true. ?I do think, when we observe their progress, we
find that, instinctively, Young Communities seek for protection and
shelter under protective Duties, although they may, in some instances,
carry this to an extreme; while, on the other hand, overgrown and
over populated Countries tell the World, ex cathedra, and prove it to
their own satisfaction, that Protection is an abomination, and contrary to
the laws of Political Economy. We know, as a practical fact, that all
New Countries seek for some Protection, some stimulus to native industry,
and this, I believe, it is right to afford them. As in physical life that
degree of Protection which become necessary for the preservation of
the Young life becomes the cause of weakness in the grown up Man,
so, conversely, the winds and storms which only strengthen the muscle
and nerve of the strong and healthy adult, actually destroy infant life.
And I believe that, to a certain extent, sympathy nourishment, protection
and nurture are requisite in the infancy of Manufactures , just as they
are in physical life.?
To this, I would add the following passage from a little publication
of my own, appearing some while since, touching on the obstacles in
the way of the Incorporation of Britain?s Colonial into her Home
Empire.?? For good or for ill, England is now wedded to Free Trade,
while Colonies hold out for some Fiscal Protection. Whether as
separate Dependencies, or as incorporated portions of the Empire, they
must have a Revenue. This, mainly, they derive from their natural Wild
Land Exchequer, and from Customs Duties on Imports, consisting
chiefly of British Manufactures. No public revenue of a Young
Country like a British Colony where, comparatively, there are no rich
and no poor, can be raised with so much certainty, simplicity, economy,
and equality of pressure, as one raised by Import Duties ; while the
dictum of Political Economists, that it is ?ever best to buy in the
cheapest markets,? is one to which Colonies, ambitious of growing into
independent States, do not assent. If the Australasian or Canadian
Colonist buy coat or kettle made in Australasia or Canada, he might
pay 10 per cent, more for it than, were there no Import Duty on it, he
?would pay for the like article made in England ; and thus, on such and
on all similar transactions, would lose certain shillings or pence. But
Australasian and Canadian Colonists have other and higher aspirations
then those beginning and ending in the ? Till.? They aspire to build
up and develope the magnificent Young Lands in which they have made
their Homes, planted their children, cast their lot?the power, prosperity
and well-doing of such Young Lands is that of each unit of their
population ; and their power, prosperity, and well-doing is not to be


promoted by Fiscal Laws, keeping all men in them mere Caliban
? Hewers of wood and drawers of water,? mere rude, rugged, Raisers
of raw produce for the mills and maws of Manchester, Bradford and
Leeds, helpless dependants on the Old World for every article needed
by man beyond bare food and shelter, but by laws encouraging their
? Self-Dependence,? by laws leavening their masses of wool and gold
Producers, their Farmers, Graziers, Traders, and Labourers, with the
Manufacturer, the Artist, the Engineer, and the Artizan. To surround
Colonies with Fiscal Walls banishing all Imports by avid, prohibitory,
Duties would be suicidal. But there is a happy mean even in Tariffs.
Many a shrewd Colonist would hold Goldsmith to have been a sounder
political Economist than Cobden?and fair Import Taxes on Old World
products are so variedly beneficial, nay so necessary, to Colonies, that it
is questionable whether any benefits to be derived from proffered
?Incorporation? into the Home Empire would induce Colonists to
forego them?while, in any pact or bargain of Incorporation, Manches-
ter and Birmingham would probably demand that their products should
enter the ports of Canada, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand,
as ? duty free,? as they do the ports of England, Ireland, Scotland, and
Wales.?
Finally, on this Proposition, it may be said that as, under England?s
modern policy towards Colonies, their Products are no more favoured
at Her Custom House than are Foreign Products, there can, at least,
be no reason founded on ? Reciprocity ? why Her Products should be
more favoured at the Colony?s Custom House than are those of the
Foreigner.
These are the ? Views ? which twenty years personal experience of
Colonies, and long observation of Mr. Bull?s treatment of them, have
led me, reluctantly, to form. To many excellent People, including
Mr. Bull, they may seem visionary, nay even pernicious but so, at
first, did those which brought him Catholic Emancipation, Steam s
Triumphs, Free Trade, Parliamentary Reform. They may, too, be
derided and denounced by those who, accepting as ? practicable ? the
idea of creating Australia and New Zealand as much integral parts of
Britain as England and Wales, and rejecting as ?impracticable? the
idea of Australasian Independence, remind us of those who strain at
gnat and swallow camel. But for these, and the like, we may comfort
ourselves with the fact that many of the ideas of Men which, on their
first promulagation, have been the best abused, as quixotic and
chimerical, have, in the end, come to be those which Men have the most
profitably used?while as to those foolish Prophets of Evil who ever
denounce the fresh and the new, and who might be somewhat
? staggered ? by a serious proposal for the construction of an Inde-
pendent Australasian Republic, we may remember that had the
growth progress and development of the World been suffered to be
stopped by its ?fears and fancies?, even our polished England of


anno domini 1870 might still have been the howling Wilderness of
W oad-stained Savages, worshipping the Misletoe and offering human
Sacrifice to Druidical Gods.
Again, among deriders of any project of Australasian Federation
and Independence, there are those who magnify microscopic differences
and jealousies which they affect to spy among the Young Countries
which would form it into huge obstacles which must ever prevent it.
But the World has ever been afflicted with critics and censors who
make the mountain of the mole hill; and we see that any little ? Tiffs ?
which may have occured among the Youthful Members of a projected
Australasian Empire have been but as Summer Clouds, soon blown
away, and which, under the perfect identity of interests and aspirations,
produced and perpetuated by FEDERATION, could never form again.
Of course, the practical formation and establishment of an Austral-
asian Republic by the harmonious federation of the Six Australasian
Colonies would present difficulties. But none greater than those which
Anglo-Saxon energy and sense have triumphed over in the Union of
England Scotland and Ireland, in the Union of those British Colonies
now the Dominion of Canada, and in the Federation of those earlier
ones blossomed into the Great Republic of the West.
Long enduring New Zealand, should She emerge triumphant out of
her present plight?hard stricken, but steeled, in many a storm and
fight?with her pedling Provincial Immigration Regulations swept
away, with solid attractions offered to Europe?s Emigrant Armies, with
America her friend, Australia her ally, might soon deem herself strong
enough to pursue her further fortunes, separate and alone; while
auriferous Victoria, joined with the twin Sister on her East, might elect
to do the same. But though the Six Australasian Colonies, with the
kinship and friendship of America, might, in groups, or even singly,
be strong enough to run alone, yet, when their day of Independence
comes, as come it must, each, wisely stooping to profit by the pregnant
wisdom of the fabled Bundle of Sticks, would find its best Policy in
forgetting little jars and jealousies and trivial diversities of seeming
interests, and in heartily, magnanimously, uniting for the creation of a
Young Nation, destined, may be, to fill goodly place in the World
as the ? Great Republic of the South.?
? Men, my brothers?men, the workers, ever reaping something new,
that which they have done, but earnest of the things which they shall do.'
Tennyson.
In conclusion, permit me to remark that among the various Views
which this ? New Attitude ? of Mr. Bull?s against Colonies has called
forth, there are some the very opposite of mine, and which, instead of
severing our present political connexion with Him, would draw it closer.
One of such has lately been contributed, by a distinguished Historian,
to the ancient pages of Frazer. Of course, from such a pen, it is a
production of merit?but it reveals the hand of one who, long buried


in the Tomb of History, would seem, like Rip Van Winkle, to have
reappeared among Men, unconscious of the grown stature of Colonies,
and of the flight of Time. Mr. Froude?s idea of welding Mr. Bull?s
Colonial into his Home Empire has occurred to many. Indeed, some
years ago, after observing, in America, how the Great Republic made
each accretion of Territory, each Missouri, California, and Texas, not
a mere subordinate Dependency, a mere Colony, after the fashion of
Mr. Bull, but politically and socially, bone of its bone, flesh of its
flesh, I was, myself, so seduced by the idea of seeing Mr. Bull, do the
like by his Canada, his Cape, his Australia, his New Zealand?so
seduced by the idea of seeing him construct, out of his Home and
Colonial Dominions, a magnificent English-speaking Empire, a true
? Great? Britain, ruling or swaying half the World from Westminster,
and the shelter of all the oppressed and down-trodden Children of
Men, as to publish some remarks thereon.* But fuller consideration
of the obstacles in the way of such a creation, together with the belief
that those ? pernicious principles,? (spawn of Manchester and the
Huckster?s Shop,) which have already so stained the Nation in New
Zealand, may, in the end, bring on the Nation such disaster and dis-
grace as to break it up, have compelled me, reluctantly, to abandon
such idea as chimerical, and to cherish the far more practical aspi-
ration of seeing Mr. Bull?s Downing Street Colonial Office further
inspired by that ? Wild Man ? of Mr. Disraeli?s, to whom flattering
allusion is made at page 1, blunder on, in a Policy which may help a
Young AUSTRALASIAN REPUBLIC to arise.f
Looking, then, at England?s injurious, ungrateful, treatment of
Colonies and Colonists?remembering that Colonists ever have been,
and ever must be, ? looked down on ? by the People of the dominant
State ?remembering the degradation of seeking to keep up a connexion
with those who call us a burden?giving due weight to the New
Zealand spectacle of England?s infamous desertion of a Young Colony
in disasters which her crass Colonial Office Servants so helped to
bring on, giving due weight to the warning lesson such spectacle must
teach?seeing that no tie which political ingenuity could construct
could, for ever, keep together, as parts of one Empire, two Countries
so different and so distant as Australasia and England?looking at the

t No ? form ? which Australian Independence could take could equal that of a
good plain solid EEPUBLIC?but those who love Courts and Coronets, those who
would tincture the ? Political ? with the ? Alsthetical,? and place the ? Practical
after the ? Picturesque,? might prefer seeing our magnificent Australasian Colonies
erected into two or more Independent, but friendly, neighbour, Kingdoms, fitted
with British Constitutions and the three Estates, and with British Princes, wearers
of the Crown?though if the Princeling lately disporting in Australasian Seas be
that ? Toy? Sailor, exhibited to the World, some while since, in the London Times.
He could scarcely prove the ? Eight Prince in the Eight Place ? on any Australasian
Throne.?


indisputable ripeness of the Six Australasian Colonies for simultaneous
Separation and Federation, at the brilliant career before them which
nothing save blind timidity can fail to see?weighing all the con-
siderations named in this letter, with many others which might be
adduced, it would surely now be better for Australasian Colonists, wisely
ambitious as to the ? future ? of their magnificent Country, to take
heart of grace, and combine their forces for the creation and fair launch
of some Young Republic or Federal State, than suppliantly to seek
for some fresh or altered ? Connexion ? with Downing Street which, if
granted at all, would be granted grudgingly, and which might collapse
at the first great strain.
I also venture to think that a judicious preliminary step in such
direction would be for Australasian Colonists disposed to favour, at
least, the temperate and constitutional ? discussion ? of Australasian
Independence, to form some Association for the promotion thereof?
when, afterwards, those who might be satisfied that the ? balance of
advantages ? was in favour of Separation and Independence, might
form some sort of League (say with an Office in central Melbourne),
for the legitimate prosecution of the views they have arrived at. And
any Readers of this poor Letter, thinking, with the Writer, that the
day is come when the great Question of ?AUSTRALASIAN INDE-
PENDENCE ? might, at least, be advantageously ?discussed? are
respectfully invited to communicate with him, at 6, Charing Cross,
London.
The thickness of Mr. Bull?s native, cutaneous, armour, with the
ready plasters of His Times and ? coddling ? Press, will prevent the
light ? darts ? thrown at Him from this poor Paper, by one of His
humblest, though not least filial, Sons, from doing the fine Old Boy
any real harm-fwhilershoulH theylail in advancing the great dbjectY
which impels them, and, yet, tickle Him into turning a more paternal I
face to his lusty Colonial Sons, they may prove, not altogether, to \
have been thrown in vain.

Young Lands of which you are the creative Pioneers,
I am, Fellow Colonists,
Yours truly,

APPENDIX A?referred to page 13.
The Prowess of the Maori, and the relative ?fighting strength ? of the
Colonist and the Rebels.
The substantial truth of the statement, at page 13, as to Maori Prowess,
is amply confirmed by the lucid History of the War in New Zealand, by
the Hon. AV. Fox (the Colony?s present Premier) wherein, at page 40,
we see General Cameron, with a well equipped army of 16,000 men,
hard set to prevent the, single, AVaikato Tribe from effecting an invasive
movement which might have resulted even in the sack of the City of
Auckland, itself and where, in the ? Gate Pah ? affair, we see a few
score Savages utterly routing a picked British Force of Soldiers, Sailors,
and Artillery of near 2000 men, killing and wounding almost 100, and
then making off into the Bush, with loss of only 10 ! Yet, this is the
Foe whom certain gasgonading Penmen of the London Press would
scatter with Pea Bladder and Broomstick I!
I would, here, too just offer a word respecting an important New Zea-
land Question on which the persistent misrepresentations of a portion of
the London Press are notoriously injurious to the Young Colony. The
gist and spiritof them is this? that the New Zealand Colonists are numerically
and artificially, so much stronger than the Natives, that it is a shame and
disgrace to them that they dont instantly stamp out Maori Rebellion and
Revolt, without whining for Imperial Aid, therein.
Now, here, Press Fictionists, studiously ignore or suppress the patent
fact that New Zealand AVars are not so much AVars between the whole
Colony and the Native Race, as between a portion of the Colony (the
smaller, North Island) and the Native Race. In the great South Island,
Natives, relatively to Settlers, are no more than Gypsies in Kent; and the
South Island (inspired by the example of England) has, in effect, de-
clared that Native AVars, are no concern of hers; and armed, as She is,
with a majority in New Zealand?s Parliament, She has, for years, so
crippled the Young Colony?s ? Defense Budgets ? as to have prevented
the creation of any organized, permanent, armed force adequate for the
chastisement and repression of Chronic Maori Revolt. Notoriously,
such South Island Policy caused the collapse of the AVeld ? Self Reliance ?
Project, tied the hands, and, at last, upset the Stafford Ministry, and may
do the same by the Fox, and every successive Ministry which has to face
the task of winning for Young New Zealand a solid, permanent, Peace.
Illustrating the lesser by the greater, the injurious way in which this
difference of position between New Zealand?s North and South Island,


in respect to Native Wars and Troubles^ may be shown by supposing that
Irish M, P?s. were a majority in the House?that a great European con-
vulsion had come?that Napoleon the Third,' like Napoleon the First,
menaced England with Invasion?that Mr. Gladstone asked for an
additional � 5,000,000 to place England in security, and that the Irish
majority would vote but one.
Indeed, this obstructive ? South Island Difficulty,? as affecting the
the Young Colony?s chance of winning, for herself, a solid, permanent,
Peace, is as the millstone round the neck, and makes her the ? House
divided against itself.? Of course, a Political Constitution which creates
such monstrous obstruction should be repealed; and some agitation has
arisen therein. But, so far, two causes have acted in preventing its
Repeal?one, that it would split the Colony into two, and, thus, destroy,
what some are pleased to style, its ?Unity??the other, that the
Downing Street Colonial Office would oppose it tooth and nail, inasmuch
as even this blind Institution can clearly see that were the North Island
left naked and alone, in Her desolating Native Troubles, the spectacle
would become so glaringly disgraceful as to make it impossible longer
to bamboozle Mr. Bull into the belief that it was not His righteous duty
to ? aid ? the Settlement, in the Wars and Disasters He had supinely
allowed this fatuous Institution of His so to help to bring on.
Substantially, then, it is not New Zealand, but Her North Island, on
which the Herculean Task of subduing and civilizing the best armed,
most warlike and wily, Savage Race which Civilization has ever
encountered, has been forced by Mr. Bull. Now, the entire male White
Population of the North Island is under 60,000 ?three-fourths of it,
Labourers, Artizans, Small Farmers and Traders, whose daily labour is
necessary for the subsistence of their Families and themselves; and who
are no more fit for ? Bush Fighting ? than Spitalfield?s Weavers or Dor-
setshire Peasants ?no more able, man for man, to cope with the agile
Maori, than feeble Coney with stealthy Stoat. The entire Native
Population of the North Island, as shown even by the Official Colonial
List of 1869 is about 60,000; and, owing to its remarkable paucity of
women and children, would probably furnish almost double the number
of ? Fighting Men ? which an equal body of Colonists would do. Of
course, no one, as yet, dreams of ever seeing the whole Power of the
Savage arrayed against the Settler. It is a cruel, degrading, unchristian,
practise to hire one Barbarian to destroy another (as Mr. Bull?s fervent
Exeter Hall and Aborigenes? Protection Society orations prove Him, well,
to know,) ?but He has driven the Colonists to employ such weapon, and,
when need comes, they must employ it again and again. Thus, deduct-
ing from those who might become Bebels, those who might be hired as
Allies, it would seem unlikely that a balance of, say, more than one third,
or one fourth, of the Native Race would ever be in the Field against the
Settlers, at any one time. But what ? cold comfort ? is this ! A far
smaller body, namely, the Tribes which have already been in Revolt
and which, when sick of the insipidity of Peace, or inflamed by Fresh


Prophets to run Fresh ? Mucks ? against the Pakcha, may ho in Revolt
again, with their strength and audacity increased four-fold by the fast-
nesses of that rugged Wilderness, whence they sally and whither they
retreat, would, assuredly, constitute an Enemy harder to ? get at,? break
up, and root out, than, in any civilized, open, Country, would 30,000 or
40,000 of the best Troops of France or Prussia.
In the face of such facts as these ?in the face of the fact that ? Immi-
gration ? into the North Island (that beneficent Panacea for most of a
Young Land?s Ills) has, for years, been anihilated by the wars massacres
and hideous atrocities of Exeter Hall?s ? Noble Savage ? ?in the face of
the fact that, in its efforts to win Peace, the Young Colony has been
forced to contract a more crushing Public Debt than so small a commu-
nity ever contracted before ?in the face of the fact that it would have
been cheaper and better for New Zealand to have paid some good Genii
� 20,000,000, down, to have been spared Native Wars than to have lost
what She has lost by them?in the face of the strong probability, founded
on long experience of the Maori?s Nature, that his recent Peace overtures
have sprung from his perfect knowledge that great efforts were making
to bring more Soldiers against him, and that, should such efforts fail, he
may quickly take the War Path, again?in the face of all this, the
balderdash published by a portion of the London Press about the
happy End of New Zealand?s War, Her resuscitating Diggings, Her
rich Exchequer of Wild Flax, Her sunny Prosperity, the wisdom and
virtues of Lord Granville and his Colonial Office, &c., &c., might, fitly
prompt our coupling its concoctors with those whom the Gods, dooming
to Destruction, first, make Mad. There is, however, some ? method in
their madness.? If A (free from the fetters of the fear of God,) after
helping to bring Disasters on B, which he knows he ought to help him
out of, evade doing so, he casts about for plausible Pleas whereunder to
mask from the World his laches, therein: alledges he did not help to bring
the Disasters on B, alledges that B might easily free himself from them,
alone and unaided; and that, despite them, Bis prosperous and flourishing.
Arid it would seem to be in the aim and spirit of such unholy tactics that
many of the New Zealand articles of a portion of the London Press
(inspired, may be, by some peccant A behind the scenes) are so tainted
with the sin of the ? Suppressio Yeri,? the ? Suggestio Falsi.?
New Zealand has now been desolated by chronic, intermittent ? Native
Wars and Troubles ? for nearly five and twenty years. In this period,
that ? Polyphemus of the Press,? alluded to at page 1, and other London
Journals, have announced PEACE for her nearly as many times; and,
ere Peace be really won, may announce it nearly as many times, again.
But, when Peace shall at last be won, when the Savage shall either have
been turned to Plough and Fleece, or into ?Bone Manure,? the sin and shame
of England?s desertion of the Young Colony, in disaster and distress, must
ever remain the same ?the same warning, ? separation-teaching,? lesson to
all Sister Colonies in regard to the treatment they may expect from Eng-
land?s New Rulers when England is instrumental in bringing War on them.


APPENDIX B?referred to page 14.
Mr. Gladstone?s ?New Zealand Views.?
The formal expression of Mr. Gladstone?s, just, New Zealand Views,
alluded to, at page 14, is the following :
? I do not see how England could, with justice, throw the whole responsi-
bility of the War on the Colony. The Policy which led to the War has not
been, exclusively, that of the Colony. The Home Government has approved
of it, and is, so far, responsible for it.? ? Me. Gladstone. Hansard?s
Debates. Yol. 176, page 1477.
Word jugglers who would show us how 2 and 2 dont make 4, might,
also, show us how these pregnant Words of the Premier?s, either mean
nothing, or dont mean he holds Mr. Bull bound, in honour and equity, to
aid the Young Colony in the Wars and Disasters which Mr. Bull?s
Colonial Office so notoriously helped to bring on. But though Colonists
be held rather ? Boetian Folk,? yet, knowing ? Hem from Handsaw,? do
we know that the only true, honest, legitimate, conclusion, deducible
from this deliberate Parliamentary Utterance of the Premier?s, is that he
does hold Mr. Bull bound to do so. It may be suggested that the dust
of the Destruction of Irish Church, together with Fenian Plots and Irish
Landlords, have, since, blinded Mr. Gladstone to the wrongs of a mere
Colony, or that he forgotten these Hansard Words?but
this latter excuse in a little Publication of mine, for
a copy of which he did me the honour to return me his ? many thanks,?
these Words of his were displayed before him, not in the smallest type.
But Mr. Gladstone is not the only Statesman, pledged by his Words, to
see that England aids New Zealand in the Disasters which England has
suffered her Colonial Office so to help to bring on. In the Peers? New
Zealand Debate of March 7th, 1870, Lord Carnarvon uses the following
words of his own; and concludes a most merited Philippic against the
smooth and unctious Granville by quoting against him the succeeding
ones of Earl Eussell: ?
? J deliberately say that this Country and the Government of this Country
are to a certain extent responsible for the course which has been pursued in
New Zealand, and for the state of affairs which now exists .?
? I told the New Zealand Colonists that they might be assured of the
protection of the Crown; and that, by the Treaty of Waitangi, the
Queen had assumed the ? Sovereignty ? of New Zealand � � � 0 �.
A faint hearted Government may break these pledges, and depart from
this Policy? but from the day when they do so, the decline and fall of the
British Empire may be dated.?
APPENDIX C?referred to page 14.
? Mr. Bull in Abyssinia.?
Mu eh nonsense has been talked about Mr. Bull?s ? Abyssinian Expe-
dition,? and how that shows He would never desert a Colony, in distress.


But He lias, already, done so, in New Zealand?while the ? Case of
Abyssinia ? can have nothing in common with the Case of any Colony
desolated by any War of Mr. Bull?s bringing on. In Abyssinia, an
eccentric Potentate incarcerates some of Mr, Bull?s officious, meddlesome,
Sons?before the whole World, Mr. Bull threatens eccentric Potentate with
a good thrashing, unless he give them up ?in effect, eccentric Potentate,
contemptuously, replies ? come and take them, Bull ? ?and if, after this,
Mr. Bull had not gone and taken them, ?and though, for centuries, the
World has seen Him ? brave, as Hector ? the World would have dubbed
Him ? White Feather,? and made His Life a burden to Him. In short,
Thrashing Theodore was almost as much a National Necessity ?of Mr,
Bull?s, as is his punctual payment of the interest of His National Debt.
APPENDIX D.
? Lord Granville's Knights .?
In the Peers? Debate, March 7, Lord Granville, finally announced the
settled Imperial Policy of stripping New Zealand of the last Eed coat left
her, and leaving the Young Colony to its fate?but, at the same time,
was careful to announce that ? honours P to be bestowed on a
couple of Colonists !! Now, the silly MBHBlibof seeking to plaster
New Zealand?s deep wounds by dubbingf one Colonist, C.8., another,
perhaps, Kt., is surely a ludicrous illustration of asking for bread and
getting a stone. Swift tells us that Lilliput?s King being taller than
any of his pigmy Subjects by the whole breadth of a thumb nail struck
an ? awe ? into all beholders?but Lord Granville will find that ? New
Zealand Knights ? of his creation will strike their fellow Colonists with
anything but awe. One of the gentlemen on whom Lord Granville
proposes to operate, Donald Mac Lean, has done the Young Colony service
enough for a Peerage?but titular honours offered any true grit Colonist
by a Granville might well remind us of the ? Timeo Danaos et dona
ferentes.?
There is no Proverb about ? The like Men, the like Names ? ?but ?tis
odd that a Grenville should have stripped England of America, and that
a Granville should now seem desirous of rivalling such patriotic feat by
stripping Her of Australasia. Pope, immortalizes a Lord as ? far too
wise to walk into a Well ???surely, such eminent Peer is not typified in
Lord Granville !
