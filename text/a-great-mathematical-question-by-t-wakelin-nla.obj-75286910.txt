A GREAT MATHEMATICAL QUESTION
There are in use two measures of force, and there are, very
probably, but few mathematicians who did not think it strange
at first that there should be two different measures for the same
force. If a mass, as a cannon ball, is in motion, and we simply
consider the body as a moving body, without regard to anything it
may do, the force of the moving mass is usually measured by
multiplying the weight of the mass in pounds by its rate in feet
per second. This measure is called the momentum of the body.
If the rate of motion be double, the momentum is doubled ; if the
rate of motion trebled, the momentum is trebled. The same
mass being taken, the momentum will vary exactly as the velocity
varies. If the effect that will be produced by this same mass in
motion is considered the measure of the force, that of the moving
' o
mass is not the same, though it is the very same force, perhaps,
that produces it. Now, this will certainly seem at first sight
strange to anyone. It cannot, however, be supposed for a moment
that there are not good grounds for the difference. If the cannon
ball had been moving vertically upwards, it would have risen
to a certain height?that is, it would have overcome the action of
the force of gravity through a certain distance, and it would
then have come to rest. Let it be supposed that, on coming to
rest at the height to which it rose, it was there secured. It is then
seen clearly that a mass of iron weighing a certain number of
pounds has been raised, in virtue of its motion, to a certain height.
Now, it is asserted that if one pound be lifted one foot, a certain
amount of work has been done; and that if one pound be lifted to


a height of two feet, twice as much work has been done.FFurtherr r
if eight pounds be lifted ten feet, eighty times as much work has
been done as was done in lifting the one pound one foot high. In
the same way, then, it is argued that in virtue of its motion the
cannon ball did a certain amount of work against the force of
gravity. The pound lifted a foot high is called a foot pound, and
is the unit of measure of the work done. If the ball weighed ten
pounds, and had risen to a height of 800 feet, 8,000 foot pounds
of work would have been done in lifting the ball to the height
stated. Now, it is found that if the velocity of the ball had been
doubled, it would have risen, not to double, but to four times the
height; and if the velocity had been trebled, it would have risen,
not to treble, but to nine times the height, and so on. The work
done, then, by the moving cannon ball will vary not simply as
the velocity, but as the square of the velocity. This measure of
a force of a moving body is called the measure of its kinetic
energy. Taking the very same ball, it is asserted that
(a.) The momentum varies simply as the velocity varies;
while
(b.) The kinetic energy of the same moving ball varies as
the square of the velocity.
Except to mathematicians thoroughly habituated to the use of
this measure, it would not seem strange if this difference in the
measure of the force of a moving body were questioned. Certain
it is that the kinetic measure of force is only of a very modern
origin, ?The attempt* to make the change (in the measure of
force) was the commencement of one of the most obstinate and
curious of the controversies which form part of the history of
mechanical science. The celebrated Leibnitz was the author of
the new opinion. In 1686 he published, in the ? Leipsic Acts,?
? A short demonstration of a memorable Errour of Descartes and
others, concerning the natural law by which they think that God
always preserves the same quantity of motion, in which they
pervert mechanics.?
* ?History of the Inductive Sciences,? by the Rev. Win, Whewell,
pages 68, 69, 70, vol. ii.


? The principle that the same quantity of motion, and therefore
of moving force, is always preserved in the world, follows from
the equality of action and re-action; though Descartes had, after
his fashion, given a theological reason for it. Leibnitz allowed
that the quantity of moving force remains always the same, but
denied that this force is measured by the quantity of motion or
momentum. He maintained that the same force is requisite to
raise a weight of one pound through four feet and a weight of
four pounds through one foot, though the momenta in this case
are as one to two. This was answered by the Abbe de Conti,
who truly observed, that, allowing the effect in the two cases to be
equal, this did not prove the forces to be equal, since the effect in
this first case was produced in a double time, and therefore it was
?consistent to suppose the force only half as great. Leibnitz,
however, persisted in his innovation ; and, in 1695, laid down the
distinction between vires mortuce, or pressures, and vires vivce, the
name he gave to his own measure of force. He kept up a
correspondence with John Bernoulli, whom he converted to his
peculiar opinions on this subject ; or rather, as Bernoulli says,
made him think for himself, which ended in his proving directly
that which Leibnitz had defended by indirect reasons. Among
other arguments, he had pretended to show (what is certainly not
true) that if the common measure of forces be adhered to, a
perpetual motion would be possible. It is easy to collect many
cases which admit of being very simply and conveniently reasoned
upon by means of the vis viva ?that is, by taking the force to be
proportional to the square of the velocity and not to the velocity
itself. Thus, in order to give the arrow twice the velocity, the
bow must be four times as strong; and in all cases in which no
account is taken of the time of producing the effect, we may
conveniently use similar methods.
? But it was not till a later period that the question excited
any general notice. The Academy of Sciences of Paris in 1724
proposed as a subject for their prize dissertation the law of the
impact of bodies. Bernoulli, as a competitor, wrote a treatise
upon Leibnitzian principles, which, though not honoured with


the prize, was printed by the Academy with commendation. The
opinions which he here defended and illustrated were adopted by
several mathematicians; the controversy extended from the
mathematical to the literary world, at that time more attentive
than usual to mathematical disputes, in consequence of the great
struggle going on between the Cartesian and Newtonian systems.
It was, however, obvious, that by this time the interest of the
question, so far as the progress of dynamics was concerned, was
at an end; for the combatants all agreed as to the result in each
particular case. The laws of motion were now established ; and
the question was, by means of what definitions and abstractions
would the facts be best expressed 1? a metaphysical, not a
physical discussion, and therefore one in which the paper
philosophers?as Galileo called them ?could bear a part. In
the first volume of ? The Transactions of the Academy of St.
Petersburg,? published in 1728, there are three Leibnitzian
memoirs?by Hermann, Bullfinger, and Wolff. In England,
Clarke was an angry assailant of the German opinion, which
S?Gravesande maintained. In France, Mairan attacked the vis-
viva in 1728 with strong and victorious reasons, as the Marquise
de Chatelat declared in the first edition of her ? Treatise on Fire.?
But shortly after this praise was published, the Chateau de
Cirey, where the Marquise usually lived, became a school of
Leibnitzian opinions and the resort of the principal partisans of
the vis viva. ? Soon,? observes Mairan, ? their language was
changed; the vis viva was enthroned by the side of the monads.?
The Marquise tried to retract or explain away her praises. She
urged arguments on the other side. Still the question was not
decided. Even her friend Yoltaire was not converted. In
1741 he read a memoir ?On the Measure and Nature of Moving
Forces,? in which he maintained the old opinion. Finally,
D?Alembert in 1743 declared it to be, as it truly was, a mere
question of words; and by the turn which dynamics then took,
it ceased to be of any possible interest or importance to mathe-
maticians.?
The following criticism of the controversy is from the pen of


another writer. Several omissions have been made, because they
were almost necessarily repetitions of some statements in the
foregoing account;?? At the end of the seventeenth century a
remarkable discussion * took place on the question of the
mechanical interpretation of the vis viva. Leibnitz first gave this
name To take the simple case which was mostly
appealed to : if two equal weights be thrown up in vacuo, the one
with a velocity double of that of the other, it is well known that
the one will rise, not twice, but four times as high as that of the
other. Accordingly, Leibnitz considered that the force which
produces double the velocity is four times as effective as the other
force And the controversy continued until the
publication of D?Alembert?s work on ? Dynamics,? in which the
question is treated as being purely one of words. It was objected
to the opinion of Leibnitz that, though the double velocity would
give four times the ascent, it ought not to be forgotten that it
required twice the time; so that, in a given time, double the
velocity would produce only double the ascent, one part of the
ascent with another. This argument was never satisfactorily
answered; and while we cannot help thinking that it ought to
have been decisive of the question, we draw from it a conclusion
different from that of D?Alembert; we cannot think the dispute
a mere question of words When time is not an
element, it may be, as in the case cited, that the measure of effect
of a force is as the square of the velocity Without
strict definition, the question may degenerate into a question of
words What is meant by ?measure? and ?effect??
But it ought to have been a question, what is the proper meaning
of effect, in the expression ?effect of a force?? We have never
met with anyone who could give us an intelligible account of the
meaning of this investigation.?
It cannot be supposed for a moment that this question, treated
mathematically, is anything but an intricate one. If, however,
the principle only were considered, and the question were treated
simply as a question in mechanics, then, r whatever might be the

solution, it would be an easier one. It is only proper, however,
if not indeed necessary, to see by what means the measure of the
kinetic energy of a moving body has been obtained. The first
question that we might put here is, what is ?kinetic energy ?? or,
more strictly, what is meant by ? kinetic energy,? and how is it
measured ?
? Energy may be defined as the power of doing work, or of over-
coming resistance.* A charge of gunpowder possesses energy,
for it is capable of doing work in being discharged. A complete
account of our knowledge of energy and its transformations
would require an exhaustive treatise on every branch of physical
science, for natural philosophy is simply the science of energy.
* ? ? ? If we raise one pound of matter through a foot, we
do a certain amount of work against the earth?s attraction. If
we raise two pounds through the same height, we do twice the
amount of work, and so on for any number of pounds. Also, if
we neglect the variation in the intensity of gravitation (for short
heights this variation of intensity is insensible), the work done in
raising one pound through two feet will be double that done
in raising it one foot It is a well-known proposition
in dynamics that if a body be projected vertically upwards in
vacuo, with a velocity of v centimetics (or feet) per second, it
will rise to a height which is found by squaring the velocity and
dividing the product by twice g, where g represents the numerical
value of acceleration produced by gravity in centimetre?second
(or foot-second), units.? .... If a mass mof weight m g
be projected vertically upwards, ? we must conclude that at the
instant of projection it possessed % m v 2 units of energy. The
direction of a moving mass m can be changed in any way by
frictionless constraints. Hence we may say that if a body of mass
m be moving in any direction relative to the earth, we have at
disposal, in virtue of this motion, mv 2 units of energy.
We know nothing about absolute motion in space.
The energy which a system possesses in virtue of the relative

edition.


motion of its parts is called kinetic energy There is
one form of energy which can be readily measured, and to which
all other forces can be readily reduced?viz., heat.?
By far the clearest writer on this subject that I have read is
Balfour Stewart. He made the ? reason why ?so plain that a
very brief study of the question soon pointed to the place where
the fallacy, if any, lay. I hope the reader will, therefore,
excuse me for giving at length his explanation of how the measure
of kinetic energy is obtained.
? Before proceeding* any further, let us attach a more definite
idea to the word ? work ; ? and to enable us to do so we may call
to our aid the all-pervading force of gravity, against the action of
which our efforts are so frequently directed. Let us agree to consider
a kilogramme raised up vertically one metre in vacuo against
gravity as representing the performance of unit of work. It is
necessary to say in vacuo, because, for example, if the weight be
made of wood and the medium be water, it is evident that we
perform no work by lifting the wood one foot higher in the water ;
on the other hand, we should perform work by causing it to sink.
A kilogramme raised one foot in vacuo against gravity is taken as
unit of work performed.
?Now, according to this standard, it is easy to perceive that the
kilogramme raised two metres in height will represent the
performance of two units of work; if raised three metres, the
performance of three metres, and so on. Further, a weight of
two kilogrammes raised one metre will denote two units of work
done; and a weight of three kilogrammes raised one metre, three
units, and so on. In fine, if the mass of matter be m kilogrammes,
and if it be raised h metres against the force of gravity, which we
may suppose to be the same for all points at the earth?s surface,
then the work done = mh.
? Let us study the action of this force of gravity in producing
velocity. In order to do so, let us suppose that the metre and the
second are our units of space and time, while our unit of velocity
is represented by a body moving at the rate of one metre in a
* Stewart?s ?Heat,? pages3ol-304.


second, and our unit of acceleration is production of unit velocity
by a force acting for one second. Under this convention the force
of gravity, or g, will be denoted by 9.8, since, when a body is
allowed to fall under the action of gravity for one second, it is
found to have acquired the velocity of 9.8 metres in one second.
If we consider how far this body has fallen in one second, in order
to acquire this velocity, we shall find the distance to be 4.9 metres;
and if, on the other hand, we project a body upwards with a
velocity of 9.8 metres per second, it will rise against gravity 4.9
metres in height. A kilogramme projected vertically upwards
with the velocity of 9.8 metres per second is therefore capable of
doing 4.9 units of work before it comes to rest.
? Again, it is found that a body allowed to fall for two seconds
under the influence of gravity will have acquired the velocity of
19.6 metres in one second, and that during this time it will have
fallen 19.6 metres. A kilogramme projected vertically upwards
with the initial velocity of 19.6 metres per second will therefore
rise 19.6 metres in height, and will do 19.6 units of work before it
comes to a rest.
?We thus see that a double velocity enables the body to do
four times as much work. In fine, in order to find out how much
work a body one kilogramme in weight projected upwards with
the velocity v is capable of doing, we have only to ask how high it
will rise. This will be given by the following formula ;
Height of ascent or work done (v X v) ; 19.6.
? A little consideration will show us that it is not necessary for
the body to be moving with this velocity vertically upwards in
order to be capable of doing this work; indeed, we have only
selected the force of gravity as one of the most prominent forces
against which work is done; but the moving body may like-
wise be made to do work against a spring, or even by means of a
single fixed pulley or otherwise it may be made to raise another
body against gravity. In fact, taking the words ? work done ?in
their most general sense, as representing space moved over against
the action of any force, we see that the above formula will hold


good without reference to the direction in which the weight is
moving; and if we consider the kilogramme as denoting the unit
of mass, we have the following general expression for the work
capable of being done against any force by a body of mass m and
velocity v :
Work = (m X v?) \ 19.6,
the unit of work being always the amount represented by raising
one kilogramme one metre against terrestrial gravity, or the
kilogrammetre, as this is termed. A body such as a kilogramme,
moving with a certain velocity, may therefore be said to have a
certain amount of energy stored up in it in virtue of this velocity.
This energy is termed energy of motion, or kinetic energy.?
Though it is not expressly mentioned by the writer of the fore-
going that the time taken may be altogether neglected, yet it is
implied in the explanation given. Thus, whether a body were
raised- gradually and slowly to a certain height, or thrown up
rapidly to that height, the work done would be the same. Pro-
fessor Everett, however, expressly says, ? that the work done is
independent of the time.?
A great authority in mathematics, Mr. Routh, speaks very
definitely on this point in the measure of the kinetic energy. He
sa y S ; ?? It should be noticed that the work done* by given forces
as the body moves from one given position to another is indepen-
dent of the time of transit. The work is a space integral, and not
a time integral.? He thus defines the unit of work:?? The
theoretical unit of work is the work donef by a dynamical unit of
force acting through a unit of space. The work required to raise
the centre of gravity of a given mass?a given height at a given
place?may be taken as the unit of work. English engineers
use a pound for the mass and a foot for the height, and the unit
is then called a foot-pound.? Further on, he says about the work
done by the force of gravity ?? Suppose a weight mg to be placed
at any height h above the surface of the earth. | As it falls
through the height, the force of gravity does work which is
measured by mg h. The weight has acquired a velocity v, half of
* Routh?s ? Rigid Dynamics,? page 260. f Ibid., 263. J Ibid., 270.


its vis viva is | m v l , which is known to be equal to mg h.? In
another place he remarks upon the term used to express the force
of a moving body?? Coriolis Helmholtz and others* have sug-
gested that it would be more convenient if the vis viva were defined
to be half the sum of the products of the masses into the squares
of the velocities. But this change in the meaning of a term so
widely established in Europe would be very likely to cause some
confusion. It seems better for the present to use another name,
such as kinetic energy,? If Mr. Routh?s formula for the work
done be compared with that of Balfour Stewart?s, it will be seen
that the two formulae are a little different. This difference is only
?one in form, not one in reality.
From the foregoing accounts it will be gathered?
(l.) That the kinetic energy is the power of doing work.
(2.) That the unit of work is the foot-pound.
(3.) That a pound mass thrown vertically upwards will be
brought to rest by the force of gravity at a certain
height.
(4.) That another pound mass lifted to the very same
height, however slowly, will have had done upon it
only the same amount of work.
(5.) That various pound masses, projected upwards with
various velocities, will rise to various heights, which
will be proportional to the square of their velocities.
{6.) That the heights in feet to which the different velocities
would carry the pound masses are the measures in
foot-pounds of the energies of the pound masses moving
with their several velocities.
(7.) That whatever may be the energy of a pound mass in
motion, the energy of a larger mass having the same
rate of motion will be simply greater in proportion to
its mass.
If a pound mass be projected upwards with a velocity of 32
ieet per second, it will rise to a height of 16 feet, having been

brought to rest by the action of the force of gravity, and 16 foot-
pounds of work will have been done. The kinetic energy, then, of
a pound mass moving with a velocity of 32 feet per second is
equal to 16 foot-pounds of work. A pound mass projected verti-
cally upwards with twice this velocity?that is, with a velocity of
64 feet per second, will rise to four times the height, that is, to
four times 16 feet (or 64 feet), and will have had done upon it
four times the amount of work. The kinetic energy, then, of a
pound mass moving with a velocity of 64 feet per second is said
to be equal to 64 foot-pounds of work. Another example may
perhaps be excused. If a pound mass be projected upwards with
a velocity three times that of the first ?that is, with a velocity of
96 feet per second?it will rise to nine times the height, that is, to
a height of 144 feet, and will have had done upon it nine times
the work. The kinetic energy then of a pound mass moving with
a velocity of 96 feet per second is said to be equal to 144 foot-
pounds of work. The following table gives the foregoing estimates
in a more concise form, with the addition of further similar esti-
mates. The mass taken is a pound mass. In the table, the word
? velocity ? means the velocity with which the pound mass moved
initially in feet per second ; the ? height ? means the height in
feet to which the different velocities would carry the various
pound masses ; and ? work ? means the estimated amount of work
done in foot-pounds ;
Let a pound mass be allowed to fall from a conveniently-chosen
height above the surface of the earth :?the force of gravity will
constantly increase its rate of descent. At the end of the first
second the mass will have fallen through a space of 16 feet, and
be moving with a velocity of 32 feet per second. By the pre-


vious paragraph it will be seen that the kinetic energy at the end
of the first second of the falling pound mass is equal to 16 foot-
pounds of work. Assuming this to he correct, comparative state-
ments similar to those in the last paragraph can be made. The
pound mass falling freely at the end of the second second will
have fallen through a space of 64 feet, and will be moving with a
velocity of 64 feet per second. The kinetic energy is equal to
?64 foot-pounds of work, by the previous paragraph. At the end
of the third second the mass will have fallen through a space
equal to 144 feet, and will be moving at the rate of 96 feet per
second. The kinetic energy of the pound mass moving with this
velocity is (by the previous paragraph) said to be equal to 144
foot-pounds of work. On comparing these figures with those
given in the table attached to the last paragraph, it will be found
that in resisting or in producing motion in a mass during the
same times the force of gravity does equal amounts of work.
Clear, or at any rate distinct, ideas have now, perhaps, been
formed of what has been meant by ? kinetic energy.? Repetitions
of similar arguments and facts have now probably made clear to
the mind the ? reason why ? of the difference of the measures of
?kinetic? energy and of momentum. All depends upon ?the
work done.? We must, however, go more closely into the
question. It is necessary to bear clearly in mind that the measure
of the work done by the force of gravity is the space through
which a body falls. Let us now take each successive second
during which a mass falls from a limited and convenient height.
During the first second the mass falls 16 feet, and the force of
gravity has done 16 foot-pounds of work; during the second
second the mass falls 48 feet, and the force of gravity does 48
foot-pounds of work; during the third second the mass falls
through 80 feet, and the force of gravity does 80 foot-pounds of
work, and so on, as follows : ?ln the fourth second the fall is 112
feet, and work done 112 foot-pounds in that second ; in the fifth
second the fall is 144 feet, and the work done 144 foot-pounds in
that second; in the sixth second 176 feet, and work done 176
foot-pounds in that second. Now, is it not strange that the


force of gravity should do more work in one second than in
another ?
proceeding to explain, or endeavour to explain, the
discrepancy, it will be necessary to recall to mind the terms
o� the first law of motion. Mr. Todhunter says ;?? On the laws
of motion as a foundation the whole science of dynamics rests.? *
He gives Newton?s definition ?? The first law of motion is as
follows :? ? Every body continues in a state of rest, or of uniform
motion in a straight line, except in so far as it may be compelled
to change that state by a force acting on it.? ?
During the first second a mass falls 16 feet, and the force of
gravity is said to do 16 foot-pounds of work. Assume that the
second clause of the sentence is correct. At the end of the first
second the mass was moving with a velocity of 32 feet per second.
What would he the motion of the mass if the force of gravity
suddenly ceased to act at the end of the first second ? The first
law of motion tells us that the mass would persist in motion at this
rate that as it would pass over 32 feet in every second. Of the
space passed through by the mass during this second second , 32
feet then are entirely due to the force of gravity acting during the
first second. This 32 feet , then , must he excluded from the
measure of the work done hy the force of gravity during the second
second. This leaves 16 foot-pounds as the work done by gravity
during second second. At the beginning of the third second the
mass is moving with a velocity of 64 feet, as if the force of gravity
had suddenly ceased to act at the beginning of the third second.
This GJf- feet is therefore not due to the force of gravity acting
during the third second by the first law of motion. This, again,
leaves only 16 foot-pounds as the work done by gravity during
the third second. At the beginning of the fourth second the mass
is moving with a velocity of 96 feet per second, and will during
this second pass over this distance. This 96 feet must therefore
be likewise excluded from the measure of the work done by the
force of gravity during the fourth second. This leaves again only
16 foot-pounds of work done during this second.
* Todhunter?s ?Mechanics for Beginners,? pages 210, 211.


It will therefore be seen that the distance through which a body
falls during the time of falling is not a measure of the work of
the force of gravity during that time. This of - course means that
the ordinary measure of the kinetic energy of a mass in motion
is an erroneous one.
