MEMORIAL SERVICE
SUNDAY, JULY 9th, 1933, at 7 p.m.
To Commemorate the Late
Efb. limnj Untuarti, 10.®.
HYMN 581. Tune, “Rutherford.”
The sands of time are sinking;
The dawn of heaven breaks;
The summer morn I’ve sighed for,
The fair, sweet morn, awakes.
Dark, dark hath been the midnight.
But dayspring is at hand,
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel’s land.
O Christ! He is the fountain,
The deep, sweet well of love;
The streams on earth I’ve tasted
More deep I’ll drink above:
There to an ocean fulness
His mercy doth expand.
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel’s land.
With mercy and with judgment
My web of time He wove.
And aye the dews of sorrow
Were lustred by His love;
I’ll bless the hand that guided.
I’ll bless the heart that planned.
When throned where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel’s land.
I’ve wrestled on towards heaven,
’Gainst storm and wind and tide;
Now', like a weary traveller
That leaneth on his guide.
Amid the shades of evening.
While sinks life’s lingering sand,
I hail the glory dawning
In Immanuel’s land.
PRAYER BY THE REV. IRVING BENSON.
PROSE HYMN, 716. Chant, “Farrant.”
Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in
peace, according to Thy word.
For mine eyes have seen Thy salvation,
Which Thou hast prepared before the face of
all people;
A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory
of Thy people Israel.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to
the Holy Ghost;
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever
shall be: world without end. Amen.

Tune, “Holingside.”
HYMN 414.
Jesus, Lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy bosom fly,
While the nearer waters roll.
While the tempest still is high;
Hide me, O my Saviour, hide,
Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide;
O receive my soul at last!
Other refuge have I none;
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
Leave, ah! leave me not alone;
Still support and comfort me.
All my trust on Thee is stayed;
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenceless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.
Thou, O Christ, art all I want;
More than all in Thee I find;
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
Heal the sick, and lead the blind.
Just and holy is Thy Name,
I am all unrighteousness;
False and full of sin I am.
Thou art full of truth and grace.
Plenteous grace with Thee is found.
Grace to cover all my sin;
Let the healing streams abound;
Make and keep me pure within.
Thou of life the fountain art,
Freely let me take of Thee;
Spring Thou up within my heart,
Rise to all eternity.
PRAYER.
NEW TESTAMENT LESSON—ST. JOHN 14: 1-19.
Mr. LEONARD V. BIGGS.
ANTHEM—From “Songs of Farewell.”
There is an old belief, that on some solemn
shore, beyond the sphere of grief, dear friends
shall meet once more. Beyond the sphere of
Time and Sin, and Fate’s control, serene in
changeless prime of body and of soul. That
creed I fain would keep, that hope I’ll ne’er for-
go. Eternal be the sleep if not to waken so. —
C. Hubert H. Parry.

SERMON.
HYMN 627 in Methodist Hymn Book.
Tune, “Sandon,” 568.
Light of the world, faint were our weary feet
With wandering far;
But Thou didst come our lonely hearts to greet,
O Morning Star;
And Thou didst bid us lift our gaze on high,
To see the glory of the glowing sky.
In days long past we missed our homeward way;
We could not see;
Blind were our eyes, our feet were hound to
stray:
How blind to Thee!
But Thou didst pity. Lord, our gloomy plight;
And Thon didst touch our eyes, and give them
sight.
Now hallelujahs rise along the road
Our glad feet tread;
Thy love hath shared our sorrow’s heavy loan;
There’s light o’erhead;
Glory to Thee whose love hath led us on.
Glory for all the great things Thon hast done.
Where is death’s sting, where, grave, thy victory,
Where all the pain,
Now that thy King the veil that hung o’er thee
Hath rent in twain?
Light of the world, we hear Thee bid us come
To light and love in Thine eternal home.
APPRECIATION OF DR. HENRY HOWARD BY
MR. HERBERT BROOKES.
INTIMATIONS.
OFFERING.
OFFERTORY—Air—Bass.
The trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall
be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
—From “The Messiah” (F. Handel).
HYMN 286. Tune, “Eventide.”
Abide with me: fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide:
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee.
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.
Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;
Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see;
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.
I need Thy presence every passing hour;
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter’s power?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can he?
Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me.
I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness:
Where is death’s sting? where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still if Thou abide with me.
Hold Thou Thy Cross before my closing eyes
Shine through the gloom, and point me to the
skies;
Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain
shadows flee:
In life and death, O Lord, abide with me.
