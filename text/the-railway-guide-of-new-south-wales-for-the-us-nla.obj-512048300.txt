P REFACE.
This Guide Book is intended as a convenient volume of reference for
excursionists and others who travel by Railway in New South Wales.
The Introduction contains a short history of the Railway system
of the Colony, and subsequent chapters furnish an outline of routes,
and all information as to the various Stations. The illustrated Itinerary,
for the use of the traveller in search of the picturesque, includes brief
notices of places of interest which lie within easy reach of the
Railway line, and the Tourists’ Map shews the mountainous country
traversed by the Great Western Railway, from the Nepean River to
Bowenfels.
The papers, descriptive of the Fish River Caves, and explaining
the geological formation of the Blue Mountains, contributed by Mr.
C. S. Wilkinson, F.G.S., will be read with interest, as will also the
Treatise by Dr. Woods, F.L.S., illustrated by Miss Harriet Scott, on
the Flora of that part of the country. The other illustrations form a
novel and interesting feature of the work; they are pictures from Nature,
reproduced by the photo-mechanical processes recently introduced by
Mr. Richards, Government Printer.
The Compiler has to acknowledge his obligations to Messrs.
Burton, Tingle, and Wells, from whose descriptive writings he has
derived much valuable information, which he ventures to believe is
now offered to the public in a compendious and convenient form.

INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.
1.—RISE AND PROGRESS OF RAILWAYS IN NEW SOUTH WALES.
Early History.— The first combined move-
ment on the subject of introducing railways
into New South Wales took place in Jan-
uary, 1846. On the 29th of that month a
public meeting was held in Sydney, and a
committee appointed, who, on the 26th
August, reported that, from the best ascer-
tained data as to the products, population,
and traffic, they believed that a line from
Sydney to Go alburn might be constructed
at £6,000 per mile, and that a net profit of
8 per cent, might be anticipated on the
capital expended. In the beginning of 1848
a survey of the line to Goulburn was com-
pleted by Mr. Woore. In April, in the
same year, a petition, based on this report,
was presented to the Legislative Council,
and referred to a Select Committee, of which
Mr. Charles Cowper* was chairman. A
report was brought up, and on the 15th
June the Council passed a series of resolu-
tions to the effect that the period had
arrived for the formation of railways in the
Colony, and that it was expedient for the
Government to offer some inducements to
encourage private enterprise. The resolu-
tions were transmitted to the Secretary of
State by the Governor-General, with a
recommendation that the encouragement
asked for should be granted. On the 11th
September, 1848, a Provisional Committee
was appointed, and in November the
prospectus of the “ Sydney Tramroad and
Railway Company” was issued. The capital
was £lOO,OOO, and interest for ten years at
5 per cent, was guaranteed by the Govern-
ment. The expressed intention of the
projectors was that a main trunk line should
be carried from Sydney to the point from
which it might afterwards be determined
that the Southern and Western or North-
western Branches respectively should diverge.
Eventually it was intended to augment the
capital in order to carry the line to Goul-
burn, and, if found practicable, to Bathurst
also.
On the 13th November, 1849, the first
general meeting of the shareholders was
held, and the Sydney Bailway Company
(incorporated by Act of 13 Victoria) then
entered on its duties, and was managed by
a Directory elected by the shareholders.
The survey of the line from Sydney to
Parramatta and Liverpool was completed in
December, 1849, and on Bth January, 1850,
the first report of the directors was read.
It congratulated the shareholders on their
position and prospects ; and notwithstanding
the apathy of some persons, and the undis-
guised hostility of others, the directors
entertained the fullest confidence as to the
ultimate success of the undertaking. The
sum of £lO,OOO, required by the Act to be
raised before the Company could commence
operations, having been paid into the
Colonial Treasury, the directors lost no
time in breaking ground. On 3rd July,
1850, the first turf of the first railway in
the Australian Colonies was turned by the
Honorable Mrs. Keith Stewart, in the
presence of her father, Sir Charles Augustus
Fitz Eoy, and a large concourse of inhabi-
tants.
The financial prospects of the Company,
however, soon became so gloomy that the
directors found it necessary to make a
general reduction in the salaries of their
officers. The directors complained of the
obstacles they met with, and stated that but
for the countenance and support of the
local Government they should feel disposed
to abandon a post which was beset at every
stage with difficulties and discouragements
of no ordinary kind. In this unpromising
position of their affairs the first contract for
4| miles from Haslem’s Creek towards Syd-
ney was accepted. The progress of the work
continued satisfactory until the discovery of
* Afterwards the Hod. Sir Charles Cowper,
K.C.M.GL, now deceased.


gold in the Bathurst district upset the calcu-
lations of the contractor and the directors,
threatening the former with ruin and entail-
ing much anxiety on the latter, from the
sudden and unexampled rise in the price ol
labour and materials. Under these circum-
stances the directors were induced to release
the contractor from his agreement, without
enforcing the penalties for non-fulfilment.
The offer of Mr. Eandal, the contractor, to
carry out the works to Ashfield and subse-
quently to Parramatta, at a schedule of prices,
was afterwards accepted, and as the attrac-
tions of the gold-fields continued to diminish
the supply of labour in Sydney, the Govern-
ment agreed to import five hundred labourers
from England. An additional loan of
£150,000 was obtained from the Government
in the proportion of three-fifths of public
money to two-fifths subscribed, on condition
that the Government should have the power
to name one half of the directors. The
Company had now reached the last stage of
its existence, and its affairs were under the
direction of a Board, partly elected by the
shareholders and partly nominated by the
Government.
At the first half-yearly meeting on 17th
January, 1854, the directors stated that from
the enormous rise in wages and materials
the cost of the line to Parramatta would
be increased from £218,420, as estimated in
1858, to £320,000, besides £69,000 for the
Darling Harbour works. To provide for
this, the capital was increased by £lOO,OOO,
and an additional loan of £150,000 obtained
from Government, on the same terms as the
former loan. The estimate of £320,000 for
the line to Parramatta was made in antici-
pation of a fall in the rate of wages ; but
instead of falling they continued to rise, and
in January 1855, the Engineer had to
increase his estimate to £500,000. This
startling announcement must have satisfied
the shareholders of the hopelessness of carry-
ing out the works at a profit, and prepared
them for a transfer of the property to the
Government.
While the Sydney Hallway Company was
struggling with the unprecedented difficulties
of the times, and leaning on the strong arm of
the Government for support, a movement took
place in 1853 for the construction of a line
of Bailway between Newcastle and Maitland.
A Provisional Committee was appointed
on 20th April, and a capital of £lOO,OOO
subscribed on tbe spot. With flattering
anticipations, and tbe promise of aid from
the Government, tbe Hunter River Railway
started into life; but after an existence of
little more than a year, which was necessarily
exhausted in preliminary arrangements, this
Company had also to yield to the pressure
of the times, and be swallowed up by the
Government.
Railways of N. S. Wales when transferred
to the Government— Accordingly, under the
Act 18 Victoria Ho. 40, the properties of
both the Companies were transferred to the
Government, the Hunter River at par, and
the Sydney Railway with a bonus of 7 per
cent, added. Prom the date of these transfers
the railways became the property of the
Government, and have since been carried out
under the superintendence of Government
officers.
The Railways of New South Wales, though
essentially one entire concern, as the pro-
perty of the Government, are naturally and
geographically separated into two great
divisions—the one having its principal termi-
nus at Sydney, the other at Newcastle;
upwards of 60 miles apart. The former
consists of two great trunk lines, and one
subsidiary branch ; the latter of a great
trunk line throughout, with two branches
and several private lines from | mile to 8
miles in length, connecting the various Coal
Mines.
The line from Sydney to Parramatta was
opened for traffic on 26th September, 1855,
just twenty-five years after the opening of
the first railway in England —the line from
Liverpool to Manchester on 16th September,
1830.
Peculiarities of Construction—Curves and
Gradients, &c. —The English narrow gauge
of 4 feet 8| inches has been adopted for the
railways of New South Wales, but has not
been followed in any of the other Australian
Colonies. The battle of the gauges was
fought as fiercely in Australia as in the
Mother Country, and with similar unfortu-
nate results ; and now that we are approach-
ing the borders of the neighbouring Colonies,
the inconvenience of the break of gauge will
begin to be felt.


The line from Sydney to Parramatta
Junction (13 miles) has double way and
works, and was originally laid with the
Barlow patent rail of 75 lbs. to the yard,
whichhas since been replaced with the double-
headed rail of the same w r eight. From
Newcastle to Hexham (10 miles) and on the
Bullock Island Branch (1| mile) the line is
also double, but with these exceptions all the
lines are single. Preparations are however
being made for doubling the line from
Parramatta Junction to Parramatta (1 mile);
and also the length between the bottom of
the Lithgow Zig Zag to Bowenfels (4 miles).
The Richmond Branch is laid with rails
of 55 lbs. per yard. The rails on the other
lines as far as Goulburn, Bathurst, and
Tamworth, are of wrought iron, double-
headed and fish-jointed, and weigh 75 lbs.
per yard. The chairs are 25 lbs. each, and
are secured to the sleepers with wrought-
iron spikes. Beyond these termini a lighter
system of construction is adopted. The
rails which are single-headed and fish-jointed,
weigh 70 lbs. to the yard, and are secured
to the sleepers by spikes and screws alter-
nately.
On the line from Sydney to Goulburn,
with the exception of seven curves of 16
and five of 20 chains radius, there is no curve
of a smaller radius than 30 chains. From
Goulburn to Wagga Wagga, excepting one
of 19 chains, the smallest radius of a curve
is 20 chains, and from this to Albury the
smallest is 30 chains.
On the line from Parramatta to Penrith
the smallest radius of a curve is 30 chains.
Between Penrith and Bathurst the smallest
is 528 feet, the total length of such curves
being 5 miles, including those on the Zig
Zags. There are also 20 miles of curves
ranging from 8 to 12 chains radius. Be-
tween Bathurst and Orange the smallest
radius of a curve is 12 chains.
On the line from Newcastle to Murru-
rundi, if we except one of 20 chains, there
is no curve of smaller radius than 30 chains.
From this to Tamworth the smallest radius
of a curve is 12 chains.
The steepest incline on the line from
Sydney to Picton is 1 in 66. Hence to
Mittagong there is one continuous incline
of 1 in 33 for 67 chains, and lin 30 for a
continuous length of 2 miles 2 chains. There
are also inclines of lin 33 for 17, 45, 42,
and 9 chains, and lin 30 for 70 chains. From
Mittagong to Goulburn there are none
steeper than 1 in 40, From Goulburn to
Wagga Wagga the steepest incline is 1 in
40 for 1 mile 58 chains; and thence to
Albury, 1 in 60 for 1 mile 64 chains.
From Parramatta Junction to Penrith the
steepest gradient is 1 in 60 for 74 chains ;
and from Penrith to Bathurst, the lengths
of the steepest inclines are lin 30 for 1
mile 63 chains ;lin 33 for 16 mil?s 53
chains; 1 in 40 for 6 miles 20 chains ; 1 in
42 for 4 miles 2 chains ;lin 46 for 31
chains ; 1 in 47'89 for 70 chains ; 1 in 48 for
48 chains ; and lin 50 for 4 miles 77 chains —
making 35| miles of inclines ranging from
1 in 30 to lin 50. From Bathurst to
Orange the steepest incline is 1 in 40, and
the longest continuous incline 2 miles 70
chains.
Between Newcastle and West Maitland
the steepest gradient is lin 63, and from
Maitland to Singleton 1 in 80. From
Singleton to Muswellbrook there are four
short inclines of lin33 ; thence to Murru-
rundi the steepest gradient is lin 50, and
to Tamworth lin 40.
The rails and sleepers on the Darling
Harbour, Haslem’s Creek Cemetery, Colling-
wood, and Morpeth Branches, are the same
as on the main line. The Bullock Island
Branch for mineral traffic is laid throughout
with steel rails of the same weight and
section as on the main line. The smallest
radius of a curve is 12 chains, and the
steepest gradient 1 in 200.
Capital expended —The total capital ex-
pended on lines open to 31st December,
1877, was £8,883,177, upon which the
interest was 4'Bl per cent. The expenditure
for construction was £9,314,500, upon which
the interest was £443,688, or 4 - 76 per cent.
This will appear moderate when the difficulty
of the country and the heavy nature of many
of the works are taken into consideration.
Thus, on the Southern Line there are the
wrought-iron girder bridge over the Nepean
at Menangle, the costly viaducts at Picton,
Wingecarribbee, Wollondilly, Mulwarree,


Barber’s and Boxer’s Creeks, and the expen-
sive tunnels at Redbank Range and Gibraltar
Gap. On the W estern Line—the bridge over
the Nepean at Penrith, the viaducts at
Knapsack Gully and Litbgow Valley, the
Clarence tunnel, and the tunnels at Litbgow
Valley Zigzag, Morangaroo, and under the
Mudgee Road, and the bridges over Solitary
Creek at Parana, and over the Macquarie
River at Bathurst. And on the Northern
Line —the handsome bridges over the Hunter
at Singleton and Aberdeen, and the tunnel
through the Liverpool Range.
Summit elevations.-The summit eleva-
tions above high-water mark at Sydney on
the different lines are 2,357 feet on the
Southern, 3,658 feet on the Western, and
2,113 feet on the Northern.
Zigzags at Emu Plains and Lithgow
Valley. —The principal objects of interest
on our Railways are the Zigzags at Emu
Plains and Lithgow Valley on the Western
Line. Since the opening of_ the line to
Bowenfels thousands of tourists from all
lands have visited these works, and expressed
unbounded admiration at the rugged gran-
deur of the scenery, and the engineering
skill and pluck displayed in designing and
constructing these stupendous works, which
are probably not surpassed on any railway
in the world. But a description or even an
inspection of the Lithgow Valley Zigzag
gives only an imperfect idea of the difficulties
that had to be encountered, and the vast
amount of work that had to be performed,
before it was hewn into its present shape.
Erom the Clarence Tunnel to the bottom of
the Valley there is a descent of 470 leet,
through a deep and rugged ravine, where
formerly there was scarcely footing for the
mountain goat, and where the surveyor s
assistants had occasionally to be suspended
by ropes in the performance of their perilous
duties ; but human skill and enterprise have
opened a pathway through these broken
mountain ranges for the railway train that
now traverses the sides of the mountain on
a gradient of 1 in 42. In the execution of
these works, two gigantic masses of rock
the one estimated to contain 40,000 and the
other 45,000 tons—had to be blasted; and
the contractor, after calculating the cost
determined to call in the aid of electricity
for that purpose. For the first mass 3i tons
of blasting powder were employed, and the
Superintendent of Telegraphs (Mr. E. C.
Cracknell) succeeded in firing the blast, which
tore the mountain asunder, heaving huge
masses of rock into the valley, and leaving the
face of the parent mountain almost as smooth
as if it had been cut with chisels. The removal
of the second mass—the blowing up of a
tunnel—for which 3| tons of powder were
used, was successfully accomplished also by
galvanic agency; the electric spark having
been communicated to the powder by the hand
of the Countess of Belmore, in the presence
of His Excellency the Governor, and a large
concourse of spectators who had assembled
to witness the effects of the explosion.
Statistical and Descriptive.— The follow-
ing Statistical and Descriptive Information
will be read with interest. It forms the sum-
mary of the transactions for the year 1877,
and is taken from the Report of the Com-
missioner for Railways, Charles A. Goodchap,
Esq., dated the 12th of June, 1878, and
brought up to the 31st December, 1877.
Mr. Goodchap reports that: “ The expendi-
ture for construction was £9,314,500, upon
which the interest was £443,688, or 4'76
per cent. The capital expended on Lines
open for traffic, was £8,883,177, upon which
the interest was 4'Bl per cent. The net
earnings were £396,935, yielding 4‘26 per
cent, to the total capital expenditure, and
4-47 per cent, to the capital expenditure on
Lines open for traffic. The interest paid by
Government was therefore only 'SO and '34
per cent, in excess of the percentage of net
earnings to total capital, and to capital re-
productively employed At
the close of the year (1877) 598 miles of
Line were open for traffic, and 217 A miles
were in the course of construction, to be
completed by 31st December, 1880. The
rolling stock consisted of 138 locomotives,
352 coaching and 2,806 goods vehicles. The
number of employes was 3,289, and the
wages paid £305,581 16s. Bd, being an in-
crease of £68,404 17s. 10d., over 1876. The
cost of the railway materials, in the con-
veyance of which 92 vessels were employed,
amounted to £375,341, and the freight and
insurance to £31,169, making a total of
£406,510. During the year 1877, 33,707
passenger trains and 23,532 goods trains

were run a distance of 2,106,802 miles.
The earnings amounted to £815,920, and
the working expenditure to £418,985, or
51-35 per cent, of the earnings. The number
of passengers who travelled was 2,957,144,
of whom 703,325 were first class and
2,253,819 were second class. The propor-
tion per centage of these classes is for first
class passengers 13'82, second class 56‘84
and for season-ticket holders 29'34. The
merchandise traffic consisted of 580,657 live
stock, 133,597 bales of wool, 1,024,411 tons
of minerals, and 360,932 tons of general
goods. The average earnings per mile open
were £1,478, the average expenditure was
£759, the net earnings were £719. The
average earnings per train mile were 92’95d.,
the expenses 47'73d., and the net earnings
45 - 22 d. There was an increase of 107,081
in the number of first class passengers, of
254,715 second class, and 116,402 in the
journeys made by season-ticket holders, an
increase in the receipts of £37,718 from
coaching traffic, and of £84,977 from goods
traffic —making a total increase of £122,695.
The working expenses were increased by
£79,579, and the net earnings by £43,116.
On the South and West Lines there was an
increase in interest on capital of ‘O2 per
cent., on the North of ‘l2, and on all lines
combined of ’O4 per cent.”
In view of the above valuable information
in bis pre-cited Report Mr. G-oodchap, the
Commissioner for Railways, says: It
must be satisfactory to all wbo are interested
in the welfare of New South "Wales to
that tbe results arrived at in this review of
the transactions of tbe Railways during the
past year show a steady increase in tbe
prosperity of this large and important
portion of the' public works. Not only
have tbe Lines of Railway been considerably
extended, so as ultimately to assist in de-
veloping tbe resources of comparatively
remote districts, but in their immediate
results have proved to be highly successful.
This condition of affairs, showing as it does
that the greater portion of the public loans
is invested in works returning a high rate
of interest, cannot fail to increase confidence
in the financial stability of the Colony, and
enhance the value of its securities.
Progressive Utility and Financial con-
dition.—The following carefully prepared
and authentic Tabular View of the Pro-
gressive Utility and Financial Condition of
the railways of New South Wales, from the
opening of the trunk line to Parramatta
in 1855 to 31st December, 1877, will be
appreciated by all thoughtful readers.


This Tabular Yiew shows that the expen-
diture for the construction of our railways
is a wise and profitable investment of the
public funds on reproductive works, which
already yield a direct return on the capital
expended almost equal to the interest on the
money borrowed, and confer on the Colony
indirect benefits which cannot be estimated
in money. It is also satisfactory to know
that the farther our railways have been
extended the more profitable they have
become ; and from the steady increase of
profit during the last few years it may
reasonably be anticipated that the time is
not distant when our railways will be self-
supporting, that further extensions will tend
still more to increase the profits on existing
lines, and thus gradually diminish and ulti-
mately extinguish the annual payment of
interest from the Consolidated Eevenue Pund.
Present and prospective advantage.— lt
is a question of policy for the Govern-
ment to suggest, and for Parliament to
decide, in what direction and within what
period further extensions shall be made ; but
it is almost a truism to assert, that our
railway system will be incomplete till our
lines shall reach the borders of the neigh-
bouring Colonies. Sooner or later this
desirable object will be accomplished, and
every step in the progress will be attended
with beneficial results. The tendency of
railway extension is to reduce the price of
commodities to the consumer, and enhance
the value of land; to stimulate production,
by widening the area within which agricul-
tural and garden produce, and animal and
vegetable substances can be brought to
market ; to accelerate the development of
our own resources, and by rapid and constant
inter-communication and interchange of
commodities wdth our neighbours, to extend
and strengthen our commercial relations, to
cement the bond of union between the
Australian Colonies, and to advance the
general prosperity of the country at large.*

II.—ANALYSIS OF RAILWAY ROUTES-MAIN AND SUBSIDIARY BRANCHES, WITH
STATIONS AND PLATFORMS.
Eailway System in New South Wales
The Eailway system of New South Wales
consists of three Trunk Lines at present,
one of which is unconnected with the other
two : (1) The Great Southern Line; (2)
the Great Western Line ; and (3) the Great
Northern Line. The Southern Line starts
from Sydney, and has, as a trunk line, a
southerly direction from Parramatta Junc-
tion ; up to which station it runs in common
with the Western. The Western Line also
starts from Sydney, hut diverges from the
Southern Line at Parramatta Junction; (13
miles distant from Sydney). The Northern
Line starts from Newcastle, and has its ter-
minus at present at Tamworth.
(1.) Taking the Western Line first, it
may thus be briefly described.
The Western Line (by a north-westerly
turn) passes through Parramatta, and has,
for the most part, a westerly direction till it
comes to Bathurst, 145 miles from Sydney.
Its general direction is then north-westerly
until it reaches Orange, 47 miles further.
Thence the course of this line will be due
north to Wellington, and from Wellington
north-west to Dubbo. The continuation of
this line from Orange to Dubbo is now in the
course of construction. On the Western
Line there are, including the termini at
Orange and at Sydney, (*) fifty-nine stations,
and other occasional stopping places, for the
distance of 192 miles. At the Blacktown
* That is, taking in the trunk line from Sydney
to Parramatta Junction, common to both the Western
and Southern Lines.


GENERAL VIEW, GREAT ZIGZAG. (See page 62.)


Junction, the Blachtown to Richmond Sub-
sidiary Branch joins the Western Line.
This subsidiary branch, 16 miles in length,
has a north-westerly direction from Black-
town, and has four distinct stations, and one
platform or stopping place. There is a second
Subsidiary Branch in contemplation for a
junction with the Western Line between the
Wallerawang Station and Mudgee. This
subsidiary branch will take a north-westerly
direction from Wallerawang. Besides the
subsidiary line to Eichmond there are tram-
ways that feed the line at intervals—with
shale at Hartley Yale siding, and with coal
at Lithgow. There are cattle truck sidings
at Blayney, and sidings for such like pur-
poses elsewhere.
(2.) The Southern Line has for about
100 miles (from Parramatta Junction to the
neighbourhood of Marulan) a south-south-
westerly direction. Prom Marulan to the
station at Bethungra (about 154 miles) the
general direction of this line is, for the most
part, westerly,with a marked southerly deflec-
tion, first for Yass,and finally towards Wagga
Wagga on the Murrumbidgee, the present
terminus. A railway line has been authorized
from Junee (south-west of Bethungra) to
Narrandera, on the Murrumbidgee, in the
direction of the important inland town of
Hay. On the Southern Line there are,
including Sydney and the present terminus
at Wagga, fifty-nine* stations, and other
occasional stopping places, for the distance
of 304 miles.
(3.) The Great Northern Line (the eastern
terminus of which is at Newcastle, about
60 miles north of Sydney Heads) has, for the
most part, a north-westerly direction, with a
south-westerly deflection between West Mait-
land and Muswellbrook, Its extreme length
from Newcastle to Tamworth is 182 miles.
On this Northern Line there are—including
the termini at Tamworth and at Newcastle
■ —thirty-nine stations and other occasional
stopping places for the extreme distance
traversed. On this Line there is one “Main
Branch’’ —the North-western—starting from
Werri’s Creek, and at present terminating at
Breeza. There are also three Subsidiary
Branches: First, one from Newcastle to
Bullock Island, via Honeysuckle Point, to the
northward, mile; second, one from New-
castle to Wallsend, on the southern side of the
line, 8 miles; and third, one from East Mait-
land to Morpeth, on the north side of the
line, 4 miles. (1.) The first (i.e. Waratah)
subsidiary line is near Newcastle, and is used
chiefly for mineral traffic. (2.) The second
subsidiary branch, (Wallsend Junction), run-
ning south-westerly, commences mile west
of the Waratah Station, and is in length 4 \
miles. The Wallsend branch is principally
used for mineral traffic. (3.) The third sub-
sidiary branch is the Maitland and Morpeth
Branch, which runs from East Maitland to
Morpeth (north-easterly) 4 miles. Including
East Maitland and Morpeth itself, this branch
may be considered to have three stations, or
stopping places, viz: East Maitland, Nor-
thumberland-street, and Morpeth.*
* That is, taking in the trunk line from Sydney
to the Parramatta Junction, common to both of the
Main Branches, the Western and Southern.
* The railway between Newcastle and Tamworth
has been completed, and now the Great Northern Rail-
way measures 182 miles. It has taken over twenty-
three years to make this length. The first span, 17
miles, from Newcastle to East Maitland, was opened
on the sth April, 1857 ; on the 27th July, 1858, a
further length of 2 miles brought the trains to West
Maitland. Seven miles more, or the distance from
West Maitland to Lochinvar were added to the line
open on the 2nd July, 1860; a further length of 8
miles was opened to Branxton on March 24, 1862.
The extension to Singleton, 14 miles, was opened on
the 7th May, 1863 ; and then a long delay occurred,
till, on the 19th May, 1869, 30 miles of extension gave
railway communication to Muswellbrook. The 16
miles between Muswellbrook and Scone were opened
on the 17th April, 1871, and an additional mile to
Wingen on the Ist of August in that year. The open-
ing of the extension from Wingen to Murrurundi, 14
miles, took place on the sth April, 1872, and the next
opening was in 1877, on the 13th August, when 24
miles were added to the length of the railway, and
Quirindi had been reached. And the remaining
length of the contract, the 38 miles between Quirindi
and Tamworth, was declared open for traffic on
Tuesday, the 15th October, 1878.
The total length of railway now open for traffic in
the colony is 7031 miles. No addition of importance is
likely to take place to this length till 1879, when the
41-mile line from Werris’ Creek to Gunnedah will be
opened, if all goes well, on the 30th June. The only
other current contracts are those for the lines from
Orange to Wellington, and Dubbo, a length of 85
miles, and from Wagga Wagga to Albury —a length
of 81 miles. The line to Dubbo is expected to be
opened on the 31st July, 1880, and the line to Albury
on the 31st December of that year. — Herald,

UPPER POINTS, GREAT ZIGZAG.




ROUTES.
ROUTES ON THE WESTERN LINE.
Route No. I—From1 —From Sydney to Bathurst:
145 miles.— ln this route, as on all others,
remember to be at the station from which
you intend to start (especially should it be
the Sydney Terminus) full quarter-of-an-
hour before the train is to leave; more par-
ticularly if you are not alone or have any
luggage. Take the morning train if you
wish to see the varied scenery along the line
on the Blue Mountains* and particularly
that ot the First Zigzag near Emu Plains, and
the Great Zigzag near Lithgow. Dine at
Mount Victoria. You can, by using the
telegraph at the Sydney terminus, order any
dinner to be ready for you at the Mount
Victoria refreshment-rooms—if you like
to incur the expense. It will probably
take you between 8 and 9 hours to get to
Bathurst.
Route No, 2—From Sydney to Orange: 192
miles. — Follow directions for Route No. 1,
except that you should also take a hasty
“ tea ” at the refreshment-room at Bathurst,
and come provided with a rug to sleep in
between Bathurst and Orange. At Orange
there are several excellent hotels. An omni-
bus at the Orange station will convey you
and your luggage to “ The Royal.” There
is now an hotel (Mr. Henna’s) conveniently
close to the Orange station.—Probable time
for your journey by this route—ll hours.
Route No. 3—From Sydney to Lawson (for-
merly Blue Mountain) Station: 58 miles.—
You can go by the morning or evening
train to “The Blue Mountains” (Mr. Henry
Wilson’s place, formerly well known as
“The Old Blue Mountain Inn”). A fine
prospect is visible from the inn itself; and
there is diversified and beautiful scenery
on both sides of the line, within 2 miles
distance either way. On the north side are
Dante’s (Hen, and three waterfalls, each one
of a different character ; and on the south
are the Adelina Falls and other charming
cascades. Excellent roads, fit even for the
restricted exercise of the sick or aged, lead
to the Adelina Falls and to Dante’s Glen.
Mr. H. Wilson’s commodious inn (often
mistaken by travellers for a private residence)
stands about 100 yards west of the station.
If the time of the visitor be limited he can
make this inn his head-quarters, and supple-
ment his excursions by a flying visit to
“ Wentworth Falls,” 4 miles further on. —
Time of journey by this route, 3 hours and a
half.
Route No. 4—From Sydney to Wentworth
Falls (formerly called the Weatherboard
Platform): 62 miles. —Should you desire to
go from Sydney direct to “The Weatherboard
Gorge and the Campbell Cataract ” —a grand
piece of scenery of wondrous wildness and
unrivalled beauty—your better way will be
to drop a line by post to the keeper of the
accommodation house at the “Weather-
board,” Mr. Charles Abraham Wilson; and,
having so arranged for your bed and enter-
tainment, go up by the evening mail train
and sleep. You will arrive at Mr. C. A.
Wilson’s in the evening at about quarter-
past 11 o’clock. But whether you go up in
the morning or in the evening, you must
remember to tell the guard, at the old
Blue Mountain station, to set you down
at “Wentworth Falls,” or you will be car-
ried on to Mount Victoria. The accommo-
dation house, a clean but unpretentious little
place, stands close to where the train stops,
and on the southern side of the line. Having
slept there that night, you can, without
fatigue, visit the Weatherboard Gorge and
Cataract early on the following morning.
* The “ Blue Mountains ” were first crossed by
Europeans in May, 1813, by an adventurous party
consisting of “ Mr. Gregory Blaxland, Mr. William
Wentworth, and Lieutenant Lawson, attended by
four servants, five dogs, and four horses laden with
provisions, ammunition, and other necessaries.” They
appear to have crossed pretty near the present line
of the railroad, previous ineffectual attempts having
been made much further to the southward. They
got back again to the Nepean on the 6th of June,
having apparently got past the Blue Mountains as
far as some of the plains beyond.—See Journal of a
Tour of Discovery, Sfc ,in the year 1813. [The “ Mr.
William Wentworth” here mentioned afterwards
became the celebrated Australian statesman, recentlv
deceased.]


I you return to Mr. C. A. Wilson s in
le, you may also conveniently visit “ The
ater Nymph’s Dell ” on the north side of
3 line. Both of these places are within
niles of the accommodation house, where
* a few pence the services of a youthful
ide can be secured. You can go back to
dney by the “ up ” train from Bathurst
d Orange, which passes the pointsman s
mse at the Weatherboard at an early hour
the afternoon. You may thus be back in
r dney at 6 p.m., and congratulate yourselt
)on having had a short, pleasant and inex-
msive trip. If you start on a Friday
ening, or on a Saturday, you can get a
turn ticket at a reduced rate; and the
larges at Mr. C. A. Wilson’s place are
sasonable. —Time of journey, rather less
lan 4 hours.
Route s—From Sydney to Blackheath (i.e.
Govett’s Leap”) 73 miles— lf you should
esire to pay a hasty visit to the lovely
ad stupendous gorge and waterfall usually
nown by the curiously inexpressive name of
Govett’s Leap ” (and you do not particu-
larly care whether you see any other spot
n the occasion or not) take your place in
he train for Blackheath, and tell the guard
t “The Blue Mountains ” (or Lawson sta-
ion) to put you down at Blackheath. There
s a convenient accommodation house here,
! miles from Govett’s Leap, on the north
ide of the line ; an easy walk, and an easy
vay to find. You had better sleep at the
nn, and return to Sydney on the next day
iy the “up” train ; for Blackheath is only a
siding with a platform, and you may find it
troublesome to be up and ready at the
proper time, so to get to Sydney by the
eight train from Bathurst and Orange. If
you find yourself comfortable at Blackheath,
and time permits, you can ride, drive, or
walk thence to Mount Victoria and back, so
as to see the numerous breaks of scenery to
the southward —away over the Cunimbla
y a lley—to the greatest advantage. But
you will find it too far to visit the Hartley
Yale from this remote stand-point. Time
of journey from Sydney to Blackheath,
about 4 hours and a half.
Route No- 6—From Sydney to Mount
Victoria: 77 miles. —Everything is clear
before you in this route, according to the
lition lists in the Time Tables, until you
five at your destination. Mount Victoria
LI be for you a good bead quarters, trom
iich Govett’s Leap, at Blackheath, may
aveniently be visited, either by driving
to the eastward on the old road in a
ggy, or by riding on a hired horse, or by
dking along near the railway. The
stance from Mount Victoria to Blackheath
only 4 miles, and the old road here is in a
ate of good repair. Near Mount Victoria
ere is much beautiful and attractive
enery. The air, being very bracing and
markably pleasant, is much recommended
r invalids. In the immediate neighbour-
ed of Mount Victoria are found ihe
airy Dell, The Engineer’s Waterfall, ihe
ittle Zigzag (overlooking the northern
art of the Cunimbla _ Valley), Mount
iddington, Mount Piddington s Waterfall
id Dell, and many other picturesque spots.
l rom the back of Mr. John Perry’s hotel,
ast the Protestant Church, the old road
ill take you down into the romantic and
3cluded vale of Hartley, the peculiar
3enery of which will well repay a visit,
'here is at Hartley, near the two churches, a
ecent, old-fashioned, wayside inn, kept by
Jrs. Evans. The little town, or rather
illage, of Hartley, on the borders of the
iver Lett (a tributary of Cox’s Elver) is
[uaint and pretty; and, from the bridge
iver the stream of tlm brawling Lett, an
sxcellently kept road winds north-westerly
ip the valley towards Bowenfels —passing
m its way, under boldly defined and truly
uajestic rocks, known as “Hassan s Wklls.
Mount Victoria has three good hotels
(Mead’s, Perry’s, and Einlay’s), the third
being a very large and handsome inn, just
completed, and called “ The Imperial.’’ If
you make Mount Victoria your head
quarters —as many do —you must set apart
at least a day and a night for your visit to
the Weatherboard Gorge and Campbell
Cataract. You cannot conveniently visit
that most remarkable and beautiful spot
from Mount Victoria. The distance is too
great, and the old road, between Black-
heath and the Weatherboard, has of late,
since its almost total disuse thereabouts,
fallen greatly out of repair. Time of journey
from Sydney to Mount Victoria, about 5
hours.


Route No. 7 —From Sydney to Lithgow
and Bowenfels 96-97 miles. —Starting from
the Sydney Terminus, you can reach the
busy, rising town of Lithgow in six hours;
the train pausing, for a few moments, at the
more established station at Bowenfells about
10 minutes afterwards. If you wish to stop
at Lithgow, be sure to tell the guard at Mount
Yictoriathatyoumustbeput down there,or he
will (mostprobably) takeyou on to Bowenfels.
At Lithgow there are numerous hotels; the
“ Commercial Hotel” (by Richard Blackford)
and Mr. Grey’s inn, being, perhaps, the best
adapted for visitors. These hotels stand
near the Commercial Bank, not far from
where the train at present stops. From
Blackford’s you can make a pleasant 10
miles’ excursion by going right round the
mountain to the westward and south-west-
ward —where (thanks to Mr. Henry Cam-
bridge, the road surveyor, and the energy
and forethought of the Public Works De-
partment) an excellently kept road, past
Hassan’s Walls, will bring you down the
valley to Hartley. Or you can go down to
Hartley by a shorter way (about 6 miles)
right over “ Brown’s Gap ” behind the
easternmost end of Lithgow, up Clyde
Valley. From the last road (a very clever
piece of practical engineering by Mr. Cam-
bridge) there is a grand prospect to the
southward, just as you come down into the
valley from the Gap.—Time of journey, 6
hours.
Note* Weekly Tourists’ Trains.— Once a
week opportunities occur for conveniently
visiting Lithgow and Bowenfels by the
tourists’ trains, which leave Sydney for
Bowenfels on Saturdays at 7'50 a.m., and
return to the Sydney Terminus on the
following Monday morning at an early
hour. This weekly tourists’ train is run at
very cheap rates and will enable persons
from the Sydney side to visit either “ Blue
Mountains” (Lawson), the Weatherboard,
or Blackheath (Govett’s Leap) ; but the ex-
cursionist will have, beforehand, to make
his election as to which of these three places
he will stop at until the return of this train
to Sydney.
* The above will, it is believed, be found to be the
principal routes for tourists, from Sydney down-
wards, on the Main Branch Western Line. Others
may possibly be suggested, when the different
stations and stopping places shall, in their respective
places, come to be particularized.
ROUTES ON THE SOUTHERN LINE.
Route No. B—From Sydney to Goulburn :
134 miles.— ln this route, as on all others,
be sure that you are at the station from
which you intend to start (especially should
it be the Sydney terminus) a full quarter of
an hour before the train is to leave ; more
particularly so if you are not alone or have
any luggage. Take the morning train if
you wish to enjoy the varied scenery along
the line from Sydney to Mittagong. You
had better dine at the last-named place,
which you will reach about four hours after
your train leaves the Sydney terminus. Be
sure that you get into a carriage that is
going to Goulburn, or to some other place
on the “Southern line otherwise, you will
have to look out (sharply) at the Parramatta
Junction , and change into a carriage going
South. The guards—uniformly a civil,
trustworthy, and respectable class of men
—always warn the passengers of every
necessary change, and occasional stopping
place ; but passengers (especially ladies) are
often inattentive, and get “ carried on ” in
consequence —to the annoyance of them-
selves, and the vexation and worry of every-
body else. Goulhurn (a fine, thriving,
inland city, the capital of the south-west,
with plenty of good hotel accommodation)
is a wholesome and pleasant place, one of
the prettiest towns in the Colony, hut rather
cold in the winter season. Provide yourself
therefore with clothing accordingly. Goul-
burn is the centre of a wealthy and impor-
tant district, and lies on the border of rich
and extensive plains. —Time of journey from
Sydney to Goulhurn, 7 hours and a half.

Route No. 10—From Sydney to Campbell-
town: 34 miles.—A cheap and. quiet but
delightful jaunt may be improvised by any
tourist from Sydney to Campbelltown, on the
Southern Line —distant from, the y
terminus only 34 miles. Mind you are
in the right carriage for the Southern Line
when you come to the Parramatta Junction.
There are numerous hotels at Campbelltown.
It is one of the oldest towns in the Colony
and is situated in a bUy, well cleared
agricultural district, celebrated for the salu-
brity of its climate. The scenery, round
Campbelltown is very pretty, especially m
the spring and early summer. Irom it
there are many agreeable rides and drives
in all directions. The roads to Camden and
to Appin, wind, each of them, throug
many charming bits of rural scenery, now,
by the general public, neglected and wc -
nigh forgotten. Nine miles to the north-
westward, near Camden (where, m a com-
manding situation, there is a magnificent
Anglican church, built by the MacArthur
Family), the country will be found highly
cultivated, undulating, and extremely pleas-
ing. Good hotel accommodation at Camden.
The district adjacent to Camden is occupied
by graziers and agriculturists; and there
are also, round it, many dairy farms Close
to that township there is a fine bridge over
the Nepean. At Appin, 9or 10 miles
from Campbelltown, in an opposite direction,
on the Illawarra road, there are two Imtels.
Near this secluded village will be found
much curious river scenery, and (a few
miles south from its two churches), a
singularly wild and rocky pass, adjoining
to which is a deep stream with a dangerous
ford. Time of journey to Gampbelltown
from Sydney, rather better than 1 hour and
a half.
Route No. 11—From Sydney to Menangle,
40 miles. — (See Route No. 8.) —This is a station
on the Southern Line, 6 miles further than
Gampbelltown. It has some characteristic
park-like scenery, the country being more
open than usual in this part of Australia.
Menangle is much visited by Sydney
excursionists, and deserves its popularity
Cultivation and grazing farms on a limited
flat and fertile area. You can go_ to
Menangle from the Sydney Terminus m a
very short time, and return in the evening.
The surrounding country is elevated, and
undulates to the foot of the mountain range
The steep ridge known as Eazorback lies
about 3 miles to the westward The loftiest
neak in the neighbourhood is Mount
Hunter. Time of journey from Sydney to
Menangle, nearly 2 hours.
Route No. 12—From Sydney to Picton;
53 miles. —You can reach Picton by the
train from the Sydney terminus by a short
and pleasant trip. Mind you change your
carriage, if necessary, at the Parramatta
Junction. (See Route No. 8.) If you require
a cheerful rest and a reviving repose lor a
few days, you may secure what you want
by a railway trip to this picturesque village
formerly known as Stouequarry. _
are three hotels here, suitable for visitors.
The viaduct over the Stouequarry River is a
grand piece of masonry. The scenery at
Picton chiefly consists of precipitous hills,
grassy glades, and straggling woods. A
ramble down the winding rock-enclosed
course of the “ Stouequarry” has delighted
and astonished many an artist and man ot
cultivated taste. Near this little township
there is a long tunnel through which the
Southern Line passes on its way towards
Goulburn, Gunning, and Wagga Wagga.
Time of journey from Sydney to Picton,
3 hours.
Route No. 13—From Sydney to Mittagong:
77 miles. — (See Route No. 8). —You can reach
Mittagong from the Sydney Terminus after
a comparatively short and agreeable trajet.
Grand and impressive views in this neigh-
bourhood, at the Gibraltar Pass, and


pleasing scenery at Bowral and at Bong
Bong. Near Bowral (a thriving little
village with a station of its own, about 3
miles from Mittagong) there is a long and
admirably constructed tunnel. Time of
journey from Sydney to Mittagong, about 4
hours.
Route No. 14—From Sydney to Moss Vale:
86 miles. (See Eoute No. 8). — The Sydney
tourist to Moss Yale had better take his
wayside refreshment at the Mittagong
station, and secure such hotel accommo-
dation as he may require here on his arrival.
The scenery round Moss Yale is picturesque.
The village of Sutton Forest, lying on the
Old Bong Bong and Groulburn Road, is a
much admired, healthy spot, often visited by
invalids. There are good accommodation
houses for visitors. Time of journey from
Sydney, rather less than 5 hours.
Note: Weekly Tourist’s Trains.— Once
a week opportunities occur for conveniently
visiting Campbelltown, Menangle, Mitta-
gong, Bowral, and Moss Vale at cheap fares
by the Tourists’ Trains, which leave Sydney
for Moss Yale on Saturdays at 7 a.m., and
return to the Sydney Terminus on the follow-
ing Monday morning, at an early hour. This
train will enable persons from Sydney to visit
either of the five above-mentioned places;
but the excursionist should wisely elect before-
hand as to which of those places he will stop
at, until the return of this train to Sydney.
[The above will, it is believed, be found to
be the principal routes for tourists from
Sydney downwards, on the Main Branch
Southern Line. Others may possibly be
suggested when the different stations and
stopping places shall, in their regular and
consecutive order, come to be particularized.]
ROUTES ON THE SYDNEY TO RICHMOND SUBSIDIARY LINE.
(Connected with the Western Line.)
Route No. 15—From Sydney to The
Hawkesbury, Wiseman’s Ferry, and the
Macdonald River, via Windsor: 100 miles. —
If the Sydney tourist wishes to visit the
Hawkesbury* and the Macdonald Rivers,
at a small expenditure of time and money,
he had better get a railway ticket to
Windsor at the Sydney Terminus some
afternoon—say on a Saturday—and he may
then, about two hours afterwards, find
himself in the pleasant old town of Windsor,
elsewhere described. Three miles from the
Windsor Station stands Pitt Town, to the
vicinity of which the tourist may either
walk or ride on an omnibus. From that
point on the Hawkesbury, so reached, a
small steamer, “ The Telegraph,” starts
every Monday morning at 8 o’clock, and
arrives at the wharf at St. Alban’s on
the Macdonald River, on the afternoon
of the same day at 5 o’clock. If the excur-
sionist, avoiding the numerous sinuosities
of the Hawkesbury, prefers to walk (or
ride) along the road to Wiseman’s Ferry,
* The Hawkesbury (Deerubbun) is remarkable for
its singularly tortuous course. Its basin has three
distinct slopes in the eastern watershed—a southern,
eastern, and western. The main stream comes from
the southern slope, and is first called The Wollon-
dilly. It successively receives the Mulwarree, the
Cookbundoon, the Wingecarribee, the Guinecor Creek,
and the Nattai and Coxe Rivers, and is then called
The Warragamba. When the Cowpasture River has
next contributed its waters, the river becomes known
as The Nepean , a name which it bears until its junction
with the Grose, which flows down into the main river
through a cleft in the Blue Mountains. The river
so constituted is, from that point, known as The
Hawkesbury , a name first bestowed, in order of time
on this stream of many aliases. After receiving the
South Creek at Windsor, and then the Colo and the
Macdonald Rivers, the Mangrove creek and other minor
streams next become its tributaries; the Hawkesbury
finally discharging itself into the Pacific, at Broken
Bay. The entire length of the Hawkesbury is
generally estimated at 330 miles (130 miles longer
than the River Severn, in Great Britain), and it drains a
much disconnected area of about 9,000 miles. Owing
to the immense area drained by the Hawkesbury, and
the flatness of the country in the lower portion of its
stream (but chiefly, perhaps, in consequence of the
confined and winding channel below Windsor, through
which the enormous volume of accumulated waters
cannot always with sufficient velocity be discharged),
the lower course of this river is liable to sudden and
dangerous floods. The Hawkesbury received its name
from the first Governor of this Colony, Captain A.
Phillip, R.N., in honour of Lord Hawkesbury.


he will find his line of transit about half
& dLSSe-fcom 24 to « mto onl^
The scenery, both on the river an
road to the eaat of it, is. for the most part
extremely interesting ; but the
see the Hawkesbury is, of eo V , i
from the river itself. Portland Head and
Sackville Beach are much admired .but a
along the banks of the Hawkesbury, tro
Windsor to Wiseman’s Berry, the frequent
farms and flourishing homesteads give a
cheerful British air to the ever changing
scene. A little way off the road the travel
ler by land—at a place known as stone
Chimney,” about half way will find an
excellen y t stream of water. The ‘ "a
road on which he journeys, having been
joined by the Great Northern Hoad, crosses
Se Hawkesbury near its eeleW con-
fluence with the Macdonald, at a place
called Wiseman’s Ferry. From the Terry
the Northern Eoad stretches away northerly,
through a wild and desolate country to
Wollombi. Two miles before reacbmg the
Hawkesbury the traveller, by land, has
keep along a lofty ridge, which, des °
abruptly to the river, discloses a mos
enchanting prospect. The Hawkesbury,
about a quarter of a mile wide here, sweeps
round in a semicircle; its calm, deep, la
like expanse being enclosed on all sides y
forest-clad, precipitous hills. At W s
Ferry, the traveller —whether he arrives by
the road or in the little steamer-will find
cleared land, an inn, a school-house, and an
old ruined church. The entrance to the
Macdonald Eiver is about a mile or so
below this picturesque but decayed town-
ship The still waters of the little known
“Macdonald” are navigable by small craft
up to the wharf near St. Alban s, about II
miles from the Hawkesbury. The adjacent
levels and banks of the Macdonald are
remarkably fertile and beautiful. St.
Alban’s—the only township in the valley ot
the Macdonald—is secluded and picturesque.
The houses are built on the side of the hills
surrounding this quaint little town, in which
will be found a stone church, stores, a
smithy, and a comfortable inn, knowm as
“ The Settlers’ Arms.” From this con-
venient stand-point an adventurous tourist
might, after crossing the “ Ferry ” pay a
visit (via Snodgrass Yalley) to “ the Man-
o-rove,” in the Brisbane Water district
From the Sydney terminus to Windsor the
distance by rail is 34 miles; from Windsor
to Pitt Town, where the steamer starts on
her riverine voyage, 3 miles; from Pitt
Town to Wiseman’s Ferry (by the windings
of the Hawkesbury) about 50 miles; from
Wiseman’s Ferry to the wharf near St.
Alban’s (on the Macdonald), rather more
than 12 miles. Total distance from Sydney
say 100 miles. The steamer returns from
St Alban’s to Pitt Town almost immediately
after her arrival. This route seems to
suggest the cheapest and most convenient
way for any family or party of friends to
view the grand and ever changing scenery
of the A 7 ale of the Hawkesbury, and of that
of the Macdonald. The scenery on the
Hawkesbury was much admired by t e
celebrated novelist Anthony Trollope, who
considered that it compared favourably with
that of the Rhine. Excursionists from
Svdney and Parramatta can easily reach
Windsor by the train, and be conveyed
thence to where the“ Telegraph lies—usually
at Pitt Town. It would, however, always
be better to write to the master and pro-
prietor of that steamer and obtain his reply,
before any such party is fully organized and
carried out—so as to prevent any possible
disappointments. Time of journey ( y rai )
from Sydney to Windsor, about 2 hours.
Route No. 16—From Sydney to the Kur-
rajong Heights, &c., via Richmond, 41 miles:
—The Svdney tourist intending to visit the
Kurrajong Mountains (a north-easterly olt-
shoot of the Blue Mountains commonly
so-called) will do well to possess himseit
of a ticket at the Sydney Terminus some
fine afternoon, and taking his seat in a rail-
way carriage he may find himself, & °u
two hours and a half afterwards, in ic
mond, a very pretty little country town
elsewhere described. At the Richmon
railway station he can readily hire a com-
modious car, in which he may—tor a tew
shillings—be whirled off, with all due expe-
dition, to one of the many comfortable
accommodation houses to be found near the
top of the Kurrajong. This car, alter
leaving Richmond by the cutting near e
Anglican Church, passes over a wide, dreary,
alluvial flat, at the northern limit of which

flows the Hawkesbury Eiver (just after the
■junction of the “Nepean” with the
“ Grose ”) and here running easter y.
Crossing the river by an excellent bridge
the traveller is first taken past the little
hamlet of Enfield, through some mfies of a
agreeable, undulating country, with home
steads, orange orchards, and far ,’, d
Wheeney Creek, past “ Lamrock s, and
then up the steep mountain side untd he
reaches his destination-Belmore or
wherever else it may be fhat he is de
mined to go. The ascent of the road a±^ e
Wheeney Creek is so sudden tha
alteration of the atmosphere to a more
bracing and healthy climate becomes very
perceptible, and is, moreover strikingly
evidenced by a concurrent change in the
vegetation. Erom the windows of his bed-
room on the following morning the tourist
will find himself looking down upona broad
and partly wooded expanse of Ml '
on the misty plains beyond which the
Hawkesbury I, here and there, to be seen
winding along towards the Pacific,
towns of Eichmond, Windsor Pitt Town
Wilberforce, Castlereagh, and Penrith-are
more or less visible; and even the exact site
of the Metropolis with its wide spread
suburbs and adjacent coast ridge, can be
traced (beyond the blue hills of Parramatta)
in the extreme distance. In fact nearly
the whole of the broad county of Cumber-
land-hemmed in towards the west and
south by far-off shadowy mountains—lies
before the enraptured view of the visitor
the Kurrajong. At the back ol Belmore
Lodge, an abrupt ascent brings the visitor to
a well-known sylvan seat, whence the
prospect of the lower country can be seen
to the greatest advantage. On the summit
of the ridge a pretty sheltered path, trend-
ing easterly, leads through the woods to
the late Mr. Comrie’s residence, from the
grounds of which there is a grand view to the
southward. When staying at the Kurrajong,
the tourist should seize the opportunity of
“the Yale of Avoca”; so called from
the “ meeting of the waters ” of the Grose
with those of a large mountain stream,
umiamed^flowing out’of one of the many
wild ravines of the Kurrajong. _
way to view this lovely landscape is to hire
a horse and guide on the Kurrajong, and so
to make a day of it. The tourist will first
have to descend the mountain as far as
Lamrock’s, and then to turn off and travel
for several miles in a westerly direction.
The Yale of Avoca should be approached
through a gum tree forest, on a gradual
elevation from the southward; so that

ROUTES ON THE NORTHERN LINE.
Route No. 17—From Newcastle to Tam-
worth : 183 miles. —The tourist who leaves
the Newcastle Terminus for Tamworth will
in five hours and three-quarters reach Mur-
rurundi. If he starts by the first train in
the morning he had better take his break-
fast at Singleton, where there is a refresh-
ment-room, and where all passenger trains
stop for fifteen minutes. If he takes his
departure from Newcastle by the 9 o’clock
morning train (passengers and goods) he
may conveniently dine at Singleton (at 135
p.m.) before proceeding to Murrurundi—
wdiich he will, in that case, reach at about
10 minutes past 7 in the evening. He will
find Murrurundi a prosperous inland town,
beautifully situated on the Page River,
which (conjoined with the Isis) forms a
western tributary to the Hunter. Here
there is another refreshment-room at which
the traveller had better take a meal, as he
will not meet wdth another opportunity
before his arrival at Tamworth. Leaving
Murrurundi he has then before him a journey
of 60 miles, and to pass eight stations and
stopping places before he arrives at his
destination. The first of these is Temple
Court Platform, 1 mile from Murrurundi ;
the second, is Doughboy Hollow, a platform
5 miles further on ; the third, Willow Tree
(or Warrah), a station 8 miles further; the
fourth, Braefield Platform, 6 miles further;
the fifth, Quirindi station, 4 miles
further ; the sixth, Quipolly station, 6 miles
further; the seventh, Werris Creek station,
5 miles further; the eighth, Currabubula
station, 9 miles further. 18 miles beyond
Currabubula station stands the present
terminus at Tamworth. Of these stations
and stopping places it may here be re-
marked that Quirindi lies on the northern
slope of the Liverpool Range, 24 miles from
Murrurundi, on the banks of the Quirindi
Creek, an eastern tributary of the Namoi
River. The Line penetrating the Liverpool
Range arrives at Quirindi through a well
formed tunnel 528 yards long, lined with
brickwork set in Portland cement. Tam-
worth stands to the northward from
Quirindi, 38 miles ; and across this inter-
vening space the Great Northern Railway
has just been completed. Breeza is a small
town, west o£ Quirindi 25 miles ; and Wal-
labadah, a pastoral and agricultural settle-
ment, is 16 miles away to the eastward.
Those who intend to visit Armidale, the
capital of New England, usually travel by
this route, via Murrurundi, Quirindi, and
Tamworth. Time of journey from New-
castle to Tamworth 10 hours.
Eoute No. 18—From Newcastle to Murru-
rundi; 120 miles-— Eor directions on leaving
Newcastle for Murrurundi see Eoute No.
17 as to dining at Singleton, &c., &c.
Murrurundi —at an elevation of 1,546 feet
above the sea-level —lies 192 miles north
of Sydney, at the foot of the Liverpool
Eange, 94 miles distant from the nearest
portion of the coast of the Pacific. This
town, which has a population of 400
souls, is the centre of an extensive and
progressive district, principally devoted
to pastoral pursuits, but endowed with a
singularly varied amount of mineral wealth
not yet fully developed. The land is in
many parts of an excellent quality, and,
year by year, as the population becomes
more numerous, agriculture also becomes
more general, and, what is better, is found
to pay well. The local newspaper is the
Murrurundi Times. There is much fine
scenery in this district, especially in the
more elevated portions of it, for the Liver-
pool Eange is a magnificent chain of moun-
tains —from 3,000 to 4,000 (sometimes even
as much as 5,000) feet high—rising, at irre-
gular intervals, into lofty detached peaks,
with rugged cliffs, and traversed by deep
precipitous gorges. Some of these pictur-
esque localities are heavily timbered, and
some are well nigh denuded of vegetation.
Murrurundi Gap is 2,314 feet above the
level of the sea. One of the highest and
most remarkable mountains near Murru-
rundi is Mount Murrulla, 3 miles e.tc.s. of
the township. Mount Murrulla, like Mount
Wingen, is rather connected with the Liver-
pool Eange than an actual part of that
chain, which runs across the country to the
north of both. Mount Wingen, 1,820 feet
high, lying a few miles east of Mount


Murrulla, is perhaps better known The
Burning Mountain,” from the accidental
ignition of a large coal seam beneath it.
The places of note near Murrurundi are as
follows ; — Blachville, a pastoral settlement,
45 miles distant; Blandford, another settle-
ment (agricultural as well as pastoral) on
Page Elver and Warland Creek, 3 miles
south of Murrurundi; and The Willow Tree
or Warrah, the well-known station ot the
Australian Agricultural Company, 15 miles
distant from Murrurundi Raydonton is a
suburb, now connected with Murrurundi
(since 1864) by the “Arnold Bridge
Timor , on the Eiver Isis, is a locality
situated a few miles to the eastward ot
Murrurundi, and chiefly noticeable toi its
caves. “ They present,” we are told, a
series of extensive chambers, the floors of
which are covered with stalagmites, while
stalactites of all ages depend from the ceil-
ings.” Time of journey from Newcastle to
Murrurundi—rather less than 6 hours.
Route No. 19—From Newcastle to Scone:
96 miles— The tourist leaving Newcastle by
rail may,if he pleases, in less than 5 hours find
himself at Scone ; having, en route , had the
option of breakfasting or dining at Single-
ton, according to the train by which he may
have come “ down” the line. (See directions
for Route No. 17.) Scone is rather a pretty
little place, situated on the banks of a
stream oddly called the “ Kingdon londs,
which, with the Darkbrook, forms a western
tributary of the Hunter, falling into that
river about 9 miles above the township of
Aberdeen. Scone, at an elevation of 680
feet above the sea-level, is reckoned to be
167 miles north of Sydney by the postal
route. It has a population of 600 souls.
It lies 7 miles west of Page Eiver, and 7
miles north-west of the Hunter. The coun-
try round Scone is mountainous, the adja-
cent district being chiefly occupied for pas-
toral purposes. Near the township is a
plain, on which are found quantities of fossil
wood; the rooted trunks of large fossil
trees, standing in the ground, as if still in
their places of growth. Besides Aberdeen,
above-mentioned, the principal places near
Scone are Bunnan and Eonchelbrook. In
the mountains and highland glens near
Scone there is much wild and picturesque
scenery. A beautiful spot there, called
“ Elat Rock,” is spoken of as well deserving
of a visit. Time of journey from Newcastle
to Scone—4f hours.
Route No. 20—From Newcastle to Muscle-
brook: 80 miles— (Eor directions as to place
of stopping for breakfast or dinner on this
journey see Route No. 17.) The traveller
by rail from Newcastle to Musclebrook (or
Muswellbrook) arrives at his destination in
about 4 hours after leaving the Newcastle
Terminus. Musclebrook (475 feet above the
sea-level) lies on the margin of the Muscle-
brook and the Hunter, that river skirting
the township on its western side. It is, by
postal route, 152 miles north of Sydney, and
contains about 1,500 inhabitants. There is
a very handsome Anglican Church here,
noteworthy as being one of the finest eccle-
siastical edifices at present erected in the
northern portion of the colony. The visitor
should go and see it, especially the interior.
The country around Musclebrook is favour-
able to the growth of wheat, maize, sugar,
tobacco, and the vine. Denman is a small
town, lying 16 miles south of Musclebrook,
about 2 miles above the confluence of the
Goulburn and Hunter Rivers, on the main
road from Maitland to Merriwa, Cassihs,
and Mudgee. The other settlements in the
neighbourhood of Musclebrook are Gooran-
goola, Grass Tree, Gungal, Kayuga, and
Wybong. Time of journey from Newcastle
to Musclebrook, nearly 4 hours.
Route No. 21—From Newcastle to Single-
ton: 49 miles. —Singleton, the centre of the
rich and flourishing district of Patrick s
Plains, is an agreeable well-planned country
town, on the Hunter River, 123 miles north
of Sydney by the postal route. He finds
the station 135 feet above the sea-level.
Here there is a good refreshment-room, and
trains carrying passengers stop 15 minutes.
Singleton is a wealthy thriving place, with
comfortable inns, several churches, and other
handsome public edifices. The Court House
is one of the finest buildings of the kind in
the Colony. The town (which has a good
local newspaper) contains over 1,200 inhabi-
tants. The district, in which Singleton
holds the chief place, has many advantages
for pastoral and agricultural pursuits.
Large quantities of good wine have been


produced, and copper, iron, freestone, and
limestone are found in the adjacent country.
Jerry's Plains is a township on the Hunter,
19 miles west of Singleton, on the road from
Singleton to Cassilis. Coal abounds in its
neighbourhood, and other valuable mineral
deposits. The remaining noticeable settle-
ments near Singleton are : —Belford (on the
Line 10 miles south-east from Singleton),
Bridgeman, Camberwell, Glendon Brook,
Howe’s Valley, Ravensworth, Scott’s Elat,
Sedgefield, St. Clair, Vere, Warkworth, and
Westbrook. Time of journey from New-
castle to Singleton, about 2\ hours.
Route No. 22—From Newcastle to West
Maitland : 20 miles. —Maitland (by many once
not unfairly ranked next after the capital of
the Colony, for its wealth and importance)
is divided into East Maitland and West
Maitland by Wallis Creek, over which there
is an excellent bridge. East Maitland was
the original Government township; but when
“ Maitland” is now spoken of West Maitland
is generally meant—it being, of the two, by
far the largest and most important place.
“ Maitland” lies low; only 124 feet above
the sea-level. Maitland is 12 miles south
of Paterson, the chief town of the Paterson
District. Maitland is also reckoned to be
95 miles from Sydney, by tbe ordinary postal
route ; 20 miles by rail from the Newcastle
Terminus, 19 miles from Singleton, 30 miles
from Cooranbong, 60 miles from Muscle-
brook, 100 miles from Murrurundi, and 124
miles from Quirindi. West Maitland con-
tains several good hotels, and fine public
buildings ; with many commodious churches
and schools. The population of West Mait-
land, in 1871, was over 5,000 souls, but it is
now probably much greater. The townships,
villages, and settlements, near East and
West Maitland, are : Anvil Creek, Bishop’s
Bridge, Branxton, Buchanan, Creswick,
Elderslie, Earley, Greta (late Farthing’s),
Hinton, Largs, Lochinvar, Morpeth, Mount
Vincent, Rothbury,and Woodville. Of these,
Lochinvar, Greta, and Branxton are stopping
places on the Great Northern Railway, to
the west of Maitland; and Morpeth is to
the north-eastward, at a distance of 6 miles.
Morpeth is the head of the navigation of the
Hunter River, and steamers constantly ply
between it and Sydney, by means of which
towns and settlements* on the Williams and
Paterson rivers (and their affluents) may
perhaps he most conveniently visited.
Route No- 23 — From Newcastle to East
Maitland : 18 miles- —East Maitland station
—reached by the railway traveller, after a
trip of rather less than 1 hour’s duration
—is situated in a pleasant spot, with rising
ground near it; the station itself being not
more than 18 feet above the sea-level. East
Maitland is considered to be one of the best
laid out towns in the Colony, and when the
numerous trees, so judiciously planted, shall
have grown up, it will be one of the most
picturesque. In its wide and well kept
streets there are many excellent and sub-
stantial buildings, churches, banks, hotels,
and shops. The Government gaol and the
adjacent court-house are both fine and com-
modious buildings, standing on a gentle
eminence, to the north-east of the township.
The population of East Maitland, in 1871,
was 1,675 persons; but of late it has been
reasonably estimated at considerably over
2,000. Courts of Quarter Sessions and
Circuit Courts are held here. You can go
from East Maitland direct , by the Subsidiary
Line, which starts from here to Morpeth.
Near East Maitland (to the eastward) are
Morpeth, Wickham, Woodford, and Hinton.
Time of journey about 55 minutes.
Route No- 24—From Newcastle to Waratah,
4 miles- —Waratah is a busy thriving town-
ship, only 4 miles west of Newcastle, and
not more than 13 feet above high water
mark. It is said to have a population of
about 3,000 souls, the principal industries
being coal-mining, stone-quarrying, and
copper-smelting. Coal is shipped from
shoots into vessels lying in the lower waters
of the Hunter at Point Waratah. At the
distance of about miles west of Waratah
the Wallsend Subsidary Line joins on to the
Great Northern Railway. There is no parti-
cular beauty in any of the surroundings of
Waratah, but it is outside of the “ great coal
city” into something like the country, and
* Such as Raymond Terrace, Miller’s Forest,
Seaham, Tomago, and Williams Town, on The
Williams; and Paterson, Clarence Town, Dungog,
Campsie, Eccleston, Q-resford, Yacy, Lewinsbrook,
and Lostock, on The Paterson.


the place is consequently a favourite resort
to the citizens of Newcastle, from which it
lies about 10 minutes’ distance, by rail.
Besides Waratah the places near Newcastle
are Stockton, Honeysuckle Point, Hamilton,
Xiambtoii, Minini, New Xiambtoß, Plattsburg,
Wallsend, Brookstown, Hexham , Alnwick,
Adamstown, Charlestown, Oneygamba, and
Tighe’s Hill. Wallsend and Hexham are
connected (by rail) with the terminus at
Newcastle. Time of journey from New-
castle—from 15 to 25 minutes.
ROUTES OF SUBSIDIARY LINES TO NORTHERN LINE.
There are three Subsidiary Lines to the
Northern Line, but they are not of such
length and importance as the Subsidiary
Line from Blacktown to Richmond, or the
proposed line from Wallerawang to Mudgee.
1. The first of these is the Subsidiary Line
from Newcastle to Bullock Island; lia mile.
This joins the main line at Honeysuckle
Point, just outside Newcastle. It is not much
used for passengers, but is of great utility
for the conveyance of coal and other mineral
products. 2. The second of these Subsidiary
Lines, to the Great Northern Line, runs
from Newcastle (westerly) to Wallsend —a
distance of 8 miles. There is a morning and
afternoon train every day (including
Sundays) and the trajet is made in So
minutes. The trains between Newcastle and
Wallsend call, either way, at Waratah (at
Hamilton only if required) and at Honey-
suckle Point. Wallsend, the terminus of
this Subsidiary Line, is a busy, rising, incor-
porated town, with adjacent collieries. It
already numbers at least 5,000 inhabitants.
Wallsend is 20 miles north-east of Cooran-
bong, by which, after a journey of 32 miles
to the southward, Gosford, the pretty chief
township of Brisbane Water, may con-
veniently be reached. There is a good road,
and the telegraph line runs along the same,
all the way. Cooranbong can also be reached
by a road southerly from Maitland. 3. The
third Subsidiary Line—that from East Mait-
land to Morpeth—is, in its extreme length,
4 miles long. There are several trains on it
every day (including Sundays) and the trajet
is made in half an hour. The trains between
East Maitland and Morpeth call at Northum-
berland-street, which is the only intermediate
stopping place on the line. This Subsidiary
Line is one of great practical use to the in-
habitants of the towns it connects ; especially
when it is remembered that Morpeth is the
head of the navigation of the Hunter River.
ROUTE OF MAIN BRANCH NORTH-WESTERN LINE.
There has recently been opened a short
extension of this line from Werris Creek to
Breeza, 15 miles, which is to be continued on
to Gunnedah. The works on the extension
are in a forward state, and in a few months
the line will be opened to the latter town.

ITINERARY AND DESCRIPTIONS OF SCENERY.
RAILWAY ITINERARY-STATIONS AND PLATFORMS, &c WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF
SCENERY.
I.—SYDNEY TO PARRAMATTA JUNCTION.
(WESTERN MAIN TRUNK LINE.)
N.B.—“ Suburban Trains” to the Town of Parramatta, i mile beyond the Parramatta Junction to the N.W.
Eveleigh Platform, 1 mile; 70 feet above
sea-level.— Eveleigh Platform, only a short
distance to the left, beyond the Redfern
Railway Tunnel, is reckoned a mile from
the Sydney Terminus. Short as this dis-
tance js, by rail , this platform is found to
be very convenient for persons residing at
Alexandria, Redfern, and Waterloo. As
the passenger leaves the Sydney Terminus
he may have a good view of three handsome
stone edifices near the line —the Railway
Mortuary Station, with the Wesley Church,
to the right; and St. Paul’s Anglican Church
and Tower to the left. Many “ Suburban
trains ” —such as can, between Sydney and
Parramatta, readily stop (if specially re-
quiredT) at a “platform” like Eveleigh —pass
by during the day.
McDonald Town Platform, 11 mile; 80 feet
above sea-level. —Having passed “Eveleigh,”
the passenger by the train has, at once, to
the left, a fine prospect of Botany Bay in
the distance ; across a level, open, country,
with the church and village of St. Peter’s
on elevated ground to the westward. On
the right of the Line can now be seen
the grand architectural outlines of the Syd-
ney University—to the west of which (on
the ridge of the hill, close to Newtown)
stands the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Asylum —
a curious red brick building, in marked con-
trast to its more pretentious neighbour.
The “ McDonald Town Platform” is placed
at a siding, just where the railroad winds to
the right, before it enters Newtown.
Newtown Station, 2 miles; 96 feet above the
sea-level. —The Railroad, ascending gradually
from the Terminus, now runs under a bridge
and through the pleasant suburban township
of Newtown. Emerging from the shadow
of a second bridge, the traveller usually finds
that the train halts for a few moments at th
Newtown Station ; close to a pretty G-othic
church erected by the Homan Catholic
communion. Appointed time for train to
reach the Newtown Station after leaving
the Sydney Terminus, about 6 minutes.
Stanmore Platform, miles; about 100
feet above sea-level. —This Platform stands
about half-way between Newtown and Peter-
sham Stations, and is for the convenience of
the residents of the hamlet of Stanmore.
Petersham Station, 3 miles ; 100 feet above
sea-level. —Having left Newtown the traveller
by the train is pleased to observe an excel-
lent and comprehensive view stretching
away to the northward—to the heights of
the picturesque suburban hamlet of Balmain,
the church towers and houses of which
here first become plainly visible. Beyond
Balmain the North Shore hills extend in the
extreme distance. On the southern side of
the line, houses, villas, gardens, and slowly
developing streets are successively presented;
where (not long since) there was nothing but
open country, or shady“bush,” Thefirstclump
of forest trees, yet undisturbed, on the old
Annandale Estate, next shows itself on the
right, and is, of course, the object of much
curious speculationto European visitors, unac-
customed to the rather stiff and formal euca-
lyptus. On approaching Petersham Station a
fine view over the country unfolds itself to
the right—the celebrated “Blue Mountains”
becoming visible far away to the westward.
Petersham Station is now the centre of a
thickly populated suburban district, and on
the slopes around it are many really delightful
villas and gardens. Usual time of trajet
from Sydney to Petersham, about 12 minutes.
Ashfield Station, 5 miles; 86 feet above sea-
level.—Quitting the Petersham Station the
railroad forawhile traverses a rolling country,
numerously inhabited. The burial-ground


I, Eoman Catholic Church of St. Mary and
Joseph then stand together for a moment
i,r the advancing train to the rig it , anc,
B r that, the old (and somewhat decayed)
age of Petersham comes directly in view,
vn in the hollow, lying on the side ot the
rramatta Eoad. The course of the tram
ncrg the tourist next, somewhat abruptly,
a°viaduct over Long Cove Creek, a stream
tick flows along the bottom of the gorge,
wn which—away towards the Parramatta
ver— is suddenly disclosed a long vist „ a °
cturesque woods. The slender spue o •
avid’s Presbyterian Church is seen amongst
e trees to the north-west in the mid dis-
nce. Away to the left are woods much
jarer to the Line, and then the southern
l.re of the old Ashfield Eacecourse is gained,
ith the old Southern Eoad from Sydney on
ie right hand; and so,passing under a bridge
id through a deep cutting between houses,
ichards, and gardens, the tram at last comes
iundering into the pretty village of Ashfield.
ime between the Sydney and Ashfield Sta-
ons, about 18 minutes—sometimes less.
Croydon Platform, 6 miles; 86 feet above sea-
ivel.—The railway passenger, on leaving Ash-
eld Station, is now (for about a mile) hurried
last an agreeable bit of home scenery; diver-
ified by gardens and trees, with a wide, un-
wen space on either side ot the road in the
lack ground, where Nature has not yet been
■uthlessly improved away. Streets (tor t e
nost part mere lanes) intersect this tract,
vhereon stand villas and gardens belonging
to Sydney people, displaying a considerable
imount of domestic comfort, originality, and
even elegance of design. Yistas of pleasant
country roadwavs—green, and as yet inno-
cent of dust and mire—stretch up the gentle
eminences to the left and right; and then the
sombre eucalyptus, intervening market gar-
dens, and rural homesteads, successively meet
the eye before the train reaches Croydon
Platform. Here the train (if suburban) may
possibly stop for a moment, but probably
speeds onward unchecked to Burwood.
Burwood Station, 7 miles; 68 feet above sea-
level—After passing Croydon Platform, the
railway traveller will at first only see a
continuation of such scenery as he has been
observing between Ashfield and Croydon.
Nevertheless (just before he arrives at the
prosperous village of Burwood) he may catch
a passing view of the Congregational Church
to the right, near the Burwood station; and
he may like’wise-beyond that pretty Me
ecclesiastical edifice-observe the Anglican
Church on the Parramatta Road, with a good
view of Balmain and the North Shore hills in
the distance. To the left he wdl doubtless
notice another handsome Anglican Church
(with an adjacent school-house) on Burwood
heights; also more bush scenes, presenting
a series of gardens and woodland glades.
Near Burwood, on the Line, he may likewise
get a hasty glimpse to the north-west of the
hill country near Parramatta. Appointed
time from Sydney to Burwood, usually about
24 minutes.
Redmyre Platform, 71 miles; 60 feet above
sea-level— A half mile beyond Burwood, to
the westward, is a platform named Redmyre,
for the convenience of residents in the adja-
cent houses and villas.
Homebush Station, 8 miles; 32 feet above
sea-level.—Between Burwood and Home-
bush there is a considerable descent on the
Line, amounting to not less than 36 feet.
After passing the Redmyre Platform the
railway traveller has a distant view of the
country to the north-west, across an open range
of forest. The hills beyond Parramatta now
more plainly appear; and there is also an unex-
pected prospect of the long settled country
about Ryde across the Parramatta River.
The tops of the Blue Mountains are again
visible to the westward. On the right the
traveller (if a sporting man) may observe, with
some interest, the old Homebush Racecourse
—which, before the establishment ot liand-
wicJc, was the one great arena for race-horses,
jockeys, and bookmakers. Leaving Homebush,
the Railroad passes through an uninteresting
piece of bush country, in which the (so-
called) Tea Tree Scrub seems to be the prin-
cipal feature. Appointed time from Sydney
to Homebush, about 29 minutes.
Rookwood Station, 10 miles; 55 feet above
sea-level.— BetweenHomebush and Rookwood
Station —a distance of 2 miles the country
adjacent to the Railroad is of a dreary
character, somewhat suitable to the locality
approached —the great Metropolitan Ceme-
tery, or Necropolis, at Haslem s Creek.
People here look out of the carriage windows,
with lengthened faces, at that melan-
choly waste, where long rows of graves are


but partially relieved by trees and shrubs.
The ground, however, has only a few years
been dedicated to its object; and every
effort is made to render it not merely
interesting but tasteful. The buildings
connected with this cemetery are really
handsome edifices —the Mortuary House, or
Station, at the end of the siding on the
ground particularly so. The Jewish Burial-
ground adjoins that appropriated to all the
various denominations of Christians, who
here sleep peacefully together. This station
was once known as “ Haslem’s Creek,” but it
has recently assumed the name of “ Eookwood’ ’
•—a name borrowed, it would appear, from
Harrison Ainsworth’s well-known “ deadly-
lively” romance. The trains reach Eookwood
from Sydney in half an hour. Funeral trains
stop at Eookwood, and are shunted into the
cemetery siding—which is about a quarter
of a mile long.
Auburn Platform, 12 miles; about 40 feet
above sea-level. —“ Auburn,” if not a pretty
name for an ugly place, cannot certainly be
said fitly to designate the “ loveliest village of
the plain.” It is only a platform (2 miles on
the Line west of Eookwood) where there is
little or nothing to see. There is some
sloping ground a considerable way to the left;
a deep cutting or two, low scrubby trees with
brushwood, and then a barren country. The
Eailroad continues to descend tow r ardsalower
level at the Parramatta Junction.
Parramatta Junction Station, 13 miles;
32 feet above sea-level. After passing
Auburn the train approaches Duck Eiver,
with an adjacent tweed factory. An unin-
teresting barren bit of country follows, and
then the Parramatta Junction is reached.
This Junction is 1 mile from the Parramatta
Station, and is a place which owes its exis-
tence to the railways. There the Southern
Main Branch joins the Western Trunk Line;
the Trunk Line itself turning to the N.W.,
to go through the old town of Parramatta.
The suburban trains go past the Junction
into the town of Parramatta, and stop there;
but in all other trains there is a change here
for passengers or goods destined to go south.
The suburban trains, of course, travel more
slowly than the other trains, but the usual
time for the journey between Sydney and
the Parramatta Junction is reckoned to be
rather more than half an hour.
II.—PARRAMATTA TO ORANGE—THE WESTERN LINE.
Parramatta.
Parramatta Station, 14 miles; 49 feet above
sea-level.— The traveller proceeding from the
Parramatta Junction to the Parramatta
Station, first (by a sharp turn and a deep
cutting) passes through a short hilly piece
of bush country, and then he has before him
a charming view of Parramatta, with its
many fine churches and other public build-
ings. To the north of the town stand
numerous hills, of no great elevation, but
which are pleasing to the eye—wearied, as
it naturally is, by the monotonous wilderness
recently traversed by the train after passing
Homebush. Parramatta* (originally called
“Rose Hill”), situated at the head of the
navigation of Parramatta River, communi-
cating directly with the waters of Port
Jackson, is one of the oldest towns in the
colony. Indeed it was once, by all accounts,
and curiously enough, intended for the
capital, or at least the chief seat of Govern-
ment ; in proof of which it is alleged that
St. John’s Church was (somewhat preten-
tiously for those early days) built with its
two towers exactly copied from the
“ Reculvers ” in Kent—to serve for a Cathe-
dral. For many years the Governors con-
tinued to reside here, and the town flourished
as the second place in the colony. Then, for
an interval, it not only made no progress,
but actually appeared to be hastening to
utter decay. The Railway, however (which
is said to have destroyed some of the old
inland towns) has most certainly given an
invigorating impetus to the existence of
Parramatta; for it is now, year by year,
* Parramatta is connected with Sydney by
steamers, plying to and fro daily on the Parramatta
River. By these steamers Subiaco, Newington,
Ermington, Kissing Point or Ryde, Gladcsville, Yilla
Maria, Hunter’s Hill, Biloela, Fitzroy Dock, and other
places on the said river (or rather estuary) maybe most
conveniently reached. A bridge across the Parramatta
River is now in the course of erection near Ryde.


MR. C. MOORE’S MOUNTAIN RESIDENCE.


extending, and becoming more and more a
distant suburb (as it were) of our sea-side
Metropolis. Some fine houses have now
been built near the Railway Station. The
present population of Parramatta is over
7,000 souls. It supports two good local
newspapers (“ The Cumberland Mercury ,”
and “ The Cumberland Times ”). There are
numerous Government and charitable insti-
tutions at Parramatta, such as the Gaol,
the Orphan Schools, the Lunatic and
Benevolent Asylums, &c., &c. There are
several good hotels. There are also in
Parramatta a Free Public Library, a
flourishing Mechanics’ Institute, three Pub-
lic Schools, and six churches. The King’s
School, near Parramatta Bridge, was long
the only grammar school in the colony, and
is still a most useful scholastic institution ;
revived of late years by the Rev. G. F.
Macarthur. The old Government Domain
is now utilized as a beautiful park, belong-
ing to the townspeople. Parramatta has
been an incorporated municipality since the
year 1861. The villages and places which
are more or less connected with this town
are —Castle Hill, Dural, Enfield, Field of
Mars, Gannon’s Forest, Guildford, Hornsby,
Liberty Plains, Pennant Hills, and Prospect.
Seven Hills Station, 20miles; 113 feet above
sea-level. After leaving the Parramatta
Station the traveller in the “down train” (that
is the train proceeding to the westward)
passes over a viaduct, and along an embank-
ment, from which there is a fine view of the
town and of the neighbouring country to the
north of it. The picturesque old Georgian
brick Parsonage may then be noticed,’yet
standing on the hills to the left; whilst
nearer still, lying only a few yards from the
Railroad, the old Burial Ground claims a
passing glance, as the resting-place of
that well beloved “ stainless patriot ” Robert
Campbell, and of other historical celebrities.
Further on, and to the right, a glimpse is
next caught of the ci-devant Government
House, with the adjacent undulating glades,
gardens, and shrubberies, of the Public Park
scenes ot many a gay and festive event,
and of some very sorrowful ones—the oaks,
pines, and other choice trees, reviving pleas-
ing recollections of a distant fatherland.
Then comes a deep cutting, and the train
sweeps past the site formerly occupied as
the show place of the Australian Agricul-
tural Association—when the yearly exhi-
bitions of that body were more local than
national; chiefly confined to ploughing
matches, and manifestations of cattle,
horses, sheep, fowls, and dogs, and farmers’
machinery. The country now becomes
much more interesting, frequent orange
groves of dark green foliage, decked with
“ the golden fruit of the gardens of the
Hesperides,” imparting a new and delightful
charm to the beauty of an ever-changing
landscape. Well grassed apple-tree flats,
with undulating and more open country, and
farm-houses, gardens, and cottages succeed ;
until after a run of 6 miles the train stops
for a moment, at the quiet little rural station
of Seven Hills—a locality once, by early
colonists (less ambitiously, and, after a comical
outburst of vice-regal impatience, rather
facetiously) designated as “ Nowhere,”
Blacktown Station and Junction, 22 miles;
183 feet above sea-level. —Two miles from the
Seven Hills Station (through a somewhat
uninteresting but useful country) stands
the station of Blacktown ; a locality owing
its name to an institution which was unavail -
ingly formed here many years ago by
Governor Macquarie, for the education and
civilization of the aborigines. In the
country between Seven Hills and Blacktown,
on either side of the road, numerous herds
of cattle and flocks of sheep are usually to
be seen, browsing in serene and blissful
unconsciousness of their approaching fate ;
as though abattoirs were things that had no
possible existence, and metropolitan butchers
and their hungry city customers were
nothing but nonentities. As you come
along pretty bits of scenery may here and
there be_ observed ; open, partially wooded
hills—with occasional signs of cultivation,
farms,_ ponds, orchards, and flats—appear to
the right, and orange groves and pretty
country residences are unfolded to the left.
There is, however, nothing here calling for
particular remark ; except, perhaps a quaint
and unexpected piece of the Old Western
Road, with its broken-down wayside inn,
visible for just a moment, before the railroad
turns abruptly away to the right, so bring-
ing the railway traveller to the Blacktown


Station. At Blacktown there is a miniature
terminus for the Richmond and Sydney Sub-
sidiary Branch, which here joins on to
the Western Trunk Line. Blacktown is a
small, and by no means attractive place,
chiefly depending on the railway, with two
or three stores and inns of a humble and un-
important character. As tbe train approaches
the Blacktown Station you first catcb sight
of a distant and limited view of the far-
famed Blue Mountains.
Rooty Hill Station, 25 miles; 131 feet above
sea-level- —After leaving the Blacktown sta-
tion a lovely view of the Blue Mountains is
disclosed to the right, peeping over the trees
across aflat and uninteresting country. This
tract, immediately adjoining the Line, is but
partially wooded, huts and cottages appearing
occasionally, some withholdings and gardens,
and some without. Before Booty Hill is
reached (after an interval of 3 miles) there
is a grand outline prospect of tbe Blue
Mountains to the westward, across an open
country, with the seat of Walter Lamb, Esq.,
in the distance. Large quantities of firewood
are hence despatched to Sydney.
South Creek Station, 29 miles; 113 feet above
sea-level- —The country on either side of the
Eailroad, after it passes by the Booty Hill
Station to the westward is, for the most
part, open, flat, and poor. Here and
there the line passes through the bush,
but there are not many trees near it.
Before arriving at the South Creek Station
(which is 18 feet lower than Booty
Hill), the traveller may get another fine
view of the Blue Mountain Eange, which
he is now approaching. South Creek Station
is about 4 miles west of Booty Hill, and
about half a mile away to the north of St.
Mary’s, South Creek—an old, pleasant, and
prosperous village, on the Sydney and Penrith
Eoad, chiefly dependent upon agricultural
and grazing pursuits. Dairy farming, and
wine making are here also carried on. Large
supplies of timber and firewood are likewise
cut here, and forwarded by the line to Sydney
for use on the Eailway and for sale. The
Messrs. Saddington and Sons have a large
tannery at this place. There is a new inn
and a telegraph office near the South Creek
Station. The new inn (a large and com-
modious one), called “ Shanes’ Park Hotel,”
is kept by Mrs. Ellen Darcy. It stands
opposite to tbe station, and is built of adobe,
with a zinc roof. South Creek takes its
name from a considerable tributary to tbe
river Hawkesbury, into which it eventually
flows near Windsor.
Parkes Platform, 31 miles ; about 100 feet
above sea-level.— After passing by the South
Creek station, a fine view of the Great
Western Highlands is gained to the right ot
the Line and to the westward. There is then
a flat partially wooded country for 2 miles
until you arrive at the Parkes Platform and
Siding, 3 miles from Penrith.
Penrith Station, 34 miles; 88 feet above sea-
level. —Penrith, 12 miles west of Blacktown, is
a quaint old inland township, the last Station
reached by travellers in the so-called “down”
trains before they begin to ascend the Blue
Mountains. In the “ coaching and bullock-
driving days”—when the neighbouring river
had to be crossed by vehicles in a punt Pen-
rith was a very bustling and flourishing place,
and it appears sufficiently prosperous at
present —certainly far from going back. It
is surrounded by broad pasture lands, and
alluvial plains, of a vast extent and singular
fertility ; bounded, westerly, by the river
Nepean, soon to assume the .better known
name of the Hawkesbury. The town itself
is a municipality, with ratable property
reported to be of upwards of £120,000 value;
the population of the township being over
1,200, with 45 miles of streets, roads, and
lanes. There are four churches belonging
respectively to the Protestant Episcopalian,
Eoman Catholic, Presbyterian, and Wesleyan
Communions. The course of the Nepean runs
parallel to the town, at the distance of about
a mile from the Station, where it is crossed
by a boldly designed and admirably con-
structed Iron Tubular Bridge —supported by
four huge piers of solid masonry, the two
centre ones being 58 by 17|- feet at their
foundation, with an extreme height of 59 feet.
These piers are 186 feet apart. Altogether,
it is one of the finest works of the kind in
the colony, and of itself worth going to Pen-
rith to see. (See view of Nepean Bridge.)
5 miles to the south of the town the Elver
flows down northerly through a tremendous
gap in the hills ; and, the heights on either


BRIDGE OVER THE NEPEAN, PENRITH. (Seepage 32.)
c


side being well wooded, many charming effects
are produced. There are two or three good
inns, one of these hotels being not far from
the station. Penrith is the polling-place for
the Nepean Electorate. The places near
Penrith (besides those already mentioned as
having been traversed by the Line), are Mul-
goa, Greendale, Luddenham, Bringelly,
Castlereagh, and Emu.
Emu Plains Station, 36 miles; 87 feet above
sea-level.— The attention of the traveller by the
train leaving Penrith for the mountains must
(even previous to his arrival at the Tubular
Bridge over the Nepean) be agreeably occu-
pied with the scenery before him to the
westward ; where he observes verdant plains,
fringed in the distance by the winding edge
of a rolling country, the grassy knolls of
which are pleasingly dotted here_ and there
with clumps of trees. Beyond this charming
picture the majestic “ Blue Mountains ” rise
abruptly, like a vast natural fortification,
overgrown, almost everywhere, with sombre
foliage, and extending for many miles from
the south to the north towards Castlereagh,
their base being washed by the Nepean. (See
view of the Nepean—evening.) Along the
broken face of this grand barrier, not cerulean
here but dark, green, and grey, the Bailway
Line may be seen winding upwards—past
huge rocks and steep declivities, alternating
with dense woods ; the noble viaduct across
Knapsack Gully being hence already distin-
guishable. The train sweeps noisily over
the Tubular Bridge above described; crosses
a rich alluvial plain beyond the river and
under cultivation —where grain, fruit, and
vegetables appear to be the chief products
and at the distance of 2 miles from Penrith,
quickly reaches the Emu Plains Station,
where the first ridge of the mountain begins.
This Station commands a comprehensive
view of the Eirst Zigzag, by _ means of
which the heights of Lapstone Hill are to be
gained and passed. The immediate neigh-
bourhood of the Emu Plains Station (having
been successfully occupied as an agricul-
tural settlement from the earliest days of
the Colony) presents many pretty rural
pictures of gardens, orchards, corn fields,
homesteads, and villages—assimulating, in
many of its features, to portions of moorland
scenery in the west of England,
Lucasville Platform, 39 miles; about 700
feet above sea-level— Lucasville Platform —
standing on the upper edge of the eastern
face of the Blue Mountains, where the line
turns off to the westward —is merely a soli-
tary spot at which the train stops when
signalled for; hut between it and the Emu
Pfains Station beneath there is a shitting
series of panoramic views of all the Lowland
Country in tho county of Cumberland, such
as for extent and beauty can hardly he sur-
passed. As you leave the Emu Plains Station
and begin gradually to ascend the steep
incline —away to the south towards Mulgoa,
G-reendale, and Luddenham your eyes can
first feast themselves for a moment on that
fair prospect in mid distance the already
mentioned Glorge of the Nepean. Then, a
few yards further on, as the train rises more
slowly towards the Eirst Z igzag, yon are carried
past trees and woodland scenery to the left,
with a deep gully (or “ghyll,” as Wordsworth
would have termed it) to the right; after
which, “as from the stroke of an enchanter’s
wand,” a wide and magnificent expanse of
level country, stretching away far below,
bursts, in all its unexpected glory, upon your
dazzled sight. In this great range of open
plains —the extreme limits of which are faintly
defined by the ethereal outlines of the light
blue hills on the coast —the town of Penrith
(at the distance of 4 or 5 miles) is_ displayed
to the greatest advantage, with its public
buildings and churches on the other side of
the Nepean. The winding course of this
truly Eoyal Stream, stretching for miles and
miles like a broad blue “ garter ribbon,” is
seen traversing the westerly portion of this
unequalled campaign, the land near to its
banks being, for the most part, treeless;
although a long thick belt of forest land-
more or less enveloped in hazy atmospheric
tints of grey, cobalt, or purple—is visible
beyond the plains. All the nearer portion
of the Lowlands is either cultivated or laid
out in bright verdant pastures, especially
round about Penrith, along the Nepean, and
to the north-eastward; the open country
being dotted here and there with villages,
farms, homesteads, and orangeries—and in-
tersected by narrow roads and picturesque
remnants of forest. As you continue to rise,
and shift from slope to slope of the “ Zigzag,”
the prospect before you is more and more


displayed,—back to the south-east, towards
Camden, and directly to the southward,
whence the Nepean flows placidly down, from
the junction of the Cowpasture and Warra-
gamba Rivers, on its way to the distant sea.
You have by this time arrived at the Knap-
sack G-ully Viaduct (245 feet above Emu
Plains), boldly erected across a steep and
stony gorge by theVgenius of the Engineer-
in-chief, John Whitton. This admirable and
imposing structure (which Imperial Rome,
in her palmy days, might have been proud
to claim), consists of seven successive
arches—five of 50 feet span, and two of 20.
It is of solid masonry throughout, the
stones having been set in the best Portland
Cement—built for a single line of railway,
and with an incline along it of 1 foot in 30
feet. The length of this viaduct is 388 feet,
and its greatest height, from the foundation
in the rock to the level of the rails, is 126
feet. panoramic views of Cumber-
land increasingly developed are shown to
the traveller and abruptly withdrawn, as
the train proceeds. Eirst, it goes 200 or
300 yards in one direction, rising slowly
every yard until it stops; then, by the co-
operation of the skilled engineer and the
watchful pointsman, the train is quickly
“reversed” and launched back upon another
ascending gradient, in an opposite direction,
up to a corresponding point. Erom that,
the Zigzag mode of progression is once more
intrepidly resumed; until at length (by such
successive changes of direction, and in an
incredibly short time) the train is found
to have deftly climbed to an elevation of
of nearly 700 feet. The consequent alteration
of climate at the top of the Zigzag is very
remarkable; exhilarating and sudden, not
unlike what may sometimes be experienced
after ascending to the summit of a very lofty
tower, like the campanile of the Town Hall of
Sydney. This mode of ascent incidentally
develops in a very striking manner the beauty
and the variety of the scenery. Lucasville
Platform is named from the country house
of the Hon. John Lucas, M.L.A., standing
somewhere in the vicinity.
Glenbrook Platform, 41 miles; 766 feet
above sea-level. —After passing the Lucasville
Platform the Line is continued, first westerly,
and then with a bend to the northward, until
after an interval of rather more than 2 miles
the summit of Lapstone Hill, near “ The
Old Pilgrim Inn ”is attained. About half
way between Lucasville Platform and the
summit of the hill is Glenbrook, formerly
known as Brookdale or Wascoe’s Siding,
where water for the engine is obtained. The
contrast between this particular portion of
the Line and almost every other portion of
this picturesque and beautiful route is very
striking. There is nothing, however to be
seen here but gum-trees and underwood.
* Blaxland Platform, 42 miles; 766 feet above
sea-level. —This Platform, formerly desig-
nated “ Wascoe’s,” is 1 mile north of Glen-
brook, and is equally undeserving of remark.
Leaving Blaxland (about half a mile from
“ The Old Pilgrim Inn”) the Line directly
proceeds to follow the main range, dividing
the tributaries of the Nepean and the Cox
from those of the Grose River, to the north
and to the north-westward. The Railroad
naturally winds considerably as it follows
the top of the range, but takes for the most
part a north-westerly direction, continuing
still to rise until it comes to Springwood,
rather more than 4 miles further on.
The Valley Platform, 46 miles; 1,048 feet
above sea-level. —Near this quaintly-named
Platform in the breezy highlands stands
“ Wyoming,” the neat and commodious
country residence of the Hon. Geoffrey Eagar,
on the north side of the Railroad, with its
* The nomenclature of three of the stations on the
Western Line of Railway has recently been changed,
viz., Wascoe’s, now named “Blaxland,” Blue Moun-
tain, now named “ Lawson,” and Weatherboard, now
named “Wentworth Falls,” to commemorate the first
successful exploration of the Blue Mountains. “It
was not till 1813 that a route across these mountains
was discovered. A severe drought had aroused grave
apprehensions for the safety of the flocks and herds
of the colony, which were even at that early date
beginning to be appreciated at their true value—
many an arduous search for water was the result—
at length, when every resource was apparently about
to fail, Mr. Wentworth, the pioneer of material and
social progress in Australia, in conjunction with
Messrs. Blaxland and Lawson, organized an ex-
ploring party to endeavour to penetrate to the
interior through some of the mountain gorges. After
encountering many difficulties the parly were fortu-
nate enough to discover a pass by way of the valley
of the Grose, which soon led them to the land of
plenty, and the route was immediately marked out
as the highway to the interior and has ever since
formed part of the old Great Western Road. The
Railway follows nearly the same course.”

pretty garden and grounds. Near to Mr.
Eagar’s house is the post office and telegraph
station, the residence of Mr. Bussell, and
the country homes of other eminent citizens,
who have sought here the reinvigoration of
mountain air and the refined pleasure afforded
by the contemplation of beautiful scenery.
“The Valley” derives its name from a very
lovely far-off prospect commanded herefrom
down the valley (which is beautifully grassed,
open, and park-like) to the eastward towards
the Nepean. A considerable extent of land
has of late years been here taken up on the
ridge to the north of this hamlet, and west
of Fitzgerald’s Grully, dividing the water-
sheds of the Gfrose and the Nepean.
Springwood Platform, 47 miles; 1,216 feet
above sea-level. —Leaving the charming little
mountain village designated “ The Valley,’ ’ the
Bailroad -winds away westerly for a mile, and
after rising 100 feet it brings the traveller
to Springwood ; where at a short distance
below the platform, on Sydney side, will be
found an excellent inn (“Baymond’s Hotel”),
the front of which commands a fine view of
the Nepean Valley to the eastward. There
are other good views in the vicinity.
Botanists and others qualified to judge in
such a matter have declared Springwood to
be the best place on the mountains for
choice ferns and lycopods ; and here excur-
sionists are often to be seen coming back to
the Platform loaded with such sylvan spoils.
Paulconbridge Platform,49 miles; 1,463 feet
above sea-level.— Still following the topmost
ridge of the mountains to the westward for 2
miles further by a sinuous course, the
traveller reaches the Paulconbridge Plat-
form, named from the adjoining property
of Sir Henry Parkes, about 500 acres in
extent, and chiefly valuable perhaps for the
salubrity of its situation and the singular
beauty of the scenery it commands to the
southward, —overlooking a rugged and bro-
ken country forming part of the watershed of
the Nepean, In the neighbourhood of Sir
Henry Parkes’ residence —a pretty mountain
chalet (see View) the Terraced Hardens, the
Eocklily Hlen and the Bocklily Cave are
very characteristic and charming localities
much admired by visitors. As you pass
Paulconbridge to the westward, the top of
Mount Hay becomes visible about 9 miles to
the north-westward. The scenery on either
side of the road now becomes intensely
interesting, presenting surprises which seem
like gorgeous glimpses of fairy land; _ so
suddenly are they manifested and with-
drawn.*
Numantia Platform, 52 miles; 1,672 feet
above sea-level. —When the train has passed
the Platform at Paulconbridge its course
for a few hundred yards is due west; it runs
south-south-west for about a mile, passes
the residences of Dr. Badham and of Sir
Alfred Stephen (Alphington) on the left,
and so trending somewhat westerly reaches
the platform at Numantia, —the classical
name selected for the temporary residence
of His Honor Sir James Martin, the Chief
Justice, of which we here present an accurate
view. Numantia lies 8 miles from Paulcon-
bridge, —to the south-west of it. Near here
Sir James Martin is building a large family
mansion. There are some good views from
Numantia to the southward.
Woodford (late Buss’s) Platform, 55 miles;
2,191 feet above sea-level— As the traveller
proceeds on his journey into the interior
past Numantia, he may (if he is sharp
enough) catch a lovely but fleeting glimpse
of home view scenery to the northward ;
another view—nearly in the same direction —
of the Pass of Broken Back in the far off
Sugar-loaf Bange, in the county of Northum-
berland ; t'wo views over the rugged ravines
to the southward and south-eastward ; and
distant but approaching views of Mount
* A recently published work of standard merit,
compiled under authority by Mr. James Tingle,
speaking of the Hartley District, says : “We have
said that this is a remarkable district, and justly so,
because for magnificence of scenery, wealth of
mineral resources, and monuments of engineering
skill, it is probably without a rival in the southern
hemisphere. The Blue Mountains, with their in-
numerable hills and ravines, present extensive
panoramas of the grandest description. As the
traveller in the Bail way is sped along the summit of
the range, and catches glimpses of the thousand
valleys stretching like ocean waves to the horizon,
on both sides of the line (which for a considerable
distance is laid on a narrow causeway that looks as
if built up for thousands of feet out of awful depths
of precipice and ravine) he finds it difficult to
imagine a nobler representation of the grandeur and
sublimity of nature. —“Sands’ Official Post Office
Country Directory and Gazetteer of New South
Wales for 1878, 1879, page 267.”


Hay and Mount King George. The Line
after leaving the Numantia Platform takes
a sharp turn to the southward, and con-
tinues on the ridge in that direction for
nearly 2 miles, in the middle of which
stands a handsome stone gate-house where
the Old Road (which has been running
parallel with the Railroad nearly all the way
from “ Blaxland ”) again crosses the Line.
The gate is now but seldom opened for the
Old Road is practically superseded by the
Railway. This gate-house is 53 miles from
Sydney. 1 mile south-west of this gate-
house and 2 miles in the same direction from
Numantia stands the Woodford Platform,
about 520 feet higher than Numantia and
Alphington, &c. Here Mr. Alfred Fairfax
has a commodious residence and large
gardens (Woodford), from which the Wood-
ford Platform takes its name. Before you get
to Woodford there are several fine glimpses of
scenery, and especially the grand unfolding
of a long, pale blue, broken line of mountains
in the extreme distance to the north-east-
ward beyond the Brisbane Water district, and
in the direction of Maitland. Woodford is
only 3 miles from Numantia ; and, although
perhaps somewhat exposed in wintry weather
it is noted for its fine bracing atmosphere,
which resembles that of the more elevated
portions of the West of England.
* Lawson Station (“Blue Mountains”), 58
miles; 2,399 feet above sea-level.— At about
1 mile due west from the Woodford Plat-
form, the Line takes a turn and runs for
a mile to the west-north-west; then due
west for another mile, and then west-south-
west for a fourth mile ; to the “ Old Blue
Mountain Inn Station ” —now proposed to
be distinguished by the name of “Lawson” —
the vague, equivocal designation of “ Blue
Mountains,” often misleading unobservant
travellers. This is to be noted as the first
Station arrived at after Emu Plains, the
intervening localities being only platforms
or sidings of minor importance. Blue Moun-
tains or Lawson, is a small hamlet with
a telegraph station and post office, &c.,
the principal house being the commodious
Family Hotel kept for many long years past
by Mr. Henry Wilson, a little to the south-
west of the railway station. Lawson is noted
for having near it several views of great
beauty and deep interest on either side of
the Line, and at comparatively short dis-
tances in places easy of access to the sick,
the weak, or the aged. The Hotel near the
station is much resorted to by invalids who
can there without fatigue enjoy the moun-
tain scenery, the pure, invigorating air, and
the material comforts of a good well
managed inn. There is a fine prospect to
the north from the verandah of the hotel.
It takes the Railway Traveller about three
hours and a half to arrive here by train from
Sydney, and about two hours to come up to
this spot from Penrith. Here the tourist
can conveniently visit the Adelina Falls
(two of 40 feet descent, one of 60, and
one of 70 feet) on the south side of the
Line; with Dante’s (Hen and three other
waterfalls on the northern side —one of 40
feet, one of 90, and one (the most re-
markable of them all) with a descent of
120 feet. Perhaps a short description of
these two adjacent localities may not be
unacceptable to the reader.
The Adelina Falls.— The Adelina Falls
(named after Miss Adelina Wilson, daughter
of the landlord of the adjacent inn) are, all
four of them, grouped together, at a distance
of a mile or so, to the south-eastward of the
Station ; and from the platform to the first
and most important of these beautiful
cascades (see View) there is an excellently
formed road, by which the visitor soon arrives
at the edge of a line of rock, whence he can
readily descend into the immediate vicinity
of the waterfall by a convenient flight of
rudely constructed steps. A smooth path
leads him from the foot of the steps straight
down to a craig on the eastern side of a
small ravine, over the rocky (northern) wall
of which the clear cold waters of a moun-
tain stream leap headlong into an abyss.
These Falls —the Adelina Falls, par excel-
lence—are not less than 70 feet in their un-
broken descent, and are justly admired,
tumbling over a mass of dark shining rock
into the scene of sylvan beauty represented
by our artist. This water-formed chasm (or
“ ghwyll” as the Welsh would call it) is
fringed with masses of green brushwood and
long reedy grass, well shaded everywhere by
the white-trunked eucalyptus ; the narrow

semi-circular valley itself, into which, the
streamlet dashes, being partially filled up
with tall straggling gum Near the
base of the grand cascade there is a fine dis-
play of ferns and such like plants. 1 erns
and creepers overhang this beautiful water-
fall like waving tresses, and bedeck the
sombre wall of cliff over which the sparkling
rivulet descends. Near to this hall are
several elegant coachwood trees and other
arborescents, such as are usually seen in
these moist and secluded localities. The air
is deliciously fresh and cool, even during the
hottest summer day. Seated in the shade—
from his dry and elevated look-out on the solid
rock —the visitor may pass many an hour of
delicious repose listening to the murmuring
plash of the water, the faint whisper of the
wind, and the joyous “sweet jargoning of the
birds. To reach the three other cascades on
the south of the road, the visitor must cross
the head of the Adelina Tails—an old track
to the westward, here running south-easterly,
being available for that purpose. The
streamlet is one of the many minor tribu-
taries of the Cox, a river which falls into the
Warragamba, destined, when joined to the
Cowpasture Eiver, to become the Nepean.
Dante’s Glen and Waterfalls— Leaving the
Blue Mountain or Lawson Station, and
proceeding for a few yards to the noi th
north-west, by a track through the scrubby
forest, the visitor passes two stone tanks
or reservoirs for the supply of the en-
gines with water; and then following a
recently cleared downward path, trend-
ing northerly, he arrives (after walking for
about half-a-mile) at the edge of a sloping
reedy marsh draining into the watershed of
the Grose. A little beyond the eastern
extremity of this out-of-the-way and desolate
spot, a rough but well defined path for
awhile leads him on, until at length by an
abrupt descent he reaches the precipitous
sides of a wide and dark tree-shaded valley —
suddenly revealed in all its immensity, and
resounding with the continuous rush of con-
cealed waters in its mysterious depths. The
lonely devious path, and the steep declivi-
ties of this cavernous glen, are difficult
enough and wild enough to remind the
student of the “ selva oscura” mentioned in
the opening of the grand and gloomy Poem
of the “ Immortal Florentinethere being
a weird character about the whole place
calculated to inspire the soul with admira-
tion and with awe. Hence, doubtless, the
expressive name of Dante’s Glen, by which
this valley has lately been distiguished. in
Dante’s Glen there are three waterfalls
which can be reached by an adventurous
and active tourist. The first —about three-
quarters of a mile from the Station—is seen
to the right, soon after you enter the glen-
The easterly stream here falls over a ledge
of rock to a depth of 40 feet, and becomes
invisible during the rest of its course down
the valley. Beneath this first, a few chains
further on, there is a second waterfall of 90
feet. A small steep track leads down to-
wards both of these from the topmost ridge
of the valley. The lower portion of the
path thus winding down into this sequestered
locality is thickly wooded, and ends in two
deep precipitous gorges, uniting at an inac-
cessible rocky northern outlet. To the right
is the lower (or second) cascade already
mentioned—the largest waterfall of all
three being away in the gully up to the left.
The western extremity of this intersecting
ravine is a huge black cliff, hemmed in on all
sides by tall trees, and overhung with ferns,
creepers, and parasitical plants. Over this
dark precipice a fine stream falls 120 feet in
sheer descent, its broken feathery sprays
being caught and collected at the foot of the
cliff in a basin like a Naiad’s bath hollowed
out of a flat rock. The course of this
stream, descending therefrom to its junction
with the other, is like the rest of the glen,
densely timbered with coachwood, tree ferns,
a kind of alder, and sassafrax. There is a
rocky shelf beside the pellucid pool at the
bottom of the cataract, curiously over-
arched by the cliff, and of course a favourite
haunt for excursionists. You can pass right
under this Ball if you choose to be so fool-
hardy, but you had much better not do so,
for the feat is not unattended with danger.
Looked up to from the end of the over-
arched ledge above referred to, the effect of
this waterfall is exceeding solemn and grand.
It has been justly said, by an excellent
authority (Burton) : “ There is nothing^
more beautiful to be seen in the whole of
the Blue Mountains than this wonderful
spot.”


* Wentworth Falls, or Weatherboard Plat-
form, 63 miles; 2,856 feet above sea-level —
On leaving Lawson Station near the “ Old
Blue Mountain Inn,” the Line runs for
two miles along the ridge to the west-
south-west, and then (by a sharp turn)
trends west-north-west for 2 miles further,
when it reaches the locality generally known
as the “Weatherboard,” where there is a
platform and a pointsman’s house. The rail-
way excursionist is now on the confines of
that considerable extent of level ground
upon the mountains, about 24 miles in length,
and formerly known by the appellation of
“The King’s Table-land,” a name given
to it (as early chroniclers inform us) by
Governor Macquarie himself during an
adventurous vice-regal tour in this direction
when deeply impressed with the “ majestic
grandeur of the situation, combined with
the various objects to be seen from the spot.”
On the south-west side of this table-land
the mountain terminates, as an old Colonial
annalist informs us, “in abrupt precipices of
immense depth; at the bottom of which is
seen a glen as romantically beautiful as can
well be imagined, bounded on the further
side by mountains of great magnitude, ter-
minating as abruptly as the others, and the
whole thickly covered with timber.” The
glen thus graphically described—and named
Prince Regent’s Glen by Governor Mac-
quarie—appears to be identical with one of
the north-westerly prolongations or branches
of that great Cunimbla Valley which is now
known to be more or less connected (at its
north-westerly extreme) with the beautiful
Yale of Hartley. The name of “Prince
Regent’s Glen’ ’ should therefore now, perhaps
be judiciously restricted to a north-westerly
and less extensive ravine, reaching from
its intersection with the great Cunimbla
Yalley back to an abrupt rocky end in
the neighbourhood of the far famed Water-
fall of the Weatherboard, the true (histori-
cal) appellation of which, by the way, is
Campbell’s Cataract —a name bestowed upon
it by Governor Macquarie in honor of
the Colonial Secretary of the period. The
upper or north westerly extreme of Prince
Regent’s Glen is, it may be remarked, of a
somewhat circular form, presenting a grand
coup d'ceil of mountains rising beyond moun-
tains, with stupendous masses o£ cliffs in the
foreground and in mid distance, reaching
almost round the vast and deep well-wooded
hollow to the west and to the southward;
except, indeed, where the Prince Eegent’s
Glen opens out on to the great sunken
valley above-mentioned, and so displays a
glorious, many-tinted, and distant view of
vast shadowy walls of precipice on the other
side of that valley, many long miles away.
This circular termination of the Prince
Eegent’s Glen, at its northernmost end, was
named by Governor Macquarie the “ Pitt
Amphitheatre” in honor of the Eight
Honorable William Pitt, and is what is
usually referred to by tourists under the
very vague and most inexpressive name
of the Weatherboard. Prom any good point
on King’s Table-land —such, for example, as
the verandah of Mr. Charles Abraham’s
accommodation house, about 2,900 feet above
the sea-level—the light-house at the Sydney
South Head, on a clear night, looking due
east, is distinctly visible at a distance of 62
miles. The same well known beacon can,
it is said, at times, be seen from Blackheath,
nearly 500 feet higher, and 11 miles further
away from the coast.
General description of the Weatherboard. —
Mr. C. A. Wilson’s accommodation house
lies about 50 yards from the pointsman’s
house, on the southern side of the Eailway,
not far from the semaphore, and an old
powder magazine in the open —both con-
spicuous objects. Hear the semaphore is a
tombstone —“Sacred to the memory of
James Perguson, who was killed by lightning
on 21st December, 1859; aged 22 years
and 10 months.” Formerly, as it would
appear, there was a burial-ground now tra-
versed by the Eailway in this secluded spot,
of which this now seems to be the sole re-
maining tomb. A few cottages are yet to
be found in the vicinity. The air is fresh
and wholesome, as might be expected at such
an elevation ; but in stormy weather it is
not a locality where there is much that can
be pleasant for the tourist out of doors.
The old Western Eoad, between the Weather-
board and Blackheath, is now almost wholly
disused, except when fat cattle are occa-
sionally driven over it by night. In many

places this picturesque old road is utterly
dilapidated, torn and worn away by the
wind and rain. At the back of Wilson’s
there is a ruined bridge, through the broken
arch of which a fine stream (Jamison’s Creek)
flows away, southerly for If or 2 miles, to
the neighbouring gorge. The road to the
Weatherboard Falls from the so-called
“ station ” leads by this broken bridge,
through the bush south-westerly to the edge
of that celebrated chasm, and most enchant-
ing view. There is also a pleasant walk on
the north side of the Line, to the north-west
of the semaphore. North of the Railroad,
hut somewhat more to the eastward, lies the
winding track to “The Water Nymph’s Dell,”
the direction of which is, however, far too
intricate to he discovered unless under the
guidance of some resident. The accommo-
dation at Mr. C. A. Wilson’s, without being
in any way pretentious, is cheap and good.
Visit to the Weatherboard Gorge and Falls.
—“ Starting from the accommodation house
with a guide, I crossed,” says a recent visitor,
“ the jmined bridge at the back of Wilson’s,
struck into the bush to the south-west, and
—after walking along a pretty fair road for
about If mile—l reached at the end of a
rather devious path the framework of a hut
erected by the Government for tourists and
others, and wantonly and basely destroyed
(like that at Grovett’s Leap) by thoughtless
or selfish persons. From the elevated point
thus arrived at on the topmost edge of this
Titanic G-orge, there is a steep and almost
precipitous descent to the southward, partly
shaded with stunted trees, and terminating
—after passing a flight of steps, cut boldly
out of the solid rock—in a broad, natural
platform of waterworn stone, immediately
opposite to “The Campbell Cataract,” or
Falls, and overlooking that vast amphi-
theatre named after the renowned states-
man William Pitt which here terminates
the Prince Regent’s Glen. The platform
seems actually to overhang the Great Falls,
which are, however, at some distance from
it to the left (the eastward), across a huge
semi-circular abyss, hollowed out of red
and grey rocks, and over-shadowed every-
where with trees and ferns. In front of the
spectator is the chasm’s edge, stretching
along like the elevated margin of a bay; and
beyond this rough but well-defined line is
that fairy-land of mountain, cliff, and forest,
which no pencil can perfectly depict, or pen
adequately describe. To the left, is a small
tract of barren and mountainous country, of
an immense altitude, coming up from the
southward, and forming the easterly frame
of this vast and marvellous picture. Its
westerly frame presents rude cliffs and a
wooded talus towards the entrance to the Pitt
Amphitheatre; and on its upper surface
are seen mountain streams and rivulets
hastening to unite themselves to the main
stream coming from the opposite direction
(Jamison’s Creek) and then to dash them-
selves into a cylindrical abyss, whose falling
waters resound in your ears like an ever-
lasting sigh. Approaching cautiously to
the edge of the platform, or (what is perhaps
more safe) lying down to look over, you
see the stream wildly precipitated over
stratified rings of grey, red, and black
rock, into the bottom of this grand moun-
tain glen, a distance of (apparently) not
less than 1,000 feet in sheer descent. The
waters of the cataract drain away into the
far off depths of the densely wooded valley
beneath, the lowermost line of which seems
ultimately to indicate a south-easterly direc-
tion. When I first approached this spot at
about 9 a.m., the falls were threefold in
their development, and stood in a deep and
misty shadow. Near the bottom of the first
fall, breaking into feathery spray, long before
it reaches a slightly projecting mass of
broken fragments of stone, about half way
down, there is to the south a long thin line
of forest trees, the foliage of which looks
dim and soft when seen from the great
height of the platform on the rock. These
trees, half way down into the abyss, spread
all along the surface of the small projecting
ledge in the precipitous wall on the eastern
side of the gorge ; their irregular masses of
greenery contributing greatly to the charm
of the scene. Below these broken masses
of stone, and trees, and brushwood, a second
dreadful precipice descends, and a second
fall may, by a daring spectator be seen, far
below the dizzy altitude—so far that no
murmur from this and the next succeeding
fall ascends to break the silence. It is only
the everlasting sweep of the upper portion
of the cataract which makes itself distinctly


audible. Below, as I have intimated, the
stream follows unseen its appointed course
through the sylvan depths of that enchanted
valley. Anything more sublime and awe-
inspiring cannot possibly be imagined. On
the western side of the Gorge of the TV eather-
board, at the distance of about \ a mile,
there is a second wall of parti-coloured rock,
with a huge talus of rock and trees, and a
towering royal crest of trees and under-
growth. Further away to the south-west-
ward (on the north-west side of the Amphi-
theatre) comes an abrupt break; and then
more cliffs and declivities, and another wide
valley of low-lying forest and hill scenery is
displayed, enclosed by another and yet more
extensive range of rocky wall and talus , or
slopes formed of detritus or decayed rock.
This range of brightly-tinted cliffs (in which
deep red colour predominates) trends easterly
for some miles, and at last —having almost
traversed the entire picture —ends with an
abrupt descent into the Prince Regent’s
Glen. Beyond the eastern extremity of the
distinct line thus furnished in mid-distance
is another stretch of woodland, dim and
cerulean in its many shadowy gaps and hol-
lows. Beyond that line again comes another
more shadowy tract in bright cobalt ; and
beyond that yet again appear the far off
outlines of a mountainous country, wrapped
in a mantle of denser blue, its summits crowned
with cliffs in exquisitively blended tints of
pink and yellow. Over all that again at
intervals (and especially from the ruined hut)
can be seen an ethereal light blue outline of
lofty hills in the extreme distance. On the
rocky platform which overlooks the “ Falls,”
the aspiring mind of Young Australia has
prompted the inscription of names and
surnames of parties not yet otherwise dis-
tinguished. These names have been boldly
carved on the ledge of stone in the vain hope
of thereby securing some adventitious immor-
tality. The whole of the rocky ledge which
overlooks the gorge is public property, but
some of the land in the vicinity has already
been alienated. “The Weeping Rock,” for
instance, is on private property, belonging to
Mr. D. Fletcher, of Sydney. This “weeping
rock,” an object of great interest to those
who visit the Weatherboard, stands above
the “ Great Fall,” on the east side of the
Gorge, and well deserves the name which has
been given to it. The continuous flow of
water which trickles over this curious half
isolated mass of stone is occasioned, by a
rivulet breaking away from the main stream,
known as Jamison's Creek —the same which
feeds the Great Fall, or Campbell’s Cataract.”
Another description of the Campbell Cata-
ract and the Gorge at the Weatherboard
The following description of the Campbell
Cataract and the adjacent gorge is taken
from Mr. Edwin Burton’s Guide, an admir-
ably compiled and useful little work. Mr.
Burton’s Guide , page 118, says; “ The
Campbell Cataract is, however, the great
attraction to tourists. The water leaps over
the tremendous precipice into the glen below.
The scene has thus been depicted by the
Rev. Dr. Lang : —‘ At the point where the
rivulet from the Weatherboard hut discharges
itself there is a break, or bay, in the line of
cliffs on that side, as if a vast portion of the
wall of rock had been quarried out for the
purpose, the two points appearing from be-
hind like two lofty headlands jutting out
into the valley, and bearing a remarkable
resemblance to the Heads of Port Jackson.
The rivulet, which in its course of 2 miles
and a half has been swelled by one or two
smaller streams issuing from lateral valleys,
to the size of a common mill stream, preci-
pitates itself all at once over the rocks at the
head of the bay and is lost in the abyss, the
fall being at least 1,000 feet. On gaining
the edge of the precipice the waters of the
rivulet seem to shrink instinctively from the
frightful leap to which they have been con-
ducted in their course down the valley, each
individual drop appearing endowed with
separate volition, and seeming determined to
shift for itself, and the whole mass of fluid
resolving itself into what appears like in-
numerable particles of frozen snow. Many
hundred feet below, the tops of apparently
lofty trees are seen at the bottom of Prince
Regent’s Glen, and so completely do the
cyclopean walls of rock which form the
glen defy all direct communication between
the heights and the hollow, that the shortest
practicable route from the place where the
rivulet leaps over the precipice to the bottom
of the cliffs, over which it falls, is 16 miles.
G-overnor Macquarie named the waterfall the
Campbell Cataract, in honor of the Colonial


THE FALLS, WEATHERBOARD. (See pages 43, 45, and 46.)


Secretary of that period. At the time we
visited the Fall there was a strong wind
blowing up the glen. The wind caught the
falling waters before they had time to reach
the bottom, and scattered them into mist,
carrying them to great distances. The sun’s
rays falling on the particles produced the
phenomena of innumerable rainbows, the
effect of the whole scene being indescribably
beautiful.’ Connected with this wonderful
place there is a legend about the inhumanity
of the keeper of a “ shanty ” near by the
precipice, in the early days of the Colony.
Before railways were thought of, lucky
diggers had to use the road,and this “shanty,”
where grog was sold on the sly, was often
resorted to by those who wanted shelter and
rest. _ As the story goes—and there are
more improbable stories—the keeper used to
lure them to the precipice, rob them, and
then pitch them over into the valley beneath.
The Falls are about 2 miles from the railway
platform. There is a small accommodation
house near the platform, where a guide may
be procured. Persons may leave Sydney by
the morning train, visit the Falls, and return
to Sydney the same night.”
The Water Nymph’s Dell.— Directly oppo-
site to the Weatherboard Station (or rather
Platform) there is a very pretty waterfall, in a
curiously-secluded narrow glen ; both water-
fall and glen being well worthy of a visit.
You cross the Eailroad a little to the west
of the pointsman’s house, and turn down at
once into an adjacent scantily wooded valley,
wherein flowering shrubs and rushes appear
as the principal features. A path leads
down a continuation of this valley to the
eastward, on somewhat firmer ground, for
about a mile and a half; and then, by an
abrupt turn to the right, a winding and pre-
cipitous track takes you down into the upper
end of a deep and rocky gully. The bottom
and sides of this gully are shaded with tall
trees of coachwood and sassafrax, every-
where interlaced with vines ; and in the
lower portions of the gully there is an
abundance of ferns, mosses, and lycopods of
all descriptions—some of them very choice
and rare. Tree ferns—(the Alsophila aus-
tralis and the Dicksonia antarctica ) display
their graceful fronds on all sides of you, in
this cool umbrageous place ; and when you
stand upon the lower ledge of rock, at the
base of the tortuous path, the pleasant rippling
sound of falling water becomes distinctly
audible. Proceeding further still, the noise
of a waterfall is soon heard, and over the
grey cliff opposite, across the gorge (draped
in the glittering, dark foliage of trees and
arborescent plants) a charming cascade
comes down, whispering and murmuring into
the glen, Following the rough and difficult
path to the westward, up this lovely but
lonely place, the end of the gorge becomes
suddenly revealed. At the termination of
the path, and below the cliff, lies a pool of
limpid water, wherein Egeria herself might
not have disdained to bathe. This pool is
supplied by the waterfall, descending at the
back of it, from the precipice, in several
broken rills, for more than 50 feet. The
dark sides of the rock and the edges of the
basin in this W ater Nymph’s Dell are fringed
and decked with mosses and creeping plants
of a wonderful beauty and variety. The
path down the hill-side appears to be by no
means an easy one, but the youthful, smiling
guide speaks admiringly of the indomitable
energy and daring of the lady visitors to this
beautiful and romantic spot. Another less
hazardous ramble may be found by leaving
the semaphore near the line, and following
up a bubbling stream, by the edge of a
marsh, to the north-westward. The visitor
may do this for some considerable distance
and find his gravelly path bordered by a
profusion of mountain flowers, ferns, lycopo-
diums, and those other plants which, in
Australia, appear to take the place of the
heather, in the uplands of Scotland and
other parts of Europe.
Katoomba Platform, 66 miles; 3,349 feet
above sea-level. —Leaving the Platform at
the Weatherboard, opposite the pointsman’s
house, the Line takes a sinuous course to the
west-south-west for 4 miles, when it reaches
the platform at Katoomba. At Katoomba
will be found a platform, point-house, and
telegraph station, but no inn or accommoda-
tion house. The scenery in the neighbour-
hood is magnificent, and much of it may be
enjoyed by an attentive traveller from the
windows of the railway carriages. Mr.
J. H. Neale, J.P., resides near Katoomba,
in a very pleasant and salubrious spot.
There is a fine waterfall 4 miles from the
siding, on the left or south-western side.

When you leave Katoomba there are peeps
to the left as you proceed for about 2 miles
further to the westward. Mountains then
become visible to the right, and distant
views are to be seen to the left with lofty
red cliffs and dark blue and grey ranges.
Then the road—at Pulpit Hill-takes a sharp
turn to the northward, and runs through
many deep cuttings on this prolongation of
the table-land still lying between the two
great water-sheds; winding a good deal, and
showing many glimpses of blue mountains
and magnificent cliff's of red and grev sand-
stone. To the left, over the Cunimbla
Valley, views are occasionally to be seen of
a wondrous beauty, and strangely diversified
with rich varieties of colour and atmospheric
effects. The Line passes a pretty Gothic gate-
house (for the benefit of those drovers who
may still have occasion to use the Old Road)
and soon after you catch sight of the far off
ranges of mountains, which lie in the direc-
tion of Windsor and Richmond, and even
of Brisbane Water—the “ Gap” beyond Coo-
ranbong, in the Broken Back, or Sugar-loaf
Range, being readily distinguishable on a
clear day by those who know where to
look for it. Then there are several hastily
displayed, and as rapidly withdrawn views
of the Cunimbla Valley away to the south-
westward ; and so, after a very pleasant
trajet of 7 miles, the traveller finds himself
a y r i v Gd at Blackheath, in the immediate
vicinity of Govett’s Leap and Gorge, over-
looking to the north and north-eastward the
Great Valley of the Grose.
Mount King George, Mount Hay, Mount
Toomah, and Mount Wilson. —Lying north-
eastward and north of the Line between
Katoomba and Blackheath—from 6 to 13
miles away, and in the almost inaccessible
country which constitutes the watersheds of
the Grose and the Colo Rivers—are the four
lofty mountains of King George, Hay,
Toomah, and Wilson. Mount King George,
on the north-west side of the Grose—the
Saddle-backed Hill, visible from Sydney—is
3,620 feet high ; Mount Hay, on the south-
east side of the same river, 2,400 feet; and
(more northerly, between the Colo River
and the Wollangambe Creek) Mount Wilson,
3,580 feet. Eastward of all these, stands
Mount Toomah, 3,240 feet high. These
mountains, the most conspicuous points in
the whole range, can be seen from Sydney,
and are sometimes spoken of collectively,
as “ The Dromedary.” Some of them can
first be seen from the verandah of the “ Old
Blue Mountain Inn,” at the Lawson Station;
but as the traveller proceeds to the west-
ward, they become gradually more and
more developed. “Mr. Charles Moore, of
the Sydney Botanic Gardens,” says Burton’s
Guide (page 121), “has drawn attention to
the fact that on these four hills the soil
is of the richest kind, composed principally
of disintegrated trap, and clad with noble
timber trees of a brush character, the under-
growth being chiefly tree and other ferns.
This is the more extraordinary from the
fact that they are surrounded in all direc-
tions by others of a sandstone formatio7i,
covered by a wretched and sterile scrub,
and some eucalypti of miserable growth,
Eor long after the opening of the Main
Western Road, Mount Hay was supposed
to be inaccessible, until that indefatigable
explorer, Count Strzelecki successfully
crossed the ravines, and ascended the summit.
“ Some idea,” says Sir Thomas Mitchell,
in his work on Australia, “maybe formed of
the intricate character of the mountain
ravines in the neighbourhood, from the
difficulties experienced by the surveyors in
endeavouring to obtain access to Mount
Hay. Mr. Dixon, in an unsuccessful attempt,
penetrated to the Valley of the Grose, until
then unvisited by man, and when he at
length emerged from the ravines in which he
had been bewildered four days, he thanked
God (to use his own words, in an official
letter), that he had found his way out of
them.” Even Count Strzelecki tells us, that
in the course of his researches he was en-
gulphed in the endless labyrinth of the
almost subterraneous gullies of Mount Hay,
and was unable to extricate himself and his
men until after days of incessant fatigue,
danger, and starvation. “ But,” he adds,
“ the ascent of Mount Hay, when these diffi-
culties are once surmounted, repays richly
the exertions and fatigues which it entails.
Erom its basaltic top the distant views to
the south and west are somewhat intercepted
by King’s Table-land, and other mountains
somewhat higher than Mount Hay. But
to the east, the sea-coast, bordering the
D


interesting basin, through which flows the
rivers Nepean and Hawkesbury, the vicinity
of Parramatta Eiver, together with Sydney
and Botany Bay, are distinctly visible. To
the north also the prospect is extensive.
In the intervening space may be noticed, the
vast G-orge at the head of the Grose River.
In a westerly direction, in the valley, lie the
towns of Hartley and Bowenfels, with Mount
Lambie in the back ground.” Mount King
George, Mount Hay, and Mount Toomah,
form conspicuous objects in the grand view
from the edge of the G-orge near Blackheath,
which generally goes by the odd but well-
known name of “ Govett s Leap.
Blackheath Platform, 73 miles; 3,494 feet
above sea-level. —Blackheath Station, or rather
Platform, is a place of much more easy
access than the Weatherboard, for there is
much less danger of being carried past it
by the train, and it may be readily visited
from Mount Victoria, either on foot or
on horseback; there being a good road
near the Line all the way, a distance ot
about 4 miles. A good accommodation
house stands near the Blackheath platform
On the eastern side of the hotel a road
branches off to the north-eastward and leads
the tourist, after a walk or ride of 2 miles,
to the edge of the Gorge. Mount King
Grcorge is found rising to the left of the
traveller when he reaches this
spot, and Mount Hay appears in front of
him, at the distance of rather more than 5
miles, “as the crow flies.” Between the hut
and Mount Hay there is a general and almost
continuous descent to the extreme depth of
1,850 feet; the vast densely wooded basin
beneath converging towards the Gorge of the
G-rose, presenting a coup cToeil which can
never be forgotten. On the right of the
ruined hut, at the distance of about halt a
mile, is “ The Govett’s Leap, or Tails, an
unbroken descent of between five and six
hundred feet. Par below, in the valley, is
“ The Trinity Cascade,” and to the west-
ward (nearly on a line with Govett’s Leap)
is another waterfall, not so easy to see,
known as “ The Left Hand Pall,” for want
of some more fitting designation. There is
also yet another cascade formed by one of the
minor tributaries of the Grose, away to the
eastward,at the distance of two or three miles
lom the hut. Another track—ending on the
est side of the accommodation house—leads
> “Perry’s Look Down” into the Q-rose
alley near Hat Hill—some miles further to
le north of Govett’s Leap. Prom Peiry s
iook Down” the track is continued past
Docker’s Ladder,” down to a place called
The Gap,” and so on to “ Junction Camp,
i “ the Gorge of the Grose,” properly so
ailed, 2,150 feet below the Blackheath
latform; but no ordinary visitor should,
n any account, attempt to visit these last-
.amed spots without a thoroughly competent
;uide.
Govett’s Leap: Waterfalls and Gorge
a bold and rugged mass of rock in a
>ay, or bend, at the southern extremity of
he valley or chasm, and near the ruined
iut at the end of the road, the visitor may,
lerhaps, obtain the best general view of this
vondrous spot. To the right, at the distance
D f about half a mile, the Govett’s -Leap, or
Pall, pours itself, headlong, over a perpen-
dicular wall of dark tinted rock; 020
feet, in sheer descent, on to a mass
of black fragments of stone, which has,
in the course of ages, accumulated at the
base of the cataract. This descending mass
of water—white and misty as the driven
snow —sways, as the wind blows, to and
like the veil of a bride ; the vast height ot
the waterfall, the strong contrast of colour,
and the undulating motion so produced, im-
parting a very singular and most charming
When the sun attains to a certain
altitude, a rainbow plays for hours around
the cloudy folds of this Pairy Veil. Prom
the neighbourhood of the hut the other cas-
cades are not visible ; but on turning a tew
yards to the westward the deep whisper of
the Left Hand Pall may be distinctly heard.
The whole of this rock-enclosed valley before
the spectator is for the most part hemmed
in with titanic walls ot red and gray rocks
from 400 to 800 feet in height, and from
the irregularly defined base of these outer-
most and uppermost walls of the valley there
is everywhere a steep rocky incline, or
talus, covered with thick woods, down to the
lowest depths, 1,200 feet below the level ot
the rock on which the traveller stands. Here
and there, in this broad and verdant expanse
of tree tops, rising and falling according to


the varied surface, may be seen a few grey
patches of half denuded rock ; but for the
most part all these lower slopes (on either
side of the devious but invisible central
stream) are densely shaded with primeval
forest trees, the tops of which, from the
altitude occupied by the spectator, appear
strangely soft and dim in their outlines.
Beyond the “ Leap ” —apparently a Cumbrian
provincialism for waterfall , named after W.
E. G-ovett, a (Government surveyor, who first
explored these parts—and round the first
point to the eastward, there is another deep
bay of precipitous rock; and from the
furthest limit of this bay there is a winding
channel, leading down to the centre of whole
tableau. From the easternmost end of the
Govett’s Leap Gorge the rocky walls trend
north-westerly, until, ending sharply as
before, the semicircular barren top of Mount
Hay becomes visible, with long lines of blue
hills in the extreme distance. The Govett’s
Leap (Gorge is shut in on the western side
of its northern limit by a boldly projecting
termination of cliff and talus ; and thence
inside of that outer boundary a grand sweep
of rocks, mountains, and declivitous slopes
comes back to the left of the spectator. To
the west of the hut, as you go towards the
Left Hand Falls, there is a most extra-
ordinary echo, by which short sentences are
distinctly repeated nearly half a minute
after they have been uttered. In the slopes
many hundred feet below, in the vicinity of
the Left Hand Fall, there are large and
lovely groves of tree fern, and such like
products, the rocks behind them being beau-
tifully decked with trailing creepers and
arborescent plants. Mount King George
(here assuming the outline of a couchant
lion) overlooks the western side of the
(Govett’s Leap chasm—a southern offshoot
of the Yalley of the Grose, the course of
which, by the way, is here from north-west
to The glorious character of the
entire scene, in all its vastness and sublimity
—cliff, mountain, forest, and shadowy distant
nillss impresses the beholder with admira-
tion and with awe, the never ceasing sigh
of unseen and remote waters naturally con-
ducing greatly to the general effect.
Another description of Govett’s Leap.—
The following description of the Govett’s
Leap Gorge and Falls is from the accom-
plished pen of Mr. E. Du Faur, F.R.G.S.:
“Leaving the Blackheath Platform (73
miles from Sydney) the tourist follows a
road trending east-north-east, through an
uninteresting scrubby forest, for about 2
miles (having gradually descended about 320
feet), when he arrives at the edge of a gorge
hemmed in by perpendicular cliffs of sand-
stone, lying in horizontal strata, and varying
generally from 400 to 800 feet in depth.
From the foot of these cliffs a steep talus
descends to the centre of the gorge, at a
depth of 1,800 feet from the edge of the
precipice. The width of the gorge varies
from three-quarters of a mile to a mile and
a-half, and its length, in a straight line, to
its confluence with that of the Grose River,
is 3j miles. At a distance of 520 yards from
the end of the road a small watercourse
abruptly terminates in the Falls known as
Govett s Leap, the perpendicular depth of
which has been determined at 520 feet, to
where the water first touches the rocks
below, while the actual foot of the Falls, at
the basin, immediately below those rocks,
may be considered as 600 feet. From the
head of the Falls, to which an easy track has
been cleared, another similar waterfall is
visible, bearing about north by west, and
distant 920 yards from Govett’s Leap, and
equally accessible from the road; and
another of at least equal depth exists about
miles to the south-east, but is
more difficult of access. The gathering
grounds of the watercourses which terminate
in these Falls is very limited, being confined
to the northern slopes of the main ridges
along which the Railway passes ; but being
fed from swamps or ‘sponges,’ they are
perennial, and show little variation in the
quantity of water passing down them in
winter or summer, except immediately after
heavy rains. The descent to the foot of the
Falls is at present impracticable from their
immediate neighbourhood. It was reached
for the first time—at least for many years—
in the month of October, 1875, from a
sketching camp formed by the writer, at the
junction of Govett’s Leap Gorge with the
Valley of the Grose, to be hereafter described.
That junction is situated about 12 miles
down the Grose Valley from the Hartley
Yale Siding (80 miles from Sydney), and


1570 feet below the Railway ; thence, owing
the roughness of the upper part or
jvett’s Creek bed, and the denseness ol
e scrub, fully three and a-half hours are
quired to reach the foot of the i alls,
;hough the distance, as above stated, is
ly about 3* miles in a straight line. As
scribed by its visitors on that occasion, the
ene at the bottom of the Ralls is, if possible,
under than that from above. From the
p you can see nothing distinctly, only an
fful gulf, with a confused mass oi foliage
P below ; but from below it appears a large
nphitheatre, filled with trees of luxuriant
■owth, and ferns and mosses. The water
iming down sometimes like falling rockets,
imetimes dissipated by the wind into clouds
! spray before it has half completed its
jwnward course, is wafted over a large
•ea, and insures the conditions of perennial
oisture so plainly evidenced by e
ixuriance of the surrounding vegetation,
hen again, from below you have a sky-
ne broken into many fantastic shapes,
ad lighted up in parts with delicate bright
ues, while others are in deep shade
i lieu of the almost uniformly level horizon
een from above. Standing at the basin at
he foot of Govett’s Leap, which is only
bout 25 yards from the pependicular wall
f rock, it is almost impossible to look up at
he Falls. The better plan is to he on one s
,ack, and look upwards to the zenith, when
he 700 feet cliffs forming the ends ol the
lorse-shoe bend in which the halls are
situated, tower above you on either side,
vhile the waterfall appears to be coming
iown from a depression in their centre
almost on to your face. Few persons per-
haps, could lie in that position for more than
a minute or two at a time without feeling
giddy, the sight is so grand. Besides the
three principal falls above referred to, there
are many others in this valley and in that
of the Grose of almost equal depth, which
have not yet been closely approached; while
some of the minor cascades notably the
‘Trinity Falls’—are of excessive beauty.
Before leaving the subject it may be as wel
to record the origin of the name, Govett s
Leap ’ Mr. W. R. Govett was a Govern-
ment surveyor who, in the year 1832 under
instructions from Sir Thomas (then Major)
Mitchell, the Surveyor General, “ to survey
the features of the county of Cook, is sup-
posed to have first discovered the i alls. He
made some unsuccessful attempts to descend
into the gorge ; but his plans of the contour
of the ranges and gorges, as partly traversed
and otherwise sketched in from above, and
which illustrate an area of some 650 square
miles, are proved to he remarkably accurate,
when the early date and limited means at his
disposal, in country of so remarkably difficult
a character, and entirely uninhabited, are
considered.”
Another description of Govett’s Leap
Mr. Edwin Burton’s description of Govett s
Leap and its vicinity will also be read with
interest. That indefatigable litterateur says :
“ One of the greatest natural wonders of the
world is Govett’s Leap, 6 miles from Mount
Victoria Station. The goods train, which
leaves soon after 10 o’clock every morning,
will drop the excursionist at Blackheath
Platform, and a walk of a mile and a halt
through some pretty scenery, will bring him to
the Gap itself. There was once a stockade
here, and the ruins of the officers’ quarters
may still be seen lying on the ground, whilst
on the opposite side of the station is an old
graveyard. The track leading to the “Leap,
which is wide enough for buggies, is entered
amidst some tea-tree scrub, a hundred yai ds
or so to the left of the Main Western Load,
and not far from the hotel. Once on the
track the visitor has nothing to do but to
follow it up until he reaches the tremendous
rent or depression in the earth, which is saic
to be the deepest chasm with perpendicular
cliffs in the known world. It is almost sur-
rounded with these cliffs, which are believed
to be nowhere less than 3,000 feet above the
level of the sea. The full sublimity and
maiestic grandeur of the scene is not realised
at a first glance. After contemplating it for
a time the mind becomes filled with awe and
wonder as it vainly strives to comprehend
" The vast immeasurable abyss
Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild.
The trees in the valley below, although one
or two hundred feet high, or perhaps more,
are undistinguishable in their _ individuality.
Standing on the abrupt precipitous wail, one
cannot help feeling a strong desire to reach
the depths of the gorge. But the closer one


seeks for a spot at which a descent can be
made, the more certain does it appear that
such an object is unattainable. It is recorded
that Sir Thomas Mitchell (formerly Surveyor
General for the colony) endeavoured, first
by walking and then by crawling between
the great fragments of sandstone, to ascend
the Gorge through which the Eiver Grose
joins the Nepean, but in vain. Near to the
shed, which was erected by the Government
on the occasion of Prince Alfred’s visit, and
which overlooks the ravine, a track may be
noticed winding down 200 or 300 feet, to
where a rock juts out, and on which those
who are fearless enough may recline, and en-
deavour, if they can, to form some concep-
tion of this wonderful place. The scenery is
full of grandeur, and to add to its beauty
there are two streams, which are precipitated
into the mighty chasm, and although meeting
with no impediment but the atmosphere in
their descent, they are dissipated into mist
long before their waters can reach the bot-
tom ; and often when the wind is favorable
the spray is wafted upwards, and along for
a considerable distance. To a few members
of the New South Wales Academy of Art is
the honor due of having explored the valleys
which lead up to this tremendous gorge.
For some days this gallant band made their
home in the ravines, and succeeded in ascer-
taining the heights of the hills, and taking a
number of excellent photographs of the
scenery.”
Mount Victoria Station, 77 miles; 3,422 feet
above sea-level. 4 miles north-north-west
from the Blackheath Platform is the Station
of Mount Victoria, not the less remarkable
for the centrality of its position and for its
bracing atmosphere than for the grandeur
of its scenery. Mount Victoria is at present
but a small place, but is gradually becoming
enlarged, being a very favourite place of re-
sort tor tourists and invalids. Already it
contains numerous villa residences, a post
office, a telegraph station, two or three stores,
and not less than three excellent hotels—
Mr. J. L. Mead’s (the “Eoyal”); Mr. John
Perry'’s “ Family Hotel, ’ ’ and the “ Imperial’ ’ —
just finished. There is also a Public School,
and an Anglican Church. The “ Imperial
Hotel ” is a large castellated edifice, and
occupies a commanding situation between
the two other hotels, from both of which
there are fine views of the surrounding
country. In the immediate vicinity of
Mount Victoria are many localities of great
beauty and peculiar interest to the traveller.
Amongst these are : Mount Piddington ; the
Fairy Fell, near the residence of the Messrs.
Fairfax; the Engineer’s Cascade, the Little
Zigzag; and the Mount Victoria Pass.
There are few places throughout the whole
Blue Mountain Eange where a more pleasant
variety can be found for the lovers of the
picturesque or more comfortable accommo-
dation. It is not uncommon for tourists to
make Mount Victoria their head quarters,
and thence to make excursions in different
directions—up and down the Line, away into
Hartley Vale, and into the great Cunimbla
Valley, and elsewhere.
Mount Piddington. — A favourite much fre-
quented spot is Mount Piddington, to the
south of Mount Victoria, one of the highest
points in the vicinity, and about a mile from
the “Eoyal.” Mount Piddington received its
name in commemoration of the enterprise and
public spirit of the Hon. W. E. Piddington,
the late Colonial Treasurer, who felled many
trees on the summit, formed the roads, and
caused seats to be constructed by the Govern-
ment for the convenience of pedestrians.
This grand eminence, visible from theEailway
on the Sydney side, overlooks a portion of the
Vale of Hartley and the broad Cunimbla
Valley, amongst the undulating hills and
forests of which there are numerous home-
steads. To the south-east are the uplands
of the country near the town of Camden;
and to the north may be seen the distant
ranges which lie away in the direction of
Singleton, on the Hunter. Much nearer, at
the distance of only a dozen miles or so,
may be recognized the four mountains of
King George, Hay, Wilson, and Toomah.
The view from Mount Piddington (every-
where traversed by admirable roads) is
extremely fine in the early morning, when
the varied depths of the whole Valley of
Cunimbla often lie whelmed in a misty
moving sea of blue (cobalt) tipped here and
there with the rosy (or golden) light of the
sun. Mr. E. Vickery’s country residence,
on some far-away hill in the great valley
below, is at all times a conspicuous and

interesting feature in the charming prospec
here unfolded to view. It is near Vickery’s
only 2 or 3 miles beyond it, that the
Blackheath Creek falls into the Eiver Cox
South-eastward of the mountain a stee]
path leads down into a shady wilderness
and at the bottom of this dell there is
beautiful cascade —rushing noisily through
a curious cleft in the massive rock, into
deep pool of clear cold water. Here, at the
base of the fall, and shut in by the over-
arching rocks, visitors occasionally bathe in
the summer season, and so return refreshec
and jubilant to the adjacent township.
The Fairy Dell. —The Fairy Dell lies west
of the residence of Mr. James E. Fairfax,
and is gained by a gravelly path following a
stream of water down a glen of gentle
inclination. This little valley, agreeably
sheltered from the westerly winds, affords a
pleasant ramble in the winter season, and
contains many pretty bits of scenery. At a
quarter of a mile from the house of Mr.
Edward Fairfax there is a rather sudden
descent, and then the path winds to the
right round a dell and cascade. As usual
in these Blue Mountain glades the termina-
tion of all is the cascade, and its capacious
pool of pellucid water, overhung with alders
and ferns. Here there are seats for visitors
to this glen ; the deep seclusion of which is
so frequently disturbed with the uproar of
the unseen train, as it passes thundering
along the Line about a mile away.
The Engineer’s Cascade. —The Engineer’s
Cascade is a fine water-fall a mile or so at
the back of Mr. John Perry’s Family Hotel,
about midway between Mount Piddington
and the Little Zigzag—a little to the left of
the road as you go down towards the Pass.
Here, as in many of the other dingles and
glens, wild flowers, mosses, and ferns
abound. The view from this spot to the
south-westward is very highly spoken of.
The Little Zigzag or Cunimbla Pass— Hot
far from the Old Main Eoad, and to the
rear of Perry’s Hotel, there is a bridle-
track laid out by the Eoads Department,
leading from the mountain down the face of
the precipice into the Cunimbla Valley.
This is generally known as the Little Zigzag,
or Cunimbla Pass, and is well deserving of
a visit. This pass, formed with much skill
on a series of zigzags, is 46 chains in length.
There are sixteen of these traverses on the
side of the mountain, each averaging about
190 feet in length. The scenery from these
successive terraces (and especially from the
upper ones) is very grand. To the right i
Mount Victoria, with its connecting pass on
the old road, in full view, and there is
moreover, an unbroken prospect stretching
over all the lower country. Half-way down
this road are some remarkable fissures ii
the rocks, known as the Cunimbla Caves
These extend into the mountain for some
considerable depth, and should not be
explored without a light or a guide.
The Mount Victoria Pass.— The Mount
Victoria Pass —about 2 miles from the
Mount Victoria Station, on the Old Eoad to
the westward leading towards Hartley —was
constructed many years ago by prison
labour, under the supervision of Sir Thomas
Mitchell. In the old days, before the
existence of railroads, it was regarded as a
triumph of engineering skill, and it is still
well worth a visit. After passing through a
deep cutting at this spot the visitor should
turn off the road for a few yards to the
right, and he will then have spread before
him a magnificent panorama of mountain,
vale, and forest; Little Hartley lying at his
feet, G-reat Hartley beyond, and Bowenfels
in the distance. Here Hartley Vale (con-
taining the measured lands of the Hew South
Wales Shale and Oil Company, with Mount
York and Mount Clarence adjoining—in
fact the whole upper basin of the Eiver
Lett and other minor tributaries of the Cox)
lies away to the north and west of this road
and pass, hemmed in by the steep mountain
ridges upon the east and north.
Mount York. —Another pleasant walk from
Mount Victoria may be found along the
ridge to Mount York, one of the most pro-
minent elevations on the western side of the
range. This mountain—which is named
after Her present Majesty’s uncle, the Duke
of York—terminates abruptly to the west-
ward (at about 6 miles from the Mount
Victoria Station) in precipices of over
750 feet in height ; its topmost point being
3,292 feet above the level of the sea. On
the one hand, at the base of this mountain


lies the * Valley of Clwydd—extending 6
miles in a north-westerly direction—and,
on the other, the yet longer and more
beautiful Hartley Valley. this
last-named romantic tract of country, in the
direction of Bowenfells, may be seen the
conical summit of Mount Lambie ; to the
left, Mount Tarana—at the foot of which
the Railway passes ; and in the far distance
(beyond the spur of Tarana) one of the
lofty peaks of the Canoblas, near Orange,
is on clear days distinguishable. _ Mount
Clarence —on the western declivity of
which is the Bithgow Valley —is directly
opposite to Mount York, in a north-westerly
direction. Passing along the Mount York
road, and at about a mile or so from the
Mount Victoria hotels, the original road —
by means of steep traverses or zigzags—
descended into the adjacent valley, and
traces of this pass may, it is said, yet be
discerned by following along the declivity to
the right. This was the old track down
into the Hartley Valley before the Victoria
Pass was designed and constructed by Sir
Thomas Mitchell. The pass now referred
to, being abrupt and dangerous, has long
since been abandoned.
Excursion from Mount Victoria to the
Weatherboard— An artist, or any real lover
of the picturesque, may take a very pleasant
(although rather fatiguing) excursion from
Mount Victoria to the “ Weatherboard,” by
starting early in the morning, and walking
all the way down by the side of the Railway,
a distance of 15 miles. Water will be
found in abundance and of excellent quality
on the way, but the tourist will have to take
with him all other refreshments, as nothing of
that kind can be met with after he shall have
passed the accommodation house at Black-
heath, 4 miles from Mount Victoria. It will
be well for him to start early, so as to reach
Mr. C. A. Wilson’s accommodation house
at the Weatherboard before night-fall, as
the road between Katoomba and Wilson’s is
lonely-and bad. Much lovely scenery may
thus be observed by a pedestrian tourist,
which he cannot otherwise see, either from
the Line or the Old Road. At about a mile
to the eastward of Mount Victoria he will
come, always looking to the right, upon a
bold bluff in the foreground, fringed with
woods along its outline; sweeping round
from the railway range to where it ends,
in a cliff with a well-wooded talus. Beyond
this stands disclosed an enchanting prospect
of the Great Cunimbla Valley to the south-
east —spread out before you as on a model
map. These distant reaches of country are
beautifully diversified in outline and colour,
and when seen early in the morning, or
(better still) in the evening, are full of great
effects in light and shade. Eurther on, at
the top of a deep perpendicular cutting—
near the staff of the telegraph line —there is
another grand view of the same valley, the
chrome coloured cliffs in the foreground
lending to it a strange but striking
attraction. Then the tourist has to scramble,
at some risk, past three precipitous cuttings,
and he will at length find himself rewarded
with the unexpected prospect of a curious
grey rock to the west of a great gap to the
southward —best seen from an old disused
road to the south of the Line. Another
grand view is next disclosed further on to
the eastward, the Great Cunimbla Valley
appearing over the broken edge of a shelving
semi-circular basin of rock, with sloping
woods, set off (laterally) by tall and brightly
tinted cliffs. The next change presents a
modification of the same kind of scene,
dotted everywhere with broken fragments of
isolated grey rock, and rough pyramids of
stone; Mount Piddington reappearing in
the distance to the westward. This pretty
well occupies the first 4 miles of the trip;
but (near the Blackheath Platform) there
are still occasional peeps of the Great Valley
worth going many miles to see, and not
visible from the adjacent line. Passing
Blackheath and continuing along the Line
towards Katoomba there will be found a
varied succession of views to the south and
south-east —at least six that are well
deserving of the artist’s pencil. Having
reached Katoomba —11 miles from Mount
Victoria—the tourist will find several grand
views of huge parti-coloured cliffs and
shadowy ranges —especially one which he
* The Yale or Valley of Clwydd was so named by
Governor Macquarie in 1815, in consequence of the
strong resemblance it bore to a vale of that name in
North Wales (Wells’ gazetteer). Often, however,
the Vale of Clwydd (lying, as it does, to the left of
the Line), appears to be confounded with the Valleys
of Cunimbla and of Hartley.

Hartley Vale Platform, 80 miles; 3,318 feet
hove sea-level.— After leaving the Mount
Victoria Station the Eailway takes a north-
rly and sometimes even a north-easterly
irection, along a narrow ridge, known as
he “Darling Causeway,” and dividing the
watersheds. The waters fall into the Grose to
he eastward; whilst, on the western side of
he ridge, the heads of the River Lett, and
ither affluents of the Cox, although eastern
raters, commence their course by flowing to
he westward. As the traveller proceeds
;owards Lithgow and Bathurst, he may first
Observe a fine view to the left opening up a
leep well-wooded valley —that of Clwydd ;
ivhilst to the right (the eastward) Mount
King George, with its singularly stratified
sliffis, is seen in mid-distance. Next he
catches, on the same side, a passing glimpse
of a wild and stony country; and then —as
by a magic shift of the camera —a grand and
more distant view is seen of Mount King
George and Mount Hay. After that (still
to the eastward) he has a brief out-look over
the upper portion of the Gorge of the
Grose, stretching past the northerly mouth
of the gorge of Govett’s Leap. To the
westward, the traveller can occasionally see
peeps of the beautiful Vale of Hartley,
which, curiously enough, gives its name to
the next railway platform after Mount
Victoria, upon the mountain ridge.
Kerosene Mines in Hartley Vale.—“ The
Kerosene Mines in Hartley Vale,” says
Burton, “ are well worth seeing, not alone on
account of the scenery but also because
there is some interest attaching to a success-
ful and important industry. There is a
siding laid down from the Great Western
Eailway, about 3 miles from Mount Victoria,
and the goods and passenger trains may be
availed of. Visitors will be put down at the
Hartley Vale Siding if previous notice be
given to the guard. Then a walk of a mile
and a half will bring them to the face of an
almost perpendicular rock 600 feet high, up
which the shale is hoisted by a wire rope
lorked by steam. The shale is_ conveyed to
ydney, the hulk of it for making oil at t ic
Western Kerosene Company’s Works at
Waterloo, some for the manufacture of gas,
ad some for export. The main road from
fount Victoria to Bowenfels passes within 4
dies (to the south) of the mines.” _ The best
earn of petroleum oil coal here is 3 feet 2
aches thick. It has been pronounced by the
Examiner of Coal Fields to be equal to any
nown seam in any other part of the world,
t yields from 150 to 160 gallons of crude
iil to the ton, with an illuminating power
iqual to forty candles. The quantity of
hale despatched from this mine in 1875 was
1,856 tons, and for 1876,15,598 tons; an
ncrease of nearly 6,000 tons in one year.
The Valley of the Grose—From the Hart-
ey Vale Platform, on its eastern side, the
;raveller may, with some necessary assist-
ince, find the best track down into the Valley
jf the Grose, following that river from its
lead down to the “ Junction Camp,” already
spoken of under the section of Blackheath
ind Govett’s Leap, a distance of about 9
miles. The Valley of the Grose, says Mr.
Du Faur, “ may be taken as typical of the
iharacter of the ravines by which the Blue
Mountains are intersected in all directions ;
their geological character will be treated in
a separate paper. Possessing at present
but a limited watershed of about 268 square
miles, it is bounded on the south by the
main ridge which has been chosen for the
Eailway Line ; on the west, for about 6 miles,
by the Darling Causeway above referred to ;
and on the north by the main ridge along
which “ Bell’s Line of Eoad,” a route for
stock only, passes over Mount Tomah and
the Kurrajong Hills to Eichmond. Its
course in a direct line, from the Darling
Causeway to its confluence with the Hawkes-
bury Eiver, a little above Eichmond, does
not exceed 26 miles ; yet within this limited
area, through which flows a stream that
may generally be forded, though at times
an impetuous torrent, are everywhere pre-
sent evidences of the silent workings of
Time and Nature on a stupendous scale ;
no sudden upheavals of volcanic force, but
the gradual disintegration due to atmos-
pheric and pluvial forces, commenced prob-
ably under very different conditions to those
obtaining at present, but still continuing.


The valley was traversed throughout in 1859
by a party of sappers and miners, with a
view to testing its practicability as a route
for the Western Railway ; since that date
it has only been visited occasionally at long
intervals. In 1875 it was determined to
form a sketching and photographic camp 'at
about 12 miles down the valley, with a view
to roughly illustrating it, in order to bring
it under the notice of artists and lovers of
natural scenery; and also, as previously
stated, to explore a route to the foot of
Govett s Leap Falls. On a preliminary
trip, made in July, it was found that the
sappers’ and miners’ track was so overgrown,
encumbered by fallen trees, and obliterated
in parts by landslips, that a considerable
amount of clearing was necessary to enable
packhorses to pass down the gorge with
reasonable safety. This having been done,
two camps were at last formed in October—
the upper one at about 7 miles below the
railway, and the lower at the junction of
Govett’s Leap Creek with the river, under
the magnificent cliffs of Mount King George.
The transport of instruments and chemicals,
by hand, down such a path, and the. limited
time for which the services of the photo-
grapher (supplied by the Commissioners for
the Philadelphia Exhibition) were available,
precluded any hope of obtaining results of
finished excellence. Each spot, previously
selected, had to be taken when reached,
irrespective of adverse conditions of light
or weather, and of chemicals constantly
disturbed; and the strength of the party
was altogether inadequate for making the
clearings in timber and scrub, without which
many of the finest views could not be favour-
ably reproduced by photography. At the
upper camp, at which operations commenced,
a depth of 1,880 feet had been reached;
but between that point and the Junction
Camp, although the actual difference of
level was only 390 feet in 5 miles, the track
was hilly, passing over the
lateral spurs which descend very abruptly
to the river bed ; in some places also the
width of the gorge is so little, in comparison
to the stupendous heights of the adjacent
cliffs, that the latter subtend a larger angle
than can be compassed by the camera. The
scenery in many parts of the river bed is
remarkably picturesque ; the colours of the
rocks of most varied hues ; the foliage on
the river hank, more especially on its left
hank, of a luxuriance so seldom met with in
the Colony; while the rush of the water
amongst the obstructing boulders, and its per-
fect transparency in the still pools, or slighter
rapids, afford fresh charms to the artist at
every turn—charms which, unfortunately,
cannot be reproduced by photography.”
Mount Wilson Platform, 83 miles; 3,478
feet above sea-level.—3 miles north of the
Hartley Vale Siding, and 6 from the Mount
Victoria Station, stands the Mount Wilson
Platform, erected at the western termination
of the Bell’s Line of Road from Richmond,
between 4 and 5 miles to the westward of
Mount Wilson, from which it takes its name.
Mount Wilson.— Speaking of Mount Wil-
son itself, where the scenery is as striking
as it is uninteresting at the “ Platform ” of
that name, Mr. Du Faur has remarked on
the beauty of the vegetation, and the fertility
of the soil. That gentleman says, “The
scanty vegetation and miserably stunted
and gnarled timber which everywhere sur-
round the tourist on the Blue Mountains,
and obscure his view—except when, standing
on the edge of a precipice, he looks down
on the more luxuriant growth, which is
barely visible in the gorges beneath him—
detract immensely from the interest of the
scenery, there are but two striking excep-
tions to this general condition, viz. : at
Mount Tomah, on Bell’s Line of Road (which
is unfavourably situated, owing to its distance
from the Railway), and at Mount Wilson,
the position of which has already been gener-
ally described. A ride of about 5 miles
(from the Mount Wilson Platform) along
the northern watershed of the Grose, and
of about 3 miles further along a spur
trending to the northwards from Bell’s Line
of Road, and leading down into some of the
heads of the Wollangambe Creek and the
Colo River (also affluents of the Hawkes-
bury River), brings the tourist to the foot of
a ridge, which on his right hand appears to
be bounded by the usual perpendicular
escarpment of horizontal sandstone of the
Hawkesbury formation; but the denser
undergrowth, the increased size and improved
symmetry of the trees, and the rich black
soil beneath his feet, tell of a sudden change.


WORKINGS—KEROSENE MINES. (See page 58.)


A few yards further on, along a rather steep
ascent of about 1 in 7, is disclosed a charming
avenue cut through this dense undergrowth,
on a steep sideling bordered with clematis,
wild tobacco plants, native raspberry, and
other luxuriant shrubs, amongst which tower
lofty blue gums ( Eucalyptus hot ry aides),
stringy bark (E. amygdalina) , black butt ( E.
pilularis) , and other eucalypti, interspersed
with clumps of sassafras ( Doryophora sassa-
fras), acacias, and tree ferns ( Alsophila
australis, and DicJcsonia antarctica) of an
unusual height. The cause of this sudden
change is at once apparent. The upper bank
of the road is studded with boulders of
basaltic rock, a dyke of which has burst
through and overcapped the sandstone, and
its disintegration has formed the rich black
chocolate-coloured soil which has favoured
this special vegetation. A rise of 260 feet
in less than half a mile leads to the summit
of the ridge, which extends in an east-north-
east direction for about 10 miles, but has not
been fully explored for more than half that
distance. Bounded on all sides by steep
thickly-wooded slopes, penetrable with diffi-
culty by man or beast, and by precipitous
cliffs, this remarkable oasis appears to have
been scarcely visited until 10 years ago,
except by Mr. Surveyor Govett, who tra-
versed the western portion of it in 1832.
In 1869 the present road up the mountain
was cut by the Government, and the richer
portion of the land measured for sale; it
remained, however, unnoticed until 1875,
when the sixty-two allotments previously
measured, and containing in all about 1,025
acres, were taken up by thirty-three pur-
chasers. The distance of Mount Wilson
from the Railway,* and the large amount of
available land, barren as it is, within easier
access, has hitherto militated against its
settlement ; but there can be little doubt in
the minds of those who have once visited it,
that it will eventually become a favourite
resort by those requiring a change from the
relaxing climate of Sydney, as it affords a
climate as bracing as that of Tasmania, and
a vegetation and scenery not inferior to that
of New Zealand. In the winter season occa-
sional falls of snow occur, and ice lies in the
shady spots for several days together—the
thermometer falling at night as low as 22°
Eahr., and for weeks in succession below
freezing point, but the shelter afforded by
the vegetation protects the locality from the
bleakness experienced in the more exposed
parts of the mountains; and in June and
July it is not uncommon on still bright
mornings to find the thermometer standing
at 60° in the sun, while the frost still lies
unthawed in the shade. The summit of the
ridge is chiefly covered with a dense growth
of eucalypti (the mere trunks of which almost
obscure the horizon), and in the undergrowth
it is no exaggeration to say that thousands
of tree ferns, ranging up to 30 feet in
height, are visible in every direction ;itis on
the southern slopes that the sassafrax jungle
is found, in which mosses and orchids luxu-
riate, and festoons of lianes hang from the
topmost branches. There are two peculi-
in this vegetation which are worthy
of notice : (1) that the tree ferns ( Alsophila
australis) frequently bifurcate at a short
distance from the ground, and in many cases
divide into three or four, and sometimes into
five and six stems, from one root; (2) that
tree-ferns (which must be of very ancient
date) are frequently almost entirely absorbed
by the growth of forest trees \Quintinia
sieberii) which germinating in the axles of
their fronds, send down suckers to the ground,
and enclose within their solid timber the fern
stems from which they derived their first
support. In some cases are seen ferns which,
having attained a growth of 20 feet in height,
have been laid low by the wind, and where
some portion of their heads have touched
the ground a second growth of equal altitude
has succeeded, which, in its turn, has been
subsequently enclosed by a quintinia of large
diameter, while the roots of the original tree-
fern still retain their vitality. The measured
lands on Mount Wilson include the greater
part of the rich basaltic formation, inter-
spersed with poorer sandstone soil, which
frequently leads to abrupt precipices form-
ing its boundaries ; from the edge of
these, extensive views are obtained over the
broken uninhabited ranges and gorges which
* About 8 miles, by Bell’s line of road. After
the turning-off to Mount Wilson, “ Bell’s Line ” con-
tinues to take a south-east direction for nearly 2
miles, and then follows up a ridge to the north-east,
between the waters of Bowen’s Creek and the
affluents of the Grose, passing Mount Bell on the
right, and “The Haystack” on the left, towards
Mount Tomah and the Kurrajong.


surround it in all directions. This scenery
extends as far as Capertee, 32 miles dis-
tant. From other points the dividing ranges
forming the watershed of the Hunter River
are visible (Warra W^olong, distant 60 miles
in one direction, and Werong and Coricudgy,
50 miles in another), while from the cliffs
first mentioned as lying to the right hand of
the traveller when ascending the mountain,
the view (including 180° of the horizon) has
been considered almost unsurpassed on _ the
Blue Mountains ; it embraces Barranjuey
(Broken Bay Heads), on the horizon to the
east, and Mount Jelore (60 miles distant),
to the south; the Flagstaff Hill, Mounts
Victoria, King George, Hay, and Tomah, and
the Haystack in the middle distance ; and
the northern watershed of Bowen and Wol-
langambe Creeks, a succession of broken
ravines more than a thousand feet below the
stand-point, form the foreground.” Mr.
E. C. Merewether, Mr. E. King Cox, Mr.
Wynne, the Hon. J. B. Wilson, Mr. Henry
Stephen, and others, are the owners of land
in this picturesque and beautiful locality.
Clarence Siding Platform, 88 miles; 3,658
feet above sea-level— The Line having made a
slight descent between Mount Victoria and
the Hartley Vale Siding, rises 160 feet before
it reaches the Mount Wilson Platform, and
continues to rise 180 feet more during the
next 5 miles to the north-west, when (at
the Clarence Siding) its greatest altitude is
attained —upwards of 3,650 feet. Here there
are signs of cultivation, a large siding, and
several houses for persons employed upon
the Line. At a short distance to the west
of the platform there is a tunnel, 539 yards
in length, lined with cemented masonry
throughout. The Mount Clarence Tunnel is
about a mile on the Sydney side of the Lith-
gow Valley Zigzag. The features of the
country hereabouts were such that the sur-
veyors who marked out the Line had to be
lowered down over the rocks with ropes, the
contractor having also to commence his work
in a similar way. Emerging from the long
dark tunnel the traveller finds abundant
occupation in looking about him as he is
whirled, in perfect safety, down the Great
Zigzag, one of the greatest wonders of the
colony—perhaps, it may be said, of the
world.
The Lithgow Valley Zigzag, 92 miles.—
The Lithgow Valley, or Great Zigzag, 15
miles on the Bathurst side of the Mount
Victoria Station, has been thus compre-
hensively described by Mr. Burton: —“Some
of the cuttings through hard stone are from
40 to 50 feet deep, the gradient of the
Line being 1 in 42, with the exception of
one part near the reversing station, which
is 1 in 66. The height of the nine arches
crossing No. 3 Viaduct on the middle
line is 76 feet from the surface to the
rail level. Just beyond the tunnel (about
the middle of the Zigzag), which is 75 yards
long and cut through the spur of the rock,
is the scene of a great blasting operation.
Three and a half tons of gunpowder, deposited
in borings made in different parts of the rock
to be removed, were fired simultaneously by
means of a powerful electric battery, by the
Countess of Belmore. The next cutting is
80 feet high. There are several _ other cut-
tings and embankments, which it is unneces-
sary to particularise. The fall from the
Clarence Tunnel to the bottom of the Zigzag
is 687 feet; and the length in which this
descent has been gained is 5 miles. _ A
tolerably good view of this great engineering
achievement may be obtained from the spurs
which form the boundary-line of the gully.
The best view, however, is undoubtedly to
be obtained from the bottom of the gully
itself. The cost of this part of the Railway
was between £20,000 and £25,000 per mile.
Visitors can go from Mount Victoria to the
Zigzag by the goods train in the morning,
and return again by the passenger train in
the afternoon. They will be put down at
the foot of the Zigzag if previous notice is
given to the guards.” Near the point-house,
at the foot of the Zigzag, is the entrance to
a picturesque well-watered ravine, running
for some distance back into the mountain,
and a favourite place in summer for excur-
sion picnics. A stream flows out from the
spot, joining Farmer’s Creek about a mile
below the “ Lower Points.”
Eskbank Platform, 95 miles; 3,033 feet above
sea-level. —The Eskbank Platform, over 600
feet below the Clarence Siding, is the first
stopping-place arrived at after the train gets
clear of the Great Zigzag, and so enters the
Lithgow Valley. The traveller now finds
himself in a long enclosed valley, with well-


LITHGOW VALLEY COLLIERY. (Seepage 64.)


wooded hills on either side of him and a
pretty murmuring stream (Farmer’s Creek)
running near the Line in a westerly direc-
tion. Eskbank is 3 or 4 miles on the
Bathurst side of the Zigzag, and makes a
very pleasant impression on the traveller as
he enters it; the comfortable, old-fashioned
mansion of Mr. Thomas Brown, being near
the platform to the right. Although still in
a country of great elevation, the “ Moun-
tains ” may be considered to have been
passed ; and travellers must be pleased to
see that the adjacent roads are all in a
good and serviceable state. The industrial
establishments of Eskbank will be treated of
under the head of Lithgow, to which rising
township it immediately adjoins.
Lithgow Station, 96 miles; 3,006 feet above
sea-level— “ Attention,” says a journalist,
“ has rather despondently been drawn to the
supposed circumstance that an extension of
railway to some retired inland towns, both
here and in England, not only fails perma-
nently to advance their relative importance,
but even that such a direct connection with
the more stirring centres of population and
commercial activity appears frequently and
actually to cause a sort of retrogressive
effect —especially when the “ Line ” passes
further on into the depths of a hitherto
wholly undeveloped country. There is, as
in all such generalizations, no doubt a
certain degree of truth in that remark ; but
it by no means conveys the true assertion of
an absolute and general fact, for very often
a decaying inland town (like Parramatta,
for example, in this colony) will, through
the action of a railway, gradually —and in
the most astonishing manner —revive and
receive a new and healthy impetus ; such
an unexpected reinvigoration as may also be
seen already manifesting itself at Bathurst
and elsewhere. Nor is that all; for in
many places (such as Lithgow and Blayney,
for example) which but for the Railroad
must have remained mere picturesque soli-
tudes, the arrival of the “iron horse” has
shown a really marvellous tendency to create
industrial centres, thriving townships, and
busy populous communities. We may take
Lithgow as an instance of this creative
action of the railway everywhere, and espe-
cially in such a country as New South
Wales.”
General description of Lithgow.— Lithgow,
96 miles from Sydney and 49 miles east of
Bathurst, is now a rising Mining and Indus-
trial Township, situated in the wider and
westerly portion of that secluded, rocky, glen
into which the Western Railway abruptly
descends by the well-known “ G-reat Zigzag.”
This Town, called into existence by the Rail-
way, and not above five years old, already
numbers about 2,000 inhabitants; having
several excellent Hotels, Stores, and Dwell-
ing-houses, with a handsome and commo-
dious Bank, Telegraph Office, Public School,
Insurance Offices, Assembly Rooms, Club
Houses, and such like Commercial and Social
Institutions. Everywhere substantial Build-
ings are in the course of erection in its long
wide streets, and every day new_ sign
of the rapid development of this Railway
Township is forced upon the observation of
the astonished visitor. The present number
of houses is over 300. “Lithgow” stands
in the entrance, or more open part of Lith-
gow Valley —a picturesque locality, enclosed
by precipitous, well-wooded mountains, and
is undeniably a place which but for The Rail-
way would most certainly have remained to
the end of time (as it did for countless ages
after creation, and for many long years
subsequent to the foundation of this Colony)
unknown to the civilized world, and utterly
useless and unproductive. In this town and
its immediate neighbourhood are four col-
lieries in active operation, with Iron Works,
Pottery and Terra Cotta Works, Copper
Smelting Works, a Lime-kiln, a Tweed Fac-
tory, a Tannery, a Brewery, and such like
Industries. Coal is, of course, cheap and
good, and firewood (as yet) abundant.
Water also is plentiful and of an excellent
quality. At almost all of the collieries coal
is readily obtained by running “ drives” into
the hill sides, which is a decided economy of
labour. Hood pipeclay and fireclay are to
be found everywhere, and potteries and brick-
kilns are therefore attached to most of these
establishments.
The Lithgow Valley Colliery Company’s
Works are carried on at the distance of
about a quarter of a mile from the Telegraph
Office, and the principal Inn (the “ Commer-
cial Hotel,” by Mr. Richard Blackford) ;
and close to the mouth of the colliery the
same company are engaged in Brick, Pipe,


and Tile Making. The seam of coal operated
upon by the Lithgow Valley Coal Company,
under _ the general management of Mr.
Kerr, is 10 feet in thickness, and is worked
from the “ adit." There is a tramway with
a siding to the adjacent Trunk Line, by
means of which the coal can in all weathers
be expeditiously despatched to the market.
The coal, on “ skips” or trucks is drawn
out laterally from the mine by a small steam-
engine with a tail rope of wire. The daily
out-put is on an average 100 tons. In
1876 the annual out-put was 11,300 tons.
The tramway on entering this mine follows
the dip of the seam for about a quarter of a
mile, and then the skips are loaded from the
workings. The coal is finally transferred
from the skips by a platform and shoot at
the pit mouth into the waggons, in which it
is thence taken away to the Line by Govern-
ment engines. The number of men con-
stantly employed on this colliery is twenty.
Two horses are engaged for wheeling the
coal in the skips inside of the mine. The
Brick and Tile Works of the same Company
adjacent to the mine, within half a mile
of the Railway, are well deserving of a visit.
Here (by machinery) are made fire-bricks,
pressed bricks, and common bricks. They
also make sanatory drain-pipes (for sewers)
of a very superior quality, and of large
size—frqm 3 inches to 2 feet in diameter.
Drain pipes of a small size, for the purpose
of draining land, are also here made to order
for agriculturists. These are from 2 inches
in diameter up to 6 inches. Tiles of various
shapes and colours are here also deftly
manufactured. A first-class machine is here
now in the course of erection for the pur-
pose of making bricks by steam, and this
w hen completed will enable the Company to
out 12,000 bricks per diem, and to
furnish tiles of various descriptions to order,
with equal expedition and perfect finish!
The bricks are made by the dry process and
by the semi-plastic process. Clay for that
purpose abounds; and the fire-clay (sup-
posed to be quite equal to any found in the
Australian colonies) is all obtained from the
shale, crushed by a 66 disintegrator’’ worked
by steam. In the kilns the bricks, pipes,
and mouldings for windows, &c., &c., are
burnt by the over-draft. The fire-bricks
here made have been well tested, and have
been proved to be of far better quality than
those commonly sent out from the Home
Country. In the Brick and Tile Works of
the Lithgow Valley Coal Company there is
a steam-engine ot 40-horse power, working
with a wire rope on a barrel, by means of
which coal is not only brought up for imme-
diate consumption on a tramway from the
Pit Mouth, but all the elaborate machinery
is moved for the Pipe, Tile, and Brick
making. The same engine is also connected
with a pump to keep water out of the mine,
and to supply the same element for the brick-
making, &c. There are large sheds for dry-
ing the Bricks, Pipes, and Tiles; and hard
by also stand constantly shifting stacks of all
that has been manufactured for sale. The
Brick-Making Machine on a new model (by
Whitehead, ot Preston, in Lancashire) is
the first of the kind ever imported into this
Colony. The new “ disintegrator” works at
500 revolutions per minute, having a double
motion of the wheels. To an enquiring mind
all the details of this elaborate machinery
(including mixing pan, pug mill, &c.) for
moulding and making these pipes, with a
wonderful speed and precision, are extremely
interesting. The pipes can be made of what-
ever sizes or patterns may be required. The
products of these works are taken down, by
a small tramway, to the siding of the Bail-
way, which runs back from the Line to the
mouth of the coal mine. Besides the gene-
ral manager (Mr. Kerr) there is superin-
tendent or upper manager, named Mr. John
Doig. The Company consist of Messrs.
Higgins, Gell, Wilton, Busby, and Coombes.
The Eskbank Iron and Coal Company’s
Whrks are about a mile or so to the eastward
ot the Lithgow Valley Colliery on the north
side of the Line, near what is known as
“The Eskbank Siding.” These Works,
extending over a level area of 700 acres,’
stand near the steep slopes of several
thickly-wooded hills, a locality well adapted
in every respect by nature and by art
to its present appointed purpose. A peren-
nial stream of good water, having its source
in the adjacent heights, flows through the
property of the Company ; and the ore
operated upon is found in quantities on the
low flat near the foundry (just beneath the
surface) and on a neighbouring hill to the
E

north-east. Coal may be readily procured
for this company on the ground, and in a
colliery immediately adjoining to the Rail-
way ; and freestone, loam, and sand are all
ready to hand. Here the Proprietary Com-
pany have a large Blast Eurnace —capable of
producing from 100 to 120 tons of pig iron
per week—a 70-horse-power engine, two
boilers, and all other needful apparatus.
There is also a Foundry connected with the
great furnace producing castings for the
Rolling Mills. The Company make their own
castings for use, and can supply whatever
may be in demand. They have likewise a
puddling furnace for converting “ pigs” into
malleable iron ; and their Rolling Mills,
recently erected, are capable of rolling 100
tons per week. A recent reliable authority
( Essay on New South Wales, p. 76) states
that the ores in the area of these works con-
sist of—“ (1) Beds of clayband stone, vary-
ing from 6 to 15 inches thick, cropping out
of the surface and averaging 40 per cent, of
metal; (2) red silicious ore, of which the
bed is about 4 feet, yielding 22 per cent. ;
and (3) a bed 2 feet of brown hematite,
'yielding 50 per cent. A 10-feet seam of
splint-coal crops out on the property, over-
lying a seam of fire-clay, from which fire-
bricks have been made which have stood the
severest test of the Mint Assayer.” Com-
modious houses for the miners and other
employes of the Company (quite a neat little
village) stand at the north-east corner of the
area of the works. The Eskbank Iron and
Coal Company (who have here manifested
an intelligence, public spirit, and enterprise,
beyond all praise) of course make their own
fire-bricks for their furnaces from the clay
found on their land. The Manager of the
Works is Mr. E. Hughes, who first discovered
the peculiar capabilities of the site, and who
is understood to have formed the Company.
In addition to the large area occupied by these
works, it is only fair to say that the Com-
pany have also 1,400 acres ot land containing
well nigh inexhaustible supplies of iron ore,
limestone, and coal within 10 miles of the
works, and close to the AYallerawang Rail-
way Station. The foundation stone of these
"Works was laid by the Hon. John Suther-
land, the Minister for AYorks, on the 2nd of
January, 1875, and they were completed
in December in that year.
The Eskbank Colliery is owned by Mr.
Thomas Brown, whose pleasant, old-
fashioned country seat is in the immediate
vicinity. This colliery, (which immediately
adjoins the Railway on its southern side) is
worked by a steam-engine, platform, and
shoot, &c., and commands every facility for
sending off the coal produced. The engine
is of 12-horse power, and the shoot ot an
approved construction; the out-put being
about 170 tons per diem. The out-put at
this colliery in 1876 was 28,702 tons, valued
at £7,876. It is from this colliery that sup-
plies of coal to the neighbouring Ironworks
are usually made. The coal is sent thither
by means of a small tramway, which crosses
the Line by going over the Railway Bridge.
This pit is one of the ordinary character,
and is at present only 78 feet deep. Besides
supplying the Ironworks and other cus-
tomers, Mr. Brown’s Colliery also supplies
the requisite fuel for the adjacent Copper-
Smelting Works, which is worked by a Com-
pany. The Manager of the Eskbank Colliery
is Mr. William Pitt.
The Eskbank Copper Smelting AYorks are
carried on close to Mr. Brown’s Colliery,
under the management of Mr. Henry James.
This interesting and valuable industry is
going on prosperously; the ore, here con-
verted into shining ingots of copper, being
forwarded to this spot by rail from different
parts of the country, and chiefly from the
AYestern District. The principal shareholder
in the Company is Mr. Lewis Lloyd, well
known for his energy and enterprise in this
particular direction.
Higher up the Lithgow A T alley (but still
in the immediate vicinity of Lithgow) are
the spacious Slaughter Houses designed by
the late Mr. T. S. Mort for service in con-
nection with the well known enterprising
Plan of that lamented citizen and _ true
patriot, for freezing meat for exportation to
England. These buildings, constructed after
an admirable design, at an immense expense
of money and labour, are not at present in
use. The establishment has engine-houses
and engines and an unrivalled mechanical
apparatus for ventilating and cleaning these
abattoirs; at which 2,000 sheep a day can
conveniently be slaughtered and dressed.
The whole premises are fitted up in the
most perfect manner, and so arranged that


the temperature can always be kept down to
50 degrees Fahrenheit. Meat can here be
kept without damage for eight days, and
then with due care be successfully pre-
served. The fan of the engine for driving
the air and ventilating the place can makl
AUOO revolutions in a minute. Mort’s
Slaughter-house and Stores for Preserved
Meat are on the same side of the Line as the
Lskbank Ironworks.
The Yale of Clwydd Colliery Works stand
south side of the Eailway, further up
the T alley, and nearer to the Zigzag, at
the edge of a swampy glen, through which
there is now a very fair road leading (by a
short cut) directly over a gap in the moun-
tains to Hartley and Hartley Yale. The
I ale of Clwydd Colliery, though close to
Lithgow, is shut out from it by a gentle
eminence. A sort of village, or rather
hamlet, embosomed in the hills and woods
has here sprung up, the miners’ homes in
this spot being perhaps less comfortable
than picturesque. Their habitations are
tor the most part, huts of mud or wood •
but some, manifesting an Arab-like inde-
pendence, apparently prefer to live in tents.
he Works are under the management of
Mr. Wilson. In this colliery there is a per-
pendicular shaft sunk to about 250 feet
below the surface; and from this shaft there
are long “drives ” in various directions, the
prevalence of water in one of them, which
runs under a neighbouring swamp,being often
rather troublesome to the engineer, and in-
convenient to the miners. The Yale of
Clwydd Colliery has a contract with the
Government, and commands a weekly out-
put of as much as 1,400 tons. Good lime-
stone is found with the coal, and is burned
on the spot for use, and for sale. Here
also (as in the neighbourhood of Mr. T.
Brown’s Colliery) Copper Smelting Works
have been established. A tramway connects
this colliery with the Western Eailway.
About a mile or so from Lithgow, on the
other (western) side of the Township, and
not far from the Bowenfels Station, is a
I weed Factory built by Mr. Andrew Brown
leased to Mr. H. Y. Hunter. In
this long brick and stone building (which
contrasts curiously with Mr. A. Brown’s
pretty rural homestead and gardens), about
lorty hands find constant and remunerative
employment. In the factory are 24 power
looms, three sets of carding machines, and
ail the other requisite appliances ; £lB,OOO
having been here invested in the best and
most recently devised machinery. 4,0'
yards of good tweed are here man
tactured every week; the beautiful fabr
so made finding a ready sale at Sydn
and in the adjacent colonies, where (fo:*
the integrity of its workmanship) it
justly esteemed. The wool used is of cour
Colonial brought from the interior to th
spot by the railroad, and here prepared f
use. The machinery is driven by stea
and water-power—the latter being suppliec.
hrough a race brought from a never-failin
streamlet, miles distant. Cottages ha\
been erected for the workpeople near to th
walls of the Factory. To the south of th
.factory, on the road towards Hartley—a
the distance of a mile or so, and soon afte
you have passed the village near the statioi
there is a Tannery. At Bowenfels Station
near the Tweed Factory, there is yet anothe
Colliery, from which in 1876 7,528 tons o
coal were obtained.
Excursion from Lithgow to Hartley.—
A pleasant excursion may be made from
Lithgow to Hartley, either on horseback o
in a buggy ; starting from Lithgow at ai
early hour, and going round the mountain
past Bowenfels. Bowenfels and Hartley
two small townships on the Old Western Eoad
are separated from the Lithgow Valley by
steep chain of sandstone hills, forming s,
spur or off-shoot of the Blue Mountain
flange to the westward. These eminences,
on their southern face, terminate abruptly
towards the Valley of Hartley, in boldly
defined precipices, which go by the fanciful
name of Hassan s AValls ” and overhang
the road, south-easterly, to Hartley, for
several miles. The views from the summits
of these grey masses of rock are said to
be grand _ and extensive ; and along the
irregular line which they disclose and guard
are several cascades, and almost inaccessible
glens, of more wildness, perhaps, than
From the heights of “ Hassan’s
Walls ” the country in the direction of
Mudgee and of Bathurst is distinguishable
for a great distance. The tourists’ road
from Lithgow lies first to the westward,
along the side of the Railway, for rather more

TWEED FACTORY, BOWENFELS. (See page 69.)


than a mile ; he then turns sharply off to
the left (near the schoolhouse to the east of
Coerwull) and so follows down the Old Road,
southerly, as far as Bowenfels, just round
the end of the mountain range. In this road
there is much agreeable scenery —first, Mr.
Hunter’s Tweed Eactory, away in the fields,
with Mr. A. Brown’s bouse and gardens ;
then a tannery, a good country house, and
an old road-side inn; then a quaint old
church and churchyard ; and last, not least,
a Lock-up. This is Bowenfels. On gaining
the elevated ground, to the west of the end
of the sandstone range, a fine view of the
Hartley Valley is obtained. When you get
round into Bowenfels another and more ex-
tensive view is opened up to the south-east
—looking down towards the Victoria Pass.
The now somewhat decayed village of
Bowenfels has still many large houses in it,
and is a cheerful, healthy, and pleasantly
situated spot. By a turn in the road, soon
after leaving it en route for Hartley, you
come full in sight of “ Hassan’s Walls,” at
an end of which (to the southward) towers a
curiously isolated rock, presenting a
singularly exact facial outline peculiar to
the “ Great Iron Duke,” but loyally and
rather absurdly called “ King George’s
Head ” —being, probably one of the dis-
coveries of the Georgian Era. Some of the
distant country of the Great Cunimbla
Valley may now be perceived as you come
down the winding road ; where, in many of
its essential features of copse, headland, and
streamlet there is a great resemblance to
the scenery of South Devon in England.
The road itself is pretty, and along it are
poor but picturesque homesteads —such as
cottages and gardens, old inns with oak
trees, and other attractive features —until
you reach the end of the wall of cliffs already
mentioned. Then there is a dull mile or two
before you come to the edge of the deep
descent into Hartley, standing on the rocky
banks of the murmuring Lett, about a mile
or so above the point where it falls into the
river Cox, draining the whole region from
beyond Bowenfels until it finally falls into
the Wollondilly. At the foot of the last
hill you pass over the Lett by a very fair
wooden bridge, and so, entering Hartley,
you find it a quaint old-fashioned place.
Here you can put up at the Village Inn
(Mrs. Rachael Evans), and either return by
the road you came, or (sending hack the
horse or trap) regain the Line by walking on
to Mount Victoria. Or you may ride across
the mountain to the north, over “ the Gap,”
and so back again into Lithgow. Eor an
invalid or an over-wrought jaded man there
can be few more acceptable retreats than
Hartley. It has two pretty stone churches, a
Court House, and a store or two, but it is quite
a rural village. The distance from Lithgow to
Hartley, as above indicated, is about 10 miles.
Across the mountain, by the new road over
the “ Gap,” it is not more than 6.
Bowenfels Station, 97 miles, 2,972 feet
above sea-level.— Bowenfels station — 3 or 4
miles north of the town of Bowenfels, and
I mile north-west of Lithgow—is by no
means a large place, the majority of the
houses being at Cooerwull, a short distance
from the Line. The District is agricultural,
pastoral, and mining. The surrounding
country is mountainous and well wooded.
Between this place and the next Railway
Station —Wallerawang to the north-west —
there is a rather dreary track, with tunnels
and cuttings.
Marrangaroo Platform, 101 miles; 3,073
feet above sea-level. —Marrangaroo is a
Platform, 4 miles west of Bowenfels Sta-
tion, and 4 miles east of Wallerawang. It
is one of the most elevated spots between
the great Zigzag and Bathurst.
Wallerawang Station, 105 miles; 2,928 feet
above sea-level.— Wallerawang is a small but
busy place, being the spot where the road to
Mudgee joins on to the Great Western
Line. At Wallerawang will end the pro-
posed Branch Line connecting Mudgee with
this Railway. Wallerawang has a small
street, with a few houses —Anglican, Roman
Catholic, Presbyterian, and Wesleyan Places
of Worship —and a Public School. The Inns
are—-the “Royal Hotel,” kept by John Shaw;
the “Commercial Hotel,” kept by J. Hill; and
the “ Railway Inn,” kept by J. Clotworthy.
Here the tourist may take Cobb’s Coach to
Mudgee (away to the north-north-west) and
arrive there in a few hours. Mudgee is the
centre of an extensive and important mining
district. Coaches run from Wallerawang to
Coolah, Mudgee, Gulgong, Mundooran, Gil-
gandra, Coonamble, Walgettand districts.


Rydal Station, 111 miles; 3,117 feet above
sea-level.— Soon after passing Wallerawang
the Line trends sharply to the south-west, and,
rising to a somewhat higher level, passes to
the eastward of Honeysuckle Hill. Before
the Line takes its southerly turn the road to
Eylstone (which has been running near to
the rails) branches off to the northward.
Eydal is but a small place, with a quaint
looking stone church and three inns. These
inns are the “ Globe Hotel” (Jane Green) ;
the “Freemasons’ Hotel” (James Gale); and
the “ Commercial Hotel ” (Thomas Warren).
Country adjacent—agricultural and pastoral ;
rugged mountain scenery, and heavily
timbered. Near Eydal, on the southern side
of the line, is the extraordinary rock known
as “ Evans’ Crown.”
Sodwall’s Platform, 114 miles; 2,850 feet
above sea-level.— After passing Eydal the Line
begins to descend, and continues to do so,
following the winding valley of the Fish
Eiver, towards Bathurst. The country
adjoining the Sodwall’s Platform is of an
agricultural character, with farms and some
sort of cultivation; —rather pretty. The
traveller has now left the County of Cook,
and is pushing on, westerly, through the*
County of Westmoreland. It is hereabouts
that he catches the first glimpse of the Fish
Eiver—a stream which he has to cross nine-
teen times before he finally leaves it, not far
from Macquarie Plains. The Fish Eiver
having joined the Campbell Eiver, a few
miles south of Bathurst, becomes thenceforth
known as the Macquarie, the native name of
which is “ Wambool.” The Macquarie is an
affluent of the Barling.
Parana Station, 120 miles; 2,561 feet above
sea-level— At Tarana Station there is a
watering-place for the engines. It is a
pretty pla ce , but dull. The country appears
to be poor, and the mode of farming rather
careless. The fencing is extremely rude and
picturesque—a mere separation of the land
by felled timber, heaped together. There is
one hotel at Tarana—Fawcett’s. Here you
can get a carriage, or buggy, and go to
Mutton rails, westerly—about 4 miles off.
Irom the Mutton Falls you can ride or
drive to a small township called Oberon
a good agricultural settlement, with mineral
resources and go on thence to the Fish
River Caves. Tarana, 35 miles from t
Fish River Caves, is the nearest point of t'
Line to those vast Limestone Caverns. Ther
is some nice scenery along the road in th
direction.
The Fish River Caves— The celebrate
Limestone Caverns on the Fish River (ne;
0 Connell, in the neighbourhood o;
Bathurst), commonly known as the Fis
River Caves, are of vast extent, anc
singularly attractive; having a great variei
of very intricate galleries, or passages, on]
to he traversed in safety under the care o;
the experienced Local Guide, employed by th
Government. The subterraneous scene
herein disclosed, are indeed magnificent
well worth the time and trouble of payin
them a visit. There is a whole group o
these grand subterraneous halls an
bewildering galleries, and each one of th
series is known by a different name; th
Cave, Lucas’ Cave, the Bell Cave, th
Lurline Cave, &c. Several objects of grea
interest are to be viewed at and in the Fis!
River Caves; and amongst these are the
Great Archway, the Carlotta Arch, the
Meeting of the Creeks, the Pinnacle Rock
the Interiors, the outside entrances, anc
adjacent woodland scenes. The Carlotta
Arch a curious natural archway in the
rocks excites much astonishment anc
admiration. These caves, so remarkable for
their stalactitic and stalagmitic formations
are of such an immense extent that whole
days are necessary for their due exploration.
One of these enormous caverns is estima-
ted to be not less than 500 feet in height,
and of a proportionate length and breadth.’
The strange forms, gradually assumed by
the drippings of the limestone rocks through-
out, are almost infinite, and not to be any-
where else surpassed in beauty. In one
place there is the weird, rock-like semblance
of a well-stocked menagerie ; and in another
place the pendants from the roof and slabs
below are of a still more fantastic and
extraordinary character. When lighted up
with the magnesium wire these sublime
“which Nature’s hands have deftly
formed,” present a truly gorgeous spectacle,
being filled with delicate pendants and
drooping sprays, gigantic columns and
shadowy arches—all resplendent with
dazzling, illusive gems. In the “ New Cave”


COLLIERY, VALE OF CLWYDD. (See page 69.)


the scene developed by the magnesium light
is described (by Burton) as “ one of sur-
passing loveliness,” _ the appearance of
heavy fall of snow being produced ; the roots
in the rear presenting to the imagination
black, frowning sky. Occasionally a spark-
ling waterfall heightens the effect of the
scene. _ The caves are in the charge of M
Jeremiah Wilson, who receives a small r
muneration from the Grovernment. It wa
found desirable to place them under coutm ,
as visitors often committed ruthless destruc
tion. The Grovernment has had constructec
a number of wire ladders for the convenience
of visitors in ascending and descending som
of the caves. To visit the caves comfortabl
the best way to proceed is for a number o': 5
friends to form themselves into a party. Th
party will have to provide their own blanket
and camping equipments. They may eithe
take their own provisions or procure them
from Mr. J. Wilson—theguide. If requester,
(by letter) Mr. Wilson will meet a party
at either Tarana or Bowenfels Station, with
horses or a wagonette. It will greatly lessen
the fatigue of the journey from Tarana to the
Fish Biver Caves, and increase the comfor;
of the tourists if the party of excursionists
stop for the night, en route , at Oberon, where
there are three hotels and very fair accom-
modation. We present our readers with
some excellent illustrations of the Fish Biver
Caves.
Locksley Platform, 130 miles; 2,428 feet
above sea-level. —The country in the neigh-
bourhood of Locksley Platform is, on the
whole, not interesting ; but there are views on
the Line near it not unworthy of some notice.
This platform was formerly known as Locke’s.
Macquarie Plains Station, 135 miles; 2,476
feet above sea-level.— Leaving Locke’s Plat-
form behind him to the eastward, the railway
traveller passes through an open, treeless
country ; having only here and there a few
patches of bush. Then undulating plains,
with sheep and cattle feeding, are opened
up and so the traveller, after an interval of
5 miles, finds himself opposite to the well-built
station of Macquarie Plains—being on the
easterly boundary of that singular tract of
country adjoining Bathurst, and giving to
that City one of its distinctive appellations.
Raglan Station, 140 miles; 2,436 feet abo
sea-level. Eaglan is a Station in the mid
of the Macquarie Plains, where a road fro
the north of that tract joins on to the 0
Western Eoad. Here you first catch a distan
but impressive view of the City of Bathurs
to the westward. At Raglan there is a
Anglican Church and a Public School.
Kelso Station, 143 miles; 2,154 feet abov
sea-level— Kelso Station is the stoppin
place on the Railway for Kelso, a populou
suburb of Bathurst, on the eastern side o
the Pish River, or (as it is here called) “ Th
Macquarie.” The Bathurst City Station i
milss distant, to the south-westward.
Bathurst Station, 145 miles; 2,153 fee'
above sea-level.— Bathurst, “ The City of the
Plains ” and metropolis of the western
geographical division of the Colony i
situated on the left bank of the Macquarie
River, 145 miles from Sydney. Originally
founded by Governor Macquarie on 7th of
May, 1815, just after the discovery of the
country beyond the Blue Mountains, it has
gradually risen to its present position of
great influence and established wealth. A
whole book might be written about this city,
but the description of it in an “ itinerarv”
must necessarily be very brief; notwithstand-
ing its political, social, and physical import-
ance. A few miles before reaching Bathurst
the traveller cannot help being struck with
the altered appearance of the country.
Instead of wooded mountains and ridges of
sandstone, the eye rests everywhere on a
ne open tract, about 12 miles square,
almost devoid of trees, and covered with a
rich soil. This treeless character becomes
still more confirmed when the traveller passes
the Macquarie Plains Station, but the aspect
of the country is undulating, and even hilly
at times, though usually and familiarly
spoken of as “ Plains.” Bathurst occupies
a commanding situation, on a gradual west-
ward slope down to the Macquarie; with a
beautiful and extensive prospect in every
direction for miles around. Within a few
miles of the city, gold and copper mines are
worked. The climate, like that of a town in
England, is frequently very cold in the
winter months, but extremely healthy and
invigorating. In some respects Bathurst


is entitled to be considered as next in rank
to the Capital. It is laid out in blocks of
10 chains square, with many miles of wide
streets lighted by gas ; and it is the seat of a
Bishopric, both in the Anglican and the
Roman Catholic Churches. There are two
Cathedrals, with colleges in connection with
each of the largest communions, and a hand-
some Presbyterian Church; also a Wesleyan
Church, and other Places of Worship. The
Roman Catholic Cathedral, although not
quite completed, is a noble structure, and
near it stands the convent and its school, in
buildings of an imposing appearance. There
is a School of Arts, with 4,000 volumes,
a fine Hall, excellent stores, Banks, and
Hotels; LocalNewspapersareherepublished,
as at all the principal Inland Towns. The
annual receipts of the Bathurst Hospital
amount, it is said, to over £5OO. Bathurst
enjoys the advantage of a great variety of
local institutions, and was proclaimed a
municipality in 1862. The population of
Bathurst and its environs is now, probably,
considerably over 6,000. At the Bathurst
Station (on the south side of the city) there
is a large and convenient Refreshment Room
for the use of travellers. Persons intending
either to go inland towards Orange, or “ up ”
the line, towards Mount Victoria, will do
well to remember this. The places near
Bathurst are —Black Springs, Box Eidge,
Caloola, Cow Flat, Dirty Swamp, Dunkeld,
Duramana (or Back Creek), Evan s Plains,
Glanmire, The Lagoons, Limekilns, Meadow
Flat, Mitchell’s Creek, Oberon, O’Connell,
Palmer’s Oakey, Peel, Quartz Ridge,
Rockley, Sofala, Trunkey, Turon, and Wattle
Flat. Coaches run from Bathurst to Sofala,
Hill End, and districts.
Perth, Platform, 149 miles; 2,225 feet above
sea-level.— The Platform of Perth, 4 miles
from Bathurst, presents nothing remarkable.
The adjacent country is of an open character,
with peculiar looking bare hills beyond it.
Between Bathurst and Perth several country
residences and farms are passed.
George’s Plains Station, 151 miles; 2,260
feet above sea-level. —There is some fine
scenery, with a wide stretch of arable and
pastoral country —lying between Perth Plat-
form and the George’s Plains Station, a dis-
tance of about 3 miles.
Wimbledon, Platform, 158 miles; 2,737 feet
above sea-level. —The Wimbledon platform
is a convenient stopping place for the inhabi-
tants of an extensive tract of country, 34
miles from Orange and 13 from Bathurst.
Near Wimbledon is the fine country residence
of Mr. Joseph Smith. Between Wimbledon
and the next station a barren tract intervenes.
Newbridge Platform, 164 miles; 2,877 feet
above sea-level. —Newbridge, a rising place,
is the nearest point on the Great Western
Railway to the town of “ Arthur ” and the
Trunkey Diggings, 16 miles distant. Situated
19 miles west of Bathurst, and 28 miles east
of Orange, Newbridge has already 3 Hotels
and numerous other houses springing up.
Near Newbridge good iron fire-clay can
readily he procured. The Bell Flat Diggings
lie away to the left as you come in from
Bathurst, across a beautiful tract of culti-
vated country. Near the Trunkey Creek
Diggings are the Pine Eidge and the Grove
Caves, &c. There is a fine and comprehen-
sive view over the whole country to the
north-east, a mile or two to the westward of
the Newbridge Platform —on the line towards
Blayney, at the Stringy Bark Cuttings.
Newbridge was formerly known as Back
Creek. The name by which it is known in the
Post Office Directory is the aboriginal name
of Duramana. The roads lead south by the
shortest way to Caloola, where alluvial gold
is still being worked, and to Trunkey, lately
the scene of immense activity in quartz-
mining. Great quantities of wool also arrive
at the Station from these parts, so that New-
bridge is likely to become a very important
position in connection with the traffic on the
Great Western Railway. An iron mine has
been opened by a Company within 300 yards
of the Railway Station, and a deposit of asbes-
tos has been discovered about 2 miles away.
Blayney Station, 172 miles; 2,841 feet above
sea-level. —Blayney is one of the new and
rising Townships owing its existence, like
Lithgow, to the Railway. It is quite a new
place, and promises soon to be a large town ;
for it is the centre of a great Squatting Dis-
trict, and is closely connected with mining
interests. It stands on the Belubula River,
only 8 miles from the junction of the roads
from Calder and Grenfell. From this Sta-
tion fat stock are sent “ up ” by the trains

every night in large numbers for the Sydney
Market. There are churches for the Angli-
cans and Presbyterians ; and a _ Homan
Catholic church is building on the right side
of the Line. There are also two large Flour
Mills at work. To the right, as the traveller
goes towards Orange, there is (beyond
Blayney) a curious conical hill. Coaches run
from Blayney to Carcoar, Cowra, and Gren-
fell, and districts.
Spring Grove Station, 179 miles; 3,138 feet
above sea-level.— At this neat little Station,
which stands high, there is a goods shed.
The country around is open bush land, and
used for pastoral purposes.
Spring Hill Station, 183 miles; 3,086 feet
above sea-level— The country hereabouts is
not very interesting. The land, divided by
queer-looking fences, is used for agricultural
and pastoral purposes.
Huntley Platform, 186 miles; about 3,000
feet above sea-level. —A small Platform
between the Spring Hill Station and Orange ;
about six miles from the latter township.
Orange Station, 192 miles; 2,843 feet above
sea-level. —Between Spring Hill and Orange
the railway traveller will find arable land
under cultivation on either side of the Line.
Orange —the present Inland Terminus of the
Great Western Bailway —is one of the most
progressive towns of the Colony, remarkable,
amongst other things, for the unusual excel-
lence of its hotels, stores, and banks. It
adjoins a fertile and wealthy district, and is
the busy centre of a considerable amount of
trade of all kinds, agricultural, pastoral, and
mining. The estimated value of the ratable
property of Orange is said to be already
£26,000 greater than that of the property
within the municipality of West Maitland.
(Tingle .) The town is well laid out; the wide,
well-built streets presenting an imposing and
well nigh metropolitan appearance. Orange
has a School of Arts, a Masonic Hall, a
Hospital, Churches for the lour chief De-
nominations, and other places of Public
Worship. There are two large Schools, a
small but commodious Court house, and three
Local Newspapers. The principal hotels
are —The “ Royal,” kept by J. W. Smith ;
the “ Club House Hotel,” kept by William
Tanner; and the “Telegraph Hotel,” kept
by J. Nightingale. Kenna’s Hotel is oppo-
site to the railway Station, but the majority
of the hotels are away up in the town. The
chief places in the neighbourhood of Orange
are:—Cadia, Cheeseman’s Creek, Lucknow,
Ophir (the first gold-field opened in Aus-
tralia), Byng, Guyong, Heifer Station, Icely,
Springside, &c. The railway is to be ex-
tended from Orange to Wellington and
Dubbo, —and is now in course of construc-
tion. A trial survey has also been completed
for a further extension of the Railway from
Dubbo to Bourke, on the River Darling.
Another trial survey has been completed
between Orange and Forbes and Condobolin
(on the River Lachlan) to the westward of
Orange. This trial survey has been com-
pleted to a spot at some considerable distance
beyond the Lachlan ; and is in progress from
that point to Wilcannia, on the Darling.
Coaches run from Orange to Molong,
Ironbarks, Dubbo, Wellington, Warren,
Cannonbar, Bourke, Brewarrina, Forbes,
Condobolin, and districts.
III.—PARRAMATTA JUNCTION TO WAGGA WAGGA.
(THE SOUTHERN LINE.)
Note.— The first 13 miles on the Railway
out of Sydney, to be traversed by the
Tourist intending to travel on the South-
ern Line, are necessarily upon the Main
Trunk Line, used for Suburban Travelling,
and including the following Stations aud
Stopping-places : Sydney, Eveleigh, McDon-
aldtown, Newtown, Stanmore, Petersham,
Ashfield, Croydon, Burwood ,Bedmyre, Home-
bush, Rookwood, Auburn, and Parramatta
Junction. These stopping-places and sta-
tions will be found already described in the
“ Itinerary,” under the heading of “Sydney
to Parramatta Junction” — Western Main
Trunlc Line. The Itinerary for the South-
ern Line proper must therefore commence
from the “ Parramatta Junction,” where the
Southern Railway separates from the Main
Line—continued on (past Parramatta) to
the westward.


Parramatta Junction Station, 13 miles: 3
feet above sea-leveL-The Railroad, afte
leaving the Parramatta Junction, stretche
nearly due south for some miles, and then take
a turn to the westward. It lies, for the mos
part, through a rather uninteresting and bu
partially cleared tract of country. 3 miles from
the Junction stands the Guilford Platform.
Merrylands Platform, 14 miles; about 70
feet above se a-level.- A Platform, one mil
south of the Parramatta Junction, and two
miles distant from the Guilford Platform.
16 miles ; 88 feet above
’ Guilford is a rather sparsely
populated locality in the neighbourhood o
the southern end of the Old Dog Trap Road
here connecting Parramatta with the Ole
Southern Road.
Fairfield Station, 18 miles; 30 feet above
sea-level.— Fairfield is a pretty sylvan, low-
Jing p ace, with a small population of Far-
mers, Graziers, and Free Selectors. A lame
Reservoir is to be made at Prospect, about a
mile from this Station, wdiich will cover an
area ot about 2 square miles, &c.
Canley Vale Platform, 19 miles; 40 feet
above sea-level.— This is merely a platform,
1 mile to the south of Fairfield.
Cabramatta Platform, 20 miles; 52 feet
above sea-level.-Cabramatta Platform, on a
creek of that name, is a rural place, 2 miles
north-east of Liverpool. There is a village of
this name about 10 miles to the westward,
with which this place must not be confounded.
Liverpool Station, 22 miles; 50 feet above
sea-level.— Liverpool, one of the oldest towns
in the Colony, is 10 miles from Parramatta,
and 12 miles from Campbelltown, by rail.
opulation about 1,400. Four churches—
belonging to the four principal denomina-
tions, one Public School, and two Denomi-
national Schools, and one College for Theo-
logical Students—“ Moore’s College”—at a
short distance from the Town (Church of
England) There is a large Benevolent
Asylum for the Aged and Infirm ; also, seve-
ral industrial establishments, amongst which
are a complete Wool-Washing Establishment
and a large Paper-Mill. Liverpool stands at
the head of the navigation of George’s
Eiver. It was formed into a municipality in
1072. Denham Court, Glenfield, and other
settlements are in the immediate neighbour-
hood. Those who have means and leisure
may here make a pleasant boat excursion
down George’s Eiver to Sans Souci, and
thence go by omnibus or buggy to Sydney.
Liverpool Paper Mills. The property
.consists of 13 acres with frontage to that
extent to George’s Eiver. Buildings cover
an area of 6| acres, built of stone and brick;
machinery, 4 50-horse-power steam-boilers ;
° steam-engines from 10 to 50 horse-power;
12 rag engines; 6 rag and fibre boilers ; 1
very large high-pressure fibre boiler; bleach
house capacity for 30 tons weekly; paper-
making machine, 84 inches wide, speed 100 to
120 feet per minute ; patent cutting and
reppmg and winding machinery ; 4 sets of
callendar rolls ; 1 set chilled American rolls;
2 water-filtering pounds (the largest in the
Australian Colonies) ; pumping engine
capable of drawing 100,000 gallons per hour.
Manufacture—22 to 25 tons weekly news
printing, in sheets and in reels 3 to 4 miles in
ength, for the continuous web news-printing
machine; engine-sized writing papers; royal
hand and brown wrapping-papers. Number
of hands employed in the works, 115 people
with agents all over the Colonies. ’
Established in 1869 by the Australian
1 aper Making Company. Five years in the
present proprietors, hands, who have greatly
improved the property and machinery.
The Company yields a revenue to the
Government Eailways exceeding £2,500
annually ; and the works are connected by a
branch line of rails which runs into the works.
Material used Cotton rags and canvas,
with 50 to 65 per cent, fibre, indigenous to
the Colony ; an important feature in the
manufacturing of news printing when it is
computed that not less than 200 tons is
required weekly in the Southern Hemisphere.
Material used for brown and grey wrap-
pings—Eope, old woolpacks, bagging, and
waste paper, of which there is an ample
supply, and a full demand for the manu-
factured paper.
Coal, 90 to 120 tons weekly required
which is obtained from Eskbank Colliery’
on the western line, of easy access to the
works, the quality of which will compare
favourably with some of the English coal.

neighbourhood here, bounded on the south
by the George s Eiver.
Macquarie Fields Platform, 27 miles; 74
feet above sea-level- -At the Macquarie
iclds there is a fine open country, dotted
over with trees. There are hills and slopes
on either side of the line. The country here
much resembles that near Booty Hill on the
W estern Line.
Campbellfields Platform, 31 miles; 140 feet
above sea-level— Campbellfields is a very
pretty sylvan locality, 3 miles out of Camp-
belltown, on the Sydney side.
Campbelltown Station, 34 miles; 210 feet
above sea-level —Campbelltown, a very old
township, is named after a gentleman who
was Colonial Secretary of New South Wales
in the days of Governor Macquarie. It is
the centre of an agricultural district, and
contains about 600 souls. In the town are
three churches—one for the Anglican (St.
Peters), and the other two for the Homan
Catholics and Congregationalists. There are
also several inns, and one Public School.
Ihe surrounding country, consisting of hills
valleys, and_ plains, is devoted to grazing
and cultivation, and is eminently healthy
and picturesque. In the neighbourhood (10
miles to the south of it) lies the pleasant
little village of Appin, with much fine
scenery not far from it—at Broughton’s
Bass, Jordan’s Pass, Pheasant’s Nest, the
Friendly Falls, and Bulli Pass. The Phea-
S r n !i, S £ est Pass ’ which is at the junction
o the JNepean and Cordeaux Fivers, forms
the starting point of the proposed works for
the supply of the Metropolitan district with
water. A tunnel nearly 5 miles long will
connect the waters of the Nepean and Cata-
ract, and the united streams will feed a
tunnel about 2 miles in length, and by a
series of aqueducts the water will be
brought to a storage reservoir at Prospect
near Blacktown, which when completed, will
have an area of about 2 square miles, and
contain over 7,100 million gallons of water.
1 arliament has authorized the necessary
expenditure for the carrying out of this great
project, and we may expect shortly to see
operations commenced in this locality. From
ampbelltown a road leads across the coun-
try westerly to Glenlee, Narellan, Cobbitty,
and Camden. From Campbelltown Tourists
can start to the southwards for the Illawarra
District. (See Routes.)
Menangle Station, 40 miles; 270 feet above
sea-level— At Menangle the Southern Line
crosses the Nepean by means of a fine tubu-
lar bridge, the rails being 63 feet above the
ordinary level of the river. This bridge and
the adjacent viaduct consists (according to
lr. Tingle) “of wrought iron, continuous
box girders for a double line, 498 feet in
length, extending over three openings of
150 feet clear span each, resting on stone
piers, the masonry being set in Portland
cement. The height of the bridge from the
level of the river to under side of the girders
is 65 feet. The approach on the Sydney, or
, northern side, is 978 feet long, in spans of
26 feet each. The approach on the southern
side is of timber, 432 feet in length, in spans
of 26 feet.” In the vicinity are numerous
fine grazing farms, with agricultural patches
F


laid out on the alluvial flats. Menangle has
an Anglican and a Roman Catholic Church,
and two schools. There is a grand and com-
prehensive view of the country from the
Line ontheCampbelltownsideof Menangle —
about a couple of miles from the bridge,
with Razorback in the distance.
Douglass Park Station, 45 miles; 396 feet
above sea-level.—Douglass Park is an agri-
cultural settlement, named after the late
Hon. H. G. Douglass, M.D. It is 5 miles
from Menangle Bridge on the southern side.
Picton Station, 53 miles; 549 feet above
sea-level.— Picton (formerly called “ Stone-
quarry”) is a pretty country town, 13 miles
from Menangle, on the banks of Stonequarry
Creek. Between Menangle and Picton the
line rises 279 feet, passing through a
country rather interesting and pretty, espe-
cially as you approach Picton. The land
here is principally devoted to grazing, and
held under old Government grants. Popu-
lation of the township, including the envi-
rons, about 500 souls. There are churches
for the Anglicans and Roman Catholics,
a Public School, and good hotel accommoda-
tion for travellers. It is not far from the
sunken valley of Burragorang, in the
vicinity of which are some beautiful moun-
tain scenes. The Railway Viaduct at Picton
is a work of considerable importance. It is
built of masonry, set in cement, and consists
of five openings of 40 feet each. Its entire
length is 276 feet, and its height, from foun-
dations to rail level, 78 feet. The Tunnel
beyond this, to the south of the town
(through the Redbank Range), is 198 yards
long.
Picton Lakes Platform, 59 miles; 1,074 feet
above sea-level- —Leaving Picton, and emer-
ging from the Redbank Tunnel, the line during
the next 7 miles continues to rise, until, at a
place known as the “Picton Lakes,” it attains
to an elevation of 525 feet above the Station
of Picton. Here there is a platform, with a
watering-place for the engines. The water is
pumped up from several large lagoons to the
west of the Line, down in a singular, precipi-
tous valley close by. Hence the name of
this platform. This retired and beautiful
spot is a favorite place with excursionists.
Rush’s Platform, 74 miles; 1,946 feet above
sea-level. —Rush’s Platform is named after
Mr. Rush’s Family Hotel, in the immediate
vicinity. There is much lovely scenery in
this healthy locality, which is about 3 miles
from Nattai and Mittagong.
Mittagong Station, 77 miles; 2,069 feet
above sea-level. —Mittagong and Nattai —to
all intents and purposes the same place —
lie in an elevated region, being oyer 2,000
feet above the level of the sea. Mittagong
has around it a pastoral and agricultural
neighbourhood. Its mineral resources are
coal and iron; the Fitzroy Iron Mines at
Nattai being immediately There
are also several fine freestone quarries, and
chalybeate springs. The place is a favourite
resort for invalids, and has some romantic
forest scenery. 2 miles from the station,
on the southern side, is the Gibraltar
Tunnel, probably the longest in these colo-
nies, being 572 yards from end to end.
This tunnel is named after a remarkable
Pass, the cliff over which is called the Gib-
raltar Rock. The tunnel has been cut
through hard shale and sandstone, and is
lined throughout with brickwork and
cement. The scenery between Mittagong
and Bowral is deservedly admired for its
wild and picturesque character. The trains
either way pass each other at the Mittagong
Station every afternoon and night, and
passengers are here allowed 20 minutes
to refresh themselves. Parties going right
through should remember this.
The Joadja Kerosene Mine.— To any one
interested in the industrial progress of the
Colony and the development of its natural
resource’s a visit to the Joadja Kerosene
Mine would prove highly interesting. The
works are about 16 miles from the Mitta-
gong Railway Station, and can be reached
for part of the distance in a buggy, and the
remainder of the way by means of a light
tramway which the Company has con-
structed. This tramway commences from
the mine, and is worked by a locomotive,
miles. After leaving the railway station
the traveller proceeds for about 3 miles
along the road to Berrima, passes on his
way the Fitzroy Iron Mines, and takes a
turn to the right, which brings him to the
tramway terminus, 7 miles from Mittagong.


INCLINE, JOADJA CREEK. (See page 84.)


It is proposed to extend the tramway into
Mittagong, where it will join on to the main
line of the Great Southern Eailway, and
thereby reduce the time of transit from the
mine to two hours.
The mine is situated in a most picturesque
valley, through which runs a stream known
as the Joadja Creek. The valley is almost
surrounded by high mountains, and acces-
sible only by foot passengers, by means
of a path down a very steep descent, along
which for the purpose of hauling up the
shale a tramway has been constructed. The
trucks are lowered by a steel wire rope,
controlled and worked by a fixed engine at
the head of the incline. The distance from
the engine-house to the foot of the mountain
is over 3,000 feet, —the incline for 1,500 feet
being 1 in 2, and the remainder of the way
varying from that to 1 in 20.
The entrance to the mine is prettily situa-
ted on the brow of one of the hills, at an
elevation of about 500 feet from the bottom
of the gully. The distance into the main
drive of the mine is 680 feet; the other
tunnels, which branch oif right and left, vary
from 150 to 200 feet in length. These
drives and tunnels are well ventilated by the
air being drawn through the mine, and regu-
lated by a large furnace and air chimney.
The valley is rendered most interesting
not only through its natural beauty but also
by the substantial retorts, purifiers, and other
buildings erected by the Company. There
are about 150 persons employed on the works.
The manager is provided with an excellent
house, and the miners, mechanics, and others,
with very comfortable cottages. There are
besides these buildings a store belonging to
the Company, a post-office, two butcheries,
two bakeries, and a schoolhouse is now being
erected, making a total of seventy-five houses
and huts on the estate. Near the mouth of
the mine very good coal is being worked for
local purposes. Altogether the village bears
a busy and cheerful aspect.
The operations consist of shale mining,
extracting oil from the shale and refining it,
timber-sawing, erecting buildings, and all the
mechanical operations necessary to carry on
the works. Some fifty men are engaged in
winning 350 tons of shale or mineral per
week, which is either exported or treated for
oil extract on. The lower division of the
seam is 10 to 14 inches thick, and that of
the upper one 7 to 10 inches thick —the shale
obtained from the lower division being the
most valuable is exported, and contains about
three-fifths of the whole.
When the oil is extracted at the works
the shale is put into the retorts and dis-
tilled at an extremely low temperature. The
oil being carried down by gravitation to the
purifying works, is received into a tank, and
with an addition of sulphuric acid for the
purpose of purifying it by chemical action,
brings off a black viscid tar, composed of the
basic substances of the oil. The liquid then
passes into another tank, where it is treated
with a solution of caustic soda and sent on for
a second and third distilling. After being
treated each time with the acid and soda
the kerosene is finally re-distilled, and then
put into store tanks, filled into 4-gallon
tins, and placed in cases ready for market.
One month is necessary to make good burning
oil, but during its manufacture other valu-
able substances are extracted and brought
to market, as is evidenced by the following
figures 100 tons of kerosene shale produce
10,000 gallons of crude oil, or 5,000 gallons
of good burning oil, 3 to 5 per cent, of gazo-
line at 670°, U to 2 per cent, of paraffine, 6
per cent, of tar, and 10 to 15 per cent, of
lubricating oil. In extracting the oil from
the shale fourteen men are employed ; and
two boys by means of American machinery
are enabled to make 400 tins per diem for
holding the oil.
The water used at the works is brought
from a distance of 1* mile, and is very
clear and good. The estate has an area of
1,887 acres. About 66 bullocks and 56
horses are worked upon it.
There is more to be seen at Joadja than
at any similar mine in the Colony. The
processes of extracting and refining the oil
are particularly interesting, and to the lover
of grand scenery the locality has scarcely
a rival. A very large sum of money has
been already expended, and doubtless more
will be required before the Company can
hope to receive the rich reward which is
unquestionably before it, and which it
deserves for its spirited and unostentatious
enterprise. The expenditure of such a large
amount of capital, and the consequent loca-
tion of a numerous industrial population, will


I have a most beneficial effect upon Mittagong
and the surrounding districts ; and it is to be
Hoped that the people most interested will
rightly appreciate the great manufacturing
undertaking carried on in their vicinity.

There can be but little doubt but that as
soon as Joadja Creek (an ugly name by the
way) becomes better known it will have many
visitors, who will be well repaid for the visit.
Bowral Station, 80 miles; 2,171 feet above
sea-level.— Bowral is a pretty thriving village
near severalwooded heights, verdant meadows’
and open forests. It has stores and inns.
Bowral is chiefly supported by the traffic of
jhe Kan galoon farmers. It is considered to
ie a very healthy place. Kangaloon is 10
mles distant from Bowral to the south-east-
tnd Eobertson is in the same direction.

comparison with those of Sydney itself-
and every year adds to its relative industrial
and mercantile importance. It occupies a
site near the edge of an extensive plain
watered by the Mulwarrie Ponds and the
VVollondilly River. It is the seat of an
Anghcan (and Roman Catholic) Bishopric
and has decidedly the Chief Railway Station
on the Southern Line of Railway. The
City is well laid out in rectangular blocks

MurrumburrahStation, 228 miles; 1,351 fe
above sea-level.—A Village Station in t
District of Young, 41 miles beyond Yass—
rail. At li miles from this Station there is
large “opening” over Murrumburrah Cree
spanned by a timber bridge 250 feet
length This bridge is 24 feet below th
level of the neighbouring station. The Lin
then ascends on a gradient of 1 in 40 for 1
miles reaching a height of 1,480 feet—wher
there is a heavy cutting of 50,000 yards an
39 feet deep. From this point the Lin
begins to descend again, and continues des
pending to Demondrille Creek, where ther
is a bridge of four openings 26 feet spai
Connaughtman’s Creek is the next water
course in the way, and that is crossed by
brick bridge. Close to this creek is th
Wallendbeen platform. Coaches run from
Murrumburrah to Young, Wombat, Grenfell
and districts.
Wallendbeen Platform, 241 miles; 1,514 fee
above sea-level.- A Village, with a Railway
Platform, in the District of Young, 13 miles
south-west of Murrumburrah, and 54 miles
from Yass. It is believed that a considera-
ble quantity of wool from the “ Levels,’
will be sent from here, and that Wallend-
been will to some extent become the ter-
minus for Young, as it is several miles
nearer Young than Murrumburrah. The soil
increases in richness after Wallendbeen is
left behind, until it can be seen in the cut-
tings several feet deep ; and in the fields its
capabilities meet the eye in the flourishing
condition of the farms which are passed as the
train goes by, on each side of the Line. The
last 5 or 6 miles of country between Wallend-
been and Cootamundra is tolerably level.
Cootamundra Station, 253 miles; 1,079
feet above sea-level.— The station of Coota-
mundra (formerly Cobramundra) is in the
District of Gundagai, 12 miles south-west
of Wallendbeen, and 66 miles (by rail)
beyond Tass. Cootamundra (a thriving
place) forms part of a rich and fertile dis-
trict, many miles in extent. From Coota-
mundra to Wagga (a distance of about 50
miles) there is much good land. A good
deal of it is formed by the disintegration of
granite ; but many of the cuttings show a
great depth of rich chocolate loamy soil,
just the very thing for wheat growing and
vineyards. An immense tract of this part
of the country remains untilled. The
country becomes uneven after leaving Coota-
mundra, and the earthworks between that
place and Bethungra are consequently
heavy. The highest point on the Line
between Murrumburrah and Cootamundra
is at a distance of 243| miles from Sydney,
at which place the height is 1,667 feet above
the level of the sea. Then the Line descends
on a 1 in 40 gradient for a distance of 1
mile and three quarters and gets on to the
Cootamundra Flats, passing thence on to
the Cootamundra Station without any earth-
works of importance. 3 miles on the Goul-
burn side of Cootamundra there is a water-
station. The Station Buildings at Coota-
mundra are cf timber with galvanized-iron
roofing, and comprise a general waiting-
room, a ladies’ waiting-room, ticket office,
and porters’ room. There is also a goods-
shed, 60 feet by 30 feet; and a turn-table for
the engine, and a Residence for the Railway
Station Master have also been constructed.
The Southern Railway has, without doubt,
here tapped a fine wheat-growing district of
very considerable area; but in addition to the
agricultural population there many of the
people who are becoming small squatters,
going in for sheep and wool, and in this way
making Cootamundra a wool-producing dis-
trict as well as a grain-growing one. Near
Cootamundra are some fine blue stone
quarries. Coaches run from Cootamundra to
Guudagai, Adelong, Tumut, Tarcutta, Ger-
manton, Tumberumba, Albury, and districts.

settlement (with a Station on the Railway)
in the District of Gundagai, 15 miles south-
west of Cootamundra, and 81 miles (by
rail) beyond Yass.


Billabong Platform, 276 miles; 881 feet
above sea-level. This Platform on the
Southern Line takes its name from the
Billabong Creek, over which there is a
10-ft. culvert for the railway to pass.
Jnnee Station, 286 miles; 985 feet above
sea-level. —Junee, 10 miles west of Bethun-
gra, is a pastoral settlement in the Wagga
Wagga District, on the Houlahan Creek, in
the midst of a fine undulating country. It
is 22 miles north of Wagga Wagga. Hold
and limestone found in the vicinity. The
Station at Junee is 286 miles 41 chains from
Sydney. The station arrangements pro-
vided for, are : a timber station building, con-
sisting of ladies’ waiting-room, ticket-office,
parcels office, and lamp-room ; a goods-shed,
60 feet long by 30 feet broad ; an outside
loading platform, 60 feet long, and the
necessary sidings. A Station Masters’House
is built, and commodious cattle and sheep
yards have also been erected. An extension
from Junee to Narrandra—to the westward
—has been authorised, and the works are
shortly to be commenced.
Wallace Town Platform, 294 miles; 830
feet above sea-level.— This platform stands
between Junee and Wagga Wagga—eight
miles from the former place, and fourteen
miles from the latter.
Wagga Wagga Station, 304 miles; 739 feet
above sea-level. —This important town is on
the banks of the Murrumbidgee, about 514
miles above its junction with the Murray.
It is the centre of a rich pastoral and agri-
cultural district, and numbers a population
of about 2,500 souls. The principal streets
contain numerous substantial edifices, in-
cluding Hotels, Stores, Branch Banks, and
Business Agencies. There are four Churches,
a Roman Catholic Convent, a Masonic Hall,
a Mechanics Institute, and a Public School.
Proclaimed as a municipality in 1870.
Wagga Wagga has already ratable property
to the amount of £320,000. It has two
local papers —the Express and the Advertiser.
This is at present the terminus of the
Southern Railway, but the Line is to be
carried on to Albury, and is now in the course
of construction. At Albury the N.S.W.
Line will join the Yictorian Line. A Trial
Survey has also been completed, for effecting
a junction by railway between the Line near
Wagga Wagga and Deniliquin (via Urana
and Jerilderie) to the westward. At Denili-
quin the railway will also meet the Victorian
Lines. Erom Jerilderie a Trial Survey is in
progress to the N. W. ; towards Hay, on the
Murrumbidgee River. Coaches run from
Wagga Wagga to Urana, Jerilderie, Co-
nargo, Deniliquin, Albury, Narandera, Hay,
and districts.
IV.—SYDNEY, viâ BLACKTOWN, TO RICHMOND.
(SUBSIDIARY BRANCH OF WESTERN LINE.)
Note.— The first 22 miles on the Railway
from the Metropolis to Richmond are upon
the Main Trunk Line, as far as Parramatta
Junction; and then on the Western
Line, properly so called, as far as Black-
town. The following stations and stopping
places have therefore to be passed : Sydney,
Eveleigh, McDonald Town, Newtown, Stan-
more, Petersham, Ashfield, Groydon, Burwood,
Eedmyre, Homebush, Rookwood, Auburn,
and Parramatta Junction. Then (on the
Western Line) Parramatta, Seven Hills,
and Blacktown. All these stations and stop-
ping places have already been described else-
where. The Itinerary for the Blacktown
and Richmond Branch Line will commence
at Blacktown.

183 feet above sea-level— TheEailway Travel-
ler intending to visit Richmond (or any
place on the Blacktown and Richmond Sub-
sidiary Line) must change from his car in

Subsidiary Line leaves Blacktown in a north-
westerly direction, and passes through a
pleasant and diversified country, for 6 miles,
until it reaches Riverstone Station.
Riverstone Station, 28 miles; 78 feet above
sea-level.— Riverstone is a small agricultural

Windsor Station, 34 miles; 41 feet abov
sea-level— Windsor, “the capital of th
Hawkesbury,’ is a very old town situatec
on that river, near its junction with th
feouth Creek and the Rickaby Ponds. Th
soil of the country around is wonderfull
ertde, and, but for the floods to which th
low land is subject, would prove invaluabl
tor farming property. As it is there i
much wealth here accumulated by the in
dustrious in favourable seasons. In regarc
to its relative position, Richmond lies *
miles to the west, Wilberforce 4| miles to
thenorth-west, and Pitt Town 4 miles north
ot Windsor. _ Windsor was proclaimed
municipality in 1871, and has ratable pro
perty valued at £68,456. Amongst the
Public Buildings are : a Court House,
school of Arts, a Hospital and Benevolent
Asylum, Churches in connection with al
the principal denominations, and a Public

The Anglican Church is a quaint old edifice
in the “ G-eorgian ” style of architecture. In
its churchyard are some curious and inter-
esting tombs. There is a fine park at
Windsor, and the town now contains many
beautiful and commodious buildings. From
Windsor the tourist may go by a small
river steamer (starting usually at Pitt Town)
down the Hawkesbury to Wiseman’s Ferrv
and St. Albans—a most delightful trio.
(See route No. 15.) 1
Clarendon Platform, 36 miles; about 50 feet
above sea-level.- Clarendon is a Platform on
the edge of the Richmond Common, 2 miles

ment in Richmond. The township con
tains several good buildings; including th
Churches of the four principal denomina
tions, the School of Arts, the Court-House
and the Railway Station. There are severa
good Hotels. Population, 1,000 souls. The
surrounding flats are under cultivation. A
Richmond the tourist can hire a car and drive
(at a comparatively small charge) to the
Hurra] ong Heights, where the scenery ii
lovely in the extreme, consisting of waterfalls
gorges, dells, and forests. The Yale of Avoca
(a meeting of the waters of the Grose and a
hne mountain stream) can readily be reached
from the road between Richmond and
Kurrajong; off, to the westward,
at Lamrock’s. This picturesque locality
should be visited by the tourist. At the
Kurrajong there are several houses at which
the tourist can board and lodge. Behind
one of these (“ Belmore Lodge”) at the top
of the Big Hill, there is a magnificent view
of the County of Cumberland, and much
of the adjacent country in the distance.
Hie road from this spot is continued over
the mountains to Mount Wilson’s Station
on the Great Western Railway. This track’
chiefly used for cattle, is known as Bell’s
Lino of Eoad, and abounds with grand and
beautiful scenery. The tourist had, how-
ever, much better not attempt to travel over
it without a guide. The distance from the
Kurrajong to the Mount Wilson Station is
about 26 miles.
V.—NEWCASTLE TO TAMWORTH.
(GREAT NORTHERN TRUNK LINE.)
Note— The Great Northern Trunk Line
between the City of Newcastle and Tam-
worth, is at present unconnected with the
Western and Southern Lines, and their Sub-
sidiary Branches. The Assembly has, how-
ever, determined that these two Trunk Lines
shall be joined by a Line of Railway so as
to form one complete Railway System, in-


stead of two unconnected ones. The reader
will observe that in this Itinerary for the
Northern Trunk Line, the miles are measured
from its Terminus at Newcastle. Newcastle
time is observed at all Stations.

entrance to the * Hunter River (formerly
known as the Coal River), and is 75 miles
north of Sydney. Population, within the
municipal boundaries in 1871, 7,581 souls.
If the mining suburbs are included the
population will be found much larger. New-
castle was settled early in the history of the
Colony, but has rapidly advanced as a city
and seaport during the last few years. It
is the well known port of a large coal
district, unsurpassed in the Australian
Colonies. The city—which is the seat of an
Anglican Bishopric —is, for the most part,
substantially built, and important works
have been carried on for the improvement
of the harbour, and to afford desirable
facilities for its growing trade. The most
remarkable buildings are the Custom House,
the Post Office, the Court House, the School
of Arts, the Banks, the Churches (6), the
Hospital, the Asylums, the Grammar School,
the Market House, and several of the Hotels.
The Terminus of the Great Northern Rail-
way is just opposite to the old custom-house,
and within a few feet of the harbour —an
arrangement not without its advantages and
inconveniences. Proclaimed a municipality
in 1859. Eatable property, valued at
£720,000; with 16 miles of roads and
streets. Communication by steamers and
ships with Sydney, and by Railway with the
Interior. Two Public Schools and three
Denominational Schools. The local news-
papers are: The Neivcastle Daily Pilot, The
Newcastle Morning Herald, and some others.

a municipality in 1871. Ratable property
—£165,000. Near Waratah, to the west-
south-west, there is a Branch Line turning off
to the rising town of W allsend, at which there
is a population of 6,000 persons. [Between
Wallsend and Sydney via Lake Macquarie
* The Yalley of the Hunter —that extensive alluvial
tract traversed by the Hunter River —appears to have
been first explored about the year 1825. The fol-
lowing deeply interesting account of its first discovery
(from the pen of Mr. G. T. Loder) recently appeared
in the columns of the Maitland Mercury. Mr. Q-. T.
Loder says: —“The late Mr. John Howe, of Morpeth,
was the leader of the party who—starting from
Windsor overland—first discovered the valley of the
Hunter, then called “ Camilaroy.” His associates
were the late Mr. Benjamin Singleton, a most enter-
prising man; the late Mr. George Loder (Mr. Howe’s
son-in-law); the late Mr. Thomas Dargin, two or three
white men, and two blackfellows as guides and inter-
preters. They did not come over the Bulga the first
time, but came down Douglas Creek, above Jerry’s
Plains, on to the Hunter, and followed it downwards
for a few miles. On account of Mr. Howe’s health
not being good, and the blackfellows refusing to go
any further, the party returned to Windsor. Some
time afterwards' Mr. Howe was leader of another
party. His associates were Mr. Singleton, Mr. George
Loder, Mr. Andrew Loder, and others, two or three
servants, and two blackfellows. Instead of keeping
their former track they left it at Howe’s Yalley, and
came over the Bulga and on to the Hunter. They
followed the river downwards and reached the level
ground between Baroona and Neotsfield, on St.
Patrick’s Day—from which circumstance it was called
St. Patrick’s Plains. Prom there they followed the
river down as far as where West Maitland stands. On
their return home a horse belonging to one of the
party, named Cockfighter, got bogged in the creek
not far from Wambo, hence the name Cockfighter’s
Creek. Three places on the Bulga road are called
after Mr. Howe to this day—Howe’s Yalley, Howe’s
Waterhole, and Howe’s Mountain.”

Excursion to the Flat Rock.— At the dis-
tance of about 6 miles from Scone, out
amongst the mountains, is a wild and pic-
turesque spot known as the Plat Rock,
which is spoken of by a recent tourist as
well deserving of a visit. This Lady Tourist
(an accomplished writer, whose description
of the glen of the Flat Rock has been pub-
lished to the world in the Maitland Mercury
under the nom de plume of “ Gipsy”) says :
“ Our way became tortuous and rugged,
and to avoid too much climbing we kept in
the bed of what has been —and will be again
some day when there is rain enough—a
creek. After walking in this for some dis-
tance the glen took an abrupt turn, and we
suddenly came upon what seemed to me an
enchanted region. As far as natural scenery
is concerned it was one of the grandest
sights I ever saw in my life. The sides of
the glen rose to the height of several
hundred feet, in some places sloping and in
others abrupt, but everywhere covered with
the most luxuriant vegetation. What
seemed to me a most remarkable thing was
that the vegetation on either side had its
distinctive characteristics, and even the rocks
appeared of a different nature and forma-
tion. On one side could be seen the Moreton


Bay fig tree, with its glossy leaves, the Sting,
mg Tree with its graceful foliage, and the
Acacia—besides several other beautiful trees
for which I could find no name, some of
them having long slender stems crowned at
the top with a tuft of foliage, and looking at
a distance much like palms. Intertwined
among these were several kinds of creepers
forming numbers of the most beautiful
natural arbours one could imagine. In the
undergrowth I noticed a species of holly
S lk fwv E l nglish variet J> and an elder
bush with the berries nearly ripe. Among
all this luxuriance the rocks were tumbled
about in most admired disorder,’ assuming
all sorts of fantastic shapes, and covered
with mosses, ferns, rock lilies, and cacti:
while on the other side of the glen the
iron-bark and the tea-tree reigned supreme
forming, with their sombre foliage, a com-
plete contrast to the vivid green of the
opposite side, and thereby adding greatly to
the effect At our left the ravine had
widened the surface being composed of
smooth/a* rock several yards in dimensions,
which forms the lunching place for sight-
seers, and has suggested its rather unro-
mantic name. The whole view formed a
picture to go into raptures over, and once
seen never to be forgotten.” The writer of
this lively description of a lovely spot
named it the Fairy Dell, by which it will
probably henceforth be known. The rocks
m the neighbourhood assume quaint fan-
tastic shapes ; and amongst them there are
pinnacles known as “ Moses” and “ Aaron,”
and a tall white one whimsically dis-
tinguished as « Lot’s Wife.”
Park Platform, 101 miles; 720 feet above
sea-level-Parlt is a platform on the Great
-Northern Railway, 5 miles from Scone.
Wingen Platform, 106 miles; 1,002 feet
above sea-level— There is a platform on the
JN orthern Railway near the Burning Moun-
tain, known as Mount Wingen, 10 miles from
and 14 from Murrurundi. Mount
vv ingen is 1,820 feet high.
Blandford Platform, 115 miles; 1,382 feet
above sea-level.— Blandford is a pastoral and
agricultural settlement on the Page River
and AVArland s Creek, about 3 miles south of
the town of Murrurundi. There is a plat-
form on the Railway here. The highest
mountain in the district—Mount Murrulla—
is 3 miles west-south-west of Blandford.
Murrurundi Station, 120 miles; 1,546 feet
above sea-level —Murrurundi is a fine little
inland town, beautifully situated on the
iage Biver at the foot of the Liverpool
Kange. Population, 350 souls. A Local
Hospital, a School of Arts, Churches for the
tour principal denominations, and a Public
School. The Murrurundi Times is the local
newspaper. Haydonton is regarded as a
suburb of Murrurundi, with which it is con-
nected by the Arnold Bridge, opened in 1864
Places near Murrurundi: Blackville, Timor
(noticeable for its caves), and Wallabadah.
Temple Court Platform, 121 miles; 1,609
feet above sea-level.— A platform 1 mile from
At f of a mile from Murru-
rundi, a cutting of 14,000 yards and 24 feet
deep, at its greatest depth, begins ; and \ a
mile further on, after passing various small
cuttings, there is one of some 10,000 yards.
o ;!l o n Ug^\0y , Hollow Platform, 126 miles;
2,070 feet above sea-level.-A platform 6
miles from Murrurundi. Passing Doughboy
Hollow Platform the Line is carried through
several small cuttings, and after running up
gradients, varying from 1 in 40 to 1 in 50
at 21- miles from Murrurundi, there is
another cutting of close upon 14,000 yards.
Willow-tree or Warrah Platform, 134
miles; 1,438 feet above sea-level— A small
settlement on the Great Northern Bail way
14 miles from Murrurundi and 48 miles
from Tamworth.
Braefield Platform, 140 miles; 1,275 feet
above sea-level— A platform on the Great
Northern Bail way, 4 miles on the Murrurundi
side of Qumndi. Crossing the Page Biver
the ascent of the mountain range to the
lunne! is commenced; and for a distance of
pi miles there is a continuous gradient of 1
m 40, passing through some very heavy
cuttings and over some high embankments.
Uue of these cuttings—at a place 4 miles
from Murrurundi, and before the Tunnel is
reached is set down at between 80,000 and
90,000 yards, with a depth up to 51 feet
Another cutting of 12,000 yards is met a
quarter of a mile further on ; and before the
1 unnel is entered a number of others—some
or hard rock are passed ; showing on the
plans 12,000, 14,000, 15,000, and 18,000


yards. The cuttings were enlarged in some
places to provide sufficient stuff for the em-
bankments; and in others to make the slopes
safe, and prevent, as far as could he done,
the blocking-up of the Line by landslips.
The cutting where the Tunnel is entered is
very steep, and of very considerable depth.
The Eailway here runs through a Tunnel 528
yards long, lined throughout with brickwork
and set with Portland cement. This is the
place where the Liverpool Eange is pierced
by the Eailway. At the north end of the
Tunnel the summit of the Eange is reached;
and as the train emerges from the Tunnel it
passes through a very deep cutting, of the
same nature as that on the Murrurundi side,
and one that has had to be considerably
increased to strengthen the soil on the
slopes. The Line descends rapidly from the
Liverpool Eange on gradients of from 1 in
40 to 1 in 50 for nearly miles, passing
through extensive cuttings, which in their
construction presented great difficulties to
the contractor, and over some heavy embank-
ments. The foot of the gradient is reached
at a place called Chilcott’s Creek, which is
crossed by a Timber Bridge of five 26-feet
openings. Within 2 miles of Quirindi only
are there any heavy cuttings and somewhat
steep gradients to be met. At that point
two heavy cuttings are situated, and the
gradients are 1 in 40 and 1 in 50. 8 miles
south of Quirindi the Line crosses Collie
Creek. After leaving the gradients last-
mentioned, the Quirindi Creek is crossed by
four 26 feet timber openings.
Quirindi Station, 144 miles; 1,328 feet
above sea-level.— Quirindi is a settlement on
the Quirindi Creek, 24 miles north of Mur-
rurundi. It is surrounded by good agricul-
tural land. Breeza lies west of Quirindi Sta-
tion, 25 miles ; Tamworth to the north, about
38 miles ; and Wallabadah to the eastward,
16 miles. The last embankment before
reaching Quirindi Station is of great length,
made up from side cuttings, and containing
over 20,000 yards. Quirindi Station is then
reached. From Quirindi Station the Eailway
commences to ascend on various gradients,
the greatest of which is 1 in 66 for a distance
of about 2 passing through several
cuttings, and then descends for a distance of
about a mile and a half. For a quarter of
a mile it again ascends, descending again
for a mile and a half, and then making a
further ascent for a distance of about 3
miles. Another descent for about 2 miles
brings the Eailway to the junction with the
Werris Creek and Gfunnedah Line.
Quip oily Platform, 150 miles; about 1,300
feet above sea-level. —A platform six miles
from Quirindi, and five miles from Werris
Creek Stations.
Werris Creek Station, 155 miles; 1,244
feet above sea-level.— Werris Creek Station
is 11 miles north of Quirindi, and 27 miles
south of Tamworth. Passing the Werris
Creek Station another large cutting is now
met with. It has been made through hard
rock, and contains some 22,000 or 23,000
yards of stuff. Again the Line ascends for
a short distance, and again descends on a
gradient of lin 40 for about a mile. Then
there is an ascent for a distance of between
4 and 5 miles on gradients varying from 1
in 40 to lin 80 —1 in 50 being most frequent
—through several hard cuttings, some of
them representing as much as 20,000 yards
of stuff. When this point is reached the
Line again descends, passing through small
cuttings for a distance of about 2 miles ; and
thence into Timbumhera the Line follows
the natural surface of the ground as near as
possible, and there, of course, few excava-
tions are required. Timbumhera Creek is
crossed by a Timber Bridge of four 26-feet
openings ; and from this point to Tamworth
the intervening distance is about 11 miles.
The Station at Tamworth is situated about a
mile and a quarter from Tamworth proper,
and south of the Peel Eiver. This point is
the limit to which the extension under the
contract recently completed goes. The Line
will be carried into Tamworth proper under
the contract that will he entered into for
the further extension of the Eailway north-
wards, recently sanctioned by Parliament.
Prom Murrurundi to Tamworth the rails
are single-headed, fish-jointed throughout,
weighing 70 Bbs. to the yard, and secured to
the sleepers by spikes and screws alternately.
Prom Werris Creek (as already intimated)
the Branch Line to Breeza and Grunnedah
begins. There are two timber bridges over
Werris Creek, each having five openings;
one bridge to carry the Eailway, and the
other for the road approach to the Eailway
Station.


Currabubula Station, 164 miles; 1,408 feet
above sea-level.-Currabubula station is 8
miles from Tamworth, on the Murrurundi
side. Through Currabubula Station the
Tine passes by a 30-chain curve, crossing the
road to Goonoo Goonoo at 165 miles • then
another 30-chain curve brings it ’across
Currabubula Creek, where there is a timber
thS e ° f Spans ; thence rouild
the base of the Sugar-loaf Mountain, whence
its direction takes a north-easterly course
and enters the estate of the Peel Eiver
to°lSX d 80 oVer Timbumber “ Creek
Tamworth Station, 183 miles; 1,343 f ee t
above sea-leveh-Tamworth - the ’present
terminus of the Great Northern Eailway to
the northward, and one of the most progres-
f{! e townships in the northern portion of
this Co ony—lies 182 miles north-west of
Newcastle, and 251 miles from Sydney by
e postal route; its least distance from the
coast being 116 miles. It lies in a fertile
valley, at the confluence of the Cockburn
Eiver and Goonoo Goonoo Creek, and is
surrounded by a prosperous grazing and
agricultural community. Tamworth is the
centre of an eastern portion of the pastoral
district of Liverpool Plains. It has Churches
lor the four _ principal denominations.
Mechanics Institute, a Temperance Hall, a
I ruDiic School, two Denominational Schools
large Stores, Hotels, Branch Banks, and
-Business Agencies. It is a proclaimed muni-
»d. Wlth , ra ! able property assessed at
L 146,897, and has 44 miles of streets
and roads. An Agricultural and Pastoral
Association are held here periodically; and
there is a flourishing Jockey Club. The
local papers are The Tamworth News and
Tamworth Observer. Population, about
souls. The nearest places are : At-
tunga, 10 miles north ; Goonoo Goonoo, 15
Miles south ; Moonbi, 15 miles north; Ma-
nila, 30 miles north-west; Carroll, 35 miles
vest 5 Bowling Alley Point, 28 miles south-
;ast; N undle (on the Liverpool Eange) 36
mles south ; Hanging Eock, 43 miles south ;
•nd Barraba, 60 miles north. The remain-
ug places near Tamworth are Bective, Bun-
della, Colly Blue, Dungowan, Keepit, Pine
Eidge, Quipolly, Tally-ho, Tambar Springs,
Somerton. Gunnedah is 50 miles to the
westward of Tamworth. The station arrange-
ments at Tamworth consist of the station
uiJdings, platform, and two carriage docks
a goods warehouse with uncovered platform,’
water-tank for engines, engine-shed and pits,
coal stage, and extensive sheep and cattle yards.
Ihe Station is a brick building, 85 feet in
ength, and 24 feet wide, with verandahs to
the platform and road fronts, and contains a
general waiting-room, and every other requi-
site convenience. Should the proposed plan
ol further extension of the Railway in the
direction of the Tableland be matured, some
two or three years must elapse before the
Railway spans the Peel River ; and in view
of the periodical floods, and the consequent
overflowing of the low lands, to which the
locality is subject, considerable difficulty has
yet to be faced before the Line is completed
into the Town of Tamworth. Should the
Line follow in the direction of Armidale the
main station of Tamworth will lie imme-
diately under the range of hills which skirt
the eastern boundary of the township,
i rom thence the valley of the Cockburn
River, a tributary of the Peel, and the
swamp Oak and Jamison Creeks (which are
tributaries of the Cockburn) will be followed
until the summit of the range is reached by
easy gradients. The completion of this por-
tion of the Trunk Line towards Queensland
must necessarily be a matter of considerable
time, and meanwhile Tamworth will be the
emporium for the bulk of the north-western
trade. Trial Surveys have been completed
tor the railway connection of Tamworth with
Inverell and Tenterfield, and with Armidale,
Wen Innes, and Grafton. The Railway ex-
a™ w Werris Creek to Gunned ah (on
tlie JN. W.) is now in the course of construc-
tion, and a portion of the extension as far as
Breeza, 15 miles, has recently been opened
for traffic. 1 rom Gunnedah to INarrabri—
m the same direction—a Trial Survey has
f| C6l \S ’ an( * f rom Narrabri away to
the Macintyre River (to the N.W.) a Trial
Survey is in progress. The Line to the north
or lenterfield will join on to the Queensland
Line of Railways; thus (eventually) con-
necting Sydney, and the other Australian
capitals, with Brisbane. Coaches run from
Tamworth to Bendemeer, Lralla, Armidale,
Glen Innes, Tenterfield, Warwick, Bun-
darra, Inverell, Vegetable Creek, Barraba,
Bingera, Warialda, and districts.


VI.—MAIN BRANCH—NORTH-WESTERN LINE.
This Branch line which starts from Werris
Creek is now in course of construction as
far as Gunnedah,butit is ultimately intended
to extend the line into the North-western
interior. The only station at present on the
line is Breeza, which is 170 miles from New-
castle and 951 feet above sea level and 15
miles from the Junction with the Great
Northern Line. Breeza at present is only
a small township, and the district is almost
entirely a pastoral one. Coaches run from
Breeza to Gunnedah, Narrabri, Pilliga,
Walgett, Goodooga, Brenda, Millie, Moree,
Mungindi, Kunopia, and districts.
VII.—SUBSIDIARY BRANCH LINES TO NORTHERN LINE.
(BETWEEN NEWCASTLE AND TAMWORTH.)
The three Subsidiary Branch Lines to the
G-reat Northern Line of Railway do not
appear to call for any particular description
in the way of an Itinerary —being all very
short. The first —from Honeysuckle Point
to Bullock Island —has but one Station, li
miles fromthe Main Line, and is chiefly used
for mineral traffic. The second —from the
Waratah Tunnels to Wallsend—has also but
one Station (Wallsend.) It is 4J miles long,
and connects Newcastle with the rising town
of Wallsend, as elsewhere pointed out. The
third Subsidiary Branch Line to the Great
Northern Railway —from East Maitland to
Morpeth—numbers three stopping places ;
East Maitland, Morpeth, and Northumber-
land-street; the first-named has been else-
where described, but the last-named presents
no feature calling for any special notice.
Morpeth Station, 22 miles from Newcastle
by rail, is an important township situated
on the Hunter, about 30 miles by river from
Newcastle. A branch line 4 miles in
length, connects the township, joining the
Great Northern Railway at East Maitland.
The navigation of the Hunter by ocean
steamers is only practicable as far as this
point, and it is this fact that mainly renders
Morpeth such an important and thriving
town. The greater part of the goods for the
Northern Districts are consigned to this
place, and it may be considered the shipping
port for a large area of the Northern District.
The droghers belonging to the steam com-
panies convey the produce down the rivers
to the Morpeth wharfs, where it is tran-
shipped to the ocean-going steamers. The
town and vicinity have a population of 2,500
souls, and boasts of a muncipality. The
ratable value of property in 1876 was
£88,284, and the revenue for the year £9BB.
There are amongst the buildings a School of
Arts, five churches and four schools. The
Paterson, perhaps the most important of the
tributaries of the Hunter, joins the main
river at this point; and opposite Morpeth is
found the pretty little township of Hinton.
The country around Morpeth is chiefly
agricultural, and is said to be the richest
cultivable land in the Colony ; and there is
no prettier sight to be found in the district
than that along the banks of the Hunter and
the Paterson near Morpeth where the green
fields, stretching for miles, may be aptly
termed the garden of the Hunter. Unfor-
tunately the lands here lie very low, and it
has been the scene of many disastrous
floods. Of late, however, the seasons have
been good, and there have been no floods,
consequently the district is in a very pros-
perous condition.

uninterruptedly around the sides of the valley, and the
succeeding layers of rock, as we descend one side of
the ravine, gradually approach the corresponding
layers on the other side, until at the bottom, in the
bed of the watercourse, we find that they actually
join, which they would not do if the sides of the
ravine had been violently torn asunder. We per-
ceive, therefore, that the various out-cropping strata
must once have been continuous right across the val-
ley or ravine, and that they have been removed by
some agency without disturbance of the underlying
beds. What then is this agency ? Not volcanic fire
but running water. Look at the sloping surface of
any earth-cuttings or embankments that have been
exposed to rain action ; see the miniature ranges and
intervening valleys that the water draining off it has
furrowed out. Notice the miniature precipices left
where the harder earth material has resisted the
action of the running water, also at the bottom of
the embankment, where the incline ceases and the
water flows gently, how it deposits in miniature allu-
vial flats the earth it has scooped out and washed
down from above. Now, could we look down from a
considerable height, and, as it were, take a bird s-eye
view of the Blue Mountains, exactly similar features
would be presented to us as we observed in the
earth embankment. Wherever the soft clay strata
of the Coal Measures exist, there are sloping sur-
faces ; where the harder Hawkeslury rocks appear,
there are cliffs, while the easily disintegrated clay-
beds have been washed away, even to undermining
the over-lying sandstone. The latter has resisted to
a great extent the denuding agencies and been left in
projecting masses which, at last, having the support-
ing soft strata removed, break away and roll in great
bosses down the sides of the hill, perhaps as far as
into the bed of the stream below, a perpendicular
cliff being left where they broke away from the main
mass of rock. It may be objected that the effects of
the present streams are not sufficiently powerful to
have worked such changes ; but then it must be con-
sidered that these forces have been operating through
an immense period of time ; and moreover that, in
the later Tertiary epoch we have geological data indi-
cating that this part of the Continent was subject to
a much heavier rainfall; again, in the earlier Ter-
tiary period a great portion of the Continent was
covered by the sea. It was probably during this
later epoch that these valleys first began to be marked
out as the sea-water receded; and the subsequent
draining off from the land of the rainwater gradually
scooped out and deepened the drainage channels, till,
after a vast lapse of time, they were shaped into the
valleys as we now see them.*

REMARKS ON THE FLORA OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS
As the traveller passes rapidly by train over the Blue
Mountains, and catches here and there a glimpse
of some stately tree or pretty shrub, he feels anxious
to know something of the vegetation which meets
his view.
Taken as a whole, the flora of the Blue Moun-
tains, especially that part through which the train
passes, is somewhat monotonous. The large orders
Myriaceee, Leguminosce, liutacece, and Proteaceee,
Telopea speciosissima.
(Greatly reduced.)
are, however, well represented; but as the geological
formation from Emu to Blackheath is for the most
part of sandstone, there is considerable uniformity
in the appearance of the plants. In the deep gullies
where the sun scarcely penetrates, and in those
places where the basalt rises above the sandstone,
there is a marked difference in the vegetation.
Graceful ferns, rare orchids, gigantic climbers,
mosses, and lichens, abound in such spots ; whilst
the trees and shrubs differ materially from those
prevailing in other parts of the range. Thus, for
instance, at Mount Tomah, which rises 3,400 foot
above the level of the sea, and also, to a limited
extent, at Mount Hay (3,270 feet), and Mount King
George (3,378 feet), where the basaltic formation
lies above what the late eminent Geologist, the llevd.
W. B. Clarke, F.R.S., termed the “Wianamatta
beds,”’ there is a striking peculiarity in the flora.
At Tomah especially, such trees as ‘ ‘ Sassafras
( Doryphora sassafras), “Light Wood” (Ceratope-
talum apdalum and Schizomeria ovata), Quintinia
Sieberi, and Cargillia australis, flourish in all their
native luxuriance ; whilst, amidst the dense foliage
of the forest, or in the adjacent gullies, there may
be seen epiphytal orchids (Dendrohium and Sarco-
chilus) and various species of ferns, including the
splendid tree-fern Didcsonia antarctica, the climbing
Polypodium tenellum and P. scandens, several
species of Lomaria and Asplenium, and Todea
Fraseri, one of the most delicate and admired of
Australian ferns. Here also Allan Cunningham
discovered the curious climbing rooting-stemmed

As the traveller leaves
Emu on his way to the
Zigzag, he may notice
on the mountain slopes
several species of Euca-
lyptus, popularly known
as gum-trees, iron-bark,
blood-wood, and stringy -
bark ; but of these only
one, the Mountain blood-
wood (E. eximia), differs
from the species near
Sydney. The turpen-
tine ( Syncarpia laurina)
occurs frequently, and
also the tree called red-
gum ( Anyophora lanceo-
lata), both of which
attain considerable size ;
and as the traveller pro-
ceeds, he may see two
gums {E. stellulata and
E. cormcea) and the

Of the Myrtacese or

of Eucalyptus, Melaleuca,
Leptospermum, Caly-

by various shrubs or

housia myrti/olia, Trie-
tania nereifolia, and Eu-
genia Smithii, belong
rather to the creeks and
gullies, where also the
rare straggling shrub
Palmeria racemosa of
the Monimiacese, and
several climbers of the
genera Vitis, Sarcopeta-
lum, and Marsdenia,
occur in wild profusion.
In similar localities also
the fine tree, called
“ blue-gum,” rises above
100 feet and affords
excellent timber for
building purposes, such
as scantling, battens,
flooring-boards, and
ships’ planks. This spe-
cies is now referred by
Baron Mueller to Euca-
lyptus saligna. The Le-
guminous order prevails
both in the gullies and
on the ranges. Gom-
pholobium, Pultencea,
Dillvyynia, Jacksonia, and Daviesia, are all papilion-
aceous and have yellow or orange flowers, whilst
A ennedya Indtgofera, Mirbelia, and Hovea are of
the same kind but with purple flowers. To these
must be added many species of Acacia, which
belong to another division of the Leguminosjc and
are very showy at certain seasons of the year.’ A
data and A. dealbata are amongst the most admired
species, but several of them yield a bark useful for
c nnmg purposes. It is difficult in a short sketch
to give an adequate idea of the extent and beauty of
or to Particularise those
smaller shrubs which abound even in the most
unlikely soils. The Epacrids are very lovely
and m this part of the world occupy the place of


heaths. Some twelve species of Epacris, and many
of the allied genera may be collected in different
parts of the mountains. Of the Iris family, Pater-
Epacris longiflora.
sonia and Libertia are very elegant with their
purple and white flowers, whilst the lily family is
represented by Dianella, Arthropodium, Blandfordia,
and Alania. Some of the Goodenia family and
several species of Lobelia are interesting objects for
examination, but perhaps to strangers the grass
trees, especially Xanthorrhcea arborea, appear
amongst the most characteristic features of the
mountain vegetation. Veronica perfoliata, which
is considered to indicate the auriferous formation
occurs near the locality in which the Rev. W. B.
Clarke first discovered gold; and the little fern
Grammitis rutifolia, which generally shows the
proximity of granite, has been found in the same
neighbourhood. Notwithstanding the exertions of
enterprising botanists, much remains to be done in
marking the limits of known species, and probably in
bringing to light some which have hitherto escaped
observation. Through the labours of Cealey, Fraser,
Sieber, and the two Cunninghams, many of the most
beautiful species on the Blue Mountains have long
been known to science, and their specimens have
been accurately described in the Flora Australiensis,
the joint elaborate work of Bentham and Mueller,
but the late researches of Mr. Fitzgerald, F.L.S.,
show that some of the tender and transient orchids
have escaped observation. Adenochilus Nortoni, so
named in honor of its discoverer Mr. James Norton,

has hitherto been found only in one spot near Mount
Victoria, within a mile of the railway; and from
Mr. Fitzgerald’s artistic illustrations of Australian
orchids it appears that much is yet to be learned
respecting the habitat and variations of the smaller
kinds. The same remark is applicable to the crypto-
gamous botany of the mountains, for although the last
volume of our Flora has given a fair outline of our
ferns, yet the mosses, lichens, and fungi afford a wide
field for investigation. These are abundant in some
of the deep gullies and in the moist shady woods. A
kind of Sphceria (Pielus Swainsoni) is known to exist
at Mount Tomah, for it was found there some years
ago by the late Mrs. Calvert, a lady who did much
to illustrate the natural history of the Blue Moun-
tains, and also recently at the Kurrajong by Mr. H.
Selkirk, of the Survey Department. The prospect
of finding something new therefore may serve to
encourage naturalists in their rambles amidst the
dark recesses of the mountains, and to cheer them
with the hope of associating their names with the
flora of a country which is destined to play an im-
portant part in the world’s future history.*

THE FISH RIVER OR BHSTDA CAVES.
(By C. S. WILKINSON, L.S., F.G.S., Government Geological Surveyor.)
These limestone caves rank amongst the finest in the
Colony, and as they afford some of the most inte-
resting sights connected with the grand natural
scenery to be obtained within accessible distance
from the line of the Great Western Railway, it was
deemed advisable in the public interests that an
examination and survey of them should be made,
not only to serve as a guide for the hundreds of
tourists who yearly visit them, but also to ascer-
tain what steps were necessary to be taken for the
preservation of the caves, and for the convenience
and safety of visitors.
The so-called “Fish River” or “ Binda Caves,”
though only about 6 miles from the Fish River, are
not on the falls to that river—a tributary of the
Macquarie River which flows north-westerly to
the Darling River—but are actually on the eastern
watershed of the Great Dividing Range, and occur
in a deep valley, which contributes its waters to
the Cox River, an affluent of the Nepean and
Hawkesbury Rivers which reaches the coast at
Broken Bay.
The Caves are situated about 36 miles in a direct
line south-east from Bathurst. But they are only
about 35 miles by road from the Tarana railway
station ;* and though there is a well-made road from
Bathurst via Oberon, tourists usually prefer the
shorter route from Tarana, which also passes near
Oberon. The greater distance, however, involved
by taking the Bathurst road, is somewhat compen-
sated for by the fine scenery to be obtained from
the Macquarie Plains, the Fish River Valley at
O’Connell, and the extensive view of the country,
so diversified with plains and hills, to be seen
towards the north when ascending the “ Mount.”
The road from Tarana is also not without natural
objects of much interest. Within 2 miles from
Tarana are some huge bosses of granite perched
on the summit of the hill known as Evan’s Crown.
These remarkable rocks, which stand out very con-
spicuously amidst the forest-covered ranges, are
splendid examples of atmospheric denudation.
They are the remaining portions of the mass of
granite that once surrounded them, and are the
silent witnesses of the enormous denudation which
eroded the present valleys and swept away that
granitic mass : they therefore teach instructive
lessons in physical geology.
Shortly after leaving Tarana the road crosses the
Fish River at the Mutton’s Falls Bridge, and then
for 6 miles it ascends granite hills until an elevation
of 3,511 feet above sea-level, or 950 feet above
Tarana, is attained. The next 10 miles, over undu-
lating country of sihxrian schist and sandstone
formation, bring us near to the village of Oberon.
Just beyond this point, and where the road passes
Mr. Charles Whalan’s residence, there is a pictu-
resque view looking down into the valley of the
Fish River Creek. The grassy hills and alluvial
flats here seen, afford rich pasturage, and mark the
site of one of the earliest settlements in the district
made about forty years ago.
If we except the scenery on the Fish River Creek
and the Duckmaloi River (two clear running streams
forming the sources of the Fish River), and the
Great Dividing Range which is crossed at an altitude
of 4,120 feet above the sea, there is little else than a
forest of gum trees to engage attention, until the
road suddenly comes to the end of a high range, at
a spot called the “Top Camp.” From this point
looking towards the east a fine view may be obtained.
Immediately in the foreground lies a deep valley,
and in it, not a mile distant, are seen craggy masses
of grey limestone, in which the caves are situated ;
beyond this the valley gradually widens, with wooded
hills rising, as it were, one behind the other, up into
high ranges on either side ; whilst in the extreme
distance appear the Blue Mountains marked with
that horizontal line of yellow sandstone cliffs, which
indicates the Hawkesbury sandstone formation over-
lying the Coal Measures. The finest view of the
valley of the Cox (Kunimbla Valley), and one which
cannot be seen from any point on the Blue Mountains,
is obtained on the road from Hartley to Oberon, on
the range leading up from the Cox River to Mount
Binda. These are views instructive indeed to either
artist or geologist.
From the “Top Camp,” an excellent road has
been formed down the side of the steep range to a
running creek, where there is a small patch of level
ground convenient for camping upon, just above the
entrance to the Grand Archway; the actual descent
in this distance is 1,200 feet, and we are here 2,450
feet above sea level. This creek—“ Camp Creek ”
is a south-western branch of McEwan’s Creek, which
latter comes from a north-westerly direction.
Only about 50 yards above their junction these
creeks emerge from two large archways or natural
tunnels. The arch, known as the “Grand Arch,”
under which the Camp Creek flows, is 450 feet long,
from 35 to 180 feet wide, and from 40 to 60 feet high;
its width and height vary according to the irregular
projections of the sides and roof. On the floor are
scattered here and there huge fallen masses of the
limestone rock, some of the exposed surfaces of which
have been highly polished by the traffic over them
of wallabies and other wild animals, and exhibit
fine sections of the fossil corals and shells of which
the limestone is composed. It is not uninteresting
to reflect that the limestone, now a compact grey
marble, was once a mass of living corals, “stone
lilies,” and mollusks, revealing the former exist-
ence, in the Siluro-Devonian epoch, of conditions of
marine life somewhat resembling those which sup-
, port the beautiful living forms which build up the
* There is also a good road to the Caves from Mount Victoria
via Hartley and Bowenfells. This route has already been des-
cribed by Mr. John Lucas, M.P., in his account of a visit to
the Caves, which was published in the Sydney Morning Herald,
June 5, 1863.


reefs in the coral seas of the present day; and
it is significant of the vast changes that this part of
tiie surface of the earth has undergone, when we
see fresh-water streams, at an elevation of several
thousand feet above the sea, now flowing through
rocks that were originally formed beneath the waves
of the ocean at a very remote period of the earth’s
history. These silent rock-teachings give addi-
tional charm to the many interesting features of
these caves.
The floor of the Grand Archway is in some parts
of red earth, the thickness of which has yet to
be ascertained. The above-mentioned worn and
polished edges of the rocks indicate that, for a long
time, this cave has been the resort of wild animals,
and probably of man also, whose remains will
doubtless be found here. Masses of breccia occur
in places, consisting of large and small pieces of
limestone and other rocks cemented together with
carbonate of lime. Thin veins of nitre, or saltpetre,
occur in this breccia, and also filling crevices in
the solid rock of the walls. This nitre has been
chemically formed, by oxidation of the ammonia
given off during the decomposition of the excrement
of animals. Nitric acid is thus produced, which,
combining with some of the potash and other
alkalies present in the earth and rocks, forms an
impure variety of saltpetre.
There are several small chambers leading off
from^ this Grand Archway, such as the “Bacon
Cave and the “ Dormitory ” —an opening high up
in the eastern wall, in which visitors generally
camp at night; but these are of minor importance.
After very heavy rains the water of the Camp
Creek flows through the Grand Archway, but at
other times it disappears from the creek bed just
above the upper entrance, passes through some un-
known underground channel, and comes out again
in the bed of the creek a few yards below the lower
or north-eastern entrance. This entrance is much
larger than the upper one and consists of a lofty and
wide arch. Its dark gray roof and walls, with the
huge fallen masses of rock piled irregularly on the
ground, present a very imposing sight, especially
when the early morning sun enters, and lights up the
dark rocky recesses. There are very few stalactites
in this cave.
The other great arch is the “Easter Cave,” for-
merly called the “Devil’s Coach-house. ” This is also
a l° n g natural tunnel, and through it the McEwan’s
Creek flows. It is of considerable height in its
northern portion, but towards the southern it is
divided, as it were, into two stories. The upper one
forms a fine and spacious cavern; and on the western
side there is a recess in which are some fine stalactites
and stalagmites of very grotesque forms. Near these
is a large and deep circular opening in the floor, of
which visitors should beware. From the centre of
the cavern an ascent is made by a wire rope-ladder
to a height of 37 feet on to an overhanging ledge
where there is a narrow entrance into another
cave, known as the “Bell Cave,” which, on the
left hand, about 60 feet towards the south, has a
wide opening on to the side of the hill; while on
the right, a long narrow passage leads off to the
“Belfry”—a small chamber in which are five or
six singular stalactites hanging close together.
These stalactites, when struck, give out sonorous
musical tones resembling a chime of bells. In this
cave there is an interesting thin stalactite, reaching
from the roof to the floor, and of almost uniform
diameter throughout its entire length. From the
southern entrance a pathway steeply ascends the
side of the range, and, before reaching the summit,
passes under the Carlotta Arch, a beautiful natural
arch, about 60 feet high and 40 feet wide, having
its span ornamented with stalactites. It forms a
narrow bridge connecting two prominent portions of
the rugged limestone ridge which, like a huge stone
dam, extends across the Camp Creek and McEwan’s
Creek valleys. One high point on this ridge is called
the Pinnacle, and forms a conspicuous object in the
landscape; its large craggy masses of white and grey
limestone, with the various kinds of trees growing
amongst them, give it a very picturesque appearance.
The limestone forms a belt from 200 to 400 yards
wide, extending almost directly across the main
valley; and we thus see that the two principal
creeks which drain the valley, instead of cutting
down this barrier of limestone during the erosion
of the valley, found it easier to excavate subterran-
ean channels for their waters, and so formed these
natural tunnels.
The erosion of the present valleys took place
chiefly during the Pliocene Tertiary epoch. There
is no reason therefore why we may not expect to
find in the loam and gravel deposits in the caves,
remains of the Diprotodon, Thylacoleo, and other
extinct animals of the Pleistocene period, together
with the earliest traces of man on this part of
Australia.
The limestone is of Palaeozoic Siluro-Devonian
age, and interbedded with strata of sandstone and
shale; its strike is north sto 10 degrees west.
Amongst the fossils which it contains are the genera
favosites, cyathophyllum, heliolites and othoceras,
besides crinoids and bivalve shells, too imperfectly
preserved for identification.
Near Camp Creek, about 10 chains above the
caves, an intrusive mass of porphyritic greenstone
occurs between the limestone and shales; the
latter are very indurated in the vicinity of it.
Mr. Charles Whalan states that the caves were
discovered about the year 1841, when his father,
the late Mr. James Whalan, and two mounted
police, were in search of the notorious bushranger
McEwan, whom they captured in a small hut not
far from the caves.
The Lucas and Elder Caves are described as fol-
lows by Mr. Lamont, H. G. Young, C.E., F.G.S.,
Geological Surveyor, who, with Mr. Cambridge,
surveyed them :
The Lucas Cave, as will be seen by the plan, is
the larger; the entrance to it is situated on the east
side of the belt of limestone that runs in a north
and south direction through the surrounding
country. The entrance of the cave is spacious, but
narrows almost at once, and then opens out again
into a very large chamber. As the Lucas Cave is
principally composed of a series of large chambers,
connected by narrow passages, a description of this
first one will apply to the others, which have all

the same characteristics, more or less modified.
The caves were at the time of our visit exception-
ally dry; and from the stains on the stalagmitic
formations and the scarcity of forms undergoing
accretion, it would appear that in places some time
has elapsed since the period when active growth
was taking place. The limestone seems to have been
quite washed out of situ, and carried to considerable
distance before being at all liberated from solution,
as but few stalagmites, and scarcely any stalactites
are to be seen ; only here and there are exceptional
stalagmites, generally of very massive form, but
still quite dwafted by the height of the roof above
them. Round the walls however are numerous
fringes and mantels of carbonate of lime, “curtain
stalactites, ” and from their banded appearance when
viewed by transmitted light, it is evident they have
been deposited in long thin lines, and not as the
pointed varieties by drop accretions; this would
not be at all singular were the different coloured
bands strictly horizontal or of unequal breadth
throughout as then it would be easy to imagine a
line of dependent moisture slowly depositing the
lime it held in solution, but these bands are often in
places quite vertical, gradually rounding off at their
lower extremity, and of equal breadth throughout
their entire length. For this appearance it may be
supposed that the growth of the mantel is very slow,
and that the edges were never laden with water, but
merely moist. The various tints of the bands is
doubtless due to the greater or less amount of iron
held in solution by the water at different periods.
The floors of these chambers are more or less
covered with blocks of limestone, often of consider-
able size, that have fallen from the roof and sides,
and have afterwards been wasted, and cemented
together by carbonate of lime deposited from perco-
lating waters. In many places the ground is
covered with a red clay-like substance, and in one
instance, namely the Bride’s Chamber, there is
plainly to be seen an infall of red clay of extremely
plastic nature, coming in from above, where it has
doubtless been accumulated in some older fissure.
Occasionally one meets with evident deposits of
bat-droppings. At several spots, high above a
man’s height, are to be seen old water-lines, so
strongly marked, that it is certain the level of the
water must have remained constant for considerable
periods of time. In the lowest portion of the Lucas
Cave there is a pool of exceeding clearness ; it
appears to have little if any flow, and several ex-
periments we made gave no satisfactory result.
The well-rounded but small entrances and exits
to these larger chambers, the absence of propor-
tionally large stalactitic growths, the waterlines high
up on the wall, the large blocks, and fine mud on
the floors, and the still pools in the lowest portions
of the caves, all seem to show that these large
chambers have been the successive reservoirs of
pools of water, which while lying in them have
rapidly deepened the chamber by taking up the
limestone forming their bed into solution, at the
same time that they heightened it by the water
creeping into the natural joints of the rock, and
causing large blocks to fall down from the sides and
roof. As the lime-laden waters gradually found
their way through those portions of the rock (form-
ing their basin), which were most easily attacked,
they must have enlarged these, and finally reached
some fresh portion of the limestone deposit, in
which, whether from its being less easily attacked,
or some other reason, a fresh chamber has been
formed.
In many places the floors of the chambers and
galleries give a hollow sound on being tapped, and
a proper inspection of these might lead to the dis-
covery of organic remains. In reference to this it
might be interesting to note the successive deposits
laid open in the celebrated Kent’s Hole Cave, near
Torquay, Devonshire, England. “The cavern con-
sists of a number of branching chambers of various
shapes and dimensions. The complete succession
of deposits from above downwards, is : (a) fallen
blocks of limestone, cemented by carbonate of lime ;
(h) dark mud, chiefly composed of decayed veget-
able matter (black mould); (c) a layer of granular
stalagmite ; (d) charred wood, &c. (black band);
(e) cave earth; (f) crystalline stalagmite; (g)
breccia. The series is not always so complete as is
here stated ; but wherever all the deposits are
found in one and the same vertical section the order
of superposition is clear and invariable, and else-
where the succession, though defective, is never
transgressed.
“ The highest beds contain bones of animals still
living in Devonshire; but when we reach the granu-
lar stalagmite, we come across the remains of
animals which are no longer found in Britain.
Here we find hyaena, rhinoceros, bear, lion, and a
host of other animals, and with them the remains of
man. In the crystalline stalagmite and the breccia
the remains are often exclusively those of the bear,
but occasionally bones of the lion and the fox
occur. Here, too, remains of man are found, but
his implements are of a decidedly ruder type than
are those found in the hyaena beds above.”*
There appear to have been two distinct periods
during which stalactitic growth formed ; one of
comparatively remote age, and very local in charac-
ter, being chiefly confined to the caves known as
the Lurline and Bone Caves, and another but re-
cent, and still in operation. The older growth is
essentially of a stalactitic type, and the stalactites
are remarkably thick ; though, in one or two cases,
as in Chamber No. I, a huge stalagmite is to be
seen. The newer growth exhibits every fantastic
and beautiful form known, from the thin hollow
reed and transparent veil, to the snow-white dome
stalagmites, the crystal-fringed pool, the wave-
lined floor, and the crooked-fringed shapes that are
turned in all directions.
Though on the plan the chief features of the
caves are indicated, it is very possible that many
other places exist of a size worthy of being repre-
sented, for the sides of all the chambers and
galleries are lined with numerous cavities and cracks
which might easily lead to large apertures, and
even chambers. It is in these small crevices, and in
some of the passages, that the newer growth above
referred to is taking place, and as it is of a more

brittle and much whiter character than the older
and more massive deposits, the official guide should
pay particular attention to its preservation ; a small
and beautifully white stalactite is much more attrac-
tive as a specimen than a portion of an old yellow one
(that it takes two men to girth); and that such is the
universal opinion is in places very practically de-
monstrated, still, as a whole, the contents of the
caves have been properly respected as regards ap-
propriation, though in many places the most beauti-
ful of the growths have been sadly disfigured by
having names written across them. It may be sug-
gested that in one or two spots, removed from any
stalactitic growth, spaces be reserved where those
visitors who wished might inscribe their names.
In the cave known as the Bone Cave fragments
of bones have been found. But the special bone, to
which the guide Wilson generally calls attention,
is so covered with a stalagmitic growth that it is
impossible to say whether it is a bone or not. The
Bone Cave, as before remarked, and the caves in
its immediate neighbourhood, have a distinctive
character, that is, they are splendidly draped and
pillared by massive stalactites, and sheets of stalac-
titic growth. On the floor of this cave, which is the
one in which Mr. Hart took his admirable photo-
graphs by the magnesium light, is a peculiar woolly-
looking growth—tufts of carbonate of lime, so to
sa y—which appear to cover an earthy deposit.
The prettiest spots in the Lucas Cavern are the
Bone and Lurline Caves above mentioned. There is
a pretty group in the Bride’s Chamber, and though
it is very small the forms are various and very
perfect. It is in the neighbourhood of this spot
that a profusion of the transparent hollow reeds
and curling finger-like shapes are to be seen. Not
far from the Bride’s Chamber, and before coming
to it, there is a place where, across a deep cleft, is
to be seen a large white mantel, most beautifully
folded. On leaving the chamber from which the
Bride’s branches off, there are, on the right hand,
some fine_ sheets of stalactite, that can be lit up
from behind and thus made to show their semi-
transparency. Close to the entrance of the gallery
leading from the first large chamber there stands
an enormous stalagmite that is worthy of notice.
Another spot that is unique in its way is the end of
the passage that leads from the Bone Cave, where
there are some very pretty pillars.
The entrance into the Elder Cave is on the crown
of the ridge, about 70 yards north-west of the
Carlotta Arch. This cave is highly interesting, as
it is filled in places with a pebble drift of the most
varied kind; the pebbles differ in size from £of an
inch to 1 foot in diameter; they are in places
covered with a deposit of carbonate of lime, and
are cemented together very compactly by the same
material. Some consist of quartz, granite, quartz
porphyry, Lydian-stone, slate, and sandstone. The
bottom of this cave is very difficult of access,
but the drift is seen to be at least 30 feet thick.
This drift should certainly be prospected. Near
the bottom of this cave are some very white
stalactites and stalagmites.
The sides of all the caves, where free from
stalactitic growth, were much corroded, though
not in the groved manner exhibited by the
limestone where exposed to the rain; they
gave one the idea of having been kept con-
stantly covered with a film of water, and
doubtless the moist atmosphere of the interior of
the caves, when they contain pools of water, is
favourable to such a state. In many places num-
bers of fossil coralline forms stand out from the
mass of the rock, no doubt from being less easily
dissolved by the carbonic acid in the water, and
in one place where there was a wallaby track
occurs a most highly-polished surface of rock,
it is almost startling to observe how crowded
with fossil forms it is. This rock would make
very ornamental and interesting paper weights, &c.
If visitors wanted a souvenir of the caves they
could desire nothing better than a piece of this
beautiful rock, of which there is a boundless supply,
and which can be so easily worked up into articles
of virtu.
It is a difficult task to name the points of special
attraction in these caves where there is so much
both to interest and please; the more so per-
haps as the relative excellence of a series
of forms of beauty must always be decided
by individual taste ; still one might point to
the Easter Cave, as perhaps the most beautiful, as
it certainly is the grandest. This cave too, possesses
the double advantages of day-light, and an easy
access; and derives no small part of its charms,
from the contrast between the wooded hillside, that
is seen framed by one of the massive arches, which
give this spot its grandeur; and, the stalagmitic
depositions which have been profuse, and which,
whether as the pinnacled column of stalagmite, or
the gracefully folded ‘ ‘ curtain stalactites, ” and the
boulders covered with ripple marks, that reflect a
thousand jets of light from the facets of the crystals
forming their surface, combine to form an harmoni-
ous and pleasing picture. At one moment the
vastness and silence under the dome fix the attention
of the observer on the mute but beautiful forms
that Time has slowly amassed under it; at the next
the wild song of the lyre-bird re-echoes through
the vault and draws the eye to the sunlit forest
slopes without.
And here it is perhaps not out of place to trace
some steps in the course of Time that are forcibly
presented to us ; what a circle in the laws of nature
is suggested by this scene : First, the decaying
vegetation of some ancient forest is invisibly dis-
tilling the gas known as carbonic acid; then a
storm of rain falls, clearing the air of the noxious
gas, and distributing a thousand streamlets of acid
water over the surrounding country, and which as
it drains off, not only wears the rocks it passes over,
but dissolves them in minute quantities, especially
such as contain much lime, and then, laden with its
various compounds flows off to the distant sea,
where reef corals, lying in fringing banks round the
coast are slowly obsorbing the lime from the water
around them, and building the fragile coatings that
protect them during life: Slowly as the land
sinks the coral bank increases in height, for

reef corals can only live near the surface of the
water; and soon a considerable thickness has
been obtained; while below the upper zone
of live corals lies a vast charnel-house of dead
coral coverings; then comes a change : suitable tem-
perature, or some other essential condition, fails,
killing out all the corals, and through long ages
other deposits accumulate over them, gradually
crushing and consolidating the coral bank into a
firm rock. At last a convulsion of the earth’s
crust brings it up from the buried depth in which
it lies, leaving it tilted on its edge, but still, per-
haps, below the surface of the ground ; rain, frost,
and snow slowly removes what covers it, until it
lies exposed again to the sunlight, but so changed
that only for the silent but irresistible testimony of
the fossil forms of which it is composed, it were
hard to believe that this narrow band of hard grey
rock was once the huge but fragile coral bank
glistening in the bright waters with a thousand
hues. And now the process is repeated ; the decay-
ing vegetation of the surrounding forest produces the
carbonic acid, the rains spread it over the ground,
which is now the most favourable for being dis-
solved, and the consequence is that the acid water
saturates itself with the limestone rock, and when-
ever the least evaporation takes place, has to
deposit some of its dissolved carbonate of lime in
one of the many stalactitic forms, before it can flow
off to the sea and distribute its remaining contents
to fresh coral banks.
Thus the old coral reef melts away far inland,
and the lime that formed the coatings of its corals
is again utilized for the same purpose. What a
simple succession of causes and effects, and yet
before the circle is completed long ages of time
have come and gone; and what a fine example of the
balance between the waste and reproduction that
takes place in nature.
The huge arches under which the streams flow,
and the airy span of the Carlotta Arch, cannot fail
to excite the admiration of all observers.
