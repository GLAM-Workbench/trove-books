HYMNS.
No. 1.
No. 3.
Great Lord of wisdom, life and light,
Before the hills were founded,
Thy quickening breath dissolved the night,
And stirred through deeps unsounded.
Beneath Thv hand the formless earth
And ocean rolled asunder,
And in Thy likeness man had birth,
Thy crowning work and wonder.
Lord of our life, and God of our salvation,
Star of our night, and Hope of every nation,
Hear and receive Thy Church's supplication,
Lord God Almighty.
See round thine ark the hungry billows curling ;
See how Thy foes their banners are unfurling;
Lord, while their darts envenomed they are hurling,
Thou canst preserve us.
Through that grey dawn thou calledst him,
Untaught but not unheeding.
His feet were faint, his lamp was dim,
Yet Faith discerned Thy leading.
Age after age and line on line
Thy Book unfolded clearer,
Till, like a flush of morn divine,
Lord, Thou canst help when earthly armour faileth,
Lord, Thou canst save when deadly sin assaileth,
Lord, o'er Thy Church nor death nor hell prevaileth,
Grant us Thy peace, Lord.
Grant us Thy help till foes are backward driven,
Grant them Thy Truth, that they may be forgiven,
Grant peace on earth, and, after we have striven,
Peace in Thy Heav'n. Amen.
Thy Son proclaimed Thee nearer.
His Word from East to slumbering West
Went out for all creation ;
Our far-off islands woke and blest
Thy Name with adoration.
We kneel where our forefathers knelt,
They trode these courts before us ;
Unseen, though near, our hearts have felt
Their blessings wafted o'er us.
No. 2.
The Son of God goes forth to war,
A Kingly crown to gain;
His blood-red banner streams afar !
We thank Thee, Lord, for these our sires,
Whose faith in power, out-welling,
Through flood, through field, through martyr fires,
Hath wrought by love compelling.
Still breathe on us, great Lord of morn,
That zeal of Saints and Sages;
So tongues unheard and isles unborn
Shall hymn Thy praise through ages.
Who follows in His train ?
Who best can drink his cup of woe,
Triumphant over pain,
Who patient bears his cross below,
He follows in His train.
We bless Thy Name, for one and all,
Who founded for Thy glory
Each low-built shrine, each minster tall,
The Martyr first, whose eagle eye
Could pierce beyond the grave;
Who saw his Master in the sky,
And call'd on Him to save.
To teach mankind Thy story.
May we, their sons, our lamp display
Of love and wisdom burning,
Till twilight melt in golden day
At our dear Lord's returning. Amen.
Like Him, with pardon on his tongue
In midst of mortal pain,
He pray'd for them that did the wrong
Who follows in his train ?
No. 4.
A glorious band, the chosen few
On whom the Spirit came,
Twelve valiant Saints, their hope they knew,
And mock'd the cross and flame.
God the All-terrible ! King, Who ordainest,
Great winds Thy clarions, the lightnings Thy sword;
Show forth Thy pity on high where Thou reignest,
Grant to us peace, O most merciful Lord.
They met the tyrant's brandish'd steel,
The lion's gory mane,
They bow'd their necks, the death to feel;
Who follows in their train ?
God the Omnipotent! Mighty Avenger,
Watching invisible, judging unheard;
Doom us not now in the day of our danger;
Grant to us peace, O most merciful Lord.
A noble army, men and boys,
The mstron and the maid,
God the All-merciful! Earth hath forsaken
Thy ways of blessedness, slighted Thy Word ;
Bid not Thy wrath in its terrors awaken ;
Grant to us peace, O most merciful Lord.
Around the Saviour's Throne rejoice
In robes of light array'd.
They climb'd the steep ascent of Heav'n
Through peril, toil, and pain ;
O God, to us may grace be given
To follow in their train. Amen.
So shall Thy children, in thankful devotion,
Praise Him Who saved them from peril and sword .
Singing in chorus from ocean to ocean, '
Peace to the Nations, and praise to the Lord. Amen-
GRACIOUS KING.
GOD SAVE OUR
O Lord our God arise,
Scatter our enemies,
And make them fall;
God save our gracious King,
Long live our noble King,
God save the King.
Send him victorious,
Confound their politics,
Frustrate their knavish tricks,
On Thee our hopes we fix,
God save us all.
Happy and glorious,
Long to reign over us;
God save the King.
gifts in
Thy choicest
store,
On him be pleased to pour,
Long may he reign.
May he defend our laws,
And ever give us cause,
To sing with heart and voice,
God save the King.
