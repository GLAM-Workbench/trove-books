THE DRUID CUSTODIANS? GUIDE.
Sing praises to Cod who rules in the Sun,
The Heavenly Universe grand,
The Allwise Creator, Eternal One,
Sing His praises on sea and land.
The Key of Heaven is the Druids? guide,
In memory be it engraved;
Sing it on the Sun?s day at eventide,
That the world from wrong may be saved.
On Sun?s day to the Sun consecrated,
The European race had its birth,
The third, last, and purest race created,
To bring Heaven?s justice to earth.
To Mt. Olympus on earth they were brought,
By the Muses their Godmothers;
To keep the race from mixing they were taught
Was their task above all others.
The Muses taught them about Creation,
How the Ailwise Sun-Cod made all,
Who has Hijs great white throne in the bright Sun
In the tenth circle above all.
On the left sits fair Juno, dutiful,
Goddess of Marriage, Heaven?s queen;
At her side her twelve daughters beautiful
Breathe love on mortals who good mean.
At the right-hand stands humane Apollo,
Of Juno?s twelve sons the eldest,
Whom wise mortals love and fondly follow,
Of Heaven?s sons, wisest and best.
The Muses and Guardian angels fulfil
What Cods and Goddesses direct;
And the Universe obeys every will
Of Jupiter, its Architect.


Swinging below the divine Sun so bright,
One hundred million miles away,
The earth turns around making day and night,
For mankind to work, rest and play.
Like a pendulum earth crosses, in Spring
And Autumn, the stars? equator;
Thus to earth the Winter and Summer bring,
With blessings from the Creator.
Three hundred million miles from the Sun clear,
The Milky Way radiant and bright,
Bounds the Universe, which turns every year
Around the Sun, Giver of light.
in the shining Sun ten circles divide
The many grades of advancement;
From the sixth to tenth Immortals abide
Above the River of Judgment.
Below that dark river which swiftly runs,
Suff?ring aches and pains as on earth,
Are the five circles of earth?s evil ones
Awaiting their immortal birth.
The swinging earth is the primary school
For the three created races;
In which they must learn their bodies to rule,
And find in the stars their places.
When frail man?s career on the earth is run,
The body to the earth returns;
But, like to like, he goes back to the Sun,
And joins those to whom his heart yearns.
Thus after death, with justice unerring,
Man will reap just what he has sown,
In communities, like to like, sharing
With those whose aim is like his own.


the Muses and the divine Apollo
Brought to earth the African race,
To have dominion over all below,
And make earth a heavenly place.
But the black race fast degenerated,
And lived but an animal life;
Then the rays from the Sun were abated,
And ice floods soon ended the strife.
Then the Muses once again descended,
And brought the Asiatic race;
In ten thousand years their era ended,
And ice floods finished their disgrace.
The Muses and Angel Olympians
Brought to earth?s Mt. Olympus then
Twelve male and twelve female Europeans,
Like Juno?s twenty-four children.
The Muses nursed and trained them in childhood,
And Angels taught the boys building,
And to breed cattle, make boots, and grow food;
The girls to make woollen clothing.
In this golden age of Europeans
All the Cods frequented the earth,
To urge them to live like Olympians,
And prepare for immortal birth.
And with joyfulness the sweet Cod of Love
Cave to each man a loving wife,
And Juno sent her blessing from above
On their start in true married life.
John and his wife May were chosen to reign
Over the national village,
in which all could food and shelter obtain,
From happy childhood to old age.


Sixty years that golden age continued,
Then some strangers were entertained,
And repaid kindness with ingratitude,
And their wickedness Europe stained.
The Cods returned to the Glorious Sun,
When the colored people drew nigh,
For they knew that mischief would soon be done
By degen?rates who cheat and lie.
The crafty strangers soon got borrowers
To overthrow the Government;
Then King John and his loyal followers
Left the scene of discontentment.
In West Europe John left a village band,
To build up Nationalism;
The rest went to Britain, the White Island;
There King John founded Druidism.
Nations were formed by that generation,
In Eastern Europe and Russia;
These live in the Taurus constellation,
So said Apollo, man?s teacher.
British Druids of that generation,
In Orion?s delightful shades,
Still lead universal education;
Irish Druids rule the Pleyades.
In the Milky Way belt circling the skies,
Which the Sun holds by Attraction,
Europeans all those stars supervise,
After their judgment in the Sun.
The European Belt of the Milky Way
Covers half of the skies? expanse;
In the lion?s quarter Africans stay,
The Fish Asiatics enhance.


To the Sons of Europe Apollo taught
That a soul is born in the Sun,
And to the earth it comes as quick as thought,
When a body is fit for one.
In the Sun?s circles six, seven and eight
The soul receives instinct and art;
In nine and ten in Olympian State
The Cods to it Reason impart.
Then through its kingdom it passes to earth,
Receiving its last commandment,
To be loyal to the race of its birth,
And glory in its advancement.
The Soul knows from which kingdom in the Sun
It came and must never disown;
And could it save one race from destruction,
Instinctively would save its own.
When Africans other races demean,
The African race claims the seed;
When Asiatic weds European,
The soul is Asiatic breed.
The persons who prefer another race,
And thus their own kindred disown,
In the Sun and Stars will all find their place
With those whose likes are like their own.
When the body dies it to earth returns,
But the Soul goes back to the Sun,
And, like birds of a feather, it adjourns
To those it is fit companion.
Below the River of Justice it wears,
Like clothes and body as on earth,
And it has aches and pains and other cares,
Until it wins immortal birth.


When all its companions the earth have left,
And been judged in Purgatory,
If from all evil it is not bereft,
To a star goes probatory.
The Stars for each race are of two classes:
In one class the Refined hold sway;
In the other greed controls the masses,
Who on earth chose to live that way.
And there the evil must their evil end,
And their base, greedy ways unlearn,
Before their evils of earth they amend,
And so Immortal bodies earn.
If a soul on earth has been unselfish,
And true to its nation and race,
It then crosses the River of Justice,
And with Immortals takes its place.
Then, being immortal and beautiful,
It is freed from ail aches and pains,
As Guardian Angel is dutiful
To friends who on the earth remain.
When from earth its friends have all departed,
Then its guardianship is done;
In a Star with its likes it is started
On its journey to Perfection.
Then its memory will be unfolded,
And incidents will be recalled,
Which on the earth journey had been noted,
To be carefully overhauled.
And its body will be faultlessly tuned
To obey the will of the soul;
Accomplishments it had will be resumed,
With instruments under control.


Then no hindrance will the genius meet
From sordid men?s antipathy,
For, like to like, his companions will greet
His work with loving sympathy.
And man and wife will be loyal and true,
Joined in loving affinity;
Yet far deeper love will the souls have who
On earth married felicitly.
And quick as thought the Immortals can speed
To celebrations near or far;
Immortal life is happiness indeed
In the home life in Sun or Star.
With the Immortals the honor most sought
Is at Festivals in the Sun
To be ordered to appear at the court
Of Jupiter, Eternal One.
The soul gets a glimpse of pure life above,
In the brief moments when it feels
The ecstacy of Music, Art, or Love,
And almost from its bodv steals.
Then let each race stand by whatever tends
To its advancement on the earth;
For the soul?s place in Sun and Star depends
On its individual worth.
Cast away all kinds of feelings bitter,
And worshin the Eternal One.
The loving, Allwise Sun-Cod Jupiter,
The Father of all Creation.
And give rev?rence to beautiful Juno,
And her affectionate children,
That you may with love and refinement grow
To merit bliss Olympian.
IRE-LICET
