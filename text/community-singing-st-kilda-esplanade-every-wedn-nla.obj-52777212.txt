Malvern Tramway’s Band.
WORLD TOUR.
A company, whose chief object will be to make it possible for the
Malvern Tramways Band to tour the Empire in 1924, will be floated
at a public meeting in the Malvern Town Hall on Thursday, May 3,
1923, at 8 pan.
His Worship, the Mayor of Malvern, Or. Corney, has promised to
take the chair on this occasion.
The proposed capital of the company is £20,000, divided into 20,000
shares of £1 each, of which 15,000 will be offered for subscription,
payable 5/- per share on application. 5/- on allotment and the balance
in two calls of 5/ each,
The company is being formed for the purpose of promoting, finan-
cing and managing the Malvern Tramways Band for the purpose of
louring and competing for Championships in England in 1924, giving
concerts, recitals, etc. in Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain,
and in any other country, and the doing of all such things as are inci-
dental or conducive to the attainment of the above objects.
On a very careful estimate it has been considered almost certain
that the Band, as the result of a proposed itinerary which will include
some 200 concerts, will receive for its services upwards of £40,000.
It is also considered likely that the Band will be engaged to represent
Australia at the Empire Exhibition in London commencing April, 1924,
and the Band will play a, prominent part in encouraging the right
type of emigration from Great Britain, France and Belgium.
Yon are heartily invited to attend this initial meeting and to
help the Band by taking out at least one share in this company. By
so doing you will be helping us to undertake a patriotic move of con-
siderable importance, and will also be associating yourself with a good
business proposition. Don't forget the meeting at the Malvern Town
Hall on Thursday, May 3.

MASSA’S IN DE COLD COLD
GROUND.
Round de meadows am a-ringin ’
Do darkies ’ mournful song,
While de mockin’ birds am singing’
Happy as de day am long.
Where de ivy am a-creepin’
O’er de grassy mound,
Dere ole massa am a-sleepin’
Sleepin’ in de cold, cold ground.
Chorus:
Down in de cornfields
Hear dat mournful sound;
All de darkies am a-weepin’
Massa's in de cold, cold ground.
When de autumn leaves are falling,
When de days were cold,
’Twas hard to hear ole massa calling,
’Cause he was so old.
Now- de orange tree am blooming,
On de sandy shore;
Now de summer days are coming,
Massa nebber calls no more.
Chorus.
SWEET AND LOW.
Sweet and low, sweet and low,
Wind of the western sea;
Low, low, breathe and blow,
Wind of the Western Sea,
Over the rolling waters go,
Come from the dying moon and blow;
Blow him again to me,
While my little one, while my pretty
one sleeps.
SWANEE RIVEE MOON.
Ist Verse:
1 am all alone 'way down in Dixie
Land,
Longing for you, dear, wishing you
were here,
But when shadows gather, I’m in
Fairy-land,
Dreaming that you’re near, while
the stars appear,
I’m waiting dear, for you, to make my
dreams come true.
Chorus;
Swanee River Moon, Swanee River
Moon, shining on my cabin door,
I’m for ever dreaming, while you’re
brightly beaming,
Every night I need you more, I’m
lonely;
Shine out bright, to-night, with your
silv’ry light,
For my love is coming soon; on the
Swanee shore we’ll stroll once
more,
Dreamy Swanee River Moon.
2nd Verse:
Can’t you hear the Southland calling
from afar’
Fields of sugar cane, mocking birds
refrain,
Love will guide you on, just like the
evening star,
Till we meet again, down in Lover’s
Lane,
Some golden night in June, beneath
the southern moon.

DRINK TO ME ONLY WITH THINE
EYES.
Drink to me only with thine eyes,
And I will pledge with mine,
Or leave a kiss within the eup,
And I’ll not ask for wine;
The thirst that from the sonl doth rise
Doth ask a drink divine,
But might I of dove’s nectar sip,
i would not change for thine.
1 sent thee late a rosy wreath,
Not so much honoring thee,
As giving it a hope that there
It would not withered be;
But thou thereon didst only breathe,
And send ’st it back to me.
Since when it grows, and smells, 1
. swear,
Not of itself, but thee.
WALTZING MATILDA.
Once a jolly swagman camped by a
billabong,
l’nder the shade of a coolibah tree,
And he sang as he watched and waited
till his “Billy” boiled,
“You’ll come a-waltzing, Matilda,
with me.”
Waltzing, Matilda,
Waltzing, Matilda,
“You’ll come a-waltziug, Matilda,
with me.’ ’
And he sang as he watched and waited
till his “Billy” boiled,
“You’ll come a-waltzing, Matilda,
with me.”
Down came a jumbuck to drink at that
billabong,
Dp jumped the swagman and grab-
bed him with glee.
And he sang, as he shoved that jum-
buk in his tucker bag,
“You’ll come a-waltzing, Matilda
with me. ’ ’

“You’ll come a-waltzing, Matilda,

And he sang as he shoved that jum-

Dp rode the squatter, mounted on his
thoroughbred,
Down came the troopers —one, two.

“Whose’ that jolly jnmbuk you’ve got

HOME, SWEET HOME.
’Mid pleasures and palaces though we
may roam,
Be it ever so humble there’s no place
like home;
A charm from the skies seems to hal-
low us there,
Which, seek thro’ the world, is ne’er
met with elsewhere.
Chorus:
Home, Home, Sweet, Sweet Home,
Be it ever so humble, there’s no
place like home.
An exile from homo splendour dazzles
in vain,
O, give me my lowly thatched cottage
again;
The birds singing gaily, that came at
my call —
Give me these, with the peace of mind
dearer than all.
To thee I 'll return, overburdened with
care,
The heart’s dearest face will smile on
me there;
No more from that cottage again will
1 roam,
There’s no place like home; there’s no
place like home.

THE LAST ROSE OF SUMMER.
'Tis the lust rose of summer.
Left blooming alone;
All lier lovely companions
Are faded and gone;
So bower of her kindred.
No rosebud is nigh,
To reflect back her blushes
Or give sigh for sigh.
I’ll not leave thee, thou lone one.
To pine on the stem;
Since the lovely are sleeping,
Go sleep thou with them;
Thus kindly I scatter
Thy leaves o ’or the bed,
Where thy mates of the garden
Lie scentless and dead.
So soon may I follow
When friendships decay,
And from love’s shining circle
The gems drop away;
When true hearts lie withered.
And fond ones have flown,
Oh, who would inhabit
This bleak world alone?
MEN OF HARLECH.
Men of Harlech in the hollow,
Do ye hear like rushing billow
Wave on wave that surging follow
Battle’s distant sound?
’Tis the tramp of Saxon foemen,
Saxon spearmen, Saxon bowmen;
Be they knights or hinds or yeomen,
They shall bite the ground.
Loose the folds as under;
Flag we conquer under;
The placid sky now bright on high
Shall launch its bolts in thunder.
Onward, ’tis our country needs us:
He is bravest, he who leads us;
Honors self, now proudly heads us,
Cambria, God and Right.
Rocky steeps and passes narrow
Flash with spear and flight of arrow
Who would think of death or sorrow,
Death is glory now.
Hurl the reeling horsemen over,
Let the earth dead foemen cover;
Fat" of friend, of wife, or lover,
Trembles on a blow.
strands of life are riven.
Blow for blow is given,
In deadly lock or battle shock.
Ami mercy shrieks to Heaven.
Men of Harlech, young or hoary,
Would you win a name in story?
Strike for home, for life, or glory,
Cambria, God and Right.
Como Thon, all victorious Spirit,
Evermore Thy Church inherit,
Thine the praise, for Thine the merit.
Lord and life of all.
THE HARP THAT ONCE THROUGH
TARA’S HALLS.
The harp that once thro’ Tara’s halls
The soul of music shed
Now hangs as mute on Tara’s walls
As tho’ that soul had fled;
So sleeps the pride of former days,
So glory’s thrill is o ’er,
And hearts that one beat high for
praise
Now feel that pulse no more.
No more to chiefs and ladies bright
The harp of Tara swells;
The chord alone that breaks at night
Its tale of ruin tells;
Thus freedom now so seldom wakes:
The only throb she gives
Is when some heart indignant breaks
To show that still she lives.
ANNIE LAURIE.
Maxwellton braes are bonnie,
Where early fa’s the dew,
And it’s there that Annie Laurie
Gi’ed me her promise true,
Gi’ed me her promise true,
Which ne’er forget will be,
And for bonnie Annie Laurie
I 'd lay me down and dee.
Her brow is like the snaw drift,
Her neck is like the swan,
Her face it is the fairest
That e’er the sun shone on,
That e’er the sun shone on,
And dark blue is her e’e,
And for bonnie Annie Laurie
1 ’d lay me down and dee.

OLD FOLKS AT HOME.
Way down upon de Swanee ribber,
Far, far away,
Dere’s where my heart is turning
ebber,
Dere’s where de ole folks stray;
All up and down de whole creation
Sadly 1 roam,
Still longing for de ole plantation,
And for de ole folks at home.
, Chorus:
All de world am sad and dreary
Everywhere I roam;
Oh, darkies how my heart grows
weary,
Far from de ole folks at home.
All round de little farm I wander’d
When 1 was young,
De many happy days 1 squandered,
Many de songs I sung;
When J was playing wid my h rudder
Happy was I;
Oh, take me to my kind ole madder,
Dere let me live and die.
One little hut among de bushes,
One dat 1 love,
Still sadly to my mem ’ry rushes,
No matter where I rove;
When shall 1 see de bees adiumming
All round de comb?
When shall T hear de banjo strumming
Down in my good ole home?
SUEZ.
In old Suez, under mystic sky;
Near the old Red Sea, where the ships
go by;
There where the palm trees sway,
Your lips and eyes plead with me to
stay
In
Chorus:
Suez, wondrous Suez,
When I was raptured with your love
sigh;
All day,
And thru the night,
To be with you 1 cry;
V’hen you enfold me in your sweet
loving arms
1 feel the thrill of all your charms
dear;
Suez, wondrous Suez,
I lost my heart to you.
O, WHO WILL O’ER THE DOWNS
SO FREE? .
O, who will o’er the downs so free?
O, who will with me ride?
O, who will up and follow me
To win a blooming bride’
Her father he has lock’d the door,
Her mother keeps the key,
But neither door nor bolt shall part
My own true love from me!
I saw her bow’r at twilight grey,
’Twas guarded safe and sure;
I saw her bow’r at break of day,
’Twas guarded then no more!
The varlcts they were all asleep,
And none was near to see
The greeting fair that passed there
Between my love and me!
I promised her to come at night—
With comrades brave and true;
A gallant band with sword in hand
To break her prison through;
I promised her to come at night—
She’s waiting now for me.
And ere the dawn of morning light
I’ll set my true love free!

ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT.
Sleep my child, ami peace attend thee
All through the night:
Guardian angels God will send thee
All through the night:
Soft and drowsy hours are creeping,
Hill and vale in slumber steeping,
I my loving vigil keeping
All through the night.
While the moon her watch is keeping
All through the night;
While the weary world is sleeping
All through the night:
O’er thy spirit gently stealing
Visions of delight revealing,
Breathes a pure and holy feeling
All through the night.
Hark! a solemn bell is ringing,
Clear, through the night;
Thou, my love, are hoc v hi weird winging
Home, through the night;
Earthly dust from off the shaken,
By good angels art thou taken,
Houl immortal, shalt thou waken.
Home, through the night.
THE MARSEILLAISE.
Souls of .France, the day is dawning,
Let us go to meet its light!
See the tyrant’s host and the banners
of his boast
As he comes to crush our right;
Hear the voice of his soldiers arise
From the fields to the list bring skies.
They come with bitter hate to-day
To snatch our children and to slay.
To tear our dearest ones away;
Refrain:
T i arms, ye true and brave!
No tyrant shall enslave;
Msreli on! March on!
Right shall be one
By victory or the grave!
Let the sacred love of country
Now sustain our arms in the fight,
Being led by the flame of the freedom
that we claim
And defended by her might;
May victory march at our side
’Neath our banners flutt’ring wide!
’fill e ’en our enemy shall see
Thy splendid triumph, liberty,
Tb* glory thou hast won, and we!
Refrain.

So still do we love thee, dear Wales!

SUNSHINE ALLEY.
Ev’rybody loves their place of birth,

Chorus;
Sunshine Alley, where the hand or-
gans play,
Sunshine Alley, there I first saw light
of day,
Tho’ it’s humble and poor, ev’ry
heart’s a gem,
There the boys and the girls all say
“I)ese, Dose and Dem.”
Sunshine Alley, where they’re dead

Polks are pally, tho’ it’s tatters

And I’m proud 1 was born on that
little side street there,
It’s Gcd A’alley,
Old Sunshine Alley.
GUNDAGAI.
There’s a scene that Ungers in my
memory
Of an old bush home and friends I
long to see;
That’s why I am yearning just to be
returning
Along the road to Gundagai.
Chorus:
There’s a track winding back to an
old-fashioned shack along the
road to Gundagai,
Where the blue gums are growing and
the Alurrumbidgee’s llowing be-
neath that sunny sky,
Where my daddy and my mother are
waiting for me
And the pals of my childhood once
more I will see;

MOTHER MACHREE.
There’s a spot in me heart which no
colleen may own;
There’s a depth in me soul never
sounded or known;
There’s a place in mem’ry my life
that you fill,
\o other can take it—no one ever will.
Chorus:
Sure, 1 low; the dear silver that shines
in your hair,
And the brow that’s all furrowed and
wrinkled with care;
I kiss the dear fingers so toilworn for
me —
Oh! God bless you and keep you,
Mother Mach roc
Ev’ry sorrow or care in the dear days
gone by
Was made bright by the light of the
smile in your eye;
Like a candle that’s set in a window
at night,
Your fond love has cheered me, and
guided me right.

BLUE BIRD.
i Horatio Nieholls' Great Success .1.
Gown by the waters of Monterey,
Someone is dreaming alone,

Chanting their sweet lullabys.
Then to his heart comes melody
Somebody- sang, then he cries—
Chorus:
By the blue lagoon she’s waiting,
My Blue-bird!
How I long for that song,
Sweetest ever heard;
Where TJkalalies play,
Where skies are never grey,
By the blue lagoon she’s waiting,
My Blue-bird.

SALLY.
(The Great Chorus Song).
First Verse.
.Sally! do you remember the time,
When you lived down our alley?
Although it’s long ago—still I know,
In my heart there’s nothing else but
love will grow,
I don’t know much about bliss,
But believe me when I say this.
Ch oru s:
Sally! Sally! you brought the sun-
shine to our alley,
For on that midsummer morn, when
you were born,
You brought the scent of roses and
waving corn.
Sally! you made our alley a paradise
dropped from the sky.
But when you went away, went away.
All the birds and flowers seemed to
fade in a day,
For Sally! you took the sunshine
from our alley,
When you said Good-bye.

Omaha! Omaha! where the bright moon

Your vioce 1 hear, calling me near;
Golden star from afar down the path-

Guiding me back to where my lover

WYOMING.

When the sun is sinking in Wyoming,
When the ocean blue is turned to
gold,
lu my dreams 1 can hear a melody,

By the cabin door I see my mammy
With a little baby on her knee
Then comes back the Wyoming lullaby
Mammy used to sing to me—
When night is near that song 1 hear.
Chorus;
Go to sleep my baby, close your
pretty eyes,
Angels up above you peeping at you
dearie from the skies.
Great big moon is shining, stars be-
gin to peep,
Time for little piccaninnies to go to
sleep,
Piccaninnies time to go to sleep.

MALVERN TRAMWAYS BAND COMMUNITY CONCERTS.


Help the Malvern Tramways Band to forge a further link of Empire by
enabling them to appear in the Homeland in 1924,
BY GIBSON YOUNG.
Wherever I travel in the Commonwealth and New Zealand, and I know
intimately five States of Australia and both islands of the Dominions, th°
Malvern Tramways Band is always spoken of amongst musicians and others
interested in the band world, as the Champions of Australasia. The question
as often been asked: “When will we have the opportunity of hearing
this superb combination?” The time is now ripe for music lovers in Aus-
tralia and New Zealand to realise their hopes of hearing this band in action.
The reason for this curiosity and desire is not difficult to seek. The
Malvern Tramways Band in the last twelve years has made more band
history than any other brass band south of the equator. In ten recent
contests it has had ninety-five per cent, of successes, won A Grade contest
on six separate occasions, including three at South Street in consecutive
years, 1920, 1921 and 1922. Is it any wonder that the band is the idol of
the Commonwealth.
It is no exaggeration to state that five thousand people listen to this
band every Sunday afternoon and evening in Malvern, and the calls on its
time grow more and more impossible to fulfil as the years go on.
Mr. Chris. Smith, Conductor of the Besses of the Bam, and now resi-
dent in Adelaide, the greatest band expert at present resident in the Com-
monwealth, stated in conversation with me recently that the Malvern Tram-
ways Band was one of the best he had ever heard, either here or in the
United Kingdom. “The British people,” he said, “wall take the band to
its heart, and it has little to fear in any competition in which it takes part.”
This is indeed very great praise. The greatest amount of praise for this
state of affairs is due to Mr. Harry Shugg, the Bandmaster, who has proved
on many occasions that he has all the qualities necessary for a world-famed
Band Conductor. Mr. Shugg is still a very young man, and it can be confi-
dently said that his career has only just commenced.
The eyes of the British dominions in the south will follow the doings
of this band in the next two years with increasing interest and enthusiasm,
and the fact that they have decided to accept the challenge sent to them
from the Bellevue Committee in Manchester to compete there in 1924 should
in an enormous degree encourage band music generally throughout Australia
and New Zealand, for it proves that in another branch of musical endeavor
we, the youngest nation of the world, are comparing favorably with the
more matured countries of Europe.
You are earnestly requested to lend your very heartiest support to this
movement and to communicate with me what yon are prepared to do to make
this tour financially possible. A public company will be formed within the
next few months to raise the necessary funds, and we want this company
to represent as many of the community as possible. There may be some
of you who can only afford a single share in this undertaking, but all those
single shares will represent the heartfelt good wishes of each one of you
who takes them up, and it will also give you a financial interest in one
of the greatest musical undertakings which we in Australia have ever taken
on.
The Malvern Tramways Band.
