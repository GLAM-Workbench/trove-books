The 'Cuzco' Times.
CONDUCTED BY W. A. DARE AND W. SINCLAIR.
AUGUST 9, 1882.
To commence the first issue of any publi-
cation with an editorial explanatory of
its principles and views, political or
otherwise, is, we believe, the usual thing.
We intend, however, to illustrate the
truth of the old saw, that “there is an
exception to every rule,” and beg to
state in the most emphatic manner that
we are utterly unprincipled.
The sole object and aim of the Times
will be to chronicle the events of the
prssage, and to give, with the assistance
of our fellow passengers, a little light
reading of a miscellaneous nature to while
away the tedium of an occasional idle
hour. Our voyage, so far, has, with a
few trifling exceptions, been very plea-
sant. Let us hope that it will continue
so, and that each and all may leave the
Cuzco with some pleasant recollections of
our six weeks’ trip.
In conclusion, we hope that every one
will endeavour to do something to make
the Times worthy of perusal; and beg to
remind our readers that on them depends
the success or failure of the paper.
Hints to Contributors.— We must
ask our contributors to append their
signatures to any communications they
may favour us with —not necessarily for
publication, but merely as a guarantee of
good faith, Another point to which we
might call attention is the manner in
which articles should be written. Any
articles intended for publication should
be written legibly and with ink, on one
side of the paper only—our editorial
education having been sadly neglected on
the score of hieroglyphic inscriptions.
Concert. —A concert was held in the
second saloon on Friday evening, the 4th
August, at 7.30 p.m. ; but owing to the
haste in which the affair was got
up, it was hardly a success. The Rev.
Mr. Hunt’s song “Where is my boy
to-night?” and a German song by Herr
Hertzfeldt were most deserving of praise.
Next in order of merit were Mr. Patter-
son’s “Friar of Order Gray,” and Mr.
Langley’s “Haul on the bow-line.” It
would be unkind to criticise Mr. Edwards’
reading, as his voice and sight alike
failed him. In his palmy days he may
have been an elocutionist; now—but
we’ll forbear. Mr. Hilton’s reading —
“ Bardell v. Pickwick ” —was a little
better, but even in that there was con-
siderable room for improvement. Miss
Lowe’s “ Better Land ” didn’t seem to
cause anyone much anxiety on the score
of getting there. Mr. Lenehan was
rather too nervous, otherwise he is
undoubtedly our best vocalist. We must,
however, beg our fellow passengers to
remember that as our first entertainment
was given without any preparation what-
ever, it would have been unreasonable to
expect it to be as successful as if due time
had been bestowed on rehearsal. One
and the greateskobject has been effected,
viz., to give a start to our amusements.
It is to be hoped that our future enter-
tainments will be more deserving of
favourable criticism, as they undoubtedly
will be if all strive to promote the general
welfare in that respect.
Accident. An accident occurred
yesterday morning, by which one of the
softer sex in the second saloon was pre-
cipitated violently from her seat on to
the deck. We are, however, happy to
say that the fair damsel received no very
severe injuries, and is, as we write, pro-
gressing favourably towards recovery.
The cause of the disaster was, we believe,,
traced to the would-be aesthetic attitude
assumed by the lovely unfortunate. We
earnestly desire to dissuade all our
readers from doing likewise, lest more
serious results should ensue.
Pepper and. Salt.
Immediately on arrival at St. Vin-
cent, a party of several gentlemen were
observed to go ashore in great haste.
The reason has since transpired. It
appears that a dispute, or rather a series
of disputes, occurred during the run from
Plymouth to St. Vincent, and that two
of the disputants agreed to settle their
little differences a I' Anglais. As will be
seen from the report of our sporting
correspondent, the affair resulted in a
failure both for pluck and pugilism.
Several gentlemen in the first saloon
asked ladies to go ashore last Saturday,
but were refused, on the ground that no
ladies were going ashore, as it would
not do for one to go and the others to
remain on board. Yet some said they
thought the gentlemen might have offered
to escort the ladies ashore. This seems


rather hard on the male sex, especially as
they were sincere in their request.
Apropos of going ashore, those who
went were much disappointed, while
those who did not go, evinced their
superior wisdom in refraining from doing
SO.
Pugilistic Encounter between the
Cuzco Pet and the Irish Chicken,
on the Island of St. Vincent, on
sth August, 1882.
(By Our Special Sporting Exporter.)
At exactly half-past five o’clock, each
principal in separate boats, accompanied
by his seconds and all the requisites for
an affray of this description, which in all
human calculations gave promise of being
even better contested than the memorable
fight between Tom Sayers and Heenan ;
as so much animosity having been shown
by the Chicken and Pet, we all thoroughly
believed in the assertions loudly given by
both, that they would either kill or be
killed, and that if either were beaten
it would not be until such time as he
would be a fit patient for the Infirmary.
Hence the preparations by the seconds
and the two extra sized bags of restora-
tives, sponges, &c., which had caused
much trouble in collecting. Our journey
to shore was uneventful, the Pet’s party
being first to reach, and an involuntary
silent cheer burst from the lips of the
Pet’s party when they saw him spring
lightly to the shore, which was for ought
we knew to be his grave. Almost
immediately afterwards the Chicken’s
party arrived, and as the Irishman stepped
ashore, his manly form clad in flannels,
his hair pushed well back from his brow,
his breast heaving, his eyes gleaming eager
for the fray, we started in search of a
suitable spot. The betting at this time
was 2 to 1 on the Chicken, who loudly
proclaimed his superiority both in
science, stamina, and pluck; but so
loudly did the Pet now begin to talk,
that his followers took up all the money,
and were still so anxious that before we
got through the town, no more than 5
to 4 was obtainable against the Irishman.
We walked over hill and dale in search
of a suitable place, a favourable one was
at last found on a hill, the summit of
which we perched a look-out and a
referee (Mr. Henderson), Messrs. Brins-
mead and Pilley seconding the Cuzco Pet,
whilst Messrs. Dennison and Smith
officiated in that capacity for the Irish
Chicken. Messrs. Brinsmead and Denni-
son tossed for corners, the toss being won
by the Irishman. Mr. Dennison art-
fully took up his position with his back
to the sun, leaving the pets eyes
exposed to the rays of the setting
luminary. Then commenced the un-
packing of restoratives, and the number
of sponges, bottles of water, salts,
brandy, &c., which appeared on the
scene in the course of one minute, did
great credit to the seconds’ backers.
Mr. Pilley officiated as time-keeper.
Mr. Brismead then enquired of Mr.
Dennison, “are you ready,” and received
a reply in the affirmative. Amidst
breathless excitement time was called,
Bound 1. —Both walked slowly to the
centre, not smiling as is usual in ordinary
prize fights, where the better man wins,
the other merely getting a broken no*e,
smashed face, &c., and then when fully
blinded has the sponge thrown up by his
seconds ; but both pale, deadly pale, as
though each knew one of them had to
die, and had fully made his mind up that
one was himself. They faced each other,
both fists trembling, and knees shaking
with subdued emotions, and amidst the
greatest enthusiasm the first hit was
made by the Pet at the Chicken. Had
the Chicken been about three feet nearer
he might have been hit. The Chicken’s
Irish blood appeared now to be fully
roused, and he turned his back, and
under the impression he had another
adversary in the other direction gave
chase to same, meanwhile completely
covering his face with both arms. Great
consternation now occurred amongst the
by-standers. Some saying he had been
struck with lightening, whilst others
asserted he had been too much in the sun
during the day. However, the Pet
appeared not undaunted by this proceed-
ing, and not wishing to take advantage of
his adversary ran round the ring, giving
us a pantominic imitation of a travelling
windmill; but, unfortunately, whilst he
was doing this performance, one of his
elbows happened to touch the Irishman,
who was still demolishing his imaginary
foes prior to slaying the Pet. This so
upset the Chicken’s equilibrium that he
immediately laid down, though for what
reason no one could imagine, but came to
the conclusion it was some artful ruse.
However, he did not appear to care to
get up again, and amidst the greatest
excitement time was called, to the sur-
prise of all, as both combatants having
requested the fight to be under “ Queens-
berry ” rules, viz :—3 minutes rounds
and 1 minute interval. All spectators
were naturally annoyed that time should
be called at minutes. Strange to say,
when we went to inquire Mr. Pilley was
not to blame, as the person who actually
called time was Mr. Brinsmead, under
the bloodthirsty excuse that he wished
to prolong this encounter, and was afraid
they were going to embrace instead of
fight.
Bound 2, —Both again came up pale,


the Irish Chicken being actually livid
{with rage ?) They immediately got to
work, both striking hard blows at the
air. However, at last, one blow coming
within a foot of the Irishman’s head he
resumed his previous tactics, covered his
head with his arms, and showed us howfast
he could run round a 24-ft. ring. The Pet
here appeared to gain more colour, and
ran round after the Chicken until one of
the windmill arms coming uncomfortably
near his head, the Irishman again laid
down, and instructed his seconds to throw
up the sponge which was done in a most
able manner by Mr. Smith. The Irish-
man then gave his reason that his wind
was not quite so good as it was when he
was a young man, and since he had
arrived in the valley he had changed his
mind, and did not intend to slay his
•opponent, as he heard he had a wife and
two children. The victor now came
■forward and claimed an apology, but the
Irishman simply gave his reply, “Never,
sir.” Mr. Brinsmead, the Pet’s second,
complimented the Chicken on his de-
cision, and again prepared the Pet to re-
sume the fight, but the Irish Chicken loudly
protested, and tendered any apology that
might be required, asserting he was an
-orphan, and his sister would never
forgive him should his face get bruised.
The principals then embraced, weeping
tears of joy, went to their bags for their
brandy and other restoratives, but found
they had been most shamefully treated
by their seconds, as whilst they were
embracing, the brandy had been all
swallowed. The fight having now been
brought to a conclusion, we all returned
to the town, when we were most
sumptuously entertained by the proud
victor.
Want of space prevents our appending
the remarks of our special reporter,
which will appear in our next week’s
issue.
A Run Ashore.
It is almost needless, I presume, to say
that this run ashore took place at St.
Vincent, one of the Verde islands off
the Cape de Verde, West Coast of Africa.
I feel sure the reader has no particular
desire to know the exact latitude and
longitude of this island, so 1 will not
trouble him to read it, or myself to find
it out. Most gentlemen on board made
up their minds to go ashore the evening
we arrived (Saturday, 5.10 p.m.), and
accordingly carried out their resolution.
I, like the rest of my fellow-passengers,
was as eager to put my foot on terrafirma
as if I had been at sea for three months
instead of eight days.
Having reached the little town, if
such it may be called, I walked up what
I presume is the principal street, at the
top of which stands the house of the
Prefect of the police. Turning to the
left, I climbed up one of the neighbouring
hills, although it was very] warm. It
was not for the sunset I took all the
trouble, but to get a good view of the
town and bay. The stones scattered
about the soft red soil facilitated my
march in a great measure. I soon found
it would not take long to see the whole
town, so I descended and had something
to eat, and then strolled about. How-
ever, darkness soon came, and prevented
my seeing very much. I learnt that
dancing generally took place after dark.
Having ascertained where I should find
the festivities, I proceeded towards them
in “ Paradise-street.” These dancing
saloons are indeed meagre : they consist
of a small room that has two doors, the
one leads into the street, the other into a
“ drinking shop this is invariably the
rule. The only “ladies” to be met there,
as well as in the town, generally are
dark-skinned. If you wish to join in,
it is with these beauties you must dance.
Nice, eh? Of the houses nothing more
can be said than that they consist of
four walls and a sloping roof, minus
chimney. In some of these hovels there
are no doors, and generally one window.
There is only one room, which does for
the whole family, in which they sleep,
cook, and eat. It would be wrong of
me not to state that there are quite eight
respectable houses, of which nothing
but good can be said, since they show
that improvement is not only contem-
plated, but also executed. There are, I
believe, eighty Britishers, but I have
no idea how many natives. These
natives, I might mention, are not
quite negroes, but half Portuguese
and half negro. It is hardly neces-
sary to say that they do not wear
either grand or superfluous clothing. It
is somewhat amusing to see the little
boys strut about the streets without a
single garment on them, but not so
amusing when a whole troop of them
follow you about asking for money.
You can never give them enough.
It is very nice for us to have a run
ashore for a day, but I doubt very much
whether there are any on board who
would like to spend five years there.
On looking at St. Vincent one won-
ders where the bananas, lemons, and
other fruits that the natives sell,
come from, certainly not from that deso-
late, unfertile soil. No, they are grown
on an island called Saint Antonio, about
sixty miles distant. I learn that butter
and milk (except goat’s) are almost un-
known there. A nice thing indeed for
the Blue Ribbon army. Ah ! by-the-


bye, what a wonderful institution that is.
It is becoming quite the thing on board.
But pray may I ask what the red means ?
Is it a mark to distinguish those that
drink everything but water. But lam
wandering from my subject. There but
remains for me to add that all readers
will look with kind, and not too severely
criticizing eyes on this my first attempt
at journalising. Maori.
A Colonial’s Farewell on Leaving
Plymouth.
Farewell, farewell, Old England,
From thee I must depart,
For Sunny New South Wales
Is dearest to my heart.
It is my native place,
Old England was my sire’s,
And of the two I cannot tell
Which I should most admire,
You’re a great and wealthy nation,
With our good Queen on the throne.
Be proud all English people
Of your home, sweet home.
IDUNA.
Outward Bound.
“ Outward Bound,” two oft-used words.
Yet what a world of meaning
May lie beneath the surface
Of a phrase with little seeming,
What thoughts arise within the heart,
And dim the eye with tears,
When forced from loving friends to part
Mayhap for many years.
Think of the piercing grief which fills
A mother’s heart so brave.
On hearing that some darling son
Was lost beneath the wave.
Or yet again her daughters fair,
In many distant lands,
Lie buried in far Southern climes
By none but stranger’s hands.
But turning from such thoughts as these,
Which fill the heart with sadness,
We gaze upon the brighter side,
While feeling nought but gladness.
And trust some day returning
To the dear old land at home,
From that haven of contentment
No more we’ll wish to roam.
W. H. HINTON.
Our'Second Nap.
In was a merry company, and they were
just afloat
In the gallant steamship Cuzco, a strong
seaworthy boat,
And as they swiftly sped along across the
placid sea,
No thought of mal-de-mer disturbed that
merry company.
And the full moon shone in beauty, gilding
the seething tide
And smiling on the ladies fair with their
lovers at their side.
Those moonlight hours, those happy hours
their memory haunts my mind.
For the evenings they were beautiful, th©
ladies they were kind,
There is fair Miss L., how shall I tell, her
sweetness so ecstatic,
For if I spoke but half I think, you’d say
I’m too emphatic.
Observe with what a winning smile she
mounts the cabin stair,
Where juvenile Adonis, waits brimful of
loving care;
Then there’s Miss P., now let me see, I
must not speak too fast,
For I know that on her merry face, fond
loving looks are cast.
Oh! sweet Miss P., just list to me, and
don’t make choice too quick,
’Mongst your lengthy train of followers,,
take time and take your pick.
For be you sure delay will cure a love that
only slips,
The love’s untrue they tell to you, if lost
when out of sight;
And there’s another lady, methinks I hear
her sigh,
For though we swiftly speed along, her
wishes swifter fly,
Her lover waits to welcome her, and claim
her for his bride ;
And she longing, Oh! how earnestly once
more to reach his side.
There re-united ne’er to part, may they
trust on through life,
He a proud contented husband, she a
happy loving wife;
And may God’s blessing rest on them in all
their future years,
Their comfort in their times of peace and
solace in their tears.
A word now on the sterner sex, —well
they’re a jolly lot,
To call them any other name would be but
simple rot;
But by your leave I’ll longer wait, until I
know them better,
When perhaps, I may describe them too, in
another little letter.

Some ’because Doctor says its right,
And some without a question.
Some drink when they a bargain make,
And some because of loss ;
-Some drink when they their pleasures take,
And others when they’re cross.
Some drink for sake of company,
While others drink on the sly;
And many drink but never think,
About the reason why.

Personal Allusions.
In the second saloon what colours abound ?
And also state what trades are found P
To whom will we fly in a storm to save ?
And who will supply when our appetite
crave ?
What lady will gladly give us a drive ?
At what ancient edifice will we arrive P
What two passengers reply “ Amen ?”
At St. Vincent what took we in then?
The birds that accompany us now name,
And one of our clergy will chase the same,
Who’s bound to a peer by a very close tie,
And who’ll guess these names in the

Cricket Match. —A cricket match
was played on August Ist, between the
Ist and 2nd saloons. This match was
won by the Ist saloon easily, by seven
wickets and four runs. The victory was
solely attributable to the batting of W.
Johnson, who played in very good form,
as did also Pearson for the 2nd saloon.
A gloom was cast over the proceedings
by an accident to Mr, Hipwood, but we
are happy to be able to say, that he is
now convalescent.
The 'Cuzco' Times.
AUGUST 17, 1882.
In placing the second issue of the
<7 uzco Times before our readers, we must
tender our sincere thanks for the kind
reception accorded to our first edition.
Some dissatisfaction was, we believe,
■caused by a few slightly personal allusions
contained therein; but as nearly all the
communications received were of a per-
sonal nature, we were obliged either to
insert them, or else throw up the editor-
ship. A number of people were kind
enough to point out the various mistakes
we had made, and to explain to us what
we ought to have done. Now, good
advice is very well in its way, but in the
present instance a little less advice and a
little more assistance would be beneficial.
Cuzco Hoodlums.
It is our painful duty to state that on
Monday night considerable annoyance
was caused by the playful antics of a
party of Bacchanalians, who, perhaps,
under the impression that they were
■rehearsing for a Christy Minstrel Show in
Bedlam, amused themselves by throwing
light articles of furniture at the recum-
bent figure of an unsuspecting and inof-
fensive foreigner, who was sleeping on
the main hatch. The performance ended
in all proceeding below, and emptying the
contents of the water jugs on the sleep-
ing inmates of their respective cabins.
Seriously speaking, the line should be
drawn somewhere. Throwing deck chairs
at a foreigner may be legitimate amuse-
ment, but to annoy a member of our staff
(our head compositor, in fact), is too
harrowing an outrage on decency to pass
unnoticed. Let us hope the offence will
not be repeated.
We were surprised on Saturday even-
ing to see a large Cape hen alight on
the fore-royal truck. The bird was suc-
cessfully captured and brought on deck
by one of the seamen, who subsequently
sold it to a second saloon passenger.
A series of dissolving views were
kindly exhibited by Mr. Brown last
Thursday evening in the second saloon.
The subjects comprised several incidents
in connection with the birth and subse-
quent history of Our Saviour, which were
ably explained by Mr. Hunt, and also
various views of London, of which Mr.
Coull gave a very interesting descrip-
tion. Two songs, “My Queen’’and the
“ Death of Nelson,’’ were well sung by
Messrs. Lenahan and Patterson respec-
tively, the accompaniments to which,
together with several selections, were
admirably executed by Mr. C. Foss. The
proceedings terminated with “ God Save
the Queen.” to be hoped that all


our future entertainments will pass off
as successfully as did this. The views
were excellent, and no hitch whatever
occurred during the evening. It only
remains for us to endorse the vote of
thanks given to Mr. Brown for his kind-
ness in furnishing the materials, and to
Messrs. Hunt and Coull for their able
explanation of the subjects.
Divine Services were conducted on
Sunday last in the first (morning) and
second saloon (evening) by the Revs. W.
Hunt and J. K. Hutchin. The attendance
at both services was good. The singing
in the morning was excellent, but in the
evening wretchedly feeble.
A gloom was cast over the ship yester-
day by the announcement of a death
of a steerage passenger named Harvey.
The deceased was a native of Inverurie,
Aberdeenshire, and a tailor by trade.
He leaves a wife and one child to mourn
their loss. His body was committed to
the deep at 11 a.m., the funeral service
being read by Captain Ridler. Deceased
was going to Melbourne.
Owing to the inclemency of the weather
the Athletic Sports have been postponed
indefinitely. We also have to announce
that the Christy Minstrels cannot, for
obvious reasons, take place till next
week.
A few remarks by our Special Sporting:
Reporter on the recent Pugilistic
Encounter at St- Vincent.
The satisfaction of having this affair of
honor brought to a conclusion without
the loss of blood, or even the receipt of a
bruise by either combatant, was com-
pletely annulled by the disgust which all
Englishmen feel when they see the noble
art of self-defence brought into ridicule,
and certainly never was this more fully
done than in the fight recently reported.
From start to finish, nothing but fear
and the lack of even the rudiments of
boxing was evinced by both parties,
the Chicken showing the most arrant
cowardice, and before even a hit was
made, turning his back and running. In
fact, from the time he first came to the
centre of the ring, until his sponge was
thrown up in disgust by Mr. Smith, his
face was covered with his arms, except
at such times as he laid down. Again
the Pet’s over-anxiety to get the affair
settled at any price was nearly as repre-
hensible as the Chicken’s conduct, so
anxious was he that his seconds might as
well have been talking to a group of
natives who were looking silently on at
this farce, and no doubt thinking what
cowards the British people are after all,
and what a stupid way of settling »
difference. The noble art of self-defence
is purely an English way of settling
disputes. By its means the adoption of
knife and revolver in disputes is happily
hardly ever resorted to in England. We
sincerely trust it may never be our lot to
again see the noble art so shamefully
insulted, and also hope that unless in
future years the Chicken and Pet may
have obtained a little courage they will
never dare ask gentlemen to assist them
in making so disgraceful a scene as that
witnessed on Saturday at St. Vincent.
Spelling Bee. —On Tuesday morning
some amusement was created by holding
a Spelling Bee amongst the second-class
passengers. Mr. C. Foss was the fortu-
nate winner, Mr. Dare being second.
These gentlemen made it quite hard work
for the Eev. W. Hunt (who gave out the
words) to find material difficult enough
to puzzle them.
Concert. —On Friday last a notice was
posted up inviting all to a concert, to be
given by the passengers of the first-class.
For this purpose on the port-side of the
quarter-deck a recess was tastefully
arranged with flags across the entrance
of this impromptu stage; a flag was
drawn substituting a drop curtain. The
star-board side was kept apart as a
promenade. Not at all a bad idea. A fr-
eight o’clock the programme began with
a solo on the piano. This was followed
by Mr. Brown Douglas’ song of the
“ Three Fishers.” This was not so well
sung as his later ones. Miss Russell’s
“ Children’s Home ” was scarcely audible
at first, but towards the end it was much
improved. ‘‘The Warrior Bold ” was
very well rendered by Mr. Tom Smithy
and “Ehren on the Rhine,” sung by Mrs.
Thompson, well merited the applause it
received. Of the quartette, “ Sweet and
Low,” we can say but little. Far better
was Mr. Brown Douglas’ recitation,..
“Edinboro’ after Flodden.” “The
Chorister,” sung by Miss Patton, was
rather weak. “In the Gloaming” was
made hideous by Mr. L. Sinclair’s parody
on it. Miss A. Johnson sang “ Heaven
and Earth ” beautifully, with great taste
and feeling. It was well appreciated by
the audience, who would not be content
till they obtained an encore. Had Mr.
Gibbs sang “ London Bridge” louder, it
would have been better. Mrs. Thomp-
son’s second song “ Over the Hills and
Far Away,” was not so good as her first.
“ The Bird in Hand, etc.,” better known
perhaps as “ The Three Old Maids of
Lea ” was fairly rendered by Miss Ware.
Mr. Gladstone’s, no, we should say, Mr.
Dennison's sermon was very well de-


livered, and amusing. Mrs. Hutchin’s
“Summer Showers” were indeed re-
freshing, being very prettily sung, and
obtained the second and last encore of
the evening. Mr. Pilley, senr., in a few
well chosen words, proposed a vote of
thanks to Captain Ridler for his presence,
and to the chairman (the purser Mr.
Helby) for his services. This, followed
by “Auld Lang Syne” sung by a
quartette, brought a close to a very
pleasant evening. Some amusement was
now afforded by the presentation of a
bouquet of vegetables by Mr. Dennison,
to Mr. L. Sinclair, who gracefully
acknowledged the same. One gentleman
who ought to have been thanked for all
his trouble was forgotten—Mr. Lee, the
first officer. We now venture to thank
him for his services in connection with
the arrangements.
“ What have you been doing all this
time ?” said a lady to her husband,
whom she had sent to the cabin for a
fan. “Catching cockroaches, my dear.”
“ Catching cockroaches ! How many
have you caught ?” * * When I get the
one I am now after, and two more, it will
make three.”
What kind of gambling does thes.s.
Cuzco indulge in ? Playing at pitch and
toss.
The Boatswain’s Songr.
Cheerily, boys, while breezes blow,
Brace the yards back so taut, O, ho—
See how she travels, despite the breeze,
Breasting the billows with grace and ease :
While the boatswain’s whistle sounds
sharp and shrill,
And each man strives his post to fill.
When a sudden gale bears down on the
ship,
There stands the bosun with whistle on lip,
Ready his orders forth to sound
To the willing salts who cluster round.
While the boatswain’s whistle, &c.
In port, when tempests no more are heard ;
But the good boat rides with sail all furled,
The bosun and Jack ashore will be
And drink to the health of the girl they see.
While the boatswain’s whistle, &c.
So on through life brave men will go,
And never meet trouble with head bent
low;
But come to the front with real good will,
Remembering the boatswain’s whistle still.
While the boatswain’s whistle, &c.

Be Careful What you Say.
In speaking of a fellow’s faults,
Pray don’t forget your own,
Remember those with homes of glass
Should seldom throw a stone.
If you have nothing else to do
But talk of those who sin,
’Tis better to commence at home,
And from that point begin.
We have no right to judge a man
Until he’s fairly tried ;
Should we not like his company,
We know the world is wide.
Some may have faults, and who has not ?
The old, as well as young,
Perhaps we may, for aught we know,
Have fifty to their one.
I’ll tell you of a better plan,
And find it works quite well,
To try my own defects to cure,
Ere I of others tell.
And though I sometimes hope to be
No worse than some I know,
My own shortcomings bid me let
The faults of others go.
Then let us all ere we commence
To slander friend or foe.
Think of the harm one word may do
To those we little know.
Remember, curses sometimes like
Our chickens, “ roost at home,”
Don’t speak of other’s faults until
We have none of our own.
Why is the Cuzco Times devoid of
interest? Ans : Because it is devoid of
principle. (Editorial statement).
SAGITTA.
Changed Times.
It was a merry party, and as day succeeded
day,
Everyone was happy, and everyone was
gay.
For the days were calm and beautiful, the
evenings were so clear,
And all was joy and happiness, there was
no room for fear.
But, alas ! the weather changed with the
changing of the moon,
And those hours of joy and happiness were
over far too soon.
For with a strong head wind, and a rolling,
chopping sea,
Came a finish to the merriment and an end
to all the glee.
No more was seen upon the deck the quiet
game of chess,
Or the sweet little flirtations carried on
by—can you guess P

Instead were votive offerings to the God
who rules the main,
And those offerings were repeated again,
and yet again.
Instead of fun and chaffing, and the shouts
of merry laughter,
Were enquiries as to “How you are?”
and “ Do you feel better after P ”
The horrid sea, the treacherous sea, I hate
the very sound,
I’ll never dare its might again once I reach
the solid ground.
Well, I like to give my meed of praise
wherever praise is due,
And I think our sick are very brave, kind
reader, what say you ?
They don’t kick up a horrid fuss, but quiet,
patient, meek,
Their downcast eyes and patient sighs our
sympathies bespeak.
Then let us each, and all who can, help and
assistance lend,
By acting thus we may, we must, make
many a lifelong friend.
ANON.
The Cuzco.
The s.s. Cuzco (pronounced Coosco)
so named after a burning mountain in
South America, was originally the pro-
perty of the Pacific Steam Navigation
Company. She was bought by the Orient
Steam Navigation Company in 1879, and
since that time has been engaged in her
present trade, i.e., carrying passengers
and cargo between England and Australia.
The Cuzco is 384 feet long with 42 feet
beam, and her registered tonnage is
2439 tons, but she is capable of carrying
about 4000 tons of cargo and coals. She
is barque rigged, and said to be a capital
sea boat. Her sailing capabilities were
amply tested in 1878, when, her shaft
being broken 1700 miles from land the
whole distance was safely and speedily
accomplished under sail. All told, her
crew number 128 hands, under the com-
mand of Captain Ridler, who is assisted
by Mr. Lee, chief officer, Mr. Anderson,
Mr. Brady and Mr. Leslie second, third,
and fourth officers respectively. The
purser, Mr. Helby, is making his first
trip on the vessel. As an officer, he
seems likely to gain the esteem and
respect of both passengers and crew.
The engines which are 500 h.p., nominal,
3000 effective, are under the management
of Mr. D. Williamson, chief engineer,
who is assisted by a very efficient staff.
Mr. Cunningham has entire control of
the victualling department, and fulfils
the duties attached to his somewhat
difficult position to the satisfaction of all.
This voyage the ship is conveying to
Cape Town, Melbourne, and Sydney, the
following passengers :
We publish the above remarks think-
ing they may interest some of our fellow
passengers.
On Monday last considerable amuse-
ment was caused by the misfortunes of
two first saloon passengers, who, seized
with a sudden and unaccountable desire
to be nearer Cape Town than anyone
else, impudently ventured for’ard ; where
they were rewarded for their temerity
by a thorough sousing. It is perhaps
unnecessary to state that the names
of both commence with H.
The 'Cuzco' Times.
AUGUST 24, 1882.
Since our last issue, we have had the
very doubtful pleasure of viewing from
afar the haunts of men. In other words
we have been in Cape Town, and in
Quarantine. Well ! We are now on the
last stage of our journey, and shall, if all
goes well, be amongst the gum trees in
another three weeks Our voyage, so
far, has been pleasant, but during the
last few days there have been clouds on
the social horizon. Let us earnestly
entreat our readers to heed the old
adage, “bear and forbear.” Different
people have different ways of thinking
and acting, and on board ship it is
especially advisable to avoid quarrelling.
A protest was drawn up at Cape Town,
and signed by nearly all in the second
saloon, against receiving passengers, that
being an infected port. Captain Ridler
expressed his satisfaction at such a
measure having been taken.
On Sunday last services were held in
the first and second saloons. That in
first saloon was conducted by Mr, Dixon.


Mr. Castlehow officiating in the second.
Mr. Dixon’s text was taken from the
Gospel of Luke, xiv chapter, 18th verse :
“ And they all began with one consent
to make excuses.” And he preached a
really eloquent sermon therefrom, which
was attentively listened to, and thoroughly
appreciated by his large congregation.
A meeting was held on the fore-deck in
the afternoon by an individual with
whose name we are not acquainted, but
whose object was evidently to bring
Divine service into contempt.
On Saturday evening last, Mr. Brown
kindly favoured us with a second exhi-
bition of dissolving views, illustrative of
John Bunyan’s “Pilgrim’s Progress,”
and also a number of comic slides. Two
songs, “I Seek for Thee in Every
Flower,” and “ ’Tis a Charming Girl I
Love,” sung respectively by Messrs.
Pearson and Lenehan, were well deserving
of the applause with which they were
received. Mr. C. Foss, as usual, played
the accompaniments, while Mr. Hunt
explained the views.
A Social Gathering was held in the
second saloon last Wednesday night.
Mr. Sinclair officiated as chairman.
Several good songs were sung by various
members of the company. Notably,
Mr. Cunningham, who gave “ The Men
of Merry England,” and “Marching to
Georgia.” Mr. Pearson, “Let Me Like
a Soldier Fall,” and “The Glorious
Vintage of Champagne.” Mr. Lenehan,
“Quid Ireland, You’re My Darling.”
“Tim Finnigan’s Wake,” and “Going
Down the Hill ” were well rendered by
Messrs. D. H. and T. Paterson respec-
tively. Herr Hirzfeld who, by-the-bye,
has a first-rate alto voice, gained great
applause ,by his excellent rendering of
“Abschied.” Among the ladies, Miss
Dewhurst’s song, “ Still let me sing to
thee,” and Miss Willing’s “Little Snow-
drop,” elicited a considerable amount of
applause, as likewise did Miss Lowe’s
song. A reading, by Mr, Langley, and a
recitation by Mr. Brown, were also well
appreciated. Miss Parker and Mrs.
Ladd, and Mr. Foss, each played a piano-
forte solo in excellent style. Spiritous
refreshment being plentiful, one or two
gentlemen, as might have been expected,
had a “ wee drap ” too much. No dis-
turbance or annoyance was caused worth
speaking of.
A smoking room is urgently required
for the second saloon ladies, as the
weather is getting too cold and windy
for them to inhale the fragrant fumes of
the weed “ narcotic ” on deck. We
would also suggest that a private bar be
established for their benefit, as the male
portion of the community are under
existing conditions generally crowded
out.
However interesting it may be to
watch a lady at her toilet operations, we
would respectfully suggest that the
dinner-table is hardly the place for
combing one’s hair.
Cape Town, August 21, 1882.
For some time before we reached Cape
Town doubts had been entertained as to
our being able to land on account of the
prevalence of small-pox. These doubts,
to the very great disappointment of all,
proved to be but too well founded. Hard
indeed it was on those who had looked
forward to meeting friends, and who had
gaily decked themselves in their Sunday
best. To those whom the Egyptian war
prevented going via Suez Canal to
Australia, it has been a great disappoint'
ment to have had only one run ashore,
and that on the desert island of St.
Vincent. Yet it must be admitted that
being in close proximity to land, able to
see houses, green grass, the familiar puff
of the railway engine, and other land
marks of civilization, tends in a great
measure to alleviate the monotony of a
long sea voyage. The greater part of the
day was spent in fishing, crayfish being
the only fish caught, with the exception
of one or two very small sharks. In the
afternoon the doctor and some of the
passengers of the Garonne, an Orient
boat, homeward bound from Sydney, and
here for the same purpose as ourselves
(coaling), paid us a visit. There was a
rumour of a “tug of war” taking place
between the passengers of the two
steamers, but it fell through. Some are
now about to enter upon the last stage of
their journey, others have still farther to
go. To all we extend our wishes of a
pleasant voyage, and sincerely hope no
more mal-de-mer will occur.
Cuzco Police Court.
Presiding Magistrates : W. Sinclair, H.
B, Wilson, W. B. Gadd, Esqs. Counsel
for the Prosecution : W. A. Dare.
Defence : W. H. Hilton. Clerk of
Court : R. Browne. Crier : D. W.
Paterson.
LANGLEY V. SCOTT.
The counsel for the prosecution in
opening the case, briefly stated the
ground of action as follows: On the
night in question (Tuesday, Aug. 15), bis
client, Mr. Langley, retired to rest at his
usual time, about eleven o’clock. He
soon fell asleep, but was rudely and un-
ceremoniously awakened about 1 a.m.
by some one grasping his throat, and


apparently attempting to choke him. In
fact, only motives of clemency to the
prisoner, Scott, had induced them to
prosecute upon the lesser charge of being
drunk and disorderly, because, judging
from the prisoner’s actions, it seemed to
have been his intention to murder the
prosecutor while asleep, Mr. Langley
thereupon struck out at the prisoner, who
retired precipitately from the room, and
rising soon afterwards on account of the
noise going on outside, he saw the
prisoner in the passage in an advanced
state of intoxication. He (the counsel for
prosecution) had stated the case briefly
and clearly to their worships, and was
now prepared to prove these statements
by the evidence of reliable and trust-
worthy witnesses.
Mr. Langley, being sworn, said : I
remember the night of Tuesday, the
15th inst. I went to bed as usual, and
about 1 a. m. the following morning I was
awakened by a hand grasping my throat,
apparently with the intention of choking
me. I identify the prisoner, Scott, as the
person who assaulted me.
Cross-examined : Scott was in his
night-shirt. He was drunk. Knew
prisoner was drunk by his conduct, and
because he smelt drink on him. He
(Mr. Langley) was perfectly sober, and
had had no drink that night.
Thomas Maynard deposed : My berth
is No. 63, in the same room as prisoner.
I remember the night of Tuesday, Aug. 15.
I turned in that night at 10.30. None of
the others were in bed at that time. I
was awakened by a boot, thrown by the
prisoner. This was followed by a jug
of water being emptied over me ; I then
sprung out and followed prisoner out-
side ; am sure it was prisoner who
emptied water over me, because I saw
him distinctly by the light in the saloon.
Cross-examined : Turned in at 10.30 ;
was not near the bar on the night in
question.
W. Murray being sworn, deposed : I
know the prisoner Scott ; saw him on
Tuesday night last on deck, at 10.30, and
afterwards at 11 o’clock ; prisoner was
perfectly sober that night.
Cross-examined : Scott was perfectly
sober when he saw him, but was, per-
haps sea-sick ; he saw Mr. Langley that
night, and thought him pretty well on.
C. F. Delves remembered helping Mr.
Jones to empty a poeket flask of whisky ;
think it could not have been later than
II o’clock on Wednesday night; would
not be quite positive, but believed it was
Wednesday.
W. Coull was then asked to state what
he saw of the affair, and said : He
remembered on the night in question
coming up the alley which leads from the
Elysian fields where he dwells into the
saloon ; he then saw Mr. Maynard in his
night-shirt, and flapping the sleeve of the
same, which was wet; he spoke to him,
and was told that Scott poured water
over him while asleep ; later on he saw
Scott at the bread locker, where he
seemed to be holding a conversation with
an invisible friend; considers it likely
from his conversation that this friend
must have been the devil, as his words
were something as follows : —“ Why the
devil don’t it lock ?” “ What the devil’s
the matter with the, deor ?” Witness
could not exactly say Scott was drunk,
but he was decidedly unsteady in his
movements.
Cross-examined : Mr. Maynard was
flapping his night-shirt; it was wet;
Scott was also in his night-shirt.
W. Talbot said : I am the bar-keeper ;
there is no evening since the ship left
Plymouth on which Mr. Murray has not
had drink at the bar ; he did not know
Mr. Maynard or Mr. Coull as customers ;
he had often served Scott.
Cross-examined ; Mr, Langley drinks
only lemonade.
Herr Hierfield (who spoke through an
interpreter) deposed: Ido not speak
English ; was in my cabin on the night
of Tuesday, August 15 ; Scott and Pater-
son assaulted him with a boot and water;
he did not think prisoner was drunk, but
thought him slightly drunk.
For the defence, Mr. Hilton called
J, Patterson being sworn, said: I
recollect the night of August 15th ; saw
Scott on that night at 8.30 ; Scott was
sea-sick ; Faulkner, Delves, and myself
took him to his berth and remained with
him from 8.30 to 4 a.m. ; Faulkner pro-
cured some brandy and soda from the
bar ; he gave Scott the soda to drink and
rubbed his feet with the brandy.
Cross-examined : I never left Scott
from the time we put him to bed at
8.30 p.m. till 4 o’clock next morning ; he
had nothing to drink himself, but
remained with Scott, owing to the latter
being sea-sick.
C. Delves was recalled, but his evidence
was not admitted, he having been in
court.
F. Falkner deposed : I recollect the
evening of August 15th; saw prisoner
that night at 8.15; prisoner was sea-sick ;
at Mr. Patterson’s request went for
brandy and water; we rubbed the brandy
on his feet and gave him some to drink.
Cross-examined : Had not been drink-
ing that night, being a teetotaller ; had
had some rum ; considered rum a teetotal
drink.
This concluded the evidence, and the
counsel for the prosecution addressed the
bench, showing that every statement


made in the charge had been fully proven
by the evidence given. Witnesses had
all given their evidence in a straight-
forward and trustworthy manner, and
being men of indubitable sobriety and
intelligence, it was quite unnecessary to
say anything further in the matter. He
would simply leave the matter in their
Worships’ hands, in the full conviction
that they would find a verdict for the
plaintiff.
Mr. Hilton next addressed the Bench
as follows ; Your Worships,—ln leaving
this case in your hands, I have every
confidence that you will see at once that
this is a case of mistaken identity. The
prisoner was, on the evening in question,
suffering from sea-sickness. On account
of this his friends put him to bed at 8.30,
from which time till 4 next morning
he was watched by Mr. Patterson,
whose evidence was before them, to the
effect that he had not quitted his bed
between those hours. He had also found a
somewhat similar case, tried before His
Honor Judge Macauley in London, on
March 15, 1881, wherein it was held
by His Honor that identity could not
be proved at night, unless the person
recognised came within seven feet of an
electric light.
Counsel for prosecution : Your worship,
the learned counsel for the defence gives
a decision of date 1871. whereas the
electric light was not in use until some
years later.
Mr. Hilton: I find I have made a
mistake in my date, it should have been
1881. Mr. Dare here called the attention
of their Worships to the fact, that the
book from which his learned friend
quoted was printed in 1867, and there-
fore could not contain a case tried in
1881,
Their Worships after a short conference
found prisoner guilty, but there having
been no former conviction against him
treated the case leniently and merely
mulcted him in one bottle of square gin
and one bottle of whisky.
Athletic Sports.
After having been postponed twice on
account of rough weather, the first day’s
competition for the Cuzco champion
medals was brought to a most satisfactory
conclusion on Friday last. Everybody
appeared to have thoroughly enjoyed the
sports, which showed our little band to
have been far above the average in
possessing some really good athletes.
The various events were very hotly con-
tested, and we confidently expect some
very exciting work at the final heats,
which will take place ou Saturday next,
weather and captain permitting. Every
competitor came to the post with the
exception of Mr. Dixon, who scratched
for the boxing match, leaving Messrs.
Lenehan and Clarke to compete. Mr.
Lenehan showed himself very nimble in
the first round, but was completely over-
powered by his heavy adversary in the
second. The competition was very one-
sided, Mr. Clarke the winner, being a
heavy weight of unusually athletic build,
whilst Mr. Lenehan is a feather weight.
The latter, however, fought gamely
throughout, and fully deserved for his
pluck the applause he received. The
winner, afterwards sparred with Mr. H.
Brinsmead, and proved himself an un-
doubtedly good man, although there is
considerable room for improvement in his
boxing. He gave Mr. Brinsmead great
difficulty to keep the spar light owing
to his repeated rushes. We hope he
will continue this sport, as with more
science, he „will make a boxer any
athletic society might be proud of. The
sack, three-legged, and obstacle races
caused great amusement, and a few
bruises, but the running and standing
jumps, as well as the hop skip and a
jump had to be indefinitely postponed
owing to the motion of the ship, the
danger being forcibly demonstrated by
Mr. Mackley, who in his first jump, came
flat down on the back of his head and
was stunned. Restoratives were ad-
ministered, and after some little time
recovered. Mr. Pilley officiated as judge,
Mr. Brinsmead as referee, and Mr.
Langley made a most energetic clerk of
the course. Appended are the results :
Wheelbarrow Race. —First heat, Mit-
chell and Delves ; 2nd, Short and Gibbs.
Boxing—Clarke beat Leneham, and
won the medal.
Chalking the Line.—Moncur, 6ft. Sin. ;
2nd, Scott, 6ft. Sin.
Obstacle Race.—Won by Short in 21
seconds.
Bowling at Stump. —Won by W.
Dare, who hit three times out of six.
Cock Fight.—Gibbs, Smith, Paterson,
and Nathan, won their heats.
Three-legged Race.—Pearson and Short,
and Paterson and Faulkner won their
respective heats.
Spoon and Potato Race.—Winners of
heats, Short, Mason, Mitchell, and
Wilson.
Sack Race.—Winners of heats, F.
Faulkner, Short, G. Faulkner, and Scott.
Hopping Race. —Winners of heats,
Lenehan, Pearson, Dare, and Wilson.
Potato Race. —Winners of heats, Pater-
son, Coull, Delves, Gibbs, and Short.
Tug of War.—Second saloon passengers
beat those of the first saloon, scoring two
tugs out of three.


Innoculating Contest.— The first heat
of this somewhat novel competition com-
menced on Wednesday 23rd instant, at
11 a.m. Of those entered, three only came
to the post, viz :—Miss Patton, Master
Spiller, and Mr. Helby, our indefatigable
purser. Mr. Helby was the first to get
away, but was quickly joined by Miss
Patton. However, both were shortly
overtaken and passed by Master Spiller,
who at the time of going to press was
well ahead and fully established as first
favourite. Betting on quarter deck,
Thursday, 12 o’clock : 2 to 1 on Master
Spiller, 6 to 4 against Miss Patton, 1000
to 3 against Mr. Helby.
Billiards. —A match has been arranged
for £5 a-side, 500 up, between an official
and one of our passengers whose name
figured most prominently in the sport-
ing columns of our two last issues.
Our fellow passenger should win,
if his claim to average breaks of
100 should prove correct, but from his
blowing before the only athletic display
he has given, and the poor show made
when same came off, great doubt is
thrown upon the veracity of his state-
ments. Mr. H. Brinsmead is to act as
referee, Mr. T. Smith as stakeholder, and
Mr. B. Denison as marker.
The Tale of a Pin.
Only a pin, yet it calmly lay
On the cabin floor in the light of day,
And it shone serenely, fair, and bright,
Reflecting back the noonday light.
Only a boy, yet he saw that pin,
And his face assumed a fiendish grin.
He stooped for awhile with look intent,
Till he and the pen alike were bent.
Only a chair, but upon its seat
A well bent pin found safe retreat.
Nor had the keenest eye discerned
That heavenward its point was turned.
Only a man, but he chanced to drop
Upon that chair, when, fizz, bang, pop,
He leaped like a cork from out of a bottle,
And opened wide his )alve-de4hrottle.
Only a yell, though an honest one,
It lacked the element of fun.
And buoyant man, and pin, and chair,
In wild confusion mingled there.
Conundrum. —Why is a prudent man
like a pin ? Ans ; Because his head pre-
vents him going too far.
A young stocking-maker in the North
of England, was engaged to be married
to a girl named Hannah. But before the
day appointed for the marriage he died.
On his tombstone they wrote the follow-
ing inscription :
He left his hose, his Hannah, and his love.
To sing “ Hosannah ” in the realms above
Through, the Suez Canal to Port
Said.
The following is taken from the notes
of a diary of one of our second saloon
passengers, who passed through the
Canal, when on his voyage home in the
John Elder :
May 6th, 1882, Saturday. The previous
portion being of little general interest, we
select this date as a starting point,—
Editors, —We reached Suez at 8.30 a.m.
(Saturday, May 6, 1882). Here the
stranger is at once struck with the
fact that he is in a part of the world
foreign to European manners and customs.
The head of the Gulf takes the form of a
semi-circle with the town of Suez on the
left, and the Canal opening in the centre.
Dhows manned by Arabs and tawny
Africans were soon seen approaching the
ship, and their living freight soon began to
swarm our decks, offering for sale tropical
fruits, trinkets, &c., &c. Two Maltese
traders also came on board, and did a
good business in Maltese lace, which,
they said, they alone had the privilege of
selling, having a contract with the Bishop
of Malta for the supply of the lace from
the nuns of the convent there. The
excitement on board soon became intense
as the dealers spread out their wares and
commenced trading. In the meantime I
took a view of the surrounding scenery.
The canal authorities have provided
some good docks for the shipping here.
Tons and tons of coal are also heaped
up on the wharf. On the very edge
of the Canal embankment, with steps
leading to the water stands, what ap-
peared to be, a very good hotel. Suez
has the usual appearance of an oriental
town, most of the houses having flat
roofs. The minarets and cupolas of the
Mahommedan mosques also attract the
attention of a stranger, but what seemed
to me most peculiar was the aspect of
the surrounding country. Sand, sand,
everywhere. The city appears to be
built on sand. Nothing but sand, both
on the African and the Arabian side;
and as a passenger remarked, *‘ if the
country in which the Israelites lived for
forty years is typified by our present
surroundings they are hardly to be blamed
for grumbling.” There are said to be
about 1000 Europeans or Christians in
Suez. The health officers having visited
us and given us a clean bill of health,
and our Pilot having came on board, we
weighed anchor at 10 a.m., and started
for the Canal (leaving three ships in
quarantine behind), which we soon
entered. The Canal needs little descrip-
tion it being merely a cutting, averaging
about 300 feet in width through sand,
the debris having been mostly thrown up
at its sides and forming its bank. It is

apparently yet in an unfinished condition
so far as the enbankment is concerned.
Ships are not by reputation to steam
through at a speed above 4 miles an
hour, and at a distance of about every
5 miles are what are called “stations,”
at which, should a ship have started
before you have reached yours you have
to haul up, and wait till she, or, it may
be, half a dozen have passed. Two
vessels cannot steam through abreast at
one time. I may say these stations are
like little oases in the desert. A French-
man with his family appears to be located
at each, and for his accommodation he
has provided a rather pretty eastern
looking little cottage, with outhouses
roofed with ornamental red tiles, and
by his own industry and hard work
trees, bushes, and flowers are made to
spring up for some little distance around.
I may say that water for irrigating pur-
poses, all along the Canal, is brought
through cuttings from the river Nile.
These stations, with their green sur-
roundings, greatly break the monotony
of the otherwise dreary looking waste
and are very pretty and pleasant features
in the journey.

A gentleman on entering an hotel,
observed a very sickly-looking waiter,
whom he nicknamed “the valet of the
shadow of death.”
In Memorian.
Alexander Harvey, who died on board s.s.
Cuzco, August 16,1882.
Toll the bell for the loved and lost,
Whom wo place ’neath the ocean wave,
No more by the foaming billows toss’d,
Par down in his lowly grave.
In search of health, he was crossing the deep
To bright Australian skies,
But death has hushed his heart to sleep,
And still’d his anguish’d sighs.
All desolate, and lonely now,
His wife mourns o’er her dead.
Oh God, with peace her soul endow,
Let grace o’er her be shed.
What though his resting-place be far,
In the depths of the deep blue sea !
Material bounds cannot debar,
Their spirit’s unity.
No longer now through the weary night,
He waits for the break of day;
For he dwells in the eternal light,
Where earth’s shadows flee away.

Sunrise.
See, where yonder greyish tint
Is spreading o’er the eastern sky,
Gathering strength with every moment,
’Till it darts far up on high.
Rolling back with giant strides
The darksome canopy of night,
Till the heavens are filled with splendour,
And earth reflects the golden light.
Dazzling rays of sparkling beauty,
Like gems from some Aladdin’s cave,
Tip the hills with rosy sunbeams,
All things feel the gilded wave.
Thus all above, below is brightened
By the coming of the dawn ;
And the sounds of life soon stirring,
Call us to arise ; ’tis morn.

AUGUST 31, 1882.
In bringing out our fourth issue, we
have had considerable difficulty in obtain-
ing matter.—Contributions seem to have
stopped entirely. We hope our readers
will help us a little with our next issue,
as it will be our last.
During the last few days, we have
experienced some very rough weather,
though fortunately from astern. Early
on Wednesday morning, a heavy sea
carried two ventilators away on the star-
board side, and the bridge steps promenad-
ing the deck, has been almost abandoned,
except by the hardy few who seem to
court rather than shun a wetting.
“Puss in Boots.” —Some amusement
was caused yesterday by the spectacle of
a lady promenading the deck with her
pedal extremities encased in a huge pair
of sea boots, the property of an ex-
mariner in the second saloon, who
seemed to be much delighted at the
opportunity of affording the fair one such
a luxury.
We must not omit to state that Mr.
Drummond gave a very good sermon in
the first saloon last Sunday morning.
His text was taken from the sermon on
the Mount. “ Blessed are the pure in
heart, for they shall see God,”


We had last Sunday the pleasure of
listening to a very eloquent and in-
structive discourse in the second saloon.
Mr. Cox, who conducted the service,
chose for his text the 23rd verse of the
4th chapter of Proverbs, “ Keep thy
heart with all diligence, for out of it are
the issues of life.” In explaining his text
he showed that the meaning of the word
heart, as used in this sentence, means
character— not worldly reputation, which
is no criterion of real merit but the inner
consciousness of moral rectitude —a con-
sciousness, no opinion of the world either
good or bad can effect. If last Sunday’s
sermon is to be taken as an average
specimen of Mr. Cox’s preaching, he will
be a decided acquisition to Queensland.
A complaint was made last Sunday
evening by Mr. Delves, that some ruffian
had knocked the collection plate out of
his hand, thereby scattering the contents
(2s. 2£d.) on the deck. Such hoodlum
pranks merit the condemnation of every
right-thinking person. It has since tran-
spired that the perpetrator of the outrage
hails from St. Leonard’s, Sydney.
A story is told, concerning the recent
solar eclipse, worthy of space and notice.
It appears that on the morning of the
event alluded to, Captain S , of the
Fusiliers, issued the following verbal
order to his company, through his
serjeant-major, to be communicated to
the men after forenoon parade “ This
afternoon a solar eclipse will take place.
At three o’clock the whole company
will parade in the barrack-yard. Fatigue
jackets and caps. 1 shall explain the
eclipse to the men. Should it rain they
will assemble in the drill-shed.” The
sergeant-major having set down his com-
manding officer’s instructions in writing
as he had understood them, formed the
company into a hollow square at the con-
clusion of the morning drill, and read his
version to them as follows :—“ This
afternoon a solar eclipse will take place in
the barrack-yard by order of the captain,
and will be attended by the whole
company in fatigue jackets and caps. The
captain will conduct the solar eclipse in
person. Should it rain the eclipse will
take place in the drill-shed.”
The Cuzco Minstrels.
A GREAT treat was afforded to the
passengers of the Cuzco on Friday night,
when the newly organised troupe of
minstrels made their first appearance.
As it was known that the company com-
prised the pick of the talent on board,
that they had been diligently rehearsing
their parts beforehand, and that the
entertainment would be placed upon the
stage regardless of expense, while the
same low scale of charges which has
hitherto been made would be continued
during the present engagement, public
expectation rose to a pitch of excitement
altogether unprecedented. It is needless
to say these expectations were fully
realised. From the withdrawal of the
curtain to its fall the entertainment well
merited the applause which was elicited,
and as votes of thanks are being dis-
pensed with at these performances, the
present seems to us a fitting time for
rendering to this talented company the
thanks of the community in general.
Especially should Mr. Pearson’s name
be mentioned in this, as we are given to
understand the arrangements generally
were under his management. The pro-
gramme consisted of songs of the usual
Christy Minstrel description, and was
concluded with the laughable farce
entitled —“The Barber’s Shop.” The
selection of pieces was good, and the
singing throughout was little, if at all,
inferior to what we would have expected
from professionals, while the choruses
were rendered with a spirit and a pre-
cision which spoke volumes for the care
stowed on rehearsal. On the curtain
rising the company were discovered occu-
pying the usual stereotyped positions on
a miniature stage erected for the occa-
sion. Mr. Sinclair, the interlocutor, in
the centre, Mr. Pearson (bones), on the
left hand, Mr. Delves (tambo.) on the
right hand. Part 1 opened with a selec-
tion from “ Patience ” on the pianoforte
by Mr. C. Foss, the pianist of the
company. Mr. C. Foss, it is needless
to say, did full justice to this, as also
to the accompaniments which devolved
upon him during the evening. Where
all did well it would be invidious to
particularise ; but we must say that the
local song, “On the Cuzco,” the words
of which will be found in another column,
was undoubtedly the gem of the evening.
It was well sung by Mr. Pearson, and
being full of happy local hits, was
received with quite a storm of enthu-
siasm. Mr. W. Sinclair’s song —“ The
moon behind the trees ” —was excellently
rendered, the beautiful chorus which is
attached to it being given with charming
effect. Mr. Lenehan sung, “Who will
care for mother now,” and the ballad
entitled “ If,” in his usual able manner.
Mr. D. W. Patterson has never appeared
to greater advantage than in his render-
ing of “ When you and I were young,
Maggie,” the feeling which he threw
into the words giving them double effect.
“ Black-eyed Susan,” by the same gentle-
man, was well sung, but rather deficient
in clearness in some of the upper notes.
“ Johnny Morgan ” and “ Hurrah 1 for


the life of a farmer,” were given by Mr.
Delves, and well merited the applause
with which they were received. The
second division of the programme was
opened with a duet for viola and piano
by Messrs. H. and C. Foss respectively.
Messrs. Langley and Pearson then
appeared as the “ Rival Darkies,” and
sustained their parts to the satisfaction
of all. The performance concluded with
a farce, “ The Barber’s Shop.” Mr. May-
nard, who appeared as Mr. Latherum-
Shaveum by his able acting at once
stamped the piece as a success. Indeed,
few amateurs act with so much apparent
ease and facility of expression as Mr.
Maynard displayed. Mr. J. Mackley as
Jemmy, and Mr. F. Faulkner as Sammy,
performed their parts with great credit
to themselves. Mr. J. Patterson as
Customer had happily little to do. We
cannot say that that little was well
done. We do not suppose this gentleman
could look grave, therefore the part of
the ill-treated and robbed customer did
not suit him at all. God save the Queen
concluded one of the most enjoyable
evenings spent on board, and, might
we suggest, one that will well bear
repetition.
ANON.
Athletic Sports.
The finals for the Cuzco athletic
championship medals were decided on
Saturday, Aug. 26, when, owing to the
severe cold, the number of spectators
hardly came up to the last week’s meet-
ing, but the very large number of ladies
present showed the great interest evinced
in the closing competitions. Everything
passed off satisfactorily, and those who
braved the inclemency of the weather
were amply rewarded by a capital after-
noon’s sport. At the conclusion of the
contests the medals were presented to
the successful competitors by Miss
Russell and Mrs. Spiller. Both ladies
performed the duties graciously under-
taken by them most admirably. Miss
Russell favouring each recipient of
honors at her hands with a witty
little speech, whilst those who were
fortunate to have the medals pinned
by Mrs. Spiller, were additionally re-
warded by her with words of approba-
tion and an approving smile. At the
conclusion of the presentation, cheers
were respectively given for Mrs. Spiller,
Miss Russell, Mr. Pilley (the judge), Mr.
Brinsmead, Mr. Langley, and the other
gentlemen who had made and carried out
all the arrangements for the meet.

Sunset.
Where the golden orb of light,
Slowly sinks towards the west;
Clouds its rainbow tints reflecting,
Form a huge and gleaming crest.
Like some wreath of floral beauty,
Pressed from nature’s richest store,
Stretching from the highest heaven
Down to earth’s emblazoned floor.
With ethereal splendours gilded,
As glittering banners borne along
O’er some grand and mighty army,
Bursting with triumphant song.
Thus, whilst molten gleams are shedding
Lustre everywhere on high,
Evening’s sombre curtain closes,
Night soon reigns throughout the sky.
The last lines of W. H. Hilton.
A Complaint.
There’s something on my stomach, doctor,
There’s something on my breast;
The livelong day I sigh, doctor,
And at night I cannot rest.
I cannot take my rest, doctor,
Though I would fain do so,
A weary weight oppresseth me,
The weary weight of woe.
’Tis not the lack of gold, doctor,
Nor want of worldly gear!
My lands are broad and far to see,
My friends are kind and dear.
My kin are leal and true, doctor,
They mourn to see my grief,
But oh ! ’tis not a kinsman’s hand,
Can give my heart relief.
’Tis not that Jane is false, doctor,
’Tis not that she’s unkind,
Though busy flatterers swarm around,
I know her constant mind.
’Tis not her coldness, doctor,
That chills my labouring breast;
’Tis that confounded sour bread
I have eaten, and can’t digest.
DOMINO.
Accident. —We regret to state that
Mrs. Wilson, a passenger in the second
saloon, had a very severe fall on Monday
afternoon, caused by the rolling of the
vessel. Dr. Perkins was at once called,
and found she had severed an artery at
the back of her head. We are glad to
be able to report that the patient, though
very weak, is progressing favourably
towards recovery.


Through the Suez Canal to Port Said.
{Continued.)
We reached in the evening the large
Lake Belam, one of the bitter lakes. Here
we anchored for the night, and here, be-
fore turning in, I had a bath on May 7th,
Sunday. We started from the lake at
6.30, reached the second bitter lake
Timsak (on which is situated the town of
Ismailia) at 10 o’clock. Here we had to
anchor and wait for six steamers coming
through from the Port Said end.
Ismailia is a bright, leafy-looking town,
the houses mostly flat-roofed in the usual
eastern style. It is adorned by a very
handsome palace, built by the Pasha of
Egypt, and used as a summer residence ;
here too, stand the villa and outhouses
erected for the Emperor Napoleon and
Empress Eugenie when they came to
open the canal. They represent a con-
siderable amount of eastern extravagance.
The heat to-day was intense, and we
found the glare of the sand from the sun
very painful to the eyes. We started again
at 1.30 p.m. with a fresh pilot, it being
customary to change pilots at Ismailia.
We were now but little more than half
way through the canal, but the captain
obtained a special permit to push through
so as to reach Port Said before night.
As a rule every steamer has to make fast
at sunset, but, through this permit, we
were enabled to do in eight hours a
distance which had taken us twenty-four
in the previous portion of the canal,
I may state, that early in the morning we
passed two large groups of Arabs repair-
ing the embankment, also several others
leading their camels laden with goods
for the different eastern markets. The
number of steamers passing through
during the day-and-half the John Elder
was in the canal was sixteen, fourteen of
which were British. This proportion of
English ships gives one some idea of the
commercial interest which Great Britain
has in this artificial waterway. We
cleared the canal about 8.30, and reached
Port Said about 10 p.m. It was a curious
sight as we emerged from the canal, to
notice the lights of a large town,
twinkling through the darkness before us,
and also to observe eight great lights
burning a little ahead. These latter
lights proceeded from immense braziers
placed on high poles, on the several
barges which were moored ready for us,
as we were to coal here. With a great
deal of noise and shouting, we at last
reached our anchorage between four
large coal punts, each swarming with
Arabs. Such jabbering, gesticulation,
fighting, and rowing amongst them we
never heard among civilised people. Of
course, though it was now 10.30 p.m.,
many of us were anxious to put our feet in
an eastern city. We formed ourselves into
parties, and as many as could muster
sticks armed themselves therewith, as we
were advised by the officers not to go
ashore unarmed so late at night. There
were any number of boats about the
ship manned by Arabs, ready to take us
ashore for sixpence a-head, so having
made up our party, off we started.

{To he concluded in our next).
On the Cuzco.
[Composed and sung by a passenger (Mr. J.
Pearson) in the second saloon, the music
adapted by Mr. C. W. Foss.]
We sailed away from Plymouth Bay
On the twenty-ninth July,
For the land of Australia to behold
With its lovely bright, blue sky.
The weather, it was fair, my friends,
The vessel in good trim,
With a real good captain in charge of her,
And we think a lot of him.
CHOEUS.
And we all do feel so jolly on the Cuzco
all the day,
On the Cuzco all the day,
On the Cuzco all the day.
And we all do feel so jolly on the Cuzco
all the day;
Especially when the wind is fair, and we
skim the bright blue sea.
The passengers are a happy lot,
Their faces beam with smiles
To see the log when posted up,
If its over three hundred miles.
For to make a rapid passage,
Is the wish of every one ;
Although we have a pleasant time,
For we go in for lots of fun.
Chorus.
Our officers we can always trust
When on the bridge at night,
To see the good ship safely steered,
And know that all is right.
While in our berths we snugly sleep,
They keep a sharp look-out;
For to shun all danger is their aim, —
They know well what they’re about.
Chorus.
Our purser is a first-rate man,
If his services we require;
He is always ready to oblige,
And never known to tire.
To assist the passengers all he can,
In every kind of way,
I’m sure we’ve always found it so.
Which no one can gainsay.
Chorus.
Now, Cunningham, we must not forget,
To give him a real good name;
For to leave him out of this local song
Would really be a shame.
In civility—which is one good thing—
We have found he is not short,
Nor asleep when he should be awake—
He is not ever caught.
Chorus.

There is one before we close the song,
But to discard him never fear;
His name we cannot e’er forget—
’Tis Williamson, our engineer.
A clever man we know he is,
And his discipline we much admire,
For his men have such respect for him—
They will do aught he may require.
Chorus.
The bosun, too, a smart man he is,
We have often noticed him.
His eye is always up aloft
To see the vessel trim :
For, as we know, a lot depends
On how he trims the sails,
To get her ready when we meet,
As we’re sure to do, “ the Gales.”
Chorus.
The sailors ! May they have good health
To man the speedy craft,
And hoist the sails to carry us,
When the breezes they do waft;
They active are, like Britons all,
And work with might and main,
To speed the vessel on her way
To the haven we wish to gain.
Chorus.
The stewards, too, deserve our praise,
As each one of us agrees,
They do their utmost to assist,
No matter how rough the seas.
For, if with the weather we troubled are
They do their best for all,
And run to assist whenever they can,
And attend to every call.
Chorus.
If at another time, I do decide
A pleasure trip to go,
The vessel I should really like
Would be the good Cuzco ;
For if comfort is really to be found
While sailing o’er the sea,
I say again, without a doubt,
This good ship let it be.
Chorus.
At the isle of St. Vincent the other day.
The “ Irish chicken ” met,
To show his pugilistic force
Against the “ Cuzco pet
But such a farce was never known,
Yet we should not upbraid,
For as you know it did transpire,
Of each other they were afraid.
Chorus.
Of cricket, we did have a game
On board the other day,
And it did not take us long to learn
We had someone who could play;
For all who were there to see the game
Were overcome with joy,
To see the game was really won
By the smartness of a boy.
Chorus.
Conundrum.—Why do the materials
of which the Cuzco is composed resemble
a stick to beat a donkey ? Ans : Because
they make the Cuss go !
• On this day was the greatest run ever logged
by the Cuzco—thus exceeding her previous
greatest run by ten miles.
The 'Cuzco' Times.
SEPTEMBER 8, 1882.
In presenting our last issue to the public,
we beg to than* them for their kind
reception of the previous numbers, as
evinced in the vote of thanks accorded
to the editors last Monday, From a
journalistic point oi view, the Times has
not been a brilliant success ; but, we
think, our readers will acknowledge
that we have had considerable difficulty
in finding suitable matter. Had we
cribbed paragraphs from our greater
oontemporaries, our paper would have
been more readable, but we have con-
scientiously endeavoured to insert only
original matter, and if, consequently,
our poems are somewhat doggerel, and
our prose rather flat, we must beg our
readers to remember that they have only
themselves to thank. In a few days we
shall, to quote the old song, “Be dis-
persed and wandered far away.” To
those who are going to our southern land
in search of wealth, we wish success and
happiness, and we hope that those who
are returning from a visit to the old
country, may retain a pleasant recollection
of their trip. We must not omit to
thank Messrs. Foss, Nathan, and Brins-
mead for their services in connection
with the production of the paper. We
may congratulate one another upon the
pleasant voyage we have had thus far,
and confidently anticipate a speedy and
safe arrival at our various destinations.
Chess Tournament.
Chess, that game that has so many
admirers, and is, therefore, so universal,
has been greatly resorted to by both first
and second saloon passengers during the
voyage. A tournament for the champion-
ship of the Cuzco has been played by
seven of the best players. Following is
the result:—


Miss Lowe - 1 1 1 0 1 o—40 —4
Mr. B. Douglas... 0 - 0 0 0 o—o
Mr. Leslie 0 - 0 0
Mr. A. Sinclair... 0 Ixlll I—s1 —5
Mr. Thallow ... 1 1 1 0 - 0 I—41 —4
Mrs. Atherton ... 0 1 0 1 - o—2
Mr. Wilson ... 1 1 0 0 I—3
From the above it may be seen Mr.
L. Sinclair was the winner. On account
of his duties, Mr. Leslie (4th officer),
was unable to find time to complete the
contest.
(To the Editors of the Cuzco Times.)
Gentlemen, — I think before we separate,
and go our several ways at the close of
what may be looked upon as on the whole
a very pleasant voyage, that those who
have done so much to minister to our
amusement and so helped to make the
time pass agreeably, should receive our
warmest thanks. Allow me, therefore,
gentlemen, and I am sure I write on
behalf of all, to thank you as the able
editors of our journal, which has been the
source of so much pleasure to all on
board, also the committee who have so
ably managed and carried through the
several entertainments. “ All’s well that
ends well,” and if as a natural sequence
of being thrown so closely together there
should have arisen any little difference of
opinion may it all be from henceforth
“forgotten and forgiven,” and may the
friendships formed on board last, and be
carried with us until we enter that
“ bourne whence no traveller returneth.”
Yours truly,
W.C.
The Brothers.
The old church stands ’mid the shivering
pines
Engirt with the cold, grey mist,
Where first we knelt in our boyhood’s days
At the “ feast of the Eucharist.”
And there’s the old homestead of long ago
In the heart of the rustling trees,
And yonder, the school where first we read
The tale of life’s mysteries.
How oft we chased the pale-faced moon
As she swept from behind the cloud,
And never dreamt of the sin and the shame
That are borne of the city crowd.
And now we have climbed up life’s last
hill,
From which with our burning eyes,
We look for the home which shines above
Eternal in the skies.
Say, brother, how has it been with you
Since we parted long ago
By the little stream at the meadow foot ?
Come tell me, I would know, —
Say, has the world been all you dreamed
Replete with laughter and joy,
A happy world for such it seemed
Through the rose-color’d glass of a boy.
No brother it was not what it seemed
When first I joined in the strife,
When first I saw o’er the hill and cope
The dust and smoke of life.
Ambition came like a rushing wind
And swept o’er my anxious soul,
Eager I mixed in the fight and pressed
To find my longed-for gold.
I conquered—but the years have passed.
Passed, too, what made life sweet,
My youth has fled, and the tears it shed
Lie buried at my feet.
Bright was the outset, dark was the end
To this, to this have I come,
I gave up love, I gave up faith
For a heart’s life martyrdom.
Oh heart forsaken, and hope sustained
AH lost regard for the truth,
Take all 1 have gained ye serpent years
And give me one day of youth.
Give me one hour of its innocent light,
Which shone o’er my boyhood days.
Give back but the smile of the mother
that’s dead,
And take all the wealth and the praise.
The grass is waving over many a grave
Of competitors in the strife,
And soon will it dance in its green, and
wave
O’er my own polluted life.
And yet, though late, I have felt my need
In this garden of agony,
And the pride, the blame, and the sin of
life,
I have hung on Calvary.
******
A cloud uplifted from his brow,
His brother replied with a sigh,
The grandeur of life is to feel our need
In life’s Gethsemane.
’ Neath -the burning heat of an Indian sun
I fought in life’s din and dust;
I fought, and I failed, but still in God
I firmly placed my trust.
The pride that was marring my panting
heart
I grasped with the fire of youth ;
And tried to reach by vows and prayers
The table land of the truth.
And just as the screaming sea-gulls fly
In the face of the gathering storm,
When beaten back from their airy heights*
With a fiercer cry reform.
So with the faith, new bom of God,
Christ’s bleeding feet did I track;
With a garment grasp of the Master above,
I could not turn me back.
And now we have come to the last mile-
stone
On our journey to the grave,
With heart’s repose on Him who died,
The just, the unjust, to save,
And there by the church, ’mid yon shiver-
ing pines,
That are wrapped in a cold grey mist,
Our toil-worn frames shall rest at last
Till the advent of the Christ.
JAMES P. DIXON.
A Rhapsody.
I suffer, I mourn, 1 weep, for 1 have
lost her. She is gone, she exists no
more. I weep, for I loved her much.
I shielded her by my looks, with the
gratitude of my soul. She was beautiful,
very beautiful. The pupil of her eye


was brilliant as a ruby, her eye was fire,
her flame consuming. She was of Flemish
birth ; her forehead beautiful as Chinese
porcelain, her hair of glossy blackness,
shaming the plumage of the raven ; her
form slender as a wasp, more fragile than
a reed ; her breath as Orient perfume,
sweeter than aloes and incense. She
was more than beautiful, and monarch
might have envied me my treasure.
Women shunned and detested her. I
blessed the fate that made her mine.
She was my consolation in hours
of melancholy and sorrow, and we
soared together in a vapourous existence,
forgetting every vicissitude of life. She
had given me her first sigh, her first
intoxicating caress, that filled me with
dizziness and shivering. Alas ! a per-
fidious friend has destroyed my idol. In
the shadow of night he sought my
sanctuary ; he gazed and smiled on the
object of ray devotion ; she answered
not his smile ; forgetful of the ties of
friendship, and the yet warmer ties that
bound me to this dear one alone, he
seized her fair form, and with a ruthless
grasp he broke my pipe.
A LOVER OF THE WEED.
People we have Seen.
There was a young man of Cuzco Town
Who lived in Larrikin-lane,
He used to make a noise in the middle of
the night,
Which caused us all much pain.
He was seldom on deck,
But near the bar would be
To keep the gangway clear ;
But you could not rub him out,
However cold the day,
And he never would drink much beer.
Chorus.
There was another young man of the same
abode,
Who the name of “American” bore—
He dressed himself up in his Sunday best
At the Cape to go ashore :
Such a beautiful hat you never did see—
He fancied he looked quite a lord;
And after such pains to don himself up,
Was compelled to remain on board.
Chorus.
There was a person as well,
Who was known as Kate—
’Tis the truth I’m telling, ’pon my word,
Whatever you would say it would please
her so,
She would always say “ How absurd ”
To sing sacred tunes on Sunday afternoon,
To have heard it you would have thought
it grand —
She was assisted at the time by the
accomp’ts of a really good brass band.
Chorus.
There are several others I could sing about,
But the time is getting short,
And this is the last performance we give,
For on Sunday we will be in port.
A pleasant trip I’m sure we’ve had,
And I trust we’ve offended none,
For the things we have said at different'
times
Have only been said in fun.
Chorus —But it was such glee,
When on the sea,
To watch this person’s ways:
When we think of the trip
We have had on the ship,
’Twill remind us of jolly days.
When does Captain Riddler put on his
heaviest suit ? When he wears his ship.
What’s that, when exchanged between
two parties, is something, after the
exchange nothing, and for receipt of
which neither can show any value ? A
kiss.
Before leaving England I replied to an
advertisement for the prevention of sea
sickness, which instructed that if he would
enclose twelve stamps, this remarkable
cure would be sent. I complied with
the above instructions, and by return
post received the following :—“Don’t go
to sea.”
Cuzco Minstrels.
The second and concluding entertain-
ment of the “Cuzco Minstrels” took place
in the second saloon, on Thursday evening
last, and we need scarcely say was a
decided success. The opening of the
first part of the programme found the
ministrels in the positions they occupied
at the previous performance. Mr.
Pearson (bones), and Mr. Delves (tambo),
being right and left hand corner-men
respectively. Mr. W. Sinclair acted
interlocutor. The get-up of the company
was excellent, all appearing in full dress,
some having sort the aid of higher arts in
the shape of huge bows, &c. The per-
formance opened with a selection from
“Les Cloches de Cornville, ” on the
piano, well plaj ed by Mr. C. Foss. This
was followed by a chorus by the company,
from “Pinafore,” nicely rendered and
heartily applauded. Mr. Pearson’s
“ Polly Pluck,” at a previous entertain-
ment was well rendered, “The Moon
Behind the Trees,” sung by Mr. W.
Sinclair, was, as the penny-a-liners say,
“given in his best style,” and elicited
hearty applause. The comic song “ Ridin
in a Railroad Keer,” was also given with
good effect by Mr. Delves. The pathetic
song “Who will care for Mother now,”
was nicely sung by Mr. Lenehan. Mr.
Paterson sang, “ When you and I
were young Maggie.” Mr. Paterson
possesses a very nice tenor voice, and
knows how to use it to advantage.
An original local comic song followed,


and was sung by its author, Mr. Pearson.
This was undoubtedly the song of the
evening, hitting off, as it did, “ ye
manners and customs ” of several well-
known characters on board; but w T hat
tended to its enthusiastic reception were
the remarkably excellent cartoons (drawn
by Mr. Meurgey) of the characters in
question, and which, as they were hit off
in verse, were held up to the gaze of
the critical and admiring audience, and
were received with loud laughter and
■enthusiastic applause. Mr. Delves sang
“ Hurrah for the life of a Farmer,”
which, with its excellent chorus, was
well rendered. “Kiss me Mother ’ere
I die, ” a good old Christy Minstrel song,
was sure to be well received, especially
when we say it was sung by Mr, Pater-
son. The first part was brought to
a conclusion by the company singing
*‘Come where my love lies dreaming.”
The whole of the choruses, we may say,
were well and evenly rendered, and
would have been no discredit to a profes-
sional choir. “ The wise saws and witty
sayings ” between the songs were also
very good. Part second opened with a
viola solo, “Nocturne ’’(Field), by Mr.
H. Foss, whom we should say, from his
rendering of this piece, is an excellent
player on this difficult instrument, the
viola. The cavatina, “Come into the
Garden, Maud,” was well given by Mr.
Lenehan. The comic duet in character,
“ Happy Hottentots, ” by Messrs. Pear-
son and Langley, caused much amuse-
ment, It appeared to be rather physically
exhausting to the gentlemen, as they left
the stage evidently suffering from palpi-
tation of the heart. Pianoforte solos (1)
“Bay of Sunshine,” and (2) “Musical
Box,” were well played by Mr. C. Foss.
The latter, however, failed to be appre-
ciated by that part of the audience
seated at the far end of the saloon. The
beautiful ballad, “The Bell Ringer,” was
nicely sung by Mr. Paterson. The enter-
tainment was brought to a conclusion by
a “Nigger Sketch,” to which Messrs.
Pearson and Langley did full justice by
their really comic acting. Previous to
the singing of “God Save the Queen,”
Mr. Pilley, of the first saloon, proposed
a hearty vote of thanks to the gentlemen
who had given so much of their time
and talent to the entertainment of the
passengers ; and, speaking for the first
saloon, he felt especially grateful to the
second for the amusement they had
afforded them during the voyage. We
think we are justified in saying that Mr.
Pearson was undoubtedly entitled to the
special thanks of the passengers for the
labour and talent, life and soul, which
he has thrown into these entertainments.
He has been, in fact, their backbone,
and we trust that in any future effort his
services may be as well appreciated as
they have been by his fellow-passengers,
and that he may have as good a company
to back him up as he has had on board
the Cuzco !
We must apologise for inadvertently
omitting in our last week’s issue to thank
Miss Dewhurst, Miss Parker, Miss Lowe,
Miss Pressland, and the other ladies, who
so kindly assisted in making up the
costumes for the Minstrels. We also
forgot to thank Mr. Hipwood for his in-
valuable services in connection with the
production oi the laughable farce, * ‘ The
Barber’s Shop.”
Rifle Practice.
All Englishmen are aware that on
the Ist September partridge shooting
begins in the old country, and, as if to
celebrate this event, some sporting men
in the first saloon had target shooting in
the smoking room, a dart and a glass
tube being used in the place of a rifle.
This simple amusement reminded two
gentlemen that they possessed air-guns,
and the result was on the guns being to
light, a match was arranged between the
English, Scotch, and Australians of the
first saloon. Each country being repre-
sented by six stalwart (?) champions
prepared to die or conquer in the attempt.
Having settled the terms of competition,
namely, 3 shots each at 7, 10, 13 yards,
the target was fixed, the ranges cleared
for action, and the usual danger flag
hoisted to warn stray tourists from
crossing the line of fire. The Australians
being known to be the weakest, the con-
test may be said to have rested between
the English and Scotch. The total after
the first round, showed the truth of the
above statement, and by it, may also be
seen the Scotch were superior. However,
both English and Australians beat them
in the next round, and lastly the Scotch
and Australians beat the English. The
order of the grand total is : —Scotch,
118; English, 114; Australians, 103.
The weather being rather boisterous, and
the ship somewhat unsteady, accounts
for the comparative low scores of the
competitors.
Lord Clifford, of the English, opened
the contest by scoring 14, making a bull’s
eye for his third shot. He was not so
good at 10 yards, and still worse at the
longest range.
Mr. Hamilton began well for Scotland,
by scoring a bull’s eye, but, as if thinking
he was making too many, made nothing
by his third shot. He, like his English
opponent, by no means improved at the
longer ranges. With a poor 2 for his
first shot, a bull’s eye and one for his

second and third respectively. Mr.
Henderson began for Australia. He beat
his English and Scotch opponents in the
longer ranges.
Mr. Thallon, for Scotland, and Mr.
Nathan for Australia, obtained top scores.
Mr. Smith for England did well, but did
not fulfil the expectation of the sporting
community. Mr. Short also greatly dis-
appointed all in his small total.
Appended are the scores :
The ladies, who took no little interest
in the above contest, had one themselves.
Four ladies entered as competitors, viz :
—Miss Johnston, Miss A. Johnston, Miss
Russel, and Mrs. Spiller.
Miss A. Johnson proved winner, and
Mrs. Spiller came in second.
During the last few days several “at
homes ” have been given by various
ladies in the second saloon. As most of
the gentlemen of the community have been
present at one or other of them, we think
general thanks are due to our fair fellow
passengers for their hospitality, which
we hope to be able to reciprocate ’neath
the Eucalyptus.
Woman’s Rights.
It would be trite to say these are days
of progress—progress in all the branches
of science—in education, in general re-
finement. The people in England who
can neither read or write, are, like the
American Indians, almost extinct. The
children in the board schools receive a
very good education. Ignorance would
seem to be nearly extinguished. Another
thing which strikes us, besides the pro-
gress in knowledge, is the increase in the
population of the United Kingdom. We
have no statistics at hand, but we believe
there are three women to one man We
think we shall not be far short of the
mark if we say, that two out of the three
women are obliged to pass their days in
“ single-blessedness,” even if they wished
to marry. We are sorry to say obliged,
but such really is the case, owing to
certain facts. There is a small body of
widowers who have no desire to marry
again. There is a larger class familiarly
termed “old bachelors” who do not care
to be “ hen peckedand a still larger
class of men whom the law of the land, in
mercy, allows but one wife at a time.
The state of various learned faculties
have recognised this state of things, and
have accordingly thrown open to women
various spheres of usefulness. This step
was necessary, and men should not-
grumble, if we have lady telegraph clerks,
lady doctors, and so forth. A small
section of the party in single blessedness
clamour for women's rights. What are
women’s rights. Some will tell you “it
is only fair that those of us who are
householders should have a vote in
municipal affairs, as we have a vote in
municipal elections.” Others will tell
you “ we want the franchise for every
single woman, and the right to enter
Parliament as well.”
To the first class we say, God speed;
get the franchise as soon as you can, we
will help you. But that the franchise
should be extended to every single
woman, and that they should be able to
sit as members of Parliament is monstrous.
Estimate if you can the length of their
speeches, Xantippe’s tongue wagged
at the rate of sixty seconds to the
minute ever since the beginning of
history. In Parliament, Biggar, Parnell
and Co. would be outdone. There
would be no end to obstruction. That
unruly member, the tongue, has cost one
of the single blessed ladies rather dear of
late. Actions for libel might become
more frequent if such ladies were ad-
mitted into the House of Commons,
and such ladies as legislators would be a
laughing stock to the world, and a signal
to other nations, that the hour of the
decline and fall of the British Empire
was come. It is comforting to know
that there are many cultured and
intelligent ladies who have no sympathy
whatever with this movement, yet desire
to see women’s rights granted them.
They centre their affections on the poor,
the outcasts, and the fallen. Their one
mission is to do good. They desire only
the the happiness of others. Noble
desire! True conception of women’s
rights.
ALFONSO.


Ourselves.
I said I’d write a letter
When a little time had past,
And I knew my comrades better,
So, sir, here I am at last.
And permit me first, in starting,
To say what now I write
May be taken as my parting
Benediction and good night.
I said the men were jolly—
Up to every kind of fun,
But this sometimes turns to folly,
And doesn’t end where it begun.
Practical jokes are very nice
When you practice on the rest,
But sometimes at a heavy price
Others’ pay must be confessed.
Then there are some fond of beer
And some are fond of whisky—
Sometimes they take too much, ’tis clear
They get so wild and frisky.
And then they roll, and prance, and shout,
With many a curious antic,
’Till everybody round about
Is nearly driven frantic.
Then there’s the ministerial band,
The mystic number nine,
The sailors cannot understand
The weather being fine ;
For where so many parsons be
Assembled altogether,
They say ’tis certain when at sea
To bring the roughest weather.
Then there’s Sinclair and W. A. Dare —
Two worthy gentlemen:
We all do know the thought and care
The Times occasions them.
Then let us in return express
Our heartfelt thanks to each,
And may good fortune and success
Be ever in their reach.
But one and all can truly tell
We very well agree :
I strive to please my neighbours, well
They do as much for me.
And, as I need not further write,
I’ve got no more to say—
You know we play at cards by night
And stroll about all day ;
And wo always are so jolly,
As “ Pearson’s ” song explained,
That ’twould be the greatest folly
If anyone complained.
ANON.
Through the Suez Canal to Port Said.
Concluded.
We were soon ashore, and found all
the shops or bazaars ready to do business
with the Australian visitors. In fact, an
Australian ship is looked upon as a small
El Dorado by the tradesmen, both men and
beggars, at Port Said, We passed through
the principal bazaar, consisting of open
stores—Turks, Arabs, and Frenchmen
soliciting your custom. Here also was a
large music room, filled with a motley
audience listening to the music discoursed
by eighteen young girls. They were
playing violins, and appeared to be rather
able instrumentalists. The southern end
of the bazaar opens upon Lesseps-square,
a garden, or public walk, well and prettily
laid out, and farther on still is what is
called Arab Town, the poorest and
lowest part of Port Said. In most of the
thoroughfares, outside the Cafes, of
which there appeared to be a consider-
able number, were placed small round
tables, with marble tops, and around
which people were sitting chatting over
their refreshments. We took our seats
at one facing the sea just as the moon
was rising, and called for some coffee,
thinking we would do as our Eastern
neighbours were doing. It was served in
a glass, with a tumbler of hot water to
weaken it if we pleased. It was very
strong and bitter, and one of our party
thought it might be improved by a little
whisky. They brought us a bottle, and
the charge for the whole, spirits included,
was sixpence all round. Thinking it
rather a vile mixture, I drank very little.
It was dear at any price. Although it
was now near midnight the thoroughfares
were still crowded, and it was interesting
to watch the Arabs and Egyptians in
their Eastern dress walking about under
the light of a bright full moon. In these
Eastern cities the poor seem to sleep
anywhere and everywhere. I noticed
several as we were returning to the ship,
gathering their flowing garments closely
around them, and laying themselves
down under the verandahs of the
merchant and banking houses in the open
streets. Having filled our pockets with
oranges, purchased from an Arab vendor,
we returned to the ship, but not to sleep,
for the noise of the hundred or more
Arabs—yelling, screaming, and shouting,
as they poured the coals into the ship, was
deafening. These Arabs appeared to be
strong fellows. They carry the coals in
baskets on their heads, and look like so
many demons with their rags about them
and their heads bare. We left Port Said
about half-past ten a.m., and my impres-
sion of the place was that while it was
very interesting to myself as an English-
man, it was none the less a sink of
iniquity, filled with bad women, and
with children at night, hawking filthy
literature, which they attempted to
thrust into our hands as we left for the
ship.
W. C.
An address, signed by all the second
class passengers, was presented to Captain
Riddler shortly before arrival in Mel-
bourne, in which the name of Mr. Cun-
ningham, the chief steward, was de-
servedly mentioned.

Faithful to the Unfaithful.
I will resign thy faithless tongue,
Since I have learned to doubt thee,
Dissolve the ties that round thee cling,
Now I can live without thee.
Thy snowy neck, sunbeam eyes,
No longer charm or thrill me,
The bosom where such falsehood lies,
To lose it will not kill me.
I still was true thou faithless one,
Nor yet can I forget thee,
Deceit lies in thy gentle tone,
Would God, I ne’er had met thee.
J. P. D.
At the last social gathering votes of
thanks were accorded to the entertain-
ment committees and the editors for their
services.
