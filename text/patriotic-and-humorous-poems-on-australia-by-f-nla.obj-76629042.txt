Hustralta.
Hail to Australia?s grand and glorious clime ;
Gifted so greatly by Nature?s hand divine.
Rich in her vast minerals and productive soil,
A haven and home for the man of toil.
Bright are the shores of Australia?s fair land ;
The beauties that make thy coast line so grand.
Thy skies so transparently clear and bright
Dispel all the gloom of Nature?s dark night.
Great is thy future, which yet shall unfold
Thy great wealth of minerals, thy treasures of gold.
May thy soil?s rich production and bountiful store
Show forth thy prosperity from shore to shore.
With thy swift flowing rivers and thy brooks? rippling rill,
And thy lakes calm and deep beauteous nature doth thrill.
From thy valleys and mountains, great forests and plains,
Where the birds sing so sweetly in joyous'glad strains.
May Australia?s sons thy bountiful wealth now enjoy.
Let them build up thy greatness their minds to employ.
Then in wealth, might and power, thy great future shall be,
That thy sons may rejoice when thy greatness they see.
Now, all hail, Australia ! the home of a people so free 1
For thy glory and might our true aim shall be.
With thy people so prosperous, so proud of their land,
All in unity working?a true, strong, loyal band.
May thy industries flourish and thrive beyond measure,
Then contentment shall reign that no friction can sever;
So may each of thy workers receive their fair share,
Full and plenty for all with a little to spare.
May thy trade and thy commerce so develop and grow"
To require many great ships for thy produce to stow.
Let thy ships come and go with their great cargoes of treasure
Making life in Australia a source of real pleasure.
Let peace and prosperity in thy land ever abound
So that honor and glory may on thee redound.
May all want and suffering thy shores leave forever,
The true ties of thy people may nothing e?er sever.


Thy people have talents for music and art,
Both sport and industry they fulfil their part,
And as marksmen so true with rifle they beat,
For Old England?s best marksmen did suffer defeat.
Thy sons take great honors in the old National game,
Which sets them high up on the scroll of great fame ;
On the world?s great stage they will take their full part
In good works and great deeds, of most noble art.
So honored and great our Australia will be ;
Her prowess shall ring from lands o?er the sea.
A career so well built, moulded into true shape
That proud nations may follow, and example take.
Then if v\ar should break out or danger should threaten,
On Australia?s great sons Old England could reckon.
They would find them undaunted, at the great call of duty,
Ready, aye ready, to defend home and beauty.
Three cheers for Australia, may her flag ever blend
With the bold Union Jack in harmonious trend.
May their united power so noble and grand,
So well linked together, may they ever firm stand.
Then with such a strong union completing our peace,
That the noise and the din of the war guns may cease.
With this great gifted power, well used and planned,
May we establish true peace in every land.
Mest Hustralta*
West Australia to new life awoke, when first her gold was
found ;
Then people flocked unto her shores, full ships were westward
bound.
Success for future then looked bright as fortune on her smiled,
For every space in sheds and wharf, with merchandise was piled.
Her people grew in numbers fast, fine buildings were erected ;
Our business firms ran sound brisk trade in lines they had
selected.
Thus West Australia had woke up from her long years of
sleeping ;
She had begun her onward march, for progressive peoples
keeping.


The West at last a start had made to build a great career ;
As news soon spread we had struck it rich, they flocked from'
far and near.
Phis charm of gold these people brought, to step in fortunes
wake,
They left their homes across the sea, their luck with us to
take.
Yet still they came in numbers great with goods and chattels
legion ;
Eager their fortunes here to make, in our golden western region.
So business in the West thrived well and trade was fairly
humming.
And every man was doing well whatever he was running.
Time passed along quite brisk and merry, great strides our
West was making,
To develop our mines and erect public works, was no small
undertaking.
But our leaders stuck to their task so well, our prospects
brighter growing
Our revenues and our gold increased, ever into our treasury
flowing.
Railways were built across the great plains to tap the centres
of gold,
And through agricultural districts too, for our farmers to
uphold.
Still on we went we could not stay, our progress to impede,
To grow and prosper was our goal, our every thought and deed.
So our city grew and flourished well, with never a sign of
waning,
Great piles of buildings still went up our progress ever gaining.
The best picked spots were well laid out for the public to
enjoy,
That leisure hours may pleasantly pass, midst scenes of
beauty their minds to employ.
New towns sprang up on every hand, near every suburban
station.
Thus active life and bustle reigned, to make this ?
great transformation.
What once was scrub and wild bush land, villas and
shops upon it stand,
All tending our progress to advance in this our Western land.


Our port was quite a busy scene, with passengers and stores
arriving ;
The shipping firms did rare brisk trade, fine profits thus
deriving.
They built large ships, on modern lines, to meet their growing
trade.
For this good work of enterprise, their due reward was paid.
And thus our shipping fast increased, many wants were soon
detected;
For more safe anchorage was required, these ships must be
protected.
Then our harbor works was pushed along with engineering
skill,
A work of credit when complete, a much needed want this work
did fill.
When our breakwater was built,wharfs and sheds were con-
structed ;
Then the bar was removed which for long had obstructed.
For with rock drill and powder, great rocks were dissected,
Thus a clear entrance making, for our ships was effected.
Then by work of deep dredging much land was reclaimed ;
Now with great ocean liners our port is far famed.
On this great work of energy and skill we can boast,
For we now have a harbor equal to any on the coast.
Now let us pass on to our great water scheme,
Which was thought by so many to be a wild dream ;
But our men with great foresight took up this great task.
Did they make it succeed ? Such a question don?t ask.
For with spirit of great energy, and indomitable pluck,
Facing ridicule and opposition, to this great work they stuck ;
Then they dammed back the water, and built the great weir,
Now a supply of pure water without fail is found there.
Then great pumping stations were built and well fitted
With machinery the latest, there was nothing omitted.
Now the great pipes were made of steel true and strong
To carry the water hundreds of miles along.
Now when these pipes were laid, such a great water track,
They were truly well tested, to find weak joints or slack,
In case any flaw that was unseen or quite hidden,
So no damage could happen when high pressure was driven.


monopoly
So now on our goldfields we have water quite clear;
The great scheme is now realized, working well without fear.
Now to our far-seeing leaders the sceptic now bows,
For clear as pure crystal, on the goldfields it flows.
Many travellers when weary and thirsty now drink,
When they stop at a fountain no doubt they will think
Of the men who fought hard this great scheme to carry,
They invoke on them blessings, while near it they tarry.
How marvellous our goldfields are flourishing and thriving,
Where a few years back, under canvas, people were striving ;
But their buildings now are brick and stone, much better
you could not find,
Now electric light and trams they run, they will not be left
behind.
Then at this stage of progress, for the present I conclude,
I may follow up its advancement in my next prelude,
So now for our great Western State, keep hard and constantly
working,
That we may ever onward march, no fear of duty shirking.
So with this end in view, for our people and State,
We will not be left last, though our move started late,
For with strength, hope and courage, true patriots quite bold,
May we build up a great State of might yet untold.
Monopoly must be broken down, such works must cease their
running;
Ye men of enterprise renown must stop your wit and cunning.
Thus says a section in our State?this monopoly we decry,
We will stop every mill, if not run by State or know the reason
But at this point they do not stop monopoly to define,
Their decree has gone forth, it?s quite enough, they will not
draw the line.
Ye men of business list to their cry?ye are not wanted here ;
So pick up your plant and set it down in a more mild atmos-
phere.


This applies to all our enterprise whatever the line may be :
These works you know ye must not run, they belong to State
and we.
So do not dare to argue points, their voice rings out quite clear,
If monopoly you insist to run, we will make it cost you dear.
The weary prospector wending his way footsore, thirsty and
sad ;
Just chances to strike a lucky patch which makes his heart
feel glad.
But should these people come along to claim it for the State,
They would make him trudge along again, for monopoly they
A man of business comes along, he sees an opening rare ;
He builds a business good and sound which makes these people
Why should this man do all the trade, he must by us be blocked,
So down on him they make a raid, for monopoly must be
stopped.
It?s all the same in their wise sight no matter what you touch ;
You had better give it up to State for you have got too much.
Though of your freedom ye may boast, inviting competition,
They say it is monopoly, against it they will petition.
Hotels they wish the State to run and clothing factories too ;
So now they will great business run and sell their lines to you.
One thing I note they have left out?an enterprise quite new,
If they weave our wool into our cloth great profits will acrue.
So let them have it all to run, a whim so thin and narrow ;
Don?t be surprised if State should run the common hawker?s
barrow.
Just give them time to play this game and put monopoly down,
Then empty shops you soon will find in every street in town.
Yet still I could enumerate of trade they fain would stop ;
For I believe that they would plough the land and cut the
farmer?s crop.
But now I will not take your time monopoly to explain,
I will let you know a little more if I should write again.
So let them close these works all down and pass them on to
State ;
No doubt they think it is quite right to make us bow to fate.
When this design they have worked out and all their
wishes brought about,
For State they will have fought and won, a huge monopoly it
will run.


JSefove �ut Elections.
Roll up ye workers in the Golden West,
Your electors? rights are now put to the test;
There is no time to wait or to reason why,
For the Election Day is fast drawing nigh.
So brace up your nerves for the great civil fight,
Return the best man to defend your right,
Record all your votes for the true and the tried,
Stand firm by the man who will throw self aside.
Leave out the man who self only would serve,
Or if placed in a corner from duty would swerve ;
He is seeking for self and his own increased pay,
If it ruined the country the very next day.
No time for the man who seeks only cash,
Which would place honest workers under the lash,
But as time rolls along we may hope for the day
We may find a true Statesman to work without pay.
All honor it is, and all honor is due
To the man who works freely for State and for you,
For the good work of honor you will find in due time.
Will build up Australia on a properous line.
Ye sons of Australia, with a future so great,
Work on with contentment and fight for your State,
A cause grand and noble for all sons of toil,
To build up a nation that no power could foil.
So now in conclusion, select your best man,
Who will work for your welfare and do all he can,
And when numbers are up at the close of the day,
? The best men are in,? let most of us say.
