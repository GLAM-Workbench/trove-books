Overture
" Britannia "
Mackenzie
I'his breezy and exhilarating overture is made up of three vigorous themes,
'•Rule Britannia." "The Sailor's Hornpipe," and a typical melody of Dibdenesque
cpiality. There is much humour in the work; in fact, at the very beginning,
where the drum marks the rhythm of "Rule Britannia," one can perceive the
merry mood of the composer in evidence all through, particularly towards the
end of the work, where the hornpipe motif at last gets in after many attempts
to gain a hearing.

Epilogue " It Comes from the Misty Ages "

(From " The Banner of St. George ")
(11 'ords copyright)
Printed by special permission oj Messrs. Novella & Co.
It comes from the misty ages,
The banner of England's might,
flic blood-red cross of the brave St. George
That burns on a held of white!
It speaks of the deathless heroes.
On fame's bright page inscrolled,
And bids great England ne'er forget
The glorious deeds of old!
O'er many a cloud of battle,
The' banner has floated wide
It shone like a star o'er the valiant heart
That dashed the Armada's pride!
For ever amid the thunders,
The sailor could do or die,
While tongues of flame leaped forth below,
And the flag of St. George was high!

"IT COMES FROM THE MISTY AGES" {continued)
O ne'er may the flag beloved
Unfurl in a strife unblest,
But ever give strength to the righteous arm,
And hope to the hearts oppressed!
It says through the passing ages,
"Re brave if your causg be right!
Like the soldier-saint whose cross of red,
Still burns on your banner white!"
Great race, whose empire of splendour,
Has dazzled a wondering world!
May the flag that floats o'er thy wide domains
Re long to all winds unfurled!
Three crosses in concord blended,
'l'he banner of Britain's might!
But the central gem of the ensign fair
Is the cross of the dauntless knight!

I rranged for full Orchestra by Mr. Joseph Bradley
Words by Mr. Arthur H. Adams.
Vast the heritage we hold,
League on endless league unrolled.
Splashed with Sun and Wattle-Gold,
God's domain, Australia!
Great our opportunity.
Greater must our courage be:
For our race we hold in fee,
God's domain, Australia!
Sons of those who won the sea,
Of imperial blood are we;
Ours the country of the free,
Gods domain, Australia!
Freedom for our onward stride!
Wide our continent, and wide
Are the faiths and hopes that guide
God's domain, Australia.
Though begirt with guardian seas,
Xot in careless, slothful ease
Shall we shield thy liberties —
God's domain, Australia!
Loyal scions of our race,
Ready chance and change to face
We shall die, but ne'er disgrace
God's domain, Australia.

:
Patti and Melba.
Which the Greater ?
Below "Chibiabos" replies to the remarks of "Musicalus"
under the above headings in the last issue of "The Theatre
Magazine." The two writers so ably set forth their respective
cases that the reader is left, without editorial comment, to form
his own conclusions as to the issues in dispute. "Chibiabos"
recalls the fact that Patti's annual earnings in England between
1861 and 1881 averaged from £30,000 to £35,000. Interesting,
too, Is his reminder that when Melba first sang at Covent Garden
the London Press almost unanimously declared she was a good
actress and a poor singer, and that by an eminent authority—
it is believed, Sir Arthur Sullivan —she was told she would never
be a great singer
These people who cannot read
even a simple paragraph correctly
are a perpetual torment, are they
not? One "Musicalus" complains
that I have been trying to prove
that Melba has eclipsed Patti. I
haven't. I have been trying to do
something -totally different
namely, to point out that his sneer
at Melba is quite unjustified. No-
body ever asserted that Patti was
not a great singer—a peerless
singer, indeed, in her own domain;
and the efforts of "Musicalus" to
imply that I made some such as-
sertion really amount to so much
beating of the air. Do let him try
before he endeavors to reply to an
argument, to discover what that ar-
gument really is! Then possibly he
will not misrepresent it.
Not Comparable.
As a matter of fact, Patti and
Melba are not comparable. Patti
las attained without effort, by rea-
son of her wonderful gifts, solely
is a coloratura singer, the eminence
or which others have had to
itruggle. "Musicalus" quotes a few
>f the high sums she has received.
3ut he might have gone still fur-
her, and told us that her annual
arnings between 1861 and 1881 in
Ingland averaged from £30,000 to
E 35,000, and that even the highest
f these sums was largely exceeded
a her professional tours in North
rnd South America. Her share of
he profits resulting from her visit
o Argentina in 1888 amounted to
early £50,000. But these facts do
rot prove that Madame Melba is
lot an eminent singer, do they?
As I have said, the two women
are not comparable. Patti is—or
was, for her voice now, naturally,
has practically gone—unsurpassed
as a coloratura singer in roles like
Violetta, for instance.
Applause No Criterion.
But, after all, are we not wasting
precious time, and preciohs space,
in seeking to gauge the merits of
an artist by the volume of applause
which he or she excites? We could
all quote numberless instances of
artists who were sadly neglected by
the people. It would be preposter-
ous to suppose that their art was
one whit the less distinguished on
that account. One example which
comes to my mind as I write is fur-
nished in the last American tour of
the London Symphony Orchestra
under Richter. Outside New York
this fine band, at its head one of
the greatest conductors the world
has seen, played to "a beggarly ar-
ray of empty benches." But no one
would be fatuous enough to declare
that, by reason of that fact, these
concerts were not amongst the fin-
est ever given in America.
Nor Salary' Either.
And are we not guilty of even a
greater folly in trying to estimate
the merits of an artist by assessing
his or her salary? Let me quote for
"Musicalus" these words of an Eng-
lish writer whose judgment on this
point, it seems to me, is singularly
accurate: —
In judging matters of art, the average
Englishman has two soul-sides, one
plutocratic, the other aristocratic. He
asks the artist either how much he
earns, or else who his father was, and
admires accordingly. When Meredith's
will was proved at over £30,000, people
began to believe that he must have
been a great novelist; and when Swin-
burne's obituary disclosed the fact that
he was connected with the peerage,
people were certain that we had lost a
poet. If an artist cannot immediately
command fabulous prices, or is not men-
tioned in Debrett, our judgment is pain-
fully erratic.
This furnishes an apt comment
upon the point of view from which
apparently "Musicalus," like many
others, judges questions of art; and
it may prove valuable also in solv-
ing his doubts as to my meaning
when I suggested that his line of
argument would endow Charlie
Chaplin with higher qualities as an
artist than either Mary Garden or
Elsa Stralia.
