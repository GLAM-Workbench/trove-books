Sir Roger was in early youth,
A gallant son of Mars ;
Though boasting of his rowell’d spurs,
He could not boast of scars;
Yet soon like other soldiers bold.
He felt love’s pointed dart;
lhat through his shining breast-plate pierced,
Until it pierced his heart.
A wln&tie shrill was all she heard.
The train was out of sight;
Love’s cheering sun no longer shone.
And all seemed darkest night;
But as the poet sings you know,
“ Men were deceivers ever,
One foot on land and one on sea,
To one thing constant never.”
One day when he from church returned.
In Canterbury town ;
Where with his gallant troop he’d been,
He eyed a ladies’ gown ;
He on the wearer smiled so sweet,
Her heart went pit-a-pat;
And whilst his soldiers stood outside,
He in the house did chat.
This truth alas bir Roger proved,
As down the Thames he sail’d ;
For as the vessel Wapping neared,
A waterman he hailed ;
At Wapping a young lady lived,
On whom his thoughts now ran;
For there he’d found another Kate,
Whose name was Mary Ann.
But soon the gallant Carbineers,
Their quarters had to change ;
And at their head Sir Roger rode,
With feelings new and strange;
For he was forced alas to leave,
The lady of his love ;
Yet ere he went, he rashly vowed.
He’d ever constant prove.
He told her how a scarlet coat,
No lunger he should wear ;
For England he’d resolved to leave,
At least for many a year ;
When he returned if she proved true,
He’d make her then his wife ;
For in her smile was all his joy,
His happiness in life.
But soldiers oft like other men,
Make vows they never keep ;
And Roger still was in his teens,
Though he in love was deep ;
A letter from his Uncle came,
Inviting him to come ;
And visit him at Tichborne Park,
When Kate from school came home.
Then to Wagga Wagga Sir Roger went.
On his way to Woolomoloo;
For he had set out with a trusty friend,
To hunt the Kangaroo ;
At the Bush Hotel one night they stopp’d.
Some Kangaroo steak to fry ;
And on the buxom cook-maid there,
Sir Roger cast his eye.
Now Roger when but yet a boy,
Oft with his cousin played;
And now that he was grown a man,
His thoughts to her oft strayed;
He quickly asked and leave obtained,
Then down to Hampshire went;
And with the girl a woman now,
His Holiday he spent.
For she cooked the steak so very nice,
It was done just to a turn ;
And as the savoury viands smokod,
With love his heart did burn;
He felt that night as when the train.
Bore him from Kate away;
And he resolved his suit to plead,
At once, without delay.
In 1 ichhorne Park beneath the trees,
Like turtle doves they cooed;
And as their shadows lengthened there,
His cousin Kate he wooed ;
But all too soon Sir Roger found,
Love’s sky was overcast;
Those happy moments now enjoyed,
Were all too bright to last.
He said Miss Bryant if you’ll be mine,
At once I’ll alter my plan ;
And though I prove false to my Cousin Kate,
I’ll be true to Mary Ann ;
She coyly blushed, then at once she said,
Tom Castro I’m yours for life*;
And if that you a good husband prove,
I’ll make you a loving wife.
Sir Edward when he urged his suit,
Refused at once consent;
And finding argument was vain,
To his Aunt, Sir Roger went;
But Lady Doughty coldly said,
For three years you must wait;
And if that time your love survives,
You then may marry Kate.
That night the wedding day was fix'd,
13ut no Priest was for miles around ;
When Sir Roger at last by a lucky chance,
A Baptist Minister found ;
Who quickly united the happy pair,
And his humble blessing gave ;
And Sir Roger’s no longer a roving knight,
But a cook-maid’s willing slave.
He said good bye to all his friends,
Farewell to Cousin Kate ;
And must we part for ever now,
Is such love’s cruel fate;
A locket with two hearts conjoined,
Hound her fair neck he hung ;
A silk embroidered purse she gave,
As to his arm she clung.
Sir Roger now a married man,
Resolved no more he'd roam;
So with his wife and infant son,
One day set sail for home;
His mother said when he returned.
This is no Artful Dodger;
That he’s my long lost son I’m sure.
For he’s brought a little Roger,
