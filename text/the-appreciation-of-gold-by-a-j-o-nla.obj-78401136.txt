THE ?APPRECIATION OF GOLD.?
Y.J.O.
No. I.
It seems to be admitted on all sides
that the pound sterling has about twice
the purchasing power that it had a
generation ago. This fall of prices has
been called the appreciation of gold,
not the depreciation of goods, because
it is supposed to be caused by a grow-
ing scarcity of the coin material, gold.
I take the liberty to dispute that, and
to offer a different explanation. The
scarcity of gold explanation has been
jumped at partly because it seemed at
first glance to many to be the only and
obvious solution, and partly because the
fall of prices followed soon after the
adoption of the gold standard by other
countries as well as Great Britain. This,
however, is a mere coincidence. What
I shall try to show is that it is money as
money, not gold as gold that has
? appreciated,? and that it was inevit-
able, no matter whether the coin
material were gold, silver, or cowries,
and whether we had monometallism or
bimetallism. The accepted theory is
that prices are determined by the
amount of coin in circulation ; that is,
that if there were only half the number
of sovereigns in circulation, the amount
of business done remaining the same,
or if the amount of business were
doubled the number of sovereigns re-
maining the same, the sovereign would
appreciate ; each sovereign would have
to do double duty, and cover twice as
much goods, z'.e., prices would fall one-
half. Conversely if the sovereigns
were doubled or the business halved.
Well, if the sovereigns have fallen
short oi requirements that would ex-
plain it. But they have not, Gold has
not, in the period in question, become
scarcer, but much more plentiful,
relatively to requirements as well as
actually.
1. As to Annual Output.?There have
in this period been wider and richer
gold discoveries than at any former
period, Pizarro?s perhaps excepted ;
first in California, later in the Eastern
Australian colonies, later still in South
Africa and West Australia. At the
same time scientific discoveries and
mechanical inventions have increased
the facilities for working these in-
creasingly abundant deposits. There
is now more gold found, and more
easily got than at any previous known
period.
2. Past Accumulations.?Gold, being
at once highly valued and practically
indestructible, has in the course of
centuries accumulated in private hands
for ornamental and other purposes in
enormous quantities. The wear and
tear for these purposes is so slight that
we may almost say we have the whole
accumulation of past ages to draw
upon if at any time the supply of coin
should run short.
3. Hoarding of gold, which in former
days was the chief way of accumulating
savings, has practically ceased in all
civilised and progressive countries, and
all these hoards are now added to the
available supply.
4. The need for coin does not increase
proportionately with increasing busi-
ness. On the contrary, the more
commerce is extended the better it is
organised, and the more securely credit
is established the less coin is required.
The great mass of business is ever in-
creasingly transacted by cheques, notes,
bills of exchange, balancing of contra


accounts and so on, very little coin
passing at all, except for petty trans-
actions and odd surpluses. Moreover,
the more rapid the circulation the less
the coin required proportionately to
the business done, the same money,
whether in coin or paper, effecting a
vast number of successive transactions
in the course of the year.
Such being the case, it does not seem
possible for the sovereign to have
appreciated through growing scarcity
even for the briefest space, much less
for a permanence.
It seems as absurd to imagine that
sovereigns could become inconveniently
scarce so long as the gold of which
sovereigns are made existed in abund-
ance, uncoined, in the shape of bullion,
plate, ornaments, and so on, as to
imagine there could arise an incon-
venient scarcity of chairs to sit on so
long as the timber of which chairs are
made existed in abundance in the shape
of logs, sawn timber, superfluous tables,
and cupboards, and so on. Given the
material, the slightest temporary
scarcity of any particular form of it
will at once cause enough of the super-
flous material to be made into the
required form, and restore the de-
ficiency. If coin did begin to fall short
of demand, it is the banks that would
feel it first ; the public could not so
long as it could call on a bank to cash
its paper ; and the bank finding a
scarcity of this coin (a mere scarcity of
the coin, remember, not a mere en-
tanglement of its business affairs)
would either have its bullion at once
turned into coin, or if it had no bullion
would offer a slight temporary premium
for gold, just enough to divert a little
more than usual of the ever-incoming
supply from the goldsmith to them*
selves, and so make up the deficiency
before the public found out that it
existed.
Nor could the sovereign depreciate
from over-abundance (except in the
same momentary scarce perceptible
manner), because while the use for gold
as gold is practically unlimited in
extent and variety, coin is restricted to
a single use?that of exchange, and for
this a certain quantity only is required,
an excess being as inconvenient as a
deficiency, and the overplus is re-
jected. No one (except a bank for
limited necessary reserves) wants, or
will keep, more than a very few
sovereigns. If he has �lOO coming to
him he would much rather not have it
in sovereigns, but paid into his credit
at a bank (generally done by a mere
written order.) If the sovereigns are
forced upon him, he promptly gets
rid of them by depositing them in
a bank, and the bank as promptly
passes them out to its customers, if
they will take them. But they, for
the same reasons, will not take more
than a few each, so that if there
are more than these customers will
take, the bank finds itself saddled with
a supply of useless gold to be got rid of
somehow as may seem best.
It is so much safer and simpler to
keep your money in the shape of a
credit entry at a bank than in that of a
pile of sovereigns in a strong box, and
so much easier to write a cheque when
you want to make payment than to go
to the strong box, that every one
adopts the former course. It is only
when a man is doubtful whether the
cheque offered him will command
sovereigns if required, that he refuses
the cheque and insists on the sovereigns,
and it is only when he is doubtful
whether his bank has got sovereigns
enough that he hastens to draw out his
balance. Directly he is satisfied that
the cheque is ? good ? and the bank
? safe,? he prefers the cheque to the
coin and leaves his balance intact. In
short, you may almost say that no
one ever wants sovereigns except when
he cannot get them.
Hence it is no more possible to force
more sovereigns into circulation than
business requires than to pour more
water into a bucket that is already
full. Where people persist in coining
more sovereigns than are wanted, as at
the Sydney and Melboure mints, the
number of sovereigns in circulation does
not increase ; there are no more
sovereigns circulating, in proportion to
business done, in Melbourne or Sydney
than elsewhere ; the overplus ? runs
over ? and disappears somehow.
The supply of coin then accommo-
dates itself to requirements, and any


rise or fall of prices cannot therefore
be due to scarcity or excess of coin, bub
to some other cause.
When we hear of quantities of gold
lying idle in the banks, this does not
imply that so much ?capital? cannot
find investment; it merely means?
That there is a financial crisis and
stagnation of trade, less business being
done, and therefore less coin wanted to
do it, so that the overplus accumulates
in the banks as before stated ; and the
banks cannot get rid of it, not because
substantial borrowers cannot be found,
but because they do not choose to take
out their loans in that inconvenient
shape.
If the bank did lend a borrower
1,000 sovereigns he would simply and
immediately re-deposit them in the
bank, and draw on his account, and
there is nothing for the bank to do in
such case but melt it down, or wait till
reviving business requires more coin.
The 1,000 sovereigns, then, are not
? idle capital, seeking investment.?
The sum as a sum has just been lent,
and the Bank cannot go on lending it
over and over again, even though no
one will take it out in sovereigns, so
that the sovereigns remain on its hands.
The sovs. as sovs. are idle, but the
capital as capital is fully invested.
The supply of coin then accommo-
dates itself to requirements, instead of
exceeding or falling short of them, and
so deranging prices. Any rise or fall
of prices, then, cannot be dueto scarcity
or excess of coin, but to some other
cause.
No. 11.
Prices might fall through dis-
coveries, inventions, and improvements
cheapening production ; and, no doubt
many articles have become cheaper
from this cause ; but it cannot account
for that general fall of prices which
producers all round complain of. lor
such improvements act most irregularly,
making vast strides along particular
lines, and no perceptible advance on
others, and the cheapening so produced
does not lessen profits or wages. The
general all-round and (to the producer)
impoverishing fall of prices which we
are here dealing with must be due to
some wider, more universal cause.
Let it be understood, too, that the
general fall referred to does not mean
that everything is now cheaper than it
was absolutely, for some goods, certain
furs, for example, having become
more difficult _to procure, have
actually risen in price. But the
general movement affects even these,
for though dearer _ than they were
(owing to their growing scarcity), they
are nob yet so dear as they would nave
been but for this general fall. No one
pursuit, open to all, can ever continue
more profitable than another, much
less more profitable than all others.
Directly it was found to be so, increased
competition in that line would soon
restore the level. The rise of price in
some few articles then merely means
their increased cost of production ;
and the general fall of prices means
that all things are now cheaper in
comparison with their cost of produc-
tion; in other words, that the work of
production is worse paid?in money,
that is, nominally. I hope to show
that it, and all other useful work, is
worse paid in money?s worth - that is,
in reality.
No. 111.
The last, and I believe the true,
explanation of the fall of prices is what
is called over-production, but is really
under-consumption, due to the con-
traction of ?effective demand,? which
again is caused by the present unequal
and apparently inequitable apportion-
ment of the annual product (or rather
of its value), not of past accumulations,
which would not so much matter;
those who work hardest, longest, and at
the most disagreeable or dangerous
work being generally worst paid, and
those who do little, often nothing, to
further work having the largest claim
on the proceeds. In Tasmania, for
instance, in the income tax estimates
the farmer?s earnings are estimated at
half the rent ; the man who does
nothing to produce the rent re-
ceiving twice as much as the man
who does. Hence the many poor
cannot buy all they want, and
the few rich are increasingly disinclined
to buy all they could. Discoveries and


inventions have so increased the pro-
ductiveness of labour that the supply
of this ?effective demand,? limited as it
is by poverty at one end, and ? saving?
at the other, is effected without employ-
ing all the workers, whence ensues
intense competition amongst the
workers for employment, bringing
down the price of work and of the pro-
ducts of work.
I use the terra ? work ? rather than
the more usual one of ?labour,? be-
cause custom has restricted the term
labour? to the lower, more mechani-
cal, and worst paid form of work, and
the reduction of earnings I am re-
ferring to applies to all work, whether
of the head or hand, whether superior or
inferior, whether by employer or em-
ployed, whether in trade or the pro-
fessions.
But if this be so, why has it not hap-
pened before ?
Well, I give several reasons, closely
connected, yet distinct.
(a.) Natural resources are now more
completely monopolised than they ever
were before. The homeless cannot
erect a shanty on the most uninviting
VaC j s P�k> fh� labourer cannot put a
spade to grow a few vegetables in the
most neglected corner, the prospector
cannot search for minerals in the
wildest mountain range, the villager
may not turn his cow on the poorest
pasture, the passenger may not take a
short cut, the tourist may not quit the
high road to admire the scenery with-
out running up against a landlord who
warns him off"; old pathways are
shut up, the commons have to a
great extent been enclosed bit by
bit, the very fish in the rivers, the
seaweed washed up by the waves,
the limpets growing between high and
low watermark, are all claimed and
barred. In America, though there
remain thousands of square miles un-
used, there is hardly an acre worth
having still open to selection. Every-
where the land speculator gets ahead
of the landuser and snaps up the land.
One third of American farmers no
longer own the land they use, but are
crushed by rent ; another third are
mortgaged up to their full value, and
are crushed by interest, and the
remaining third are fast following the
other two. In Australia, as else-
where, the landowner as distinguished
from the landuser commands the
situation more and more. Land wanted
for cultivation is kept under
sheep on unimproved bush pasture,
though farm rents are forced up
by the artificial scarcity of farms so
produced till the farmer can barely
both ends meet, and some
colonies with vast areas of good land
untouched (but not unmonopolised),
and with willing men unemployed, do
not raise their own food supply. Tas-
mania, for instance, imports wheat and
oats, butter, bacon, and other products,
which she could supply for her own use
and for export, abundantly. Mineral
lands, again, though reserved from
actual sale, are let to dummy companies
of mere speculators, who simply sit on
them and keep other people off. And
so on with all our natural resources.
One after another they are monopolised
and in great part ?kept from use;
sometimes from any use, as with the
dummy company and the land specu-
lator, but more often merely from the
use . for which they are most wanted
which is enough to force up the price of
all land wanted for such use, and check
progress in that particular line.
(b.) All the sentiment connected
formerly with land ownership and
occupation is fast disappearing. The
nobleman who clings to his estate
because his family has owned it,
and the yeoman because his fathers
have lived on it for generations, and
who take a pride in it and recognise a
duty attached to it, are types unknown
in America and the colonies, and fast
dying out in England. Everywhere (in
Anglo-Saxon communities at any rate)
land is coming more and more to be
regarded as a mere investment for
capital ; something to be acquired not
to use, but to prevent other people from
using, except for the highest rent that
he squeezed out of them ; some-
thing to be bought up at advance price
by the rich, who can afford to putup with
a small return tor a few years in view
of a big profit later as the land value
increases, while the real landuser
having to live by his work requires


immediate return for his money (when
he has any money), and has, therefore,
no chance in the bidding ; finally some-
thing which the owner may legiti-
mately put to whatever use, non-use,
or misuse brings him in most money, no
matter how much other people may be
inconvenienced, natural opportunities
held back, and national progress
checked.
(c.) Again the capitalist, in the sense
of the moneyed man (the sense univer-
sally accepted in the business world),
has now more complete command of
the whole field of enterprise. Every-
thing is being done on a larger and ever
larger scale. The handicraftsman dis-
appears before the factory, the small
farms are consolidated into large ones,
the universal provider swallows up the
shops, the big steamer supersedes the
small sailing vessels, the syndicate buys
up the surrounding mines, the trust
gets control of the whole salt, oil, or
fish trade. Everywhere capital, in the
sense of money, has full possession, and
the man who would start from small
beginnings and work his way up inde-
pendently finds no place to make his
small beginning. There are no inde-
pendent openings left anywhere; or
at any rate they are fast disappearing.
Every worker must find an employer,
and the employer resolves himself into
a money man. The architect and
engineer who design, the expert who
understands, the organiser who
arranges, the overseer who directs,
as well as the underlings who obey,
are all hired servants, or contrac-
tors, or professionals, who receive
? current rates ? (rates continually cut
down by their competition for employ-
ment) for their services, but who have
no claim on the product. That goes to
the man _ who has merely ? put his
money ? into it, and without doing a
hand?s turn to the work expects all the
annual profit and his whole capital
back at the end. One result of the
increasing magnitude of enterprise is
the rise of the shareholder. Everything
being done by companies, the owners
of the enterprise being a number of
people, great and small, who have
simply bought up the shares, and not
only do none of the actual work, but
have practically no more to do with the
management than they have with the
Solar System. The real worker of
every sort is a mere seeker for employ-
ment, a competitor for employment, a
bringer down of wages, salaries, fees?
earnings of work ; while the mere
money-owner can grow richer and
richer without work by mere invest-
ment and reinvestment.
No. IV.
There is an old saying that ? who
buys, sells that is, that no one can
get goods or services without rendering
goods or services in return. It is quite
false, as everyone knows. All ground
rent (amounting to millions per annum)
consists in the right to demand goods
and services from the landuser for
mere permission to use the land, no
goods or services being given in return.
All fortunes realised by past sales of
land consist of money received for
mere transfer from an outgoing to an
incoming landlord of this right to levy
toll upon industry. These fortunes are
not converted into coin (so no more
coin is required), but are registered as
general purchasing power, expressed as
State debentures, mortgages, company
shares ; that is, as a claim for ? money
lent(really mere transfers of regis-
tered claims), authorising the owner
to demand goods and services from the
State revenue, the land produce, or the
business profit, to the whole capital
value at a future date. The interest
on these fortunes represents a further
separate, annual claim for goods and
services up to the date named, when
the whole capital value is to be re-
turned undiminished.
All these claims and all these incomes
represent no goods or services ren-
dered, either in the present or in the
past, by the holders and recipients, or
by their predecessors. From first to
last they are all pure Tribute? that is
a toll levied on industry, as dis-
tinguished from Earnings, or the reward
of work.
Allthese landlords,fortune-possessors
and interest-receivers, so far as they
represent or originate in rent, are pure
parasites licensed to live without work
on the earnings of those who do work?


to receive without giving?to ? buy ?
without ? selling,? and every ? fall of
prices ? means a fall of earnings, and a
rise of tribute ; it means that so much
less money will command so much
more goods and services; so much
more work must be done to pay
off so much debt, or realise so much
income ; so much more of the annual
output is diverted from the worker to
the non-worker?from ?Labour? to
? Capital ? ?from the man who gives
work or goods for money to the man
who gives money for work or goods. It
is these all-devouring claims on the
worker that, together with the con-
traction of effective demand, produces
that depreciation of earnings that ex-
hibits itself as lowered prices. The
nature of the currency has nothing to
do with the matter. It is true that all
these claims are payable in gold if de-
manded, and that if they were so de-
manded there is not gold enough in the
whole world (ready produced) to meet
them. Still since, as I have shown,
they are not so demanded, the impossi-
bility of meeting them if they were is
of no consequence. Perhaps this state
of things is all right. Perhaps the
money was all honestly earned. Per-
haps its tremendous, all-commanding
power over land and labour, food and
tools, over all the opportunities, requi-
sites and products of work is a neces-
sary inevitable consequence of its
nature, lam not here concerned with
that question ; I am only concerned
with the facts. My subject is the fall
of prices, and my business simply to
account for it
This ever-intensifying monopoly of
all opportunity for the worker even
to maintain, let alone enrich, himself by
independent direct access to nature
drives the worker ever more and more
into absolute dependence on the ex-
penditure of the rich in either hiring
him to work or buying the goods which
represent his work. If the rich will not
spend, then workers cannot find em-
ployment, nor goods sell; and just in so
far as the rich ?save money,? just in
so far does employment become scarce
and earnings fall, and just in
so far does the market for
goods become contracted and prices
fall. In short, the fall of prices is
merely one way of expressing the fall
of earnings.
The moneyed man, or capitalist as he
is called, does not as such supply any-
thing. He does not supply the soil we
cultivate, the sites we build on, the
minerals we extract, the natural
resources of any kind that we put to
use. He only buys them up and
charges for the use of them. He does
not supply the labour that turns these
natural resources to use ; he only hires
it (or worse still, leaves it unhired.)
He does not supply the food the
workers eat, the tools they use, the
appliances of any kind that enterprise
requires. He only buys these up ;or
worse still, leaves them unbought as
? overproduced? goods; goods, that is,
produced in excess not of human
wants, but of ? effective demand? ; and
as he commands all the requisites
of production, he commands
as a necessary consequence the
products. In short, he supplies
nothing, but commands everything.
But, it is said, people do not nowadays
hoard their savings, but invest them ;
that is, lend them out at interest for
other people to spend, so that the
money gets spent all the same. True, it
is spent, but not in the way wanted ;
not in relieving the congestion, but in
maintaining it ?not in buying the
? over-produced? final products, but in
advances to the producer to enable him
to keep up the ? over-production.? For
example?Capitalist A, with �lOO to
spare, refuses to buy worker B?s �lOO
worth of unsold goods, and also to buy
anything else that B might supply in-
stead, because he wants to save his
money, not to spend it ; but
he offers to lend B �lOO on security
of his plant to enable him to carry on.
How does this mend matters? It does not
help B to sell his surplus goods; it does
not reduce the cost of producing them ;
it opens out no new prospect ; it only
enables B to struggle on a little longer,
but under an increased burden of debt.
True, the money is spent all the same,
and by the same person B, whether he
obtains it from A by sale of finished
goods or by loan, but the results in the
two cases are wide as the poles apart.


What was wanting was not the power somebody else), still it gives security to
to produce (that existed already, in each individual who saves and averts
?* \ 1 I if 1 * * J* _ I I ___ A BA A�B d d r-~A /I
excess as you may say), but the motive,
that is the prospect of selling what
was produced, i.e ., an effective demand.
A?s refusal to buy abolishes that effec-
tive demand, and his loan does not
restore it.
The inability of the poor buy,
and the disinclination of the rich to
spend, both alike restrict the field of
employment, check production, and
lower earnings and prices.
The inability of the poor to buy,
which means the low rate of their earn-
ings (caused by land monopoly and
money saving, limiting the demand
for work) deprives the workers, not
only of direct enjoyments, but also of
a vast market for their labour and its
products. If, say, half the money that
now goes in tribute to the non-
workers went in wages to the workers,
their mutual demand for each other?s
goods and services would find work
for all, abolishing the army of
the unemployed and only par-
tially employed (whose cut-throat
competition for employment is the
chief proximate cause of low wages),
and effectually prevent all possibility
of ?over production.? The goods which
are now a ? drug in the market,? would
go off rapidly, and producers start fresh
supplies, to be followed by further sup-
plies as these were in turn consumed.
Industry would resolve itself all round
into a continuous interchange of useful
services, and the markets would be far
steadier than they are at present, inas-
much as there would no longer be the
same pressing temptation to over pro-
duce in any particular department, and
inasmuch as the wants of the poorer
classes are less liable to sudden changes
of fashion or caprice, and can be pretty
accurately calculated in advance.
No. V.
The disinclination of the rich to spend
is equally disastrous. Reasonable in-
surance by money-saving against acci-
dent and old age is always good,
because, though the_ ?savings? are
purely imaginary (since nothing is
really ? put by ? except a claim on
privation. But, every pound ? saved ?
beyond such reasonable insurance
simply narrows the area of ? effective
demand? and checks ' production. If
I refuse to buy my neighbour?s goods,
not because they are of no use to me,
but simply because I want to ? save
money,? then there is nothing really
saved in the present, while there will
be less produced in the future ;
consequently a net loss to society.
There will be nothing saved in
the present, because goods are
produced to be consumed, and if not
consumed will spoil, so they will be
lost equally, whether I (or somebody) do
or do not consume them ; and surely
it is better that they should be usefully
or agreeably consumed than that they
should spoil.
And there will be less produced in the
future, because goods are produced for
sale prior to consumption, and if I (or
somebody) will not buy them there is
no object in producing them. Even if
somebody else buys what I do not the
loss from my saving is not avoided,
For evidently in that case there were
two people who could buy, he and I ;
but only one of us did buy, therefore
the loss to ? effective demand ? remains.
?But if low prices are a loss to the
producer, they must in the same degree
be a gain to the consumer : and as the
producer is himself a consumer, must
he not gain in the one capacity exactly
what he loses in the other?? Certainly
not. Every producer consumes some
things, but not all things ; often (un-
fortunately) very few things. On
everything that he produces, but does
not consume, he suffers the whole loss
of a fall of prices. Take the lowest
order of producer, the ?labouring
man.? The list of articles which he
consumes is of the very shortest.
Speaking roughly, 99 out of 100 of the
articles that till the price-lists are
things that he never dreams of buying,
and every fall of price in any one of
these (which is not caused by improve-
ments cheapening production) repre-
sents a loss to him as a producer
for which he receives no compensa
tion as a consumer. Take now some


article which he does consume ;
say boots ; and suppose boots to
fall Is. a pair. Then he loses Is. on
every pair he makes, and gains Is. on
every pair he buys. But as he makes,
probably 100 pairs for one pair that he
buys, he will lose 100s. for every one
that he gains.
Of course the figuresare only given for
illustration, and do not pretend to be
exact. My point is the fact of his
loss, not its precise magnitude. If
there were no mass of ever-accumulat-
ing money claims enabling the owners
to receive without giving, to buy
without selling?and every purchase
resolved itself into an exchange of
service, then it would matter little
whether prices were high or low, for
everyone would gain in one way what
he lost in the other. It is the quantity
of these accumulated claims that repre-
sents the loss to producers through low
prices. Every fall of price (not caused
by lessened cost of production, mea-
sured in labour not wages) benefits the
buyer at the expense of the seller- the
money owner at the expense of
the producer-the capitalist at the ex-
pense of the worker.
Neither the increased consumption of
the working masses, nor the increased
expenditure of the money-owners
would lessen the sum of wealth, but on
the contrary, greatly increase it ; for
both would resolve themselves into a
productive exchange of services, bene-
ficial all round. The increased con-
sumption of the working masses would
create a vast home market stimulating
production in all directions, giving
work to all the unemployed, abolishing
all chance of ?over-production,? raising
prices and earnings ; and the expendi-
ture of the rich would merely mean
their exchange of useless ? money ?
(useless so long as unspent) for useful
goods or services increasing the sum of
wealth or of enjoyment.
Bear ever in mind this golden maxim,
? that money spent remains unspent/?
Labour may be wasted, goods may be
destroyed, but money only changes
hands, and is available for spending
and re-spending in the new hands, and
in any successive number of hands.
�foo would suffice to transact all the
business of a pretty large and busy
community?if only it were kept going;
�lOO spent 10 times successively by
different people in a day would repre-
sent 10 pretty large transactions, and
would be equivalent to �l,OOO spent
once in a day, to �7,000 spent once in
a week, and to �365,000 spent once in a
year, and not even 100 sovereigns, or
near it, would be wanted, for the far
greater part would be effected by paper
exchange and balancing of contra
accounts. Increased power of con-
sumption by the masses would benefit
all the workers, employers as well as
employed, the professional as well as
the trading class. The farmer would
no longer be in despair what to produce
or how to find sale for it, the
merchant or shopkeeper to get his
goods off, the manufacturer to dispose
of his wares. The doctors would find
paying patients, the briefless barristers
other occupations, the artist, architect,
engineer, abundant call for their
services. And as for the farmer,
rising wages would mean falling rents,
so that matter would square itself. The
farm that fetches �lOO a year when
wages are 10s. a week will certainly
not fetch that when wages are 20s. The
landlord can only get what tenant
competition compels. Rent is a sur-
plus (of a sort), and the heavier the
working expenses the less the surplus
available for the landlord.
If gold were ?over-produced? as
goods are, gold, too, would in its turn
depreciate; more goods would ex-
change for less gold. The price of gold
would pot fall, but prices of goods
would rise. The price of gold can not
vary, because its price is its exchange
value as against itself, which must
be always the same. An ounce
of gold is worth (in round num-
bers) �4, not by force of any law
or custom, but from the simple fact
that an oupce of gold will coin into
four sovereigns, and four sovereigns
melt down into one ounce of gold ;
because, in short, they are the same
thing in different shapes, convertible
backwards and forwards at will from
one shape to another. Therefore gold
will always be worth �4 an ounce,
whether it be plentiful or scarce.


But the purchasing power of �4?its
?exchange value as against goods?may
vary to any extent, and will depend on
the comparative over or under produc-
tion of the two things.
The exchange value of the two things
(money v. goods) being what it is, if at
any time the supply of clothes, tools,
houses, books, exceeds the demand at
the price going, the supply of gold
.remaining the same, then prices of
these goods will fall, the goods will de-
preciate, the money appreciate. This
is what has happened ; the reason being
that while clothes, tools, houses, books
(and even wheat to a greater extent
than is commonly imagined) are pro-
ducts, capable of being multiplied
indefinitely without any increased
cost, measured in labour, and are con-
sequently being continually over-
produced by the struggling workers,
each in his own line trying to find a
market in his own line ; gold is a
mere extract, depending on a natural
-supply, which is limited, and it cannot
be indefinitely increased except at in-
creased cost, measured in labour.
My point is, that though the low
prices complained of are due to the fact
that goods are ? over-produced,? while
gold is not, still this comparative under-
production of gold is not the cause of
that trade depression and poverty of
work remuneration which is the real
trouble.
Trade depression and poverty of
work remuneration would not be alle-
viated by an over-production of gold,
as well as of goods. Prices would, in-
deed, in that case return to their old
level; but this would merely mean
that every transaction would be
reckoned in higher figures. The diffi-
culty of effecting any transactions at
all would remain as before, so long as
that ?effective demand,? which alone
calls forth production, fails, as it does
now, to represent the voice of human
wants calling for their satisfaction,
and is a mere artificially contracted
? market,? limited at one end by the
inability of the poor to buy all the
goods they want, and at the other by
the disinclination of the rich to spend
all the money they have.
So-called ?over-production?? with its
consequent low prices and diminished
earnings will continue, so long as natural
resources are made mere articles of
commerce, to be bought up and mono-
polised by the rich and used to extort
tribute from the workers ; and so long
as the creditor can refuse to accept
payment in goods or services, which
are all that the worker can really pay
in, and insist on money which the
worker cannot get, for the very reason
that the creditors? refusal to buy his
goods or services has destroyed their
money value.
I put forward these views with great
diffidence, thinking merely that I have
a sufficiently good case to ?bring into
court.?
