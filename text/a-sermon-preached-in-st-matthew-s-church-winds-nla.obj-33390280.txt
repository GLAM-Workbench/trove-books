PREACHED IN
ST. MATTHEW?S CHURCH, WINDSOR,
SUNDAY, DECEMBER Ist, 1839,
PREVIOUSLY TO THE OPENING OF A NEW WESLEYAN CHAPEL IN
THAT TOWN.

INTRODUCTION.
Tn� circumstances which led to the delivery, and subse-
quently to the publication, of the following Sermon, are
briefly these.
Previously to the opening of a new Wesleyan Chapel in
Windsor, printed invitations (of which a copy is subjoined)
were sent, not to Wesleyans only, but to members of the
Church of England, throughout the neighbourhood, soliciting
from such persons their presence and support on the occasion.
Viewing such a step, as a direct invitation to the members of
his congregation, to compromise their principles, and support
a separation which Churchmen think to be schismatic, the
Clergyman of the Church of England, in Windsor, addressed
the following discourse to his flock, on the Sunday before
the opening of the Chapel.
In reply to a personal application made to him by three
Wesleyan Ministers for the Manuscript of the Sermon, he
has deemed it expedient to commit it to the press, for
general circulation.
To the Notes in the Appendix the writer would invite
particular attention. They are of great importance in sub-
stantiating the assertions in the Sermon, and in showing how
much more prone are the modern Wesleyans to laud the
name of their founder, than to imitate his example, in not
separating from the Church.
Copy of a printed invitation addressed personally to Mem-
bers of the Church of England, in and near Windsor;
Sir, ?You arc respectfully informed that the new Wes-
leyan Chapel, Windsor, will be opened for Divine Worship,
on Tuesday, December 3rd, when your presence and support
are solicited.
The order of the Services follows.




A SERMON.
Romans, xvi, 17.
Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences
contrary to the doctrine which yc have learned; and avoid them.
Although the discussion of controversial subjects is not generally
the most profitable kind of pulpit ministration, yet circumstances
may occur which render the handling of such topics not only
useful, but absolutely necessary, to the full discharge of a faithful
ministry.
The Apostles, especially St. Paul, did not shrink from entering
upon such discussions, when he found them necessary to the well-
being of the churches to which he ministered. The Epistles to the
Corinthians, the Galatians, to Timothy, and to the Romans,- afford
ample illustration of the truth of this remark. Of those writings,
controversy forms a very large portion. The Corinthians were guilty
of introducing a spirit of party into the hallowed enclosure of the
Church. The Apostle therefore exhorts and entreats them (1 Cor. i.
10.) that there be no ? divisions ? among them (?schisms,? as it is in the
margin of your Bibles,) but that they all speak the same thing. The
Galatians erred in respect of the grand doctrine of justification by
faith, and into this error they had been led by attending to the
instructions of some self-appointed teachers, rather than by con-
tinuing in the apostolic doctrine and fellowship. This induced the
Apostle to enter, in a controversial manner, into the discussion of
the points at issue; and into a vindication of his own apostolic
authority to teach. The Roman Christians also to whom the text
was particularly addressed, had those among them who caused
divisions in the Church. These were teachers whose instructions
did not coincide with'those doctrines which the Holy Ghost had
induced the apostles to deliver, and who, in consequence, made
? divisions? in the body of professing Christians, by rending that
body, which ought to be whole and undivided, into small parties
or sections.
Unpleasant then as controversial subjects are in themselves, (and
indeed, my Brethren, to none is the discussion of them more painful
than to myself, as you may infer from the infrequency with which I
cuter upon them) yet having the example of the Apostles, nay, even
of the Lord Jesus Christ himself, in many of his discourses, before


me, I may not hesitate, at the call of duty, to depart a little from my
more usual course of pulpit instruction, and to beseech you, in the
words of the text, ?to mark them which cause divisions among you,
?and to avoid them.?
The exhortation which these words contain (which surely no one
will consider as less binding upon us, because it is softened into the
graceful form of an entreaty) seems to comprise two points of duty :
first, to ? mark ? those who cause divisions, or schisms from the
Church, that is, accurately to ascertain who they are, and then,
having ? marked? them, to ? avoid'' them.
But what is the true meaning of the term divisions or schisms, to
the forming of which, so much blame is attached in the Word of
God. This is easily seen by comparing the places in which the words
occur in the New Testament.
In 1 Cor. i. 10. we have these words?? Now I - beseech you,
Brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak
the same thing, and that there he no divisions (schisms in the
margin, schismata Greek) but that ye he perfectly joined together in
the same mind and in the same judgment.? In this place, as has
been well observed * ? the schism appears to have consisted in the
formation of religious parties which pretended to follow, one the
cause of St. Paul, and another that of Apollos??in other words, a
division or splitting into two, for such is the strict meaning of the
original word, of that body which ought to be but one.
In 1 Cor. xi. 18. ? I hear there be divisions (margin schisms,
Greek schismata) among you and I partly believe it,? the charge of
causing division is grounded upon the adoption of some new modes,
which some had wantonly introduced into the administration of the
Sacrament of the Lord?s Supper. In 1 Cor. xii. 25, ? that there
should be no schism in the body,? the offence of schism seems to have
conceded in breaking through that system of teaching, ministering,
and governing in the Church, which was originally appointed by the
Lord and his Apostles. Schism, therefore, may be defined to be an
open violation of the unity of the Church, ?when individuals assume
to themselves the power, cither of forming new communions, or of
instituting new rites, nr of creating a new ministry, in opposition to
such as have been established by the authority of the Apostles.
Such being schism, the humble Christian has only to mark who
they arc who have done, and arc doing, such things?who they arc
who separate from the Church, and thus violate its unity?who they
arc who form new denominations?who have separate sacraments,
who create a new ministry, not of apostolic ordination?and then will
he know, whom, according to the Word of God, contained in the
text, he is not to follow, not to sanction, not to support, hut to avoid.
And here, in order to show that the guilt of schism is incurred by
those members of the Church of England, (with other national
Churches I have now nothing to do) who causelessly separate from her
communion, it will be necessary to shew, however briefly, that the
��?<? Note in JVOjly an<! MnulV


Church of England is a true Church of Christ, for w ere she not so, it
would not be schism to separate from her.
To do this, it will be advisable to recur, for an instant, to the
antiquity and purity of our venerable Church.
Christianity was planted in the British Islands very soon after the
days of the Apostles. Without assuming, as some have done, that
St. Paul actually preached there, it is certain, from history, that
there was a Church in Britain before the end of the second Century.
British Bishops were present at some Councils on the Continent, in
the early part of the third Century, which shews not only that there
existed Churches then in Britain, but Churches with Episcopal
Government. The early Saxon invaders were Pagans, but Chris-
tianity was introduced among them by Augustine in 697, and soon
after prevailed throughout the whole Island. Here was the first
establishment of the Church of England, and from that day to the
present, through the course of twelve centuries, has the Church of
Christ in and of England existed, and diffused her blessings through
the length and breadth of the land. True it is that she partook, in
the middle ages, of the corruptions of Popery, as that system of error
by degrees intertwined itself with the purity of primitive doctrine :
but it is no less true, that at the glorious Reformation in the sixteenth
Century she shook off that yoke of bondage and of error; and taking
the revealed Word of God, in its true sense, as her sole rule of faith,
and guide for practice, she stood forth to the world, a reformed
Church, combining the highest antiquity with as near an approach
to primitive purity in doctrine and practice, as any Church in the
world.
And here I may correct an error into which some persons have
fallen, who from want of accurate information, have supposed that
the reformation itself was an act of schism, inasmuch as it was a
separation from the Church of Rome. But such was not the nature
of the British Reformation. It was a cleansing and purifying
process, by which the Church of England threw off the corruptions
with which the Church of Rome had infected her. There was the
Church of England before the Reformation, and there was the
Church of England still, after that event: unrefonned before,
reformed after, but the Church of England in both cases. And as
this purification of our national temple was effected by those who
alone had the authority to do it, the Archbishops and Bishops of the
Church, so was there no schism made in the body, nothing was done
which destroyed its character as the national Church. The Pope of
Rome himself, at that time, was not unwilling to sanction the
alteration, for he offered so to do, provided only ?his supremacy??
should stilly be acknowledged in England. This condition was
decidedly rejected, and then, and then only, did the separation take
place, and it was made, ?I pray you mark this fact?it was made
by the Romanists, in England, separating themselves from the
national Church, and not by our separating from them. Thus the
charge of separation lies against them, not against us. The Church
of England thus possesses all the requisites of a true Church, ?she


has antiquity?for she has existed nearly from apostolic times,?she
has purity of doctrine?for. taking the pure Word of God for her
standard and guide, she declares in the Sixth Article, that ? Holy
Scripture containeth all things necessary to Salvation, so that what-
soever is not read therein, or may he proved thereby, is not to be
required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of faith,
or be thought requisite or necessary to Salvation.? She possesses the
Sacraments of Christ?s appointing, and she confides the adminis-
tration of them to the hands of a ministry duly authorized to dispense
them, and to preach the Gospel, by virtue of a commission which they
derive, through an unbroken succession of bishops, from the Apostles,
and thus from the Lord Jesus Christ himself; for according to
Scripture, no man taketh, that is, ought to take this honor upon
himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.
11 is not, indeed, affirmed that the Church of England is perfect:
for what congregation of sinners on earth is so ? For perfection we
must look to the Church triumphant in Heaven, not to the Church
militant on earth. But in addition to what has been said, as to her
possessing the essentials of a true Church of Christ, I do verily
believe that within her communion, and drawing water from the
wells of Salvation which she affords, there are to be found a greater
number of truly pious people?of persons who are renewed by the
Holy Ghost, who love and serve the Lord Jesus Christ, and who are
humbly and successfully pressing onward in the path of holiness to
Heaven, than in any other denomination of Christians in the world.
The Church of England being thus shewn to be a true Church
of Christ?a holy temple built upon the foundation of the Apostles?
Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone: it is plain that
they who causelessly depart from her communion?who violate her
unity, by forming separate worshipping assemblies?who have
distinct Sacraments?who create a new ministry, not of apostolic
ordination, are guilty of the sin which the Scriptures call schism,
they are they who cause divisions?they are they whom the Apostles
call upon us not to support, or to cherish, but to mark them, in order
to avoid them.
Now, without the slightest feeling of animosity to the body?
without the most distant reference to individuals, 1 affirm thus
plainly and publicly, that the Wesleyan Methodists, in this commu-
nity, appear to me to have done, and to be yet doing, all this. They
have separated and are now separating, to all appearance more
widely than ever, from the Church of England. They associate in
separate congregations?they partake separately of the Sacraments?
they appoint to themselves teachers not of apostolic ordination?
lately they have obtained permission to celebrate marriages?the
Wesleyan preacher receives salary as Minister of a distinct deno-
mination, from the Colonial Government; and thus, to all intents
and purposes, they have become a body of separatists from the
apostolic Church of England, and this separation the Scriptures
designate as schism.
If, in the face of these notorious matters of fact, I hear it said, that


they ilo not separate, nor wish to <lo so, from the Chureh, 1 reply,
that in matters of evidence, and in such questions as arc to he deeided
hy it, actions will ever ho taken, and rightly so, as better evidence
than words?and their actions are against them?and I refer to the
words next following the text, and there observe that the very
persons who in the 17th verse are mentioned as causing divisions,
are in the 18th verse described, as they who by good words and fair
speeches deceive the hearts of the simple, and herein, I find an expla-
nation of such assertions.
The fact of such separation being established, it remains to
enquire whether it be causeless or not, ?and here the case appears to
me lo be particularly strong against them. Taking their name
from John Wesley, a Minister in the Church of England, and,
indeed, a truly excellent man, though irregular in his proceedings?
they depart, in practice, almost as widely from the course which he
enjoined, as from the order and discipline of the Church of England
herself. For it.is a notorious fact, that John Wesley not only would
not himself separate from the Church whose orders he possessed,
until, in his own emphatic words, ? his soul should separate from
his body but likewise he most earnestly enjoined others, to follow
his example. On an occasion of the greatest publicity, f in a
sermon preached by him on laying the foundation stone of the City-
road Chapel, in London?at a time when from his advanced age, 74,
we may be sure he delivered his matured opinions, he discussed the
question of separation or no separation?and in language the most
forcible, declared his own resolution to remain in connexion with
the Church until his dying day, and recommended others to imitate
his example after his departure. Jf then, in John Wesley?s day,
there existed in his opinion no cause why he or his followers should
create a schism by separating from the Church?if there was no
good reason for such a division, at a time when, confessedly, there
was less appearance of spiritual life in the Church than there is
now?how comes it, that in the improved circumstances of the
present day, that cause for separation should be found, which did
not exist then ? It is plain that the division they have made is a
causeless one, even in his opinion whose name they bear, and whom
they are too apt, in opposition to our Lord?s command, to call
their master.
But why, it may be asked, are these subjects brought forward
now, and why are they made the subject of pulpit discussion ?
Simply, because passing circumstances in this district render it
necessary. I have pointed out who they are that cause divisions
among us, and offences contrary to the apostolic doctrine which you,
as members of the Church of England, have learned. I have
chosen to do so now, because to you, that is, to many individuals
among you, to you though members of that Church, printed invi-
tations have been sent to give your presence and support at the
opening of a new Wesleyan Chapel, in Windsor, on Tuesday next.
* Sec Appendix, Note A.
t See Appendix, Note B.


If such invitations had been sent to those only who arc professedly
members of the Wesleyan body, it were a matter in which 1 of course
could have little concern, and upon which I should not have said
one word; but when they are circulated among you, my Brethren of
the Church of England,?when you are pointedly asked to support
that schismatic division, which as consistent members of the Church,
you must know and feel to be wrong?when it seems to be expected
that you will thus trifle with your principles,?it is time, indeed, for
the spiritual watchman to interfere, and not only to point out who
they are that cause divisions among us, and offences contrary to the
doctrine ye have learned, but also to exhort you, in obedience to the
apostolic command, to mark, and to avoid them. To you, as mem-
bers of the Church of England, these invitations should not have
been sent. Is it supposed that we have imbibed so much of the mis-
called liberal spirit of the present day, that we retain no fixed
principles of our own? Or is it imagined, that our principles are so
yielding and plastic, that we may be brought to act in plain
opposition to their dictates, simply because we are asked so to do ?
11 is not so, ?I am sure it is not, and if any think that it is, they do
us wrong. What right has any man to assume that we are so
ignorant as not to know our own principles, or that we have so little
conscience as not to obey them? We take them from the Sacred
Scriptures ?and, by God?s help, we will carry them out into action.
There we find that causeless separation from the professing Church
of Christ is designated schism?it is marked as a sin?we are com-
manded to avoid it?and we will avoid it, and neither sanction it by
our presence, nor support it by our contributions.
Finally, my Brethren, while we are firm supporters of that form
of doctrine and discipline, which, handed down to us from apostolic
times, has been sealed with the blood of our own fore-fathers in the
days of the Reformation: let us never forget that no mere adherence
even to the most Scriptural Church, no possession of external
privileges however great, will avail us any thing to the obtaining,
personally, of everlasting happiness, without that living faith in the
merits of the Saviour which converts the soul, aud spiritualizes the
affections, and purifies the life. Miserable indeed, will be the state
of those in the future world, who have no more of religion than mere
membership with some earthly Church. All Churches, all Ordi-
nances, all Scripture, all Sacraments, are only so many means and
assistances towards obtaining and promoting true goodness in the
soul. Let us then seek first for the indwelling of God?s Spirit in
our hearts, and for the growth of all the fruits of that Spirit in our
lives, and then let us, in strict adherence to the Apostles? doctrine
and fellowship, as taught in our beloved Church, prove ourselves
truly to be members of the one fold, under the one Shepherd, Jesus
Christ the Lord.?Amen.

EXTRACTS FROM WESLEY?S SERMONS.
Octavo Ed. London, Til's, 1830.
? Suppose you could not remain in the Church of England without
doing something which the Word of God forbids, or omitting some-
thing which the Word of God positively commands; if this were
the case (but, blessed he God, it is not) you ought to separate from
the Church of England. I will make the case my own. lam now,
and hare been from my youth, a Member and 3linister of the Church
of England. And I have no desire nor design to separate from it,
till my soul separates from my body?On Schism, Vol. 2. p. 197.
The two preceding pages are occupied in shewing the evil of
schism, understanding the word in the sense of ? a causeless sepa-
ration from a body of living Christians.? ?The passage is too long to
extract, but well deserves a careful perusal.
? For more than twenty years, this (separation from the Church)
never entered into the thoughts of those that were called Methodists.
But as more and more who had been brought up dissenters joined
with them, they brought in more and more prejudice against the
Church. In process of time, various circumstances concurred to
increase, and to confirm it. Many had forgotten, that we were all at
our first setting out determined members of the Established Church.
Yea, it was one of our original rules, that every member of our
society, should attend the Church and Sacrament, unless he had been
bred among Christians of some other denomination. Nineteen
years ago we considered this question, in our public conference at
Leeds, ? Whether the Methodists ought to separate from the
Church ?? And after a long and candid enquiry it was determined,
nemine contradicente, that it was not expedient for them to separate.
The reasons were set down at large: and they stand equally good at
this day.? ? Wesley?s Sermon on Attending the Church Service, p. 446,
ml. 2.
?Together with these helps, which are peculiar to their own
society, they (the Methodists) have all those which arc enjoyed in


common by tlic other members of the Church of England. Indeed
they have been long pressed to separate from it, to which they have
had temptations of every kind. But they cannot, they dare not , they
will not separate from it, while they can remain therein with a clear
conscience. It is true, if any sinful terms of communion were
imposed upon them, then they would he constrained to separate;
hut as this is not the case at present, we rejoice to continue therein.
? What then could God have done more for his vineyard ( Me-
thodism) which he had not done in it, with regard to spiritual helps ?
If it he said he could have made them a separate people like the
Moravian brethren, I answer, this would have been a direct contra-
diction to his whole design in raising them up; namely, to spread
scriptural religion throughout the land, among people of every deno-
mination leaving every one to hold his own opinion, and to follow
his own mode of worship. This could only be done effectually, by
leaving these tilings as they were, and endeavouring to leaven the
whole nation with that faith that worketh by love.?? Sermon on
God's Vineyard, vol. 2, p. 473.
The above quotations are sufficient to shew, not only, that it was
no part of Wesley?s plan that he or his followers should separate
from ? our own Church,? as he repeatedly calls the Church of
England (vol. 2, p. 452 vol. 2, p. 187 ?vol. 2, p. 388.) But fur-
ther, to prove that the present generation of Wcsleyans in becoming
a separate people as they have done, especially in this Colony, have
taken that step, which, in the opinion of him of whom they are, is
? a direct contradiction to God?s whole design in raising them up.?
Note B.
?It may throw considerable light on the nature of this work,* to
mention one circumstance more, attending the present revival of
religion, which I apprehend is quite peculiar to it. Ido not remem-
ber to have cither seen, heard, or read of any thing parallel. It
cannot he denied, that there have been several considerable revivals
of religion in England since the Reformation. But the generality
of the Englislrnation were little profited thereby: because they that
were the subjects of those revivals, teachers as well as people, soon
separated from the Established Church, and formed themselves into
a distinct sect So did the Presbyterians first, afterwards the
Independents, the Anabaptists, and the Quakers. And after this
was done, they did scarce any good, except to their own little body.
As they chose to separate from the Church, so the people remaining
therein separated from them, and generally contracted a -prejudice
He is speaking of the rise and progress of Methodism.


against them. Hut these were immensely the greater number; so
that by that unhappy separation, the hope of a general national
Reformation was totally cut olf.
? But it is not so in the present revival of religion. The Metho-
dists (so termed) know their calling. They weighed the matter at
lirst, and, upon mature deliberation, determined to continue in the
Church. Since that time they have not wanted temptations of
every kind to alter their resolution. They have heard abundance
said upon the subject, perhaps all that can be said. They have
read the writings of the most eminent pleaders for separation, both
in the last and present century. They have spent several days in a
general conference on this very question, ? Is it expedient (supposing,
not granting,'that it is lawful) to separate from the Established
Church ??? But still they could not sec sufficient cause to depart
from their first resolution. So that their fixed purpose is, let the
clergy or laity use them well or ill, by the grace of God to endure all
things, to hold on their even course, and to continue in the Church,
maugre men or devils, unless God permits them to be thrust out.
? Near twenty years ago, immediately after their solemn consul-
tation on the subject, a clergyman who had heard the whole, said
with great earnestness, ? In the name of God, let nothing move you
to recede from this resolution : God is with you of a truth; and so he
will be while you continue in the Church. But whenever the
Methodists leave the Church, God will leave them.? Lord, what is
man! In a few months after, Mr. Ingham himself left the Church,
and turned all the societies under his care, into congregations of
Independents. And what was the event ? The same that he had
foretold. They swiftly mouldered into nothing.?? Sermon on laying
the foundation of New Chapel, City Road, vol 1, p. 573-4.
After this testimony of John Wesley himself to Mr. Ingham?s
prophetic powers, we might have thought that Wcsleyans would
have held as oracular, the words, ? Whenever the Methodists leave
the Church, God will leave them.? But, as Wesley exclaims, Lord,
what is man!
? The Sermon thus proceeds,?? Some years after, a person of honor
told me, ?This is the peculiar glory of the Methodists. However
convenient it might be, they will not on any account or pretence
whatever, form a distinct sect or party. Let no one rob you of this
glorying??l trust none will aslong as I live. But the giver of this
advice entirely forgot, in a very short time, and has almost ever
since been laboring to form Independent congregations.
This has occasioned many to ask?? Why do you say, the Metho-
dists form no distinct party ? That they do not leave the Church ?
Are there not thousands of Methodists who have in fact left the
Church ? Who never attend the Church service P Never receive
the Lord?s Supper there ? Nay, who speak against tire Church, even
with bitterness, both in public and private ? Yea, who appoint and
frequent meetings for Divine Service, at the same hour ? How then
can you affirm that the Methodists do not leave the Church??
? 1 am glad of so public an opportunity of explaining this; in order


to which it will he necessary to look back some years. The Metho-
dists at Oxford were all one body, and, as it were, one soul; zealous
for the religion of the Bible, of the primitive Church, and, inconse-
quence, of the Church of England; us they believed it came nearer
the spiritual and primitive plan, than any other national Church on
earth.
? When ray brother and I returned from Georgia we were in the
same sentiments; and at that time, we and our friends were the only
persons to whom that innocent name was affixed. Thus far, there-
fore, all the Methodists were firm to the Church of England. But a
good man who met with us when we were at Oxford, while ho was
absent from us conversed much with Dissenters, andcontracted strong
prejudices against the Church, I mean Mr. Whitefield: and not long
after he totally separated from us. In some years, William Cud-
worth and several others separated from him, and turned Indepen-
dents: as did Mr. Maxlield and a few more, after separating from
us. Lastly, a school was set up near Trevecka in Wales; and almost
all who were educated there (except those that were ordained, and
some of them too) as they disclaimed all connexion with the Metho-
dists, so they disclaimed the Church also. Nay, they spoke of it
upon all occasions with exquisite bitterness and contempt.
?Now let every impartial person judge, whether we are accountable
for any of these. None of them have any manner of connexion with
the original Methodists. They are branches broken off from the
tree: if they break from the Church also, we are not accountable
for it.
? These, therefore, cannot make our glorying void, that we do not,
will not, form any separate sect, but from principle remain, what
we always have been, true Members of the Church of England /?
