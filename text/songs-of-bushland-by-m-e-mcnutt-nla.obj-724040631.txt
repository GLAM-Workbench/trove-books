My window gives on the dusty road.
Where the waggon creaks ’neath its groaning load,
And the children scamper, barefoot brown,
The sturdy bairns of the mining town;
But I glimpse in the distance the mountains blue
Splintered by gorges through and through,
And I crave with a longing akin to pain
For the dear lost joys of the bush again-
I long for the gorges dim and cool,
For the spray-wet rocks and the moss rimmed pool,
At the foot of the lonely waterfall
Where the creek slips down and the lyre birds call;
For the fronded ferns and the trailing vines,
And the bridal wreaths the clematis twines,
For the bushland ways that we used to know,
And the zest in life of the Long Ago.
I know that to-day in those circling hills,
Her golden treasure the wattle spills,
That petals are drifted like fragrant snow
Where heath bells swing and the snow blooms blow,
That wild birds sing thro’ the golden hours,
And bush and bracken are bright with flowers,
And humble homes in their midst are set
Like the rough little dwelling I can’t forget.
Was ever the trail that we found too long
When we trod it together with laugh and song?
Was ever task that we would not try
So we faced it together you and; I?
Do you blame me then, that I heartsick yearn
O’er the dear dead days that shall ne’er return?
They wonder I cling to the Bushland so,
But Ah! My Beloved, they do not know.


(Hay be sung to the air of “ The Merry Sunshine.
I love the songs of Bushland,
O’er dew-wet grasses borne
By whisp’ring winds when magpies
Flute carols to the morn;
When the jackass rocks with laughter
And the sivie’s sweet songs heard.
And gaily rings the glad note of
The joyous butcher bird.
Chorus:
I love their rippling music,
It frees my heart from care
To hear their wild notes ringing
On the sunny morning air.
The merry, merry birds, the merry birds
The bonnie bonnie birds for me.
The dear wild birds, our own bush birds,
The birds that I love, for me.
Oh! I have watched a playground
Where satin bower birds play;
I know a leafy gully
Where mocking lyre birds stray:
To me the wagtail chirrups,
For me the grey thrush trills,
And rich and splendid music
Hark! The song lark soaring spills.
I love the gay-hued parrots
In rainbow plumage dressed,
The flush of rose or crimson
Upon the robin’s breast;
The blue wren’s song by moonlight.
The bell bird’s chime at noon,
Hie shy reed warblers calling
Bes'dc the brown lagoon.


The Song of The Magpies.
In le rose glow of the dawning
I have heard the magpies’ note.
Heard their greeting to the morning,
From the lofty gum-trees float;
And I’ve heard them swiftly homing
Thro’ the gold and crimson west,
Thrill with song the dusky gloaming
As the sun king sank to rest.
There’s a ripple in their calling
They have caught from woodland nils
With their silver waters falling
Purple shadowed by the hills;
And the sunshine of the valleys
Lends its gladness to their notes
And the gurgle of the gullies
Is imprisoned in their throats.
Thoughts they bring of waving grasses
Rippling in the summer breeze,
You who call our bush birds songless.
What think you of songs like these?
Have you heard the magpies singing
In the tender hush of dawn,
While o’er mistv hill-tops winging
Yet another day was born.


Have you been the bushland’s lover?
Have you felt that glamour spell
That she winds and weaves for ever,
O’er the hearts that love her well?
Have you heard the magpies calling
In the ranges’ gathering gloom,
Where ’mid velvet darkness falling
Gums and wattles shed perfume.
Have you strained vour ears a-listemng
For their last far distant strain,
As in dusky robes star-glistening
Night came down o’er hill and plain?
Then perhaps you’ll own the sweetness
Of the magpie’s gurgling call,
For its memory ’twined completeness,
Is for bush folks after all.


A Mile Away from Home.
Beyond the hill-hid township
The gum-clad ranges rise,
By curving sweep and ramparts steep
They climb towards the skies;
Their blue and purple distance
Invites who will to roam;
But, ah! For me the foothills
A mile away from home.
There in the golden springtime
The sweet clematis showers
Thro’ trailing green, the rocks between,
Her wealth of starry flowers;
And buttons bright, and blue-bells
Through feathery grasses swing.
And jew'elled sprays of bossiaea sway
Like butterflies a-wing.
Beneath the golden wattle there
The buttercups laugh up,
As if to catch its fragrant breath
In every shining cup;
And dancing gum-tree blossoms
Nod to the blooms below,
And mingling hues of purple blues
The bonnie birds’-eyes show.
Sweet-scented briars and blackberries
Are banished from the town,
But all among these lower hills
Their blossoms sweet swing down
In sprays of thorn-edged beauty
To catch you as you pass;
And hawthorns, too, while laugh at you
Gay dandies in the grass.


The little people’s country
Of moss and lichens brown
Is all a-blow with elfin snow,
From snow-bush drifting down;
But fuchsia bells are rosy,
And flushed boronia stars,
And tawny gold dillwynia bold
Flings through her leafy bars.
Thro’ faerie dells epacris bells
Ring out their music sweet,
Where elfin orchids gather
Where lilac daisies meet;
Between the old grey boulders
Long-stemmed 'wild violets grow
So frail, so fair: and maiden-hair
And wee white fay-flowers show
The hardenbergia’s bolder,
It clambers, climbs, and creeps
O’er bare rock face, o’er roughest
Its regal purple sweeps;
And sarsparilla follows
To find clematis there —
And bow their heads before her,
That fairest of the fair.
And I go climbing with them,
Their chosen haunts I know,
But dearly as I love them
I leave them where they grow;
For I have known the heartache
That comes to those who roam;
Hence, doubly dear the foothills
A mile away from home.
place,


Oh! They talk of the songs of the birds o’er
Of the mavis and merle of the Old Country
And the song of the skylark soaring free
From the dew-wet lawns in the morning.
But give me the magpie’s gurgling call,
Like the prisoned song of a waterfall,
When jovous drifts from the gum-trees tall
Their matin song in the dawning.
They say that to hear thro’ the moonlit nigh
The nightingale is a dear delight,
But give me the ranges bathed in light
And the sound of the bell-birds singing—
The chime of their notes like silver bells
By fairies rung thro’ our Bushlard dells, —
And the love song sweet that the blue wren
Through the scrub and the saplings ringing
Oh! I bear no grudge to the birds o’er sea,
But the birds I love are the birds for me,
The wagtail spry with his “Chirrup-Chee”
On my window sill in the morning,
The dear old Jack with his brave “Ho-He,”
The silver-eye and his melody—
And it’s oh! for a forest harmony-
Australian birds in the dawning.


September.
Ihe voice of September is heard in the hills,
Her sunshine gold sparkles on runnels and rills,
And glints thro’ the gum leaves on green grass
below
With buttercups studded, with blue-bells a-blow;
Her breezes bring odours of pine and of gum
And sweet scent of wattles as lightly they come,
The}' frolic in orchards and teasing the bees
Shake glimmering showers of bloom from the trees
Ah! Fairy September, your magic in truth
Brings back for a season the glories of youth,
The grave old gum tells to his slim sapling son
The tales of Septembers long over and done,
Yet feels in himself the strong sap running free—
Who sways to wind music more graceful than he,
The King of the Bushland?—With pride he is filled
As birds ’mid his leaf glory twittering build.
September, your breath is like rare vintage pressed
From fruits of some Eden, we quaff it with zest
From flower-jewelled chalice of gold and of green,
And pledge you, September, as sweetheart and
queen,
The month of sweet sunshine to all you are dear,
September, the-longed-for, the Gem of the Year!


A Day of Rain.
The gums are tossing and twisting
Under a leaden sky,
To see themselves in the gold-brown pools
Leaf-lined, that beneath them lie.
The wind, that hath wantoned the night long,
Goes sobbing and shuddering past,
The hills are blurred to a soft pearl grey
By the rain veil over them cast.
And now the rain is like shimmering mist
Or a faerie fountain’s spray,
As a shining rift in the darksome clouds
Gleams silver against the grey
A truant sunbeam or two peep through
To be drowned in torrents of rain,
As deeper and denser than e’er before
Dark gather the clouds again.


Jewels.
Once I read of priceless jewels
Flashing with their hidden fire,
Pored entranced o’er tales of treasure
Gems a queen might well desire,
Blood red rubies warmly glowing,
Lustrous diamonds’ radiant lights,
Dusky pearls and glistening sapphires
Of the old Arabian Nights.
Often in my childish fancy
Did these gems my fingers lave
How I dreamed of finding treasure
Hidden in some darksome cave!
And my dreams have found fruition,
Jewels rich and rare have I,
But my casket’s just the Bushland
Spread beneath a sapphire sky.
Not the gems of all the Incas
With my treasure trove could vie,
Not such wealth of light and colour
Eastern legends can supply,
Never colour scheme like parrots
Grew upon the Persian looms,
yet did opal rival
Tl:e bee-eater’s wondrous plumes.


There’s the blue wren’s shining feathers
For my lapuslazuli,
There’s the flash of living emeralds
Busy green keets flying by;
Gorgeous the Australian roller
Garbed in pearl and amethyst,
Cockatoos and honeyeaters
Add their gold crowns to the list.
Topaz rare in silver setting
Drift across the evening sky,—
Grey galahs all rosy breasted
As in companies they fly.
Glows the robin’s breast like jacynth,
Fairer far than olivines
The gay plumage of kingfisher’s
Iridescent blues and greens.
But the best of all my jewels
Are their living gems of song
Stabbing to one’s heart with beauty,
In the memory lingering long;
Golden notes a throb with music.
Silver showers of melody,
Till the sights and sounds of Bushland
Merge in one grand harmony.


There’s a Gully I Know.
There’s a gully I know in the heart of the hills
In the depths of the gorge at the foot of Falls,
O’er green mossy ledges for ever it spills
Thro’ glistening fern fronds and cool dripping
The beauty it has of all virgin bush places,
So lonely, so lovely, by man yet untrod,
Cool waters, wild flower bells in soft dim-lit spaces,
Where no one has marred yet the handwork of
’Tis there midst green leafage where tree ferns
and grasses
Grow fastest and densest the lyre birds still dwell,
And oft thro’ the depths of those mossy morasses
Their notes of sweet mockery echo and swell,
They are denizens meet for such fair woodland
spaces,
Our beautiful mocking birds, graceful and shy,
Alas growing rare in more “Civilized” places
Where too oft for no sin but their beauty they
die.


Oh! When shall we learn as a nation to cherish
The God-given gifts that our bushlands afford?
Shall our wonderful birds thro’ our negligence
perish ?
Shall only the stranger their beauty applaud?
Tis’ not for the lyre birds alone I am pleading
There’s many a bird growing rarer so fast
That unless we extend the protection they’re
needing
’Tis but our Museums shall know them at last.
There’s a gully I know in the heart of the hills
In the depth of the gorge at the foot of the Fall,
O’er green mossy ledges for ever it spills
And still by its waters the mocking birds call.
Ah! Would that Australia held many such splendid
Retreats where our wild birds unfettered and free
Might find in such setting as Nature intended
Ere yet ’tis too late an unspoiled sanctuary.


Robin Redbreast.
Robin Robin Redbreast
From a rain wet spray
Piping forth your softest sweetest
Roundelay!
Robin Robin Redbreast
From your dusk dark wing
Shaking misty raindrops while yon
Sweetly sing!
Robin Robin Redbreast
Plaintive are your notes,
Longings keen for summer’s green
Thro’ them floats!
Pathos in their music
Pleading for the Spring,
Thus ’tis songs the saddest oft times
Sweetest ring!


Buttercups.
Like fettered sunbeams glowing
On slender shafts of green,
With soft Spring breezes blowing
Their shining heads between,
The buttercups are dancing
Adown the bushland ways,
With golden glory glancing
They’ve set the world ablaze.
A flood with sparkling sunshine,
Or drenched in crystal dew,
Each bloom’s a flowery gold mine
With treasure trove for you,
Oh brown bees, honey making
Where burnished petals part
There’s store of sweets for taking
In every golden heart.
In each curved petal holden
The sunshine gold is fast,
And Oh! the memories olden
They bring from out the past,
Gold dower of this and far lands—
The Little Children’s Flowers, —
We gathered them for garlands
In childhood’s golden hours.


And still thro’ sunny play hours
I hear the children shout,
“Who’ll come a-gathering wild flowers?
The buttercups are out?”
And "Who likes butter?’’ calling,
While weaving jewelled chains
’Mid gum tree shadows falling
In grassy bushland lanes.
Oh! Buttercups of Bushland,
You hold my heart in thrall
Your star gold gems the grassland
Where’er my footsteps fall.
And to you gayly growing
I bring this meed of praise
Fair buttercups a-blowing
Thro* glad October days.


Bossiaea.
As if a host of ladybirds
Had poised on jewelled wings,
Above the sand a golden band
You laugh you elfin things,
Brown golden flowers Bossiaea showers
While soft the Springtime sings.
For miles across the sunlit bush
Your glowing garlands wind,
You brownie folk in velvet cloaks
With sunshine satins lined,
By few is known the name you own,
Perchance they’ll sweeter find.
What would you like it altered to
Wee folk of bushland bowers
In rich hued browns of velvet gowns
Thro’ sweet September hours?
Ah! Not your name brings love and fame
But just your wonder flowers!


The Song of the Blue-Capped Wren.
The brown bees bold in the orchard old
Are wooing in sun and shade
The sweet Spring flowers, while in pearly showers
Is the bloom by the breezes sprayed.
Thro’ the tangled briars of the blackberry
’Gainst the fence wild grasses grow,
And its creamy blossoms o’er them nod
To the briar rose pink below.
My troubles pass as on gold flecked grass
I lazily lie at rest,
And watch a small blue-hooded wren flit past
On the wing to a briar-hid nest.
Hark! The air is a-quiver with melody,
Sweet, passionate, thrilling, strong,
Rising and falling in ecstasy,
A silver shower of song.
’Tis the Superb Warbler greeting his mate
Gold-brown with a silver breast
Mid tangle of grasses and briar and bloom
In their cleverly woven nest, —
Woven of grasses and fibres torn
From the bark of the gumtrees tall,
Roofed from the raindrops and snugly lined,
At the Springtide’s first faint call.
’Tis the Superb Warbler in sheen of blue!
See his quaintly perked tail! And now
The music drifts from his tiny throat
Like the spray from a shaken bough;
’Tis a love-song, passionate, pleading, sweet
For his songless brown mate at rest,
And we love you for it, Blue-Hooded Wren,
But your little mate loves you best.


Grey Rain.
Drifting down from the circling hills
You come, Grey Rain,with the odours sweet
That tell of the Bushland and Growing Things
Waking from slumber your kiss to meet;
And you bless with your weeping the thirsty land
That shall answer with blossoms and golden
grain,
And I list me your Wonder Song wildly sweet
Thro’ the slow swaying gum trees,
Grey Rain! Grey Rain!
Goodenia.
Like fairy gold in legends old
Far thrown across the heather
By pixies led goodenia spreads
Thro’ moody Autumn weather;
The banksia cones are honey sweet
The air to them beholden,
But ’neath them winds in leaves enshrined
Goodenia’s carpet golden.


January.
Now float o’er azure skies the fleecy clouds
Of Summer, and the bushland ways are sweet
With fragrance of those blossom freighted trees —
The Apples. Dianella at my feet
Gay threads on filmy stalks like cobwebs green
Her golden-centred, starry, azure flowers,
The fairest, frailest, latest flowers of all
Our Austral Summer’s blossom brimming store.
December.
When co-mes December with her drouth and heat
The Bush new beauties finds thro’ sultry days;
Where ti-tree makes a shady cool retreat
Glimmer white blossoms, while grevilleas blaze
In flame-like glory ’mongst the bracken green,
Shy thysanotus fashions pixie bowers,
And gleam like soft-lit stars the rocks between
The velvet misty hearted flannel flowers.


The red reeds rustle ever
In Salisbury Lagoon,
While to its rippling wavelets,
The slumbrous breezes croon,
A love song, quaint and tender,
Beneath a laughing moon,
And slow-swayed gum -trees listen
By Salisbury Lagoon.
The old Bush Road gum shaded
Goes wending winding by,
Across your glistening waters
With whirr of white wings fly
Wild birds that love the water
With pathos in their cry,
And softly through the tree tops
Those wooing breezes sigh.
I love you drenched in sunshine,
Or bathed in golden glow
When all the sunset splendour
Shines back from you below,
And o’er your gold-brown waters
With stately pride and slow.
Reflected ’mid the cloud tints
The Black Swans gliding go.
But ah! I love you better
Night cradled ’neath the moon,
With gleaming lights a-glimmer,
With opal tints and croon
Of waves and reeds, and wind-swayed
Tree tops’ and grasses’ tune,
For me so memory laden
Dear Salisbury Lagoon.


O'n, I have been to Sydney town,
And glad I was to go,
To leave the little mining camp
Where ev’ry face I know;
lo travel fast and travel far,
From household worries free,
To feel once more the glamour spell
That Sydney held for me.
Once more 1 saw the rainbow lights
That dance in Coogee Bay,
And thrilled to feel upon my face
The tang of salt sea spray;
I strayed through gardens sweet with bloom
Upon the harbour side,
And watched from cliffs of Watson’s Bay
The outbound vessels ride.
Once more I felt the magic spell
Night showers upon the sea,
When like some Caliph’s jewelled barge
Prosaic ferries be,
When water serpents writhe and coil,
And stars shine softly down,
And little waves swish sleepily
’Gainst mooring places brown.


Yet I grew sad in Sydney Town,
In spite of well-loved sea;
The little home in distant hills
Kept calling unto me,
There’s not its like in Sydney Town,
And city folk would smile
To see the place the heart of me
Cried out for all the while.
But I am back from Sydney Town,
And glad I am to be;
And every bush-bairn on the place
Has been to welcome me.
The birds make music all the day,
The stars shine softly down
On wind-stirred boughs of giant gums
And bark-roofed humpies brown.
I throw my curtain doorways wide,
Breathe deep of bush sweet air,
And lilt a song for happiness,
(No neighbours near to care.)
Tis primitive and rough and small,
Our little place, but —well
fis HOME, and even Sydney Town
For me has lost its spell.


The Laughing Jackass.
Have you ever heard a Jackass
From an old gum tree
Laughing “Ho-ho-ho” so hearty
And a “He-he-he”?
For of all the sounds of Bushland
Quite the dearest is to me
The Goburra’s ringing laughter
With its Ho-ho-he.
There’s a charm about the music
Of the magpies’ morning call,
Or the haunting notes of bell-birds
By a mountain waterfall;
But the wise old Kookaburra
Is the optimist for me,
For he sends dull care a-winging
With his Ho-ho-he.
As his laughter hails the morning
With hilarious tone,
Its music may be questioned
But its cheer we own,
And its wild and glad infection;
Who a pessimist could be
With an old brown jackass laughing
In an old gum tree?
His coat is somewhat homely
And he cannot build a nest,
But he does the things he can do
Never grieving o’er the rest;
It were well mayhap would humans,
Like the jackass in the tree
When their songs won’t ripple skywards
Try a Ho-ho-he.


In a blossomed cascade falling
Summer-sweet wistaria blooms
Drape my window, sense enthralling
Thro’ the cool old-fashioned rooms
Sweeps the clustered lilac’s fragrant
Scent, while whirl of spirea snow
Through my garden drifts, and vagrant
Sweet briars by the old fence blow.
Purple pansies lift their faces
Velvet soft, to light caress
Of October’s breeze; in places
Through the grassy wilderness,
Regal in their purple splendour,
Faintly blue or spotless white,
Iris petals, soft-fringed, tender
Gleam translucent in the light.
Early roses open shyly
Wealth of stocks their sweetness shed,
Brown bees come with tactics wily,
For the world of sweets out-spread.
Butterflies ne’er asking pardon,
Bright-winged flirt with all the flowers.
Ah! I love my Old World Garden,
Through October’s golden hours.


We wandered in the Bushland
This sweet October day,
And all the brown-winged butterflies
Came out to help us play.
We found the sweet clematis—
In starry wreaths it wound
Around the old grey free trunks,
Or sprayed the grassy ground.
A rich brown golden carpet
Beneath our feet was spread
By myriad bossiaea blossoms.
While wattles overhead
Threw out a grateful perfume,
And sarsaparilla twined
The fallen logs with beauty,
The tumbled gullies lined.
The shy wild Bushland violets
Grew coyly in the shade,
And on their long stalks slender
Australian bluebells swayed;
While all amongst the grasses
Were buttercups ablow,
With curving petals opening
Their golden hearts to show.


The buttons loved of wee folk
Their yellow heads a-toss,
Stood guard o’er lilac daisies
And faerie-blossom’d moss.
And old deserted shaft-mouths
Were draped in living green,
All starred with elfin orchids
Of softest lilac sheen.
Green orchids, too, were growing
By sweet epacris bells
That fairies ring by moonlight
Thro’ all the Bushland dells.
And clad in regal purple
The hardenbergia streamed,
While all throughout the Bushland
The wild white jasmine gleamed.
But all too soon the sunset’s
Gold vanguards in the west
Set sleepy flower-heads nodding;
As Bushland sank to rest
We turned us slowly homeward
To evensong of birds,
Our arms piled high with treasures
Our hearts too full for words,


The old house on the hillside
Shows brown thro’ green of gums,
For to its garden borders
The unspoiled Bushland comes,
And from its wide flung windows
’Gainst sapphire skies we view
In shine or shade the Bushland glade:
The same yet ever new.
Delights of dewy mornings,
Content of drowsy noon,
The magic of the Bushland
All silvered by the moon,
The rippling notes of Magpies,
The Kookaburra’s call,
The eerie note from Mo-poke’s throat
The old house knows them all.
Three children to the old house
That dearest title give
Of Home, —nor dream that anywhere
Is fairer spot to live;
Their days spill o’er with gladness
From common things distilled,
With work and play in wisest way
Their happy days are filled.


At night on starry splendours
Their drowsy eyelids close,
At morn to day-dawn beauty
They wake from sweet repose
They know the Bushland Secrets
Writ large in Nature’s book
In script for such as love her much
In tales for those who look.
And so unspoiled they’re growing
Remaining children still,
With music and with laughter
The old brown house they fill,
And oftentimes I’m dreaming,—
Ah! May my dreams come true,-
Too sweet to tell but all the spell
They hold old house of you.


Graceful willows swinging swaying
O’er the shining waters playing
In and out by mimic beaches,
Mossy banks and pebbly reaches,
Here, within their shadow cool
Lies a green-flecked, scarce-stirred pool,
And the waving willows green
Mirrored in its depths are seen.
Drift of leaves, new-budded, tender,
Draping every lithe limb slender,
Downward drooping to the stream,
While the sunbeams glint and gleam
Thro’ their wealth of leaves, and show
Tracery of light below,
Moving ever as the falling
Willows heed the breezes calling.
’Neath the green clad branches trailing
Children come their toy boats sailing,
Swinging on the boughs beneath,
Twisting many a willow wreath, —
Watch the willows keep the measure
To breeze tunes and share their pleasure
Ne’er to us seem willows “Weeping,’’
Rather under blue skies sweeping
Over water cool and clear
Do you bring us mem’ries dear; —


Sunny days we strayed from school,
Tempted by your shaded pool,
Splashed with all the truants’ glee,
(Paid next day the penalty");
Holidays when free from rule
With your twigs we played at school;
Picnic times when far and near
Came the folks to gather here; —
Long enough those days have flown
Shallower the creek has grown,
But with deeper drift I ween
Drooping willows drape the scene


Magpies.
With a murmuring sound like the song of the sea,
The wind in the tree tops is singing to me,
And sweetly there blends with its drowsy refrain
The magpies’ melodious magical strain,
That gushes and gurgles in cascades of glee,
And blends in a torrent of glad harmony.
Dear birds of the wildwood they wake me at dawn,
To skies pearl and rose-flushed, and sweet breath of
morn,
When cobweb linked grasses with dew-gems are
hung,
Oh then are their sweetest wild madrigals sung,
Their magical mystical musical calls
Like rivulets rippling o’er hid forest falls
But not in the dawnlight alone do they sing,
The pearls of their melody broadcast they fling,
When bushland is fretted with shadow and shine,
When storm clouds are lowering they do not repine,
And sweetly, so sweetly, their liquid refrain
Comes mingled with plashing of soft summer rain.
When daylight is fading and shadow’s ’gin fall,
And night winds are stirring, their eventide call
Comes softened by distance, a pixie refrain,
Elusive, appealing, and mingles again,
With the song of the wind in the swamp coolabahs
That lulls me to sleep ’neath the sky and the stars.


The Road to Torrington.
By garden and by orchard,
With willows drooping low,
Where river ripples murmur,
And fringed flag lilies grow,
Towards the hills for ever
Winds in and out and on
The road of all roads dearest,
The road to Torrington.
The quaint old red-roofed homestead
It passes on its way,
With slab huts still a-standmg
And lichened fences grey;
It sweeps thro’ station paddocks
Where grey-winged ibis throng,
And leaves them with a grumble
At being bound so long.
By mullock heaps and mine shafts
Deserted long ago,
And briar-hid old-world gardens
Where still the blossoms blow
On fruit trees gnarled and hoary,
It winds thro’ Stannum town
With daub and wattle dwellings
All weatherworn and brown.


Then Bark Hut Creek it crosses,
And often looking back
It climbs into the foothills,
A rugged old bush track,
But wild birds soar across it,
Neath waving boughs it strays
Thro’ wealth of wildwood beauty
By blossom burdened ways.
I’ve travelled it by dawnlight,
I’ve travelled it at noon,
And thro’ a land enchanted
By magic of the moon,
The dearest of all roadways
Howe’er so far I roam,
Since at its outback ending
Shine out the lights of Home.


A Bush School.
It nestles on the hill-side,
The little school I know,
Where gums and wattles whisper
Where flowers and bracken grow,
Where bush birds carol gaily
And sweetly comes the strain
Of happy children’s voices
In answer back again.
There brown-legged bairns go troopn
Rose-cheeked, frank-eyed and free
For school ideals are growing
More as they ought to be,
And teachers realising
Again and yet again,
Boys cannot all be scholars,
They may be honest men


The Inspector.
When I was quite a tiny tot
And went to school in town,
There sometimes came an awful man
Who wore an awful frown;
He gave us sums we could not dc>
And words we could not spell
And asked us for the height in feet
Of Popocatepel.
He got the teachers worried too
Till they were fit to cry.
And thus it was they never saw
The twinkle in his eye,
For strange to say this awful man
Had quite a kindly heart,
But then you see he had to play
The gruff Inspector’s part.
But times have changed since I was
For only yesterday
I saw a school examined in
The Good New Fashioned Way;
And some there were at number weak
And others could not spell,
But never one was asked the height
Of Popocatepel.
young,


The visitor in cheery tones
' Drew out the childrens’ best,
The fagged bush teacher wore a smile
And revelled in a rest.
The children were so frank and free
You’d think that they had known
That even the Inspector has
A little girl at home.
They showed him gaily how they made
Australia out of sand,
Discussed the birds and drew the flowers
Of this our sunny land,
They read,they wrote and ciphered too
With ne’er a trace.of strain,
And asked him as they smiled Good-Byes
“When shall you come again.”
They talk of Good Old Fashioned Ways,
And Good Old Fashioned rules,
Give me the Good New Fashioned Ways
The days of Happy Schools,
And give me when I’ve done my best
The new Inspection Ways
That give new life, new zest, new hopes
For work of coming days.


Sung to air, popular Irish song,“Cockles and Mussels.
The glamour, the glory,
Of song and of story,
Enhances the charms of the birds oversea, —
The lintie, the laverock,
The gay feathered peacock,
The sweet singing bulbul, —but dearer to me
The bush birds a-calling
’Mid wild gullies falling
Away thro’ the ranges that slope to the sea.
There, parrots low-flying
In splendour are vying,
And gladly out-gurgles the magpies’ dear song;
And sweet notes are ringing
Of ring-coachies singing,
And carol of butcher bird gladsome and strong
While lyre birds ne’er weary
Of mock songs, and cheery
The wise kookaburra laughs loudly and long.
Oh Birds of Australia,
In spite of our failure
With soft words to woo you our hearts you
enthrall,
But names, that when spoken,
Shall faintly betoken
The blaze of your beauty, the lure of your call
Shall child lips yet frame you,—
Right well shall they name you,
For language of lovers is sweetest of all.


Sweet October’s sunshine’s falling
Round our feet, while bush birds calling
Joyous notes from briar to tree
Weave a forest harmony,
And ’mid waving leaves and grass
Iridescent beetles pass.
Sarsaparilla’s shyly showing
Wind kissed petals blue a-blowing,
Violets tremble in the shade,
Fair clematis haunts the glade,
Guerdon of the sunshine gold
Buttercups sweet-hearted hold.
Hear the gay cicadas shrilling
All the air with sound a-fllling,
Butterflies with jewelled wings
Hover where the briar rose flings
From her petals’ pearl-pink sheen
Sundrenched scent o’er trailing green.
Hear the breezes softly sighing!
All too fast October’s flying,
Golden days’ twixt frosts and heat
All with mellow sunshine sweet
Shining e’en thro’ crystal showers
On a wonder wealth of flowers!


There’s a bushland nook I know
Where the wild birds call,
Where the stately brolgas dance
’Neath the blue gums tall,
Where the magpie’s liquid strain
Sweet as plash of summer rain
Mocks the little creek’s refrain
O’er the moss lined fall.
There in Eucalyptus bloom
Busy green keets swing,
There the dollar high in the air
Rocks on folded wing,
And a soaring splendid song
Sweet, harmonious, full and strong
From the tree tops echoes long
When the grey thrush sings.
Jewel ej-’ed and golden headed.
And with rainbow plumes,
The honey eater revels
In the banksia blooms,
Till the daylight fades and dies
Full of nestlings’ lullabies,
And a night bird plaintive cries
Thro’ the star-pierced gloom


There’s a little brown house in a small forest
clearing,
A house that is set in a tangle of bloom,
Where old fashioned flowers with their fragrance
endearing,
Nod right to the doors of the big living room,
From creeper twined chimneys of lath and of plaster
The blue smoke of log fires is lovingly curled,
One thought of it yet and my pulses beat faster
To me it is always the “Heart of the World.”
The wind in the tree-tops croons lovingly by it,
And mingles with music of magpie and wren,
The far busy world ways shall never pass nigh it,
But we who have loved it shall find it again.
Ah! how shall we value each everyday blessing
Who have in the maelstrom of sorrow been hurled
Ah! the wild joy we shall find in possessing
Health and our Home at the Heart of the World-


The Tawny Shouldered Frogmouth.
When the moonbeams clothe the gumtrees in a
beauty ever new,
When but soft night winds are stirring in the
grasses drenched with dew
When the old bush road’s enchanted and the bush
unreal seems,
Tike some country made of moon mist that you’ve
woven in your dreams,
Then from depth of deepest shadow comes the
weird unearthly call
Of the bird among our bush birds quite the ugliest
of all.
’Tis the Tawny Shouldered Frogmouth, with its
mouth so large and wide,
Yes, the awkward looking Frogmouth, in the day-
time sure to hide,
Huddling drowsy ’gainst the branches, like a piece
of freckled bark,
But he ventures forth at nightfall and his dreary
note we hark,
Oom, Oom, Oom, in long drawn sadness, like some
ghoul or goblin’s call,
Of the notes of all our bush birds quite the dreariest
of all.
Yet the Tawny Shouldered Frogmouth, tho’ he can-
not sing a note,
Builds poor nests and boasts no beauty, wears a
sombre speckled coat,
Though he sleeps through golden sunshine, and his
dreary message sends
Thro’ the moon enchanted bushland, is the best of
farmers’ friends,
That peculiar looking night bird with his eerie
haunting call,
Is perhaps among our bush birds the most useful of
them all.


Kookaburras.
Hark, what gay hilarious laughter
Echoes to each woodland rafter!
Kookaburras chuckling gaily
O’er new jokes discovered daily,
In one wild infectious chorus
Optimists of Bushland for us!
Peals their laughter with the morning,
Toil and trouble gaily scorning,
Quamt grey birds, but right courageous,
Finding food for mirth outrageous
Even in the darkest weather,
Chuckling, chortling altogether.


August.
The songs of bird lovers with tremulous trills
Resound thro’ the Bushland, while wattle blooms
From elfin gold goblets a sweet fragrance rare,
That sifts thro’ the sunshine far scenting the air;
The peach blossom’s blushing, the apple is pale,
To each has been whispered the same old time tale
By gay roving breezes, while sunbeams have kissed
The almond though veiled in a starry bloom mist.
As the famed Sleeping Beauty awakened from
dreams
At the kiss of the Prince, so in August it seems
The earth wakes from slumber and decks her anew
In green gleaming raiment bright glistening with
All broidered with fern fronds and soft moss and
flowers,
And worn thro’ the glamour of sunshiny hours,
For August in armour of sun woven gold,—
The hero who vanquished the grim Winter bold.


The King o’ The Frost.
Thro’ sapphire dusk of starry skies,
All noiselessly the Frost King hies,
Unseen, unto the world below
His elfin handiwork to show;
And where the brown earth shivering grieves
A glistening mantle for her weaves,
Of dewdrops fashions diamond dust
And shakes it with a sudden gust
Of wintry wind, across her dress
Of gleaming ice-blue loveliness,
For jewels icicles he’ll give,
Where w'ater sprites imprisoned live,
He lays his fingers on the rills,
And all their laughing music stills.
Then on our window panes I ween,
The Royal Artist’s touch is seen,
The world of white which he hath made
In duplicate for us arrayed,
Of hill and dale and mountain lake,
And forest trees, and thorny brake
But soon his busy reign is o’er
Till night shall spread her wings once more
The wonder web he wrought with toil
Becomes the saucy' sunbeams’ spoil;
Yet still he smiles in calm content,
To know in Arctic realms are pent
His towering strongholds, glistening, cold,
With all their wonders manifold,
Where even seas are frozen dumb,
And half the year ne’er knows the sun.


I sat in dewy dusk o’ dark,
And watched the little stars embark
Upon the sky sea overhead,
Dream ships, that fancies earth-ward
I dreamed a dream that came not true,
For oh!
Dear Heart,
I dreamed of you
I knelt within a sunlit room
All summer-sweet with scent of bloom,
I framed my Heart’s wish into prayer,
But ah! The angels could not spare
The boon I craved. It might not be.
You see,
Dear Heart,
I prayed for Thee.


Such a roguish laughing girlie,
Rounded limbs of healthy brown,
Tangled curls now shine now shadow,
Tumbling o’er her shoulders down;
Big brown eyes now wide with wonder
Dancing now with childish glee,
Wee Warm clinging hands that hold me
Lips that “Mother” frame for me.
Rippling trills of baby laughter,
Pitter pat of tiny feet,
Scattered toys in dear disorder,
Lisping language quaint and sweet.
You would like to see My Darling?
Think my household quiet seems?
Ah! my laughing Baby Brown Eyes,
Only comes to me in dreams.


Sweet Australian Wattle
In the bushland green,
Always in the springtime,
Are your blossoms seen.
Drifts of feathery fern leaves,
Fluff of gleaming gold,
Telling of the sunshine
Coming days shall hold.
Bush bairns rifle armfuls
Of your golden store,
While you, laughing, offer
Treasure-trove for more.
To the dust-dim city
Tossed and tired you come,
Child eyes wide with wonder,
Greet you in the slum.
In the lonely ranges,
How your sunny bloom
Flings o’er wild bush gullies,
Fragrant faint perfume!
When no longer children,
Far away we roam;
Always shall the wattle
Bring us thoughts of home.


Now silver-spreading Wattle
Her golden crown uplifts,
Where sunbeams pass o’er shining grass
Her faerie fragrance drifts.
With graceful bowing movements
Her golden tassels toss,
And breezes sing her Queen of Spring,
Her silver sheen across.
Those golden gleaming tassels
Of sunshine sheer were made
By Faerie Power, a springtide hour,
In Bushland’s greenest glade.
But elves distilled the moonlight,
And bright stars shimmering shine,
To form those sheaves of silvery leaves
The fairy gold to twine.
And Faerie Power is lent to her,
A subtle spell she throws,
O’er rippling rills and purple hills,
Her wafted whisper goes.
It sets the birds a-trilling
Their rippling shakes and turns,
And s-weeter sings the gurgling spring
’Mid feathery fronded-ferns.


SILVER WATTLE.
Her beauty makes the Bushland
A Fairy Land in truth,
Sets hearts athrill and memory fills
With glamour gleams of youth.
The Bushman, wattle-loving,
Draws down her scented gold,
And hurrying folk ’mid city smoke
Will pause where Wattle’s sold.
All hail, Australian Wattle,
Thou fitting emblem flower,
Of this fair land with golden sands,
And golden sunshine dower,
With Bushmen golden-hearted,
And gold grain harvest store,
And golden notes in bush-birds’ throats
Imprisoned evermore.


Winter means to English eyes
Leafless trees and clouded skies,
Winter in our sunny land
Treasures spills on every hand, —
Boon of sunshine laden hours,
Song of birds and store of flowers;
Hardenbergia’s purple sheen
Massed ’gainst tumbled logs is seen
Golden glow phebalium makes,
Rosy bells correa shakes,
Bronze and red and golden brown
Bossiaea lays her carpet down,
While styphelia’s shyly showing
Quaintest blossoms green a-growing,
And in lieu of falling snow
Snow bush star blooms softly blow,
While the sunshine o’er them weaves
Tapestry of dancing leaves.


Such a twitt’ring joyous measure
From the hedge of tangled briar,
Such a chirping call of pleasure
From the sapling’s slender spire,
Now one lonely note we hear,
Now a melody sweet and clear.
There are green clad little redtails
With their vests of ashen grey,
“Pretty!” “Pretty!” “I’m so pretty”?
Calling in their merry way;
And wee tits are chirping too
The sweet notes with which they woo.
There’s a silver-eye a-singing
Somewhere not too far away,
And an old Jack’s laughter ringing
Faintly comes while breezes play,
And from blue wrens’ lifted throats
Liquid golden music floats.
Ye who think our birds are songless
Seek an old briar smothered fence,
List their love notes sweetly ringing
Thro’ its tangles deep and dense;
Listen too, to magpies calling
’Mid the twilight shadows falling.
Then though ne’er you hear the Bell Birds
Rippling songs by fern fringed falls,
You will find that fraught with music
Are most all our Bush Birds’ calls, —
And you’ll well deserve it, too,
If the old Jack laughs at you.


July.
Chill July o’er hill tops straying,
Surly pranks are these you’re playing;
Moods you steal from Winter bold,
Rifle too the Springtide’s geld
How we pile our hearth fires high
Where your frosty fingers lie,
Then we wake to skies of blue
Fleecy cloudlets smiling through,
Surely sunny Spring is here
Say we, but you, listening hear,
And once more the cold rain grey
Shuddering shrouds the drear dead day
Winds of Winter scream and sigh,
Thus you mock us, false July.


August.
The light laughing breezes are rippling the wheat,
The mating birds wooing with melodies sweet,
With waters for mirror, the willows are seen
Admiring themselves in their mantles of green.
The air is sweet-scented, the Frost King has fled,
And fairies are dancing by mushrooms instead,
While elves set the flower bells gaily a-ring
To tell of the coming of August and Spring.
By myriads open the buds on the trees,
To join in the dance of the “Go as You Please”
The breezes are teaching, they glint and they
glanre,
Bow shyly, and flutt’ring retreat and advance,
With sunbeams for partners in uniforms bright,
But Alas, they will flirt with the moonbeams to-
night.
’Tis thus Austral August with sunshine, and song
Of birds and of breezes, goes gliding along.
She vanquished grim Winter with mischievous grai e
She flies thro’ the bushland with hurrying pace,
From coming September, her lover pursuing,
Who ne’er sees the face of the goddess he’s woo-


The Close of Day.
Sunset glow in the Western Sky,
Someone crooning a lullaby,
Lashes drooping o’er sleepy eyes
Bright and blue as summer skies,
Roseleaf cheek ’gainst the pillow pressed,
Dimpled mischievous hands at rest, —
Bab}' is falling asleep.
Someone moves with a gentle tread
Gathering the toys on the floor outspread,
Tiny garments are placed away,
Quiet succeeds the noise of day
Dreamland fairies their treasures bring,
Dreamland songsters their sweet songs sing,
Baby smiles in his sleep,
Moonlight rays through the curtain peep,
Bed clothes lie in a tangled heap,
Wee hands clutching the pillow tight,
Baby riding a dreamland sprite.
Someone breathing an earnest prayer,—
‘‘May My Treasure rest in The Father’s care
Whether he wake or sleep).”


Could you sail across the sky-sea in the silver shin-
ing moon—
Could you climb the summer rainbow you would be
there just as soon —
You would find, past Dream Dominions made of joy
and mist and tears,
The dear land where all the babies wait love’s long-
ings thro’ the years.
There are babies of all nations—babies . roguish,
grave, and gay;
Babes with sunny curls close clinging, babes with
blue eyes, brown, or grey;
But there’s ne’er a fretful baby, cross or crying,
sick or sad;
They have never learned in Skyland to be any-
thing but glad.
Thro’ the rifts in drifted cloudlets can those laugh-
ing babies look
At our earth outspread beneath them like a won-
drous picture-book,
As o’er fleecy clouds, soft-tinted, crowing merrily
they creep
Till thej r weary; then bright angels hush them with
a song to sleep.


By the ferry of the Moon Boat, all agleam with
crystal spray,
Come the cradles spun by star fays on the wondrous
Milky Way,
Till a mother-heart in Earthland craves a babv in
a prayer,
And earth’s angels waft the message up the shin-
ing rainbow stair.
Then a baby’s guardian angel, all unseen, with
wings outspread,
Brings her treasure, starry-cradled, to an Earth-
land cosy bed;
And when people of the Earthland cry, “Oh, see
the falling star”
’Tis a dear new baby’s cradle that is coming from
afar.
While the angel puts the baby softly on the snow-
white bed,
From the star that fell from heaven Love’s pure
light is gently shed;
Prince and peasant both have seen it where a new-
born baby lies,
And it stays to shine for ever right within the
mother’s eyes.
Could you climb the radiant rainbow past the land
o’ Dreams and Dew,
Or go sailing in the Moon Boat, you would Unci my
story true;
But without an expedition to the Land Where Babies
Are
You can watch them cradled coming—see the Love-
light from the Star.


My Next Door Neighbour.
I watched my next door neighbour
When summer skies were blue,
Through sheen of fairie fabrics
Her shining needle flew;
And hopes, and prayers, and kisses
Were stitched in elfin seams,
White fingers wove deft broid’ries
To tune of happy dreams.
With golden gleam the sunshine
Athwart her brown hair fell,
And in her shining eyes grew
The coming wonder’s spell.
My heart grew hot with envy,
Rebelliously I cried:
“Why should she know the glory
To me for ave denied?”
When autumn fields were golden,
When autumn leaves were brown
A laughing, star-eyed baby
Next door arrived in town:
But alien fingers robed it
From fairie garments store
And for my next door neighbour
Earth’s griefs, earth’s joys were


Emerald leaflets shyly showing
’Neath the stern old boulders growing
Shrinking from the outer glare
Feathery fronded maiden hair;
Nooks that ne’er the sunbeams find
With your tender green are lined,
Darksome clefts the rocks between
From your tracery of green
Take a lightness and a grace
Meet for fairies’ trysting place,
But your child loves find you there,
Fragile fretted maiden hair.
Yam Flowers.
All thro’ shady bushland places
Yamflowers lift quaint elfin faces,
Golden brown or lilac blowing
With their twisted beards a-flowing
Like some wayward pixie race
Chained for ever to one place.


“Ah, me, but times are sadly changed,
Since days of long ago,”
Says Grandma from her easy chair,
In flick’ring firelight glow;
“Maids then at home were well content,
To bake, and brew, and sew,
There was no gadding here and there
In days of long ago.”
The girl beside the window smiles,
’Twas but the other day,
That in a long-forgotten chest
She found a brave array
Of old-world gowns of silken sheen,
A painted fan, a shoe,
Some yellow, faded valentines
Old letters tied with blue.
“Nay; tell me, Gran, of Hallowe’en,
And all its mystic ways,
Of Harvest Home, and May Day dance,
In those same olden days,”
“Ah! lads were braw and lasses fair,
And summer twilights long”;
And all unconsciously she hums
A half forgotten song.
The girl beside the window smiles,
A well-known step she hears,
And grandmamma is lost in dreams
Of happy, bygone years.
He kissed her once. He kissed her twice,
I shall not tell you more;
The times have changed, but love remains
As in the days of yore.


She sat at the old piano,
A girl in a shabby gown,
And drifting in at the window
Came the hum of the busy town,
A hum that was lost in the music,
Of a wild bird’s note at dawn,
And swelled into forest chorus
A jubilant song of morn.
The ripple of childish laughter
Slipped forth from the ivory keys,
She swayed under blossomed branch!
To the song of the summer seas;
The passionate plaint of lovers
Was felt in the changing strain,
And died in the witching murmur
Of a lullaby refrain.
She sat at the old piano,
While the world outside went by,
And her music soared triumphant
As she reared her castles high,
And Art was to be her goddess
And hers the reward of Fame,
Yet the man at her side made music
Of her softly-spoken name.


A woman plays in the twilight
A theme in a minor key,
And the sadness that underlies it
Is her own life’s history,
For many may be the gifted,
But few to the heights attain
And Youth and Love far all Fame above
Were the price that she paid in vain.
Ah me for the disillusions,
The wisdom the long years bring,
The knowledge that enters only
By the gates of suffering;
Forgiveness there is for sinning
But know though your tired heart breaks
With bitter tears thro’ the weary years
Shall, you pay for your mistakes.


I met a little Puritan, —
’Twas at a Fancy Ball, —
Of silver grey her quaint array,
With soft white muslin shawl,
And ruffled cap where ne’er a scrap
Of colour showed at all;
The most demure of maids for sure
In all that festive hall
I asked the little Puritan
Might mine the pleasure be,
With serious face and old world grace
She dropped a curtesy,
A soft shy palm upon my arm
She placed most solemnly,
And in such guise with downcast eyes
She crossed the floor with me.
On fairy feet to music sweet
She danced and swung and swayed,
Her hair was tossed, her cap was lost,
Her eyes her joy betrayed;
Thro’ roguish curls a queen o’ girls
She laughed—a Mischief Maid.
I tell that little Puritan,—
She now belongs to me, —
I’m much afraid that she betra} ed
The trusts of history.
‘‘Fie, sir,” she cries, my Roguish Eyes,
“A Maid a Maid must be,
And ev’ry little Puritan
At heart was just like me.”


We dreamed of Love upon a day,
Our dreams made wondrous showing,
Albeit of stuffs too rich and rare
For winter winds a-bl owing;
For they were sown with jewels bright
With beauteous imagery be-dight
In gorgeous colourings blazoned bright,
On fabrics rich and glowing.
But Love has need for none o’ these,
Else were it naught but seeming,
And real Love transcends indeed
The dearest of our dreaming;
It takes the sombre hodden gray
The bitter sweet of every day,
And Lo, beside the common way
A radiant rainbow gleaming.


The Heroes of Gallipoli.
From mine and camp, from farm and town
From wayback stations riding down,
They came at hint of Britain’s needs,
The stalwart lads Australia breeds.
Dry eyed their women watched them go
With smiling lips that trembled so,
Despite their efforts to be gay,
The day our brave boys sailed away.
With catching breath and smarting eyes
We read of our dear lads’ emprize,
The veteran coolness they displayed,
The gallant dashing charge they made.
But ah! Alas! So young to die,
The stilled brave hearts to-day that lie
In alien graves across the sea,
The Heroes of Gallipoli.
We stay-at-homes have sought ’tis true
For some small service we might do,
But shall we dare to count the cost
Of war to us, when some have lost
Their all-in-all? No! No! I say
Glad our privilege is to pay
The utmost farthing we can give
To help our injured lads to live.
Think of the Red Cross Work! Think, too,
Of sacrifices made for you,
Then think—you will succeed no doubt —
Of something you can do without,
And pence or pounds, with willing mind
Give that our soldier boys may find
There’s every care and comfort free
To Heroes of Gallipoli.


(May be sung to the air, “Eternal Father.”)
Great God of Battles, Lord of all,
Before Thy throne we humbly fall,
And pray that Thou wilt guard and bless
Our far-off lads ’midst battle stress;
Dear Lord of Hosts, o’er them we yearn,
Grant, we beseech, their safe return.
Be with them, Lord, we humbly plead,
When comes their hour of direst need,
Spare them to see their homes again,
God guard and keep our splendid men,
They fight not, Lord, for gold nor greed,
Be with them in their hour of need.
Almighty God, incline Thine ear,
Our earnest supplication hear.
Be with the wounded, soothe their pain,
And bring them back to health again;
Our nurses and their labours bless,
Their work of love and tenderness.
Lord, with Thy consolation bless
The widow and the fatherless;
The aching hearts that mourn a son,
And all bereft of some loved one,
We know our heroes’ souls You keep,
But oh! dear Lord! bless those who weep


Lissom, straight and sturdy, blithe and debonair,
Swinging to the music of a martial air,
Through the crowds that cheered them though with
tear-wet eyes
Went our brown-clad heroes, flinging gay good-byes.
Slowly slipped the grey ships out beyond our ken,
Faces blurred and faded, died the shouting then,
As we turned us homewards, breathing everyone,
Prayers for someone’s safety—Husband, Lover,
Silently the grey ships anchor at the quay,
Ah! the pity of it, were you there to see,
Battered, bruised, and broken, sightless some alack,
With their shattered life hopes—Heroes coming
Ours the sacred duty—privilege indeed—
So to shape their future that they may not need,
Shall we stint our giving? Nay, we do not dare,
We have heard of Anzac and of Sari Bair.


She sat at the school piano,
She steadied each trembling nerve
As she crashed into “Pack Your Troubles’
With abandon and zip and verve;
And the music-hall air rang boldly
If the bass was only a vamp,
While all through the mighty building
Rose a rhythmical tramp, tramp, tramp.
She shouted the rollicking chorus,
Leading the childish din;
No time for “soft sweet singing”
When the Zeppelin raids begin.
As the wee folk stepped out bravely,
Though her face was white with strain,
She slid from the “Smile, Smile!” music
To a rousing March refrain.
She was only a young girl teacher
On a pittance or so a year,
And her name has never been told us,
So I cannot give it you here.
But we’ll tell to our children’s children
Of the girl who herself afraid
Played every wee tot to' safety
In the height of a famous raid.


Harbingers of Hope.
The grey thrush flutes a silver song,
The bushland ways are blossom sweet,
The skies are blue above my head,
The wild flowers nod about my feet;
And dearest of these bushland joys
The magpies raise their liquid lay.
Ah! Such my happy peaceful world,
But he I love is far away.
The blue wren sings a love song sweet,
The sunbeams on his plumage glance,
My thoughts go drifting as I knit
To far-off France, somewhere in France,
Where nightingales by old chateaux
On summer nights were wont to sing,
Whence frightened birds have long since fled
With startled cries on hurrying wing.
To think that in the world so fair
Such sad upheaval there should be!
Yet softly on my aching heart
There steals the bush birds’ minstrelsy.
And to their mingling evensong,
When slanting shadows far have grown,
I join my earnest prayers for him, —
The soldier who is all my own.


Two Days.
The sunshine of a perfect day
Danced sapphire shod upon the bay,
Great hearted roses passion red
Their lavish boon of sweetness shed,
Till sunshine laden breezes came
A-throb with scent, —but all the same
Full cold and drear the world to me,
For you, Dear Heart, went forth to sea.
The sullen wreaths of rain mist cold
Did all the shiv’ring land enfold,
The wild winds lashed the angry bay,
One whirl of foam and waters grey,
And strewed the beach with weeds and wrack
Beneath a sky with storm clouds black;
But ah! The joy of life to me,
For you, Dear Heart, came safe from sea


The Boys Who Blazed The Track
Beloved Homeland! Fair and free Australia,
Thy very name makes music in our hearts,
And if we wander far from thee in exile,
One breath of wattle and the hot tear starts;
We close our eyes and see the gum-clad ranges,
The paddocks tremulous with golden grain,
Almost we sense the sweet wild bushland fragrance
Of growing things through drifting mountain raiu.
Thus our lads loved thee, —and the rhythmic music
Of marching feet was heard from sea to sea,
Our boy defenders, proudly, tensely learning
The ways of arms that they might keep thee free-
Ah! They had much to lose, those youthful
dreamers,
Life stretched full fair before their radiant eyes,
But they held Life itself less worth than Honour,
And forth the)’ fared upon the Great Emprize.
Now some lie sleeping in the silent ranges,
And some upon Hie blood-soaked fields of France,
But those remaining call across the ocean
For Re-inforcements for the Great Advance;
Full brightly burned the flame of their devotion,
It lit a torch that has inspired the World!
Ah! Not in vain those brave and loyal spirits
Into War’s seething maelstrom have been hurled.
Thou shalt not lie, dear land, a prey to strangers,
Outraged, and quivering ’neath the alien’s lash
Whilst thy fair cities tumble into ruins
And smoking shells on hearth and homestead
crash;
Not all the hearts that love thee have responded,
There have been reasons that have held them back,
But they have heard the call and they are ready
To follow now “The Bovs who Blazed the Track,”


Stalwart dams they ran by in the mammoth station
paddocks,
Where the roller circles, and the grey-winged ibis
throng;
Heard the dingoes howling in the lonesome mid-
night watches,
And the wonder music of the magpies’ morning
song;
Romped across the tussock grass and gambolled in
the sunshine,
Snuggled by their mothers through the frost clear
Southern nights,
While in friendly fashion looked the great Cross
down upon them,
With its five points twinkling midst a host of
lesser lights.
Whether born and bred amongst the blue New
England ranges,
Or in Never Never land, of far-flung saltbush
plains,
Sunny smiling Queensland, or slopes of cold
Monaro,
Ran the blood of gallant sires in all their bound-
ing veins;
Fragrant in their nostrils was the breath of gum
and wattle, •
Do they now in foreign lands across the tossing
foam,
Fancy thro' the darkness they can hear the mo-poke
calling,
Stir in restless slumber at some fleeting dream
of home?


Puzzled at the strangeness of the blow that Fate
has dealt them,
War to them a nightmare they can never under-
stand,
Tugging up the great guns, stiff, and sore and
weary,
Thro’ the snows of Somewhere or the scorching
desert sand,
Plunging gamely onward where the cruel shells are
screaming,
’Midst the crack of rifles and the bullets zip and
thud,
Winning fame and glory all unknowing and un-
caring
Craving but the homestead for those leagues of
Flanders mud.




FOR THE LITTLE ONES
tg4?


Colour Rhymes.
Red apples up the orchard,
Red berries down the lane,
Red roses tapping gently
Upon my window pane;
Red poppies in the cornfield
Red down on robin’s breast,
And red clouds when at nightfall
The sun sinks in the West:
Red fire to keep us cosy
When summer’s warmth we miss,
But best of all red rosy lips
When baby wants a kiss.
BLUE.
Bluebells on grassy hill-sides
Beneath the gum trees tall, .
Forget-me-nots and cornflowers
Beside the garden wall;
Blue seas in summer sunshine
Reflecting bright blue skies,
And blue as skies or waters
Our laughing baby’s eyes.
YELLOW.
Yellow cream in cold old dairies,
Yellow butter, yellow cheese;
Yellow pears,in shad)' orchards
Better still the children please
Yellow down on tiny ducklings,
Yellow sunflowers straight and tall,
Yellow curls on baby’s forehead,
Soft and sunnv best of all.


Her Reason.
“What makes you all love Mother so?’’
The teacher asked with face aglow;
“Because she’s good,’’ from sturdy Ned,
“Because she’s pretty,” Thelma said,
“She loves us so,” cried gypsy Nell,
The winsome bairn all loved so well,
“She makes you sorry when you’re bad,”
Said tiresome Hal, our “naughty” lad;
But Baby Mave turned big brown eyes
Upon them all in shocked surprise,
To teacher turned confidingly,
“It’s ’cause she’s Mother, don’t you see


Baby’s Bed Time.
Soft as down and white as snow,
Faerie sheets and pillow low,
Wee warm blankets deftly spread,
Cosy nest ’tis “Baby’s Bed.”
Lisping words from baby lips
Close pressed rosy finger tips,
“Father keep me in Thy care’’?
Mother prompting "Baby’s Prayer
Witching music sweet and low,
Lullabies of long ago,
Silken lashes droop ere long,
That was “Baby’s Slumber Song.
Happy sleep that wee folk know,
Noise all hushed and lights turned
All a mother’s heart felt bliss
Thrills thro’ “Baby’s Good Night
Kiss.’’


The Little Breeze.
A soft shy breeze came thro’ the trees
Mid scent of flowers and boom of bees
And tossed into a sick child’s room
A sunbeam and a sweet perfume.
He. kissed the flowers and tossed the curls
Of rosy little laughing girls,
He dried some washing sweet and white
And helped a schoolboy sail a kite.
He was not very big nor strong
And yet he helped the world along;
The sick child smiled to smell the flowers*
The clothes were dry before the showers,
The kite flew high, loud laughed the boy
And sang the little breeze for joy.


What are shells on sunlit beaches?
Are they blossoms from the sea?
Rainbow-tinted, fragile fashioned
Can they Sea Kings’ jewels be?
Nay, more wondrous far than either
Are those Jewels from the foam
Each soft-tinted tiniest shell’s been
Some wee creature’s faerie home.
A Sponge’s Memories.
To-day I splash in Baby’s bath,
While loud he laughs in glee;
But once I lived in Fairyland
Below the shining sea.
Like quaintest rainbow-coloured plan
Our wondrous people be,
I splash to-day in Baby’s bath
I dream of rocks and sea.


When you feel all tickly prickly,
And you cannot go to sleep;
When you’ve got to keep on crying,
And the clothes are in a heap,
Just you call the Sandman softly
But don’t peep at him, he’s shy,—
And he’ll sing you off to the drowsy
Dreams
With his Bye-Lo-By.
The Sandman’s weeny teeny,
And his coat is russet brown,
He shakes the silver slumber sand
On all the eyes in town;
If you hear a pitter patter
That’s the little sandman’s feet,
And he’ll sing you off to Bye-a-bye-a-by
With his music sweet.
He comes from Gleaming Dreaming
In the drowsy land o’ sleep,
And he sets you winking blinking
Like the little stars a-peep;
So just close those wise eyes gently,
If you’d grow well stretch, stretch out,
And its off away to Bye-a-bye-a-by,
Till the sun shines out.
Land o’


The Quarrel.
Two little maidens fell out one day,
Angrily turned from each other’s way;
Such little friends they had been you see,
Soon they were sorry as they could be.
Neither was ready to own the blame,
Daily the trouble still worse became.
School lessons suffered and so one day
Two. little girls were debarred from play.
Someone who came to the schoolroom door,
Smiled, as if pleased, at the sight she saw,
Ripples of gold mixed with curls of brown,
Two little heads on the desk laid down,
Tiptoed away with a radiant face,
Leaving them happy in their disgrace.


Jack Frost and The Buds.
Old Jack Frost, the wee "buds teasing,
Cried, “Come out, nor fear a freezing,
Doff your cosy coats of brown,
I’m just off to London Town.”
But Spring Fairies whispered, “Wait,
When you’re nipped ’twill be too late
To regret our kindly caution,
Spoiled dead leaves will be your portion
Laughed most all the wee buds gay,
“Thank you, Jack, we’d rather stay
In our coverings cuddling tight
Till we’re sure you’re out of sight,
Till the birds and breezes sing
How you ran away from Spring.”
Very cross was Jack and surly,
Soon some foolish buds too early
From their wrappings peeping out
Did he sharply put to rout
With his cruel fingers cold,
As the fairies had foretold.
But the wise wee buds who’d waited,
As the fairies had dictated,
Heard the sunshine laden breeze
Calling to them thro’ the trees,
“Now Spring’s here,” and soon were seen
All unpacked their leaflets green.


Our Baby.
Dimpled fists and a roguish mouth,
And a breath that is sweeter than winds
South,
Laughing eyes and a rounded chin,
Cheeks that snuggle the dimples in,
Clinging tendrils of silky hair,
I wonder how could the angels spare
Our Baby.
Ten little kissable crumpled toes,
And an adorable scrap of a nose,
Chubby limbs and a rose leaf chin,
Ears that the angels whisper in,
Making him smile as he lies asleep
Knowing their vigil o’er him they keep,
Our Baby.
of the


Wattle.
The wattle is brave, for its golden bloom
Is here ere the chill winds go,
The wattle is sweet, with a bushland scent
That ere we are near we know.
The wattle is shaking its fairy fluff,
Then list what it has to say,
It’s telling the birds, and the bees, and us
That summer is on its way.
The wattle besides is Australia’s flower,
Then let us be loyal and true,
Each turning to others a sunny face
Be welcome, dear wattle, like you.


Flower Song.
(May be sung to the air, 4 ‘Castles In The Air.”)
I love the wild bush flowers ’neath the forest tree
that grow
Thro* the golden days o’ Springtime when the wattle
blossoms blow,
When each fallen log you find is by hardenbergia
twined
And bossiaea’s velvet bonnets are with sunshine
satin lined.
The shy wild violets hide every old grey rock beside,
And the eager eyes of wee folk have the buttercups
espied,
While goodenia’s goblets gold crystal dew for
fairies hold,
And the time o’ day in Bushland is by docks o
thistle told.


A Song of The Bush.
(May be sung to the air,
‘ ‘ 0 Whistle and I’ll Come to You, My Lad. ”)
My garden has hollyhocks all in a row
And sheaves of tall lilies as white as the snow
But give me the bush where the flannel flowers
swing
And crimson and golden the Christmas bells ring.
Chorus:
I love the dear bush where the trees meet o’er head,
And carpets of blue bells and buttons are spread,
Where orchids are scattered and violets blue
And Christmas bush blazes for me and for vou.
Oh! Gaily the gum trees are scattering again
The quaintest of head gear for little brown men,
For still in the Bushland the fairies abide,
And they who best love theifit shall find where they
