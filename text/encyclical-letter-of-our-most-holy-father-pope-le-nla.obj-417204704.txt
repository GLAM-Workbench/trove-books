To our Venerable Brethren, all the Patriarchs, Primates,
Archbishops, and Bishops of the Catholic World, in
Grace and Communion with the Apostolic See.
POPE EEO. XIII.
Venerable Brethren, Health and Apostolic
Benediction :
God of benign Providence, Who in the adorable
designs of His love at first elevated the human race
to the fellowship of the Divine nature, and afterwards
delivered it from universal guilt and ruin, restoring
it to its primitive dignity, has for the same reason
bestowed upon man a splendid gift and safeguard —
making known to him, by supernatural means, the
hidden mysteries of His Divinity, His wisdom and
His mercy. For although in Divine Revelation there
are contained some things which are not beyond the
reach of unassisted reason, and which are made the
objects of such Revelation in order “ that all may
come to know them with facility, certainty, and
safety from error, yet it is not on this account that
supernatural Revelation can be said to be absolutely
necessary; it is necessary because God has destined man
to a supernatural end.” (l) This supernatural reve-
lation, according to the belief of the universal Church,
is contained both in unwritten Tradition, and in
written Books, which are therefore called sacred and
canonical because, “ being written under the inspira-
tion of the Holy Ghost, they have God for their
author, and as such have been delivered to the
Church.” (2) This belief has been, perpetually held
and professed by the Church in regard to the Books
of both Testaments ; and there are well-known docu-
ments of the gravest kind, coming down to us from
(1) Cone. Vat. ness. iii. cap. ii. de revel.

the earliest times, which proclaim that God, Who
spoke first by the Prophets, then by His own month,
and lastly by the Apostles, gave also to us the
Canonical Scriptures (1), and that these are His own
oracles and words (2) —a communication, written by
our Heavenly Father, and transmitted by the sacred
writers to the human race in its pilgrimage so far
from its heavenly country. (3) If, then, such and so
great is the excellence and the dignity of the Scrip-
tures, that God Himself is their author, and that
they treat of God’s marvellous mysteries, counsels
and works, it follows that the branch of sacred
Theology which is concerned with the defence and
elucidation of these divine Books must be excellent
and useful in the highest degree.
Now we, who by the help of God, and not without
fruit, have by frequent Letters and exhortation
endeavoured to promote other branches of study
which seemed capable of advancing the glory of God
and contributing to the salvation of souls, have for
a long time cherished the desire to give an impulse
to the noble science of Holy Scripture, and to impart
to Scripture study a direction suitable to the needs
of the present day. The solicitude of the Apostolic
office naturally urges, and even compels us, not only
to desire that this grand source of Catholic revelation
should be made safely and abundantly accessible to
the flock of Jesus Christ, but also not to suffer any
attempt to defile or corrupt it, either on the part of
those who impiously and openly assail the Scriptures,
or of those who are led astray into fallacious and
imprudent novelties. We are not ignorant, indeed,
Venerable Brethren, that there are not a few
Catholics, men of talent and learning, who do devote

themselves with ardour to the defence of the sacred
writings and to making them better known and
understood. But whilst giving to these the com-
mendation they deserve, we cannot but earnestly
exhort others also, from whose skill and piety and
learning we have a right to expect good results, to
give themselves to the same most praiseworthy work.
It is our wish and fervent desire to see an increase in
the number of the approved and persevering labourers
in the cause of Holy Scripture ; and more especially
that those whom Divine Grace has called to Holy
Orders, should, day-by-day, as their state demands,
display greater diligence and industry in reading,
meditating, and explaining it.
Holy Scripture most Profitable to Doctrine and
Morality.
Among the reasons for which the Holy Scripture
is so worthy of commendation—in addition to its own
excellence and to the homage which we owe to God’s
Word—the chief of all is, the innumerable benefits
of which it is the source ; according to the infallible
testimony of the Holy Ghost Himself, who says :
‘ £ All Scripture, inspired of God, is profitable to
teach, to reprove, to correct, to instruct in justice,
that the man of God may be perfect, furnished to
every good work.” (1) That such was the purpose
of God in giving the Scripture to men is shown by
the example of Christ our Lord and of His Apostles.
For He Himself Who “ obtained authority by
miracles, merited belief by authority, and by belief
drew to Himself the multitude” (2), was accustomed,
in the exercise of His Divine Mission, to appeal to
the Scriptures. He uses them at times to prove
that He is sent by God, and is God Himself. From
(1) 2 Tim. iii., 16-17.
(2) S. Aug. de util. cred. xiv. 32.


them He cites instructions for His disciples and
confirmation of His doctrine. He vindicates them
from the calumnies of objectors ; he quotes them
against Sadducees and Pharisees, and retorts from
them upon Satan himself when he dares to tempt
Him. At the close of His life His utterances are
from Holy Scripture, and it is the Scripture that He
expounds to His disciples after His resurrection,
until He ascends to the glory of His Father. Faith-
ful to His precepts, the Apostles, although He
Himself granted “ signs and wonders to be done by
their hands ” ( 1) nevertheless used with the greatest
effect the sacred writings, in order to persuade the
nations everywhere of the wisdom of Christianity, to
conquer the obstinacy of the Jews, and to suppress
the outbreak of heresy. This is plainly seen in their
discourses, especially in those of St. Peter : these
were often little less than a series of citations from
the Old Testament making in the strongest manner
for the new dispensation. We find the same thing
in the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. John and in
the Catholic Epistles ; and most remarkably of all
in the words of him who “ boasts that he learned the
law at the feet of Gamaliel in order that, being-
armed with spiritual weapons, he might afterwards
say with confidence, ‘ The arms of our warfare are
not carnal but mighty unto God.’ ” (2) Let all,
therefore, especially the aspirants of the ecclesiastical
army, understand how deeply the sacred Books
should be esteemed, and with what eagerness and
reverence they should approach this great arsenal of
heavenly arms. For those whose duty it is to handle
Catholic doctrine before the learned or the unlearned
will nowhere find more ample matter or more abun-
dant exhortation, whether on the subject of God, the
supreme Good and the all-perfect Being, or of the
(1) Act xiv., 3.
(2) St. Hieron. de stud. Script, ad Paulin, ep. liii. 3.


works which display His glory and His love. No-
where is there anything more full or more express
on the subject of the Saviour of the world than is to
be found in the whole text of the Bible. As St.
Jerome says, “ To be ignorant of the Scripture is not
to know Christ.” (1). Tn its pages His Image stands
out, living and breathing; diffusing everywhere
around consolation in trouble, encouragement to
virtue and attraction to the love of God. And as to
the Church, her institutions, her nature, her office,
and her gifts, we find in Holy Scripture so many
references and so many ready and convincing argu-
ments, that as St. Jerome again most truly says:
A man who is well grounded in the testimonies of
the Scripture is the bulwark of the Church.” (2)
And if we come to morality and discipline, an
apostolic man finds in the sacred writings abundant
and excellent assistance ; most holy precepts, gentle
and strong exhortation, splendid examples of every
virtue, and finally the promise of eternal reward and
the threat of eternal punishment, uttered in terms of
solemn import, in God's name and in God’s own
words.
And it is this peculiar and singular power of Holy
Scripture, arising from the inspiration of the Holy
Ghost, which gives authority to the sacred orator,
fills him with apostolic liberty of speech, and com-
municates force and power to his eloquence. For
those who infuse into their efforts the spirit and
strength of the Word of God, speak “ not in word
only but in pow 7 er also, and in the Holy Ghost, and
in much fulness.” (3) Hence those preachers are
foolish and improvident who, in speaking of religion
and proclaiming the things of God, use no words but
those of human science and human prudence, trusting
to their own reasonings rather than to those of God.
(I) In Imi am ProL

(3) i Thess. i., 5.


Their discourses may be brilliant and fine, but they
must be feeble and they must be cold, for they are
without the fire of the utterance of God (l) and they
must fall far short of that mighty power which the
speech of God possesses : “ for the Word of God is
living and effectual, and more piercing than any
two-edged sword ; and reaching unto the division of
the soul and the spirit.” (2) But, indeed, all those
who have a right to give counsel are agreed that there
is in the Holy Scripture an eloquence that is wonder-
fully varied and rich, and worthy of great themes.
This St. Augustine thoroughly understood and has
abundantly set forth. (3) This also is confirmed by
the best preachers of all ages, who have gratefully
acknowledged that they owed their repute chiefly to
the assiduous use of the Bible, and to devout medita-
tion on its pages.
The Holy Fathers well knew all this by practical
experience, and they never cease to extol the sacred
Scripture and its fruits. In innumerable passages of
their writings we find them applying to it such
phrases as “ an inexhaustible treasury of heavenly
doctrine,” (4) or “ an overflowing fountain of salva-
tion,” (5) or putting it before us as fertile pastures
and beautiful gardens in which the flock of the Lord
is marvellously refreshed and delighted (6) Let us
listen to the words of St, Jerome, in his Epistle to
Nepotian : “ Often read the divine Scriptures ; yea,
let holy reading be always in thy hand ; study that
which thou thyself must preach Let the
speech of the priest be ever seasoned with Scriptural
reading.” (7) St. Gregory the Great, than whom no
one has more admirably described the pastoral office,

writes in the same sense : “ Those,” he says, “ who
are zealous in the work of preaching must never
cease the study of the written word of God.” (1) St.
Augustine, however, warns us that “ vainly does the
preacher utter the Word of God exteriorly unless he
listens to it interiorly ; ” (2) and St. Gregory instructs
sacred orators “ first to find in Holy Scripture the
knowledge of themselves, and then to carry it to
others, lest in reproving others they forget them-
selves.” (3) Admonitions such as these had, indeed,
been uttered long before by the Apostolic voice
which had learnt its lesson from Christ Himself,
Who “ began to do and teach.” It was not to
Timothy alone, but to the whole order of the clergy,
that the command was addressed : “ Take heed to
thyself and to doctrine ; be earnest in them. For in
doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that
hear thee.” (4) For the saving and for the perfection
of ourselves and of others there is at hand the very
best of help in the Holy Scriptures, as the Book of
Psalms, among others, so constantly insists ; but
those only will find it who bring to this divine read-
ing not only docility and attention, but also piety
and an innocent life. For the Sacred Scripture is
not like other books. Dictated by the Holy Ghost,
it contains things of the deepest importance, which
in many instances are most difficult and obscure. To
understand and explain such things there is always
required the “ coming ” (5) of the same Holy Spirit;
that is to say, His light and His grace ; and these,
as the Royal Psalmist so frequently insists, are to be
sought by humble prayer and guarded by holiness
of life.

What the Bible Owes to the Catholic Church.
It is in this that the watchful care of the Church
shines forth conspicuously. By admirable laws and
regulations, she has always shown herself solicitous
that “ the celestial treasure of the Sacred Books, so
bountifully bestowed upon man by the Holy Spirit,
should not lie neglected.” (1) She has ordained
that a considerable portion of them shall be read and
piously reflected upon by all her ministers in the
daily office of the sacred psalmody. She has ordered
that in Cathedral Churches, in monasteries, and in
other convents in which study can conveniently be
pursued, they shall be expounded and interpreted by
capable men ; and she has strictly commanded that
her children shall be fed with the saving words of
the Gospel at least on Sundays and solemn feasts. (2)
Moreover, it is owing to the wisdom and exertions of
the Church that there has always been continued
from century to century that cultivation of Holy
Scripture which has been so remarkable and has
borne such ample fruit.
And here, in order to strengthen our teaching and
our exhortations, it is well to recall how from the
beginning of Christianity, all who have been renowned
for holiness of life and sacred learning, have given
their deep and constant attention to Holy Scripture.
If we consider the immediate disciples of the Apostles,
St, Clement of Borne, St. Ignatius of Antioch, St.
Polycarp—or the apologists, such as St. Justin and
St, Irenaeas, we find that in their letters and their
books, whether in defence of the Catholic Faith or
in its commendation, they draw faith, strength, and
unction from the Word of God. When there arose,
in various Sees, Catechetical and Theological schools,
(1) Cone. Trid, sess. v, decret. de reform, 1.
(2) Ibid. 1-2.


of which the most celebrated were those of Alex-
andria and of Antioch, there was little taught in those
schools but what was contained in the reading, the
interpretation and the defence of the divine written
word. From them came forth numbers of Fathers
and writers whose laborious studies and admirable
writings have justly merited for the three following
centuries the appellation of the golden age of biblical
exegesis. In the Eastern Church, the greatest name
of all is Origen—a man remarkable alike for pene-
tration of genius and for persevering labour ; from
whose numerous works and his great Hexapla almost
all have drawn that came after him. Others who
have widened the field of this science may also be
named, as especially eminent fthus, Alexandria could
boast of Clement and St, Cyril ; Palestine, of
Eusebius and the other St. Cyril; Cappadocia, of
St. Basil the Great and the two St. Gregories, of
Nazianzus and Nyssa ; Antioch, of St. John Chry-
sostom, in whom the science of Scripture was rivalled
by the splendour of his eloquence. In the Western
Church there were many names as great ; Tertullian,
St. Cyprian, St. Hilary, St. Ambrose, St. Leo the
Great, St, Gregory the Great; most famous of all,
St. Augustine and St. Jerome, of whom the former
was so marvellously acute in penetrating the sense
of God’s Word and so fertile in the use that he made
of it for the promotion of the Catholic truth, and the
latter has received from the Church, by reason of his
pre-eminent knowledge of Scripture and his labours
in promoting its use, the name of the “ great
Doctor.” (1) From this period down to the eleventh
century, although Biblical studies did not flourish
with the same vigour and the same fruitfulness as
before, yet they did flourish, and principally by the
instrumentality of the clergy. It was their care and

solicitude that selected the best and most useful
things that the ancients had left, arranged them in
order, and published them with additions of their
own —as did St. Isidore of Seville, Venerable Bede,
and Alcuin, among the most prominent ; it was they
who illustrated the sacred pages with “ glosses ” or
short commentaries, as we see in Walafrid Strabo
and St. Anselm of Laon, or expended fresh labour
in securing their integrity, as did St. Peter Damian
and Blessed Lanfranc. In the twelfth century many
took up with great success the allegorical exposition
of Scripture. In this kind, St. Bernard is pre-
eminent ; and his writings, it may be said, are
Scripture all through. With the age of the scholastics
came fresh and welcome progress in the study of the
Bible. That the scholastics were solicitous about the
genuineness of the Latin version is evident from the
Correctoria Biblica, or lists of emendations, which
they have left. But they expended their labours
and industry chiefly on interpretation and explana-
tion. To them we owe the accurate and clear
distinction, such as had not been given before, of the
various senses of the sacred words ; the assignment
of the value of each “ sense ” in theology ; the divi-
sion of books into parts, and the summaries of the
various parts ; the investigation of the objects of the
writers; the demonstration of the connection of
sentence with sentence, and clause with clause ; all
of which is calculated to throw much light on the
more obscure passages of the sacred volume. The
valuable work of the scholastics in Holy Scripture is
seen in their theological treatises and in their Scrip-
ture commentaries; and in this respect the greatest
name among them all is St. Thomas of Aquin.
When our predecessor, Clement V., established
chairs of Oriental literature in the Roman College
and in the principal Universities of Burope, Catholics
began to make more accurate investigation on the


original text of the Bible, as well as on the Latin
version. The revival amongst us of Greek learning,
and, much more, the happy invention of the art of
printing, gave a strong impetus to Biblical studies.
In a brief space of time, innumerable editions,
especially of the Vulgate, poured from the press and
were diffused throughout the Catholic world ; so
honoured and loved was Holy Scripture during that
very period against which the enemies of the Church
direct their calumnies. Nor must we forget how
many learned men there were, chiefly among the
religious orders, who did excellent work for the Bible
between the Council of Vienne and that of Trent ;
men who, by the employment of modern means and
appliances, and by the tribute of their own genius
and learning, not only'- added to the rich stores of
ancient times, but prepared the way for the succeed-
ing century, the century which followed the Council
of Trent, when it almost seemed that the great age
of the Fathers had returned. For it is well known,
and we recall it with pleasure, that our predecessors
from Pius IV. to Clement VIII, caused to be pre-
pared the celebrated editions of the Vulgate and the
Septuagint, which, having been published by the
command and authority of Sixtus V and of the same
Clement, are now in common use. At this time,
moreover, were carefully brought out various other
ancient versions of the Bible, and the Polyglots of
Antwerp and of Paris, most important for the
investigation of the true meaning of the text; nor is
there any one Book of either Testament which did
not find more than one expositor, nor any grave
question which did not profitably exercise the ability
of many inquirers, among whom there are not a few
—more of those who made most use of the
Fathers—who have acquired great reputation. From
that time downwards the labour and solicitude of
Catholics have never been wanting ; for, as time went


on, eminent scholars have carried on Biblical study
with success, and have defended Holy Scripture
against rationalism with the same weapons of philo-
logy and kindred sciences with which it had been
attacked. The calm and fair consideration of what
has been said will clearly show that the Church has
never failed in taking due measures to bring the
Scriptures within reach of her children, and that she
has ever held fast and exercised profitably that
guardianship conferred upon her by Almighty God
for the protection and glory of His Holy Word ; so
that she has never required, nor does she now require,
any stimulation from without.
How to Study Holy Scripture.
We must now, Venerable Brethren, as our
purpose demands, impart to you such counsels as
seem best suited for carrying on successfully the
study of Biblical science.
But first it must be clearly understood whom we
have to oppose and contend against, and what are
their tactics and their arms. In earlier times the
contest was chiefly with those who, relying on
private judgment and repudiating the divine tra-
ditions and the teaching office of the Church, held the
Scriptures to be the one source of revelation and the
final appeal in matters of Faith, Now, we have to
meet the Rationalists, true offspring and inheritors
of the older heretics, who trusting in their turn to
their own way of thinking, have rejected even the
scraps and remnants of Christian belief which had
been handed down to them. They deny that there
is any such thing as revelation or inspiration, or
Holy Scripture at all; they see, instead, only the
forgeries and the falsehoods of men ; they set down
the Scripture narratives as stupid fables and lying
stories ; the prophecies and the oracles of God are


to them either predictions made up after the event
or forecasts formed by the light of nature ; the
miracles and the wonders of God’s power are not
what they are said to be, but the startling
effects of natural law, or else mere tricks and myths ;
and the Apostolic Gospels and writings are not the
work of the Apostles at all. These destestable
errors, whereby they think they destroy the truth
of the divine Books, are obtruded on the world as
the peremptory pronouncements of a certain newly-
invented “ free science a science, however, which
is so far from final that they are perpetually modi-
fying and supplementing it. And there are some of
them who, notwithstanding their impious opinions
and utterances about God, and Christ, the Gospels
and the rest of Holy Scripture, would fain be
considered both theologians and Christians and men
of the Gospel, and who attempt to disguise by such
honourable names their rashness and their pride.
To them we must add not a few professors of other
sciences who approve their views and give them
assistance, and are urged to attack the Bible by a
similar intolerance of revelation. And it is deplor-
able to see these attacks growing every day more
numerous and more severe. It is sometimes men of
learning and judgment who are assailed ; but these
have little difficulty in defending themselves from
evil consequences. The efforts and the arts of the
enemy are chiefly directed against the more ignorant
masses of the people. They diffuse their deadly
poison by means of books, pamphlets, and news-
papers ; they spread it by addresses and by conver-
sation ; they are found everywhere ; and they are in
possession of numerous schools, taken by violence
from the Church, in which, by ridicule and scurrilous
jesting, they pervert the credulous and unformed
minds of the young to the contempt of Holy
Scripture. Should not these things, Venerable


Brethren, stir up and set on fire the heart of every
Pastor, so that to this “knowledge, falsely so called,”
(1) may be opposed the ancient and true science
which the Church, through the Apostles, has
received from Christ, and that Holy Scripture may
find the champions that are needed in so momentous
a battle ?
Let our first care, then, be to see that in Seminaries
and Academical institutions the study ot Holy Scripture
be placed on such a footing as its own importance
and the circumstances of the time demand. With
this view, the first thing which requires attention is
the wise choice of Professors. Teachers of Sacred
Scripture are not to be appointed at hap-hazard
out of the crowd ; but they must be men whose
character and fitness are proved by their love of, and
their long familiarity with, the Bible, and by suitable
learning and study.
It is a matter of equal importance to provide in
time for a continuous succession of such teachers ;
and it will be well, wherever this can be done, to
select young men of good promise who have success-
fully accomplished their theological course, and to
set them apart exclusively for Holy Scripture,
affording them facilities for full and complete
studies. Professors thus chosen and thus prepared
may enter with confidence on the task that is
appointed for them ; and that they may carry out
their work well and profitably, let them take heed to
the instructions we now proceed to give.
At the commencement of a course of Holy Scrip-
ture let the Professor strive earnestly to form the
judgment of the young beginners so as to train them
equally to defend the sacred writings and to pene-
trate their meaning. This is the object of the
treatise which is called “ Introduction.” Here the
(1) 1 Tim. vi., 20.


student is taught how to prove the integrity and
authority of the Bible, how to investigate and
ascertain its true sense, and how to meet and refute
objections. It is needless to insist upon the
importance of making these preliminary studies in
an orderly and thorough fashion, with the accom-
paniment and assistance of Theology ; for the whole
subsequent course must rest on the foundation thus
laid and make use of the light thus acquired. Next,
the teacher will turn his earnest attention to that
more fruitful division of Scripture science which has
to do with Interpretation ; wherein is imparted the
method of using- the word of God for the advantage
O # O
of religion and piety. We recognise without hesi-
tation that neither the extent of the matter nor the
time at disposal allows each single Book of the
Bible to be separately gone through. But the
teaching should result in a definite and ascertained
method of interpretation—and therefore the Pro-
fessor should equally avoid the mistake of giving
a mere taste of every Book, and of dwelling at too
great length on a part of one Book. If most schools
cannot do what is done in the large institutions—
that is, take the students through the whole of one
or two Books continuously and with a certain
development—yet at least those parts which are
selected should be treated with suitable fulness; in
such a way that the students may learn from the
sample that is thus put before them to love and use
the remainder of the sacred Book during the whole
of their lives. The professor, following the tradition
of antiquity, will make use of the Vulgate as his
text; for the Council of Trent decreed that “in
public lectures, disputations, preaching, and expo-
sition,” (1) the Vulgate is the “ authentic” version ;
and this is the existing custom of the Church. At
the same time, the other versions which Christian
(i) Bess. iv., deer, da edit, et usu sacr. libror.


antiquity has approved, should not be neglected,
more especially the more ancient MSS. For
although the meaning of the Hebrew and Greek
is substantially rendered by the Vulgate, neverthe-
less wherever there may be ambiguity or want of
clearness, the “ examination of older tongues,” (1)
to quote St. Augustine, will be useful and ad-
vantageous. But in this matter we need hardly say
that the greatest prudence is required, for the “office
of a commentator,” as St. Jerome says, “is to set forth,
not what he would himself prefer, but what his
author says,” (2) The question of “readings” having
been, when necessary, carefully discussed, the next
thing is to investigate and expound the meaning.
And the first counsel to be given is this : That the
more our adversaries contend to the contrary, so
much the more solicitously should we adhere to the
received and approved canons of interpretation.
Hence, whilst weighing the meaning of words, the
connection of ideas, the parallelism of passages, and
the like, we should by all means make use of such
illustrations as can be drawn from apposite erudition
of an external sort; but this should be done with
caution, so as not to bestow on questions of this
kind more labour and time than are spent on the
Sacred Books themselves, and not to overload the
minds of the students with a mass of information
that will be rather a hindrance than a help.
Holt Scripture and Theology; Interpretation;
the Fathers.
The Professor may now safely pass on to the use
of Scripture in matters of Theology. On this head it
must be observed that in addition to the usual
reasons which make ancient writings more or less


difficult to understand, there are some which are
peculiar to the Bible. For the language of the
Bible is employed to express, under the inspiration
of the Holy Ghost, many things which are beyond
the power and scope of the reason of man —that is
to say, divine mysteries and all that is related to
them. There is sometimes in such passages a
fulness and a hidden depth of meaning which the
letter hardly expresses and which the laws of
interpretation hardly warrant. Moreover, the
literal sense itself frequently admits other senses,
adapted to illustrate dogma or to confirm morality.
Wherefore, it must be recognised that the sacred
writings are wrapt in a certain religious obscurity,
and that no one can enter into their interior without
a guide (1) ; God so disposing, as the Holy Fathers
commonly teach, in order that men may investigate
them with greater ardour and earnestness, and that
what is attained with difficulty may sink more
deeply into the mind and heart; and, most of all,
that they may understand that God has delivered
the Holy Scriptures to the Church, and that in
reading and making use of His Word, they must
follow the Church as their guide and their teacher.
St. Irenseus long since laid down, that where the
charismata of God were, there the truth was to be
learnt, and that Holy Scripture was safely in-
terpreted by those who had the Apostolic succession.
(2) His teaching, and that of other Holy Fathers,
is taken up by the Council of the Vatican, which, in
renewing the decree of Trent, declares its “ mind ” to
be this—that “in things of faith and morals,
belonging to the building up of Christian doctrine,
that is to be considered the true sense ot Holy
Scripture which has been held and is held by our
Holy Mother the Church, whose place it is to judge


of the true sense and interpretation of the Scrip-
tures ; and therefore that it is permitted to no one
to interpret Holy Scripture against such sense or
also against the unanimous agreement of the
Fathers.” (1) By this most wise decree the Church
by no means prevents or restrains the pursuit of
Biblical science, hut rather protects it from erroi,
and largely assists its real progress. A wide field is
still left open to the private student in which his
hermeneutical skill may display itself with signal
effect and to the advantage of the Church. On the
one hand, in those passages of Holy Scripture which
have not as yet received a certain and definite inter-
pretation, such labours may, in the gracious provi-
dence of God, prepare for and bring to maturity the
judgment of the Church ; on the other, in passages
already defined, the private student may do work
equally valuable, either by setting them forth more
clearly to the flock and more skilfully to scholars, or
by defending them more powerfully from hostile
attack. Wherefore the first and dearest object of
the Catholic commentator should be to interpret
those passages which have received an authentic
interpretation either from the sacred writers them-
selves, under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost (as
in many places of the New Testament), or from the
Church, under the assistance of the same Holy
Spirit, whether by her solemn judgment or her
ordinary and universal magisterium (2) —to in-
terpret these passages in that identical sense, and to
prove, by all the resources of science, that sound her-
meneutical laws admit of no other interpretation.
In the other passages, the analogy of faith should
be followed, and Catholic doctrine, as authoritatively
proposed by the Church, should be held as the supreme
law; for, seeing that the same God is the author
(1) Sess. iii., cap. ii., de revel.; cf. Cone. Trid. ness. iv„ decret de edit, et
vsu sacr. libror.
(2) Cone. Yat. sees, iii., cap. 3, de fide.


both of the Sacred Books and of the doctrine
committed to the Church, it is clearly impossible
that any teaching can by legitimate means be
extracted from the former, which shall in any
respect be at variance with the latter. Hence, it
follows that all interpretation is foolish and false
which either makes the sacred writers disagree one
with another, or is opposed to the doctrine of the
Church. The Professor of Holy Scripture, there-
fore, amongst ‘other qualifications, must be well
acquainted with the whole circle of Theology and
deeply read in the commentaries of the Holy Fathers
and Doctors, and other interpreters of mark. (1)
This is inculcated by St, Jerome, and still more
frequently by St. Augustine, who thus justly
complains ; “If there is no branch of teaching,
however humble and easy to learn, which does not
require a master, what’ can be a greater sign of
rashness and pride than to refuse to study the
Books of the divine mysteries by the help of those
who have interpreted them?” (2) The other
Fathers have said the same, and have confirmed it
by their example, for they “ endeavoured to acquire
the understanding of the Holy Scriptures, not by
their own lights and ideas, but from the writings and
authorities of the ancients, who in their turn, as we
know, received the rule of interpretation in direct
line from the Apostles.” (3) The Holy Fathers
“ to whom, after the Apostles, the Church owes its
growth —who have planted, watered, built, governed,
and cherished it,” (4) the Holy Fathers, we say, are
of supreme authority, whenever they all interpret in
one and the same manner any text of the Bible, as
pertaining to the doctrine of faith or morals; for
(1) Ibid. 6, 7.
(2) Ad Honorat. de util. cred. xvii., 35.
(3) Rutinus Hist ted. ii., 9.
(4) S. Aug. c. Julian, ii., 10, 37-


their unanimity clearly evinces that such interpreta-
tion has come down from the Apostles as a matter
of Catholic faith. The opinion of the Fathers is
also of very great weight when they treat of these
matters in their capacity of doctors, unofficially;
not only because they excel in their knowledge of
revealed doctrine and in their acquaintance with
many things which are useful in understanding the
apostolic Books, but because they are men of eminent
sanctity and of ardent zeal for the truth, on whom
God has bestowed a more ample measure of his
light. Wherefore the expositor should make it His
duty to follow their footsteps with all reverence, and
to use their labours with intelligent appreciation.
But he must not on that account consider that it
is forbidden, when just cause exists, to push inquiry
and exposition beyond what the Fathers have done ;
provided he carefully observes the rule so wisely laid
down by St. Augustine—not to depart from the
literal and obvious sense, except only where reason
makes it untenable or necessity requires ; (]) a rule
to which it is the more necessary to adhere strictly
in these times, when the thirst for novelty and unre-
strained freedom of thought make the danger of
error most real and proximate. Neither should those
passages be neglected which the Fathers have under-
stood in an allegorical or figurative sense, more
especially when such interpretation is justified by the
literal, and when it rests on the authority of many.
For this method of interpretation has been received
by the Church from the Apostles, and has been
approved by her own practice, as the holy Liturgy
attests ; although it is true that the holy Fathers
did not thereby pretend directly to demonstrate
dogmas of faith, but used it as a means of promoting
virtue and piety, such as, by their own experience,


they knew to be most valuable. The authority of
other Catholic interpreters is not so great ; but the
study of Scripture has always continued to advance
in the Church, and, therefore, these commentaries
also have their own honourable place, and are service-
able in many ways for the refutation of assailants
and the explanation of difficulties. But it is most
unbecoming to pass by, in ignorance or contempt, the
excellent work which Catholics have left in abun-
dance, and to have recourse to the works of non-
Catholics—and to seek in them, to the detriment of
sound doctrine and often to the peril of faith, the
explanation of passages on which Catholics long ago
have successfully employed their talent and their
labour. For although the studies of non Catholics,
used with prudence, may sometimes be of use to the
Catholic student, he should, nevertheless, bear well
in mind—as the Fathers also teach in numerous
passages (I)—that the sense of Holy Scripture can
nowhere be found incorrupt outside of the Church,
and cannot be expected to be found in writers who,
being without the true faith, only gnaw the bark of
the Sacred Scripture, and never attain its pith. (2)
Most desirable it is, and most essential, that the
whole teaching of Theology should be pervaded and
animated by the use of the divine Word of Gfod.
This is what the Fathers and the greatest theologians
of all ages have desired and reduced to practice. It
was chiefly out of the Sacred Writings that they
endeavoured to proclaim and establish the Articles
of Faith and the truths therewith connected, and it
was in them, together with divine Tradition, that
they found the refutation ot heretical error, and the
reasonableness, the true meaning, and the mutual
relation of the truths of Catholicism. Nor will

(2) ft. Greg. M. Moral, xx., 9 (al. llj.


anyone wonder at this who considers that the Sacred
Books hold such an eminent position among the
sources of revelation that without their assiduous
study and use, Theology cannot be placed on its true
footing, or treated as its dignity demands. For
although it is right and proper that students in
academies and schools should be chiefly exercised in
acquiring a scientific knowledge of dogma, by means
of reasoning from the Articles of Faith to their con-
sequences, according to the rules of approved and
sound philosophy—nevertheless the judicious and
instructed theologian will by no means pass by that
method of doctrinal demonstration which draws its
proof from the authority of the Bible ; “ for Theo-
logy does not receive her first principles from any
other science, but immediately from God by revela-
tion. And, therefore, she does not receive of other
sciences as from a superior, but uses them as
her inferiors or handmaids.” It is this view of
doctrinal teaching which is laid down and recom-
mended by the prince of theologians, St. Thomas of
A quin ; (1) who, moreover, shows—such being the
essential character of Christian Theology—how she
can defend her own principles against attack : “ If
the adversary,” he says, “ do but grant any portion
of the divine revelation, we have an argument against
him ; thus, against a heretic we can employ Scripture
authority, and against those who deny one article,
we can use another. But if our opponent reject
divine revelation entirely, there is then no way left
iio prove the Articles of Faith by arguments ; we can
only solve the difficulties which are raised against
them.” (2) Care must be taken, then, that beginners
approach the study ot the Bible well prepared and
furnished; otherwise, just hopes will be frustrated,
or, perchance, what is worse, they will unthinkingly


risk the danger of error, falling an easy prey to the
sophisms and laboured erudition of the Rationalists.
The best preparation will be a conscientious applica-
tion to philosophy and theology under the guidance
of St. Thomas of A quin, and a thorough training
therein—as we ourselves have elsewhere pointed out
and directed. By this means, both in Biblical studies
and in that part of Theology which is called positive ,
they will pursue the right path and make satisfactory
progress.
The Authority of Holy Scripture ; Modern
Criticism ; Physical Science.
To prove, to expound, to illustrate Catholic
Doctrine by the legitimate and skilful interpretation
of the Bible, is much ; but there is a second part of
the subject of equal importance and equal difficulty—
the maintenance in the strongest possible way of its
full authority. This cannot be done completely or
satisfactorily except b} 7 means of the living and
proper magisterium of the Church. The Church,
“ by reason of her wonderful propagation, her dis-
tinguished sanctity and inexhaustible fecundit} 7 in
good, her Catholic unity, and her unshaken stability,
is herself a great and perpetual motive of credibility,
and an unassailable testimony to her own Divine
mission.” (l) But since the divine and infallible
magisterium of the Church rests also on the autho-
rity of Holy Scripture, the first thing to be done is
to vindicate the trustworthiness of the sacred records
at least as human documents, from which can be
clearly proved, as from primitive and authentic
testimony, the Divinity and the mission of Christ
our Lord, the institution of a hierarchical Church
and the primacy of Peter and his successors. It is
most desirable, therefore, that there should be
(1) Cone. Vat. sens. iii., c. iii. de fide.


numerous members of the clergy well prepared to
enter upon a contest of this nature, and to repulse
hostile assaults, chiefly trusting in that armour of
God recommended by the Apostle, (I) but also not
unaccustomed to modern methods of attack. This
is beautifully alluded to by St. John Chrysostom,
when describing the duty of priests : “We must use
every endeavour that the ‘ Word of God may dwell
in us abundantly ’ (2) and not merely for one kind of
fight must we be prepared—for the contest is many-
sided and the enemy is of every sort; and they do
not all use the same weapons nor make their onset
in the same way. Wherefore it is needful that the
man who has to contend against all should be
acquainted with the engines and the arts of all—that
he should be at once archer and slinger, commandant
and officer, general and private soldier, toot-soldier
and horseman, skilled in sea-fight and in siege ; for
unless he knows every trick and turn of war, the
devil is well able, if only a single door be left open,
to get in his fierce bands and carry off the sheep.” (3)
The sophisms of the and his manifold arts of
attack we have already touched upon. Let us now
say a word of advice on the means of defence. The
first means is the study of the Oriental languages and
of the art of criticism. These two acquirements are in
these days held in high estimation, and therefore the
clergy, by making themselves more or less fully
acquainted with them as time and place may demand,
will the better be able to discharge their office with
becoming credit; for they must make themselves
“ all to all,” (4) always “ ready to satisfy every one
that asketh them a reason for the hope that is in
them.” (5) Hence it is most proper that Professors

of Sacred Scripture and theologians should master
those tongues in which the sacred Books were
originally written ; and it would be well that Church
students also should cultivate them, more especially
those who aspire to academic degrees. And endea-
vours should be made to establish in all academic
institutions —as has already been laudably done in
many —chairs of the other ancient languages, especi-
ally the Semitic, and of subjects connected therewith,
for the benefit principally of those who are intended
to profess sacred literature. These latter, with a
similar object in view, should make themselves well
and thoroughly acquainted with the art of true
criticism. There has arisen, to the great detriment
of religion, an inept method, dignified by the name
of the ‘‘ higher criticism,” which pretends to judge
of the origin, integrity and authority of each Book
from internal indications alone. It is clear, on the
other hand, that in historical questions, such as the
origin and the handing down of writings, the witness
of history is of primary importance, and that histori-
cal investigation should be male with the utmost
care ; and that in this matter internal evidence is
seldom of great value, except as confirmatory. To
look upon it in any other light will be to open the
door to many evil consequences. It will make the
enemies of religion much more bold and confident in
attacking and mangling the Sacred Books ; and this
vaunted “ higher criticism ” will resolve itself into
the reflection of the bias and the prejudice of the
critics. It will not throw on the Scripture the light
which is sought, or prove of any advantage to
doctrine ; it will only give rise to disagreement and
dissension, those sure notes of error, which the critics
in question so plentifully exhibit in their own persons;
and seeing that most of them are tainted with false
philosophy and rationalism, it must lead to the
elimination from the sacred writings of all prophecy


and miracle, and of everything else that is outside
the natural order.
In the second place, we have to contend against
those who, making an evil use of physical science,
minutely scrutinize the Sacred Book in order to
detect the writers in a mistake, and to take occasion
to vilify its contents. Attacks of this kind, bearing
as they do on matters of sensible experience, are
peculiarly dangerous to the masses, and also to the
young who are beginning their literary studies ; for
the young, if they lose their reverence for the Holy
Scripture on one or more points, are easily led to
give up believing in it altogether. It need not be
pointed out how the nature of science, just as it is so
admirably adapted to show forth the glory of the
Great Creator, provided it be taught as it should be,
so if it be perversely imparted to the youthful intelli-
gence, it may prove most fatal in destroying the
principles of true philosophy and in the corruption of
morality. Hence to the Professor of Sacred Scrip-
ture a knowledge of natural science will be of very
great assistance in detecting such attacks on the
Sacred Books, and in refuting them. There can
never, indeed, be any real discrepancy between the
theologian and the physicist, as long as each confines
himself within his own lines, and both are careful,
as St. Augustine warns us, “ not to make rash
assertions, or to assert what is not known as known.”
(I) If dissension should arise between them, here
is the rule also laid down by St. Augustine, for the
theologian ; “ Whatever they can really demonstrate
to be true of physical nature, we must show to be
capable of reconciliation with our Scriptures ; and
whatever they assert in their treatises which is con-
trary to these Scriptures of ours, that is to Catholic
faith, we must either prove it as well as we can to be
entirely false, or at all events we must, without the
(1) In Gen. op. imperf. ix., 30.


smallest hesitation, believe it to be so.” (1) To
understand how just is the rule here formulated we
must remember, first, that the sacred writers, or to
speak more accurately, the Holy Ghost “ Who spoke
by them, did not intend to teach men these things
(that is to say, the essential nature of the things of
the visible universe), things in no way profitable unto
salvation.” (2) Hence they did not seek to penetrate
the secrets of nature, but rather described and dealt
with things in more or less figurative language, or in
terms which were commonly used at the time, and
which in many instances are in daily use at this day,
even by the most eminent men of science. Ordinary
speech primarily and properly describes what comes
under the senses; and somewhat in the same way
the sacred writers—as the Angelic Doctor also
reminds us—“ went by what visibly appeared,” (3)
or put down what God, speaking to men, signified,
in the way men could understand and were accus-
tomed to.
The unshrinking defence of the Holy Scripture,
however, does not require that we should equally
uphold all the opinions which each of the Fathers or
the more recent interpreters have put forth in
explaining it; for it may be that, in commenting on
passages where physical matters occur, they have
sometimes expressed the ideas of their own times,
and thus made statements which in these days have
been abandoned as incorrect. Hence, in their inter-
pretations, we must careful y note what they lay
down as belonging to faith, or as intimately connected
with faith—what they are unanimous in. For “in
those things which do not come under the obligation
of faith, the Saints w T ere at liberty to hold divergent


opinions, just as we ourselves are,” (1) according to
the saying of St. Thomas. And in another place he
says most admirably: “When philosophers are agreed
upon a point, and it is not contrary to our faith, it is
safer, in my opinion, neither to lay down such a
point as a dogma of faith, even though it is perhaps
so presented by the philosophers, nor to reject it as
against faith, lest we thus give to the wise of this
world an occasion of despising our faith.” (2) The
Catholic interpreter, although he should show 7 that
those facts of natural science which investigators
affirm to be now quite certain are not contrary to the
Scripture rightly explained, must nevertheless always
bear in mind, that much which has been held and
proved as certain has afterwards been called in ques-
tion and rejected. And if writers on physics travel
outside the boundaries of their own branch, and
carry their erroneous teaching into the domain of
philosophy, let them be handed over to philosophers
for refutation.
Inspiration Incompatible with Error,
The principles here laid down will apply to cognate
sciences, and especially to History. It is a lament-
able fact that there are many who with great labour
carry out and publish investigations on the monu-
ments of antiquity, the manners and institutions of
nations and other illustrative subjects, and whose
chief purpose in all this is too often to find mistakes
in the sacred writings and so to shake and wmaken
their authority. Some of these writers display not
only extreme hostility, but the greatest unfairness ;
in their eyes a profane book or ancient document is
accepted without hesitation, whilst the Scripture, if
they only find in it a suspicion of error, is set down


with the slightest possible discussion as quite untrust-
worthy. It is true, no doubt, that copyists have
made mistakes in the text of the Bible : this question,
when it arises, should be carefully considered on its
merits, and the fact not too easily admitted, but only
in those passages where the proof is clear. It may
also happen that the sense of a passage remains
ambiguous, and in this case good hermeneutical
methods will greatly assist in clearing up the obscurity.
But it is absolutely wrong and forbidden, either to
narrow inspiration to certain parts only of Holy
Scripture, or to admit that the sacred writer has
erred. For the system of those who, in order to iid
themselves of these difficulties, do not hesitate to
concede that divine inspiration regards the things of
faith and morals, and nothing beyond, because (as
they wrongly think) in a question of the truth or
falsehood of a passage, we should consider not so
much what God has said as the reason and purpose
which He had in mind in saying it—this system
cannot be tolerated. For all the books which the
Church receives as sacred and canonical, are written
wholly and entirely, with all their parts, at the
dictation of the Holy Ghost ; and so far is it from
being possible that any error can co-exist with
inspiration, that inspiration not only is essentially
incompatible with error, but excludes and rejects it
as absolutely and necessarily as it is impossible that
God Himself, the supreme Truth, can utter that
which is not true. This is the ancient and unchang-
ing faith of the Church, solemnly defined in the
Councils of Florence and of Trent, and finally con-
firmed and more expressly formulated by the Council
of the Vatican, in which it was definitely decreed that:
“ The Books of the Old and New Testament, whole
and entire, with all their parts, as enumerated in the
decree of the same Council (Trent) and in the ancient
Latin Vulgate, are to be received as sacred and


canonical. And the Church holds them as sacred
and canonical, not because, having been composed by
human industry, they were afterwards approved by
her authority ; nor only because they contain revela-
tion without error ; but because, having been written
under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, they have
God for their author.” (1) Hence, because the Holy
Ghost employed men as His instruments, we cannot
therefore say that it was these inspired instruments
who, perchance, have fallen into error, and not the
primary author. For, by supernatural power, He
so moved and impelled them to write—He was so
present to them-—that the things which He ordered,
and those only, they, first, rightly understood, then
willed faithfully to write down, and finally expressed
in apt words and with infallible truth. Otherwise,
it could not be said that He was the Author of the
entire Scripture. Such has always been the persua-
sion of the Fathers. “Therefore,” says St. Augus-
tine, “ since they wrote the things which He showed
and uttered to them, it cannot be pretended that He
is not the writer ; for His members executed what
their Head dictated.” (2) And St. Gregory the
Great thus pronounces : “ Most superfluous it is to
inquire who wrote these things-—we loyally believe
the Holy Ghost to be the Author of the book. He
wrote it Who dictated it for writing; He wrote it
Who inspired its execution,” (3)
It follows that those who maintain that an error
is possible in any genuine passage of the sacred
writings, either pervert the Catholic notion of
inspiration, or make God the author of such error.
And so emphatically were all the Fathers and
Doctors agreed that the divine writings, as left by
the hagiographers, are free from all error, that they
(1) Sess. iii., c. ii., de Rev.
(2) Be consensu Evangel. 1. 1, c. .35.
(3) Praef. in Job, n. 2.


laboured earnestly, with no less skill than reverence,
to reconcile with each other those numerous passages
which seem at variance—the very passages which in
great measure have been taken up by the “ higher
criticism ; ” for they were unanimous in laying it
down, that those writings, in their entirety and in
all their parts were equally from the afflatus of
Almighty God, and that God, speaking by the
sacred writers, could not set dowm anything but what
was true. The words of St. Augustine to St. Jerome
may sum up w r hat they taught : “On my own part
1 confess to your charity that it is only to those
Books of Scripture which are now called canonical
that I have learned to pay such honour and reverence
as to believe most firmly that none of their writers
has fallen into any error. And if in these Books I
meet anything which seems contrary to truth, 1 shall
not hesitate to conclude either that the text is faulty,
or that the translator has not expressed the meaning of
the passage, or that 1 myself do not understand it,” (1)
But to undertake fully and perfectly, and with all
the weapons of the best science, the defence of the
Holy Bible is far more than can be looked for from
the exertions of commentators and theologians alone.
It is an enterprise in which we have a right to expect
the co-operation of all those Catholics who have
acquired reputation in any branch of learning what-
ever. As in the past, so at the present time, the
Church is never without the graceful support of her
accomplished children; may their services to the
Faith grow and increase! For there is nothing
which we believe to be more needful than that truth
should find defenders more powerful and more
numerous than the enemies it has to face ; nor is
there anything which is better calculated to impress
the masses with respect for truth than to see it boldly


proclaimed by learned and distinguished men. More-
over, the bitter tongues of objectors will be silenced,
or at least they will not dare to insist so shamelessly
that faith is the enemy of science, when they see
that scientific men of eminence in their profession
show towards faith the most marked honour and
respect. Seeing, then, that those can do so much
for the advantage of religion on whom the goodness
of Almighty God has bestowed, together with the
grace of the faith, great natural talent, let such men,
in this bitter conflict of which the Holy Scripture is
the object, select each of them the branch of study
most suitable to his circumstances, and endeavour to
excel therein, and thus be prepared to repulse with
credit and distinction the assaults on the Word of
God. And it is our pleasing duty to give deserved
praise to a work which certain Catholics have taken
up —that is to say, the formation of societies and the
contribution of considerable sums of money, for the
purpose of supplying studious and learned men with
every kind of help and assistance in carrying out
complete studies. Truly an excellent method of
investing money, and well-suited to the times in
which we live ! The less hope of public patronage
there is for Catholic study, the more ready and the
more abundant should be the liberality of private
persons —those to whom God has given riches thus
willingly making use of their means to safeguard the
treasure of His revealed doctrine.
Summary.
In order that all these endeavours and exertions
may really prove advantageous to the cause of the
Bible, let scholars keep steadfastly to the principles
which we have in this Letter laid down. Let them
loyally hold that God, the Creator and Ruler of all
things, is also the Author of the Scriptures —and


that therefore nothing can be proved either by
physical science or archaeology which can really con-
tradict the Scriptures. If, then, apparent contra-
diction he met with, every effort should be made to
remove it. Judicious theologians and commentators
should be consulted as to what is the true or most
probable meaning of the passage in discussion, and
the hostile arguments should be carefully weighed.
Even if the difficulty is after all not cleared up and
the discrepancy seems to remain, the contest must not
be abandoned ; truth cannot contradict truth, and
we may be sure that some mistake has been made
either in the interpretation of the sacred words, or in
the polemical discussion itself; and if no such mistake
can be detected, we must then suspend judgment for
the time being. There have been objections without
number perseveringly directed against the Scripture
for many a long year, which have been proved to be
futile and are now never heard of; and not unfre-
quently interpretations have been, placed on certain
passages of Scripture (not belonging to the rule of
faith or morals) which have been rectified by more
careful investigations. As time goes on, mistaken
views die and disappear ; but “ truth remaineth and
groweth stronger for ever and ever.” (1) Wherefore,
as no one should be so presumptuous as to think that
he understands the whole of the Scripture, in which
St. Augustine himself confessed that there was more
that he did not know, than that he knew, (2) so, if
he should come upon anything that seems incapable
of solution, he must take to heart the cautious rule
of the same holy Doctor : “ It is better even to be
oppressed by unknown but useful signs, than to
interpret them uselessly and thus to throw off the
yoke only to be caught in the trap of error.” (3)


As to those who pursue the subsidiary studies of
which we have spoken, if they honestly and modestly
follow the counsels we have given—if by their pen
and their voice they make their studies profitable
against the enemies of truth, and useful in saving the
young from the loss of their faith—they may justly
congratulate themselves on their worthy service to
the Sacred Writings, and on affording to Catholicism
that assistance which the Church has a right to
expect from the piety and learning of her children.
Such, Venerable Brethren, are the admonitions
and the instructions which, by the help of God, we
have thought it well, at the present moment, to offer
to you on the study of Holy Scripture, It will now
be your province to see that what we have said be
observed and put in practice with all due reverence
and exactness; that so, we may prove our gratitude
to God for the communication to man of the Words
of His Wisdom, and that all the good results so
much to be desired may be realized, especially as
they affect the training of the students of the Church,
which is our own great solicitude and the Church’s
hope. Exert yourselves with willing alacrity, and
use your authority and your persuasion in order that
these studies may be held in just regard and may
flourish, in Seminaries and in the educational Insti-
tutions which are under your jurisdiction. Let them
flourish in completeness and in happy success, under
the direction of the Church, in accordance with the
salutary teaching and example of the Holy Fathers
and the laudable traditions of antiquity ; and, as
time goes on, let them be widened and extended as
the interests and glory of truth may require—the
interests of that Catholic Truth which comes from
above, the never-failing source of man’s salvation.
Finally, we admonish with paternal love all students
and ministers of the Church always to approach the
Sacred Writings with reverence and piety ; for it is


impossible to attain to the profitable understanding
thereof unless the arrogance of “ earthly ” science be
laid aside, and there be excited in the heart the holy
desire for that wisdom “ which is from above.” In
this way the intelligence which is once admitted to
these sacred studies, and thereby illuminated and
strengthened, will acquire a marvellous facility in.
detecting and avoiding the fallacies of human science,
and in gathering and using for eternal salvation all
that is valuable and precious ; whilst at the same
time the heart will grow warm, and will strive with
ardent longing to advance in virtue and in divine
love. Blessed are they who examine His testi-
monies ; they shall seek Him with their whole
heart.” (1)
And now, filled with hope in the divine assistance,
and trusting to your pastoral solicitude—as a pledge
of heavenly grace and a sign of our special goodwill
—to you all, and to the Clergy and the whole flock
entrusted to you, we lovingly impart in our Lord the
Apostolic benediction.
Given at St. Peter’s, at Rome, the 18th day of
November, 1893, the eighteenth year
of Our Pontificate.
