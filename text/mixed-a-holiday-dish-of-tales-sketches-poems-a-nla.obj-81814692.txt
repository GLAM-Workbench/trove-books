PREFACE
areplKE the inevitable Clown in the pantomime, I exclaim, ? Here I am again !? r
i|| This year has brought with it many changes. The land boom has burst,,
clerks have absconded, and the murderer has given the executioner an oppor
tunity of testing if his ? wrist had lost its cunning.? But we have also experienced:
many pleasures.
The excitement of the great Centennial Exhibition we will not readily forget,
we have witnessed performances on the stage of some renowned English actors
and actresses, and enjoyed ourselves in a thousand and one ways.
I, fully realising the fact that my readers have had Sorrows as well as Delights
during the last year, have in a most charitable and loyal manner decided to publish
? Mixed,? so as to give them a chance of reading the witty contributions of ray able
writers, and thus assist them to
? Let the dead past bury its dead.?
I need hardly say that the actual price of ? Mixed ? should be one guinea, but,
as it has been decided to publish it at one shilling, the reader should
always look upon the Editor as his philanthropic friend.

A REMINISCENCE OF THE WEST COAST OF NEW ZEALAND.
PALLO, Jeff, old chap !? hailed a tall, fair-haired man, grasping my hand, and
giving it a vyce-like grip ; ? how are you getting on ? and how came you
in this providence-forsaken hole ??
? Oh ! came here by the usual route,? I replied, laughing, and returning his
grip, as I recognised a well-known sporting friend of mine who, under the nom de
plume of ?Tout Cela,? was at one time considered the great authority on sporting
matters in Melbourne. ? How is yourself, Dicker ? and whatever brought you
here ??
?That grand old tub, yclept the ? Gothenburg,?? said Dicker ; ? attracted by
the fame of these wonderful gold-fields, where they tell me the glittering dross is to
be shovelled up by the bucketful. I have shaken off the dust of civilisation, and
have come to seek fortune in these dreary wilds.?
? It?s a wonderful place,? said I, ? but I?m afraid you are rather late in the
hunt, old man. The cream has been skimmed, and I don?t think skimmed milk will
suit your palate.?
?Just my luck,? replied Dicker, with a resigned look ; ? but I hope some of
the golden cream has fallen to your share.?
? I can?t complain,? said I. ?I?ve managed to get a share of what has been
going. I tried the pick and shovel arrangement only for a week or two, but I soon
found out that it wasn?t in my line, so I left it to luckier mortals, and started in
business, as paying better and with more certain results.?
?You always had a good eye for the main chance,? said Dicker, ? and always
backed the field. Well, I?m glad to hear of your luck. Come and have dinner with
me, old chap. I can?t promise you such a bill of fare as we could get at Menzies?,
though the price is about the same, but old Solomon at the cafe will manage to give
us something to keep us from starving. Come along,? and, linking his arm in mine,
we proceeded towards what old Solomon, the proprietor, dignified as the ? Royal
Cafe.?
Some four-and-twenty years ago, attracted by the glowing reports of the West


Coast gold mines, I found myself in company with several thousand other ad-
venturers in Hokitika, the seaport town of the West Coast gold fields, which was
then in its prime. It was one of the busiest towns I had ever been in, and resembled,
in nearly every feature, the glorious days of old Bendigo. Business people were
making fortunes, and the mining population were also equally successful, and, as in
the old days, wealth so easily acquired was as lavishly spent, as if it was inexhaus-
tible. For a while I tried mining, but being unlucky I soon abandoned that, and
turned my attention to business, and soon established myself in a large, general
store, where I made money fast. I had started about twelve months when the
meeting between my old friend, Dicker Hamilton, and myself took place in Revel
street, Hokitika. Having explained my story as far as the introductory stage, I will
now go on with it ?
? Not such a bad feed for a mining town,? said Dicker, leaning back in his
chair and lighting a cigar at the conclusion of our meal. ? Try a weed, old boy, and
don?t spare the whisky bottle.?
? What do you intend doing, Dicker ?? I asked, after following his advice with
reference to the weed and whisky.
? Do ?? said Dicker, puffing out a volume of smoke, and watching it gracefully
curl upwards towards the ceiling. ? Well, that?s where I?m a little at sea. Men of
genius like myself are at a big discount here ; I?ve found that out. They want
brawn and muscle, not brains. I have both the first, you may say ; true, but I?ve
lost the desire for exercising either, and if the last fails to pull me through I shall
have to return to lovely Victoria, where such commodities are of marketable value.?
? Suppose you take to the bush and turn road collector,? said I, with a laugh.
?We have been singularly free from the bushranging element. There?s a lot of
money in it, Dicker.?
? No, thanks,? replied Dicker, drily ; ? I have a fancy that I can ease a portion
of your wealthy population of their superfluous coin at less risk to myself than in
the way you suggest, and in a more popular style.?
? Struck an idea ?? I asked.
? No, but it?s struck me,? replied Dicker ; ?I will get up a race meeting.?
?Nonsense!? said I. ?Why, there isn?t a nag on the West Coast worth a
cent, except pack horses, and you don?t surely expect that kind of cattle to be
entered for races, do you ? There is also another drawback to your scheme. We
have no racecourse ; the country is all dense scrub, swamp and heavily timbered
terraces. Try again, Dicker ; that scheme won?t answer.?


? Hannibal, by the help of vinegar, so history states, drilled through the Alps,?
said Dicker, with a mock heroic look, ?and shall I, ? Tout Cela,? the worshipped
prophet of the Australasian racing community, be deterred by such trifles as you
mention from getting up a second Melbourne Cup on this Wild Coast of yours ?
Certainly not ! I will bet you a fiver that within three months this hitherto virgin
town, so far as horse racing is concerned, will re-echo with the name of ? Tout Cela,?
and the inhabitants thereof will bless or otherwise the day they first heard in their
virtuous hamlet the magic Shibboleth of ? I?ll lay the odds.??
? Well,? said I, rising, ?if you can do what you say, I will willingly pay over
the fiver. We want some other excitement than an occasional free fight or a new
rush or two. You can put me down as one of the stewards if you like, but unless
you hold your meeting in town and utilise the main street as a racecourse, it strikes
me you will have to hand me over the fiver. Good night, Dicker,? and, with a
hearty hand shake, I left him and went home, after telling him where to find me.
It was fully three weeks after before I heard or saw any more of my friend
Dicker, but one day he entered the store, and after the usual salutations, he gravely
unrolled a newspaper, and, pointing to an advertisement with a look of triumph, said,
?What do you think of that, my doubting friend ? Hand over your fiver, and deify
? Tout Cela !? ?
I followed the pointing of his finger, and saw, to my astonishment, a full column
advertisement in a Christchurch paper, announcing that a race meeting would be
held at Hokitika on Boxing Day and the day following ; the principal events being
the Hokitika Cup, value and the West Coast Handicap, ; the next in
importance being a Steeplechase, � 150, and a Hurdle Race, � 100. A lot of minor
events filled up the two days? programme, and a race supper, admittance one guinea,
finished up the column that Dicker so triumphantly pointed out to me.
? How in the name of Bucephalus do you intend to carry out this programme ??
I asked Dicker.
? God bless you,? replied he, with a wink ; ?it is as easy as shelling peas.
Why, I?ve got thirteen entries for the Cup, and fifteen for the Handicap already ;
and as for the smaller events they are sure to fill up. It takes me a very short time
to fix things when once I make up my mind to carry them out.?
? However did you get your entries ?? I asked.
?Simple as ABC,? said Dicker, coolly. ?I read the papers. There was a
big race meeting over in Christchurch, where they have some racing cattle, and
also racecourses, although the amounts they run for are rather small ; so I dazzled


theif eyes with a big programme, and, as it only meant crossing the range through
the Otira Gorge, a distance of a hundred and fifty miles or thereabouts, they took
the bait; and I feel quite sure that the West Coast will shortly be alive with ani-
mals not good enough to win a second-rate selling race at a country meeting in
Victoria, but quite good enough to furnish a fair amount of sport for the people
here, and which will enable me to raise enough to clear out of this lovely spot.?
u But how about a racecourse ?? I asked.
? All settled, sonny,? replied Dicker. ? During my peregrinations I crossed
the river and discovered four honest sons of toil clearing scrub from a flat piece of
ground with the intention of supplying the inhabitants of this primeval Paradise
with green stuff. I pointed out to them that the easiest way of realising capital at
once would be to clear a space for a r acecourse, instead of a garden, and a ten-
pound note judiciously advanced set them to carry out my views, and in a week or
two I shall have a racecourse which, if not equal to Randwick or Flemington, will at
least be sufficient to enable your citizens to have a good day?s outing and give them
a chance to drop a portion of their superfluous wealth, of which I hope to get
my share. Reference to my advertisements will prove to you that everything is
O.K. The stewards? names are sufficient to prove the legitimacy of the affair, and
each of them has lodged cheques in the bank for a hundred pounds as a guarantee
of good faith.?
? You are a wonder !? said I, returning him the newspaper, ? and, although
mortals are not supposed to command success, you deserve it.?
? Don?t pelt me with old gags,? said Dicker, laughing. ? I simply find myself
in a tight place and I want to get out of it with the honors of war, and a big
share of the spoil if I can. By the bye, I think I can put you on to a good
thing. There?s a horse called Merrimac coming over for the sticks, and he can win
whatever he goes for, either steeple or hurdle. Spinks, an old friend of mine, owns
him and rides him. Back him at the best price you can get, and I will keep you
posted whether to hedge or not. lam going to back him myself for a pot of money,
and it will be either a break or make with me. It won?t take much to do the first,
and if I don?t compass the latter, well, it only costs six pounds for a passage to Vic-
toria, and a little loss of prestige here, which won?t trouble me much in the future.
It is worth risking, particularly when a man has nothing to lose either in capital or
character and with a jaunty nod, Dicker left the store after partaking of a modest
refresher from a private bottle I always kept for the requirements of my cash cus-
tomers and friends.


A few more weeks passed away, and Dicker Hamilton had become a great
power in the land of gold Large placards announcing the forthcoming race meeting
met the view at every point of vantage, and the odds could be heard loudly pro-
claimed by budding bookmakers at every street corner or hotel bar. Dicker,
gorgeouspn raiment and a long stove-pipe hat, was hand and glove with the local
magnates, and occasionally met me, and, when nobody was looking, used to give
me a sly wink, which I took as indicating that he had struck a patch ; but he did
not favor me with his company except once previous to the races, and that was to
tell me to back Merrimac for all I was worth, if I had to sell my store. As I had
known the gentle Dicker previously, I did not blindly follow his tip, but I was
weak enough to invest fifty pounds on his information, taking two hundred to fifty
from a person I knew would pay if he lost. The week before the races, nothing
was talked about but the coming carnival, the reports of which drew hundreds of
diggers down from the terraces (or ranges, as we call them here) to back their
fancies and wind up with a howling spree. If a second Ophir had been discovered
during this time, I don?t think it would have affected the community as much as the
state of the odds. And the price of gold and the last new rush were topics thought
quite unworthy of conversation in comparison to the all-absorbing one of what were
going to win the double.
The eventful day came, and thousands of sturdy diggers and well-to-do busi-
ness men thronged the racecourse, all the available boat power being called into re-
quisition to navigate the crossing. The horses also had to be swum over. The
course presented an appearance that must have been very gratifying to the pro-
moters. A rough grand-stand had been extemporised, and was crowded with the
fair sex, admission ios. ; 5 s - being also charged to the less aristocratic portion.
Dicker, like Solomon, arrayed in all his glory, was as busy as a bluebottle fly in a
a sugar mill, shaking hands and drinking with everybody he met. ,1 was just
going up on the grand-stand vhen he caught sight of me, and, making me a sign,
I followed him to the rear of the judge?s box.
? Are you betting on the flat races ?? he asked.
?Not a cent,? said I.
?That?s right. Don?t put a penny on,? said Dicker. ? Two of the biggest
scoundrels in New Zealand own the best horses, and they haven?t taken me
into their confidence ? (this was said indignantly), ? but they can win both cup and
handicap with which they like. Anyhow, they are not going to have me or any of
my friends. Did you back Merrimac for the hurdles ??


?Oh ! yes,? said I. ? I backed your tip, and took two hundred to fifty.?
? Right you are,? said Dicker, patting me on the shoulder. ? It?s as good as if
it was in your pocket. I stand to win five hundred on him. With that, and my
share of the gate-money, and a few other pickings, I shall be able to tot up about a
thousand pounds, and then good-bye to the West Coast and its golden shores.
Keep your eye on me, old chap, and just before the hurdle race see me. If anything
goes wrong I will be able to let you know. I don?t think Spinks will sell me. If
he does I?ll break his neck and, the first race just then starting, he hurried away,
whilst I hastened to get a good view of the Maiden Plate running, which opened
the meeting.
It is not worth my going into a long description of the different events a la
? Tout Cela?s ??glowing account that appeared the next day in the West Coast Times ;
suffice it to say, that the racing was about up to the average of a third-rate coun-
try meeting, and the two owners of the best horses netted good stakes. As I was
only interested in the hurdle race, their winnings or losings did not trouble me.
Just before the bell rang for the hurdle race, I sought and found Dicker, who was in
high glee, he having won over fifty pounds on the previous races, and asked him if
there had been any fresh developments re the Merrimac coup.
? None,? replied Dicker. ?It?s a moral certainty ; all over, as they say, but
the shouting. There are five starters left in it, but two of them are sure to come to
grief before the finish. I have just seen Spinks, and he tells me he can?t lose.?
?That?s all right, then,? said I; ?but I fancy there is something wrong,
somehow. I just passed old Benjamin as I came to meet you, and I heard him offer
to lay three hundred to fifty Merrimac couldn?t do it.?
Dicker looked anxious for a minute or so, and then said, with an oath, ? He?s
only bluffing so as to get a long price on him to make his book right. He has laid
heavily against him, and wants to get round. Don?t you be afraid, but lay out a
few more pounds on him. By Jove ! they?re oT!? and, rushing off, he was lost in
the crowd.
Sure enough, they were off, and by the time they had gone round about two-
thirds of the course, it did not take a very good judge to pick the winner. Merrimac,
splendidly ridden by his owner, Spinks, jumped like a cat, and made the pace so hot
that two of the horses came to grief at the last hurdle, leaving only three to finish,
who came in in the following order : ?Merrimac first, Don Pedro second, and West
Coast third. The winner and his rider were loudly cheered as they passed the
judge?s box.


I must here mention that the race was run in mile and a half heats, an interval
of ten minutes being allowed between them. Ihe jockeys were not allowed to dis-
mount until the whole three heats had been determined. Just before the second
heat started, Dicker, with his face beaming with triumph, came up to me and said,
holding out his hand, ? Put it there, Jeff; I told you it was a certainty.?
? Not quite,? I replied, shaking his proffered hand. ? There are two more
heats to be run off yet. ? There?s many a slip ? ?you know.?
? There will be no slip ihis time/ laughed Dicker, except the slipping up of
old Benjamin; he?ll be very hard hit if Merrimac comes off. By Jove ! there is the
old beggar talking to Spinks. No, you don?t, Benjy, my hoy. I can?t let you spoil the
potand, making a dart, he was soon alongside the horse Merrimac, the rider of which,
being engaged in a very animated conversation with old Benjamin, the Christchurch
bookmaker, I could see, from where I stood, that some high words were passing be-
tween them, and I also saw Dicker make a threatening motion towards Benjamin ; hut
the signal for the second heat being given, the police cleared the course and I was left
to conjecture what had passed between the three of them. Away the horses went
?the three of them? and for about half way round they were all pretty well together.
The next quarter of a mile saw West Coast out of it ; he had come a cropper, and,
sailing away in the most amicable manner, came Merrimac and Don Pedro. Mem-
mac, instead of putting a dozen yards or so between himself and his only competitor,
carefully giving Don Pedro a lead over his tences, and not attempting to get away
from him. 1 could see at once that my money was as good as lost, and that
squaring tactics had been resorted toby Benjamin to save himself, nor was I mistaken,
for Don Pedro, carefully coached over his fences, came in an easy winner after a pre-
tence of a finish on the part of Merrimac.
?I?ll back Don Pedro for the final,? was now the cry, and the whilom favorite,
Merrimac, fell at once to ten to one, without finding a solitary supporter.
?By God ! old man,? said Dickd, coming round behind me and seizing my aim,
?we are going to be sold. ? His face wa.-> white with passion, and, raising a heavy
walking suck he carried, he exclaimed, ? If Spinks sells me, I?ll break every bone in
his body. I?ll?l?ll?let us go and have a drink, Jeff,? said he abruptly, ?or I shall
be making a fool of myself.?
? How much do you stand to lose ?? 1 queried.
? More than 1 am ever likely to pay,? replied Dicker, with a ghastly attempt at
a smile; ? but I should land over a thousand if this came off; that is, altogether.?
?Why not see Spinks, and make it worth his while to win? I suppose he has


his price, and if you outbid Benjamin he will probably throw him over as easily as.
he appears to be selling you.?
? It wouldn?t be safe for me to go near him,? said Dicker, grasping his stick con-
vulsively ; ? I should knock him off his horse without listening to him. I feel pretty
certain he?s been got at by Benjamin. I caught them whispering together before the
last heat. You go over to him ; they will start in a few minutes, and lay him two
hundred to nothing he can?t win?l?ll pay.?
?All right,? said I; ?and I?ll lay him a hundred to nothing. That ought to
make it worth his while; and pushing my way through the crowd, I forced myself up
the side of Merrimac, who was surrounded by a crowd of people; there being no fence
or any protection from the crowd invading the course ; and making Spinks a sign that
I wanted to speak to him, he leant down his head and I whispered in his ear?
? D icker Hamilton and myself will lay you three hundred to nothing you can?t
win this heat.?
? Double the wager,? whispered Spinks with a grin, ? and I?m your Moses.?
?I must see Dicker first,? I said.
?You will have to be quick, then,? said he, ?for the race starts in about a
minute.?
Struggling through the crowd, I found Dicker, and told him Spinks? terms, adding
breathlessly that he must make up his mind at once, or it would be too late.
?Go and lay it,? groaned Dicker. ? I?ll get even with him. We can?t help
ourselves ; we had better save oUr own money if we can?t win anybody else?s. Run,
like a good fellow, or you will be too late.?
I did run, but before I could penetrate the crowd the hoarse cry of the people
told me the horses were off, and our money was as good as lost; so, returning to.
Dicker and telling him of my failure to save ourselves, we both took up a position,
where we could have a good view of the finish.
?All over .'??groaned Dicker, as Don Pedro, carefully piloted by Merrimac, took
his fences like a bird. ? It?s a regular swindle. I?ve been in a few myself, but never
such a barefaced one as this, and never stood in. Look at that d d Spinks
leading The Don over his fences, as if they were out for a morning?s exercise. If he
was to force the pace he could bring Pedro down at the next fence. The Don can?t
jump worth a cent, if he?s bustled. He can beat Merrimac on the flat, though, and I
suppose that will be their game, so as to make a race of it. What did I tell you??
continued he, excitedly, pointing to the two horses, who had only to negotiate two.


more hurdles to be in the straight run for home. ?They?re over ?look ! both together-
?now for the last jump! See Spinks giving Pedro a lead so as to land him in the
straight. It?s all over !? and with an oath, Dicker turned to mix up with the crowd*
when a sudden roar from them caused him to again cast his looks on the course.
? What?s this ?? said Dicker, fairly screaming with excitement. ?What? has the
pot boiled over ? Ha, ha !my noble Spinks, you must win, unless you tumble off your
horse ; and that won?t lose it, for I think The Don has broken his neck. Come along,.
Jeff; the biters have got bitten this time, and we have landed our wagers.?
It was quite true. Merrimac had won, though very much against his rider?s will.
In taking the last hurdle, which was built of strong post and rails, though not very high,
The Don had caught the top with his front feet and turned a complete somersault,
breaking his neck and seriously shaking his jockey. Spinks, who had lead over the last
fence to help Pedro to negotiate it, of course, landed in the straight; and if he had pulled
up and only walked in, he must have won it. He couldn?t possibly lose, having no
antagonist; but he was very crestfallen, it could easily be seen, by his victory, and
the public, who are generally keen in racing matters when it means a swindle, gave
him a volley of groans as he weighed in and afterwards sneaked off the course. Of
course we won our wagers, and Dicker was enabled to carry out his programme, as far
as returning to Victoria with his spoil, though I don?t think it did him much good, as I
met him on many occasions after, and we often had a laugh about the way the pot
boiled over at the first races that were ever held on the West Coast of New Zealand..
I need scarcely add that Sparks did not claim the wagers we laid him about his not
winning.

A Tale of the Hospital;
?Lovest Thou Me??
?Twasa child?s sweet face that lay pillowed there,
Crown?d with clust?ring rings of dark auburn hair,
Which lovingly strayed o?er the boyish brow
Which lies hidden deep ?neath the grave dust now ;
And those sparkling eyes of the deepest blue
Seemed lit with love as the soul locked through,
O 7
Whilst the wasted hand clasped a tiny case
Containing his mother?s dear pictured face.
And oft to his quiv?ring lips he prest
That photo of one who had loved him best,
Then raised those sweetest of eyes I?ve seen
Towards heaven where that mother so long had been
??Tis a pitiful case,? said nurse one day,
As I left the ward where the sufferer lay,
?And it makes me sad, ma?am, to see him there,
So patiently trying his pain to bear.
He was brought in here just a month ago,
From the river bend, where the willows grow.
On his road from school, so I heard them say,
He had seen a child and a dog at play
On the river bank ; heard a scream, a splash,
Then, quick as thought, or the lightning?s flash,
He gave one glance toward heaven, and smiled,
Then plunged in the river to save the child.


It rose to the surface?he grasped its coat ;
A moment more and an approaching boat
Brought them both to land, and with hasty tread
They were carried here ?you?d have thought them dead
But the other one soon revived ; he?s lain
On that bed, which I fear he?ll ne?er leave again.
He?s a darling child, and I often think,
As I watch him nearing the starry brink
Of the painless land, he can really see
His mother, for sometimes he?s said to me?
-4 Nurse, was I asleep, or did mother lean
O?er my bed just now ? Ah ! it must have been
Her voice that called me. I heard my name.
I called her, too; and I thought she came.
And an angel bright, who had wings of light,
And eyes that shone like the stars of night ;
But they?re not here now?there?s only you.
Oh, why ! oh, why didn?t they take me too? ?
I left the ward, and next time I went
Nurse told me that God had for Willie sent,
? And he bade me say, ma?am, these words to you,
Just before he died, a minute or two :
4 Tell the lady, nurse, that mamma and I
Will watch for her at the gates on high ;
And we?ll ask dear Jesus to lead her o?er
The river of death to glory shore.
And we?ll meet her there?say for sure we?ll wait
Till he brings her safe to the open gate.
I am going?good-bye. And the spirit fled
On the wings of faith from yon little bed.
And he?s reached, I know, yonder world of bliss,
Where again he?ll receive a fond mother?s kiss ;
Where, some day, I hope we shall with him be,
At His feet who has asked of each ? 4 Lovest thou me ???

THE CHRISTMAS TREE


Little Katie?s Christmas.
O that our childish dreams would at
And never fade away,
And that the glamour which they cast.
Would with us ever stay.
Lord ! how the Australian sun beat down mercilessly upon the begrimed and
dusty world that terrible Christmas day ; how the bush sweltered until even the gum"
trees blistered and withered. As for grass, there was none, and so the sun shone upon
a red expanse of earth, adding to the heat. Even the lizards, which are supposed to
stand any quantity of heat, were glad to crawl under logs and stones ; and the snakes
coiled themselves up in withered tufts, and forgot to bite. The mosquitoes themselves
lost their bloodthirstiness and were glad to seek some cool, underground spot, where they
ruminated upon the probabilities of the night, when they would have a good drink from
some ?fountain filled with blood? from the veins of some distracted human being#
There was little wind stirring; when a blast occasionally came it seemed as if from an
oven where a Cyclops was baking his bread?and a warm oven it must be. Such was
Christmas Day, 1876, at Boggy Creek, in one of the outlandish districts of Victoria.
Boggy Creek had once been a great mining place. In the days long past,,
thousands of miners had peopled its deserted banks, and the stir and bustle of human
life were there in all the glory and excitement of mining times. But the alluvial had
soon given out, and the miners had gone elsewhere. The fast-growing underwood of
Australia had soon covered the places where mining camps had been, and, save for the
innumerable shallow shafts, mostly caved in, which dotted the banks here and there, few
would be able to tell that in 1854 this had been one of the busiest places in Victoria?
that here Ashton?s and Burton's circuses had played with their bands and prospered?
that G. V. Brooke himself had paid a visit?and that the ? wood-notes wild ?of Catherine
Hayes had been heard in a great canvas tent which was called the ? Theatre Royal.
True it was, indeed, that ? Decay?s effacing fingers ? had worked havoc on Boggy Creek.


And yet it was a wonderfully picturesque spot, even under the arid sun of
December : the more picturesque that a civilised past mingled with a barbarian present.
It reminded one of some of those places where travellers can now find traces of great
?cities which existed three or four thousand years ago, whose people and history is
unknown, and whose inhabitants are wild, ignorant creatures, as unable to comprehend
the past as they are to ascribe those great monuments to anything except the work of
?demons and Dyhins. The similarity was the greater as Boggy Creek was not yet
deserted : a few stragglers still lived there. The flocks of the neighbouring squatter,
who from a poor man had become wealthy through the diggings, still fed on the spots
whence they had been driven in those days, unmolested even by the few ? butters ? who
vegetated on Boggy Creek, earning a few shillings a week in working ground that had
been turned over and over again, dreaming that one day they would fall across a deposit
of washdirt or a reef which would make them rich beyond the dreams of avarice!
Dreams, indeed ! Their possessions in this world would be limited to six feet by six on
some of the dreary, gravelly hill-sides.
One of these butters was named Henry Fisher by his parents, but the nomen-
clature of the Creek called him Fossicking Harry, because since the days of 1854 he had
never followed mining strictly, but had always been a restless being, who could not stick
to one claim for any length of time. Even then, when he was comparatively a young
man, he would wander over the hills and through the gullies in search of a ? bonanza,?
as the Americans call it. Harry had never found this bonanza. Perhaps the only slice
? of luck which had fallen to his share was that, when he was becoming a mere loafer,
a kind little creature, who was a servant at the principal hotel, fell in love with this wild-
looking, but still handsome, man, and married him, bringing more wealth to their little
cabin than Harry ever possessed since he came to the colony. For a time Harry tried
to be steady to please the ? wee wifey,? for she was a very wee thing indeed, not five
feet high, while Harry was six feet two, but his nomadic habits soon prevailed, and he
was soon on the tramp again. Not even the birth, in after years, of a little creature, the
counterpart of her mother?as sweet, as fair, as blue-eyed?kept Harry at home. lam
afraid he was a very bad kind of a hero. * I fear he spent the few shillings he picked up
in out-of-the-way gullies at the only shanty there was to be found at Boggy Creek. But,
Lord ! what will not woman?s love forgive ? To the day of her death Mary believed in
and loved her hnsband. It was twelve years ago, on such a hot, merciless day as this,
that Mary Fisher laid down her cross, and, pressing her husband?s hand, his last kiss on
her lips, her wee Katie pressed to her heart, passed away into the unknown land. Hers
bad not appeared to be a happy life, but God in his infinite mercy tempers the wind to


the shorn lamb, and the delicious love which had existed between the husband and wife
had been the silver lining to her dark cloud of existence.
So these two helpless creatures, the father?most helpless and childlike of the
two-and little Katie, were left alone. But for little Katie, Harry Fisher would have
gone mad. But a new life was infused into him by the desire to do something for his
daughter. Only it would have been better if he had chosen to do something for her in
another way. It would have been wiser not to leave the poor little girl alone, while searching
for big nuggets in the gullies and rich reefs in the mountains, neither of which were ever
found. It may well be imagined that the poor little thing had a terribly lonesome time
of it when ? daddy ? was away.
But she was a wise little child, and more like an old woman than a little girl.
She had evidently been taught to rely on herself, her father being so often away, her
mother so busy. And so, although she was only eleven years old, Katie was more
worldly wise and careful than her father, whose auburn hair was beo ' n g di patches.
The little elf took up all the household duties, and strove in every way to make her father
comfortable. She never murmured at the hard fare, the occasional privations; and she
made her father a better man. He never spent his few shillings now at the shanty he
gave them to Katie, who spent them in necessaries. Ihen she cultivated her little
garden so well that it supplied many a needed dish.
Although Katie had never gone to her school, her mother, who was fairly educated,
taught her daughter all she knew, and after Mary?s death Harry took up the task. His
happy hours were spent in teaching the witty child the higher branches of education, for
Harry had evidently been a gentleman, and was a great scholar. It would indeed seem
ridiculous to hear an old man in the bush teaching his daughter French and Latin, and
even a little of Greek, but Harry used to say that there was no telling what might
happen. He might discover a ? pot ? one day, or come into the inheritance of which he
had been unjustly defrauded, in consequence of which he had become a human waif.
But disease had at last seized upon the once strong form of Harry Fisher, and,
after a prolonged absence in the mountains during rainy weather, he returned in a fever.
And now on this hot Christmas Day he lay in a narrow bunk tossing about in a delirium,
in a stifling atmosphere, while his dutiful daughter strove, between her sobs and tears,
to cool his fevered brow. Anon she would marvel what to do, for the only money they
had in the world was one shilling. The hospital was ever so many miles away, and how
could she get him there ? Poor little Katie ! she was in sore trouble indeed, and she
could think of no way except by kneeling occasionally and praying in her simple childish
faith to the great Father who loves us all.


The day wore on, and the heat grew fiercer and fiercer, and the delirium of the
patient became greater. What a Christmas Day for a child to spend, with hardly any food,
with a sick parent and ahorrible fear of coming death and starvation. She could not even
go for help lest her father should start up and go into the bush. He alternately raved about
his relatives in England, the word u Father ? often occurring, and then he would speak
of the certainty of a great golden vein running through Rising Sun Hill, or a rich deposit
of washdirt being down in the Onti Gully. He would start up at times, and it took all
his daughter?s little loving ways to keep him on his pallet; and she knew that when the
delirium would increase, when he would not be able to recognise her, her efforts would
be of no avail. It was an awful moment
Gradually, as the day wore on, the heat overpowered Harry, and he fell into an
uneasy slumber, Katie looked at him in tears, and wondered whether this would last
i ntil she could go to Big Ben?s hut, two miles away. She wondered Ben had not come
to see them, but when she reflected that Ben was spending the day no doubt at Mother
Quinlan?s shanty, quaffing colonial ale, the wonder ceased. But his son, Jerry,surely
ought to have come; he ran once that way when he had a birthday. Jerry was a little
cider than Katie, and he was the only companion of her own time of life she had ever
had. He was such a kind, good little fellow, and made her presents of wild ducks
whenever he shot any, which often eked out the larder.
As the girl thought, the overpowering heat of the day worked, and soon the
golden head sank down upon the sufferer?s pillow, and the little soul wandered away
into the realms of dreams, happy as the visions of the miserable always are, thank God !
She thought that the ruined hut vanished from her gaze, and that in its place arose
a fairy palace, such as she had read of in books, surrounded with green-leaved trees on
which hung golden fruit, and running streams of the clearest coldest water. Birds sang,
music sounded, and the sky was of the deepest blue, edged with amber. Oh ! what a
glorious change, compared with the desecrated landscape she had left. Many beautiful
creatures of the loveliest forms, and with golden wings, fluttered about, welcoming her
to the home of happiness. They brought her to a bower where everything was
deliciously cool, and there treated her to a thousand luxuries, many of which she had
never seen, but all so sweet and toothsome. She thought that to live here was to be
happy for ever. It seemed to her that for days and days she lived there without a change;
the same light, the same music, the same pleasures, yet never palling upon her senses.
One day a glorious being, who eclipsed all the others, appeared, and, taking the
child by the hand, he asked her if she was happy.


? Perfectly happy, ? she replied ; and yet as she said so she felt as if there was a
great void, as if something was wanting, even in that brilliant place.
? Is there none of your desires ungratified ? ? asked the Intelligence.
? None,? she said, but more doubtingly.
? Do you know the name of this country ? ? he asked
? No.?
? Then, child, leave it. The name is selfishness. Here, no one thinks but of
themselves ; hence those qualities known elsewhere as love, self-denial, and duty have no
existence.?
Something was struggling in her breast; she began to feel that she was not doing
right. Suddenly a light shot into her mind. Her father, Jerry, the world, she had left.
She burst into bitter tears. In her own happiness she had forgotten the poor creature
she had left on a sick-bed. O, how could she be so cruel ? And, strange as it was, the
brilliance of the palace seemed to fade, the trees to lose colour, the gay inhabitants to
darken and grow ugly
?My father,? she cried. ? I wish he were here; I love him, I love him.?
There was a great noise as if the heavens had burst, and on looking around she
was terrified to see that the whole beautiful scene had vanished ; the trees became stunted
?their fruit poisonous berries, the fairies changed into hideous newts and efts, and the
grand palace into a mean hovel. The only one who did not alter was the Being who had
spoken to her; he seemed to grow more glorious than ever.
? Child,? said he ; you have become a human being once more, you nave obeyed
the call of love and duty, and they will be your reward. Let the lesson be engraven
upon your mind throughout your life. Awake ! Farewell. ?
Katie awoke and rubbed her eyes. The beams of the evening sun fell upon the
bed, and at the door stood Jerry, in company with two strangers, in one of whom she
recognised the kind doctor who had attended her mother in her last illness.
?Katie, Katie!? cried Jerry. ?Here?s two gentlemen (Jerry never troubled
about grammar) who bring good news, such news.?
? Hush, boy,? said the doctor, coming forward. ? Katie, child, he is right. Is
your father asleep ? ?
?Ha ! ? cried Harry, sising on his elbow'. ? Are you there, Dr. Good? Take
care of my child when lam gone. I??
? Nonsense,? cried the doctor, taking the patient?s hand. ? There?s lots of life
in you yet, Mr. Fisher. You only want attention and some nourishing food. Do you
see this gentleman ? ?


The stranger who had hithertofore kept in the background came forward.
? John ! ? cried the patient. ? John ?No, no. I am dreaming. lam going mad.?
?Not at all,? said the visitor, catching the warm hand. ?I am John, your
brother John, who has found you after months of search. Your father was resolved to
see you ere he died, and I was sent to find you. All is forgiven and forgotten, except
that you are my brother, his son.?
?Oh God ! ? cried Harry. ? And I thought thou had?st forgotten me.?
And the strong man burst into tears, which perhaps did him more good than any
medicine.
? And this is my little niece,? said John, catching the thin little form in his arms,
and kissing Kate. ? There, child, you need never fear want again. I see it in your face.?
? But,? oh uncle ! ? said Katie, ? I will always love my father and do my duty.?
And we hope all children will make the same resolve,
DONALD CAMERON.


A Tale of the Snow.
Gay cities, woodlands, fields, and hills,
Stood draped in sheets of flossy white ?
King Winter?s garb of Snow. The heavens above
Were dark : nor star nor moon stole through the gloom;
A north-east wind, in piercing gusts, blew wild
The ponds, canals, were surfaced thick with ice.
The time was verging on the midnight hour,
As I strode through London?s snow-clad streets ;
I saw before me, black, and weird, and grim,
St. Paul?s great dome, standing against the gloom ;
And, as I walked, twelve measured sounds
Struck on the ear, which told to me the death
Of the old year, and birth day of the new.
As the sound of the last stroke became no more,
A hundred churches? bells rang merrily,
Proclaming life?s entry on one more New Year ;
My heart grew light as listening to the chimes,
Elastic was my step, my thoughts were free,
gaily moved along, when suddenly
I heard a piteous wail, an infant?s cry:
It took me to the spot from whence it came
And in a corner of an archway lay,
Pale and wan, a shivering woman?s form ;
Unto her breast she pressed her crying babe.
I spoke in accents kindly as I could,
And asked why she, a night like this, was there.
Her answer came in meek and trembling words ?
? I have no other shelter in the world;
No home, no friends, no kith, no kin, no soul
To turn to, save my little sickly child.?
Her soft and gentle voice to me portrayed


That she was other than of lowly birth.
My heart was filled with pity, for her lot
Was truly abject: that pale, pinched face,
Those sunken cheeks, that time-worn dress of rags
Told truer than words her wretched state.
Each moment?s talk fed interest's flame.
At length, I asked to know of her past life.
11 Your tender words have made my aching heart
Again feel glad, and though 'twill cost me pangs
I?ll tell to you the past of my sad life :
When but a merry, buoyant girl at school,
I met a man, a wealthy merchant?s son ;
His handsome face and silvery tongue soon stole
My heart away. I knew him but eight weeks,
When he begged, implored me to quit the school
And be his wife; he told me of the sweets
That would bedeck my life if I were his.
I, young and innocent, placed trust in him
And ran away from school?became his wife.
A little we were happy in our lot;
But soon his heart grew cold, love?s lamp burned dim ;
For days, for weeks, he went from wife, from home,
To feast on dissipation,f mid a throng
Of gayest, wildest revellers in town.
His mind and body soon began to fade ;
His cheeks grew pale, his eyes their lustre lost.
One short twelve months robbed him of wealth and life
And gave to me a widow?s weed?an outcast?s doom.
From then till now my heart has known but woe.?
This woman?s dreadful tale struck deep my heart,
Which with compassion quickly filled, and as
I took her hand and bade her my good night
I left behind a New Year?s gift which made
Her face to glow, her eyes to fill with tears.
Albert G. Dawes.


ON THE BRIDGE


A Christmas Sweep
One of my wife?s chief annual joys is to have all the youngsters round her at
Christmas time ; and on that day wild horses wouldn?t drag her from her own
hearthstone. But the cleaning and clearing up. Oh dear, it made my heart-
strings ache. I spent the seven days before the 18th almost continuously at my
club.
It was on Wednesday night, that is to say, the 18th of December, that I
arrived home late after a heavy supper with one or two convivial friends, and with
the extra special Gutter Gazette, which I had bought out of mere curiosity, in my
pocket.
I sat down to read. The principal article was a fierce attack on Sir Henry
Parkes.
The now stale story of the ? Soudan Goat ? had been hashed up afresh, and as
I read it and dozed over the fire the image of a vicious black negro seemed to
haunt me. Why, oh why, had Sir Henry made this speech, and given the envenomed
pen of gutter scribes the opportu ?
? Tom, are you going to sit reading there all night ??
Recalled to myself, I was soon undressed and in the ? land of nod.?
But, oh ! what a travesty of sleep. Ever and anon huge black ghouls hovered
over me. In the dim distance I could see the Premier combatting tooth and nail
with a Soudanese ; while the stentorian tones of another one in the distance in-
formed me ? that I was to be the next,? whatever that might mean.
I awoke with streams of perspiration pouring down my face. I spoke to Maria
to see if she were awake, but receiving no answer, kicked out and found I was alone
in bed. Maria had flown.
I jumped out and struck a match. It was six a.m., a most unusual hour for my
wife to be up. Something had doubtless happened.
At this instant I heard a dismal voice?a horrid, rasping voice?talking down-
stairs.
? It is burglars,? said I, ? and Maria has been sacrificed.?
Seizing the bedroom poker, after groping about in the fender for some seconds,
I glided downstairs just in time to see a form stealthily leaving the kitchen with a
huge bag upon his back.
In the dim light coming from the window above the passage door, I perceived


that he was a black man. In an instant my hideous dream recurred to me ; and I
felt that I had had a warning, but that it had come too late to save Maria.
In less time than it takes me to write this, I had grappled with the fiend, and
seized him by the throat. Brandishing the poker above his head, I bade him drop
his bag.
He did so, and?? Sglosh?h?m !oh !? I was nearly stifled. At the same
moment Maria and the servant emerged full pelt from the kitchen to know what
was the meaning of the altercation.
In a moment I saw that I had made a fool of myself.
It was the sweep, and the bag of soot he had dropped had made me almost as.
black as himself.
Oh ! what a clatter there was. The moment I had released his throat, he in
formed me ? that he would have the law on me for this,? and I shouldn?t be sur-
prised if he keeps his word.
After I had retired helter-skelter upstairs, and taken off my sooty pyjamas, 1
dressed hastily and rushed down to apologise and explain ; but he was gone, with
the indignant remark ? that if gents got drunk and misbehaved theirselves, they?d
find there was sich a place as the police court ; and that sweeps wasn?t to be treated
like wild cats with a good deal more to the same purpose.
As for Maria, I really thought at first she?d have gone quite mad. The soot
(nearly half a hundred-weight) had gone flying all over the house. It had covered
everything. The ingredients for the big Christmas pudding, in a huge pan, had a
thick layer at least two inches deep ; the mince-meat was completely hidden ; and
the kitchen floor was like the wood pavement of Melbourne after a dusty morning.
The wreck was fearful.
Maria, after exhausting her vituperative energies on me, wound up with a good
cry, and then declared she felt better.
As for me, I found the thing was too complicated to explain, so I gave it up,.
and resigned myself to the sure and certain fate of being nagged, badgered, and
bullied until the boys came home, when the little imps so completely filled up theii
mother?s time that she very soon forgot it.
I ha 1 just received a summons to attend the police court for that ?I did, with
malice aforethought, attack, assault, and grievously molest one Thomas Muggs, to
wit a chimney-sweep, of Post Office Place, with the intent to do him grievous,
bodily harm. Wherefore, fail not at your peril.?
Well, I never ! Perhaps, after all, I shall spend my Christmas in gaol.


Curry
Not because her eyes were bright,
Or yet because her hair was light ;
Not because her hands were small,
Or because she had a stature tall ?
I married.
Not because her breath was sweet
(Her waist was small, likewise her feet);
Not because she talked of love,
And called me sweet, and duck, and dove ?
I married.
Not because her teeth were white
(My dimpled chin she?d often bite) ;
Not because she dressed with taste,
Or yet because my lass tight-laced ?
I married.
Not because I liked her style,
And liked to see her pretty smile;
Not because I blush to tell
My present wife kissed me so well ?
I married.


Not because I liked hei ma.
Her brother James, or dear papa ;
Not because her lips were red;
Not because I wished to wed?
I married.
But because t knew full well
(To tell the truth, I blush to tell),
If given time, if in no hurry,
My wife could make a splendid curry,
That dish to me so sweet, so nice,
Served up with lemon, quince and rice :
It?s on our table every meal
(To-night I think ?tis curried teal) ;
If Curry your girl can make, don?t tarry,
Run straight away, dear boys, and marry.
Anon


Little Mary and the Snowflakes
? Come, Mary, my darling, come, see all the snow ;
The streets are all white, love, wherever you go ;
It covers the ground, like a carpet, all o?er ;
No foot has yet trodden its surface so pure,?
The day was but dawning when Mary, just three,
Was borne to the window, the snowflakes to see.
? Oh ! pa,? lisped the darling, ?who put it all there ??
?Our Father, in Heaven ?His dwelling is there.?
The flakes were still falling and whirling around,
O?ermantling the house-tops, the trees and the ground.
? Oh ! pa, dear,? said Mary, ? pease do show me where
Is the window Dod opens to let it down here.
And where does He get all the bootiful snow ?
Will He have any left when I up to Him go ?
Does He let the dear children, and angels too, play
With the snowflakes in Heaven? Oh ! say, papa, say.?
? My darling, the snowflakes and sunbeams that fall
From Heaven to earth are God?s gift to us all;
But eye hath not seen, for the veil is not riven,
The gifts He?s prepared for His children in Heaven.

[;-3WINTER IN ENGLAND.


The Professor of Music
[The following has been sent me by ? Maldonia,? that clever writer well known in literary
?circles, who vouches for the truthfulness of every word in the following ? The Mrs. B. who
chines in this page,? Maldonia writes, ?is an ignorant woman who has probably not ever seen a
piano before she left her home. ? Sophy,? like her sisters and brothers, enjoyed a State School
?education.]
parents had at last managed to buy me a piano.
Whilst I sat one evening at the long-wished for instrument (for I was
passionately fond of music), striking now one note, now another, and wondering
when I should get a teacher and how long it would be ere I could play as well
as that Miss Jones, a ring of the house-bell made me strike ten keys at one time,
and hard too, so that the new comer was sure to hear we had a piano, when
suddenly the door of the room our piano was in opened and before me stood
Mrs. B. and three of her daughters.
Before I relate the conversation which took place between me and that lady,
I must make you acquainted with her appearance and manner in as few a words as
possible.
Mrs. B. is a short, stout woman, the wife of a thriving shop-keeper in this
city, always fashionably dressed, fond of society, endeavouring to make people
believe that she is fairly well educated, whilst really not able to spell her own name
far less write it. She may be seen at such gatherings as prorogation and opening of
Parliament, Mayoress?s receptions, and the other day tried to gain entrance to a
Government house affair. This illusions lady, I must not forget to add, is foreign.
?Veil, mine dears, I was not mistaken. Av course it is an piano,? she said to
h er daughters ; then turning round to me she continued, ?So you got an pianoforty ,


you must be glad, you always wished for it. So your ma is not in. Veil, I got no
look mit her, I moost say.?
? No she is not at home,? I answered (she was never at home for her).
? Veil, you can tell her vot I vonted to see her. I heer you got a introment; I
got a girl vot can teach it. You tell your ma she should not get a master; my Sophy
vill teach you.?
Sophy, who stood near, ventured to say ?? Mother, I should be only too happy,
but I don?t feel competent enough yet.?
? Holt your tonk, you ; I tink you out to play and can teach for de money I
paid your teachers.?
Turning to me once more, she said.
? Never mine ; she vill teachen you ; but before you make up your mine you
moost promisen me dat you vill get up every morning a five o?clock to practisen.
Never mine what de neighbours say ; if you vont to stody you most not stody
them. I drag my girls out of de bets every morning at four o?clock. Nevermind
vot de people says. And before you begin to learn you moost promisen me vhen
you practice you must always cant (count) von, too, tree ; you hear ??
?Oh, mother, her teacher will explain all to her.?
?Yes de eggs is always cleverer den de hens.?
Being anxious to bring our interview to a close, I said?? It is exceedingly
kind of you, Mrs. 8., to have made me such an offer. I shall tell mother as soon as
she returns.?
?Allright, my girl; let me know vhen you vont to commence.?
? Thank you very much,? I said as I accompanied my visitors to the front gate,
the old lady again taking my hand and saying?? You vont forget, cant von, too,
tree, von, too, tree.?
It is needless to say Mrs. B. is still waiting fora reply to her offer.

Lost in the Bush.
A TRUE STORY.
AR away in the heart of the great Australian Bush, where the tall gums stand
stiff and straight, with their dark hlueish green leaves and spicey breath ?
rwraflaj w here the golden wattle and trailing white clematis perfume the summer
air, and the graceful ferns wave cool and green, stood the little log cottage where
lived the heroine of my story, Jenny Heath.
Far, far away from the crowded cities and busy haunts of men was the selection
of David Heath and the home of little Jenny. Jenny had never seen any of the
great towns of the South. She had lived all her life in the bush, and had never
travelled further than a few miles from her father?s clearing to the neighboring town-
ship, which consisted of a store, a public house and a few small dwellings. So
Jenny?s ideas of the world were very limited , though she would have very much liked
to have seen the fine cities she had heard her father and mother talk about, with their
broad streets and handsome shops, and all the beautiful things that could be purchased,
if you only had the money to buy them.
It was a fine afternoon at the end of Deceffiber. Only three more days, and
Christmas would be here, which is quite as much a day of rejoicing in the selector?s
cottage in the lonely bush, as in the wealthy merchant?s stately mansion in the
beautiful suburbs of Melbourne.
Mrs. Heath had been busy all the morning making cakes and puddings for the
coming event, and Jenny had been helping to stone the raisins, wash the currants,
beat the eggs, and doing any other little things to assist her mother; but now all was
finished, dinner was past, the little cottage had been tidied up, the children?s faces
washed, hair combed, clean pinafores put on, and Jenny?s work was over for the
day.
There were three hours yet to spare before tea time, and Jenny sat on the door
step in her pink calico sun-bonnet, casting over in her mind how she should amuse
herself until father came home.
At length a bright thought struck her, and going into the room where her
mother was sewing she said


?Mother, may we go and gither ferns for Christmas Day?? The children
were in the habit of adorning the few cheap prints on the walls in this fashion to
commemorate the birth of their dear Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.
?Yes, if you like, dear, but be sure that you do not go far from home; it?s
getting late, Jenny,? replied Mrs. Heath.
?Oh, no, mother; I?ll take good care,? and Jenny skipped off to find her
little brother and sister.
?Come, Bennie,? she said, ?we are going to gather ferns for Christmas.?
? Me go too? ? asked baby Susie.
? Yes, Susie shall go to,? and calling out ? Good-bye, mother,? the young trio set
off hand in hand to seek the choicest specimens of the feathery plants that grow so
luxuriantly in our native forests.
How delightful it was to wander through the long grass, treading carefully for
fear of snakes, the gum trees and acacias lending a grateful shade overhead.
Here they stopped to watch a ?possum that popped its cunning in fie head out of
a fallen trunk that lay across their path. Bennie would fain have loitered to hunt the
little creature, but the place where the ferns grew most plentifully was further off yet, so
there was no time to spare for ?possum hunting to-day. There a guana glided along,
with its scaly skin of shining bronze glittering in the sun, and away fly the children in
its track, but only to lose sight of it disappearing behind a clump of thick scrub.
Again they paused to pluck the pink and blue wild flowers that lay scattered at inter-
vals among the grass at their feet, the ones close at hand being passed by to obtain
what looked in the distance to be a far greater prize, but which on inspection was again
rejected for ? another beauty ? still further away. They must just gather that one I
and so the time passed unheeded, and their destination was still unreached.
Slowly the sun began to sink like a great ball of fire in the west, all unnoticed
by the children. The gully where the ferns grew was close at hand now, so on they
trudged, thinking only of the bright green treasures they were in search of. At length
the spot was reached, and the little ones ran to collect the graceful maiden hair and
other varieties that grew beneath mimic rocks, or spread their large leaves from the
thick brown stem of the fern tree. Soon their hands were quite full, and they were
ready to turn their steps homeward.
?It?s getting dark,' Jenny,? said Bennie, after they had walked a short distance
in the direction of home.
?Oh! we shall be home long before dark,? answered Jenny reassuringly, but


quickening her pace as she spoke, for the evening shadows were creeping steadily on,
and though fearless, as a child born and bred in the bush should be, she sell a nervous
apprehension stealing over her as the last rays of the sun faded from the sky, leaving
only the dim misty grey of the Australian twilight, which in so short a space of time
deepens into the blackness of night.
On, on they went, but Jenny could no longer conceal from herself the fact that
they were being fast overtaken by the night. It was getting pitch dark ; how should
they find their way home? She could scarcely see a yard ahead, and little Susie was
beginning to complain of feeling weary. What was to be done ?
But Jenny was a brave little girl, and she would not give way to her fears, for the
sake of her little brother and sister, so she tried to cheer up Bennie, who was crying
now, and lifted Susie up in her arms to ease the little tired feet that refused to carry
their small burden any further.
They had by this time come to a fork in the road where several paths branched
off, one leading to their own house, the others going devious ways.
Jenny?s heart sank within her ?supposing she should mistake the track ? She
stood uncertain, not daring to proceed; in the dim light it was so difficult to discern
which was the one that led in the direction of home.
For a moment only she paused; she must not hesitate any longer; this must be
the right track ! It was impossible that she could mistake the way. She had so often
walked along that path to the fern-tree gully; so, plunging into the dusty little beaten
track, they were soon pursuing their journey, but with dread misgivings on Jenny?s
part, and sobs and lamentations from the two younger ones. Bennie was ? frightened
to be out in the dark !? Poor little Susie lifted up her voice, crying for ? mamma !?
What would not Jenny have given to have seen the light glimmering in the window of
their little cottage ; but there was no ray of light beaming on their way. All was dark,
very dark, and a terrible conviction was forcing itself on Jenny?s mind that the path
she had taken was the wrong track.
She could see none of the familiar landmarks ! How late it was getting, and
Bennie and Susie wanted something to eat. Jenny was in a dreadful state of alarm !
She was hungry and tired too ! But what was that compared with being lost in the
bush? Alas! Jenny knew now that that was very likely to be their fate, unless
rescued by her father or some of the neighbors. It was useless to proceed any
further ;it was only making the distance greater from home. She would pray to God
to take care of them, and then wait patiently until some one found them. Jenny felt


somewhat comforted after this reflection, for she had been piously brought up, and
knew that her Father in Heaven could guard them safely through the terrors of the
night, and she trusted Him with all her heart.
So Jenny persuaded the little ones to lie down on the soft grass, and, overcome
with hunger and fatigue, they soon cried themselves to sleep. It was hours before
Jenny could follow their example. She sat and watched for a long, long time, hoping
relief would come, but at last, wearied out with her sad vigil, she sank down beside
Bennie and Susie, and when the moon rose it looked down upon three Australian
babes in the wood, locked in each other?s arms, and slumbering as peacefully as if they
were cradled in their own little cribs, tucked in by mother?s careful hands; for He who
neither slumbers nor sleeps was bending over them, and bright angels lingered near
them to guard their sleeping heads.
Listen ! there is crackling in the dry timber! Jenny starts up with lips apart,
and eyes fixed in the direction of the sound. Surely, by the light of the moon she can
distinguish forms moving in the distance ! � Father ! Father! ? she calls as loud as
she can shout. Yes, someone is coming this way ! �l Coo-e-e ! Coo-e-e ! ? she hears
the welcome sound. ? Coo-e-e ! Coo-e-e!? responds Jenny in her clear childish tones.
A dog barks ! The footsteps come nearer. She calls again, ? Father ! Father ! It is
no illusion! She sees her father advancing towards her. ? Wake, Bennie ! Wake,
Susie!? she cries, shaking her little brother and sister to rouse them. ?Father?s
coming!? and Jenny, Bennie, and Susie are clasped to their father?s heart. Saved!
restored once more to their fond parents arms. _
There was great rejoicing in David Heath?s cottage when he and the neighbors
who had volunteered to help him in his search for the lost children arrived carrying
their precious burdens, and thankful hearts were lifted up in prayers of thanksgiving to
the One who in His goodness had guided their footsteps to the spot where little Jenny
and her brother and sister lay slumbering so peacefully in the ? stilly night in the
lonely Australian bush. .
All this happened very many years ago, and Jenny and Bennie and Susie are
young men and women now, with, I date say, little children of their own ; but if they
should happen to read my story they will not fail to recognise this true account of the.r
early days, for, as the title shows, it is no fiction but is founded on fact.

She?s only a mite of a baby, ?tis true,
With large, melting eyes of a violet hue,
A sweet rosebud mouth, and such soft, dimpled cheeks
A treasure we?ve had with us not many weeks.
One scarce can believe it that such a wee elf
Could win such a wealth of love all for itself ;
For she?s only a baby, the sweetest we?ve seen,
And this dear little mite reigns amongst us as queen.
She?s only a mite of a baby, Tis true,
But sweet as the flowers when kissed by the dew,
And pure as the snowflakes that fall from the sky,
Or pearls that in caverns of ocean yet lie.
Oh ! may she, as time on fleet wings flies apace,
Possess every virtue and beauty and grace ;
Then shall she, this sweetest, best baby we?ve seen
Still reign here amongst us, her loved ones, a queen.
She?s only a mite of a baby, ?tis true,
But dearer to me, and my dear wifie too,
Than aught else contained in this world far and wide,
For in her we?ve centred our heart?s fondest pride.
Oh ! who could believe that this darling so small
Could make us her worshippers each one and all ;
For she?s only a baby, the sweetest we?ve seen.
And the dear little mite reigns amongst us a queen.

THE FIRST-BORN


Ivy Raynor?s Christmas
HRISTMAS greetings and congratulations were being exchanged on all sides.
The shop windows were gay with Christmas cards and gifts. Bright little
1- faces grew grave with wonder as they pondered over what that most
beneficent being to childhood, Santa Claus, would bring in his sack this
year in the shape of toys and presents. Five-year-old Willie whispered in confidence
to mama, ? He wanted a steam engine that would go just like a real one; did she
think Santa Claus would know all about it?? While tiny May lisped at her nightly
prayers, ? Please, Tanta Taus, bing May a dolly as bid as de baby.? And mama and
papa plotted in secret, when curly heads were laid at rest, how they might best gratify
the desires of their darling?if funds would permit the expensive plaything that Willie
had set his affections on, or where a doll was to be obtained as ?bid as de baby ? for
golden-haired May. Merry Christmas ! Happy Christmas !?the festive season was
at hand, ushered in by warm, sunny days and beauteous flowers, rich with color and
perfume, fit emblems of Him whose mission was to teach ? Peace on earth, good-will
to men.?
In the schoolroom at one of the most fashionable ladies?, seminaries in Melbourne,
a group of merry maidens was gathered together, discussing plans for the future ; of
the bright prospects that awaited them, when, freed from the trammels of school
discipline, they should indulge in all the gaieties that their elder and more fortunate
sisters were privileged to enjoy.
Foremost in the group was bright, sparkling Lillian Fay, the pet of the whole
school, and just at this moment the envy of all. This was Lillian?s last quarter. On
the morrow she would bid adieu to etymology, syntax, and prosody for ever, and it was
on her account this social gathering had been arranged?a ? vale party,? as the girls
called it, and which they were always in the habit of giving when any special favorite
was about to leave their midst.
? Girls,? said Lillian, during a pause in the Babel around, ? I have a proposition
to make. Let?s ask Miss Raynor to join us. She has looked so miserable ever since
the holidays were talked of that I feel quite sorry for her. It might cheer her u t *> a


bit if we invited her to come down. Do you know,? and Lillian?s voice grew very
serious, ? I don?t believe she has anywhere to go for the vacation.?
? Oh, Lillian!? was the response uttered in all sorts of keys, astonishment
predominating. To these gay young creatures, filled with the delightful anticipations
of going home, or pleasant visits to dear friends, the idea of anyone being so utterly
forlorn as to be obliged to spend her holidays at Cramem Villa was simply atrocious.
i< Well, do you consent ?? continued Lillian, waiting for a more explicit reply,
tt of course, Lillian, as you are the guest of the evening, we shall be happy for
you to invite whom you please,? returned Hetty Field, the eldest of the party, and who
was generally chief spokeswoman ; ? but don?t you think she will be just a little hit in
the way ? I don?t believe in asking the governess to our private assemblies. It?s an
infringement of the rules, you know,? finished up Hetty, severely.
?Now, Hetty,? replied Lillian, coaxingly, ?you know better than that ! Miss
Raynor is as nice and sweet as can be ?she won?t interfere in the least with our fun,
and Lillian, without giving time for anyone else to object, was out of the room and
flying two steps at a bound up the stairs to Miss Raynor?s apartment.
Very gentle and mild was the voice which bade Lillian enter, and a face as fair
and almost as youthful as her own, but with the shadow of a sorrow upon it, was lifted
up to meet Lillian?s beaming smile as she made her request. There was nothing about
Ivy Raynor of the angular, sour-visaged school teacher : a class that is dying out fast,
and let us thank Providence, for the sake of the coming generation, that it is so !
?You are very kind, dear,? said Miss Raynor, in reply to Lillian?s invitation,
?but lam afraid that my presence would not add to your amusement. lam not very
lively company, Lillian, and I feel unusually dull to-night. Give my love to the other
girls, dear, and tell them I hope they will have a pleasant time.?
But Lillian was not to be put off in this fashion. She had a warm, loving
disposition, and her sympathies had been readily called forth on behalf of the quiet,
reserved music mistress. She tried her utmost powers of persuasion, but all to no avail.
Ivy was obdurate, and Lillian returned to the schoolroom rather crestfallen and dis-
appointed ; she had been so anxious to tiy and dissipate some of the gloom which
appeared to hangover Miss Rayno.?s sad young life. ?Never mind,? she said to
herself, ? I?ll try another plan, and I think I shall succeed this time.
As the door closed on Lillian, Ivy Raynor buried her face in her hands, and
anguished sobs shook her slight frame, and scalding drops fell thick and fast. The
long pent-up feelings burst forth uncontrolled at this graceful little action of Lillian?s


?the first and only kindly notice she had received since she had entered Cramem
Villa as music teacher. Long months of sorrow and neglect had never affected her as
did this little act of thoughtfulness. Ah ! Lillian, simple though it was, the record is
written on high among more widely-spread deeds of Christmas love.
Only two short years ago and life had been so very pleasant to Ivy, the idolised
child of a dealing father, the beloved of a noble heart?so she fondly imagined poor
8- '
Now all was changed ! Her father had been carried off suddenly. ? Apoplexy?
the do L . rs had said, but when his affairs were looked into it was discovered that he
had specu uted largely, and lost his all. Those who knew him best shook their heads
at the doctors? verdict. They knew, then, what had caused the old man?s death, and
so Ivy was left an orphan and penniless. Her knowledge of music? .she was a brilliant
and educated performer?stood her in good stead when adversity came upon her, and
she had considered herself fortunate in securing the position she held at Cramem Villa
where she had been installed for the past eighteen months, friendless and alone?.
Experience soon taught Ivy the friendship of the world. When most she needed them,
the acquaintances of her prosperous days ? passed by on the other side,? and there was
none to help her.
But Ivy?s greatest trial was yet to come. The love she thought so true had
proved faithless. On such a night as this she had parte f wit!) Hubert Kean for the last
time, and she had never heard from or seen him since. Could she have misinterpreted
his looks and words of love? No, no; she felt he did love her; but why had he
behaved so strangely ? There was nothing to account for it. ?Itis my fate,? moaned
Ivy, as others had done before her.
The gift that Hubert had placed in her hands as he wished her a merry Christmas
with the words, ?Read your favorite poem before you sleep to-night, Ivy,? lay still un-
opened in her box. Her father had come in complaining of not feeling well the
beginning of the end?and by some mishance one of those apparently trifling accidents
occurred which so often change the whole tenor of .a life : the parcel had been laid
aside, the poem unread. Yes, there it lay still unopened. Afterwards, Ivy had never
dared to cut the cord that bound the wrappings, to look at the contents. She had
tried so hard to banish all recollections of her lost love; she would not trust herself
to behold the familiar writing which she knew would greet her on the fly-leaf. But
now, touched by Lillian?s kindness, some softer influence seemed creeping over her.
Perhaps she might even find consolation in the very pages so long sealed to her.


Ivy rose from her seat and took the parcel from its resting place. With tremb-
ling fingers she untied the knot; the brown paper cover fell aside, disclosing a hand-
somely bound edition of Coleridge. She turned the leaves to find the sweet idyl
? Love.?' But what is this marking the place ? A note lies folded between the pages.
Ivy?s heart beats violently, and she was so agitated she could scarcely see to read the
contents. Only a few lines, but in them Hubert Kean confessed his great love for her,
beseeching her to send him word the following day whether she returned his affection.
If he did not hear from her he should conclude she had no love for him and would never
see her more. At last, the whole truth, when, alas! too late, had been revealed. Why
had she allowed the book to remain lying unopened these two long weary years ? Why,
oh why ? Vain reproach, Ivy. Others have questioned themselves in the self-same
manner, and as fruitlessly. And now Hubert was gone from her for ever, and she knew
where not to seek him. Gone ! thinking her unkind and cruel, when she would have
given her life for him.
Merry Christmas ! Happy Christmas ! What a mockery! thinks Ivy as she
watches far into the night with aching brow and tear-dimmed eyes.
?Mother, dear, won?t you ask Miss Raynor to spend Christmas with us??
? Who?s Miss Raynor, Lillian ??
? The music-teacher at school, mother. Don?t you remember me speaking of
her before??
? Now that you remind me, Lillian, I do think that I remember the name
? Well, then, you?ll write this morning, won?t you, mother ??
? I think I had better leave that for you to do, Lillian.?
? Oh, no, mother mine ! She?ll be sure to come if you invite her, and I?ve set my
heart on having her here for the holidays. She?s so lonely, mother.?
This appeal had its effect immediately on Mrs. Fay, a kind, motherly little
woman. She had a heart overflowing with human nature, and the fact of anyone
being ? lonely ? at Christmas time was not to be permitted for a moment while she could
make them welcome at Yarranong.
? Very well, Lillian,? she replied, ? bring me pen, ink and paper, and I will
write on the spot.?
? That?s my own good little mother!? cried Lillian, giving her a fond kiss, as she
ran off for the writing materials.
When Mrs. Fay?s delicately worded note was delivered to Ivy at Cramem Villa,
it came as a very pleasant surprise.


A change to the bush, the free, glorious bush, would be so grateful to the poor,
tired music-mistress, jaded and worn out with the perpetual drumming of crochets and
quavers into heads that were quite the reverse of ? sharp,? and fingers that persistently
refused to be anything but ? flats.? Oh, Euterpe ! what crimes are committed in thy
name ! Daily, hourly, murder of exquisite strains and enchanting melodies ! Shades of
the immortal dead ! why do ye not arise and prosecute the perpetrators, and ? deliver
us ? from further ? evil ! ?
? Good news, Miss Raynor,? said Lillian dancing up to Ivy a few days after her
arrival at Yarranong. Fred is coming home to-night, and is bringing a gentleman
with him whose acquaintance he made in Queensland. According to Fred, he is a
perfect paragon, handsome, intellectual, and I don?t know what all; so we must impress
him favorably. Who knows but one of us might captivate this Adonis ! ? and with a
gay laugh Lillian was gone to make herself ? beautiful,? she declared.
There was a loud noise at the door announcing Master Fred, and a general rush
into the hall to meet the son and heir of the house.
Ivy, left by herself, could hear the fond words of welcome, and Fred?s cheery
voice as he replied to the eager questioning of the loved ones from whom he had been
parted more than twelve months, but had come back to spend happy Christmas with.
But another voice strikes on her ear, and every nerve is strained to listen. Yes, ?tis he !
?tis Hubert?s voice! Ivy?s heart would recognise its dear tones amongst a thousand
others. One moment and she has darted into the hall and stands gazing wildly around
with white face and widely distended eyes. Then, with a low cry, she sinks fainting to
the ground. Before the rest can recover their astonishment, Hubert Kean has sprung
forward and is bending over the inanimate form, calling her by every endearing epithet
his Ivy, his sweet Ivy, his darling Ivy. Slowly Ivy recovers consciousness, to find
that it is not all a dream ; the lost is found, her love restored to her.
What a happy night that was to Ivy, as she sat with Hubert?s hand clasped in
hers, the past forgotten, the present so blissful, the future so bright. It is needless to
tell the mutual explanations that followed, and what Ivy replied when Hubert repeated
the old, old story of two years ago, and how there was an advertisement in the Argus
for a music-teacher with the munificent salary of jQ 2O a year, and how Lillian hugged
Ivy in her delight, and Mrs. Fay would insist on her remaining at Yarranong until
Hubert carried her away to the beautiful home he prepared at Toorak for the reception
of his bride. All these things are better imagined than chronicled.

How I went for the Plate
s*r|j||UNNlNG a show is the easiest thing in the world ; every body thinks they
3 jni can do it. So they can if they know how. For the benefit of those who
IsSI don?t know the ropes, I give the receipt. First, get a capitalist ; this is a
sine qua non. Next secure the services of a first-class advance agent, who must be
a man of indomitable front, possessed of illimitable resources, and equal to any
emergency. If he knows his business, he will engage your halls, worry editors into
giving half-column notices for a five shilling advertisement, and will see that your
flaming pictorials, illustrating the thrilling acts you never see except on paper, are
properly posted. He will, in case of a frost and not being able to cash up, also
arrange the retreat of your company and baggage in good order.
The above preliminaries having been complied with, all you have to do is to
descend upon the town you intend to loot, open your show, and there you are. If
the spoil don?t roll in up to your expectations, blame your agent for everything ; it
will ease your mind, and impress your company with your importance ; and then
you can move on to the next town.
The above advice applies only to running a show.
When the show commences to run you, the situation alters, and it requires
genius to pull through. I have run a good manv swindles in ray time, from patent
disinfectants to land syndicates, but I have always found that the show business
requires more working than any line I ever handled, and the results have always
been less satisfactory from a precuniary view. My readers will probably suspect that
as a showman I have been a comparative failure. I plead guilty to the soft
impeachment.


There is, however, a wonderful unanimity of opinion amongst professionals as
to their individual abilities to run a show, and a fiery indignation breaks out in
spots on the grog-blossomed visages of the frequenters of Poverty Point*
at the mention of such weak-kneed entrepeneurs as Williamson, Garner, and
Musgrove, Fred. Hiscock, or Allison and Rignold, whom they credit with an
immense amount of luck, but not genius such as they have, which has always been'
crushed. And their righteous indignation is only to be appeased by beer and plenty
of it, and they gradually become absorbed in the bosom of the nearest pub when
they happen to strike a sympathiser who possesses the necessary coin to pay for the
booses.
Many years ago, before I attained my present proud position, I accidentally
became the possessor of fifty pounds, and a burning ambition seized me to become
the proprietor of a Theatrical Company and die a millionaire. I felt quite confident
of achieving the latter result with the utmost ease. The greatest difficulty I
thought of experiencing was in getting a company together. This I found to be a
mistake. I achieved the company without trouble ; the million is still in perspec-
tive, and by the light of my past experience I am of the belief that my hope of becom-
ing a second Barnum is still a dream of the future.
The company I secured, honesty compels me to state, was a very ? snide
one, most of my people being prunings, as it were, of other very shy companies,,
almost as bad as my own. Taken at their value, I should have had to pay at least
sixty per cent, to discount them, as most of them suffered from physical as well as
theatrical disabilities. For instance, my leading lady had a cast in her eye, and was
generally called before the curtain when she made a hit by the euphonious nom d�
theatre of ?Squinny.?? My juvenile man had an impediment in his speech, and
rejoiced in a pair of legs that appeared to divide at his waist ; but my low comedian
was the greatest fraud of the lot, and had as much humor in his composition as a
dead Murray co l, and during jthj time he remained with us I never even saw
him raisO a laugh from the audience, though I?ve seen him contort his features likfe
an india-rubber mask, and strain himself till he nearly broke a blood vessel ; but
he had an immense opinion of his comic capabilities, and a contemptuous disregard
of his audience, whom he used to declare had not brains enough to appreciate talent.
* A well known street rendezvous in Melbourne for disengaged, and sometimes engaged, actors,,
singers, and instrumentalists. ,It is a point from which there are twelve licensed victuallers houses
within one stone?s throw.


The above describes part of my company. My minor performers were up to about
the same standard. Taken all together, they were about equal in calibre to the
average Pacific slopers who occasionally visit us benighted Australians to scoop in
the dollars with their Californian diamonds and impossible dramas, and educate ift
up to the American standard of high dramatic art. But, bad as they were, I felt
very proud of them, notwithstanding the fact that a disappointed funny man, whom
I did not engage, christened ithem ?The Noah?s Ark Salvage Star Company,? a
name, by the by, that stuck to them during the whole time of our tour, which,
as the reader will discover farther on, was not of very long duration.
Well, we started out to astonish the natives and rake in the shekels. Strange
as it may appear, We did neither. The natives refused to be astonished, or, if they
were, they must have been astonished at our cheek in showing in their town, and
:so stayed away, for not above two and a half per cent, of the people attended our
show, and as a natural consequence the shekels also refused to be raked in. The next
town was the same ; the next a shade better ; the third one a dead frost ; and even-
tually the ? Noah?s Ark Salvage Co.? found themselves stranded by a singular
?coincidence at the picturesque mining (not Biblical) town of Ararat, with about
three pound ten amongst the whole of the company, and in possession of quarters
the landlady of which flatly refused to tick us a single meal (she had been had
before), basing her refusal on the absurd grounds that she never gave credit to
actors. As a consequence, we had to part beforehand for every meal.
One hope remained : we were to open at the Hall, which had been paid for,
the night we arrived (Saturday), and we were also billed*fo open at Ballarat on the
following Monday night, where we hoped to make a recovery previous to breaking
up the company and returning to Melbourne. Fate, however, was against us, and
about two hours before the performance was to have commenced the rain came
down as if there were no hereafter. I never saw it rain so in my life ;it came down
as if Jupiter Pluvius and his satellites were rehearsing for a second Noahchin epoch,
or else had taken an irrigation contract and were afraid of getting fined if they did
not complete it in time ; and wet, draggled and heart-sore, we straggled back to
our Hotel from the Hall, where the billsticker and bellman (whom I owed money
to) formed the only audience, and a more miserable lot of ? pros ? never huddled
round a fire than the flooded out members of the Noah?s Ark Co. on this particular
Saturday night. Even our landlady melted at our woe-begone appearance, and
generously asked us to take something hot at her expense;-a proposal that called


a flicker of joy whilst the liquor lasted, only to die out as we looked gloomily at the
few grains of sugar left in the botton of our empty tumblers, and dreamily wondered
where the next drink was to come from.
? This comes of having a cove ahead that don?t understand his business,?
grumbled our low comedian. ? Why didn?t he take us round the Western district ?
It always rains up here. The last time I was round there we used to turn money
away every night, and I used to get three or four calls before the curtain every
performance.?
The above statement, I may remark, is an old stock ?chestnut ? that is sup-
posed to have originated about the time that the immortal Billy u i 1 to busk round
the provinces, and has been used so often since by the profession as to have lost
its identity as a fine old crusted Shakesperean lie.
? We?ve never had but one good house since we?ve been out,? sobbed my
leading lady, ? and that was the night I played Camille.? (Six pounds five shillings
were the receipts on the night alluded to.)
? Bosh ! ? snorted the split-waisted juvenile lead, with a look of contempt ;
your Camille ! It was my Armand that fetched ?em ?always sure of a house when
I show in that or ? Hamlet.? ?
? It?s no good quarrelling,? said I. ?If any one can suggest a way to pull us
through it would be more to the purpose. All my money is gone, but if we can
manage to get to Ballarat we shall be all right. Jenson (our agent) writes me he is
sure of a good first night even if we get pelted off the stage on the second.?
All looked blankly at one another, but no suggestion was made, and -I
received a fair share of abuse for the mess the}' said I had brought them into ; it
being the first time, so they all said, they had never been in such a fix before, a
statement I afterwards discovered to be not strictly truthful, the being stuck up
having been a normal state of existence with them whenever they took to the
provinces. However, I didn?t say much to them, but let them talk on, of which
they soon got tired, and one by one retired to their rooms, leaving me the sole
occupant of the snug little parlour.
? When you go to bed, sir, put out the gas,? said my landlady, putting her
head in at the door. ? I?m very sorry the rain spoiled your performance, but I don?t
think you would have had a very large attendance. They don?t care much for
theatricals here. They are too religious. You ought to go to our chapel to-morrow.
It is always crowded when Mr. Pritchard preaches.?


? Pritchard ?? I queried, the name sounding familiar to me. ? Pritchard, did
you say 1 Can you tell me his front name ? ?
? Oh, yes, sir,? replied the landlady. ? The Rev, Richard Pritchard. You
ought to go. lam sure you would like him. I have heard that he was on the stage
himself one time, but nobody here believes it. He?s looked upon as a saint here.
Good night, sir,? and closing the door, I was again left alone.
A slight digression will be necessary here. Many years before this story com-
menced, a certain Dick Pritchard and myself had been members of an amatuer
dramatic club, and we caught the dramatic fever very badly; in fact, so inoculated
were we that we determined that the public should no longer be deprived of the
pleasure of seeing such talent as ours ; so one day we made our way to Ballarat,
and under the auspices of Mr. Harry Edwards, who was then running the Adelphi
(late Montezuma), we burst upon the gaze of the (well, I Avont say astonished)
public in parts of about six lines each. That Avas as far as Dick eA r er got, and,
becoming disgusted Avith such parts as ? A lady Avaits Avithout, my lord,? and
occasionally clearing off the tables and chairs to the running accompaniment that
generally greets such characters, he disappeared, and AA?as no more heard of in the
halls of Thespis.
Some tAA'O years aftenvards I found myself on old Bendigo, busily engaged in
watching some men shovelling slush into a dray to supply a puddling machine. One
of the men looked up. That face?yes! there Avas no doubt of it, it was the
veritable Dick Pritchard. An exclamation Avas sufficient to bring him to my side,
and, after a hearty handshake, I asked him hoAV he had come to forsake the sock
and buskin for such a plebian occupation as shovelling muck.
? Well, look here,? said Dick, ? I Avas hard up Avhen I came back here. So I
took the first job that offered, and I?ve been here ever since. Oh ! I?m all right, I?m
on the religious ticket. The old chap that bosses the slush mill is one of those
gospel chaps, and he holds forth at a small meeting house up the gully there. He?s
got plenty of money and a pretty daughter. I?m going in for a full share in the one,
and a fair share of the other. You ought to hear me rub it into them about their
precious souls.?
? Do you hold forth as well, Dick,? I asked.
?My Avord, I do,? responded Dick. ? I find out all their raAV places, I tell
you, and I touch ?em up, believe me.?
? But do you believe Avhat you preach ?? I asked


?Well, it?s not worth going into that,? said Dick, with a grin. ?It pays best.
You ought to go into it yourself,, Watty. You have only to roar out loud and
give them plenty of blood and Sheol; it frightens the old ones into fits, and stirs up
their livers. Bless your soul! they like it. The hotter you give it them the more
they think of you. You can do anything you like yourself as long as it?s not too
barefaced. They wont believe you can do any harm if you pose as a saint.?
From that time I had never heard of or seen Dick, but the mention of his
name by the landlady had suddenly brought him to my recollection, and I deter-
mined to visit the chapel on the morrow and discover if it were my Dick or not.
If it were, I felt tolerably certain I could see my way out of my present difficulty,
and get my company through to Ballarat with flying colors. As a matter of fact,
Dick owed me a few pounds, but as I never wanted it I never thought of the matter.
Being chums, we had always borrowed from one another, and never thought much
about it, but paid when we happened to be flush ; but the last loan, coming horn
me, although so long since, would, I am sure, be remembered, and paid cheerfully
by him, as soon as I made known to him my present difficulty ; and it was in quite
a cheerful frame of mind I lighted my candle and turned in, to forget my troubles
and hope for a speedy termination of them.
Sunday morning and afternoon I spent in taking stock of the surrounding
scenery and investigating the heaps of mullock about old abandoned shafts, which,
though testifying to the industry of a past generation, added but little to the beauty
of the .prospect. Evening came, and I added a unit to a very large attendance at the
chapel, where I hoped to meet Dick with a view to identification. Sure enough,
it was my old friend, and I felt that a way out of my difficulty would easily be
found if once I managed to gain a private interview. I found my landlady had not
overrated the Rev. Dick?s ability in the gospel thumping line. He was really a
very able preacher, and let his following have it straight from the shoulder, hitting
out at all their little pet sins, and touching up the raws of old sinners, who, now
that the appetite for committing them had palled, hoped, by attending, for the last
few years of their wicked lives, to the precepts they had carefully shunted when they
stood in the way of their self-indulgence, to make up for lost time and balance a
very heavy debit account of long standing.
At the conclusion of the service, the inevitable plate went round as a matter
of course, and the coin rained in a perfect argentiferous shower ; and Dick, after
shaking hands with most of the leading members of his congregation, took his


departure. I knew where his saintship resided, and followed at my leisure, and,
after allowing an interval of thirty minutes for refreshments, knocked at the door,
which was opened by a trim, middle-aged woman, whom I took to be his house-
keeper.
? Is the Rev. Mr. Pritchard in 1? I asked.
? He?s in, sir,? she replied, ? but he is just going to bed. Anything particular ?
?anybody bad ? ?
? Bad is not the name for it,? said I earnestly. ? There?s a small community
that are suffering from the complaint, and if it is not attended to at once, something
more serious might happen.?
? The woman looked frightened, and ushered me into a parlour, and, saying she
would send the master to me, left the room.
I had scarcely time to take stock of the apartment when Dick entered, and,
bowing to me, said,
? My housekeeper told me that a gentlemen ?then he paused, turned slightly
pale, and held out his hand to me in a kind of half-hearted manner.?
? How are you, Dick ?? said I, rising and grasping his outstretched hand.
? You never expected to see me, I think. I was at chapel to-night, and, by Jove !
you did rub it into them. Pity you didn?t stick to the stage, old boy. You would
have been a howling success.?
A ghost of a smile illuminated Dick?s face as he said, ? Yes?exactly?l
believe I might have made a mark in dramatic history, but the Lord?s work called
me, and I felt my mission was to save souls, not to d , I mean not to misdirect
them.?
I could see at once that the Rev. Dick was either a hypocrite or a fanatic, so
I determined to go for him at once. ?You?ve forgotten, old man,? said I, ?the
time you told me that it paid best to do the gospel-grinding.?
? If ever I said such a thing,? said Dick solemnly, ? it must have been before I
had received grace ; but, to change the subject, what are you doing yourself? and
how came you to call on me ? ?
?Oh ! I still stick to the sock and buskin,? I replied ; ? and, having had a
streak of bad luck, I though I would call on my old chum to help me out of it. There
was a small account between us years ago; you remember, Dick, and I knew I had
only to call on you to help me out of my difficulties. I?m dead, flat, stone broke, and
I?ve got to cart my company to Ballarat by first train on Monday morning, and I
want a fiver to pay the passages.?


Dick?s face was a study far a few minutes, and then he said,
? However great my wish to help you is, I really can?t ; at least, not at
present ; in a day or two, perhaps.?
? A day or two will be no use to me, old man,? said I firmly. ? The fact is, I
must h&ve the money to-night before I leave the house. It?s no good your putting
on any of your salvation airs with me, Dick. I want a fiver, and I must have it.?
? And suppose I refuse to give you the money ?? said Dick coolly.
?In that case,? said I, ?Ishall start a subscription list,.and go round to the
leading members of your congregation, and ask them to help an old friend of their
beloved pastor?s, who at one time was a sinful play actor,?
Dick?s face flushed for a moment,'and he looked as if he would have liked to
have punched my head, but I suppose consideration for his cloth restrained him,
and he said, after a pause, ?Well, I will lend you the money.?
? That?s right,? said I; ? I knew you would. 1 Cast thy bread upon the waters,
and it shall return to thee after many days.? ?
? Yes, I know all about that,? replied Dick grimly, ? after many days. The
many days is such an indefinite term amongst men of your stamp. However, I will
see that you get it to-morrow.?
? To-night, Dick,? said I firmly. ? I must start first train to-morrow. v
? I haven?t got ten shillings in the house,? replied Dick. ? You shall have it
to-morrow as soon as the bank opens. I wouldn?t like to give you a cheque. We?re
only a small community here, and a cheque, if traced to you, might lead to no end of
scandal.?
? I don?t want to cause you anjT unpleasantness, of course, said I; ? but surely
you can raise a trifling fiver to-night.? Dick shook his head. ? Let me see,? I
continued ; ? can?t I suggest someway it ? Couldn?t you? of course?what
fools we were not to think of it before?splendid idea?the thing is easy?there?s
the plate.?
?Plate ?? queried Dick, looking at me for information. ? Plate? I don?t use
plate, if you mean silver.?
? Of course, I mean silver ; the silver you collected in the plate at to-night?s
show,? said I, with a marked emphasis on the silver.
?The offertory?? gasped Dick, his countenance glaring with holy horror at
what he thought or pretended to think sacrilege.
? You?ve struck it, Dick,?said I calmly. ?I?m not particular where it comes from,


nor if it?s all in threepenny bits. If you think it would be sinful, I?ll take the respon-
sibility for the sake of the premium, and as its getting late you had better hurry up
and get rid of me.? ,
To go into the many arguments I used to get hold of the offerings of the
faithful would take too long a space. Suffice it to say that, after many sighs and
groans, Dick counted it out to me, and I departed from his house five pounds the
richer in small silver, after a far from cordial leave-taking from the reverend gent,
whom I never saw again, though I heard of him. #
My reader will naturally wish to know the conclusion of my starring tour.
Well, I got my company safe to Ballarat ; and our first night, as the agent prophe-
sied, was a boom, over a hundred pounds being in the house. The second night?s
show was nipped in the bud in consequence of our agent being missing, I having
unfortunately left him in charge of the cash on our first night, expecting a settle-
ment in the morning. He, however, left twenty pounds behind him?an act of
generosity for which I was very to see us through to Melbourne with, also
a letter stating that, as we owed him that amount of salary, he thought it better to
pay himself first to avoid any disputes. He is a great theatrical agent in Melbourne
now, employed by the best firms, and his jewellery is the admiration of his less
unsuccessful brethren. Dick Pritchard is a bright and shining light in a fashionable
suburban church, and yours truly, though he has gone into several theatrical specs
since, has never forgotten how he ? went for the plate.?

What Matters it Now if I Wed for Gold ?
Just a fair girl sitting at eventide,
Awaiting the morrow to be a bride ;
Yet the glittering tears in her glad eyes shine,
As she draws from her breast an old valentine.
? Tis a year to-day since it came," said she,
From the one I loved and who well loved me ;
But his faithful heart in the grave lies cold ;
What matters it now if I wed for gold?"
Then she gazed once more on each precious line
Of that last love-gift, his dear valentine.
? I can never,? she said, ?Move again, 1 know,
As I loved and was loved by my darling; no f
Ah! I never dreamt, when he called me ?mine,?
That ever I?d burn his dear valentine.
But his faithful heart in the grave lies cold
What matters it now if I wed for gold ?"

Christmas-tide-
Some say that ever ?gainst that season comes,
Wherein our Saviour?s birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long,
And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad ;

No fairy takes, nor watch hath pow r er to charm ;
So hallowed and so gracious is the time.

The Origin of the Yule-Log.
Derived from our ancient British and Scandinavian ancestors, the custom
is, so to speak, a Christianised-heathen one. They had, in common with other
and more civilised nations, a great festival at this season of the year ?the
winter solstice ; and immense bonfires w r ere kindled in honour of the god
Thor, representing, in their faith, our Jehovah. This feast was called by our
ancestors Juul, the festival of the sun, corrupted in the Scottish dialect to
Yule Curious enough, the Gothic word Giul means a wheel ; and in our
ancient ? Clog Almanacks "a wheel forms the device marking Yule-tide. Yule,
or Juul, w r as so named in Danish ;in Welch it is Haul, or the festival of the
Sun?the sun of the new year being then ushered in. In Saxon it was called
Gehul, 11 the sun feast in Swedish Oel, with the article of ?j.? Mallet, in
his ?Northern Antiquities," says that ?all the Celtic nations have been
accustomed to the worship of the sun, and to celebrate a feast at the winter
solstice.? ? They called it,? he adds, ? Yole or Yuul, from Iliaul and Haul,
which signifies the sun in the Bretaign, Basque, and Cornwall languages."
Blount, in ? Our Northern Parts,? derives the word from the French, Nouel
or Noel The Greenlanders also to this day keep a sun-feast at the same
season to rejoice at the return of that luminary. Much more might be said
on the subject of the term Yule, but further space cannot be afforded for the
purpose.


Christmas on the Diggings.
Thirty years ago, Christmas in Australia was celebrated with the same
English jolity that is observable now, but under far different circumstances. Old
chums, especially on the diggings, will readily remember this, and I for one have a
lively recollection of some of the difficulties that had to be overcome. Unfortu-
nately, humanity generally is . not endowed with that happy character which
Dickens gives to Mark Tapley, whose happiness increased under the most miserable
circumstances. I have a profound respect for Dickens and his wonderful knowledge
of the character of men, yet I confess that I have met with but very few Mark
Tapleys in my time. New chums in the olden time cannot be described as such
happy beings. A long and dreary expanse of ocean lay between them and the land
so dear to them ; and the romantic visions that the new land they had sought glit-
tered with gold and riches were dispelled, and a feeling of disappointment only was
left. Yet there were many jolly fellows in those times, though I could scarcely
have been reckoned one of their number. To add to my discomfort, I had displayed
my ignorance of the land I was coming to by bringing with me a young wife and
two children ; but I will rapidly pass over the hardships I endured.
What a long journey it was to the diggings in those days. Those arriving in
the colony now, and benefitting by the industry of the old pioneers in the matter
of railways, would scarcely credit the undertaking that it was, when the diggings
first broke out, to travel from Melbourne to Bendigo. It was not the work of four
hours as now; but it was the painful journey of a week. O yes, I recollect it ; I
have a very good reason to do so ; and I could give, at this time, evidence concern-
ing that journey which, in all matters of detail, would satisfy even a learned judge
of the Supreme Court.
I could say that I formed one of a party which chartered at an enormous price
a dray to carry a few things up to the diggings. I was not mad (the explana-


tion, I think, is necessary), but I took my children with me Wild as the action
may now appear, I had good reason, while on the diggings, to congratulate myself
for it; because, on many occasions, while roughing it, my other self proved to be
my better half, and a solace and guide. This was not so, however, on the way to
the diggings. An opossum severely alarmed my wife on the second night of our
camping out, and a lizzard did ditto with the whole of the company on the follow-
ing day. We thought it was a snake, and the drayman, who was not a new chum,
enjoyed the mistake.
At length we entered Bendigo, I carrying the youngsters, one of them minus
a boot, lost on the way, and not to be replaced for love or money, and the wife hold-
ing on to the long tails of my coat because there were so many rude-looking,
beardy, blue and red-shirted men about. How some of them did laugh at us ; and
now, as I look back and picture the scene, in my mind?s eye, I cannot help echoing
the laugh even at this date, because we must have cut a most ridiculous figure
indeed. But I did not laugh then ; I was fiercely indignant, and did not even feel
kindly disposed towards some of those good-natured fellows, who, I could now and
then see, cast glances of pity at the somewhat frightened and pretty girl by my
side.
But I will not enter further into an explanation of the feelings by which I was
moved then. I would rather leave that subject to the imagination of my readers ;
for my purpose now is to tell the story of my first Christmas on the diggings.
It was Christmas week when we arrived ; and I need scarcely say we did not
lose much time in selecting the first convenient camping place that presented itself
to us. The dray was unloaded, and I set to work with the erection of my tent ;
and goodness knows how long it would have taken me to complete the task but
that I, for the first time, learned the kindness of the hearts which lay beneath the
rough blue shirts of some of the diggers. An offer of assistance from two men was
made, and although I was at first inclined to be stiff and independent, a desire to
secure the comparative comfort of my wife and children overcame my stiffness, and
the offer was accepted. The tent was soon up, I standing helplessly by, while my
two new friends rapidly accomplished the work.
Armed with a pick and shovel, I next day sallied forth in search of fortune,
but in anything but a confident frame of mind. My wife was desirous that I
should appear respectable, and, to satisfy her, I wore a clean, but somewhat ruffled,
white shirt. Of course I did not understand alluvial gold mining, and being more-


over bashful, I commenced operations as |far away from the other diggers as pos-
sible, and that was on the side of a hill. I need scarcely say that on that day I
blistered my hands all to no purpose. There was no gold there, and I was laughed
at; but I gained experience, and received a lesson from some kindly disposed
miners, who showed me where to look for and expect gold. One of the men pro-
mised to take me to a gully on the following day, and show me where to sink. I
gladly accepted the offer, for my funds were getting awfully low, but I kept that
from my wife, and alone bore the misery of the thought that starvation might be in
store for my little family. It was then only three days to Christmas.
Accompanied by the man who had offered his assistance on the previous day,
I left my tent on the next morning, and under his direction commenced operations
in the bed of a gully. It was hard, painful work for me, but I toiled on. My
digger friend bottomed his hole on the first day, and his success cheered me on.
Off the bottom he washed about five ounces, and next day I returned to my work
with more hope. On the afternoon of the third day I bottomed. Old Donald
(that was the name of my digger friend) washed the stuff for me, but disap-
pointment was my lot. Only a few specs of gold were obtained, but Donald gave
hopes, and told me that I had bottomed in a dip, and advised me that I should
follow the bottom up the rise, where the wash-dirt looked better. Two or three
coarse specks encouraged me in this effort before I ceased work for the night, and I
returned to my tent tolerably pleased. It was Christmas Eve, and a very hot one
it was. I sought to cheer my wife with a sight of the two or three atoms of the
precious metal of which I had become the proud possessor. She was pleased, I
think, and we talked over the Christmas Eves and the Christmas Days of the past |
and how happy did they appear to have been as compared with the position we
were then in ! This train of reflection was not calculated to enhance the pleasure
of my first Christmas Eve in Australia, and if I entertained feelings of peace and
goodwill towards all mankind, I certainly did not extend the same feeling towards
myself. Nor was the hot atmosphere, and the prevalence of attentive mosquitoes,
calculated to improve or soothe my temper, which I felt was ruffled to a degree, as
I reclined to rest ?if the troubled sleep into which I fell can be called such. The
night wore into morning, when I was suddenly startled, and I assumed a sitting
posture. ? Robbers,? whispered my terrified wife, and it at once became apparent
to my sleepy senses that someone was attempting to remove the tent from over our
beads. Tug, tug at the ropes, and the tent shook in every part. I felt that it was


time to do or say something, so, arming myself with the only weapon within reach,
a tin candlestick, I called out as sternly as I could, ?Stand, or I?ll fire !? Although I
did say stand, I would have been heartily glad to have heard retreating footsteps,
but the only reply I received was tug, tug at the ropes, while a small scream from
my wife nerved me to further action. Springing through the doorway, I made a
dash with the candlestick at a dark object. A howl from the object, which at once
beat a hasty retreat, proved an immense relief. The robber was a dog, which had
endeavored to removed a piece of meat which I on the previous night had wrapped
up and tied to the fly of the tent.
Thus my first Christmas on the diggings was ushered in. A few men worked
that day, and certainly I never intended to do so, but anxiety or something caused
me to visit my hole. When there the temptation was too strong. I took my pick,
which I had left at a neighboring digger?s tent, and with it I gave two or three idle
picks at the wash-dirt, but with what a startling result. I shall never forget it. My
blood seemed to stop its circulation and my heart to beat; for there, beneath the
point of my pick, glittered the portion of a large lump of gold. O, I knew it was
gold, and while removing the earth from around it I treated it with immense re-
spect and feared to give it even a blow from my pick lest the treasure should vanish
from my sight. There it was, however, and it turned out to be 120 ozs. in weight,
while a smaller piece of this precious metal, which lay by its side, proved to be 30
Need I say that we were happy that day. My wife wept with joy when I pre-
sented her with such an acceptable Christmas pudding, while I conceived a sudden
affection for the colony, which has not, nor never will, be erased. It is surprising
what an effect that piece of gold had; and, if my opinion is worth anything, I
should say that if money at times is a source of evil, it is more frequently the source
of happiness, and is especially so when the possession of it enables us to secure the
happiness of those we love. Such were my experiences on my first Christmas Day
pn the?diggings.

Pickpockets and Piety.
She was a dear old lady, and she read so much in the Argvs and Age about pick-
pocketing going on in the grand-stand and lawn at Flemington, that she determined to
sacrifice her principles at once, and attend the wicked races, so that she might perhaps
have an opportunity of plucking a ? brand from the burning.? Her name was Snoops ;
but as fortune willed it, she did not have an opportunity of doing much good on the
afternoon of the event. She kept a wary look-out all day long, ready at a moment?s
notice to seize hold of any pickpocket who might practice his nefarious trade upon her,
lead him to some retired corner, there remonstrate with him, and prayerfully
?wrestle? for his soul.
But the afternoon wore away and no pickpockets appeared, and the old
lady s patience was almost exhausted, when suddenly a sharp-looking man, dressed in a
suit of loud pattern, hurried by her, and the good old lady imagined she felt a stealthy
hand near her pocket.
Seizing hold of the suspected individual, she fixed her eyes on him sternly, and
said?
? Mister, are you a pickpocket ??
?No, mum; not me,? he answered glibly. ?I?m a commercial traveller from
Ballarat.?
?Is that so?? she returned with a sigh. ?Well, I?m awfully disappointed, I
wanted to try and see if I couldn?t reform you.? And Mrs. Snoops returned home a
wiser woman?and a still sadder one, when she found out that her purse had been
surreptitiously abstracted from her pocket.

A New Year?s Greeting,
(By Albert G. Dawes.)
Old Year !
To thee adieu ;
And with my last good night,
I pray that, with thy dying breath,
Prosperity will dawn within our midst,
And ? boomers ? from our shores for evermore depart,
And joyful hearts be born again in Austral?s sunny climes
Ring, ring, ring, ye merry, merry bells, proclaiming
Unto all a bright New Year?s beginning.
Usher in glad, mirthful tidings,
Plenteous joys surrounding,
Health, wealth abounding.
To one and all,
New Year !
