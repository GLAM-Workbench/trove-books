Head from some humble poet,
Whose songs gushed from his heart
As showers from the clouds of summer,
Or tears from the eyelids start;
Who through long days of labor
And nights devoid of ease,
Still heard in his soul the music
Of wonderful melodies.
Such songs have power to quiet
The restless pulse of care,
And come like the benediction
That follows after prayer.?-LoNGFEIIoW.

PREFACE.
jTTENTLE READER,--I had thought that at some future
period of my life, when I had gathered flowers enough, I
would try and weave them into a garland of poesy, and publish
them in a collected form, but
? There is a divinity that shapes our ends,
Rough hew them as we may.?
For want of leisure and various other causes, that period has
long been delayed, and I have been kindly advised to make the
best of the small bunch I have gathered, and publish them now,
hence the production of so small a book.
But, it may be argued by some into whose hands this little
book may fall, why are we inflicted with a production of this kind,
when we can be fed upon the dainties supplied in the exquisitely
beautiful works of our standard poets? To such I would answer :
There are minds to be fed with wholesome, commendable food,
which would starve upon the lofty grandeur and sublimity of
Milton, even while admiring his genius.
I trust that (whatever your creed), you will find nothing that
will offend your love of the beautiful. They are some of the
realities of life from the breathings of a sincere heart, and
may justly be termed living poems.
A. Gr.
Talbot, 1878,

STANZAS.
Wouldst ill on law to bq Remembered
WOULDST thou live to be remember?d
When thy evening sun has set,
And leave a cherish?d name behind thee
Friend or foe will not forget!?-
Grave no mark on gilded tablet,
Deeply cut with finest steel;
Write upon thy neighbour?s feeling
All the love thy soul can feel.
Not the deed of might can raise thee
In an honest truthful mind;
The hero of a hundred battles
Soon or late this truth will find?
Only good and worthy actions
Gain a conquest o?er the soul;
All the wise and good observe them
Pointing upward to their goal.
Better than the world should praise thee,
Shouldst thou win thy brother?s love,
Is the welcome that awaits thee
In a brighter world above.
Let no cross, however weighty,
Crush thee in its mighty test,
All who?ve entered heaven before thee
Bravely toiled to enter rest.


3>k of mg gojijtood.
N a pleasant little village in the fertile vale of Kent,
Was the home of happy childhood where my boyhood?s days
were spent ;
Where the Medway takes its winding course thro? many a shady
grove,
And the woodland songster tunes his note and tells his tale of
love.
From the noisy city far away, and yet not so remote
But one might see the old church tower, and hear the cuckoo?s
note ;
Where the pleasant sound of Sabbath bells would often greet the
ear,
O?er the waters wafting sweetly their melody so clear.
Oh, how I loved the beautiful, in man and nature too;
Whene?er a noble deed was done, it made my young heart glow;?
Where?er a lovely spot was found, ray soul would seek the place.
Enchanted with the beauty of nature?s smiling face.
I knew a little murmuring brook which cross?d the woodland
dell,
Where grew the scented violet?l remember it full well,
For oft in coming home from school, fatigued with summer?s
heat,
We loitered by the cooling stream, and sailed our mimic fleet.
I never thought that care would come, with stern and wrinkled
brow,
And mingle in my pleasant cup the draught I?m drinking now !
Behind the curtain of ray fate, could I have raised the veil.
An unseen hand was writing there decrees which never fail.
Oh, how I miss those lovely scenes which graced the morn of life,
For now the world?s a battle-field, with much of toil and strife ;
And sweetly comes the Sabbath morn, with rest unto my soul,
To sing the great Creator?s praise, whose hand hath made the
whole.


Not that I shun the just decree which rests upon ray head?
From morn till night with honest sweat 1 toil for daily bread
Bat, oh, I feel a stern dislike to heathen laws that bind
A heavy burden on the back, and slight the nobler mind *
*1 am glad of the opportunity given me here to state that I welcome
most thankfully a reformation in many laws and customs which w'ere
in existence when this couplet was written.
?OMETH Winter, stern and gloomy.
Stripping bare the forest tree,
Sheep are huddling close together,
Winds blow chilly o?er the lea ;
Sweets of nature?s milder seasons
Now their varied charms decline,
Gone are birds from glade and woodland,
Songsters of the sweet wild chime.
Where are now those lovely flow?rets,
Blossoms whose perfume we love 1?
Gone the rose and woodbine?s fragrance';
No green leaves to deck the grove.
Rural haunts no longer tempt ns,
From the fireside?s cheering ray,
Pleasant rambles through the meadows.
Vanished with an autumn day.
Yet I love thee, winter, dearly.
Covered in thy coat of snow,
Bringing friends around my ingle,
Rivalling the fire-side glow.
Speakest thou with voice of wisdom?
Mourn not o'er the lonely past;
Cling not to the joys that perish,
God?s own truth alone shall last.


OJf HER mother?s PICTURE,
THERE S a picture that hangs o?er the old mantle-shelf,
And my father oft tells me it looks like myself ;
I bad long wish?d to know whose sweet face it could be,
Till one day he revealed the fond secret to me.
I have watched him and seen him look up to the frame,
hen have heard him pronounce to himself my own name;
1 have kissed him when sad, for it grieved me to see
How he wept while he talked of things unknown to me.
1 have grown up since then, and my father has said
Ev?ry day I grow like my own mother that?s dead ;
Oh, I felt a sad pride when he told me himself
Twas my own mother?s likeness that hung o?er the shelf
I know now the reason he kept it from me
When I wonder?d so much whose sweet face it could be
For he knew I should grieve in the friend I had lost ?
And he was not deceiv?d in the grief it has cost. ?
I can see his form wasting, and ev?ry day brings
A cold chill o?er my heart, when I think of such things ?
For I know that my father must leave me himself, ' ?
Like the sweet one whose image hangs over the shelf.
The flowers will bloom sweetly in woodland and dell
And the birds of the forest their gladness will tell ?
Rnt I shall he lonely when father is gone,
And long for the home where no sorrow can come.

don?t you remember the bridge o?er the stream.
Where we garaboll?d in infancy 1 ?
And the small narrow ledge which our feet had to climb,
To leap to the old walnut tree 1
For years the old bridge by its pillars was stay?d,
But at last it has gone to decay ;
Yet still we are found in the pathway of life,
With our hairs getting silver?d and grey.
And don?t you remember the fishes we caught,
With only a pin for a hook 1?
The stream was but shallow, the fish they were small,
But seldom the bait was forsook.
How strangely I feel when I think on the past,
Over trifles as light as the air !
For life is a stream that grows deeper and swift,
And pleasure is mingled with care.
Through rich scented meadows the streamlet-ran on,
Where the king cup grew in his pride,
And the hedges of hawthotn grew thickly and tall,
Where the mowers at noon-day would hide,
Old Time with his scythe gleaming bright in the sun,
Has left us a space to recall,
For the blade and the stalk are fit emblems of life,
And the shadows around us will fall.
But there is a river whose waters are dark,
And we all must come down to its edge,
Though we gambol awhile in the morning of life,
Far away from its slippery ledge.
We know not the moment our summons may come-,
For we?re passing away like a dream?
Then let us be sure that we find out the bridge,
That will carry us over the stream.

BORN MAY 10, 1870 J DIED MARCH 4, 1871.
(j |K SIMPLE mound of earth now hidea our darling little
JSa child,
That fairy form which haunts me still, those eyes so blue and
mild ;
And sweet wild flowers are blooming o?er the form we loved so
well,
let how we loved our infant child, these humble lines may tell.
M ith little Mary, side by side, we made her early grave,
The sister whom she never knew?we strove so hard to save?
But he who gives the gentle life to ev?ry tender flower,
Made angels of our children both in life?s sweet morning hour.
Those speaking eyes are closed in sleep, and silent is the tongue.
Which like a little silver bell once on the senses rung ;
Vet often in ray quiet hours I?m living o?er and o?er,?
The memory of my cherish?d ones, who now are gone before.
J open with a trembling hand, and eyelids wet with tears,
The treasures of a little store which I have kept for years ;
And there among the silken locks of shining golden hair
My blue-eyed infant lives again?l see my darling there.
How hard it was to give her up ye who are parents know,
For there are some whose winning ways we never can forego ;
And when the hope of meeting in a brighter world above,
Is blooming in our longing hearts, ?tis no sin thus to love.
Oh, what a meeting that will be, when all life?s trials are o?er,
Not one of them will be left out of all those gone before ;
I would not wish them back again into a world of sin,
Those guardian angels of my life who help my crown to win.

*sf REMEMBER the brook, with its murmuring rill,
it That drove the wheel-head of the old ivy mill ?
Where the stately old swan sallied over the stream,
And the water-cress grew with the trout and the bream ;
And I ought to remember the damsel so fair.
That dwelt on its banks, with her innocent air,
Who bade me good morn as I went to my toil,
With a sweet native grace that fine manners would spoi.
I remember the cottage with ivy-clad roof,
That weather?d all seasons in tine waterproof.
With the orchard and stile at the end of the lane,
And often I wonder if things are the same;
I know that the meadows with cowslips abound,
That nature is true as the seasons come round.
And that spring will renew the sweet orchard bloom,
When man with his labor is laid in the tomb.
The stream will flow on when the old wheel is dry.
And the brook, in its freshness, go murmuring by;
But the dairy so clean kept will have a new maid,
And some other cow will be under the shed;
Then let me be frugal, and gather life s flowers.
Which bloom by the way in all seasons and hours,
And let my whole life with a meaning be pass d,
Till, like the old wheel, I am time-worn at last.

A maid will be wedded to-morrow I trow ;
Some fingers are weary, but on I must go.
Whirr-r-r-r, clickity-clack !
A robe must be finished her bridal to deck.
My bobbin is covered with fine silken thread ;
And all the long night, while you sleep in your bed,
A small dainty foot is pressing my treadle,
And bright sleepy eyes keeping watch o?er my needle,
Whirr-r-r-r ! whirr-r-r-r !
One penny per yard, and don?t reckon the fur.
What is the matter i

To-morrow is Cup day, and Lady M'Mithers,
Bedizn?d in lace and decked out in feathers,
Will pay the old chap for my clickity-clack,
And bright golden guineas will follow my track.


Whirr-r-r, clickity-clack !
Like a swift-winged bird I am off in a crack ;
My speed is too fleet for a low sporting range ;
I cry for no quarter, nor fear any change.
Buy me or hire me,
Yon never can tire me;
I work for the noble, the wealthy, and gay,
Or anyone else who will honestly pay.

And why all the clatter ?
The winter is coming, the cupboard is bare?
Keep oil in my couplings, I?ll fly through the air.

And the proud and the haughty comedown with a fall

For worth is my beauty.
My labor is earnest, my time is well spent ;
I work for the master with zealous intent.
There is plenty of matter
To cause all my clatter?
The sick and the wounded are ready to die ;
Fresh bedding is wanted, and places to lie.
In a neat little cottage, styled College-lawn Villa,
Whose garden can boast of a fine gladiola,
Where the jnnus insignis fills up all the corners,
And things are all done as her ladyship orders,
Whirr-r-r-r ! whirr-r-r-r !
I?m christened ? The Noiseless,? and yet I am here ;
The fact?s in the matter,
I?m done with all clatter ;
Mounted with ivory and richly inlaid,
The pride of the mistress and young parlor-maid ?
My parts are anointed, and shining, and clean?
A beautiful thing is the sewing machine.

fled
From him who watch?d with anxious care around her dying bed ;

And show that love doth in thy bosom live.

For Ihou hast borne my sin and shame.


When frowns the world upon my lot.
Do then, O Lord, my shelter be ;
The blessings Thy dear blood has bought.
Are worth a thousand worlds to me.
Dan I refuse to drink the cup,
Which shall my chasten'd soul prepare;
When Thou, my Lord, wilt bear me up,
And all my sorrows Thou wilt share.
I?ll not forget Thy suffering life,
Thy bloody cross and painful death;
Amid the world?s turmoil and strife,
Thy praises shall employ my breath.
Oh, let me live to do Thy will,
Till all the trials of life are o?er;
Thy praise shall then my bosom fill,
In realms of bliss for evermore.

WE are a little hopeful band,
United firm in heart and hand,
The good we choose, the bad withstand,
Our motto, ?Onward ever?;
Nor can temptation turn astray
Our feet from wisdom?s pleasant way,
While we have strength to watch and pray,
Our band shall hold together.
The drunkard's cup we never know,
His cup so full of bitter woe,
We pledge ourselves as on wo go,
To touch it not, for ever ;
And while our God shall give us light,
We mean against all sin to fight,
And pray that he may guide us right,
And keep us altogether.

X LOVE to spend some summer hours,
Among the pleasant woods and flowers
Or on a mossy bank to lie,
And hear the streamlet gurgling by,
Happy, heedless, careless, free,
Underneath the greenwood tree.
I have a right that nature yields,
Jo jump the stile, and roam the fields,
Or climb the glorious mountain height,
?Till almost giddy with the sight)
Happy, heedless, careless, free,
Beneath the vaulted canopy.
Or where the foaming ocean laves
Ihe glittering strand with crested waves,
Awed by its majesty and power,
There T would spend a fruitful hour,
Happy, thoughtful, reverent, free,
Breathing health and liberty.
The workshop claims of toil a share ;
The glittering mine with poison?d air.
Has buried many a stalwart form,
And palsied many a brawny arm;
But all should have a space to see
The glorious sunlight streaming free.

O PRING-TIME is coming,
O My heart shall rejoice,
And with a glad welcome
I?ll lift up my voice ;
Meadow and woodland
Soon loudly will ring,
Rejoicing in gladness
For beautiful spring.
Spring-time is coming
To gladden the year,
The sweet-scented blossom
Will shortly appear ;
Pure as a virgin
And fresh as a child,
The breath of the morning
Will always be mild.
Spring-time is coming,
Already I feel
Its thrill in my visions,
Which soon will be real;
Old age will be sighing
O?er pleasures gone by,
And youth will be longing
New fortune to try.
Spring- time is coming,
With balm in its train;
The sick and the weary
Will rise up again ;
Oh, pause on its threshold.
Your offering to bring,
And welcome with gladness
The beautiful spring.

Doth Providence direct my mind untaught,
With inclination sweet to seek its food;
Oh, who shall say these gifted minds for nought
With patient labor studied long and late,
When into one vast storehouse they have brought
Treasures of all that?s truly good and great.
Here ev?ry phase of human joy or woe,
With apt description giv?n, some truth reveals ;
Here we may sit and learn what others know;
Our mind is quicken?d, and our spirit feels
That not in vain the midnight lamp has burn?d,

WHAT art thou Death that fills the heart with fear
Stern monitor of living souls, thy name
With dread solemnity falls on the ear !
A mighty leveller thou ?wealth, honor, fame,
Are all alike to thee ; the cherished friend,
The dangerous foe, beneath thy stroke must fall;
Thou bringest all distinction to an end,
When prince and peasant lie beneath the pall;
Yet art thou not supreme, for in thy wake
Doth follow heaven-born immortality ;
The fruit of life must ev?ry soul partake,
Its growth of sweet or dread reality,
And live again with waken?d joys or fears,
The life immortal, endless in its years.

All nature seems to share its holy rest;
The weary sons of toil, fatigued and worn,
Find consolation for the careworn breast.
Hush?d are the sounds of labor, yet there lives
A morning hymn in grove, and flower, and tree,.
And with that unseen power the spirit gives,
The heart is tuned to sacred melody ;
And can it be that thoughts and scenes like these,.
Have not the power to melt the stubborn heart I
Lives there a soul so dead, so hard to please,
That in this holy bliss it shares no part I
O Lord, if such, forgive that sinful man,
And breathe into his soul th.y life again..

And gather posies steep?d in fragrance rare,
Or wanton with the boughs of lovely May;
Butl ave trod a rugged path since then,
My way has been where thorns and brambles grow
And spring and summer come and go again,
To leave their shadows with a fainter glow;
Yet I have hope nor storm nor flood can move,.

Ay, prouder than the king at whose command
Beauty and wealth combine to serve his ends;
?Tis not that nature, in her lavish mood.
Hath made thee beautiful in form and face;
Thy qualities of heart and mind are good,
In perfect unison wi+h ev?ry grace.
One thing thou lackest yet?let thy warm heart
In streams reflect a dying Saviour?s love
The virtue of thy life thou wilt impart,
When bless?d with light and wisdom from above.
And ev?ry heighten?d charm thou shalt possess. '
Will make thee altogether loveliness.

�, DREADFUL shadow rests upon ray soul,
Helpless am I to move the hateful thing,
Yet there?s a balm can make my spirit whole
The rising sun with healing in his wing ;
s Tis unbelief has barr?d my prison door, _
My timid soul has welded her own chain,
Yet have I faith in God, and wanting more, _
The cloud will break and sunshine come again j
Oh Thou who giv?st the weary mourner rest?
Thy word is sure?to thee all flesh must come;
Darkness and clouds move on at thy behest,
And righteousness and judgment deck thy throne
Bear with this weak and timid soul of mine,
Till on thy truth most sweetly I recline.

mY soul hath ever feasted with delight
Upon the teeming joys which nature yields.
And I have seen the beautiful and bright,
In crowded cities and in pleasant fields,
The day-god?s rising beams at beauteous morn,
The splendid sunset of a summer s eve,
The awful grandeur of the coming storm,
Doth on my soul a fix?d impression leave ;
But, oh,'how glad and chang?d all nature seems,
When with a new-born heart we bound to life }
The flowers, the trees, the music of the streams,
Each blade of grass with melody is rife,
In praise of him whose goodness we confess,
The Lord of life, and truth, and righteousness

WHILE pressing forward alway in its might,
Toward the bright unseen, its future homo,
My soul hath ever welcom?d with delight,
'Hie growing signs of better things to come ;
No talent given should e?er be misapplied,
The bud unfolding speaks of future bloom,
And ev?ry water we should sow beside,
To make perfection sure in life?s high noon ;
Were I to choose, my guardian angel here
Along life?s chequer?d path my guide should be,
A comforter that should my spirit cheer,
And keep my soul awake from lethargy,
Promoting ev?ry good within my power,
And calmly waiting for life?s closing hour.

WHEN dull cold earth shall hide me from thy gaze,
And death?s deep slumber shall mine eyelids close,
Safe in my narrow bed, nor blame nor praise
Can wake my calm and hallowed repose ;
Make thou no show of tears about my grave,
But in thy quiet hours sweet thoughts I crave.
Pass not my memory unheeded by,
But give me holy thoughts in gentle hours ;
When in forgetfulness life?s tumults lie,
And blissful eve doth close her tender flowers,
Oh, then, bestow a thought upon the heart,
hich in life?s conflicts bore with thee a part,
