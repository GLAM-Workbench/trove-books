MACLAREH'S 1901-2 ENGLISH TEAM.
INTRODUCTION.
Tub arrival of Mr. Maclaren and his team to contend
the honors of English Cricket in Australia, has Iren
looked forward to with considerable public interest.
Probably so for various reasons, one being the fact
that 12 out of the number are players new to us, and
another consequent upon the singular opposition
shown in certain home quarters against Maclaren’s
organization, to say nothing of the conspicuous ab-
sence of any Yorkshire representative, notably Hirst
and Bhodes, who precluded from accepting an
invitation.
Unquestionably from the onset, and for the rea-
sons above stated, Maclaren had, in getting together
his combination, a by-no-means enviable task, but
this was perhaps somewhat minimised, arising from
his general knowledge of Australian cricket and
Australian wickets. What will be the extent of
England’s successes in the States is at present mere
conjecture, while hopeful, but certain it is that a fair
amount of Australian sympathy (if this be any conso-
lation) is with Maclaren under the trying circumstances
above stated,'and which befel him from the start in
organizing his team, a strong handicap, it might be
urged in view of all surroundings.
A review of the team which follows points to its
rendering a good account of itself, comprising as
it does an excellent combination of both bowlers and
batsmen, and supplemented by the excellent reputa-
tion given it of being second to none in the way of
fielding, not the least important factor, by the way,
contributing to scientific and successful cricket.

A. C. MACLAREN.
(BY F. J. IRONSIDE.)
(Lancashire and Harrow School and ex-captain of
the former, with the intention, so reported, of playing
with Hampshire on his return home.) Born January,
1870. His third visit to Australia with an English
team, and now for first time in the capacity of captain.
Represented England in Australia in the 13th and
14th teams, both under the captaincy of Mr. A. E.
Stoddart. Is a great advocate of rapid change of
bowling. As a batsman has very few superiors on
hard wickets. Is a punisher of short-pitched balls on
the on-side, and is without a rival in picking up the
ball, using both hands. As given out in Anthony
Hordern and Sons’ World’s Cricket Records
(compiled by the writer of these notes) he holds the
wonderful record of 424, made in England in the year
1895. Coming later, in year 1900 held second place
for Lancashire in championship county matches, with
an average of 37.34, his highest score being 145. On
his first visit to Australia in year 1894, was second in
the batting with an average of 47.23, his best innings
being 228 against Victoria in November, 1895, making
more than half of the score made by his side. On his
next visit to Australia (being his second) and with the
last English team, he followed this up by being second
in the averages to Ranjitsinhji in all matches with
54.37, and first in the five' test matches, with an
average of 54.22, and the second highest score, 124.
Maclaren might fairly claim to be “ an ideal captain,”
his general knowledge availing him much, and meaning
“ the right man in the right place ” in his chosen
position as captain of the 15th English team. Seems
to meet with particular success on Australian wickets.

T. HAYWARD.
(BY F. J. IRONSIDE.)
(Surrey Professional.) Born March, 1871. His
second visit to Australia with an English team, his
first being with Stoddart's XI. in the last visit, in
year 1897, at which time he became an established
public favorite. As a coincidence in the test matches
played here he occupied third jilace in both batting and
bowling, in the former getting an average of 37.33,
in the latter 41. As somewhat adding to the coinci-
dence, in the batting average in the 11-side matches,
he again got into third place, with the batting average
of 38.61, and in all matches played still again third in
the batting, with an average of 39.76 (37, 38, and 39
in consecutive order). Reviewed carefully this third
business might be regarded as somewhat peculiar.
Hayward's best performance was against 22 of Glen
Innes and district, making 107, his first three-figure
score in Australia. Against the last Australian XI.
Hayward, as “a further coincidence” came third
(being the fourth) in the “ all matches played,” coming
out with the splendid batting average of 59. In the
test matches in England, Hayward’s best performances
were 137 and 130, both innings being pronounced
“ magnificent cricket.” Reviewing his performances
in year 1900 (when he got over the century 10 times),
and the 1901 English season, being something over 52
in the average of batting, and amongst those who got
over 2500 runs, Hayward should give an excellent
account of himself and prove a valuable acquisition to
the English XI. in Australia. With his experience of
Australian wickets, there is absolutely very much in
this. As a bowler, written of him ‘‘that he changes
his pace with excellent judgment.”

L. C. BRAUND.
(BY F. J. IRONSIDE.)
(Ex-Surrey and Somerset Professional.) Born 1876.
His first visit to Australia with an English team. A
serviceable bowler (both fast and slow), a stylish
batsman, and, like his fellow-members of the team,
a brilliant fieldsman. His best performances were
those against the last Australian XI. when represent-
ing an English XI. in the second innings he was top
with 63. In the table of “ all matches ” against the
Australians he occupied second place with the com-
mendable average of 54. For Mr. W. G. Grace’s XI.
against the Australians at Crystal Palace, on a diffi-
cult wicket, Braund was top score with 125. His
performances against the Australian bowling was ex-
ceptionally good, but he never figured in any of the
test matches. Out of the thirteen English batsmen
who got into three figures, Braund was one, and ninth
on the list, the innings being 125, and that above
referred to. In the year 1900, Braund, consequent
upon the ruling of the M.C.C. that he had no qualifi-
cation for Somerset, was debarred playing with the
latter, and threw in his lot with the London County
Club, his best play being 107 against the Cambridge
University, and his average at close of season 25.36.
Of the sea-on just closed, and compared with other
members of the English team, and besides occupying
a high position in his County averages, his success is
somewhat well assured in the States, that is, if
consistency of form in the past be any criterion.
Braund, it might be added, at the close of the 1901
season, got more than his hundredth wicket, and ex-
ceeded his 1500 runs, his average being 36.06, and his
best score 115 not out.

G. L. JESSOP.
(BY F. J. IRONSIDE.)
(Gloucestershire and Cambridge University.) Cap-
tain of former team; born May, 1874, and his first
visit with an English team to Australia.' Written of
him that he is a faster scorer and bigger hitter than
the redoubtable Captain Wyuyard, Jack Lyons, H.
Massie, or George Bonnor, his 169 in 100 minutes
against Leicestershire being pronounced by Mr. W. J.
Ford as “ an intellectual treat,” one huge hit going
on to the pavilion roof. Plays from the very start,
and at the wicket takes a peculiar stand, some of his
strokes being purely of the agricultural type. Has
been known by his brilliant and fearless hitting to
turn the issue of an apparently lost game to one of
victory, and when accomplished within the short space
of 20 minutes is sufficient evidence of his punishing
powers. For the last four years has earned the dis-
tinction of being one of England’s fastest scorers.
One of his chief performances was against Sussex in
the year 1900, making 179 out of a total of 257 in Ij
hours. Three other great feats of his were against
Yorkshire, for the nonce admittedly the best bowling
and fielding county in England. Singular to write,
Jessop only played in one of the five test matches
against the last Australian team, although he did so
in several cases in the “All-Matches Programme,”
when he came out with the respectable average of
28.64. Jessop’s best performance in first-class cricket
was his 233 at Lord’s during 1901 season. Besides
being a reputable bowler, as a cover-point he has
probably no equal, and hence is a dangerous foeman
to any batsman who might venture reckless experi-
ments in “his particular direction.”

J. T. TYLDESLEY.
(BY F. J. IRONSIDE.)
(Lancashire Professional.) Born November, 1873.
His first visit to Australia with an English team.
Proved himself a most aggressive batsman during the
last three seasons, in several instances contributing
largely to Lancashire’s victories, and occupying a
high position in County averages, his 1901 season’s
average being 55.20, and his best score 221. Is con-
sidered one of the best fieldsmen in England, and
invaluable to his County in both getting and saving
runs.. Represented England in two out of the five
test matches played against the last Australian XL,
and for his County against the Australians had an
average of 25.83, in one match making top score in
both innings, 56 out of 102 in the first innings and 42
out of 81, this latter performance putting him in the
then next test match. One of Tyldesley’s best feats
was, perhaps, his three-figure perlormance of 106 and
not out 100 against Warwickshire for Pallett’s benefit
in 1897, followed up in 1899 with 249 against Leicester-
shire. Later on he formed one of Lord Hawke’s team
which visited South Africa, and was third in the
averages, his best score being 114. Last English
season, Ty'.desley, coupled with Hayward, were two of
the first three to compile their thousand runs. Holds
no special reputation as a bowler but withal as an
attractive and sterling batsman and unexceptionally
brilliant in the field his selection by Mr. Maclaren was
fully justified, showing, likewise, as he did, improved
form up to close of last English season.

A. A. LILLEY.
(BY F. J. IRONSIDE.)
(Warwickshire Professional.) His first visit to
Australia with an English team. Born November,
1867. Absolutely one of the best wicket-keepers ex-
tant, and a batsman far above the general average of
the “man behind the sticks,” with a good and confi-
dent style of batting, not to be too freely experimented
upon by an over-confident bowler. Is an excellent
change bowler, partial to a hard wicket and getting a
good and useful off-work. Played in four out of the
five test matches against the last Australian Eleven ;
was third on the list with the commendable average of
45.25; and responsible for 14 wickets, the wickets of
Hill, Gregory, Kelly, and Hughey Trumble falling in
succession to him in the first innings of the second
test match. Has been written of him that he is one
of the fairest wicket-keepers that ever lived, which in
itself is sufficient to ensure him popularity here, apart
from being a wholesome lesson to the “ aspiring and
over-zealous stoomper.” To those who have, by the
way, had the pleasure of the company of the late
Yorkshire Professional, G. Uylett (commonly known
as “ Happy Jack ”) who came out to Australia with an
English team no less than five times, report has it that
for a genial fellow we have Uylett’s counterpart in
Lilley. In stature being within a few inches of six
feet, this circumstance gives him the benefit of a long
reach, which he uses to advantage on both sides of the
wicket, reminding one of H. H. Stephenson in the
early sixties. Perhaps one of Lilley’s best all-round
performances was some few years back in the County
Championship matches, scoring not only over 1000
runs, but “ nipping ” 44 batsmen—34 caught and 10
stumped.

C. MCGAHEY.
(BY F. J. IRONSIDE.)
(Essex.) Born February, 1871, and his first visit to
Australia as a member of an English team. Con-
sidered one of the best players in his County, and
plays either a defensive or lively game. In the County
Championship matches in year 1900 was third in the
batting averages, his best score being 184 against
Leicestershire, and the finest innings ever played by
him in first-class cricket. In year named McGahey
was eminently successful for his County, getting into
three-figure scores altogether four times. Came out
as a visitor to Australia with Mr. Stoddart’s ’97 team,
and the compliment of being asked of him to take the
place of some few who had gone off was, so it was
said, narrowly averted. Possesses great punishing
powers, his driving being both clean and brilliant,
and also reliable and effective in the field. ' The last
Australian team’s first defeat (the second match) was
against Essex, and was brought about by the excellent
play of McGahey and Turner (not our Charley, by the
way) on a somewhat difficult wicket. This was the
only match McGahey played against the Australians,
his County (Essex) having only one engagement against
them, and that referred, to above. Referring to last
English season (1901), McGahey even improved upon
previous years’ form as a batsman, his best score being
145 and not out, aggregating in all 1838 runs, and
occupying tenth place in the general list of English
averages. Does not shine as a bowler, but in other
departments of the game evidently males up for this
deficiency.

A. O. JONES.
(BY F. J. IRONSIDE.)
(Nottinghamshire and Cambridge University) cap-
tain of former team. Born August 1873. His first
visit to Australia with an English team. A brilliant
and improving batsman, one of his most significant
performances perhaps being that against the last
Australian XI., playing for the Midlands County
Eleven. In this match he was 2} hours at the wickets,
his score of 90 being considered one of the best innings
played (though not absolutely in point of figures)
against the Australians, and likewise distinguishing
himself in the bowling department with 7 wickets for
110. Only played in one of the test matches against
Australia, and this was brought about by the ex-
ceptional good cricket shown by him for his County,
his score of 250 against Gloucestershire at Bristol, and
his 129 against Surrey at the Oval, both in 1899, on a
soft and sodden wicket, followed by consistent cricket,
no doubt having much to do with his selection against
the Australians in the fifth and final test match above
referred to. Gets most of his runs on the off, and
“ when going ” makes things somewhat lively and
interesting to those who like to see quick and lively
cricket. Up to August of present year (1901), Mr.
Jones, in conjunction with J. Ironmonger, established
a partnership record of 100 for the first wicket four
times, th" former’s scores being 88, 99 n. 0., 149, and
72. In yt >v 1899, Jones and Shrewsbury, for the first
wicket agaiust Gloucestershire, scored 391 runs, the
former making, after a partnership of 4} hours, 250
runs. Later still, against Essex in June last, played a
splendid innings for 249, and is one of the first four
players who aggregated over 2000 runs in the season
just closed, besides being a trusty bowler, having
taken 6 wickets for 26 runs against Essex in May last.
Has in the slips but few if any superiors.

C. BLYTHE.
(BY F. J. IRONSIDE.)
(Kent Professional.) His first visit to Australia
with an English team. What he lacks as a batsman
should prove him in good stead as a bowler, in this
latter department having somewhat suddenly come to
the front during the late English season of 1901. As
a bowler has an easy action in common (so it is writ-
ten) with the Yorkshire Professional, Rhodes. For
his county, Blythe headed the averages in the county
championship matches in season 1900, coming out in
the 22 matches with the excellent bowling average of
18.47, contributing as no doubt it did to many of the
victories achieved by Kent in the year named. Alfred
Shaw (who, it might be recollected captained three
English teams to Australia), took occasion, when
standing umpire in a match Kent against Somerset at
Taunton, to congratulate Blythe upon his “ spin and
length.” As a left-handed slow bowler with, as above
stated, an easy action, combining accuracy of pitch
and breaking both ways, he should give a good account
of himself in Australia, and more especially upon
soft and slow wickets. Indeed, if as good as repre-
sented, there is no reason to doubt but that he will
prove somewhat troublesome against the majority of
our Australian batsmen, who have not any peculiar
liking for slow deliveries, particularly when backed
up by accuracy of pitch, diversified break, and a well-
placed and reliable field. Blythe never having played
against the last Australian XL, it will be somewhat
interesting to us to see how far he will fare against
the “ cornstalks.” Suffice to say, Mr. Maclaren evi-
dently thought something of Blythe, and hence his
inclusion. As one cannot talk practical cricket, it
remains to be seen how far the selection was justified,
but there is no doubt that it was actuated by his
sudden reputation as a bowler of no mean order.

C. ROBSON.
(BY F. J. IRONSIDE.)
(Middlesex and Hampshire.) Born June, 1859, and
his first trip to Australia with an English team. Cap-
tain of the Hampshire XI. during year 1900, and
ostensibly selected as second or relieving wicket-
keeper of the English team, probably actuated by the
same reason which brought about the inclusion of
Board in Stoddart’s last Eleven in year 1897. Although
written of as “ a very useful cricketer and always safe
for runs,” his performances are not marked by any-
thing extraordinary, his best efforts, perhaps, being
those shown in 1899, when he was seventh for his
county in the county championship matches, with a
batting average of 25.45. Robson’s best score in
season 1900 was 101, and unquestionably from his
position as captain of the Hampshire team in year
named, succeeding Captain E. G. Wynyard, is ac-
credited with some good qualities, if not as a “ breaker
of records,” at least as possessor of something beyond
the ordinary run of cricketers. At the close of the
English cricket season in 1899, formed one of Ranjit-
sinhji’s team which visited America, and while doing
well as a bowler, taking 7 wickets with an average of
8.27, he occupied seventh place in the batting averages.
For the reason above stated, that of being chosen as
relieving wicket-keeper, it is not at all likely that
Robson’s services will be called very much into requi-
sition in the Australian tour, where those of the War-
wickshire professional (Lilley) are available. The risk
attached to the bringing out of only one wicket-keeper
with a team is always great, and hence the inclusion
of a second, as in the case of Robson, was thus kept
in view by Maclaren.

J. GUNN.
(BY F. J. IRONSIDE.)
(Nottinghamshire, Professional.) Born July, 1876.
His first visit to Australia with an English team. A
steady bat; in this particular department secured
second place for his County in the County Champion-
ship matches in season 1899, and in season following
likewise got into a good position. Though not having
distinguished himself hy any real tall scoring, there
must have been some “ special feature ” about him
which warranted his inclusion, possibly as an improv-
ing batsman. Towards the close of the 1901 season
occupied eighth position in Mr Maclaren’s selected
team, coming out as a batsman with the'commendable
average of 36.58 and again fifth in the order of merit
as a bowler with a fair average. In this latter depart-
ment, Gunn is a medium-pace leftlhander, and
judging by the way he is used as such by Notts, he
must be thought something of by his County. One
of Gunn’s special features is his fielding, and this,
coupled with his consistency as a batsman and his
usefulness as a good change bowler, are combined
qualities which were evidently kept in view by the
English Captain. Gunn never played against the
Australians on the latter’s last trip to England and of
course it is mere conjecture with the somewhat altered
conditions of Australian light and wickets how he
will fare in the States. As one of the youngest players
in the team so far he has an advantage, and this
combined with the fact of being on the improving side,
is one of those conditions which may hold him and
his side in good stead ere the “ English trip is over.”

Australia with an English team. The small man of
the team, with a good deal of cricket wrapped up in a
small parcel. Has strong defence, an inveterate stone-'
waller, and is a good change bowler. Accredited with
having done splendid work for Warwickshire in five
successive seasons, heading the list of batting averages
thus:—ln 1897, 46.80, 178 not out; in 1898, 60.95,
157 not out; in 1899, 54.81, 207 not out; in 1900,
58.00, 223 not out; in 1901, 56.16 and highest score
177. His three-figure scores above given carrying
with them, as may be seen, n.o. in four instances,
scarcely needs comment beyond the fact that all that
has been written of Quaife is by no means exaggerated.
Though not of the fast-scoring type of cricketer, as
above stated, his steady, plodding, and patient style
of play at times becomes useful, and has frequently
availed his side upon several notable occasions.
Played in two test matches against the last Australian
XI., but in neither of these was particularly success-
ful. Better success, however, attended him in
subsequent seasons, best exemplified by the fact that
his 117 not out, against Derbyshire last English
season, was Quaife’s fourth hundred in five successive
innings. A brilliant field with a sharp return. As a
stonewaller, however distasteful to the onlooker, at a
critical stage of the game one of Quaife’s stamp is
often essential to victory, and probably Maclaren had
this in view, apart from his other good qualities as a
cricketer, when selecting him as a member of his team.'

S. BARNES.
(BY F. J. IRONSIDE.)
(Lancashire Professional.) His first visit to Aus-
tralia with an English XI. As a batsman, has done
nothing very remarkable in first-class cricket, and
perhaps in this department might be ranked as the
weakest man in the team if figures be any criterion.
For his county (Lancashire), only played one match
in year 1899. Possibly Barnes’ success as a bowler in
the League matches, coupled with the fact of his re-
engagement by Burnley, had something to do with his
selection for the Australian tour. One of Barnes’
best performances was lately, taking 7 Ramsbottom
wickets for 15 runs, and playing a not-out innings for
71. The inclusion of Barnes from the onset created
some surprise, but possibly Maclaren’s knowledge of
Australian wickets, and the fact of Barnes’ several
successes with the ball, and the absence of the York-
shire bowlers, primarily actuated his being chosen.
Barnes’ career as a professional has been more
marked by his bowling than by his batting, in the
former case getting 9 wickets for 11 runs and winning
the “ Sunday Chronicle ” Prize. Upon a slow dead
wicket Barnes is all at home, and should a weather
circumstance bring this about in any of the States,
he is just the likely man to come off; in his selection,
possibly the Lancashire Captain had this in view,
being, to quote his own words, “ favorably impressed
with Barnes as a bowler.” What Barnes lacks as a
sensational batsman will probably be made up in
another way, that in bowling, which, under certain
conditions, is just about as important.

H. G. GARNETT.
(BY F. J. IRONSIDE.)
(Lancashire.) His first visit to Australia with an
English team. Unquestionably as a recruit, and
consequent upon his attaining a somewhat prominent
position as a batsman in his initial season for his
county this had something to do with his inclusion. It
was only during last English cricket season of 1901
that Garnett essayed to play first-class cricket, and in
this his batting average was 35.87. For a first-season
player in the advanced stage of cricket and aggregat-
ing close on 1800 runs, this is a possible record which
requires some beating. On, perhaps, the best of
English authority, is admittedly the best left-handed
batsman in England. As a recruit, it is given out, he
is the most promising, if not certainly the best, that
Lancashire has had for years, and his batting at the
close of last English season was both brilliant and
attractive. Is by no means a slow scorer, report
having it that upon one occasion he scored four times
faster than his county mate and felllow-representa-
tive, Maclaren. In English season 1900, Garnett only
played in two matches, his first appearance for Lan-
cashire, in which he scored 56 as against 77 top score,
made by Maclaren, showing excellent defence and con-
siderable power. As a young player with some ex-
ceptional records, will no doubt be watched with
interest in his advent in international cricket in the
States, not only by his Lancastrians admirers, but by
the “ Kangaroo element,” who invariably swear by the
aspirant, be it on the cricket field or on the water,
this regardless of circumstances, clannish or other-
wise.
