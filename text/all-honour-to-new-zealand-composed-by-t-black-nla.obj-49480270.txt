All Honour to New Zealand.
From far away New Zealand,
There came a happy band
Of fine, strong, strapping fellows
Into Egypts sunny land;
Each of them eager and anxious
At once to go to France,
To meet the Kaiser’s Uhlans,
And with them take their chance.
For the Kaiser he had threatened
To bring old England to her knees,
And take from her her colonies,
And sweep her Navy from the seas;
To crush the British Army
For ever off the earth!
But the Kaiser, he’ll be sorry
That he to the war gave birth.
For, when England war did declare
Upon her German foe,
The New Zealand lads, they shouted,
We are ready and willing to go,
To fight for the Motherland—
The land we love so dear,
And to show the German Uhlans
Of them we do not fear.
And when they came to Zeitoun,
To camp on the desert sand,
The lads from Lancashire welcomed them,
And shook them by the hand,
As brother should do to brother,
For are we not kith and kin—
Each here to do our duty
To help England her battles to win.
New Zealanders! we are proud of you,
Proud of you to a man!
For in the hour of England’s need,
‘ To arms ’ you eacli one ran,
As true ‘Sons of the Empire,’
You answered the nation's call
To show that you are true British
To the backbone one and all!
So, don’t you get down-hearted,
Because you are on Egypt’s sand,
For the day and hour is coming
When you will fight for the Motherland,
For we know that you will prove worthy
Of the trust that England’s placed
In you to win her battles,
When you meet the foe face to face.
And soon you will be leaving
To go and take your share,
In the war that is now raging,
Where we know you’ll do and dare;
But we hope you go to London first,
And see the dear Homeland,
For a “Tenakora” greeting will be your’s
As you march along The Strand!
And when your turn comes at the front,
We hope to be with you, too,
So that we may fight side by side,
For we know that you are True Blue,
And when the war is over
And homeward bound you be,
Carry the Lancashire lads' good wishes
To our friends across the sea.
