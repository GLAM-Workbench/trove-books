LANCASHIRE COUNTY CRICKET.
The annual meeting of the Lancasliire County and Manchester Cricket Club was
held at the Albion Hotel, Manchester, on February 5, 1880, Mr. A. B.
presiding. During the past year 215 new members had been admitted, the resigna-
tions numbering 50, and the total strength then was 1,792 annual members and 60
life members, in addition to 336 lady members. During the season 106,000 persons
had paid for admission at the gate, and the club had a balance of £1,431. It was
stated that the gate receipts at Watson’s benefit match amounted to £1,069, and the
donations to £258, making a total of £1,327; the total expenses of the match were
£226, and Watson consequently netted £l,lOl. 11s. Id. The report and balance
sheet were adopted, and the officers for the ensuing year were appointed, Sir
Humphrey de Trafford (since deceased), president, Mr. S. H. Swire, hon. secretary, and
Mr. Maclaren, treasurer. The club no doubt have had a great loss in the death of
their president, who had long shown great interest in the progress of cricket in the
County Palatine.
REVIEW OF THE SEASON.
During the past season Lancashire has not been so successful as many of her
well-wishers would have her. Out of 22 matches played we have only won 11, whilst
6 have been lost, and 5 were drawn. There were 14 games played with first-class
counties, 5 being won, the same number lost, and 4 drawn. Of the other games, we
beat M.C.C., and with Oxford University we played a drawn game at Oxford, but
had an easy victory at Old Trafford. There was only one Lancashire match with
the Australians, and that was lost, the county being poorly represented. In
the North of England and England matches our representatives did their share of
the work; in fact, Barlow very nearly won the latter game himself, as he was
very successful both in batting and bowling. The other visit to Lancashire was
against a Liverpool district team, captained by A. G. Steel, who again proved what
a sterling cricketer he is by doing the greater portion of the work, and the
visitors were decidedly lucky in getting off with a draw. This was anything but
a good result, and the most remarkable fact about the season was that we only
beat one county (Derbyshire) on their own ground, it looking as if our men could
not play off their own ground. Perhaps the most interesting fixture of the season
was the game with Notts, at Old Trafford, for the benefit of R. G. Barlow, when
Lancashire had the best of the play. There is no doubt that, with our best eleven,
we should be second to none; but with the great difficulty of getting the men to
play, we must be satisfied with our position. It is very satisfactory to see
Mr. A. N. Hornby once more at the top of the averages, and there is no doubt that
his cricket during the past season was as good as ever. Mr. A. G. Steel only played
three times, and his performance against Yorkshire soon shows what that means, as
he practically won the match himself. Mr. O. P. Lancashire was again at the
service of the Committee whenever wanted, and although not brilliant, did some
really good work in several games. Robinson, who was left out in the early part
of the season, played better and safer cricket than ever he did, and it is to be hoped
that he,will yet do the County good service. The backbone of the team is, as usual,
that powerful quartette, Briggs, Barlow, Watson, and Pilling, and there seems very
little chance of filling any possible vacancy amongst these men. Mr. A. Tcggin, as a
bovrter, has proved himself an acquisition, and has shown that he can play cricket as
well as football. Bennett Hudson, a Longsight professional and native of York-
shire, was tried, making a good start, which he did not keep up. Of the other new
men, J. Eccles and E. C. Hornby both showed form good enough to deserve further
trials. No fast bowler is yet found, and there is no doubt that it would add
greatly to our strength if one were unearthed for next season. Mr. A. N. Hornby,
at the latter end of the season, got several teams together to play against local
combinations, the games being for the benefit of professionals. The Lancashire
captain also got a team of gentlemen, with broomsticks, to play eleven ladies at
Nantwich, when the ladies were successful. In the extended averages of the season
it will be interesting to note that one member was caught out over twenty times in
thirty innings, and another member put his leg where his bat should have been five
times. More wickets were lost by catches than were clean bowled. These interesting
calculations are endless with the extended averages before you.

FULL SCORES AND BOWLING ANALYSIS OF
COUNTY MATCHES.
LANCASHIRE v. 20 COLTS OF WERNETH AND DISTRICT.
Played at Werneth on May 7th, and ended in a draw. This was rather an
unfortunate match, as only one day’s play could take place, rain completely
spoiling play on the Saturday. It will be seen from the score that only three men
got into double figures, A. Smith (who was afterwards tried for the County) and
M. Lawton both playing very fair cricket, while J. M. Woodhouse was at the wickets
a long while for his 11. None of the others did anytliing against Barlow and
Watson. The County had lost three wickets for 70 runs when time was called, and
no further play occurred. Lawton (C. G.) took two wickets for seven runs. Score

LANCASHIRE v. 18 COLTS OF ENFIELD AND DISTRICT.
Played at Enfield on May 14th and 15th, and ended in a draw. The County were
more fortunate in this their second trial game, as they were able to play both days.
None of the men came off with the bat, but in the bowling J. Heys, of Accrington,
who bowls a little more than medium pace, was very successful, he taking seven
wickets for 37 runs. He bowled Hornby, Briggs, Lancashire, C. H. Haigh, Smith,
and J. G. Heap. Briggs got five wickets for six runs in the Colts’ second innings.

LANCASHIRE v. M.C.C.
Played at Lord’s, on Tuesday, May 18th, and won by the County by six wickets.
This was the first game played! by the representatives of Lancashire, and was of an
extraordinary character. Play should have commenced on Monday, but rain
prevented it, so a start was made on Tuesday. The wicket, under the influence of
a strong wind and bright sun, was very difficult, the bowlers having nearly all their
own way. Thirty-four wickets fell in a little over five hours for 246 runs, or an
average of just over seven runs per wicket. The Lancashire captain was the only
man to make a respectable score, he getting 50 runs out of the 70 runs required to
win. Watson’s six wickets for eight runs was simply phenomenal, the next best
being Eylott’s seven for 22. The only previous instances of a first-class match
finishing in one day are as follows: —Surrey beat M.C.C. at Lord’s, in May, 1872;
First Australian team defeated M.C.C. at Lord’s in 1878; and also the game at
Birmingham, between Fourth Australian team and an England team, on May
26th, 1884. Score and analysis;—

LANCASHIRE v. DERBYSHIRE.
Tins match was played at Old Trafford on May 28th, 29th, and 30th, and ended in
a draw. No play took place on the first day on account of rain, and the wicket was
all in favour of the bowlers on the second, no one but Mr. Hornby being able to score,
he making 52 out of a gross total for the day of 150 for the loss of 22 wickets.
Watson’s analysis in the visitors’ first innings was remarkable, he taking seven
wickets for 15 runs. Rain again interfered on Saturday, making the wicket much
easier, and the game had to be abandoned at four o’clock. Frank Sugg (35) and
Cropper (26) made an invaluable stand on the last day, putting on 50 runs whilst
together, and also saving the match for their county. There were two first
appearances for the County in this match, viz., A. Teggin, a slow bowler from
Longsight, and A. Smith (of Notts birth), who was professional at Wemeth.
Teggin is the famous Rugby forward of the Broughton Rangers Football Club.

LANCASHIRE v. NOTTS.
Tliis match was played at Nottingham and was lost by an innings and 8$
runs. This was a most miserable beginning to the renewed engagements between
these two counties, who had not met for two years, on account of the
supposed unfair howling of Crossland. The Lancashire team was nothing
like a representative one, and, of course, our formidable antagonists did
nearly what they liked. Nottingham went in first and made 173; to tins the reply
was two very small totals of 42 and 48. Barlow was the best man, he making
the only double figures, 18; and also taking six wickets for 60 runs. Briggs managed
a pair of spectacles, being clean bowled by Walter Wright in both innings. Wright
and Attewell bowled so well on a suitable wicket that 16 wickets fell for 73 runs in
two hours and a-half on the Friday. The game finished so early that the Notts men
played a single wicket match. A. Champion (ex-Yorkshireman) was given a
chance, but he was not successful. Score and analysis:—

LANCASHIRE v. SURREY.
This match was played at the Oval on June 7th and Bth, and Lancasliire lost by
nine wickets. This was another defeat for the County Palatine, our men being able
to do little with the strong Surrey bowling. H. B. Steel made a promising appear-
ance, getting into double figures in both innings. Mr. P. Dobell (of Huyton) made
his first appearance for the County, and played fair cricket for 15 in the second
innings. Watson was the best bowler tor the losers. The winners had to thank
W. W. Read for his batting, and Lohmann for Ids excellent bowling on a wicket
which did not assist him. Score and analysis:—

LANCASHIRE v. OXFORD UNIVERSITY.
Played in the Parks at Oxford, on June 10th, 11th, and 12th, and ended in a draw.
Our side in this match was a little better than in the previous game, and a creditable
show was made. The University men did not do much against our bowling,
Briggs, Watson, and Barlow all doing well, the former’s analysis being:—9T overs,
5 maidens, 14 runs, and 5 wickets. In the second innings, our bowlers got knocked
about, and none of them came out very creditably, Messrs. Rashleigh, Page,
Hewitt, and Cobb all doing well. The Lancashire captain being absent, that duty
fell on O. P. Lancashire; and, on their going in to get the runs, he did his work so
well that 84 runs were on before he fell. H. B. Steel had to retire hurt, but P.
Dobell joined Barlow and these two kept their wickets up to call of time, so that we
were 92 runs behind with nine wickets to fall. Mr. E. C. Hornby made a brilliant
first appearance, as he made 82 runs. Score and analysis;—

LANCASHIRE v. KENT.
Played at Old Trafford on June 17th, 18th, and 19th, and was a win for the home
county by five wickets. The chief feature of the game was the brilliant display of
Briggs, who compiled 107 in first-class style. There were five 4’s, eleven 3’s, and
thirteen 2’s in it. The captain also played in his old-fashioned form for 46, and
Robinson played patiently tor 38. On going in to get the 70 runs required there
was a very big collapse, while the score was at eight Hornby, Briggs, and 0. P.
Lancashire all fell. Dobell now made a stand but at 43 the amateur fell, followed by
A. T. Kemble. On coming in, Robinson played badly, but soon steadied down, and
he and Barlow hit oft the runs. Teggin did very well with the ball, taking ten
wickets in the match for 87 runs—a good performance on a batting wicket. Lord
Harris and George Hearne deserve great credit for their batting in both innings.

LANCASHIRE v. SUSSEX.
Played at Old Trafford on June 24th and2sth, and was won by an innings and 144
runs. There were several pleasing features to Lancashire cricketers in this game,
as both our batting and bowling were alike successful. It took little over an hour
to get the southern county out, Teggin again doing well, and be was ably assisted
by llennett Hudson and Watson. On our going to the wicket, big scoring was the
order of the day; both of the new men, Hudson (of Longsight) and J. Eccles (of
Preston), doing well, whilst they were ably assisted by Briggs and Yates; the total
being 315. On going in a second time in a minority of 265 runs, Sussex did a little
better, but it was too much and they could only make 121. Barlow took no less
than nine wickets, six bowled, for 39 runs. Score and analysis:—

LANCASHIRE v. OXFORD UNIVERSITY.— (Return.)
Played at Old Trafford on June 28th, 29th, and 30th, and won by nine wickets.
Great interest was centred in this return game, the previous one having ended in a
draw. On going in, Hornby and Rarlow played a good game, and, despite several
changes of bowling, the score had been hit up to 191 before the captain fell. His
111 was made without giving a chance, and contained ten 4’s, six 3’s, and nine 2’s.
Barlow stayed with Hudson while another 50 runs were made, his score of 79 being
got by good defensive cricket. Very little can be said in favour of the 85 made by-
Hudson; it was certainly hard-hit, but there were several chances missed. No one
else did much. Being 181 runs in arrear, Oxford had to follow on and they
made 196; the County having thus to go in to make 16 runs, which they did for
the loss of one wicket (Robinson’s). Score and analysis: —

LANCASHIRE v. SURREY.— (Retuhn.)
Played at Liverpool on July Ist, 2nd, and 3rd, and resulted in a win for Lancashii
by an innings and 27 runs. This was perhaps the most remarkable match of tl
season, as the southerners were beaten very easily, only the two Reads, Roller, an
Lohmann being able to do much with the bowling. We had a first-class team, an
when Barlow fell at 16, A. G. Steel joined his captain, and the Surrey bowlin
received a severe handling, the score being 180 before the Liverpool amateur w£
brilliantly caught by W. W. Read. Briggs also did much as he liked with the bal
and in his score of 70 there were no less than nine 4’s. Several of the others di
something to help the score, but Hornby’s innings of 161 stands out as probably th
best he ever played. He was at the wicket dose on five hours, and only gav
two hard chances. In their second attempt Surrey did not do so well, andth
game ended as above. None of the bowling was extraordinary, the best bein
A. G. Steel’s in Surrey’s second attempt, when he got seven wickets for 95 rum

LANCASHIRE v. YORKSHIRE.
This match was played at Old Trafiord on July Bth, 9th, and 10th, and resulted
in a victory for the home county by four wickets. For this brilliant victory we
are greatly indebted to A. G. Steel, who (in the absence of A. N. Hornby) was
captain. In Yorkshire’s first attempt George Ulyett made 64 out of a total of 133,
whilst in our first A. G. made 55 out of 112, Briggs making another 23. In their
second innings several men did well, and 156 was scored, thus leaving us 177 runs
in arrear. A. G. Steel evidently did not intend to be out until the match was won,
he making 80 not out, by some defensive but still brilliant play, and his
example had a good effect, as every man played patiently. Robinson played good
cricket for his 37. Barlow and Watson were both successful, the former taking 12
wickets for 111 runs, and the latter seven for 61. Score and analysis:—

LANCASHIRE v. ESSEX.
Played at Old Trafford on July 15th, 16th, and 17th, and was won by an innings
and 227 runs. Several of the home team did well against the weak bowling of the
Essex men, and the large score of 378 was made. Barlow, Robinson, Yates, and C.
H. Haigh all played good cricket. Only two men in the first innings of Essex and
three in the second got into double figures against the bowling of Barlow and
Briggs, the latter taking nine wickets for 46 runs, and the former nine for 63. Pilling
caught two and stumped three. Score and analysis:—

LANCASHIRE v. GLOUCESTERSHIRE.
Hayed at Old Trafford on July 22nd, 23rd, and 24th, and ended in a draw. This
was evidently Briggs’ day out, as he was successful with both hat and ball. The
rain interfered greatly on the first two days, and only two or three hours’ play took
place each day; but a full day was put in on Saturday. Lancashire going in first,
Mr. Hornby played a defensive game for his 21; hut when Briggs went in there
was some lively play as his 72 was knocked up in 65 minutes, there being eleven 4’s
in it. Watson also played a lively innings for 24. In their second innings, the
captain played as hard a hit innings for 66 as ever he did, there being a 5 and nine 4’s;
and he was ably assisted by C. H. Haigh who made 42 by some steady play. W. G.
Grace had to retire hurt, and none of his men did much. The champion got nine
wickets for 108 runs, whilst Briggs took 7 for 50. Score and analysis:—

LANCASHIRE v. YORKSHIRE.— (Retubn.)
Played at Dewsbury on July 29th and 31st, and ended in a draw. The weather
seriously interfered with the game, play beginning at four o’clock on the first day,
and no play at all on the second; and then on the Saturday the wicket was aU in
favour of the bowlers. The Lancashire team was not very strong, and the absence
of A. G. Steel, who had done so much to win the first match, was felt. Bower,
the Nelson professional, was tried, but did nothing. The Yorkshiremen went to
the wickets first, and, but for the steady play of George Ulyett and Preston, the
innings would have soon finished, these two men getting 61 out of the 109 got from
the bat. In their second innings they did a little better, making 107 for the loss of
seven wickets. The scoring of the home team was not good, but the visitors did
worse, Briggs being the only man to withstand Emmett and Bates. Forty was up
for the fall of the second wicket, and then four wickets fell at 42, the full total
being 48 from the bat. Emmett took four wickets in 12 balls for only one run at
one time, his wickets eventually costing ten runs, and Bates took six for 19.
Watson and Briggs were the only men to do much with the ball, the former getting
five wickets for 25 runs in Yorkshire’s second attempt. Score and analysis:—

LANCASHIRE v. CHESHIRE.
Played at Old Trafford on August 2nd and 3rd, and ended in an easy victory
for Lancashire. This was a very one-sided game, the men from the “cheese
county ” being greatly overmatched, only two, Davenport and Pointon, being able
to score'off the bowling; in fact, they made 127 runs out of a total of 168 made from
the bat. Eight of our men got into double figures, the top scorers being Robinson,
Barlow, and O. P. Lancashire. Briggs did a fine performance with the ball, taking
11 wickets for 75 runs. In the Cheshire first innings Barlow must have been
unplayable, as he took 4 wickets for 7 runs. Our - genial captain had a hand in the
bowling, but he was not successful. Score and analysis.—

LANCASHIRE v. NOTTINGHAM.— (Return,)
Benefit of Barlow.
Played at Old Trafford on August sth, 6th, and 7th, and ended in a draw. This
was the inter-county match of the home season, as the two counties had not met
for two seasons, and the fact that it was for the benefit of one of our most useful
professionals lent considerable interest to it. The home team was the strongest
that had been put in the field during the season, whilst the composition of the
Notts team was as usual. The play was, to a certain extent, interfered with each
day by rain, it being sufficient to cause the game to be unfinished at the call of
time on Saturday. There were over 5,000 spectators present when Messrs.
Hornby and Barlow came out to bat on a splendid wicket, which must have been
very carefully looked after by Watson to have got it into such excellent condition.
Barlow was well received by the spectators, the applause being joined in by the
Notts players. It was soon seen that we were to have a big performance, as the
captain was playing much steadier than usual, never letting a loose ball off, and
always playing the correct game. Ten after ten went up amidst applause, and
despite several changes of bowling the pair were still together at lunch time. On
resuming the score rose to 109, before the captain was caught, his score being 88,
and he had been at the wicket two hours and fifty minutes without making a
mistake. Barlow just made 50, he being at the wicket quite four hours. At one
time he was 17, for which he was playing three hours and five minutes, but in
contrast to this, after an interval through rain, he put 15 runs on in about two
minutes. It was rather amusing to watch his anxiety to reach his 50, and he and
A. G. Steel ran some rather short runs to attain that end. A. G. and H. B. Steel
did not do much, but Briggs played a wonderfully steady game, and was not to be
tempted even by the veteran Shaw, who sent some balls to the off, which took all
the caution the little man possessed to keep him off. E. C. Hornby played excellent
cricket for his score of 34, and every man, with the solitary exception of Watson,
got into double figures, the score being 323, a splendid performance against such
bowling and fielding, and the highest score ever made against Notts. There was
some very steady and careful play on the part of the champion county, and do
what they would they could not put runs on very fast, the bowling and fielding
being as good as the County Palatine ever did. Shrewsbury was at the wicket three
hours and forty minutes for his 67, the total amounting to 192. This caused a
follow on, and it was soon seen that the visitors intended playing a strictly
defensive game; in fact, at one time Shrewsbury was at the wicket an hour for a
run. This play caused the game to be drawn. Barlow, Briggs, and A. G. Steel all
did some good bowling, and it would be invidious to single any one out for fielding
where every one did so well. Despite the rain there would be quite 30,000 spectators
to witness the game during the three days, and it has been stated that the result
of the benefit will be that Barlow will receive over £1,100; but this will not be
known until his return from Australia. Score and analysis:—

Before going on his journey to the Antipodes, Barlow sent the following letter to
the newspapers:—
“ Sir, —Before leaving these shores for those of Australia, I should like to thank those
clubs and gentlemen who so heartily and so kindly worked to make my benefit match
so great a success. In the first place, my gratitude is due to the Lancashire County-
Committee, who so generously set apart one of the most attractive matches on their
card for my benefit, and who headed my subscription list with the substantial sum
of £25. Besides this, the members of the club were all very kind, and I beg to
especially thank my captain (Mr. A. N. Hornby) and Mr. O. P. Lancashire for the
very great amount of interest they took on my behalf. I desire also, through your
columns, to thank the Marylebone Club, the Australian cricketers, the Melbourne
Cijcket Club, and the county clubs of Nottingham, Surrey, Essex, and Yorkshire
tor the handsome donations they added to the subscription list.
“ I should like, Mr. Editor, to trespass on your space and thank each and every
gentleman for the support they accorded me, and letters they have sent me wishing
me every success; but, of course, that is out of the question, much as I may wish it.
“ The benefit match, I am pleased to say, was successful far beyond my expecta-
tions, and I am afraid 1 shall never repay the many kindnesses extended to me by
all classes, including the Press.
“ In the natural course of things I cannot expect to go on playing in first-class
cricket matches for many more years, but everyone may rest assured that when
called upon I will always do my very utmost to uphold the cricketing honour of
my native country and county.
“ Thanking you in anticipation for the insertion of this letter,
“ I remain yours, &c.,
“Kichaed Goeton Baelow..
“ Old Trafford, Manchester, September 14.”

LANCASHIRE v. SUSSEX.— (Retuen.)
Played at Brighton on August 9,10, and 11, and lost by four wickets. This game
came to a rather sensational finish, considering the easy defeat the Southerners had
met with on their visit to Old Trafford. The Lancashire men went to the wickets
first and made 211, of which Robinson, by some excellent play, made 54. Sussex
replied with 200, of which Tester and F. Thomas each made 58. But now came the
sensation, as seven of the Lancashire men went down for 29 runs, the wicket playing
veiy bad, and suiting the bowlers. But the wicket did not wholly account for the
bad display, two men were run out and another was leg before wicket. F. M. Lucas
made two good catches, and the fielding was excellent. At this point, O. P. Lanca-
shire came to the rescue with 21; but the total was only 60, thus leaving Sussex
72 runs to get to win. This they did for the loss of six wickets, the game being
in the balance'until the last run was made, as the bowling and fielding of the
Lancashire team was very good. Score and analysis:—

LANCASHIRE v. DERBYSHIRE.— (Return.)
Played at Derby on August 16th and 17th, and ended in an easy victory for
Lancashire by ten wickets. Derbyshire was not so successful as in the previous
game at Old Trafford, when on account of the rain they made a draw, their scores
being 84 and 43 only, Frank Sugg having made 40 out of the 84. This was chiefly
due to the excellent bowling of Watson, who took 12 wickets for 55 runs, and
Barlow and Briggs, the former’s three wickets costing 17 runs and the latter’s four
53 runs. Rev. V. F. Royle made his appearance in this match, but he was not
successful with the bat. Lancashire only made 119 and 12 for no wicket, this being
sufficient to win as above. Score and analysis:—

LANCASHIRE v. CHESHIRE. — (Return.)
Played at Stockport on August 20th and 21st, and was won by an innings and 193
runs. This was an even more disastrous defeat for Cheshire than the previous
game, only J. Bretherton getting into double figures in both innings. There
were no less than nine men tried their hand with the ball in the long innings of
Lancashire, Wotherspoon being the most successful, getting six wickets for 81
runs. When three wickets had fallen, Messrs. O. P. Lancashire and J. Eccles got
together, and gave their opponents a treat, as they put on 184 runs before they
were separated. Robinson having assisted with a 44, the score reached 359, which
was far too many for the Cheshire men, as they only put on 55, thus being beaten
as above. Brown strained his thigh whilst fielding, so was not able to bat in the
second innings. This, of course, weakened the losers. Briggs and Watson in the
first innings of Cheshire, and Barlow and Briggs in their second, remained on un-
changed, Barlow being the best, he taking 3 wickets for 13 runs, all being cleaned
bowled.

LANCASHIRE v. KENT—(Return).
Played at Maidstone, on August 23rd, 24th, and 25th, and lost by nine wickets.
Tins was the beginning of a disastrous week’s cricket for Lancashire, as in the
same week they went down before Kent and Gloucester. On Lancashire going in,
no one could do anything on a queer wicket with the deliveries of Wootton and
Martin, the former taking 8 wickets for 27 runs, the total being only 77. Their
opponents did not do much better, as they were all out for 89, this being chiefly due
to the fine play of Pilling, who caught no less than five men, taking the first 4
wickets that feu. Four of these catches were off Barlow. On going in a second
time, only Hornby (23) and Watson (20) did. anything, and the total was 82.
The runs required to win were got for the loss of only one wicket, Frank Heame
playing a splendid innings for 56, not out, while George Heame kept his wicket up
by some steady play, and the runs were hit off despite the good fielding of the
losers. Briggs, Watson, and Yates all did well with the ball in the first innings, the
latter getting 3 wickets for 14 runs. Score and analysis:—

LANCASHIRE v. GLOUCESTERSHIRE.— (Return.)
Played at Clifton on August 26th, 27th, and 28th, and lost by 31 runs. The result
of the first game of the season between these two counties was a draw in favour of
Lancashire; but this time they were just too good, despite the big attempt to save
the defeat by Robinson and Pilling. Gloucester were 66 runs behind in their first
attempt; in the second they made an excellent stand,the score being226,thus
leaving Lancashire 161 runs to get to win; but this they failed in doing, and lost
by only 31 runs. Score and analysis :

LANCASHIRE v. ESSEX.—(Return.)
Played at Leyton on August 30, 31, and September 1, and won by eight wickets.
This was the last of the county engagements, and it was won pretty easily, same as
the first engagement of the season. Essex played a good innings for 209, and
Lancashire just topped it by 23, both being excellent displays of all-round hitting.
The Southerners did not do nearly so well in their second attempt, their score being
115, thus leaving Lancashire 93 runs to get to win. Homby and Barlow made a
fair beginning, but it was left to Vernon Hoyle and Robinson to get the runs, the
latter being not out with 51, a brilliant display. Score and analysis: —

LANCASHIRE CRICKET ITEMS.
Cricket began to look up in Lancashire in 1864, when games were first played in
the name of the County. Eight matches were played, but no averages taken.
Amongst the names mentioned are several Kowleys, J. Makinson, E. J. Bousfield,
S. H. Swire, J. B. Payne, and E. Whittaker, all honoured names amongst Lancashire
cricketers.
Only four games were played in 1865, of which one was won, two lost, and one
drawn. In the match with Middlesex both teams scored the same total in first
innings, viz., 243.
The year 1866 was chiefly remarkable for the first appearance of Mr. A. N. Hornbyi
who played for the Gentlemen against the Gentlemen of Yorkshire, when he only
made 13 and 8. He had previously played for Cheshire Gentlemen against
Lancashire Gentlemen, when he made 38 and 6.
Some remarkable scoring took place in 1867, 429 being scored against Surrey, and
586 for Gentlemen of Lancashire against Gentlemen of Yorkshire, E. B. Eowley and
E. Whittaker each making over the “ century.”
In 1868 Lancashire first played Nottingham, when they lost both matches. In
same year Lancashire was got out by Yorkshire for 30 and 34, at Holbeck, George
Freeman taking 12 wickets for 23 runs, and Tom Emmett 7 for 24.
In 1869, Mr. A. N. Hornby was at the top of the averages with 31T for six innings,
and also in the following year with 38'4, when he made his first century for the
County, it being against Yorkshire, at Old Trafford. In same year he made 132
against Hampshire, also on the home ground.
Hiekton in 1870 took 6 wickets of Surrey, at Old Trafford, for 17 runs, and during
the same season he got all the 10 wickets of Hampshire, in their second innings, for
46 runs.
In 1872 Lancashire beat both Yorkshire and Derbyshire twice each.
In 1874, at Old Trafford, Watson took 9 wickets for 108 runs, the other Derbyshire
man being run out.
In 1875 A. N. Homby and Barlow made 148 runs, required to beat Yorkshire’
without a wicket falling.
A. G. Steel (having made his first appearance for the County in previous year)
took 9 wickets in Yorkshire second innings, at Old Trafford, for 63 runs, in 1878.
He also took 6 Notts wickets for 19 runs, at Old Trafford, in same year. Pilling was
responsible for 6 wickets in Notts match. In same year Barlow took 8 Yorkshire
wickets for 22 runs.
W. M'lntyre took 5 wickets for 17 runs, against Yorkshire, at Old Trafford, in
1879. Against Gloucester, at same place, he took 10 wickets for 64 runs, and
A. G. Steel 9 for 63. In the return, Watson took 6 for 29.
In 1880, Lancashire made 204 in each innings, against Derbyshire, at Old Trafford,
and during the same season, at the home ground, Watson took 6 Kent wickets for
18 runs.
Greatest number of runs ever made for the County, in any season, was made by
A. N. Hornby, in 1881, when he made 962, and had the highest average, viz., 53'8.
In 1881 Watson bowled 19'2 overs, 15 maidens, for 8 runs, and 4 wickets, against
Gloucester. Crossland, in Surrey match, at the Oval, took 7 wickets for 14 runs,
three with consecutive balls. At Derby, Barlow took 6 wickets for 3 runs, in 10T
overs, 9 being maidens; in the second innings, Nash bowled 9 overs, 4 maidens, for 9
runs, and 4 wickets.
In 1882, G. Nash took 5 Somerset wickets with 5 consecutive balls, at Old Trafford.


In 1882, at Trent Bridge ground, Barlow carried his bat right through second
innings for 5 runs. In 1884, on same ground, for the North v. Australians, he took
10 wickets for 46 runs. He scored 10 not out, and saw eight men out in second
innings and made 101. In 1882 Barlow carried his bat through innings four times,
once each against Australians and Gloucester, and twice against Notts, and he
took 6 Derbyshire wickets for 3 runs.
Lancashire was champion county in 1881 and 1882.
In the ten seasons Pilling has performed for Lancashire, he has played in 134
matches, scoring 1,235 runs. But, of course, his strong point is behind the wicket,
and in that position he has caught 198 and stumped 108, so that he has been
responsible for the downfalPof over 300 wickets.
In May, 1885, Briggs got 173 out of a total score of 396, against Kent, at Old
Trafford. A sensational stand was made at Liverpool, against Surrey, by Briggs (186)
and Pilling (61 not out), putting on 173 runs for the last wicket. G. M. Kemp’s first
appearance for Lancashire at Huddersfield, July 23, 24, and 25, when he made 37 and
109, against Yorkshire. Briggs took 9 Derbysliire wickets for 29 runs, at Derby.
Mr. A. Appleby first played for County in 1866; R. G. Barlow and Watson, at Derby,
in 1871; W. M‘lntyre, against Yorkshire, at Old Trafford, in 1872; Rev. V. F. Hoyle,
at Sheffield, in 1873; F’rank Taylor, at Old Trafford, against Yorkshire, in 1874;
A. G. Steel and R. Pilling, at Old Trafford, against Sussex, in 1877; Crossland, at
Huddersfield, in 1878; Briggs and Nash, at Nottingham, in 1879; Walter Robinson,
at the Oval, against Surrey, in 1880.
In the past season Pilling stumped 18 and caught 36, Barlow and Briggs each
made 15 catches in the field; Watson and A. N. Hornby 14 each; Robinson and
C. H. Haigh 7 each; A. Teggin, O. P. Lancashire, and Yates 5 each; A. G. Steel, 3;
Hudson and J. Eccles, 2 each; and the following 1 each: Roper, Champion, Dobell,
H. B. Steel, Kemble, Moss, E. C. Hornby, aud Vernon Royle.
Barlow caught 6 men off his own bowling, Watson 3, Briggs and A. G. Steel 2,
and Teggin 1.
R. G. Barlow, during the time he has played tor Lancashire, has given good proof
of what he is made of. The foUowing summary of each year’s performances \yill
be interesting. In 1871 his batting average was IST, and bowling average 10'5 per
wicket: in 1872 lie only made 7'2 per innings, and did not bowl; in 1873 it was
13-3 and 10T ; 1874,13 T; 1875, 38 8* and 15'2; 1876, 20 4 and 18 5; in 1878, 21T1
and 3P4; in 1879, 20 6 and 10 21; in 1880, 15T and 11'4; in 1881, 2917 and 9-23;
in 1882, 3016* and 9'72; in 1883, 25'5 and 13 82; in 1884,18'29 and 12T0; in 1885,
30 - !* and 15'44; in 1886,19T0 and 12-83. In 1884 he took 108 wickets. The *to
the batting averages denotes that Barlow was at the top that season.
The Lancashire Cricket Cup was first put up for competition in 1885, when Bacup
beat Darwen in the final, the scores being.- Bacup, 112 and 123; Darwen, 90 and 76.
This year the Darwen club again ran into the final, and had to meet Church, with a
somewhat similar result to the previous season, as the latter club won easily by an
innings and 41 runs. Score: Church, 159 ; Darwen, 61 and 57.

THE AUSTRALIANS IN LANCASHIRE.
AUSTRALIANS v. NORTH OF ENGLAND.
Played at Old Trafford on May 31st, and was a draw. None of the Australian
teams have as yet beaten a North of England team, and it was unfortunate that rain so
interfered as to completely stop play on the second and third days. The bad
weather had so affected the wicket that the bowlers of both sides did nearly what
they liked, and it is not often that 31 wickets have fallen in one day, and at an
average of just over four runs per wicket. Our visitors first went to the wicket and
were all out for 45, S. P. Jones having made 15 of them. Peate’s analysis was a
wonderful one, eight wickets for 23 runs. Not one of the North team could get into
double figures against Spoftorth and Palmer, the former getting seven wickets for
19 runs, the score being only 34, six of them being extras. Against the bowling of
Watson and Peate, the Australians could do nothing once more, they only making
43 this time. After this, there were still thirty minutes to play, and the North lost
a wicket for 15 runs. This was certainly a remarkable day’s play, and all the honours
go to the bowlers, the two bowlers on each side not being changed either innings.
Watson’s six wickets for 12 runs in 27 overs, 18 of them being maidens, was the
best. Score and analysis;—

AUSTRALIANS V. LANCASHIRE.
Played at Old Trafford on June 14th, 15th, and 16th, and lost by an innings and
12 runs. Our batting, against the excellent trundling of Giffen, was of the feeblest,
the only man to come off being H. B. Steel, who made 21 and 24 out of scores of 46
and 87. The Australians were fortunate to go in on a wet and easy wicket, and
put on 60 runs for no wicket, but on the following morning all their wickets fell for
an addition of 85 runs. Giffen’s average for 16 wickets was just over four runs per
wicket. Score and analysis:—

AUSTRALIANS v. ENGLAND.
Played at Old Trafford on July sth, 6th, and 7th, and won by England, by four
wickets. This was the first of the three representative games between the
picked teams of England and Australia, and our visitors made a bad start by
losing it. Jones and Scott both played well, and gave a lot of trouble to get rid of
them. Seven of the Englislimen got into double figures, and three did the same in
the second. Great credit is due to Barlow for his excellent batting (38 not out and 30)
and bowling, he taking seven wickets for 44 runs, in the second innings. Pilling also
deserves great praise for his grand display behind the sticks, as there were only four
extras in a total score of 328. Score and analysis:—

AUSTRALIANS v. LIVERPOOL AND DISTRICT.
Played at Liverpool on July 16th and 17th, and ended in a drawn game. This
team was simply made up of amateurs and professionals in the Liverpool district.
Great credit was due to Mr. A. G. Steel for the splendid display he made both in
batting and bowling. The visitors went to the wicket first and scored 152, of which
Giffen and MTlwraith made 76. A. G. took four wickets for 46 runs, and Smith
three for 29 The local captain made 55, and he was materially assisted by E. C.
Hornby and Shore, the score being 204, or 52 runs on. In their second innings the
visitors made a bad start, losing six wickets for 82, but then Scott and Trumble got
together and made a stand, but just before five the rain came down heavier and
compelled them to retire and draw the stumps. The Australians were only 89 on
with two wickets to fall, so that the draw was slightly in favour of the local team.

THE COUNTY CRICKET SEASON.
During the past county cricket season there were 59 matches played, of which
no less than 16 ended in that unsatisfactory way, drawn game, the other 43 being
brought to a definite conclusion. Notts have again gained the highest honours,
closely followed by Surrey, Lancashire coming third. The following is the full list:—
The next table gives the highest and lowest innings played for each county, and
the highest and lowest innings played against each county: —
* For live wickets.
The total runs scored by each county, the number of wickets that each county
lost, with the average runs of each wicket, throughout the season, are as follows:
The next series of figures is that which tells the story of the bowling, as the
above table does of the batting—the total number of runs scored against each
county, the total number of wickets taken, and the average runs per wicket of
the opposing batsmen;—

CENTURIES IN COUNTY CRICKET IN 1886.
Twenty-seven individual innings of 100 and upwards have been recorded but of
these Shrewsbury’s 227 (not out) was the only one in which the third century
was entered upon. Surrey and Kent are each credited with five, Yorkshire and
Sussex with four, Notts with three, Middlesex, Lancashire, and Gloucestershire
with two each, Derbyshire being unrepresented. Of the 27, seven were made
against Kent bowling, five against Gloucestershire, four against Surrey, three each
against Derbyshire and Middlesex, two each against Sussex and Yorkshire, one
against Notts, while no century was scored off the excellent bowling of the
Lancastrians.

LONDON, - August 31st, 1886.
“In the interest of our many football readers I must draw their attention
to the preparations of Mr. Bowden. Our cycling friends are fully aware of
their virtues, and that for bruises and sprains they have no equal. Having
received great benefit from their use during the summer, I recommended
them to several of our leading cricketers, and in each instance I have received
the greatest thanks. Spillman, the Middlesex wicket keeper, was not only
rapidly cured from the effects of a very bad blow, which disabled him for
some time, by the use of ‘HIPPACEA,’ but he also informed me that when
his hands had given way on the second day of an important match, a liberal
application overnight rendered him on the following morning perfectly able
to get through his arduous duties with satisfaction to himself and his captain.
This speaks volumes.”—The “ATHLETIC NEWS.”
N.B. —“HIPPACEA” imparts marvellous freshness if used after severe
fatigue.
♦
5, South Street, Exeter,
29th July, 1886.
I can speak in the highest praise of “TIIILUM.” On Sunday last I took a
thirty miles tramp on Dartmoor, and being caught in the rain when too late to
retrace my steps, had to walk for several hours in a regular downpour, getting
extremely wet about the lower limbs. Tbe result of this was an excessive
stiffness of the legs and very sore feet, so much so that I could scarcely walk
on Monday. This was most unfortunate, as our Club Twenty-five Miles Eoad
Handicap, for which I was entered, was to be run on yesterday (Wednesday).
I gave myself a good rubbing with “TIIILUM” two or three times, both on
Monday and Tuesday, competed in the handicap on Wednesday, and landed
home a winner by two minutes, riding the twenty-five miles on a tricycle in
the good time of Ih. 48m., so that you see that “TIIILUM” took all the stiffness
and soreness out of me.
W. H. CASLEY.
15, Berkley Street, Liverpool,
20th July, 1880.
I found your “HIPPACEA” of great value on my recent ride from Land’s
End to John o’Groat’s. The first time it was applied 1 was simply astonished at
the effect. It removes any stiffness instantly, and I shall recommend it to all
mv friends as the very best thing of its kind that has ever been invented.
