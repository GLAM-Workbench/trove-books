THE
TRANSPORT’S
Farewell.
COME all you thoughtless, idle lads,
A warning take by me,
M have you quit night walking,
T ' ■'* company ;
* w . ou J nlayhouses,
And shun
Leave off your cards aiK* ,
Or else you’ll rue the day,
You will rue your transportation my laci»,
When you’re sent unto Botany Bay.
I was brought up in London town
A place I knew full well,
Brought up by honest parents,
And educated well.
Brought up by honest parents,
And reared most tenderly,
Till I became a roving blade,
Which proved my destiny.
My character being taken.
And sent I was to gaol.
And at the last assizes,
As I could find no bail.
And at the last assizes.
The Judge to me did say,
The Jury’s found you guilty, my lad.
You must go to Botany Bay.
There was my aged father dear.
And he stood near the bar.
Likewise my tender mother,
Her old grey locks she tore,
And as her old grey locks she tore,
These words to me did say,
O son, O son, what have you done,
To be sent unto Botany Bay.
As we were sailing down the Thames,
On the twenty-first of May,
Leaving our friends behind us.
It’s a hard thing for to say.
And every ship that we pass’d by,
We heard the sailors say,
There goes a ship of handsome lads,
And they’re bound unto Botany Bay.
There lives a girl in London town,
A girl I love most dear,
And if I gain my sweet liberty,
With her I will take my share.
And if ever I gain my sweet liberty.
With her I will remain,
1 will bid adieu unto Van Dieman’s Land
And adieu to the raging main.
