Art. Xlll.— Australian. Aboriginal Stone Implements.
A suggested Glassification.
A. S. KENYON and D. L. STIRLING.
(With Plates XXY-XXXIII).
[Read 4th October, 1900.]
(Communicated by Professor Baldwin Spencer).
It appears hardly necessary to enlarge on the need for a
classification of the stone implements of the Australian Aborigi-
nal. All investigators, as well as collectors, have experienced
difficulties through such want. The subject of these stone
implements, and their uses is one to which little attention has
been paid by writers on the Ethnology of the Australian
Aboriginal ; R. Brough Smyth in “ The Aborigines of Victoria ”
has dealt with the subject in some detail; but his remarks, being
confined only to descriptions of the implements coming under his
notice, do not include amongst others, any of the very interesting
series of chipped implements of palaeolithic type occurring
commonly in Victoria. In general, authors, save for cursory
remarks as to use of other stone implements, have confined their
attention to the ground cutting edged implements, generally
known as “ Blackfellow’s axes or tomahawks.” These tools are
so easily recognisable that they are readily picked up by others
than collectors, and are to be found in number in all collections.
Other stone implements, even when so distinctive in shape as
grinding mills or sharpening stones, are not so easily recognised
by the non-collector, and they are contained in few collections.
The less distinctive implements have not been described, and
when occurring in collections, are frequently wrongly labelled. ' A
further reason for the undue preponderance of axes or toma-
hawks in collections is that they are found scattered over the
whole country, while almost all the other implements are found
at the sites of camps only, being chiefly used in domestic
operations.

Mr. Smyth 1 divided the stone implements used by the natives
into eleven groups, which were :
a. Hatchets.
b. Knives.
c. Adzes.
d. Chips of basalt for jagged spears.
e. Chips of basalt for cutting and scraping skins of
animals, etc.
f. Stones for pounding roots, seeds, etc.
g. Stones for sharpening spears and hatchets.
h. Stones for fishing.
i. Stones used by women in making baskets.
j. Stones from which ruddle, etc., are obtained.
k. Sacred stones kept by priests and others.
This arrangement does not include “ throwing” or “game”
stones ; and includes, in groups j and k, ruddle stones, and sacred
stones which are hardly properly classed under the term
implement. If, as it appears was the intention, the groups were
to show all the uses of stone by the aboriginals, building and
fire stones should also have been included.
Mr. R. Etheridge, Junr., 2 commenced a tentative classification
of the ground cutting edged implements; but, unfortunately,
he has not carried out his expressed intention of completing this
work, 3 and it is understood that he has abandoned the project.
The writers, in the course of their work in collecting stone
implements in Victoria, found it imperative to make a classifica-
tion of them, and, with a view to eliciting criticisms or suggestions
for improvement, now submit this classification to members inter-
ested. It is one which they believe will prove of use to the
collector, and serve as a guide to investigators. To some of the
groups are attributed uses differing from those given by other
writers, and some of them have been hitherto unrecognised and
undescribed.
Unfortunately, the methods of employment of many of the
groups are not known with any degree of certainty; particularly
so as regards the stone implements of the aboriginals formerly

inhabiting South Eastern Australia and Tasmania. The classi-
fication suggested has, therefore, not been entirely based on
methods of use, a system which would appear to be the most
satisfactory ; but is, in some cases, dependent upon the apparent
mode of preparation or manufacture.
The first step in classification has been to group together all
the different implements having distinctive uses. The first group
und the most important is that of cutting implements. Next in
order come the groups of grinding and pounding implements. Of
lesser importance are fishing stones, throwing stones, game
stones and basket stones. A distinct group may be required for
those implements, the use of which is not definitely known and
can hardly at present be conjectured, such as the carrot-shaped
stones from the Darling River District, Victoria, etc.
Ceremonial or sacred stones are not considered to come properly
under the term implements, and, for like reason, building, fire,
and pigment stones are excluded.
The first group of cutting implements, distinguished by C.,
separate easily into two divisions—A. those having the cutting
edge produced by flaking or chipping; 8., those having the
cutting edge produced by grinding and polishing. The division
C. A., is arranged in seven subdivisions, bearing as titles the names
of the European tools most nearly representing the uses to which
the implements would be put. They are : —I. Axes, 11. Rasps,
111. Knives, IV. Adzes, V. Scrapers, VI. Spearheads, and VII.
Nuclei or Cores. The last is not strictly a proper subdivision \ but
it is necessary for the classification of a collection of flaked or
chipped edged implements. Subdivision C. A. 1., flaked or chipped
edge axes, forms two sections, a. those having a chipped edge, and
b. those having a flaked edge. The section C. A. I. b. is not
further subdivided, there being only one class known, which is
the flaked axe, hafted, with a head larger than, but otherwise
closely resembling the hafted knives of Central Australia. The
section C. A. I. a. is subdivided into two classes —1. those chipped
on one side only of the cutting edge, and 2. those chipped on
both sides. Classes C. A. I. a. 1. has two sub-classes, a. those
with an acute and (3. those with an obtuse bevel. Neither
of these sub-classes have apparently been hafted, being for hand
use only. The Tasmanian axes belong to the first sub-class,
€. A. I. a. 1. a. 2A


The class C. A. I. a. 2, axes chipped on both sides, has also
two sub-classes; a. those hafted, comprising the West Aust-
ralian examples, and /3. those not hafted. The subdivision C.
A. 11., Rasps, includes implements which have a concave cutting
or scraping edge, used for scraping hafts of spears, waddies, etc.,
and is not further divided.
The subdivision C. A., 111., knives, separates easily into two
sections, a. those hafted and b. those not hafted. The section
C. A., 111., a. has two classes: 1. single flake, and 2. multiple flake.
The class C. A., 111., a. 1., forms two sub-classes, a. chipped and
ft. flaked. These sub-classes comprise the hafted knives of
Central Australia. The class C. A., 111., a. 2., multiple flake,
comprises those knives formed by the placing of a number of
small flakes in a setting of gum on a wooden haft; and is not
further divided.
The Section C. A., 111., b. knives not hafted, is subdivided into
two classes—l. chipped, and 2 flaked. These classes comprise
the Tasmanian knives and many examples from the mainland.
The subdivision C. A., IV., adzes comprises the very fine
examples from Central Australia, and the smaller ones from
South Eastern Australia, which were generally hafted, and from
Tasmania, which were not.
The subdivision C. A., V., scrapers includes a large number
of chipped-edged implements, which do not come under the
headings of axes or knives; but which, in their limits,
approach both of those sub-divisions. Their use is undoubtedly
for scraping wooden implements, skins, etc. The sub-division C.
A., VI., spearheads, forms to sections a. single flake and h. multiple
flake. The Section C. A., VI., a. is subdivided into three classes
—l. chipped, 2. flaked and 3. serrated. Classes 1. and 2. resemble
one another; but are sufficiently distinct to justify their
separation. Class 3. comprises the finest examples of Australian
chipping work and, in the form of glass spearheads, are well
known.
Section C. A., VI, b. multiple flake, resemble the class, C. A.,
111, a. 2. multiple flake knives ; but are set in 1, 2, 3 or 4 rows
on the spearhead.
The subdivision C. A. VII., as already mentioned, is for
purposes of classification of collections only.


The division C. 8., cutting implements with edge produced by-
grinding or polishing, includes four subdivisions : I. Axes, 11.
Wedges ; 111. Knives or Scrapers, and IV. Blanks. The last class
axes, etc., in the rough, is simply for collection classification.
As before, the nomenclature, as nearly as possible, gives the
uses of these implements as compared with European tools.
The subdivision C. B. I. axes, forms two sections : a. those
grooved for hafting, and b. those not grooved for hafting. This
separation, though convenient, is not altogether satisfactoiy, as
the title “ not grooved for hafting ” may imply that these axes
were generally hafted. As a matter of fact, it may be agieed
that the majority were never used with a haft while those hafted
were also frequently used in the hand without the haft. The
section C. B. I. a. is not further subdivided. The examples at
present available are not numerous; it will, however, probably
be found necessary to make further subdivisions here.
The section C. B. I. b. is divided into six classes: 1. oblong
ovate ; 2. ovate ; 3. deltoid ; 4. gad-shaped ; 5. adze-shaped ; and
6. cone-shaped. The classification is based generally on the
shape of the bodies. Class C. B. I. b. 1. is divided into four sub-
classes, depending upon the nature of the cutting edge.
a. straight edge; /3. circular edge ; y. parabolic cutting edge;
and 8. with the edge not in, but inclined to, the plane of the
major axis of the cross section of the body. Sub-class C. B. I. b.
1. y. occurs frequently in the Goulburn Valley, V ictoria, and C.
B. I. b. 1. 8. commonly in the Western District of Victoria j they
appear to merit separate classification. The class C. B. I. b. 1.
comprises over 80 per cent, of the examples known to the
writers and the sub-class /!., circular cutting edge, forms 90 per
cent of that class.
Class C, B. I. b. 2., ovate, is not the same as proposed by Mr,
Etheridge, 1 judging from the examples figured. His class is
included by the writers in the “oblong-ovate” C. B. I. b. 1. The
axes now included in the ovate class are distinctly ovate both in
plan and in cross section. They may possibly be referable to the
subdivision, wedges; but the absence of grooves and flattened
butt ends, and the excellence of the cutting edges place them
preferably in the subdivision “ axes.”
1 Proc. Linn. Soc., vol. vi., pt. 3,1891, p. 358.


The class C. B. I. Ik 3., deltoid, is the same as that of Mr.
Etheridge. The type examples of this class come from N.W.
Australia, examples from other parts being apparently acci-
dental, and due, probably, to shape of the pebble used.
Class C. B. I. b. 4., gad-shaped, is very distinct; it is divided
into two sub-classes, a. cylindrical, and /?. flattened body.
The examples of sub-class a. are all, as far as known, from the
Goulburn Valley, Victoria; the sub class /?. occur numerously in
Gippsland, New South Wales and Queensland.
Class C. B. I. Ik 5., adze-shaped, would appear to be doubtful,,
were it not for the very distinct specimens illustrated by Mr.
Etheridge, and for one example in the National Museum,
Melbourne. They resemble strongly South Sea implements, and
show more specialization than any others described.
Class C. B. I. b. 6., cone-shaped, is very definite, the only
examples known to the writers coming from the Goulburn
Valley, Victoria.
Subdivision C. B. 2., wedges, comprises implements of axe-
shape, and of large size. They are generally of inferior stone, and
do not have well polished cutting edges. Almost all the examples
known are grooved for hafts or holding-withies. The different
styles of grooving cause them to be divided into four sections :
a. With a single transverse groove (the common type); b. double
transverse groove (rare); c. with a longitudinal groove extending
from the transverse groove around the butt, evidently intended
for firmer attachment of the haft; and d. without a groove.
Subdivision C. B. 111., knives or scrapers, comprises the small
axe-shaped implements, often called “toy tomahawks.” Their
use is for carving and particularly for scraping and dressing skins
for rugs. Although they have distinctive variations in shape and
method of preparation, they do not occur in sufficient number
to warrant further subdivision.
The second group, grinding implements, distinguished by Gr,,
is separated into two divisions. A. Kerns or mills, for grinding
foodstuffs and pigments, and B. Grinding stones, for fashioning
and sharpening other implements.
The division Gf. A. forms six subdivisions:—l. Nether stones
with husking hole on the lower side, and a spherical hollow ; 11.
Nether stones without the husking hole, and with a spherical


hollow; 111. Nether stones without the husking hole, and having
a plane surface ; IV. Nether stones without the husking hole, and
with an oval hollow ; V. Nether stones, generally circular, and
probably used occasionally as upper stones, and also for pounding
fibre ; VI. Upper stones, divided into three sections, a. Spheroidal,
used with subdivisions I. and II.; b. Pestle-shaped, belonging to
subdivision II.; and c. Muller-shaped, belonging to subdivisions
111. and IV.
The division Gp. 8., has three subdivisions:—!. Grinding
stones for putting cutting edges on blanks and for sharpening
axes, 11. For whetting or sharpening the edge of axes in use,
and 111. Rasps for dressing hafts of spears, waddies, etc.
The group, Pounding Implements, distinguished by the letter
P. has four subdivisions; —A. Hammers of various sizes from
quarrying hammers used with two hands, down to small ones for
flaking blank axes or striking chips from nuclei. B. Chipping
hammers for secondary chipping of knives, adzes, etc. G. Poun-
ders for separation of fibre, and D. Anvil stones, the use of which
is not definitely known, but which occur in great number in some
localities. The remaining groups are sufficiently explained by
their titles.
The whole classification is set forth in the attached table.
