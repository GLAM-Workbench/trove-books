PROCESSOR CHUNK, (formerly ol ye firm of Chunk, Muggins & Flunkey,) arriveth in Australia per ye good ship
“ Nutmeg.” He admireth ye scenery “ muchly ” and calleth it “ grand !” but knoweth not whether to turn to ye right
or to ye left! Ye town of Melbourne he espieth afar off in ye distance j but ye energetic, and philosophical Chunk,
seemeth sorely perplexed as to ye “ short cut ” thereto !

Professor Chunk s first night in Me]bourne ! He putteth up at je renowned, and celebrated “ New-Chum Restau-
rant ” and intimateth to ye cook next morning-, that “ye proud owner of ye domicile, most certainly hath ye best part
of a menag-ene on ye premises! \e cook (who hath long- been in ye service of ye proud owner) thinketh that she
hath heard ye same remark before !


In perusing 1 je columns of ye newspaper next morning l , ye sharp eye of ye Professor (who seeketh employment) sud-
denly lig-hteth upon ye following-: u WANTED, a stout able-bodied MA.N, to inspect ye Yan Yean Reservior, and
clear up ye mystery of “ye lack of water therefrom (one used to ye trade preferred). Apply at ye offices of ye
Company, Swanston street, at ye hour of ONE, this day.” Whereupon ye Professor immediately changeth his carpet-
bag and umbrella, for a powerful telescope, and setteth out in good hot haste for ye said offices, at ye said time.


He arriveth at ye said offices ; and on applying for ye said situation, suffereth himself to be asked divers difficult
questions by ye Inspector of Reservoirs, who tryeth all he can to confuse ye intellectual Chunk—hut to no avail ! Ye
Professor proveth himself to be a man of no small reasoning powers, and well used to ye trade. He explaineth ye
cause s,and motions of ye tides; after which, he proceeded! to enlighten ye aforesaid Inspector, upon ye various proper-
ties of liquids, and quoteth numerous instances wherein, “ water hath been found highly advantageous to ye life of man.”
Ye Inspector at once seeth in Chunk a man of mighty talent —whereupon lie engageth him, and telleth him to “ call to-
morrow at ye hour of two ; when ye Inspecting party will be ready, and start from ye door.”


At precisely two o’clock next day, ye Inspecting-party assemble at ye door It consisteth of ye following gentlemen
of note: Professor Chunk (in command), William, alias “ Bill ye Cricket”(head cook, and assistant), Job, alias “ Fiery
Jack,” (ye warrior, and body-guard). At ye sound of ye fife, and beat of ye big drum, they sally out in great glee for
ye reservoir.


William, ye head cook and assistant, suddenly disccrneth a stiange bird on ye wing - , and immediately draweth ye
Professor’s attention thereto. But for divers reasons, ye Professor seeth it not; and accordingly pronounceth it to be
“one of ye invisible turkeys indigenous to ye hush,” and furthermore informeth ye men that, “ye whole country
aboundeth in curiosities !”


Ye Inspecting- party consult together, and choose a camping ground for ye night. After which, ye Professor directeth
Hill to kindle a fire, and put ye billy on, and ye warrior, to “ charge ye carbine, and sally out in quest of game for ve
evening s meal. Job accordingly sallieth out,and shortly returneth to ye scene, with ye inanimate body of a little
animal, long known to Bill, and ye Warrior, as ye “ring-tail possum. \e Professor however, after examinin'*- ye
animal closely, pronounces it to be “a species of four-legged bustard, so plentiful on ye vast plains of Africa -where,
(he addeth) ye bustard runneth wild, and is hunted by ye sportsman, for ye sake of ye tail, which produceth a rich oil.”


After partaking- freely of ye evening’s meal, ye learned Professor, relateth ye particulars of an incident which
happened on his way oiit to ye colony—one, wherein he sayeth that “ye good ship Nutmeg, after passing ye line was
suddenly attacked in ye night by a ferocious and extraordinary ice-berg of unusual ferocity! Ye Ice-berg (he sayeth)
fought well, but ye Captain of ye vessel, who was well skilled in ye art of warfare, soon freed ye good old “Nutmeg”
from ye enemy’s clutches; and by ye intense darkness of ye night, was enabled to give ye monster ye slip. Our escape
therefore (he addeth) was owing to ye dark night, but had it been in ye day time, we must certainly have perished !
After hearing ye story, ye Inspecting Party sally off to ye land of nod, where they remain all night.


Next morning- they {ire up betimes, and on ye march again. Ye Professor intimateth to ye men, that he'hath had a
curious, and remarkable dream during ye night, a dream, wherein lie sayeth, that he “saw a strong and intelligent looking
man, evidently a servant of ye Corporation, going to water ye streets on a rainy day! closely followed by another man
of exactly ye same stamp, evidently a servant of ye Corporation also, not going to do ye very same on a very dusty day!”
Ye Professor asketh ye men if either of them can interpret it, whereupon ye warrior suggesteth, that perchance ye dream
was occasioned by ye Professor devouring too much of ye “ four-legged bustard ” last night! But Bill, ye head cook
and assistant, sayetli “ No” and informeth them that ye remarkable dream alluded to, was “ a vision by night, and one
(he addeth) as I’ve many times seen in ye day-time, s’help me! ’


Ye sharp eye of William ye head cook and assistant, discernetb another strange object on ye horizon ! whereupon ye
Professor examined! it, and pronouneeth it to be “ one of ye. ravenous species of game, known to ye naturalist, us ye
cormorant,” and instantly called) upon Job, to u prepare for action,” in case of an attack from ye said cormorant. Ye
Professor then described) ye nature, and various habits of ye animal, and quoted) numerous instances wherein he sayeth
“ye cormorant hath been known to wax Fierce with ye traveller in ye bush, whom he hath been known to attack, bruise,
and even devour with great gusto! leaving nothing of ye unfortunate traveller in ye hush to tell ye mournful tale but
ye boots and buttons.! This (he addeth) is unpleasant tor ye traveller.


Ye Inspecting party suddenly come upon a desperate ruffian in ye very act of wasting ye Ynn Yean water ! Job ye
warrior, on perceiving ye ruffian, instantly presenteth ye carbine, and calleth upon him to “stand! ’’ Ye Professor then
ordoreth Bill ye head cook and assistant, to “ note well ye general appearance, and style of ye man” “ and mark you” (he
sayetli addressing ye ruffian) “ were it not for ye immense trouble, and ye intense heat of ye day, I would most certainly
place you in ye strong hands of Job ye warrior, and have you conveyed to ye city lock-up. As it is (lie continueth) I
must insist upon taking your name and address, for ye benefit of ye water supply, for ye offence is certainly a grave one,
and serious in ye extreme I” Ye ruffian then supplieth them with yc necessary information, after which yo inspecting
party leave him .rd sally onwards.


Ye Inspecting’ Party wax tired, and accordingly rest awhile. Professor Chunk suddenly perceiveth a small insect on
ye sleeve of his coat! He toucheth it gently on ye head with a stick, whereupon ye said little insect instantly showeth
fight. Ye Professor admireth its pugilistic propensities muchly, and calleth it “ plucky ” but ye warrior telleth him to
“ cease ye sport, inasmuch as ye animal is treacherous, and full of vice, and flourished! under ye name of bull-dog-
ant !” This ye Professor disputed!, and classifyeth ye animal under ye head of “ stingi-falia ”, which he informs ye
warrior meaneth “ harmless !”


Ye Professor (much to ye delight of ye two men) discovereth that he was mistaken as to ye classification of ye said
insect, and accordingly changeth ye classification thereof, to ‘‘ stingi-tailia,” or “ venemous.” He examineth another of
ye same species, at a much greater distance; and informeth ye men that ye aforesaid little insect 11 very much resembles
—and in fact, is closely related to ye Alligator; though, (he addeth) it is not so large. Were it so large (he continueth)
it might certainly he considered as dangerous in ye extreme, and capable of committing great havoc and destruction,
among ye young corn, or wheat.” For fear that it should by any means attain ye immense size of ye Alligator, he sud-
denly checketh ye growth thereof, by placing ye heel of his boot thereon !


Job, ye Warrior and body-guard, suddenly draweth ye Professor’s attention to ye unexpected presence of/what Bill,
termeth, “ a Kangaroo.” Ye Professor showeth great signs of fear, and waxeth faint at ye sight! and instantly calleth
upon Job to ‘‘charge ye carbine heavily, and watch ye animal’s movements closely.” He then informeth ye men, that
“ye whole company’s lives are certainly in great danger, for ye mysterious stranger turneth out to be one of ye fierce
gentlemen of ye woods, known as ye Aborigine—and one (he addetb) possessing great muscular strength, and a fierce
and warlike disposition !” Presently ye wild gentleman of ye Woods espieth ye party, and immediately boundeth away
in great haste over ye fields, much to ye relief of ye Professor, who telleth Job, that “Ye fierce Aborigine of the woods
is most undoubtedly a descendant of ye far-famed Spring-heel Jack; though (he addeth) it is not generally known.”


William, ye head cook and assistant, taketh it into his head to show ye Professor various feats of skill, and accordingly
pertbrmeth, in a neat style, ye “ hand-spring-.” Ye Professor seemeth greatly amused thereat, and telleth him that
were he to display the same or similar movements on ye approach of any wild animal, intending to commit a breach of
ye peace, it would most certainly have ye effect of frightening ye aforesaid wild animal to such a degree, that it would
immediately dee into ye woods, and die ! He, therefore, urgeth ye head cook and assistant to practice ye said move-
ments well, during ye leisure hours; so that on ye approach of danger, he may be able, at a moment’s notice, to display
ye same, or similar movements, without falling short of any of ye graceful attitudes.


Ye Inspecting party happen to meet a sturdy old farmer of ye district, bearing in his right hand—ye handle of a
bucket, to ye end of which handle is attached—ye bucket itself !Ye Professor thinketh that seeing a man bearing
a bucket in broad daylight, and coming from ye direction of ye reservoir, looketh suspicious in ye extreme. Job, ye
warrior, therefore calleth upon him to “ surrender! or ye contents of ye carbine will be set free !” Ye Professor then
inquireth of ye sturdy farmer, what he thinks he’s “ up to with ye bucket ? ” whereupon ye aforesaid sturdy farmer
informeth them that he’s “ going to milk ye cows ! ” Ye Professor, however, doubteth this statement “muchly;” but,
by ye advice of Job ye warrior, and Bill ye assistant, he determined to let ye said farmer go —and merely to mention
ye matter at head-quarters on their return.


Shortly after leaving- ye aforesaid sturdy farmer with ye bucket, ye acute eye of William, ye head cook and assistant,
suddenly discerneth something on ye horizon, which, at first sight, he taketh to be a hay-stack. Ye Professor, however,
declareth it to be—no hay-stack—but ye Yan Yean reservoir in ye distance! whereupon ye Inspecting party rejoice
much, and increase their speed tenfold.


They arrive in safety at ye reservoir. Ye Professor getteth somewhat excited on beholding ye scene, and calleth
upon ye men to “ hunt diligently for ye main pipe ! ” Job, ye warrior, suddenly discerneth it hidden under ye leaf of a
plant, and immediately draweth ye Professor’s attention thereto. Ye Professor thereupon ordereth ye warrior to
“ present ye carbine, in case of a surprise,”—but on no account to discharge ye same, till he hears ye word of command.
He then commenced! ye search vigorously, and on thrusting his arm into ye main pipe, discovered! that a full-grown
leech of ye common tribe hath taken up its abode for ye hot summer months in ye cool recesses thereof—thereby
impeding ye progress of ye water “muchly”—and hindering ye flow!


After great bodily exertion on ye part of ye Professor, who hath a powerful arm—he succeeded in dislodging ye said
tenant. And feeling assured that ye full-grown leech hath been ye cause of ye great lack of water in and around ye
suburbs of Melbourne, for some time past—he determined upon bringing ye said leech down to ye City, and showing
it to ye Inspector. He therefore prevailed upon Bill, ye head cook and assistant, to place ye said reptile in good
security—whereupon ye faithful assistant lodged it in ye billy. Ye Inspecting party then sally homewards again in
great glee!


After two days good marching through ye bush again, (during which time ye Inspecting party see many curious and
interesting sights, which they had missed on ye way up, hut which were fully explained by ye Professor on ye way
down) they reach ye offices of ye water supply. Ye Professor immediately produceth ye full grown leech, and showeth
it to ye Inspector.' He then proceeded! to relate ye history of ye whole journey, how, after divers difficulties and dan-
gers, ye party had arrived at ye reservoir in safety! And how, on examining ye main pipe, they had discovered ye full grown
leech, (now produced,) embedded therein ! And how, after dislodging ye same, they had heard ye pure waters, once
more gurgle on in freedom, producing a sound on ye ear, resembling that of distant thunder on ye mount! Ye Inspector
then telleth them that he is much pleased with ye success of ye whole affair, and is glad that ye mystery is cleared up.


On ye following Tuesday, ye Professor calleth upon ye Inspector of Reservoirs for his pay, and on entering ye office,
is informed by ye Inspector, who looketh fierce, that “ye mystery is not cleared up after all,” inasmuch as he hath had
numerous complaints from ye inhabitants, since ye discoveries of ye full grown leech ! and suggesteth that “perchance
there may have been another leech left in ye main pipe.” But ye Professor sayeth “No! inasmuch as there was no
other leech in ye pipe, hut ye one we captured, and fiirthermore, (he addeth) ye main pipe would not contain more than
ye one leech comfortably! though ye reservoir (he continueth) might contain many!”


Ye Professor then informeth ye Inspector that since he hath had ye pleasure of seeing- him last, he hath held conver-
sation with divers wise men from ye East, and other districts upon ye subject, and they say, that “ye lack of water,
was not occasioned by ye leech at all—for ye How is no better ! but by ye minuteness of ye main pipe, and ye supply
men turning ye water off at ye main,—thereby stopping ye dripple, and causing great inconvenience !—Therefore,
(continueth ye Professor) advise you to have ye main pipe stretched, and to give ye supply men strict injunc-
tions, not to turn ye water off at ye main, but to let ye desired liquid flow freely on through ye surrounding districts,
so that ye confiding inhabitants may not be left in ye lurch !”


Ye Company think it advisable to try ye Professor’s scheme—which they accordingly do. Ye result being, that ye
water tloweth freely on through Melbourne, and ye surrounding suburbs, and ye numerous complaints are at an end !
Ye Inhabitants therefore, decide upon presenting ye Professor with a goodly presentation—which they accordingly do—
and ye dark mystery of “ye lack of water from ye Yan VTean reservoir ” is cleared up!
