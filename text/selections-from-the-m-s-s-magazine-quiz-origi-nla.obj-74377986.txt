? Quiz/? in its manuscript form, was inaugurated last year ;
and has appeared at three distinct times during the last
session of Chalmers Literary Association, and on each occasion
received well deserved commendation and support. Our
aim in starting this Magazine was to encourage young men,
and young women also, in writing essays and verses in which
they were af liberty to freely express their ideas and views,
and in cultivating any literary aptitude they might possess.
That there was sufficient ability to employ such means for
the mutual interchange of thought is amply proved by the
fact that each number has been larger and better than the
last.
At a meeting held in November last, it was decided that
the best of the articles should be selected and printed. The
task of selection has been a work at once difficult and delicate,
and much careful thought has been exercised to make the
publication fairly representative of the Society.
From the choice given in the following pages an idea
may be gained of the great number and wide diversity of
topics which have appeared from time to time in the pages
of the Magazine.
We come before the public with no high-sounding preten-
sions ; we do not expect to startle the world by anything
novel, nor do we profess to reach the highest degree of literary
excellence.
We only hope that the publication of these selections will
tend to keep fresh the memory of pleasant seasons of literary
labour, whilst they may also stimulate and encourage others
to attempt similar efforts in the fascinating fields of
literature.

Squire H , of L Grange, had given permission to
another lad and myself to shoot the crows in their season in
his woods, and it was in one of these annual expeditions I
fell in with my favourite.
My comrade and I had finished our morning?s work, and,
having bagged our game, were setting off homewards, when
I heard a loud and distinct ? caw ? almost at my ear. I
turned round, and there at the foot of a tree was a young
crow looking up in my face with a grave look. He was a
bright-eyed, big-headed, most intelligent looking fellow, and
showed not the least symptom of fear. After a moment?s
pause he cawed again, as if it were now his time to speak,
and I charitably understood him to say, ? Don?t go and leave
me, I beg of you ; you have brought me down out of my
nest, and there is no possibility of getting back to it; and
surely you won?t take from me one house without giving me
another.? I felt interested. I took him up and examined
him carefully. He was unhurt, as far as I could see ; and
was withal so confiding and intelligent-looking, that I resolved
to take him home and make a pet of him.
Well, he was installed in that somewhat difficult and
doubtful position forthwith, and amply fulfilled all my ex-
pectations. He was as docile and almost as clever as ajack-
daw. He soon came to know me ; and at a distance of a
quarter of a mile, would leave his perch and fly toward me.
There was a Waterhouse or reservoir at the station, where
the locomotives were supplied with water, (it was the A?
station of the D. and A. Railway), and there, upon the
wooden spout, would he sit all the day long, looking down
serenely upon the men and horses, and all the bustle of a
railway station. He never failed, however, to take advantage
of my appearance to obtain a treat he was very partial to,
namely a feast of worms. Whenever I came near, he uttered
a caw of delight, and flying towards me, would settle upon


my shoulder, and commence with the most deafening impor-
tunity, to ? caw, caw,? right into my ear, until I reached the
spot where was the expected dainty. It was a saw-pit, un-
used, and the soft ground was peculiarly rich in crow-food.
When we got there, he lighted off my shoulder, and setting
himself in a favourable position, he commenced more voci-
ferously than ever, and with wings as well as throat, to hasten
my operations. It was amusing to see his watchful air, as
the earth was turned over by the spade, and his quick detec-
tion of a victim, often before I could see it; but especially
droll was it to see him gobble it up, in a frenzy of haste,
and with a half-choked ? caw, caw,? which I interpreted as
a chuckle of satisfaction at having caught the worm before
he had time to be off.
But my favourite could forage for himself. I taught him
to hunt for worms by putting one below a stone, and getting
him to put in his bill and pull it out. The first time I did
this the worm was wholly out of sight. The crow looked up
in my face and crowed, as much as to say that he did not
understand that mode of feeding him, and that it was down
his throat?which he opened to its utmost?that the worm
should go, and not below a stone. So I made the lesson
easier, and showed a little of the tail. He apprehended at
once both lesson and tail, and dragging lorth the victim, he
despatched him as usual: and in this way he came to under-
stand the expedient, and would turn over small stones to find
worms for himself.
My favourite was getting wonderfully tame and clever,
when a sad mischance befell him. He was stolen. His fame
was in all the neighbourhood, and it brought him, as fame
sometimes will bring better animals, into trouble. Some
boys who had heard of him, determined to appropriate him,
and succeeded, I never knew how, in carrying him off. One
morning the perch was deserted. I searched everywhere,
and waited all that day in expectation of his return, but in
vain. I feared he had met a violent fate, and sorrowed like
a boy for the loss of my favourite. But about a fortnight
thereafter, one morning as I was sitting at breakfast, I
thought I heard the well-known ? caw, caw.? ? Can it be
possible ?? I said, ? that is my crow if he be alive ;? and so
saying, I rushed along the passage to the top of the stairs ;
and there to be sure he was, but ah, so altered?but the


ghost (if such a word can suit a crow) hut the ghost of his
former self. Draggled, plucked, starved to the hones, and
fluttering wearily up the steps, he no sooner saw me than
with a faint caw of recognition and delight he sunk down
with his head drooping, as if content now to die ; or perhaps
it was shame that troubled him, for really he was so miser-
able looking an object that he might well deem himself un-
fit for being seen in such decent society as he had been
accustomed to. How he had returned I could not imagine.
I took him up with tenderness, and stroked the miserable
remnant of feathers the savage young rascals had left him.
All boys, I think, are cruel,?no, not all. The scamps had
cut the feathers of the wings to the very quills, to prevent
him flying off, as I supposed he had resolutely tried to do.
I gave him something good to eat, but he took little. I
suppose his heart was too full, or his stomach too empty.
Even the saw-pit failed to rouse him. There was but a
gleam of his former vivacity, and then he relapsed into
sadness, and sleep.
It was clear ? the iron had entered.? From that time he
was a changed crow. He had got his first taste of the out-
side world, and had found it hitter?very bitter. He was
never quite what he had been. His free and easy habits in
part left him ; and he looked on all?especially on boys?
with sour suspicion. By degrees, however, he recovered
condition ; and with fat and feathers his former spirit in
some degree returned. He began to fly about, and to caw
and eat as lustily as before. He seemed to stick more to_
me also. But alas ! crows as well as men are the victims of
misfortune. Another, and more terrible calamity befell him.
He was carried off a second time. By what trick or violence
his captors succeeded 1 could never learn, but he disappeared.
I made search for him, but in vain. His captors had made
sure of him this time ; though I much fear they had to starve
him into submission. He never returned. And thus I lost
my favourite. He died a martyr to his own reputation.

The groom hath come to muster us, all in his livery drest,
And he hath pinn?d a huge rosette upon his brawny chest:
He looked upon his roadsters, and a smile was in his eye ;
He looked upon the gathering clouds with visage grim and wry ;
Right meaningly he smiled on us, as ever and anon
A whisper ran all round our line?? Pray, what?s ado with John ??
? And if this lowering sky should fall, as fall full well it may,
For never saw I promise yet of such a rainy day ;
Press where ye see my white horse shine in yonder luggage car,
And be your parasols to-day the umbrellas of De Varre,?
Oh dear I the rain is coming ; hark to the mingled din
Of winds, and trees, and coaches, and the poor squeezed souls within !
The drenching shower is pelting fast across St. Johnston?s plain,
With all the dread prognostics of a most confounded rain.
Now, by the silks of those we love, fair gentlemen advance?
Charge for the umbrellas, ride madly for the nonce !
A dozen spurs are striking deep, a dozen hearts are prest
A dozen souls are dashing on, to gain the luggage chest;
And on they splashed, and in they rushed, till through the wat?ry war,
Like pine-tops through the tempest, rose the umbrellas of De Varre.
Now, heaven be praised! the storm is o?er, the skies have ceased to rain ;
The winds have stopped their bluster, the sun shines out again ;
The clouds are driving like the chaff before the thrashing flail ;
The roads are heaped with mire and wet, the relics of the gale.
And then we thought of flinching, and all from man to man,
? Remember last pic-nic day I? the warning whisper ran :
But out spake brave Sir Harry?? No gallant will say so ;,
On, on with every brave heart, but let the coward go 1?
Oh I was there ever such a knight, in sunshine or in shower,
As our excellent Sir Harry, the banker of Glendower ?
Ah ! lovely ladies of the dale?ah ! belles of fair Glenburn?
Weep, weep for perished pleasures?for martyred muslins mourn 1
Ho 1 groom, ride on, for charity: before the sixth bell tolls,
Bid White Hart cooks prepare a mess for twenty famished souls !
Ho I gallant gentles one and all, see that your hearts be light,
For dinnerless and hungry you must return to-night;
For the rain has soaked the mince-pie, the ham no art can save,
And the roast hares and the turkey have found a watery grave :
Then adieu to all our pleasure on this eventful day,
And adieu to blissful pio-nics for ever and for aye. W.

Taking into consideration the number of interesting places
of note and beauty, surrounding our fair city which are easily
accessible in the course of an afternoon's ramble to those who are
fond of such pastime and have the opportunity of enjoying it,
I would crave by your favour to bring them under the notice
of fellow members and any who may feel disposed to participate
in this excellent mode of healthy enjoyment, beneficial alike to
mind and body, and helping those who are of an observant
mind to study nature unadorned by men in many cases, and
there behold in mighty beauty some works of the Great Master
of the universe, taking for my first paper
? THE NEW TOWN FALLS "
and how to get there.
From the several routes leading to the track by which
these Falls are reached, and to those who are not afraid of a
little extra walking, the one along the Rivulet's course at
interception of the New Town Road, is the most picturesque
and poetical, so in order that the grand view which one sees
when returning by the Augusta Road may not be marred by
nightfall, it would be advisable to drive as far as the Show
Ground by 'bus or otherwise. Here you strike the track along
the banks of this quiet rivulet, in itself very romantic, and
made more so by several ancient looking homesteads which
are built on its banks, and those ruins of the ? Old Mill "
with its now dilapidated waterwheel, known so well through
the medium of the camera. Passing on you strike the main
road and follow its track past the Lady Franklin Museum, a
landmark of the ? Wilderness," which reminds me of another
now demolished landmark full of tradition, ?? The Hanging
Tree," from whose heights sensationalists used to aver that
in early days the aborigines were hanged. The square
piece of quartering that projected from its trunk cer-
tainly gave it the appearance of a gallows, which I afterwards


discovered from enquiries of the old resident?s relatives, had
been fastened in position for the purpose of taking the honey
from an immense swarm of bees who made it their storehouse
for the sweets of the flowers which they so industriously collect.
The ? Museum ?is a Museum only in name. The curiosities
etc. which used to adorn its interior have all been removed,
and have made way for one alligator and several daubs, which
the enthusiastic orchardist who rents the building calls ? paint-
ings,? together with the products of his garden and orchard
which surround the building.
Travelling along past some really splendid orchards, where
the rambler may purchase various fruits in season, the track is
very rugged owing to the loose rubble and stones, but you
almost forget these through the influence of the pure atmo-
sphere and the almost indescribable splendour of our noble
mountain Wellington, which appears immediately before you
with all its varying verdure and atmospheric evolutions. At
this part of the journey you have crossed to the north side of
the stream, and require shortly to change ; and a neat log bridge
has lately been erected for the convenience of one or two enter-
prising colonists who have made their homes in this scantly
known part.
Some ten minutes walk beyond this bridge brings you to a
few old ruins of a demolished hut and a fruit garden run wild,
wherein are apple, pear, gooseberry, black and red currants,
cherry and other variety of trees, which in days long gone by
had been planted by some enthusiastic settler who appears to
have been in advance of his time, and consequently not favoured
by fortune ?after passing the garden then comes the tug of war,
and a few minutes spell by the side of the rippling waters will
no doubt be acceptable; from this point it is truly uphill work,
slightly monotonous on account of the hill which you are ascend-
ing being so barren. You have a clearly defined track to guide
you, and find yourself amply rewarded when the track ends at
the foot of that immense precipice of three terraces, over whose
summit the rippling stream bounds on its course, forming a
most effective though small waterfall?a sight well to be re-
membered. I must not make my paper wearisome so bid you
adieu at the foot of the Falls, viewing with admiration one of
those grand sights which invariably holds one spell bound, and
postpone the more detailed description together with return
journey till my next.


My steps are on you once again, ye hills,
Whose sunny peaks rise in the morning sky,
Haloed with glory, like the pinnacles
Of some vast temple reared to the Most High ;
Within whose rugged walls unceasing ply ?
The elements, the thunder?s echoing fire,
The winds in storm or breeze, the mellow cry
Of summer brooks, or wintry torrents? ire,
The diapason full of Nature?s mighty choir.
No gloomy chasms, nor gorges, thunder-riven,
Your graceful forms enshroud in terror drear ;
Nor icy summits, tow?ring proud to heaven,
Enthrone sublimity on wond?ring fear ;
Though skyward swelling, yet to earth more near,
Ye keep benignant watch o?er plains below ;
Nor tempests breed, nor storm gusts, hurling sheer
From rock to rock their thunderbolts of snow ;
But peaceful grandeur reigns, and balmy breezes blow.
Glorious ye are, when morning from your breast
.Rises to greet the sun, or waning day
Comes down upon your peaks to watch the west,
Gathering his curtains round the dying ray ;
Glorious in calm, or when, in wanton play,
Ye pierce with jagged lance the thunder-cloud,
And wreathe your brows with lightnings of the fray,
And shake your torrent locks, and to the proud
And vengeful peal respond with thousand peals as loud.
When Time began, ye stood there with the stars ;
When Time is well nigh o?er, ye stand there now ;
Whole dynasties have passed, and feeble scars
Are all that Time hath graven on your brow.
The rolling centuries have witnessed how
The race of man from youth to age hath grown,
But still your giant heads ye scorn to bow ;
Amidst the wreck of years and races flown,
Ye stand ?mute monuments of all?sublime, alone.
Your high embattled ridge, from sea to sea
Stretching?a rampart reared by Heaven?s own hand?
Each mountain pass, a new Therm opylae
Of untaught freedom?where your patriot band
Have quelled each new invader of their land {


O?er walls of adamant, and hearts as firm,
No conquering foe has crossed with hostile brand ;
Low at your base hath sunk each tyrant arm ?
The Saxon?s hardy rage, high Rome?s imperial storm.
Here, Queen of Empires, thy victorious tide,
Flowing o?er a prostrate world, first found a shore ;
The thunderbolt that smote the Alpine pride
Here harmless fell, omnipotent no more.
In vain thy baffled eagles tried to soar
Over these heights of freedom ; strange dismay !
That hosts unconquer?d, arms unfoiled before,
Who Carthage smote, and o?er a world held sway,
Recoiled from rugged rocks, and tribes as rude as they.
Ye glorious hills, no more your echoes ring
To Roman shout or fierce domestic jar ;
The dove hath scal?d where droop?d the eagle?s wing,
And Peace hath tam?d where failed the might of war.
May despot hand ne?er stain, nor craven mar,
Your hallowed grandeur ; to all time still be
Stern barrier to oppression, fam?d afar
As birthplace and asylum of the free,
The Temple, Altar, Capitol of Liberty.
My native hills, mine eyes are dim with tears,
Tracing, in pensive thought, each well-known height.
Radiant with memories of earlier years,
When Love and Hope were strong in Life?s young flight;
But shadows dark have fallen, like mists that blight
Your morning beauty ; yet perchance may grow
The calm that comes with riper years?as light
Of growing day sets all your peaks aglow,
And drives afar the clouds and mists that brood below. W.


ENGLISH 111 COLONIAL PUSS.
The idea of penning a few words on this subject occurred to
me whilst listening to one of our most respected members when
speaking at the close of our President?s inaugural address.
From his cursory remarks I gleaned that his opinion was that
the Colonial Press was equal to either the English or American.
The small space at my command compels me to say very little
about the latter, so shall confine my remarks to English Journa-
lism v. Colonial. It would take a volume to trace the history
of the Colonial Press from its commencement, and besides our
country is so much older than the other that it would be unfair
to quote this as an argument in favour of the English Press.
The same almost may be said regarding the circulation and num-
ber of papers published; although I may say five daily newspapers
are sufficient to cater for the Melbourne Public, and it requires
twenty-eight daily papers to meet the wants and requirements of a
London reading public. The daily leading papers of Victoria are
the ?Argus/? ?Age,? and ?Telegraphthose of London ?Times,?
? Telegraph,? ? Standard? and ?Daily News.? At the outset lam
prepared to acknowledge that the Australasian Press runs that of
the Mother Country very close in the fight for honour. But here
may I hazard the question?does either country come up to the
high standard obtained and enjoyed by America with the ?New
York Herald? or ?Tribune?? It is fresh in the memory of
all what extraordinary feats and exploits were performed by the
correspondents of the ? New York Herald.? Let me mention a
few and hurry on. To the honour of American journalism is
it that at the expense of the ?New York Herald? Mr. H.
M. Stanley was sent to Africa in search of Dr. Livingstone ;
and with what favourable results, how, on his return that
paper and the London ? Daily Telegraph ? combined together,
chartered and fitted the ? Pandora,? a vessel that accompanied
the late Sir George Nares in his last Arctic expedition, for
the express purpose of being the first to place the details of
that eventful trip before the American and English public.
We all know, who take an interest in these matters, the
grand coup made by Mr. Bennet, the proprietor of the
?N.Y. Herald,? at the time of the opening of the Vienna
Exhibition. The special correspondents sent to report upon
that important event were, Mr. John Russell Young, Mr.
Edmund Yates, Miss Mitford, Berthold Auerbach, and Madm.
Muhlbach j the whole of the articles of these correspondents?


two in English and two in German?were transmitted by
telegraph and cable, so that the description of the various
scenes would appear in the next number, and be read on the
morning after the occurrence. The other American papers
were completely nonplussed at this extraordinary tact of Mr.
Bennet, and by the time the news reached them it had
become already stale. Much the same thing has been
done again and again by correspondents of the English Press,
notably the ? Daily News/' with Me. Aechibald Forbes at
their head, and Me. George Augusta Sala, the representative
of the ?Daily Telegraph." What hair breadth escapes they have
had on the battle held, what horses they have ridden to death, and
at last have been compelled to tramp to the nearest Telegraph
Station and have the latest news transmitted so as to reach the
head office a day or an hour in advance of their competitors.
Such deeds of adventure in search of news is hardly thought of
by the Australian Press ; but, I believe, the proprietors of the
? Argus " helped with a substantial sum of money to send
Bueke and Wills on their travels, but it did not boast of
its special correspondent. Quite recently did the Sydney
and Victorian Press send representatives to the seat of
war in Egypt, and for the purpose of advancing the
agricultural holdings in Australasia did they send a gentleman
through America. This speaks volumes for the Australasian
Press in endeavouring to keep abreast of the times, and to
improve their own land. I have before me as I write copies of
the Victorian papers, and now comes the comparison between
that Colony and the Mother Country. I find the ? Argus," the
leading paper, elegantly printed, far exceeding its compeers, pos-
sessing eight pages of sixty-four columns full of closely printed
reading matter. Against this I put forward the English
? Times " equally as well printed, but considerably larger ; and
the ? Times " has this advantage over its Colonial contemporary
on any leading topic of the day that what its leader may
discuss is received with the profoundest respect the whole
world over, and in France, Germany, Russia, or any of the
leading cities of the world it will be quoted. The ? Times"
says this or that, and it is received with some amount of
authority that may or may not lead to a sure and favour-
able verdict. The ? Age "is the next Victorian paper
of note. Its politics are radical and democratic, and it is
the paper for the working man. Its circulation is larger
than the ?Argus," and it is not so well printed, neither


does its political or social character bear so much weight
as those of its older rival. The ? Daily News,? ? Standard,?
?Telegraph,? or ?Chronicle? excel it in every way; their
articles are far and away better written, and they also have
their influence in the great political and commercial centres.
Coming to weekly papers, ? The Australasian ?is certainly
a splendid periodical, well printed, and well written, stocked
with news for every one Social news for the swell, sporting
items for the sportsman, agricultural for the farmer, sermons
and serial stories by the best English writers for the
Australian household ; and with this paper Australia has
the advantage over England or America. Yet, although,
we English do not possess a paper that contains such a
detailed account on every topic, if we are farmers or sportsmen
we boast of our ? Field ? and ? Sporting Times.? The ladies
possess the ? Queen.? The aristocrat takes his ? Truth ?or
?World.? The politician delights in his ?Saturday Review?
or ?Spectator.? The litterateur enjoys his ? Athenaeum,?and
the playgoer ?The Stage.? These, combined, could easily
beat the ?Australasian,? but,"as it is, the colonials have the
advantage. I think there is no question as to which country
produces the best illustrated papers. Place them side by
side and the ?Australian News,? ?Sketcher,? or ?Sydney
News ? seem mere scrawls as compared to the artistic sketches
of Villiers, H. C. Hall, or the late Ralph Caldecott. Again,
England is far superior in the matter of humorous journalism,
Melbourne with its ? Punch,? Sydney with its ? Bulletin,?
must not be mentioned in the same breath as the London
?Punch,? and others in its train. These show that at least
it is possible to be witty without ceasing to be refined ; whereas
some of the so-called humorous matter in the ?Punch? or
? Bulletin ? stands as rather a disgrace to the colonies. Monthly
literature, in the shape of reviews and magazines, cannot bear
comparison with that of the Old Country in the way of style,
originality, or illustration. I trust I have not ventured too
far on your valuable space ; but I cannot help thinking
that the subject properly handled?this, I know, to be full of
imperfections?should bring forth a lot of discussion, as
there are so many points I have left unsaid. There is
scope to take the whole of the periodical literature of both
countries, and pass them through the caudine forks of
debate.
GRIFFINHOOF,


ilP^
Italy has been represented under the figure of a beautiful
maiden, and the picture awakens the most pleasing thoughts.
It was in 1848 that Eome struck a blow for liberty. First
France, and then the surrounding States gained by force of arms
their freedom, and last Rome made a stand also. The people
assembled in front of the balcony in one of the public squares
and clamorously demanded reform. Their prayers met no res-
ponse from the Court of Pius IX, and on one occasion when
before the palace urging this request Rossini, who was standing
among others, answered by a derisive laugh. This greatly
incensed the crowd, when one of the citizens rushed at Rossini
and fatally stabbed him with a knife. The citizens now flew
to arms and the insurrection became general. No attempt was
made to put down the tumult, and his Holiness thinking pru-
dence the better part of valour retired in the disguise of a
coachman from the City, and was speedily followed by his
affrighted satellites. The supreme Junta convoked the con-
stituent assembly, when, after a long and serious deliberation, on
February 9, 1849, it was decreed by one hundred and thirty-
four votes against twenty that Rome should once more be a
Republic. At midnight the event was announced to the
slumbering people by the simultaneous pealing of every steeple
in the city.
The Republic was inaugurated and organised with modera-
tion-and energy. Tranquillity pervaded every department.
Before the revolution hardly a week passed without some
serious crime, but now a crime rarely occurred. A glorious
future seemed to have opened up to the delighted people; but,
alas ! Louis Napoleon had become President of France,
and Rome was doomed. A fleet and 10,000 soldiers were
despatched by him to Italy, and on the evening of the
Sabbath the bombardment of Rome commenced. For five
weeks did shells from French cannon hail in among the
inhabitants, when, at length, the devoted Republicans
within the walls, who had fought to desperation, succumbed.


The Triumvirate offered terms of capitulation, and the
invading Legions took possession of the city. Garibaldi
made his escape with a thousand troops, intending to fall
on Naples. The Pope returned, and to hold him secure a
French Army was permanently placed at his disposal. These
occupied Rome until the downfall of the despot Louis
Napoleon in 1872.
Subsequent events are well known. How Mazzini scattered
the seeds of liberty over the land, how Austria by the chances
of war was driven away, and how French battalions entered
into the Provinces and rendered some aid to the national cause.
How the man of the red shirt made a dash into Italy, ana drew
all men to his standard and then handed over a united Italy to
Victor Emanuel, the Sardinian King, and how on the advent of
the last Franco-German war when the foreign troops were with-
drawn, he, after a feeble Papal resistance, triumphantly entered
Rome and planted the National Flag on the battlements, on the
Steeples, and on the Towers of the great capitol, amidst the
joyous acclamations of the whole people?all this is matter of
history.
These were the events of but yesterday, and yet Italy is already
so changed as to be unlike her former self. A score of petty
Principalities have been welded into a solid constitution and a
governed nation, and the public sentiment is so expanded and
enlightened that old animosities and conflicting elements have
nearly died out. A national schoolroom, based largely on the
secular, is chasing away that ignorance that for centuries
darkened and corroded the mind. On the accession of Victor
Emanuel, but thirteen out of every hundred could read their own
names?now learning is all but universal. Light not only
illumines the top of the mountains but penetrates into the
recesses of the valleys below.
Removed is the censor from the Press, and books may be
circulated at pleasure. The Bible, before a sealed volume, is
open to everyone. The Legislature is free, and the Franchise,
the inalienable right of all, is by all enjoyed. Religion is
open to everyone?s choice, and thought revels unshackled.
Before the rising sun of liberty, old tyranny has flown away.
An army, the sad necessity of the time, is organised, and is
sufficiently potent to an invader from the coast. Over two
hundred thousand bayonets bristle on the ramparts of the new
born state.


And yet resuscitated Italy has not attained to perfection nor
realised the full fruit of her Institutions?how indeed could she.
A people demoralised and dwarfed by ages of misrule may not
so soon wholly develope healthful and vigorous manhood. The
overturning of a Dynasty may be the achievement of an hour ;
but to change men's habits of life, to drag them up from the
grovelling, and animate them with lofty ideas and principles
can be accomplished only by time. A social revolution is not
the work of a day. The Executive too has been confronted with
formidable difficulties ; the wisdom and energy that should have
been given wholly to the consolidation of the Kingdom has
been diverted by clerical reactionists ; conspiracy and open
rebellion have marked their every step. It must also be ad-
mitted that Italian soil has not been over prolific in the growth
of farseeing and disinterested Statesmen, and the mantle of
Cavour did not fall on another ; and what is a Senate even of
respectable abilities in times like these without a leader to urge
it on to high patriotic deeds. These are serious drawbacks, and
that in the face of them the country should have so far advanced,
speaks in language trumpet-tongued of the hold the new idea
has taken of the public mind.
Will the National Flag still float on the capitol? Italy's
only foe hails from the Vatican, but the paper threats of the
triple crown are impotent. The democracy will strengthen
and not contract, else what mean those demonstrations of ioy
when his majesty the King appears before the people. The
same tale is told by the ballot urn, and by the fact that two
hundred thousand new voters have been recently added to
the roll, all of whom passed the ordeal of the Educational
clauses in the Electoral Act.
What mean the disfavour and cool contempt shown to the
shattered fragments of the once ruling party ? These march in
solemn procession through the streets bearing the cleric
emblems, but the people smile, turn away their look and pass
on. These claim still to rule by more than right divine, but
alas for their claims, alas for their rule : yes, the revolutionary
spirit still infuses itself and dominates, and Italy will live.
Victor Emanuel fulfilled, and Humbert is fulfilling, with
honour the mission confided to them. A sudden transition
from a system of rigid compression to that of perfect liberty is
always attended with danger. The task of these potentates was
to prepare the way for the commonwealths Mazzini dreamt of


and laboured to realise. By and by proclaim the Republic.
Under that men will spring to the surface and rush to the
front, under whose guidance the State will be greatly
accelerated and the revolution be brought to a happy
consummation.
Rome may never re-enthrone herself ? Empress of the earth ?
?gone are the days of the Consuls, the Tribunes, and the
Pretors. The era inaugurated by the Caesars marked the
empire?s decadence ; and her glory in its full splendour may
never revive. Still Italy, like the fabled phoenix, is rising
from its ashes in a new and beautiful existence.

In a big house in London an old man did sit,
Sighing willow, tit willow, tit willow
That ? old Parliamentary hand ? was it,
Sighing willow, tit willow, tit willow.
Is it weakness of confidence, William I cried,
That your poor shattered party has flung you aside,
With a shake of his old grey head he replied
That Bill, oh ! that Bill, oh ! that Bill, oh !
He jumped to his feet, and he wagg?d his long tongue,
Oh ! willow, tit willow, tit willow,
Till through the whole house his own pains he?d rung,
Oh ! willow, tit willow, tit willow.
He faltered and said a concession he?d make,
And then put it forth to see how ?twould take.
But the members refused it and made the house shake
Singing willow, tit willow, tit willow.
Now I feel just as sure, as I?m sure that his name,
Is Will, oh ! tit Will, oh ! tit Will, oh !
That ?twas want of a Cabinet that made him exclaim
Willow, tit willow, tit willow.
Whoever may bring in a bill of his own,
If it don?t please the people he ought to be thrown
As he slips out of office he?ll probably groan,
That Bill, oh ! that Bill, oh ! that Bill, oh !

Of transient bliss and joys too quickly flown.

Lay of children?s tongues
Swell in sympathy
Along the heavenly way.
Legions glittering round
Bent on crystal ground,
Or suspended on spread wings
Hymns of glory sing.

Shining seraphim.

Or those myriads bright
Who betook their flight,

In beautous bowers enchanted.

Companions with them in their bliss
Lead them over paradise.

Those who take others to task should not be allowed to feel
that they are to go scathless. The critic at your Literary
Association is at times severe upon those attempting an expres-
sion of opinion upon subjects that they are not quite equal
to ; their manner of delivery, accent, or mode of treatment all
come in for animadversion.
The aim of such Associations should be to encourage the
timid, to inspire with confidence these who think humbly of
their own abilities, and, by all the inducement possible, to draw
out latent talent. To criticise with severity, will awe the timid,
and drive from the humble mind any germ of confidence ; and
thereby the talent that might have shone out with brilliancy
becomes altogether extinguished.
When wrong has to be confronted, no language is at times
too scathing in which to denounce it, but when my fault is the
want of early education ; when my shortcomings are from cir-
cumstances not in my control, then be ?to my faults a little
blind.'' It is not necessary to employ the elephant's foot to
crush a fly. A Hercules is not requisite to perform an
every day feat of strength ; then, why should the trained
mind, why should the logical reasoner, and the faultless
speaker, come down with all his eloquence, logic, and
training to extinguish one who, in his own sphere, may
be what the other, in the same circumstances, might never
have attained to ? Place the logician beside the tradesman,
compel him to take the tools and try his ? 'prentice hand " and
the very youth yonder begrimed with dirt, will grin and say,
? What a muff he is !'?
The conceit was once taken out of a celebrated painter who
had made a life-like picture of three pigs feeding at a trough. The
painting was exhibited in a conspicuous place ; and the painter,
prompted by vanity, sometimes stood behind the onlookers to
hear their observations. Many had been the praises uttered,


but two waifs came along, and one instantly exclaimed,
? Eh ! who ever saw three pigs feeding at a trough and one of
'em didn't have his foot in it ?" This was a criticism not
intended to wound, but how humiliating was the source.
Critics as a rule, where no principle is involved, come to the
front, as the actor does before the footlights to show his
superiority over the vulgar crowd in the circle below, and gener-
ally, if the criticism is divested of what is blatant, and mere
assumption, there is nothing to behold but the form of the
critic. I have felt when youthful critics rose in succession,
that their opponent would sink into nothingness ; and the sub-
ject of their criticisms must mentally have ejaculated, ? When
will these sparks cease to rise ?? and after the worrying left
the debating arena wondering if he were still in the flesh.
What a source of consolation in going through life, to feel
that you helped even one by encouragement and kindly feeling
to a higher rung upon the ladder, instead of gloating over the
idea of having stung him and made him feel unhappy.

I want to write a short and simple tale,
But cannot concentrate my thoughts one bit,
I knew when I commenced that I would fail.
I have no head for poetry?wait a bit !
I thought just then of something really good :
A vision of some fairies in a wood ;
A picnic party ?lovers lost and found ;
A happy wedding?how my head goes round !
No ! I?ve not got it, that is very plain.
I must commence a subject once again ;
Oh yes ! of course, I must have been a flat!
I have it now, it all comes fresh and pat:
A castle old ; a knight ; a stormy father ;
A vengeful brother?Yes ! I?ve got it rather !
He slays?let see?Who slays lOh ! what a racking
My poor head gets, for brains I must be lacking.
Let?s think ; I?ve nearly nibbled all my quill.
Aha ! I?ve got a subject ; yes, I will ?
I?ll write about the time when Jack and I
Went fishing that wet Sunday on the sly ;
But then Jack?s not yet dead, and I?m alive,
The world would say, ? Look, how the wicked thrive.?
No, that won?t do?eh ! yes of course,
I see it all, a law suit, a divorce.
But then the story?s old, and rather worn.
Oh ! never more I?ll laugh a poet to scorn.
How pleasant it must be, like Burns or Scott,
To think, sit down, and write the blessed lot
Straight off the reel without a bit of trouble.
I feel I can?t go on, my eyes see double.
My brain?s on fire, I?m ruining my sight;
I must confess I cannot poetry write. Elijeb.

Certainly not. Me. Eichaeds ? Well, yes, perhaps.
How the Chairman ? wires in ? when he begins to speak.
Our President has followed the chase. Yoicks ! Tally ho !
Me. Webstee got the brush.
Fair attendance in the large hall to hear our President on
? Eeading.? Splendid from beginning to end, and fully deserved
the hearty thanks awarded.
Me. Eae to the front again ; and, for once, could not find a
flaw.
That gentleman sticks up for the ? Australian Press/' Advance
Australia.
Who is responsible for the spelling in the syllabus ?
Me. Hutchinson well up in his subject ? Physiognomy ;?
although the time was rather brief for discussing such an im-
portant question.
He caused many hearty laughs with the grotesque illustrations.
By the way, who was the artist? Somebody whispered, Me.
Haydon, late of the Y.M.C.A.
It is particularly edifying to hear Me. Eichaeds say, ?I
leave that for the youngsters." Please Me. Editoe, who are
they ?
?Federation.? Fair attendance. Me. Eichaeds led off in
the affirmative. Our Chairman came prepared, fully equipped
for argument, with the report of the late Federal Council
before him.
Our President gave a capital speech, as usual.
Me.-Claeke gave his first speech, and one well to the point.
Note some of the Parliamentary language used. One of our
visitors called it ? an affair,? and the Secretary spoke of the
colonies as being ?on their own hook.?
Capital attendance of visitors and members to hear Messes.
Eae and McMeekan address their constituents.
Me. McMeekan wandered a little in his opening remarks,
but later in the evening kept to the different points well.
Me. Eae received a signed requisition?who from ?
Me. Kenneth Muneo made rather a rambling speech.


Oil ! Me. Richards, you should not say nasty things about
the Catholics.
By the way, who was the visitor who stated that the Catholic
Church was a power in the world ?should like to have heard a
little more from him.
Me. Neal wanted opinions on a good many subjects. We
trust he was fully satisfied with the replies ?
Both members independent. Me. Eae a little more than
Me. McMeekan. Hardly fair though, criticising each other.
Votes in favour of Mr. McMeekan, Why wasn't there a
poll ?
Impromptu. Fair attendance of members. Me, Webster in
the chair.
Me. Richards sailing under false colours re Local Option
Briefest speech of the season made by Me, Wooley, u On
what country has produced the most poets : I think England,"
(Loud applause.)
Mr. Eae is a believer in mesmerism. Hope he won't put any
of us under his influence.
Who asked the question, ? What is the best way to choose a
wife ?"
Me. Richards on ? Home Rule."
A large attendance of visitors, and a good proportion of
Irishmen present.
Me. Richards, in his review of Irish History, quoted
? St. Patrick was a good old fellow." Allow me to state
for your edification, sir, ? St. Patrick was a gentleman."
Me. Neal made a neat speech, although he was speaking
against his views.
What was the matter with the Editor that he could not be
prevailed upon to speak ?
Me. Potter did not believe in Home Rule for Ireland ; a little
later he did. What contradiction.
First number of ? Quiz " met with a hearty reception,
and took the members by surprise. It contained some
capital articles both in prose and verse.
Our worthy Vice-President has heard some famous preachers
in his time. Lucky being, no wonder he has imbibed the
flowery art of oratory.


Glad to see the Key, Casley present.
The Editor drew a good audience in the large hall to hear his
paper on ? Tom Hood/' It was well done, and quite
deserved all the thanks he got.
Somebody whispered his fee was <�*s ss. for advertising.
Was it so ? I think not.
The extracts for reading and recital were well selected, and
fairly given by Messes. Neal, Shann, and Cockhead.
By the way, Me. Rae, who generally has a bone of contention,
distinctly stated the ?Parental Ode? was the best. Our
Rev. Vice-President said ? The Song of the Shirt.? Which is
right ?
?Is it probable that English will ever become a universal
language ?? Ask Me. Caemichael. If you do not obtain
a satisfactory reply, enquire of the Rev. F, Shann.
What did you think of the Parliamentary Debate on Woman's
Suffrage ? In the absence of the Secretary our Editor led off at
a moment's notice.
Me. Muneoe made a characteristic speech, and quoted Mark
Twain to substantiate his argument. ? Innocents at Home,?
forgive him.
Our President had a pill in store for the Opposition ; they
gave a feeble gasp, and quietly died.
We have had two evenings devoted to ? Readings and Recita-
tions on each occasion we have had the same gentlemen.
Please Mr. Secretary give us a change. We like to hear Messes.
Cockhead, Longmoee, Shann, and Neal, but too much Neal,
Shann, Longmoee, and Cockhead is apt to get monotonous.
Capital random debate on Billiards and Smoking.
Who was it remarked that no benefits can be derived from
Billiards and Chess ? Go to !
Our President said little on the subject ?Should Billiards
and Smoking Rooms be introduced into Y.M.C.A, Rooms.?
We know the reason why now.
Me. Muedoch introduced the subject ? Some customs of the
Aborigines,? in a paper well put together.
Our President would have us believe that superstition is
religion?is it ? Opinions differ.


Our Conversazione passed off well under the circumstances
Mr. Haywood provided heaps of good things, and to judge by
the quantity stowed away ?pardon the slang Me. Longmoee?
they must have suited everyone's palate.
Did anyone understand Me. Shann?s Recitation ? Not being
familiar with the Lancashire dialect, I didn't.
The views and pictures were admirably arranged, and reflected
much credit on Messes. Raton?s and McMeekan's taste.
Our Chairman on ? Manliness." Very good.
We are glad to hear of some members going to reform.
Frst convert, Me. Kenneth Munro.
Our Secretary was quite correct, too many quotations by half.
Advice from our Chairman to those who would be manly,
? Keep a good look out for the ladies."
Our Me. Richards had a ? Roland" for Me. Longmoee?s
� Oliver." It was an acute repartee, although without animus
on either side.
The second number of ? Quiz" was literally hailed with
delight.
What puzzles the members is, who is the author of ? Pain or
Pleasure, are they real ?" It created a sensation.
Owing to a very wet night our Rev. Vice-President?s lecture
did not come ofl ; but, in spite of the wind, rain, mud, and
slush several put in an appearance.
The following Thursday the lecture did come off, and a capital
audience greeted the Rev. P. Shann.
Beyond doubt it was splendidly delivered, although a little
long, and a trifle prosy. It showed good historical and literary
research, and was well worth hearing.
We noticed in the course of the lecturer's essay, the usual
supply of poetical quotations, so much so that we have caught the
little weakness ourselves, so here goes?
? He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;
Exceeding wise, fair spoken and persuading,
Lofty and sour, to them that loved him not,
But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.?
Mr. Henry Clarke said he would just say a few words.
They took him exactly eleven minutes.


? Parent of Members/? Me. Paton opened with a speech
in which he endeavoured to show the advantages of paying
our members. He stuck like a ?brick? that he is to the
old worn-out arguments.
Mr. Clarke replied, and we expected great things ; but were
doomed to disappointment. He got his notes somewhat mixed :
this doubtless accounts for his rambling all round the subject.
Beyond doubt Mr. Richard?s speech was the best of the
evening. He kept to the subjects, and his arguments were
sound.
The Municipal election was decidedly good, and caused much
anxiety and amusement.
Mr. Johnstone?s speech was good of its kind ; besides being
very original. We are in doubt whether it was intended to be
serious or humorous.
No doubt about Mr. Cla.rke?s.
And Me. Geimmond was undoubtedly very matter of fact.
the way, where was Mr. Batt ?
Result of the poll:?Mr. Geimmond first, the other two at
the extreme end.
Mr. Rae gave us a capital paper on ? Vivisection,? and, next
to the Rev. F. Shann, one of the best of the session.
We think the ? gush ? about the -originality and all that
might have well been left out: it almost implied that other
papers given by members were not.
The discussion that followed was very meagre.
Our Secretary differed on one point, and is not yet convinced;
however, he begins to think there is some truth in the paper
? Pain or Pleasure or, is that your joke, sir ?
?Volcanoes.? Our Secretary, finding that Mount Wellington
was not going to burst out for some considerable time, gave us
his long promised essay.
I, for one, thoroughly enjoyed it, and look forward to another
evening devoted to the science of ? Vulconology.?
We were certainly somewhat surprised at the ignorance of
most of the members on the discussion that followed. Do rea I
up a little, and come prepared to take part in the discussion.


Should Smoking and Billiards be introduced into the Y.M.C.A.
Certainly, by all means. Yes, says the Editor. Dash it, says
Mr. Baton. De. Talmage says this, and Peofessor Cook say
that, but I put the finishing touch and say most emphatically?
no.
We were delighted to see Me. Batt present. The same old
smile and the genial countenance put us into a good humour
with each other. But surely you were only joking in what
you said, because we know there is a great difference between
the Association and Chalmers Church,
We were so pleased to see one of our Vice-Presidents present
for the first time during the session. We gratify our
feelings by making a note of it so that it may be handed down
to posterity.
We fear Mr. Potter was unwell, hence the repeated groans
he emitted.
We have now arrived at the end of our session, and after the
Conversazione we shall not meet until next year. We hope that
the items set down for your amusement and pleasure, will meet
with your approval.
Come and say farewell, and have a good time in free and easy
style, for there you will not be under the eagle glance of
? LOOKER ON.?
