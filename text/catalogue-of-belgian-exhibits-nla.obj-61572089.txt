BELGIUM.
AREA, POPULATION, BOUNDARIES, GENERAL FEATURES.
The area of Belgium is 2,945,576 hectares—that is to say, about 7,271,743 acres. Notwith-
Itftlltiing the smallness of its area, its population was recorded on the 31st December, 1877, to
be 5,412,731. Making allowance for their annual increase, the number of its inhabitants may
fairly be said to exceed, to-day, the gross amount of 5,500,000. At the end of 1877 the number
of inhabitants was 476 per square mile, being the densest population in Europe. Its boundary-
line extends over a distance of 831 miles.
Belgium is bounded on the north and the north-west by Holland (268 miles) and the
North Sea (42 miles), on the east and south-east by Germany (60 miles) and the Grand
Duchy of Luxembourg (80 miles), on the south and the west by France (381 miles).
It consists of a vast plain rising gradually from the sea-shore towards the south-east and
the south, until it attains, near the borders of Germany, its highest elevation —viz., 2221 feet
above the level of the sea.
Belgium is divided into two regions, the lower of which, being watered by the River
Scheldt (Eseaut),isaflat, fertile, and essentially agricultural country; while the other, belonging
to the Maas’s (Meuse) basin, and being, to a certain extent, the continuation of the French
Ardennes, forms a tract of rugged, mountainous country, thickly timbered, and of a wonderful
mineral wealth.
From such geological features, it follows, evidently, that Belgium must be, and is indeed,
endowed with every kind of industry and manufacture; that while the inhabitants of the
borders of the Scheldt are devoted to agriculture and engaged in the numerous manufactures
to which these pursuits give rise ; the other region is chiefly given to mining, ore smelting,
and the working of metals, besides a number of other industries with which Belgium is especially
favoured in consequence of its geographical position, together with its economical resources.
But these elements of public wealth would have proved of very little avail had not the
Belgians, from the day they became once more an independent nation, been admirably ruled
by the most intelligent of kings, the late Leopold 1., so justly named “ the Wise,” and whose
royal son and successor has already done so much for the extension of Belgian trade and
industry, that he might well be called “ the Father of Industry.”
Thanks to the great improvements made during the last fifty years, especially in all means
of communication, railways, canals, rivers rendered navigable, provincial, communal, and other
highways; thanks to the standard of instruction given to all classes, in the universities, special
and industrial schools, educating engineers, manufacturers, mill managers, and intelligent and
workmen ; thanks, also, to the successive weeding-out of the Customs tariff, which has
enabled all classes of manufacturers to procure the raw materials necessary to their advanee-
lulfli! Bfife the best possible conditions of cheapness and quality, the industries of Belgium
have steadily advanced.
The value of imports and exports to and from Belgium has continually increased from the
year 1830 to the present time, except during the year 1877. Nobody will fail to remember
the commercial crisis which took place some years ago, shaking violently the prosperity of the
industrial nations all over Europe.

It is worthy of remark that during these last 25 years the increase of imports over exports
has steadily advanced, thus adding each year to the wealth and prosperity of the country.
Thirty-two canals, of which ten are wide enough to admit the passage of sea-going vessels,
traverse the different provinces in every direction.
Belgium possesses several ports, of which one, that of Antwerp, occupies a position in
the first rank after London and Liverpool. To give an idea of the importance which it has
attained, it is sufficient to quote the following figures, showing the traffic inwards and outwards
of the port in 1879: —
Inwards 4,111 coasters and foreign-going ships

COAL.
Coal is said to he the bread of all industries, and steam the soul. Amongst the coal-
producing countries Belgium stands in a very high position, being traversed in its entire
length from east to west by a wide belt of coalfields, extending actually over an area of
352,252 acres.
To-day the yearly output of coal in Belgium has reached fifteen millions of tons. The
drainage, ventilation, and raising of this enormous weight necessitate the use of 1830 steam-
engines, representing 103,000 horse-power, and give employment to 110,720 workmen.
There are at present in use in Belgium 12,650 steam-engines, representing 540,000 horse-
power ; and whereas from ten to fifteen years ago these machines consumed 3 to 3 J kilogrammes
of coal per hour per horse, now 1 kilogramme only is used, demonstrating the excellent
mechanism of these engines and the valuable improvements effected in their construction.
From the above numbers, it may be seen that, comparatively speaking, no country in the
world possesses such extensive coalfields as Belgium, which is celebrated for its immense
output. From this coal, owing to its first-rate quality, a not inconsiderable part is exported,
after supplying the wants of the whole community.
The imports of coal to Belgium are free of duty.
IRON.
Besides the abundance of coal we have alluded to, Belgium yields large quantities of other
minerals, which are extensively worked.
The total amount of iron ores raised and imported in Belgium in the latter years amounted
to 1,500,000 tons, which are returned to the market in the shape of cast, rolled, and sheet
iron and steel, to the value of upwards of £1,600,000.
OTHER ORES.
Belgium is not only rich in coal and iron ore, but large quantities of other ores, such as
blende, calamine, galena, &e., are to be found all over the country. Copper alone is rather
scarce, though it is found in some parts of the kingdom,

STONE.
As regards the production of marble, stone, slate, clay, sand, and other minerals used chiefly
for building or manufacturing purposes, Belgium ranks still amongst the most favoured
countries of the world. Thus, while limestone abounds in the neighbourhood of Tournai,
excellent freestone is quarried at Soignies, Ecaussines, Feluy, and Arquennes, and the
important quarries of Lessines and Quenast produce a green and pink porphyry, from which is
turned out the best paving-stone in the world. This stone is made use of in most of the
capitals of Europe.
It is worthy of remark that, while the above described stones are produced chiefly in the
region of the Scheldt, the several valleys of the Maas and its affluents abound in marble, slate,
millstone, &<s. _ Conspicuous amongst the marbles are the black marbles of Dinant, the blue,
pink, or red varieties of Malplaquet, Merlemont, &c., the lilac tints of Boussu-en-Fagne, and the
Oriental yellow of Fairoul.
The Belgian slates are well known in the Australian markets, and frequently serve to com-
plete the loading of ships sailing from Antwerp towards the various ports in this part of the
world. As to the Belgian marbles, there is no doubt that they are constantly shipped to Aus-
tralia through English firms, who buy them in large quantities, manufactured in the shape of
clocks, monuments, mantelpieces, and hearthstones, &c., &c. The Belgian marbles have been
highly praised and awarded first-class prizes at all international exhibitions.
The annual product of the quarries in Belgium is valued at £1,680,000. In 1877 this pro-
:?*? n w as divided amongst 1963 quarries, employing 1069 steam-engines, of an aggregate of
4802 horse-power, and 26,518 workmen.
ENGINEERING ESTABLISHMENTS.
Belgium, which largely employs steam-engines, counts numerous workshops for their
nstruetion, which rival the largest establishments in Great Britain. In these are constructed
marine steam-engines, engines to work on tramways, of all systems and of all
powers. TnS railway workshops of Belgium manufacture for Europe, and for the rest of the
world, carnages, trucks, and waggons of every description.
The mechanical engineers of Belgium undertake all sorts of work in iron, such as bridges,
sheds, markets, and enjoy a high reputation.
Belgium exports steam-engines, machinery, and ironwork to the value of 50,000,000 francs
per annum.
Iron castings of all dimensions are made in Belgium with great skill and excellent finish.
An immense variety of articles are made—such as figures, vases, cups, fountains, candelabra,
railings,_ balconies, ifee. The low price of the raw material encourages the producer not to fear
attempting the most difficult and ornate descriptions of work, and especially of those intended
for the decoration of public places and buildings. In this branch Belgium is a formidable rival
for the best workmanship amongst the countries which are its neighbours.
Machinery.
Belgium produces all lands of machinery—that required for locomotion by land or sea, as
well as that requisite in manufactories. Her exports on that score amounted, in 1877, to
57,393,000 francs, or £2,295,720. The locomotives of Seraing, Bruxelles, Liige, Couillet, Tubize,
Ac., are to be found on all the railways of Europe. The manufactories of railway material, the
Compagnie Beige (Evrard), at Bruxelles, the Societe de la Dyle, at Louvain, the Metallurgical
and Coal Societe of Nivelles, furnish first, second, and third class carriages, sleeping carriages,

and other waggons {or home use and export to foreign countries. The engineers of Gand,
Tirlemont, Li&ge, Charleroi, Bruxelles, &c., also construct for home consumption and export
the most perfect machinery, suited to all kinds of manufactures.
FIREARMS.
The town of Lisge is the centre of the manufacture of firearms. All gun-barrels made in
Lidge are tested under the supervision of the Government, and are greatly sought after;
revolvers, made by machinery, vary in price from five to one hundred francs; her shot
guns, of all kinds and make, are in great demand in foreign markets, and bear an excellent
reputation.
In 1877, 685,392 guns and pistols of every description were tested by the ‘ ‘ Banc d’dpreuve”
of Lidge, in addition to 341,100 revolvers; while for St. Etienne'(France) and Birmingham
(England) those numbers were respectively 71,483 and 189_,277; showing, criticism,
how much more important is the Belgian production of the kind than those of France and
even England. In that same year the value of their export amounted to 11,233,000 francs,
or £449,320. .
The reasons why Belgian-made firearms have always met with favour are easily explained.
First, the control exercised by the Government, and the penalty decreed against the gunsmiths
whose weapons burst while' being tested, and by which they lose the price of their labour,
act to keep up the standard. Secondly, the intelligence and skill of the 30,000 workmen
of Lisge, who have carried the principle of division of labour to its utmost limits, every
one working in their own dwellings, and so perpetuating in each family the best traditions of
the trade, are developed to the greatest excellence.
However, should it be proved that other countries produce as good an article as Belgium
does, nobody will contest that any is able to produce under the same conditions of cheapness,
when we see large quantities of Belgian weapons imported into the English market, and com-
peting most advantageously upon the French market, notwithstanding the heavy duties they are
subjected to. It it was necessary to say so, the skilfulness of the Belgians is still better illus-
trated by the fact that foreign governments who have recently started manufactories of firearms
to supply their own wants, have entrusted the direction of their establishments to Belgian
workmen.
MANUFACTURE OF IRON.
The manufacture of iron, in its various industries, employs now oyer 40,000 workmen, and
the total value of their productions amounts to 270,000,000 francs—viz., £10,800,000.
The iron and steel manufactories of Seraing, Angleur, La Providence in Marohienne,
Couillet, Chatelineau, Charleroi, &c., export rails, bar-iron, steel, &c., from their works to all
parts of the globe, including Australia.
This is, perhaps, the place to say that a noticeable quantity of Belgian-worked iron has for
many years found its way to this country, but being transhipped in English ports, has, in some
respects, lost the character of its national origin.
Forged nails, wire nails, metallic wires of every gauge and description, are also articles of
an extensive commerce.
The manufacture of holloware (varnished, enamelled), pots, cooking utensils of all descrip-
tions, employs a number of skilled workmen.
The manufacture of steel (principally Bessemer) has also become an important branch of
Belgian industry.
In 1876 there were employed in the iron works 604 steam-engines, of an aggregate horse-
power of 17,211 horses, and, in addition, 13,008 workmen.
The production of iron has been on the decrease since 1872, partly owing to the commercial
crisis, but mostly to the substitution of steel, the production of which has been increasing
rapidly.
ZINC.
One-third of the total production of zinc of the world is raised in Belgium, which shows
the importance of this industry. The mines of Bleyberg are notoriously known as the richest
in Europe, while the mills of “La Vieille ” and of “ La Nouvelle Montague” are renowned for
the superior quality of the products which they turn out.

The number of workmen employed in the zinc mills in 1877 was 2921.
The zinc imported into Australia is almost exclusively the product of Belgian zinc works.
OTHER METALS.
Copper and Lead.
Tfee of copper and lead, though considerable in itself, appears to be small when
compared to that of iron and zinc.
There were in 1876 five copper works and six lead mills, whose joint productions ran as
follow: —
Ist.—Copper, 2592 tons, worth £216,900.
2nd. —Lead, 7375 tons, worth £155,550.
Most of the copper manufactured in Belgium is worked from foreign ore, while the lead is
mostly the product of the country.
It is in the form of sheet and pig that lead is imported into Australia, and that it is
generally exported from Belgium. England takes the greatest part of the lead produced by
Belgium. The mills of Edmond Lamal and Co., in Brussels, are justly reputed.
PHOSPHOR-BRONZE.
We must here mention a new metal —or, rather, a new alloy—found, or devised, by Messrs.
Montefiore, Levi and Co., some time ago, and which attracted such a large share of the
attention of the scientific review's in England and in the United States. By what process
phosphor-bronze is obtained is the secret of the inventors; but we might briefly state its
wonderful properties.
Phosphor-bronze is harder than common bronze, and its power of resistance is greater;
and when subject to extraordinary pressure or tension, it tears, but does not burst, like steel
may do. When worn by its various applications it can be re-melted, which is not possible
with steel. Its merit was acknowledged at the Exhibitions of Paris and Vienna, and its quality
pronounced superior to any other metal for wear and tear. It is in the manufacture of guns,
t V' ean P s ’ tubes or pipes, nails, wire and wire cables for mines, grindery, valve-pins, and pens,
that phosphor-bronze finds its most useful application. One of the largest railway companies
in Belgium has its chains made of phosphor-bronze, and ships’ sheeting is also made of the
same metal with great success.
GLASS MANUFACTURE.
gr§&t abundance of fuel obtainable under the best possible conditions of cheapness,
with quantities of the best sand, manganese, baryte, &c., most liberally providing the raw
materials, it is not surprising to see Belgium almost unrivalled in the production of glassware.
Crystal works, plate-glass works, and chiefly window-glass factories, are very numerous, and
renowned for their importance and the quality of their products. These industries are culti-
vated in the neighbourhood of LiCge, Namur, Mens, but their very centre is the Charleroi
district. The crystal works turn out crystals and semi-crystal, plain, cut, engraved, coloured,
and fancy patterns, which can compete with similar products of French manufacture for beauty,
purity, and finish, and offer, besides, conditions of cheapness that Prance cannot afford.
The plate-glass factories are yearly growing in renown and importance. For years the cele-
brated manufactures of Saint Gobain stood almost unrivalled; but the numerous improvements
effected in the Belgian works of the kind have enabled the production of highly-finished articles
cheaper than elsewhere. The immense sheet of plate-glass exhibited in the Belgian Court
illustrates fairly the growth of this industry,.being the largest ever manufactured.
As for window-glass, Australia has known it for years. In this special branch no country
ever equalled Belgium, and notwithstanding their efforts, Germany and France never succeeded
in shaking its success.
More than three-quarters of the total production of glass in Belgium is exported to England,
America, and all parts of Europe.

CERAMIC-WARE
Like glassware, the ceramic industry is closely connected with art. Its products destined
for the service of the table, or for decorative purposes, may be divided into four distinct
categories.
Teeea-Cotta.
Terra-cotta is made almost everywhere in Belgium. It is manufactured at Tirlemont and
Louvain, where ordinary pottery, much sought after throughout the country, is produced; Marche
and Ciney, in Luxembourg, Poperinghe and Dixmude, in Flanders, also devote themselves to
this manufacture.
Stonewaee.
Fine and coloured stoneware comes from St. Vaast and some other localities inHainaut, as
well as stoneware for various building purposes. These products have acquired a just renown.
Ceookeevwaee.
_ Crockeryware-makers offer their products at prices remarkably low. Plaster-clay fit for
this ware is found in Hainaut, at Tournai, Baudour, &c,
Poeceeain.
Tournai produces a “ pate tendre” (fine ehinaware), which is only made in that city, at St.
Arnaud, and at the French national manufactory in Sfevres, near Paris.
Hard porcelain is made over a more extended area. Factories exist at Baudour, St. Yaast,
Brussels, Hal, St. Servais, and Andenne.
This last-mentioned locality has'become the centre of a special manufacture of great interest
with reference to the future commercial relations between Belgium and Australia. We allude
to the fireclay-ware manufacture. This will replace east-iron in the production of gas, stone
for crucibles in foundries, wood for the various apparatus employed in evaporation. Some
manufacturers of this ware also exist at Tilleur, Huy, and Baudour.
To sum up—ln 1877, 426 establishments, with a staff of 37,019 workmen, 1296 steam-
engines of an aggregate of 36,149 horse-power, and 133 hydraulic motors with a power of
2318 horses, manufactured products worth about nine millions sterling.
Here ends the enumeration of the most important mineral industries of Belgium, whose
productive power may be understood from the above figures.
Belgian goods do not claim too much consideration for beauty of appearance, though on
that score also they can sustain comparison with English, French, and German products. But
their special title to attention are solidity, durability, quality of materials, and, above all,
cheapness, with which no other industrial country can contend.
In exhibiting at Melbourne, Belgian industry has been guided by a practical view—that of
opening with Australia commercial relations equally profitable to both parties.
A general idea of the importance of the mineral industries in Belgium may be obtained
from the number of hands employed, as shown in the following table:—
WOOL,
The wool industry is numbered amongst the oldest of the country. At an early period Venders
was renowned all over Europe as a centre for the production of woollens, and the competition
to obtain the goods turned out in its factories is recorded as having always been great. To-day
Venders and its neighbourhood is still the principal centre of the trade. The spinning of wool,
and the manufacture of cloth and fancy stuffs, have had, it is true, much to suffer, in common


with the other industries o£ Europe, from the crisis which has affected all countries ; but the
excellent conditions under which the manufacturing process takes place, the energetic activity
of the population, and the persevering efforts which have been made to surmount these obstacles,
have enabled the Belgian woollen interest to pass through these latter years without sustaining
any very severe injury.
Had Venders for a moment relaxed from its well-known accuracy, had its scientific men
ceased searching daily for new improvements in the mechanical appliances connected with
woollen industry, its reputation would, no doubt, have sunk before the never-ceasing efforts
of England, France, and Germany to hold the first position in that important branch of trade
and industry. Happily, the “ Vervietois” manufacturers have understood the situation, and
instead of relying on their universal reputation, have especially aimed at deserving it, by intro-
ducing the most perfect machinery and processes. Above all, the purity of the water used in
washing the wool has contributed to their success; and the construction of that gigantic
waterwork, known as the “Barrage de la Gileppe,” which supplies daily the Venders factories
with 71,000,000 cubic feet of the purest water, has rendered their dyeing processes unrivalled.
The annual production of the woollen manufactures of the district of Verviers is 400,000
pieces of all descriptions of tissues, of which 200,000 pieces are worked up in the interior of the
country. The rest is exported to every country in the world.
The manufactories in Verviers scarcely make any use of the wools of the country, and
supply themselves from Russia, Scandinavia, Germany, England, the United States, the State
of La Plata, Chili, and Australia. The principal supplies come through London, for want of
direct communication. It has been proposed to create at Antwerp a market for Australian
wool. This port is better adapted than any other to become the entrepot of these wools
upon the Continent of Europe. Being in close propinquity with the woollen-producing centres,
Antwerp offers, besides, one of the largest and surest harbours in the world. Some attempts
have been made, and have been crowned with success, and there is no doubt that the importa-
tion of wool to Antwerp will be largely extended.
The import of wool amounts, according to the latest statistics, to 46,511t0n5.
The industry of wool-combing and of spinning the dressed wool, which is of comparatively
recent introduction, is rapidly developing itself in Belgium. Woollen yarns, carded, are used
both for cloth-making and for the manufacture of lighter materials. The production of them
is large, and the increase in exportation proves that this branch of woollen industry is quite
capable of holding its own in Belgium, notwithstanding the formidable competition of
England.
While Verviers and the surrounding villages are celebrated for their carded woollen fabrics,
their cloths, tweeds, &c., Brussels and Loth are justly renowned for the working-up of merinos,
cashmeres, and dress goods; Malines and Brussels are in high repute for their blankets, friezes,
and flannels; and the tartan shawls of Saint Nicholas, of which the Belgian Court shows
some beautiful samples, are greatly sought after.
In 1877 the export of woollen yarn amounted to £1,516,140, and of woollens to £448,560.
The artificial wool industry is equally well represented in Belgium. Shapeless rags of a
hundred qualities, of all textures, and of most various colours, are employed as the raw material
for the manufacture of knitted vests, flannels, Thibets, Mingos, Ac.
Tapestey.
Wool is used in a multitude of other ways; amongst others, in carpet-making. The high
quality of the Flemish carpets was celebrated in the middle ages; this kind has been again
brought back into an honourable position, and the new tapestries, called those of Ingelmunster,
are highly appreciated. . . , , „- , ~ ,
An important establishment in Tournai makes, in addition to large carpets called knotted,
“ Savonnerie” carpets, and imitation of Smyrna and Aubusson, Brussels carpets, rich, and
of other qualities. . . . . .
Weaving carpets of cow’s-hair and goat’s-hair has given rise to an active trade in a certain
number of establishments in Brussels, Toumai, Berchem, and Merxem.
LINEN.
Amongst the plants which serve as raw material in industry, flax occupies the first rank.
Belgium produces flax of remarkable beauty, that of Courtrai enjoying a renown which is
universal; while that of Ghent, Bruges, and the species known as the Walloon, enjoys a well-
merited favour. Sixty thousand hectares are actually devoted to this description of crops,
and all countries are, for spinning and for the best and finest threads, tributary to the flax of
Belgium. France and England, especially, purchase the fibre in large quantities.
The Belgian specimens of flax and tow are at the head of those of all_ other nations. The
regularity, the flexibility, and the strength of their threads, justify the high reputation which
they enjoy abroad. Italy and Spain take indiscriminately all numbers and all qualities of our


threads. Germany, Austria, and France purchase principally the higher qualities for warps,
for weaving, and for spinning. To England are sent almost exclusively the heavy numbers
of flax and tow, while from the same country Belgium procures fine thread for warps and for
woof. Notwithstanding the crisis, Belgium has still about 300,000 spindles at work.
Jute-spinning does not occupy more than 10,000 spindles, and hemp is very rarely spun.
Spinning has its principal seat at Alost. Thanks to that progress realised by the manu-
facturers, they have no longer anything to dread from French and English competition, and
the large amount of their exports proves that they compete very advantageously in foreign
markets. In general, the Belgian manufacturers themselves carry out all the processes of
dyeing and bleaching the raw material, although this practice is rare in France.
The application of flaxen thread to use in the sewing-machine at first presented great
difficulties, but they are, however, now completely overcome. Flaxen thread can now be used
as readily in the sewing-machine as Scotch thread, and is greatly superior to it in strength.
Making linen by hand is a very ancient trade in Belgium. For a time threatened by the
application of machinery to linen-cloth weaving, this trade was not long in itself adopting
the powerful aids to production offered by machinery; and by so doing, and through the really
marvellous and quite exceptional skill of our weavers—who form a much more important class
in Belgium than in any other country—we have gained a brilliant position, rivalling that of
France or of England. Each of these three countries, which stand at the head of the linen
trade, respectively produces linen of a very different kind.
Whilst France is celebrated for the strong and heavy linens, known as cretonnes, England
applies herself especially to making light and showy linens. Belgian linen goods hold a
middle rank between those of the above countries; they are not so strongas those of Normandy,
nor so light as those of Ireland.
If, in regard to blue and unbleached linen, Belgium has to submit to keen competition in
foreign markets, there is no country, not even excepting France or England, to which she docs
not export her long cloths for bed-linen. In this branch of the trade she is without a rival.
The manufacture of blue and unbleached linen occupies an important place in the linen
industry of the country.
The fabrication of ticking for furniture and mattresses has attained a great development;
and since the use of ticking for mattresses has become general, the production has consider-
ably increased. France, England, and Europe in general, buy largely of the Belgian product,
and the same is the case with South America, notwithstanding the competition of other-
nations, and especially of England, which, after several unsuccessful attempts, has given the
matter up. In damask linen—an industry eminently artistic—Belgium and France occupy
the first rank.
The manufacture of tickings of flax, and of mixed flax and cotton, is very important in
Belgium; and it is this which is most largely exported to the South American seas. There is
no country between the Gulf of Mexico and the Straits of Magellan which does not consume
Belgian ticking ; these markets belonging almost exclusively to her. The neighbourhood of
Courtrai is the seat of this industry, which does not count less than 5000 looms devoted to
weaving linen. Too often Belgian ticking is sold in foreign markets as English manufacture.
LACE-MAKING.
Lace-making has always been held in honour in Belgium. Ever since the eighteenth
century lacc has been one of the principal articles of exportation. Belgian lace is divided into
two categories—
“ Classical” lace, comprising the Valenciennes of Flanders, the Brussels point, the black
lace of Grammont, Malines lace, fancy lace, which receives numberless appellations, but is
almost all derived from the Guipure, and is known under the names of Duchesse lace, point
Genois, point de Plandre, &c.
The lace called Valenciennes is the most widely known. It comprehends three distinct
kinds Ypres lace, which is the finest and the most elegant; that of Courtrai, which is in
more general use in consequence of its price, which is lower ; and Bruges lace, which is the most
common.
Brussels has preserved up to the present day its ancient reputation of lace-making. Its
products include “ application” and “ point, de gaze.” “ Application” is formed by flowers
made by the bobbin or the needle, which is sewn upon machine-made tulle.. “ Point de gaze”
is entirely worked by the needle, both the network and the design. It is the most elegant of
laees, and is sold at a much lower price than the point which it very much
resembles in its manufacture.
Several descriptions of embroidery are made in Belgium, notably at Antwerp, Pierre,
Sweveghem, Bellem, Callao, and Audenarde. Bruges, Peer, and Ghent have the speciality
for gold and silk embroidery, for sacerdotal vestments and banners, trimmings, Ac.
The manufacture of gold and silver lace is a new industry in Belgium, but it is being
rapidly developed.


COTTON GOODS.
The cotton trade is not old in Belgium. It only dates from the commencement of the
century. To-day there are made up about 4,593,044 kilos of raw cotton, worth 10,104,697
francs. In the first rank must he placed the establishments at Ghent, where are manufactured
calicoes, unbleached tissues, cotton velvets, cotton stuffs, single and double cotton threads,
warps, unbleached, dyed or bleached, printed and bleached tissues, &c.
Alost produces especially cotton for sewing and knitting; trowsers stuffs, made of cotton,
pure or mixed with wool, come from Courtrai, Mouscron, Tournai, Brussels, St. Nicholas,
Renaix, Eecloo, and Grammont. Termonde has made for itself a speciality in utilising the
waste products of other mills, and the manufacturing of bed-coverings, sold at a very low
price. Dimity is made at Brussels, Bruges, and Lokeren ; this last-mentioned city, as well
as Benaix, Brussels, Ghent, Termonde, Eoulers, Tirlemont, and Braine TAlleud, also produces
cottonnettes and cretonnes. Belgium is, therefore, able to supply all the most useful and
the most sought-for articles in the cotton industry. If its products have not the. reputa-
tion which is enjoyed by those of some of its competitors, it is because the manufacturers
have not learned how to pack and get up their goods. As to quality, it can be stated, to the
praise of the Belgian makers, that none of their neighbours can offer at as low a price
products of the same quality.
PAPER-MAKING
The manufacture of paper has greatly improved during the last thirty years. Belgium has
profited by the general progress. The manufacturers are now enabled to'use machinery, and
can thus undersell many other countries, especially in certain kinds that formerly could only
be made by hand, such as lithographic and drawing papers, white cardboard, visiting and
other cards, &o.
Several of our provinces contain important paper-mills. Nivelles claims the principal.
Ten machines are constantly at work making those almost endless sheets of paper for news-
paper purposes; two-thirds of their total production is exported, the other third being reserved
for home consumption. Nearly the whole of the exportation is taken by England.
Important mills have also been established at Huyssinghen, Yirginal-Samme, Rhode St.
Genese, Wavre, Gastuche, Saventhem, Noirhat, Mont St. Guibert, &e. Messrs. Godin Freres’
paper-mills, established at Huy, are the most extensive in Belgium, and are models of organisa-
tion, management, and good manufacture.
Since the great want of rags several of the paper manufacturers use straw pulp; several
factories have been started for the purpose of supplying the paper-mills. The Societe de
Naeyer, at Willebroeek (Antwerp), own important works, and supply paper-makers with a large
quantity of straw pulp. Yise also contains an important manufactory, and its productions are
yearly increasing.
Fancy papers for walls, decorations, &0., remarkable for the beauty and harmony of design,
together with extraordinary cheapness, are made in Liege and in Tur'nhout, and exported into
the most remote countries.
MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.
Thirty years ago the deficiency of Belgium in regard to the manufacture of musical
instruments was patent to all; now there are important establishments, where all kinds
of instruments are manufactured. Piano-making, especially in Brussels, Ghent, Antwerp,
and other places, has made such decided progress that Belgian pianos can compete most
favourably with those of the best makers in London and Paris. It is true to say our makers
never devoted themselves to the fabrication of those splendid and expensive' instruments,
which are costly pieces of furniture rather than pianos, but they aim at solidity, sonority,
softness of touch, and a kind of artistic simplicity, which enables them to produce good, cheap,
and tastefully-worked instruments.
The same can be said of wind and other instruments, whether of wood or brass, their
reputation being now well established. The manufactory of Ch. Mahillon, in Brussels, is
well known in Australia since his last success at the Sydney Exhibition.
PHOTOGRAPHY.
The art of photography has made rapid strides during the last few years. Formerly it was
only practised as a means of taking likenesses or portraits, but, advantageous as it may have
been, in a monetary point of view, was of little practical use. Now, however, we have no
room left to envy our neighbours, as large workshops for the reproduction of high art
pictures only have been established in Brussels, under the supervision of an efficient manager,
Mr. De Bloehouse. New processes, discovered these last few years, have entirely transformed the
character of photography in Belgium, so that it has somewhat become part of the lino arts.


CABINET AND FURNITURE MAKING.
Belgium has been celebrated in the middle ages for the manufacture of artistic furniture.
For a long period the country has abandoned these pursuits. Now, however, under the influence
of distinguished architects and sculptors, and thanks to the numerous improvements in the
mechanical appliances, Belgium has once more assumed her former position. The exports of
expensive furniture (mewhles de luxe) are growing rapidly.
The import of exotic timber affords daily new facilities and prospects, and helps greatly the
cabinet-makers in turning out beautiful pieces of furniture.
As for the ordinary goods, the strength and cheapness of these articles allow an extensive
trade to be carried on in foreign countries, as well as at home.
CUTLERY.
This industry is situated in the province of Namur, the principal centres being Namur and
Gembloux.
The articles are highly finished, and enjoy a well-merited reputation, especially for those
articles of every-day use, which are remarkable for strength and cheapness.
BRONZE AND REPOUSSE WORK.
The manufacture of art bronzes and repousse metal-work improves every day, especially
in Brussels and Antwerp. Although this industry is of recent introduction into Belgium, it
already competes with its neighbours.
WATCH-MAKING.
The manufacture of watches in its higher branches is not flourishing in Belgium, owing, no
doubt, to the country not possessing the necessary resources to make these branches of the
trade a success; but ordinary watch-making has long been permanently established.
HEATING AND LIGHTING.
The manufacture of stoves, fire-grates, cooking-ranges, &c., is in a flourishing condition,
and constantly progressing. The makers, not satisfied with embellishing their work to the
degree of constituting them “articles de luxe," have also employed science in the arrangement
of the divers parts, for the purpose of producing the maximum of heat with the least consump-
tion of fuel. Some of the workshops have become real factories, which gives to this branch of
trade a new importance.
PERFUMERY.
_ The manufacture of perfumed, fancy, and toilet soaps has rapidly advanced in Belgium;
this article is largely exported, and is to be found at the most celebrated perfumers in Paris
and London.
The common soap is almost unequalled, and certainly unsurpassed. Not even Marseilles
can either produce better soap or hand it to the trade at such low prices. The principal
manufactories are situated at Brussels and Antwerp. Their total productions are valued at
4,000,000 of francs—namely, £l6o,ooo—yearly. Perfumed oils and waters, essences, &0., are
largely manufactured.
TOYS.
Although this industry has but a small importance in Belgium, it is not quite neglected.
Workmen, paid at the piece, make toys and fancy goods in their own dwellings. These
articles are continually turned out in one place only, Spa, which is celebrated for its mineral
waters, and has now won a well-deserved reputation for its light and beautifully painted goods.
MOROCCO LEATHER.
Belgian morocco leather is generally estimated, but cannot compete with the highest class
of similar goods of London and Parisian make. As for ordinary morocco leather, and
articles of daily use, the cheapness and solidity constitute a no slight advantage in favour of
Belgium.
BRUSH-MAKING.
Brush-making is carried on in different localities, among which are Ghent, Antwerp,
Roulers, and Vilvorde. The raw materials used are chiefly drawn from various countries of
Europe and South America. The low price of production enables Belgium to undersell the
other productive countries.


HOSIERY
The principal centre of this industry is at Tonrnai and the surrounding villages. It is also
carried on in the Province of Liege and in both Flanders. Although it is not a first-class
industry, it contributes largely to the general wealth, and gives employment to a large number
of workmen. It has made great strides these last years, owing to the energy of some manu-
facturers, who have introduced considerable improvements in the machinery.
GLOVE-MAKING.
The manufacture of gloves has lately advanced in a remarkable manner. The glove
factories of Brussels can compete advantageously with the productions of France. Large
consignments are shipped to the English and American markets, where they arc held in equal
esteem to the produce of the best Parisian firms. As an illustration of the importance that this
branch of industry assumes now in Belgium, 1,500,000 dozens of gloves are yearly exported
to Great Britain, while the surrounding countries draw also from Belgian makers a considerable
part of their wants.
STAY-MAKING.
Several factories have been established at Brussels for the manufacture of stays by
machinery. The products of these establishments are remarkable for their finish and their
regularity. Instead of depending on France for our supplies, our own productions exceed the
wants of consumption, so that, owing to the good quality and cheapness, this article adds to
the list of our exports into countries of Europe and America.
The principal factory in Brussels has started secondary establishments in some parts of the
kingdom where labour is cheaper, thus affording fresh facilities to the trade.
HAT-MAKING.
This branch of industry ought to attract the attention of Australian importers and
exporters. In the manufacture of felt hats Belgium stands foremost amongst the other
nations. The judicious improvements effected in the “ Manufacture de Feutres et de Chapeaux
de Bruxelles” enable this establishment to send out its products at the lowest possible price.
The felt-pressing machine of Mr. Vimenet, a Belgian, is used abroad, and the introduction of
hat-making of rabbit-hair should develop a large trade between Belgium and Australia. Large
shipments of Belgian-made hats are yearly imported into the Indies, Havana, Chili, Peru, Braztl,
and Central America, and have also found their way to these colonies.
Still more important is the manufacture of straw plaits and hats in the provinces of
Limbourg and Liege. Nearly all the adjoining countries depend on Belgium for their supplies,
and her export in this branch extends beyond the seas.
BOOT AND SHOE MAKING.
Several firms in this trade find advantageous outlets in foreign countries and beyond the
seas, where manual labour is at a premium. This industry is carried on in all parts of the
Kingdom, some firms in Flanders turning out economical boots and shoes for exportation.
JEWELLERY.
Polishing and cutting diamonds constitutes an important branch of industry at Antwerp.
Belgium was formerly renowned for her artistic taste as regards jewellery-making, and
Brussels possesses at present a number of jewellers who are real artists, and enjoy a very high
reputation.
WOOD-WORK.
Taking into consideration the perfection arrived at in wood-working machinery, Belgium has
no room to envy other nations. The use of machinery has sensibly diminished the cost of
production, thus bringing the articles within the reach of all.
VEGETABLE OILS
The manufacture of vegetable oils exists in all parts of Belgium, but chiefly in the
provinces of Antwerp, Brabant, and in both Flanders ; Termonde, Ghent, St. Nicholas, Alost*
Bruges,Ypres, Louvain, and Nivelles being the principal centres. Notwithstanding the large
quantities of raw material grown at home, considerable supplies are drawn from abroad.
In 1878 the importation of seeds for oil-making amounted to about 180,000,000 lb., and the
exportations of oil to England in the same year to 2,800,000 lb., or thereabouts.


CHEMICAL PRODUCTS.
The manufacture of chemical products is an important industry in Belgium.
i lower of sulphur, which is so useful as a means of combating oidium in the vine, , is
manufactured largely; and the refiners of sulphur generally can compete on very advantageous
terms with those of other countries, both in the quality of their product and its price. The
various acids, which are made upon a large scale, are also produced under equally advantageous
circumstances.
Soda forms the object of an industry which daily increases in importance, and the
manufacture of it by means of ammonia, which was first started in Belgium, is spreading
among the neighbouring countries, and especially in France.
White lead, the white of zinc, and other succedanea, are prepared in Belgium under very
favourable conditions, and their properties as coatings arc perfect.
Candles.
The Belgian candles enjoy a high, a well-deserved reputation. The discovery, of various
means of extracting a mass of new materials from the tallow has given a great impulse to
candle manufacturing.
This branch of industry is in a very flourishing condition, due to the great economy
practised in the management of the principal factories, the perfection arrived at in the process
of manufacture, and the relatively low rate of working expenses. Belgium possesses some
candle factories which are numbered amongst the most important establishments of the kind
in the world. The considerable importation of Belgian candles into the Australasian colonies
is a fair illustration of their quality and cheapness.
Brussels, Antwerp, and Ghent are the principal centres of this industry.
Soap.
Perfumed, toilet, and fancy soaps have already been referred to. Hard and soft common
soaps are only produced for home consumption.
Varnishes,
There are several factories in Belgium which manufacture various kinds of varnish for
coaohbuilders, carpenters, bookbinders, &c. A number of makers have discovered new
compositions, such as for varnishing stoves, preserving metals, telegraphic wires, ships’
bottoms, &c.
Mineral Oils.
This industry is satisfactorily carried on. Belgium has several factories for the extraction
of oil from peat, bituminous sohistes, coal, &o. A portion of these products is exported to
France, Germany, and Spain.
Animal Black.
Several manufacturers occupy themselves with the production of animal black, made from
carbonised bones. The value of the exports of this article, much esteemed in foreign countries,
amount to a large sum yearly.
Glue.
Although manufacturers in this branch of trade have attained a high degree of perfection,
their products cannot profitably be exported, owing to the heavy imposts. The principal factory
is situated at Vilvorde.
Acids, Alkalies, and Salts.
The manufacture of sulphuric acid, sulphates and salts of soda, chloride of lime, &c., has
advanced so rapidly in Belgium that, taking its population into consideration, no other
country surpasses it. All the provinces have factories where chemicals are manufactured, but
the province of Namur takes the lead, the factories there being the largest and most extensive.
Dyes and Colours.
Belgium exports large quantities of white lead and zine white. Zinc white, especially, is
very largely produced. The Societe de la Yieille Montague manufactures more than one-third
of the whole quantity produced in the world. This amounts to more than two millions of kilo-
grammes.
Ultramarine blue is manufactured to perfection.
Azure and Prussian blue can compete with the products of any other country.
Chrome yellow is manufactured successfully.
The quantity of red lead manufactured is used for home consumption.


Starch.
There arc important manufactories of starch in Belgium, which send to market enormous
quantities of this product. The quality of these products is such as to compete fairly with the
best English starch, while their low price speaks forcibly in their favour.
India-kubbee.
During the last ten years the manufactures of india-rubber have advanced rapidly; it is a
material used for a variety of purposes, and one which is made to undergo wonderful transfor-
mations. It is only since the discovery of the process of vulcanisation that this industry has
made such rapid strides. In 1862 there was only one factory in Belgium; six new factories
are now in full operation, and produce goods for home consumption and exportation. The
exports are principally to France, Germany, Holland, England, Switzerland, and Italy.
SKINS AND LEATHEB.
Belgian leather enjoys a high reputation; the factories of Stavelot owe their prosperity to
the owners, who have remained faithful to the old styles of tanning, which has caused their
leather to be preferred to foreign products. Belgium exports green, most of her calf, and other
light skins, and also imports and tans a large quantity of foreign skins.
Currying,
The progress of currying has kept pace with that of tanning. This industry is also in a
nourishing condition. Manufacturing backs, for carding, is the principal branch of currying
at Lidge.
CARRIAGE-BUILDING.
Carriage-building is one of the principal industries of Brussels. The prizes gained at the
different exhibitions where our manufacturers have exhibited their carriages have sufficiently
proved that for elegance, solidity, and lightness, Brussels can compete with London and Paris,
whose productions are so justly renowned. There are in Brussels twelve important carriage
factories. The value of their exports amounts to three millions of francs. This amount
sufficiently proves that their productions are esteemed in foreign countries. Spain, France,
Italy, and Russia deal with Belgium for this article, and, notwithstanding the excessive freight,
exports hold a conspicuous place in Belgian carriage-building.
SADDLERY AND HARNESS.
The manufacture of saddlery is advancing steadily. The principal markets for these
products are Germany, Holland, Brazil, and the United States.
Harness is only manufactured for home use.
MALT INDUSTRY.
iju+uS&J; le products of which have great importance for Australia, is that of malt.
Beb'iura has to-ciay sixty malthouses, producing from 500,000 to 600,000 sacks a year. The
native production of barley and winter barley not being sufficient, the maltsters draw their
supplies from elsewhere, principally from France. They received in 1876, 455,000 cwt.
from Champagne, Picardy, and Poitiers. Much malt made from Saumur barley, which is
considered the best in France, is sold in Belgium. The northern countries —Denmark, Sweden,
and Finland —also export barley to Belgium.
DISTILLERY.
Distillation occupies an important place amongst the national industries. The principal
places at which alcohol is produced are Antwerp, Hasselt, Li£ge, Huy, and some localities in
the province of Brabant. From 1861 to 1870, 432 distilleries were in activity, of which 311
were agricultural and 128 industrial. In 1876 there were only 353, of which 256 were agricul-
tural and 97 industrial. This large diminution is far from being a sign of decadence. It
proceeds simply from an improvement in the processes and apparatus, which has centralised
this industry into fewer but much more powerful hands. The increased quantity of the
taxable material shows steady progress. From 1851 to 1860 the quantity was 3,575,927
hectolitres; from 1861 to 1870 it rose to 5,248,522 hectolitres, a figure which remained
without any sensible alteration until 1876, when the quantity reached 5,585,322 hectolitres.
The largest quantity of spirit distilled in Belgium is obtained from cereals. The distillation


The productive power of the country may be illustrated by the following table, showing the
gradual increase of its plant

of molasses, of syrups, apt! of sugar, has not attained any very considerable development.
Distillation from the juice of the beetroot has little importance, and that of fruits and
their kernels is almost nothing.
The distilleries of Belgium produce each year about 55,000,000 of litres of spirit of the
strength of 52° by the centesimal alcoholmeter. The spirit is highly appreciated abroad. The
alcohol is in demand in England, at Bordeaux, and in Spain. The spirit of wine is exported to
Australia, to India, and to Brazil, and it everywhere enjoys a good reputation. The exportation
of Geneva, which was only from 15,000 to 20,000 hectolitres of the strength of 50° in 1870, is
now from 50,000 to 60,000 hectolitres. The best foreign customer is the island of Cuba, where
the Genevas of Antwerp are the favourite liquor, and are preferred to the spirits of other
countries.
ALIMENTARY PRODUCTS.
There are in Belgium a number of establishments where are manufactured dry pastes, con-
fectionery, preserves, pickled and preserved vegetables and fish, extract of meat, &c.; but
the most important branches of this industry are sugar, chocolate, and chicory making.
Sugae.
The number of sugar manufactories is about 150, the joint productions of which amounted
in 1877-8 to some 80,000 tons of beet sugar.
As a consequence of the large production of sugar, syrup factories have been started, which
hand to consumers delicious and highly-appreciated products. Thanks to the successive
improvements introduced, these factories have grown rapidly in importance and reputation.
Chocolate.
Chocolate forms the object of an extensive trade. It is chiefly manufactured at Tournai
in Western Handers, and at Brussels. Belgian chocolate is not only consumed in Europe, but
has found its way to the Indies, and no doubt it will shortly be greatly sought after in the
Australian market.
Chicoky.
Chicory is grown all over the kingdom, but chiefly in both Flanders, which are celebrated
for the good quality of the produce, and especially for the care taken in treating the roots.
The production is so extensive as to allow, after supplying the whole community, to export
nearly 5000 tons to England, 12,000 to France, 1300 to Russia, and large quantities into other
countries. The principal manufactories are established in Antwerp, Li6ge, Hal, Ghent,
St. Croix, Dixmude, Courtrai, and Bruges.
Liquetjes.
The manufacture of sweet liqueurs, and of those known as bitters, is largely carried on in
Belgium. Bitters from several makers of Brussels are highly appreciated, and their cheap-
ness, combined with their hygienic qualities, have opened them remunerative outlets abroad.
Besides the industries rapidly sketched in these pages, there are in Belgium a number of
other industries of less importance, which contribute their share in increasing the public
wealth by the production of smaller articles of daily use, which gives employment to numerous
workmen.
AGRICULTURE.
AdMINISTKATION OF AgKICULTUBE.
The administration of agriculture belongs to the department of the Minister for the
Interior. A general committee centralises all matters appertaining to the agricultural
interests. Commissions are appointed, one the chief council (or Cornell Superieur), the others
provincial commissions.
The_ chief council is composed of two representatives chosen annually by each of the
provincial commissions, and of other members nominated by the King outside of those
commissions.

Eivers, railways, highways, canals, buildings .. 304,260 „ 4J „

The number of those nominated by the King must not exceed the half of those delegated
by the provincial commissions.
The chief council give their advice on all matters submitted to them by the Government,
discuss for the general interest, all recommendations made by the different commissions of
agriculture, and all propositions made by members or provincial commissions.
The reports of the chief council are published yearly, and amount already to 30 volumes.
The provincial commissions are composed of one member for each agricultural district, a
veterinary surgeon, and a secretary.
The agricultural districts mnmber 118, divided among the nine provinces.
The members of the provincial commissions are nominated by the King from a list of two
candidates presented for each district by the agricultural committees, or by the registered
societies for agriculture ; we can thus claim the commissions to be the direct representatives of
the different agricultural associations.
The provincial commissions occupy themselves with all that can contribute to the
advancement] and prosperity of agriculture; they make known to the Government their
iu this respect. They give to the Government the advice and information required from
them; they help in carrying out all measures decided on for encouraging and fostering the
different branches of agriculture; they send each year, before the end of February, to the
Governor of the province, a report on the state of agriculture ; this report contains the statistics
of the last harvest, and the result of the execution of the laws and regulations relating to
agriculture.
There exists in each agricultural district a committee, or a section of an agricultural
society, recognised by the Government. For the purpose of giving more importance to their
work, and also a greater degree of utility, the committees of the provinces of Anvers,
Brabant, East Flanders, Liege, Limbourg, Luxembourg, and Namur, have constituted them-
selves into provincial associations.
These societies publish a weekly paper, which is distributed among their respective members.
The various agricultural societies of the kingdom comprise about 17,000 members. There
are also a large number of private agricultural associations.
The horticultural societies are likewise numerous; they number about 50, 25 of which
form a federation sanctioned by the Government.
This federation does not interfere with the rules or independence of individual societies,
but is formed for the purpose of advancing the science of horticulture by measures, the
execution of which are of interest to all the various societies of the country. Among these
measures are comprised periodical and regular meetings of delegates, keeping a general
registry of all works done in the interest of the societies, the organisation of horticultural
congresses, and the holding of debates on all horticultural questions ; 15 volumes of records
have been published, and two congress meetings held.
Ageiculiueal Instecction.
There are in Belgium schools for agricultural instruction, a veterinary school at Cureghem,
near Brussels, an agricultural institute at Gembloux in the province of Namur, and two
P rac *'‘? a l horticulture, one at Vilvorde, and the other at Ghent.
1 here besides, an arboricultural and horticultural school established at Tournai by the
commune, with the sanction of the State, the province, and the horticultural society of the
town.
' a '' S re J to agricultural instruction stipulate that public conferences can be held
in different parts of tire country; these conferences are actually established in more than 150
places.
Although Belgium is one of the most productive countries of the world, its soil is not one
of extraordinary fertility, and it owes its wealth rather to the thrift and industry of its inha-
bitants than to the lavishness of Nature. Only about one-third of its area is composed of rich
soil.
Since 1846 about 195,000 acres of waste land have been made available for agriculture, and
such improvements have been effected that the average yield of land under wheat crops has
increased to the wonderful proportion of 19 per cent, in the same period.


The number of cattle are estimated as follows:—
Homed cattle
1,227,241
Colts and horses
289,012
Sheep..
580,833
Pigs ..
806,184
Land System.
The land is cultivated by leaseholders and freeholders, but the proportion of freehold land
is uncommonly large, being more than one-half of the total area under cultivation.
Another feature of the Belgian land system is the prevalence of small farming, and to this
may, perhaps, partly be traced the large returns of the soil.
