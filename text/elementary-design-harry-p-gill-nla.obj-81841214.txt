Fig. 9 is the portion of an Egyptian wall decoration, consisting of nine rosettes all alike. The design is
therefore composed of one rosette multiplied nine times. The rosette is the one thing , it is the unit.
Fig. 10 is a portion of an Egyptian border decoration composed of Lotus flowers and buds. A Lotus flower
and bud is the group which being repeated forms the border. They are the unit of the border - .
Fig. 11 is a portion of an Assyrian border decoration ?the unit here is a Lotus flower, bud, and two scrolls.
Fig. 12 is a portion of a Greek border decoration, the unit of which is two floral forms and two scrolls.
Figs. 13 and 14 are two tiles of the Middle Ages, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries. In Fig. 13,
a flower is the unit of the design ; in Fig. 15 a bunch of three leaves and two berries is the unit.
Compare Figs. 10, 11, and 12, and notice that the Egyptian?the most ancient ?is very severe in drawing, its
lines being either straight or very slightly curved; the Assyrian is later in date, is very similar to, but more freely
drawn than the Egyptian. It was probably executed by captive Egyptians working in Assyria. The Greek
ornament is the latest, its curves are more harmonious and beautiful than the others. These examples are typical
of all the ornament of these nations.
Repetition and Even Distribution.
What is meant by Repetition and Even distribution ? To repeat is to employ again and again the same unit.
To evenly distribute is to so repeat the unit that it shall be orderly and regular, so that the units in one part
shall not exceed the units in another portion of the design. The following exercise will assist the beginner. Take
pencil and paper. Sketch a small square. Place a+ in the centre. The unit (cross) is evenly distributed. Now
place a cross in each corner of the square. The five units are evenly distributed. Now place four more crosses
in the square so that each cross is equidistant from two of the other crosses already in the square, and the nine
units are evenly distributed, either in three rows of three each, or in two diagonal lines running across the square.
Repetition and Even Distribution are two primary laws of ornament. Savage and civilised designers have
obeyed these laws in all their good work. When man, tempted by novelty, has disobeyed them, he has created a
singular ornament, eccentric, exciting our wonder, but unsatisfying our craving for beauty and repose (i.e. order).
With hardly an exception such ornament has received the contempt of the following ages.
Figs. 15 and 15a are two examples of very depraved ornament. Fig. 15 was used in England twenty-five
years ago, printed as a vertical border on cheap linen blinds; Fig. 15a was drawn by me after much effort and
considerable suffering. Neither design would have an unit, nor is the ornament evenly distributed or repeated.
Surface Ornamentation.
The beginner having now a knowledge of the unit and its distribution may commence to decorate a surface.
First select your unit, then apply it in accordance with the laws of Repetition and Even Distribution, and
the decoration is complete. As in Fig. 8, it is not necessary that the unit should itself be beautiful. The
multiplication of even the unlovely may afford a good decoration.
Any line, any geometrical figure or conventional form, may be used as the unit which is to be distributed by
means of Plane Geometry.
Groups A, B, and C afford a few specimens of the use of the Horizontal, Vertical, and Oblique lines as surface
decoration.
Group D gives specimens of ornament obtained by combinations of the Horizontal and Vertical lines, in the
arrangement of which the Chinese are especially facile.
All combinations of Horizontal and Vertical lines look equally well if obtained by combinations of Horizontal
and Oblique lines, or if obtained entirely by oblique lines perpendicular to one another.
The Zig-zag (Group C, line 3) gave birth to the waved line. The savage first obtained his waved ornament
by cutting off the angles of the zig-zag. The waved line used back to back, touching, interlacing, touching and
crossing, make good designs.
Space does not permit of illustrating ornament obtained by circles touching, interlacing, &c.
Group E.?Geometric forms are surfaces bounded by lines. Figs. 16, 17, and 18 are arrangements of
geometric forms used for tile surfaces. The more regular the geometric unit the easier it is to repeat.
Examples are given of the equilateral triangle (Fig. 20), the square (Figs. 4, 5, 6, and 7), the rhombus, or
diamond (Fig. 21), the rectangle (Fig. 22, three examples), the hexagon (Fig. 23), the hexagon and rhombus (Fig.
24), the octagon and square (Fig. 25). The eight-pointed star (Fig. 26) is obtained by placing one square
diagonally upon another; the six-pointed star (Fig. 27) is obtained by placing one equilateral upon another.

Irregular geometric forms (Figs. 28 and 29), when used as the unit and evenly distributed, afford excellent
surface decoration.
In colouring a pattern, care must be taken not to make it appear as if in relief. Fig. 16a, 17a, 18a, are bad
decoration, because they contradict the flat surface they decorate, and make it appear raised. To walk on such
pavements would be mental pain ; at each step we should expect to be hurt. If similar decorations were painted
on a wall they would suggest so many projecting surfaces to catch the dust. Neither savage, Egyptian, Assyrian,
nor Greek art presents these errors ; it was not till the debased art of Rome that the worker, striving for novelty,
outraged art and designed such pavements.
Conventional Form.
What is Conventional form ? Broadly defined, it is any form which is neither geometric nor naturalistic.
Figs. 1, 2, 3, and in group F, the ivy leaves, daisy, and honeysuckle are naturalistic.
Figs. 4 to 8 and 16 to 29 are geometric.
Figs. 9 to 14 and 30 to 36 are conventional.
To conventionalise a natural form we must free the selected specimen from the accidents of growth which exist
in nature, and draw it as if pressed flat.
What are the accidents of growth in nature ? They are nature?s irregularities. Nature endeavoured to grow
regularly. These endeavours can easily he traced in low organisms. If an arm be broken from a star fish, nature
produces another and endeavours to make the geometric figure complete.
In higher organisms, which are more complex, nature is always endeavouring to produce regularity.
Trees on the sea shore generally lean towards the land, away from the prevailing wind, because the early bud
and leaf on the sea side have yearly been maimed or killed by the rough winds, while the buds on the land side,
more protected, have grown in peace, and the accident of the tree?s situation has resulted in its developing a
slanting growth despite nature?s effort to grow regularly.
The student may easily obtain accidents of growth. Place a pot plant that is bushy and well grown all
round in a corner where the light can only get at one side of it ; the leaves will turn from the walls towards the
light, and the growth of the whole plant will, because of the accident of its situation, become changed ; that which
was bushy and round becomes thin and leans in one direction.
Group F. ?The ivy leaves in nature have irregularities, probably caused by some accident to the bud, or by
the leaf receiving an unequal amount of sunlight, or of nourishment from the soil. Nature tried to grow both
sides evenly and failed. To use such leaves as the unit of a design, it is required to make them flat and regular,
to conventionalise them, Figs. 30 and 31. A Greek conventional ivy border is given, Fig. 32.
The irregularities of the daisv in nature are likewise accounted for, and the Geometric Plan and Elevation
in Fig. 33 are its conventional representation.
The honeysuckle grows in a whorl or ring of petals, and may be represented conventionally, Fig. 34, or, as
by Greeks, in Fig. 35.
All conventional forms were originally adapted from nature, but the amount of conventionalism in an
ornament may vary, and it does, according to the feeling of the designer.
The Greek artist in Figs. 12 and 35, shows a very deep insight into plant growth, the manner in which a
cluster of flower leaves grow on the top of a stem, and the manner in which leaves grow out of the calyx sepals
of a bud (Fig. 12), but as it is quite difficult to recognise the particular flower upon which he has based his
ornament, the name Anthemion (Gk. anthos, a flower) has been applied to them.
In Fig. 36, a piece of Moorish ornament, it is impossible to ascribe its conception to any one plant, yet it
possesses the attributes of plant growth. The Moors were ultra conventionalists ; their religion forbade their
imitating in their art anything found in nature.
Thus conventional ornament is a particularly wide class, extending from the ideal natural growth, Figs. 30,
31, 33, and 34, to Fig. 36, which includes only a suggestion of nature. It is best described as all that is neither
naturalistic nor geometric.
Why may not the decoration of a surface consist of purely natural forms ? This question is always asked by
the novice who considers it much easier to copy nature as ornament, than to find out the laws of nature, and
design his ornament in accordance with those laws. The answer is :
1. Nature is infinitely varied, no two flowers on a plant being exactly alike; to take a flower and repeat it
over a surface would be unnatural.


2. The refined tints of nature painted under the cornice of a room would be out of sight; their delicate
beauty would be wasted.
3. To reproduce nature as an ornament would require shading to denote their relief. The perfection of
relief, Figs. 16a, 17a, and 18a, is deceptive.
4. If the beauty of ornament were judged by its capacity to deceive the eye, by appearing real, the highest
ornamentist would be the man who painted the end of a room so that it appeared a natural bower.
The pleasure of such a decoration would last only as long as the deception existed.
Note : the Cyclorama is a painting , not on ornamental decoration.
5. The aim of ornament is to render the existing more pleasing. It decorates it without hiding its nature.
A wall should always appear a wall; a ceiling, a ceiling ; a floor, a floor.
6. Added to the above, the fact that the average human being craves for something more than the
utilitarian, and the necessity that decoration for the million should be cheaply and speedily applied,
and another reason is found for the use of the conventional in decoration.
The demands of the many are upon us. Previous ages speak of the unit , of its even distribution and repetition
and of conventionality. The only means to satisfy the demands is to obey the precepts and examples of our
predecessors.
It is essential that the ornamentalist should possess a knowledge of plane and solid geometry.


CHAPTER 11.
Variety in Conventionality?Ornamental Leaf Termination?Fleur de Lys?Natural Leaves and
- their Proportions?Ornamental Leaves.
In my first I showed that the craving of man for beauty resulted in his producing ornament which obeyed the
laws of Even distribution and Repetition. I showed that the unit of a design might be geometric or conventional,
but never naturalistic; and I endeavoured briefly to show that the term conventional was applied to ornament
which was only nature made orderly, as in Figs. 31, 33, and 34, as also to ornament which was so conventionalised
that its natural type was not recognisable, as Figs. 12, 35, and 36. I propose in this to touch first upon some
causes of this wide difference in Conventional design, then to speak of ornamental leaf terminations and the
variety to be obtained by ringing their changes on the same design, and, lastly, to touch upon leaf forms in nature,
drawing from them such suggestions as will permit the student, by observation of nature and practice in arrange-
ment, to become a designer of leaf forms in ornament.
Variations in the Conventional Rendering of the same Natural Form.
The vine has ever been a favourite with designers ; if, therefore, conventionalism is wide, and the vine has
been used by many masters in many ages, a selection of vine ornamentation should show many ways of rendering
it. Figs. 37 to 47 all represent the vine.
Fig. 37 is a portion of the centre stem of a vine, the skeleton of the branches of which is shown in Fig. 37a.
The Assyrian workman has done his best. Not an advanced artist, he has tried to represent in low relief carving
a vine, not as it grew in nature, but balancing it (evenly distributing it) as well as he could on the left and right of
the axial line. In the piece shown he has balanced the leaves and grapes on either side of the central stem. In
making the carving he cut down his background, leaving the five stems, the five-sided masses for leaves and the
blobs for bunches of fruit, all in low relief. (This is the first step in carving. Sink the background, leaving the
ornament en bloc , without a touch of detail.) He lias then rendered detail by scooping out the main divisions of
the leaves and notching their edges, and has suggested grapes by cutting rows of cross lines over his branches.
Fig. 38.?Hand painting around the neck of a vase by a Greek artizan. The portion to the left of the white
dotted line drawn across the background is the unit of the design, and would repeat round the neck. If the unit
is repeated there must be Even distribution. Above the waved line stem the tendrils and pairs of leaves with
tendril, are repeated, while below the stem the single leaf, tendrils, and bunch of grapes are repeated. Note that
this artizan rightly thought more of the disposition of his ornament than he did of his detail. Individual grapes
are not shown.
Fig. 39.?The Graeco-Roman (Greek working in Rome) has rendered the vine in an inlay of silver in bronze.
The stem is a simple zigzag, and, being worked on a convex surface, its angularity would not be so noticeable.
The leaves are produced by so many digs of the graver. The following problem in design should be worked :
Given Fig. 39, first decide on the unit of that figure, and then make a border consisting of five units.
Fig. 40.?The Etruscan obtains an effect with the paint brush. His tendrils are playful touches with the
brush. His fruit bunches are painted in two tints, the grapes being touched in with white. This art is akin to
that of the scene painter; it is a portion of a wall decoration, consisting of a vertical and horizontal border.
Notice that immediately the worker turns the corner, he commences Repetition.
Fig. 41.?The Arab, forbidden to imitate nature, has designed a five-lobe shape for his leaves, and, in place
of veins, has filled it with ingeniously curved lines.
Fig. 42.?The German has based his design upon waved lines placed back to back; these run across the linen,
and from them grow the vines. Note a technical expediency?the necessity of the loom?has caused him to give
his central leaf and grapes two stems, and an expediency of designing has been resorted to by filling up spaces
between his large vine leaves and fruit cluster with small conventional foliage (not vine foliage). The piece shown
is the unit of the design. If repeated above and below, and on the left and on the right of this unit, it would
afford an evenly distributed decoration for a large surface. Note that in designing for linens, brocades, wall papers,
Sfc., only the unit is prepared: the remainder is mechanically reproduced ,


Fig. 43. ?The Byzantine symbolised religious truths in his ornament. The five-lobed leaf typifies Christ and
the four evangelists. The grapes (an impossible bunch) are made to fill an equilateral triangle because that
triangle typifies the Trinity. The waved lines crossed as stems afford a shape which, when in the proportion of
Fig. 41a, was used by the Byzantine as a nimbus for the figure of Christ, and is termed the Vesica piscis (fish
shape). This is an acrostic symbol. The Greek word for fish contains the initial letters of this sentence in Greek
?? Jesus Christ, of God the Son, the Saviour.?
Fig. 44. ?Stone carving
Pig. 46. Wood carving Gothic work.
Fig. 46.?Hammered iron I
Fig. 47. ?Stone carved, imitating hammered iron /
The Gothic carver deliberately designed his leaves to fill given places. Fig 44 fills a Vesica piscis; Figs. 45
and 47 till a Quadrilateral, a Trapezium. Often he made them to fill squares, diamonds (rhombus), and circles.
The character of the carving is influenced by the material carved and the tool used. In Figs. 44 and 47 the clefts
between the lobes of the leaf are made with the drill. In Fig. 45 the divisions of the leaf and the veins are
obtained by the crisp long cut of the woodcarver?s chisel. The notches shown in the wood stem could not be
executed in the stone without great labor. Fig. 46 shows the ease with which metal can be cut into shape with
shears and beaten into bosses (knobs). These are the peculiarities of beaten work. Fig. 47 shows that the carver
worked under the influence of hammered work, so much so that he has improperly given to his stone work the
peculiar effect of beaten metal.
Note the use made by all people of the waved line as a stem from which the ornament grows.
Causes of Conventional Variety.
These samples show that the nature and beliefs of the worker, the nature of the material in which he works,
and the method of his working (whether with brush or graver, by weaving, chipping, cutting, or hammering), all
of these affect the conventional representation of the same natural form.
Ornamental Leaf Terminations.
Much elementary ornament is based upon plant growth, especially upon leafage. Some small knowledge of
Elementary Botany is an advantage to the designer. Leaves used in ornament are generally what botanists term
simple leaves, such as Ivy, Nasturtium, Chrysanthemum, Plane. Simple leaves may have an entire margin or
(a), Nasturtium, Fig. 50; or it may be cut up into lobes?lvy ( b and c) and Plane (d); or into lobes
and serrations, as Plane (�), Chrysanthemum (/, g), or Marguerite {h), Fig. 50. The point or points of a leaf are
called its terminations, and are represented (Fig. 48) either by straight (a) or curved lines (b, c, d).
Straight lived lerminatims are seldom used. They are stiff and without grace. Even in the most severe style
(the Egyptian, Fig. 10) all but the outside lines would be slightly curved.
Curved line terminations are either made up of convex lines b, and convex and concave curves c, or concave
curves d. This last termination is seldom used. It was used by the Greeks in their acanthus ornament, which
they formed on the acanthus spinosa (prickly).
Convex lines ( h ). ?These may be either slightly convex (flattish), as shown, or very round, as dotted, see Fig.
35, where the ends of the anthemion leaflets are all convex, and the central leaflets of Fig. 12 are also convex.
Convex and Concave (c).? The side leaflets of anthemions Fig. 12, and the side leaves of lotus flower Fig. 11,
and ivy leaves Fig. 32, are concave and convex.
Concave curves (</). ?See the central leaflet, Fig. 36.
All the varieties of curved line terminations are used in Conventional Ivy leaf, Fig. 31.
Varieties of Leaf Terminations in Fleur de Lys.
The Fleur de Lys is a group of three simple and generally entire leaves used as a symbol of the Virgin. They
are likewise the arms of Florence and France; they are often called the Lilies of France, but are really the
conventional representation of the Flag or Iris, which grow plentifully on the banks of the River Lys. Fig. 49

contains eleven representations of this badge, all of which have been used in ornamentation as the unit of a design.
All are conventional representations of the same natural form, their variety being obtained by altering the leaf
terminations.
1 is straight lined.
2 is convexly terminated.
3 to 8 have the central leaf convex, the side leaves convex and concave.
9 has the central leaf concave, the outer leaves convex and concave.
10 and* 11 have the leaves all concavely terminated.
An infinite variety could be obtained by altering the proportions of the leaves or by dividing the leaves into
segments, as in Fig. 52, a, b, <-. The method of dividing a simple entire leaf up into lobes and sections is dealt
with at the end of this chapter.
Leaves in Nature.
Fig. 50 and 51 show reduced drawings of Ivy (a, h, c ), Plane {d, e ), Nasturtium, Chrysanthemums (/, y), and
Marguerite (/<), all simple leaves ; and Columbine, Wisteria, and Jasmine, compound leaves.
The three Ivy leaves, Fig. 50, n, b, c were each taken from the same plant? a, from a shoot growing above the
wall; b, from the same shoot just below the level of the wall; and c, from the same plant much lower down upon
the older stock. Scientists tell us that cis deeply cleft because it grew upon the older portion of the plant. The
same reason probably accounts for one Plane leaf d being lobed with a plain edge, whereas the other e is lobed and
serrated. Leaves in nature are infinitely variable. Not only do leaves on different trees vary, but the individual
leaves of a tree are very variable, yet it has been observed that nature in many instances repeats in the minor
divisions of a leaf the characteristics of the general form. The long sword of the Aloe is armed with sharper
swords at its point and edge, the round leaf of the Nasturtium has a large (flat) curved edge, the rounded leaf of
the Columbine has its edge cut up into round-shaped masses (crenated), the large wide leaf of the Chrysanthemum
fis divided into large lobes, and the serrations of its lobes are broad and flat, whereas the longer leaves of the
Chrysanthemum y and Marguerite h, are divided into long lobes and the serrations of their margins are long and
pointed.
Proportion in Nature.
There appears to be a wonderful oneness in design in nature, a harmonious relationship of the parts to the
whole, and it is this sequence in proportion which is valuable to the designer of leaf forms. In Fig. 52 I have
made some sketches and have figured the various lobes so as to emphasize this increase in size from the smallest to
the largest lobe. This progression in size is to be observed in the drawings from Nature (Figs. 50 and 51) in leaves
c, d, e,f, g, h, and in the Columbine and the Wisteria, but not in the Jasmine, where the largest sized leaflet is the
middle one. It seems to be a rule in compound leaves whose typical form (dotted line Fig. 51) is large towards
the apex (Wisteria) that the leaflets increase in size as they approach the terminal leaflet, but when the typical
form is largest at the base of the leaf (Jasmine) the central leaflet is the largest of the side leaflets. In the bottom
left hand of Fig. 52 I have shown a leaf divided into lobes, the base of the clefts c c c c touch a dotted typical form
which is in harmony with the outer typical form drawn dotted through the apices of the lobes. This harmony of
line is no artistic freak, for it is distinctly observable in the drawings from Nature, Fig. 50 c, d,f. It is a most
interesting and universal principle in leaves. Once observed, it is a pleasure to watch its constant recurrence.
Setting out of a Leaf in Ornament.
In setting out a leaf remember the last paragraph.
X. Draw the axial line (the midrib); it is the backbone of the leaf.
2. Draw the outer typical form so that it is evenly distributed on both sides of the axial line.
3. Draw the inner typical form in harmony with the outer. If it be near the outer the lobes will be short
and must be numerous.
(Note; these lines are shown dotted for easy reference, but should not be drawn with dotted line when
setting out.)


Draw the side ribs all springing from the base of the leaf, if broad, or tending towards the midrib if
narrow. Do not let them touch one another, or the midrib. The direction of the side ribs decides the
outline of the lobes. If the side rib is a single curve, the upper edge of the lobe is convexly in harmony
with it; if, as in the narrow leaf, the side ribs are compound curves (commencing convexly and ending
concavely) the upper edge of the lobe must be concave to harmonize with them.
Draw the lobes without serrations, as shown dotted in broad leaf.
Fill in serrations.

student of design should now be able to take any leaves in Fig. 50 and render them conventionally by
the various Leaf terminations, and the laws of Proportion in Nature.


CHAPTER 111.
The Natural and Ornamental Laws op Radiation?Symmetry?Contrast?Tangential
- Curvature of Line.
I wish to emphasize what I said in my last upon the study of leaf forms and their terminations.
Nature is the foundation of design ?the designer must study leafage and flowers, but specially must he study
leaves and their terminations.
The design should possess both the general and the terminal characteristics of the leaf it is based upon.
Experience teaches me that a beginner in design, in copying or inventing ornament, sets out the leading lines
with care and neatness, but fills in his leaf points with such ill drawn work that the character of the original is
lost, or the invention is marred by slovenly detail.
In this chapter I will deal with certain laws found in Nature and obeyed in good Ornament, viz., Radiation ,
Symmetry, Contrast, and Tangential curvature of line. The recognition of these laws will afford the observer much
satisfaction in the contemplation of Nature and Ornament which is withheld from the ignorant.
Radiation.
The word is derived from the Latin radius a ray, rod or spoke. Radiating lines have.the appearance of rods,
rays or radii shooting out from a centre. Radiating lines may be either straight or curved ; both are found in
Nature. There is a gracefulness in radiating curved lines over and above the beauty obtained in those which are
straight.
Straight lined Radiation in Xatare a, h, c, d, e,f and g. Fig. 54. This is found in low organisms as the Starfish,
in Snowflakes, a (magnified) ; in Crystals or in small details of plants as the Dandelion"' fruit, h ; or it is hidden
and a section has to be made of the natural object enclosing it, as in the cross sections of Apple fruit c, Seed
vessels, Roppy d, Tulip e, Foxglove /', and in exogenous Tree trunks g. Exogenous Trees are those whose growth
is produced by annular rings of wood, formed immediately under the bark ( e.ro, outwards ; gennao, I produce).
Curved line Radiation in Nature, a. b, c, d e,f g, and h. Fig. 54 is paramount. In the higher animal forms
there are not many instances of straight-line radiation as fantail pigeon and peacock tails when extended. Shells
a afford admirable examples of radiation simple and complex. The flowers Lotus h, Daffodil c, and Buttercup <t,
are shown in vertical section so as to make the drawing clear and emphasize the fact that Pistil, Stamens, and
Corolla petals all radiate in curved lines ; the Mallow fruit e, and Lily f, show this curved radiation. All of these
flowers if treated conventionally in plan as the Daisy, Fig. 33, would afford straight lined radiation. The radia-
tion of leaves from their stem appears to be straight lined g x , Rosette like when looked down upon in plan, but
when seen sideways a note of higher harmony is observed, and the radiation is more beautiful, g". These g l and
g" are two views of the same spray of Oleander, whose leaves grow in rings of three. The wing and tail feathers of
birds, the crest of the cockatoo, the mane of the lion are all good samples of curved line radiation in Nature. If
drapery be hung up two points of support, the material will drape or fall in radiating folds from its points of
suspension. Man is a straight lined radiating unit of the globe on which he walks erect and is himself in his parts
an instance of the radiation of line of a highly complex description. Man?s hand is the masterpiece of Nature h ;
the slight curve of the back of the hand gives the fingers that tendency to lap over each other which is the source
of subtle and beautiful curves when the hand is half closed. Not only do the fingers form radiating curves, but
the corresponding nails and joints all lie in curves. The foot possesses similar beauties in the toes, hut these are
not so apparent because they are shorter and are generally distorted and cramped by the modern boot.
Radiation in Art. ?How have designers profited by these beauties to be observed in Nature? ?Figs. 56 to 61.
They have embodied them in all their art. Wherever severity is required, as in Fig. 10, or wherever the regular
division of a geometric surface is obtained, as in Figs. 9, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 33 (plan of Daisy), there straight lined
radiation is the foundation of the design. The straight lined radiation of the spokes of a cart affords a maximum
of strength and some beauty, but all will notice that the beauty of radiation in a wheel is not to be compared to
* The English dandelion, not the llower which goes by that name here.


the beauty of the radiating ribs of a fan which, being eccentric and lapping over each other, form in every aspect
a curve of varied character; so too, if curved lines are used, a still higher element of beauty is obtained.
This has been illustrated in Figs. 11, 12, 33 (elevation of the Daisy), 35, and in the veins of the Conventional
Ivy leaves, Figs. 30 and 31.
Artists have invariably recognised this rule. The Egyptian and the Assyrian in their Lotus borders, the
Greek in his Anthemion borders, and also in the rendering of hair in sculpture, Fig. 58, has made it radiate in
rosette masses from the centre of growth at the back of the head; in his draperies, Fig. 59, he adhered to this
principle. The Artists of the Italian Renaissance (re-birth) of art, Fig. 57, based their draperies upon a fan-like
radiation of fold.
The little lion which caps the dwarf railing in front of the British Museum is a model of conventional work
wherein the artist has made the mane to radiate in masses from the natural centres of growth upon the forehead,
temple, cheek, and jaw, besides insisting on the whorl of the hair which is found on lions, horses, &c., at the back
of the neck x, and the inside of the arm y. The artist has thus crystallised Nature in his conventional treatment,
Fig. 60.
In the decorative treatment of plates or plaques they are almost universally treated as a geometric surface
(a circle), and are divided into equal parts by radiating straight lines, the ornament being evenly distributed over
the spaces so obtained, Fig. 56, in which the axial lines of the three amorini (little loves) and three shields radiate from
the plate?s centre ; these six separate masses are connected and the border held together by festoons of flowers.
The centre, being a portrait, does not come under the severe rules of ornament. When the design of a plate is a
running border it will be found that the unit of such border repeats 4, 6, 8, or 12 times in equal spaces obtained
by radiating straight lines.
Rosettes, Fig. 61, 1 to 13, are circular ornament frequently used in architecture and design ; they are based
upon floral forms and are erroneously supposed to have been founded upon the Rose. Their type in nature is found
in many plants such as the Madder and Bedstraw, which have their leaves arranged in whorls around the joints of
their upright stems. Looking down upon the leaves they appear as a rosette. In architecture they are nearly
always composed of clusters of leaves, 1, 2, 3, 6, and were used to ornament recesses in ceilings and the under-
sides of cornices, where they are more effective than conventionalised flower-heads, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13, which
being lighter and more fanciful are suitable for a less severe ornament than is required in architecture. They
embody the principle of radiation and may be either straight or curved, 3, or straight and curved combined, 10.
Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, are Roman architectural rosettes.
No. 4 is a Pompeiian painted rosette.
No. 7, and 8 are Byzantine low relief carvings and symbolize the Christian faith, both containing the cross,
whilst No. 7 contains a five lobed leaf typical of Christ and the four Evangelists, and in No. 8, each extremity of
the cross is a leaf of three parts, each part consisting of three leaflets, typical of the Trinity.
Nos. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, are painted ornaments from various sources.
All rosettes should have a distinctly marked centre; 7 and 8 are unsatisfactory , and 13 nearly so.
Symmetry.
The word is derived from two Greek words meaning with or together and measure. It means?That disposition
of a figure which affords an equal balance of its parts on the two sides of its axial line.
The letter W is unsymmetrical.
The letter O is symmetrical.
To make W symmetrical both its inner lines should be thin and its outer ones should be thick.
The axial line x x divides b Fig. 54, a l , h, c, d, Fig. 55, into corresponding halves; these are therefore
symmetrical.
Bi-symmetrical is when an object is so arranged that it has two axial lines, cither of which will divide it into
corresponding halves as/ Fig. 54. The letter Ois bi-symmetrical.
Multi-symmetrical is when an object is so arranged that it has three or more axial lines as a, c, d, e, y , Fig.
54 and Figs. 9, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 18.
Symmetry in Nature. ?All Nature is symmetrical; the lower the organism the more is it symmetrical or multi-
symmetrical (shell of sea urchin). Simple leaves are symmetrical. Compound leaves are symmetrical; not that
the leaflets on either side of the stalk arc themselves symmetrical, but those on the left balance the leaflets on th

right of the central stalk, which is the axial line of the compound leaf. Flowers and fruits are symmetrical.
Whenever in Nature the parts or organs are many and diverse in their nature, symmetry is not found in the
individual parts, but in the balance of parts by their fellows. In man, Nature?s highest work, the axial line
divides equally the single parts or features ?forehead, nose, mouth, chin, and trunk, whilst the duplicate features
(eyes and ears), and limbs (arms with hands and legs with feet), are not themselves symmetrical, but each balances
its fellow. The eyes form a more perfect balance than do the ears, which, if seen at the same time, appear so
foreshortened that we are unable to detect their want of symmetry. Observation shows that these are often very
dissimilar, so also one hand or one foot is larger than the other. Nature conforms slavishly to symmetry in the
lower and breaks from it in higher organisms, but only when its variance is not likely to disturb the actual balance.
A squint is merely a want of symmetry in the eyes, and is an artistic defect noticed by the unskilled in art.
Symmetry in Ornament is obtained b}- repeating or doubling. It is a law of order. It is the even distribution
of an ornament about its axial line. Unsymmetrical ornament is not evenly distributed. A bad ornament when
made symmetrical by doubling is invariably improved. Any form, even the ugliest, when balanced by its double
will become ornament. The common experiment of writing a name in ink, and creasing the paper while the ink
is wet, so that it prints a repetition on the opposite side of the creased axial line, affords a capital illustration of
the ornamental value of doubling. Whenever this rule is waived it results in licence and finally in corrupt art.
When the whole of a design, for instance, around a column, cannot be seen and compared, the ornament may
vary in detail so long as it balances in mass. Nature does not balance man?s ears.
Symmetrical ornament is found in Figs. 10, 11, 12, 30, 31, 32, 33 (elevation), 34, 35, 36, 42, 43, 46, 49, 53, 62,
and 63.
Multi-symmetrical ornament is found in Figs. 9, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, and 33 (plan), the border of Fig. 56, and
the Rosettes Fig. 61.
Bi-symmetrical ornament is very useful for rectangular panels in which a horizontal direction is required and
also for book covers. Fig. 64 is of Persian niello work. Fig. 65 is a stamped leather book cover, and is
particularly useful as showing that a scheme of ornament can be obtained by by the use of only a few tools. The
tools used are shown at the right hand bottom corner. Ceilings, horizontal surfaces, or horizontal panels on
vertical surfaces may be treated Bi-symmetrically with good effect.
Absolute Symmetry; the more geometric the ornamental unit the more absolute must be the symmetry, but the
higher the organic rank of the ornament, the less rigidly must this rule be obeyed. The Egyptian painting, Fig.
66, is absolutely symmetrical, and is ungraceful, stiff, and formal, whereas Fig. 67 is graceful and is sufficiently
balanced for ornamental purposes; this deviation from absolute symmetry is termed Relative Symmetry. This is
further illustrated in Fig. 68 (a Pompeiian wall decoration) wherein the vases on the right are balanced by the
coils of the snake on the left, the Triton with the Thyrsus at the top of the curled column is balanced by a similar
figure on the left, the drinking vessel balances the pipes in the group hanging from the ceiling of the canopy, the
cone head of the Thyrsus behind the central stand of fruit is balanced by the tree tops in the garden beyond the
partly drawn curtain. This design is most skilfully treated in the Relative symmetry of its parts, and it also most
excellently illustrates bad surface decoration. By the perspective treatment of the ornament, the wall has
apparently been recessed, a platform carries a stand of fruit and vases of wine; this is covered with a roofed
canopy; above the walls of the recess the sky is painted and the partly drawn curtain permits one to catch a
glimpse of the garden; the recess is bright and light with colour, the main walls are deep-toned and dark, so
that the effect of the ornament is to create an impression of openness, light, and air; the intention is to deceive.
These subjects were the fashion in Pompeii and were so well painted as to be deceptive.
Contrast.
This is the quality of oppositeness. It enhances by bringing into juxtaposition two opposite qualities. It is
a source of vivacity, brilliance, and force.
A vertical line is a contrast to a horizontal line.
A straight-sided surface is a contrast to a curved surface.
An octagon is a contrast to a square.
A yellow surface is a contrast to a purple surface.
A red surface is a contrast to a green surface.
A blue surface is a contrast to an orange surface.
A black surface is a contrast to a white surface.


CHAPTER IY.
Designing is Non-laborious ?The Value of Brush-drawing and the Conditions for Applying
Ornament to Various Surfaces.
In the previous chapters I have explained the origin of design, its uses, its unit, its even distribution, its
essential flatness or subordination to the surface ornamented, its non-naturalistic tendency, its conventionality
founded upon nature, and its leaf terminations ; the proportional regularity of nature s leafage, and the method of
setting out ornamental leaves ; further, I have explained the Natural and Ornamental laws of Radiation,
Symmetry, Contrast, and Tangential curvature of line.
The Student now has some idea of ornament, and it remains for me in this final chapter to afford such direc-
tions that he, who is capable of drawing, may apply his theoretical knowledge of ornament to the production of
designs with the least chance of falling into serious error.
Fi rs t.?I will show that designs may be got out with but little labour.
Second. ?I will explain that drawing with the brush is easy, rapid, advantageous, and should be mastered hj
the designer.
Third. ?I will explain the various principles governing the decoration of Horizontal and Vertical Surfaces, as
well as the decoration of Mouldings, Vases, Plaques, and Fans, and the principles applicable to Panels and
Borders.
I. ?Designing Not Laborious.
To the average student designing is very laborious. I propose to show that this need not be the case. The
easiest way to design is by rule and compass.
Fig. 73 gives three samples of designs ?
a Symmetrical
h Bi-symmetrical
c Multi-symmetrical
If the student will now follow an explanation of the easiest method of copying and balancing these designs he
will be able to apply the same method to producing his original designs.
Make the copies about three times the size of the diagram.
Fig. 73 a has one half of the design repeated to left and right of the axial line xx. It fills a lectangle x 3in.
1. Rule x x.
2. Draw the lines on the left oi x x not exactly but so as to obtain them appioximately.
3. Fold the paper on x x so that the pencil lines on its left fold upon the clean paper on the right of x x.
4. Hold the paper securely upon a flat smooth surface (glass is the best), and fiimly mb on the back of
the drawing with anything hard?the blade of a knife, if it has a rounded point, is very suitable.
Rub only in one direction, not backwards and forwards. The pencil lines will be faintly transferred
from the left to the right of x x.
5. Darken in the lines on the right of x x to make the copy evenly stiong, and it is complete.
Fig. 73 b has two axial lines ?x x, yy. It fills a rectangle of 9in. x 3in.
1. Rule the axial lines.
2. Draw the left hand top quarter of the design.
3. Fold the paper on y y.
4. Rub off the drawing upon the left hand bottom quarter.
5. Strengthen the obtained lines. One half of the design is complete
6. Fold the paper on x x.
7. Rub off the drawing upon the right of x x.
8. Strengthen the obtained lines, The design is complete,


Fig. 73c is a multi-symmetrical design, and has four axial lines ?x x , yy,aa, b b, which intersect in u. It
fills a square of Gin.
1. Rule the axial lines.
2. Draw the one-eighth of the design which is contained in the triangle a o x.
3. Fold on x x.
4. Rub off and obtain the lines in the triangle x o b.
5. Strengthen the obtained lines. One quarter of the design is complete.
6. Fold on y y.
7. Rub off and obtain the lines in the triangle bo a.
H. Strengthen the obtained lines. One half of the design is complete
9. Fold on a a.
10. Rub off and obtain the lines in the triangles bo a, a o b.
11. Strengthen the obtained lines. The design is complete.
When a multi-symmetrical design has six axial lines its ornament is often disposed alternately ?two
groups alternating one with the other, as the Central Snow Flake, Fig. 54c, and the plaque, 56. In such a
case a half of each of the alternating ornament has to be drawn before folding and rubbing off.
Mem. ?The amorini in Fig. 56 would be relatively not absolutely symmetrical, and each slightly varied; not
all three alike. They could not be obtained by rubbing off, as could any number of the Egyptian painting,
Fig. 66. This paper deals only with Elementary design, which does not include the Figure. The illustrations
wherein figures are given are only used by me to show where the rules of ornament should be relaxed and where
they should be severely followed.
Folding the paper in the above method damages it, and renders it unsuitable for colour or high finish. The
following is the better method, but requires more care, as the brittle tracing paper is easily torn if roughly
rubbed.
For Fig. 73a ?
1. Rule axial line x x.
2. Draw left side.
3. Pin tracing paper over the drawing.
4. Rule axial line on tracing paper.
5. Most carefully draw the ornament on the tracing paper with a finely-pointed and rather soft pencil.
I use Cohen?s B, which is equal to Faber?s II B.
6. Turn drawing on tracing paper down upon right hand side of axial line ; rub off and strengthen
the lines.
For Fig. 736
1. Rule axial lines.
2. Draw top half on left of x x, and trace it
3. Transfer from tracing upon bottom half on left of x x.
4. Place the tracing carefully upon top half on right of x x, but do not rub it off.
5. Transfer this quarter by carefully drawing over the pencil lines on the under side of tracing paper,
thereby transferring the required lines, and obtaining a drawing on the upper side of tracing paper.
6. Transfer this drawing to the remaining quarter to complete.
For Fig 73c ?
1. Draw one-eighth, and trace.
2. Transfer from tracing, thus obtaining one quarter.
3. Replace tracing carefully on the original eighth, and trace the second eight.
4. The tracing of the quarter now obtained will, if used carefully, enable .the Student to rub off the
required three-quarters, and complete the design.
The art of copying these consists in a slight knowledge of geometric drawing in ruling lines, the ability
to draw a few lines, and the capacity to trace accurately, to fold neatly, and to rub carefully. These essentials
are the property of all, or can be easily obtained. The only additional requisite to become a designer is the
mental capacity to adapt. After so many centuries of art progress it is hardly possible to design anything
which shall be at the same time beautiful and entirely original. Given this power to adapt, and the results
obtainable are very great compared with the amount of labour required,


If you can copy these, commence to design others by altering their proportions. Place 73c in a circle.
Elongate it and make it a bi-symmetrical design. They contain a very minute amount of invention. Their
effect is due to accurate multiplication. With mechanical assistance you evenly distribute ornament upon its
lines.
ll.?Brushwork Easy, Rapid, and Advantageous.
The most difficult lines to draw with a brush are the perfect straight and the perfectly curved line. The
easiest drawings are the shapes shown in Fig. 74.
The stroke of a brush should create a shape. Shapes are bounded by lines. Brush shapes are more
effective than are the outlines, the margins of such shapes, and are obtained more rapidly. Compare Fig. 74
with Fig. 75.
A brush tapers to a point and is very flexible. In drawing with the brush the designer, making use of
its flexibility, obtains various forms, according to the amount of pressure employed and the moment of its
application.
To practice brushwork the Student should take a moderate size round brush, charge it with colour, bring
the brush down upon the paper, then draw it gradually downwards, lifting it as it approaches the end of the
stroke Fig. 74�; then repeat in a curved direction Fig. 74 b; and so on, fixing upon different points in the
stroke of the brush for applying that increase of pressure which is to give to the stroke its character. A little
practice will show what can be attained. Drawings should be made quite four times as large as the
illustrations.
Fig. 76 shows some Anthemion forms suggested by brush strokes ? b, c, d, e, f y, and h, in Fig. 74.
These were obtained by drawing a series of strokes in harmony with the selected form.
Greek Anthemions are simply ingenious arrangements of harmonious brush strokes?Figs. 12, 35, 69.
Fig. 77, o, b, c, are the skeleton diagrams in Fig. 73 enriched with brush forms.
Brush forms need not consist of leaves having entire outlines. Leaves with serrated edges and lobed are
obtained by a stroke for each serration. The leaves may also be of two tints or colours. See h, Fig. 76,
where the leaf was first painted a light tint ?represented by the hatched lines ?and the outline was after-
wards painted darker.
Fig. 79 represents two versions of the same ornament, dark on a light ground, and light on a dark
ground. The Student should often (I had almost written always) treat his designs in this manner. In
obtaining the light on a dark ground the ornament should be painted in Chinese white upon a dark paper,
or a blackened surface. To draw ornament is better practice than fiddling around the ornament?s outline
whilst painting the background.
Greek and Persian pot painting and all Japanese art are executed with a brush
The Greek?s brushwork is severe, because his art was the handmaid to his architecture, which required
order and nobility.
The Persian?s brushwork is more free (/*, Fig. 76 and Fig. 63), because he went direct to floral forms for
the purpose of his weaving.
The Japanese and Greek (as also probably the Persian) held the brush in the same manner (Fig. 78), so
as to allow free play to the wrist.
If at first you do not succeed with brush forms, do not quarrel with the brush. Become its master. You
will have a willing slave.
Mi.?Principles Governing Decoration of Horizontal, Vertical, and other Surfaces.
Horizontal Surface: Floors , Ceilings , Sfc. ? Their designs should have no dominant direction.
Floors , being generally covered with mats or carpet and furniture, are not often decorated. If the design
is an ?all over? one it generally consists of tiles, with a geometric repeating pattern, or of mosaic (Fig. 80),
or a diapering or spotting of ornament (Fig. 81). The word diapering is a corruption of the word ? D?Ypres,?
a Flemish town, where linens were made,, the ornamentation of which consisted of small spots, geometric forms,
&c., spotted regularly on the material. The term diapering, however, now includes ?all over? ornament,
which is obtained by a regularly repeated uni'. Figs. 87, 88, 89, are diapers. Borders are often used, and
are of inlaid woods, tiles, mosaic, &c. The best are similar to Japanese carpet borders (Fig. 82) or Indian carpet

borders (Figs. 83, 84, 86), in which though the leading lines of the design have direction, yet the eye is regularly
detained by floral masses which destroy this direction. In Fig. 80 the direction of the triangular pieces of
mosaic in the border is alternately reversed, and emphasizes the original stopping of the border by the square
masses.
Mohammedan carpets have no direction in their design, save their prayer carpets. These are always placed
so that the kneeler is facing Mecca, and the carpet?s decoration points thitherward. Modern manufacturers copy
these as hearthrugs. Truly the manufacturer being a fool finds many fools to patronize him.
Fig. 85 is a memory sketch of the unit of a border used in the S. K. Museum. Walking down this corridor
all the lions and Y.Rs. are seen upside down; walking the reverse way of the corridor they are right way up.
The direction of this border renders it unsuitable for other than a vertical surface.
Exception ?The floor decoration of the aisles and chancel of a church, in that they are passages leading
to the principal feature of the church, may have direction.
Note that the rich Indian border (Fig. 86) consists of eight bands of ornament, of which band 2 is repeated
four times and band 3 is repeated twice, A small amount of material thus affords a rich design.
Ceilim/s , when decorated all over, are multi-symmetrical if round, square, or octagonal. They are
hi-symmetrical if rectangular (Fig. 87b), or they may be treated with a centre and border (Fig. 87a), in which
the centre is multi-symmetrical, the corners are symmetrical, and the masks at the centre of each side are
placed so as to be seen right way up when standing below.
Fig. 87c represents a ceiling surface broken up into smaller surfaces called panels. In decorating these the
above principles would be observed.
Artists have always viewed ceilings as affording opportunities for large paintings. In their treatment ?the
pride of the painter is everything ?the instincts of the designer have no share. They are difficult to paint, and
painful to look at when painted, besides being upside down to the majority.
In Michael Angelo?s ceiling of the Sistine Chapel he has arranged all the groups so that they are seen by
the congregation, and lead in sequence through the Creation, Temptation, Expulsion, etc., to the altai, at the
back of which is the Last Judgment, He has given his work such a direction as to lead the attention of the
people to the holiest.
Bed Couvrette. ?The decoration may spring from the bottom and grow up towards the pillow (Fig. 77a), or
it may be treated bi-symmetrically (Figs. 77 h and or as a diapering (Figs. 88 and 89.)
Tablecloth. ?Decoration may be multi-symmetric, bi-symmetric, or a diaper of some multi-symmetric form;
or it may be covered with an irregular spotting of conventional forms (Fig. 86 ?quarter of cloth). There is
more order in this design than is at first apparent; the dotted lines explain that the scattered stems if continued
would be tangential to one another.
Fig. 87 is the quarter area of a cloth. It is very irregular in shape, but the four pieces shown in Fig. 87a
together make up the square cloth. This is a counterpoint arrangement of surface, and would be decorated by
a repeat of the unit four times.
Tables are so often covered that it is often a waste to decorate their centres, and their borders only are
ornamented. Figs. 62, 63, 83, 84, 86, and 101 a are suitable. As 62, 63, 83, and 86 have no corners, it would be
good practice to use them as the suggestion for table borders, and obtain their corners.
Vertical surfaces, such as walls, have in their decoration the vertical direction very pronounced, yet the
horizontal and oblique directions enter into the perfect design (Figs. 88, 89). Here the unit of a design is a square
and a rhombus (see dotted lines). The unit of a wall paper might be a rectangle, or any shape which would evenly
repeat and cover the wall.
The proportion of a vertical surface may be apparently altered by the direction of the decoration. Fig. 90
shows two walls; both are the same width, but the upper appears considerably the higher, because of the vertical
lines upon it; the lower is broken up into skirting (1), dado (2), wall surface (3), picture rail (4), frieze (5), and cornice
(6). The horizontal lines of these divisions apparently diminish the wall?s height, for both walls are the same.
To colour a room there is no rule. A safe plan is for the dado to be from darkish to dark, wall surface lighter,
frieze light, and cornice to repeat the colours of the room in pale bands. If the colours of the upper portion be used
strongly they will attract the eye. That which attracts the eye appears to come forward, consequently the ceiling
appears to come down and the room is made low, though vertical lines may predominate on the walls,

The Pompeiians used the following colour schemes :
Of course the yellows, reds, and greens varied in the several schemes of ornamentation, but strong colour
appears to have been their desire.
Fig. 91. ? a, b, c for upright borders on a wall are good in direction. If b and <? were used horizontally on a wall
they would be bad. Design a, consisting almost entirely of curved lines, is weak, and appears inclined to wobble,
whilst b, which has identical leading lines but different detail, is strong because of the horizontal lines in it. If a
continuous scroll is used on a vertical surface it should be placed horizontally, or strengthened with horizontal lines
or masses. The frieze of a room may be decorated with a continuous scroll, though it is more often decorated with
an ornament having vertical axial lines. Fig. 92, a, b, c, are from ancient Arabian borders incised in wet plaster.
The frieze may be treated very richly. It is a surface which in ancient architecture was left especially that it
might be richly ornamented.
Other Surfaces. ?Mouldings, Vases, Plaques, Fan, Panels, and Borders.
Mouldings. ?Their ornamentation should repeat or be in harmony with the outline of the body of the moulding
Fig. 93.
Vases should have a dominant division in their decoration wherever their outline is diversified in contour. In
other words, wherever there is a change of contour in a vase there is an apparent weakness, which is removed, and
the vase made apparently stronger if a line or band of decoration is added. Compare a and b, Fig. 94.
This apparent strengthening by means of decoration drawn on the wet clay with a pointed stick was understood
by the savage Fig. 95, a and b. If a vase be designed of alternate and equal hollows and rounds, it follows that its
bands of ornament would be equidistant, and the result sameness, want of variety ; its value would be enhanced by
contrast in the proportion of its curves, which would introduce variety in outline and in the widths of its bands of
ornament Fig. 96, a and b. If the outline of the vase be simple and diminishing, the bands may be graduated in
height Fig. 97, a and b.
Fig. 98. ?These are examples of good and bad Greek and Chinese art; good, where the ornament has been
confined to one contour of the vase by bands or borders; bad, where the love of painting ?which is not necessarily
the love of decorating ?has led the artist to spread his decoration over the changing contours of the vase. The
Greek is the greater sinner. To distort the human figure is serious. The Chinese has kept the highest quality in
his design (the bird) on one contour, and carried the tree stem over all the vase?s contours.
The Greeks, however, and the Persians were generally proficient in the art of proportioning their ornament
to their vases. In Fig. 98e the neck of the vase shows very delicate scrolls ; these are repeated and strengthened
on the body, with other additions, so that the chief characteristic is maintained throughout the decoration.
Plaques: Fig. 100, a , b, c , d, e. ?The leading lines of the ornament to their borders either radiate from the
centre a, b, c, or it is concentric with the edge of the plaque d, or the ornament is a continuous spiral e, though
this spiral may be broken regularly by large masses, such as wreaths, shields, figures, &c.
When the outline of the plaque is broken, the radiating ornament of the borders must coincide with such
outline (� and b). I
The unit of the border must be repeated an even number of times, 4, 6, 8, &c.
When the leading line is not parallel with the edge of the plaque, as d , it is necessary that certain lines of
the ornament should be concentric, or in harmony with that edge, as b and c.
Fan : Fig. 100 f ?The ornament of a fan comes under the same principles as the border of a plaque.
The number of ribs in a fan need have no connection with the ornamentation.
The playful toy is often decorated so that the larger mass falls on the left side x x, and the colour or
ornament is balanced by a small quantity, at y, on the right.
The ornament should never run across the fan at z z.


Panels are generally recessed, as the panels of a door, and enclosed by lines or mouldings and borders.
Fig. 87 ?a, I), c may be considered as horizontal panels. Fig. 91? a, b , n are vertical panels. In treatment they
come under the principles affecting horizontal and vertical surfaces. Being surrounded and shut in by pro-
tective mouldings their ornamentation may be freer and less severe than that of borders. Panels are often
broken up into smaller panels, in which case variety should be introduced by breaking them up into various
sized panels, as in Fig. 87c. In a vertical rectangular panel vertical lines will predominate (Fig. 77a). In a
horizontal rectangular panel horizontal lines will prevail (Fig. lib). In a square panel having all its sides equal
neither line should predominate (Fig. 11c). The ornament should not touch the border, but always extend
parallel to the border, as shown by dotted line Fig. 736.
Borders : Figs. 10,11,12, 15, 32, 38, 39, 40, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 56, 62, 63, 64, 69, 70, 71, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85,
86, 87, 92 a h c, 100, 101 a b c d ?Borders may consist of a simple line, an arrangement of lines, or an arrange-
ment of lines and ornament, or an arrangement of lines of ornament. Anything which is used to surround a
space is a border. They are used for vertical and horizontal surfaces. Fig. 82 is suitable for either. Fig. 80
is suitable for a horizontal surface ; compare this border with Fig. 1016, which is for a vertical surface; the
difference is slight, but marked. Fig. 101 a is a border for a tablecloth, when the ornament starts at each
corner and overlaps at the centre of the sides. Fig. 101 c is a border for a vertical surface; it commences at
the centre of the lower side, runs right and left and up the side; neither side of this is in itself symmetrical, but
the two halves of the design balance, and it is therefore a symmetrical design. In Fig. 87a the border is
carried into the ceiling and encloses the centre of the ceiling. Fig. 101r/ is a border of pomegranate used
upon tiles, in which it is essential that no important part of the ornament should fall upon the joints (dotted
lines) of the tiles. The parallelism of ornament in borders to the outline of the border is essential.
These are the principles of Elementary Ornament. The Student who will carefully use these suggestions
and practice himself in designing will attain in a short time a proficiency which will be a surprise to himself
and an abundant recompense for his efforts.
