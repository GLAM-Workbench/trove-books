GENERAL LAWS,
Classified by order of the Melbourne V.H.C.M.
REGISTERED UNDER THE FRIENDLY SOCIETIES? ACT.
� \\\ governments and societies of men do in the process of long time gather an irre-
irularitv and wear away much of their primitive Institution. And, therefore, the true
wisdom of all ages hath been to review, at fit periods, those errors, defects, or excesses
that have insensibly crept into the public administration : to brush the dust off the
wheels and oil them again ; or, if it be found advisable, to chose a set of new ones. And
this reformation is most easily, and with the least disturbance, to be effected by the
Society itself, no single man being forbidden by any magistrate to amend his own
manners, and much more, all societies having the liberty to bring themselves within
compass. 7 * ?Andrew Marvel. . ?.
