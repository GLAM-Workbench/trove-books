FOREWORD
HE launching of this biographical
gallery of “ BALLARAT district
jJu CITIZENS AND SPORTS” breaks
ck IM£ new ground in the “Who’s Who” type
of publication. For the democratic
range of its personnel I offer no
apology. I have assembled together
thus compactly “thumb-nail” records
of the public and sporting associa-
tions of nearly 1,100 personalities of this district of
Greater Ballarat.
Ballarat district citizens and “sports” are as pro-
gressive as those of any other center. Men and women
of both types have individually and collectively helped
to build up this picturesque and progressive city and
environs. And while thus proving qualities of good
citizenship they have enhanced their own prestige in one
or other of the realms of art, science, commerce or in
manual industry, in healthy honest sport or in religious
and philanthropic endeavor, in legislative halls and civic
chambers or on more sanguinary fields of battle ; in the
preservation of life and property ur in the healing of the
sick and the relief of the indigent and infirm.
I am pleased to be able to add my publication to the
historical records of this community , believing it to be a
useful compendium of information of public service,
family history, etc., of most of the leading local men and
women of the time and of the district, many of whom


have gone further afield than their native heath in search
of fame and fortune. Having regard to the likelihood of
the future historians of Ballarat drawing upon this store
of information I have endeavoured to be accurate in the
compilation of the records.
It should be clearly understood that the records are
not auto-biographical. Indeed in many cases I have
relied entirely on my own knowledge of men and matters
during a journalistic career of nearly 20 years without
calling upon the subject concerned for the requisite facts.
Comment has been avoided as far as possible, the author
preferring to allow facts to speak for themselves, and any
semblance of comment is absolutely my own unless
where otherwise specified and for which the subject
concerned is in no way responsible. The book is not a
series of life stories —simply a record of facts, and I am
grateful to my many fellow citizens for their consent to
the use in the manner shown of their names and associa-
tions. Subscription is payment for the book itself
and not for an appearance therein.
I trust that “ Citizens and Sports ” —the first of its
kind launched in Ballarat —will breast the tide of popular
approval and enjoy a just measure of public appreciation
and support, and, finally, that all the subjects concerned
will “live as long as they want and never want as long
as they live.”
M M. McCALLUM
“ Rossarden,”
Wendouree,
July 31st, 1916
[To his contemporary comrades of the daily press of Ballarat
who may desire to draw from its stores, the author cordially
dedicates his work with an expression of hope that their efforts to
reflect or enlarge upon the virtues of those herein immortalised may
be facilitated by a reference to its pages ]

The Wiles Cooker
Has revolutionised Methods of Feeding our
Troops on the Battlefield
THE WILES COOKER is now exclusively employed
by the Commonwealth Government in supplying
the material needs of our Soldiers in the Great War
cutting out the Field Cookers of other Countries.
NAPOLEON once declared that an Army “Travels on
its Stomach” (or words to that effect). The Wiles
Cooker is the Soldiers’ Friend!
THE WILES COOKER is being adapted for use by
Squatters, Farmers and Dairyman , Shearers and Har-
vest Workers fed in quick time, Steam in a few
moments. For all Dairy, Homestead and Power
Purposes. Soldiers “swear by it” and so do all
Farm Workers.
WONDERFUL SAVING of time trouble and temper,
and of fuel for those who install the Wiles Cooker
on Farm or Station.
Designed by J. F. WILES, and Patented in Many Lands
