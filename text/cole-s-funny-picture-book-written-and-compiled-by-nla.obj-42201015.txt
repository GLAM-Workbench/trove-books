FUNNY HISTORY OF THE APPLE.
Greedy Neddie and the Apple.
• Mamma gave our Nelly an apple,
So round, and big, and red;
It seemed, beside dainty wee Nelly,
To be almost as large as her head
Beside her young Neddie was standing—
And Neddie loves apples, too;
Ah ! Nelly ! ’ said Neddie, • give brother
A bite ot your apple—Ah 1 do! *
Dear Nelly held out the big apple:
Ned opened his mouth very wide—
So wide, that the startled red apple
Could almost have gone inside !
And Oh 1 what a bite he gave it !
The Apple looked small. I declare.
When Ned gave it back to his sister,
Leaving that big bite there.
Poor Nelly looked frightened a moment,
Then a thought made her face grow bright,
* Here. Ned, you can take the apple —
I'd rather have the bite! ’ ” —Eva L. Carson
Playing Adam and Eve.
A small boy and his smaller sister had got
an apple each. Willie had eaten his apple.
Mabel still had hers.
Willie said: "Mabel, let’s play Adam and
Eve. You be Eve, and I’ll be Adam I ”
" Very well,” said Mabel, "all right. How
are we to do it ? ”
"Well, it’s this way,” said Willie. "You
tempt me to eat your apple, and I’ll do just as
Adam did I "
The Boot-black and the Apple.
’* Oh, he was a Bowery Boot-black bold,
And his years they numbered nine ;
Rough and unpolished was he, albeit
He constantly aimed to shine.
As proud as a king on his box he sat,
Munching an apple red.
While the boys of his set looked wistfully on,
And * Give us a bite! ’ they said.
But the boot-black smiled a lordly smile;
• No free bites here 1 ’ he cried.
Then the boys, they sadly walked away,
Save one, who stood by his side.
■ Bill, give us the core,’ he whispered low;
That boot-black smiled once more,
And a mischievous dimple grew in his cheek —
• There ain't going to be no con I ’ ”
It is said that Sir Isaac Newton discovered
universal gravitation through an apple falling
on his head when he was lying on the ground.
Sometimes school examinations are held on
the great subject of astronomy. One day a
Schoolmaster said ;
" Now tell me. what were the thoughts that
passed through Isaac Newton's mind when the
apple fell on his head? ”
One Hopeful Pupil answered :—" I ’xpects he
was awful glad it warn’t a brick.”
Adam's Apple.
Ancient histories and legends inform us that
“ when Eve gave Adam a piece of the apple
which she had stolen, to eat, he ate it, but that,
in swallowing, a piece of it stuck in his throat
and that, as a judgement, it still remains stuck
in the throats of all his male descendants ”
A Truthful Boy.
Jack's Mamma. —" There were three apples in
the cupboard, Jack, and now there are only
two. How does that happen ? ”
Jack. —" It was so dark in there, mamma,
that I didn’t see the others "
Tempting Nature of the Apple.
The apple is the most tempting of fruits
Its beauty, its smell, and its taste all tempt
mankind. It tempted Eve. our first mother;
it tempted Adam, our first father. It has
tempted millions of mothers and fathers since,
particularly when they were girls and boys
It once severely and- successfully tempted my
shipmates and myself in a case which I will
relate. In the year 1903, Captain Haswell, the
good-natured commander of the ship “ Kumana
Maru,” bought at Melbourne a supply of the
beautiful looking, delicious tasting, crisp eating
apples, named the Jonathan (the best of apples).
See picture of two on the next opening.
He bought what he thought would last for the
journey to Japan and back again; but, alas!
as the poet says. " The best laid schemes of
mice and men gang aft a gley.” The passen-
gers, including myself, inheriting the weakness
of our poor dear mother, Eve, were terribly
tempted by those beautiful apples and fell
deeply in love with them. Now, thousands of
authorities tell us that love is the strongest
power in the world, and we came completely
under its spell in the case of those apples We
did love those apples! more than even the
swain who affirmed that he loved his sweet-
heart so much that he could eat her 1 But we
went one better than that, for we loved those
apples with such an intensity of love that when
the ship arrived at Yokohama we had eaten
them all, and there was not one of them left for
the people who returned by her to love and
to eat.
Apples have tempted millions and millions to
steal. They have tempted millions of birds
and monkeys and ’possums and porcupines and
pigs to steal and eat them when they could get
a chance They have tempted millions of boys
to crawl through or get over fences and hedges
into orchards to steal them. Girls do not seem
to steal so many apples as boys Probably,
the chief reasons have been, in the past, that
they have not been so expert as the boys in
climbing trees, jumping fences, or throwing
stones to bring the fruit down But, undoubt-
edly, history gives girls the distinguished hon-
our, or dishonour, of stealing the first apple.
From the time that Eve stole the first apple
the apple has been a tempting bait to longing
people, not over-honest, and the boys have
stolen more than all the girls and all the men
and all the women put together. Eve’s weak-
ness for apples seems to have been inherited
more by her boy than by her girl descendants.
Millions of boys have stolen apples and not
been found out, and other millions have been
caught and scolded, caned, birched, smacked,
shut up, sent to bed without a supper, or pun-
ished in some other way Thousands of barrel-
fuls of tears have been shed, and thousands of
millions of weeps, silent and loud, have taken
place, through these beautiful, tempting apples
showing themselves to children. Some of the
delinquents have received their punishment in
silence, some with wrigglings and screechings
and bowlings, and some with a hardened spirit
A curious story is told of two little boys,
Johnny and Willie, who had been stealing
apples They were caught and brought to
their mother. Johnny was very sorry at
getting caught, and said that he would
not steal apples any more, and was let ofl ; but
Willie was stubborn, and would give no promise
His mother then pulled off her slipper and said.
•• Willie, I have told you a dozen times not to
steal apples, and yet you do it. I shall punish
you severely Come here! and now, where shall
1 begin? " " On the same old place, 1 expect,”
said Willie, laying himself across her knee.
A short time afterwards, Johnny, the would-
n't-do it-again boy, •*■»> caught afresh aad
brought to his mother, who at once pulled ofl
her slipper and began to whip him, when he.
hoping to get off. said, " Oh, ma, I have got on
my best pants.” But his mother coolly
answered, "Oh, yes, my son, so you have,
take them off! ” Johnny was sorry he spoke
A boy that liked work better
than Apples.
The greatest smiling historian of the world
Mark Twain, relates another apple story, in
which the American smartness for keen busi
ness is forcibly shown. A boy, by the name of
Ben Rogers, offered another boy, by the name
of Tom Sawyer, at first a core of an apple and
finally all the uneaten part of an apple, which
he was munching, to let nim work at white
washing a fence. The offer was accepted with
apparent reluctance by Tom Sawyer, who
however, got the double satisfaction of eating
the other boy’s apple and seeing him do the
work for nothing
The Young Wife’s Apple Dumplings.
The Young wife at dinner, said, sobbing, to
her husband, " Well George, I think it’s mean!
I made that apple dumpling as a pleasant sur-
prise for you, and now you ask me to bring you
a hand saw to cut it in two with. I think it’s
cruel of you 1"
" An apple dumpling I ” exclaimed her hus-
band. “ Upon my word. Maria, I thought it
was a cocoa-nut. But if you made it, my
darling, and if it's an apple dumpling, I’ll eat it,
if it kills me."
What Little Boys and Girls
Should Do?
Little boys and little girls should always
have plenty of apples to eat, and all little boys
and little girls should frequently, but respect-
fully, try to impress this upon the minds of
their parents; and that their parents should
eat them too.
Little boys and little girls should always ask
their parents to plant some nice kinds of apple-
trees in the garden ; and, whether they have a
garden or not. to keep some apples, fresh or
preserved, in the house, to eat for health and
pleasure’s sake.
An old English legend says:—
" Eat an apple going to bed,
Knock the doctor on the head.”
Unripe Apples are very bad.
After all that can be said in praise of apples
and their health giving power, there is one
aspect in which they are bad. The following
six short lines by an hilarious but doleful poet
will explain the matter better than I can :
" The early apple cometh,
And the undertaker hummeth,
And his face is lighted up with joys;
For he calculates that colic,
With its twinges diabolic,
Will double-up and spiflicate the boys."
A Funny Apple-pie Story.
" So he went into the garden to cut a cabbage
leaf to make an apple-pie; and at the same time
a great she-bear, coming up the street, pops his
head into the shop ' What, no soap ?' So he
died, and she very imprudently married the
barber ; and there were present the Picininies,
the Jobilillies, and the Gayrulies, and the
grand Panjandrum himself, with the little
round button at the top ; and they all fell to
playing the game of catch-as-catch-can till
the gunpowder ran out of the heels of their
boots "

TIRED AND GOING TO BED.
A Piece of Poetry for Mother and Father to Read.
I suppose if all the children,
Who have lived through ages long,
Were collected and inspected
They would make a wondrous throng
Oh, the babble of the Babel!
Oh, the flutter and the fuss ;
To begin with Cain and Abel,
And to finish up with us I
Some have never laughed nor spoken,
Never used their rosy feet ;
Some have even flown to heaven.
Ere they knew that earth was sweet
And, ipdeed, 1 wonder whether.
If we reckon every birth,
And bring such a flock together,
There is room for them on earth
Think of all the men and women
Who are now and who have been;
Every nation since creation
That this world of "ours has seen.
And of all of them, not any
But was once a baby small ;
While of children. Oh, how many
Never have grown up at all!


GETTING UP AS HAPPY AS LARKS
Who will wash their smiling faces ?
Who their saucy ears will box ?
Who will dress them and caress them T
Who will darn their little socks ?
Where are arms enough to hold them ?
Hands to pat each shining head ?
Who will praise them? who will srcld them 7
Win will p»,'\ them off to b* f
Little happy Christian children,
Little savage children too,
In all stages, of all ages,
That our planet ever knew ;
Little princes and princesses,
Little beggars, wan and faint—
Some in very handsome dresses,
with p»'n'
Only think of the confusion
Such a motley crowd would make;
And the clatter of their chatter,
And the things that they would break I
Oh, the babble of the Babel 1
Oh. the flurry and the fuss I
To begin with Cam and Abel,
And to finish up with us 1

To see a young lady on a white horse,
Rings on her fingers, and bells on her toes,
And so she makes music wherever she
goes.

When your dad comes home.

Merrily, merrily, ding, dong, ding!

Daddy’s gone a-hunting,
To get a little rabbit’s skin
To wrap a baby bunting in.
Hush-a-bye Baby.
Hush-a-bye baby, on the tree top,
When the wind blows the cradle will rock;
When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall;
Down will come baby, bough, cradle, and all.
Hush-a-bye baby, Daddy is near:
Mammy’s a lady, and that’s very clear.
Rock-a-bye Baby.
Kock-a-bye baby, thy cradle is green;
Father’s a nobleman, mother’s a queen;
And Betty’s a lady, and wears a gold ring,
And Johnny’s a drummer, and drums for
the king.
Kissing Baby.
My dear cockadoodle, my jewel, my joy,
My darling, my honey, my pretty, sweet
boy;
Before I do rock thee with soft lullaby,
Give me thy dear lips to be kiss’d, kiss’d,
kiss’d.

On your pretty cradle bed;

And the light are gone away ,
All the clothes are tucked in tight,
Little baby, dear, good-night.
Lie still with Daddy.
Hush thee, my babby,
Lie still with thy daddy,
Thy mammy has gone to the mill,
To grind thee some wheat,
To make thee some meat,
And so, my babby, lie still.

Has put on your night-cap,
And is feeding

For the sun is in the sky,
And he’s peeping once again
Through the pretty window pane:

Any longer fast asleep.

My pretty baby-brother
Is six months old to-day,
And though he cannot speak,
He knows whate’er I say.
Whenever I come near,
He crows for very joy;
And dearly do 1 love him,
The darling baby-boy.
Baby.
He opens his mouth when he kisses
you;
He cries very loud when he misses
you;
He says “Boo! boo! boo!” for
“ How-do-you-do ?”
And he strokes down your face when
he’s loving you.
Learning to walk alone.
Come, my darling, come away,
Take a pretty walk to-day;
Run along, and never fear,
I’ll take care of baby dear ;
Up and down with little feet,
That’s the way to walk, my sweet
See-Saw.
See-saw sacradown,
Which is the way to London town,
One foot up and the other down,
That is the way to London town.
Naughty Baby.
Baby, baby Charlie,
Naughty in his play,
Slapping little Annie,
Pushing her away.
Patting with his soft hanas,
Laughing in his fun;
Slapping with such good-will,
That the tear-drops run.
Do not cry, dear Annie,
Wipe away the tear;
Keep away from Charlie,
Do not come so near,
Or his little hands will
Pull your curly hair;
Peep at baby, Annie—
Peep behind the chair.
Kiss the baby, darling.
Kiss the little one;
He is only playing,
In his baby fun.

And the masts were made of gold.
The four-and-twenty sailors
That stood between the decks,
Were four-and-twenty white mice,
With chains about their necks.
The captain was a duck,
With a packet on his back ;
And when the ship began to move,
The captain said “Quack quack!”

Hey diddle diddle. , /
Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle,
The cow jumped over the moon:
The little dog laughed to see such sport
And the dish ran after the spoon.
The Quaker’s Version.
“Hey! diddle diddle,
The cat and the fiddle,
The cow jumped under the moon;
The little dog barked
To see the sport,
And the cat ran after the spoon!”*
♦ Our friend, the Quaker, holds that the last verse is the
proper one, as it is the truest; but the wonderful is taken
out of it, and children, accordingly, prefer the first.
There is nothing wonderful in the cow jumping 14 under "
the moon, but there is in the cow jumping "over" the moon,
so with the black-birds baked in a pie. It is the fact of
their singing when the pie was opened that pleases the
children—'twas the wonder of the thing; so with the freaks
of Mother Hubbard's Dog, etc. In nearly all nursery
thymes it is the ludicrous and wonderful that arrests
the attention and pleases.
E. W. COLE.
Frightened Boy.
There was a little boy went into a barn,
And lay down on some hay;
An owl came out, and flew about,
And the little boy ran away.
Frightened Boys.
Tweedle-dum and tweed!e-dee
Resolved to have a battle,
For tweedle-dum said tweedle-dee
Had spoiled his nice new rattle.
Just then flew by a monstrous crow,
As big as a tar-barrel,
Which frightened both theheroesso,
They quite forgot their quarrel.
Baked in a Pie.
Baby and i
Were baked in a pie,
The gravy was wonderful hot :
We had nothing to pay
To the baker that day,
And so we crept out of the pot.
Maid not at Home.
High diddle doubt, my candle’s out,
My little maid is not at home:
Saddle my hog, and bridle my dog,
And fetch my little maid home.
Dame not at Homo.
Rowsty dowt, my fire’s all out,
My little dame is not at home;
I’ll saddle my goose, and bridle my
hen,
And fetch my little damehome again;
Home she came, tritty trot;
She asked for the porridge she left
in the pot.
All in flic Dumps.
We’re all in the dumps,
For diamonds are trumps;
The kittens are gone to St. Paul’s 1
The babies are bit,
The moon’s in a fit,
And the houses are built without walls.
Hot Rolls.
Blow, wind, blow! and go, mill, go!
That the miller may grind his corn ;
That the baker may take it,
And into rolls make it,
And send us some hot in the morn.
Rosemary green,
And lavender blue,
Thyme and sweet marjoram,
Hyssop and rue.
Bed Time.
Come, let’s to bed, says Sleepy head
Tarry a while, says Slow;
Put on the pot, says Greedy-Jock,
Let’s sup before we go.
Go to Bed first.
Go to bed first,
A golden purse;
Go to bed second,
A golden pheasant;
Go to bed third,
A golden bird.


Cry-Baby Belle.
Cry-baby Belle
Is always in tears
Nothing you give her can ease her !
Sugar and spice,
And everything nice,
Kisses and cake will not please her
She’ll cry if she happens
To get a slight fall,
She’ll cry if the naughty boys tease her ;
She’ll cry for a spoon,
And she’ll cry for the moon ;
There’s no use in trying to please her
If the food set before her
Don’t happen to suit—
Oh, then just as loud as she's able,
This cry-baby Belle
Will set up a yell,
And scare all the folks at the table
If she wants to go out
In the street she will cry ;
I f she wants to come in how she screeches!
For nothing at all
She will set up and bawl,
Unmindful of comforting speeches,
She screams in the morning
Because she’s not dress’d ; [her
And at night when they want to undress
More loudly she'll roar,
And roll ever the floor
As if she had pains to distress her
She cries when she's sick,
And she cries when she's well,
And often cries when she's sleeping.
So that heavy and red,
And most out of her head
Are her eyes, on account of such weeping.
She always is fretful,
Unhappy, and cross,
No matter what she may be doing,
And cry-baby Belle
Pleases nobody well
'’Wause cf bar constant boo bou-lng
For a Naughty little Girl.
My sweet little girl should be careful and mild,
And should not be fretful, and cry !
Oh ! why is this passion ? remember, my child,
God sees you, who lives in the sky
That dear little face, which I like so to kiss,
How frightful and sad it appears 1
Do you think I can love you, so naughty as this,
Or kiss you all wetted with tears ?
Remember, tho’ God is in heaven, my love,
He sees you within and without,
And always looks down from His glory above.
To notice what you are about.
If I am not with you, or if it be dark,
And nobody is in the way,
His eye is as able your doings to mark
In the night as it is in the day
Then dry up your tears, and look smiling again
And never do things that are wrong ;
For I'm sure you must feel it a terrible pain,
To be naughty, and crying so long
Paulina Pry.
Paulina Pry
Would eat nothing but pie.
Pie was her daily diet;
Apple or plum
She must have some,
Or else she would’nt be quiet
She would not eat
Any bread or meat.
Though plenty of these were
handy,
But would pout and cry
For a piece of pie,
Or a stick of sugar-candy
They heard her cry
In the Land of Pie,
And sent her dozens and dozens,
Both tender and tough.
Till she'd more than enough
For her sisters, her aunts, and her
oonakto
Tearful Annie.
Poor little Annie, you will find,
Is very gentle, good, and kind,
But soon a fault appears.
The slightest thing will give her pain.
Her feelings she can ne’er restrain,
But gives way to her tears.
The other day when Ferdinand—
And if you search throughout the land,
No nicer boy you'll find—
Said something which he never meant
To cause the slightest discontent,
For hours she sobbed and whined.
Her fathergrieved, said: "This must cease
We never have a moment’s peace,
She cries both day and night."
A portrait painter then he paid.
To paint this little tearful maid,
Crying with all her might.
He set to work that very day,
Directly he received his pay ;
The picture soon was done.
Yes, there she was, all sobs and sighs,
Large tear-drops streaming from her eyes
" How like!” said every one.
It was in truth a great success;
Quite perfect, neither more or less;
Her father was so glad.
He hung the portrait in her room :
It filled her with the deepest gloom;
She felt annoyed and sad.
With every relative who came,
And saw the picture, 'twas the same,
All started with affright.
Uncles, and aunts, and cousins, too,
Found it so striking, life-like, true,
That soon they took to flight.
Annie not long could this endure ;
It brought about a speedy cure,
She ceased to cry and moan
Her father ceased to scold and frown.
He had the picture taken down,
And in the garret thrown.
Tearful Annie’s Likeness.
The three Cry-Babies.

Our Christmas Hamper.
Hattie’s Birthday.
Oh I this is a happy, beautiful world I
My heart is light and gay ;
The birds in the tree sing blithely tome
And I’m six years old to-day.
Yes, six, and father has bought me a
book,
And mother, the sweetest doll,
AH dressed in white, with blue eyes
bright,
And the nicest hat and shawl.
My Kitty sat quietly near the fire
As Dolly and I came by;
Miss Dolly bowed, and pussy meowed,
And opened her yellow eye.
Ah me I if Kit could only talk,
And Dolly could but chat,
We’d social be as any three—
Talk, sing, and all of that.
I dressed all up in grandma’s cap,
And put on her glasses, too ;
Why, Grandma! ” I said, as I looked
at myself,
"I’m almost as old as you."
My mother softly kissed my cheek,
And then she blessed me, too,
Praying that I, as years went by,
Might be as good and true.
My birthnight song is a merry one,
And my heart is warm and light;
Kind father, mother, and dear
grandma,
Sweet dolly and pussy, good night.
Youtli and Age.
A funny thing I heard to-day,
I might as well relate.
Our Lil is six, and little May
Still lacks a month of eight.
And, through the open play room
door,
I heard the elder say:
" Lil, run downstairs and get my
doll;
Go quick, now—right away I"
And Lillie said—(and I agreed
That May was hardly fair): —
" You might say ’please,’ or go
yourself—
I didn’t leave it there.”
"But, Lillie," urged the elder one,
"Your little legs, you know,
Are youngerer than mine are,child,
And so you ought to go 1 ’’
Children.
" I would not be a girl," said Jack.
" Because they have no fun ;
They cannot go a-fishing, nor
A-shooting with a gun;
They cannot climb up trees for fruit.
Nor bathe without a bathing dress,
Which is n'- r m at all.
" I would not be a boy," said May,
" For boys are nasty things,
With pockets filled with hooks and
knives,
And nails, and tops, and strings.
And when a boy becomes a man,
He’s got to buy girls rings ;
A Lost Child.
*' I’m losted! Could you find me, please?”
Poor little frightened baby !
The wind had tossed her golden fleece,
The stones had scratched her dimpled knees,
I stooped and lifted her with ease,
And softly whispered, " lfl¥iybe."
" Tell me your name, my little maid :
I can’t find you without it.”
" My name is Shiny-eyes,” she said,
•* Yes ; but your last name ?” She shook
her head:
Up to ray house ’ey never said
A single word about it.
“But, dear," I said, "what is your name?"
"Why, didn't you you hear me told you?"
Dust Shiny-eyes." A bright thought came:
"Yes, when you’re good. But when they
blame
Yet*, little one, —is it just the same
•Vhen mamma has to scold you ?"
" My mamma never scolds," she moans,
A little blush ensuing,
“ ’Cept when I’ve been a-frowing stones;
And then she says (the culprit owns), —
Mehitabel Sapphira Jones,
What has you been a-doing ?”
Anna E Burnham
Little Mary.
Here stands little, little Mary,
With her face of winning grace,
Chattering tongue that runs apace.
And her ways contrary
Who so gay as Mary ?
With her laugh of rippling glee
Brimming o’er with melody,—
Bonny, blithesome Mary.
Household pet is Mary—
Such a merry, joyous sprite,
Filling all our home with light—
Pretty, winsome Mary I
Mischief-loving Mary,
Busy as the busiest bee,
Full of sunshine, life, and glee
Is our heart’s sweet Mary I
Girl and Angel.
As Peter sat at Heaven’s gate
A maiden sought permission,
And begged of him. if not too late,
To give her free admissi n.
" What claim hast thou to enter here ?"
He cried with earnest mien.
" Please sir,” said she, 'twixt hope and
fear,
" I'm only just sixteen I
" Enough," the hoary guardian said,
And the gate wide open threw.
" That is the age when every maid
Is girl and angel too."
Our Country Cousin.
GIRL LAND.


NAUGHTY GIRLS.
Girl who Would’ut go to Bed.
Once I knew a little girl,
Who would'nt go to bed,
And in the morning always had
A very sleepy head.
At night she’d stop upon the stairs,
And hold the railings tight
Then with a puff she’d try to blow
Out Mary Ann’s rushlight
The bed at last they tuck'd her in,
The light she vow’d to keep ;
Left in the dark she roar’d and cried;
Till tired she went to sleep.
Little Girl that Beat her Sister.
Go, go, my naughty girl, and kiss
Your little sister dear ;
I must not have such things as this,
Nor noisy quarrels here.
What! little children scold and fight
Who ought to be so mild ;
Oh ! Mary, ' tis a shocking sight
To see an angry child.
I can’t imagine for my part,
The reason of your folly,
As if she did you any hurt
By playing with your dolly.
Children Should nol Quarrel.
Let dogs delight to bark and bight,
For God hath made them so;
Let bears and lions growl and fight;
For 'tis their nature to.
But children you should never let
Such angry passions rise ;
Your little hands were never made
To tear each other’s eyes.
The Sulky Girl.
Why is Mary standing there.
Leaning down upon a chair.
With pouting lip and frowning brow?
I wonder what’s the the matter now.
Come here, my dear, and tell me true,
Is it because I spoke to you
About what you just now had done,
That you are such a naughty one?
When, then, indeed. I’m grieved to see
That you can so ill-tempered be ;
You make your faults a great deal worse
By being sulky and perverse
Oh ! how much better it appears,
To see you melting into tears,
And then to hear you humbly say,
“I'll not do so another day !"
The Little Girl that did not Like to
be Washed.
What ! cry when I wash you ! not love to be
clean !
There, go and be dirty, unfit to be seen;
And till you leave off, and I see you have
smiled.
t'llqui take the trouble to wash suc h a child
The girl who Sucked her Fingers.
A little girl, named Mary Kate,
Whom you may chance to see,
Would have been loved by small and great.
But for one thing, which I’ll relate ;
So listen now to me.
A silly habit she'd acquired
Of putting in her mouth,
The pretty fingers of her hand,
And sucking them, for hours she’d stand,
In manner most uncouth.
Her play-companions used to laugh,
And jeeringly would say,
“Oh, pray bring Mary Kate some crumbs.
Poor thing ! she’s dining off her thumbs ;
She’ll eat them all away. ”
Girl Stealing Treacle.
This is Nelly Pilfer ;
I'll tell you what she earned,
By stealing of the treacle
When Mary's back was turned.
They caught the greedy Nelly
With treacle on her hand ;
They put her in the corner,
And there they made her stand
The Girl who soiled her Clothes.
Little Polly Flinders,
Sat among the cinders,
Warming her pretty little toes;
Her mother came and caught her,
And scolded her little daughter,
For spoiling her nice new clothes
The Greedy Little Girl.
I knew a greedy little girl,
Who all day long did roar;
Whatever toys were given her,
She always wanted more.
Five dolls she had—one was Diack,
A ball and battledore,
But held them all so very tight,
Then roar'd and scream’d for more.
Now this was wicked of the child,
As everyone must own ;
So for the whole of one long day
They shut her up alone.
The Girl Who Played With Fire.
Mamma, a little girl I met,
Had such a scar, 1 can't forget!
All down her arms and neck and face;
I could not bear to see the place.
Poor little girl! and don’t you know
The shocking trick that made her so?
’Twas all because she went and did
A thing her mother had forbid.
For once, when nobody was by her,
This silly child would play with fire;
And long before her mother came,
Here pinafore was all in flame.
In vain she tried to put it out,
Till all her clothes were burnt about;
And then she suffer’d ten times more,
All over with a dreadful sore
For many months before 1 twas cured,
Both day and night she pain endured;
And still you see, when passing by her,
How sad it is to play with fire.
Little Miss Consequence.
Little Miss Consequence strutted about,
Turned up her nose, pointed her toes,
And thought herself quite a grand person, no
doubt.
Gave herself airs ; took many cares.
To appear old ; was haughty and cold.
She spoke to the servants like to dog or to cat
And fussed about this thing, and fussed
about that.
The Vulgar Little Lady.
"But, mamma, now, " said Charlotte,
“pray, don’t you believe
That I’m better than Jenny my nurse?
Only see my red shoes, and the lace on
my sleeve;
Her clothes are a thousand times worse.
" I ride in my coach, and have nothing
to do,
And the country folks stare at me so ;
And nobody dares to control me but you,
Because I'm a lady, you know.
“ Then servants are vulgar and I am genteel;
So. really, ’ tis out of the way,
TO think that I should not be better a deal
Than maids, and such people as they.’’
‘Gentility, Charlotte,” her mother replied ;
“ Belongs to no station or place;
And nothing’s so vulgar as folly and pride.
Though dressed in red slippers and lace.
"Not all the fine things that fine ladies possess
Should teach them the poor to despise ;
For'tis in good manners, and not in good
dress,
That the truest gentility lies '


Girl wouldn’t he Dressed.
Girl in Disgrace—Her Dog is sorry.
Peggy’s Won’t.
"I won’t be dressed. I won't, I won't! ”
Cried Peggy one morn to mamma.
” Very well, dear," was quietly said,
" I'll teach you how silly you are."
Peggv then frowned and set her lips
Expecting a kiss as of old.
But mother had gravely walked away,
And Peggy was getting so cold
The minutes passed, and Peggy sighed.
For thoughts of her breakfast arose,
And "Mammy, dear," she loudly wept,
While stamping her bare little toes.
Then mother came, and firmly said,
"Pm taking you, dear, at your word;
" I won't be dressed—l won’t,l won’t!’
Has many times lately been heard
"So now to bed, my little maid,
For you will not be dressed to-day;
Then Peggy will be tauglu to think
Before acting in such a way ’’
Oh, for the tears that Peggy shed 1
But now every morn, I am told.
A wee young maid is quietly dressed,
And is always as good as gold
The Shadows.
" Mamma! I see something
Quite dark on the wall; —
It moves up and down,
And it looks very strange I
Sometimes it is large.
And sometimes it is ?mall:
Pray, tell me what it ij,
And why does it change?"
" It is Mamma’s shadow
That puzzles you so.
And there is your own
Close beside it, my lovel
Now run round the room,
It will go where you go;
It rests where you sit.
When you rise it will move
" These wonderful shadows
Are caused by the light
From fire and from candles
Upon us that falls;
If we were not here,
All that place would be bright.
But light can't shine
Through us to lighten the walls
" And when you are out
Some fine day in the sun,
I'll take you where shadows
Of apple-trees lie;
And houses and cottages too —
Every one
Repose on their shadows
Beneath the bright sky
" Now hold up your mouth
And give me a sweet kiss,
Our shadows kiss tool—
Don't you see it quite plain?"
"O yes! and I thank you
For telling me this.
I’ll not be afraid
Of a shadow again "

Little 80-Peep.
Little 80-Peep has lost her sheep,
And can’t tell where to find them ;
Leave them alone, and they’ll come home
And bring their tails behind them.
Little 80-Peep fell fast asleep,
And dreamed she heard them bleating,
But when she awoke, ’twas all joke —
Alas ! they still were fleeting.
Then up she took her little crook,
Determined for to find them;
She found them, indeed, but it made her
heart bleed,
They’d left their tails behind them.
It happened one day, as 80-Peep did stray
Over the meadows hard by,
That there she espied their tails side by side,
All hung on a tree to dry.
She heaved a sigh, and gave by-and-by
Each careless sheep a banging ;
And as for the rest she thought it was best
dust to leave their tails a-hanging.
Mary’s Little Lamb.
Mary had a little lamb

She ate it every bit.

Pemmy would sing all day long,
But Fanny would not let her.
Little Husband.
I had a little husband,
No bigger than my thumb;
I put him in a pint pot,
' And there I bid him drum.
I bought a little horse,
That galloped up and down;

And sent him out of town
I gave him some garters,
To garter up his hose,
And a little handkerchief,
To wipe his pretty nose.

GIRL


Meddlesome Matty.
One ugly trick has often spoiled
The sweetest and the best ;
Matilda, though a pleasant child,
One ugly trick possessed,
Which, like a cloud before the skies,
Hid all her better qualities
Sometimes she'd lift the teapot lid
To peep at what was in it;
Or tilt the kettle, if you did
But turn your back a minute
In vain you told her not to touch—
Her trick of meddling grew so much
Her grandmamma went out one day,
And by mistake she laid
Her spectacles and snuff-box gay
Too near the little maid;
" Ah I well,” thought she, "I'll try them on
As soon as grandmamma is gone, "
Forthwith she placed upon her nose
The glasses large and wide ;
And looking round, as 1 suppose,
The snuff box too she spied :
"Oh! what a pretty box is that;
I'll open it," said little Matt.
"I know grandmamma would say,
‘Don’t meddle with it, dear;'
But then she's far enough away,
And no one else is near;
Besides, what can there be amiss
In opening such a box as this?"
So thumb and Anger went to work
To move the stubborn lid ;
And presently a mighty jerk
The mighty mischief did;
For all at once, ah ! woeful case,
The snuff came puffing in her face
Poor eyes, and nose, and mouth beside,
A dismal sight presented;
In vain, as bitterly she cried,
Her folly she repented
In vain she ran about for ease;
She could do nothing now but sneeze
She dashed the spectacles away,
To wipe her tingling eyes;
And as in twenty bits they lay,
Her grandmamma she spies
"Heyday! and what’s the matter now?"
Says grandmamma, with lifted brow
Matilda, smarting with the pain,
And tingling still and sore,
Made many a promise to refrain
From meddling evermore
And 'tis a fact, as I have heard,
She ever since has kept her word
The Girl who Spilled the Ink.
"Oh! Lucy! Fanny! Make haste here!
Mamma will be so vexed. I fear,
For I've upset the ink !
See, on my frock and pinafore,
Such great black stains ! And there are more
Upon my socks, I think "
And Lucy cries, with open eyes,
And hands extended in surprise.
"Oh, naughty Mary Ann,
Those stains can never be washed out;
Whatever have you been about ?
Look at her, sister Fan!"
Mamma comes in : " Heyday! what's this ?
Why, Mary Ann, I told you, Miss,
The inkstand ne'er to move;
And little girls who won’t obey,
And mind each word their parents say.
Good people ne’er will love "
The Naughty Girl.
A naughty girl had got no toy,
And didn’t know what to do,
So she rumpled her frock,
And ‘ore her sock.
And tried to eai her shoe
The Girl who was Always Tasting.
Little Miss Baster, of Sunnyside,
Was known as a taster, far and wide ;
Picking and licking, spying and prying.
Each bottle and dish with her fingers trying
Dangerous practice! dreadful the fact is!
Once almost poisoned, and very near dying

Has got at some poison in paper tied ;
Harmless she deems it. yes, she must taste,

Dreadful her anguish—nearly she died,

Children Stealing Jam.
Four naughty little children thought
Some jam they'd try and steal;
But see how nicely they were caught
With a crash that made them squeal.
Their mother, who was just next door,
And heard the horrid noise,
Came in and shook those naughty girls,
And whipped those naughty boys
Sally, the Lazy Girl.
Her sister would come to the bedside and call,
** Do you mean to sleep here all the day ?
I saw Kitty Miles up two hours ago,
A washing and working away.
"The water is boiling, the table is spread,
Your father is just at the door;
If you are not quick, we shall eat all the bread,
And you will not find "
Then Sally sat op and halt Opened her eyea,
And gave both a grunt and a groan ;
And, yawning she said, in a quarrelsome voice,
"I wish you would let me alone."
But though she was lazy, she always could eat,
And wished for a plentiful share,
So tumbled her clothes on, and smeared her
white face,
Forgetting her hands and her hair.
Her frock was all crumpled and twisted
away,
Her hair was entangled and wild,
Her stockings were down and her shoes were
untied,
She looked a most slovenly child.
She sauntered about till the old village clock
Had sounded and then died away,
Before she put on her torn bonnet and went
To school without further delay.
But soon as she came to the little cake shop,
She loitered with lingering eyes,
Just wishing that she had a penny to spend,
For one of the pretty jam pies.
Again she went on, and she loitered again
In the same foolish way as before,
And the clock in the school was just warn-
ing for ten,
As she lifted the latch of the door.
The governess frowned as she went to her
place,
She had spoken so often in vain,
And now only said, with a sorrowful sigh,
"There’s Sally the latest again! ”
She hated her reading, and never would
write,
She neither could cypher nor sew, [be
And little girls whispered, "We never will
So silly as Miss Sally Slow. "
Girl who Wouldn’t Comb her
Hair.
I tell you of a little girl, who would herself
have been,
As pretty a young lady as ever could be
seen,
But that about her little head she had no
cleanly care
And never, never could be made to brush
and comb her hair.
She would have been a pretty child,
But, oh ! she was a fright—
She looked just like a girl that's wild,
Yes. quite as ugly, quite;
She looked just like a girl that’s wild—
A frightful ugly sight.
The Nasty, Cross Girls.
The school was closed one afternoon,
And all the girls were gone;
Some walked away in company,
And some walked on alone
Some plucked the flowers upon the banks,
Some chattered very fast,
And some were talking secretly,
And whispered as you passed.
And if, perchance, a girl came near,
Then one of these would say,
" Don't listen to our secrets, Miss,
You'll please to go away.
As Nelly White ran home from school.
Her work bag in her hand,
She chanced to pass near Lucy Bell,
And her friend. Susan Brand.
"We don't want you," said Lucy Bell,
" You little tiresome chit;
Our secrets are not meant for you,
You little tell-tale-tit."
Then both the girls cried, "Tell-tale-tit,"
And pushed her roughly by;
Poor Nelly said, "I'm no such thing, "

GIRLS’ STORIES.
LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.
Once upon a time there was a dear little girl,
whose mother made her a scarlet cloak with a
hood to tie over her pretty head ; so people
called her (as a pet name) “ Little Red Riding-
Hood.” One day her mother tied on her cloak
and hood, and said,
" I wish you to go to-day. my darling, to see
your grandmamma, and take her a present of
some butter, fresh eggs, a. pot of honey, and a
little cake, with my love.”
Little Red Riding-Hood loved her grand-
mother, and was very glad to go. So she ran
gaily through the wood, gathering the wild
flowers and gambolling among the ferns as she
went; and the birds all sang their sweetest songs
to her, and the bluebells nodded their pretty
heads, for everything loved the gentle child.
By and by a great hungry Wolf came up to
her, He wished to eat her up, but as he heard
the woodman Hugh’s axe at work close by, he
was afraid to touch Her, for fear she should cry
out and he should get killed. So he only asked
her where she was going. Little Red Riding-
Hood innocently told him (for she did not know
he was a wicked Wolf) that she was going
to visit her grandmother, who lived in a
cottage on the other side of the wood.
Then the Wolf made haste, and ran
through the wood, and came to the cot-
tage of which the child had told him.
He tapped at the door.
“ Who's there?” asked the old woman,
who lay sick in bed.
“ It is Little Red Riding-Hood, Grand-
mamma,” answered the Wolf in a squeaky
tone, to imitate the voice of her grand-
child.
“ Pull the string, and the latch will
come up,” said the old lady, "for I am
ill, and cannot open the door.”
The cruel Wolf did so, and, jumping on
the bed, ate the poor grandmother up.
Then he put on her night-cap and got
into bed. By and by Little Red Riding-
Hood, who had lingered gathering flowers
as she came along, and so was much later
than the Wolf, knocked at the door.
“ Who’s there? ” asked the Wolf, mim-
icking her grandmother’s voice.
"It is Little Red Riding-Hood, dear
Grandmamma,” said the child.
" Pull the string and the latch will
come up,” said the Wolf.
So Red Riding-Hood came in, and the
Wolf told her to put down her basket,
and come and sit on the bed. When
Little Red Riding-Hood drew back the
curtain and saw the Wolf, she began to
be rather frightened, and said,
•* Dear Grandmamma, what great eyes
you have got 1 ”
“ All the better to see with, my dear," said
the Wolf, who liked a grim joke.
“ And what a large nose you have, Grand-
mamma!” cried the child.
“ All the better to smell with, my dear.
"And, oh I Grandmamma, what long white
teeth you have. I ”
Alas I she reminded the greedy Wolf of eating.
" All the better to eat you with I” he growled;
and, jumping out of bed, sprang at Red Riding
Hood.
But just at that moment Hugh the woodman,
who had seen the sweet child go by. and had
followed her, because he knew there was a Wolf
prowling about the forest, burst the door open,
and killed the wicked animal with his good axe.
Little Red Riding-Hood clung round his neck,
and thanked him, and cried for joy ; and Hugh
took her b'-ma to her mother ; and after that
she was never allowed to walk in the greenwood
!)v her* If
It was said at first that the Wolf had eaten
the child, but that was not the case; and every-
body was glad to near that the first report was
not correct, and that the Wolf had not really
killed Little Red-Riding Hood.

THE BABES IN THE WOOD.
A long time ago there lived in an old mansion
in the country a rich gentleman and his wife,
who had two dear little children, of whom they
were verv fond. Sad to relate, the gentleman
and lady were both taken ill, and, feeling
they were about to die, sent for the uncle of the
children, and begged him to take care of them
till they were old enough to inherit the estates.
Now this uncle was a bad and cruel man, who
wanted to take the house, the estates, and the
money for himself, —so after the death of the
parents he began to think how he could best get
rid of the children. For some time he kept
them till he claimed for them all the goods that
should have been theirs. At last he sent for
two robbers, who had once been his companions,
and showing them the boy and girl, who were at
play, offered them a large sum of money to carry
them away and never let him see them more.
One of the two robbers began coaxing the
little boy and girl, and asking them if they
would not like to go out for a nice ride in the
woods, each of them on a big horse. The boy
said he should, if his sister might go too, and
the girl said she should not be afraid if
her brother went with her. So the two
robbers enticed them away from the
house, and. mounting their horses, went
off into the woods, much to the delight
of the children, who were pleased with
the great trees, the bright flowers, and
the singing of the birds.
Now, one of these men was not so bad
and cruel as the other, and he would not
consent to kill the poor little creatures,
as the other threatened he would do. He
said that they should be left in the woods
to stray about, and perhaps they might
then escape. This led to a great quarrel
between the two, and at last the cruel
one jumped off his horse, saying he would
kill them, let who would stand in the
way. Upon this the other drew his
sword to protect the children, and after a
fierce fight succeeded in killing his com-
panion.
But though he had saved them from
being murdered, he was afraid to take
them back or to convey them out of the
wood, so he pointed out a path, telling
them to walk straight on and he would
come back to them when he had bought
some bread for their supper ; he rode
away and left them there all alone, with
only the trees, and birds, and flowers,
They loved each other so dearly, and
were so bold and happy, that they were
not much afraid though they were both
very hungry.
The two children soon got out of the
path, which led into the thickest part
of the wood, and then they wandered farther
and fart' r into the thicket till they were both
sadly tired, but they found some wild berries,
nuts, and fruits, and began to eat them to satisfy
their hunger, The dark night came on and the
robber did not return. They were cold, and
still very hungry, and the boy went about look-
ing for fresh fruit for his sister, and tried to
comfort her as they lay down to sleep on the
soft moss under the trees.
The next day, and the next, they roamed
about, but there was nothing to eat but wild
fruits ; and they lived on them till they grew so
weak that they could not go far from the tree
where they had made a little bed of grass aud
weeds & There they laid down a» tbs shades of

CINDERELLA.
Cinderella’s mother died while she was a
very little child, leaving her to the care of her
father and her step-sisters, who were very much
older than herself; for Cinderella’s father had
been twice married, and her mother was his
second wife. Now, Cinderella’s sisters did not
love her, and were very unkind to her. As she
grew older they made her work as a servant,
and even sift the cinders: on which account
they used to call her in mockery " Cinderella."
It was not her real name, but she became after-
wards so well known by it that her proper one
has been forgotten.
She was a sweet tempered, good girl, however,
and everybody except her cruel sisters loved her.
It happened, w hen Cinderella was about seven-
teen years old, that the King of that country gave
a ball, to which all the ladies of the land, and
among the rest the young girl’s sisters were
invited. So they made her dress them for this
ball, but never thought of allowing her to go.
" I wish you would take me to the ball with
you, sisters," said Cinderella, meekly.
"Take you, indeed!" answered the elder
sister, with a sneer ; " it is no place for a cinder-
sifter; stay at home and do your work ”
When they were gone, Cinderella, whose
heart was sad, sat down and cried; but as she
sat sorrowful, thinking of the unkindness of
her sisters, a voice called to her from the
garden, and she went to see who was there.
It was her godmother, a good old Fairy.
" Do not cry, Cinderella,” she said ; “you
also shall go to the ball, because you are a
kind, good girl. Bring mea large pumpkin."
Cinderella obeyed, and the Fairy, touch-
ing it with her wand, turned it into a grand
coach. Then she turned a rat into a coach-
man. and some mice into footmen; and
touching Cinderella with her wand, the poor
girl's rags became a rich dress trimmed with
costly lace and jewels, and her old shoes
became a charming pair of glass slippers,
which looked like diamonds. The Fairy
told her to go to the ball and enjoy herself,
but to be sure and leave the ball-room
before the clock struck eleven.
“If you do not," she said, "your fine
clothes will all turn to rags again."
So Cinderella got into the coach, and
drove off with her six footmen behind, very
splendid to behold, and arrived at the
King’s Court, where she was received with
delight. She was the most beautiful young
lady at the ball, and the Prince would
dance with no one else. But she made haste to
leave a little before the hour fixed, and had
time to undress before her sisters came home.
They told her a beautiful Princess had been at
the ball, with whom the Prince was delighted.
They did not know it was Cinderella herself.
Three times Cinderella went to royal balls in
this manner, but the third time «he forgot the
Fairy’s command, and heard eleven o'clock
strike. She darted out of the ball-room and
ran down stairs in a great hurry But her dress
all turned to rags before she left the palace, and
she lost one of her glass slippers The Prince
sought for her everywhere, but the guard said
no one had passed the gate but a poor beggar
girl. However, the Prince found the slipper,
and in order to discover where Cinderella was
gone, he had it proclaimed that he would marry
the lady who could put on the glass slipper
All the ladies tried to wear the slipper in vain,
Cinderella’s sisters also; but when their young
sister begged to be allowed to try it also, it was
found to fit her exactly; and to the Prince’s
delight, she drew the fellow slipper from her
pocket, and he knew at once that she was his
beautiful partner at the ball. So she was married
to the Prince, and the children strewed roses in
their path as they came out of church.
Cinderella forgave her sisters, and was so kind to
them that she made them truly sorry for their past
cruelty and injustice.
THE THREE DEARS.
Once upon a time three bears lived in a nice little
house in a great forest.
There was Father Bear, Mother Bear, and Baby Bear.
They had each a bed to sleep in, a chair to sit on,
and a basin and a spoon for eating porridge, which
was their favourite food.
One morning the three bears went to take a walk
before breakfast; but before they went out they
poured the hot porridge into their basins, that it might
get cool by the time they came back Mr and Mrs
Bear walked arm-in-arm, and Baby Bear ran by their
side. Now. there lived in the same forest a sweet little
girl who was called Golden Hair. She, also, was
walking that morning in the wood, and happening to
pass by the bear’s house, and seeing the window open,
she peeped in There was no one to be seen ; but
three basins of steaming hot porridge, all ready to be
eaten, seemed to say: " Come in and have some
breakfast ’’ So Golden Hair went in and tasted the
porridge in all the basins ; then she sat down in Baby
Bear’s Chair, and took up his spoon, and ate up all his
porridge. Now this was very wrong. A tiny bear is
only a tiny bear, still he has a right to keep his own
things. But Golden Hair did not know any better
Unluckily, Baby Bear's Chair was too small for her,
and she broke the seat and fell through, basin and all.
Then Golden Hair went upstairs, and there she saw
three beds all in a row. Golden Hair lay down on
Father Bear’s bed first, but that was too long for her
then she laydown on Mother Bear’s bed. and that was
too wide for her; last of all she lay down on Baby
Bear’s bed, and there she fell asleep, for she was tired
By-and-by the bears came home, and Old Father
Bear looked at his chair, and growled :
" Somebody has been here I"
Mother Bear growled more softly :
" Somebody has been here ! "
Baby Bear, seeing his chair broken, squeeled out :
" Somebody has been here, and broken my chair
right through ! ”
Then they went to the table, and looked at their
porridge, and Father Bear growled :
“ Who has touched my basin ? ”
And Mother Bear growled :
" Who has touched my basin ? "
And Baby Bear squeaked;
“ Somebody has broken mine, and ate up all
my porridge I ”
They went upstairs, and Father Bear growled :
" Who has been lying on my bed ? ”
And Mother Bear growled :
“ Who has been lying on my bed ? "
And Baby Bear squeaked out:
"O! here is a little girl in my bed ; and it
must be she who has eaten my breakfast and
broken my chair and basin ! ”
Then Father Bear growled ;
'• Let us eat her up I "
And Mother Bear growled :
" Let us eat her up I "
And Tiny Bear squeaked :
** Let us eat her up! ”
But the noise they made awoke Golden Hair;
she started out of bed (on the opposite side)
and jumped out of the window. The three
bears all jumped out after her, but they fell one
on the top of the other, and rolled over and
over, and while they were picking themselves
up, little Golden Hair ran home, and they
were not able to catch her.
BLUEBEARD.
Once there lived in a lovely castle a very
rich man called Bluebeard. A short dis-
tance off lived an old gentleman, with two
lovely daughters, named Fatima and Annie.
Bluebeard visited at their house, and at
length proposed to Fatima, was accepted
by her. and they were married with great
splendour. He took her home with him to
his castle, and permitted her sister Annie
to reside with her for company for a time.
She lived very happily in her new home;
her husband was very kind to her, and
allowed her to have everything she wished
for; but one day he suddenly told her that
business called him away from home, that
he should be away some days, and handed
her the keys of his wardrobe, treasures, and
all parts of his castle; he also gave her one
key of a small closet, and told her that she
might unlock every door in the castle, but
not this closet door, for if she did so, she
should not live an hour longer. He then
left home, fondly kissing her at the door;
her sister and herself returned into the
castle, and enjoyed themselves in unlocking
room after room, looking over the curios-
ities, treasures, &c., until Annie became tired
and lay down to rest on a rich sofa, and fell
asleep. Fatima, as soon as she saw that her
sister was asleep, felt a womanly curiosity, an
irresistible temptation to unlock the forbidden
closet, and take a peep. She tripped lightly up
to the door, turned the key in the lock, pushed
the door open. and. oh! horror! there were five
or six dead ladies lying in the closet, with their
marriage rings on their fingers. She at once
concluded that they were Bluebeard’s previous
wives : she let the key drop in her fright into the
blood on the floor ; she picked it up and
attempted to wipe it, but the blood would not
come off She woke her sister, and they both
tried, but they could not get it off, and gave it up
in despair. Just then Bluebeard suddenly
returned, and asked his wife if she would please
to hand him the keys. She tremblingly did so
He said," How came the blood on the closet key ?
You have disobeyed me, and shall die at once "
She begged a few minutes to say her prayers :
and just as he was going to chop her head off.
her two brothers arrived at the castle, burst
open the door, killed the cruel wretch, and
rescued their sisters
GrlJE£J_i LAND,


My Girl.
A little corner with its crib,
A little mug, a spoon, a bib,
A little tooth so pearly white,
A little rubber-ring to bite.
A little plate all lettered round,
A little rattle to resound.
A little creeping—seel she stands!
A little step ’twixt outstretched
hands.
A little doll with flaxen hair,
A little willow rocking-chair,
A little dress of richest hue.
A little pair of gaiters blue.
A little school day after day,
A little “schoolma’am” to obey,
A little study—soon ’tis past —
A little graduate at last.
A little muff for wintry weather,
A little jockey-hat and feather,
A little sac with funny pockets,
A little chain, a ring, and lockets.
A little while to dance and bow,
A little escort homeward now,
A little party somewhat late,
A little lingering at the gate.
A little walk in leafy June,
A little talk while shines the moon,
A little reference to papa,
A little planning with mamma.
A little ceremony grave,
A little struggle to be brave,
A little cottage on the lawn,
A little kiss—my girl was gone I
Good and 15ad.
There was a little girl,
And she had a little curl
Right in the middle of her forehead
When she was good
She was very good,
But when she was bad she wa*. horrid I
My Little Daughter’s Shoes.
Two little rough-worn, stubbed shoes
A plump, well-trodden pair;
With striped stockings thrust within,
Lie just beside my chair.
Of very homely fabric they,
A hole is in each toe, [new,
They might have cost, when they were
Some fifty cents or so,
And yet this little, worn-out pair
Is richer far to me
Than all the jewelled sandals are
Of Eastern luxury.
This mottled leather,cracked with use,
Is satin in my sight ;
These little tarnished buttons shine
With all a diamond’s light.
Search through the wardrobe of the
world I
You shall not find me there
So rarely made, so richly wrought,
So glorious' a pair,
And why ? Because they tell of her,
Now sound asleep above,
Whose form is moving beauty, and
Whose heart is beating love
They tell me of her merry laugh ;
Her rich, whole-hearted glee ;
Her gentleness, her innocence,
And infant purity.
They tell me that her wavering steps
Will long demand my aid ;
For the old road of human life
Is very roughly laid.
High hills and swift descents abound;
And, on so rude a way,
Feet that can wear these coverings
Would surely go astray.
Sweet little girl! be mine the task
Thy feeble steps to tend !
To be thy guide, thy counsellor,
Thy playmate and thy friend 1
And when my steps shall faltering
grow,
And thine be firm and strong.
Thy strength shall lead my tottering

The old Cradle.
And this was your cradle ?
Why, surely, my Jenny,
Such slender dimensions
Go somewhat to show
You were a delightfully
Small picaninny
Some nineteen or twenty
Short summers ago.
Your baby-day flowed [nel;
In a much troubled chan-
I see you as then
In your impotent strife,
A tight little bundle
Of wailing and flannel,
Perplexed with that [Life,
Newly-found fardel called
To hint at an infantine
Frailty is scandal;
Let bygones be bygones —
And somebody knows
It was bliss such a baby
To dance and to dandle,
Your cheeks were so velvet,
So rosy your toes.
Ay, here is your cradle,
And Hope, a bright spirit,
With love now is watching
Beside it, I know.
They guard the small nest
You yourself did inherit
Some nineteen or twenty
Short summers ago.
It is Hope gilds the future—
Love welcomes it smiling;
Thus wags this old world,
Therefore stay not to ask,
" My future bids fair,
Is my future beguiling?”
If masked, still it pleases—
Then raise not the mask.
Is life a poor coil [doffing?
Some would gladly be
He is riding post-haste
Who their wrongs will
adjust;
For at most 'tis a footstep
From cradle to coffin—
From a spoonful of pap
To a mouthful of dust.
Then smile as your future
Is smiling, my Jenny 1
Tho’ blossoms of promise
Are lost in the rose,
I still see the face
Of my small picaninny
Unchang’d, for these cheeks
Are as blooming as those.
Ay, here is your cradle !
Much, much to my liking,
Though nineteen or twenty
Long winters have sped ;
But, hark ! as I’m talking
There’s six o'clock strik-
ing.
It is time Jennie’s baby
Should be in its bed
Locr**
A Little Goose.
The chill November day was done,
The working world home fa ring,
The w nd came roaring through the
streets,
And set the gas lamps flaring.
And hopelessly and aimlessly
The seared old leaves were flying,
When, mingled with the sighing wind,
I heard a small voice crying.
And shivering on the corner stood
A child of four or over ;
No hat nor cloak her small soft arms
Or wind-blown curls to cover.
Her dimpled face was stained with
tears;
Her round blue eyes ran over ;
She crushed within her wee, cold
hands
A bunch of faded clover.
And one hand round her treasures,
While she slipped in mine the other,
Half-scared, half-confidential, said
"Oh! please. I want my mother."
"Tell me your street and number, pet;
Don’t cry, I’ll take you to it,’’
Sobbing, she answered, “ I forget—
The organ made me do it.”
* 'He came and played at Miller’s steps,
The monkey took the money;
And so 1 followed down the street,
That monkey was so funny.
I've walked about a hundred hours,
From one street to another ;
The monkey’s gone ; I’ve spoiled my
flowers:
Oh ! please. I want my mother.”
"But what’s your mother’s name?
And what’s the street? now think
a minute."
"My mother’s name is mamma dear,
The street—l can't begin it”
"But what is strange about the house,
Or new—not like the others? ”
I guess you mean my trundle bed—
Mine and my little brother s.
Oh 1 dear, I ought to be at home,
To help him say his prayers ;
He’s such a baby, he forgets,
And we are both such players.
"And there’s a bar between, to keep
From pitching on each other ;
For Harry rolls when he’s asleep—
Oh ! dear, I want my mother."
The sky grew stormy, people passed,
All muffled, homeward faring ;
You'll have to spend the night with
me,"
I said at last, despairing.
I spied a ribbon round her neck.
"What ribbon’s this, my blossom ?”
"Why, don't you know?" she smiling
asked,
And drew it from her bosom.
A card with number, street, and namel
My eyes, astonished, met it.
" For," said the little one, " you see
I might some time forget it.
And so I wear a little thing
That tells you all about it;
For mother says she’s very sure
I might get lost without it."

The Playmates.

There’s the pretty girl,
And the witty girl,
And the girl that bangs her hair ;
The girl that’s a flirt,
And the girl that is pert,
And the girl with the baby stare,
There’s the dowdy girl,
And the rowdy girl,
And the girl that is always late;

And the girl of wile,
And the girl with the mincing gaits
There’s the tender girl,
And the slender girl,
And the girl that says her prayers;
There’s the haughty girl,
And the naughty girl,
And the girl that puts on airs.
There’s the well-bred girl,
And the well-read girl,
And the girl with the sense of duty
There's the dainty girl,
And the fainty girl,
And the girl that has no beauty
There’s the lazy girl,
And the daisy girl,
And the girl that has two faces;
There’s the girl that’s shy,
And the girl that’s fly

There are girls and girls,
Yet they’re all of them pearls,

Girls’ Names.
There is a strange deformity
Combined with countless graces,
As often in the ladies’ names,
As in the ladies’ faces ;
Some names are fit for every age.
Some only fit for youth ;
Some passing sweet and musical,
Some horribly uncouth;
Some fit for dames of loftiest grades,
Some only fit for scullery maids
Ann is too plain and common,
And Nancy sounds but ill;
Yet Anna is endurable,
And Annie better still,
There is a grace in Charlotte,
In Eleanor a state,
An elegance in Isabel,
A haughtiness in Kate,
And Sarah is sedate and neat.
And Ellen innocent and sweet
Matilda has a sickly sound.
Fit for a nurse’s trade;
Sophie is effeminate,
And Esther sage and staid ;
Elizabeth's a matchless name.
Fit for a queen to wear
In castle, cottage, hut, or hall—
A name beyond compare ;
And Bess, and Bessie follow well,
But Betsy is detestable.
Maria is too forward,
And Gertrude is too gruff,
Yet, coupled with a pretty face,
Is pretty name enough ;
And Adelaide is fanciful,
And Laura is too fine,
But Emily is beautiful,
And Mary is divine
Maud only suits a high born dame.
And Fanny is a baby name
Eliza is not very choice,
Jane is too blunt and bold,
. And Martha somewhat sorrowful,
And Lucy proud and cold ;
Amelia is too light and gay.
Fit only for a flirt;
And Caroline is vain and shy,
And Flora smart and pert;
Louisa is too soft and sleek
But Alice—gentle, chaste, and meek.
And Harriet is confiding.
And Clara grave and mild.
And Emma is affectionate,
And Janet arch and wild I
And Patience is expressive,
And Grace is cold and rare.
And Dannah warm and dutiful,
And Margaret frank and fair,
And Faith, and Hope, and Charity
Are heavenly names for sisters three
Sarah.
Oh, Sarah mine, hark to my song
Your slumbers soft invading
For here beneath your window-sill
I come a-Sarah-nading.
You know my fond heart beats for you
In tenderest adoration,
And then, you know. I long to have
You be my own Sal vation
The day's not far when you'll be
mine -
The thought makes my soul merry.
You'll be the pride of all my life.
But not my adver-Sarey
The tender fates shall crown your lot,
And sweet contentment parcel ;
And while you're just the world to me.
Love will be univer-Sal.
With bridal altar draped with flowers
And everything so tony,
In crowded church we will be wed
With lots of Sarah-money
There's nothing I'll not do for you
Till life comes to an end, dear ;
I'd brave the battles of the world
And fight a Sara cen, dear.
I must to sleep, Sal, soda you,
For here I must not dally,
For that bull dog, I hear, like me,
Is bound to have a Sally.

Juinping-Jeimie.
Jennie had a jumping-rope
As slender as a whip,
And all about the street and house
She’d skip, and skip, and skip.
She knocked the vases from the shelf,
Upset the stools and chairs,
And one unlucky day, alas !
Went headlong down the stairs.
Against the wall, against the door
Her head she often bumped,
And stumbled here, and stumbled
there.
Yet still she jumped, and jumped
She jumped so high, she jumped so
hard,
That—so the story goes—
She wore her shoes and stockings out,
Likewise her heels and toes.
1 don’t Care.
Matilda was a pretty girl.
And she had flaxen hair :
And yet she used those naughty words
" I'm sure I do not care."
She once her lessons would not learn,
But talk'd about the fair,
And lost her tickets, but she said.
•• I'm sure I do not care."
As she advanced to riper years,
I’m sorry to declare [words
She still preserved those naughty
" I’m sure I do not care.”
She grew a woman, and for life
'Twas time she should prepare,
But still shesaid "there’s timtenough,
If not. I do not care."
Duties neglected, warnings spurn'd.
Her mother in despair;
And though she saw the evil done.
She said, " I do not care,"
Still on she went from bad to worse,
She spurned her father’s prayer;
Who feared she’d find an awful end,
Because she would not care
Afflictions came, and death in view.
Which filled her with despair ;
Her God neglected, and she feared
For her He would not care.
Could you have then Matilda seen,
Or heard her broken prayer,
She urged her friends never to use
Those awful words— Don't cart.
Little Miss Meddlesome.
Little Miss Meddlesome
Scattering crumbs,
Into the library
Noisily comes —
Twirls off her apron.
Tilts open some books,
And into a work-basket
Rummaging, looks.
Out goes the spools spinning
Over the floor,
Beeswax and needle-case
Stepped out before ;
She tosses the tape-rule
And plays with the floss.
And says to herself,
“ Now, won’t mamma be
cross!”
Little Miss Meddlesome
Climbs to the shelf,
Since no one is looking,
And, mischievous elf,
Pulls down the fine vases,
The cuckoo-clock stops,
And sprinkles the carpet
With damaging drops
She turns over the ottoman,
Frightens the bird,
And sees that the chairs
In a medley are stirred ;
Then creeps on the sofa,
And. all in a heap,
Drops out of her
Frolicsome mischief asleep
But here comes the nurse,
Who is shaking her head,
And frowns at the mischief
Asleep on her bed.
But let’s hope when Miss
Meddlesome's
Slumber is o'er,
She may wake from good
dreams
And do mischief no more.
Careless Matilda.
“Again, Matilda.
Is your work astray,
Your thimble gone !
Your scissors, where are they?
Your needles, pins, your thread,
And tapes all lost —
Your housewife here,
And there your work-bag tost.
Fie, fie, my child!
Indeed this will not do,
Your hair uncomb’d,
Your frock in tatters too;
I’m now resolv’d
No more delays to grant,
This day I’ll send you
To your stern old aunt,"
In vain Matilda wept.
Repented, pray'd,
In vain a promise
Of amendment made
Arriv’d at Austere Hall,
Matilda sigh’d,
By Lady Rigid.
When severely eyed;
“You read, and write,
And work well, as I’m told,
Are gentle, kind good-natur d,
Far from bold:
But very careless,
Negligent, and wild—
When you leave me,
You’ll be a different child."
The little girl
Next morn a favour asks
“ I wish to take a walk ’’
“Go learn your tasks."
The lady harsh replies,
“ Nor cry nor whine ;
Your room you leave not
Till you’re call'd to dine."
As thus Matilda sat,
O'erwhelm’d with shame,
A dame appear’d,
Disorder was her name
Her hair and dress neglected,
Soil’d her face,
She squinted, leer'd.
And hobbled in her pace
“Here, child," she said,
“My mistress sends you this,
A bag of silks —
A flow’r not work'd amiss—
A polyanthus bright.
And wondrous gay;
You’ll copy it by noon,
She bade me say."
Disorder grinn’d,
Then shuffling walk’d away
Entangled were
The silks of every hue,
Confus’d and mix'd
Wereshadesof pink, green, blue ;
She took a thread,
Compar’d it with the flow’r:
“To finish this is
Not within my pow'r
Well-sorted silks
Had Lady Rigid sent,
I might have work’d,
If such was her intent."
She sigh’d, and melted
Into sobs and tears,
She hears a noise,
And at the door appears
A pretty maiden,clean,
Well-dress’d, and neat,
Her voice was soft,
Her looks sedate, yet sweet
“ My name is Order ;
Do not cry, my love ;
Attend to me,
And thus you may improve.”
She took the silks,
And drew out shade by shade,
In sep'rate skeins,
Each hue with care she laid;
Then smiling kindly
Left the little maid.
Matilda now resumes
Her sweet employ,
And sees the flow’r complete—
How great her joy!
She leaves the room—
" I’ve done my task.” she cries
But soon her harshness
The lady look’d
With disbelieving eyes,
Chang’d to glad surprise
"Why, this is well 1
A very pretty flow’r.
Work’d clean, exact,
And done within the hour I
Aud now amuse yourself.
Ride, walk, or play.”
Thus passed Matilda
This much-dreaded day
At all her tasks
Disorder would attend.
At all her tasks
Still Order stood her friend
With tears and sighs
Her studies oft began,
These into smiles
Were changed by Order s plan
No longer Lady Rigid
Seem’d severe,
Her looks the negligent
Alone need fear.
And when the day
The wish’d-for day, is come,
When young Matilda's
Suffer’d to go home ;
" You quit me, child,
But oft to mind recall
The time you spent
With me at Austere Hall.
And now, my dear.
I’ll give you one of these,
Your servant she will be—
Take which you please.”
" From me,” Disorder ask’d,
" Old friend, why start ?”
Matilda clasped
Sweet Order to her heart;
" My dearest girl,” she said.
" We’ll never part.”

Tangle Pate.
There was a girl, named Tanglepate,
She lived—l won’t say where —
Who was not willing any one
Should comb or curl her hair.
She cried and made a dreadful fuss,
At morning, noon, or night,
And did not seem at all ashamed
Of looking like a fright
Her hair stood out around her head
Just like a lion’s mane,
And she was scolded, coaxed, and
teased
About it—but in vain
It caught on buttons, hooks, and
bough*
As here kud there she rushed,
And yet she would not consent
To have it combed or brushed.
»
And so she fell asleep one day
Within the woods, and there
Vo birdies came and built a nest
Amid her tangled hair.
A Careless Girl.
I know a very careless girl,
Her hair is always out of curl,
In rags and tatters are her clothes,
And she’s a fright, you may suppose
Her skirts she catches on a nail,
And leaves behind an ugly trail ;
Her sashes always are untied,
Her dresses always gaping wide
Tis her delight to tear and rend ;
She does not like to patch or mend ;
And ’tis no wonder that she goes
So out at elbows and at toes
Naughty Girl.
The naughty girl
Never minds mamma ;
Always says, “ I won't ! "
To dear papa!
Makes a great deal of noise
About the house,
When her mother wants her
As still as a mouse
She pinches the cat,
She pulls her tail:
And takes the bird-cage
Down from the nail ;
Teases her brothers,
And spoils her hair.
And when reproved says.
*• I don’t care ! "
She worries poor grandma
Makes baby cry ;
She cannot please him,
And I know why;—
She lets him lie
In the crib and moan.
While she is amusing
Herself alone
At school she forgets
What the teacher said,
Sits idly leaning her hands
On her head ;
She never learns
The task that’s given,
And cannot tell even
Seven times seven
At table she's careless,
And spills her drink,
Can never be taught
To “ stop and think ; ”
Gets down from the table
And goes to play.
To do the same over
Another day
Mopy Maria.
Mopy Maria
Would sit by the fire,
It seemed to be
Her greatest desire ;
Bent and bowed
As if wrapped in a shroud,
And her face as black
Asa thunder-cloud
She filled the room
So full of gloom,
The place was as
Dismal as a tomb ;
And few would admire
Her, or desire
To spend much time
With Mopy Maria,
She moped and pined
Yet no one could find
That any trouble
Disturbed her mind ;
Nor reasons good
Why she should brood
In such a
Ridiculous attitude
It wasn’t her style
To 'augh and smile
She didn’t think
It was worth her while;
So dull and flat
She daily sat
Like a Chinese idol.
Or worse than that,
If the children came
To propose a game
Of any sort,
It was all the same ;
She wouldn’t play,
She wouldn’t be gay,
But sat and pouted
The livelong day
Her face grew thin ;
And at length her chin
Grew long and sharp ;
Oh ! as sharp as a pin !
And one windy day
She blew away
Like a great big kite
That had gone astray.
The winds were high,
And she had to fly
Away at their bidding ;
It made her cry ;
But she couldn’t get higher
Than the tall church spire,
So there she stuck—
Poor Mopy Maria!
Disobedient May.
Naughty May will not obey.
But will always have her way
Every moment of the day
If you say do this, or that,
She will be amazed thereat,
Show her claws like any cat
O she is a naughty child !
Very fond of running wild,
Never gentle, meek, or mild
Some fine day, I don’t know when—
She'll be popp’d in piggy's pen,
And be most unhappy then
Pigs are stubborn things indeed,
Will not go as you would lead,
Never words of counsel heed
And pig-headed folks are they
Who will always have their way,
Spite of anything you say
Sluttishness.
Oh ! Mary, my Mary,
Why where is your dolly ?
Look here, I protest, on the floor;
To leave her about
In the dirt so is folly,
You ought to be trusted no more.
I thought you were pleas’d,
And receiv’d her quite gladly.
When on your birthday she came homo
Did I ever suppose
You would use her so sadly,
And strew her things over the room ?
Her bonnet of straw
You once thought a great matter,
And tied it so pretty and neat;
Now see how ’tis crumpled,
No trencher is flatter,
It grieves your mamma thus to see’t.
Suppose (your’re my Dolly,
You know, little daughter,
Whom I love to dress neat, and see good)
Suppose in my care of you,
I were to falter,
And let you get dirty and rude !
But Dolly’s mere wood, 4
You are flesh and bone living,
And deserves better treatment and care
That is true, my sweet girl.
’Tis the reason I’m giving
This lesson so sharp and severe
’Tis not for the Dolly
I’m anxious and fearful,
Tho’ she cost too much to be spoil i ,
I’m afraid lest yourself
Should get sluttish, not careful,
And that were a sad thing, my child
Jane, who Bit her Nails.
When I was living down in Wales,
I knew a girl who bit her nails;
Her finger-ends became so sore,
The blood flowed from them on the
floor.
The more she bit the more they bled.
Until upon herself she fed ;
And as she nibbled day by day,
The fingers slowly wore away.
See, here she is: she sadly stands
With only stumps instead of hands
The silly girl can never play,
Yet she was cautioned every day.
Her father said. "You naughty thing,
Some wooden fingers I must bring.
And try to get them fastened to
Your hands with little bits of glue.”
Poking Fun.
When little Lizzie came across
A birdie, or a chick,
A duckling, or a gosling.
She would poke it with a stick
She chased the dog, she chased
the cat.
But when she saw a mouse
She gave a scream so very loud
It echoed through the house.
She poked the turtles and the frogs
And thought it was fine fun,
But when the geese poked out their
necks
At her, she had to run.
One day she chanced to find a hive
With not a bee about,
And said, " Is any one at home ?
" I’ll very soon find out 1” (
And so she did. As soon as she
Had poked her stick inside,
The bees flew out and stung her so
She very nearly died
GIKL LA N'T).


The Pin.
'• Dear me ! what signifies a pin,
Wedg'd in a rotten board ?
I’m certain that 1 won’t begin,
At ten years old, to hoard I
I never will be called a miser ;
That I'm determined,” said Eliza
So onward tripped the little maid,
And left the pin behind.
Which very snug and quiet lay,
To its hard fate resign'd ;
Nor did she think (a careless chit)
'Twas worth her while to stoop
for it.
Next day a parly was to ride
To see an air balloon ;
And all the company beside
Were dressed and ready soon :
But she a woful case was in,
For want of just a single pin
In vain her eager eyes she brings
To ev’ry darksome crack,
There was not one ! and yet her
things
W'ere dropping off her back
She cut her pincushion in two,
But no, not one had slidden
through.
At last, as hunting on the floor,
Over a crack she lay,
The carriage rattled to the door.
Then rattled fast away :
But poor Eliza was not in,
For want of just a single pin
There’s hardly anything so small.
So trifling or so mean,
That we may never want at all.
For service unforeseen ;
And wilful waste, depend upon t
Brings, almost always, woful want 1

Stupid Jane.
Oh I she was such a stupid Jane.
They tried in vain
To make things plain,
But she would ask and ask again.
As if there wasn’t any brain
Inside the head of Stupid Jane
If she was set to do a task,
So many questions she would ask,
Twas easier far her teachers said
To do the work themselves instead,
Than try to make her understand
The lesson that she had in hand
If on an errand told to go,
And cautioned to do thus and so,
Turn here and there along the way.
Oh ! Jane was sure to go astray ;
For she had such a crooked pate.
She could not do an errand straight
She did not care for books or toys,
She could not play with girls or boys;
Because so oft she blocked their
games,
They used to call her dreadful names,
And in loud, angry tones complain,
" Oh, what a horrid. Stupid Jane I”
Brought in the parlour nicely drest
To be presented to a guest,
With finger in her mouth she’d stand
And stare about on every hand.
Nor answer by a single word,
Nor even act as if she heard
Ohl she was such a stupid Jane,
They tried in vain
To make things plain.
But she would ask and ask again,
As if there wasn't any brain
Inside the head of Stupid Jane'
Little Girl who wouldn't
eat Crusts.
The awfullest times that ever could be
They had with a bad little girl of Dundee,
Who never would finish her crust
In vain they besought her,
And patiently taught her
And told her she must.
Her grandma would coax,
And so would the folks,
And tell her the sinning
Of such a beginning.
But no, she wouldn’t,
She couldn't, she shouldn't.
She'd have them to know—
So they might as well go.
And what do you think soon came to pass ?
This little girl of Dundee, alas 1
Who wouldn’t take crusts in the regular way.
Sat down to a feast one summer's day ;
And what did the people that little girl give?
Why, a dish of bread pudding—as sure as 1
live!
Pouting Polly.
Polly was a little girl.
Pretty as a posy ;
Rather straight, and rather tall;
Very round and rosy
Other little girls and boys
Always were delighted,
If to pretty Polly’s house
They had been invited.
There they'd romp, and have great
fun,
Frolicking and shouting;
But alas! they soon would find
Pretty Polly pouting!
What had any one done ?
How had they displeased her ?
Was she sad or mad because
Johnny Dean had teased her?
Why are you so cros* and glum
When the rest are jolly ?
With your under lip thrust out,
Tell us. pouting Polly ?
Polly loves to have her way ;
Ah ! no one can doubt it ;
And whenever she's displeased
She will pout about it.
Such a funny under-lip I
You would like to grab it,
So that little Polly might
Break this naughty habit
In the house or out-of-doors,
Little Polly Horner
You will find a dozen times
Pouting in a corner.
Once, when in the garden she
Stood thus melancholy,
On her under-lip a bee
Stung Miss Pouting Polly
Then she danced, and then she
screamed ;
People heard her yelling
Half a mile or more away,
While her lip was swelling
Oh, it swelled, and swelled, and
swelled,
Like a great big blister,
And the pain was very great
Where the bee had kissed her.
Many days she kept her bed ;
And there is no doubting
That the sorry little maid
Had her fill of pouting.
For the buzzing busy-bee
Cured her of her folly ;
And the remedy will cure
Any pouting Polly.
Untidy Emily.
Oh. here's a sad picture !
Pray carefully look I
As sad as was ever
Yet seen in a book
'Tis Emily's portrait:
Not at all flattered
Slovenly, dirty, untidy,
And tattered
There she is !!-that’s her!!!
Her mother implores her,
Again and again,
To make herself tidy ;
But all is in vain.
Her trimmings are torn ;
There's a hole in her
dress ;
Another, still larger;
Her shoes in a mess;
Stockings down; buttons
missing ;
Shabby old hat,
Not for worlds would I
Wear it, battered and flat
Her mother does nothing
But patch, darn, and
mend,
Till, saddened and weary,
She says, “This must end
“ All, all is in vain,
And now, happen what
may,
I can do nothing more ;
So go your own way."
A terrible thing
Very soon now befell.
Oh, horror 1 I shudder
The story to tell.
This girl ran quite wild;
Till at last she became
All tatters and rags,
With no feeling of shame
A man, who was passing,
Then took her one day,
And in his field placed her,
To scare birds away.
She is still standing there ;
Stands there day and
night.
The sparrows fly round her,
And cry in afiright :
“ Look at this dreadful
thing 1 <
Take care now, take care I
Beware of the scarecrow I
Beware, now, beware I ”

My Five Sisters.
Maidenhood.
Maiden ! with the meek, brown eyes,
In whose orbs a shadow lies,
Like a dusk in evening skies I
Thou, whose locks outshine the sun,
Golden tresses, wreathed in one,
As the braided streamlets run I
Standing, with reluctant feet,
Where the brook and river meet 1
Womanhood and childhood fleet !
Gazing, with a timid glance,
On the brooklet’s swift advance,
On the river’s broad expanse !
Deep and still, that gliding stream
Beautiful to thee must seem,
As the river of a dream.
Then why pause with indecision,
When bright angels in thy vision
Beckon thee to fields Elysian ?
Seest thou shadows sailing by,
As the dove, with startled eye,
Sees the falcon’s shadow fly ?
Hearest thou voices on the shore,
That our ears perceive no more,
Deafen’d by the cataract’s roar?
O. thou child of many prayers 1
Life hath quicksands —Life hath snares !
Care and age come unawares !
Like the swell of some sweet tune,
Morning rises into noon,
May glides onward into June.
Childhood is the bough where slumber’d
Birds and blossoms many-number’d—
Age, that bough with snows encumber'd
Gather, then, each flower that grows,
When the young heart overflows,
To embalm that tent of snows.
bear a lily in thy hand ;
Gates of brass cannot withstand
One touch of that magic wand
Bear, through sorrow, wrong, and ruth,
In thy heart the dew of youth,
On thy lips the snul' of truth
Oh ! that dew, like balm, shall steal
Into wounds, that cannot heal,
Even as sleep our eyes doth seal;
And that smile, like sunshine, dart
Into many a sunless heart,
For a smile of God thou art.
Girls that are in Demand.
The girls that are wanted are good girls—
Good from the heart to the lips ;
Pure as the lily is white and pure,
From its heart to its sweet leaf tips.
The girls that are wanted are home girls—
Girls that are mother’s right hand,
That fathers and brothers can trust to.
And the little ones understand.
Girls that are fair on the hearthstone,
And pleasant when nobody sees ;
Kind and sweet to their own folks,
Ready and anxious to please
The girls that are wanted are wise girls.
That know what to do and to say;
That drive with a smile and a soft word
The wrath of the household away.
The girls that are wanted are girls of sense,
Whom fashion can never deceive ;
Who can follow whatever is pretty.
And dare what is silly to leave.
The girls that are wanted are careful girls,
Who count what a thing will cost.
Who use with a prudent generous hand.
But see that nothing is lost.
The girls that are wanted are girls with hearts;
They are wanted for mothers and wives,
Wanted to cradle in loving arms
The strongest and frailest lives.
The clever, the witty, the brilliant girl,
There are few who can understand ;
But, oh ! for the wise, loving home girls
There's a constant steady demand

There's something in the name of Kate
Which many will condemn;
But listen now while I relate
The traits of some of them.
There's deli-Kate, a modest dame,
She’s worthy of your love!
She’s nice and beautiful a flame,
And gentle as a dove.
Communi-Kate’s intelligent,
As we may well suppose ;
Her fruitful mind is ever bent
On telling all she knows.
There’s intri-Kate, she's so obscure
’Tis hard to find her out;
For she is often very sure
To put »jour wits to rout.
Prevari-i ate's a surly maid,
She’s s ire to have her way;
The cavil ling, contrary jade,
Objects to all you say.
There’s alter-Kate, a perfect pest;
Much given to dispute ;
Her prattling tongue can never rest,
You cannot her refute.
Then dislo-Kate, is quite a fret,
Who fails to gain her point;
Her case is quite unfortunate
And sorely out of joint.
Equivo-Kate no one will woo —
The thing would be absurd.
She is so faithless and untrue,
You cannot take her word.
There’s vindi-Kate, she’s good and
true;
And strives with all her might
Her duty faithfully to do
And battles for the right.
There’s rusti-Kate, a country lass,
Quite fond of rural scenes;
She likes to ramble through the grass
And through the evergreens.
Of all the maidens you can find,
There’s none like edu-Kate;
Because she elevates the mind
And aims at something great.

NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC.
If a schoolmistress cbootes to live a hundred or a thousand miles away from her school, ahe can use the Scolding Machine by means of a Tiltpkofu attached thereto.
One great advantage of the Electo-micro Scolding Machine is, that after it has been In use a short time the girl* will all have been shamed into good behaviour; but
the Machine will not become useless, as it can, without a farthing outlay, be turned into a Praising Machine, for it can be made to praiee in a gentle voice as well as
cold in a harsh one. In fact, as said above it will repeat in exact tones, anything that is recited, preached, sung, whistled, whispered, shouted, scolded or praised into It
—and any of which will be heard for forty miles around.
Cole can supply Scolding Machines from £5 to £5O. A very good one (The Excelsior), price £lO, can be charged in one minute, and set going like a musical box, and
will sing, whistle, recite, preach, or scold away for fully an hour without stopping. Cole would particularly recommend this one to the ladiea.it would make a fine
ornament for their own table.
Final Notice Extraordinary —lf the champion male scold of the world, and the champion female scold of the world, will call on Professor Cole, at the Book Arcade,
Melbourne, he will give them both good wages, and find them constant employment at charging Scolding Machines. If any wife has got the champion male scold (or a
husband she will please to let me know If any husband has get the champion female scold for a wife, he will please to let me know.—£lo bonus for Informant In enab

COLE'S ELECTRO-MICRO SCOLDING MACHINE FOR SCOLDING NAUGHTY GIRLS.
Cole i Electro-tplcro Scolding Machine is a com-
bination of three instruments, the Phonograph, the
Microphone, and the Wonderphone.
The Phonograph It an instrument that will pre-
serve words for any length of time. Any person
can ipeak, ting, whistle, or scold into a Phonograph,
and months or years afterwards by simply turning
a handle the same sounds can be reproduces a dozen,
a hundred, or a thousand timet in the exact voice
ot tne person who spoke them in; so that if a man
of a woman, who is a great scold, speak tome good,
loud, severe scolding into a Phonograph, the mildest
teacher can then soundly scold her pupils, or the
kindest mother her children, by just turning the
handle.
The Microphone is an Instrument that magnifies
sound In the same way as a microscope magnifies
objects; a very powerful microphone magnifies the
sound of a fly walking into a loud tramping footstep,
the tick of a watch into a deafening clatter, and a
whisper into a loud shout. Take a Microphone,
then properly affix it to the Phonograph described
above, and you have a good Scolding Machine; turn
the handle, and as the Phonograph gives out the
scoldings, the microphone part magnifies them so
loudly that they are heard for a considerable distance
The Wonderphone (Cole’s own secret) is another
remarkable instrument; it will cause sound to travel
very distinctly, but frightfully and equally loud, for
forty miles in all directions; by attaching this power-
ful instrument to the combination of the other two,
Cole's Electro-micro Scolding Machine is formed
and which is the first Scolding Machine ever
invented. If the machine is already charged by
having had some scolding spoken, or even whispered
into it, give the handle a turn, and forty miles to the
east, forty miles to the west, forty to the north, forty
to the south, forty up In the sky, and down in the
mines forty miles deep, in fact forty miles in every
direction everybody can clearly hear every word
that is said to the girl being scolded. Suppose for
instance. Hannah Maria Smith had done something
wrong in school, the schoolmistress could give the
handle of the machine a turn, and it would scold her
so loudly that her mother, and father, and brothers,
and sisters, and uncles, and aunts, and friends, and
those she didn't like, would all hear her scolded.
The machine can be charged on the instant by any-
one scolding into it. In fact the whole value of Cole's
Scolding Machine lies in its power to repeat out
exceedingly loud whatever Is spoken into it.
If the schoolmistress chooses she can put tha
scolding into verse, so that all who hear it in the
forty miles around, can more easily remember it.
The machine that I have before me now, was charged
this morning for an aristocratic school and speaks
as follows :—Silence 11 Attention 111

GIRL LAND.


GOOD GIRLS.
Jenny Lee.
An orphan child was Jenny Lee;
Her father, he was dead ;
And very hard her mother worked,
To get the children bread
In winter time, she often rose
Long ere the day was light,
And left her orphan family,
Till dark again at night.
And she would always say to Jane,
Before she went away
" Be sure you mind the little ones,
And don't go out to play.
" Keep baby quiet in his bed,
As long as he will lie ;
Then take him up, and dance him well,
Don’t leave him there to cry.
" And don't let little Christopher,
Get down into the street,
For fear he meets an accident
Beneath the horse’s feet.
*' And mind about the fire, child,
And keep a tidy floor ;
We never need be dirty, Jane,
Although we may be poor.
•• Good-by my precious comforter.
For all the neighbours say,
That 1 can trust my little maid,
Whenever I’m away."
Then Jenny she was quite as proud
As England’s noble Queen,
And she resolved to do the work.
And keep the dwelling clean.
She did not stop to waste her time,
But very brisk was she,
And worked as hard and cheerfully
As any busy bee.
[f down upon the cottage floor
Her little brother fell,
She stroked the places tenderly,
And kissed and made them well
And when the little babe was cross,
As little babes will be.
She nursed and danced it merrily,
And fed it on her knee
But when they both were safe in bed,
She neatly swept the hearth,
And waited till her mother’s step
Came sounding up the path.
Then open flew the cottage door,
The weary mother smiled;
"Ah I jenny dear, what should I do,
Without my precious child I"
Work Before Play.
"Mother has sent me to the well,
To fetch a jug of water,
And I am very glad to be
A useful little daughter ;
And that is why 1 cannot play
With you and Mary Ann to-day.
"Some afternoon I’ll come with you,
And make you wreaths and posies ;
1 know a place where blue-bells grow,
And daisies and primroses:
But not to-day, for 1 must go [know
And h«lp my mothw, dears you
"She says, that I am nearly eight,
So I can fill the kettle,
And sweep the room and clean the grate
And even scrub a little;
Oh ! I'm so very glad to be
A little useful girl, you see
"So Johnny, do not ask to-day—
Perhaps I’ll come to morrow;
But you’d not wish me now to stay,
And give my mother sorrow.
When she can spare me, she will say,
"Now, Susan, you may go and play.’ '
Lucy Gray.
Oft I had heard of Lucy Gray ;
And, when I crossed the wild,
I chanced to see at break of day
The solitary child
No mate, no comrade Lucy knew ;
She dwelt on a wide moor, —
The sweetest thing that ever grew
Besides a human door!
You yet may spy the fawn at play,
The hare upon the green ;
But the sweet face of Lucy Gray
Will never more be seen.
“ To-night will be a stormy night—
You to the town must go;
And take a lantern, child, to light
Your mother through the snow "
"That, father, will I gladly do I
'Tis scarcely afternoon—
The Minster-clock has just struck two,
And yonder is the moon "
At this the father raised his hook
And snapped a faggot band ;
He plied his work ; —and Lucy took
The lantern in her hand.
Not blither is the mountain roe:
With many a wanton stroke
Her feet disperse the powdery snow,
That rises up like smoke.
The storm came on before its time ;
She wandered up and down ;
And many a hill did Lucy climb,
But never reached the town.
The wretched parents all that night
Went shouting far and wide ;
But there was neither sound nor sight
To serve them for a guide.
At day-break on a hill they stood
That overlooked the moor ;
And thence they saw the bridge of wood
A furlong from their door.
And, turning homeward, now they cried
" In heaven we shall meet ! ”
When in the snow the mother spied
The print of Lucy's feet.
Then downwards from the steep hill's
edge
They tracked the footmarks small;
And through the broken hawthorn
edge,
And by the long stone wall
And then an open field they crossed—
The marks were still the same ;
They tracked them on, nor ever lost ;
And to the bridge they came.
They followed from the snowy bank
The footmarks, one by one,
Into the middle of the plank ;
And further there were none !
Yet some maintain that to this day
She is a living child;
That you may see sweet Lucy Gray
Upon the lonesome wild.
O’er rough and smooth she trips along.
And never looks behind ;
And sings a solitary song
That whistles in the wind
Mary’s Little Lamb.
Mary had a little lamb,
His fleece was white as snow;
And everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go.
He followed her to school one day—
That was against the rule ;
It made the children laugh and play.
To see a lamb at school
The teacher therefore turned him out
But still he lingered near,
And on the grass he played about
Till Mary did appear.
At once he ran to her, and laid
His head upon her arm,
As if to say, I’m not afraid—
You’ll keep me from all harm.
“What makes the lamb love Mary so? ’’
The little children ery :
"Oh! Mary loves the lamb you know, "
The teacher did reply


We are Seven.
I met a little cottage girl;
She was eight years old. she said;
Her head was thick with many a curl
That clustered round her head
She had a rustic, woodland air,
And she was wildly clad;
Her eyes were fair, and very fair,
Her beauty made me glad
"Sisters and brothers, little maid,
How many may you be ?"
"How many? Seven in all." she said,
And. wondering, looked at me
"And where are they? I pray you tell "
She answered. "Seven are we;
And two of us at Conway dwell,
And two are gone to sea
" Two of us in the churchyard lie—
My sister and my brother;
And in the churchyard cottage I
Dwell near them with my mother."
"You say that two at Conway dwell,
And two are gone to sea;
Yet ye are seven! I pray you tell,
Sweet maid, how this may be?"
Then did the little maid reply,
"Seven boys and girls are we;
Two of us in the chuchyard lie.
Beneath the churchyard tree "
"You run about, my little maid,
Your limbs they are alive!
If two are in the churchyard laid,
Then ye are only five."
"Their graves are green, they may be
seen,"
The little maid replied;
"Twelve steps or more, from my
mother s door,
And they are side by side
*'My stockings there 1 often knit,
My kerchief there I hem;
And there upon the ground I sit,
I sit and sing to them
" And often after sunset, sir,
When it is light and fair,
I take my little porringer,
And eat my supper there.
"The first that died was little Jane;
In bed she moaning lay,
Till God released her of her pain,
And then she went away.
"So in the churchyard she was laid;
And, when the grass was dry,
Together round her grave we played,
My brother John and I.
"And when the ground was white with
snow,
And I could run and slide,
My brother John was forced to go,
And he lies by her side.”
"How many are you then," said I,
"If they two are ip heaven!"
The little maiden did reply,
"O master! we are seven."
"But they are dead; those two are dead.
Their spirits are in heaven!"
Twas throwing words away; for still
The little maid would have her will,
And said, "Nay. we are sever 1
The Poor, bnt Kind Girl.
Young Lucy Payne lives on the Village Green ;
Mary, you know the cottage, I am sure,
Under the hawthorn I * Tis so neat and clean,
Though Widow Payne, alas! is blind and poor
She plies her needles, and she plies them well,
And Lucy never spends an idle hour ;
On market days their mits and socks they sell,
And thus their balls of worsted turn to flour
I pass'd one morning by their cottage door;
Lucy was talking to a little child,
A ragged thing that lives upon the moor ;
Its parents leave it to run rude and wild
Hunger had tamed the little wilding thing,
Its cheeks were hollow, but its air was light ;
Young Lucy did not know I saw her bring
That porringer she kept so clean and bright
It was her breakfast—all the darling had ;
But oh ! she gave it with a heart so glad.

"Over the wave, the stormy wave,
Hasten, dear father, with me,
The crew to save from a wat ry grave,
Deep in the merciless sea
Hear ye the shriek, the piercing shriek,
Hear ye the cry of despair ?
With courage quick the wreck we ll seek ;
Danger united we’ll dare
" Out with the boat, the gallant boat .
Not a moment to be lost:
See! she's afloat, proudly afloat,
And high on the waves we're tossed.
Mother, adieu, a short adieu ;
Your prayers will rise to heaven
Father, to you—your child and you -
Power to save is given
"I have no fear, no maiden fear.
My heart is firm to the deed,

Safe, through the pelting storm

They know that succour is nigh "
And on that night, that dreadful night,

With strengthened might they both unite,
And many dear lives they save

The maid of matchless worth;
She'll e’er abide the cherished pride
Of the land that gave her birth

But, with true regard, the loved reward
Is the joy of her own brave heart

With her hair short and smooth, and her

In a stout cotton gown, of dark and light

Though old. so well mended, you'd take

Her handkerchief tidily pinned o’er her

With a neat little cap, and an apron of

Her shoes and her stockings all sound

She's never fine outside, and dirty

Go visit her cottage; though humble
and poor,
'Tis so neat and so clean, you might eat

No rubbish, no cobwebs, no din can be

Though you hunt every corner, and

Our dear little daughter once went to a children’s ball

looked so nice that 1 put together the above nursery

BOYS’ STORIES.
Tommy Trot, a man of law,
Sold his bed and lay upon straw ;
Sold the straw and slept on grass,
To buy his wife a looking-glass.
Little Jack Jingle,
He used to live single ;
But when he got tired of this kind of
life,
He left off being single, and lived with
his wife.
I'll tell you a story
About Jack a Nory,—
And now my story’s begun ;
I’ll tell you another
About Jack his brother, —
And now my story’s done.
Poor old Robinson Crusoe!
Poor old Robinson Crusoe!
They made him a coat
Of an old nanny-goat,
I wonder how they could do so I
With a ring and a ting tang,
And a ring and a ting tang,
Poor old Robinson Crusoe!
"John, come sell thy fiddle,
And buy thy wife a gown.”
"No: I’ll not sell my fiddle
For any wife in town.”
Jacky, come give me thy fiddle
If ever thou mean’st to thrive:
Nay, I’ll not give my fiddle
To any man alive.
If I should give my fiddle,
They’ll think that Pm gone mad,
For many a joyful day
My fiddle and I have had
Jack was a fisherman
Who went out one day,
But couldn’t catch a single fish,
And so he came away.
And then he came home,
This angler so bold,
And found he’d caught something—
For he’d caught a cold.
The Queen of Hearts,
She made some tarts,
All on a summer day ;
The Knave of Hearts
He stole those tarts,
And took them clean away
The King of Hearts
Called for the tarts,
And beat the knave full sore;
The Knave of Hearts
Brought back the tarts,
And vowed he’d steal no more.

TOM, THE PIPER’S SON.
i
Tom, Tom, the piper’s son,
Stole a pig and away did run!
The pig he eat, and Tom they beat,
And Tom went roaring down the street,
Tom, he was a piper s son :
He learned to play when he was young;
But all the tunes that he could play
Was, " Over the hills and far away :
Over the hills and a great way off,
And the wind will blow my topknot off.”
Now Tom with his pipe made such a noise,
That he pleased both the girls and the boys,
And they stopped to hear him play
"Over the hills and far away."
Tom with his pipe did play with such skill,
That those who heard him could never keep still;
Whenever they heard they began for to dance,
Even pigs on their hind legs would after him prance.
As Dolly was milking her cow one day,
Tom took out his pipe and began for to play;
So Doll and the cow danced “ the Cheshire round,”
Till the pail they broke, and the milk ran on the ground
He met old Dame Trot with a basket of
eggs.
He used his pipe and she used her legs;
She danced about till all the eggs she
broke,
She began for to fret, but he laughed at
the joke.
He saw a cross fellow was beating an ass,
Heavily laden with pots, pans, dishes,
and glass;
He took out his pipe and played them a
tune,
And the jackass did kick off his load very
soon.
Tom met the parson on his way.
Took out his pipe, began to play
A merry tune that led his grace
Into a very muddy place.
The mayor then said he would not fail
To send poor Tommy off to gaol.
Tom took his pipe, began to play,
And all the court soon danced away
’T was quite a treat to see the rout,
How clerks and judges hopped about;
While Tommy still kept playing the tune,
*• I’ll be free this afternoon.”
Then Policeman Grab, who held him
fast,
Began to dance about at last;
Whilst Tom, delighted at the fun,
Slipped out of court and off did run.
Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a
thief.
Taffy came to my house, and stole a
piece of beef.
I went to Taffy’s house, Taffy was not at
home;
Taffy came to my house and stole a
marrow-bone.
I went to Taffy’s house, Taffy was not in,
Taffy came to my house and stole a silver
pin.
I went to Taffy's house, Taffy was in bed.
I took up a poker and flung it at hi*
head.
Old King Cole
Was a merry old soul,
And a merry old soul was he;
He called for his pipe,
And he called for his bowl.
And he called for his fiddlers three

Would you know the reason why?
He follows his nose where er he goes,
And that stands all awry.

Says the pieman to Simple Simon.
"Show me first the penny."
Says Simple Simon to the pieman :
" Indeed I have not any.”
Simple Simon went a fishing
For to catch a whale—
All the water he had got
Was in his mother’s pail.
Simple Simon went to look
If plums grew on a thistle ;
He pricked his fingers very much,
Which made poor Simon whistle
He went to catch a dicky bird,
And thought he could not fail
Because he’d got a little salt
■To put upon its tail.
Then Simple Simon went a-hunting,
For to catch a hare ;
He rode on a goat about the street,
But could not find one there
Simon made a great snowball,
And brought it in to roast;
He laid it down before the fire,
And soon the ball was lost.
Simple Simon went a-skating
When the ice was thin,
And Simon was astonished quite
To find he tumbled in.
And Simon he would honey eat
Out of the mustard pot;
He bit his tongue until he cried :
"That was all the good he got.”

Jack the Giant Killer.
o
Once upon a time there uved in Cornwall.
England, a lad whose name was Jack, and who
was very brave and knowing At the same
time there was a great Giant, twenty feet high
and nine feet round, who lived in a cave, on an
island near Jack’s house. The Giant used to
wade to the mainland and steal things to live
upon, carrying five or six bullocks at once, and
stringing sheep, pigs, and geese around his
waist-band; and all the people ran away from
him through fear, whenever they saw him
coming
Jack determined to destroy this Giant; so he
got a pickaxe and shovel, and started in his
boat on a dark evening ; by the morning he had
dug a pit deep and broad, then covering it with
sticks and strewing; a little mould oyer, to
make it look like plain ground, he blew his horn
so loudly that the Giant awoke, and came roar-
ing towards Jack,, calling him a villain for
disturbing his rest, and declaring he would eat
him for breakfast. He had scarcely said
this when he fell into the pit. "Oh! Mr
Giant,” says Jack, "where are you now?
You shall have this for your breakfast.”
So saying, he struck him on the head so
terrible a blow with his pickaxe that
the Giant fell dead to the bottom.
Just at this moment the Giant’s brother
ran out roaring vengeance against Jack;
but he jumped into his boat and pulled to
the opposite shore, with the Giant after
him, who caught poor Jack just as he was
landing, tied him down in his boat, and
went in search of provisions. During his
absence Jack contrived to cut a large hole
in the bottom of the boat, and placed
therein a piece of canvas. After having
stolen some oxen the Giant returned and
pushed off the boat, when, having got
fairly out to sea, Jack pulled the canvas
from the hole, which caused the boat to
fill and quickly capsize. The Giant
roared and bellowed as he struggled in
the water, but very soon was exhausted
and drowned, while Jack dexterously
swam ashore.
One day after this, Jack was sitting by
a well fast asleep A Giant named Blun-
debore, coming for water, at once saw
and caught hold of him, and carried him to
his castle Jack was much frightened at
seeing the neaps of bodies and bones
strewed about. The Giant then confined
him in an upper room over the entrance,
and went for another Giant to breakfast
off poor Jack. On viewing the room he
saw some strong ropes, and making a
noose at one end, he put the other
through a pulley which chanced to be over the
window, and when the Giants were unfastening
the gate he threw the noose over both their
heads, and pulling it immediately, he contrived
to choke them both. Then releasing three
ladies who were confined in the castle, he de-
parted well pleased.
About five or six months after, Jack was
journeying through Wales, when, losing his
way, he could find no place of entertainment,
and was about giving up all hopes of obtaining
shelter during the night when he came to a
gate, and, on knocking, to his utter as-
tonishment it was opened by a Giant, who did
not seem so fierce as the others. Jack told him
his distress, when the Giant invited him in, and,
after giving him a hearty supper, showed him
to bed. Jack had scarcely got into bed when
be heard the Giant muttering to himself;
“Though you lodge with me this night,
You shall not see the morning light:
My club shall dash your brains out quite "
“Oh, Mr. Giant, is that your game?” said Jack
to himself; “then I shall try and be even with
you ” So he jumped out of bed, and put a large
lump of wood there instead In the middle of
th* night the Giant went into the room, and
thinVlna it was lack in th« bed. he belaboured
the wood most unmercifully: he then left the room,
laughing to think how he had settled poor Jack The
following morning Jack went boldly into the Giant s
room to thank him for his night’s lodging. The Giant
was startled at his appearance, and asked him how he
slept, or if anything had disturbed him in the night?
" Oh', no,” says Jack. " nothing worth speaking about;
I believe that a rat gave me a few slaps with his tail,
but, being rather sleepy, I took no notice of it.” The
Giant wondered how Jack survived the terrific blows
of his club, yet did not answer a word, but went and
brought in two monstrous bowls of hasty pudding,
placed one before Jack, and began eating the other
himself. Determined to be revenged on the Giant
somehow, Jack unbuttoned his leathern provision bag
inside his coat, and slyly filling it with hasty pudding,
said, " I’ll do what you can’t." So saying, he took up
a large knife, and ripping up the bag, let out the hasty
pudding. The Giant, determined not to be outdone,
seized hold of the knife, and saying, " I can do that,”
instantly ripped up his belly, and fell down dead on the
spot.
After this Jack fought and conquered many giants,
married the king’s daughter, and lived happily.
Jack and the Beanstalk.
At some distance from London, in a small village,
lived a widow and her son, whose name was Jack
He was a bold, daring fellow, ready for any adventure
which promised fun or amusement. Jack’s mother had
a cow, of which she was very fond, and which, up to
this time, had been their chief support. But as she
had for some time past been growing poorer every year,
she felt that now she must part with the cow. So she
told Jack to take the cow to be sold, and he was to
be sure to get a good round sum for her. On the road
to market Jack met a butcher, who was carrying in his
hat some things which Jack thought very pretty. The
butcher saw how eagerly Jack eyed his beans, and
said, "If you want to sell your cow, my fine fellow, I
I will give you this whole hatful of beans in exchange
for her.”
Jack was delighted; he seized the hat, and ran back
home. Jack’s mother was surprised to see him back
so soon, and at once asked him for the money. But
when Jack said that he had sold the cow for a hatful
of beans, she was so angry that she opened the window,
and threw them all out into the garden When Jack
rose up next morning he found that one of the beans
had taken root, and had grown up, up, up. until its top
was quite lost in the clouds Jack resolved instantly
to mount the Beanstulk So up, up op, he ■went
till he had reached the very top. Looking round,
he saw at a distance a large house. Tired and
weary, he crawled towards it and knocked at the
door. The door was opened by a timid looking
woman who started when she saw him, and be-
sought him to run away as her husband was a
cruel Giant who would eat him up if he found
him there. But Jack begged so earnestly *o be
admitted that the woman, who was very kind-
hearted, had pity on him, and so she brought
him into the kitchen, and set before him on a
table some bread, meat, and ale Jack ate and
drank, and soon felt quite refreshed. Presently
the woman started and said, “ My husband !
quick, quick 1 he comes —he comes I " and
opened the door of the oven and bid Jack jump
in The Giant was in a dreadful passion when
he came in, and almost killed his wife by a blow
which he aimed at her. He then began to sniff
and smell— at last he roared out:
“Fee, fa, fi, fo, fum,
I smell the blood of an Englishman!
Be he alive, or be he dead,
I’ll grind his bones to make me bread 1”
His wife gave him an evasive answer, and
proceeded to lay before him his supper.
When the Giant could swallow no more,
he called out to his wife to bring him his
hen, which, after having been brought,
whenever the Giant said " Lay,” the hen
laid a golden egg. The Giant soon fell
asleep, and Jack crept out softly and seized
the hen, and made off without disturbing
the Giant. Away ran Jack till he came to
the Beanstalk ; he was much sooner at the
bottom of it now than at the top in the
morning; and running to his mother he
told all his adventure.
The hen laid as many golden eggs as
Jack liked, and his mother before long
had another cow and everything which
she desired. A second time Jack climbed
the beanstalk, when he ran away with the
Giant’s bags of money. A third time Jack
climbed the Beanstalk, and again gained
admission to the Giant's house. He saw
the Giant’s wife, and asked her for a
night’s lodging. She at first said she
could not let him into the house, but Jack
begged so hard that at last she consented,
and gave him some supper and put him
to sleep in the copper boiler near the
kitchen fireplace, where she thought the
Giant would not find him.
When the Giant came in, his good nose
served him in a moment; for he cried out
"I smell fresh meat." Jack laughed at
this, but it was no laughing matter; for
the Giant looked all round the room, and
even put his thumb upon the lid of the
copper, till it seemed as if a stone of a
hundredweight had fallen upon the lid. Just
then his wife came in with a whole roasted
bullock smoking hot, which the Giant sat down
and ate for his supper, and then went down into
the cellar, and drank about six gallons of Jamaica
rum. The Giant now sat down and went
to sleep, and Jack tried to run away with his
golden harp, an instrument which, when the
Giant said "play.” played most beautiful tunes.
Now the harp was a fairy, and as soon as Jack
touched it, it called out "Master! Master I ' so
loud that the Giant awoke, but he was some
time before he could understand what was the
matter. He tried to run after Jack, but Jack
got to the top of the Beanstalk first. When he
had descended a little way he looked up, and
how great was his horror to see the huge hand
of the Giant stretched down to seize him by the
hair of the head ! He slid and scrambled down
the Beanstalk, hardly knowing how. and
seeing the Giant just putting his feet over the
top, he called out, "Quick, mother! A hatchet,
a hatchet 1" Jack seized it and chopped away
at the Beanstalk, when down it fell, bringing
along with it the Giant. Jack instantly cut ofl
his head After this Jack and his mother lived
very happily, and Jack was a great comfort M

HOP O’ MY THUMB.
ONCK upon a time there was a woodman and his
wife who had so many children that they did
not know how to find food for them. So one
night, when they were all in bed, the father
told his wife that he thought they had better
take them into the forest and lose them there.
The youngest child, who was so very small that
he was called Hop o’ my Thumb, overheard his
father, and as he was a very clever boy he made
up his mind to find his way home again. So he
went down to the brook very early the next
morning, and filled his pocket with large smooth
pebbles as white as snow. Bye-and-bye the
woodman and his wife told the children that
they might go with them into the wood to have
a good game of play. They were all glad except
Hop o’ my Thumb, who knew what his father
intended. So they set out; the woodman and
his wife first, then the boys, and last Hop o’
my Thumb, who sprinkled pebbles all the way
they went.
They spent a merry day ; but bye-and-bye the
parents stole away, and left the children all
by themselves. They were very much fright-
•ned when they missed their father and
mother, and called loudly for them ; but
when Hop o’ my Thumb told them what he
had heard, and how they could find their
way home by following the track of the
pebbles, which marked the way they had
come, they set out, and reached home safely,
and their father and mother pretended to be
very glad to see them back.
But soon after they again resolved to lose
their children, if possible, in the forest. This
time all the boys feared that they should be
left behind, and the eldest brother said he
would take some peas to sprinkle, to mark
the pathway that led home. By-and-bye
the cruel parents stole away, and left the
little ones in the dark wood. At first they
did not care, for they thought that they could
easily find their way home ; but, alas I when
they looked for the line of peas which they
had sprinkled, they found they were all gone
—the wood-pigeons had eaten them up, and
the children were lost in the wood. Holding
each others' hands and crying sadly they
walked on to seek a place to sleep in. By-
and-bye they came to a giant's castle, where
they were taken in, and told that they might
sleep in the nursery with the seven baby
daughters of the giant, who were lying all
in a row in one bed, with gold crowns on
their heads. Hop o’ my Thump thought it
strange that the giant should be so kind, as
he had been told that the ogres eat children.
So in the night he got up softly and took off
the little giantesses’ crowns and put them
on his brothers’ heads and his own, and lay
down again. It was lucky for him that he did
so, for in the night the giant came up in the
dark to kill the boys, that they might be
ready for next day’s breakfast. He felt the
beds, and finding the crowns on the boys’
heads took them for his own children, left
them and went to the other bed and cut off the
heads of his daughters instead. Then he went
back to bed. Directly he was gone, Hop o’ my
Thumb and his brothers got up, stole down
stairs, opened the door and fled away from the
castle. But they did not go far. Hop o' my
Thump knew that the giant would eome after
them in his seven-league boots. So they got into
a hole in the side of a hill and hid. Very soon
after, they saw the giant coming at a great pace
in his wonderful boots ; but he took such long
steps that he passed right over their heads.
They were afraid to move out till they had seen
him go home again. So they remained quietly
where they were.
By-and-bye the giant, who had been many
miles in an hour, came back tired, and lay down
on the hill-side and fell asleep. Then Hop o’my
Thumb got out of the hole, and pulled off the
giant’s seven-league boots, and put them on his own
feet. They fitted him exactly, for being fairy boots
they would grow large or small just as one liked. He
then got his brothers out of the hole, took them in his
boots, marched for home, and although it was a great
distance, got there in almost no time, but when he
arrived at the house his father and mother were not
there. He then hastened to make inquiries for them,
and found that they had been suspected of murdering
their children, —who had all disappeared suddenly
that they had owned to leaving them in the wood, and
that they were to be put to death for the crime. “We
must go and save them,” he said. So he took his
brothers into the seven-league boots, and set out
to the place where their parents were in prison.
They arrived only just in time, for the guards were
bringing out the woodman and his wife to put
them to death. Hop o’ my Thumb took off the boots,
and all the children called out, "We are alive I we
arc alive 1 Do not kill our mother and father.”
Then there was great joy. The woodman and his
wife were set free, and embraced their children. They
had repented of their wickedness, and were never un-
kind and cruel any more; and Hop o’ my Thumb kept
them all in comfort by going on errands for the king
in his seven-league boots.
TOM THUMB.
Ik the days of good King Arthur there lived a plough-
man and his wife, who wished very much to have a
son ; so the man went to Merlin, the enchanter, and
asked him to let him have a child, even, if it were “ no
bigger than his thumb." “Go home and you will find
one,” said Merlin ; and when the man came back to
his house he found his wife nursing a very, very, wee
baby, who in four minutes grew to the size of the
ploughman’s thumb, and never grew any more. The
fairy queen came to his christening, and named him
“ Tom Thumb.” She then dressed him nicely in a
shirt of spider’s web, and a doublet and hose of thistle-
down.
One day, while Tom’s mother was making a plum-
pudding, Tom stood on the edge of the bowl, with a
lighted candle in his hand, that she might see to make
it properly. Unfortunately, however, while her back
was turned, Tom fell into the bowl, and his mother not
missing him, stirred him up in the pudding, and put it
and him into the pot. Tom no sooner felt the hot
water than he danced about like man ; the woman was
nearly frightened out of her wits to ses the pudding
come out of the pot and jump about, and she
was glad to give it to a tinker who was passing
that way.
The tinker was delighted with his present;
but as he was getting over a style, he happened
to sneeze very hard, and Tom called out from
the middle of the pudding, “ Hallo, Pickens I”
which so terrified the tinker that he threw the
pudding into the field, and scampered away as
fast as he could. The pudding tumbled to
pieces in the fall, and Tom, creeping out. went
home to his mother, who was in great affliction
because she could not find him A few days
afterwards Tom went with his mother into the
fields to milk the cows, and for fear he should
be blown away by the wind, she tied him to a
thistle with a small piece of thread. Very soon
after a cow ate up the thistle and swallowed
Tom Thumb. His mother was in sad grief
again ; but Tom scratched and kicked in the
cow’s throat till she was glad to throw him out
of her mouth again.
One day Tom went ploughing with his father,
who gave him a whip made of barley straw, to
drive the oxen with ; but an eagle, flying by,
caught him up in his beak, and carried him to
the top of a great giant’s castle. The giant
would have eaten Tom up; but the fairy
drawf scratched and bit his tongue, and held
on by his teeth till the giant in a passion took
him outagaiu and threw him into the sea, when
a very large fish swallowed him up directly.
The fish was caught soon after and sent as a
present to King Arthur, and when the cook
opened it there was Tom Thumb inside. He
was carried to the king, who was delighted
with the little man.
The king ordered a little chair to be made,
in order that Tom might sit on his table,
and also a palace of gold a span high, with a
door an inch wide, for little Tom to live in.
He also gave him a coach drawn by six small
mice.
This made the queen angry, because she
had not a new coach too ; therefore, resolv-
ing to ruin Tom, she complained to the king
that he had spoken insolently to her. The
king sent for him. Tom, to escape his fury,
crept into an empty snail shell, and lay there
till he was almost starved ; when peeping
out of the shell he saw a fine butterfly
settled on the ground : he now ventured
out, and getting on it, the butterfly took
wing, and mounted into the air with little
Tom on his back. Away he flew from field
to field, from tree to tree, till at last he flew
to the king’s court.
The king, queen, and nobles all strove to
catch the butterfly, but could not. At
length poor Tom. having neither bridle nor
saddle, slipped from his seat, and fell into
a pool of water, where he was found almost
drowned. The queen vowed he should be
beheaded, and while the scaffold was get-
ting ready, he was secured in a mouse-trap;
when the cat seeing something stir, and sup-
posing it to be a mouse, patted the trap about
till she broke it, and set Tom at liberty.
Sometimes Tom rode out on a mouse for a
horse. One day a big black cat met him along
the road, and wanted to kill the mouse. Tom
jumped off the mouse’s back, drew his sword,
and fought the cat, and made her run away.
In order to show his courage and please the
queen, the new knight undertook a terrible
adventure.
In one corner of the palace garden there was
found a great black spider, of which the lady
was much afraid.
Tom undertook to kill this insect ; so he took
a gold button for a shield, and his sharp needle-
sword, and went out to attack the spider ; the
knights went also, to witness the combat.
Tom drew his sword and fought valiantly, but
the spider’s poisonous breath overcame him.
King Arthur and his whole Court went into
mourning for little Tom Thumb. They buried
him under a rose-bush, and raised a nice white
marble monument oyer hi« cr-rare.


NAUGHTY BOYS.
Mr. Brown, the grocer, having nearly emptied a cask of sugar in front of his shop, a
number of naughty boys, seeing his back turned, commenced to steal some. Mr. Brown.
spying them through the window, came out, and the reader can see what happened- A
bystander informs us that muttered howls of agony arose from the cask , and all the boys'
interest in sugar was at an end.
BOY WHO STOLE OUT WITHOUT LEAVE.
I remember, I remember,
When i was a little Boy,
One fine morning in September
Uncle brought me home a toy.
I remember how he patted
Both my cheeks in his kindliest mood;
“Then,” said he, “you little Fat-head,
There’s a top because you’re good.”
Grandmamma —a shrewd observer —
1 remember gazed upon
My new top, and said with fervour,
“ Oh ! how kind of Uncle John.”
While mamma, my form caressing—
In her eyes the tear-drop stood,
Bead me this fine moral lesson,
“ what com* 1 # of being good.”
I remember, I remember,
On a wet and windy day,
One cold morning in December,
I stole out and went to play,
I remember Billy Hawkins
Came, and with his pewter squirt
Squibbed my pantaloons and stockings,
Till they were all over dirt.
To my mother for protection
I ran, quaking every limb ;
She exclaim’d, with fond affection,
“ Gracious goodness ! look at him !”
Pa cried, when he saw my garment,
Twas a newly purchased dress—
“ Oh 1 you nasty little Warmknt.
How came you in such a mesa ? ”
Then he caught me by the collar,
—Cruel only to be kind —
And to my exceeding dolour,
Gave me—several slaps behind.
Grandmamma, while yet L smarted,
As she saw my evil plight,
Said—‘twas rather stony-hearted—
“ Little rascal ! sarvk him right 1"
I remember, I remember,
From that sad and solemn day,
Never more in dark December
Did I venture out to play.
And the moral which they taught, I
Well remember : thus they said—
“ Little Boys, when they are naughty,
Must be whipp’d and sent to bed 1"


Dirty Jack.
There was one little Jack,
Not very long back,
And’t is said to his lasting disgrace,
That he never was seen
With his hands at all clean,
Nor yet ever clean was his face.
His friends were much hurt
To see so much dirt,
And often and well did they scour,
But all was in vain,
He was dirty again
Before they had done it an hour.
When to wash he was sent,
He reluctantly went
tVith water to splash himself o’er,
But he left the black streaks
Running down both his cheeks,
And made them look worse than before
The pigs in the dirt
Could not be more expert
Than he was, in grubbing about;
And people have thought
This gentleman ought
To be made with four legs and a snout.
The idle and bad
May, like to this lad,
Be dirty and black, to be sure,
But good boys are seen
To be decent and clean.
Although they be ever so poor.
Throwing Stones.
Johnny Jones, why do you do it?
Those who throw stones
Surely will rue it;
Little of pleasure, evil may flow,
Mischief past measure comes of a blow.
Yes, yes! stone flinging,
Laugh as you may.
Woe may be bringing
Upon you some day.
Someone is watching,
Armed by the law,
Truncheon from pocket
Soon he will draw.
Off he will march you—
Dreadful to think!—to a dark prison:
Light through a chink,
Bread without butter, water for drink
Dirty Dick.
Dirty, noisy, mischievous Dick,
Struggled and tore, and wanted to fight
Susan, the nurse, who in the bath
Began to wash him on Saturday night.
Her hair he tried to pull up by the roots,
The water he splashed all over the
floor,
Which ran downstairs, and one night
made
A terrible slop at the parlour door
To give him advice was waste of time,
So his father resolved to try a stick,
And never since then has he been called
Dirty, noisy, mischievous Dick
Boy that Stole the Apples.
A boy looked over a wall,
And spied some lovely apples;
" But,” says he "the tree is tall,
And belongs to ‘Grumpie Chappies! '
Still, I think some could be got
By a climbing lad like me;
I'll try and steal a lot,
So here goes up the tree "
The wall he then got over,
And up the tree he went ;
But Chappies, mowing clover,
Espied the wicked gent.
He let him fill his school-bag—
Get over the wall again ;
Rushed up and played at touch-tag,
Which surprised him much, and then:
Look at the Picture I 1 1
Mischievous Fingers.
Pretty little fingers,
Wherefore were they made ?
Like ten smart young soldiers,
All in pink arrayed.
Apt and quick obedient
To your lightest thought,
Doing in an instant
Everything they’re taught.
‘T was for play or study,
Pen to wield or ball;
Kite, top, needle, pencil,
Prompt at parents’ call.
Picking, poking, soiling
Costly things and dear,
Wracking, cracking, spoiling
All that they come near.
Thus't was with Robert Chivers,
Brandishing a swish,
Broke a vase to shivers
Filled with silver fish.
"Tick, tick," says the Dutch clock.
Robert fain would know
How its pendulum swinging
Made its wheels to go.
Why not ask ? No I foolish
Robert takes a stick,
Pokes and breaks the clock, which
Ceases soon to tick.
"Puff, puff.” sighs the bellows.
Robert wants to find,
Yet he will not ask, whence
Comes its stock of wind.
With a knife upripping,
Finds them void and flat.
Ah ! be sure a whipping
Robert caught, for that.
The Boy who Played with Fire.
Listen about a naughty boy
Who might have been a parent’s joy,
But that he had a strong desire
To always meddle with the fire
One day when his mamma went out,
She said "Mind, dear, what you 're about;
With your nice books and playthings
stay,
And with the fire, oh I do not play.”
But as soon as his mamma was gone,
And this bad boy left all alone,
Thought he, " In spite of all ma says,
Now we’ll have a glorious blaze.
" No one is by, 'l is quickly done,
And oh ! ’t will be such famous fun.”
Quick then about the hearth bestrewed
Some scraps of paper and of wood.
Then lighted them and drew them out
And with them, laughing, ran about.
But soon he changed his merry note—
The flames, alas, had caught his coat,
And every moment, mounting higher,
His body soon was all on fire;
And though he screamed with shriek
and shout,
No one came near to put it out;
So that it happened, sad to say,
That boy was burned to death that day.


Wicked Willie.
Willie was a wicked boy,
Snubbed his poor old mother ;
Willie was a dreadful boy,
Quarrelled with his brother;
Willie was a spiteful boy,
Often pinched his sister;
Once he gave her such a blow,
Raised a great big blister!
Willie was a sulky boy,
Sadly plagued his cousins ;
Often broke folks’ window panes,
Throwing stones by dozens ;
Often worried little girls,
Bullied smaller boys ;
Often broke their biggest dolls,
Jumped upon their toys.
If he smelt a smoking tart,
Willie longed to steal it;
If he saw a pulpy peach.
Willie tried to peel it;
Could he reach a new plum-cake,
Greedy Willie picked it;
If he spied a pot of jam,
Dirty Willie licked it.
If he saw a poor old dog,
Wicked Willie whacked it;
If it had a spot of white.
Silly Willie blacked it;
If he saw a sleeping cat,
Horrid Willie kicked it;
If he caught a pretty moth.
Cruel Willie pricked it.
If his pony would not trot,
Angry Willie thrashed it;
If he saw a clinging snail,
Thoughtless Willie smashed it;
If he found a sparrow’s nest,
Unkind Willie hit it.
All the mischief ever done,
Folks knew Willie did it.
No one liked that horrid boy,
Can you wonder at it ?
None who saw his ugly head,
Ever tried to pat it.
No one took him for a ride—
Folks too gladly skipped him ;
No one gave him bats or balls.
No one ever "tipped” him
No one taught him how to skate,
Or to play at cricket;
No one helped him if he stuck
In a prickly thicket.
Oh no ! for the boys all said
Willie loved to tease them,
And that if he had the chance,
Willie would not please them
And they shunned him every one,
And they would not know him ;
And their games and picture-books
They would never show him:
And their tops they would not spin,
If they saw him near them ;
And they treated him with scorn,
Till he learnt to fear them.
They all left him to himself,
And he was so lonely ;
But of course it was his fault,
Willie’s own fault only.
If a boy’s a wicked boy,
Shy of him folks fight then ;
If it makes him dull and sad,
Why, it serves him right then I
The Wicked, Rude, Bad, Naughty, Cross,
Nasty, Bold, Dirty-faced Boy.
Boys, stop your noise ! Girls, stop your jumping and
skipping !
While I tell you about a bad boy, who often deserves
a whipping.
If this boy to you were named, to speak to him you’d
feel ashamed,
So to-day I'll only say —He’s a wicked, rude, bad,
naughty, cross, nasty, bold, dirty-faced boy !
I won’t tell you his age, nor the colour of his hair,
Nor say anything about the clothes he sometimes does
wear;
You never see them neat and clean, and seldom without
a tear,
Because —He’s a wicked, rude, bad, naughty, cross,
nasty, bold, dirty-faced boy !
If he's sent on a message, such a long time he stops.
To pelt stones at Chinamen, and stare in the shops;
Running behind drays, and wastes time so many ways,
That when he gets home his mother says —
Oh you wicKed, rude, bad, naughty, cross, nasty, bold,
dirty-laced boy!
If his mother gives him lolly, cake, piece of beef or
mutton,
In a corner he’ll eat it by himself, he's such a nasty,
greedy glutton,
And he’ll smug from his playmates a marble, top, or
button,
That scarcely any one can with him have any fun.
Because—He’s such a wicked, rude, bad, naughty,
cross, nasty, bold, dirty-faced boy I
This is the Naughty Boy
who would go making Mud
Pies, and get his nice new
clothes all over mud.
He said he would be Good,
but he got into the mud,
and was a Naughty, Bad,
Bad Boy!!!
He's been going to school for years, I can’t tell you
how long,
If you ask him to spell three words, two are sure to be
wrong;
If you saw the dirty books and broken slate which to
him belong,
You’d easily guess from such a mess that—
He’s a wicked, rude, bad, naughty, cross, nasty, bold,
dirty-faced boy !
You can’t believe a word he says, he tells so many
lies;
He’s such a coward, he’ll only hit a girl, or boy much
less than his size,
But if he gets a blow himself, he howls, bawls, yelps,
and cries,
That anyone who sees him never tries to please him.
Because—He’s a wicked, rude, bad, naughty, cross,
nasty, bold, dirty-faced boy !
He won’t play any game without being always
cheating.
I often wonder how he so many times escapes a
beating,
And he never says grace before or after eating,
He’s scarcely better in the least than a brute beast.
Because—He’s a wicked, rude, bad. naughty, cross,
nasty, bold, dirty-faced boy !
What school he goes to at present I won’t tell,
But I mean to watch him. and if he don’t mind and
behave well,
I’ll go to every school and ring a little bell.
I’ll make a great noise, and show all the girls and bovs
This wicked, rude, bad. naughty, cross, nasty, bold
dirty-faced boy


This is the Man who picked the Bad Boy
out of the Mud.
Little Chinkey Chow-Chow
THE BOY THAT RAN AWAY.
There was a little Chinese boy,
That ran away from home—
*• Ha ! ha I” he said, *‘ I’ll see the world
And through the streets I’ll roam.
" I won’t go any more to school,
Or go so soon to bed,
Nor yet be scolded if I choose
To stand upon my head.”
So little Chinkey ran away,
His tail flew in the wind;
He thought n t of his good mamma
Who was so very kind :
He knew she could not follow him
Along the crowded street,
Because mammas in China have
Such very tiny feet.
Now, as he went along he saw
Such strange and lovely sights,
Such pretty painted houses —
Such tops ! and oh ! such kites I
He saw so many gilded toys,
And ivory things so white,
That he forgot about the time
Until he found it night.
Ah ! then he saw such fireworks I
They glistened in his eyes ;
The crackers and the lanterns too
Quite took him by surprise.
He listened to the music of
The fiddle and the gong,
And felt that it was jolly, though
He knew that it was wrong.
But after that he seemed to think
Things were not quite so bright;
The men were going, and there came
The watchman of the night;
And sleep was stealing over him,
He scarce could lift his head,
So he lay on the cold, cold stones,
Which served him for a bed.
Little Chinkey Chow-Chow
Woke up with early light,
And wandered far away from where
He passed the dreary night ;
He was so very worn and cold,
And sadly wanted food,
So he sat down upon a well
In not a pleasant mood
He saw the well was very deep,
The water too was clear,
And soon he saw a golden fish
That looked so very near,
He stretched his hand to catch the fish;
But oh 1 how sad to tell,
He tumbled over and he sank
To the bottom of the well.
Some other boys were playing there
And saw him disappear,
And ran along the road to see
If anyone was near.
A Great BIG Market Gardener,
Was soon upon the ground,
And caught ur little Chinkey up,
Who soon would have been drowned.
The boys began to jeer at him,
For he was very wet;
They pulled his dripping tail, an called
Him names that I forget.
One took his wooden shoes away,
Another took his hat,
And someone said, ‘‘lt served him right,'
Now only think of that!
When little Chinkey ran away,
His tail flew in the wind ;
But when our Chinkey turned again
His tail hung down behind.
He wandered past the painted shops
Where they put up the tea.
And I am sure the boys at school
Were happier than he.
Poor Chinkey Chow was very tired,
And very sore his feet,
When soon his mother saw him from
The corner of a street.
She said he was a wicked boy,
And ought to have a smack !
And yet I think she loved him more
Because she'd got him back
Now when I see a Chinaman,
And that is every day,
I wonder if he is. grown up,
The boy that ran away.
But what I still think most about
When I this story tell,
Is the GREAT BIG Market Gardener
That raised him from the well.

BOY LAND.
That Nice Boy.
"Nice child—very nice child,” observed an old
gentleman, crossing to the other side of the car
and addressing the mother of the boy who had
just hit him in the eye with a wad of paper. " How
old are you, my son ? ”
"None of your business,” replied the youngster,
taking aim at another passenger.
" Fine boy,” smiled the old man, as the parent
regarded her offspring with pride. "A remarkably
fine boy. What is your name, my son ?"
" Puddin* Tame I” shouted the youngster, with
a giggle at his own wit
"I thought so," continued the old man, pleas-
antly. "If you had given me three guesses at it,
that would have been the first one I would have
■truck on. Now, Puddin , you can blow those
things pretty straight, can’t you?”
"You bet I " squealed the boy, delighted at the
compliment. "See me take that old fellow over
there I "
"No, no!” exclaimed the old gentleman, hastily.
"Try it on the old woman I was sitting with
She has boys of her own, and she won't mind ”
"Can’t you hit the lady for the gentleman.
Johnny ? ” asked the fond parent
Johnny cleverly landed the pellet on the end of
the old woman's nose
But she did mind it. and rising in her wrath
soared down on the small boy like a hawk. She
put him over the line, reversed him, ran him
backwards, till he didn't know which end of him
was front, and finally dropped him into the lap of
the scared mother, with a benediction whereof the
purport was that she'd be back in a moment and
skin him alive
"She didn’t seem to like it. Puddin’,” smiled the
old gentleman, softly. " She’s a perfect stranger
to me; but I understand she is the matron of an
Orphans' Home, and I thought she would like a
little fun, but I was mistaken "
And the old man sighed sweetly as he went back
to his seat He was sorry for the poor little boy,
out he couldn’t help it.
A Wicked Boy.
Of all the small boys in our town
That Jones boy was the worst,
And if the "bad man" came around
He’d take that Jones boy first.
One day he slipped away from home
And went out for a skate
Down on a deep and dangerous pond
Beyond the garden gate.
His mother missed him after a while,
And thought he’d gone to skate ;
And running to the fatal pond,
She found she was too late
For there, upon the cruel ice.
Beyond an air-hole wide,
She saw his pretty little hat,
A mitten by its side
He was her boy, and all the love
That fills a mother’s heart
Came forth in tears and sobs and moans
Beyond the strength of art.
She called the neighbours quick to come
They scraped along the ground.
Beneath the water and the ice—
The boy could uot be found.
At last their search was given up
Until a thaw should come ;
The mother’s sobs began afresh.
Her sorrow was not dumb
They turned to leave the fatal pool.
A voice came clear and free —
"Hallo! if you want Frankie Jones,
You'll find him up this tree ”
l’bnvoi.
And so it was—the mother's tears
Were changd to smiles of joy ;
But, gracious Heaven, how she spanked
Her darling, fair-haired boy 1
Cooley’s Boy.
The boy not only preys upon my
melon-patch and fruit trees, and upon
those of my neighbours, but he has an
extraordinary aptitude for creating a dis-
turbance in whatever spot he happens
to be. Only last Sunday he caused such
a terrible commotion in church that
I the services had to be suspended for
several minutes until he could be re-
moved. The interior* of the edificw was painted
and varnished recently, and I suppose one of the
workmen must have left a clot of varnish upon the
back of Cooley’s pew, which is directly across the
aisle from mine. Cooley’s boy was the only repre-
sentative of the family at church upon that day,
and he amused himself during the earlier portions
of the service by kneeling upon the seat and com-
muning with Dr. Jones's boy, who occupied the
pew immediately in the rear Sometimes, when
young Cooley would resume a proper position,
Jones's boy would stir him up afresh by slyly pull-
ing his hair, whereupon Cooley would wheel about
and menace Jones with his fist in a manner which
betrayed utter indifference to the proprieties of the
place and the occasion, as well as to the presence
of the congregation When Cooley finally sank
into a condition of repose, he placed his head, most
unfortunately, directly against the lump of undried
varnish, while he amused himself by reading the
commandments and the other scriptural texts upon
the wall behind the pulpit.
In a few moments he attempted to move, but the
varnish had mingled with his hair, and it held him
securely. After making one or two desperate but
ineffectual efforts to release himself, he became
very angry; and supposing that Jones s boy was
holding him, he shouted :
“ Leg go o’ my hair ! go o’ my hair, I tell
you 1 ”
The clergyman paused just as he was entering
upon consideration of “ secondly,” and the congre-
gation looked around in amazement, in time to
perceive young Cooley, with his head against the
back of the pew, aiming dreadful blows over his
shoulder with his fist at some unseen person behind
him And with every thrust he exclaimed :
•• i'll smash yer nose after church ! I’ll go for
you. Bill Jones, when I ketch you alone I Leg go
o’ my hair, I tell you. or I’ll knock the stuffin’ ont
o’ yer,” etc., etc.
Meanwhile, Jones's boy sat up at t ie very end of
his pew, far away from Cooley, and looked as
solemn as if the sermon had made a deep impres-
sion upon him — Max Apelkr.


Jack the Glutton.
"Do look at those pigs, as they lay in the
straw,"
Little Richard said to his papa;
"They keep eating longer than ever I saw,
What nasty fat gluttons they are!"
"I see they are feasting” his father replied,
"They eat a great deal I allow;
But let us remember, before we deride,
'Tis the nature, my dear, of a sow.
“But when a great boy, such as you, my
dear Dick,
Does nothing but eat all the day
And keep sucking good things till he makes
himself sick,
What a glutton! indeed, we may say.
"When plumcake and sugar for ever he picks,
And sweetmeats, and comfits, and
figs:
Pray let him get rid of his own nasty
tricks,
And then he may laugh at the pigs.
Tom the Dainty Boy.
Never be dainty and throw food away;
'Tis sinful, as you must have heard many
say;
Besides, you yourself may require food
some day.
Though well fed.
So don't smell your plate and turn over
your food,
And doubt if it’s wholesome, or pleasant,
or good;
Such conduct is not only senseless, —
but rude
And ill-bred.
Thertf was a young boy, who so dainty
became,
That whether his dinner was fish, flesh,
or game.
He turned up his nose at them all, just
the same,
And would cry,
“I cannot eat this," —and, "Ido not like
that;" —
"This chicken’s too lean," —and
"That mutton’s too fat;
The dog he may eat it it up all, or the
cat,
But not I.
The consequence was that he soon became thin;
His bones they stuck out, and his cheeks they
sunk in,
And his hands were not stronger nor thicker
than tin,
If so strong.
And his legs grew as slender as little hat-pegs,
And almost as small was his waist as his legs;
And he looked like the laths that are fastened
round kegs,
Thin and long.
And thinner, and thinner, and thinner he grew,
A shadow had been rather fat, of the two;
In fact, you might easily look him right through,
If you tried.
And when he was quite to a skeleton grown,
As weak as a reed, and as cold as a stone
He fell all to pieces, and with a faint groan.
So be died
Boy that robbed the Birds’ nest.
"To-whit! To-whit! To-whee!
Will you listen to me?
Who stole four eggs I laid,
And the nice nest I made?"
"Not I,” said the cow. “Oh, no;
Such a thing I'd never do;
I gave you a wisp of hay,
But didn't take your nest away"
"Coo, coo! said the dove,
I'll speak a word my love;
Who stole that pretty nest
From a little red breast ?"
"Not I," said the sheep "Oh no.
I wouldn’t treat a poor bird so;
I gave wool the nest to line,
But the nest was none of mine,"
“Caw! Caw I" cried the crow,
•• I should like to know
What thief took away
A bird’s nest to-day.
“Cluck! Cluck!" said the hen,
Don’t ask me again!
Why I hav’nt a chick
Would do such a trick
We all gave her a feather,
And she wove them together;
I'd scorn to intrude
On her and her brood."
“Chirr-a-whirr! Chirr-a-whirr 1
We will make a great stir;
Let us find out his name,
And all cnr for shame I"
"I would not rob a bird,"
Said little Mary Green;
"I think I never heard
Of anything so mean."
'"Tis very cruel, too,"
Said little Alice Neil:
" I wonder if he knew
How sad the bird would feel ?"
A little boy hung down his head,
And hid his face so crimson red;
For he stole that pretty nest
From little robin redbreast;
And he felt so full of shame.
I do not like to tell his name
But during the next week
Dressed in his Sunday best
This boy set out to seek
All for another nest.
He robbed a nest up high,
Suspended in a tree;
Two birds came through the sky,
What happened you can see
Cruel Boy.
What! go to see the kittens drowned
On purpose in the yard!
I did not think there could be found
A little heart so hard.
Poor kittens! No more pretty play
With pussy’s wagging tail:
Why! I’d go far enough away
Before I’d see the pail.
Poor things! the little child that can
Be pleased to go and see,
Most likely, when he grows a man,
A cruel man will be.
And many a wicked thing he’ll do
Because his heart is hard:
A great deal worse than killing you,
Poor kittens, in the yard.
Tyrannical Pat.
What became of tyrannical Pat,
Who pelted the dog. and beat the
cat,
Why, puss scratched his face and
tore his hat;
And Dash knocked him over as
flat as a mat.
Mind thatl
The little hoy who bit his Nails.
See here a naughty boy, John Thales,
Who had a shocking way
Of picking at his finger nails,
And biting them all day.
And though he had, like other boys,
Both soldiers, kites, and drums,
He liked, much better than these toys,
His fingers and his thumbs.
Boy who tore his Hat.
Above on a chair, a little boy sat,
For he had torn his nice new hat;
And so was punished for doing that
Thief Charley.
Charley, Charley, stole the barley
Out of the baker's shop;
The baker came out, and gave him a clout.
And made that Charley hop


Snook’s Patent Whipping Machine for Flogging Naughty Boys in School.
“ The Snooks’ Whipping Machine hat proved a total failure." — Times.
Declaration of a Distracted Schoolmaster.
A year ago I took charge of a school of 1000 boys. They were a very
bad lot indeed, and 1 could do nothing with them, Being of a mild dis-
position, 1 attempted to reason with them ; but I might as well have
reasoned with the pigs. I then thought of punishing them, but that was
a big task, and, besides, what mode of punishment should I adopt ? In
my utmost perplexity I wrote to Professor Wilderspin—a great authority
on the management of boys—and he wrote as follows :—“Nearly all boys
can be managed by an intelligent schoolmaster without punishment, but in
a few cases it seems impossible to do without it. In every large school in
England, Ireland, and Scotland some corporeal punishment is used, and
some must continue to be used as long as very vicious children continue to
exist, or as long as parents spoil their children by over indulgence or by
wilful criminal neglect before they send them to school. —Yours truly,
Professor Wilderspin.’ I then wrote to twenty-seven of the principal head-
masters in the world, and the following are the replies
From the High School of Eton wrote head-master, Mr. Squeers :
“ If they don’t behave as they should do, why, soundly box their ears ”
From the Grammar School of Harrow wrote head-master, Mr. Phfool ;
“ If they do not behave themselves, expel them from the school.”
From the Training School of Rugby wrote head master, Mr. Wist:
“Just take a handful of their hair, and give a sharp, short twist."
From the College School of Oxford wrote Professor Rarey Hook :
“ Instead of nearly killing, overawe them with a look.”
From the Bible School of Cambridge wrote Professor William Brying :
“Well whip them with a birchen rod, and never mind their crying."
From the Blue Coat School of London wrote Professor Rupert Gower :
“ At arm’s length make them hold a book the space of half-an-hour."
From the Naval School of Liverpool wrote head master Mr. Jointer :
“Just rap them on the knuckles with a common teacher’s pointer.”
,• rom the People's School of Manchester wrote head-master, Mr. Flowers:
“ Make them kneel down as still as death for just about two hours."
From the Infant School of Birmingham wrote Professor Dory Heller :
“ Just put on them a fool’s cap, marked ‘dunce,’ ‘thief,’ or ‘story-teller.’ ”
From the Charity School of Sheffield wrote head-master, Mr. Clay :
“ If the boys are disobedient, do not let them out to play.”
From the Gentleman’s School at Brighton wrote Professor Robert Flask ;
“ If the boys will act unruly, why, just make them do a task.”
From the National School of Bristol wrote Professor Mark Groom :
“ If the hoys are extra naughty, shut them in a dark room."
From the District School of Edinburgh wrote head-master, Mr. Glass :
“ The naughty boys should all be sent to the bottom of the class.
From the Mixed School of Glasgow wrote Professor Duncan Law :
“ To keep a proper kind of school, just use the three-tailed taw. ’
From the Latin School of Dublin wrote Professor Patrick Clayrence :
“ If the boys are very bad boys, write a letter to their parents.’
From the Mission School, Calcutta, wrote the Rev. Mr. Mac Look :
“ Try them by a boy jury, write the verdict in a black-book. ’
From the Lyceum of New York wrote Professor Henry Bothing
Take your delinquent boys one hour and make them sit on nothing.
From the Public School, Chicago, wrote head-master, Mr. Norrids :
“ If they will not behave themselves, why, just you snap their foreheads.”
From the Academy of San Francisco wrote head-master, .Mr. Power :
“ Make them stoop and hold their fingers upon the floor for just an hour."
From the Mormon School of Utah wrote Professor Orson Pratt :
“ First strip and make them fast, and then just use the little cat."
From the King’s College, Lisbon, wrote Professor Don Cassiers :
“ If you want to make them good boys, pull, pinch, and twist their ears.”
From the Cadet’s School of Paris wrote Professor Monsieur Sour :
“ Just make them hold their hands above their heads for one full hour,”
From the Royal School of Amsterdam wrote Professor Vander Tooler :
“ If they will not behave themselves, just trounce them with a ruler.”
From the Model School of Pekin wrote Professor Cha Han Coo :
“ Just put their hands into the stocks and beat with a bamboo.”
From the Normal School of Moscow wrote Professor Ivan Trout :
“ To make your boys the best of boys, why, you must use the knout."
From the Muslim School of Cairo wrote the Mufti, Pasha Saido :
“ Upon the bare soles of their feet give them the bastinado,”
From the Common School of Berlin wrote Professor Von de Rind :
“ There’s nothing like the old, old way that ever I could find ;
Just lay them right across your knee and cane them well behind.
I’ve only just been speaking mit mine goot frien’, Doctor Whistim,
And he says that it does no harm, but is felt throughout the system.
At last, as I was thinking deep how puzzling all this looks
I received a tempting offer from a certain Mr. Snooks
His “ great machine to whip with speed ” I bought with flusteration,
But to see just how it did succeed you view the illustration,
And then look eU “ Profunor Cole't Gentle Persuader," next page.

DOLLY LAND
My Lady Doll.
My Lady-doll is pretty.
My is sweet;
I like to show my Lady-doll
To every one I meet
My Sweet Dolly Rose.
O sweet, so sweet,
Is my Dolly Rose !
Just all that I know
My Dolly knows;
And when I am glad
The darling is glad.
And when I am sad
The darling is sad
How dear she is,
O, nobody knows,
No, no, not even
My precious Rose
Polly’s Dolly.
Shining eyes, very blue,
Opened very wide;
Yellow curls, very stiff,
Hanging side by side;
Chubby cheeks, very pink
Lips red as holly ;
No ears, and only thumbs-
That's Polly's Dolly
Pretty Doll.
Oh dear ! what a beautiful doll
My sister has bought at the fair
She says I must call it Miss Poll,
And make it a bonnet to wear
Oh pretty new doll, it looks fine!
Its cheeks are all covered with red ;
But pray will it always be mine ?
And please may I take it to bed ?
How kind was my sister to buy
This dolly with hair that will curl,
Perhaps, if you want to know why.
It'« because T have been a good girl

Pussy and Doggy Fighte
ing for Dolly.
And once. I remember.
Oh, sad was the day.
The cat answered back
In an impudent way.
And Tray was so jealous,
The two had a fight,
And between them the doll
Was a terrible fright
Puss’s Doll.
Now Puss had a doll
That Dame Trot bought to
please her,
And gave it the beautiful
Name of Louisa.
And when Kitty was lonesome
Or wanted to play,
She'd cry for Loo ! Ix>o I
In a comical way.
The dolly was petted,
Was kissed and caressed,
Though often quite roughly
It must be confessed.
And so pleased was Miss Puss
With Louisa's fair charms
She took her cat's meat,
With the doll in her arms


Dolly Tumbled out of Bed.
'Tis very well to smile—now,
But you gave me such a fright,
When I missed you, darling Dolly,
In the middle of the night.
I thought we played together,
And you fell into a stream;
Yet I said —just half awaking—
•* 'Tis nothing but a dream,
" For safe upon my pillow
Lies her curly golden hair,"
Then I reached my hand to touch
you,
But I couldn’t find you there
I felt so sad and lonely
That I cried, but all in vain ;
So to see if I could find you,
I went off to sleep again.
Now, fancy I in the morning
There you were, all safe and right;
And nurse said, " Here’s poor Dolly,
Been upon the floor all night I"
Your pretty curls are tangled,
They were so nice and smooth
before;
So promise, Dolly darling,
You will tumble out no more!
Dolly and I.
I love my dear dolly ;
I’ll tell you her name,
I called her "Sweet Polly"
The day that she came.
My Uncle John brought her
From over the sea ;
And no one shall part us,
My dolly and me.
She has cheeks like red roses,
And eyes blue and bright,
That open with daylight.
And close with the night
She cries, and says," Mam ma,
Mam-mam-ma," so well,
That it is not a baby
You scarcely can tell
You know, I’m her own ma ;
A small one, you'll say,
But just right for dolly,
Who wants nought but play
No teaching, no training,
Few clothes and no food ;
And I like being her ma.
Because she & so aood
Dolly’s Broken Arm.
Mamma, do send for Doctor Man,
And tell him to be quick,
My dolly fell and broke her arm,
So she is very sick.
I thought that she was fast asleep,
And laid her on her bed,
But down she dropped upon the floor;
O dear! she’s almost dead!
Poor dolly! she was just as brave,
And did no* cry at all;
Do you suppose she ever can
Get over such a fall ?
But when the doctor mends her arm,
And wraps it up so tight,
Then I will be her little nurse,
And watch her all the night
And if she only will get well,
And does not lose her arm,
I’ll never let her fall again,
Nor suffer any harm.
Little Polly.
Little Polly,
Had a dolly.
With a curly wig ;
And Miss Polly
And her dolly,
Often danced a jig
Also Polly
Had a collie,
A fine dog was he ;
Blithe and jolly,
Jumped round Polly,
Barking loud with glee
One day Polly
Knocked her dolly,
Broke its pretty head
"Oh, fie, Polly I
Don’t hurt dolly,"
Said her brother Ned
Then did Polly
Take up Dolly,
Throw it on the floor
Said Miss Polly,
In her folly
"I will play no more."
Up ran collie,
Seized poor dolly,
Ran off to a friend
Friend helped collie
To tear dolly—
That was poor s end

A Little Girl’s Song to
Her Golly.
Lie down, little Dolly,
Lie still on my lap,
It is time now to put on
Your night dress and cap ;
You have not been to sleep
All through this long day—
Oh, what a long time
For a Dolly to play!
The bright sun went down
More than two hours ago ;
It is long past your bedtime,
You very well know :
The stars are now peeping
From out the blue skies;
Then go to sleep, Dolly!
Come, shut your blue eyes
Mamma says the flowers
Were asleep long ago—
Sweet roses and lilies,
Their heads bending low ;
She says ’tis a lesson
For me and for you—
That children and dollies
Should be asleep too.
Hark ! Susan is calling—
Now out goes the light ;
I will tuck you up snugly.
And kiss you good night.
It is time you were sleeping ;
For do you not know
The dear little birds
Went to sleep long ago ?
Don’t Cry My Dolly.
Hushy, baby, my dolly,
I pray you don’t cry,
And I’ll give you some bread
And some milk by and by;
Or perhaps you like custard,
Or may be a tart, —
Then to either you’re welcome,
With all my whole heart
The Little Girl and
Her Doll.
There, go to sleep, Dolly,
In own mother’s lap,
I’ve put on your nightgown
And neat little cap.
So sleep, pretty baby,
And shut up your eye,
Bye-bye, little Dolly,
Lie still, and bye-bye
I’ll lay my clean handkerchief
Over your head,
And then make believe
That my lap is your bed ;
So hush, little dear,
And be sure you don’t cry,
Bye-bye, little Dolly,
Lie still, and bye-bye
There, now it is morning
And time to get up,
And I’ll give you some milk
In my doll’s china cup,
So wake, little baby
And open your eye,
For I think it high time
To have done with bye-hye,
Jane Taylor.
Sleep, Dolly Sleep.
Sleep, Dolly, sleep.
You must not, must not weep
Now close your eyes so brown,
And let me lay you down
Sleep, Dolly, sleep
Wake, Dolly, wake,
Too long a nap you take,
Its time to make the tea.
And you must help, you see
Wake, Dolly, wake.
Run. Dolly, run,
Run out in golden sun ;
Run up the hill with me,
And then to the apple-tree
Run, Dolly, run
Mrs HiRFRRff
My Dolly.
Shut your eyes, my darling!
When the shadows creep,
When the flowers are closing.
Little ones must sleep
Don't be frightened. Dolly !
In my arms you lie ,
Nestle down, and slumber
To my lullaby
Dolly is so active,
Always full of fun,
Wakeful still and smiling
E’en when day is done
Hush thee now, my dearest,
To my slumber-song;
Children lose their roses,
Sitting up too long
My Dolly.
I must go home to dolly,
And put her to bed ;
I know she’s so tired,
She can’t raise her head
Some dolls are so old,
They can sit up till eight ;
But mine gets quite ill
If she stays up so late !
Dolly’s Asleep.
Tell me a story
J ust one, mother dear ;
Candles are coming
Bedtime is near.
There is my hand to hold
Bend down your head,
Don't speak too loud, mother,
Dolly’s in bed
No! not the story
Of old Jack and Jill
They were so stupid C
To tumble down hill
I’m tired of Jack Horner
And Little 80-peep,
Stay ! let me see
If Dolly’s asleep
Hush, Dolly darling!
I’m watching, you know
No one shall hurt you ;
I will not go.
You are so warm, —
Like a bird in its nest
Go to sleep, darling,—
Rest, Dolly, rest.
Ah ! there is Mary
Just come with a light;
Now there’s no time
For a story to-night,
Please make the boys, mother,
Mind how they tread,
Their boots are so heavy,
And —Dolly’s in bed.
Good-night, dear mother I
Ask papa, please,
When he comes home,
Not to cough or to sneeze
Give me your hand, Mary
Hush ! softly creep ;
We must not wake her, —
Dolly's asleep.
If at all restless
Or wakeful she seems,
Don’t be too anxious ;
I fancy she dreams.
Say to hier softly,
Just shaking your head,
" Go to sleep, Dolly,—
Adie's in bed."
HUSH!

Talking to Dolly.
Well, Dolly, what are you saying,
Whrn yon blink and wink your
eyes ?
I'm sure your thoughts are straying,
For you look so very wise.
I wonder what you think about,
And why you never talk,
And how it is you never shout,
And never try to walk !
I wonder if you’re ever sad,
And if you ever weep ;
I wonder if you're ever glad
When I rock you off to sleep
I wonder if you love me well—
As well as I love you
I do so wish you’d try and tell;
Come, Dolly, darling, do f
Darling Dolly.
Darling Dolly’s house shall be
High as lofty apple-tree ;
It shall have a floor inlaid,
Of the sweetest light and shade.
It shall have for pictures fair
Fancies that are rich and rare ;
It shall have a golden roof,
And tapestry with stars for woof.
And it shall have a dome of blue
With the moonlight stealing through;
And stately pillars, straight as firs,
Bending to each wind that stirs.
Darling Dolly's house shall be
High as lofty apple-tree ;
It shall have a floor inlaid,
Of the sweetest light and shade

Lost Dolly.
The sunflowers hang their heavy heads
And wish the sun would shine;
The clouds are grey ; the wind is cold.
" Where is that doll of mine ?
The dark is coming fast," said she.
" I’m in a dreadful fright.
1 don t know where I left my doll,
And she’ll be out all night
" Twice up and down the garden-walks
1 looked ; but she’s not there.
Oh ! yes, I’ve hunted in the hay ;
I’ve hunted everywhere.
I must ha ,- e left her out of doors,
But she is not in sight
No Dolly in the summer-house,
And she’ll be out all night.
"The dew will wet her through and
through
And spoil her dear best dress;
And she will wonder where 1 am
And be in such distress;
The dogs may find her in the grass,
And bark or even bite ;
And all the bats will frighten her
That fly about at night.
*• I’ve not been down into the woods
Or by the brook to-day
I'm sure I had her in my arms
When I came out to play,
Just after dinner; then I know,
I watched Tom make his kite.
Will anybody steal my doll
If she stays out all night,
" I wonder where Papa has gone ?
Why, here he comes ; and see
He’s bringing something in his hand ;
That’s Dolly certainly !
And so you found her in the chaise,
And brought her home all right?
I’ll take her to the baby-house
I'm glad she’s home to night."

Off went Nannie, proud lip curling,
Head uplifted in disdain,
Bessie hugged her dolly closely,
Laughing over truth so plain.
** Nan was envious, Dolly darling,
'Twasn’t aught of wrong in you,
But the trouble lay in Nannie,
She would like to own you too."
"Such a doll I I wouldn’t have it,
With its trailing baby dress!
Pooh ! a dolly twice as handsome
I could have for asking, Bess.
Needn't ask me if it's pretty,
No, I do not care to wait,
I am in an awful hurry,
If you keep me I’ll be late."

Ten little dollies
Standing in a line,
One tumbled down,
And then there were nine
Nine little dollies
Sitting up so late,
One went to sleep
Then there were eight
Eight little dollies—
All their ages even,
One grew up tall
Then there were seven
Seven little dollies,
Full of funny tricks,
One snapt her head off
Then there were six.
Six little dollies—
Looked almost alive,
One lost her "pin-back,"
Then there were five
Five little dollies.
Walking by a door,
One got her nose pinched,
Then there were four
Four little dollies
On their mamma's knee,
One cried her eyes out,
Then there were three
Three little dollies,
Didn't know what to do,
One tore her bows off,
Then there were two
Two little dollies,
Very fond of fun.
One melts her nose off,
Then there was one

Living all alone,
Died broken hearted,
And then there w as none

My Week.
On Monday I wash my dollies' clothes,
On Tuesday smoothly press 'em;
On Wednesday mend their little hose,
On Thursday neatly dress 'em
On Friday I play they’re taken ill,
On Saturday something or other;
But when Sunday comes, I say, “ Lie still;
Tm going to church with mother.”
Dirty Dolly.
Naughty Miss Dolly played out in the
mud,
And got all her clothes quite black ;
And now such a rubbing, and scrubbing,
and tubbing
As we have to give them, good lack !
'Tis hard to be mothers and laundresses
too.
And nurses and cooks beside
Grown people don’t know all we chicks
have to do.
For how can they tell till they’ve tried?
Washing Day Troubles.
I know a little girl who tried.
To wash her dolly’s clothes, one day,
In Bridget’s great, big tub, and cried
Because mamma sent her away
To find her own small dolly-tub.
More fit for little girls to use
But naughty Sally shook her head
And all suggestions did refuse
And when she found her&lf alone.
She went to Bridget’s tub again,
But, as is sure to be the case,
Her disobedience brought her pain
For, what do you think? she tumbled in,
And gave herself an awful fright.
And no one pitied her; in fact,
They all laughed at her in her plight
Washing Dolly.

Before she dresses for the street

'Tis time Doll Rosy had a bath,
And she’ll be good, I hope;
She likes the water well enough,
But doesn't like the soap
Now soft I’ll rub her with a sponge,
Here eyes and nose and ears,
And splash her fingers in the bowl
And never mind the tears.
There now—oh, my ! what have I
done ?
I’ve washed the skin off—see !
Her pretty pink and white are gone

The New Tea-Things.
Come, Dolly, come quick,
For I want you to see
The present mamma
Has just given to me :
A set of new tea-things
That really hold tea,
A dear little teapot
To keep the tea hot,
And tiny white cups
With a pretty blue spot,
And a glass sugar-basin.
How nice, is it not ?
And I am to use them
This same afternoon;
So Dolly, I'll give you
Some tea very soon
In a little white cup,
With a saucer and spoon.

Doll Dress-making.
Making Dolly’s dresses,
Don't you think it’s fun ?
Here is one already,
This I've just begun.
Oh, how many stitches !
And such tangly thread!

I just guess it bled.
There! the needle’s broken—
Bending all about—
That’s a sign my dolly'll

Dolly Town.
Have you ever been down to
Dolly Town ?
The sight would do you good
There the dollies walk,
And the dollies talk,
And they ride about
In a grand turn-out,
With a coachman thin
Who is made of tin,
And a footman made of wood
There are very fine houses in
Dolly Town,
Red, and green, and blue ;
And a doctor, too,
Who has much to do,
Just to mend their toes
And their arms and nose,
When they tumble down
And crack their crown :
And the stuff they take is glue
But the finest sight in Dolly Town
That place to children dear—
Is no dolly at all,
Though so neat and small
If you’ve time to spare,
Go on tiptoe there ;
See the pretty girl, the rose, the
pearl,

My Little Doll Rose.
I have a little doll,
I take care of her clothes,
She has soft flaxen hair,
And her name is Rose
She has pretty blue eyes,
And a very small nose,
And a cunning little mouth,
And her name is Rose.
I have a little sofa
Where my dolly may repose.
Or sit up like a lady ;
And her name is Rose
My doll can move her arms,
And stand upon her toes,
She can make a pretty curtsey
My dear little Rose.
How old is your dolly?
Very young, I suppose,
For she cannot go alone,
My pretty little Rose.
Indeed I cannot tell
In poetry or prose,
How beautiful she is,

Such a busy little mother !
Such a pretty little "child ”!
Did you ever see a dolly
With a face more sweet and mild ?
Such a comfort to her mother,
Who is busy all the day,
And who never finds a moment
With her little girl to play.
There are dresses to be altered,
There are aprons to be made,
For my child in wardrobe matters
Must not be thrown in shade."

The Lost Doll.
I once had a sweet little doll, dears,
The prettiest doll in the world;
Her cheeks were so red and so white,
dears,
And her hair was so charmingly curled.
But I lost my poor little doll, dears,
As 1 played in the heath one day;
And I cried for her more than a week,
dears,
But I never could find where she lay.
I found my poor little doll, dears,
As I played in the heath one day;
Folks say she is terribly changed, dears,
For her paint is all washed away,
And her arms trodden off by the cows,
dears,
And her hair not the least bit curled;
Yet for old sakes’ sake she is still, dears,
The prettiest doll in the world.

Counterpane.
Oh, Mary, see what nurse has found,
Such store of pieces in my box!
Some green, and some with lilac ground,
They’ll make such lovely blocks.
She says she’ll teach me how to make
A counterpane for Dolly’s bed ;
This lovely piece I first will take,
With sprays of roses white and red
And then this piece with purple spots
Will look so pretty next to that!
I'll keep my cotton free from knots,
And make my stitches neat and flat.
And “when I’ve finished it," she says
She'll line it with a square of white
Oh, Dolly dear ! your little bed

The Wooden Doll.
I'm but a little wooden doll,
Have neither wit nor grace;
And very clumsy in my joints
And yet I know my place.
Most people laugh at a wooden doll,
And wooden I may be,
But little children love me much
And that’s enough for me.
When I am dressed in fine long clothes,
In fur, and silk, and lace.
I think myself I’m not so bad :
And yet I know my place.
Let people laugh—l know I’m wood ;
Wax I can never be ;
But little children think I'm grand—
That’s quite enough for me.

Come buy my dolls, my pretty dolls;
Come buy my dolls, I pray ;

And dollies made of gum ;

And some are tall,
Some talk, and some are dumb.

All beauties in their way —

So low in price,

Dolls in all the stages.

Such bargains as are these

Doctor Charlie and His
Patient.
Rnn for the doctor !
Dolly's very sick !
Mary, you’ll have to go,
I cannot leave her ;
Tell him to pack his bottles
And come quick;
I think she has got
A very dangerous fever."
In stalks a hat and cane;
If you look close,
You’ll see young Doctor Charlie,
Somewhere under ;
He takes a pinch of snuff
And blows his nose,
While poor sick Dolly
Seems to stare in wonder
He feels her pulse, he
Gravely shakes his head :
His hat dropped o’er his eyes
With the shake he gave it;
He says poor dolly
Must be put to bed
And have her bead shaved—
He, in fact, will shave it.
Poor mamma sober looks,
But says at once
That “ Dolly's head shall
Not be shaved ! I guess not!
Her hair would never grow
Again, you dunce!"
"It shall!” "It shan’t!"
" She'll die then, if it is not!”
But Mary, ere the quarrel
Gets too grave
(Already in her hand
A bowl of gruel),
Says, " Don't you know
That doctors do not shave ?
And then besides,
It really would be cruel!"
" I’ll give her pills, then,
When she’s safe in bed,
Plenty and sweet—of sugar
I will make them ;
As dolly cannot eat,
Twill do instead
For you and me and
Mai r her* to take them '
Dollies’ Broken Noses.
Two little babies
In carnages two,
Two little nurses
With duty to do.
Both little nurses
Were careful at first,
Soon both grew careless—
Which was the worst.
O what a pitiful
Wail from the street I
One broken rail
Trips four little feet
Over went carriages,
Babies and all,
And two china noses
Were cracked in the fall
The Soldier Dolly.
There once was a sweet tiny maiden,
A wee little woman of four,
Who scarce could reach up to the table.
Or open the nursery door ;
And this poor little maid, she was
crying—
Her dolly had such a fall!
Yes' there on the ground he was lyiug—
Her darling, the best of them all.
This dolly had been a brave soldier,
With uniform, sabre, and all,
And worshipp'd a doll in thedoU’s-house.
That stood by the side of the wall
She was only a poor tiny maiden,
A wee little woman of four,
And she sat with her heart nearly
breaking,
With the doll in her lap on the floor
And the poor, tiny, sorrowful maiden.
The wee little woman of four.
Now lies with her dead soldier dolly,
Asleep on the nursery floor
The Dead Doll.
You needn't be trying to comfort me—
I tell you my dolly is dead !
There's no use saying she isn't—
With a crack like that on her head
Its just like you said it wouldn’t hurt
Much to have my tooth out that day
And then when they most pulled
My head off, you hadnt a word to say
And 1 guess you must think I’m a baby,
When you say you can mend it with glue!
As if I didn’t know better than that !
Why, just suppose it was you ?
You might make her look all mended—
But what do I care for looks ?
Why, glue's for chairs and tables,
And toys, and the backs of books !
My dolly I my own little daughter!
Oh, but it’s the awfullest crack !
It just makes me sick to think of the sound
When her poor head went whack
Against this horrible brass thing
That holds up the little shelf.
Now, Nursey, what makes you remind me?
I know that I did it myself?
I think you must be crazy—
You'll get her another head!
What good would forty heads do her ?
I tell you my dolly is dead !
And to think that I hadn’t quite finished
Her elegant New Year’s hat !
And I took a sweet ribbon of hers
Last night to tie on that horrid cat!
When my mamma gave me that ribbon—
I was playing out in the yard—
She said to me most expressly:
"Here’s a ribbon for Hildegarde."
And I went and put it on Tabby,
And Hildegarde saw me do it;
But I said to myself, “Oh, never mind,
I don’t believe she knew it I"
But I know that she knew it now,
And I just believe, I do,
That her poor little heart was broken,
And so her head broke too.
Oh, my baby ! my little baby!
I wish my head had been hit f
For I’ve hit it over and over,
And it hasn’t cracked a bit.
But since the darling is dead,
She’ll want to be buried of course ,
We will take my little wagon, Nurse,
And you shall be the horse ;
And I'll walk behind and cry;
And we'll put her in this—you see,
This dear little box—and we'll bury
Them under the maple tree.
And papa will make a tombstone.
Like the one he made for my bird ;
And he’ll put what I tell him on it—
Yes, every single word!
I shall say: "Here lies Hildegarde,
A beautiful doll that is dead ;
She died of a broken heart,
And a dreadful crack in her head ”
Margaret Vandegrift
Dolly’s Doctor.
Dolly, my darling, is dreadfully sick ,
Oh, dear 1 what shall I do ?
Despatch to the doctor a telephone
quick
To bring her a remedy new.
Hush! that is the doctor's tap! tap I
tap I
Don’t make such a terrible noise—
Don't you see how the darling lies
still on my lap,
And never looks up at you boys I
Come, doctor, and tell me now just
what you think
Would be best for my darling so
sweet.
‘ Give Dolly a bucket of water to drink,
In a bowl of hot gruel put her feet.'

Dollies Courting.
Christening Dollie.
See, this is my Christmas dolly,
Two weeks ago she came ;
And, oh ! the trouble I have had
To find a pretty name.
At first I thought of Marguerite—
A French name, meaning “ pearl” —
But Nellie said, “ Oh ! that’s too stiff
F*r such a graceful girl ”
And then I mentioned, one by one,
Susanna, Ruth, and Poll ;
•• But they are too old-fashioned
names,”
Said Nell, '* to suit your doll ”
So next day I got a great big book,
And searched it through and
through.
Then shook my head and sadly said
<• There’s not one name will do ”
My brother Tom was sitting near,
He raised his eyes and smiled;
*• Why, Pussy dear,” he kindly said,
Suppose I name your child.”
*• Oh I will you, Brother Tom ? ” I
cried,
And then I hugged him, so ;
(hugging her doll )
'• We’ll play you are the parson
That christens folks, you know
So then he took her in his arms
And solemnly and slow
He said: “This baby’s name shall be
Miss Josephine, or Jo.”
And there, before I knew it,
My baby had a name;
And what I like about it. is,
That mine is just the same

Three little girls brought each a doll,
To pass an afternoon ;

Their bangles made a tune ;

They have no scandal spread.”

Or lonely in my play.

Nor stand for a moment still;
And though I watch her tt2 livelong

Pm afraid she never will.
For some day some one will buy her,
And carry her quite away ;
She is only a doll in a great glass-case,

My dolly, dear.
Come sit up here !
And say why you don't cry.
I've struck your head
Against the bed,
And cracked your pretty
eye.

Do sit up here,
And let me see your face;
And say, my pet,
Why you don’t fret
Now Pug has got your
place.
My pretty Poll,
My dear, dear doll,
Why don’t you eat or talk ?
Like sister J ane,
And Sally Plane,
And then go for a walk ?
You have an eye,
But never cry.
And lips, but never prattle;
You’ve fingers ten,
Like brother Ben,
But never shake the rattle
You never eat,
Nor drink, nor sleep
Nor move unless v>‘ii re
carried ;
And when 1 pinch.
You never flinch,
Nor say that you are
worried
And though he’s very clever,
1 never, no, 1 never
Let him handle her or dandle her,
For boys, you know, are rough.
My Dolly’s always smiling ;
She was never known to
frown.
And she looks so verv charming
In her Sunday hat and gown
You really ought to see her
To get a good idea
Of the beauty of my Dolly.

Your eyes are so blue,
Your cheeks are so rosy,
Your frock is so new,
You’re the prettiest dolly

Though your hair is so pretty,
And your eyes are so blue,
Pd rather be Minnie
Than I would be you.
For you can’t see the flowers
When they come up in Spring;
You can't hear the birdies,
How sweetly they sing ;
Nor run out of doors
To look in the sky.
And see the white clouds
As they pass swiftly by
You've no kind papa
Or mamma to be near,.
To love you and teach you ;
So, dolly, my dear,
Though your cheeks are so rosy,
And your dress is so new.
I’d rather be Minnie
Than I would be you.

And a pretty little gown ;
A pretty little bonnet,
With a lovely feather on it ;
Oh, there's not another like it

Her eyes are bright as jewels,
And her hair as black as jet;
I hug her, and I kiss her!
And oh, how I should miss her
If she were taken from me;
Oh, how I should grieve and fret!

Says my Dolly is ” a muff,”
And he calls her other horrid

My Doll.
I found my old dolls
In the attic to-day,
In a box where I long ago
Laid them away.
It was silly, I know,
But ’twas such a surprise,
The sight of their faces
Brought tears to my eyes
There was poor little Flossie,
With azure eyes closed
For many a month
She had quietly dozed,
In the little silk gown
In which I last dressed her—
That time was brought back
So I stopped and caressed her
And then, as I raised her,
She opened her eyes,
And stared at her mother
In such sad surprise
That I kissed her and laid
Her again in her place
To keep her reproachful
Blue eyes off my face
And next 1 uncovered
My little bisque Mabel,
To meet whose brown eyes
I was still more unable.
Their gaze was surprised,
But exceedingly mild,
My poor little, dear little,
Led-away child !
And I kissed her, her face
Looked so childish and sweet
And I held for a moment
Her little kid feet,
For her stockings were scattered
And so were her shoes,
And then, when 1 found them,
They me the blues
I kissed her, and laid her
Back in the box, but
She looked at me still
(For her eyes would not shut),
And hastily covering
Her face from my sight,
I searched till wax Elsie
I brought to the light.
Now. that poor little doll
Was only my niece.
Her eyes were dark blue
And her curls white as fleece
But her nose was so flat,
'Twas no longer a nose.
And her wax cheeks had faded
And lost all their rose.
From losing her sawdust
Her body was slender,
Yet for those very reasons
My kiss was more tender,
And I laid the poor thing
Away with a sigh,
And feeling. I must say,
Like having a cry.
One big doll was missing,—
My dear Rosabel, —
How much I did love her,
I really can't tell.
It is painful, indeed,
To be talking about,
But I loved her so much
That I quite wore her out
Well, well, I am older,
But I’m sure I’m not glad.
The thought of those old times,
In fact, makes me sad.
And, although the feeling
Is silly, I know,
I cannot help sighing :
" Oh 1 why did I grow ?"

This little girl, I'm glad to say,
Is eight years old this very day.
She makes a hat for little “ Doll,"
And puts in it a feather tall
One doll is large, and one is small,
Another short another tall.
She talks to them. They won't ooey,
And then she says, " You cannot play."

I’ve brought him to the show
Because he looks so very nice,
He’ll take the prize, I know.
Places it by doll No. 3, and sits down
Fifth Girl—a very small girl holding by the
arm a large rag baby with a long diess
My mamma’s writing letters,
And she told me—"run away,"
And so I brought my dolly
To the baby show, to-day
She isn’t very pretty,
But she's very nice, 1 think.
Her eyes, and nose, and little mouth.
My mamma made with ink.
1 love my Dolly, 'cause she’s good—
She never, never cries,
So don't you think she’ll be the one
To carry off the prize ?
Places her doll by doll No. 4, and takes a seat
Sixth Girl.
They musn t crowd my baby out,
Although she's black as night.
I think she'll stand as good a chance
As babies that are white
She’s very neat, and nice, and clean.
Her lips are cherry red,
She wears a gay bandanna
Tied round her curly head
She’s a very handsome lady,
And if tb ndge be wise,
I do not ha. „ the slightest doubt
That she will take the prize.
Places her doll by doll No. 5 and sits down
First Girl—to the girls.
Do not open your mouths,
Nor shut your eyes !
For here comes the judge
To award the prize
Seventh Girl—Enters carrying a wana She
views each doll in turn with critical eves, then
pointing to the first doll, says
Number one is very pretty,
But I think she's rather tall.
Points to No. 2
And this cunning little baby,
Is a little bit too small.
Number three—a fine French lady,
Too Frenchy is, I fear.
Points to No. 4
And Master Jack, I like your looks,
But I think you dress too queer
No. 5.
And this old-fashoned baby doll,
I guess lived in the ark ;
No 6
No, no, Miss Dinah, no prize for you,
Your skin is much too dark.
Then turning to the little girls, she continues
And now, dear anxious mothers,
I find I can’t decide,
Which doll shall have the premium,
But I’ll be satisfied
If you’ll call another meeting
To-morrow afternoon,
I need more time to settle this—
To-day is quite too soon.
So, mothers, now I give these babes
Back to your loving care;
And I thank you much
For bringing them
To our famous Baby Fair
Hands each doll to its owner. Exit all
Please. Puss, don’t Hurt Me.
DOLLY LAND


A Doll’s Adventures Round
The World.
All round the world and back again
Dolly and I have been ;
By sea and land we've travelled far,
The strangest sights have seen
To Greenland first we sailed away
To see the snow and ice,
But Dolly's nose—it nearly froze —
Oh, dear ! that wasn’t nice !
So off we tripp’d to Canada.
There ’twas not quite so cold—
But there the Indians in the woods
Rushed after us so bold.
We ran away to Montana,
O’er Rocky Mountains high,
To picnic in Wild Oregon,
Famous for pumpkin pie
Then down to California,
Through many a field of gold,
And over ancient Mexico,
Past temples manifold.
The Sandwich Isles we visited,
Where grew such radiant flowers.
And pretty girls danced all the day
In fragrant, rosy bowers.
We crossed the Equatorial Seas,
And. sailing round and round
The lovely islands of the main,
Sweet coral groves we found
New Zealand’s shore we landed at,
The country of strange things—
Cherries that carried the stones outside,
And flowers with butterflies' wings.
Oh, when we reached Australia —
What heaps and heaps of gold !
And a million of sheep and lambs we saw
Straying from fold to fold.
To buy some Tea-pots and some Travs,
We called at quaint Japan.
Where a very polite cld Japanese
Gave Dolly an ivory fan.
We took a trip to Chinese land
To take a cup of tea,
But neither sugar nor cream was given,
Which didn’t suit Dolly and me.
Then travelling on to Hindostan,
We met a tiger there,
Who* looked as though he would eat
us up—
So off we flew elsewhere,
And found ourselves in the Khyber Pass.
In the midst of a Caravan,
With which we travelled night and day
To reach Afghanistan,
Across the Red Sea next we sail’d
And through the Suez Canal,
To purchase a Camel at old Cairo,
With a trot most magical,
Across the Desert we rode apace,
No water was there to drink,
Ah, oh ! —while climbing a Pyramid
Dolly dropped down a chink
An Arab kindly rescued her—
(She did so ruffle her hair;
If ever she plays that trick again
She’ll have to be left down there.)
At last we left the Desert drear,
To sail upon the Nile,
In the Pasha's beautiful diahbeheh
Past many a Crocodile
We saw no end of wonders now
In Africa's strange land—
Forests full of lions fierce,
And many a savage band.
Our steamer on the Congo sank—
We were in dreadful plight
Until we met with Stanley true,
And then we steered aright.
We said, Good-bye to Africa,
And, though winds proved contrary,
Northward our wondrous way we took
To the Isles of sweet Canary.
Thence favouring gales conveyed us far
Beyond the Spanish shore :
Fast by the coast of France we sped
To our own land once more.
And now we're safe at home again,
As wise as wise can be :
For seeing all the world’s wonders
Improves my Doll and me
Sabina
The Story of a Doll.
1 stood in the semi-darkness
And watched a child at her play ;
Her cares were of multiform nature,
And the daylight was speeding away,
Her dolly demanded attention,
To be petted and kissed and be fed ;
To have on its little nightgown.
And then to be put in its bed
All this with a motherly yearning
She had learned by the instinct of love
And the dolly but faintly presented
gift from the heaven above
The dear little creature had finished
And was just about turning to go.
When the scene all changed in a moment
And turned into weeping and woe,
A boy, almost reaching to manhood, .
Dashed wildly from outside the room,
And seizing the doll from the cradle
Rushed out again into the gloom,
There was one wild scream from the
maiden,
A clasp of the hands and a chase ;
But the boy thought the thing was funny
And was in for a brotherly race.
But soon, when the screaming grew louder
And he saw all the pain he had caused,
He threw down the doll on the flooring,
And sneering, he suddenly paused.
T wouldn’t be such a cry-baby,” he said,
With a half-mocking drawl ;
"I can buy plenty more that’s just like it
It is only a plaster doll
Why don’t you get one made of china,
Instead of that plaster thing?
And then I would try and respect it,”
And he took himself off with a fling.
*'Oh ! my dolly, my dolly is broken,”
And quick in her bosom she hid
The maimed little bit of her sunshine
‘T loved it, I loved it, I did
I don’t care if it was only plaster;
’Twas my dolly, my dolly, my own "
And she knelt by the mangled plaything
“And now I am left all alone.”
Ten years from that very evening,
I stood by the couch of a child,
While a man knelt and wept beside it,
With a face both haggard and wild.
’Twas the old scene of dolly repeated,
The boy had to manhood grown :
A hand crushed his plaster idol
And left him to mourn all alone
Ah me 1 how the world is repeating
The work of each day o’er and o’er
We all have our broken dollies
Away on the golden shore.
Did he think, I wonder, of that one
He threw on the carpetless floor.
Watsoh
DOLLY L^JSTD.


I am Homesick, Dolly Dear.
Dolly knows what’s the matter—
Dolly and 1
It isn’t the mumps nor the measles—
Oh 1 dear. I shall die !
It’s the mothering we want, Dolly,
The—what shall I call it ?
And grandpa says he has sent —
He pm the ’spatch safe in his wallet
I know well enough that he dropped
That telegraph ’spatch in the fire,
If mother just knew, she’d come
If ’twas on the telegraph wire!
She’d take my poor head.
That is splitting this very minute,
And she’d sing "There's a Happv
Land,”
And the hymn that has "Darling”
in it.
Course, I like grandpa’s house;
It’s the splendidest place to stay,
When there’s all the outdoors to live in.
And nothing to do but to play ;
Somehow you forget your mother—
That is, just the littlest bit,
Though if she were here, I suppose
That I shouldn't mention it.
But oh ! there’s a difference, Dolly,
When your head is so full of pains
That ( cepting the ache that’s in ’em)
There's nothing left of your brains.
Remember how nice it feels, Dolly,
To have your head petted and
"poored."
Ache ? Why I ache all over,
And my bed is as hard as a board
Nurse says " It’s a sweet, lovely
morning.”
It may be for all that I care;
There’s just one spot in this great
wide world
That is pretty —I wish I was there I
I can see the white roses climbing
All over the low porch door,
And the daisies and buttercups
growing—
I never half loved them before
And mother—let’s see ! she’s standing
In that very same door, no doubt;
She loves to look out in the morning
And see what the world is about,
In a pale-blue something-or-other—
A loose sort of wrapper, I guess ;
As if a few yards of sky
Had been taken to make a dress.
And up from the pine woods yonder
Comes a beautiful woodsy smell,
And the breeze keeps a hinting of
May flowers—
The real-pink arbutus bell;
And I think most likely the robins
Have built in the cherry tree ;
And by and by there’ll be birdies—
And I shall not be there to see!
Did you hear any noise, Dolly !
Speak, Dolly, you little witch !
As if someone was laughing—or
crying!
I couldn’t tell which 1
We’ve kept from crying, so far;
We’ve choked but we wouldn’t cry;
I’ve just talked it out to you, dear .
I had to, or else I’d die.
But ff that is you, mother—
And I know by your lips that it is—
I’ll just squeeze your head off!—
You think that all I want is a kiss!
O mother ! to papa and Tom
You needn’t go mention it,
But you know it was homesickness
Almost killed your poor little Kit 1

TEMPER LAND.
A Bad-Tempered Baby Boy.
Good Mamma.
Love, come and sit upon my knee,
And give me kisses, one, two, three,
And tell me whether you love me.
My baby.
For this I’m sure, that I love you,
And many, many things I do,
And many an hour I sit and sew
For baby.
And then at night I lie awake,
Thinking of things that I can make.
And trouble that 1 mean to take
For baby.
And when you're good and do not
cry,
Nor into angry passions fly,
You can’t think how papa and I
Love baby.
But if my little child should grow
To be a naughty child. 1 know
’Twould grieve mamma to serve
her so,
My baby.
And when you saw me pale and
thin,
By grieving for my baby’s sin,
I think you’d wish that you had
been
A better baby,
How they Made Up.
Two naughty little people
Had a quarrel one sad day,
Each said that with the other.
She never mure would play
And so upon each other
Their little backs they turned,
And all the old time fondness
Alas ! they coldly spurned,
But oh ! their hearts grew weary,
The anger died away,
Each hoped that soon the other
Would have a word to say.
Each waited, oh ! how sadly !
Each moved a little near.
And each " around the corner ”
Began, at last, to peer
Then Nellie held her dolly
To Annie with a smile :
“You may have it if you want to.
And play with it awhile ”
Then Annie quickly followed
The rule she knew was right :
“I’ve got an apple, Nellie,
I’ll give you a big bite.”
And somehow the wee faces
Met fair and square at last,
And kisses sweet and loving
Sent the quarrel flying fast
Little Whimpy.
Whimpy, little Whimpy.
Cried so much one day ; I
His grandma couldn’t stand it, |
And his mother ran away !
He was waiting by the window
When they all come home to
tea,
And a gladder boy than Wimpy
You never need hope to see!
A Naughty, Naughty, Naughty Girl.
Sulky Sarah.
Why is Sarah standing there,
Leaning down upon a chair.
With such an angry lip and brow ?
I wonder what’s the matter now.
Come here, my dear, and tell me true;
Is it because I spoke to you
About the work you’d done so slow,
That you are standing fretting so ?
Why then, indeed, I’m grieved to see
That you can so ill-temper’d be :
You make your fault a great deal worse
By being angry and perverse.
Oh! how much better ’twould appear
To see you shed a humble tear,
And then to hear you meekly say,
“ I'll not do so another day.”
Jane Taylor.
Master Cross Patch.
Cross Patch, cross Patch,
What's the matter now ?
Why that wail of fretfulness,
And scowl upon your brow ?
Milk upset and wasted !
Water in your plate,
No one’s sorry, old cross Patch,
For your wretched fate.
You began the morning
With a frown, my lad,
And every word that you have said
Has made your mother sad.
And by your pettish temper,
You’ve spoiled your breakfast,
too
Cross Patch, cross Patch,
No one pities you.


A Naughty Bad-Tempered Boy who broke
his Sister’s Playthings.
Words.
Poison-drops of care and sorrow,
Bitter poison-drops are they,
Weaving for the coming morrow,
Saddest memories of to-day
Angry words, oh! let them never
From the tongue unbridled slip;
May the heart's best impulse ever
Check them, ere they soil the lip
Love is much too pure and holy,
Friendship is too sacred far,
For a moment’s reckless folly
Thus to desolate and mar.
Angry words are lightly spoken.
Bitterest thoughts are rashly
stirred,
Brightest links of life are broken,
By a single angry word.
The Tear and the Smile
A little tear and a little smile
Set out to run a race;
We watched them closely all
the while—
Theircourse was baby's face
The iittle tear he got the start
We really feared he’d win,
He ran so fast and made a dart
Straight tor her dimpled chin
Butsomehow.it was very queer,
We watched them all the
while—
The little, shining, fretful tear
Got beaten by the smile.
Lot© one another.
Silly little Mary,
Sulking all the day,
While the other children
Run about and play
Silly little Mary
Wears a peevish look,
When she sees the others
Laughing at the brook.
Silly little Mary,
Will not skip or swing,
Won't at puss-in-corner play,
Won’t do anything
Silly little Mary
Hides behind the bank,
In among the roots and
weeds.
All so thick and rank.
Mary hears a footstep
O'er the velvet moss,
Sees a roguish little face
It is Willie Ross.
I have found you. Mary,
Won’t you come play too?
And with cheeks all crim-
soned,
Whispers—l love you.
Ah ! but love has conquered
Fall the tears like rain.
Then our little Mary
Is herself again.
Where are sulks and tears
now ?
All are fled away.
And our little Mary
Will both laugh and, pj ay
A New Year’s Gift.
A charming present comes from town,
A baby-house quite neat;
With kitchen, parlours, dining-room.
And chambers, all complete,
A gift to Emma and to Rose,
From grandpapa it came ;
The little Rosa smil’d delight,
And Emma did the same
They eagerly examin’d all—
The furniture was gay ; [dobs,
And in the rooms they plac'd their
When dress’d in fine array
\t night, their little candles lit,
And as they must be fed,
To supper down the dolls were plac'd,
And then were put to bed.
Thus Rose and Emma pass’d each hour
Devoted to their play ;
And long were cheerful, happy, kind—
No cross disputes had they.
Till Rose in baby-house would change
The chairs which were below,
" This carpel they will better suit ;
I think I'll have it so.”
” No, no indeed," her sister said.
" I’m older, Rose, than you ;
And I’m the pet —the house is mine :
Miss, what 1 say is true.”
The quarrel grew to such a height,
Mamma she heard the noise,
And coming in, beheld the floor
All strew'd with broken toys.
" O fie, my Emma ! naughty Rose I
Say, why this sulk and p<~>nt ?
Remember, this is New Year’s Day,
And both are going out.”
Now Betty calls the little girls
To come upstairs and dress; [taunts,
They still revile, with threats and
And angry rage express
But just prepar’d to leave their room,
Persisting yet in strife,
Rose sick'ning fell on Betty’s lap,
As void of sense or life
Mamma appear'd at Betty 's call—
John for the doctor goes;
The measles, he begins to think,
Dread symptoms all disclose.
"But though I stay, my Emma, you
May go and spend the day.”
" O no, mamma," replied the child,
" Do suffer me to stay.
" Beside my sister’s bed I'll sit.
And watch her with such care.
“ No pleasure can 1 e'er enjoy,
Till she my pleasure share.
" How silly now seems our dispute,
Not one of us she knows; [breathes,
How pale she looks, how hard she

NAUGHTINESS LAND.
A Bad-Tempered Girl.
Anger.
Oh ! anger is an evil thing,
And spoils the fairest face ;
It cometh like a rainy cloud
Upon a sunny place.
One angry m >ment often does
What we repent for years :
It works the wrong we ne’er make right
By sorrow or by tears
It speaks the rude and cruel word
That wounds a feeling breast :
It strikes the reckless sudden blow -
It breaks the household rest
We dread the dog that turns in play,
All snapping, fierce and quick ;
We shun the steed whose temper shows
In strong and savage kick
But how much more we find to blame,
When passion wildly swells
In hearts where kindness has been
taught,
And brains where reason dwells I
The hand of peace is frank and warm
And soft as a ring-dove s wing ,
And he who quells an angry thought
Is greater than a king
Shame to the lips that ever seek
To stir up jarring strife,
When gentleness would shed so much
Of Christian joy through life !
Ever remember in thy youth,
That he who firmly tries
To conquer and to rule himself
la noble, brave and wise.

he/ Sister,
Go, go, my naughty girl, and kiss
Your little sister dear ;
I must not have such things as this,
Nor noisy quarrels here
What I little children scold and
fight,
That ought to be so mild :
Oh ! Mary, tis a shocking sight
To see an angry child
I can't imagine, for my part,
The reason of your folly,
As if she did you any hurt
By playing with your dolly
See, see the little tears that run
So quickly from her eye :
Come, my sweet innocent, have
done,
'Twill do no good to cry
Go, Mary, wipe her tears away
And make it up with kisses :
And never turn a pretty play
To such a pet as this is
Home Peace.

street
There should be peace at home ,
Where sisters dwell and brothers
meet
Quarrels should never come "

Little Dick Snappy
Was always unhappy.
Because he did nothing but fret;

And gave such another

Little Edward began,

GoTeru your Temper
Oh, govern your temper I
For music, the sweetest,
Was never so sweeti—
Nor one-half so divine,
As a heart kept in tune,
Which, the moment thou
greetest,
Breathes harmony dearer
Than notes can combine 1
Never say it is nature,
And may not be cured;
One tithe of the time,
Which to music we yield
Would render the conques
Of temper insured.
And bring us more music
Than song e'er revealed.
Oh, govern your temper I
For roses, the fairest.
Were never so fair,
Nor so rich in perfume,
As the flowers, which e’en
thou,
Chilly winter sparest —
The flowers of the heart,
Which unchangingly
bloom !
Never think it is nature —
For oh! if it be,
The sooner the spirit
Of nature is shown
That the spirit of heaven
Is higher than she,
The sooner, the longer,
Will love be our own.
Quarrelsome Boys.
A bad wicked Bully.
Where do you Live.
I knew a man. and his name was Horner,
He used to live at Grumble Corner, —
Grumble Corner, in Cross Patch Town, —
And he never was seen without a frown
He grumbled at this, he grumbled at that;
He growled at the dog, he growled at the cat;
He grumbled at morning, he grumbled at
night, [delight.
And to grumble and growl was his chief
He grumbled so much at his wife, that she
Began to grumble as well as he;
And all the children wherever they went
Reflected their parents’ discontent
If the sky was dark and betokened rain,
Then Mr. Horner was sure to complain ;
And if there was never a cloud about,
He’d grumble because of a threatened
drought.
One day, as I loitered along the street,
My old acquaintance I chanced to meet.
Whose face was without the look of care
And the ugly frown that it used to wear.
“ I may be mistaken, perhaps,” I said.
As, after saluting, I turned my head ;
" But it is, and it isn't, the Mr. Horner
Who lived so long at Grumble Corner "
I met him next day, and I met him again,
In melting weather, in pouring rain; [down ;
When stocks were up and when stocks were
But a smile, somehow, had replac'd the frown
It puzzled me much, and so, one day,
I seized his hand in a friendly way.
And said " Mr Horner, I’d like to know
What '•an happened to change you so
He laughed a laugh that was good to hear,
For it told of a conscience calm and clear,
And he said, with none of the old-time drawl,
"Why, I’vechanged my residence, thatisall."
"Changed your residence?" “Yes," said Horner,
" It wasn't healthy at Grumble Corner,
And so I've moved: ’twas a change complete;
And you’ll find me now at Thanksgiving Street."
And every day, as I move along
The streets, so filled with the busy throng,
I watch each face, and can always tell
Where men, and women, and children dwell
And many a discontented mourner
Is spending his days at Grumble Corner,
Sour and sad, whom I long to entreat
To take a house in Thanksgiving Street
Naughty Boys Fighting.
Temper.
Bad temper, go.
You never shall stay with me ;
Bad temper, go,
You and I shall never agree.
For I will always kind, and mild,
And gentle pray to be,
And do to others as I wish
That they should do to me.
Temper bad
With me shall never stay;
Temper bad
Can never be happy and gay.

A Fine Lady.
I'id ever you see such wondrous airs!
Oh, oh I my Lady Jane!
Your airs will blow you quite away,
You'll go to Vanity-land to stay,
And ne’er come back again
Pray, what's the price of your hat my
dear ?
And what'll you take for your gloves ?
And how'll you sell each pink kid shoe?
And your wonderful dressed-up poodle,
too ?
You’re a precious pair of loves.
You’re all too fine for us, you know,
With your airs and stately tread.
From your pretty feet toyour pretty dress,
And up to your ruffled neck, oh. yes,
And on to your feathered head
So go your way. my Lady Jane,
Till you come from Vanity-land again
To a little Girl who liked
to look in the Glass.
Why is my silly girl so vain,
Looking in the glass again ?
For the meekest flower of spring
Is a gayer little thing
Is your merry eye so blue
As the violet, wet with dew?
Yet it loves the best to hide
By the hedge's shady side
Is your bosom half so fair
As the modest lilies are?
Yet their little bells are hung
Bright and shady leaves among
When your cheek the brighiesi
glows,
Is it redder than the rose?
But its sweetest buds are seen
Almost hid with moss and green
Little flowers that open gay,
Peeping forth at break of day.
In toe garden, hedge, or plain.

The Ragged GiiTs Sunday.
"Oh, dear Mamma, that little girl
Forgets this is the day
When children should be clean and
neat,
And read and learn, and pray I
Her face is dirty and her frock.
Holes in her stockings, see.
I ler hair is such a fright, oh, dear 1
How wicked she must be!
She’s playing in the kennel dirt
With ragged girls and boys;
But I would not on Sunday touch
My clean and pretty toys.
I go to church, and sit so still.
I in the garden walk,
Or take my stool beside the fire,
And hear nice Sunday talk
I read my bible, learn my hymns.
My catechism say ;
That wicked little girl does not
She only cares to play."
"Ah! hush that boasting tone, my
love.
Repress self glorying pride;
You can do nothing ot yourself—
Friends all your actions guide."
Criminal Pride.
Hark the rustle of a dress
Stiff with lavish costliness !
Here comes one whose cheek would
flush
But to have her garment brush
'Gainst the girl whose fingers thin
Wove the weary ’broidery in,
Bending backward from her toil,
Lest her tears the silk might soil,
And in midnight’s chill and murk,
Stitched her life into the work.
Little doth the wearer heed
Of the heart-break in the bredc ;
A hyena by her side
Skulks, down-looking—it is Pride

Foolish Fanny.
Oh 1 Fanny was so vain a lass,
If she came near a looking-glass.
She’d stop right there for many a minut.
To see how pretty she looked in it
She’d stand and prink, and fix her h.u
Around her forehead with great car*
And take some time to tie a bow
That must, to please her, lie just so
Her mother’s bonnet she’d put on.
And all her richest dresses don.
And up and down the room parade.
And much enjoy her promenade.
She always liked to wear the best
She had, and being so much dress'd
Could not enjoy the romps with those
Who wore much less expensive clothes
Each day she grew so fond of dress
It gave her great unhappiness
If every day, and all the while,
She wasn’t in the latest style
If asked to turn the jumping-rope
Her prettv parasol she d ope,
Lest she stiould freckle in the sunl
And that was her idea of fun!
She didn’t dare to take the cat
Or poodle-dog from off the mat,
Lest they should catch their little toes
In laces, frills, or furbelows.
The very things that gave her joy
Her peace and comfort would dettrov.
For oft an ugly nail would tear
The costly dress she chose to wear
This foolish girl turned up her nose
At those who dressed in plainer clothes.
And lived in quiet style, for she
With wealthy people chose to be
She never was the least inclined
With knowledge to enrich her mind.
And all the mental food she ate
Was served upon a fashion-plate
As this was so, you’ll see at once
That Fan grew up a silly dunce -
And there was nothing to admire
About her. but her fine attire
Foolish Fanny.


Mr. Importance walking along the street.
Pride.
Come, come, Mr. Peacock,
You must not be proud,
Although you can boast such a train,
For there’s many a bird
Far more highly endowed,
And not half so conceited and vain.
Let me tell you, gay bird,
That a suit of fine clothes
Is a sorry distinction at most,
And seldom much valued
Excepting by those
Who only such graces can boast.
The nightingale certainly
Wears a plain coat,
But she cheers and delights with her
song;
While you, though so vain,
Cannot utter a note
To please by the use of your tongue.
The hawk cannot boast
Of a plumage so gay,
But more piercing and clear is her eye;
And while you are strutting
About all the day,
She gallantly soars in the sky.
The dove may be clad
In a plainer attire,
But she is not so selfish and cold;
And her love and affection
More pleasure inspire
Than all your fine purple and gold.
So, you see, Mr. Peacock,
You must not be proud,
Although you can boast such a train,
For many a bird
Is more highly endowed,
And not half so conceited and vain.
Sinful Pride.
How proud we are, how fond to shew
Our clothes, and call them rich and
new, [wore
When the poor sheep and silkworm
That very clothing long before!

Let me be dress’d fine as I will, [still.
Flies, worms, and flowers exceed me

In a frock richly trimm’d
With a beautiful lace,
And hair nicely dress’d
Hanging over her face,
Thus deck'd, Harriet went
To the house of a friend,
With a large little party
The ev’ning to spend.
‘‘Ahl how they will all
Be delighted, I guess,
And stare with surprise
At my elegant dress I ’’
Thus said the vain girl,
And her little heart beat,
Impatient the happy
Young party to meet.
But, alas! they were all
Too intent on their fun,
To observe the gay clothes
This fine lady had on;
And thus all her trouble
Quite lost its design,
For they saw she was proud,
But forgot she was fine.
'Twas Lucy, tho’ only
In simple white clad,
(Nor trimmings, nor laces,
Nor jewels she had,)
Whose cheerful good nature
Delighted them more,
Than all the fine garments
That Harriet wore.
'Tis better to have
A sweet smile on one’s face,
Than to wear a rich frock
With an elegant lace,
For the good-natur’d girl
Is lov’d best in the main,
If her dress is but decent,
Tho’ ever so plain.

Spreading wide,
A small moustache—
Nine on a side.
Arms at right angles,
Curved with ease,
A stille' walk
And shaky knees.
A languid drawl,
The “ English ” swing,
An air of knowing
Everything.
A vacant stare,
Extremely rude,
And there you have

Hark ! the rustle of a dress,
Stiff with lavish costliness I
Here comes one whose cheek
would flush,
But to have her garment brush
’Gainst the girl whose fingers thin
Wove the weary 'broidery in,
Bending backward from her toil,
Lest her tears the silk might soil.
And in midnight’s chill and murk
Stitched her life into the work
Shaping from her bitter thought,
Heart’s-ease and forget-me-not,
Satirizing her despair
With the emblems woven there,
Little doth the weary heed
Of the heart-break in the blede;
A hyena by her side
Skulks, down-looking—it is Pride.

Vain Lizzie.
It surely is not good to see,
Lizzie so full of vanity,
So fond of dress and show.
For when a fine new frock she wears.
She gives herself most sil’y airs,
Wherever she may go.
She thinks herself a charming girl;
But when folks see her twist and twirl,
0 Ley stop in every street,
They smile, or fairly laugh outright,
And say ; “ She’s really quite a sight.
Was ever such conceit? *

Beside her young Neddie was standing
And Neddie loves apples, too,

Dear Nelly held out the big apple ,
Ned opened his mouth very wide—
So wide, that the startled red apple
Could almost have gone inside I
And oh I what a bite he gave it I
The apple looked small, I declare,
When Ned gave it back to his sister.
Leaving that big bite there
Poor Nelly looked frightened a moment.

bright;

Once, when I was a little boy.
I sat me down to cry,
Because my little brother had

And suffer'd such terrible pain,
Her pride and her consequence
Soon were all o'er,

I won't give a morsel away."
Then Tommy he snatched it. and Peter he
fought,
(’Tis sad and distressing to tell !) [main.
And Archie held on with his might and his
Till out from his Angers it fell.
Away from the quarrelsome urchins ft flew
And then, down a green little hill
That apple it roll’d, and it roll’d, and it roll’d
\s if it would never be still.
A lazy old brindle was nipping the grass.
And switching her tail at the flies.
When all of a sudden the apple rolled down
And stopped just in front of her eyes
She gave but a bite and a swallow or two—
That apple was seen nevermore! [Tom.
"I wish,” whimpered Archie, and Peter, and
" We’d kept it and cut it in four ’’

Greedy Richard.
"I think I want some pies this morn-
ing" [yawning ;
Said Dick, stretching himself and
So down he threw his slate and books,
And saunter'd to the pastry-cook's.
And there he cast his greedy eyes
Round on the jellies and the pies
So to select, with anxious care.
The very nicest that was there
At last the point was thus decided ;
As his opinion was divided
'Twixt pie and jelly, he was loth
Either to leave, so took them both
Now Richard never could be pleas'd
To stop when hunger was appeas'd,
But he d go on to eat and stuff.
Long after he had had enough.
" 1 shan’t take any more," said Dick,
" Dear me. 1 feel extremely sick :
I cannot eat this other bit ;
I wish I had not tasted it."
Then slowly rising from his seat,
He threw the cheesecake in the street,
And left the tempting pastry-cook's
With very discontented looks

The Plum Cake.
"Oh! I’ve got a plum cake,
And a rare feast I’ll make,
I’ll eat, and I’ll stuff, and I'll cram;
Morning, noontime, and night,
It shall be my delight;—
What a happy young fellow I am."
Thus said little George,
And, beginning to gorge.
With zeal to his cake he applied ;
While fingers and thumbs.
For the sweetmeats and plums,
Were hunting and digging besides.
But, woeful to tell,
A misfortune befell,
Which ruin’d this capital fun I
After eating his till,
He was taken so ill,
That he trembled for what he had
done.
As he grew worse and worse,
The doctor and nurse,
To cure his disorder were sent;
And rightly, you’ll think,
lie had physic to drink,
Which made him his folly repent.
And while on his bed
He roll’d his hot head,
Impatient with sickness and pain ;
He could not but take
This reproof from his cake,
" Don’t be such a glutton again I ”
Another Plum Cake.
" Oh 1 I’ve got a plum cake,
And a feast let us make,
Come, school-fellows, come at my call;
I assure you ’tis nice,
And we’ll each have a slice,
Here's more than enough for us all."
Thus said little Jack,
As he gave it a smack,
And sharpen’d his knife for the job
While round him a troop,
Form’d a clamorous group,
And hail’d him the king of the mob.
With masterly strength
He cut thro’ it at length,
And gave to each playmate a share ;
Dick, William, and James,
And many more names.
Partook his benevolent care.
And when it was done,
And they’d finish’d their fun,
To marbles or hoop they went back,
And each little boy
Felt it always a joy
To do a good turn for good Ja k.
In his task and his book,
His best pleasures he took,
And as he thus wisely began,
Since he’s been a man grown,
He has constantly shown
That a good boy will make a good man.

The Great Glutton.
’Twas the voice of the glutton,
I heard him complain :
My waistcoat unbutton,
I’ll eat once again.
The Glutton.
The voice of the glutton
I heard with disdain—
" I've not eaten this hour,
I must eat again ;
Oh ! give me a pudding,
A pie, or a tart,
A duck or a fowl, [heart.
Which I love from my
“How sweet is the picking
Of capon or chicken 1
A turkey and chine
Arem st charming and fine;
To eat and to drink
All my pleasure is still,
I care not who wants
So that I have my fill."
Oh ! let me not be.
Like a glutton, inclined
In feasting my body
And starving my mind,
With moderate viands
Be thankful, and pray
That the Lord may supply
me
With food the next day.
Not always a-craving
With hunger still raving ;
But little and sweet
Be the food that I eat.
To learning and wisdom
Oh let me apply,
And leave to the glutton
His pudding and pie.

Selfish Edith.
Selfish Edith, not to give
Her sister one, when she has two !
I wouldn’t and I couldn’t love
A selfish girl like her, could you ?
Hear Bessie ask in plaintive tone,
“Please, Edith, let me play with
one ! ”
While naughty Edith shakes her head
I fear she’ll have but little fun
With toys unshared so selfishly ;
But when she tires of lonely play,
Perhaps she’ll secretly resolve
To be more kind another day.
Hoggish Henry.
Oh ! Henry eats like any pig ;
He drives his mother mad.
She scolds. He does not care a fig,
It’s really very sad.
She says: “Your sister, little dear,
Is always clean and neat; [year,
And though she’s younger by a
How nicely she can eat."
It’s all in vain. He does not care;
He’s shocking to behold.
The table-cloth and napkin there
Are smeared in every fold.
Upon the floor, crumbs thickly lie,
As though for chickens laid,
Around his mouth and nose, oh fie!
Is dirt of every shade.
He looks, bedaubed with smear
and stain,
Just like some savage wild,
His hands as forks are used, it's
plain.
For shame ! you dirty child 1
Selfishness.
Look at the selfish man! see how he locks
Tight in his arms his mortgages and stocks I
While deeds and titles in his hand he grasps
And gold and silver close around he clasps.
But not content with this, behind he drags
A cart well-laden with the ponderous bags;
The orphan’s wailings, and the widow’s woe
From mer:y’s fountain cause no tears to flow;
He pours no cordial in the wounds of pain ;
Unlocks no prison, and unclasps no chain ;
His heart is like the rock where sun nor dew
Can rear one plant or flower of heavenly hue.
No thought of mercy there may have its birth.
For helpless misery or suffering worth ;
The end of all his life is paltry pelf,
And all his thoughts are centred on—himself:
The wretch of both worlds; for so mean a sum.
First starved in this, then damn’d in that to
come.
Our selfish Brother who became a Screw.


LYING LAND.
Bad Boy baying broken a vase told his mother that the
Dog did it, but when bis mother was going to beat the
poor innocent Dog lie felt sorry, and told the truth.
False Alarms.
Little Mary one day most loudly did call,
"Mamma ! oh, mamma, pray come here!
A fall I have had—oh ! a very sad fall.”
Mamma ran in haste and in fear; [glee,
ThenMaryjump’dup.andshelaugh’din great
And cried, " Why, how fast you can run !
No harm has befallen, I assure you, to me,
My screaming was only in fun.”
Her mother was busy at work the next day,
She heard from without a loud cry, [pray!
“The big dog has got me! O help me! Oh !
He tears me —he bites me—l die 1”
Mamma, all in terror, quick to the court flew,
And there little Mary she found; [you do I”
Who, laughing, said, "Madam, pray how do
And curtsey’d quite down to the ground.
That night little Mary, when long gone to bed.
Shrill cries and loud shriekings were heard;
'l’m on fire, O mamma, come up or I’m dead!’
Mamma she believ’d not a word.
"Sleep, sleep, naughty child,” she call’d out
from below,
" How often have I been deceived !
You’re telling a story, you very well know:
Go to sleep, for you can’t be believed.”
Yet still the child scream’d—now the house
fill’d with smoke.
That fire is above Jane declares, [no joke,
Alas ! Mary’s words they soon found were
When ev’ry one hasten’d upstairs, [face,
All burnt and all seam’d is her once pretty
And terribly mark’d are her arms, [grace,
Her features all scarr’d, leave a lasting dis-
For giving mamma false alarms.
Adelaide Taylor.
Truthful Dottie; or the
Rroken Yase.
Nellie and Dottie
Both hear mamma say,
" Pray from the drawing-room
Keep away,
Don’t take your toys there,
Lest someone should call;
Run out in the garden
With rope, bat, and ball.”
The garden is lovely,
This bright summer day;
But Nellie and
Too soon came away,
Into the drawing-room
Dottie comes skipping,
With her new rope
All the furniture flipping ;
Down goes the tall vase,
So golden and gay,
Smashed all to pieces.
" What will mamma say ?"
Cries Nell, with her hands
raised,
“ Oh. Dottie, let’s run ;
They’ll think it was pussy,
Who did it in fun.”
Dot answers, through big tears,
” But, Nell, don’t you see,
Though nobody watched us,
God knows it was me.
Mamma always says,
That, whatever we do,
The harm’s not so great,
If we dare to be true,
So I’ll go up and tell her
It caught in my rope ;
Perhaps she won’t scold much,
At least, so I’ll hope.”
“ That’s right I ” cries her
mother,
Who stands by the door,
“ I would rather ten vases
Were smashed on the floor.
Than my children should once
break
The bright words of truth,
The dearest possession
Of age or of youth.
The vase can be mended,
And scarce show a crack ;
But a falsehood once spoken
Will never come back.”
However much grieved for
By young folks or old,
An untruth once uttered,
For ever is told.
The Liar Reclaimed.
O 1 ’tis a lovely thing for youth
To walk betimes in wisdom’s way ;
To fear a lie, to speak the truth,
That we may trust to all they say.
But liars we can never trust,
Tho’ they should speak the thing
that’s true,
And he that does one fault at first,
And lies to hide it, makes it two,
The Truth.
Why should you fear the truth to tell ?
Does falsehood ever do so well ?
Can you be satisfied to know
There’s something wrong to hide below?
No 1 let your fault be what it may,
To own it is the happy way.
So long as you your crime conceal,
You cannot light or gladsome feel ;
Your heart will ever feel oppressed,
As if a weight were on your breast :
And e’en your mother’s eye to meet
Will tinge your face with shame and heat.
To a Little Girl that has
told a Lie.
And has my darling told a lie ?
Did she forget that God was by ?
That God who saw the thing she did,
From whom no action can be hid ;
Did she forget that God could see,
And hear, wherever she might be ?
He made your eyes and can discern
Whichever way you think to turn ;
He made your ears, and He can hear
When you think nobody is near;
In ev’ry place, by night or day.
He watches all you do and say.
You thought, because you were alone,
Your falsehood never could be known.
But liars always are found out,
Whatever ways they wind about;
And always be afraid, my dear,
To tell a lie, —for God can hear!
I wish, my dear, you’d always try
To act as shall not need a lie ;
And when you wish a thing to do.
That has been once forbidden you,
Remember that, and never dare
To disobey—for God is there 1
Why should you fear to tell me true?
Confess, and then I’ll pardon you ;
Tell me you’re sorry, and you’ll try
To act the better by and by, [been,
And then, whate’er your crime has
It won’t be half so great a sin.
But cheerful, innocent, and gay,
As passes by the smiling day,
You’ll never have to turn aside,
From any one your faults to hide ;
Nor heave a sigh, nor have a fear,
That either God or I should hear.

LAZINESS LAND.
Idle Mary.
Oh, Mary, this will never do !
This work is sadly done, my dear,
And such a little of it too !
You have not taken pains, I fear.
Oh no, your work has been forgotten,
Indeed you’ve hardly thought of that;
I saw you roll your ball of cotton
About the floor to please the cat.
See, here are stitches straggling wide,
And others reaching down so far ;
I’m very sure you have not tried
At all to-day to please mamma.
The little girl who will not sew
Should never be allowed to play ;
But then I hope, my love, that you
Will take more pains another day
Lazy Sal.
A lazy, lazy, lazy girl I
Her hair forever out of curl,
Her feet unshod, her hands unclean,
Her dress in tatters always seen.
Lounging here and dawdling there,
Lying out ’most anywhere
About the barn-yard. Not a thought
Of studying lessons as she ought ;
But happiest when in sunny weather
She and “ the other pig” together
Are playing tricks. No wonder, then,
The farmer, jolliest of men,
Is apt to say, when tired out [about,
With seeing her sprawling round
“ Beats all what ails that lazy gal!
Why, piggy’s twice as smart as Sal I"
The Work-hag.
To Jane her aunt a work-bag gave,
Of silk with flowers so gay,
That she a place might always have
To put her work away.
And then 'twas furnished quite com-
plete
With cotton, silk and thread,
And needles in a case so neat,
Of all the sizes made.
A little silver thimble, too,
Was there among the rest;
And a large waxen doll, quite new,
That waited to be dress’d.
But Jane was very fond of play.
And loved to toss her ball;
And I am quite ashamed to say,
She scarcely worked at all.
But if at any time she did,
’Twas but a stitch or two ;
And though she often has been bid,
But little more would do.
The pretty little bag, indeed,
Was hung upon her chair ;
But cotton, needles, silk, and thread
Were scattered here and there.
Her aunt, by chance, came in that day,
And asked if doll was dress’d ;
Miss Jane has been engaged in play,
And careless of the rest.
The silk, to make her little dress,
Was on the table laid,
And, with an equal carelessness,
The cap had also strayed.
With gauze and lace the floor was
strewed,
All in disorder lay,
When, bounding in with gesture rude,
Came Jane, returned from play.
She little thought her aunt to find,
And blushed to see her there;
It brought her carelessness to mind,
And what her doll should wear.
“Well, Jane, and where’s your doll,
my dear ?
I hope you’ve dress’d her now;
But there is such a litter here,
You best know when and how.’’
So spoke her aunt, and, looking round
The empty bag she spied ;
Poor Jane, who no excuse had foun 1,
Now hid her face and cried.
Since,” said her aunt, •* no work,
you do,
But waste your time in play ;
The work-bag, of no use to you,
I now shall take away.”
%
But now, with self-conviction, Jane
Her idleness confessed,
And ere her aunt could come again,
Her doll was neatly dress’d.
The Two Gardens.
When Harry and Dick
Had been striving to please,
Their father (to whom it was known)
Made two little gardens,
And stocked them with trees,
And gave one to each for his own.
Harry thank’d his papa,
And with rake, hoe, and spade,
Directly began his employ ;
And soon such a neat
Little garden was made,
That he panted with labour and joy.
There was always some bed
Or some border to mend,
Or something to tie or stick ;
And Harry rose early
His garden to tend,
While snoring lay indolent Dick.
The tulip, the rose,
And the lily so white,
United their beautiful bloom 1
And often the honey-bee
Stoop’d from his flight,
To sip the delicious perfume.
A neat row of peas
In full blossom was seen,
French beans were beginning to shoot 1
And his gooseb'ries and currants,
Tho’ yet they were green,
Foretold him a plenty of fruit.
But Richard loved better
In bed to repose,
And snug as he curl’d himself round,
Forgot that no tulip,
Nor lily, nor rose,
Nor plant in his garden was found
Rank weeds and tall nettles
Disfigur’d his beds,
Nor cabbage nor lettuce v*as seen,
The slug and the snail
Show’d their mischievous heads,
And eat ev’ry leaf that was green.
Thus Richard the idle,
Who shrank from the cold,
Beheld his trees naked and bare ;
Whilst Harry the active
Was charmed to behold
The fruit of his patience and care.

Doing Nothing.
I asked a lad what was he doing;
“ Nothing, good sir,” said he to me.
“ By nothing well and long pursuing,
Nothing,” said I, “ you'll surely be.”
I asked a lad what he was thinking;
“ Nothing,” said he, “I do declare.”
“ Many,” said I, “ in vile inns drinking,
By idle minds were carried there.”
There’s nothing great, there’s nothing
wise,
Which idle hands and minds supply ;
Those who all thought and toil despise,
Mere nothings live, and nothings die
A thousand naughts are not a feather,
When in a sum they all are brought;
A thousand idle lads together
Are still but nothings joined to naught
&
And yet of merit they will boast, [haughty.
And sometimes pompous seem, an(
But still ’tis very plain to most, [naughty.
That “nothing” boys are mostly
Naughty lazy Boy who would not go to School.


Lazy Sam.
There was a lazy boy named Sara,
The laziest ever known,
Who spent his time in idleness,
Like any other drone.
He loved to lie in bed till noon,
With covers closely drawn,
And when he managed to get up
He’d yawn, and yawn, and yawn
If asked to do a simple task
He always would refuse,
And say that he was lame or sick,
His action to excuse;
And over pretty picture-books—
’Twas really very odd—
This lazy boy would soon begin
To nod, and nod, and nod.
If on an errand forced to go,
He’d slowly, slowly creep,
just like a snail; you might supp >se
That he was half asleep.
And those who would despatch in haste
A note, or telegram,
Would choose a swifter messenger
Than such a lazy Sam.
If he was caught out in a storm
’Twould drench him to the skin,
Because he was too indolent
To hurry to get in.
Deep in his trouser’s pockets he
His idle hands would cram,
And children crowded to the doors
To look at lazy Sam.
This lazy boy would lounge about
The docks, and often wish
That he could carry home to cook
A string of nice, fresh fish;
But though he was provided with
A reel extremely fine,
Said Sam “1 do not think ’twill pay
To wet my fishing line!”
Oh, Sam was always late at meals,
And always late at school,
And everybody said that he
Would be a first-class fool.
For boys not half so old as he
Above him swiftly pass.
While Sam, the great big dunce! remains
The lowest in the class.
In every way, and every day
This lazy boy would shirk,
And never lift his hand to do
A bit of useful work.
His clothes were always on awry,
His shoe-strings left untied,
His hair uncombed, his teeth uncleaned,
Alas, he had no pride!
And so he went from bad to worse—
The good-for-nothing scamp!—
Until he settled down to be
A ragged, dirty tramp.
Through cities, towns, and villages,
He begged his daily bread,
And slept at night wherever he
Could chance to find a bed.
Men shuddered as they passed him by,
And murmured sadly, “Oh!
How can a human being sink
So very, very low?”
And e’en the jackass pricks his ears,
And brays aloud “I am
Not such a donkey, I declare
As yonder lazy Sam! ”
Tlie Beggar Man.
Abject, stooping, old, and wan,
See yon wretched beggar-man;
Once a father’s hopeful heir,
Once a mother’s tender care.
When too young to understand,
He but scorched his little hand,
By the candle’s flaming light
Attracted —dancing, spiral, bright.
Clasping fond her darling round,
A thousand kisses healed the wound,
Now abject, stooping, old and wan,
No mother tends the beggar-man.
Then nought too good for him to wear,
With cherub face and flaxen hair,
In fancy’s choicest gauds arrayed,
Cap of lace with rose to aid,
Milk-white hat and feather blue,
Shoes of red, and coral too,
With silver bells to please his ear,
And charm the frequent ready tear.
Now abject, stooping, old, and wan,
Neglected is the beggar-man.
See the boy adv ance in age,
And learning spreads her useful page;
In vain! for giddy pleasure calls,
And shows the marbles, tops, and ball -,
What’s learningto thecharmsof play?
The indulgent tutor must give way.
A heedless, wilful dunce, and wild.
The parents’ fondness spoil'd the child;
The youth in vagrant courses ran ;
Now abject, stooping, old, and wan,
Their fondling is the beggar-man.

Good-for-nothing lazy Man.
A good-for-nothing lazy lout,
Wicked within and ragged without.
Who can bear to have him about?
Turn him out! Turn him out I
The Old Beggar Man.
I see an old man sitting there,
His withered limbs are almost bare,
And very hoary is his hair.
Old man, why are you sitting so?
For very cold the wind doth blow:
Why don’t you to your cottage go?
Ah, master, in the world so wide,
I have no home wherein to hide,
No comfortable fire-side.
When I, like you, was young and
gay.
I’ll tell you what I used to say,
That I would nothing do but play.
And so, instead of being taught
Some useful business as I ought,
To play about was all I sought.
And now that I am old and grey,
1 wander on my lonely way,
And beg my bread from day to day
But oft I shake my hoary head,
And many a bitter tear I shed,
To think the useless life I've led.

Lazyland.
Three travellers wandered along the
strand,
Each with a staff in his feeble hand !
And they chanted low :
“ We are go-o-o-
Ing slow-o-ow-
Ly to Lazyland.
" They’ve left off eating and drinking
there;
They never do any thinking there;
They never walk,
And they never talk,
And they fall asleep without winking
there.
“ Nobody’s in a hurry there;
They are not permitted to worry there;
’Tis a wide, still place,
And not a face
Shows any symptom of flurry there.
“ No bells are rung in the morning there,
They care not at all for adorning there;
All sounds are hushed,
And a man who rushed
Would be treated with absolute scorning
there.
" They do not take any papers there ;
No politicians cut capers there;
They have no * views,’
And they tell no news,
And they burn no midnight tapers there.
“ No lovers are ever permitted there ;
Keformers are not admitted there;
They argue not
In that peaceful spot,
And their clothes all come ready-fitted
there.
“ Electricity has not been heard of there ;
And steam has been spoken no word of
there;
They stay where they are,
And a coach or a car
They have not so much as a third of there.
“ Oh, this world is a truly crazy land;
A worrying, hurrying, mazy land ;
We cannot stay,
We must find the way—
If there is a way —to Lazyland "

Lazy Willie.
Oh! Willie is a lazy boy,
A ” Sleepy Head” is he,
“Wake up! ” his little sister cries,
‘‘Wake up and talk to me.”
The birds are singing in the trees,
The sun is shining bright,
But sleepy Willy slumbers on
As though it yet were night.
Oh! lazy boys will never grow
To clever manhood, you must
know,
So lift your eyelids, sleepy head,
Wake up, and scramble out of bed.
The Lazy lioy.
The lazy boy! and what’s his name?
I should not like to tell ;
But don’t you think it is a shame,
That he can’t read or spell.
He’d rather swing upon a gate,
Or paddle in a brook,
Than take his pencil and his slate,
Or try to con a book.
There, see! he’s lounging down the
street,
His hat without a brim,
He rather drags than lifts his feet—
His face unwashed and grim.
He’s lolling now against a post;
But if you’ve seen him once,
You’ll know the lad among a host
For what he is—a dunce.
Don’t ask me what’s the urchin’s
name; . 1
I do not choose to tell;
But this you’ll know—it is the s, me
As his who does not blush for
shame
That he don’t read or spell
The Sluggard.
’Tis the voice of the sluggard;
I heard him complain,
“You have waked me too soon,
I must slumber again.”
As the door on its hinges,
So he on his bed [ders,
Turns his sides, and his shoul-
And his heavy head.
” A little more sleep
And a little more slumber;”
Thus he wastes half his days
And his hours without
number,
And when he gets up
He sits folding his hands,
Or walks about sauntering,
Or trifling he stands.
I'pass’d by his garden.
And saw the wild brier,
The thorn and the thistle
Grow broader and higher ;
The clothes that hung on him
Are turning to rags,
And his money still wastes
Till he starves or he begs.
I made him a visit,
Still hoping to find
That he took better care
For improving his mind ;
He told me his dreams,
Talked ofeatingand drinking,
But he scarce reads his Bible.
And never loves thinking.
Said I then to my heart,
“ Here’s a lesson for me ;
This man’s but a picture
Of what I might be ;
But thanks to my friends
For their care in my breeding,
Who taught me betimes
To love working and reading.’*

Idle Dicky and the
Goat.
John Brown is a man
Without houses or lands,
Himself he supports
By the work of his hands.
He brings home his wages
Each Saturday night.
To his wife and his children,
A very good sight.
His eldest boy, Dicky,
On errands when sent,
To loiter and chatter
Was very much bent;
The neighbours all call’d him
An odd little trout,
His shoes they were broke,
And his toes they peep’d out.
To see such old shoes
All their sorrows were rife ;
John Brown he much grieved,
And so did his wife,
He kiss’d his boy Dicky,
And stroked his white head,
" You shall have a new pair,
My dear boy," he then said.
” I’ve here twenty shillings,
And money has wings ;
Co first get this note changed,
I want other things.”
Now here comes the mischief—
This Dicky would stop
At an ill-looking, mean-looking
Greengrocer’s shop.
For here lived a chattering
Dunce of a boy;
To prate with this urchin
Gave Dicky great joy.
And now, in his boasting,
He shows him his note,
And now to the green-stall
Up marches a goat.
They laughed, for it was
This young nanny-goat’s way
With those who pass’d by her
To gambol and play.
All three they went on
In their frolicsome bouts.
Till Dick dropt the note
On a bunch of green sprouts.
Now what was Dick’s wonder
To see the vile goat,
In munching the green sprouts,
Eat up his bank note !
He crying ran back [news,
To John Brown with the
And by stopping to idle
He lost his new shoes.

Idleness and Mischief.
How doth the little busy bee
Improve each shining hour,
And gather honey all the day
From every opening flower.
How skilfully she builds her cell;
How neat she spreads the wax ;
And labours hard to store it well;
With the sweet food she makes.
In works of labour or of skill
I would be busy too ;
For Satan finds some mischief still
For idle hands to do.
In books, or work, or healthful play
'Let my first years be passed ;
That I may give for every day
Some good account at last.
WATTS.
Come and Go.
Dick Dawdle had land
Worth two hundred a year,
Yet from debt and from dunning
He never was free,
His intellect was not
Surprisingly clear,
But he never felt satisfied
How it could be.
The raps at his door,
And the rings at his gate.
And the threats of a gaol
He no longer could bear ,
So he made up his mind
To sell half his estate,
Which would pay all his debts,
And leave something to spare.
He leased to a farmer
The rest of his land
For twenty-one years;
And on each quarter-day
The honest man went
With his rent in his hand,
His liberal landlord
Delighted to pay.
Before half the term
Of the lease had expired,
The farmer, one day
With a bagful of gold,
Said, “ Pardon me, sir,
But I long have desired
To purchase my farm,
If the land can be sold.
“ Ten years I’ve been blest
With success and with health,
With trials a few—
I thank God, not severe—
I am grateful, I hope, [wealth,
Though not proud of my
But I’ve managed to lay
By a hundred a year.”
“ Why how,” exclaimed Dick,
“ Can this possibly be ?”
(With a stare of surprise,
And a mortified laugh,)
" The whole of my farm
Proved too little for me,
And you it appears,
Have grown rich upon half.”
” I hope you’ll excuse me,”
The farmer replies,
But I’ll tell you the cause,
If your honor would know ;
In two little words
All the difference lies,
I always say Come,
And you used to say Go.”
“ Well, and what does that
mean,
My good fellow ?” he said
“ Why that I
Always rise with the sun ;
You said ‘ Go’ to your man,
As you lay in your bed,
I say ‘ Come, Jack, with me,’ 1
And I see the work done ”

LAZINESS


CRUELTY LAND.
The Cruel Boy.
Tom sat at the kitchen window
Watching the folks go by;
But what he was really doing
Was pulling the legs from a fly.
Yes. there he sat in the twilight,
Tormenting the tiny things ;
First pulling their legs from their sockets,
And afterwards pulling their wings.
He knew not then that his father
Was standing behind his back ;
And very much wished to be giving
His cruel young fingers a crack.
But he waited till after dinner,
When Tommy was having a game;
Then he thought he would give him a
lesson,
And treat him a little the same.
So catching his son of a sudden,
And giving his elbow a twist;
He pulled his two ears till he shouted,
Then hit him quite hard with his fist.
And did he not roll on the carpet ?
And did he not cry out with pain ?
But, when he cried out, “ Oh, you hurt
me!"
His father would hit him again,
“ Why, Tom, all this is quite jolly,
You don’t seem to like it, my boy ;
And yet, when you try it on others.
You always are singing with joy ;
•• It seems very strange,” said his father,
And this time his nose had a pull;
But Tommy could stand it no longer;
He bellowed and roared like a bull.
“ Hush 1 hush 1 while I pull your right
leg off,
And scrape off the flesh from your shin:
What you often yourself do toothers,
Sure you do not think harm or a sin.
** Now, Tommy, my boy,” said his father,
“ You’ll leave these poor insects alone,
If not, I go on with my lesson.”
“ I will,” cried poor Tom, with a groan-
But hark 1 from the woodlands the sound
of a gun,
The wounded bird flutters and dies ;
Where can be the pleasure for nothing
but fun,
To shoot the poor thing as it flies ?
Or you, Mr. Butcher, and Fisherman, you
May follow your trades, I must own ;
So chimneys are swept, when they want
it—but who
Would sweep them for pleasure alone?
If men would but think of the torture
they give
To creatures that cannot complain,
They surely would let the poor animals
live,
And not make a sport of their pain.
The Worm
Turn, turn thy hasty foot aside.
Nor crush that helpless worm:
The frame thy wayward looks deride
Required a God to form.
The common Lord of all that move,
From whom thy being flow’d,
A portion of His boundless love
On that poor worm bestow’d.
The sun, the moon, the stars He made
To all his creatures free ;
And spreads o’er earth the grassy blade
For worms as well as thee.
Let them enjoy their little day,
Their lowly bliss receive;
Oh 1 do not lightly take away
The life thou canst not give.

That squirrel in the tree,
Frisking in fun and glee,
Is busy in his way,

Story of cruel Frederick.
Here is cruel Frederick, see I
A horrid wicked boy was he:
He caught the flies, poor little things,
And then tore off their tiny wings ;
He kill’d the birds, and broke the chairs,
And threw the kitten down the stairs;
And Oh 1 far worse than all beside,
He whipp’d his Mary, till she cried.
The trough was full, and faithful Tray
Came out to drink one sultry day:
He wagg’d his tail, and wet his lip,
When cruel Fred snatch’d up a whip,
And whipp’d poor Tray till he was sore,
And kick'd and whipp’d him more and more.
At this, good Tiay grew very red,
And growl'd and bit him till he bled:
Then you should only have been by,
To see how Fred did scream and cry!
So Frederick had to go to bed ;
His leg was very sore and redl
The doctor came and shook his head
And made a very great to-do,
And gave him nasty physic too.
Don’t throw Stones.
Boys, don’t throw stones 1
That kitten on the wall.
Sporting with leaves that fall,
Low jumping to and fro,
Now crouching soft and low,
Then grasps them with a spring
As if some living thing,


Boys caught Stealing Apples.
No one will See me.
“ No one will see me,”
Said little John Day,
For his father and mother
Were out of the way,
And he was at home
All alone;
“No one will see me,”
So he climbed on a chair,
And peeped in the cupboard
To see what was there,
Which of course he ought
Not to have done.
There stood in the cupboard,
So sweet and so nice,
A plate of plum-cake
In full many a slice.
And apples so ripe
And so fine;
“Now no one will see me,"
Said John to himself,
As he stretched out his arm
To reach up to the shelf;
“This apple, at least,
Shall be mine.”
John paused, and put back
The nice apple so red,
For he thought of the words
His kind mother had said,
When she left all these
Things in his care;
“ And no one will see me,”
Thought he, “’tis not true;
For I've read that God sees us
In all that we do,
And is with us
Everywhere.”
Well done, John;
Your father and mother obey,
Try ever to please them;
And mind what they say,
Even when they
Are absent from you;
And never forget that,
Though no one is nigh,
You cannot be hid from
The glance of God’s eye,
Who notices all
That you do.
Principle put to the
Test.
A youngster at school,
More sedate than the rest,
Had once his integrity
Put to the test:—
His comrades had plotted
An orchard to rob,
And asked him to go
And assist in the job.
He was very much shocked,
And answered, “Oh, no!
What! rob our poor neigh-
bour !
I pray you don’t go ;
Besides, the man’s poor,
His orchard’s his bread ;
Then think of his children,
For they must be fed.
“You speak very fine,
And you look very grave,
But apples we want,
And apples we’ll have ;
If you will go with us,
We’ll give you a share,
If not, you shall have
Neither apple nor pear.”
They spoke, and Tom pon-
dered—
“ I see they will go;
Poor man ! what a pity
To injure him so!
Poor man! I would save him
His fruit if I could,
But staying behind
Will do him no good.
"If this matter depended
Alone upon me,
His apples might hang
Till they dropped from
the tree; [them,
But since they will take
I think I’ll go too,
He will lose none by me,
Though I get a few.”
STEALING LAND.
The Boy and liis Mother.
In Jisop, we are told, a boy,
Who was his mother’s pride and joy,
At school a primer stole one day,
And homeward then did wend his way.
He told his mother of the theft,
While she, of principle bereft,
Patted him on the head and smil’d,
And said, “You are my own dear child."
She praised him for the cunning feat.
And gave him a nice apple sweet. «
In course of years the boy grew fast,
Till he became a man at last ;
But all the time he slyly stole—
Sometimes apiece—sometimes the whole,
Till, finally, he grew so bold,
He kill’d a man and took his gold.
The day on which he had to swing
Did a large crowd together bring.
Among the rest, his mother came,
And called him fondly by his name.
The sheriff gave him leave to tell
The broken-hearted dame farewell I
About his neck her arms she flung,
And cried, “Why must my child be hung?
He answered, “ Call me not your dear.”
And by one stroke bit off her ear ; [shame !
While all the crowd cried, “Oh! for
Not satisfied to blast her name,
You add this violence to one
Whose happiness you have undone! "
" Good people,” he replied, “ I’ll vow
I would not be a felon now
If my mother had only tried
To win me to the better side,
But when in infancy I took
What was not mine, a small torn book,
Instead of punishing the feat
She gave to me an apple sweet;
She prais’d me too, and softly smil’d,
And said, ‘ Y u are my own dear child!'
I tell you here, both foe and friend,
This is the cause of my sad end.”
Australian Blacks Stealing.
scruples thus silenced,
Tom felt more at ease,
And went with his comrades
The apples to seize:
He blamed and protested,
But joined in the plan ,
He shared in the plunder,
But pitied the man.

Advice.
Who steals a pin
Commits a sin.
Who tells a lie
Has cause to sigh.
When ask’d to go
And sin, say, No!
The guilty breast
Is ne’er at rest.
You must not sin
A world to win.
Why should you go
The way to woe.


Naughty Boys Stealing.
The Hoys and the Apple
Tree.
As Billy and Tommy
Were walking one day,
They came by a fine orchard side ;
They’d rather eat apples
Than spell, read, or play,
And Tommy to Billy then cried,
“ O brother, look ! see
What fine clusters hang there,
I’ll jump and climb over the wall ;
I will have an apple,
1 will have a pear,
Or else it shall cost me a fall.”
Said Billy to Tommy,
“ To steal is a sin,
Mamma has oft told this to thee ;
I never yet stole,
Nor now will begin,
So red apples hang on the tree.”
“You are a good boy,
As you ever have been,"
Said Tommy; let’s walk on, my lad ;
We’ll call on our school-fellow
Little Bob Green,
And to see us I know he’ll be glad.”
They came to a house,
And they rang at the gate,
And asked, "Pray, is Bobby at home?”
But Bobby’s good manners
Did not let them wait ;
He out of the parlour did come.
Bob smil’d, and he laugh’d,
And he caper’d with joy,
His little companions to view.
“We call’d in to see you,"
Said each little boy.
Said Bobby, " I’m glad to see you.
“ Come walk in our garden,
So large and so fine;
You shall, for my father gives leave ;
And more, he insists
That you’ll stay here to dine :
A rare jolly day we shall have ! ”
But when in the garden,
They found ’twas the same
They saw as they walk’d in the road ;
And near the high wall,
When these little boys came,
They started, as if from a toad.
. " That large ring of iron,
Which lies on the ground,
With terrible teeth like a saw,”
Said Bobby, “ the guard
Of our garden is found ;
It keeps wicked robbers in awe.
" The warning without,
If they should set at nought,
This trap tears their legs—O! so sad !”
Said Billy to Tommy,
“ So you'd have been caught,
A narrow escape you have had.”
Cried Tommy, " I’ll mind
What my good mamma says,
And take the advice of a friend ;
I never will steal
To the end of my days,
I've been a bad boy, but I’ll mend,”
Adelaide.
Honesty.
With honest heart go on your way,
Down to your burial sod,
And never for a moment stray
Beyond the path of God ;
And everything along your way
In colours bright shall shine;
The water from the jug of clay
Shall taste like costly wine!—Holtz.
Thou shalt not Steal.
On the goods that are not thine,
Little child, lay not thy finger;
Round thy neighbour’s better things
Let no wistful glances linger.
Pilfer not the smallest thing;
Touch it not, howe’er thou need it,
Though the owner have enough,
Though he know it not, nor need it.
Taste not the forbidden fruit,
Though resistance be a trial;
Grasping hand and roving eye.
Early teach them self-denial.
Upright heart and honest name
To the poorest are a treasure;
Better than ill-gotten wealth,
Better far than pomp and pleasure.
Poor and needy though thou art.
Gladly take what God has given;
With clean hands and humble heart,
Passing through this world to heaven
Tlie Thief.
Why should I deprive my neighbour
Of his goods against his will?
Hands were meant for honest labour,
Not to plunder, nor to steal
’Tis a foolish self-deceiving
By such tricks to hope for gain:
All that’s ever got by thieving
Turns to sorrow, shame, and pain.
Oft we see the young beginner
Practise little pilfering ways,
Till grown up a hardened sinner,
Then the gallows ends his days.
Theft will not be always hidden,
Though we fancy none can spy;
When we take a thing forbidden,
God beholds it with His eye.
Guard my heart, O God of heaven,
Lest it covet what’s not mine;
Lest I take what is not given,
Guard my heart and hands from sin

Tlic Thieves’ Ladder.
The girls were helping in the house,
With bustle and with show,
And told the boys to go away,
And not disturb them so.
And boys went whistling down the streets,
And looking in the shops
At tempting heaps of oranges,
And piles of sugar-drops.
" Here, Willie, to the grocer’s run ;
Be sharp, now—there’s a man,
And bring me home a pound of plums
As quickly as you can !
" Don’t touch a plum—be sure you don’t;
To-morrow you shall eat.’’
41 1 won’t,” he said, and, like a top,
Went spinning down the street.
The grocer weigh’d them in his scales,
And there was one too much ;
He took it out, and all was right,
The scale was to a touch.
He wrapp’d them up in whitey-brown,
And tied them with a string.
And put the money in the till,
As ’twere a common thing
Young Willie watched, with greedy eyes,
As this affair went on
The plums—they look'd so very nice;
He wouldn’t take but one
So going quick behind a post,
He tore the paper so
That he could take out two or three,
And nobody would know.
There was a little voice that said,
Close by. in Willie’s heart, [plum —
" Don’t tear the hole —don’t take the
Don’t play a thievish part 1”
The little voice—it spoke in vain !
He reach’d his mother’s door ;
She did not see the hole he’d made,
His trouble then was o’er.
And what a trifling thing it seem’d,
To take one single plum !
A little thing we hold between
Our finger and our thumb.
And yet. upon that Christmas eve,
That period so brief,
Young Willie set his foot upon
"The ladder of the thief 1”
And as he lay awake that night,
He heard his parents speak ;
He heard distinctly what they said,
The blood rush’d to his cheek.
He lay and listen’d earnestly ;
They might have found him out,
And he might get a flogging too,
’Twas that he thought about.
A guilty person cannot rest,
He always is in fear;
Not knowing what may happen next
To make his guilt appear.
So, when he heard his mother speak,
He rose up in his bed,
And did not lose a syllable
Of every word she said :
"We have not any turnips, John,
I could not spare the pence;
But you can go and get us some
Through Farmer Turner’s fence.
" There’s nobody to see you now,
The folks are off the road ;
The night looks dark and blustering,
And no one is abroad.
“ It is not far—you’ll soon be back
I’ll stand outside to hear ;
The watchman now is off his track,
And won’t be coming near.”
The father he went softly out,
And down the lane he crept,
And stole some turnips from the field
Whilst honest people slept 1
’Tis not the words that parents say,
It is their very deed ;
Their children know the difference,
And follow where they lead.
How often, if their lives are good,
Their children’s are the same; [bad,
Whilst, if they’re thievish, drunken,
Their children come to shame 1
Now, Willie laid him down in bed,
His conscience found relief ;
“ I’m not the only one,” he said—
"My father is a thief 1
" How foolish ’twas to be afraid
About a little plum 1 ”
He pull’d the bed-clothes o’er his head,
And dream'd of feasts to come.
On Christmas-day they had the pies,
The turnips, and the beef;
And Willie’s foot was firm upon
The ladder of the thief.
And ere the snow was on the plain,
And Christmas-day came round,
And boys were sliding, once again,
Upon the frozen ground,
He, step by step, had further gone
Upon that dreadful road
That brings a man to misery,
And takes him far from God.
He cheated with his marbles first,
And then at other play ;
He pilfered any little thing
That came within his way.
His parents did not punish him ;
He went from bad to worse,
Until he grew so confident,
He stole a lady’s purse.
Then he was seized, and brought before
The city magistrate;
And the police and lady came
The robbery to state.
And Willie he was proved a thief,
And nothing had to say ;
So to the dreadful prison-house
He soon was led away.
In vain he cried, and pleaded hard
They would not take him there ;
He would not do such things again
If they would hear his prayer.
It was too late I The prison door,
With bolt, and bar, and chain,
Was opened to take Willie in,
And then was shut again.
He saw the handcuffs on the wall,
The fetters on the floor ;
And heavy keys with iron rings
To lock the dungeon door.
He saw the little, lonely cells
Where prisoners were kept,
And all the dreary passages,
And bitterly he wept.
And through the strong-barred iron
grate,
High up and far away,
He saw a piece of clear blue sky
Out in the blessed day.
And "Oh!” he said, "my brothers now
Are out of school again,
And playing marbles on the path,
Or cricket on the plain.
" And here am I, shut up so close
Within this iron door;
If ever I get out again
I’ll give this business o’er.”
And Willie went to sleep that night
In his dark cell alone ;
But often in his troubled dreams
He turned with heavy moan.
What sound is that at early morn
That breaks upon his ear ?
A funeral bell is tolling slow,
It tolls so very near.
And in the court he sees a crowd,
So haggard and so pale,
And they are whispering fearfully
A sad and awful tale.
And all seem looking at a man
Who stands with fetters bound,
And guards and executioner
Are gathered close around.
And he beheld that wretched man,
Who trembled like a leaf:
His foot no more would stand upon
The ladder of the thief.
For he had climbed it step by step,
Till murder closed the whole ;
The hangman came to take his life,
But where would be his soul ?
And still the bell went tolling on ;
It tolled so heavily
As that young man went up the stairs,
Out to the gallows-tree.
It tolled—it tolled—Oh! heavy sound!
It stopped—the deed is o’er ;
And that young man upon the earth
Will now be seen no more:
Oh ! parents watch your little ones,
Lest you have such a grief;
Help not their tender feet to climb
The ladder of the thief.
I have not heard young Willie’s end,
I hope he learned that day ;
But 'tis a thing most difficult
To leave a wicked way. — Sewell.

SANTA CLAUS LAND.
I have given no Fairy Tales in this Childland. For in this matter-of-fact age belief in Fairy Tales and all kinds of wonderful fictions is
fast vanishing, Santa Claus, the “bestest” “goodest” fairy of all alone remains: and even he is gradually being doubted by all but the most
innocent children, but as he as a personality is still largely amongst us, I give his popular history culled from many sources.
SANTA CLAUS LAND.
At the top of the earth, which they call the North Pole,
Is where Santa Claus lives, a right jolly old soul!
And the ice and the snow lie so thick on the ground
T he sun cannot melt them the whole summer round.
All wrapped up in furs from his head to his toes,
No feeling of coldness dear Santa Claus knows,
But travels about with a heart full of joy,
As happy as if he were only a boy.
His cheeks are like roses; his eyes are as bright
As stars that shine out overhead in the night,
And they twinkle as merrily too all the while,
And broad as a sunbeam is Santa Claus’ smile.
He never is idle except when asleep,
And even in dreams at his labours will keep,
And all thro’ the day and the night, it is true.
He is working and planning, dear children, for you.
On top of his tower with spy-glass in hand,
He goes every morning to look o’er the land,
And though there are hills all around, I suppose,
He sees, oh, much farther than any one knows.
He peeps into houses whose doors are tight shut;
He looks through the palace, and likewise the hut;
He gazes on cities, and villages small,
And nothing, no, nothing is hidden at all,
He knows where the good children live beyond doubt,
He knows where the bad boys and girls are about,
And writes down their names on a page by themselves;
In a book that he keeps on his library shelves.
For good little children, the gentle and kind.
The prettiest presents of toys are designed,
And when Christmas comes round, as it does once a year,
’Tis certain that Santa Claus then will appear.
His work-shop is, oh I such a wonderful place,
With heaps of gay satins, and ribbons, and lace ;
With houses and furniture, dishes and pans.
And bracelets and bangles, and all sorts of fans.
There are horses that gallop, and dollies that walk.
And some of the pretty doll-babies can talk.
There are pop-guns, and marbles, and tops for the boys,
And big drums and trumpets that make a big noise.
There are games for all seasons, the base-ball and kite,
And books which the children will seize with delight,
And the skates and the sleds, far too many to count,
And the bicycles ready for wheelmen to mount.
There are farm-yards in plenty, with fences and trees,
And cows, sheep, and oxen, all taking their ease,
And turkeys and ducks, and fine chickens and hens,
And dear little piggies to put in their pens.
There are gay Noah’s Arks, just as full as can be
Of animals, really a wonder to see ;
There are lions and tigers, and camels and bears,
And two of each kind, for they travel in pairs.
There are elephants stretching their noses quite long;
And reindeer and elks with their antlers so strong,
And queer kangaroos all the others amid,
With their dear little babies in pockets well hid.
Is Santa Claus happy ? There’s no need to ask,
For he finds such enjoyment indeed in his task,
That he bubbles with laughter, and whistles and sings,
While making and planning the beautiful things.
He’s a jolly good fellow, but ever so shy,
And likes to do all his good deeds on the sly,
So there’s no use spoiling a nice winter’s nap
For you’ll not catch a glimpse of the jolly old chap.
When Christmas Eve comes, into bed you must creep
And late in the night, when you all are asleep,
He is certain to come ; so your stockings prepare,
And hang them up close by the chimney with care.
The baby’s wee stockings you must not forget,
For Santa will have something nice for the pet,
And those who are thoughtful for others will find
The good saint at Christmas time has them in mind.
”1 here is lommy, who tended the baby with care,
A nice train of cars he shall have for his share,
And how happy will Eliza be when she looks
For her presents, and finds such a budget of books
For dear little Mary, a doll there will be;
And for Alice and Jennie a gay Christmas tree;
And wee little Georgie, the baby, will find
A big stick of candy, just suiting his mind.
Oh, a jolly good sight is this funny old chap
When he’s dressed in his bear-skin and fur-bordered cap.
All ready to start on his way through the cold,
In a sleigh covered over with jewels and gold.
While his deer from the mountains all harnessed with care,
Like race-horses prance through the clear frosty air;
’Tis fun just to watch them, and hear the bells ring,
And the stars seem to think it a comical thing.
For old Santa is bundled so close to the chin,
That there is not a chance for the cold to get in,
His cheeks are so rosy, his eyes how they flash 1
No horses nor driver e’er cut such a dash !
He cracks his long whip, and he whistles a tune,
While he winks at the stars, and he bows to the moon,
And over the tree-tops he drives like the wind,
And leaves all the night-birds a long way behind.
His steeds speed away on their journey so fleet,
That they seem to have wings to their swift-flying feet.
For there’s work to be done by the cheery old man.
And his coursers will help him as well as they can.
His sleigh is with toys and trinkets well packed,
You never beheld one with pleasures so stacked;
And though of good children he has such a list.
Not one is forgotten, not one will be missed.
An army he gives to the boy who is neat,
And never is rude in the house or the street;
And a farm to the lad who goes smiling to school,
Who knows all his lessons and minds every rule.
And if you would please him—dear Bertie and Jack—
And win a nice prize from the old fellow’s pack.
Be good little children, your parents obey,
And strive to be happy at work or at play.
At Christmas old Santa Claus toils like a Turk,
For the cheery old fellow is fond of his work.
With his queer looking team through the air he will go.
And alight on the house-tops all covered with snow.
Then down through the chimneys he’ll dart without noise
And fill up the stockings with candy and toys.
There’ll be presents for Julia, and Nellie, and Jack,
And plenty more left in the old fellow’s pack.
And if Frank behaves well, and minds what is said,
Quits teasing the cat and goes early to bed;
He’ll find for his present a sled or a gun,
A ready companion in frolic and fun.
On Santa Claus hurries, and works with a will,
For many tall Christmas trees he has to fill,
And loads them with treasures from out his’rich store,
Till they blossom as trees never blossomed before.
Though round as a dumpling, and ever so fat,
In running and climbing he's spry as a cat,
And if the long ladder should happen to break,
And he should fall down, what a crash it would m ike 1
I told you his home was up North by the Pole,
In a palace of hives lives this worthy old soul, ’
And though out of doors it may furiously storm,
Indoors as we know, it is sunny and warm.
When Christmas is over old Santa Claus goes
To his home in the North, and his well-earned repose
And when he is rested and feeling tip-top,
The good-natured workman goes back to his shop.
And there will he labor from morning till night,
To make others happy his aim and delight.
And if his good-will the dear children would earn,
They must strive to be happy and good in return.
He comes like an angel of light from above,
To do on the earth sweetest errands of love:
And oui hearts and our homes to so fill with good cheer
That we cannot help knowing when Christmas is near.
Then let us be glad, so that Christmas may be
A real Merry Christmas to you and to me!
And now that the story is ended we’ll give'
Three cheeis for old Santa Claus I Long may he live I


Children Praying for Christinas Presents.
A Visit From St. Nicholas.
'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through
the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.
The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced through their
heads;
And mamma in her kerchief and I in my cap
Had just settled our brains for a long winter’s nap,
When out in the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash.
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash ;
The moon, on the breast of the new-fallen snow,
Gave a lustre of midday to objects below ;
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,
With a little old driver so lively and quick
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled and shouted and called them by
name;
‘‘Now Dasher! now, Dancer ! now, Prancer and
Vixen!
On Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzenl
To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall,
Now, dash away, dash away, dash away all! ”
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,
So up to the housetop the coursers they flew,
With a sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too;
And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound,
He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and
soot;
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack,
His eyes, how they twinkled 1 his dimples, how
merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry.
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard on his chin was as whiteas the snow.
He was chubby and plump —a right jolly old elf—
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle;
But I heard him exclaim ere he drove out of sight,
“Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night.’’

SANTA CLAUS T. ATSTU.


Santa Claus looking in his Big Diary for the
Names of Boys and Girls who have been
Good since last Christmas.
Christmas.
When the children have been good,
That is, be it understood,
Good at meal-times, good at play,
Good all night and good at day,—
They shall have the pretty things
Merry Christmas always brings.
Santa Clans starting to distribute Toys.
A Christmas Eve Adventure.
Once on a time, in a queer little town.
On the shore of the Zuyder Zee,
When all the good people were fast asleep.
A strange thing happened to me.
Alone, the night before Christmas,
I sat by the glowing fire.
Watching the flame as it rose and fell.
While the sparks shot high and higher
Suddenly one of these sparks began
To flicker and glimmer and wink
Like a big bright eye, till I hardly knew
What to do or to say or to think.
Quick as a flash, it changed to a face,
And what in the world did I see
But dear old Santa Claus nodding his head
And waving his hand to me!
“Oh ! follow me, follow me !” soft he cried,—
And up through the chimney with him
I mounted, not daring to utter a word
Till we stood on the chimney’s rim
'Now tell me, I beg you, dear Santa Claus.
Where am I going with you?”
He laughingly answered, “Why. don’t you
know ?
To travel the wide world through !
' From my crystal palace, far in the North,
I have come since dark, —and see
These curious things for the little folk
Who live on the Zuyder Zee."
Then seating himself in his reindeer sledge.
And drawing me down by his side,
He whistled, and off on the wings of the wind
We flew for our midnight ride.
But first, such comical presents he left
For the little Dutch girls and boys,—
Onions and sausages, wooden-faced dolls,
Cheeses and gingerbread toys!
Away we hurried far to the South,
To the beautiful land of France ;
And there we showered the loveliest gifts,—
Flaxen-haired dolls that could dance,
Soldiers that marched at the word of
command.
Necklaces, bracelets and rings,
Tiny gold watches, all studded with gems,
And hundreds of exquisite things.
Crossing the Channel, we made a short call
In Scotland and Ireland, too ;
Left a warm greeting for England and Wales
Then over the ocean we flew
Straight to America, where by myself,
Perched on a chimney high,
I watched him scramble and bustle about
Between the earth and the sky.
Many a stocking he filled to the brim,
And numberless Christmas trees
Burst into bloom at his magical touch !
Then all of a sudden a breeze
Caught us and bore us away to the South,
And afterwards blew us “out West; ”
And never till dawn peeped over the hills
Did we stop for a moment’s rest.
“Christmas is coming!” he whispered to me.
" You can see his smile in the sky,—
I wish Merry Christmas to all the world !
My work is over, —good-bye ! ”
Like a flash he was gone, and I was alone.-
For all of this happened to me
Once on a time, In a queer little town
On the shore of the Zuyder Zee!
M M
Little Bennie.
I had told him, Christmas morning,
As he sat upon my knee,
Holding fast his little stockings,"
Stuffed as full as full can be,
And attentive listening to me,
With a face demure and mild,
That old Santa Claus, who filled them,
Did not love a naughty child.
“But we’ll be good, won’t we, moder?”
And from off my lap he slid.
Digging deep among the goodies
In his crimson stockings hid.
While I turned me to my table,
Where a tempting goblet stood.
Brimming high with dainty custard.
Sent me by a neighbour good.
But the kitten, there before me,
With his white paw, nothing loth,
Sat, by way of entertainment,
Lapping off the shining froth ;
And, in not the gentlest humour
At the loss of such a treat,
I confess I rather rudely
Thrust him out into the street.
Then how Bennie’s blue eyes kindled:
Gathering up the precious store
He had busily been pouring
In his tiny pinafore,
With a generous look that shamed me
Sprang he from the carpet bright,
Showing, by his mien indignant,
All a baby’s sense of right.
“ Come back, Harney,” called he
loudly,
As he held his apron white,
“You shall have my candy wabbit
But the door was fastened tight.
So he stood, abashed and silent,
In the centre of the floor,
With defeated look, alternate
Bent on me and on the door.
Then, as by some sudden impulse.
Quickly ran he to the fire,
And while eagerly his bright eyes
Watched the flames grow high and
higher,
In a brave, clear key he shouted.
Like some lordly little elf.
' S mta Kaus, comedown the chimney,
Make my mother 'have herself.”
“I’ll be a good girl, Bennie,”
Said I, feeling the reproof;
And straightway recalled poor
Harney,
Mewing on the gallery roof.
Soon the anger was forgotten,
Laughter chased away the frown,
And they gambolled ’neath the live
oaks,
Till the dusky night came down.
In my dim, fire-lighted chamber
Harney purred beneath my chair,
And my play-worn boy beside me
Knelt to say his evening prayer ;
“God bess fader, God bess moder,
God bess sister,” then a pause,
And the sweet young lips devoutly
Murmured “God bess Santa Kaus.”
He is sleeping : brown and silken
Lie the lashes, long and meek.
Like caressing, clinging shadows,
On his plump and peachy cheek ;
And I bend above him, weeping,
Thankful tears; O undefiled ;
For a woman’s crown of glory,
For the blessing of a child

SANTA TjA'NT).


Old Santa Claus.
Old Santa Claus sat alone in his den,
With his leg crossed over his knee ;
While a comical look peeped out at his eyes,
For a funny old fellow was he.
His queer little cap was tumbled and torn,
And his wig it was all awry;
But he sat and mused the whole day long,
While the hours went flying by.
He had been as busy as busy can be,
In filling his pack with toys;
He had gathered his nuts and baked his pies,
To give to the girls and boys.
There were dolls for the girls, and whips for the
boys,
With wheelbarrows, horses, and drays.
And bureaus and trunks for Dolly’s new clothes ;
All these in his pack he displays.
Of candy too, both twisted and striped,
He had furnished a plentiful store;
While raisins and figs, and prunes and grapes,
Hung up on a peg by the door.
“I am almost ready," quoth he, quoth he,
"And Christmas is almost here ;
But one thing more—l must write a book.
And give to each one this year.' 1
So he clapped his specs on his little round nose,
And seizing the stump of a pen,
He wrote more lines in one little hour
Than you ever could write in ten.
He told them stories all pretty and new,
And wrote them all out in rhyme ;
Then packed them away with his box of toys
To distribute one at a time.
And Christmas Eve, when all were in bed,
Right down the chimney he flew ;
And stretching the stocking-leg out at the top,
He clapped in a book for you.
Santa Claus and the Mouse.
One Christmas eve, when Santa Claus
Came to a certain house,
To fill the children’s stockings there,
He found a little mouse.
"A merry Christmas, little friend,"
Said Santa, good and kind.
"The same to you, sir ! " said the
mouse,
" I thought you wouldn’t mind
If I should stay awake to night.
And watch you for a while."
' You’re very welcome, little mouse, 1 '
Said Santa, with a smile.
And then he filled the stockings up,
Before the mouse could wink, —
From toe to top, from top to toe,
There wasn't left a chink.
"Now, they won’t hold another thing,"
Said Santa Claus with pride.
A twinkle came in mousie’s eyes,
But humbly he replied :
"It's not polite to contradict —
Your pardon 1 implore, —
But in the fullest stocking there,
I could put one thing more.”
"Oh, ho!" laughed Santa,"silly mouse!
Don't I know how to pack ?
By filling stockings all these years,
I should have learned the knack."
And then he took the stocking down
From where it hung so high,
And said : " Now put in one thing
more;
I give you leave to try.”
The mousie chuckled to himself.
And then he softly stole
Right to the stocking’s crowded toe,
And gnawed a little hole !
"Now, ifyou please,good Santa Claus,
I've put in one thing more ;
For you will own, that little kole
Was not in there before.’
How Santa Claus did laugh and
laugh ;
And then he gaily spoke;
"Well, you shall have a Christmas
cheese
For that nice little joke."
The Night Before Christmas.
Curly heads, so softly pillowed ;
Chubby arms outspread;
Thousand fancies swiftly flying
Through each little head.
Clasping treasures newly garnered,
Dolly, book, and ball,
Still they dream of coming pleasures
Greater than them all.
Christmas-trees of gorgeous beauty,
Filled with presents rare ;
Toys unheard of, joys unnumbered,
All delights are there.
Angel forms, with smiling faces,
I lover round the bed ;
Angel feet make echoing music
As they lightly tread.
Angel voices, softly thrilling.
Chant a lullaby;
"Darlings, dream, and sweetly slumber,
We are watching by.”
Who from dreams like these would
waken
To a world of pain ?
"Hush, then, dear ones! Have we
roused you?
Turn and dream again."
Baby waking up nearly caught Santa Claus.
A Nice Little Present.
"Our Santa Claus," cried Bettie,
"Is nice as any other;
He brought the nicest present
To me and to my mother.
"It was—oh, you can’t guess it—
A darling little brother.
He kicks and cries, and shuts his
eyes,
And he’s sweet enough to eat.
"I’d rather have my baby brother
Than dolls or candy—so would
mother."

Annie and Willie’s Prayer.
’Twas the eve before Christmas ; good night had been said,
And Annie and Willie had crept into bed.
There were tears on their pillows, and tears in their eyes,
And each litttle bosom was heaving with sighs;
For to-night their stern father’s command had been given.
That they should retire precisely at seven
Instead of at eight; for they troubled him more
With questions unheard of than ever before.
He had told them he thought this delusion a sin ;
No such creature as "Santa Claus” ever had been ;
And he hoped, after this, he should never more hear
How he scrambled down chimneys with presents each year
And this was the reason that two little heads
So restlessly tossed on their soft, downy beds.
Eight, nine, and the clock on the steeple tolled ten ;
Not a word had been spoken by either till then ;
When Willie’s sad face from the blanket did peep,
And he whispered ; "Dear Annie, is ’ou fast asleep ? ”
"Why, no, Brother Willie,” a sweet voice replies;
"I’ve long tried in vain, but I can’t shut my eyes;
"For somehow it makes me so sorry because
Dear Papa has said there is no Santa Claus.
Now we know there is, and it can’t be denied
For he came every year before dear mamma died ;
"But then, I’ve been thinking, that she used to pray,—
And God would hear everything dear mamma would say,—
And, maybe, she asked him to send San'a Claus here
With the sack full of presents he brought every year.”
“Well, why tannot we p’ay, dust as mamma did, den.
And ask Dod to send him with presents aden ? ”
"I’ve been thinking so, too ; ” and without a word more
Four little bare feet bounded out on the floor,
And four little knees on the soft carpet pressed,
And two tiny hands were clasped close to each breast.
"Now, Willie, you know, we must firmly believe
That the presents we ask for we’re sure to receive ;
"You must wait just as still till I say the ‘Amen,’
And by that you will know that your turn has come then.—
"Dear Jesus, look down on my brother and me,
And grant us the favours we’re asking of Thee.
"I want a wax dolly, a tea-set and a ring,
And an ebony work-box that shuts with a spring.
Bless papa, dear Jesus, and cause him to see
That Santa Claus loves us as much as does he.
"Don’t let him get fretful and angry again,
At dear brother Willie and Annie. Amen."
"Dear Desus, ’et Santa Taus turn down to night
And bring us some p’esents before it is ’ight;
"I want he sood div’me a nice little sled,
Wid bight shinin’ ’unners, and all painted ’ed
A box full of tandy, a book, and a toy,
Amen. And den, Desus, I’ll be a dood boy."
Their prayers being ended, they raised up their heads,
And with hearts light and cheerful again sought their beds;
They were soon lost in slumber both peaceful and deep,
And with fairies in dreamland were roaming in sleep
Eight, nine, and the little French clock had struck ten
Ere the father had thought of his children again ;
He seems now to hear Annie's self-suppressed sighs,
And to see the big tears stand in Willie’s bluc'eyes
"I was harsh with my darlings," he mentally said,
"And should not have sent them so early to bed;
But then I was troubled : my feelings found vent;
For bank-stock to-day has gone down two per cent.;
"But of course they’ve forgotten their troubles ere this,
And that I denied them the thrice-asked-for kiss;
But just to make sure I’ll steal up to their door—
To my darlings I never spoke harshly before.”
So saying, he softly ascended the stairs,
And arrived at the door to hear both of their prayers;
His Annie’s "Bless papa” drew forth the big tears.
And Willie’s grave promise fell sweet on his ears
"Strange, strange ! I’d forgotten,” he said with a sigh,
"How I longed when a child to have Christmas draw nigh
I’ll atone for my harshness,” he inwardly said,
"By answering their prayers ere I sleep in my bed.”
Then he turned to the stairs, and softly went down,
Threw off velvet slippers and silk dressing-gown.
Donned hat, coat, and boots, and was out in the street,
A millionaire facing the cold, driving sleet!
Nor stopped he until he had bought everything,
From the box full of candy to the tiny gold ring :
Indeed, he kept adding so much to his store,
That the various presents outnumbered a score.
Then homeward he turned, when his holiday load,
With Aunt Mary’s help, in the nursery was stow’d.
Miss Dolly was seated beneath a pine tree,
By the side of a table spread out for her tea;
A work-box, well-filled, in the centre was laid,
And on it the ring for which Annie had pray’d.
A soldier in uniform stood by a sled,
With bright shining runners, and all painted red.
There were balls, dogs, and horses ; books pleasing to see ;
And birds of all colours were perched in the tree;
While Santa Claus, laughing, stood up in the top,
As if getting ready more presents to drop.
Now, as the fond father the picture surveyed,
He thought for his trouble he’d amply been paid;
And he said to himself, as he brushed off a tear,
"I’m happier to night than I have been for a year;
"I’ve enjoyed more true pleasure than ever before ;
What care I if bank-stock fall two per cent, more !
Henceforward I’ll make it a rule, I believe,
To have Santa Claus visit us each Christmas-eve,”
So thinking, he gently extinguished the light,
And, slipping downstairs, retired for the night.
As soon as the beams of the bright morning sun
Put the darkness to flight, and the stars one by one,
Four little blue eyes out of sleep opened wide,
And at the same moment the presents espied.
Then out of their beds they sprang with a bound,
And the very gifts prayed for were all of them found.
And they laughed and they cried in their innocent glee,
And shouted for papa to come quick and see
What presents old Santa Claus brought in the night
(Just the things that they wanted 1), and left before light.
"And now,” added Annie, in voice soft and low,
"You’ll believe there’s a Santa Claus, papa, I know ; ”
While dear little Willie climbed up on his knee,
Determined no secret between them should be ;
And told, in soft whispers, how Annie had said
That their blessed mamma, so long ago dead,
Used to kneel down and pray by the side of her chair,
And that God up in heaven had answered her prayer.
"Den we dot up and p’ayed just as well as we tood,
And Dod answered our p’ayer ; now wasn’t He dood ? ”
“I should say that He was, if He sent you all these,
And knew just what presents my children would please.”
(" Well, well, let him think so, the dear little elf!
’Twould be cruel to tell him I did it myself.”)
Blind tather ! who caused your stern heart to relent,
And the hasty words spoken so soon to repent ?
’Twas the Being who bade you steal softly upstairs
And made you His agent to answer their prayers.

Boy Nailing up his Father’s Trousers.
Budds’ Christmas Stocking.
It was Christmas-time, as all the world knew;
It stormed without, and the cold wind blew,
But within all was cheerful, snug, and bright,
With glowing fires and many a light.
Budd B. was sent quite early to bed,
His stocking was hung up close to his head,
And he said to himself “When all grows still
I will find a big stocking for Santy to fill.”
Now, good, honest Hans, who worked at the house,
Had gone to his bed as still as a mouse ;
The room where he slept was one story higher
Than Budd’s little room, with gaslight and fire.
Now, Hans loved “the poy,” and petted him too,
And often at night, when his task was all through,
He would tell him strange stories of over the sea,
While Budd listened gravely or laughed out in glee.
This night Hans had promised to wake Budd at four;
He would softly come down and open his door,
But suddenly Budd bounded out of his bed,
And stole softly up to the room overhead.
On his hands and his knees he crept softly in,
"I’ll borrow Hans’s stocking,” he said, with a grin;
Old Santy will fill it up to the top,
And Hans —oh, such fun I will be mad as a hop."
He moved very slowly, and felt near the bed;
No stocking was there, but down on his head
Came a deluge of water, well sprinkled with ice,
While honest Hans held him as if in a vice
'Vat ish dat?” he cried out; “von robber I find,
Den I pound him, and shake him, so much as I mind"
“It’s me,” called out Budd; “stop, Hans! oh, please do;
I’m only a boy ; I could not rob you.”
But Hans did not pause—his temper was hot—
And he dragged the young robber at once from the spot,
When he reached the hall light great was his surprise
To find his young master with tears in his eyes.
“I wanted your stocking,” muttered Budd B. ;
It is bigger than mine; boo hoo ! I can’t see,
And I’m all wet and cold,” thus Budd cried aloud,
Until guests and his parents ran up in a crowd.
He was wrapped up with care and taken to bed,
But, strangest of all, not a harsh word was said.
He flattered himself as he fell fast asleep
That Hans and his friends the secret would keep.
Next morning, when Christmas songs filled all the air,
Budd found, to his grief and boyish despair,
That his neck was so stiff he could not turn his head,
And must spend the whole day alone in his bed.
What was worse, his own stocking hung limp on a chair,
And on it these words in writing most fair :
“To him who is greedy I leave less than all;
The world is so large and my reindeer so small.
"My pack is elastic when children are kind,
But it shuts with a snap and leaves nothing behind,
When a boy or a girl is selfish or mean.
Good-bye, little Budd, I am off with my team.
(Signed) Santa Claus.”
Christmas.
Again the Christmas holidays have come,
We soon will hear the trumpet and the drum ;
We’ll hear the merry shout of the girls and boys
Rejoicing o’er their gifts of books and toys.
Old Santa Claus comes by at dead of night,
And down the chimney creeps—a funny sight;
He fills the stockings full of books and toys,
But puts in whips for naughty girls and boys.
One Christmas-eve the moon shone clear and
bright;
I thought I’d keep awake and watch all night,
But it was silent all around and stilled,
Yet in the morn I found my stockings filled,
Christmas Morning.
They put me in a great spare bed. and there they bade me sleep;
I must not stir; I must not wake; I must not even peep;
Right opposite that lonely bed, my Christmas stocking hung;
While near it, waiting for the morn, my Sunday clothes were flung.
I counted softly, to myself, to ten, and ten times ten,
And went through all the alphabet, and then began again ;
I repeated that Fifth-Reader piece—a poem called “Repose,"
And tried a dozen various ways to fall into a dose—
When suddenly the room grew light. I heard a soft, strong bound,
'Twas Santa Claus, I felt quite sure, but dared not look around.
'Twas nice to know that he was there, and things were going rightly,
And so I took a little nap, and tried to smile politely.
"Ho ! Merry Christmas! ” cried a voice ; I felt the bed a-rocking;
Twas daylight—brother Bob was up 1 and oh, that splendid stocking I

What the Rich Man’s Child got.
Little Nellie’s Visit from Santa Clans’
Santa Claus is coming to-night, papa ;
Please let me sit up and see him, mamma;
Loaded with presents, I’m sure he’ll be,
He’ll have something nice for you and for me.
"Mamma, do find something fresh and quite new,
For dear old Santa Claus, when he comes through,
I’ll give it myself; I’ll keep wide awake;
I know he’ll be glad my present to take.
"Now all go to bed as quick as you please,
I’ll wait for him,” said the bright little tease,
"He surely will ring, no doubt about that,
I’ll bid him come in and then have a chat.”
Soon came a quick step on the piazza floor,
Just then a loi d ring was heard at the door.
The little miss rose with a dignified air,
Quick ushered him in, and set him a chair.
All covered o’er with little bells tinkling,
Shaking and laughing, twisting and wriggling,
A funny old man, with little eyes blinking,
Looking at Nellie, what was he thinking ?
Not a word did he say —tired of waiting,
Nellie arose, her little heart quaking,
Held out her present, courage most failing,
"Santa Claus, take this”—now she is smiling.
His furry old hand, twisting'and trembling,
Took the sweet gift—“ You dear little darling,”
Uttered quite softly, tenderly kissing,
The bright little face, ne’er a bit shrinking.
Lots of nice presents quickly bestowing,
Thanking her kindly—he must be going,
Shaking and laughing, his little bells jingling,
Down the steps, hastening off in a twinkling.
Brave little lady! all are now saying,
Santa Claus truly ! bright eyes are asking ;
See her dear papa, secretly laughing
At her true faith in Santa Claus’ coming.
Yes! she believes it, ever so truly,
Dear precious darling I rob her not surely,
Of childhood’s sweet faith, now in ks glory,
While she’s relating her own simple story.
MRS. C. E. WILBUR.
Christmas Stockings.
'Tis Christmas day,
And little May
Peeps from her bed in the morning grey.
She looks around,
But not a sound
Breaks on the quietness profound.
So, heaving sighs,
She shuts her eyes,
And hard to go to sleep she tries.
But sleep has fled
That little bed,
And weary moves the curly head.
Until the light
(Oh. welcome sight!)
Has banished every trace of night.
Then out of bed,
With hurried tread,
She runs to waken brother Fred;
For oh, what joys.
In shape of toys,
Does Christmas bring to girls and boys !
Fred gives a groan,
Or sleepy moan,
And mutters, "Do let me alone!"
But bonnie May
Will not have nay;
She whispers, "It is Christmas dayl”
Oh, magic sound!
For Fred turns round,
And in a trice is on the ground.
"Our stockings, where?”
"They’re on that chair,”
"Oh, what has Santa Claus put there?”
May laughs with glee,
The sight to see,
Of stockings filled from toe to knee
With parcels queer,
That stick out here,
Before, behind, in front and rear.
"Oh, Fred ! a dolly!
I’ll call her Molly."
"Why, May, a penknife here; how jolly!”
"A necktie blue!
A paint-box too!”
"Oh, Fred, a pair of kid gloves new ! "
"May, here’s a gun!
Won’t we have fun,
Playing at soldiers ! —You’ll be one.”
"Now that is all.
No ; here’s a ball;
Just hold it, or these things will fall.”
"What’s in the toe,
May, do you know ?
Biscuits and figs!—l told you so.”
"I think,” said May,
That Christmas day
Should come at least each second day.”
And so say we ;
But then you see
That Santa Claus would tired be.
And all his toys
And Christmas joys
Would vanish then from girls and boys.
From "The Prize.”
Haii£ up Baby’s Stocking.
Hang up the baby’s stocking:
Be sure you don’t forget:
The dear little dimpled darling
Has never seen Christmas yet.
But I told him all about it.
And he opened his big, blue eyes;
I’m sure he understood it,
He looked so funny and wise.
Ah, what a tiny stocking;
It doesn't take much to hold
Such little toes as baby’s
Safe from the frost and cold.
But then, for the baby’s Christmas
It never will do at all;
For Santa Claus wouldn’t be looking
For anything half so small.
I know- what will do for baby ;
I’ve thought of a first-rate plan ;
I'll borrow a stocking of grandma—
The longest that ever 1 can.
And you shall hang it by mine, mother,
Right here in the corner—so;
And write a letter for baby.
And fasten it on the toe.
"Old Santa Claus, this is a stocking
Hung up for our baby dear ;
You never have seen our darling,
He has not been with us a year,
"But he is a beautiful baby :
And now, before you go.
Please cram this stocking with
presents,
From the top of it down to the toe.
"Put in a baby’s rattle,
Also a coral ring,
A bright new ribbon for his waist;
Some beads hung on a string
"And mind a coloured ball please.
And a tiny pair of shoes;
You’ll see from this little stocking,
The size you have to choose."
Santa Claus.
A health to good old Santa Claus,
And to his reindeer bold,
Whose hoofs are shod with eider-down,
Whose horns are tipped with gold.
He comes from utmost fairyland
Across the wintry snows ;
He makes the fir-tree and the spruce
To blossom like the rose.
Over the quaint old gables.
Over the windy ridge,
By turret wall and chimney tall,
He guides his fairy sledge;
He steals upon the slumbers
Of little rose-lipped girls,
And lays his waxen dollies down
Beside their golden curls.
He scatters blessings on his way,
And sugar-coated plums;
He robs the sluggard of his rest
With trumpets, guns, and drums.
Small feet, before the dawn of day,
Are marching to and fro,
Drums beat to arms through all the house,
And penny trumpets blow.
A health to brave old Santa Claus,
And to his reindeer bold,
Whose hoofs are shod with eider-down,
Whose horns are tipped with gold.

PLAY LAND.
The Rabbit on the Wall.
The children shout with laughter,
The uproar louder grows ;
Even grandma chuckles faintly,
And Johnny chirps and crows
There ne’er was gilded painting,
Hung up in lordly hall,
Gave half the simple pleasure
As this rabbit on the wall.
The cottage work is over,
The evening meal is done ;
Hark ! thro’ the starlight stillness
You hear the river run.
The little children whisper,
Then speak out one and all :
"Come, father, make for Johnny
The rabbit on the wall,
He —smilingly assenting,
They gather round his chair;
"Now, grandma, you hold Johnny;
Don’t let the candle flare."
So speaking, from his fingers
He throws a shadow tall,
That seems, a moment after,
A rabbit on the wall.
Holiday Time.
With these three little girls and two little
boys
There is sure to be plenty of laughter and
noise;
But nobody minds it, because don’t you see
It is not every day they so merry can be.
At school they are quiet with lessons to
say—
But when holidays come they can play
the whole day.
The Fairy Queen.
Let us laugh and let us sing,
Dancing in a merry ring ;
We'll be fairies on the green,
Sporting round the Fairy Queen.
Like the seasons of the year,
Round we circle in a sphere ;
I’ll be Summer, you’ll be Spring,
Dancing in a fairy ring.
Harry will be Winter wild;
Little Annie, Autumn mild ;
Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring,
Dancing in a fairy ring.
Spring and Summer glide away,
Autumn comes with tresses grey ;
Winter, hand in hand with Spring,
Dancing in a fairy ring.
Faster! faster! round we go
While our cheeks like roses glow ;
Free as birds upon the wing,
Dancing in a fairy ring.
Come and Play in the Garden.
Little sister, come away,
And let us in the garden play,
For it is a pleasant day.
On the grassplat let us sit,
Or, if you please, we’ll play a bit,
And run about all over it.
But the fruit we will not pick,
For that would be a naughty trick,
And, very likely, make us sick.
Nor will we pluck the pretty flowers
That grow about the beds and bowers,
Because, you know, they are not ours.
We’ll pluck the daisies, white and red,
Because mamma has often said,
That we may gather them instead
And much I hope we always may
Our very dear mamma obey,
And mind whatever she may say.
Little Romp.
I am tired to death of keeping still,
And being good all day,
1 guess my mamma’s company
Forgot to go away,
I’ve wished and wished they’d think of
it.
And that they would get through ;
But they must talk for ever first,
They almost always do.
I heard Tom calling to me once,
He’s launched his boat, I know;
I wanted to get out and help,
But mamma’s eyes said no.
The ladies talk such stuff to m*
It makes me sick to hear—
" How beautiful your hair curls !” oi.
" How red your cheeks are, dear •’
I’d ten times rather run a race,
Than play my tunes and things ,
I wouldn’t swop my dog balls
For forty diamond rings.
I’ve got no ’finement, aunty says
I ’sped she knows the best..
I don’t need much to climb a tree,
Or hunt a squirrel’s nest.
Girls are like berries,’’ papa says,
" Sweeter for running wild,’’
But Aunt Melissa shakes her head,
And calls me " Horrid child I’’
I’ll always be a romp she knows—
But shure's my name is Sadie,
I’ll fool ’em all some dreadful day
By growing up a lady.
Hide and Seek.
"We will have a game of hide and seek,
Now mind you do not look."
And Willie went and hid himself
In a dark and lonely nook.
Then the children went to find him ;
They hunted all about.
It was a funny way in which
At last they found him out.
Just as they got where he was hid,
In his nose he felt a tickling
That made him sneeze, and so you see,
They found him in a twinkling.


Tired of Play.
Tired of play ! tired of play !
What hast thou done this livelong day ?
The birds are silent, and so is the bee ;
The sun is creeping up temple and tree;
The doves have flown to the sheltering eaves
And the nests are dark with the drooping
leaves
Twilight gathers and day is done,
How hast thou spent it, restless one ?
Playing ? But what hast thou done beside,
To tell thy mother at eventide ?
What promise of morn is left unbroken ?
What kind word to thy playmate spoken ?
Whom hast thou pitied and whom forgiven,
How with thy faults has duty striven,
What hast thou learned by field and hill ?
By greenwood path, and singing rill ?
Well for thee if thou couldst tell,
A tale like this of a day spent well,
If thy kind hand has aided distress,
And thou pity hast felt for wretchedness ;
If thou hast forgiven a brother’s offence,
And grieved for thine own with penitence ;
If every creature has won thy love
From the creeping worm to the brooding
dove,
Then with joy and peace on the bed of rest,
Thou wilt sleep as on thy mother's breast
Sea-side Play.
Two little boys, all neat and clean,
Came down upon the shore :
They did not know old Ocean's ways
They'd ne'er seen him before
So quietly they sat them down,
To build a fort of sand ;
Their backs were turned upon the sea,
Their faces toward the land
They had just built a famous fort
The handkerchief flag was spread—
When up there came a stealthy wave,
And turned them heels over head
After School Hours.
School is closed and tasks are done,
Flowers are laughing in the sun ;
Like the songsters in the air.
Happy children, banish care I
Riding on a Gate.
Sing, sing,
What shall we sing,
A gate is a capital
Sort of a thing.
If you have not a horse,
Or haven't a swing,
A gate is a capital
Sort of a thing
Cry, cry,
Finger in eye,
Go home to mother
And tell her why ;
You’ve been riding,
And why not I ?
Each in turn, is n't that the
rule
For work or play, at home or
school.
Walking Song.
Come, my children, come away.
For the sun shines bright to-day;
Little children, come with me,
Birds, and brooks, and posies see ;
Get your hats and come away,
For it is a pleasant day.
See the lambkins sport and play,
On the meadows fresh and gay ;
See the kitten full of fun,
Frisking in the shining sun ;
Children, too, may run and play,
For it is a pleasant day.
Bring the hoop and bring the ball,
Come with happy faces all,
Let us make a merry ring,
Talk, and laugh, and dance, and
sing ;
Quickly, quickly come away,
For it is a pleasant day.
The Lost Playmate.
The old school-house is still to day,
The rooms have no gay throng ;
No ringing laugh is on the air,
There is no snatch of song.
The white-haired master sits upon
The seat beneath the tree,
And thinks upon the vanished face,
With all its boyish glee.
But a few short days ago, the lad
Was gayest of the gay,
Quick at the page of knowledge, and
The heartiest in play.
The pride of the home beside the
stream,
With his pigeons in their cots,
And finding life a very dream.
In pleasant homely spots.
His school companions loving him,
And old folks speaking praise,
Of the well-loved boy. with frankest
eyes,
And cheery, happy ways.
All in the village knew the boy,
From parson down to clerk,
And his whistle in the village street
Was clear as song of lark.
But like a dream he's passed away,
And from the chamber dim,
In the fair light of summer day,
The peasants carry him.
And playmates gather at the grave,
The old schoolmaster there,
While blossomed boughs wave over-
head,
And all around is fair.
True is the grief that brings the tear,
There is no empty show ;
The simple neighbours see their loss,
And there is heart-felt woe.
They talk of the bright and lively lad,
Cut down in boyish prime,
And old folks think how strange is life,
More strange with passing time !
Oh ! simple sight on green hill-side,
Away from pomp and power ;
Here are the truths so oft denied
To the imperial hour.
Dear child, how precious are the tears,
Suffusing friendly eyes !
Sublimity is in their gleam,
A light from God’s own skies
Nanghty Mice Teasing the poor kittes

Chinese Toy Merchant.
In the Toy Shop.
Cups and saucers, pots and pans,
China figures, Chinese fans,
Railway trains, with tops and tables,
Fairy tales, and /Esop’s fables.
Clockwork mice, and colored marbles,
Painted bird that sweetly warbles,
Dolls of every age and size,
With flaxen curls and moving eyes
Cows and horses, chickens, cats,
Rattles, windmills, boats and bats,
Ducks and geese, and golden fishes,
Skipping ropes, and copper dishes.
Books with colored pictures, too,
And a thousand other things for you ;
Dainty maidens, merry boys,
Here you are, all sorts of toys
Neat Little Clara.
"Little Clara, come away.
Little Clara, come and play ;
Leave your work. Maria's here,
So come and play with me, my dear.'
"I will come, and very soon,
For I always play at noon ;
But must put my work away,
Ere with you I come and play.
First my bodkin I must place
With my needle in their case ;
I like to put them by with care.
And then I always find them there
There's my cotton, there's my thread
Thimble in its little bed ;
All is safe—my box I lock,
Now I come—'tis twelve o'clock "
Playing Store.
“ Ting-a-ling I" Now they
Have opened the store,
Never was such
An assortment before ;
Mud pies in plenty,
And parcels of sand,
Pebbles for sugar plums,
Always on hand
Plenty of customers
Coming to buy,
“ Brown sugar, white sugar
Which will you try?
Paper for money ;
Their wealth, too, is vast;
In spite of the plenty,
They scatter it fast.
Quick little hands
Tie bundles with care.
Summer's glad music
Is filling the air ;
Birdies fly over,
And wonder, no doubt,
What all these gay
Little folks are about
Fishing.
He took a stick, he took a cord,
He took a crooked pin,
And went a-fishing in the sand
And almost tumbled in.
But just before he tumbled in,
By chance it came about,
He hooked a whiting and a sole,
And made them tumble out.
Hide and Seek.
When the clean white cloth is laid,
And the cups are on the table,
When the tea and toast are made,
That's a happy time for Mabel
Stealing to her mother’s side,
In her ear she whispers low,
“ When papa comes I’ll hide;
Don’t tell him where I go,”
On her knees upon the floor,
In below the sofa creeping ;
When she hears him at the door,
She pretends that she is sleeping
Our Shop.
" Where is Mabel ?" father cries,
Looking round and round about.
Then he murmurs in surprise,
“ Surely Mabel can’t be out. 1 '
First he looks behind his chair,
Then he peers beneath the table.
Seeking, searching everywhere
All in vain for little Mabel;
But at last he thinks he knows,
And he laughs and shakes his head.
Says to mother, “ I suppose
Mabel has been put to bed."
But when he sits down U> tea,
From beneath the sota creeping,
Mabel climbs upon his knee,
Clasps her hands : “ I was not
sleeping.
When he asks. " Where is ray girl’s
Very secret hiding-place?"
Mabel only shakes her curls,
Laughing, smiling, in his face.

Little Sailors.
Now, Harry, pull the chairs up,
And, Fanny, get the shawl;
We'll play that we are sailors,
And that we’re in a squall
The fire will be a lighthouse,
To warn us off the shore ;
And we will place the footstools
For rocks, out on the floor.
Now this chair is the stern,
And that one is the bow ;
But there, you must be careful,
And not lean hard, you know.
Now, sailors, pull that sail up,
And tuck the corners in ;
Well if you want it tighter,
Ask mother for a pin.
Now couldn’t we sing something
About the "Ocean Blue” ?
Well, never mind, "By-baby”
Or anything will do
Take care, you careless sailors,
And mind what you're about,
You know the sea will drown you,
If you should tumble out.
Brother Playing.
Up and down the play-room,
Then behind the door,
Now upon the sofa,
Now upon the floor.
In below the table,
Round the big arm-chair,
Goes my little brother,
‘ Crying ' Are you there ?'
And when brother sees me.
Then away I run ;
And he follows after,
Merry with the fun
So at hide and seek we play,
And pa- ‘he happy hours away
Girls and Boys, Come
Out to Play.
Girls and boys,
Come out to play,
The sun is shining
Away, away
Into the meadow
Over the way,
Tumbling and tossing
The new-mown hay
Into the hedgerow
Picking the May ;
Over the hills
And far away
Down by the brook
Where the ripples play,
Whirling and winding
Their silvery way,
Then home again
By a different way,
Picking an armfu
Of wildflowers gay.
For mother dear
To gladden her way.
And wake in her heart
A cheerful lay.
For every leaf
Has its sunny ray ;
All nature is happy
And seems to say :
Girls and boys,
Come out to play,
•mn is shining
A*ay. away
She has a little doll,
And another one quite large.
She plays she has a little home.
And house cares to discharge
But when her mamma calls her,
Some real work to do,
She does not like to leave her play,
And pouts till she gets through
Hay Making.
In the hay, in the hay,
Toss we and tumble ;
No one to say us nay,
All through this Summer’s day.
No one to grumble.
In the hay, in the hay,
Arthur we’ll smother ;
Bring armfuls, heap them high,
Pile them up—now good-bye,
Poor little brother!
In the hay, in the hay,
Snugly reclining,
Shaded from noontide heat,
Smelling the clover sweet,
See us all dining,
While the haymakers sit
Under the willows,
Each with his bread and cheest
Spread out upon his knees,
Hay for their pillows
Hark! how they laugh and chat,
Happy, light hearted !
Now to their work they go,
Raking up one long row ,
Fit to be carted
Now comes the waggon near
Quickly they’re loading;
Rake away ! rake away !
While it’s fine make the hay
Rain is foreboding
Now that the sunset ray
Says the day’s over,
Homeward we make our way,
In the cart strewn with hay,
Smelling of clover.

Two Merry Men.
Two merry men,
One summer day,
Forsook their toys,
And forgot their play
Two little faces,
Full of fun,
Two little hearts
That beat as one
Foin little hands,

Four little legs
That can't keep still
For labour is sweet,
And toil is fun,
When mother wants
Any work to be done
Mud Pies.
Tell me little ladies,
Playing in the sun,
How many minutes
Till the baking’s done ?
Susy gets the flour,
All of golden dust;
Harry builds the oven,
Lily rolls the crust.
Pat it here, and pat it there ;
What a dainty size !
Bake it on a shelf of stone,
Nice mud pies !
Now we want a shower—
For we need it so—
It would make a roadside.
Such a heap of dough
Turn them in, and turn them out
How the morning flies !
Ring the bell for dinner —
Hot mud pies!

Scarcely had Johnny

Up from his toe :
“ We’re cold” said the toe,
“I and the rest ;
There’s ten of us freezing,
Standing abreast.”
Then up spoke an ear ;
“My, but it’s labor—
Playing in winter. Eh !
Opposite neighbour!"
'Pooh! ” said his nose,
Angry and red;
“Who wants to tiugle?
Go home to bed I ”

Four to a thumb,
All cried together—
“ Johnny, we’re numb! "
But Johnny the stout
Wouldn’t listen a minute:
Never a snow-bank
But Johnny was in it.

Shouting with glee,
Wading the snow-drifts
Up to his knee
Soon he forgot them
Fingers and toes,
Never once thought of

Ah ! What a frolic 1
All in a glow,
Johnny grew warmer
Out in the snow
Often his breathing
Came with a joke ;
* Blaze away, Johnny !

“And I’ll do the fire,"

Playtime.
Play-time, play-time, hurrah 1
Out in the fields together 1
Don't let us lose a moment’s time,
This fine, bright glorious weather
Run, boys! run, boys! faster!
Ball and the bats for cricket;
Jack, you're the fastest runner here,
Be off, and pitch the wicket.
Football for those who choose —
The goal stick—go, Jim, fix it;
Give us the ball; who’s won the toss?
Now for the first who kicks it
No lazy ones to-day;
Off. stretch your legs in running 1
Now for the hip, hip, hip, hurrah!
And let the noise be stunning
Hear how it echoes round !
Another and another!
No fear of noise, it won’t disturb
Old granny and poor mother
Hullo, there ! no foul play !
Dick, what is that you’re saying ?
No bad words and no cruel sport;
We’re come for fun and playing
Romping.
Why now, my dear boys, this is always the way.
You can’t be contented with innocent play ;
But this sort of romping, so noisy and high.
Is never left off till it ends in a cry,
What! are there no games you can take a delight
in,
But kicking, and knocking, and tearing, and
fighting?
It is a sad thing to be forced to conclude
That boys can’t be merry, without being rude
Now what is the reason you never can play
Without snatchingeach other’s playthings away?
Would it be any hardship to let them alone,
When every one of you has toys of his own?
I often have told you before, my dear boys,
That I do not object to your making a noise;
Or running and jumping about, anyhow,
But fighting and mischief I cannot allow
So, if any more of these quarrels are heard,
I tell you this once, and I'll keep to my word,
I’ll take every marble, and spintop, and ball.
And not let you play with each other at all

And the dews of night arise ;
Come, come, leave off play, and let us away,
Till the morning appears in the skies."
"No, no, let us play, for it is yet day,
And we cannot go to sleep;
Besides in the sky the little birds fly,
And the hills are covered with sheep."
Well, well, go and play till the light fades
away,
And then go home to bed."
The little ones leaped, and shouted, and
laughed,
And all the hills echoed

Swinging.
Here we go on the garden swing,
Under the chestnut tree.
Up in the branches birdies sing
Songs to Baby and me.
Baby and Kitty and me.
Then up, high up, for the ropes are long,
And down, low down, for the branch is strong
And there’s room on the seat for three,
Just Baby, and Kitty and me
Merrily swinging,
Merrily singing,
Under the chestnut tree
Up to the clustering leaves we go,
Down we sweep to the grass,
Touching the daisies there below,
Bowing to let us pass,
Smiling to us as we pass.
Then up, high up, for the ropes are long,
And down, low down, for the branch is strong
And there’s room on the seat for three,
Just Baby, and Kitty and me ;
Merrily swinging,
Merrily singing,
Under the chestnut tree.
Skating.
One day it chanced Miss Maud did meet
The poet’s little son,
** I’m going skating, Sir,” she said ;
"And so am I,” said John.
* If you can skate and I can skate,
Why let me skate with you,
We’ll go the whole world round and round,
And skate the whole year through.”
They skated left, they skated right,
Miss Maud and little John,
That is—as long as there was ice
For them to skate upon.
And then they did unstrap their skates
Like other girls and men,
And never used them once—until
They put them on again 1

Smiling face and heart so gay ;
In this bright and smiling weather,
Merrily they all together,

And if only Tom and Polly
Will come too, it will be jolly i
Here they are now, foot it lightly,
Hand in hand they skip so sprightly,
Bees are humming,
Summer’s coming,
Birds are singing, as they’re bringing
Twigs from many a distant tree ;
Lined with down, and moss, and feather,
Where they’ll sit and chirp together.
>_/h 1 how snug those homes will be 1
O’er the ropes so lightly skipping,
O’er the grass so lightly tripping,
The children are as glad as they.
Lessons done with cheerful spirit,

And remember, too, that they
W ho work hardest day by day,

The Baby’s Debut
My brother Jack was nine in May,
And I was eight on New Year’s day ;
So in Kate Wilson's shop
Papa (he’s my papa and Jack's)
Bought me, last week, a doll of wax,
And brother Jack a top
lack’s in the pouts, and this it is,
le thinks mine came to more than his ;
So to my drawer he goes,
Takes out the doll. and. O. my stars 1
He pokes her head between the bars.
And melts off half her nose 1
Quite cross, a bit of string I beg,
And tie it to his peg-top’s peg,
And bang with might and main,
Its head against the parlor door
Of! Hies the head, and hits the floor,
And breaks a window-pane
This made him cry with rage and spite;
Well, let him cry, it serves him right
A pretty thing, forsooth !
If he’s to melt, all scalding hot,
Half my doll's nose, and I am not
To draw his peg-top’s tooth 1
Aum Hannah heard the window break,
And cried "O naughty Nancy Lake,
Thus to distress your aunt:
No Drury-lane for you to-day I ”
And while papa said “Pooh, she may!"
Mamma said “No she sha'n’t 1”
Well, after many a sad reproach,
They got into a hackney coach,
And trotted down the street.
I saw them go : one horse was blind,
The tails of both hung down behind,
Their shoes were on their feet.
The chaise in which poor brother Bill
Used to be drawn to Pentonville,
Stood in the lumber-room :
I wiped the dust from off the top,
While Molly mopp’d it with a mop,
And brush’d it with a broom.
My uncle's porter, Samuel Hughes,
Came in at six to black the shoes,
(I always talk to Sam ;)
So what does he, but takes, and drags
Me in the chaise among the flags,
And leaves me where I am.
My father’s walls are made of brick.
But not so tall and not so thick
As these ; and, goodness me 1
My father’s beams are made of wood.
But never, never half so good
As those that now I see.
What a large floor I ’tis like a town I
The carpet, when they lay it down,
Won't hide it, I’ll be bound ;
And there's a row of lamps I —my eye 1
How they do blaze I I wonder why
They keep them on the ground
Let the Child Play.
He who checks a child with terror
Stops its play and stills its song,
Not alone commits an error
But a greai and grievous wrong
Give ii play, and never fear it;
Active life is no defect,
Never, never break its spirit;
Curb it only to direct
Would you stop the flowing river,
Thinking it would cease to flow f
Onward it must flow for ever ;
Better n it go

"And so you do not like to spell,
Mary, my dear, oh, very well :
Ti’s dull and troublesome,' you say,
And you had rather be at play.
"Then bring me all your books again;
Nay, Mary, why do you complain?
For as you do not choose to read,
You shall not have your books, indeed.
"So, as you wish to be a dunce.
Pray go and fetch me them at once ;
For if you will not learn to spell,
'Tis vain to think of reading well.
"Do you not think you’ll blush to own
When you become a woman grown,
Without one good excuse to plead,
That you have never learnt to read ?’’
"Oh, dear mamma," said Mary then,
"Do let me have my books again ;
I’ll not fret any more indeed,
If you will let me learn to read."

Mrs. Grammar once gave a fine ball
To the nine different parts of our speech ;
To the short and the tall,
To the stout and the small,
There were pies, plums, and puddings for each.
And first little Articles came,
In a hurry to make themselves known—
Fat A, An, and The ;
But none of the three
Could stand for a minute alone.
The Adjectives came to announce
That their dear friends the Nouns were at hand,
Rough, rougher, and roughest,
Tough, tougher, and toughest,
Pat. merry, good -featured, and grand

Grammar In Klijme.
Three little words we often see,
An Article, a, an, and the
Noun's the name of anything,
As school or garden, hoop or string
Adjective tells the kind of noun,
As great, small, pretty, white, or brown
Instead of nouns the Pronouns stand
John’s head, his face, my arm, you*
hand
Verbs tell of something being done,
To read, write, count, sing, jump, or run
How things are done, the Adverbs tell.
As slowly, quickly, ill, or well.
A Preposition stands before
A noun, as in or through a door.
Conjunctions join the nouns together
As men and children, wind and weather
The Interjection shows surprise,
As Oh, how pretty I Ah, how wise !
The whole are called nine parts of
speech,
Which reading, writing, speaking
teach

Or ploughs that others may U- fed,—

HANNAH MORE.
The Nouns were indeed on their way,
Tens of thousands, and more, I should think ;
For each name we could utter,
Shop, shoulder, or shutter,
Is a noun : lady, lion, or link.
The Pronouns were hastening fast
To push the Nouns out of their places;
I, thou, he, and she,
You, it, they, and we,
With their sprightly intelligent faces
Some cried out, “Make way for the Verbs I
A great crowd is coming in view I”
To light and to smite,
To fight and to bite,
To be, and to have, and to do.
The Adverbs attend on the Verbs,
Behind as their footmen they run ;
As thus, “to fight badly,"
And “run away gladly, ”
Shows how fighting and running were done,
Prepositions came in, by, and near;
With Conjunctions, a wee little band,
As either you or he,
But neither I nor she ;
They held their great friends by the hand.
Then, too, with a hip, hip, hurrah !
Rushed in Interjections uproarious;
Dear me I well-a-day !
When they saw the display,
"Ha! Ha!" they all shouted out, “gloriousl”
But, alas! what misfortunes were nigh !
While the fun and the feasting pleased each,
Pounced on them at once
A monster—a Dunce !
And confounded the nine parts of speech 1
Help ! friends ! to the rescue 1 on you
For aid Verb and Article call;
Oh I give your protection

Little Flo’s Letter.
A sweet little baby brother
Had come to live with Flo,
And she wanted it brought to the
table,
That it might eat and grow
"It must wait a while,” said grandma.
In answer to her plea,
"For a little thing that hasn’t teeth
Can't eat like you and me.”
"Why hasn’t it got teeth, grandma ?’’
Asked Flo in great surprise,
"O my. but isn’t it funny?—
No teeth, but nose an’ eyes
"1 guess," after thinking gravely,
They must have been fordot.
Can’t we buy him some likegrandpa’s?
I’d like to know why not ’’
That afternoon, to the corner,
With paper, and pen. and ink,
Went Flo. saying. "Don’t talk to me ;
If you do. it’ll ’sturb my think
I’m writing a letter, grandma,
To send away to-night,
An' 'cause it’s very ’portant,
I want to get it right ”
At last the letter was finished,
A wonderful thing to see,
And directed to " God, in Heaven ’’
" Please read it over to me,"
Said little Flo to her grandma,
“To see if it’s right, you know "
And here is the letter written
To God by little Flo :
"Dear Goo; The baby you brought us
Is awful nice and sweet,
But ’cause you fordot his tooffies
The poor little thing can’t eat.
Thai’s why I'm writing this letter,
A purpose to let you know
Please come and unish the baby
That s all —From Little Flo ”

Dear Grandmamma — l write to say
(And you’ll be glad, I know.)
That I am coming, Saturday,
To spend a week or so.
I'm coming, too, without mamma,
You know I’m eight years old!
And you shall see how good I'll be,
To do as I am told.
I’ll help you lots about your work
There's so much I can do—
I’ll weed the garden, hunt for ?ggs,
And feed the chickens, too.
And maybe I will be so good
You’ll keep me there till fall;
Or, better still, perhaps you’ll say
I can’t go home at all I
Now grandmamma, please don’t forget
To meet me at the train,
For I’ll be sure to come—unless
It should cloud up and rain!
SECOND.
Dear Mamma—Please put on your
things,
And take the next express ;
I want to go back home again
I’m very sick. I guess I

But grandma isn’t you ;
And I forgot, when I came here,
I’d got to sleep here, too I
Last night I cried myself to sleep.
I wanted you so bad !
To day. I cannot play or eat,
I feel so very sad
Please, mamma, come, for I don't see
How I can bear to wait I
You’ll find me, with my hat and sack
Out by the garden gate
And grandma will not care a bu
H you should come, I know
Because 1 ta yoot o«n little girt,

And singing very loudly ;
While our old peacock struts about,
And shows his feathers proudly.

The First Letter.
"Did you ever get a letter ?
I did the other day.
It was in a real envelope,
And it came a long, long wav
A stamp was in the corner
And some printing when it came,
And the one that wrote the letter
Had put ‘ Miss ’ before my name
Then there came a lot more written,
I forget now what it read,
But it told the office people
Where I lived, my mamma sa'd.
Don’t you s'pose those letter-persons,
If they hadn’t just been told,
Would have thought ’twas for a lady
Who was awful, awful old ?
For it looked real big and heavy,
The outside was stuck with flue.

I’m Going to Write to
Papa.
I’m going to write to papa,
I guess he’d like to hear
What his little girl is doing,
The same as when he is near;
I’ll tell him how I miss him,
And how I wish he'd come,
And never, never, leave us,
But always stay at home.
I’ll tell him 'bout my dolly,
She’s sleeping on the floor,
I fear that noise will wake her,
Oh! please don't slam the door
For I must not be bothered,
That’s just what ma would say,
When she begins a letter,
And sends me off to play.
I'll send him lots of kisses,
And one bright shining curl,
I'll ask him to remember
His lonely little girl ;
I want so much to see him,
But I won’t cry a wink,
Cause when I write my letter,
The tears would blot my ink.
I’m going to write to papa,
And oh! how glad he’ll be,
To get a little letter,
That was written all by me.
Old Letters.
I gaze upon ye, once again,
Old records of the past,
And o'er the dim and faded lines
My tears are falling fast;
I deem’d not there was power yet,
In these few simple words,
To stir within my quiet heart
Such old familiar chords.
Ye bring me back mine early dreams —
Oh, but to dream them now,
With childhood’s fresh, unwearied
heart,
And pure unsadden’d brow !
The loved—the lost—the changed—
The dead—all these we conjure up,
And mingled is the draught
That lies in memory’s magic cup.
Old letters—sad mementoes ye,
Of friendship’s shatter’d chain,
Oh! that the hand these pages traced,
My own might clasp again.
They tell me yet of early love,
Of feelings glad and gay,
Of childhood’s April hopes and fears—
The writers, where are they ?
Time’s changes are for deeper things
Than folly’s vain pursuit,
Spring blossoms fade, to leave a place
For autumn’s ripen'd fruit.
Look back upon the buried past,
But not with vain regret.
Be grateful for the many joys
That bloom around thee yet.
Bend heavenward thine onward
course,
That years of coming age
May leave an impress in life’s book,
Pure as its opening page!
Papa’s Letter.
I was sitting in my study,
Writing letters, when I heard :
"Please, dear mamma, Mary told me
That you mustn’t be disturbed.
But I'se tired of the kitty,
Want some ozzer fing to do.
Writing letters is ’ou mamma?
Tan’t I write a letter, too ? "
Not now, darling, mamma’s busy;
Run and play with kitty, now,"
"No—no, mamma ; me wite letter,
Ten you will show me how.”
I would paint my darling’s portrait,
As his sweet eyes searched my face—
Hair of gold and eyes of azure,
Form of childish witching grace.
But the eager face was clouded,
As I slowly shook my head,
Till I said : "I’ll make a letter,
Of you, darling boy, instead.”
So I parted back the tresses
From his forehead high and white.
And a stamp in sport I pasted,
’Mid its waves of golden light.
Then I said : " Now, little letter,
Go away and bear good news,”
And I smiled as down the staircase
Clattered loud the little shoes.
Leaving me, the darling hurried
Down to Mary in his glee ;
"Mamma’s witing lots of letters;
I’se a letter, Mary, see."
No one heard the little prattler,
As once more he climbed the stair.
Reached his little cap and tippet,
Standing on the table there.
No one heard the front door open,
No one saw the golden hair,
As it floated o’er his shoulders
On the crisp October air.
Down the street the baby hastened.
Till he reached the office door :
" I’se a letter, Mr. Postman,
Is there room for any more ?
’Cause this letter’s going to papa ;
Papa lives with God, ’ou know :
Mamma sent me for a letter ;
Does ’ou fink at I tan do ? ”
But the clerk in wonder answered,
"Not to-day, my little man ; ”
" Den I’ll find anozzer office,
’Cause I must go if I tan."
Fain the clerk would have detained
him,
But the pleading face was gone,
And the little feet were hast’ning,
By the busy crowd swept on.
Suddenly the crowd was parted,
People fled to left and right,
As a pair of maddened horses
At that moment dashed in sight.
No one saw the baby figure,
No one saw the golden hair,
Till a voice of frightened sweetness
Rang out on the autumn air.
’Twas too late; a moment only
Stood the beauteous vision there ;
Then the little face lay lifeless
Covered o’er with golden hair.
Rev'rently they raised my darling,
Brushed away the curls of gold,
Saw the stamp upon the forehead
Growing now so icy cold.
Not a mark the face disfigured,
Showing where a hoof had trod ;
But the little life was ended—
" Papa’s letter” was with God
Bessie’s Letter.
I have got a letter,
A letter all my own,
It has my name upon it, —
Miss Bessie L. Stone.
My papa sent it to me,
He’s away from home—you seel
I guess the postman wondered
Who Bessie Stone could be.
I’d like to send an answer,
But I don’t know how to spell;
I'll get mamma to do it,
And that will do as well.
A Little Boy’s Yalentin e.
Little girl across the way,
You are so very sweet,
I shouldn’t be a bit surprised
If you were good to eat.
Now what I’d like if you would too,
Would be to go and play—
Well, all the time, and all my life,
On your side of the way.
I don’t know anybody yet
On your side of the street,
But often I look over there
And watch you—you’re so sweet.
When I am big, I tell you what,
I don’t care what they say,
I’ll go across—and stay there too,
On your side of the way.
Letter Writing.
Heaven first taught letters
For some wretch’s aid,
Some banish’d lover,
Or some captive maid.
They live, they speak,
They breathe what love inspires,
Warm from the soul,
And faithful to its fires;
The virgin’s wish
Without her fears impart,
Excuse the blush,
And pour out all the heart—
Speed the soft intercourse
From soul to soul,
And waft a sigh
From Indus to the pole.
Boil it Down.
Whatever you have to say, my friend,
Whether witty, grave, or gay,
Condense as much as ever you can,
And that in the readiest way;
And whether you write of rural affairs,
Or particular things in town,
Just take a word of friendly advice—
" Boil it down."
Letters From Home.
Letters from home ! How musical to the ear
Of the sailor-boy on the far-off main,
When, from the friendly vessel drawing near,
Across the billow floats the gentle strain.
The words the tear-drops of his memory move :
They tell a mother’s or a sister’s love ;
And playmates, friends, and sweetheart to him
come
Out to him on the sea, in letters from his home
How warmly there the tender home-light shines!
What household music lives in those dear lines

Polly’s Letter to
Brother Ben.
Dear brother Ben,
I take my pen
To tell you where,
And how, and when,
I found the nest
Of our speckled hen.
She would never lay,
In a sensible way,
Like other hens,
In the barn or the hay ;
But here and there
And everywhere,
On tin stable floor,
And the wood-house stair,
And once on the ground
Her eggs I found.
But yesterday
I ran away,
With mother’s leave,
In the barn to play.
The sun shone bright
On the seedy floor,
And the doves so white
Were a pretty sight
As they walked in and out
Of the open door,
With their little red feet
And their feathers neat,
Cooing and cooing
More and more
Well, I went out
' To look about
On the platform wide,
Where side by side
I could see the pig pens
In their pride;
And beyond them both,
On a narrow shelf,
I saw the speckled hen
Hide herself
Behind a pile
Of hoes and rakes
And pieces of boards
And broken stakes.
"Ah I ha 1 old hen,
I have found you now,
But to reach your nest
I don’t know how,
Unless I could creep
Or climb or crawl
Along the edge
Of the pig-pen wall "
And while I stood
In a thoughtful mood,
The speckled hen cackled
As loud as she could,
And flew away,
As much as to say,
"For once my treasure
Is out of your way.”
I did not wait
A moment then ;
I couldn't be conquered
By that old hen !
But along the edge
Of the slippery ledge
I carefully crept,
For the great pigs slept.
And I dared not
Even look to see
If they were thinking
Of eating me.
But all at once,
Oh. what a dunce I
I dropped my basket
Into the pen,
The one you gave me,
Brother Ben ;
There were two eggs in it,
By the way.
That I found in the manger
Under the hay.
Then the pigs got up
And ran about
With a noise between
A grunt and a shout
And when I saw them,
Rooting, rooting,
Of course I slipped
And lost my footing,
And tripped,
And jumped,
And finally fell
Right down among
The pigs pell-mell.
For once in my life
I was afraid ;
For the door that led
Out to the shed
Was fastened tight
With an iron hook.
And father was down
In the fields by the brook,
Hoeing and weeding
His rows of corn,
And here was his Polly
So scared and forlorn,
But I called him, and called
him,
As loud as I could.
I knew he would hear me—
He must and he should.
"O father 1 O father I
(Get out, you old pig).
O father ! oh ! oh ! "
For their mouths are so
big.
Then I waited a minute
And called him again,
“O father ! O father !
I am in the pig pen!”
And father did hear,
And he threw down his
hoe,
And scampered as fast
As a father could go.
The pigs had pushed me
Close to the wall,
And munched my basket,
Eggs and all,
And chewed my sun-bonnet
Into a ball.
And one had rubbed
His muddy nose
All over my apron,
Clean and white;
And they sniffed at me,
And stepped on my toes,
But hadn’t taken
The smallest bite,
When father opened
The door at last,
And ohl in his arms
He held me fast.

Writing.
Little pens of metal,
Little drops of ink,
Make the wicked tremble,
And the people think
Talue of Writing.
Blest be that gracious power
Who taught mankind
To stamp a lasting image
On the mind;
Beasts may convey,
And tuneful birds may
sing
Their mutual feelings
In the opening spring ;
But man alone has skill
And power to send
The heart’s warm dictates
To the distant friend :
Tis his also to please,
Instruct, advise,
Ages remote.
And nations yet to rise
Crabbe
Use the Pen.
Use the pen ! there’s magic in it,
Never let it lag behind ;
Write thy thought, the pen can
win it
From the chaos of the mind.
Many a gem is lost for ever
By the careless passer-by,
But the gems of thought should
never
On the mental pathway lie
Use the pen! reck not that others
Take a higher flight than thine.
Many an ocean cave still smothers
Pearls of price beneath the brine
So thy words and thoughts,
securing
Honest praise from wisdom's
tongue,
May, in time, be as enduring
As the strains which Homer
sung
J. E. Carpenter
Power of the Pen.
Beneath the rule of men entirely great,
The pen is mightier than the sword.

Letters.
Such a little thing—a letter,
Yet so much it may contain ;
Written thoughts and mute expression*
Full of pleasure, fraught with pain.
When our hearts are sad at parting,
Comes a gleam of comfort bright.
In the mutual promise given :
“We will not forget to write."
Plans and doings of the absent;
Scraps of news we like to hear,
All remind us, e’en though distant,
Kind remembrance keeps us near
Yet sometimes a single letter
Turns the sunshine into shade ;
Chills our efforts, clouds our prospects,
Blights our hopes and makes them fade
Messengers of joy or sorrow,
Life or death, success, despair.
Bearers of affection’s wishes,
Greeting kind or loving prayer
Prayer or greeting, were we present,
Would be felt, but half unsaid ;
We can write —because our letters—
Not our faces—will be read ?
Who has not some treasured letters,
Fragments choice of others’ lives ;
Relics, some, of friends departed.
Friends whose memory still survives 7
Touched by neither time nor distance,
Will their words unspoken last ?
Voiceless whispers of the present,
Silent echoes of the past I
The Right Method of Composition.
Never be in haste in writing:
Let that thou utterest be of nature’s flow,
Not art's, a fountain’s, not a pump's. But once
Begun, work thou all things into thy work
And set thyself about it, as the sea
About earth, lashing it day and night :
And leave the stamp of thine own soul in it
As thorough as the fossil flower in clay :
The theme shall start and struggle in thy
breast,
Like to a spirit in its tomb at rising,
Rending the stones, and crying—Resurrec-
tion,

THE two greatest educating powers in the
ancient world were Pictures and Poetry
—the two greatest educating powers are
pictures and poetry still, and pictures
and poetry blended in an interesting manner is
the intended educating feature of this PLEAS-
ANT—LEARNING —LAND, but my object in
this place is to speak of pictures only, as perhaps
the greatest of all educating powers, and to
demonstrate that they are not sufficiently used
for educational purposes Firstly : pictures are
in a universal language—when they are true to
nature every person on earth can understand
them Show a picture of a person or a bird, a
horse or a house, a ship, a tree, or a landscape,
and everyone knows what is meant, and this is
why most of the peoples of the ancient world
conveyed their ideas in picture language.
Fletcher, in his Cyclopedia of Education,
says ;• —‘‘It has long been accepted as an axiom
that the best explanation of a thing is the sight
and study of the thing itself, and the next best
a true picture of the thing.” Dryden, speaking
of poetry and painting, says ;
" The poets are confined to narrow space,
To speak the language of their native place ;
The painter widely stretches his command,
His pencil speaks the tongue of every land "
Many writers, ancient and modern, have
taught the great educational power of pictures
Horace says: —A picture is a poem without
words” Sydney Smith says —‘‘Every good
picture is the best of sermons aud lectures ”
O S Fowler says ; —'' A single picture often
conveys more than volumes.” W M Hunt
says —” From any picture we can learn some-
thing ” Henry Ward Beecher says:—“A
picture that teaches any affection or moral
sentiment will speak in a language which men
understand, without any other education than
that of being born and of living ” Garrick,
speaking of Hogarth, says
“ His pictured morals mend the mind,
And through the eye improve the heart ’
But pictures are not only a means of edu-
cation , for they bring pleasure, comfort, and
education combined Steele says:—‘‘Beauti-
ful pictures are the entertainment of pure
minds ” G P Putman says : —“ How many
an eye and heart have been fascinated by an
enchanting picture ” Cicero says,—“The eyes
are charmed by pictures, and the ears by music ”
lohn Gilbert says: —‘‘Pictures are consolers
cf loneliness , they are a sweet flattery to the
soul, they are a relief to the jaded mind , they
are windows to the imprisoned thought; they
are books, they are histories and sermons,
•which we can read without the trouble of turn-
ing over the leaves ” Ugo Foscolio says :
‘‘Pictures are the chickweed to the gilded cage,
and make up for the want of many other enjoy
ments to those whose life is mostly passed amid
the smoke and din, the bustle and noise of an
overcrowded city " Pandole ini says.—‘'Many
an eye has been surprised into moisture by
pictured woe or heroism; and we are mistaken
if the glow of pleasure has not lighted in some
hearts the flame of high resolve, or warmed
into life the seeds of honorable ambition.”
Many pictures, particularly portraits, by
bringing up reminiscences, are a great source of
consolation. In millions of houses the most-
loved and treasured .possession is the photo-
graphic album containing the likenesses of dear
absent or departed friends. Shee, writing of
the soothing influence of the portrait, says;—
" Mirror divine ! which gives the sou! to view,
Reflects the image, and retains it too !
Recalls to friendship’s eye the fading face.
Revives each look, and rivals every grace ;
In thee the banished lover finds relief,
His bliss in absence, and his balm in grief:
Affection, grateful, owns thy sacred power.
The father feels thee in affliction’s hour ;
When catching life ere some lov'd cherub flies,
To take its angel station in the skies,
The portrait soothes the loss it can't repair,
And sheds a comfort, even in despair.”
Or —
"The widow’d husband sees his sainted wife
In picture warm, and smiling as in life, —
And—
While he gazes with convulsive thrill,
And weeps, and wonders at the semblance still.
lle breathes a blessing on the pencil's aid,
That half restores the substance in the shade:'
But it is more particularly with pictures as a
direct means of education that I have to speak
Mr Stead holds that in the coming education
of the world the magic lantern will play a very
great part, for through its aid you can portray
any object you wish—pictures of scenery, of
buildings, of distant countries, of the micro-
scopic world, of the astronomical world, and in
fact any kind of pictures you choose, in a most
beautiful, life-like, interesting, and educational
manner I think and earnestly hope that Mr.
Stead’s prediction will be fulfilled.
There are two other ways in which I think
that pictures should be used for educational
purposes. Firstly, in books, as in this one, and
secondly, on the walls of buildings— outside and
inside if you like—but I will speak only of the
inside in this paper. Why should not every
room of every house be covered with pictures
where it is not covered with furniture? In
millions of rooms there is a great waste of
opportunity Many times I have thought why
do they not have varying patterns of different
scenery, etc , in the different rooms of the houses
instead of the wall paper, with its uninteresting
pattern perpetually repeated There is no
reason why a house of twelve rooms should not
represent on its walls twelve different countries,
or twelve histories of striking events, etc
Possibly this may take place later on With
respect to hanging pictures everywhere on the
walls, it may be objected that it would be too
expensive—so it would if they were costly
pictures—but really good pictures are produced
by the million now so cheaply, that the objec
tion of expense vanishes. The walls can be
covered now almost as cheaply with intellectual
pictures as with unintellectual wall paper Sir
Joshua Reynolds says ; —“ A room hung with
pictures, is a room hung with thoughts.” John
Gilbert says : —“ A room with pictures in it,
and a room without pictures, differ by nearly as
much as a room with windows and a room
without windows ; for pictures are loopholes of
escape to the soul, leading it to other scenes
and other spheres, as it were, through the frame
of an exquisite picture, where the fancy for a
moment may revel, refreshed and delighted ”
1 was convinced many years ago of the almost
criminal waste of wall space, and issued the
following doggerel lines, partly from trade and
partly from sentimental motives
Every cottage, Count your PICTURES
Two-roomed cottage, All your walls on,
Should contain full See if you have
Twenty PICTURES Quite the number

THOUSAND PICTURES. Then that Phases
You again.
Walls are made to PICTURES please and
Keep out weather Teach for ever,
And also to All the Children;
Display PICTURES Women, Men.
Even in the poorest houses pictures must
always be a blessing. Many a poor man’s cheer
less home would be made much more comfort
able and endurable if a few shilling’s worth of
good pictures were posted or hung round its bare
walls. If houses were universally decorated
with true speaking pictures what an immense
influence for good it would have on mankind
What pleasure it would bring them What
intellectual and refined tastes it would create
and nurture One most important thing in
selecting pictures to cover the walls is to always
choose good subjects A poor picture takes up
as much room as a good one, and generally costs
as much, Always choose live speaking pictures
that will interest and instruct. There is an im-
mense multitude of poor, tame, and uninteresting
pictures produced in the world, and which in
millions of instances keep out the good ones If
these poor ones could be kept back or destroyed,
and the best ones only take their place, the world
would be the better for it. In choosing materials
to build up a bright, happy home, always select
the best—the best books—the best music-the best
pictures. In conclusion, there is one more sug
gestion 1 would make on the picture question,
and 1 think it is the most important of all; it isthal
a good clear map of the world should be hung in
every house in the world, to give every person an
idea of the world they live in For it is a most
deplorable fact that ninety-nine out of every
hundred of the inhabitants, even of the civilized
world, have a very poor conception of the
geography and ethnology of the world And
this should not be, for every person ought to
have a clear idea of their world-fatherland,
and of their fellow creatures, and a knowledge
of the map of the world is the first lesson to be
learned in that most desirable direction

Take a pencil, black or red,
Draw a little loaf of bread
On a piece of paper white—
Make the bread extremely light

Then, before your work you stop,
Draw a little loop on top,
And a satchel will be found
Such as ladies carry round
in.
Then you may, my pretty dears,
Add a pair of little ears;
And, if Art is not in fault,
There’s a bag of extra salt

Contemplate the great design
And a flowing tail, and that
Makes a perfect pussy cat

OLD MEN TALES.
Old Man and His Wife.
i nere was an old man who lived in a wood,
As you may plainly see,
He said he could do as much work in a day
As his wife could do in three.
" With all my heart,” the old woman said,
“ If that you will allow;
To-morrow you’ll stay at home in my stead,
And I’ll go drive the plough.
** But you must milk the Tidy cow,
For fear she may go dry.
And you must feed the little pigs
That are within the sty ;
*• And you must mind the speckled hen,
For fear she lay away;
And you must reel the spool of yarn
That I spun yesterday."
The old woman took a whip in her hand,
And went to drive the plough ;
The old man took a pail in his hand,
And went to milk the cow.
But Tidy hinched and Tidy flinched.
And Tidy broke his nose,
And Tidy gave him such a blow
That the blood ran down to his toes
"Hi I Tidy! Ho! Tidy I Hi!
Tidy ! do stand still!
If ever I milk you, Tidy, again,
’Twill be sore against my will."
He went to feed the little pigs,
That were within the sty ;
He hit his head against the beam
And he made the blood to fly.
He went to mind the speckled hen,
For fear she’d lay away;
And he forgot the spool of yarn
His wife spun yesterday.
So he swore by the sun, the moon, the start,
And the green leaves on the tree,
If his wife didn’t do a day’s work in her life,
She should ne'er be ruled by he.

The Fnnny Old Man.
There was an old man, and though ’tis not common,
Yet if he said true, his mother was a woman ;
And though it’s incredible, yet I've been told
He was a mere infant, but age made him old.
Whene’er he was hungry he wanted some meat,
And if he could get it, ’twas said he could eat ;
When thirsty he’d drink, if you gave him a pot,
And his liquor most commonly ran down his throat
He seldom or never could see without light,
And yet I've been told he could hear in the night
He has oft been awake in the daytime, ’tis said,
And has fall'n fast asleep as he lay in his bed.
'Tis reported his tongue always moved when he talked,
And he stirred both his arms and his legs when he walk'd
And his gait was so odd, had you seen him you'd burst.
For one leg or t’other would always be first.
His face was the saddest that ever was seen,
For if ’twere not washed it was seldom quite clean ;
He showed most his teeth when he happened to grin.
And his mouth stood across 'twixt his nose and his chin.
At last he fell sick, as old chronicles tell,
And then, as folk said, he was not very well!
And what is more strange, in so weak a condition,
As he could not give fees, he could get no physician
What pity he died ; yet tis said that his death
Was occasioned at last by the want of his breath.
But peace to his bones, which in ashes now moulder,
Had he lived a day longer he'd been a day older
Piper and His Cow.
There was an old piper who had a cow,
But he had no hay to give her,
So he took his pipes and played her a tune
“ Consider, old cow, consider,’’
Old John Brown.
Poor old John Brown is dead and gone,
We ne’er shall see him more;
He used to wear an old brown coat.
All button’d down before.
Three Wise Men.
Three wise men of Gotham,
Went to sea in a bowl;
If the bowl it had been stronger,
Then my song would have been longer
Frightened Old Man.
There was a man and he had nought,
And robbers came to rob him ;
He crept up the chimney pot,
And then they thought they had him;
But he got down on t’other side,
And so they could not find him ;
He ran fourteen miles in fifteen days.
And never look’d behind him.
A Man with a Wife.
I had a little wife, the prettiest ever seen,
She washed up the dishes, and kept the house
clean;
She went to the mill to fetch me some flour,
She brought it home in less than an hour;
She baked me my bread, she brewed me my ale,
She sat by the fire and told many a fine tale.
Crooked Old Man.
There was a crooked man.
And he went a crooked mile.
He found a crooked sixpence,
Against a crooked stile
He bought a crooked cat,
Which caught a crooked mouse,
And they all lived together
In a little crooked house.
King Arthur.
When good King Arthur ruled this land,
He was a goodly King ;
He stole three pecks of barley meal,
To make a bag pudding.
A bag pudding the King did make,
And stuffed it well with plums ;
And in it put great lumps of fat,
As big as my two thumbs.
The King and Queen did eat thereof,
And ncblemen beside ;
And what they could not eat that night
The Queen next morning fried.
Barney Bodkin.
Barney Bodkin broke his nose,
Without feet we can’t have toes.
Crazy folks are always mad,
Want of money makes us sad
Funny Man.
A man of words and not of deeds,
Is like a garden full of weeds;
And when the weeds begin to grow,
It's like a garden full of snow ;
And when the snow begins to fall.
It’s like a bird upon the wall;
And when the bird away does fly,
It’s like an eagle in the sky ;
And when the sky begins to roar,
It’s like a lion at the door;
And when the door begins to crack,
It’s like a stick across your back ;
And when your back begins to smart,
It’s like a penknife in your heart;
And when your heart begins to bleed,
You’re dead, and dead, and dead indeed
Strange Man.
There was a man and he was mad,
And he jumped into a pea-pod ;
The pea-pod was over-full,
So he jumped into a roaring bull ;
The roaring bull was over-fat,
So he jumped into a gentleman’s hat;
The gentleman’s hat was over-fine,
So he jumped into a bottle of wine ;
The bottle of wine was over dear,
So he jumped into a bottle of bee* ;
The bottle of beer was over thick,
So he jumped into a club stick ;
The club-stick was over narrow,
So he jumped into a wheel barrow ;
The wheel barrow began to crack,
So he jumped on to a hay stack ,
The hay-stack began to blaze,
So he did nothing but cough and sneeze


JACK SPRAT.
Jack Sprat could eat no fat.
His wife could eat no lean,
And so between them both
They licked the platter clean,
jack ate all the lean,
Joan ate all the fat,
The bone they both picked clean
Then gave it to the cat
When Jack Sprat was young
He dressed very smart,
He courted Joan Cole,
And soon gained her heart ;
In his fine leather doublet
And old greasy hat,
Oh ! what a smart fellow
Was little Jack Sprat.
Joan Cole had a hole
In her petticoat,
Jack Sprat, to get a patch,
Gave her a groat
The groat bought a patch
Which stopped the hole,
I thank you, Jack Sprat,”
Says little Joan Cole.
Jack Sprat was the bridegroom,
Joan Cole was the bride,
Jack said from the church
His Joan home should ride
But no coach could take her,
The road was so narrow;
Said Jack, "Then I’ll take her
Home in a wheelbarrow."
Jack Sprat was wheeling
His wife by the ditch,
The barrow turned over,
And in she did pitch
Says Jack, " She'll be drown’d I"
But Joan did reply,
'* I don’t think I shall,
For the ditch is quite dry.”
Jack brought home his Joan,
And she sat in a chair,
When in came his cat,
That had got but one ear.
Says Joan " I’ve come home. Buss
Pray how do you do ? "
The cat wagg’d her tail
And said nothing but " mew.”
Jack Sprat took his gun,
And went to the brook ;
He shot at the drake,
But he killed the duck,
He brought it to Joan,
Who a fire did make,
To roast the fat duck
While Jack went for the drake
The drake was swimming
With his curly tail,
Jack Sprat came to shoot him,
But happened to fail.
He let off Ins gun,
But missing his mark,
The duck flew away
Crying "Quack, quack, quack.’
Jack Sprat to live pretty
Now bought him a pig,
It was not very little,
It was not very big;
It was not very lean,
It was not very fat,
“ It will serve for a grunter,"
Said little Jack Sprat.
Then Joan went to market
To buy her some fowls,
She bought a jackdaw
And a couple of owls ;
The owls were white,
The jackdaw was black,
“ They'll make a rare h r eed,”
Says little Joan Sprat
Jack Sprat bought a cow,
His Joan to please,
For Joan could make
Both butter and cheese ;
Or pancakes or puddings
Without any fat;
A notable housewife
Was little Joan Sprat. .
Joan Sprat went to brewing
A barrel of ale,
She put in some hops
That it might not turn stale;
But as for the malt
She forgot to put that ;
" This is brave sober liquor,"
Said little Jack Sprat.
Jack Sprat went to market
And bought him a mare,
She was lame of three legs,
And as blind as she could stare
Her ribs they were bare,
For the mare had no fat;
Cross Old Man.
There was a cross old man and
what do you think,
He lived on nothing but victuals
and drink ;
Victuals and drink were his prin-
cipal diet,
Yet this crabbed old man would
never be quiet.
He teased a poor monkey, who
lived in a cage,
Till the animal got in a terrible
rage,
And seized on his nose with
fingers so strong,
That it stretched it until it was
quite a yard long
Old Man in the Moon.
The man in the moon came
tumbling down,
And asked his way to Norwich,
He went by the south, and burnt
his mouth,
With supping cold pease por-
ridge
" She looks like a racer,"
Said little Jack Sprat.
Jack and Joan went abroad.
Puss looked after the house ;
She caught a large rat,
And a very small mouse.
She caught a small mouse,
And a very large rat,
“ You’re an excellent hunter,”
Said little Jack Sprat.
Now I've told you the story
Of little Jack Sprat,
Of sweet Joan Cole
And the poor one-ear’d cat;
Now Jack he loved Joan,
And good things he taught her
Then she gave him a son,
Then after a daughter.
Now Jack has got rich,
And has plenty of pelf;
If you know any more
You may tell it yourself
A Fuimj Mail.
There was a man of Newington,
And he was wondrous wise,
He jump’d into a quickset hedge
And scratch’d out both his eyes
But when he saw his eyes were out
With all his might and main
He jump’d into another hedge,
And scratch’d them in again
Dr. Faustus.
Doctor Faustus was a good man,
He whipt his scholars now and then
When he did he made them dance
Out of Scotland into France ;
Out of France into Spain,
And then he whipped them back
again I
If! If! If!
If all the world was apple pie,
And all the seas were ink,
And all the trees were bread and
cheese,
What would we have to drink ?
It’s enough to make an old man
scratch his head and think

THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF JOHN GILPIN.
John Gilpin was a citizen
Of credit and renown,
A train-bound Captain eke was he
Of famous London town.
John Gilpin’s spouse said to her dear,
Though we have wedded been
These twice ten tedious years, yet we
No holiday have seen.
To-morrow is our wedding day,
And we then will repair
Unto the “Bell" at Edmonton,
All in a chaise and pair,
My sister and my sister’s child,
Myself and children three,
Will fill the chaise, so you must ride
On horse-back after we.
He soon replied—l do admire
Of womankind but one,
And you are she, my dearest dear,
Therefore it shall be done,
I am a linen-draper bold,
As all the world doth know,
And my good friend the Calender,
Will lend his horse to go.
Quoth Mrs Gilpin—That's well said;
And for that wine is dear,
We will be furnished with our own,
Which is both bright and clear;
John Gilpin kiss’d his loving wife,
O’erjoyed was he to find
That, though on pleasure she was bent,
She had a frugal mind.
The morning came, the chaise was brought,
And yet was not allow’d
To drive up to the door, lest all
Should say that she was proud;
So three doors off the post was stayed,
Where they did all get in,
Six precious souls, and all agog
To dash through thick and thin.
Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,
Were never folks so glad,
The stones did rattle underneath
As if Cheapside were mad;
John Gilpin at his horse's side
Seized fast the flowing mane,
And up he got in haste to ride,
But soon came down again
For saddle-tree scarce reached had he,
His journey to begin,
When turning round his head, he saw
Three customers come in ;
So down he came—for loss of time,
Although it grieved him sore,
Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,
Would trouble him much more.
Twas long before the customers
Were suited to their mind,
When Betty, screaming, came down stairs,
"The wine is left behind."
Good lack! quoth he, yet bring it me,
My leathern belt likewise,
In which I bear my trusty sword
When I do exercise.
Now, Mistress Gilpin, careful soul,
Had two stone bottles found,
To hold the liquor that she loved,
And keep it safe and sound,
Each bottle had a curling ear,
Through which the belt he drew,
And hung a bottle on each side,
To make his balance true.
Then over all, that he might be
Equipp’d from top to toe,
His long red cloak, well brush'd and neat,
He manfully did throw,
Now see him mounted once again
Upon his nimble steed,
Full slowly pacing o’er the stones
With caution and good heed.
But, finding soon a smoother road
Beneath his well-shod feet,
The snorting beast began to trot,
Which gall’d him in his seat.
So, " Fair and softly,” John, he cried,
But John, he cried in vain ;
That trot became a gallop soon,
In spite of curb and rein.
Sd, stooping down, as needs he must,
Who cannot sit upright,
He grasp’d the mane with both his hands,
And eke with all his might,
His horse, who never in that sort,
Had handled been before,
What thing upon his back had got
Did wonder more and more
Away went Gilpin, neck or nought,
Away went hat and wig,
He little dreamt when he set out
Of running such a rig ;
The wind did blow, the cloak did fly,
Like streamer long and gay,
Till, loop and button failing both,
At last it flew away.
Then might all people well discern
The bottles he had slung,
A bottle swinging at each side,
As had been said or sung,
The dogs did bark, the children scream’d,
Up flew the windows all,
And ev’ry soul cried out, Well done!
As loud as he could bawl.
Away went Gilpin—who but he,
His fame soon spread around—
He carries weight, he rides a race!
'Tis for a thousand pound!
And still as fast as he drew near,
'Twas wonderful to view
How in a trice the turnpike men
Their gates wide open threw.
And now as he went bowing down
His reeking head full low,
The bottles twain behind his back
Were shatter’d at a blow;
Down ran the wine into the road,
Most piteous to be seen,
Which made his horse’s flanks to smoke,
As they had basted been.
But still he seemed to carry weight,
With leathern girdle braced,
For all might see the bottle-necks
Still dangling at his waist;
Thus all through merry Islington
These gambols did he play,
And till he came into the Wash
Of Edmonton so gay.
And there he threw the wash about
On both sides of the way,
Just like unto a trundling mop,
Or a wild goose at play.
At Edmonton his loving wife
From the balcony spied
Her tender husband, wond’ring much
To see how he did ride.
Stop, stop, John Gilpin!—Here’s the house—
They all at once did cry,
The dinner waits, and we are tired—
Said Gilpin—So am I;
But yet his horse was not a whit
Inclined to tarry there—
For why? His owner had a house
Full ten miles off, at Ware
So, like an arrow, swift he flew,
Shot by an archer strong;
So did he fly—which brings me to
The middle of my song.
Away went Gilpin, out of breath,
And sore against his will,
Till at his friend the Calender’s
His horse at last stood still.
The Calender, amazed to see
His neighbour in such trim,
Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,
And thus accosted him:—
What news? what news? your tidings tell I
Tell me you must and shall—
Say why bare-headed you are come,
Or why you come at all?
Now, Gilpin had a pleasant wit,
And loved a timely joke,
And thus unto the Calender,
In merry guise he spoke—
I came because your horse would come,
And if I well forbode,
My hat and wig will soon be here,
They are upon the road.
The Calender, right glad to find
His friend in merry pin.
Return’d him not a single word
But to the house went in.
When straight he came with hat and wig
A wig that flow’d behind ;
A hat not much the worse of wear—
Each comely in its kind
He held them up, and in its turn
Thus showed his ready wit—
My head is twice as big as yours,
They therefore needs must fit.
But let me scrape the dirt away
That hangs upon your face;
And stop and eat, for well you may
Be in a hungry case.
Said John —It is my wedding-day,
And all the world would stare.
If wife should dine at Edmonton,
And I should dine at Ware.
So, turning to his horse, he said—
I am in haste to dine,
'Twas for your pleasure you came here.
You shall go back for mine.
Ah, luckless speech and bootless boast.
For which he paid full dear;
For while he spake, a braying ass
Did sing most loud and clear,
Whereat his horse did snort as he
Had heard a lion roar,
And gallop’d off with all his might.
As he had done before
Away went Gilpin, and away
Went Gilpin’s hat and wig;
He lost them sooner than the first,
For why? they were too big.
Now, Mistress Gilpin when she saw
Her husband posting down
Into the country, far away.
She pulled out half-a-crown.
And thus unto the youth she said
That drove them to the " Bell’’—
This shall be yours when you bring ba k
My husband safe and well;
The youth did ride, and soon did meet
John coming back amain,
Whom in a trice, he tried to stop
By catching at his rein.
But, not performing what he meant,
And gladly would have done.
The frightened steed he frightened more
And made him faster run;
Away went Gilpin, and away
Went post-boy at his heels—
The post-boy's horse right glad to miss
The lumb’ring of the wheels.
Six gentlemen upon the road,
Thus seeing Gilpin fly,
With post-boy scamp’ring in the rear,
They raised the hue and cry;
Stop thief I stop thief!—a highwayman 1
Not one of them was mute;
And all and each that pass’d the way
Did join in the pursuit.
And now the turnpike gates again
Flew open in short space
The toll-men thinking as before,
That Gilpin rode a race;
And so he did, and won it, too,
For he got first to town:
Nor stopp’d till, where he had got up,
He did again get down,
Now let us sing; Long live the king,
And Gilpin, long live he ;
And when he next doth ride abroa 1
May T iher* to see.

BOOKS give to him descriptions of
The world in which we live,
Of the universe around us,
And better still they give.
BOOKS give to him the greatest thoughts
Of all the good and wise;
BOOKS treasure human knowledge up,
And so it never dies.
BOOKS show him all that men have done,
What they have thought and said ;
BOOKS show the deeds and wisdom of
The living and the dead.
BOOKS shew him all the hopes and fears
Of every race and clan;
BOOKS clearly prove beyond a doubt
The brotherhood of man
BOOKS give him hopes beyond the grave
Of an immortal life ;
BOOKS teach that right and truth and love
Shall banish every strife.
BOOKS teach and please him when a child
In youth and in his prime ;
BOOKS give him soothing pleasure when
His health and strength decline.
BOOKS please him in his lonely hours,
Vfherever he may roam :
BOOKS please when read aloud among #
His loving friends at home.
BOOKS like strong drink will drown his cares,
But do not waste his wealth ;
BOOKS leave him better, drink the worst,
In character and health.
BOOKS therefore, are, of all man buys,
The choicest thing on earth ;
BOOKS have, of all his household goods,
The most intrinsic worth.
BOOKS are the greatest blessing out.
The grandest thing we sell,
BOOKS bring more joy, BOOKS do more good
Than mortal tongue can tell

PHE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE.
TiHERE was an old woman who lived in a shoe,
__ She had so many children—such naughty ones too!
She cried, “Oh, dear me, I don’t know what to do,
Who would be an old woman, and live in a shoe?”
Once ninety little fellows sat down on the floor
And lustily screamed, “we won’t cry any more!”
“Then stop crying now,” the old woman said,
The noise you are making goes right through my head.
Then she gave the boys broth without any bread,
And whipped them all soundly and sent them to bed.
She scolded the girls, and said, “Don’t make a noise,
Or you shall be served just the same as the boys.”


Mother Goose.
Old Mother Goose, when
She wanted to wander,
Would ride through the air
On a very fine gander.
Mother Goose had a house,
’Twas built in a wood,
Where an owl at the door
For sentinel stood.
She had a son Jack,
A plain-looking lad,
He was not very good,
Nor yet very bad.
She sent him to market ;
A live goose he bought;
Here, mother, says he,
It will not go for nought.
Jack’s goose and her gander
They grew very fond ;
They’d both eat together,
Or swim in one pond.
Jack found one morning,
As I have been told,
His goose had laid him
An egg of pure gold.
Jack rode to his mother,
The news for to tell,
She call’d him a good boy,
And said it was well.
Jack sold his gold egg
To a rogue of a Jew,
Who cheated him out of
The half of his due.
Then Jack went a-courting
A lady so gay,
As fair as the lily.
And sweet as the May.
The Jew and the Squire
Came behind his back,
And began to belabour
The sides of poor Jack.
Then old Mother Goose
That instant came in,
And turned her son Jack
Into fam’d Harlequin.
She then with her wand
Touch’d the lady so fine,
And turn’d her at once
Into sweet Columbine.
The gold egg in the sea
Was quickly thrown, when
Jack gave a quick dive,
And soon got it again.
The Jew got the goose,
Which he vow’d he would kill
Resolving at once
His pockets to fill.
Jack’s mother came in,
And caught the goose soon,
And mounting its back,
Flew up to the moon.
Old Woman nnder a Hill.
Thkue was an old woman lived under a hill,
Put a mouse in a bag, and sent it to mill ;
The Miller declar’d by the point of his knife,
He ne’er saw such a big mouse in his life.
Old Woman under a Hill.

And if she’s not gone, she’s lives there still.
Old Woman and T hree Sons.
There was an old woman had three sons ;
Jerry, and James, and John.
Jerry was hung, James was drowned ;
John was lost, and never was found ;
And there was an end of the three sons,
Jerry, and James, and -John.
Old Woman who Lived in a Shell.
A little old woman, as I’ve heard tell,
Lived near the sea, in a nice little shell ;
She was well off, if she wanted her tea—
She’d plenty of water from out of the sea.
Then if for her dinner she had the least wish.
Of course she had nothing to do but to fish ;
So, really, this little old woman did well,
As she didn’t pay any rent for the use of the shell.
Old Woman Swallowed.
There was an old woman called Nothing-at-all,
Who rejoiced in a dwelling exceedingly small ;
A man stretched his mouth to its utmost extent,
And down at one gulp house and old woman
went.
Old Woman’s Calf.
There was an old woman sat spinning.
And that’s the first beginning;
She had a calf, and that s half ;
She took it by the tail,
And threw it over the wall, and that s all.
Old Woman Drowned.
There was an old woman, her name it was
Peg;
Her head was of wood, and she wore a cork-
leg.
The neighbors all pitched her into the water,
Her leg was drown'd first, and her head
followed a’ter.
Old Woman of Stepney.
At Stepney there lived,
As every one knows,
An old woman who had
A plum tree on her nose !
The boys, while she slept,
Would cautiously take
The plums from her tree
Before she could wake.
This old woman went
One day to the lawn
Of my Lord Cockagee,
And there saw a fawn
Having shot him, she tied
His hind legs to her tree.
And so quitted the lawn
Of my Lord Cockagee.
She’d nearly reached home.
When the constable cam -,
And put her in prison
For killing the game.
While locked in her cell,
She thought again and a .rain
Of how to escape,
But kept thinking in vain.
She considered each plan,
Till she found out a way
Of escaping from prison
In the course of the day.
She cut the plum tree
Close off from her nose,
And made a scarecrow,
Dress’d up in her clothes ;
This she set on a stool,
With its back to the wall,
And watch’d near the door
For fear it should fall.
Soon the jailor came in
With her water and bread;
He stared at the figure,
While from prison she fled.
The old woman reached home,
Singing diddle-dee-dee ;
And again on her nose
There grew a pin in tr**.

So she had it made sharp,
And purchased a harp.
On which to play tunes with her chin
There was an old lady whose eyes,
Were unique as to colour and size ;
When she opened them wide,
People all turned aside,
And started away in surprise.
There was a young lady of Hexham,
Contradicted her friends just to vex 'em j
She talked about horses,
And rode on racecourses,
This forward young lady of Hexham.

A Wonderful Search Journey by the 40 principal modes of travelling in
I have always been a man of one idea
at a time, and that one idea I have fol-
lowed with unwavering determination
until success has rewarded my efforts.
Now listen to my story:—A short time
ago, much desiring to obtain a particu-
lar article, I determined to get it if it
was possible to do so in this world, and
so started on my search journey. I
ran into Melbourne and asked His Ex-
cellency the Governor of Victoria if he
knew where I could get it, he said he
did not but I might ask the Rajah of
Sarawak. I took ship to Sarawak,
asked the Rajah, he said he did not
know, but referred me to the Mikado
of Japan. I jumped into a boat, pulled
to Jedo, asked His Dual Majesty, Lord
Paramount of Japan, and head of the
Sintoo Faith, he said he did not know,
but perhaps the Tycoon of Japan did.
I got into a jimriksha and was trotted
away to the house of the unfortunate
Tycoon, he said he could not help me,
but referred me to the Great Cham of
Tartary, I jumped into a Chinese junk,
bore away to Pekin and saw the Great
Cham of the Celestials, “Son of Hea-
ven,” “Brother to the Sun, Moon and
Stars;” “Father of Mankind,”
“Governor of the World” and head of
the Confucian Faith. He condescend-
ingly said he did not know, but maybe
the Tiang of Nankin could inform me;
I took a sailing wheelbarrow to the
Centre of Wise Learning, saw the head
of the Taoist Faith, he could not tell
me where to get it but perhaps the
Grand Lama of Thibet could, I jumped
on the back of a Yak. rode to Lassa, in-
terviewed the head of the Buddhist
Faith he said he wanted one himself,
but did not know where to get it, go,
says he, to the Czar of Russia, present
my compliments and ask him for one
for yourself and one for me. I took
passage in a reindeer sleigh to St.
Petersburg, saw the Czar, he referred
me to his brother monarch the Keizar
of Austria, I jumped on a horse, gal-
loped away to Vienna, saw the Keizar,
he did not know, but I could try the
Queen of England, I jumped into an
electric train, made for the metropolis
of the world, saw Her Royal, Imperial,
and Republican Majesty the “Queen of
England, “Empress of India,” Sover-
eign of Canada, Australia, and forty
other countries, the powerful and belov-
ed ruler of the finest race of men, and
the largest, mightiest, and grandest
Empire the world ever saw. I now
said to myself I surely shall get the
article I want from the vast resources
of Her Majesty, but in answer to my
query she politely remarked that she
did not think I should get it in her
dominions but was almost certain that
I could get it from the Chief of the
Greenland Esquiraeaux, I rose up in a
balloon, flew through the air across the
Atlantic, saw the Chief, he could hot
say but referred me to the Viceroy of
the Dominion, I jumped on the back of
a reindeer, trotted away to Ottawa, saw
the Viceroy, he was positively ignorant
on the subject and referred me to the
Mormon Prophet. Got into an ice ship,


slid away over the snow to Utah, saw
the Prophet, he had heard of it but did
not know where I should get it, but I
might at least ask the Sacham of the
Flat-Head Indians, I jumped into a
dog-sleigh, scampered away, hailed the
Sachem, he did not know, but perhaps
the President of Peru did, rode on a
one-man sedan to the City of Earth-
quakes, saw the President, he did not
know, but would I be so good as ask the
Emperor of Brazil, I sprang on to the
back of a llama, flopped away to Rio;
the American Emperor said he did not
know himself, but surely the Sheikh of
Timbuctoo ought to tell. I jumped
into a canoe crossed the Atlantic,
reached the negro city, asked the Sheikh,
he said it was like my impudence ask-
ing him, how should he know such a
thing? none of the traditions nf the
negro continent mentioned it, hut if I
thought that such a thing existed I had
better ask his Sublime Mightiness the
Sultan of Zanzibar, I jumped on the
back of an ostrich, strode away to the
Isle of Beauty, saw the Sultan, he shook
his head and referred me to the Negus
of Abyssinia, I was carried rapidly in a
head palenkeen on the heads of four
negroes to Magdala, spoke to the
Negus, he referred me to the Khedive
of Egypt, I got into a water-velocipede,
trod away up the Red Sea to the city
of the Pyramids, saw the Khedive, he
referred me to the Sherif of Mecca, I
at once bestrode a donkey, cantered
avvay to the Sacred City, asked the cus-
todian of the Precious Tomb of the
Great Prophet, the query nonplussed
him, and he desired me to wait on the
Imaun of Muscat, I mounted a camel,
ambled across to the hot city of the
Imaun, he could not say but referred
me to the Rao of Cutch, I made for
Bhooj on a raft, spoke to the Rao, he
had not got one, but referred me to the
Guicowar of Gujerat and considerately
lent me a pair of ten-feet stilts for the
journey. I waded from the City of
Dismal Swamps and finally reached
Baroda on my stilts, saw the Guicowar,
he had never heard of the article, but
referred me to the High Priest of the
Parsees, I got into a sedan, was borne
to Bombay, saw the head of the Parsee
Faith, he had not the article, did not be-
lieve that it existed, as it was not men-
tioned in any of the sacred books of the
Parsees. but finally referred me to the
Biby of Canonore, I mounted an Ele-
phant stamped down the coast, ad-
dressed the Biby, she said it was the
first time she had heard of the article,
but the Maharajah of Mysore might
have one. I stepped into a palenkeen
the World, and a Prize of £lOOO offered tor a Flying Machine.


and four men trotted away to Mysore,
the Great Rajah said he had not got one,
perhaps the Nizam of Hyderabad could
assist me, I got into a horse-sedan, went
to Hyderabad, saw the Nizam, he did
not know and suggested the Grand
Mahunt of Benares. I got into a
horse-palenkeen, made straight for the
City of the Sacred Shrines, saw the
head of the Hindoo Faith, he did not
know where it could be got, but had I
asked the Thackoor of Bhrownnuggar ?
No!—or the Swat of Ackoond, or the
Mudor of Cassala, or the Hospodar of
Wallachia, or the Aboona of Gondar or
the Patriarch of Constantinople, or the
Archbishop of Canterbury ? I said
most decidedly not —that I would not-
waste my time in consulting such in-
significant magnates, then, says he, just
you ask the Guro of the Sikhs. I
jumped astride of a Bramah Bull, and
trotted away to Amritsar; saw the head
of the Sikh Faith, he had no* got the
article, had not heard of it, but advised
me to apply to the Ameer of Afghanis-
tan. I got into an ox dooly and at
length reached Cabul, saw the Ameer,
he had not got it, had not seen it, nor
heard of it, did not believe the article
existed, but the Khan of Bokhara could
speak more positively about it. I got
into ?. Tocan or Hamockeen and was
carried by two men to Bokhara, inter-
viewed the Khan, he said it was absurd
for the Ameer to send to him, he knew
nothing of it, but the Shah of Persia
probably did; I got into a mule sleigh,
glided awa} :o Teheran, enquired of the
Shah, could get no satisfaction, he never
heard of it, was I sure there was such
an article in existence? I told him
that I wanted to find out, but I thought
there must be somewhere. Oh, then,
said he, try the Chief Rabbi of Jerusa-
lem. I got into a coach, tore away to
the Holy City of the Jews; asked the
head of the Jewish Faith, he had not
one, I had better ask the Pasha of Da-
mascus 1 jumped astride of a bicycle.
trundled away to the oldest city in the
world; asked the Pasha, he could not
say, I had better ask the Emir of the
Druses. 1 creeped up the Lebanon in
a bullock-waggon; saw and asked the
head of the Druse Faith, he referred me
to the Bey of Tunis. I got on to a
tricycle, rode to Tunis; saw the Bey,
he could not tell, perhaps the Pope of
Rome could. I jumped into a ship,
the Eternal City, asked the
head of the Christian Church, His Holi-
ness could not tell, perhaps the Grand
Seigneur of Turkey might. I stepped
into a railway steam carriage, swept
around to the Golden Horn; saw His
Sublime Mightiness the Padishaw, b*

said that he had not got one and never
heard of it; but when I described to
him, in clear, concise and glowing terms,
the real value of the article to the whole
human race, he said that every person
black or white, or brown, or yellow,
or red, or any other colour whatever,
in the world, should have one, and that
it was the duty of all Kings and Queens
and Emperors, and Sultans, and Czars,
and Keizars, and Khedives, and Khans,
and Shahs, and Ameers, and Deys, and
Beys, and Great Chams, and Grand
Lamas, to see that every one of their
subjects obtained one without delay. I
said that those were exactly my senti-
ments; but where was it to be got. lie
again graciously assured me that he
did not know, but I might ask the
frRAND Mufti of Turkey, the fountain
of all human knowledge, and custodian
of the sacred Koran. I tore along in
a goat-carriage, interviewed the head of
the Mahometan Faith; but in answer
to my query this Mighty Spiritual Mag-
nate seemed taken aback; he affirmed
that the Koran did not mention the
article, and, therefore, he believed it
could not exist, but had I made a thor-
ough search for it; had I tried the Dey
of Algiers. I answered no! Had I
tried the Doge of Venice—the Elector
of Saxony—the Begum of Oude —the
Stadholder of Holland—the Peishwa of
Poona —the Nabob of Bengal—the
Caliph of Bagdad—the Inca of Peru,
or the great Mogul. I looked at the
Grand Mufti in speechless astonish-
ment; he might as well have asked me
if I had enquired of Pharoah or Nebu-
chadnezzer. I shook my head and rush-
ed from his presence, completely non-
plussed, bewildered, frantic. Where on
earth was I to get the article? I had
asked, and asked, and asked again, and
was tired of asking. I had travelled
fifty thousand miles by forty different
modes of conveyance; consulted in their
own capitals with thirty secular raon-
archs, governing three-fourths of the
world; and I had with earnest, respect-
ful enquiry approached the sacerdotal
thrones of the spiritual monarchs of the
eleven principal religions of mankind,
and yet I could get no tidings of it.
What was Ito do? I was now standing
in front of the great Mosque at Con-
stantinople almost frantic with per-
plexity ; some one approached and
handed me a printed announcement. I
read it! It sent an inexpressible thrill
through me. I immediately took steam-
er foi Melbourne, landed there, jumped
into a cab, went straight to Cole’s Book
Arcade, and saw a drawing of the very
article I had ransacked the world over
to obtain, and what do you think it was ?
It was a Flying Machine ! I wanted a
flying machine, Mr. Cole informed me
that he had not got his machine to fly
yet, and that in all the world a machine
was not yet invented that would fly, but
that, through the active and progressive
ingenuity of the human intellect, such
a machine was certain to be invented in
the future, and as an earnest of his
strong conviction he handed me a docu-
ment, which ran as follows: —
October 31st, 1882.
I, the undersigned, firmly believe
that as man has already made machines
to run over the land and float over the
water faster than the swiftest animal,
§o shortly he will make machines to fly
through the air as fast, and finally fast-
er, than the swiftest birds do now. And
I hereby offer a bonus of £l,OOO to any
person who shall (in consequence of
said bonus) within the two years,
invent a flying machine, to go by Elec-
trical, Chemical, Mechanical, or any
other means, except by gas, a distance
of 100 miles, and shall come and stop
in front of the Book Arcade, Bourke
Street, Melbourne, Australia, as easily
and as safely as a carriage stops there

Miss Cole’s Aerial Flight in a Flying Machine.
My prophesy with regard to flying machines,
as may be seen by the original statement here-
with, was made twenty-eight yean; before the
French aviator brought his machine to Austra-
lia, which was on 2nd November, 1910, or two
weeks before his successful flight.
Subsequently Mr. Hammond flew over the
city. He remarked, “I was too early for
breakfast, and just thirty years too late to
claim E. W. Cole’s prize of £1000.”
I believe that the advance of flying machines
will be so rapid that within the next decade
they will be used with as much ease and safety
as any other means of present locomotion.
I further state that their utility will be so
great as to enable China, with her three hun-
dred millions, to succeed in taking correct
statistics.
And eventually the velocity with which they
will fly may materially assist in establishing
the peace of the world and the Parliament of
Man.
My prophecy with regard to Flying
Machines was made in 1868, and the bonus
of £lOOO (see previous page) was offered in

PASSENGERS ACCOMPANY HARRY
HAWKER TO THE CLOUDS.
It was Mr. E. W. Cole’s enthusiasm and be-
lief in the ultimate success of aerial navigation
that induced Miss Linda Cole to fly with Mr.
Hawker, the daring young aviator, at Eistern-
wick recently. Miss Cole was perfectly calm
and collected when entering the biplane, and
showed no signs of “nerviness.” During the
flight around St. Kilda, Brighton and Sandring-
ham, and across the waters of Hobson’s Bay,
she conversed freely with Mr. Hawker, and
commented on the panoramic views which un-
folded themselves below. Miss Cole, having
heard that Mr. Hawker had some intention of
flying on a non-stop journey from Sydney to
Melbourne —a distance of 500 miles —was most
anxious to accompany him, providing the Sop-
with biplane would carry two persons in ad-
dition to the tank of petrol which would, of
course, be indispensable. Mr. Hawker, however,
says he would not take a passenger should he
undertake the journey. Miss Cole is most
anxious for another sea flight, as she is of
opinion that the power to see through the water
to the bottom of the ocean is one of the ut-
most importance, as it would in warfare en-
able aviators to locate with accuracy mines in
harbours and any other submerged dangers. Her
most ardent wish is to become a lady aviator,
and she is contemplating a trip to Europe to ob-
tain up-to-date instruction in the aerial art.
The reason Miss Cole went up was because
her father has always taken a great interest in
aviation, and many years ago offered substan-
tial prizes to constructors of airships. He has
ever evinced great faith in the ultimate triumph
of aerial navigation, and she is so glad that his
dreams are being realised. Miss Cole went up
on Friday, on the thirteenth of the month.
Friday and the number 13 are considered un-
lucky ; but all big events in her life have been
associated with the number 13.

IN AND OUT-DOOR GAMES.
COLE’S GAME OF FAVORITES.
(a game for the educated.)
COLE'S Game of FAVORITES U founded upon the principle of "Confessions." It la a good game to sharpen the intellect, 1» 4
encouraging the players to think, to diacriminate, and to have opinions of their own It is played aa follows—
- DIRECTIONS.
The company seat themselves aronnd,
a judge is appointed, and he then asks
the first person on the left one of the
hundred questions, and commences to
count 20. If the question is answered
correctly before the 20 are counted the
person questioned is WISE, and the
judge passes on to the next. The first
one who does not answer to time is there
and then solemnly sentenced by the judge
as a MUFF, and the judge passes on to
the next one. The fun of the game is to
see how many MUFFS the judge can
catch in the company, and if he do not
catch one in three times going round, or
asks a wrong question, he himself is pro-
nounced the GREATEST MUFF, and
a new judge is appointed.
The game can be played by two friends
or two lovers, and yet be very interesting
and instructive; for instance, Edwin can
ask Angelina ten questions to see if he
can catch her, and then Angelina can usk
Edwin ten questions to see if she can
catch him, and so on, or they can ask
question and question about, and see
which is caught first

PROCLAMATION BY AUTHORITY.
Be it known unto all of you that to find your own portrait and the fashion of your bat or bonnet, your Christian
name and the Alphabet are used.
The Alphabet is divided into four parts for the second letter of each person’s name as follows:—The letters A B C D E F
belong to No. i portrait in each row, and in the case of the first portrait of the letter A include such names as Abigail, Ada,
Aaron, Abraham, Adolphus. The letters G H I J K L belong to the second portrait in each row, and in the case of the second
portrait, of the letter A include such names as Agnes, Alice, Ahaz, Alfred. The letters MNO P Q R belong to the third
portrait of each row, and in the case of the letter A include such names as Amy, Anna, Arabella, Amos, Andrew, Arthur. The
letters STUVWXY Z belong to the fourth portrait in each row, and in the case of the letter A include such names as Athalia,
Augusta, Asa, Augustus. The same rule is followed with each letter of the Alphabet: for instance, the first portrait in the row
B belongs to such names as Barbara, Bessie, Bartholomew, Benjamin, and so on throughout the whole collection of portraits.
If a woman is looking for her future husband, she must first find the number of her own portrait and then find the corres-
ponding number amongst the men’s, and THAT IS TO BE HER HUSBAND : for instance, if her own portrait is No. 27,
No. 27 amongst the men’s is the portrait of her future darling. The same rule is to be followed by the men. If a man’s
portrait is No. 93, No. 93 amongst the ladies’ IS TO BE HIS WIFE, his own future angel.
If the persons who consult this oracle are single, the sweetheart that falls to their lot will be their first husband or wife, and
|tte jjanW flirts sf fats
COLE’S GAME OF
OR, HUOBANDH


if they are married it will be their second husband or wife, an 1 if they have been married twice it will be their third one,
and so on up to 144 times of being married; and after that no one will be allowed to consult this oracle, look at it, speak of it,
or even think about it, such objectionable persons being entirely excluded from its benefits.
Persons who consult this oracle must accept the husband or wife that falls to their lot just the same as if they married them
in the usual way, but if dissatisfied on account of ugliness, dress, or any other cause the consulter, by doing penance in the shape
of a pilgrimage to a certain place in the exact centre of the world and paying a small sum, can obtain a DIVORCE.
’The place to which the pilgrimage is to be made is Cole’s Book Arcade, Bourke Street, Melbourne, Australia, where they
must buy a book of some kind, and that act DIVORCES them at once.
Bashful persons need not mention their pilgrimage at the Book Arcade, when they purchase the book, unless they choose.
'Anyone having obtained a DIVORCE will be allowed to choose out of g other portraits. If the number of the portrait
that fell to their lot was 8, they can choose any other number ending with 8, as 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, and 98, or if their
first number was 65 they can choose from 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 75, 85, 95, and so on ; whatever their number was, they
may choose from the corresponding figures throughout the table.
If, after making a choice out of the g portraits, anyone is still dissatisfied, by making 10 pilgrimages to the Book Arcade, or
by buying and giving away 10 copies of this Funny Picture Book, they can claim the indulgence of a GRAND DIVORCE
and choose which they like out of the whole 104 porraits.
Given under our Royal hand and toe Palace ol tbe Boci. Arcade, this aist day ai November, 188 a.—COLE, REX.

For this flock did you pay?"
Says B, " I paid for all I drive
Just six pounds and a crown;
And I’m going to sell them, aM but fiVe t

When fifteen pence a head I’ll charge
Above what they cost me;
And thus obtain a sum as large
As I gave for all you see."

He bought aj geese at ss. each, and meant to ask
6* 3d each
Oft sought in the country, much prized in the town?
Like a king, above all, I can boast of a crown ;
If not found in the palace, I grace the chateau;
Both the peer and the peasant my usefulness know
When I've not seen six months I am said to be old:
Though exalted by nobles, I’m bought and I'm sold ;
Though ne’er in a sermon, I take part in all chat ;
Yet I'm ne'er found in this, but I’m always in that.
I'm seen in most colours, am brown, black, or white,
But am rarely found red and, when good, lam light,
In demand with both sexes, selected with care,
I’m prized by most men and add grace to the fair
Of no use to my owner while kept in his sight.
I attend him by day, and oft serve him by night;
As his slave lam passive; yet, strange it may sound,
To keep me in order, I’m frequently bound.
My fetters are silken ; I’m useless at home,
Though a constant companion whenever you roam ;
And, though no enchantment within me doth dwell,
Pray tell me my name—for In that lies a spell I
A HAT
Twas born in anguish, ’twas cradled by care,
And has lived ever since in the depths of despair ;
It dwells in the valley, it glides on the wave,
It is laid with our ashes when cold in the grave
In darkness it brightens, in sunshine it dies,
And far from the smile of enjoyment it flies.
In the rainbow it sits, in the stars it has birth,
And with angels descending it visits the earth.
With Adam it dwelt, and to Paradise came,
But Eve knew it not, though it shared in her shame
It mingles in battle, yet still it loves peace,
It joins in the banquet, the dance, and the chase
From the dream of our childhood it ne'er can depart,
And it lies, like a gem, in the core of the heart
The traveller bears it o'er desert along ;
The nightingale loves it, though strange to her song ;
On the point of the arrow it cleaves through the air,
Yet the pinions of birds cannot follow it there
The bosom disowns it; yet bright through our tears,
When shed in affection, it ever appears
The cataract fearfully hurries it on ;
But, search it through billows and tempests —'tis gone
From the joys of our mortal existence 'tis driven,
Yet finds an unchanging asylum in heaven
With the harp of the minstrel it ever shall dwell ;
And it comes to my lips as I utter ’’ Farewell ”
THE LETTER A.
Though grief give* me birth, I’m a stranger to care
I scorn the dull earth, and float in the air;
No lover claims me, though I revel in bliss ;
I taste of each lip, and melt in each kiss.
I'm an egotist's pride, though in silence I reign;
And, though free from sorrow, I’m always in pain.
Though in laughter ne’er seen, in mirth I delight;
In blindness I grope, though perfect in sight.
In foolishness, Wisdom, and wit I’ve a place ;
Though dwelling in virtue, I live in disgrace
Though frost knows me not. with winter I blend ;
And always to ice I’m a capital friend.
I'm never in heat, though I live in the fire ,
Though never in want, I'm in every desire
lam I ; but the end of mv paper 1 *py,
So I'U wind op my stave and wish yea good-toy

SMALLEST NEWSPAPER ON EARTH.
This smallest newspaper in the world, containing facts, fun, fiction, etc., was published March ti, 1904,
to show concisely but emphatically the unwisdom, unfairness, inhumanity, and utter impossibility of a “ White
Australia.” It was forwarded to 830 newspapers, 847 legislators, and 10,000 prominent citizens in all parts of
Australasia, and is reproduced here in the hope that it may help to stimulate thought on this most important
subject. The central idea is the 30 reasons—the puzzle, the riddle, and the fun are only used as the sugar round
the pill, to arrest the attention and particularly to get our amusement-engrossed people to think on the subject.

Japanese Press Notices
"In a series of brochures which iiave now gone through four edi-
tions, Mr. E, W. Cole deals with the question of ‘A White Australia.’
He is evidently a man of very broad views, entirely free from the
racial prejudices so prevalent now a days, and his manner of mar
shalling his arguments is very forcible. The greater part of the first
of his brochures is devoted to a statement of Japan's achievements
and conditions, with the purpose of demonstrating her rapid growth
and the facts which render her people desirable associat s. In onr
Judgment Mr. Cole has compiled an excellent account of Japan
Taken as a whole his essay conveys a trustworthy and comprehen
sive view of this empire, its people, its institutions, and Its progress
. No race has or can have a monopoly of the earth's breadstuffs
As for 'A White Australia,’ considering that a large belt o fthe great
island lies in the tropics, white people settling there must look in
time to lose their skin distinction ."—Japan Mail, July 9, 1903
"The self imposed task of Mr. E. W Cole is intimately connected
with a problem of most vital importance to Japan. Here is an over
crowded and still increasing population, and there is a vast country
comparatively unpopulated. Here is an energetic Industrial nation,
sadly needing fields for labour; there is a fine large territory,starved
and wasted for lack of labour. . . Nations that are growing will
assert their right to find room wherever there is room ; and untilled
fields will he seized by the right of might, it not thrown open in
some other way. People are not to hold land without making good
use of it. If the Australians will not open their eyes and listen to
reason, they may some day lie surprised to find themselves in a
trouble from which the Mother Country may refuse to extricate
them.’’— Japan Gazette. Sept. 17. 1903
“The Australians will do well to calmly reflect whether, in face
of their dwindling birthrate, they have acted wisely in slamming
their doors upon foreign immigrants " —Japan Times. Sept. 17,1903.
“It is only a matter of common sense to se that the exclusion
policy is not to the advantage of the Island, if it should be «vsr
developed.’* —Mainichi Shimbun, Sept. 10, 1903.
. “ Mr. Cole is performing a great service in attacking— o tar as it
affects Australia-a question which is the forefront of social prob
lems to-day Any honest attempt to lead public opinion along
lines which lead smoothly towards a broader outlook is valuable.
Thus we may wisli Mr. Cole tire succ ss his sincerity and his
abounding energy deserve.’’— Nagasaki Press, July 8, 1903

i Much in Little, or News in a Nut-shell Page.
30 Strong Reasons why “ A White
Australia” is Impossible.
i. Because every 7th person in the Commonwealth s
ilready more or less coloured, and gradually many will blend.
2 Because the sun is the cause of skin-colour.
3. Because all Australians will in time become coloured.
4. Because the white man cannot work in the tropics.
5. Because white women become wrecks in the tropics.
6 Because white children cannot be reared in the tropics.
7. Because the coloured man must develop the tropics.
8. Because Jesus Christ was a coloured man.
9. Because Jesus taught the universal brotherhood of man.
10. Because humanity exists in every human heart.
11. Because the feeling of human kinship is universal.
12. Because all mankind are capable of inter-blending.
13. Because all mankind are inter-blending everywhere.
14. Because the British people are for universal freedom.
15. Because the British Empire has 7 coloured to 1 white.
16. Because the Act is an inrult to all coloured nations.
17. Because Australia will tire of being a laughing-stock.
18. Because Australia's own humanity is against the Act,
and all Christian teaching is, must, and will be against it.
19. Because the Act is against the interests of commerce.
20. Because the Act prevents the development of Australia.
21. Because our white birth-rate is diminishing.
22. Because enough white emigrants will not come so far.
23. Because we are surrounded by coloured people.
24. Because Australia hasico times the area of Scotland and
a few million of white people have no right to monopolize it.
25. Because Japan, China, India, and Java are awakening.
26. Because China has 400 millions and is overflowing.
27. Because India has 300 millions and is overflowing.
28. Because Java’s 30 millions are very near to Australia.
29. Because the whole world belongs to those who need it.
30. Because God has made mankind of one flesh and blood
" Man is man through all gradations, little recks it where he stands,
How divided into nations, scattered over many lands;
Man is man by form and feature man by vice and virtue too ;
Man in all, one common nature speaks and hinds us brothers true."
Pick out the five strongest of the above reasons and you
will see that their united power is sufficient to gradually
abolish the Act—also ask your friends to pick out five.
Each of the 30 Reasons should be discussed separately.

WHAT IS LOVE?
Maggie Foreman answers:
‘‘What is love? I know it well,
For I live beneath its sway
Tis a passion, 'tis a spell,
That we cannot chase away;
Oh! I cannot tell you clearly,
All its meaning, all its power;
Brighter than the brightest jewel,
Sweeter than the sweetest flower.
Maria Lovell answers:
" What love is if thou would’st be taught
Thy heart must teach alone ;
Two souls with but a single thought,
Two hearts that beat as one.”
Again the Question is Asked —WHAT IS LOVE?
And this is Father’s answer:
“ Love is a nightmare with one foot,
Two children with one bun,
Two turnips with a single root,
Two cabbage heads in one."
POET’S GREATEST POEM.
It was a cold and wintry night,
A man stood in the street;
His aged eyes were full of tears,
His boots were full of feet.

CAT STORIES.
Puss in the Well,
Ding dong dell, pussy’s in the well !
Who put her in ?—little Tommy Lin.
Who pulled her out?—dog with long snout.
What a naughty boy was that
To drown poor pussy cat,
Who never did any harm,
But kill’d the mice in his father’s barn.
The Singing Cat.
A cat came fiddling out of a barn,
With a pair of bagpipes under her arm ;
She could sing nothing but fiddle cum fee,
The mouse has married the humble-bee.
Pipe cat.—dance mouse,
We’ll have a wedding at our good house.
Puss in London.
Pussy-cat, pussy-cat, where have you
been ?
I’ve been up to London to look at the
Queen.
Pussy-cat, pussy-cat, what did you
there ?
I frighten’d a little mouse under the
chair.
Pussy-Cat and Mousey.
Pussy-Cat lives in the servant’s hall,
She can set up her back and purr ;
The little Mice live in a crack in the
wall,
But they hardly dare venture to stir ;
For whenever they think of taking the
air,
Or filling their little maws,
The Pussy-cat says, “Come out if you
dare;
I will catch you all with ray claws.”
Scramble, scramble, scramble, went all
the little Mice,
For they smelt the Cheshire cheese ;
The Pussy-Cat said, “It smells very
nice,
Now do come out, if you please.”
Squeak,” said the little Mouse;
“ squeak, squeak, squeak,”
Said all the young ones too; [about,
“We never creep out when cats are
Because we’re afraid of you.” [mat
So the cunning old Cat lay down on a
By the fire in the servants’ hall:
•• If the little Mice peep, they’ll think I’m
asleep;”
So she rolled herself up like ball.
“ Squeak,” said the little Mouse, we’ll,
creep out
And eat some Cheshire cheese,
That silly old Cat is asleep on the mat,
And we may sup at our ease.”
Nibble, nibble, nibble went all the little mice,
And they licked their little paws ;
Then the cunning old Cat sprang up from
the mat,
And caught them all with her claws.
Puss in the Pantry.
Hie, hie, says Anthony, puss is in the pantry
Gnawing, gnawing a mutton, mutton-bone ;
See now she tumbles it, see now she mumbles it,
See how she tosses the mutton, mutton-bone.
Dick killed Puss.
Do look at the cat ! why, what is she at ?
She’s catching a rat that’s hid in Dick’s hat.
Dick ran for a bat to knock him down flat,
But, crossing the mat the foolish young brat
Tripped up and fell flat, He half killed the cat
Instead of the rat, Hal cried out that that
Was just tit for tat.
Puss and the Monkey.
Says Mr. Monkey, giving a wink ;
“ It would be exceedingly funny, I think,
To catch the cat, and give her a drink,
Out of a great big bottle of ink.”
So, suiting the action to the word,
He caught up Puss, but she demurred ;
And made such a noise you never heard,
And said it ‘twas worse than eating a bird.
The Puss she didn’t like ink at all!
She didn’t like bottles great or small ;
Ink to her was worse than gall,
And so she did nothing but spit, mew, and
squall
And that’s all !
Sing Sing.
Sing, sing, what shall I sing 7
The cat has ale the pudding-string !
Do, do, what shall I do ?
The eat has bit it quite in two.
Good Puss.
Poor Puss, dear, lovely pretty puss,
Content at home to stay ;
Thy pleasure’s shown in gambol tricks
And loves to skip and play.
Grateful for every sup of milk,
And every bit of meat ;
Gives lively proof of gratitude
By singing while you eat.
See, how she cleans her sleeky skin I
A soil would prove a flaw ;
She licks her neck, her sides, her back,
And don’t forget her paw.
Mary’s Puss Drowned.
Mary had a little cat,
With long snow-white hair,
Such a merry little cat,
Jumping everywhere.
When Mary went to take a walk,
Pussy ran to meet her,
Rubbed its head against her frock
And said, ‘Purr, purr,’ to greet her.
Once, when Mary was at school,
Some cruel bad boys found it,
And in a pond beside the road,
Oh, sad to tell, they drowned it!
Poor Mary’s face was wet with tears,
When she found Pussy lying :
I would not be a cruel boy,
To set poor Mary crying.
My Pussy,
I love little Pussy, her coat is so warm;
And if I don’t hurt her, she’ll do me
no harm,
So I’ll not pull her tail, nor drive her
away,
But Pussy and I very gently will play.
She’ll sit by my side, and I’ll give her
some food ;
And Pussy will love me, because I am
good.
Oh ! here is Miss Pussy; she’s drink-
ing her milk;
Her coat is as soft and as glossy as silk.
She sips the milk up with her little lap-lap;
Then, wiping her whiskers, lies down for a
nap.
My kitty is gentle, she loves me right well;
How funny her play is I’m sure I can’t tell.
Now under the sofa, now under the table.
She runs and plays bopeep as well as she’s
able.
Oh ! dearly I love her ! you never did see
Two happier playmates than kitty and me.


Dame Trot.
Dame Trot once went to a neighbouring fair,
And what do you think she bought herself there?
A pussy ! the prettiest ever was seen :
No cat was so gentle, so clever and clean.
Each dear little paw was as black as a sloe,
The rest of her fur was as white as the snow,
Her eyes were bright green, and her sweet little
face
Was pretty and meek, full of innocent grace.
Dame Trot hurried home with this beautiful cat;
Went upstairs to take off her cloak and her hat;
And when she came down was astonished to see
That Pussy was busy preparing the tea.
" Oh. what a strange cat! ” thought poor little
Dame Trot,
"She’ll break my best china and upset the pot.”
But no harm befell them : the velvety paws
Were quite sure; the Dame for alarm had no
cause.
Next morning when little Dame Trot came
downstairs,
To attend, as usual, to household affairs,
She found that the kitchen was swept up as
clean
As if Puss a regular servant had been.
The tea stood to draw, and the toast was
done brown ;
The Dame very pleased to her breakfast
sat down;
While Puss by her side on an armchair
sat up,
And lapped her warm milk from a nice
china cup.
Now Spot, the old house-dog, looked on in
amaze,
He’d never been used to such queer cattish
ways;,
But Puss mewed so sweetly, and moved
with such grace,
That Spot at last liked her. and licked her
white face.
Poor little Dame Trot had no money to
spare,
And only too often her cupboard was bare;
Then kind Mrs. Pussy would catch a nice
fish,
And serve it for dinner upon a clean dish.
The rats*and the mice, who wished Pussy
to please,
Were now never seen at the butter and
cheese;
The Dame daily found that their numbers
grew thinner,
For Puss ate a mouse every day for her
dinner.
If Puss had a weakness, I need but confess
'Twas a girl of the period’s fancy for dress,
Her greatest desire a high chignon and hat,
And a very short dress a la mode for a cat.
So one day when Dame Trot had gone out to dine,
Puss dressed herself up, as she thought, very fine,
And coaxed kind old Spot, who looked at her
with pride,
To play pony for her, and give her a ride.
Now Spot, who to welcome his mistress desired,
And to “company manners’’ had never aspired,
Jumped up to fawn on her—and down came
the cat,
And crushed, in her tumble, her feather and hat.
“Oh, puss!" said Dame Trot, "what a very
sad mess!
You’d best have remained in your natural dress;
The graces which Nature so kindly bestows
Are more often hid than improved by fine
clothes
MISTRESS PUSS AND DOGGY.
A little dog said, and he looked very wise,
" I think, Mistress Puss,
You make a great fuss
With your back and your great green eyes
And you, Madam Duck,
You waddle and cluck,
Till it gives one the fidgets to hear you ;
You’d better run off
To the old pig’s trough,
Where none but the pigs, ma’am, are near you.”
The duck was good-natured, and she ran away;
But old pussy-cat
With her back up sat,
And said she intended to stay ;
And she showed him her paws,
With her sharp, long claws,
So the dog was afraid to come near.
For Puss if she pleases,
When a little dog teases,
Can give him a box on the ear.
DON’T HURT PUSS.
1 like little pussy, her coat is so warm,
And if I don’t hurt her she’ll do me no harm;
So I'll not pull her tail, nor drive her away,
But pussy and I very gently will play.
HEAD IN THE MILK JUG.
Hoi Master. Mistress, Mary, run,
Your Tabby is in grief;
This broken jug caught hold of me
As though I were a thief.
CAT UP THE PLUM THEE.
Diddledy, diddledy, dumpty :
The cat ran up the plum tree
I lay you a crown
I’ll fetch her down ;
So diddledy, diddledy, dumpty.

PUSSY-CAT MOLE.
Pussy Cat Mole
Jumped over a coal,
And in her best petticoat burnt a great hole.
Poor Pussy is weeping, she’ll have «o more milk
Until her best peiticoat’s mended with silk.
The Three Little Kittens.
Three little kittens they lost their mittens,
And they began to cry,
“Oh! mammy dear, we sadly fear,
Our mittens we have lost.”
“What! lost your mittens,
You naughty kittens,
Then you shall have no pie.”
Miew miew. miew, miew.
The three little kittens had need of mittens :
The winter now was nigh.
" Oh ! mammy dear, we fear, we fear,
Our mittens we shall need.”
“Go, seek your mittens,
You silly kittens;
There’s tempest in the sky.”
Miew, miew, miew, miew.
The three little kittens, in seeking their
mittens,
Upset the table high.
“ Oh ! mammy dear, we doubt and fear,
The house is tumbling down.”
“You foolish kittens,
Go find your mittens,
And do not make things fly.”
Miew, miew, miew, miew.
The three little kittens they found their
mittens,
And they began to cry,
“Oh ! mammy dear, see here, see here,
Our mittens we have found.”
"What! found your mittens,
You little kittens;
Then you shall have some pie.”
Purr, purr, purr, purr.
The three little kittens put on their mittens,
And soon ate up the pie;
"Oh ! mammy dear, we greatly fear.
Our mittens we have soiled.”
" What ! soiled your mittens,
You naughty kittens ! ”
Then they began to sigh.
Miew, miew, miew, miew.
The three little kittens they washed their
mittens,
And hung them up to dry ;
“Oh! mammy dear, look here, look here,
Our mittens we have washed.”
What! washed your mittens,
You darling kittens !
But I smell a rat close by !
Hush! Hush!” Miew, miew.
The three little kittens put off their mittens,
A hunting match to try.
“ Oh ! mammy dear, his hole is here :
Our mittens down we fling,”
Both cat and kittens
Flung down their mittens;
When —whisk!—the rat ran by.
Miew, miew, miew, miew.
Die Dunce of a Kitten.
Come, Pussy, will you learn to read ?
I've got a pretty book ;
Nay, turn this way, you must indeed,
Fie, there’s a sulky look !
Here's a pretty picture, see
An apple and great A ;
How stupid you will ever be
If you do nought but play I
Come, A B C, an easy task,
What anyone can do ;
I will do anything you ask,
For dearly 1 love you.
No, no, your lesson is not done,
You have not learnt it half;
You’ll grow a downright simpleton.
And make the people laugh.

The Story of a Little Mouse:
OR, OUR HAPPY FAMILY.
Once there was a little mouse,
Who came to live in our house ;
She came because she was terribly frighten’d
To stay outside aa it thunder’d and lighten’d.
When she came in 'twas nearly dark.
And Ponto he began to bark ;
But she ran round at a rapid rate,
Then darted in behind the grate.
Ponto smelt, and sniff'd, and bark’d and scratch’d
But Mousey was safe and could’nt be catch d ;
Bn Ponto when tired laid down to sleep,
And Mousey quite quiet determined to keep.
Mousey staid there a month, as she thought it was bettor,
And Ponto could smell her, but never could get her.
But every morning when Ponto went out.
Miss Mousey crept forth, and for crumbs looked about
Now one day as Ponto came into the house
Thinks he, I’ll be kind to that poor little mouse
“ Bo come our Miss Mousey,” our Ponto he said,
r And if any one hurts you I’ 11 bite off his head
Bo the poor little mouse came out of the grate,
And ate with our Ponto out of his plate,
And always when Ponto laid down on the mat,
Beside him Miss Mousey in her little chair sat
But one rainy night as Miss Mousey sat still,
A thing called a bat, came over the hill ;
But Ponto says to him, “You are not wanted here,”
And he sent that bat off with a flea in his ear
The very same night as they lay on the mat,
What should come rushing in but a great big rat;
Dp jumped Mr. Ponto and gave a loud bark,
And that rat »camner»d off out into the dark.
The; had just got rid of the bat and the rat,
An ’ what should come in but a Great Tom Cat;
Came jumping, springing, and bounding along,
And frighten'd Miss Mouaey more than a gong
He raced after mousey, around, in and out,
Through the house and the yard, and all round about ,
To the East, to the West, to the North, to the South,
And at last caught her up in his great big mouth.
He squeezed her back hard and frighten’d her so,
She scarcely could say, “ Oh, please let me go I ”
But Tom spoke and said, “ Mouse is very good meat.
And as I feel hungry, why, it’s you I shall eat.’’
Tom let her go once, but he caught her afresh,
Although Mousey made a most desperate dash ,
And again Mousey pleaded, “Oh, please let me go ;
But Tom only answered, “ Decidedly No I ”
But as luck should now have it, our Ponto came in,
And asked Mr. Puss, “ What’s this horrible din?'
Says Puss to our Ponto, “ I’ve caught this sly thief.
And now I intend to bring her to grief.”
Bays Ponto to Puss, “ The mouse is my friend.
And if you would hurt her, why I must defend
That nice little, kind little, good little mouse,
As long as she ever remains in this house."
Bays Pussy to Ponto, “ I pray you don’t fret,
I’ll love and I’ll cherish your poor little pet,
She shall sleep on the mat, and we’ll find her in food.
Because she is nice and because she is good."
Bo the nice little mouse, the dog and the cat,
All three ate together, and slept on the mat;
They sung, danc’d, and romp’d with joy and merry laughter
And as the old tale says, “ Lived happy ever after.”


HISTORY OF
MR. TOM PUSS
AND THE RATS.
d, A> c/VfT 1
Mrs. Puss stayed at
home, minded and played
with young Master John
Puss, Miss Mary Puss,
and Baby Puss, while
Mr. Puss went out to
get them something to
eat. He went into a
barn, tied a piece of
cheese to the tip of his
tail, and put it through
a hole in a door, think-
ing that he would catch
a rat that way. Some
very knowing rats on the
other side of the door got
a piece of string, tied it
to his tail, pulled all to-
gether, and made Mr.
Puss me-ow very loud,
and he found that in-
stead of his catching a
rat the rats had caught
him. Mrs. Puss finding
that Mr. Pass did not
come home, put little
John Puss and Mary
Puss to bed without any
supper, and then sang
little deaf Baby Puss off
to sleep by means of the
ear trumpet. The rats
ate their supper off Mr.
Puss’s tail, and then let
him go. You see what
a fine long tail he had
when he put it through
the hole to catch rats in
that foolish manner;
and look at his short
tail now, in the corner
of the page.
WASN'T HE A FOOLISH
PUSS!!!


PUSS IN BOOTS.
Once upon a time there was a miller who had
three sons. When he was dying he left each
of them a legacy. To his eldest son he left, his
mill; to the second his ass; and to the youngest
his cat. The poor boy was very sad when he
found that he had nothing belonging to him
but a cat ; but, to his great surprise, puss
jumped on the table, and said in a friendly
manner: “Do not be sad, my dear master,
only buy me a pair of boots and a bag, and I will
provide for you and myself.” So the miller’s
son, who had a shilling or two in his pocket,
bought a smart little pair of boots and a hag.
and gave them to puss, who put some bran and
sow-thistles into his bag, opened the mouth of
it. and lay down in a rabbit warren. A foolish
young rabbit jumped into it ; puss drew the
string, and soon killed it. He went immediately
to the palace with it. He found the king
and queen sitting on their throne, and, bowing
low, he laid the rabbit at the king’s feet,
saying : “ Please, your majesty, my master,
the Marquis de Carabas, has sent you a rabbit
from his warren, as a mark of respect.”
“ 1 am much obliged to the Marquis,” said
the king, and he ordered the rabbit to be
taken to the cook, and a piece of money to
be given to the cat.
During two or three months the cat con-
tinued to carry game every now and then to
the king, which was supposed to be the
produce of his master’s sport. One day
when he happened to hear the king was
going to take a drive on the banks of the
river, in company with his daughter, who
was the most beautiful princess in the world,
puss desired his master to go and bathe in
the river at the spot that he should point
out, and leave the rest to him. The Marquis
of Carabas did as his cat advised him. Just
as he was bathing the king came past, when
the cat bawled out as loud as he could—
“ Help 1 help I or the Marquis of Carabas
will be drowned!” On hearing this, the king
looked out of the carriage window, and
recognising the cat, ordered his body-
guards to fly to the assistance of my Lord
Marquis of Carabas. As the poor Marquis
was being fished out of the river, the cat in-
formed his majesty that, while his master
was bathing, some robbers had stolen his
clothes. The king immediately ordered the
gentlemen of his wardrobe to go and fetch
one of his most sumptuous dresses. No sooner
had this been done and the Marquis suitably
attired, than he looked to such advantage
that the king took him to be a very fine
gentleman; while the princess was so struck
with his appearance, that at once she be-
came over head and ears in love with him.
The kin" insisted that the Marquis should get
into the carriage. The cat, highly delighted at
the turn things were taking, now ran on before,
and having reached a meadow where there were
some peai-ants, he thus accosted them ; “ I say,
good folks, if you do not tell the king that this
field belongs to the Marquis of Carabas. you shall
all be chopped as fine as mince-meat,” The king
did not fail to inquire of the peasants to whom
the meadow belonged? “To the Marquis of
Carabas, please your majesty,” said they in a
breath.
And the cat kept running on before the
carriage, and repeating the same instructions
to all the labourers he met with, so that the king
was astonished at the vast possessions of the
Marquis of Carabas.
At length the cat reached a magnificent castle
belonging to a giant, who was immensely rich.
The cat having inquired what sort of a person the
giant might be, and what he was able to do. sent
in a message to request leave to speak with him.
The giant received him civilly. “ I have been
told,” said the cat, “ that you have the power
of transforming yourself into all sorts of animals.”
M So I have,” replied the giant, “ and to prove
the truth of what I say you shall see me become a lion.
When the cat beheld a lion standing before him, and
saw the monster quietly light his pipe, he was seized
with such a panic that he clambered up to the roof.
After a time, the cat perceiving that the giant had
returned to his natural shape, came down again.
“ And do you possess the power of assuming the shape
of the smallest animals likewise f ” “ You shall see ;”
and the giant immediately assumed the shape of a mouse,
when the cat pounced upon him and ate him up.
By this time the king had reached the gates of the
(Jiant’s magnificent castle, and expressed a wish to
enter so splendid a building. The cat ran out to meet
the king, saying—“ Your majesty is welcome to the
Marquis of Carabas’s castle.”
The king was so delighted with the Marquis of
Carabas, that he accepted him as his son-in-law, and
that very same day he was married to the princess.
The cat became a great Lord, and ever after hunted
mice only for his own amusement.
MONKEY AND THE CATS.
Two hungry cats, having stolen some cheese, could
not agree between themselves how to divide their
booty ; therefore they went to law, and a cunning
monkey was to decide their case.
“Let us see,” said the judge (with as arch a look as
could be); “ay, ay, this slice truly outweighs the
otherand with this he bit off a large piece, in
order, as he told them, to make a fair balance.
The other scale had now become too heavy, which
gave this upright judge a pretence to make free with
a second mouthful.
“ Hold, hold ?” cried the two cats ; give each of us
our share of what is left, and we will be content.
“ If you are content," said the monkey, “ justice is
not ; the law, my friends, must have its course.”
Upon this he nibbled first one piece and then the
other, till the poor cats, seeing their cheese in a fair
way to be all eaten up, most humbly begged him not
to put himself to any further trouble, to give them
what still remained
“ Hal ha I ha I not so fast, I beseech you, good
ladies,” said the monkey ; “ we owe justice to our-
selves as well as to you : and what remains is due to me
as the lawyer.” Upon this, he crammed the whole into his
mouth at once, and very gravely broke up the court.
This fable teaches us that it is better to put up with
a trifling loss, than to run the risk of losing all we
have by going to Law.
DICK WHITTINGTON and Ms CAT,
There was once a Lord Mayor of London,
whose name was Sir Richard Whittington. He
rose to that office from being a poor orphan,
living in a distant village. Dick was a sharp
boy. and was always picking up knowledge
from some of the villagers. Dick heard of the
great City of Loudon ; he often heard it said
that the streets were paved all over with gold.
One day seeing a waggon and team of horses
on the road to London ; he took courage and
asked the waggoner to let him walk by his
side. Having gained permission, they set off
together. When Dick got to London he was
very eager to see the fine streets paved all ovei
with gold, but the poor boy saw nothing but
dirt instead of gold, so he crouched down at
the door of one Mr. Fitzwarren, a great
merchant. Here he was soon found by an ill-
tempered cook, who ordered him to go about
his business. But just at this moment Mr.
Fitzwarren himself came home, and finding
that the poor boy was willing to work, he took
him into his house, and said that he should
be kept to do what dirty work he was able
for the cook. The cook was always scolding
him from morning till night, and was very
cruel to him. Poor Dick had another hard-
ship. His bed was placed in a garret where
there were great numbers of rats and mice,
which ran over his face, and made a great
noise. Dick at last bought a cat which was
famous for being an excellent mouser.
Soon after this, the merchant, who had a
ship ready to sail, his servants if they
would send any goods abroad. All the
servants mentioned something they were
willing to venture but poor Whittington, who
said he had nothing but a cat, which was
his companion.
“Fetch thy cat, boy,” said Mr. Fitzwarren,
“and let her go.” Dick hesitated for some
time ; at last he brought poor Puss, and
delivered her to the captain with tears in
his eyes. The cook continued to be so cruel
to him that the unhappy fellow determined
to leave his place. He accordingly packed
up his few things, and travelled as far as
Holloway, and there sat down on a stone.
While he was there musing, Bow-bells
began to ring ; and it seemed to him that
their sound said :
“ Turn again , Whittington,
Lord Mayor of London."
So back went Dick, and got into the house
before the cook came down stairs.
The ship with Dick’s cat on board
happened to be driven by contrary winds
on a part of the coast of Barbary, inhabited
bv Moors, who showed great eagerness to
purchase the things with which the ship
was laden- The captain seeing this, took
patterns of the choicest articles he had to the
King of the Moors. While he was showing
them to him, dinner was brought in, and at once
lots of rats and mice came and ate up all the
dainties. The captain was astonished when the
King told him thisoften happened. The captain
rushed off at once to the ship, and brought Puss
to the palace. The second dinner had been
brought in, and, as usual, in came the rats and
mice ; Pussy at sight of them sprang out of the
captain’s arms and killed lots of them, and
the rest ran off to their holes. The King was
greatly pleased with the wonderful Puss, and
gave two sackfuls of gold for the cat, and the
captain at once sailed for London, When Mr.
Fitzwarren heard the news, he ordered Dick
Whittington to be called, and showed him all
the riches which the captain had brought in
exchange for his cat. Dick now was a rich man,
and soon after married the merchant’s daughter,
at the very church whose bells seemed to call
him back to London. He grew richer and
richer, became Sheriff, and at length
Lord Mayor of London.

The Whit© Kitten.
My little white kitten'i
Asleep on my knee ;
As white as the snow
Or the lily is she :
She wakes up with a purr
When I stroke her soft fur:
Was there ever another
White kitten like her ?
My little white kitten
Now wants to go out
And frolic, with no one
To watch her about:
*' Little kitten,” I say,
'•Just an hour you may stay;
And be careful in choosing
Your places to play ”
But night has come down,
And I hear a loud "mew; "
1 open the door, and my
Kitten comes through ;
My white kitten ! ah me!
Oh ! can it be she—
This sad-looking beggar-like
Cat that I see?
What ugly gray marks
On her side and her back !
Her nose, once as pink
As a rosebud, is black !
Oh ! I very well know,
Though she does not say so.
She has been where white
kittens
Ought never to go
If little good children
Would wish to do right,
If little white kittens
Would keep themselves white.
It is needful that they
In their houses should stay,
Or be careful in choosing
Their places to play.
Kitty.
Pretty little Kitty
Sat upon a stile,
Sang a little ditty
To herself the while,
Watching how the spar-
rows—
Seeking grain to eat—
Dart about like arrows
In among the wheat.
Pretty little Kitty
Liked the birds to see!
Thought it was a pity
They were wild and free
So she stopped her sing-
ing—
Left the stile forlorn ;
And went gaily springing
In among the corn.
Pretty little Kitty
Fond of country things.
Cares not for the city
Where no birdie sings
Our Jacko, our Jessie, our Jemmy.

Little Pussy.
I love little Pussy,
Her coat is so warm ;
And if I don’t tease her,
She’ll do me no harm
I’ll not pull her tail,
Nor drive her away,
But Pussy and I
Very gently will play.
She’ll be gentle with me,
If I’m gentle with her,
And if I speak kindly,
1 know she will purr.
She shall sit by my side,
And I’ll give her some food
And Pussy will love me
Because I am good.
It’s true, if I tease her,
Her claws she will show.
But Pussy knows well
That I never do so
Puss and the Crab.
“ I wonder,” says puss,
" If a thing like that
Would presume to bite
A respectable cat ?
Tis the queerest thing
That ever I saw ;
I’ll hit it a slap
With my strong forepaw
No! No I On the whole
I had better not;
But what curious claws
The creature has got I
I'll just step up
And quietly ask it
How it got out
Of that market-basket
I'll play with the animal,
Just to see
If it wants to do
Any harm to me.
No! I think I had better
Get out of its way,
And I surely am safer
Not even to play.
For I’ll get into trouble.
And horribly wail,
If that thing with
Takes a grip on my tail.’’

Puss In the Corner.
You are a naughty pussy-cat ;
I think it right to mention that
For all who see your picture here -
'Twas you who broke my bunny dear
An hour ago, as you can tell,
I left him here, alive and well;
And now he’s dead, and, what is mote
You’ve broke his leg, I’m pretty sure
For you, my puss, I’ll never care,
No—never, never, never —there 1
And you are in disgrace, you know,
And in the corner you must go.
What, crying? Then I must cry too,
And I can’t bear to punish you;
Perhaps my bunny isn’t dead,
Perhaps you’ve only stunned his head
And though I’m sure youbroke hisleg.
It may be mended with a peg ;
And though he’s very, very funny.
My bunny’s not a real bunny ;
And I’ll forgive and tell you that
You are my precious pussy-cat.

Tabby.
Tabby was a kitten,
Tabby was a thief.
Tabby tried to steal the cream,
And so she came to grief.
Jumping on the table,
(Nobody was nigh,)
On the pretty cream-jug
Tabby cast her eye :
Wondered what was in it;
Thought she’d like to see ;
Crept a little nearer,
Slyly as could be.
Cream was very low down:
Jug was very high ;
"Must have some,” said Ta K by
" Even if I die ! ”
Then into the cream-jug
Popped her naughty nose ;
Just what happened after,
Only Tabby knows.
This is how we found her,
Naughty little cat!
Did she get a whipping,
Think you, after that ?
Tabby was a kitten,
Tabby was a thief,
Tabby tried to steal the cream
And so she came to grief
Old Puss.
Don't hurt the poor old cat,
There can be no fun in that ;
And it would be cruel too —
She never tried to injure you
She, for years, has kept the house
Free from thievish rat and mouse;
Puss has always faithful been,
And has kept herself so clean
True, she now is getting old,
Though she once was strong and
bold;
At her prey she cannot leap,
And, if caught, can scarcely keep
Poor old puss ! 'Twould be a shame
Thee for uselessness to blame ;
When thou canst not active b«

’Twas no use for poor puss to speak,
Or offer to deny him,
The monkey had her in his grasp,
And she could not defy him.
So he began to laugh and chat,
And show a few grimaces ;
Ob 1 if you had but seen, like me,
The contrast of their faces.
He put some nuts into her paw,
And he the fire approaches,
As if a salamander she,
Or made of young cockroaches.
The poor cat now began to squall,
Her face the fire attacking ;
And sadly, too, her paw was burnt,
The while the nuts were cracking
The monkey having feasted well
Began to snarl and grumble,
That he should be so taken in
With nuts he scarce could mumble.
“Dear me,” he said, “how they are burnt,"
And at poor pussy looking,
“ I cannot think how I could bear
Such miserable cooking.
And what a fuss you make about
A little bit of warming ;
I’ve often done the thing myself—
There’s nothing so alarming.
Now take this for yourself,” he said,
“And next time be less squalling : ”
Then gave the cat a hearty cuff,
Which sent the poor thing sprawling.
“Now let me give you this advice,
For I am one of letters :
Leave off that rude, obstreperous way,
When you are with your betters.
And think yourself well off,” he said,
“ That I had mercy on you ;
For many would have sent you home
Without a dress upon you.”
The Dead Kitten.
Don’t talk to me of parties, Nan;
I really cannot go;
When folks are in affliction
They don't go out, you know.
I have a new brown sash, too;
It seems a pity—eh?
That such a dreadful trial
Should have come just yesterday!
The play-house blinds arc all pulled
down
As dark as it can be;
It looks so very solemn
And so proper, don’t you see?
And I have a piece of crape
Pinned on my dolly’s hat,
Tom says it is ridiculous
For only just a cat.
But boys are all so horridl
They always, every one,
Delight in teazing little girls
And kitties, “just for fun."
The way he used to pull her tail—
It makes me angry now—
And scat her up the cherry t ree.
To make the darling “ meowl”
I’ve had her all the summer.
One day, away last spring,
I heard a frightful barking.
And 1 saw the little thing
In the corner of a fence;
’T would have mad you laugh out-
right
To see how every hair stood out,
And how she tried to fight.
I shooed the dog away.
And she jumped upon my arm;
The pretty creature knew
I would n’t do her any harm;
I hugged her close, and carried her
To mamma, and she said
She should be my own wee kitty,
If I’d see that she was fed.
A cunning little dot she was,
With silky, soft, grey fur;
She’d lie for hours on my lap,
And I could hear her purr;
And then she’d frolic after
When I pulled a string about,
Or try to catch her tail,
Or roll a marble in and out.
Such comfort she has been to me
I’m sure no one could tell,
Unless some other little girl
Who loves her pussy well.
I’ve heard about a Maltese cross;
But my dear little kit
Was always sweet and amiable,
And never cross a bit!
But oh, last week I missed her!
I hunted all around;
My darling little pussy-cat
Was nowhere to be found,
I knelt and whispered softly,
When nobody could see:
“ Take care of little kitty, please.
And bring her back to me.”
I found her lying yesterday
Behind the lower shed;
1 thought my heart was broken
When I found that she was dead.
Tom promised me another one;
But even he can see
No other kitty ever will be
Just the same to me.
I can’t go to your party, Nannie.
Maccaroons, you say?
And ice-cream? I know
1 ought to try and not give way;
And I feel it would be doing wrong
To disappoint you so.
Well, if I’m equal to it
By to-morrow, I may go!

The Monkey and the
Nuts.
A monkey, being fond of nuts,
Thought he would have some roasted ;
But how was he to get them done,
Not liking to be toasted ?
A poor young cat was passing by,
And innocently watches ;
The wicked monkey saw her stop,
And at his victim snatches.
’’ Dear pussy, you are just the one
That I’ve been looking out for ;
How beautiful you look to-day,
But tell me what you pout for I
Upon my word I long have had
For you a fond affection ;
Now you shall stay and dine with me,
Or t.ak* doiri. slight refection."

My own Puss.
1 wish you could just see my cat ;
She's a darling, there’s no doubt of
that:
So soft, and so sleek, and so fat
Her eyes are a beautiful green,
The brightest that ever were seen ;
Of cats she is truly the queen
She loves to lie stretched in the sun
But as soon as my lessons are done,
She is ready for frolic and fun
My kitty has two sets of claws,
Tucked away in those velvety paws :
She can use them, too, when there is
cause.
I cannot think what I should do,
If, my pussy, I ever lost you :
We’re so happy together, we two I
I call her my bundle of fur ;
Hark I now she’s beginning to purr:
Kit loves me, and oh, I love her I
The Frolicsome Kitten.
Dear kitten, do lie still, I say,
How much I want you to be quiet,
Instead of scampering away,
And always making such a riot.
There, only seel you’ve torn my
frock,
And poor mamma must put a
patch in;
I’ll give you a right earnest knock,
To cure you of this trick of
scratching.
Nay, do not scold your little cat,
She does not know what ’tis
you’re saying;
And every time you give a pat,
She thinks you mean it all for
playing.
But if your pussy understood
The lesson that you want to teach
her.
And did not choose to be so good,
She’d be, indeed, a naughty
creature.
Putting Kitty to Bed.
Kitty, Kitty, go to sleep,
Shut your eyes, and don’t you peep.
Sing with me your little song,
We will not make it very long
Hurry Kitty for to see
mamma soon will come for me,
And 1 must see you safe in bed
All covered up except your head
And while I rock you in my chair,
You must purr your little prayer.
Altho’ you say it soft and low,
’Twill all be just the same you
know.
Mamma makes me bend ray knee,
But Kitty dear, you can’t, you see,
For you’re too little yet to try —
Seel I’m so big, and tall, and high
And then you can't say any words,
No more than chicks, or little
birds,
But I have heard the Bible tell
That even birds are cared for well

T <> PARENTS AND SCHOOLMASTERS.
I have been blamed for printing and distributing "Mother Hubbard " My answer is;—"Old Mother Hubbard" has done more towards the educa-
tion of young children than perhaps any piece of reading in existence Amongst the hundred millions of English speaking people in all parts of the
earth, there arc very few but can repeat a part or the whole of "Mother Hubbard," and I have seen it somewhere asserted that it is to be found in
almost eyery home in the civilized world Its rude style of poetry tells nothing against it. The child knows nothing of correct metre: as long as there
ii a jingling rhyme it is satisfied The dog is the domestic animal in millions of families, and in numberless cases is actually a more loved companion
than brothers and sisters A simple rhyme, therefore, about this attached, playful, and constant companion is sure to fascinate the young, and it has
fascinated more than a thousand millions of the little dears I firmly believe that it would produce grand results if a pretty illustrated edition of the
principal nursery rhymes were made a text-book in infant schools You may try, and try, and try again, to drive an ordinary dry school-book lesson
into the mind, and make very little progress it is up-hill work But take an illustrated edition of a nursery rhyme, say the "Death of Cock
Robin, or Mother Hubbard," and call the little one to you, begin to teach it how eagerly, how intently does it begin to learn now I What animation
in t.s little eyes ! W hat music in its little, joyous, interested voice ! It learns this lesson ten times as fast as the other one, and gives you ten times the
pleasure in teaching it and this kind of teaching gradually and insensibly leads the child into a love of learning: it interests and sets the young inquiring
Dind at W e all know how much easier it is to do a work we are interested in than a work we are not It is just so with the child, and for that
reason I would commence to teach the infant mind with th?i which pleased it best, and so gradually create a love for reading For years I have
allowed numbers of little children, of their own accord, to stand and read nursery rhyme* to themselves, and to each other, and youths to road interesting
and •structiye fiction, gratis, in the Book Arcade; and I hold that, by its enticingly creating a love for reading, which will lewd to something higher,
is one of the beat and Boat effective schools in the country — W. COLE.

Who devoured that Old Man of Leghorn.

The mistress snored loud as a pig ;
Jack took up his fiddle by doggy's desire,
And struck up a bit of a jig.

And some in velvet gown.

I had a little dog, and his name was

I gave him some work, and he did it
very well ;
I sent him up stairs to pick up a pin,
He stepped into the coal-scuttle up to
the chin ;
I sent him to the garden to pick some
sage,
He tumbled down and fell in a rage ;
I sent him to the cellar to draw a pot
of beer,
He came up again and said there was
none there.

But stroke and pat his head ;

I like to see him fed.

And very useful too.

What he is bid to do ?
Then I will never hurt my dog,
Nor ever give him pain ;
But treat him kindly every day,
And he’ll love me again.
Puss and Rover,
Our Pussy she is white,
Our Rover he is black,
And yet he licks the Pussy’s face
While she stands on his back.
Our Pussy she is little,
Our Rover he is big,
And yet he likes the Pussy
Much better than the pig.
Our Pussy she is young,
And Rover he is old,
And yet he likes the Pussy
More than tons of gold.
Our Pussy she is good.
And so is Rover too,
So Pussy says, “Ta, ta.” “Good-bye,”
And Rover says “Adieu.”

No Breakfast for Growler,
No, naughty Growler, get away,
You shall not have a bit;
Now when I speak, how dare you stay ?
I can’t spare any, Sir, I say,
And so you need not sit.
Poor Growler ! do not make him go,
But recollect, before,
That he has never served you so,
For you have given him many a blow,
That patiently he bore.
Poor Growler I if lie could but speak,
He’d tell (as well he might)
How he would bear with many a freak,
And wag his tail, and look so meek,
And neither bark nor bite.
Upon his back he lets you ride,
All round and round the yard ;
And now, while sitting by your side,
To have a bit of bread denied,
Is really very hard.
And all your little tricks he’ll bear,
And never seem to mind ;
And yet you say you cannot spare
One bit of breakfast for his share,
Although he is so kind.

Good dog to run so fast,
To meet my sister May and me,
Now school is o’er at last.
Oh ! how I love you, Tray,
You are so kind to me ;
You run beside me in my walks,
You sit by me at tea.
’Tis true that I give you bits
Of cake and bread and meat ;
But I am sure you’d love as well
If you had nought to eat.
For faithful, true, and kind
Is our old darling Tray ;
He guards our dwelling all the night,
And plays with us by day.
Doggy minds the House.
“Come hither, little puppy dog,
I’ll give you a nice new collar.
If you will learn to read your book
And be a clever scholar.”
“No, no I” replied the puppy dog,
“I’ve other fish to fry,
For I must learn to guard your house,
And bark when thieves come nigh.”


GOAT LAND.
(VGrady’s Goat.
O’Grady lived in shanty row,
The neighbours often said
They wished that Tim would move
away
Or that his goat was dead.
He kept the neighbourhood in fear,
And the children always vexed ;
They couldn’t tell jist whin or where
The goat would pop up nexht.
Ould Missis Casey stood wan day

Will S. Hats.
The Ooat and the Swing.
A little story with a moral
For young folks who are prone to
quarrel.
Old folks are wise, and do not need it,
Of course they, therefore, will not
read it.
A vicious goat, one day, had found
His way into forbidden ground
When coming to the garden swing,
He spied a most prodigious thing,—
A ram, a monster, to his mind,
With head before and head behind 1
Its shape was odd—no hoofs were seen,
But, without legs, it stood between
Two uprights, lofty posts of oak,
With forehead ready fora stroke
Though but a harmless ornament
Carved on the seat, it seemed intent
On barring the intruder’s way ;
While he, advancing, seemed to say,
“ Who is this surly fellow here,
Two heads, no tail—it’s mighty queer!
A most insulting countenance I”
With stamp of foot and angry glance
He curbed his threatening neck and
stood
Before the passive thing of wood.
“ You winked as 1 was going by I
You did not ? What 1 tell me I lie 1
Take that !” And at the swing he
sprung.
A sounding thump 1 It backward
swung,
And set in motion by the blow,
Swayed menacingly to and fro.
“Ha 1 you will fight ? A quarrelsome
chap,
I knew you were 1 You’ll get a rap I
I’ll crack your skull 1” A headlong
jump ;
Another and a louder bump I
The swing, as if with kindling wrath,
Came rushing back along the path.
The goat, astonished, shook his head.
Winked hard, turned round, grew
mad, and said,
“ Villain ! I’ll teach you who T ami”
(Or seemed to say.)—“you rascal ram.
To pick a fight with me, when I
So quietly am passing by !
Your head or mine 1” A thundering
stroke—
The cracking horns met crashing oak I
Then came a dull and muffled sound,
And something rolled along the
ground.
Got up, looked sad—appeared to say,
“ Your head’s too hard I”—and limped
away
Quite humbly, in a rumpled coat—
A dustier and a wiser goat I

MONKEY LAND.
A Fruitless Sorrow.
A little monkey,
Dusky, ugly, sad,
Sat hopeless, curled
Within his narrow cage ;
Dark was the stifling room,
No joy he had ;
The sick air rang
With tones of pain and rage.
From many a prisoned
Creature held for sale,
Stolen from the happy
Freedom of its life :
Dull drooping birds,
That uttered shriek and w’ail.
And beast and reptile
Full of wue and strife.
Into the place
A cheerful presence came,
And kind eyes lighted
On the monkey small ;
Straightway the weary
World was not the same
Such fortune did
The little thing befall
Safe in a basket
Fastened, he was sent
Across the city,
Trembling and afraid.
But, once in his new home,
What sweet content
Was his, while petted
And caressed, he played.
A week of bliss,
Alas I that it should end I
He had forgotten
Darkness, pain, and all;
But there were monkeys
Finer than our friend,
His master’s eyes
On such a one must fall I
So fate had ordered,
And the frisky sprite,
Dun-coloured, grey,
And streaked with cinnamon.
Born in far bright Brazil,
Was bought at sight,
And all the first
Poor pet’s fortune won.
They brought into
The bright and cheerful room
The basket small
In which he had been borne
To such a happy life.
He saw h's doom
At once, the misery
Of his lot forlorn.
The moment that
The basket tm t his sight.
He dropped his head.
And hid his sorrowing eye*
Against his arm,
Nor looked to left nor rigt t.
As any thinking
Human creature wise
They took him back
I nto his noisome d. n,
His tiny face
Concealed as if he w ept,
So helpless to resist.
Heroic men
Might such despairing
Patient calm have kept.
Poor little thing I
And if he lingers yet,
Or death has ended
Life so hard to bear
I know not ;
But I never can ?oig;t
His brief rej- ci
And his mute lr-p«ir.
MEDDLESOME JACKO.
The Adventures of meddle-
some “Jacko.”
These pictures we hope
Will our little folks please,
A ad also to each one
This moral convey :
“ Be contented and happy,
Whatevi r your lot,
And don’t try, as some do,
To have your own way."
Master Jacko, you see,
Had a very snug home,
With plenty to eat
That was wholesome and good j
But still he did not.
We are sorry to say,
Behave in a way
That a pet monkey should
For one day he said,
“ Come, I don’t like at all
The life that 1 lead,
And I cannot see why
1 should not live just
As my own master does ;
This chain is not strong.
Can 1 break it? I’ll try.”
After some little time
Jacko snapped it in two j
Said he to himself,
“ Well, now where shall 1 go 1
To the larder, 1 think ;
For my appetite’s good,
And I’m sure to find
Something to eat there, I know ”
He entered, and as he
Was looking about
A lobster just brought
From the shop seized his tail,
And pinched him an 1 nippe 1 him.
Until our young friend
Jumped a l xiut, and •-t sp
A Moat piteous vad.
Next he went to the kitchen,
And there he espied
A bottle of something—
“ Ha, ha, 1 must taste !”
But he found it was curry,
W r hich burnt his poor throat,
So he let drop the bottle,
And he ran off in baste.
To the dining-room then
He repaired, and he said,
“ Into master’s tea-pot
The hot water I’ll pour ;"
But he upset the kettle,
And scalded himself.
And loudly screamed out
As he rolled on the floor.
Quoth Jacko, “ the house
Doesn’t suit me at all,
I had better go back
To the garden again,
Aud gather some peaches,
Or grapes, or some plums,
And try to forget
All my trouble and pain.”
In the corner the rogue
Saw a bee-hive—“ Why, here
Must be honey I Delicious 1 ”
Said he* “just the thing ! ”
So he put in his hand,
But he brought out the bees,
And they punished poor Jacko
With many a sting.
Pinched, scalded, and stung,
To his home he returned.
Reasoned he, “ My past folly
I shall not regret ;
For I’m sure the misfortunes
Pre gone through to-day
Have taught m« a lesson
I aa’ar shall
OUR OWN JACKO.


GEE GEE LAND.
The Horse.
The horse, the brave,
The gallant Horse—
Fit theme for the minstrel’s songl
He hath good claim
To praise and fame ;
As the fleet, the kind, the strong.
Behold him free
In his native strength,
Looking fit for the sun-god s car
With a skin as sleek
As a maiden’s cheek,
And an eye like a Polar star
Trno wonders not
Such limbs can deign
To brook the fettering girth ;
As we see him fly
The ringing plain,
And paw the crumbling earth ?
His nostrils are wide
With snorting pride,
His fiery veins expand ;
And yet he’ll be led
With a silken thread,
Or soothed by an infant’s hand.
He owns the lion’s
Spirit and might,
But the voice he has learnt to love
Needs only be heard,
And he’ll turn to the word,
is gentle as a dove.
The Arab is wise
Who learns to prize
His barb before all gold ;
But is his barb
More fair »han ours,
More generous, fast or bold t
A song for the steed,
The gallant steed—
Oh I grant him a leaf of bay ;
For we owe much more
To his strength and speed.
Than man can ever repay.
Whatever his place—
The yoke, the chase,
The war-field, road, or course.
One of Creation’s
Brightest and best
I* Horse, the aoble Horse I
■i.»s
The Wonderful Horse,
I’ve a tale to relate,
Such a wonderful tale
That really I fear
My description must fail ;
’Tis about a fine horse
Who had powers so amazing,
He lived without eating,
Or drinking, or grazing ;
In fact this fine horse
Was so “ awfully ” clever,
That left to himself
He’d have lived on for ever.
He stood in a room.
With his nose in the air,
And his wide staring eyes
Looking no one knows where,
His tail undisturbed
By the sting of a fly
One foot slightly raised
As if kicking he’d try,
This wonderful horse
Never slept or yet dozed,
At least if he did so,
His eyes never closed.
“ Come, gee up, old Dobbin,
Look sharp, don’t you see
I want to be there
And get back before tea f”
But this obstinate horse
Never offered to prance,
Or made an attempt
At the slightest advance ;
Harry slashed him so hard.
That he slashed off one ear,
Then his mane tumbled off,
And poor Dobbin looked queer.
With spur, and with whip,
And with terrible blows,
He soon was deprived
Of one eye, and his nose,
While his slightly-raised foot
Found a place on the floor.
The tail once so handsome
Was handsome no more,
And Harry, the tears
Raining down as he stood,
Cried, “ Bother the horse,
It is •ot.h:ng bat vuod I"
Good Dobbin.
Oh I thank you, good Dobbin,
You’ve been a long track,
And have carried papa
All the way on your back ;
You shall have some nice oats,
Faithful Dobbin, indeed.
For you’ve brought papa home
To his darling with speed.
The howling wind blew.
And the pelting rain beat,
And the thick mud has covered
His legs and his feet,
But yet on he galloped
In spite of the rain,
And has brought papa home.
To his darling again.
The sun it was setting
A long while ago.
And papa could not see
The road where he should go,
But Dobbin kept on
Through the desolate wild,
And has brought papa home
Again safe to his child.
Now go to the stable,
The n>ght is so raw,
Go, Dobbin, and rest
Your old bones on the straw :
Don’t stand any longer
Out here in the rain,
For you've brought papa home
To his darling again.
A Horse’s Petition to his
Master.
Up the hill, whip me not ;
Down the hill, hurry me not ;
In the stable, forget me not ;
Of hay and corn, rob me not;
Of clean water, stint me not ;
With sponge and brush, neglect me
not;
Of soft, dry bed, deprive me not ;
If sick or cold, chill me not;
With bit and reins, oh I jerk me not ;
And when you are angry, strike me
not.
MANE MEASURES 14-fest, AND TAIL 11-fest
The Pony.
Oh, Brownie, our pony,
A gallant young steed,
Will carry us gaily
O’er hill, dale, and mead
So sure is his foot,
And so steady his eye,
That even our baby
To mount him might try.
We haste to his stable
To see him each day,
And feed him with oats
And the sweetest of hay
We pat his rough coat,
And we deck him with flowers.
Oh, never was seen
Such a pony as ours
The Horse.
No one deserves to have a horse
Who takes delight to beat him :
The wise will choose a better course.
And very kindly treat him.
If ever it should be my lot—
To have, for use or pleasure,
One who could safely walk or trot.
The horse would be a treasure.
He soon would learn my voice to know
And I would gladly lead him ,
And should he to the stable go.
I’d keep him clean and feed him
I’d teach my horse a steady pace,
Because, if he should stumble
Upon a rough or stony place,
We both might have a tumble
Should he grow aged, I would still
My poor old servant cherish ;
I could not see him weak or ill.
And leave my horse to perish.
For should he get too weak to be
My servant any longer,
I’ll send him out to grass quite free,
And get another stronger.


Work-Horses in a Park on
Sunday.
Tis Sabbath-day, the poor man walks
Blithe from his cottage door.
And to his prattling young ones talks
As they skip on before.
The father is a man of joy,
From his week’s toil released ;
And jocund is each little boy
To see his father pleased.
But, looking to a field at hand,
Where the grass grows rich and high,
A no less merry Sabbath band
Of horses my eye.
Poor skinny beasts I that go all week
With loads of earth and stones.
Bearing, with aspect dull and meek.
Hard work and cudgel’d bones ;
But now let loose to roam athwart
The farmer’s clover-lea,
With whisking tails, and jump and
snort,
They speak a clumsy glee.
Lolling across each other’s necks,
Some look like brothers dear ;
Others are full of flings and kicks—
Antics uncouth and queer.
Superannuated Horse to his
Master who has sentenced
him to die.
And hast thou scaled my doom, sweet
master, say J
And wilt thou kill thy servant'old and
poor f
A little longer let me live, I pray ;
A little longer hobble round the door ;
For much it glads me to behoid this
place
And house me in this hospitable shed ;
It glads me more to see my mastei s face,
And linger on the spot where I was
bred.
For oh I to think of what we have enjoyed,
In my life’s prime, e’er I was old and
poor 1
Then from the jocund morn to eve em-
ployed
My gracious master on my back I bore.
Thrice ten years have danced on down
along.
Since first to thee these way-born
limbs I gave ;
Sweet smiling years I when both of us
were young—
The kindest master and the happiest
slave.
Ah 1 years sweet smiling, now for ever
flown.
Ten years, thrice told, alas I are as a
day,
Yet as together we are aged grown,
Together let us wear that age away.
And hast thou fixed my doom, sweet
master, say 1
And wilt thou kill thy servant old and
poor 7
A little longer let me live, I pray ;
A little longer hobble round thy door.
But oh 1 Kind Nature take thy victim’s
life I
And thou a servant feeble, old, and
poor ;
So shalt thou save me from the upMfted
knife,
And gently stretch me at my n-.*aier’s
door.
SCOTOHMAN CARRYING JESSIE’S PONY.
The Arab and his Horse.
Come, my beauty I come, my desert
darling I
On my shoulder lay thy glossy headl
Fear not, though the barley sack be
empty,
Here’s the half of Hassan’s scanty
bread.
Thou shalt have thy share of dates,
my beauty I
And thou knowest my water skin
is free :
Drink and welcome, for the wells are
distant,
And my strength and safety lie in
thee.
Bend thy forehead, now, to take my
kisses I
Lift in lore thy dark and splendid
eye ;
Thou art glad when Hassan mounts
the saddle —
Thou art proud he owns thee : so
am 1.
Let the Sultan bring his broadest
horses,
Prancing with their diamond-stud-
ded reins;
They, my darling, shall not match
thy fleetness,
When they course with thee the
desert plains.
We have seen Damascus, O my beauty!
And the splendour of the pachas
there ;
What’s their pomp and riches 7 why,
I would not
Take them fora handful «f thy hau.
The Cab Horse.
Pity the sorrows of a poor cab horse,
Whose jaded limbs have many a mile
to go,
Whose weary days are drawing to a close,
And but in death will he a rest e'er
know.
When the cold winds of dreary winter
rage,
And snow and hail corns down in
blinding sheet,
And people refuge seek ’neath roof or
arch,
The cab-horse stands unsheltered in the
street.
Though worn and weary with useful life,
In patient service to his master—man ;
No fair retirement waits his failing years,
He yet must do the utmost work he can.
FLs legs are stiff, his shoulders rubbed and
sore,
His knees are broken and his sight is
dim,
But no physician comes his wounds to
heal ;
The lash is all the cure that’s given him.
Ye kindly hearts that spare the whip,
and stroke
Just now and then, with kindly hand,
his mane;
Or pat his sides, or give a pleasant word,
Your tender-heartedness is not in vain.
He has not many friends to plead his
cause ;
He has not speech his own wrung, to
outpour.
Pity the sorrow* of a poor cab-horse ;
Give him reusf, and Ueav?,n will
jotu star*.
DOBBIN SATING PUSS FROM A DOG.
Q-BB GhBK IjAJSTJD.


Farmer John.
Home from his journey Farmer John
Arrived this morning safe and sound,
His black coat off, and his old clothes on
“ Now I’m myself.” says Farmer John ;
And he thinks, “ I’ll look around 1”
Up leaps the dog, “ Get down you pup I
Are you so glad you would eat me up 1"
The old cow lows at the gate, to greet
him ;
The horses prick up their ears, to meet
him,
Well, well, old Bay I
Ha, ha, old Grey I
Do you get good food when I’m away ?*’
“ You havn’t a rib I" says Farmer John ;
“ The cattle are looking round and
sleek ;
The colt is going to be a roan,
And a beauty too ; how he has grown 1
We’ll wean the calf, next week.”
Says Farmer John, “ When I’ve been off,
To call you again about the trough,
And watch you, and pet you, while you
drink
Is a greater comfort than you can think.”
And he pats old Bay
And he slaps old Grey ;
“Ah I this is the comfort of going away.”
“ For after all,” says Farmer John,
“The best of the journey ia getting
home I
I’ve seen great sights ; but would I give
This spot, and the peaceful life I live,
For all their Paris and Rome 1
These hills for the City’s stifled air,
And big hotels, all bustle and glare,
Lands all horses, and roads all stones,
That deafen your ears and batter your
bones,
Would you, old Bay 1
Would you, old Grey f
That’s what one gets by going away 1”
“ I've found out this,” says Farmer John,
“That happiness is not bought and sold,
And clutched in a life of waste and
hurry,
In nights of pleasure and days of worry,
And wealth isn’t all in gold,
Mortgage, and stocks, and ten per cent.,
But in simple ways and sweet content,
Few wants, pure hopes, and noble ends,
Some laud to till and a few good friends,
Like you, old Bay,
And you old Grey.
That's what I’ve learned by going away I”,
And a happy man is Farmer John,
Oh I a rich and happy man is he ;
He sees the peas and pumpkins growing,
The corn in tassel, and buckwheat
blowing,
And fiuit on vine and tree ;
The large kind oxen look their thanks,
As he rubs their foreheads and strokes
their flanks,
The doves light round him, and strut and
coo ;
Says Farmer John, “ I’ll take you too,
And you, old Bay,
And you, old Grey,
The next time I travel so far away.”
OLIVER HORSKS.
The Horse.
A horse, long us’d to bit and bridle,
But always much disposed to idle
Had often wished that he was able
To steal unnotic’d from the stable.
He panted from his utmost soul,
To be at nobody’s control,
Go his own pace, slower or faster,
In short, do nothing—like his master.
But yet he ne’er had got at large,
If Jack (who had him in his charge)
Had not, as many have before,
forgot to shut the stable door.
Dobbin, with expectation swelling,
Now rose to quit his present dwelling,
But first peep’d out with cautions fear,
T’ examine if the coast were clear.
At length he ventured from his station,
And with extreme self-approbation,
As if deliver’d from a load,
He gallop’d to the public road.
And here he stood awhile debating,
(Till he was almost tired of waiting,)
Which way he’d please to bend his
course,
Now there was nobody to force.
At last, uncheck’d by bit or rein,
He saunter’d down a pleasant lane,
And neigh’d forth many a jocund
song,
In triumph, as he pass’d along.
But when dark nights began t’ appear.
In vain he sought some shelter near,
And well he knew be could not bear.
To «l«*p oat ia the open air.
The grass felt very damp and raw,
Much colder than his master’s straw,
Yet on it he was forc’d to stretch,
A poor, cold, melancholy wretch.
The night was dark, the country hilly,
Poor Dobbin felt extremely chilly ;
Perhaps a feeling like remorse,
Just now might sting the truant horse.
As soon as day began to dawn,
Dobbin, with long and weary yawn,
Arose from this his sleepless night,
But in low spirits and bad plight.
“ If this ” (thought he) “ is all I get,
A bed unwholesome, cold, and w’et ;
And thus fork m about to roam,
I think I’d bet.er be at home.”
Twas long ere Dobbin could decide,
Betwixt his wishes and his pride,
Whether to live in all this danger,
Or go back sneaking to the manger.
At last his struggling pride gave way;
The thought of savoury oats and hay
To hungry stomach, was a reason
Unanswerable at this season.
So off he set, with look profound,
Right glad that he was homeward
bound :
And trotting, fast as he was able,
Soon gain’d once more his master’s
stable.
Now Dobbin after this disaster,
Never again forsook his master,
Convinc’d he’d better let him mount,
Than travel on his own account.

DONKEY LAND.
OH! WHAT A LONG DONKEY.
The Cottager’s Donkey.
No wonder the Cottager
Looks with pride
On the well-fed donkey
That stands at his side ;
For he works, and he liras
As hard as he,
And a creature more useful
There cannot be.
He knows the Cottager’s
Wife and child,
And he loves to play
With that dog so wild ;
And though sometimes
So staid and still,
He can roll in the meadow
With right good will.
He knows the road
To the market well,
Where garden vegetables
He goes to sell:
And though it is hilly,
And far, and rough,
He thinks—for a donkey,
It’s well enough.
So he trudges along,
And little he cares
How hard he works,
Or how ill he fares ;
Content when his home
Appears in sight,
If his kindly master
Smiles at night.
S. V. DODDS.
The Donkey.
Poor donkey I I’ll give him
A handful of grass j
I’m sure he’s an honest,
Though stupid, old ass.
He trots to the market
To carry the sack,
And lets me ride all the
Way home on his back ;
And only just stops
By the ditch for a minute,
To see if there’s any
Fresh grass for him in it.
’Tis true, now and then
He has got a bad trick
Of standing stock-still,
And just trying to kick :
But then, poor old fellow I
You know he can’t tell
That standing stock-still
Is not using me well ;
For it never comes into
His head, I dare say,
To do bis work first,
And then afterwards play.
No, no, my good donkey I
I’ll give you some grass,
For you know no better,
Because you’re an ass ;
But what little donkeys
Some children must look,
Who stand, very like you,
Stock-still at their book,
And waste every moment
Of time as it passes
A great deal more stupid
And aiilj tt t-w** I
The Ride.
Op and down on Neddy’s back,
Taking turns they go,
Part the time with trot so fast,
Part with pace so slow.
Little sisters side by side,
Sharing each the fun and ride.
Neddy thinks, “it can't hurt me,
But gives the children fun. you see.”
And so he lends himself that they
May h»ppy be this pleasant day.
Old Jack, the Donkey,
Old Jack was as sleek
And well looking an ass
As ever on common
Munched thistle or grass ;
And—though ’twas not gaudy,
That jacket of brown —
Was the pet of the young
And the pride of the town.
And indeed he might well
Look so comely and trim,
When his young master, Joe,
Was so gentle to him ;
For never did child
More affection beget
Than was felt by young Joe
For his four-footed pet.
Joe groomed him and fed him,
And, each market day,
Would talk to his darling
The whole of the way ;
And Jack before dawn
Would be pushing the door,
As though he would say,
“Up Joe ; slumber no more."
One day Jack was wandering
Along the roadside,
When an urchin the donkey
Maliciously eyed ;
And aiming too surely
At Jack a sharp stone,
It struck the poor beast
Just below the shin bone.
Joe soothed and caressed him,
And coaxed him until
They came to a stream
By the side of the hill;
And with the cool water
He washed the swoll'n limb,
And after this fashion
Kept talking to him :
“ Poor Jack did they pelt him—
The cowards, so sly I
I wish I’d been there.
With my stick, standing by :
It doesn't bleed now—
’Twill be well in a trice ;
There, let me just wash it—
Now isn't that nice ?”
And Jack nestled down
With his soft velvet nose,
And close as he could,
Under Joe’s ragged clothes ;
And he looked at his master,
As though he would «ay —
“ I’m sure I can never
Yuur rep*/."

The Donkey’s Song.
“ Please, Mr. Donkey, sing a song,”
A black-bird said, one day.
The don-key o pened wide his mouth,
The black bird flew a way.
The Ass.
The Ass, when treated well by man,
To please him will do all he can ;
But if his master use him ill,
He will not work, but stand stock-still,
To market he will carry peas,
And coals, or any thing you please ;
He is not over-nice with meat,
For thorns and thistles he will eat.
He drinks no water but what’s clean ;
His nose he puts not in the stream ;
His feet he does not like to wet.
But out of dirty roads will get.
Poor Donkey’s Epitaph.
Down in this ditch poor donkey lies,
Who jogg’d with many a load ;
And till the day death clos’d his eyes.
Brows’d up and down this road.
No shelter had he for his head,
Whatever winds might blow ;
A neighb'ring common was his bed,
Tho’ drest in sheets of snow.
In this green ditch he often stray’d
To nip the dainty grass ;
And friendly invitations bray’d
To some more hungry ass.
Each market-day he jogg’d aloiig
Beneath the gard’ner’s load,
And snor’d out many a donkey’, song
To friends upon the road.
A tuft of grass, a thistle green,
Or cabbage-leaf so sweet,
Were all the dainties, he was seen
For twenty years to eat.
And as for sport, the sober soul
Was such a steady Jack.
He only now and then would roll,
Heels upward, on his back.
But all his sport, and dainties too,
And labours now are o’er,
Last night so bleak a tempest blew,
He could withstand no more.
He felt his feeble limbs grow cold,
His blood was freezing slow,
And presently you might behold
Him dead upon the snow.
Poor donkey I travellers passing by,
Thy cold remains shall vk v ;
And 'twould be well if all wuo di«
To duty ware as Irus.

MOO MOO LAND.
OH MY! WHAT AN AWFUL LONG COW.
The Cow and the Ass.
Beside a green meadow,
A stream us’d to flow,
So clear one might see
The white pebbles below ;
To this cooling brook
The warm cattle would stray,
To stand in the shade.
On a hot summer’s day.
A cow, quite oppress’d
With the heat of the sun,
Came here to refresh
As she often had done,
And standing quite still,
Leaning over the stream,
Was musing, perhaps ;
Or perhaps she might dream.
But soon a brown ass,
Of respectable look
Came trotting up also,
To taste of the brook,
And to nibble a few
Of the daisies and grass.
“ How d’ye do ?” said the cow :
“ How d’ye do 1" said the ass.
“ Take a seat,” cried tfie cow,
Gently waving her band.
14 By no means, dear madam,”
6aid he, “ while you stand."
Then stooping to drink,
With a complaisant bow,
“ Ma’am, your health.” said the ass ;
" Thank you, sir,” said the cow.
When a few of these compliments
More had been pass’d,
They laid themselves down
On tne herbage at last;
And waited politely
(As gentlemen must),
The ass held his tongue,
That the cow might speak first.
Then, with a deep sigh,
She directly began,
“ Don’t yon think, Mr. Ass,
We are injured by man 1
’Tis a subject that lies
With a weight on my mind :
We certainly are much
Oppress’d by mankind.
“ Now what is the reason
(I see none at all)
That I always must go
When Suke pleases to call f
Whatever I’m doing
(’Tis certainly hard),
I’m forc’d to leave off
To b# milked in the yard.
“ I've no will of my own,
But must do as they please.
And give them my milk
To make butter and cheese ;
I’ve often a great mind
To kick down the pail,
Or give Suke a box
On the ears with my tail.”
" But, ma’am,” said the ass,
“ Not presuming to teach—
-0 dear, I beg pardon—
Pray finish your speech ;
1 thought you had finish’d,
Indeed,” said the swain,
“ Go on, and I’ll not
Interrupt you again.”
“ Why, sir, I was only
Just going to observe,
I’m resolved that these tyrant*
No longer I’ll serve ;
But leave them for ever
To do as they please,
And look somewhere else
For their butter and cheese.”
Ass waited a moment,
To see if she’d done,
And then, “ Not presuming
To teach,” he begun,
“ With submission, dear madam,
To your better wit,
I own 1 am not quite
Convinced by it yet.
“ That you’re of great service
To them is quite true,
But surely they are
Of some service to you.
Tis their pleasant meadow
In which you regale ;
They feed you in winter,
When grass and weeds fail
“ And then a warm covert
They always provide,
Dear madam, to shelter
Your delicate hide.
For my own part, I know
I receive much from man.
And for him, in return,
1 do’all 1 can.”
The cow, upon this,
Cast her eyes on the grass,
Not pleas’d at thus being
Reprov’d by an ass ;
Yet, thought she, “ I'm determined
I’ll benefit by’t,
For I really believe
That the fellow is right.”
JANE TAYLOR.
The Cow.
Come, children, listen to me now,
And jon will hear about the cow ;
You’ll find her useful, alive or dead,
Whether she’s black, or white, or red.
When milkmaids milk her morn and
night
She gives then milk so fresh and white,
And this we, little children, think
Is verj nice for us to drink.
The curdled milk thej press and
squeeze,
And so they make it into cheese ;
The cream they skim and shake in
churns.
And then it soon to butter turns.
And when she’s dead, her flesh is good,
For beef is very wholesome food,
But though ’twill make us brave and
strong,
To eat too much, you know, is wrong.
Her skin, with lime and bark together,
The tanner tans, and makes it leather,
And without that, what should we do
For soles of every boot and shoe 1
The shoemaker cuts it with his knife
And bound the tops are by his wife ;
And so they nail them to the last,
And then they stitch them tight and
fast.
The hair that grows upon her back
Is taken, whether white or black,
And mix’d with plaster, short or long.
Which makes it very firm and strong.
And, last of all. if cut with care,
Her horns make combe to comb our
hair;
And so we learn—thanks to our
teachers—
That cows are very useful creatures.
BAD BOTH PAINTING A POOR WHITE COW.


The Cowboy’s Song.
“ Mooly cow, mooly cow,
Home from the wood
They sent me to fetch you
As fast as I could.
The sun has gone down— _
It is time to go home,
Mooly cow, mooly cow,
Why don’t you come !
Your udders are full,
And the milkmaid is there,
And the children all waiting,
Their suppers to share.
1 have let the long bars down—
Why don’t you pass thro’ ?”
The mooly cow only said, “Uoo-o-o I”
“ Mooly cow, mooly cow,
Have you not been
Regaling all day
Where the pastures are green f
No doubt it was pleasant,
Dear Mooly, to see
The clear running brook
And the wide-spreading tree,
The clover to crop,
And the streamlet to wade,
To drink the cool water
And lie in the shade ;
But now it is night—
They are waiting for yon."
The mooly cow only said, “ Moo-o-o I”
“ Mooly cow, mooly cow,
Where do you go
When all the green pastures
Are covered with snow f
You go to the barn,
And we feed you with hay,
And the maid goes to milk
You there, every day ;
She pats you, she loves you,
She strokes your sleek hide,
She speaks to you kindly,
And sits by your side :
Then come along home,
Pretty Mooly, oow, do.”
TW wir~i*~ oow «a)y said, “ Moo o-o !’
“ Mooly cow, mooly cow,
Whisking your tail
The milkmaid is waiting,
1 say, with her pail ;
She tucks up her petticoats,
Tidy and neat,
And places the three-legged
Stool for her seat.
What can you be staring at,
Mooly f You know
That we ought to have gons
Home an hour ago.
How dark it is growing I
O, what shall I do f’’
Ths mooly cow only said, *• Moo-o-o I”
That Calf.
To the yard, by the barn,
Came the farmer one morn,
And calling the cattle, he said,
While they trembled with fright :
“Now which of you, last night,
Shut the barn door while 1 was
abed 7"
Each one of them all shook his head.
Now the little calf Spot,
She was down in the lot,
And the way the rest talked was
a shame ;
For no one, night before,
Saw her shut up the door ;
But they said that she did, all ths
same,
For they always made her take the
blame.
Said the horse (dapple gray),
“ 1 was not up that way
Last night, as 1 recollect
And the bull, passing by,
Tossed his horns very high,
And said, “Let who may here object,
I say this, that calf I suspect.”
Then out spoke the cow,
“ It is terrible now,
To accuse honest folks of such
tricks.”
Said the cock in the tree,
“ I’m sure 'twasu’t me ;”
And the sheep all cried, “ Bab I
(there were sir)
N«*w oalft go* berealf \m a fix “
•* Why, of course we all knew
'Twas the wrong thing to do,”
Said the chickens “Of course,’
said the cat.
“ 1 suppose,” cried the mule,
Some folks think me a fool,
But I’m not quite so simple as that;
The poor calf never knows what
she’s at.”
Just that moment, the calf,
Who was always the laugh
And the jest of the yard, came In
sight.
“ Did you shut my barn door f”
Asked the farmer once more.
“ I did, sir, I closed it last night,”
Said the calf ; “ and I thought that
was right,”
Then each one shook his head.
“ She will catch it," they cried,
“ Serves her right for her meddle-
some ways.”
Said the farmer, “ Come here.
Little bossy, my dear,
You have done what I cannot repay,
And your fortune is made from
to-day.
“ For a wonder, last night,
1 forgot the door quite,
And if you had not shut it so neat,
All my colts had slipped in,
And gone right to the bin,
And got what they ought not to
eat,
They’d have founded themselves
upon wheat."
Then each hoof of them
All began loudly to bawl,
The very mule smiled, the cock crew;
M Little Spotty, my dear,
You’re a favourite here,”
They cried, “ we all said it was yon,
We were so glad to give you your
due.”
And the calf answered knowingly,
“ 800 I”

Drives his fluck afar ;
Through the murky mist and cloud
Shines no b« aeon star.

Never hears the moan

At the shepherd's d oiway
Stands his little son ;
Sees the sheep come trooping home.
Counts them, one by one ;
Counts th m full and fairly
Trace he find«*th none
Of the little snow white lamb
Left alone, alone I

Breasts the bitter wind,
Scours across the plain, and leaves
Wood and wold behind ;
Storm upon the mountain
Night upon its throne—
There he finds the little lamb,
Left alone, alone I
Struggling, panting, sobbing,
Kneeling on the ground,
Bound the pretty creature’s neck
Both his arras were wound ;
Soon within his bosom,
All its bleatings done,
Home he bears the little lamb,
Left alone, alone I
Oh 1 the happy faces,

High without the tempest roars,
But the laugh rings higher.

The dew was falling fast.
The stars b- s;an to blink ;
I heard a voice ; it said,
“ Drink, pretty creature, drink f”
And looking o’er the hedge
Before me I espied
A snow-white mountain lamb.
With a maiden by its side
Nor sheep nor kine were near ,
The lamb wa« all alone.
And by a slender cord
Was t.-thered io a stone ;
With one knee on the grass
Did the little maulen kneel.
While to this mountain lamb
Sh- gave its •-vening rn al.
" Whai ai-s thee, young one , whatf
Why pull so at thy cord ?
Is it not well with thee ?
Well both for bed and board f

“ What is it thou would’st seek !
What is wanting to thy Kart ?

And beautiful thou art.
This grass is tender grass ;
These flowers they have no peers ;
And that green corn all day long

“ Rest, little young one, rest ;

When my father found thee first
In places far away ;
Many flocks were on the hills,
But thou werl owne 1 by none,

A Visit to the Lambs.
Mother, let’s go and see the lambs :
This warm and sunny day
I think must make them very glad.
And full of fun and play.
Ah, there they are. You pretty things!
Now, don’t you run away ;
I’m come on purpose, that I am
To see you this fine day.
What pretty little heads you've got,
And such good-natured eyes I
And ruff of wool all round your
necks
How nicely curl’d it lies I
Come here, my little lambkin, come,
And lick my hand—now do I
How silly to be so afraid 1
Indeed I won’t hurt you.
Just put your hand upon its back,
Mother, how nice and warm I
There, pretty lamb, you see I don’t
Intend to Jo you harm.
HASY POETRY.


The Pet Lamb.
f Once on a time, a shepherd lived
Within a cottage small ;
The grey thatched roof was shaded by
An elm-tree dark and tall ;
While all around, stretched far away,
A wild and lonesome moor,
Except a little daisied field
Before the trellised door.
Now, it was on a cold March day,
When on the moorland wide
The shepherd found a trembling iamb
By its dead mother's side ;
And so pitiful it bleated,
As with the cold it shook.
He wrapped it up beneath his coat,
And home the poor iamb took.
He placed it by the warm fireside,
And then his children fed
This little lamb, whose mother died,
With milk and sweet brown bread,
Until it ran about the floor,
Or at the door would stand ;
And grew so tame, it ate its food
From out the children’s hand.
It followed them where’er they went,
Came ever at their call,
And dearly was this pretty lamb
Beloved by them all.
And often on a market-day,
When cotters crossed the moor,
They stopped to praise the snow-white
lamb
Beside the cottage door ;
They patted it upon its head,
And stroked it with the hand,
And vowed it was the prettiest iamb
Tb.y 4 sms is all th« 'and.
Now, this kind shepherd was as ill,
As ill as he could be,
And kept his bed for many a week,
And nothing earned he ;
And when he had got well again,
He to his wife did say,
“ The doctor wants his money, and
1 haven’t it to pay.
“ What shall we do, what can we do f
The doctor made me well,
There’s only one thing can l>e done.
We must the pet lamb sell ;
We’ve nearly eaten all the bread,
And how can we get more,
Unless you call the butcher in
When he rides by the door ?”
“ Oh, do not sell my white pet lamb,"
Then little Mary said,
“ And every night I’ll go up stairs
Without my tea to bed ;
Oh I do not sell my sweet, pet lamb ;
And if you’ll let it live,
The best half of my bread and milk
I will unto it give.”
The doctor at that very time
Entered the cottage door,
As, with her arms around her lamb,
She sat upon the floor.
“|For if the butcher buys my lamb,
He’ll take away its life,
And make its pretty white throat
bleed
With his sharp cruel knife ;
“ And never in the morning light
Again it will me meet,
Nor come again to lick my hand,
Look up to me and bleat.”
“ Why do you weep, my pretty girl P
The doctor then did say.
“ Became I love my little lamb,
Wiiicb most be sold to-day ;
It lies beside my bed at night,
And, oh, it is so still,
It never made a bit of noise
When father was so ill.
“ Oh do not let them sell my lamb,
And then I’ll gc to bed,
Ynd never ask for aught to eat
But a small piece of bread.”
“ I'll buy the lamb and give it you,"
The kind, good doctor said,
“ And with the money that 1 pay
Your father can buy bread.
“ As fur the bill, that can remain
Until another year.”
He paid the money down, and said,
“ The lamb is yours, my dear :
You have a kind and gentle heart,
And God, who made us all.
He loveth well those who are kind
To creatures great and small ;
“ And while I live, my little girl.
Your lamb shall not be sold,
But play with you upon the moor,
Aud sleep within the fold.”
A nil so the white pet lamb was
And played upon the moor,
And after little Mary ran
About the cottage-floor.
It fed upon the cowslips tall.
And ale the grass so sweet,
And on the little garden-walk
Pattered its pretty feet ;
And with its head upon her lap
The little lamb would lay
Asleep ben< ath the elm tree’s shade.
Upon the summer’s day,
While she twined flowers around it■
neck,
And called it her, “ Sweet May."

PIGGY LAND.
The Pig, He is a Gentle-
man.
The pig. he is a gentleman,
And never goes to work ;
He eats the very best of food
Without a knife or fork.
The pig, he is a gentleman,
And drinks the best of milk j
His clothes are good, and thick, and
strong
And wear as well as silk.
The pig he is a gentleman,
And covers up his head,
And looks out at you with one eye,
And grunts beneath his bed.
He eats, and drinks, and sleeps all day
Just like his lady mother,
His father, uncle, and his aunt,
His sister, and his brother.

The Pigs.
“Do look at those pigs, as they lie in
the straw,’’
Little Richard said to papa ;
“They keep eating longer than ever 1
saw.
What nasty fat gluttons they are 1”
“ I see they are feasting,” his father
replied,
“They eat a great deal I allow ;
But let us remember, before we deride,
’Tis the nature, my dear, of a sow.
“ But when a great boy, such as you
my dear Dick,
Does nothing but eat all the day,
And keeps sucking good things till he
makes himself sick,
What a glutton; indeed, we may say.
“When plnmcake and sugar for ever
be picks,
And sweetmeats, and comfits, and
fi£»:
Pray let him get rid of his own nasty
tricks,
Asad tk»n ke m*v lanrb at the pigs.”

Five Little Pigs^
Five lit-tle fineers
And five lit-tle pigs,
Of each I’ve a sto-ry to tell ;
Look at their faces
And fun-ny curbed tails,
And hear what each one be-felL
Ring-tail, that stead-y
And good lit-tle pig,
To mark-et set off at a trot;
And brought home his bas-ket
Quite full of nice things,
Con-tent-ed and pleas ed with his lot.
Young Bmii-er, the next,
Was a stay at home pig,
Lik-ed his pipe, and to sit at his ease;
He fell fast a-sleep,
Burned his nose with his pipe,
And a-woke with a ve-ry loud sneeze
Num-ber three was young Long-snout.
Who ate up the beef,
He was both greed-y and fat ;
He made him-self ill
By eat-ing too much.
And then he was sor-ry for that.
And poor lit-tle Qrun-ter—
You know he had none—
A P'g-£J so hun-gry and sad ;
He si-lent-ly wiped
The salt tears from his eyes,
I think it was real-ly too bad
Y oung Squeak-er cried, “Wee, wee, wee,
All the way home,
A P'K YJ so fret-ful was he ;
He got a good whip-ping,
Was sent off, to bed,
And de served it, I think you must
see.

The Self-willed Pig,
It happened one day,
As the other pigs tell,
In course of their walk
They drew near to a well,
So wide and so deep,
With so smooth a wall round.
That a pig tumbling in
Was sure to be drowned.
But a perverse little brother,
Foolish as ever,
Still boasting himself
Very cunning and clever,
Now made up his mind
That, whatever befell,
He would run on before
And jump over the well.
Then away he ran fast
To one side of the well,
Climbed up on the wall,
Slipped, and headlong he fell ;
And now from the bottom
His pitiful shout
Was, “ Oh mother I I'm in :
Pray do help me out I”
She ran to the side
When she heard his complaint,
And she then saw him struggling,
Weakly and faint,
Yet no help could she give I
But, “ My children,’’ cried she,
“ How often I’ve feared
A sad end his would be I ”
“ Oh, mother, dear mother
The drowning pig cried,
" I see all this comes
Of my folly and pride I”
He could not speak more,
But he sank down and died,
Whilst his mother and brothers
Wept round the well-side I
PIG GOING TO MARKET.


SCHOOL BOY PIGS.
Three Naughty Pigs.
Three naughty pigs,
All in one pen,
Drank up the milk
Left by the men.
Then all the three,
Fast as they could,
Dug their way out
To find something good.
Out in the garden
A maiden fair
Had set some flowers
Of beauty rare.
Out in the garden
A merry boy
Had planted seeds,
With childish joy.
One naughty pig
Ran to the bed ;
Soon lay the flowers
Drooping and dead.
Two naughty pigs
Dug up the seeds,
And left, for the boy,
Not even weeds.
Three naughty pigs,
Back in the pen,
Never could do
Such digging again.
For, in their noses.
Something would hurt,
Whenever they tried
To dig in the dirt.
Little Biddy.
Little Biddy O’Toole, on her three
leeg'vi .tool,
Was atm her praties so hot;
Whin up stepped the pig,
Wid his appetite big.
And BLLi/ gr>' town like a shot,
The Spectre Pig.
It was the stalwart butcher man
That knit his swarthy brow,
And said the gentle pig must die.
And sealed it with a vow.
And oh I it was the gentle pig
Lay stretched upon the ground,
And ah I it was the cruel knife
His little heart that found.
They took him then those wicked men,
They trailed him all along ;
They put a stick between his lips.
And through his heels a thong.
And round and round an oaken beam
A hempen cord they flung,
And like a mighty pendulum
All solemnly he swung.
Now say thy prayers, thon sinful man,
And think what thou hast done,
And read thy catechism well,
Thou sanguinary one.
For if its sprite should walk by night,
It better were for thee,
That thou were mouldering in the
ground,
Or bleaching in the sea.
It was the savage butcher then
That made a mock of sin,
And swore a very wicked oath,
He did not care a pin.
It was the butcher’s youngest son,
His voice was broke with sighs,
And with his pocket-handkerchief
He wiped his little eyes.
All young and ignorant was he,
But innocent and mild,
And, in his soft simplicity,
Out spoke the tender child—
“ Oh I father, father, list to me ;
The pig is deadly sick,
And men have hung him by his heels
And fed him with a stick.”
It was the naughty butcher then
That laughed as he would die,
Yet did he soothe the sorrowing child,
And bid him not to cry.
“ Oh I Nathan, Nathan, what’s a pig,
That thou shouldst weep and wail ?
Come, bear thee like a butcher’s child,
And thou shalt have his tail.”
It was the butcher’s daughter then,
So slender and so fair,
That sobbed as if her heart would
break
And tore her yellow hair.
And thus she spoke in thrilling tone—
Fell fast the tear-drops big :
“ Ah 1 woe to me ! Alas 1 alas I
The pig I the pig I the pig I”
Then did her wicked father’s lips
Make merry with her woe,
And call her many a naughty name,
Because she whimpered so.
Te need not weep, ye gentle ones,
In rain your tears are shed,
Ye cannot wash the crimson hand,
Ye cannot soothe the dead.
The bright sun folded on his breast
His robes of rosey flame,
And softly over all the west
The shades of evening came.
He slept, and troops of murdered pigs
Were busy with his dreams ;
Loud rang their wild, unearthly
shrieks,
Wide yawned their mortal seams.
The clock struck twelve ; the dead
hath heard ;
He opened both his eyes,
And sullenly he shook his tail
To lash the feeding flies.
One quiver of the hempen cord—
One struggle and one bound—
With stiffened limb and leaden eye,
The pig was on the ground.
And straight towards the sleeper’s
house
His fearful way he wended ;
And hooting owl, and hovering bat,
On midnight wing attended.
Back flew the bolt, uprose the latch,
And open swung the door,
And little mincing feet were heard
Pat, pat, along the floor.
Two hoofs upon the sanded floor,
And two upon the bed ;
And they are breathing side by side,
The living and the dead.
" Now wake, now wake, thou butcher
man I
What makes your cheeks so pale f
Take hold I take hold I thou dost not
fear
To clasp a spectre’s tail f”
Untwisted every winding coil ;
The shuddering wretch took hold,
Till like an icicle it seemed,
To tapering and so cold.
u Thou com’st with me, thou butcher
man I”
He strives to loose his grasp,
But, faster than the clinging vine,
Those twining spirals clasp.
And open, open, swung the door,
And fleeter than the wind,
The shadowy spectre swept before,
The butcher trailed behind.
Fast fled the darkness of the night,
And morn rose faint and dim ;
They called full loud, they knocked
full long
They did not waken him.
Straight, straight towards that oaken
beam,
A trampled pathway ran ;
A ghastly shape was swinging there—
It was the butcher man.

PIGGY LAND


MIXED ANIMAL LAND.
Little Dame Crump.
Little Dame Crump,
Wits, her little hair broom,
One morning was sweeping
Her little bedroom.
When, casting her little
Grey eyes on the ground,
In a sly little corner
A penny she found.
“ Dear me I ” cried the Dame,
While she stared with surprise,
“ How lucky I am
To find such a prize I
To market I’ll go,
And a pig I will buy,
And little John Grubbins
Shall make him a sty."
So she washed her face clean,
And put on her gown,
And locked up the house,
And set off for town.
Then to market she went,
And a purchase she made
Of a little white pig,
And a penny she paid.
Having purchased the pig,
She was puzzled to know
How they both should get home;
So fearing lest piggie
Should play her a trick,
She drove him along
With a little crab stick.
Piggie ran till they came
To the foot of a hill,
Where a little bridge stood
O'er the stream of a mill ;
Piggie grunted and squeaked,
But no further would go :
Oh, fie I Piggie, fie 1
To serve little Dame so.
She went to the mill,
And she borrowed a sack
To pul the pig in,
And take him on her back :
Piggie squeaked to get out,
But the little Dame said,
“ If you won’t go of yourself,
You then must be made.
At last when the end
Of her journey had come,
She was awfully glad
She had got the pig home :
She carried him straight
To his nice little sty,
And gave him some hay
And some straw, nice and drv.
With a handful of peas
Then Piggie she fed,
And put on her night-cap,
And got into bed :
Having first said her prayers,
And put out the light ;
And being quite tired,
We’ll wiah her good night.
The Chinese Pig.
Old Madam Grumph, the pig has got
A pig-sty of her own ;
She is a most un-com-mon pig,
And likes to lire alone.
A red-tiled roofing covers in
The one half of her sty ;
And, half sur-round-ed by a wall,
la open to the sky.
There stands the trough, they keep It fill'd
With pig-wash and with parings ;
And all the other pigs declare
Dame Grumph has dainty fairings.
They like to see what she’s about,
And poke their noses through
A great hole in the pig-sty door,
From whence they get a view.
The pigs, that run about the yard,
Are very lean and tall,
With long hind legs—but Madam Grumph
Is round as any ball.
One autumn day, when she awoke
(’T was very cold and raw),
She found a litter of young pigs
Half buried in the straw.
“ Humph," said the dame, “ now let me see
How many have I got."
She counted, “ Six and four are ten, —
Two dead ones in the lot.
“ Eight—That’s a nice round family :
A black one and two white ;
The rest are spotted like myself,
With prick ears—that’s all right,
“ What’s to be done with those dead things,
They’d better be thrown out,"
Said she, and packed the litter round
The others with her snout.
“ What’s that, old Grumphy ? ” said a pig,
Whose snout peeped through the door ;
“There’s something moving in the straw
I never saw before.”
“ I wish you’d mind your own affairs,"
Said she, and stepp’d between
The young pigs and the pig-sty door,
Not wishing to be seen.
“ I hope you slept well,” said the pig,
“ The wind was very high ;
You are most comfortably lodged—
A most con-ve-ni-ent sty.”
** I thought I told you once before
To mind your own affairs,"
Said she, and bristling up her back,
She bit the lean pig’s ears.
“ Squeak," said the bitten pig, “ sque-e-ak,
Old Grumphy’s biting hard ; ”
And and all the lean pigs scamp-er’d up
From all sides of the yard.
They grumbled and they grunted loud,
They squeak’d in every key ;
At last another pig peep'd through,
To see what he could see.
Dame Grumph was standing by her pigs,
And looking very proud,
And all the little piggy-wigs
Were squeaking very loud.
“ These lovely creatures,” said old Grumph,
“ These lovely pigs are mine ;
They're fat and pink, like human babes,
Most pro-mi-sing young swine.”
“ Indeed,” ex-claim’d the peeping pig,
“ 1 never should have thought,
They were so very promising.”
Old Grumphy gave a snort.
“ They’re of a most dis-tin-guished lace s
My mother and her brother
Were both im-por-ted from Pekin.—
My pigs are like my mother.
“ They never shall as-so-ci-ate
With long-legged pigs like you,"
Said she, ad-dress-ing the lean pig,
Whose snout was peeping through,
" Begging your pardon, Madam Grumph,
I really think,” said he,
“ The dif-fer-ence is not so great
As it appears to be.
“ If you and I were bacon, ma’am,
The dif-fer-ence between
An Irish and a Chinese pig
Would hardly then be seen.
“ Give me your comfortable sty,
And some of your nice food,
Our little fa-mi-lies might prove

MADAM GRUMP AND HER BABIES.


The Old Woman and her Pig.
Once an old woman was sweeping her house,
and found a crooked sixpence, and went to
market to buy a pig. As she was coming home
she came to a stile, and the pig would not get
over it: so she went a little farther and met a
dog, and said to the dog:—
“ Dog, dog, bite pig;
Piggy won’t get over the stile,
And I shan’t get home to-night."
But the dog would not,
She went a little farther and met a stick, and said:
"Stick, stick, beat dog; dog won’t bite pig,
Piggy won’t get over the stile,
And I shan’t get home to-night."
But the stick would not.
She went a little farther and met a fire, and said:
"Fire, fire, burn stick; stick won’t beat dog,
Dog won't bite pig,
Piggy won’t get over the stile,
And I shan’t get home to-night."
But the fire would not.
She went a little farther and met some water,
and said;
"Water, water, quench fire,
Fire won’t burn stick,
Stick won’t beat dog, dog won’t bite pig,
Piggy won’t get over the stile.
And I shan’t get home to-night."
But the water would not.
She went a little farther and met an ox, and
said:
‘‘Ox, ox, drink water;
Water won’t quench fire, fire won’t burn stick,
Stick wont’t beat dog, dog won’t bite pig,
Piggy won’t get over the stile.
And I shan’t get home to-night."
But the ox would not.
She went a little farther and met a butcher,
and said:
‘‘Butcher, butcher, kill ox,
Ox won’t drink water,
Water won’t quench fire, fire won’t burn stick,
Stick won’t beat dog, dog won’t bite pig
Piggy won’t get over the stile.
And I shan’t get home to-night.”
But the butcher would not.
She went a little farther and met a rope and
said:
‘‘Rope, rope, hang butcher,
Butcher won t kill ox, ox won’t drink water
Water won’t quench fire, fire won’t burn stick,
Stick wont beat dog, dog won’t bite pig.
Piggy won't get over the stile.
And I shan’t get home to-night,”
But the rope would not.
She went a little farther and met a rat. and
said:
‘‘Rat, rat, gnaw rope;
Rope won’t hang butcher,
Butcher won’t kill ox, ox won’t drink water,
Water won’t quench fire, fire won’t burn stick,
Stick won’t beat dog, dog won’t bite pig,
Piggy won’t get over the stile,
And I shan’t get home to-night."
But the rat would not.
She went a little farther and met a cat, and
»aid:
" Cat, cat, kill rat; rat won’t gnaw rope,
Rope won’t hang butcher,
Butcher won’t kill ox, ox won’t drink water,
Water won’t quench fire, fire won’t burn stick,
Stick won t beat dog, dog won’t bite pig,
Piggy won’t get over the stile.
And I shan’t get home to-night.”
But the cat said to her, "If you will go to
yonder cow, and fetch me a saucer of milk, I
will kill the rat, So away went the old woman
to the cow, and said:
“Cow, cow, give me some milk, cat won’t kill ral,
Rat won’t gnaw rope, rope won’t hang butcher,
Butcher won’t kill ox, ox won’t drink water,
Water won’t quench fire, fire won’t burn stick,
Stick won’t beat dog, dog won’t bite pig,
Piggy won’t get over the stile,
And I shan’t get home to-night,"
But the cow said to her, " If you will go to yonder hay-
makers and fetch me a wisp of hay, I’ll give you the milk “
So away the old woman went to the haymakers and said
" Haymakers, give me a wisp of hay;
Cow won’t give me milk, cat wont kill rat,
Rat won’t gnaw rope, rope won't hang butcher,
Butcher won't kill ox, ox won’t drink water,
Water won’t quench fire, fire won't burn stick,
Stick won’t beat dog, dog won’t bite pig,
Piggy won't go over the stile,
And I shan’t get home to night.”
But the haymakers said to her, " If you will go and
fetch us a bucket of water, we’ll give you the hay.” So
away the old woman went; but she found the bucket
was full of holes. So she covered the bottom with
pebbles, and then filled the bucket with water, and
away she went back with it to the haymakers; and
they gave her a wisp of nay.
As soon as the cow had eaten the hay, she gave the
old woman the milk; and away she went with it in a
saucer to the cat. As soon as the cat had drank the
milk, the cat began to kill the rat, the rat began to gnaw
the rope, the rope began to hang the butcher, the butcher
began to kill the ox, the ox began to drink the water, the
water began to quench the fire, the fire began to burn
the stick, the stick began to beat the dog, the dog began
to bite the pig, the pig in a great fright jumped over the
stile, and so the old woman got home that night in time
to boil some apple dumplings for her husband’s supper.
The Flying Pig.
“Dickery, dickery, dare,
The pig flew up in the air,
But Patrick Brown soon brought him down,
Dickery, dickery, dare.”
The Story of the Three Little Pigs.
Once there was an old pig, who had three little pigs,
and sent them ont to their fortune The first one
went and built a house with straw, and soon after
a wolf came and knocked at the door and said.
“ Little pig, let me come in.” But the little pig
said, "No, no, by the hair of my chin.” The
wolf then said, "I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll
blow your house in." So he huffed, and he
puffed, and he blew the house in, and ate up
the little pig. The next little pig built a house
with sticks, and the old wolf came along and
called out, "Little pig, let me come in." And
the little pig answered, "No, no, by the hair of
my chin.” "Then,” says the wolf, "I’ll huff,
and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in. So
he huffed, and he puffed, and blew the house
down, and ate up the little pig also. The third
pig built a house with bricks. Just after along
came the old wolf, and said, "Little pig, let me
come in.” The little pig said, "No, no, by the
hair of my chin.” "Then I’ll huff, and I’ll
puff, and I’ll blow your house down." Well he
he huffed and he puffed, and he huffed and he
puffed, and he puffed and he huffed; but he
could not get the house down. When he found
that he could not, with all his huffing and puff-
ing, blow the house down, he said, "Little pig,
I know where there is a nice field of turnips.”
"Where?" said the little pig. "Oh, in Mr.
Smith's home field, and if you will be ready to-
morrow morning 1 will call for you, and we will
go together, and get some for dinner." "Very
well,” said the little pig, " I will be ready. What
time do you mean to go?” "Oh, at six o’clock.”
Well, the little pig got up at five, and got the
turnips before the wolf came, which he did
about six, and said, " Little pig, are you ready?”
The little pig said, “ Ready; I’ve been and come
back again, and got a nice potful for dinner."
The wolf felt very angry at this, but thought
that he would be up to the little pig somehow
or other, so he said, "Little pig, I know where
there is a nice apple tree." " Where?" said the
little pig. " Down at Merry Garden,” replied
the wolf, " and if you will not deceive me I will
come for you at five o’clock to-morrow, and we
will go together and get some apples.” Well,
the pig bustled up the next morning at four
o’clock, and went off for the apples, hoping to
get back before the wolf came; but he had further
to go, and had to climb the tree, so that just as
he was coming down from it, he saw the wolf
coming, which, as you may suppose, frightened
him very much. When the wolf came up he
said, " Little pig, what; are you here before me?
Are they nice apples?” "Yes. very," said the
little pig, "I will throw you down one.” And*
he threw it so far that, while the wolf was gone
to pick it up. the little pig jumped down and
ran home. The next day the wolf came again,
and said, " Little pig, there is a fair at Shanklin
this afternoon, will you go?” "Oh yes," said the
pig, I will go; what time shall you be ready?"
"At three," said the wolf. So the little pig went
off before the time as usual, got to the fair, and
bought a butter-churn, which he was gging
home with, when he saw the wolf coming
Then he could not tell what to do. So he got
into the churn to hide, and by so doing turned
it round, and it rolled down the hill with the
pig in it, which frightened the wolf so much
that he ran home without going to the fair. He
went to the little pig’s house and told him how
frightened he had been by a great round thing
which came down the hill past him. Then the
little pig said, "Ha! I frightened you then. 1
had been to the fair and bought a butter-churn,
and when I saw you I got into it and rolled
down the hill.” Then the wolf was very angry
indeed, and declared he would eat up the little
pig, and that he would get down the chimney
after him. When the little pig saw what he
was about, he hung on the pot full of water,
and made up a blazing fire, and just as the wolf
was coming down, took off the cover, and in
fell the wolf; so the little pig put on the cover
again in an instant, boiled him up. and ate him
for supper, and lived happy ever afterward*
PIGGY' LAND.


BUNNY LAND
The Wild Rabbits.
Among the sand-hills,
Near by the sea,
Wild young rabbits
Were seen by me.
They live in burrows
With winding-ways,
And there they shelter
On rainy days.
The mother rabbit*
Make cosy nests,
With hairy linings
From their breasts.
The tender young ones
Are nursed and fed,
And safely hidden
In this warm bed.
And when they are older,
They all come out
Upon the sand-hills
And frisk about.
They play and nibble
The long, dry grass,
But scamper away
Whenever you pass
Disobedient Bunny,
A pert little rabbit,
Once lived in a hole,
And just did whatever he pleased ;
His ways were so funny,
His antics so droll,
That his parents were terribly teased.
“ Now, dear,” said his mother,
“ You'd best stay at home,
And try to be patient and good.”
But No I he was fully
Determined to roam
Through the green and beautiful wood.
So what did he do f
On a fine summer day,
When mother was not to be seen,
He took to his heels,
And scampered away
Right over the meadow so green.
He shook bis long ears,
And he whisked up his tail,
His eyes really daneing with glee,
As onward he ran
Through a beautiful vale,
And oh I how delighted was he I
’Twas not very long
Till he found a haystack,
Where of course there was shelter and food.
Said he to himself,
“ Now, I’ll never go back
To my stupid old home in the wood.
“ I’ll dig a nice den
For myself in the hay ;
How warm it will be and how nice !
Why, in my old burrow
Full many a day
I’ve often felt colder than ice ? ”
So bunny soon dug him
A nice little hole,
And made it as round as an 0 ;
And really he looked
So exceedingly droll, [know.
You’d have laughed had you seen him, I
But evening drew on,
It was lonely and dark,
So Bunny lay down in his den ;
Said he to himself,
“ I’ll get up with the lark,
And won’t I I* ravenous then I
‘•For really this hay,
Though it does for a nest,
Is somewhat too dry for my food ;
At home there is clover,
The thing I love best,
And lettuce and carrots so good.
“ I wish 1 had some
At this moment I but then
I’m out on my travels just now,
And 1 greatly prefer
To reside in this den,
Than at home where there’s often a row I
“ Ah, well I I feel sleepy,
I’d best go to bed—
But what is that noise that I hear f
There seems to be someone
Right over my head,
I hope that no wild beasts are near 1 ”
Meanwhile an old fox
With a great bushy tail
Was prowling about and around,
But poor little Bunny
Was hidden so well
That never a bit was he found f
When morning had come,
And the fox disappeared,
Then Bunny came forth to the light,
Said he to himself,
“It was just as I feared,
A fox has been here through the night.
“ I think I had better
Go scampering home
To the dear little home in the wood.
And never, oh never
Again will I roam,
Or 1 ave my dear mother so good."
Away then he ran,
Without once looking back,
Till he saw the dear home he loved best,
And mother came hopping
Along the hard track
To welcome him home to the nest.
And, oh ! such a breakfast
Before him there lay,
Such clover and grass from the wood ;
And always, I’ve heard,
From that terrible day,
That Bunny is patient and good.
D. B McKEAN.
The Pet Rabbit.
I have a little Bunny
With his coat as soft as down,
And nearly all of him is white
Except one bit of brown.
The first thing in the morning,
When I get out of bed,
I wonder if my bunny’s still
Safe in his little shed.
And then the next thing that I do
I daresay you have guessed ;
It’s at once to go and see him,
When I am washed and dressed
And every day I see him.
I like him more and more,
And each day he is bigger
Than he was the day before.
I feed him in the morning
With bran and bits of bread,
And every night 1 take some straw
To make his little bed.
What with carrots in the morning
And turnip-tops for tea,
If a bunny can be happy,
I’m sure he ought to be.
Then when it’s nearly bed-time
I go down to his shed,
And say ‘’Good night, you bunny 1”
Before I go to bed.
I think there’s only one thing
That would make me happy quite
If 1 could take my bunny dear
With me to bed at night.

The Little Hare.
Beyond the palings of the park
A Hare had made her form,
Beneath a drooping fern, that made
A shelter snug and warm.
She slept until the daylight came,
And all things were aw r ake,
And then the Hare, with noiseless
steps,
Crept softly from the brake.
She stroked her whiskers with her
paws,
Looked timidly around
With open eyes, and ears erect
That caught the smallest sound.
The Field-Mouse rustled in the grass,
The Squirrel in the trees,
But Puss was not at all afraid
Of common sounds like these.
She frisked and gambolled with
delight,
And cropped a leaf or two
Of clover and of tender grass,
That glistened in the dew.
What was it, then, that made her
start,
And run away so fast?
She heard the distant sound of hounds,
She heard the huntsman’s blast.
Tally-ho I—hoy I tally-ho I
The hounds are in full cry ;
Ehew I ehew ! —in scarlet coats
The men are sweeping by.
So off she set with a spring and a
bound,
Over the meadows and open ground,
Faster than hunter and faster than
hound
And on—and on—till she lost the
sound,
And away went the little Hare.
AUNT KFFIE.
Peter and the Hare.
Thoughtless little Petf-r,
W ith his little gun,
Went out by the woodside
For a little fun ;
Saw a happy little hare.
Who on clover fed—
With his little gun took aim
And shot him in the head.
Thoughtful little Peter,
Pad for what he’d done,
Sat down on a stump, and there
By it laid his gun ;
Wished that he could bring to life
That little hare so still;
“Never more,” said he, “will I
A harmless creature kill.”
Epitaph on a Hare.
Here lies whom hound did ne’er
pursue,
Nor swifter greyhound follow,
Whose foot ne’er tainted morning dew
Nor ear heard huntsman’s halloo
Old Tiney, surliest of his kind,
Who, nursed with tender care,
And to domestic bounds confined,
Was still a wild Jack-hare.
Though duly from my hand he took
His pittance every night,
He did it with a jealous look,
And when he could, would bite.
On twigs of hawthorn he regaled,
On pippin’s russet peel ;
And when his juicy salads fail’d,
Sliced carrot pleased him well.
A Turkey carpet was his lawn,
Whereon he loved to bound,
To skip and gambol like a fawn,
And swing himself around.
His frisking was at evening hours,
For then he lost his fear I
But most before approaching showtrs,
Or when a storm drew near.
Eight years and five round-rolling
moons
He thus saw steal away,
Dozing out all his idle noons,
And every night at play.
I kept him for his humour’s sake,
For he would oft beguile
My heart of thoughts that made it
ache,
And force me to a smile
But now, beneath this walnut shade,
He finds his long last home,
And waits, in snug concealment laid,
Till gentler puss shall come.
He, still more aged, feels the shocks
From which no care can save ;
And partner once of Tiney’s box.
Must soon partake his grave.
WILLIAM COWPER.
Punch’s Appeal for the
Hunted Hare.
All on the bare and bleak hillside,
One night this merry Christmas-tide,
A shivering, hunted hare did hide;
Poor Pussy!
Though we had hunted puss all day,
The wind had blown her scent away,
And balked the dogs, so there she lay,
Poor Pussy I
There to the earth she humbly crept,
There brooding o’er her lot she wept,
There, on her empty stomach slept ;
Poor Pussy I
And there, while frozen fell the dew.
She dreamt an ugly dream or two,
As starved, wet folk are apt to do,
Did Pussy I
Loud hungry hounds of subtle ken,
And thundering steeds, and hard-eyed
men,
Are fast on Pussy’s trail again,
Poor Pussy.
Onwards she strains, on, as they tear,
Foremost amongst the foremost there,
Are ruthless women’s faces fair ;
Poor Pussy I
One moment’s check, to left, to right,
In vain she spends her little might,
Some yokel’s eyes have marked her
flight,
Poor Pussy 1
What use her fine small wits to rack f
Closer, and faster on her track
Hurrries the hydra-headed pack,
Lost Pussy 1
“For pity's sake, kind huntsman, stopl
Call off the dogs before I drop.
And kill me with your heavy crop,”
Shrieks Pussy 1
With shuddering start and stifled
scream,
She wakes I —She finds it all a dream;
How kind the cold, cold earth doth
seem
To Pussy I
JBmSTNY LAND.


RAT LAND.
A GENTLEMAN RAT.
The Pied Piper of Hamelin,
OB
Th« Vanished Children.
Hamelin Town’s in Brunswick
By famous Hanover city;
The river Weser, deep and wide,
VVashes its wall on the southern side;
A pleasanter spot you never spied;
But, when begins my ditty,
Almost five hundred years ago,
To see the townsfolk suffer so
From vermin was a pity.
Rats!
They fought the dogs, and killed the
cats,
And bit the babies in the cradles,
And ate the cheeses out of the vats,
And licked the soup from the cook’s
own ladles,
Split open the kegs of salted sprats,
Made nests inside men’s Sunday hats,
And even spoiled the women’s chats,
By drowning their speaking,
With shrieking and squeaking
In fifty different sharps and flats.
At last the people in a body
To the Town Hall came flocking:
“’Tis clear,” cried they, ‘‘our Mayor’s
a noddy; [ing
And as for our Corporation—shock-
To think we buy gowns lined with
ermine
► or dolts that can’t or won’t determine
What’s best to rid us of our vermin!
The Mayor and Town Councillors
were greatly perplexed what to do,
-«hen there entered a strange-lookiug
i»lp*r, and offered to charm away all
the rats for a thousand guilders The
council joyfully agreed to this, and at
once:—
Into the street the Piper swept,
Smiling first a little smile,
As if he knew what magic slept
In his quiet pipe the while:
Then, like a musical adept,
To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,
And green and blue his sharp eyes
twinkled
Like a candle flame where salt is
sprinkled;
And ere three shrill notes the pipe
uttered.
You heard as if an army muttered;
And the muttering grew to a
grumbling;
And the grumbling grew to a mighty
rumbling;
And out of the houses the rats came
tumbling.
Great rats, small rats, lean rats,
brawny rats,
Brown rats, black rats, gray rats.
tawny rats,
Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,
Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,
Cocking tails and pricking whiskers.
Families by tens and dozens,
Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives—
Followed the Piper for their lives.
From street to street he piped an-
vancing,
And step by step they followed
dancing,
Until they came to river Weser
Wherein all plunged and perished
—Save one.
You should have heard the Hamelin
people
Ringing the bells till they rocked the
steeple.
“On," cried the Mayor, “and get
long polesl
Poke out the nests and block un
the hulesl
Consult withcarpentersand builders.
And leave in our town not even a
trace
Of the rats!”—when suddenly up
the face
Of the Piper perked in the market-
place,
With a “ First, if you please, my
thousand guilders !’’
The Mayor and Councillors abused
the Piper, refused to pay him the
thousand guilders, and offered him
fifty and a drink, he refused to take
less than they had offered, and said:—
Folks who put me in a passion
May find me pipe to another fashion,”
“How?" cried the Mayor, “ d’ye think
I’ll brook
Being worse treated than a Cook?
Insulted by a lazy ribald
With idle pipe and vesture piebald?
You threaten us, fellow? Do your
worst,
Blow your pipe there till you burst!”
Once more he slept into the street:
And to hi« lips no-^iu
Laid his long pipe of smooth straight
cane;
And ere he blew three notes (suck
sweet
Soft notes as yet musicians cunning
Never gav.- the enraptured air),
There was a rustling, that seemed like
a bustling
Of merry crowds justling, at pitching
and hustling,
Small feet were pattering, wooden
shoes clattering,
Little hands clapping, and little
tongues chattering,
And, like fowls in a farmyard when
barley is scattering,
Out came the children running,
All the little boys and girls.
With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,
And sparkling eyes and teeth like
pearls,
Tripping and skipping, ran merrily
after
The wonderful music with shouting
and laughter.
The Mayor was dumb, and the Council
stood
As if they were changed into blocks
of wood,
Unable to move a step, or cry
To the children merrily skipping by—
And could only follow with the eye
That joyous crowd at the Piper’s back.
But how the Mayor was on the rack,
And the wretched Council's bosoms
beat,
As the Piper turned from the High
street
To where the Weser rolled its waters
Bight in the way of their sons and
daughters!
However he turned from South te
West.
And to Koppelberg Hill his steps
addressed,
And after him the children pressed;
Great was the joy in every breast.
He never can cross that mighty top!
He’s forced to let the piping drop,
And we shall see our children stop!”
When lot as they reached the moun-
tain's side,
A wondrous portal opened wide,
As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed,
And the Piper advanced and the
children followed.
And when all were in to the very last,
The door in the mountain-side shut
fast,
Did I say allf No! one was lame,
And could not dance the whole of the
way!
And in after years, if you would
blame
His sadness, he was used to say —
“It’s dull in our town since my
playmates left;
1 can’t forget that I’m bereft
Of all the pleasant sights they see,
Which the Piper also promised me;
For he led us, he said, to a joyous
land,
Joining the town and just at hand,
Where waters gushed and fruit trees
grew,
And flowers put forth a fairer hat,


And everything was strange and new;
The sparrows were brighter than
peacocks here,
And their dogs outran our fallow deer,
And honey-bees had lost their stings;
And horses were born with eagles’
wings,
And just as 1 became assured
My lame foot would be speedily cured,
The music stopped, and I stood still,
And found myself outside the Hill,
Left alone against my will,
To go now limping as before,
And never hear of that country morel”
Alas, alas for Hamelinl
There came into many a burgher’s
pate
A text which says, that Heaven’s
Gate
Opes to the Rich at as easy rate
As the needle's eye takes a camel ini
The Mayor sent East, West, North
and South,
Fo offer the Piper by word of mouth,
Wherever it was men’s lot to find
him,
Silver and gold to his heart’s content,
I f he’d only return the way he went,
And bring the children all behind
him.
But at length they saw ’twas a lost
endeavour,
For Piper and dancers were gone for
•ver.
BROWNING.
In the morning as he entered the hall,
Where his picture hung against the
wall,
A sweat like death all over him came,
For the Rats had eaten it oat of the
frame.
As he looked, there came a man from
his farm,
He had a countenance white with
alarm; —
“ I opened your granaries this morn,
And the Rats had eaten all the corn."
Another came running presently,
And he was pale as pale could be; —
“ Flyl my Lord Bishop, without delay,
Ten thousand rats are coming this
way.”
“ I’ll go to my tower on the Rhine,"
quoth he,
“ 'Tis the safest place in Germany;
The walls ari high and the shores are
steep,
And the stream is long and the water
deep."
Bishop Hatto fearfully hastened away,
And he crossed the Rhine without
delay,
And reached his tower, and barred
with care
All the windows, doors, and loopholes
there
He laid him down, and closed his eyes,
But soon a scream made him arise;
He started, and saw two eyes of flame
On his pillow, from whence the
screaming came.
He listened, and looked—it < as only
the cat;
But the Bishop grew more fearful fur
that;
For she sat screaming, mad with fear,
At the array of rats that were drawing
near.
For they have swum over the river so
deep,
And they have dimed the shores so
steep,
And up the tower their way is bent.
To do the work for which they were
sent.
They are not to be told by the dozen
or score—
By thousands they come, and by
myriads, and more;
Such number* had never been heard
of before,
Such a judgment had never b*«n
witnessed of yore.
Down on his knees the Bishop fell,
And faster and faster his beads did
he tell,
As loud r and louder, drawing near,
The gnawing by their teeth he could
hear.
And in at the windows, and in at the
door,
And through the walls helter-skelter
they pour,
And down from the ceiling, and up
from the floor,
From the right and the left, from
behind and before,
From within and without, from above
and below;
And all at once to the Bishop they go
They have whetted their teeth against
the stones,
And now they pick the Bishop’s bones:
They gnawed the flesh from every
limb,
For they were sent to do judgment on
him.
R. SOUTHEY.
What Became of Themf
He was a rat, and she was a rat,
And down in one hole they did
dwell,
And both were as black as a witch’s
cat,
And they loved one another well.
He had a tail, and she had a tail,
Both long and curling and fine;
And each said, “ Yours is the finest
tail
In the world, excepting mine.”
He smelt the cheese, and she smelt
the cheese,
And they both pronounced it good;
And both remarked it would greatly
add
To the charms of their daily food.
80 he ventured out, and she ventured
out,
And I saw them go with pain;
But what befel them I never can tell,
For they never came back again.
The Wicked Bishop Hatto.
The summer and autumn had been to
wet
That in winter the corn was growing
jet;
Twas a piteous sight to see all around
The grain lie rotting on the ground.
Every day the starving poor
Crowded around Bishop Hatto’s door,
For all the neighbourhood could tell
His granaries were furnished well.
At last Bishop Hatto appointed a day
To quiet the poor without delay:
He bade them to his great Barn repair
And they should have fond for the
winter there
Rejoiced such tidings good to hear,
The poor folk flocked from far and
near;
So the great Barn was full as it could
hold
Of women and children, and young
and old.
Theu when he saw it could hold no
more,
Bishop Hatto he made fast the door;
And while for mercy with shrieks they
call,
He set fire to the Barn and burnt
them all.
* A rare and excellent bonfirel’
quoth he,
“ And the country is greatly obliged
to me,
For ridding it in these times forlorn
Of Rats that only consume the corn.”
6
So then to his palace returned he,
And he sat down to supper merrily,
And he slept that night like an
innocent man; —
Rut li.ahop Hatto never slept again.
RATS CARRYING HOME AN EGG

MOUSEY LAND.
The Gingerbread Cat
A baby-trirl, on Christmas night,
Had filled her little apron white
With all a happy child could take
Of Christmas toys and Christmas cake;
But on the stairway she let fall
The chiefest treasure of them all—
A little cat of gingerbread
All frosted white from tail to head.
Now in the moonlit midnight time,
When merry mice do run and climb,
A plump gray mouse caftie down the
stair
And saw the Christmas cake-cat there.
She stood still in her cruel fright
And gazed upon the monster white
Who seemed to feel as great surprise,
And stared with both his raisin eyes.
Poor mousie dared not, could not stirl
Her little brain was in a whirrl
Five minutes—ten—but not a paw
Had puss put forth! “ I never saw
A cat like this!” the poor mouse said.
A brave bold thought came in her
head—
Her wee heart beating pit-a-pat,
She moved her own paw—touched the
cat—
Then sprang upon it with a squeal
And made a most delicious meal,
“ Ho! ho!” she cried, •* Sugar! spice!
And everything that’s good and nice—
That’s what cats are made of,
The cats that we’re afraid of!"
Then up the stairs she madly pranced,
And o’er the attic floor she danqed.
A»d then she stood upon her head
And to her ’stonished friends she said,
** O, joy to every mouse and rat,
far I have eaten up the catf
The Mice.
The mice are in their holes,
And there they hide by day;
But when ’tis still at night,
They all come out to play.
They climb up on the shelves,
And taste of all they please;
They drink the milk and cream,
And eat the bread and cheese.
But if they hear the cat,
At once they stop their fun;
In frigb' they seek their holes
As as they can run.
Three Mice.
Three Mice went into
A hole to spin,
Puss came by,
Puss peeped in;
What are you doing,
My little old men?
We’re weaving coat#
For gentlemen.
Shall I come and help you
To wind up your threads?
Oh, no, Mrs. Pussy,
You’d bite off our heads!
Says Pussy, “ You are
So wondrous wise,
1 love your whiskers
And round black eyes;
Your house is the prettiest
House I see,
And I think there is room
For you and me.”
The mice were so pleased
That they opened the door,
And Pussy soon laid them
All dead on th» floor
“Run Mousey, Run!”
I am sitting by the fireside,
Reading, and very still,
There comes a little sharp-eyed mouse,
And run about he will.
He flies along the mantelpiece
He darts beneath the fender;
It’s just as well that Jane’s not here,
Or into fits he’d send her.
And now he’s nibbling at some cake
She left upon the table,
He seems to think I’m somebody
To hurl a mouse unable.
Run, mousie, run! I hear the cat,
She’s scratching at the door,
Once she comes in. you’ll have no
chance
Beneath her savage claw.
Run, mousey, run! 1 hear Jane’s foot,
She’s coming up to bed,
If puss but makes a spring at you
Poor mousey, you’ll be dead!
A Mouse Caught in a Cage.
I’m only a poor little mouse, ma’am!
I live in the wall of your house, ma'am!
With a fragment of cheeee, and a very
few peas,
I was having a little carouse, ma’am!
No mischief at all I intend, ma'am!
I hope you will act as my friend,
ma’am!
If my life you should take, many hearts
it would break,
And the trouble would be without end,
ma'am!
My wife live# in there in the crack,
ma'am!
She’s waiting for me to come back,
ma’am!
She hoped I might find a bit of a rind,
Or the children their dinner will lack,
ma’am;
I never was given to strife, ma’am!
(Don't look at that terrible knife,
ma’am!)
The noise overhead that disturbs you
in bed,
’T is the rats, I will venture my life,
ma'am!
In your eyes 1 see mercy I’m sure,
ma’am!
Oh, there’s no need to open the door,
ma’am!
I’ll slip through the crack, and I’ll
never come back,
Oh I’ll never come back any more,
ma’am!
The Foolish Mouse.
In a crack, near the cupboard,
With dainties provided,
A certain young mouse
With her mother resided;
So securely they lived,
In that snug, quiet spot,
Any mouse in the land
Might have envied their lot.
But one day the young mouse,
Which was given to roam,
Having made an excursion
Some way from her home,
On a sudden returned,
With such joy in her eyes,
That her grey, sedate parent
Expressed some surprise,
“ Oh mother,” said she,
“ The good folks of this house
I’m convinced, have not any
111-will to a mouse;
And those tales can’t be true
You always are telling,
For they’ve been at such pains
To construct us a dwelling.
The floor is of wood,
And the walls are of wires.
Exactly the size that
One’s comfort requires;
And I’m sure that we there
Shall have nothing to fear,
If ten cats, with kittens,
At once should appear.
“ And then they have made
Such nice holes in the wall.
One could slip in and out,
With no trouble at all;
But forcing one through
Such rough crannies as these,
Always gives one’s poor ribs
A most terrible squeeze.
“ But the best of all is,
They’ve provided, as well,
A large piece of cheese,
Of most exquisite smell;
’Twas so nice, I had put
In my head to go through,
When I thought it my duty
To come and fetch you."
“ Ah, child,” said the mother,
“ Believe, 1 entreat,
Both the cage and the cheese
Are a terrible cheat;
Do not think all that trouble
They took for our good,
They would catch us, and kill us
All there, if they could.
“ Thus they’ve caught and killed
scores,
And I never could learn,
That a mouse who once entered
Did ever return.”
Let young people mind
What the old people say.
And, when danger it near them,
Keep out of the way.


HELPING THEIR COMRADE OUT.
A Clever and Good Mother
Mouse.
One Summer day the sun shone bright,
Mid sweet flowers roved the bee,
And 1 wandered in a garden old
Beside the deep blue sea.
But close at hand, a shady path
Beneath some beech trees wound,
And there, that sultry summer day,
A pleasant seat I found.
Suddenly, just beside my chair,
A little sound I heard;
A scratch upon the gravel path,
As of a mouse or bird.
I turned my head; there, on the path,
What strange sight did I see!
A little mouse, and in her mouth
Another still more wee.
Softly she crept across the path,
And then, her juurney done,
In a hole beneath the green grass verge
She laid her little one.
And back and forth from side to side,
I watched her carry five
Sweet little mice, her own dear brood,
Long tailed, and all alive.
She never wearied in her work,
Yet ohl so small was she!
And thus, that bright, hot summer day
She moved her nursery.
Dear mother mouse! My verse has told
Your patient loving deed; £
Methinks our boys and girls may learn
Seme le*»ons as they read.
FRAKCIS E. COOKE.
The True History of a
Poor Little Mouse.
A poor little mouse
Had once made him a nest.
And he fancied, the warmest.
And safest, and best,
That a poor little mouse could enjoy;
So snug, so convenient,
So out of the way,
This poor little mouse
And his family lay,
They fear’d neither pussy nor boy.
It was in a stove
That was seldom in use,
Where shavings and papers
Were scattered in loose, [hole;
That this poor little mouse ma lt his
But alas! Master Johnny
Had seen him one day,
As in a great fright
He had scamper’d away,
With a piece of plum pudding he stole.
As soon as young Johnny
(Who, wicked and bad,
No pitiful thoughts
For dumb animals had)
Descried the poor fellow’s retreat,
He crept to the shavings
And set them alight,
And, before the poor mouse
Could run off in its fright,
It was smother’d to death in the heatl
Poor mousel how it squeak’d
1 can’t bear to relate,
Nor how its poor little
Ones hopp’d in the grate,
And died, one by one, in the flame!
I should not much wonder
To hear, that, some night,
This wicked boy’s bed-curtains
Catching alight,
He suffered exactly the same.
ANN TAYLOR.
The Mouse’s CalL
A little mouse crept out one day,
When all was still about;
To dollie’s house he took his way,
The lady being out.
He skipped about with bead-bright
eyes
From table down to chair;
He thought the house was just the size
For him to settle there.
He found some jelly cake so nice,
This naughty little mouse;
He nibbled first, then in a trice
’Twas gone from dollie s house.
He curl’d himself upon the floor,
To have a little nap,
When suddenly upon the floor
There came a fearful rap.
The mouse who had not left a crumb,
With fear began to shake,
For dollie’s mistress back had come
To get her piece of cake.
She opened wide the little house,
Her doll lay on her arm.
And when she spied the trembling
mouse
She cried out with alarm.
She tumbled back upon the ground,
Her dear doll falling too,
While the mouse went rushing round,
Not knowing what to do.
At last he tumbled down the stair,
Then to his hole he flew;
And which did most the other scare
They never, never knew.
MOUSEY LAND.


FROGGY LAND.
The Foolish Frogs.
In a tank at the foot of the hill
Lived Mr. and Mrs. Frog,
At the head of the sparkling rill,
By the side of a queachy bog;
And they had children ten—
All froggies as yellow as gold,
Who loved to play on the fen,
But they often were over-bold.
Now it fell out one bright day,
As it never had done before,
When Father Frog was away
A stickleback sailed to the door.
“ Oh I Mrs. Frog,” said he,
“Your sister is very ill;
And much she wishes to see
You down at the water mill.”
Then Mother Frog showed her grief
In such tears as you never saw;
And, having no handkerchief,
She wiped her eyes with a paw.
Said she, “ Now, froggies dear,
You must not go to the fen:
There is no danger here,
And I’ll soon come back again I”
But the naughty little froggies,
Disobeyed their mother and went.
Then a duck, which had lazily swum
For hours in a reedy pool,
Seeing the shadows come,
And feeling the air grow cool,
With a ‘Quack, quack, quack,’ came out.
She meant, “ It is time to sup!”
So finding the froggies about,
She gobbled them quickly up.
So Mr, and Mrs. Frog,
By the peeping stars made bold,
Came back by the queachy bog.
To their froggies all yellow as gold.
They never saw them again—
Alas! that it i sould be so.
They were told sot to go to the fen;
But they did tot obey, you know.
"EARLY DAYS."
Marriage of Hr. Froggie.
There was a Frog
Lived in a bog—
A F rog of high degree—
A stylish youth,
And yet, forsooth,
A bachelor was he.
He had not wed
Because, he said,
He’d ne’er in all bis life
Seen in the bog
A pollywog
He cared to make his wife
But one fine day,
When drest up gay,
He passed a pretty house,
And there beside
The window spied
A most attractive mouse.
He raised his hat,
And gazing at
Miss Mouse, in suit of gray,
He made a bow,
Likewise a vow
To marry her straightway.
When he was drest
In scarlet vest,
And coat of velvet sheen.
With frills of lace,
And sword in place,
His like was nowhere seen
His smile was bland,
His style so grand,
He said with pride, “ I know
Miss Mouse so fair,
Can find nowhere
So suitable a beau!
“ If she’ll agree
To live with me,
And be my faithful wife,
Ob, she shall dine
On dishes fine,
And lead an easy life,"
When he went by,
Miss Mouse, so shy,
Would hide her blushing face;
But truth to tell
Could see quite well
Through curtains of thin lacs.
And from her nook,
Aht many a look
She gave, with heart a-stir;
And oft did she
Confess that he
Was just the beau for her.
At last so bine
Poor froggie grew,
He went up to the house
And rang the bell,
In haste to tell
His love for Mistress Mouse.
He passed the door,
And on the floor
He knelt and kissed her hand;
“ Wilt marry mef"
He asked, while she
Her burning blushes fanned.
She answered “ Yes,”
As you may guess,
To Mister Frog’s delight;
His arm he placed
Around her waist,
And joy was at its height
The wedding-day
Was set straightway,
The town was all agog;
And gifts, not few,
Were sent unto
Miss Mouse and Frog
And never yet
Was banquet set,
In country or in town,
With fare more rich
Than that to which
The wedding guests sat down.
And, after all,
There was the ball,
For which the band was hired,
And frogs and mice
Were up in a trice,
And danced till their toes were tired.
Frogs at School.
Twenty froggie* went to school,
Down beside a rushy pool;
Twenty little coats of green,
Twenty vests all white and clean.
“ We must be in time,” said they;
“ First we study, then we play;
That is how we keep the rule
When we froggies go to school.”
Master Bullfrog, grave and stern,
Called the classes in their turn;
Taught them how to nobly strive,
Likewise how to leap and dive;
From his seat upon the log
Showed them how to say, ‘‘Ker-chogl”
Also, how to dodge a blow
From the sticks which bad boys throw
Twenty froggies grew up fast;
Bullfrogs they became at last;
Not one dunce among the lot,
Not one lesson they forgot.
Polished in a high degree,
As each froggie ought to be,
Now they sit on other logs,
Teaching other little frogs.
FLYING FROG.
A KIND HUSBAND.


Mouse that Lost her Tail.
Once upon a time a Cat and Mouse were play-
ing together, when, quite by accident, the Cat
bit off the Mouse's tail.
It was very strange that the Cat did not bite
off the Mouse’s head. But this Mouse was a
good Mouse, and never stole any cheese; and
so the Cat only bit off her tail. Mousey was
very much vexed to see that her tail was gone,
so she said to Pussy—
“Oh, dear Pussy I do give me my tail again.”
“No, that I will not,” said Pussy, “till you
get me some milk for my breakfast.”
“Oh, the Cow will give me some,” said the
Mouse.
So she frisked and jumped, and then she ran
Till she came to the Cow, and thus began:
“Please, Cow, give me some milk. I want
to give Pussy milk, and Pussy will give me my
own tail again.”
“So I will, Mousey, if you get me some hay
for my breakfast,” said the Cow
“ Oh, the farmer will give me some," said
the Mouse.
So she frisked and jumped, and then she
ran
Till she came to the farmer, and thus
began:—
” Please, Mr. Farmer, give me some hay ;
I want to give the Cow hay. The Cow will
give me some milk ; I will give Pussy milk ;
and Pussy will give me my own tail again.”
“ So I will, Mousey, if you get me some
bread for my breakfast,” said the Farmer.
”Oh. the Baker will give me some," said
the Mouse.
So she frisked and jumped, and then she
ran
Till she came to the Baker, and thus
began:—
"Please, Mr. Baker, give me some bread ;
I want to give the Farmer bread. The
Farmer will give me some hay; I will give
the Cow hay; the cow will give me some
milk; I will give Pussy milk; and Pussy
will give me my own tail again.”
So I will. Mousey, if you get me some
meat for my breakfast," said the baker.
“Oh, the Butcher will give me some,"
said the Mouse.
So she frisked and jumped, and then she
ran
Till she came to the Butcher, and thus
began:—
“Please, Mr. Butcher, give me some meat;
I want to give the Baker meat. The Baker
will give me some bread ; I will give the
Farmer bread; the Farmer will give me some
hay; I will give the Cow hay; the Cow will
give me some milk; I will give Pussy milk,
and Pussy will give me my own tail again.”
“ So I will, Mousey, if you'll eat up the
crumbs that have fallen at my breakfast.”
said the Butcher.
” Oh, that 1 will," said the Mouse ; and she
soon cleared the floor of every crumb.
Then the Butcher gave the Mouse some meat,
and the Mouse gave the Baker the meat, and
the Baker gave the Mouse some bread, and the
Mouse gave the Farmer the bread, and the
Farmer gave the Mouse some hay, and the
Mouse gave the Cow the hay, and the Cow gave
the Mouse some milk, and the Mouse gave
Pussy the Milk, and then Pussy gave poor little
Mousey her own tail again.
And she frisked and jumped, and away she
ran
And cried out to Pussy, “Catch me if you can!”
Mouse Gruel.
There was an Old Person of Ewell,
Who chiefly subsisted on gruel;
But to make it taste nice, he inserted some mice,
Which refreshed that Old Person of Ewell
Wise Mice.
Some little mice sat in a barn to spin;
Pussy came by and she popped her head in :
"Shall I come in and cut your threads off? "
“ Oh, no. kind sir, you will bite our heads off I "
Mouse Ran up the Clock.
Hickory, diccory, dock.
The mouse ran up the clock,
The clock struck one, the mouse ran down,

A Frog he would a-Wooing Go.
A Frog he would a-wooing go,
Whether his mother would have it or no;
So off he set with his nice new hat,
And on the road he met with a rat.
/
“ Pray, Mr. Rat, will you go with me,
Kind Mrs. Mousey for to see ! ’’
When they came to the door of Mousey's hall,
They gave a loud knock, and gave a loud call.
“ Pray, Mrs. Mouse, are you within?”
Oh, yes, kind sirs, I'm sitting to spin."
"Pray, Mrs. Mouse, will you give us some beer ?
For Froggy and I are fond of good cheer.”
“ Pray, Mr. Frog, will you give us a song—
But let it be something that’s not very long! ”
“ Indeed, Mrs. Mouse,” replied the Frog,
” A cold has made me as hoarse as a dog.”
Since you have a cold, Mr. Frog,” Mousey said,
” 111 sing you a song that I have just made ; ”
But while they were all a merry-making,
A cat and her kittens came tumbling in.
The cat she seized the rat by the crown;
The kittens they pulled the little mouse down.
This put Mr. Frog in a terrible fright:
He took up his hat, and wished them good-night.
But as Froggy was crossing over a brook,
A lily-white duck came and gobbled him up
So there was an end of one, two. and three.

Three Blind Mice.
Three blind mice! three blind mice I
See how they run ! see how they runl
They all ran after the farmer’s wife.
They cut off their tails with a carving knife ;
Did you ever see such a thing in your life
As three blind mice ?
The Three Unfortunate Mice.
Three little dogs were basking in the cinders;
Three little cats were playing in the windows;
Three little mice hopped out of a hole,
And a piece of cheese they stole:
The three little cats "jumped down in a trice,
And cracked the bones of the three little mice.

MTXED ANIMAL LAND.
The Fox and the Cat.
The fox and the cat as they travelled one day,
With moral discourses cut shorter the way ;
“ 'Tis great,” says the fox, “ to make justice our
guide 1 ”
“ How godlike is mercy I ’’ Grimalkin replied.
Whilst thus they proceeded, a wolf from the
wood,
Impatient of hunger, and thirsting for blood,
Rushed forth—as he saw the dull shepherd
asleep—
And seized for his supper an innocent sheep.
“ In vain, wretched victim, for mercy you bleat;
When mutton’s at hand,” says the wolf, “I
must eat.”
Grimalkin's astonished—the fox stood aghast,
To see the fell beast at his bloody repast.
“What a wretch I ” says the cat—“ 'tis the vilest
of brutes ;
Does he feed upon flesh when there’s herbage
and roots ? ”
Cries the fox, “ While our oaks give us acorns
so good,
What a tyrant is this to spill innocent blood ! ”
Well, onward they marched, and they moralized
still,
Till they came where some poultry picked chaff
by a mill.
Sly Reynard surveyed them with gluttonous eyes,
And made, spite of morals, a pullet his prize I
A mouse, too, that chanced from her covert to
stray,
The greedy Grimalkin secured as her prey 1
A spider that sat in her web on the wall,
Perceived the poor victims, and pitied their fall;
Hhe cried, “Of such murders how guiltless am 11”
Bo ran to regale on a new-taken fly 1
Sour Grapes.
A fox was trotting on one day,
And just above his head
He spied a vine of luscious grapea
Rich and purple red;
Eager he tried to snatch the fruit,
But, ah! it was too high;
Poor Reynard had to give it up,
And, heaving a deep sigh,
He curl’d his nose and said, “Dear me.
I would not waste an hour
Upon such mean and common fruit—
I’m sure those grapes are sourl”
'Tis thus we often wish thro’ life,
When seeking wealth and pow’r
And when we fail, say, like the fox,
We’re “ sure the grapes are sourl"
The Fox and the Mask.
A fox walked round a toyman’s shop
(How he came there, pray do not ask),
But soon he made a sudden stop,
To look and wonder at a mask.
The mask was beautiful and fair,
A perfect mask as e’er was made :
And which a lady meant to wear
At the ensuing masquerade.
He turned it round with much surprise,
To find it prove so light and thin ;
“ How strange I ” astonished Reynard cries,
“Here’s mouth and nose, and eyes and chin,
“ And cheeks and lips, extremely pretty ;
And yet. one thing there still remains
To make it perfect—what a pity,
So fine a head should have no brains I ”
Thus, to some boy or maiden pretty ;
Who to gel learning takes no pains,
May we exclaim, “Ah I what a pity,
Bo fine a head should have no brains I ”
The Fox and Crow.
In a dairy a crow,
Having ventured to go,
Some food for her young ones to seek,
Flew up in the trees
With a fine piece of cheese,
Which she joyfully held in her beak.
A fox who lived by,
To the tree saw her fly,
And to share in the prize made a vow;
For, having just dined,
He for cheese felt inclined,
So he went and sat under the bough.
She was cunning he knew,
But so was he too,
And with flattery adapted his plan ;
For he knew if she’d speak,
It must fall from her beak,
So, bowing politely, began :
“ ’Tis a very fine day,’’
(Not a word did she say),
“The wind, I believe, ma’am, is south ;
A fine harvest for peas ; ”
He then looked at the cheese,
But the crow did not open her mouth.
Sly Reynard, not tired,
Her plumage admired :
“How charming! how brilliant its huel
The voice must be fine
Of a bird so divine,
Ah, let me just hear it, pray do.
Believe me, I long
To hear a sweet song ; ’’
The silly crow foolishly tries ;
She scarce gave one squall,
When the cheese she let fall,
And the fox ran away with the prize.
JANE TAYLOR.
The Blind Men and the
Elephant.
[a HINDOO FABLB.]
It was six men of Indostan
To learning much inclined,
Who went to see the elephant
(Though all of them were blind),
That each by observation
Might satisfy his mind
The First approached the Elephant,
And happening to fall
Against his broad and sturdy side,
At once began to bawl ;
“ Ood bless me I —but the Elephant
Is very like a wall I "
The SECOND feeling of the tusk,
Cried : “ Ho I what have we here
So very round and smooth and sharp f
To me ’tis mighty clear
This wonder of an Elephant
Is very like a spear 1 ”
The Third approached the animal,
And happening to take
The squirming trunk within his hands,
Thus boldly up and spake ;
“ I see,” quoth he, “ the Elephant
Is very like a snake I "
The Fourth reached out his eager hand.
And felt about the knee,
“ What most this wondrous beast is like
Is mighty plain,” quoth he ;
“ ’Tis clear enough the Elephant
Is very like a tree I ”
The Fifth, who chanced to touch the eat,
Said : “ E’en the blindest man
Can tell what this resembles most,
Deny the fact who can,
This marvel of an Elephant
Is very like a fan.”
The Sixth no sooner had begun
About the beast to grope,
Than, seizing on the swinging tail
That fell within his scope,
“ I see, quoth he, “ the Elephant
Is ve r y like a rope !’’
And so these men of Indostan
Disputed loud and long,
Each in his own opinion
Exceeding stiff and strong,
Though each was partly in the right,
And all were in the wrong.
ELEPHANT TAKING TEA.


An Address to a Mouse.
Sly little, cowering, timorous txastie 1
Oh what a panic’s in thy breastie I
You need not start away so hasty,
With bickering speed :
I should be loth to run and chase thee,
I should indeed I
I’m truly sorry man’s dominion
Hath broken Nature’s social union,
And justifies that ill opinion
Which makes thee startle
At me, thy poor earth-born companion,
And fellow mortal.
Sometimes, I doubt not, thou dost thieve;
What then \ poor beastie, thou must live;
A little barley in the shieve
Is small request;
And all thou tak’st, I do believe,
Will ne’er be missed.

Song of the Toad.
I am a honest toad,
Living here by the road ;
Beneath a stone I dwell,
In a snug little cell.
When the rain patters down,
1 let it wet my crown ;
And now and then I sip
A drop with my lip.
And now 1 catch a fly,
And now I wink my eye,
And now I take a hop,
And now and then I stop.
And this is all 1 do,
And yet they say it’s true
That the toad's face is sad,
And his bite is very bad.
Oh I naughty folks they be
Who tell such tales of me I
For I’m a honest toad
Just living by the road,
Hip, hip hop.
Mosquito Song.
In a summer s night I lake my flight
To where the maidens repose ; [sound,
And while they are slumbering sweet and
1 bite them on the nose :
The warm red blood that tints their cheeks,
To me is precious dear,
For ’tis my delight to buzz and bite
In the season of the year.
When 1 get my fill, 1 wipe my bill,
And sound my tiny horn ;
And off 1 fly to the mountain high
Ere breaks the golden morn ;
But at eve I sally forth again
To tickle the sleeper’s ear ;
For ’tis my delight to buzz and bite
In the season of the year
On the chamber wall about 1 crawl,
Till landlord goes to bed ;
Then my bugle I blow, and down I go
To light upon his hea l.
Oh, I love to see the fellow sUn.
And regret to hear him swear ;
For ’tis my del-ght to bun and bit*
la ths mki A the year.
The Nightingale and
Glow-worm.
A Nightingale, that all day long
Had cheered the village with his song,
Nor yet at eve his note suspended,
Nor yet when eventide was ended,
Began to feel, —as well he might,—
The keen demands of appetite ;
When looking eagerly around,
He spied, far off, upon the ground,
A something shining in the dark,
And knew the glow-worm by his spark ;
So, stooping down, from hawthorn top,
He thought to put him in his crop.
The worm, aware of his intent,
Harangued him thus, quite eloquent—
“ Did you admire my lamp,” quoth he,
“ As much as 1 your minstrelsy,
You would abhor to do me wrong,
As much as P to spoil your song ;
For ’twas the self-same power divine
Taught you to sing, and me to shine :
That you with music, I with light,
Might beautify and cheer the night.’’
The songster heard his short oration,
And, warbling out his approbation,
Released him as my story tells,
And found a supper somewhere else.
COWPER.
The Glow-Worm.
Beneath this hedge, or near the stream,
A worm is known to stray,
That shows oy night a lucid stream
That disappears by day.
Disputes have been, and still prevail,
From whence his rays proceed ;
Some give tne honor to his tail,
And others to his head ;
But this is sure, —the hand of might
That kindles up the skies,
Gives him a modicum of light,
Proportion’d to his size.
Perhaps indulgent Nature meant,
By such a lamp bestow’d
To bid the traveller as he went,
Be careful where he trod.
COWPER.
Happiness of the
Grasshopper.
Happv insect I what can be
In happiness compared with thee f
Fed with nourishment divine,
The dewy morning’s gentle wine :
Nature waits upon thee still,
And thy verdant cup does fill.
All the fields which thou dost see,
All the plants belong to thee :
All that summer hours produce,
Fertile made with easy juice ;
The country hinds with gladness hear,
Prophet of the ripened year 1
COWLKT.
The Whale.
Warm and buoyant, in his oily mail,
Gambols on seas of ice th’ unwieldly whale ;
Wide waving fins round floating islands urge
His bulk gigantic through the troubled surge ;
With hideous yawn, the flying shoals he seeks,
Or clasps with fringe of horn his massy cheeks;
Lifts o’er the tossing wave his nostril bare,
And spouts the watery columns into air ;
The s.lvcry arches catch the setting beams,
And transient rainbows tremble o’er the streams.
DARWIN
The Wasp and the Bee.
A wasp met a bee that was just buzzing by,
And he said* "Little cousin, can you tell me why
You are loved so much better by people than 1.
•• My back shines as bright, and as yellow as gold,
And my shape is most elegant too to behold,
And yet nobody likes me for that, I am told,"
Bz.
" Ah 1 cousin,’’ the bee said, “ ’tis all very true,
But if I were half as much mischief to do,
Then I’m sure they would love me no better
than you.
Bz
“ You have a fine shape and a delicate wing,
And they say you are handsome ; but then
there’s one thing
They never can put up with ; and that is your
sting.
Bz.
“ My coat is quite homely and plain, as you see,
But yet no one is angry or scolding at me,
Just because I’m a harmless and busy bee,”
Bz.
From this little stcry 14c, people beware,
For if, like the cross wasp, ill-natured they are,
They will never be loved, though they’re ever so
fair
My Pets.
I bring my little doggies milk;
I bring my rabbits hay;

They roll about and play;
They’ve milk and bones, and all they
want—
Such happy pets are theyl
KRRAND BOY DELIVERING ANIMALS.
MIXED AN L LAND.


FUNNY AUSTRALIAN NATIVES.
The Kangaroo is the largest native animal in Australia.
He is about 5 feet high when he sits up, he has a head some-
what like a rabbit’s, his hands or fore feet are small but his
hind feet are large, and he has a very large thick tail. He ran
kick and tear with his sharp hind claws in a very dangerous
manner. He frequently kills dogs with his claws, but, when
he is chased by dogs, if he is near water he makes for if and
often drowns the dogs if they come into the water after him.
He leaps or hops about 15 feet at a time and goes very fast.
The mother carries her young in a pouch, as seen in the
picture, and when the baby kangaroos are frightened they
run at once into their mother’s pouch for safety, like any
other babies running to their mother.
AUSTRALIAN NATIVE CAT.
It U & nild Cat. generally brown or black with many large
and email white spots on it. It lives upon small animals in-
cluding birds and their eggs, and is a grant pest to farmers
killing their poultry
The Emu live* upon vegetable food such as fruits, roots, and grass. It
has great curiosity and is easily tamed. It is very inoffensive except when
it is violently attacked ; then it kicks like a horse. It is said that its kick
will break a man's leg. Its flesh is eaten by the natives and is said to look
and taste like beef. It can run very fast. It lays from 6to 12 dark green
coloured eggs and its young are pretty little striped things as in the above
picture. It is, next to the Ostrich, the largest bird in the world, being sor 6
feet high, its colour is a mixture of grey and brown, and its voice has a
low booming sound. It is generally coupled with the Kangaroo in the
Australian Arms.
PLATYPUS.
The Platypus ii sometimes called the Water Mole. It is, perhaps, the
most wonderful animal in the world in its combination, being part bird,
part beast, part fish. It has a bill like a duck ; five toes with claws and
webbed-feet; it is covered with thick glossy fur like a seal ; it has cheek
pouches like a monkey to keep its food in; it lays two eggs ; its voice
resembles that of a young puppy, and the young platypuses play like
puppies ; it lives in rivers and makes burrows often 2# or 30 feet long ; it
feeds a poo water insect* shell fish, etc

NATIVE BEAR.
The Australian Native Bear is a dear little harmless fellow,
and is easily tamed He lives in the gum trees, feeds upon
gum leaves, and loves his mother who carries him on her
back and is very fond of him. He has a thick fluffy coat,
big bushy ears, and no tail. He cries like a child if he misses
his mother They cry very pathetically if they are wounded,
which they frequently are in the bush, by cruel wicked boys
and men who think it is sport to shoot at the poor harmless
creatures.
LYRE BIRD.
The Australian Lyre Bird is a most beautiful creature,
said to be a variety of the Bird of Paradise. It runs very
quickly, and springs very high, and calls very loudly. It lays
but one egg a year and, consequently, only has one baby
per annum. It is a great mimic. Mr Metcalfe in his
"Australian Zoology,” describing it, says: "It is a con-
summate mimic and ventriloquist. It imitates to perfection
the notes of all other birds, the united voices of a flock of
parrakeets, the barking of dogs, the sawing of timber and the
clink of the woodman's axe Thus it has earned for itself
the title of the Australian Mocking Bird."

I always come down with a great big thump

Common people call me simply Mr. PLATYPUS,
Learned people call me Mr. OR-NI-THO-RINK-KUS

BOWER BIRD.
The Australian Bower Bird is an extensive builder; it not only builds its
nest in a tree but it builds a palace on the ground in the shape of a bower
hut, furnishes it with nick-nacks such as shells, bones, pieces of mineral,
metals, bright parrots’ feathers and other trifles. What the English magpie
would steal and hide away the Bovver Bird openly decorates his pavilion
with. Often several birds collect together and play like children, running
in, out, and around their wonderful bower-palace as shown in our picture.


Kindness to Animals.
Power of Kindneii to Animals.
Thousands of pathetic tales could be
told of the sufferings of poor dumb animals
and the sympathy of some kind human
souls for them. The following one is from
the Secretary of a Humane Society:—
The wife of a small country farmer wrote
to me: “I can’t bear sending the cattle to
market. 1 always keep out of the way,
for every animal on the place knows me,
and they look at me so sadly, and, knowing
what they’re going to, I feel sometimes
.that I’d rather give the whole thing up,
than go on rearing them to be knocked
about, and abused, and killed.
“ I went to market once myself to see a
young beast sold, but I’ll never go again.
I had fed it with my own hands every day,
till it was like a child. I went to the
market-town by train, and the young bul-
lock was driven by road. I walked a little
way out to meet it, and at last met it
coming tramping along, and the drover
told me he had had the greatest difficulty
to get it along the last few miles; it had
become so tired. You sec it had not had
much exercise, as when you are fattening
things, it does not do to let them run about
too much, or they’ll ‘run all the meat off
their bones’ again, as the saying is.
“When I went to Smithficld, I was
ready to faint as I saw the men shouting,
and swearing, and slashing away with
thick sticks. The poor things were so
confused and knocked about that they
didn’t know what to do, and I went up to
the man who seemed to be in charge of
the pens that our auctioneer was going to
sell from, and asked him if he would be
kind to my poor bullock when it came.
He only cursed it and laughed a mocking
laugh, and said,‘Oh yes, it, I’ll be
entle with it. You wait, missis, and see!
Do you think I’m here to coddle any
beasts? If you do, you’re well mis-
taken.’
“ I couldn’t bear to see what would
happen, I couldn’t stand it, so I went
away, and then the men (dealers) simply
stood and talked, and haggled with the
farmers; and the drovers shouted and
yelled, and hooted, and knocked the things
about, and hit them on the nose and over
the eyes, and poked and prodded them with
sharp pointed sticks; and the dogs yapped
and barked, and I never heard a single
word of pity, or saw a sign of pity for the
poor, tired, bruised, panting, and terrified
creatures.
“it was a torribiy hot day, aod I wan
dered about the town all the afternoon,
able to think of little else than of my poor
bullock, and of what had become of it,
when, as I was going to the station to
my train, I met three or four cattle coming
driven along Suddenly one of them
caught sight of me, and in spite of all the
men could do came rushing up towards me.
It was my poor bullock ; but, oh, so ter-
ribly altered. I should hardly have
known it.
“It seemed beside itself with joy to see me, and
stood by me lowing so pitifully, as much as to
say, ‘Oh, I'm so glad I've found you! 1 know
I'm safe now, and you won't let these awful men
carry me off again !'
“At last they managed to get it to move
on by flogging it savagely, and heart-sick
and conscience-smitten I went to the
station; and when I got the money that it
was sold for it seemed to me like ‘ the price
of blood.’ But what can I do?
“I suppose the proper thing is to get
hardened and think nothing about it, like
other people, but it is so dreadful that I
can never go to market to see another of
my poor beasts sold.”
Kind Miss Cobbe.
■ Miss Frances Power Cobbe gave herseif, heart
■and soul, to the defence of animals, not because
she loved them more than human beings, but be-
cause she could not bear to see men acting wickedly
towards them, nor to hear the groans of their
helpless victim*
In the account of her life, written by herself, she
says; "It is not the four legs nor the silky or
shaggy coat of a dog which should prevent us
from discerning his inner nature of thought and
love; limited thought, it is true, but an unlimited
love That he is dumb, is to me only another claim
(as it would be in a human child) on my considera-
tion. .. . Another dog. whom I sent away at one year
old to live in the country, was returned to me
eight years afterwards old and diseased. The poor
beast knew me again after a few moments’ eager
examination, and uttered an actual scream of joy
when I called her by name, exhibiting every token
of tender affection for me ever afterwards ”
In her book entitled "Dogs whom I have Met,”
she says: "The dog who really loves his master
delights in mere propinquity, likes to lie down on
the floor resting against his feet, better than on a
cushion a yard away, and after a warm interchange
of caresses for two or three minutes asks no more,
and subsides into perfect contentment. That a
short tender touch of the dog’s tongue to hand or
face corresponds exactly, as an expression of his
feelings, to our kisses of affection, there can be no
sort of doubt. All dogs kiss the people they love.”
Tennyson when on a visit to Miss Cobbe, bade
her go bravely on as she had begun, and "fight the
good fight”; by which he meant the warfare
against cruelty in which she was engaged After
his death it was sad to hear the wail of three dogs,
a collie, a Scotch terrier, and a Russian wolf-hound,
constant companions and friends of the poet.

At a Ball Pigbt.
The following is a pathetic narrative
entitled “ El Moro.”
A Cadiz letter says : “Notice had been
posted on all the public places that on a
certain day the bull called ‘EI Moro ’
would be introduced into the arena, and
that, when he should have been goaded to
the utmost fury, a young girl would appear
and reduce the animal to quiet subjection.
The people of Cadiz had heard of ‘EI
Moro’ as the most magnificent bull ever
brought into the city, and it soon became
known that the girl just advertised was a
peasant girl of Espara, who had petted the
bull, and fed it and cared for it during the
years of its growth. On the appointed day
the vast amphitheatre was filled with an
anxious, eager crowd. Several bulls had
been killed and dragged away, and then
the flourish of trumpets announced the
coming of the hero of the day. With a
deep, terrific roar ‘EI Moro’ enteied upon
the scene. He was truly magnificent; a
bovine monarch, black and glossy, with
eyes of fire, dilating nostrils, and wicked-
looking horns. The picadores attacked him
warily, hurling their banderillos (small,
dart-like javelins ornamented with ribbons,
and intended to jade and infuriate). The
bull had killed three horses ofthand, and
had received eight banderillos in his neck
and shoulders, when, upon a given signal,
the picadores and matadores suddenly with-
drew, leaving the infuriated beast alone in
his wild paroxysm of wrath. Presently a
soft musical note, like the piping of a lark,
was heard, and directly afterwards a girl
not more than fifteen years of age, in the
tasteful garb of an Andalusian peasant, and
with a pretty face, sprang lightly into the
arena, approaching the bull fearlessly, at
the same time calling his name —‘Moro!
Moro I Ya voy!’ At the first sound of the
sweet voice the animal ceased his fury, and
turned towards the place whence it came,
and, when he saw the girl he plainly
manifested pleasure. She came to his head,
and put forth her hand, which he licked
with his tongue. Then she sang a low,
sweet song, at the same time caressing the
animal by patting him on the forehead, and,
while she sang, the suffering monarch
kneeled at her feet. Then she stooped and
gently removed the cruel banderillos, after
which, with her arms around ‘EI Moro’s’
neck she led him towards the gate of the
torril.”

SQUIRREL LAND.
The Squirrel.
Pm a merry, merry squirrel,
All day I leap and whirl
Through my home in the old beech-tree
If you chase me 1 will run
In the shade and in the sun ;
But you never, never can catch me.
For round a bough i’ll creep,
Playing hide and seek so sly ;
Or through the leaves bo-pt-ep,
With my little shining eye.
Dp and down 1 run and frisk.
With my bushy tail to whisk
All who mope in the old beech-trees
How droll to see the owl
As I make him wink and growl,
While his sleepy, sleepy head I lease I
And I waken up the bat.
Who flies off with a scream ,
For he thinks that I’m the cat
Pouncing on him, in his dream
Through all the summer long
I never want a song
From birds in the old beech-trees
I have singers all the night,
And with the morning bright
Come my busy, humming, fat, brown bees
When I’ve nothing else to do.
With the nursing birds I sit ;
And we laugh at the cuckoo
A-coo-cooing to her tit I
When winter comes with snow,
And its cruel tempests blow
All my leaves from the old beech-trees,
Then beside the wren and mouse
I furnish up a house,
Where, like a prince, 1 live at case.
What care I for hall or sleet.
With my cozy cap and coat ;
And my tail about my feet,
Or wrapped around my throat 1

The Squirrel.
The pretty red squirrel
Lives up in a tree,
A little blithe creature
As ever can be;
He dwells in the boughs
Where the stock-dove broods,
Far in the shades
Of the green summer woods;
His food is the young
Juicy cones of the pine,
And the milky beech-nut
Is his bread and his wine.
In the joy of his nature
He frisks with a bound
To the topmost twigs,
And then down to the ground.
Then up again like
A winged thing,
And from tree to tree
With a vaulting spring;
Then be sits up aloft,
And looks ragged and queer,
Af if he would say:
“ Ay, follow me herel”
Aud then he grows pettish.
And stamps his foot;
And then with a chatter.
He cracks his nut;
And thus he lives
All the long summer ’trough,
Without either a care
Or a thought of rue.
The Mountain and the
Squirrel.
The mountain and the squirrel
Had a quarrel, [ Prig;”
And the former called the latter "Little

But all sorts of things and weather
Must be taken in together
To make up a year,
And a sphere.
And I think it no disgrace
To occupy my place.
If I’m not so large as you.
You are not so small as 1,
And not half so spry;
I’ll not deny you make
A very pretty squirrel track.
Talents differ; all is well and wisely
put;
If I cannot carry forests on my back,
Neither can you crack a null”

Laughter as a Medicine.
"The physician tells us of the physical bene-
fits of laughing. There is not the remotest
corner or little inlet of the minute blood-vessels
of the human body that does not feel some
wavelet from the convulsion occasioned by
good hearty laughter. The life principle, or
the central man, is shaken to the innermost
depths, sending new tides of life and strength
to the surface, thus materially tending to
insure good health to the persons who indulge
therein The blood moves more rapidly, and
conveys a different impression to all the organs
of the body, as it visits them on that particular
mystic journey when the man is laughing, from
what it does at other times. For this reason,
every good, hearty laugh in which a person
indulges lengthens his life, conveying as it does a
new and distinct stimulm to the vital forces."

made tew praze God, and he can’t dew it by
mourning Awl the mourning there iz in this
wurld was introduced bi man; man warnt made
tew mourn any more than he waz made to crawl,
Tharfore i sa tew awl men and women, stop
crying and go tew laffing, you will last longer,

tew git tew heaven with a smile on your coun-

MOST ASTONISHING CURE OF THE AGE.
Dk»r Sib—Many years ago it was my misfortune to be Jilted in love by a cruel hearted woman. I pined away, and fell imo a bad state of health,
and was advised by my friends to take some physic. 1 never took a single dose except somebody told me that It was exactly what I wanted to make'
me well—l T ’ 1 J "* 1 “
■but it all did me no good. I only got worse and worse until I came across the right thing, which I will presently describe. I find, in looking
over my paid bills, the following are the kinds and quantities of physic I have used during my illness :—Holloway a Pills, 227 boxes; Cockle's Pills,
121 boxes: Beecham's Pills, 80 boxes ; Parr s Life Pills, 76 boxes; Blue PUls, 849 boxes. One friend advised me to give up Pills and take some good
old-fashioned physic. I took of Jalap, 37 pounds; Castor Oil, 180 bottles , Salts and Senna. 300 doses ; Rhubarb and Magnesia, 800 doses; Brimstone
and Treacle, 800 doses—but this did me no good. Another friend advised me to take some world-famed patent medicines, so I took of Eno s Fruit Salt
190 bottles, Warner's Safe Cure, 200 bottles ; Townsend s Sarsaparilla, 120 bottles; Hop Bitters. 180 bottles ; Dandelion Ale, two hogsheads. I took
Hayter s Nerve Tonic, Hayter's Blood Purifier, Hayter's Invigorator, and Hayter s Pick-Me-Up, of each 100 bottles ; and Wolfe's Schnapps, 630 bottles
—but I felt no better. Another friend came along, and said that for my complaint it was no use taking medicines internally, and 1 must use the "Rub On
Remedies, so I rubbed on Holloway's Ointment, 241 boxes ; Davis's Pain Killer, 70 bottles; Moulton s Pain Paint, 60 bottles; St. Jacob's Oil, Weston's
Wizard Oil, and Croton Oil, of each 100 bottles ; and of Eucalyptus Oil, 900 quart bottles - hut I felt no I letter. Another friend advised the Herb Cure,
so 1 took strong decoctions of Chamomile, Pennyroyal, Peppermint, Rue, Tansy, Quassia, Horehound, Wormwood, Aconite, Belladonna Hemlock
Nux Vomica, Lungwort, Liverwort, Moonwort, Sneezewort, and Snakeweed—altogether I took about 17U quarts of these horrid decoctions—but I felt
no better. Another friend told me that ray stomach was out of order, and required cleansing, so I took of Ipecacuanha Wine 139 quarts—but this did not
cure me. Another friend said that all diseases came from insects, and I had insects in me, and must take special medicine for them, so I took of
Keating's Insecticide 730 packets—but got no better. Another friend advised me to try Homoeopathy. I took 111 tubes of pilules and 80 bottles of
tinctures—but they did me no good. Another friend advised me to try the water cure. 1 took cold baths, warm baths, tepid baths, and Turkish baths
in hundreds, and drank about twenty hogsheads of mineral waters—but it ail did me no good. Another friend advised the Acid Cure, so I took Acetic
Acid, Muriatic Acid. Nitric Acid, Sulphuric Acid, Oxalic Acid, and Prussic Acid, of each about twenty quarts—but got no better. Another friend
advised Soothing Medicines, so I took 400 of Steedraan's Soothing Powders, and 130 bottles of Mother Winslow's Soothing Syrup—but I was still
Irritable and nervous. My last course of medicine consisted of Steel Drops, Balm of Gilead, Turpentine, Chloroform, Cod Liver Oil, Assafietida, Spanish
Flies, and Cayenne Pepper—about fifteen pounds of each—but it all did me no good. I simply got worse and worse, and was reduced to a mere shadow
of skin and bone, but, as luck would have it, another friend came along—a true friend this time—and suggested Cole's FUN DOCTOR. I got it, and
was well and stout in a Week, at a cost of Is. 6d.

Gregorian Music.
A Yankee was taken by a friend to a Roman Catholic
Church, celebrated for its Gregorian music. After the service
his friend asked him how he liked the music, and he replied
that he didn’t think much of it. “But,” said his friend,
“that was Gregorian music, the oldest that we have. That
is the music that David used to play before Saul.” “Wal,
is it now? That explains a part of the Scriptures to me. I
never could understand why Saul should have shied his
javelin at David; but now that I am aware that David
inflicted that quality of torture upon the poor old man, I’m
heart and soul with Saul.”

Verdi’s Common Sense or Best Music.
When Verdi was putting the last touches to “ II Trovatore,”
he was visited in his study by a privileged friend. The friend
was one of the ablest living musicians and critics. He was
permitted to look at the score and run over the “Anvil Chorus”
on the pianoforte. “What do you think of that?” asked the
master. “Trash,” said the connoiseur. Verdi rubbed his
hands and chuckled. “Now look at this, and this,” he said.
“Rubbish!’ The composer rose and embraced him with a
burst of joy. “What do you mean?” asked the critic. “My
dear friend, cried Verdi, “ I have been making a popular
opera. In it I resolved to please everyone except the great
judges, the classicists, like you. Had I pleased you I should
have pleased no one else. What you say assures me of my
success. In three months ‘II Trovatore’ will be sung, and
roared, and whistled, and barrel-orpared all ovei Italy."

The Sea Serpent as a Carrier.
TI 1 E wot K 1 renowned sea-serpent has been specially chartered
to bring a fresh supply of books every week from England
to Cole’s Book Arcade, Melbourne; and also to show upon the
coils of his body 2000 rainbows, being so many copies of the
beautiful sign of that establishment. The sea-serpent, upon
being communicated with, demanded a heavy price for his ser-
vices, but Mr. Cole agreed to the terms, as he considered that
2000 of his rainbow signs travelling round the world on the
sides of the famous sea-serpent would be a good advertisement
for the Book Arcade.
TRUE HISTORY OF THE GREAT SEA SERPENT.
JOHN SMI Til, the sea-serpent, was born in a swamp near Sydney, about 5000 years ago. He was hatched by a female
Bunyip from an immense three-cornered egg, which is supposed to have fallen out of the moon, and he is the only sea-
serpent that ever existed. He never had relations, and is the only being in the world of whom the verse is true. He
never had a father. He never had a mother. He never had a sister. He never had a brother. He also never had a wife.
He is of a very shy disposition, and many fascinating mermaids have made love to him, and practised all their well-known wiles
upon him but in vain: he is a bachelor still. Like some other animals mentioned in history, he thinks and talks like a man.
He is exceedingly intelligent, and seems to have as much sense as 20,000 ordinary men or 21,000 women. He can sing with a
voice of tremendous compass, from the sweet piping of a nightingale down to far below the deepest tones of the largest organ,
or the noise made by discharges of artillery. Sometimes when he sings it shakes the ground for miles around, and if at sea
causes a storm. His favourite songs are “A life on the Ocean Wave.” “What a the Wild Waves Saying,” “Down by
the Deep Sad Sea, and such like. Pie plays all the musical instruments in the world, speaks all the languages in the
world, and believes in all the religions in the world. His whistle can be heard a distance of 100 miles, his shout 50 miles,
and his whisper 10 miles. Of course in an active life of 5000 years, a life almost as long as some of the Hindoo patriarchs,
he has seen and heard, and done, many astonishing things. He relates that he once rescued a travelling menagerie at sea,
he swallowed the whole lot of animals, and the woman in charge of them let them roam about inside of him and enjoy
themselves, and then landed them safely on dry land at the end of 48 hours. He says that he was in Arabia, and saw that
remarkable occurrence of the moon coming down and going into Mahomet’s sleeve, and there and then objected to the whole
proceeding. The sea-serpent is 15 miles long and 60 feet in diameter, his skin is of a horny nature, but harder than steel,
and about 5 feet thick. He travels at the rate of 200 miles an hour, and can carry about 120 times as much as the “Great
Eastern. If he was coming up to the Queen s Wharf, Melbourne, when his head was at the wharf his body would reach right
down the Liver Yarra out in the Bay past Williamstown, and the traffic would have to be stopped in the river whilst he was
unloading. Ihe sea-serpent is rather a large eater. Since he reached full growth, namely, for the last 4000 years, he has
swallowed a whole whale every morning for breakfast except once. The reason of his going without his breakfast that once
is explained in the following manner:—
Ihe reader will remember the account of Jonah and the whale in the Talmud. It states that when Jonah was in the whale’s
belly it went out of the Mediterranean right round Africa into the Red Sea, and that Jonah looked out through the eyes of the
whale and saw the place where the children of Israel had crossed the Red Sea. The sea-serpent states that he can corroborate
this piece of history, as he happened to be after that very whale for his breakfast when he saw Jonah looking out through its
eyes. He says that he did not swallow that whale, as he had found that the whales which he had previously swallowed with
prophets inside of them did not agree with him, and consequently he had to go that morning without his breakfast, the first time
in 4000 years. 1 hose who want any further information about the famous sea-serpent can acquire it at Cole’s IBook Arcade,
Melbourne, or come and interview and question the sea-serpent himself when he arrives.
Some people don t believe in the existence of the sea-serpent, but if he did not exist how could we have got his
likeness and his history? That’s a question for the unbelievers to answer.




THE LIBRARY OF THE FUTURE.
To be composed entirely of the cream of human thought and knowledge.
Friendly Reader, — I propose to start a cheap, comprehensive, and
concise library, to be called the ** Federation of the World Library .'• It
is to consist vf the hundred best books in the world —one book the best of
its kind on each subject of human knowledge, such as astronomy, geology,
geography, history, biography, poetry, botany, chemistry, electricity,
architecture, mechanics, navigation, mathematics, natural history, gramma ,
medicine, agriculture, cookery, religion, law, politics, fun, and so on, up *0
one hundred volumes, which will comprise all the important branches of
human knowledge and thought. Each of these books must be carefully
prepared for the purpose, and each can be made to contain the best of
human knowledge on the subject treated. It is astonishiug bow easily and
perfectly this can be done in a small compass. A moderately-sized song book
will hold all the best songs in the world ; a moderate-sized poetry book will
hold all the best poems in the world; a moderate-sized wisdom book will
hold all the wisest sayings in the world; a moderate-sized book carefully
prepared, of astronomy, geology, geography, chemistry, botany, or any of
the sciences, will give a clear knowledge of the principles of those sciences.
Such a library of one hundred volumes of, say, 600 pages each, can be pro-
duced to sell at 2s each, or £ lO the lot; thus bringing all the most impor-
tant knowledge, and all the most beautiful thoughts within the reach of
every human being. Books are multiplying so fast now, that no man can
know even the titles of them all, much less read their contents ; therefore,
a desirable thing and an absolute necessity of the future, w»ill be to pick
the grain out of so much chafi, and preserve it in condensed libraries for
the ready instruction, elevation, and gratification of universal humanity.
I have called it the " Federation of the World Library,” because I believe
that the cream of human thought, collected into a convenient form, and
brought within the reach of everyone, will do much to spread the prin-
ciples of right and truth and friendship—to make men think rightly and
consequently alike, and so bring about the federation of the human race.
Mankind, as a whole, have infinitely greater regard for right and truth
than they have for wrong and falsehood, and it is the high destiny of the
Press to develop and nurture this good tendency in man, by spreading and
re-spreading abroad those great principles of right and truth, until every
one shall become a right thinker ; and no small part of the duty of the
Press is to collect the best knowledge, and the best thoughts existing in the
world, and bring them before every human being, in the form of convenient
libraries, as above indicated. As one unit amongst the many I am
trying to do my share in carrying out this object. I have little leisure
time, but I hope to be able to publish a few of these ” Best Books in the
World.”
I have already published five, namely:—“The Child’s Funny Picture
Book,*' “The Fun Doctor,” "The Thousand Best Poems." “The Thou-
sand Best Songs,” and the “ Intellect Sharpener” Each of these five is the
best of its kind in the world, and their circulation is already very large One
other, now publishing, entitled Pleasant-Learning-Land is also the best
“ Kindergarten ” book in the world This and “ The Child's Funny Picture
Book ” belong to each other, and will later on. with a little alteration, form
a splendid compound Kindergarten work It may be thought presumptuous
in me to assert that I can produce several of the best books in the world, but
it is very easy to do so with my opportunities Firstly, I have perhaps the
most varied collection of books in the world belonging to one person
Secondly. I have handled and retailed a greater variety of books than any
one in Australia Thirdly, for half a century I have been a lover of. and a
most persistent reader of books, so that, to paraphrase the verse of the
' J ingo 1 song—“ I’ve got the books, I’ve got the will. I’ve got the knowledge,
too ” Besides, it is very easy to make the best book of selections in the
world, as at present the best are so poor It has often surprised me that
Books show that good men everywhere
Believe that war should cease ;
And books will make that feeling grow,
And evermore increase
Books thus will cause the flag of peace
Through earth to be unfurled—
Produce “ the parliament of man,”
And federate the world
publishers with great opportunities do not make better or more varied
selections than they do. For instance. ta*.e poetical ones Hundreds
of books are published with the same—we will call them “ hall marked "
poems—over and over again, while many of the most interesting and
Instructive gems are habitually left out It is unfortunately largely so with
all classes of selections influenced by custom or prejudice. Compilers put
in much of the uninteresting and uninstructive, and leave out much of the
best. But good selections must and will be made eventually, for I again
repeat that the absolute necessity of the near future will be a judicious selection of
thought and knowledge, condensed from universal literature into comparatively a
few cheap volumes, for the convenient and effective instruction cf all mankind—for
the wise and benevolent instruction of every human being Of course as time goes
on these books of selections will be made more and more perfect, through
greater care and through being supplemented with fresh thought and
knowledge ; but come they must. Some time ago I was speaking to the
Grand Old Man of New Zealand (Sir George Grey) about this hundred
best books of the future, and his answering remark was—“ The very thought
of such a library makes my mouth water " I cannot in justice publish these
remarks about the shortcomings of most books of selections without stating
that there are a few good ones, and particularly one entitled •• Day's
Collacon.” It is an American collection of prose, containing 40,000 quota-
tions on 8,000 subjects, by 2.000 authors, and is sold at about thirty-five
shillings. It is too high-priced and too large for popular circulation, but I
feel certain that it is the grandest and best book of great thoughts ever
compiled from universal literature, and if cut down into a smaller size
would form the first or second in value of the above indicated hundred
best books.
In projecting this idea of the necessary and thorough condensation of
thought and knowledge into a few cheap volumes, the question will natur-
ally arise to book-makers and book-readers—how will this affect the present
vast libraries and the future production of books in great varieties and
quantities ? I think it will considerably increase both the production and
the reading of books—lo * th** . eading inclination in man is a peculiarly fasci-
nating and an increasing one. Man has an innate love of knowledge, and
the search for knowledge increases that love ; it grows upon what it feeds
until its further acquisition oecomes a pleasing, craving necessity of his
nature The morr knowledge a man has the more he wants, and this
knowledge become his greatest pride, his greatest comfort, and his most
precious and eternal possession, growing as the years grow, growing as the
ages grow ; this moral and physical knowledge becomes the grandest and
mightiest power for good of his individual being in this life and the next.
I hold therefore, that it is our very highest duty to nurture and develop this
powerful latent capacity for knowledge, as much as we possibly can. in every
human be-ug. Our first duty is to educate our children ; our next duty
is to educate our community; our next duty is to educate all our fellow-
beings, both the pale and the sunburnt : and I hold that one of the greatest
means to that end will be the condensation of the choicest of human
tucught and knowledge into a few convenient volumes. Most certainly a
hundred volumes, so compiled, would not give all the thought and know-
ledge which human beings yearn for or requ’re; but it would give them con-
veniently, cheaply and effectively, very much and quite enough to start the
more earnest inquirers on the road to the examination of the more voluminous
treasures of knowledge—to the more earnest and effectual study of that
splendid heritage of the par*, and the vastly expanding knowledge of the
future, which is gradually, but surely, opening before us. and which will
be recorded and preserved, not in a few, but in a great multitude of
books

Books give man hope beyond the grave

At the Age of 40.
WHAT BOOKS DO FOR MANKIND
1.
Books should be found in every house,
To form and feed the mind ;
They are the best of luxuries
To happify mankind.
2.
For all good books throughout the world
Are man’s most precious treasure;
They make him wise, and bring to him
His best, his choicest pleasure.
3.
Books make his time pass happily,
Relieve his weary hours;
Amuse, compose, instruct his mind ;
Enlarge his mental powers.
4.
Books teach the boys and girls of earth
In quite ten million schools;
Books make the difference between
Earth’s learned and its fools.
5.
Books teach earth’s teeming artisans
The proper way to take,
To find, to plan, to build, to mix,
And every product make.
6.
Books teach schoolmasters, clergymen,
Of every rank and grade ;
And doctors, lawyers, judges, too —
Books are their tools of trade.
******
128.
Books thus, by print, and pictures, bring
The whole world into view,
And show what all men think about,
And everything they do.
EDWARD WILLIAM COLE—Aged 80.
129.
Books give to man the history
Of each and every land ;
Books show him human actions past,
The bad, the good, the grand.
130.
Books show him human arts and laws
Of every time and place ;
Books show the learnings and the faiths
Of all the human race.
131.
Books give the best and greatest thoughts
Of all the good and wise;
Books treasure human knowledge up,
And thus it never dies.
132.
Books show men all that men have done,
Have thought, have sung, have said ;
Books show the deeds and wisdom of
The living and the dead.
133.
Books show that mankind’s leading faiths,
In morals are the same;
That in their main essentials
They differ but in name.
134.
Books short that virtue, goodness, love,
Exist in every land ;
That some with kindly sympathies
A re found on every strand.
135.
Books showthe joys,griefs, hopes and fears,
Of every race and clan;
Books show, by unity of thought,
The brotherhood of man.
136.
Books thus will cause the flag of peace
Through earth to be unfurled
Produce “ the parliament of man,"
And federate the world
Cole’s Own Portrait, at
the age of 41.
(He bought It amongst some
old Books, thus it became
his own Portrait.)
137.
Books give the reader vast delight,
The bookless never know ;
Books give him pleasure, day and night,
Wherever he may go.
138.
Books show narcotics, toxicants,
Of each and every kind ;
Insidious destroyers all,
Of body and of mind.
139.
Books, like strong drink, will drown man's
cares
But do not waste his wealth ;
Books leave him better, drink the worse,
In character and health.
140.
Books teach and please him when a child,
In youth and in his prime;
Books give him soothing pleasure when
His health and strength decline.
141.
Books teach, from their beginning, of
Higher beings than man ;
That One Almighty Goodness was
Before the world began.
142.
Books give us hope beyond the grave,
Of an immortal life ;
Books teach that right, and truth, and love
Shall banish every strife.
143.
Books therefore are, of all we own,
The choicest things on earth ;
Books have, of all our worldly goods,
The most intrinsic worth.
144.
Books are the greatest blessing bought,
The grandest thing we sell;
Books bring more joy,
Books do more good,
Than mortal tongue can tell.

Fashion Torturing the Poor Feet.
Disgrace to the Intellect of the Nineteenth Century.
Ingrowing Tom Nall caused by Tight Boots.
** Prom a wife who don’t luv a».
From bad food and Me butes
Good Lord, deliver us.”
Paraphrase of Jack Billings's Prayer against Curses.
UjjpfcHE greatest illustration of the cruelty of Boot
Issi Fashions is found in China, where millions follow-
ing a foolish freak of fashion inflict upon their children
the most horrible sufferings. The fashionable feet of a
Chinese lady are pressed into boots not three inches
long. When the girl is three or four years old the foot
torturing commences, and continues about two years,
during which time, through the gradual crushing of the
bones, and the wrenching of the skin and sinews, she
suffers excruciating pains unparalleled in any other
country in the world. The poor creature can then
neither walk nor stand without assistance, and is prac-
tically incapable for life—but the It in the fashion.
White people are not so extravagantly fashionable in
this matter as the Chinese, still they almost worship a
small foot, and bring numberless excruciating tortures
upon themselves in trying to obtain it. Perhaps there
are more acute tortures come to civilized man from
tight-fitting boots than from any other cause. Drunken-
ness brings, directly and indirectly, much suffering, but
tight boots bring more constant acute agony to the far
greater number. One-tenth of the civilized world may
suffer from drink, but at least nine-tenths of the men,
women, and children suffer more or less acutely from
ill-fitting boots. Tight boots bring corns, bunions, in-
growing toe-nails, turned-in toes, dislocations of the toe
joints, swellings, abscesses, and a variety of other pain-
ful diseases of the feet directly and indirectly; weak
ankles, contraction of the muscles of the leg, formation
of abscesses in the groin, curvature of the spine, and
contracted chest caused by a painful, hobbling, crooked
walk; and more or less a general disturbance of the
entire system. There must also be mentioned loss of
health through want of proper exercise, pecuniary loss
from incapacity to attend to business, fretfulness of
temper caused by constant pain, and sometimes painful
operations, amputation and sometimes mortification and
death. In addition to my own observations 1 have con-
sulted a great many medical authorities on the subject,
And they uniformly and emphatically agree that nine-
of foot-troubles come from ill-fitting and
mostly from fashionably tight N ^ l*. for all tM»,
in ? great measure, the bootmaker is to blame. It is
true that many people will have fashionable boots, no
matter how they may distort and torture their feet, and
the bootmaker has to satisfy them or lose their custom ;
but half the people don’t care about fashion as long as
they can get ease, and here is where the opportunity
and tesponsibility of the bootmaker come in, but
unfortunately the average bootmaker, by long practice
and interest, is wedded to the fashionable style, and so
the all-round torture goes on. There is no reason why
the bootmaker should not be held morally responsible,
at least for the foot-health of his customer, as much as
the doctor is for the general health of his patient. One
writer before me would hold the bootmaker legally
responsible for the misfits. He says ;
“We heartily believe in laws against stealing,
defrauding, taking life, and disturbing the peace, and we
can conceive of no reason why the shoemaker who de-
liberately goes to work and manufactures an instrument
of torture which he perfectly well knows must spoil the
happiness, ruin the temper, and make cripples of hall
of the women of Christendom, should not be placed
under the ban of the law and visited with punishment
commensurate to his crimes.”
But, jesting aside, the bootmaker holds a responsible
power for good or for ill in his hands, and he should do
his duty as much as possible in lessening human misery
Instead of increasing it.
Mr. J. Sparks Hall, the inventor of that blessed boon,
the elastic-side for boots, and bootmaker to Queen
Victoria, in his “Book of the Feet,” says:—For up-
wards of twenty years as a bootmaker I have made the
feet my study, and during that period many thousand
pairs of feet have received my attention, and 1 am obliged
to admit that much of the pain that I have witnessed,
much of the distortion of the toes, and corns on the top
of the feet, the bunions on the side, the callosities be-
neath, and the growing in of the nails between, are
attributable to the shoemaker. 7he feet with proper treat-
ment be us free from disease ana fain as the karris. * *
their structure and adaptation to the wants and comfort
of man, as we have seen, is most perfect. Thirty-six
bones and thirty-six joints, have been given by the
Creator to form one of these members, and yet man
cramps, cabins, and confines his beautiful arrangement
of one hundred and forty-four bones and joints, together
with muscles, elastic cartilage, lubricating oily fluid,
veins and arteries, into a pair of shoes or boots, which,
instead of protecting from injury, produce the most pain-
ful as well as permanent results. Many volumes have
been written on the causes of corns, and it has been my
lot to wade through them, without gaining much for
my pains. I have therefore arrived at the conclusion,
notwithstanding all that has been said to the contrary,
that corns are in all cases the result of pressure."
So says one of the best bootmakers in the world. I
now can give myself as a shocking example in boot-
torture. I have ordinary average-shaped feet, have
worn many pairs of torturing ready-mades, have tried
several “ kirst-class ” bootmakers and got ill-fits. At
length I found one who roug'd feet


made boots to fit them, and for some years gave, me feet
happiness; but he, unfortunately, retired from business;
and a few months ago 1 went to another Melbourne
maker, he made me consecutively two fashionable nop
fitting pairs; I went, to another and he made me cou
secutively two other fashionable non-fitting pairs. I
paid £s S ° f° r th® f° ur P a^rs m a few weeks, and am
not able to walk in any of them without corns and pains.
And now, reader, my experience is the experience of
other similar sufferers in the civilized world,
and I have no hesitation in denouncing this iashion as
not only a monstrously cruel, but as a silly thing.
Why should we be ashamed to show the natural shape
of our feet any more than the shape of our face or hands ?
To attempt to remould any part of out body is an un-
natural sin, and I would suggest that every man, woman,
and child should have a pair of lasts made to exactly fit
the feet, not only on the top and sides, heel and toe, but
under the tread of the foot also, and millions of people
would thus be saved from terrible and unnecessary suffer-
ings. W T hy could not an exact cast of the foot be taken
and used as a last? the money now spent for corn “cures’’
would buy such lasts for all, and corns would cease
to exist : even the governments or philanthropists
might take this most important matter in hand and
start simple factories where proper lasts could be
obtained by every person for a small fee. This is far more
important than government vaccination, for horrid as
the small pox is, non-fitting boots at present bring a
hundred, a thousand times as much misery to the con-
stantly suffering millions that much-dreaded disease.
This article is fraternally dedicated to all those good
oootmakers who are determined or will henceforth deter -
termine as much as possible to make rational boots, and
thereby lessen human misery by easing the poor feet.

Oh ! for the payshunce ov Job, the Apostle, to nuss a

VERY LATEST FOOLISH FASHIONABLE
FOOT-FAD.
The latest atrocity in the interests of “beauty” is a
corset for the foot, and the idea comes from America
(says a London paper). The new instrument of torture
is made so as to enable a size smaller shoe to be worn
than would be otherwise possible, and consists of a
strong though thin band or web, which is fixed around
the instep while the foot is off the ground. •, When this
».s in Its place it is comparatively easy to pat on a shoe
which is altogether too small, and the pressure being on
the ror«et instead of tb« shoe the latter does not st r e^ch.

OPINIONS ABOUT THIS BOOK.
•• We are in receipt of an admirable book upon ' Tight Lacing’
and ’ Tight Boots’ edited by E. W. Cole, of the Book Arcade,
Melbourne. There are some hundreds of illustrations of the dresses,
foolish and suitable fashions of different nations, and of the human
form internally, externally, and cut in two. with the view to show
the bad effect of tight lacing, tight boots. &c. It is a most interest-
ing book, the pictures alone being quite a study.
—Standard of Freedom and Wellington Gazette
•• Mr Cole, in the letterpress accompanying the illustrations, is
very caustic in treating of the incalculable ills following breaches
of nature’s laws Queen Victoria favours one of his suggested
reforms —the square-toed boot. May she find many followers is tb~
wish of every person coming in contact who suffers from the
bunion-and corn-producing pointed-toe and the irritable temper it
engenders. Heads of families, schools, etc., would do well to per-
use the work and impress upon their charges the benefit of following
ils advice ’ Daylesford Herald.
* Kational Dress’ is the title of an excellent little book published
by E. W. Cole. . . Tight lacing by women is dealt with
Excellent diagrams are given showing the situation and relations of
the principal internal organs of the body, and the shocking results
following such practice —every woman should read and study these
pictures and thus see that the notion of screwing their waists into
the smallest compass is actually suicidal. Tne little book, which is
brimful of good information, winds up with the ‘ Fashion of tortur-
ing the poor feet,' and gives a number of illustrations showing the
effects produced by the wearing of tight boots—ugly deformities,
horrible-looking toes, with bunions. The letterpress on each subject
Is very good resiling.” Murrundi and Qutrindi Times.
" An interesting illustrated papier depicting the tortures the human
body is subjected to on the plea of fashion, style, &c. . . , Fart
IV. is perhaps as interesting as any in the book.- It points out
the ridiculous and dangerous custom indulged in every day in order-
ing boots (fashionable of course) wholly unsuited for the feet. The
foot is often cramped and squeezed out of shape through wearing
smart tight boots. Anyhow, corns or bunions are fruits of ' fashion’
and cripples are made by pieople trying to cram a No. 6 foot into a
No. 5 boot. The book is opposed to torturing the feet. It recom-
mends an easy square-toe-fitting boot, with a good sole and plenty
of heel—not pared away to a pinnacle like a sixpence. Altogether,
Mr. Cole’s latest publication is a very sensible production, and
should prove some good to the human family.”
Wallsend and Plattsbury Sun.
In every respect the work is one that should be hailed with delight
throughout the length and breadth of civilization, and more
especially by the rising generation of our sunny clime It points
out distinctly the evils that are attained by tight lacing, the tortur-
ing elements caused through wearing tight boots, and various other
inhuman distortions, which we would like to fully comment upon,
but shortness of space precludes us from so doing at the present
juncture. There is no doubt that many of the ills that flesh is heir
to is caused from the above effects, which no sane woman or man
will contradict. We have no hesitation in recommending this work
to one and all. —Donald Express

The following statements show some of the large establishments that are
closed against cigarette smokers in America:—
"Swift & Co. (Packing House, Chicago), and other Chicago business
houses, employing hundreds of boys, have issued this announcement, or

Smoking does Some Good but More Evil.
Smoking soothes and comforts millions of the worried and the weary,
and brings much pleasure to the habitual smoker, but it always more
or less injures the health of the smoker and sometimes kills him. The
vast majority of the medical fraternity condemn smoking, especially by
the voung.
Smoking injures multitudes of boys in many respects.
Smoking often leads boys into bad company.
Smoking often makes them precocious, undutiful,
impudent and callous.
Smoking often ruins the health.
Smoking generally stunts their growth
Smoking generally sallows their complexion
Smoking often leads them to lying.
Smoking often leads them to stealing.
Smoking often leads them to drinking.
Smoking degenerates the boy physically, mentally, and
m jrally.
Smokers cannot excel in athletic sports, such as
t> ( ing, crirVM cycling
Smokers are always at the bottom of the class in school and college,
and backward at all kinds of study.
Excessive smoking causes mental and physical laziness in boys and
men.
The following organs, fluids, functions, &c., of the body, specially 0j
the young, are frequently more or less affected by the use of tobacco.
The blood, the heart, the nerves, the brain, the liver, the lungs, the
stomach, the throat, the saliva, the taste, the voice, the eyes, the ears,
the nose, the mouth, the tongue, the palate, the pancreas, the lips, the
teeth, the bones, the skin,
Medical men and observing experts affirm that many diseases are
caused or accelerated by the use of tobacco, among which are the fol-
lowing:— Heart disease, consumption, cancer, ulceration, asthma,
bronchitis, neuralgia, paralysis, palsy, apoplexy, indigestion, dysentry,
diarrhoea, constipation, sleeplessness, melancholia, delirium tremens,
insanity.
Smoking frequently leads to prolonged suffering
Smoking often destroys the appetite.
Smoking sometimes weakens the will power
Smoking sometimes leads to loss of memory
Smoking often leads to despondency.
Smoking sometimes leads to suicide
Smoking frequently leads to loss —loss by bad health and waste of
valuable time—direct loss in money required for other purposes, and
immense loss through reckless, thoughtless, or unfortunate smokers
being the cause of partial or total destruction by fire of buildings, ships,
factories, homesteads, crops, stores, and property of many kinds; also
loss of life and property by explosions in mines, explosive factories,
powder magazines, explosive stores, &c.
Tobacco using is an unclean habit, an offensive habit, an enslaving
habit, often it is an intensely selfish habit.
Tobacco fumes, especially in small and poorly-ventilated houses or
rooms, injure or destroy the health of multitudes of wives, and injure
the health or kill multitudes of infants and children.
Tobacco using injures the unborn child by giving it a puny body and
an imperfect start in life
Tobacco using is fast degenerating the race.
A third of the recruits for the Army are disqualified through smoking
The following Governments have passed laws against juvenile smok-
ing:—Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Japan, Canada, Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, British Columbia, the North
West Territories, Cape Colony. New South Wales. Victoria, South
Australia, Tasmania, and about 48 of the States and Territories out of
53; and so terrible and deplorable an effect has juvenile smoking upon
the race that most other Governments are considering the advisability
of passing laws against it.
The insidious influence of cigarette smoking by boys is shown in
these examples of handwriting, taken from a London County Council
health report. The first v.as written by a boy when he was a victim of
the habit : the second is the same boy's writing when he had given it
up, ten months later.

Narcotics and Intoxicants.
In moit parts of tbe world man has found out some way of stimulating, soothing,
or deadening bis animal system by means of plants or drugs. Hundreds of these
stimulating, intoxicating, soothing, and stupefying substances have been discovered
and used in various countries, chief amongst which may be mentioned—
Opium, Tobacco, Indian Hemp, Betel Nut, and Alcohol; and
others are used in a less degree, such as Coca, Kola Nut, Thorn Apple,
Cocculus Indlcus, Intoxicating Toadstool, Deadly Nightshade,
Henbane, Rhododendron, Azalea, Emetic Holly, Bearded Darnel,
etc. The first five among these human pleasers and human destroyers
are—
1. Alcohol, now drank in th« shape of spirits, wine, beer, or some other form
probably by 300,000,000 persons.
2. Opium, smoked, inhaled, drank or swallowed by probably 100,000,000.
3. Tobacco, now smoked, chewed, and snuffed by probably 300,000,000
4. Haschish, made from Indian Hemp, now smoked, chewed, or swallowed
by probably 150,000,000.
5. Betel Nut, chewed probably by 50,000,000.
These five narcotising and intoxicating poisons are used, more or less, by halt
the people in the world, giving some considerable pleasure at times, but destroying,
more or less, the health of all who use them, and gradually stunting the form and
otherwise undermining the well-being of the entire human race.
Chemistry also produces many things which are taken in the same way and for
the same purpose, such as Laudanum, Morphia, Cocaine, Chloral, Chloroform,
Ether, &c., and many so-called patent medicines. These all tend to form habits
which soothe and please for a time, but they all damage or destroy in tbe end.
The great bulk of easy-going, unreflecting people have no idea what an amount
of mischief and misery tbe habit of using these things inflict upon poor humanity.

Probably the best use a man can make of his leisure time is to read good books
and to follow their advice, and the worst use he can make of it is to indulge ia
Intoxicating liquor, and to go where that will lead or take him.
It is said that “Dipsomania,” "Alcoholism,” or the “ Craving-for-Drink ” disease
can be cured in most persons by certain remedies and proper management, and
the time has come now when the lovers of human progress everywhere feel that this
fearful curse must be grappled with, and, if possible, stamped out like the small-
pox, or any other terrible disease. One writer sums up the evils of drinking as
follows:
“ It Injures the health.
It shortens life.
It originates hereditary disease.
It ruins the character of thousands.
It destroys the peace of families and of individuals.
It causes husbands and wives to neglect each other, their children, and tbeit
homes.
It makes wives widows, and children orphans.
It bereaves parents of their children.
It reduces families to penury. ,
It hinders the amelioration of the poorer classes of society.
It makes times hard and trade bad.
It is a cause of quarrels, robberies, and murder*.
It is a cause of suicide.
It fills our prisons.
It fills our poorhouses.
It fills our hospitals.
It fills our madhouses."
Books , like Strong drink, will drown man s cares
But do not waste his wealth ;
Books leave him better, drink the worse,
In character and health.

PIPES OF THE WORLD.
Showing one of Cole’s “Similarities of Mankind.”


AUSTRALIA CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING 400 MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
Australia a Grand Country.
I think that Australia for its size is. all-round, the best country in the
world. Its climate is pleasant and health-giving It has no desolating
blizzards, no frost-bites, and few sun-strokes. In edible produce, for both
size and quality it stands very high, if not the highest. I have been in
many lands, but never saw a country supply such a variety of products as
Australia does —potatoes, onions, cabbages, carrots, peas, beans, and scores
of other vegetables in abundance. In fruits it produces apples,' pears,
plums, peaches, oranges, grapes, and all the smaller fruits in great
abundance and of good flavour. Northern Australia also produces all the
tropical fruits in abundance wherever cultivated In corn Australia pro-
duces superior wheat, oats, bailey, maize, and all other kinds in
abundance, especially when scientifically irrigated. As a milk, butter, and
meat country, it is one of the best in the world. It is the largest and best
wool-producing country in the world. It contains the largest area in the
world especially suitable for growing cotton, the most extensively-used
clothing material Flowers grow luxuriantly and beautifully whenever
cultivated and watered. A few years ago. when writing on the "White
Australia " question, I stated that with high culture, water conservation and
scientific irrigation, Australia was capable ot supporting 400 millions of
inhabitants, A high literary authoi uy, in reviewing the book, remarked
that this seemed like "a gross exaggeration " ; but probably he had not
thought so much on the subject as I had.
I will here concisely state the principal reasons for my opinion The
great want of Australia, to make it amazingly fruitful, is the complete con-
servation of water and its scientific application to the soil. Water,
warmth, and soil will grow anything in Australia, if rationally managed
Australia has abundance of water now running to waste. On thousands of
house-roofs water enough is caught for the domestic use of the respective
families. Over large areas of the country there are 30 inches of rafinfall,
and the average rainfall over vast areas is 24 inches, and could be made
much greater by cultivation. Four fifths of this water now runs to waste
Again, surface-parched Australia has vast areas of underground water
which only require to be tapped and brought to the surface, to irrigate an
fertilize the soil.
Australia is also a country where timber grows well and fast, if plained
in trenched ground and slightly irrigated. Hundreds of straight trees can
be grown upon an acre of land if they are first planted thickly and some
gradually thinned out. Many kinds of trees will grow upon very poor soil
if they are properly planted and irrigated, as the bulk of their sustenance
is derived from the air One more remark about trees and their possibilities
as food providers. Wherever any kind of tree will grow some kind of fruit
tree will grow. There are hundreds of millions of gum trees growing in
Australia. Where every one of these trees is, some kind of fruit tree would
grow, if properly planted and looked after.
Again, to utilize Australia to its full extent the whole world should be
•ought through for the best plants and trees of every kind, and only the
very best grown, and those in situations and soil best adapted for them
One argument used against Australia is that much of its surface is
sandy; but experiments and developments in various countries show
that the planting of marram grass, lupins, and other plants ties even the
drifting sand together and gradually, through their decay, turns the sandy
wastes into fertile soil. Besides, science can, in many other ways, utilize
the elements in the air to enrich the soil
For further remarks on this subject I beg to refer the reader to the com
mg book:—" Australia Able to Support 400 Millions.”
Australia's Mineral Resources.
It has been objected that In the above epitome no mention is made of the great
mineral wealth of Australia. The reason is that minerals, exceedingly useful as they a e
in the arts, are not absolutely necessary (with the exception perhaps of iron) to the feed-
ing, clothing, and bousing of mankind. Vast multitudes have lived without them ; but it
maybe remarked that Australia is a country very rich in minerals; some hold it is.lhe
richest in the world It possesses immense deposits of iron not yet utilised, and the
most extensive gold-fields yet discovered, Australia and Tasmania have, according 10
the latest estimate of our Commonwealth Statistician, produced minerals to the value m
£660.25*.694 comprising in round numbers, Gobi £474.000.000; Coal £s6.<xxj,ckk
Silver and Lead £49.000.000. Copper £45,000,000; Tin £24,000,000; and other kino
£8,000,000. The bulk of the above has been produced during the last 60 years, in .
population rising from about 300,000 to 4,000,000, and it forecasts how vast the mineral-
producing future of Australia is likely to be. Altogether Australia is a country »« highly

The Best Country on Earth: Unknown Australia.
"'lf we Australians took as much trouble to prepare for our summer
as the Canadians take to forestall their winter, Australia would be the
most prosperous country on earth.’
"The speaker was the Rev A K. Edgar, head of the Central Mission,
Melbourne.
" ' After circling the globe, then, you are still satisfied that Australia
is not a bad country to live in ? '
" ' The best,’ said Mr. Edgar, emphatically. * I have no hesitation in
saying that Canada and America are not to be compared with Australia
Unfortunately, England doesn't know :t. Australia herself doesn’t half
realise it, and as for America and Canada, they haven’t the remotest
ghost of a notion of it In England they learn with regrettable slowness,
and their knowledge of us is scanty indeed ; but across the Atlantic the
ignorance is deplorable 'Australia?' says the Canadian. 'Oh, yes!
Let’s see, that's the place where it’s always droughty—yes, yes, to be sure,
the place where y’ can't get a drink of water.’ He laughs at the idea of
Australia producing as much wool and wheat as Canada, and bluntly
tells you there s no country on the face of the planet can grow wheat and
wool like his. But the fact is. there isn’t a bit of territory fit to compare
with the Western District of Victoria, for example, and conditions are
infinitely harder for the agriculturist than in Australia. Canada’s western
district is icebound in winter, and her eastern lands are strewn over
with great boulders, between which the plough works laboriously in and
out.’ " —From the New lied,
I often feel for the dweller in Canada ; for notwithstanding his beautiful
spring and autumn he has six months of ice and snow and freezing winds,
and I feel selfishly grateful that my lot is cast in more genial Australia.
Let us well ponder Mr. Edgar's concise and forcible statement:
“ If we Australians took as much trouble to prepare
for our summer as the Canadian’s take to forestall their
winter, Australia would be the most prosperous country
on earth ”
This is quite true The Canadian must thoughtfully and rationally pre-
pare for his winter, or he would freeze and starve We have no frigid
climate to prepare against, but we have possible drought ; and our first
and greatest consideration should he the conservation of water
for irrigation.
This water conservation is an exceedingly importani thing. Men do not
think, and the waste is enormous. When the rain falls it runs into the
gully, from the gully into the creek, from the creek into the river, from
the river into the sea ; and then, in the dry season water is deplorably
scarce.
I once asked a young squatter from the New South Wales s dc of the
Murray. " Have you got a garden ?’’ He answered "No ; it is too dry up
our way!" 1 said, "How do you get water for domestic purposes?”
He answered, "We catch it off the roof; we catch it in n tanks, and are
never out of a supply,’* I asked, " How large an area have all your roofs
put together?" He answered, "I think about 20 feet by 100 feet ’’
This would be about a twentieth of an acre. Now, just reflect I One
acre of rainfall would supply, if caught. 20 establishments like that
squatter’s home, for the rain would fall fairly alike all over that part of
the country. A rainfall of 30 inches over an acre of ground measures
about 680,000 gallons and weighs about 3.000 tons, the bulk of which is
allowed to run away every year I
A gentleman said to me the other day. " Since the water was brought to
Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie, under Sir John Forrest s great scheme, they
have very beautiful gardens right along the line of supply. Wherever the
water touches the land the vegetation is splendid, and. what is more, the
evaporation is bringing a heavier rainfall ” Of course, wherever cultiva
lion and irrigation are carried on. more evaporation takes place, and, in
most cases, cause* additional rainfall.
When 1 affirmed that Australia was capable of supporting 4 00 million*
of people I did not mean Australia as we now have it. but as it
be, and probably will be, when its water is carefully conserved
and its soil scientifically irrigated and cultivated.

RELIGIONS OF THE WORLD.
The following is approximately the numerical
strength of Christianity and the Ten Principal
Non-Christian Religions of Mankind.
According to the almost universal testimony
of history, the vast majority of mankind have
been thoughtful and intensely religious, and in-
clined to worship superior and generally in-
visible beings. Several of these religions have
now existed for many centuries, and are each
still sincerely believed in by millions of people.
First of all stands the Christian, the religion
of civilisation and progress, which seems to be
gradually supplanting all the others. Out of
the 1,800,000,000 people in the world, it now
claims about 608,050,000, divided into three
grand sects: Roman Catholics,about 284,000,000;
Protestants, 198,650,000; Greek Church,
125,400,000.
Buddhism was founded by Buddha about 600
years 8.C., and has about 488,100,000 adherents,
who live principally in the Chinese Empire,
Japan, Korea, Burma, Siam and Ceylon. They
are peacefully and prayerfully inclined.
Hindooism, whose great legislator, Manu,
was born about 1200 8.C.; has about 253,065,000
adherents, who live principally in India. Very
strict.
Mahometanism was founded by Mahomet,
who was born 570 A.D.; it has probably
241.500.000 adherents, who live in India, Persia,
Turkey, Arabia, Java, Africa, etc.
Confucianism was founded by Confucius, who
was born 551 years 8.C.; it has probably
98.050.000 adherents, who live principally in the
Chinese Empire.
Taouism was founded by Laou-tsze, who lived
at the same time as Confucius; its adherents
may number 89,200,000, principally in China.
Often a person holds partly with Buddhism,
Confucianism, and Taouism.
Judaism, whose great legislator Moses was
born about 1571 years 8.C., has probably
12.500.000 adherents, who are distributed all
over the world, but largely in Russia, Austria
and America.
Shintoism was founded by Simmo, who lived
about 600 years 8.C.; it has 80,000 priests and
probably 6,400,000 adherents, who live in Japan.
Sikhism was founded by Nanak, who was
born in 1468; it has about 2,300,000 adherents,
who live in India, chiefly in the Punjab.
Jainism was founded by Parswanatha about
600 B.C. Its adherents number about 1,415,000,
who live in India.
Parseeism was founded by Zoroaster, who
lived probably 1500 years 8.C., and has about
120,000 adherents, mostly living in India, and in
Persia, the place of its origin.
It has been customary with many to throw un-
limited and unmerited contempt upon the non-
Christian religions, but with all the faults and
debasing superstitions blended with them, they
have done an immense amount of good in regu-
lating the conduct of mankind through con-
demning vice and teaching virtue.
If we study the analogy of religions, we find
that much that they believe and teach is common
to them all.
They all believe in a Supreme Being, who
created the universe and now governs it.
They all believe in a future state of rewards
and punishments.
They all possess a code of morality, which
teaches that man should practise virtue and
shun vice.
They all believe in, teach and practise worship
and prayer.
They all have places of Worship, Priests,
Church Regulations, etc.
They all alike have some scriptures contain-
ing their doctrines, creeds, histories, etc.,
which scriptures are held most sacred; and
in the countries where they exist, are quoted
and referred to continually, permeate and in-
fluence every branch of literature, form the
familiar household words of the country and
enter largely into the ordinary conversations of
everyday life.
Hundreds of other similarities could be men-
tioned, did space permit, and undoubtedly all
these religions have much that is good in them,
and we should joy that the time is clearly and
rapidly approaching when men will acknow-
ledge that other men are as honest and sincere
in their beliefs as themselves.

THE DEATH RATE
OF THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD.
(APPROXIMATE.)
The Population of the World is 1,800,000,000,
and the estimated average length of human life
is 33 years (that is counting the child who may
live an hour, a week, a month, or a year, and those
who may reach 100 years). On this basis the
average death rate is as follows: —
51,428,571 people die per year; or
4,285,714 „ „ month; or
989,011 „ „ week; op
140,900 „ „ day; op
5,871 „ „ houp; op
98 „ „ minute
It is interesting to notice that out of the World s
1,800,000,000 of people, probably 1,000 will not
be living 103 years hence.
According to the most eminent authorities, no
person has been known to live to be 110 years
old.* It is a fictitious statement that two persons,
viz:—Parr and Jenkins lived to be 132 and 161
years of age respectively.

The Flying Machine will be used for
Procuring Statistics.
Though we are unable to give the accurate
population of China, which is roughly considered
to be one quarter of the world’s population, I
believe the rapid spread of the flying machine
will enable Statistics to be taken within the next
10 years, that will not only make it possible to
give the accurate population of China, but Africa
also, which, at the present time, is a difficult
matter to collect.
Asserted Deaths of Centenarians of the
Commonwealth.
Particulars as to the persons who died in 4 years at the
age of 104 and upwards, are given in the following table. It must,
of course, be understood that while the Registrars-General of the
various States take the greatest care to have statements as to abnorm-
ally high ages verified as far as possible, no absolute reliance can be
placed on the accuracy of the ages shewn, owing to the well-known
tendency of very old people to overstate their ages. The fact must
not be lost sight of in connection with this question, that while
parish registers in the United Kingdom often date very far back,
compulsory registration of births dates practically only from 1874,
the Act passed in 1836 having left many loopholes open for those
unwilling to register the births of their children.

The above Statistics are all I was able to obtain
from the available year books at the time of going to
press.

New Map of Concentrated World Knowledge,
entitled :
“The Whole World at a Glance.”
It contains the usual map of the world, showing all the
natural features—oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, islands, moun-
tains, plains, etc., also the principal railways, telegraph
cables, distances, towns, etc. But its special and uncom-
mon features are, that it shows the area, population, flag,
and human faces of every country. It has 140 black
squares, each in conjunction with the letterpress, shows the
area, population, and number of people per square mile, of
the 140 principal countries. By 1700 red dots it shows the
approximate position on the earth of its 1700 millions of
people. It shows that the population of the world has
doubled during the last hundred years; that people from
the thickly-populated countries are emigrating or over-
flowing into the empty or thinly-populated countries. It
shows representative portraits of the principal peoples of
Europe, Africa, America, Asia, and Australasia—B7 like-
nesses of men and 97 of women. It shows, also, the flags
of all the principal nations, to the number of 136. The
object of the entire publication is to convey interesting,
instructive, and useful information about the whole world,
in a concise, yet comprehensive and easily perceived form.
A map showing all the countries of the world, the popula-
tion of all nations, the faces of all nations, and the flag's of
all nations should interest everyone.
The Probable Future of Human
Settlement.
As the world has doubled its population during the last
hundred years, it is probable that, with the more scientific
modes of living and hygiene, such as are now increasingly
prevailing, it will more than double its population during
the next hundred years, and that, consequently, the vast
unoccupied ami uncultivated regions of the earth, such as
Siberia, Canada, Brazil, Australia, etc., will be largely filled
up with its overflowing millions.
Four Press Opinions from Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide.
THE “ARQUS” SAYS:
“The Whole World at a Glance” is what Mr. E. W. Cole has
set himself to depict in a new and elaborate map, which may be
had in one or two parts. . . . A great deal of labour must
have gone to its production, and it is indeed a ‘ Map of Concen-
trated World Knowledge.’ ’
THE “AQE” SAYS:
“ If the ideal map of the world is one which will, in addition
to being clearly printed and appropriately coloured, give in a
Printed at Cole • Book Arcade. Melbourne


concentrated form a miniature encyclopaedia of information
concerning each of the countries whose territories are depicted
on it, then Mr. E. W. Cole’s “The World at a Glance ” attains
the ideal. To the fastidious it may appear to aim at achieving too
much, but it succeeds so admirably in nine out of every ten efforts
that it makes, that the whole production can be fairly regarded
ns the most remarkable, complete, and ingenious wall map ever
got together in Australia within the space of 60 inches by 40.
. . . Altogether, Mr. Cole is to be congratulated upon his
unique map, both as regards its printing in fifteen colours and
general technical workmanship, and, also, as regards the spirit
of sane cosmopolitanism animating the whole enterprise. ‘ The
World at a Glance ’ should have a wide popularity in schools
and public institutions, to which, by the way, liberal reductions in
the published price are offered.”
THE SYDNEY “DAILY TELEGRAPH” SAYS
“ Mr. E. W. Cole, of Cole’s Book Arcade, Sydney and Mel-
bourne, whose praiseworthy energy and interest in forwarding
educational matters is well known, has just published a remark-
able map, which he has labelled ‘The World at a Glance.’ It
comprises, in point of fact, two separate studies. No. 1 map
illustrates the areas, positions, and boundaries of the countries
of the world, the number and density of their population, and the
principal flags of all countries, the flags totalling 136, and the
countries 140. Attached is statistical information of general
interest, compressed into a nutshell. . . . The entire publica-
tion is intended, Mr. Cole says, to convey interesting, instruc-
tive, and useful information about the world in a concise, yet
comprehensive and easily conceived form, and that object is
undoubtedly accomplished.”
THE ADELAIDE “ADVERTISER” SAYS:
“ It was an ambitious task which Mr. E. W. Cole, of Mel-
bourne, set himself when he resolved to produce for the home,
the school, and the office, a map that should present the whole
world at a glance, by which was meant a good deal more than
its natural features —oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, islands, moun-
tains, plains, etc. But, difficult as the task was, it has been com-
pleted in a manner which entitles Mr. Cole to the warmest con-
gratulations, for the result is a production as tastefully arranged
as it is useful. . . . Around it are grouped no fewer than
184 coloured portraits of men and women typical of as many
different races, civilised and savage, the object being to present
the ‘human race at a glance.’ Its ethnological interest should
render this section particularly valuable for school purposes.
. . . The outer border comprises the flags, appropriately
coloured, of the principal nations, 136 in all. The colouring,
indeed, is one of the most excellent features of this superb pro-
duction, to the preparation of which a good deal of skill and
trouble must have gone. Printed in 15 colours, and mounted on
canvas and rollers, the map, hung upon the wall, will be hailed by
all as a thing of beauty and a joy for ever. We have never seen
instructions in the vastly important subjects with which it deals
conveyed in so entertaining a form.”
The Maps are printed in 15 colours, they each measure
40 inches by 30 inches, and are mounted on canvas and
rollers. The price of the pair is 21/-, with a large discount
for Schools, Libraries, and Booksellers. Sold Wholesale and
Retail at Cole’s Book Arcades, Melbourne, Sydney, and
Adelaide.
