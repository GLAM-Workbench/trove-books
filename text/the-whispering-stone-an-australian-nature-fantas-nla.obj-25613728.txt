there
was a
little boy called Sandy,
vho would rather catch
yabbies in the creek than
pay attention to his les-
sons.
So, on school prize
da y, he didn’t get a
prize.
He didn’t really expect one. But he
felt disappointed just the same. He sat
Jn his favourite spot on the creek bank
and listened to the birds going to bed
with much fluttering and chirping. He
wished he knew what they were saying,
and wished he had paid more attention
to his lessons, and wished he had got a
prize and mostly wished he could think
of something exciting to do.
And then he remembered the Treasure
The Treasure had
been left at the
an old aboriginal
homestead long ago by
The Whispering
Stone
whose tribe Sandy’s kindly Dad had be-
friended in time of drought. It was a
hard little bundle wrapped in bark
cloth and tied with hair string and was
supposed to be very precious—or even
magic. When Sandy had asked what
was in it, his mother had smiled and
said: “Goodness knows. Just magic.
You’d better not open it. Something
might happen.’’ They had all laughed
about it and forgotten it.
But to-day Sandy felt he could do
with a bit of magic.
He jumped up suddenly and ran back
to the homestead. There in a box under
a pile of old books and things he found
the bark-covered Treasure.
He thought he would open it away
from the house just in case it might be
a messy sort of magic. And also so
that no one would interrupt and ask
what he was doing.


4« Perhaps it
Back at the creek again, he held it between
his knees and very, very carefully cut the hair
string with his pocket knife and unwrapped
the bark cloth.
It was only a stone.
It didn’t look in the least like a treasure. Or
even like magic. Just a stone, oval and grey,
marked on the surface with curving grooves and
bulges.
He held it up and shook it. Nothing hap-
pened. He rubbed it and blew on it. Nothing
happened. He even bit it. Still nothing
happened.
He looked at it thoughtfully. It was like
the picture of a human l?rain he had seen at
school. v
A strange sort of whisper came from the
stone. It seemed to answer: “If you can lis-
ten.” Then the whisper swelled into a chorus
of voices of all kinds, murmurs, hisses, grunts
and sounds of singing and even notes of music.
It sounded all through the forest. Sandy lis-
tened. From somewhere near him among the
trees a small shrill voice said with a little
cracked laugh: “ ‘Can you talk?’ That’s the
sort of stupid question humans ask. They used
to ask me Can you talk? Can you talk?’ for
months on end. I had to sit listening to them.
I was in a cage. But I didn’t answer their
stupid questions. They would put things over
the cage so that I couldn’t see. And sometimes
they would leave me in the hot sun and forget
me so that I nearly fainted. But I wouldn’t
talk. Not to humans—they’re too dense. I
sat longing for my companions of the bush,
hating to be alone. Till at last a little boy
with more sense than the rest opened the cage
and out I went. And they won’t catch me
again.”
Sandy looked round among the trees but the
only living thing he could see was a white
cockatoo with a yellow crest. He asked: “Was
that you talking, cocky?”

flick of its yellow
crest, and flew off to
join its companions
who were wheeling in
.tSM Sr a flock, their white
wings golden in the
setting sun.
“Don’t go,” cried
Sandy. He ran after
the bird but found
himself alone among the trees. Presently he
was aware of a plaintive little voice.
“Oh dear, oh dear,” it said. “Oh, these
frightful insects! And I do so want this
honey .. . and it burst into sobs.
All Sandy could see this time was a silver-
grey possum half-way up a tree. He stared at
it, wondering. It was not so surprising to hear
a cockatoo speak—but a possum?
Still sobbing to itself the possum started to
come down, catching the branches with its long
claws and helping itself with its dark bushy
tail. Suddenly it saw Sandy and stopped,
staring with big dark eyes.
“Don’t be
“Come down/' said Sandy.
shy."
The possum’s eyes grew bigger and rounder
with astonishment, its little pink nose quivered,
it let go of the branch it was holding with its
tail and almost fell to the foot of the tree.
“Excuse me/’ it said in a shaking voice, “was
that you I heard speaking?”
“Yes,” said Sandy. “Come on. I won’t
hurt you.”
“But a Boy speaking our language,” said the
possum. “How did that happen?”
Sandy showed it the stone.
“Ah!” said the possum as if that explained
everything. “How did you get it? Not many
humans have found the Whispering Stone.”
“I-er-borrowed it,” said Sandy. “Come
down. Don’t be scared.”
The possum drew itself up haughtily and
switched its long bushy tail. “I'm not scared,
only cautious. I can use my teeth and claws
when I have to and so can my common little
cousins the ringtails. But we’re a bit nervous
of humans. You’re always chasing us and
snaring us and trying to shoot us for our lovely
grey fur. It’s a wonder to me that you humans,
who think yourselves so clever, can only grow
you/' said the cocka-
too with a haughty


fur in clumps on your heads. And in such odd
colours.”
“That’s not fur, that’s hair,” said Sandy
hotly.
“Is it? It looks more like feathers to me.
Like the tawny owl.”
“It’s not feathers,” said Sandy. “Feel it.”
The possum edged along the bough and
clutched Sandy’s hair with an inquisitive paw.
“Strange stuff,” it said. “Nice for nests!”
It gave a tug. Sandy moved away hastily.
‘Don’t let's argue,” he said. “Have a bun.
I’ve got a pocket full.”
The possum snatched the bun and retreated
along the branch where it sat up and nibbled
the dainty eagerly, holding it in both paws.
Sandy could see the soft cream-coloured fur on
its tummy. He reached up and stroked the
possum’s silver-grey back. “What were you
crying about up the tree?” he said.
The possum choked down the last crumbs.
Its eyes filled with tears again. “The honey,”
it said. “I love honey. But every time I try
to get it from the wild bees’ nest those terrible
insects fly in my face. They buzz in my ears
and make me dizzy. It’s so rude of them. We
brush-tail possums are so sensitive.”
“Don’t worry,” said Sandy. “Australian
wild bees can’t sting—and, after all, it’s not
your honey.”
“Indeed!” said the possum indignantly.
“But for me there wouldn’t be so much honey.
I eat the parasite mistletoe from the flowering
gums they get their honey from.”
“Then they might spare you some,” said
Sandy. “Shall I get it for you?”
The possum’s eyes sparkled. “Oh, would
you? But can you climb that tree? You’ve
go no claws or tail.”
“Watch me!” said Sandy. He shinned up
the tree smartly as he had learned in the Scouts,
hoping the possum was admiring him./l He
scooped a piece of bark into \\ J/J
the hollow that held the bees’
nest and brought it down
honey-laden. The possum
neatly nibbled off the honey,
smacking its chops with evi-
dent enjoyment. Then it
licked its claws clean and
wiped its tongue over its little C
pink snout like a lady wiping
her face with a powder puff

My word, it said. “I never heard of a boy
robbing a bees' nest for a possum before. I
must show you to my friends."
It scrambled rather clumsily down from the
tree and ran to a tree stump by the creek bank.
Here it sent a curious snoring call out over the
quiet water.
There was a ripple in the water and some-
thing like a fiat brown velvet pincushion came
out on the bank. It had a broad flat tail and
a broad flat snout like the beak of a duck but
grey and rubbery and smooth as a kid glove.
"A platypus," said Sandy. "Can it talk,
too?"
"If he likes," the possum said. "He’s rather
proud, and doesn't talk to many people."
"Here's a boy who can talk,” said the pos-
sum. "I was telling him what an important
person you are—the only one in the world that
has a bill like a duck and feet like a goose with
claws, and fur like a seal and can growl and
lay eggs."
"Mrs. Platypus lays the eggs," said the
platypus, his beady eyes twinkling. "By the
way, we ve got another set of twins—we
usually have twins—and though I say it my-
self, they're the prettiest and most elegant babies
in the bush—just like fat white grubs."
He sat up and began to comb the water from
his fur with his fore-paws, pulling his loose
skin about as if he were a little man in a very
big dressing gown. He looked so funny that
mrting his feelings. To please the platypus
le said: "I’ve heard how clever you are. I wish
could make burrows with false passages and
ouble entrances to baffle people with."
"We don't make two entrances to our bur-
rows to baffle people," said the platypus.
"People aren’t smart enough to be worth the
trouble. We make one door near the water and
another higher up for when the creek floods.
Mrs. Platypus makes the best burrows. She

made a special burrow for the twins —a long
one with a little round room at the end filled
with grass and gumleaves, all cosy for the little
ones. And every here and there she fills the
burrow solid with earth so that inquisitive
creatures looking for baby platypuses come up
against a blank wall and think the burrow’s
empty.”
He gave a growling chuckle. He had brushed
and combed his fur until it was dry and shin-
ing. “We platypuses like to keep ourselves to
ourselves,” he said and with a wink of his
little beady eye at Sandy he slipped into a hole
under an overhanging tree-root and dis-
appeared.
It was growing dark. The
“Don’t go,” said the possum. “The day—
I mean the night—is only beginning. Come
back to my house in the hollow tree. And
bring all the buns.”
“I’d love to,” said Sandy, “but Mum will
think I’ve fallen in the creek. She always does.
And they’ll come looking for me with hurri-
cane lamps and be as cross as anything. And if
I go home to tell them I won’t be home, they’ll
say it’s bed time. What can we do?”
They sat thinking side by side on the tree-
stump. Suddenly the possum said: “You can
write, can't you? Humans are always putting
up notices about things in the forest. The boo-
book owl reads them. Things about camp-


fires and fishing seasons and Shut the Gate This
Means You and so on. Write a notice to them
and I’ll take it."
It leapt to the trunk of a gum-tree and rip-
ped off a piece of bark with its long claws.
Sandy caught the idea and found himself a
piece of charred stick to write on the bark—
Dear Mum and Dad I am staying a while at
the house of the Possum who brings you this.
Love. Sandy.
They went to the edge of the homestead
paddock where the possum took the bark and
disappeared into the gathering shadows. Sandy
watched the orange light that shone from the

He saw his Dad and Mum peering after the

he was still watching, the possum appeared
silently at his side.

foot of a huge tree whose top seemed to shoot
up among the stars. The tree was hollow inside
and they went in through a triangular doorway
as if into an enormous tent. Above, the walls
melted into shadow with a gleam of starlight in
the places where holes showed the sky.
Sandy flashed his pocket torch round the
walls. There were rustlings and whispers and
swift movements in the dark. From above
something called: “More pork. More pork.”
“A mopoke,” said Sandy.
Two points of light swooped down from
the darkness and turned into the eyes of a fiercc-
looking little brown owl who perched on a
bump in the wall.
“I’m glad somebody knows I’m a mopoke,”
it said, “instead of calling me a boobook owl.
I can sit and call ‘more pork,’ ‘more pork’ all
night long fit to deafen myself and everybody
else—and they give the credit to my cousin,
that big stupid tawny frogmouth because he
looks large and important and everybody
notices him. All he can say is ‘oom, oom,’ and
nothing more.”
“Well, there’s just as much sense in saying
‘oom, oom’ as in saying ‘more pork’ all night
long,” piped a little green tree frog clinging to
the wall.
A prickly bundle uncurled itself from the
dead leaves at the root of the tree and poked
out a long snout like a rubber tube.
“What’s all this?” asked the spiny ant-
eater sleepily. “Must you all argue and chat-
ter? You’ll wake those noisy birds up above.
And they’ll start their usual slanging match.
And what’s this large animal on its hind legs
doing here? You know our rule: NO large
animals to live in Hollow Tree House.”

possum. “He’s a special tame honey-getting

“A boy I” cried the echnida in alarm, start-
ing to curl itself into a prickly ball again.
“Fancy bringing a BOY into our peaceful
home! Pink-nose, you’re as silly as a bandi-
coot!”
“What’s that?” asked a little brown creature
with bright beady eyes and a long thin nose
suddenly appearing from a burrow in the tree
base.

Its song was cut short by a sarcastic shriek
from above: “So you say!” Two pink and
grey galah cockatoos swooped down to the
base of the tree and flew around screaming:
“Less noise there! Less noise! Less noise! Be
quiet and let reasonable people get a night's
sleep!” They were followed by a great white
bird with a yellow crest who shrieked even
louder: “Less noise Less noise there your-
selves, you pink-headed nitwits! You’re mak-
ing more noise than anyone!”
They flew round and round, the rush of
their wings echoing in the hollow of the tree,
each trying to shriek louder than the other.
The argument was deafening.
Suddenly the white cockatoo caught sight of
Sandy. She shrilled: “Oh, it’s the boy—the
boy I saw on the creek bank. Why aren’t you
asleep in your nest, you rascal?”


“Possum invited me to stay here," said
Sandy stoutly.
“Pink-nose, aren’t you ashamed of your-
self?” cried the cockatoo. “Don’t you know
this boy is a day-time animal? If you keep
him up all night he’ll die, just as you would if
people kept you up all day.”
“Oh, please, Mrs. Galerita,” said Pink-nose
rather timidly. “I didn’t know. I thought he
might protect us from —you know.”
“Of course,” said Sandy to help poor Pos-
sum out. '77/ protect you all. But-er-what
from?”
A chill had fallen on the assembly. Even
the cockatoos were silent. With a nervous
glance towards the doorway, Pink-nose whis-
pered:
“The Visitor from the North.”
“Who’s that?” asked Sandy.
A chorus of voices told him: “He has eyes
like fire! ... He has long terrible claws! ... He
is seven feet long! . . . Humans run away from
him! ... He cracks his tail like a whip! . . .
Even the tiger-snakes are afraid of him! . . .
He even eats his own kind! ... He comes as
silently as a shadow! ... He can turn invisible
on a tree-trunk!”
«es of}£
Crr °TF)g e
It all sounded terrible.
“He’s coming south, coming south,” chir-
ruped two tiny voices from above. Two small
grey shapes fluttered down from the dark
heights of the tree, drifting from side to side
like falling leaves. When they came into the
light Sandy saw they were tiny possums with
tails like feathers.
“We saw him. We saw him,” chirruped the
Feathertails. “He looked very hungry and
fierce with his cruel orange eyes gleaming. But
he didn’t see us. We hid among the leaves.”
For a moment Sandy almost wished he had
gone home to bed instead of coming with the
possum. But he could not disappoint his new
friends. So he said bravely: “Never mind.
I’m here. And perhaps he won’t come after
all.”
“Oh yes, he will,” said the Feathertails.


«v\ jlM^,
“Pink-nose, you’d better look out. You can’t
escape him like we can.”
“Oh dear, oh dear,” said Pink-nose in a
trembling voice.
“You possums have no courage,” said the
boobook owl, ruffling its tawny feathers and
looking fiercer than ever. “Sticking in your
holes in the trees, squalling with terror and let-
ting him know where you are while he climbs
up. Why, even the aborgines can make you
call out by scratching the bark with a stick so
that it sounds like his claws, and then they just
come and get you. While, if you kept your
heads, no one would know you were there.
You’re worse than numbats and bandicoots.”
or anything
but a lovely
disposition
and a talent
for scratch-

A sharp squeaking voice broke
in! “He’s not here yet. I know. I can’t smell him.
I can’t hear him. I can’t feel him. I’ll tell you
when he comes —if he comes at night.”
“But not when we’re cornered,” said the pos-
sum.
“That’s right, Pipistrelle,” said Mrs. Gal«-
rita. “You bats can watch at night. And the
cockatoos will look out in the day time. And
between us both it will take a shrewd goanna
to get by.”
“Cornered or not,” said the bandicoot,

So the Visitor was a goanna!
Sandy said: “Goannas aren’t so bad. I’ve
seen them on the trees.”
“Not goannas like this,” said the possum in
a shaking voice. “This is the Wicked Perenty
—the Old Man Goanna from the North.”


<«««,„ ..-o j&£

• \ wffw n^
Sandy had heard of the terrible Northern
goannas. But he remembered Dad saying:
"Don’t cross your bridges till you come to
them." He said to the animals: "Cheer up.
Have a bun.”
He divided one among them. Pink-nose ate a
piece greedily. The owl took one doubtfully.
The cockatoos snatched theirs. The tree frog
didn’t want any. The echidna sucked a piece
but put it out, saying it much preferred worms,
and went off mumbling grumpily: "All this
fuss and nonsense about a goanna! What do I
care about goannas?" and buried itself, prickles
and all, among the tree roots.


„ _ i
“I’m hungry,” said
Sandy.
There are some nice concertina grubs in the
tree next door,” said Mrs. Galerita.
“And some delicious ants here, and some
juicy worms in the creek bank,” said the echidna
who was returning from his nightly prowl.
That won’t do,” said Sandy. He began to
think about his breakfast. And as he thought,
he began to see how to deal with the unwelcome
Visitor. He ate his last bun and set off for the
township.
A.t Mr. Willup s General Store, where the
family dealt, he got supplies for himself, pre-
served fruit for his new friends, jam for the
possum, biscuits for the cockatoos and sweets
for all of them. He had them put in a wooden
box with a lid and got Mr. Willup to screw

hinges and a hasp and staple on the box. He
also got a tin-opener, a ball of twine and a
length of clothes-line.
/‘This is rather a big box for you, Sandy,”
said Mr. Willup. “Shall I put it on the mail-
car when it goes past?”
No thank you, said Sandy, “I can carry
it all right.”
“Picnic, eh?” said Mr. Willup. He helped
Sandy loop the line round the box and heft it
on his shoulders. Sandy set off again for the
hollow tree.
. After lunch Sandy spent some time practis-
ing mysterious arrangements with the empty
box and a stick and a piece of string. When
the contraption worked all right he planted it
under a tree fern near the creek with an open
tin of meat in it.
It was full afternoon when he finished. The
sun was coming straight down between the tall
gums and the depths of the forest looked green
and cool. Mrs. Galerita was dozing on a
branch.
From the forest sounded a loud “cheer-i-
-000. Mrs. Galerita spread her yellow crest.
‘Satin bower birds,” she said, and glided off
among the trees.


<s? yft <*> *
Sandy followed her flight as best he could
until at last in a silent gully he found a dark-
blue bird busily engaged building a little house
with a floor of sticks and walls of tall grasses.
He was so intent on what he was doing that he
did not notice Sandy and the cockatoo. He
would seize a stick here and place it neatly on
the floor, pick up a twig there and push it with
a skilful twist of his beak into the walls. He
had decorated his bower with all sorts of things
—berries, snail-shells, bones, scraps of paper,
bits of glass. Most of the decorations seemed
to be blue —blue paper, blue glass, a bit of blue
ribbon, a piece of blue matchbox. While he
admired them, stepping back with his head on
one side to see the effect, a yellow-green bird
watching near-by said: ‘‘lt’s lovely, darling.”
“Thank you, my dear,” said the blue bird.
“Very nice, too,” said Mrs. Galerita in her
harsh voice.
The bower-birds looked up startled.
“Ah,” said the blue satin-bird. “More visi-
tors! Very trying to my artistic temperament.
I can’t create in public. And anyway you
should have come later when I had painted it.
But if you like I will dance and sing for you
in my little theatre here. People come from all
over the world to see me —but it disconcerts me
a bit if I know they’re watching. Only a little
while ago a naturalist person (fairly harmless
for a human) came with a machine that went
like this —” he made a whirring noise like a
movie camera “ —to take pictures of me. He
hid in the grass for hours, hoping I couldn’t see
him. So at last, not to disappoint the poor
fellow, I finished my bower. And painted it
with charcoal from the trees. But it wasn’t up
to my usual standard.”
He pranced a few steps in his theatre, accom-
panying himself absent-mindedly with a kind
of whirring sound as if he had clockwork in-
side him. Sandy said: “Aren’t you afraid
people will find your eggs in such a conspicuous
place?”
“Certainly not,” said the bower bird. “This
isn’t my home, it's my studio. Our nest is
forty feet up that tree there.”
They sat on a hollow log watching the
bower bird dancing and imitating all kinds of
noises, from the
call of the cock-
atoo to the rat-
tle of the mail-
man’s car

-i ■’“^■■ib^^
Suddenly a timid little voice from the log
said: “Excuse me, but have you seen any
bandicoots about?”
A cautious little head with a long pointed
nose and small pointed ears poked out of the
log. Then a little brown-furred body that
broke into brown and white stripes at the end
like a football jersey that had slipped, came in-
to view. Last came a long hairy tail.
“Are you a bandicoot?” asked Mrs. Galerita.
“No,” said the animal shyly. “I'm a num-
bat from the West.”
“And why didn’t you stay there?” said Mrs.
Galerita severely.
“A b-bushfire came,” stammered the num-
“Very silly of you,”
Galerita. “Why do you
bandicoots?”
“Well, they have lots of rel
in the West, you see,” said the num
bat apologetically, “and I though
if I could find one, it might tellfM
how to get back. But I can’t nn<
any. They don’t seem to be about in the day-
time.” It looked ready to cry.
“There’s one at the Hollow Tree House,”
said Sandy, “if you like to come with us.”
“Oh, please—please may I?” squeaked the
numbat. It jumped joyfully on Sandy’s knee.
The shadows were getting longer in the gul-
lies; the sunlight was changing in the turn of
the afternoon. They said good-bye to the
bower-birds and started for home. Half-way
there they saw a grey shape sliding down a tree-
trunk.
“Ah, there you are,” said Pink-nose the pos-
sum. “I’ve been looking for you. It’s getting
late in the day, so I thought I’d start the night
early. Have you any more buns?”


“We must hurry," said
Mrs. Galerita, “or I'll be
late for my evening exercise
with the flock —but what’s
that?”
A burst of angry squeaks
and hisses and the rustling
*of paper sounded from a
near-by thicket. Pink-nose
and the numbat got there first. They found a
brown spiky lizard crying bitterly and stamp-
ing angrily on a piece of paper. At first it
seemed too enraged and upset to tell them what
the trouble was, but at last it pointed to the
paper. They saw it was a page from a nature
magazine with a portrait of the lizard and the
name: Bearded Dragon.
“The boobook owl told me," cried the lizard
between sobs and hisses. “I-I was so pleased
when I saw my own picture, smiling so sweetly
with my mouth wide open, that I showed it to
to her. And she said they called me that! It’s
all wrong! I-I haven’t got a beard and I-I’m
not a dragon. Ow! Ow!”
“Well, why worry?” said Pink-nose.
“Dragons are much more important people
than lizards.”
“And not everybody can grow a beard,"
said Mrs. Galerita, “even if it is only spikes."
“You ought to be pleased," said the num-
bat. “Dragons are brave. Everyone is
frightened of them."
“That’s the trouble!" cried the poor little
lizard, stamping on its own tail with rage and
dismay. “People try to hit me with sticks;
boys throw stones at me. I don’t want them
to be frightened of me. I want them to love
me. I wouldn’t even hurt a fly—that is, un-
less it was a very fat juicy one," it added
thoughtfully.
“Well, what would you rather be called?"
asked Pink-nose.
“Something nice," said the lizard, “like
Fairy-Face."
“Well, I don’t think we could do that,” said
the possum, looking carefully at the lizard,
“But how would 'Frilly’ do?"
“So long as they don’t think I’m my big
cousin, the Frilled Lizard of the North, it
would do very nicely,” said the lizard. “Will
you tell everybody?"
“Come with us and you can tell them your-
self,” said the possum. “The Boy is giving us
a big party at the Hollow Tree House to-
night."

Sandy’s party at the Hol-

Sandy went to the doorway with his torch.
The shadows were getting thicker and darker
every moment. He could see nothing. He felt
a bit trembly, but he left his torch in the door-
way to comfort the animals, and went out into
the shadow.
“even if he is a close rela-
tion, I consider him a grubby fellow.”
There was some argument between the day-
time and night-time animals as to whether the
party was breakfast or tea, but the argument
did not interfere with appetite. An uninvited
guest came in the person of a stray baby wom-
bat; it had lost its mummy and was inclined
to whimper. Sandy mixed it some condensed
milk in the lid of a tin; it drank the milk till
it could drink no more and fell asleep peace-
fully in the empty lid.
A harsh hissing voice
from the broken limb of a
tree said:

The voice went on: “You had better go
away. I will bite you with my sharp teeth.
I will claw you with my long claws. I will
whip you with my strong tail. This is my
forest. Mine by right.”
“Why?” asked Sandy.
Because Might is Right

Sandy thought of his friend Pink-
nose trembling in the tree.

late into the night he guarded the tree until the
lack of sound told him the Goanna had gone
off to seek prey elsewhere.
In the morning he looked outside. Tracks
showed where the Goanna had walked round
and round the Tree during the night, kept at
bay by Sandy’s torch.
Sandy thought of what the Goanna had said
to him. He sought out the tiny glider possum.
“Feathertail,” he said. “He can’t resist
possums. I want you to help me. He told the
little possum his plan.
“Oh, I couldn’t,” the tiny possum chittered.
“I couldn’t. I really couldn’t. I’m too
scared.”
“He can’t get you,” said Sandy. “He
couldn’t possibly if you keep your head. I’ll
stand by. And think how happy they’ll all be
to be rid of him.”
At last the possum consented. Sandy went
to his box trap, smeared some jam on the floor
and cut a very small hole, just big enough for
a pigmy possum to get through in the back of
Now they were ready. The possum got
in the box and Sandy fixed the stick and
string. The little possum began to call out in
a high shrill voice: “Oh dear, oh dear, I'm
caught, I’m stuck, I can’t get away.”
Soon there was a rustling in the dry ferns—
and there was Perenty the Goanna!
Feathertail’s voice grew shriller with real

The Goanna’s eyes glowed like coals. With
one lightning dive he was into the box. But
quicker even than lightning Feathertail popped
out of the hole in the back, Sandy pulled the
string, the box fell with a SLAM! . . . and the
greedy Goanna was trapped.

Sandy rushed to fasten the

Goanna was hissing and
slamming and banging about
inside.

animals were there, including the baby wom-
bat’s mother who had come in search of her
wandering child, and finding so many good
things to eat, had decided to stay.
The bandicoot sang more songs accompanied
by the numbat blowing on a gumleaf, and this
time the galahs had enough manners not to
interrupt. The music was only ended by the
numbat absent-mindedly eating the gumleaf.
Even the platypus was quite nice to his poor
cousin the echidna, and the echidna for once
forgot to mumble and grumble.
The noise in the Tree was at
its height when the Owl drew
Sandy aside.
“I am the wisest of birds,’’ it
said, “and I can show you some-
thing that humans seldom find.
And bring the Stone with you.”
Together they went out into
the night. The stars of
the Southern Cross threw a
faint magical light over the
tree-ferns as the Owl and
Sandy climbed the mountain, keeping near the
creek until they came to a slender waterfall,
white and feathery on the face of a steep rock.
In the faint light the waterfall looked like a
tall figure whose white veils moved in the
breeze.
“Hold the Stone in the water,’’ said the Owl,
“and you will hear what few people have heard
—the Voice of Wisdom.’’
Sandy, on his knees, held the Stone in the
spray at the foot of the fall. In the sound of
the falling water he heard a sweet voice.
“So you found the Stone that
gives Understanding,’’ it said,
“and you have been brave and
iC;- wßm kind. All those who under-
: stand are brave and kind.’’
“What, this Stone?” Sandy
asked.

Sandy put the Stone
down in an eddy at the
foot of the fall.
“Good-bye,” said
the Voice in the water,
and was silent. He
could hear nothing but
the ripples over the
stones.
He came slowly
down the dark mount-
ain with the Owl. Far
below on the flats he


could see tiny orange points of light moving.
People were out with lanterns.
‘‘They’re looking for me,” he said. He un-
derstood how anxious they would be on his
third night away from home. ‘‘l must go.”
The possum was waiting for them further
down, like a grey shadow in a tree.
“Don’t leave us,” it said, “after all you’ve
done for us.”
“I’d love to stay,” said Sandy. “But I must
go. I’ll be back now I know where to find
you.”
“And I know where to find you,” said the
possum. ‘‘And don’t let your Dad come out
and throw things when I dance on the roof on
a moonlight night.”
“Good-bye,” said Sandy.
“Good-bye,” said the owl.
“Good-bye,” said the possum. It added
wistfully: “And bring some more buns when
you come back again, won’t you?”
