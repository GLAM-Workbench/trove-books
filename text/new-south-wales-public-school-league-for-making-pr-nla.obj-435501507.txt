1 It is estimated that in this colony one-third of the children of school age are
receiving no education. In due time these children will become citizens, and it
is neither fair to them nor safe for the State to let them grow up in ignorance. The
first and chief aim of the League is to make education universal by a
National and uniform system, that shall embrace all children of school age within
the colony ; and that shall be based on the common and equal rights of all
members of the commonwealth.
2. Among all nations religious instruction is held to be supremely important.
The League does not seek in any way to depreciate or hinder this instruction, but
simply maintains that in a community of various religious faiths, the State
cannot justly be the religious teacher of its people. We can have no religious
tests of citizenship, no religious qualification of voters, jurors, legislators, civil
servants, and officers and ministers of the Crown, such as can come within the
proper cognizance of the State; and, consequently, Denominational Education
ought not to be supported out of public funds. Secular instruction is held to
include the common literary arts, which are the essentials of all common school
education. In regard to the class-books to be used, the League holds it to be beyond
its province to express an opinion further than this: That common justice
requires these books to be such as shall not give reasonable ground of offence to the
consciences of any class of citizens, and at the same time as reading books, they
ought to give the children of an English-speaking community a fair specimen—as
.as.4> u„- o Lleiatnr* of.Jji.g. In^-ns' ■’% the Scripture

has no objection to urge. Nor does it object tc special religious instruction being
given, provided this can be done without cost to the State, without interfering
with the ordinary course of secular instruction, and without favour to any one
section of the people in preference to any other. . .
3. Providing schools throughout the colony will not necessarily make education
universal, for there are thousands of children growing up in ignorance within
reach of .schools already existing. The result of this ignorance cannot bo
confined to the families in which it is permitted to exist, but must fall upon the
whole people. The League, therefore, holds that it is equitable to enforce the
child’s right from the parent to such a minimum of education as may qualify that
child to become an intelligent citizen, and be able at least to read the laws which
he must obey at the peril of his liberty and even his life. A compulsory provision
need not force a single child into the State schools it only claims power to
compel attendance where parents and other guardians of children are neglecting
to have them educated up to a given standard, and where no satisfactory reason
can bo given for such neglect. It will be for Parliament to determine both what the
standard must be, and what are the constitutional ways in which the power to
compel can be equitably and efficiently applied. .
4. The League proposes that whatever standard of education Parliament
may decide upon as the minimum of which all children are to be in possession,
this standard shall be free of fees to all the children of school age throughout
the colony There will thus be no invidious distinction between those who pay
and those who do not; for all will pay equitably through the general taxation
of the country, and therefore none will be in the position of paupers. Ley on d
this minimum standard the League leaves it for Parliament to determine whether
fees shall or shall not be charged, as may be found practicable and most convenient.
